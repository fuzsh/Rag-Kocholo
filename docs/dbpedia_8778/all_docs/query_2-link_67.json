Wartburg College senior quarterback Matt Sacia (Sr., Eldridge, Iowa/North Scott), for the second-straight year, was chosen as the conference's Offensive Most Valuable Player. Simpson College linebacker Michael Connor (Sr., Woodward, Iowa/Woodward-Granger) has been named the Defensive Most Valuable Player. Simpson head coach Matt Jeter and his staff earned the Coach of the Year honor.\n\nSacia improved on his outstanding 2017 numbers, recording conference-highs in yards (2,434), pass efficiency (197.5), touchdowns thrown (29) and completion percentage (73.3%). He started all eight conference contests for the 7-1 Knights (8-2 overall). He also completed the most passes of any quarterback in the conference with 170 in 232 attempts. Sacia has thrown up some very impressive overall stats as well, ranking third in NCAA Division III with a passing efficiency of 189.1 and second nationally in completion percentage at 72.0%. Sacia (2017, 2018) is the 10th Wartburg player to earn MVP honors, joining Murray McMurray (1968), Connie Hellerich (1969), Mike Ward (1982), Scott Fritz (1983), Gary Walljasper (1984), Vince Penningroth (1995), Matt Wheeler (1999), Spencer Capitani (Defensive MVP 2014) and Logan Schrader (2014, 2015).\n\nConnor rose to the first team as a senior after earning honorable mention last year. The linebacker led the conference with 91 tackles and 8.5 sacks. Those are averages of 11.4 tackles over the eight-game conference season and just more than one sack per game. His overall season numbers also led the conference with 113 tackles and the previously mentioned 8.5 sacks. Connor is the sixth Storm footballer to earn conference MVP honors and the second in the last six years. QB Taylor Nelson was the Offensive MVP in 2013. Other Simpson winners were Ricky Gales (1989), Brad Jorgenson twice (1996, 1997), Guy Leman (1998) and Mike Donnenwerth (1993).\n\nSimpson hasn’t had a Coach of the Year since Jay Niemann won in 2003. The Storm were picked fourth by the conference’s coaches in the preseason. Jeter had his team in the championship hunt until the second-to-last weekend of the season when it dropped a game at home to Dubuque. When Central won and Dubuque lost this past Saturday, the Storm ended the year in a three-way tie for second place at 6-2. Simpson was the only team to upend conference champion, Wartburg, during league play. The final overall record of 7-3 was just the 20th time in school history a Simpson team had seven wins or more. Simpson’s other Coaches of the Year were John Sullivan (1969), the great Jim Williams (1988, 1991, 1996, 1997) and Niemann.\n\nEight of the nine schools in the league had representatives on the first-team offense. Wartburg’s conference-championship team had offensive linemen Nic Vetter (Sr., Hampton, Iowa/Hampton-Dumont) and Hud Johnston (Sr., Maynard, Iowa/West Central) on the first unit along with Sacia. Wartburg’s offense was first in the conference in scoring offense (45.6 points per game) and passing offense (316.3 yards per game). Joining those two on the offensive line were Dalton Kuell (Sr., Cedar Rapids, Iowa/Jefferson) of Coe College, Collin Stefanowski (Sr., Lake Villa, Ill./Grant Community) of the University of Duqubue and Ryan Heinrichs (Sr., Davenport, Iowa/Assumption) of Loras College. Kuell is first team for the third-straight year. Stefanowski moved up from his second-team spot a year ago.\n\nThere’s a lot of talent in the first-team skill positions. The coaches, using wild-card votes, felt strongly enough that two quarterbacks should be on the first team. Central College’s Blaine Hawkins (So., Ankeny, Iowa/Ankeny) was second in the conference with a pass-efficiency ranking of 169.0. Despite missing a game with an injury, Hawkins was fifth in the conference with an average of 258.4 ypg.\n\nThree running backs made the first team, thanks again to the wild cards in the voting process. Nebraska Wesleyan University’s Shaka Taylor (Sr., Norfolk, Neb./Lutheran Northeast) was second in the conference with 111.8 ypg., finishing just shy of 900 yards in conference play. He scored six touchdowns. Simpson’s Cam Bunting (Sr., Indianola, Iowa/Indianola) was the leading ball-carrier in the league with 1,138 yards and was the leading scorer with 78 points on 13 TDs (11 rushing). Dubuque’s Dwayne Allen, Jr. (Jr., Hampshire, Ill./St. Edward) was just behind the top two with an average of 106.6 ypg. He scored five TDs in conference games. Taylor and Allen, Jr. are earning their second-consecutive first-team honors while Bunting is moving up to first team after being a second team selection a season ago.\n\nOnly one wide receiver made the all-conference first team. Buena Vista University’s Eric Pacheco (So., Kearney, Neb./Kearney Catholic) had 5.6 receptions per contest and scored six touchdowns. His nearly 80 ypg. average ranked fifth in the conference. Coe College tight end Matt Kopp (Jr., Belvidere, Ill./Belvidere) was an effective blocker and receiver for the Kohawks. One-fifth of his 25 receptions went for touchdowns.\n\nJoining Connor on the first-team defense were Simpson teammates Brendan Holmes (Jr., Atlantic, Iowa/Atlantic) and Ryan Lehr (Jr., Indianola, Iowa/Indianola), both defensive backs. Holmes tied for second in the conference with four interceptions, while Lehr had two. The duo tied for 11th in the league with 70 tackles. Each are earning their second all-league honors, with Holmes becoming a two-time first teamer and Lehr garnering first team accolades this season after being named second team in 2017.\n\nWartburg also had three defenders on the first team. JoJo McNair (So., Joliet, Ill./Joliet Central) could be the most dynamic player in the league. He was chosen first team as a defensive back and second team as a wide receiver and earned honorable mention as a return specialist. McNair was credited with nine passes defended and averaged almost five catches for per game, including nine touchdowns. He was second in kick returns (27.0 ypg. and one 91-yd TD) and third in punt returns (8.9 ypg.). Dillon Rademaker (Sr., Greene, Iowa/North Butler), collecting his second-straight first team honor, made a huge impact on the defensive line with 55 tackles, a conference-leading 20 of which were for loss (minus-88 yards). Connor Frerichs (Sr., New Hampton, Iowa/New Hampton), a linebacker, made 50 tackles in eight conference games.\n\nLuther College had a pair of first-teamers. Defensive back Dante Joseph (Sr., Layton, Utah/Northridge) was the ninth-leading tackler in the conference with 75. Joseph was voted a second team all-league member in 2017. Michael Noll (Sr., Lake City, Minn./Lincoln) tallied the fourth-most sacks in conference play with 5.5 and had a total of 42 tackles.\n\nFour schools placed one player on the defensive unit. Jordy Borman (Jr., Eagan, Minn./Eagan) of Central had eight passes defensed, two of which were interceptions. He rounded out the first-team defensive backs. Defensive lineman Daniel Vega (Sr., Cedar Rapids, Iowa/Jefferson) of Coe was ninth in the league with eight tackles for loss (-22 yards). Buena Vista’s Gary Weaver (Jr., Las Vegas, Nev./Arbor View), a lineman, was fourth in tackles for loss (13 for -49 yards) and had 43 total tackles. Weaver moves up to first team after collecting second team accolades a season ago. Linebacker Chris Miller (Jr., Waukon, Iowa/Waukon) of Loras was sixth in the conference with 77 tackles, but he climbed to second in sacks with a total of eight.\n\nThe first-team specialists were Central kicker Jon Alberts (Jr., Huntley, Ill./Huntley), Simpson punter Nathan Hawkins (Sr., Solon, Iowa/Solon) and Loras return man Elijah Thomas (Fr., Zephyrhills, Fla./Zephyrhills). Alberts, first team in 2017 as well, capped an outstanding season with a game-winning field goal this past Saturday. Alberts was the fourth-leading scorer in the conference, connecting on 7-of-7 field goals and 37-of-37 PATs. Hawkins punted for an average of 40.8 yards per punt on 41 kicks. Thomas led the league in kickoff returns with an average of 28.7 yards per return. He returned 14 punts for an average of 10.3 yards per return.\n\nThis year’s all-conference team, including the second-teamers and honorable-mention choices, has 11 states represented. There is at least one player from all nine conference schools on either the first or second teams. Wartburg earned the conference’s automatic berth to the NCAA Division III Football Championship, the first round of which begins this Saturday. The Knights travel to Minnesota to meet Bethel University in a noon kickoff."
