Here is the recap: (PR) Keegan DeWitt's film score for recent theatrical release Cold Weather is now available as a free download via his website.\n\nAfter recently premiering on Cinema Blend, DeWitt's two-disc Cold Weather score - one disc of the official score and another of demos - can now downloaded here, while an MP3 of the \"End Credits\" can be streamed and downloaded directly here.\n\nRecently chosen as a 'Critic's Pick' by The New York Times and praised by The Los Angeles Times (\"DeWitt's richly textured original score\"), the DeWitt-scored Cold Weather saw its New York premiere last weekend and will premiere in Los Angeles at the Sunset 5 tonight (February 11th). The film will continue to make its debut in multiple cities across the country over the next month (a full schedule is below), including on March 4th in the Portland, OR-raised DeWitt's current hometown of Nashville, where he will perform \"End Credits\" live. Cold Weather is also now available nationwide via On Demand. - more on this story\n\nPreview and Purchase Keegan DeWitt CDs"
