        "text": "Overview\n\nWilliam Earnest Harwell born in Washington, GA (pop. 2,500), 25 Jan 1918\n\nAtlanta correspondent for The Sporting News, 1934-1948\n\nSports department for the Atlanta Constitution, 1936-1940\n\nGraduated from Emory University, 1940\n\nSports director for WSB Atlanta, 1940-1942\n\nBroadcast Georgia Tech Football, 1940\n\nMarried Lulu (nickname for Lula) Tankersley, 30 Aug 1941(four children: sons Bill & Gray, twins Julie & Caroline)\n\nCalled 1942 Masters Golf Tournament\n\nUnited States Marine Corp, 1942-1946\n\nAtlanta Crackers baseball announcer, 1943 & 1946-1948\n\nBrooklyn Dodgers baseball announcer, 1948-1949\n\nNew York Giants baseball announcer, 1950-1953\n\nBaltimore Orioles baseball announcer, 1954-59\n\nBroadcast Baltimore Colts football games, 1955\n\nCalled three All-Star Games: 1958 (Baltimore); 1961 (Boston); 1991 (Toronto)\n\nDetroit Tigers baseball announcer, 1960-1991 & 1993-2002 (42 years)\n\nBroadcast Michigan State football games, 1963\n\nCBS Radio Game of the Week, 1992 & 1994\n\nCalled last game as Tiger’s announcer on 29 Sep 2002: Blue Jays 1, Tigers 0\n\nWent public with his diagnosis of terminal cancer, 4 Sep 2009\n\nLast appearance at Comerica Park, 16 Sep 2009\n\nDied in Novi (Oakland County) Michigan, 4 May 2010\n\nEarly Life\n\nParents were Davis Gray and Helen Harwell (Davis went by middle name of Gray)\n\nTwo older brothers: oldest Davis Jr. and Richard, i.e. Dick\n\nErnie & Dick less than two years apart were inseparable linked by their mutual passion for their father’s game of choice, baseball. Dick was introverted and a voracious reader; Ernie was precocious and upbeat.\n\nFather friends with baseball pitcher Sherrod Smith\n\nAt five years old family moved to Atlanta when father’s furniture business failed\n\nPassion for baseball sparked listening to 1926 World Series between the Cardinals & Yankees. Grover Cleveland Alexander struck out Yankee 2nd baseman Tony Lazzeri with the bases loaded & two outs in the 7th inning. Cardinals won it in the 9th when Ruth was thrown out trying to steal second. No radio speaker, so Ernie and brother Davis shared headphones with their heads sandwiched together – “from then on hooked on radio.”\n\nListened and mimicked the voices of his beloved Atlanta Crackers – Jimmy Davenport and Mike Thomas\n\nAs a youngster he would call imaginary broadcasts at Doc Green’s (former semi-pro ballplayer and friend of Ty Cobb) drug store with a pronounced speech impediment that prevented him from pronouncing the letter “s”\n\nParents sent him to local elocution teacher who had him read passages from literature and poetry including Sam Walter Foss’s “The House by the Side of the Road” later used as a signature call for a batter watching a called third strike.\n\nA few years after moving to Atlanta, father becomes paralyzed from the waist down after brain surgery to remove a tumor\n\nTo support the family, mother made and sold baked goods from their house. Ernie helped by having at various times a paper route; selling magazines and Christmas cards\n\nOne of his greatest thrills, March 1930 at age 12. Yankees in Atlanta for exhibition game. After the game Harwell met Ruth as he was leaving the field and asked for his autograph. Not having any paper, Harwell offered his shoe and Ruth obliged with a chuckle. It never occurred to Harwell to save the shoe.\n\nAttends his first World Series game in 1935 at Wrigley Field where the Cubs played the Tigers\n\nAs a youngster, played 2nd base for the North Side Terrors of the American Legion\n\nDid not play high school baseball as he was busy with his jobs plus he didn’t think he could hit. It wasn’t until he was in the Marines that he discovered the source of his hitting troubles – he needed glasses.\n\nKnack for sales and passion for baseball merged when he’d go to the Ansley Hotel and pitch himself as a bat boy for the visiting ball club (against his beloved Crackers). Often paid with a broken bat or worn out baseball.\n\nIn 1934, at age 16, wrote letter to The Sporting News, which he read religiously, offering his services as their Atlanta correspondent since news from the South was sparse.\n\nAttempting to hide his youth, he signed the letter “W. Earnest Harwell.” It worked & thus began a 31 year association with the publication. Eventually, he became one of several ghost writers for J.G. Taylor Spink, editor & publisher of TSN\n\nCareer\n\n•At 18 years old conducted first interview of a major league ballplayer. In 1936,\n\nPhiladelphia Athletics in Atlanta to play the Crackers. Harwell arranged\n\nto interview outfielder Wally Moses for Baseball Magazine. Moses was\n\nconversing with two other players when Harwell arrived. Barely noticing him\n\nthe players continued their graphic recounting of their sexual exploits the\n\nnight before. Harwell learned an invaluable lesson: ballplayers are human, not\n\ngods.\n\n•1948 traded from Atlanta Crackers broadcast booth to that of the Brooklyn Dodgers\n\nfor catcher Cliff Dapper on the Dodgers minor league team in Montreal. Branch\n\nRickey, Dodgers owner, needed a replacement for regular announcer Red\n\nBarber who was suffering from a perforated ulcer; Crackers owner, Earl Mann,\n\nwanted Dapper to manage his team the next year.\n\n•1951 pennant race ended in a tie between the Dodgers and Giants which forced a three\n\ngame playoff. In game three, with the Dodgers leading 4-2 in the 9th with one out\n\nand two men on, Bobby Thomson hit a line drive into the leftfield seats. Harwell\n\nand his partner Russ Hodges alternated between radio and television through\n\nout the series, and it was Harwell’s turn to become the voice of television for the\n\nbig day. Harwell figured he lucked out because he was the only TV voice, as\n\nopposed to one of many on radio. He figured wrong. Hodges’ call of the most\n\nfamous moment in baseball history has been played more than any\n\nbroadcaster’s call: “The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!”\n\nvideo cassette recorders weren’t yet invented, so there is no record of Harwell’s\n\nNBC-TV call.\n\n•Called radio broadcast of 1958 All-Star game held in Baltimore (Collection has his NL\n\nlineup card.)\n\n•With George Kell’s recommendation, Harwell hired as his broadcast partner in 1960 for\n\nTiger games. The man who worked in Atlanta, New York, & Baltimore took root\n\nin Detroit. This move marked a crossroads in his personal life as well. Both his\n\nparents died ,six days apart in Feb 1960, in his first spring training with the\n\nTigers.\n\n•Along with Joe Garagiola called the 1963 World Series, between the Yankees and the\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers, for NBC radio. A slice of Harwell’s call of Game 2 can\n\nbe heard coming out of a radio in the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.\n\nHarwell can also be seen and/or heard in Tigertown, Cooperstown, Aunt Mary,\n\nCobb, and Paper Lion.\n\n•Blessed with witnessing great players with the teams he worked for: With Dodgers\n\ngot to call games with Jackie Robinson; with Giants he saw the debut\n\nof Willie Mays; with Baltimore Orioles saw the replacement of 3rd basemen\n\nGeorge Kell with Brooks Robinson; with the Tigers witnessed the career of Al\n\nKaline.\n\nMajor Awards\n\n•Inducted into Baseball Hall of Fame, 2 Aug 1981\n\n•Adrian College, honorary degree, 3 Sep 1985\n\n•Michigan Sports Hall of Fame, 1989\n\n•National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame, 1989\n\n•Northern Michigan University, honorary degree, 15 Dec 1990\n\n•Radio Hall of Fame 1998\n\n•Ty Tyson Award for excellence in broadcasting awarded by Detroit Sports\n\nBroadcasters Association, 2001\n\n•University of Michigan, honorary degree, 26 Apr 2008\n\n•Wayne State University, honorary degree, 3 May 2008\n\nSidelights\n\n•Margaret Mitchell\n\nConnection to Margaret Mitchell – author of Gone With the Wind – began when she was on his paper route; he also sold her Christmas cards and she bought baked goods from his mother. Another connection to Mitchell is through his brother Dick, who received a signed copy of GWTW from Mitchell in 1936. This copy became the first item in what would become a large GWTW memorabilia collection. Dick often socialized with Mitchell and her husband. A renowned Confederate historian, Dick wrote four GWTW related books. It was from Dick that Ernie gained interest in writing. Dick died in 1988.\n\n•WSB radio\n\nAmong notables interviewed: Ted Williams, Connie Mack, Pee Wee Reese, boxer Jack Dempsey, golfing great Bobby Jones, and first tennis Grand Slam\n\nwinner Don Budge. At WSB Ernie called GA Tech football games and the\n\nMasters Golf Tournament in 1941.\n\n•Ty Cobb\n\nHarwell traveled to Cobb’s hometown of Royston, GA to interview the legend.\n\nDespite his reputation as cantankerous and ornery, Ernie always found him\n\nagreeable and accommodating. Harwell, a baseball historian, was fascinated by\n\nCobb’s career and could never read or write enough about him.\n\n•Baseball Collection\n\nErnie’s baseball collection began when he took money earned from his paper route and began purchasing Reach, Spaulding, Beadle, and DeWitt guides; and The Sporting News magazine. The collection grew to include photos, cards, programs, media guides, books, etc. . . that he donated to DPL in 1966 because the collection was becoming too large and because he became uncomfortable with collecting, seemingly, just for the sake of collecting.\n\n•Photo Collection\n\nBill Kuenzel (d. 1964), one of the first sports photographers in the country who\n\nworked for the Detroit News from 1901-mid 1950s, had collected hundreds of\n\nphotos. During the 1950s, he approached Tigers owner, Walter O. Briggs, with\n\nThe idea of publishing them in an anniversary book. Briggs rejected the idea and\n\nKuenzel gave the photos to an assistant. This man’s son, in turn, sold them to\n\nHarwell. The collection included scrapbooks of 8X10 World Series photos 1905\n\nto mid 1950s, team pictures, individual shots, and action shots. These photos\n\nwere part of initial donation to the library in 1966.\n\n•USMC\n\nNever saw combat duty. Served primarily as writer in Atlanta, Richmond, NC, Washington, DC. Wrote for official marine publication Leatherneck.\n\n•Jackie Robinson\n\nFirst year in major league baseball was 1948 when Robinson was Dodgers’ 2nd\n\nbaseman. Robinson was the most exciting and competitive player Harwell ever\n\nsaw. He was also the player who got the most out of his abilities – not the most\n\ntalented – more determination than natural ability. When traveling with the team,\n\nhe often played card games with players Pee Wee Reese, Gil Hodges, and\n\nRobinson.\n\n•Willie Mays\n\nGreatest player Harwell ever saw “And I always say that without hesitation.\n\nWillie’s joy of playing impressed me more than anything else. The verve he\n\nplayed with, the boyishness he showed on the field. . . . He had so much ability\n\nand could beat you so many ways. . . . Willie was a natural born baseball star\n\nfrom the beginning.”\n\n•Christian faith\n\nBecame a born-again Christian at a Billy Graham Easter service in Bartow, FL ,\n\njust outside Lakeland, during Tiger spring training in 1961. He helped establish\n\nbaseball chapel with Bobby Richardson, Yankee 2nd baseman during the Mantle\n\nyears. Baptized in the Jordan River on 8 Jan 1985 where its believed that John\n\nthe Baptist baptized Jesus. Harwell is humble about his faith and doesn’t force\n\nit on anyone.\n\n•Song Writer\n\nHas had 65 of his songs recorded. Most famous song to baseball fans is “Move\n\nOver Babe, Here Comes Henry” during Aaron’s pursuit of Ruth’s all-time home\n\nrun record. Aaron allowed his image & autograph on the record sleeve. The man\n\nwho got Ruth to sign his shoe, got the man who broke Ruth’s record to sign his\n\nrecord jacket more than 40 years later. His most famous writing, however, isn’t a\n\nsong but an ode to baseball – written in 1955 & then recited, in part, at his Hall of\n\nFame induction in 1981 – A Game for All America.\n\n•Most embarrassing mistake during broadcast:\n\nTigers at California Angels. Game tied 1-1 in 8th . Dave Collins of the Angels\n\nstole home. Tiger manager Ralph Houk came out to protest. As Ernie described\n\nthe scene he said “Bill Freehan is there, too. Now Freehan is beating his meat at\n\nhome plate.” He meant to say mitt.\n\n•Jose Feliciano\n\nHarwell selected him to sing the national anthem for Game 5 of the 1968 World\n\nSeries on October 7. Feliciano’s bluesy rendition set off a firestorm of\n\ncontroversy. Harwell remains unapologetic to this day and believes it was\n\nboth well done and appropriate. “I felt he did it in a good way. It was sort of\n\nstylized, but he did it that way because that was his style and he was just paying\n\ntribute to the country.”\n\n•Urinal\n\nWhen asked what memento he wanted to take with him from Tiger stadium\n\nHarwell replied, “The thing I want most is the urinal in the visiting clubhouse\n\nbecause every Hall of Famer from Babe Ruth to Mark McGwire used it.”\n\nWhen asked later if he ever got the urinal, a disappointed Harwell replied, “No,\n\nLulu wouldn’t let me bring it home. I tried to tell her how nutritious it would\n\nbe for her garden. I told her what a good thing it would be for her roses, but\n\nshe didn’t think it was a very good idea.”\n\nSignature Phrases\n\n•\"Does a baseball announcer need signature phrases – trademarks by which his\n\nlisteners identify him? I don’t think so. . . . if the phrases come naturally,\n\nthat’s fine. But if they are contrived, they don’t work. . . . Most of my\n\nspecial phrases came late in my career.\" (My 60 Years, p.84)\n\n•Exception was called third strike call “He stood there like the house by the side of the\n\nroad” that he began using in 1946 calling Atlanta Cracker games\n\n•Another called third strike, \"He's out for excessive window shopping”\n\n•\"Loooooong Gone!\" began in the 1980s for a home run\n\n•\"Two for the price of one\" double play call began in the 1970s\n\n• Exclaiming \"The Tigers need instant runs\" when Detroit had fallen behind by more\n\nthan two or three runs\n\n• Frequently referring to the location of Tiger Stadium as \"the corner of Michigan and\n\nTrumbull,\" or simply \"the corner\"\n\n• Following up foul balls into the crowd with, \"That one was caught by a fan from\n\n_____,\" and inserting the name of a Michigan town or city\n\n• Beginning the first spring training broadcast of each season with a reading from the\n\nSong of Solomon 2:11-12: \"For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;\n\nthe flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the\n\nvoice of the turtle[dove] is heard in our land;\"\n\nSources\n\nHarwell, Ernie.
