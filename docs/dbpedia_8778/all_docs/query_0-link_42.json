Now in his seventh year on Rocky Top, he earned a promotion to his current role as assistant coach in July 2024.\n\nWith Lentz on staff, Tennessee owns a 145-57 (.718) record, an SEC regular season title (2024), an SEC Tournament crown (2022) and four AP top-20 finishes. The Volunteers have played in all five NCAA Tournaments since his hire, thrice advancing to the Sweet 16, including earning an Elite Eight bid in 2024.\n\nIn addition, Lentz has helped tutor eight Volunteers who went on to become NBA Draft choices. Four of those individuals were selected in the first round.\n\nLentz came to Tennessee following four seasons as an assistant coach at Appalachian State University, from 2014-18. Prior to that, Lentz spent four years as a special assistant/video coordinator on Barnes’ staff at Texas, where he was involved in all aspects of internal operations within the Longhorns program. During his Texas tenure, 2010-14, the Longhorns compiled an 88-51 (.633) record, made three NCAA Tournament trips and earned one AP top-10 finish.\n\n“I’ve known Bryan for a long time,” Barnes said upon Lentz’s hire at Tennessee. “He was with us at Texas and he did an outstanding job. Then he took an opportunity at Appalachian State and was great there, as well. When this position opened up, I immediately knew Bryan would be an ideal fit.”\n\nLentz began his coaching career working for nine years, 2001-10, alongside his father, legendary Lenoir-Rhyne University—it was a college until 2008—head coach John Lentz. During that stretch, the Bears won five South Atlantic Conference regular season titles and one SAC Tournament title, as well as made five NCAA Division II Tournament appearances. In his final two seasons with the Bears, 2008-10, Lentz served as the team’s associate head coach.\n\nA four-year letter winner at Lenoir-Rhyne, which is also Barnes’ alma mater, Lentz finished his collegiate playing career with 1,374 points and ranked fifth in school history in assists (388), steals (159) and free-throw percentage (.824). He was named South Atlantic Conference Freshman of the Year in 1996-97 and earned second-team All-SAC honors as a sophomore in 1997-98.\n\nLentz, who hails from Hickory, N.C., the same hometown as Barnes, earned his bachelor’s degree in sports management from Lenoir-Rhyne in 2000. He and his wife, Christy, have two sons, Luke and Owen."
