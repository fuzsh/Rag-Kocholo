Keegan DeWitt is set to hit the road with Madi Diaz next month for a 10-date run of the midwest and west coast. The tour will launch at the Old Rock House in St. Louis, MO, on August 10th and wrap up at the Space in Evanston, IL, on September 2nd, and includes a show at the Hotel Café in Los Angeles, CA, on August 25th. DeWitt, whose excellent new Daytrotter session debuted online recently, will also perform at the final date of the site’s upcoming Barnstormer 5 Tour at Codfish Hollow Barn in Maquoketa, IA, on September 3rd. Later that month, he will play the Mercy Lounge in his current hometown of Nashville, TN, on the 23rd as part of the Soundland Festival. All dates will be with DeWitt’s full band and they will head out with Diaz again in October for an east coast tour.

DeWitt will have a new limited edition tour sampler available exclusively at each show. The sampler will include new song “Wishing Well” in addition to tracks from his summer 2010 release the Nothing Shows EP, his December Two Hearts/Reluctance single, and “Thunder Clatter,” released as a free download around his dates on April’s Daytrotter Barnstormer 4 tour. A full track listing is below. A limited edition tour poster will be sold only at each stop as well, and with purchase includes a 3-song download of: DeWitt’s “Wild Heart” cover, featuring Diaz; Diaz’s “Put Our Kiss Together (Wild Cub Remix)”; and a second new song “Holding On,” written together and sung by Diaz.

DeWitt, who was named one of Paste’s ’10 Best New Solo Artists of 2010,’ wrapped up a tour with Jeremy Messersmith last month.
