        "text": "Who We ARE\n\nCarter G. Woodson School’s visionary founding member is Attorney Hazel Mack. Attorney Mack, a Winston-Salem native, has dedicated her life to the service of others. Since her teenage years, Attorney Mack has served the less fortunate. She was a practicing attorney for 35 years with a non-profit law firm, where she focused on providing legal service to poor clients. Even while being a busy practicing attorney, Attorney Mack is a mother. She intimately understands the frustration that many parents feel when trying to find the best educational opportunities for their children.\n\nAttorney Mack is the founding parent of Carter G. Woodson School because she wanted choices for her daughter in Winston-Salem, NC. The Carter G. Woodson School arose from the hopes, dreams, frustrations, and determination of Attorney Mack and a group of ordinary people in Forsyth County, North Carolina; who were profoundly concerned about the future welfare and well-being of their children.\n\nTaking to heart the African proverb, “it takes a whole village to raise a child,” they worked to collaborate on ways they could create a new educational model that would honor the unique capabilities of their daughters and sons. In the summer of 1997, construction began, and the Carter G. Woodson School opened in fall 1997 with 175 students.\n\nThe legacy of Dr. Carter G. Woodson\n\nThe Father of Black History Month, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, was born in1875 near New Canton, VA. He was the son of former slaves. In 1907, he obtained his BA degree from the University of Chicago. In 1912, he received his PhD from Harvard University.\n\nIn 1915, he and friends established the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. A year later, the Journal of Negro History, began quarterly publication. In 1926, Woodson proposed and launched the annual February observance of “Negro History Week,” which became “Black History Month” in 1976. It is said that he chose February for the observance because February 12th was Abraham Lincoln’s birthday and February 14th was the accepted birthday of Frederick Douglass.\n\nDr. Woodson was the founder of Associated Publishers, the founder and editor of the Negro History Bulletin, and the author of more than 30 books. His best known publication is The Mis-Education of the Negro, originally published in 1933 and still pertinent today.\n\nWoodsonmuseum.org. (2018). About Us.
