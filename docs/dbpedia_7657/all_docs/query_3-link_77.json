As early as 1940s, blacks in West Virginia, a state where Woodson often spoke, began to celebrate February as Negro History Month.\" This one-page history tells the story of how and why Dr. Woodson formed the Association of the Study of Negro Life and History as well as the annual Negro History Week.\n\nBiography: Carter G. Woodson4 stars\n\n\"One of the first African Americans to receive a doctorate from Harvard, Woodson dedicated his career to the field of African-American history and lobbied extensively to establish Black History Month as a nationwide institution. He also wrote many historical works, including the 1933 book The Mis-Education of the Negro.\" Visit for a short video biography of Dr. Woodson as well as a two-page article about his life and accomplishments.\n\nGoodreads: Carter G.

Woodson4 stars\n\n\"During his lifetime, Dr. Woodson developed an important philosophy of history. History, he insisted, was not the mere gathering of facts.
