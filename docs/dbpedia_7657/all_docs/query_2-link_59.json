Wabash Ave. He also served as the director of the Wabash YMCA in Chicago.\n\n18. Sources say that Carter G. Woodson was inspired by John Cromwell’s book, The Negro in American History: Men and Women Eminent in the Evolution of the American of African Descent. In 1921, Cromwell became the first Black CPA.\n\n19. In October 1915, the ASNLH was incorporated in Washington, D.C. This is currently the headquarters for Woodson’s work. Every year, the organization assigns a theme for Black History Month. The theme for 2022 is “Black Health and Wellness.” The association is committed to focusing on the work of medical practitioners and health care providers.\n\n21.
