        "text": "Carter Woodson, a born scholar, went on to work as a teacher and principal at his old high school. He left in 1903 and taught in the Philippines until 1907. During the next few years, he traveled Europe and Asia, learning several languages and studying in Paris. Dr. Woodson returned to the United States to study history at the University of Chicago, graduating in 1908. His increasing interest in history led him to Harvard University, where he graduated with a doctorate in 1912. Dr. Woodson was the second African-American to receive a doctorate from Harvard.\n\nThroughout Dr. Woodson's education and teaching career, he found that the history of African Americans was being ignored. To remedy this, he began the \"Association for the Study of Negro Life and History\" in 1915.\n\nWoodson lobbied schools and organizations to participate in Negro History Week, which began in February 1926. This week was later expanded and renamed Black History Month.\n\nCourtesy: National Archives"
