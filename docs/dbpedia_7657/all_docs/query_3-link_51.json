        "text": "The Torch is Ours\n\nWe are assembled here, today, members and followers of the Association founded thirty-five years ago. As the outgrowth of the great thought conceived in the fertile mind of Carter Godwin Woodson  eminent scholar and great American  who came up from the coal mines of West Virginia, and the border country of old Berea College, through the classic halls of Harvard, in preparation for his great service.\n\nThe unfolding of his ideas  the implementation of his ideas  during these thirty-five years, has not been an easy task. The road has been very rugged. The awakening of the darker peoples of America and the world, to the importance of an historic knowledge of their backgrounds, has called for unshakable faith and persistence and unflinching sacrifice.\n\nThe results of Carter Woodsons efforts and of those who have journeyed with him over this rugged road, have vindicated the soundness of his thinking. These results are established in the factual findings of this Association, as they come into increasing use in institutions of learning, and among scholars and students of social progress all over the world. These results demonstrate the necessity for the vigorous and continued growth of this organization, the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, which stands, today, as the Master Key to the background of the world of color.\n\nMy heart and my mind are deeply moved by the memory of Carter Woodson  an American of my own age and generation  who came from the same plain people, close to the soil; who spent his life unearthing and recording the proud and stimulating story of their heritage, for the inspiration of present and future generations, and as a guide to contemporary living.\n\nHis was a great, humanitarian task, nobly and unselfishly undertaken; sturdily and effectively performed. But it was a continuing task. It was the kind of task initiated by great minds which they, themselves, may never hope to see completed  a task which must be left for fulfillment to succeeding generations of workers, lighted on their way by brightly burning fires, kindles from the torch of the leader.\n\nWhen Carter Woodson passed on, last April, he left behind the strongly burning torch of his hard-won and ever-increasing knowledge of our past, and his courage and steadfastness in adhering to the truth. He struck that torch high into the crevice of between the rock of prejudice and discrimination  a crevice forced by the growing pressure of the facts assembled and sent far and wide by this Association. It was forced by the strength of the facts that have given to us who are of Negro origin, a firm foundation of pride in a past which has contributed greatly to the forward march of civilization. It was forced by the strength of the facts that have opened in a new respect the eyes of many who have scorned or pitied us as a people without a past save that of savagery and slavery.\n\nSo, as we gather here, today, in our first annual meeting held without his stimulating presence, let us put our minds to the task of keeping his torch forever burning  an eternal light moving ever higher for all men to see  finding and inscribing for history the records of a race; lighting the path to the future with the incentive of a racial heritage of our high achievement. This must be the measure of our devotion to the shining spirit of our leader who has placed his torch and has gone before  to rest.\n\nHis Association  the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History  will not fail to take up the challenge of that flaming torch. The great fraternity of its membership and friends will not fail. I know that all who are of it stand ready, today, to step forward in support of the cause to which Carter Woodson dedicated and gave his life.\n\nLet us thank God for him today, as we close ranks and move forward to take our next step with the might of established facts behind us  ever-searching out new and worthy accomplishments from the dark recesses of time; ever recording what is of great merit in our contemporary life that slips away so swiftly, to become history with the passing of the hours.\n\nWe must relight our own torches from Carter Woodsons bright flame, and continue the search for the sustaining truth; continue to spread the truth far and near, until we, in our turn, shall pass his saving light, undimmed, into the waiting hands of posterity.\n\n-- Mary McLeod Bethune"
