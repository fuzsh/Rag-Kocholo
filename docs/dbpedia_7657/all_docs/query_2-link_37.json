But how did this celebration come to be — and why does it happen in February? Let’s go back to the beginning to find out.\n\n“Those who have no record of what their forebears have accomplished lose the inspiration which comes from the teaching of biography and history.”\n\nCarter G. Woodson is considered a pioneer in the study of African-American history. He is given much of the credit for Black History Month, and rightly so.\n\nWoodson was the son of former slaves, born in December 1875 in Virginia. His parents could neither read nor write. However Woodson hungered for knowledge. As one of a large, poor family, he had to help on the farm instead of attend much of the school term. It didn’t stop him. He was largely self-taught and mastered the fundamentals of school subjects by the time he was 17. He ultimately graduated from high school and went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in Literature from Berea College in Kentucky. He studied at the Sorbonne University in Paris and earned his master’s degree from the University of Chicago and his Ph.D. in history from Harvard.\n\nHe worked as a miner, a high school teacher and principal while earning his various degrees.\n\nWoodson wanted Black Americans to know their history and what their ancestors contributed to American history. He wanted Black Americans to be proud of their heritage and he wanted all Americans to understand it and accept it. Ultimately, he wanted Black history to be taught as an integral part of American history.\n\nHe developed an important philosophy of history. History was not the mere gathering of facts. The object of historical study is to arrive at a reasonable interpretation of the facts. It must include some description of the social conditions of the period being studied. And so Woodson’s work did just that. He and friends established the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. In 1916, he created the Journal of Negro History. In 1926, he started Negro History Week, which, in 1976, expanded into Black History Month.\n\nWoodson chose the second week of February for his celebration because it marked the birthdays of two men who greatly influenced Black history: Frederick Douglas and President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nDr. Woodson was an educator, author, journalist, publisher and historian. He died on April 3, 1950, having inspired many to carry on his life’s work."
