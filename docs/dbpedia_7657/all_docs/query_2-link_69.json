        "text": "Carter G. Woodsonâs achievement is even more extraordinary since he did not begin his formal education until age 20, however, through self-instruction, he had been able to master most school subjects. Woodson became convinced that the role of black people in American history and in the history of other cultures was being ignored or misrepresented among scholars. Furthermore, Woodson realized the need for research into the neglected past of African Americans. The foremost professional organization for the study of American History, The American Historical Association, had no interest in Black History at the time. Woodson noted that although he was a dues-paying member of the American Historical Association, he was not even allowed to attend conferences. Woodson became convinced that to work as a Black historian would require creating a structure that would make it possible for Black scholars to study history.\n\nThe story of Black History Month begins in Chicago during the summer of 1915 when thousands of African Americans travelled from across the country to see exhibits highlighting the progress black people had made since the end of slavery. Afterwards, Woodson and others formed The Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH). He hoped that others would popularize the findings that he and other black intellectuals would publish in The Journal of Negro History, which he established in 1916. As early as 1920, Woodson urged black civic organizations to promote the achievements that researchers were uncovering. In 1924, his Omega Psi Phi Fraternity brothers responded with the creation of Negro History and Literature Week, which they renamed Negro Achievement Week. In February of 1926, Woodson sent out a press release to the nation announcing Negro History Week. Over the years, Negro History Week has evolved into Black History Month"
