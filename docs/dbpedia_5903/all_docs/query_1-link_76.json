        "text": "The rabbit was born on May 7, according to its owner, Yuko Sugimoto, in the town of Namie, which is just outside the 18-mile exclusion zone that has been imposed around the crippled plant. The town has, however, been identified as a radiation hot-spot.\n\n\"I have been raising rabbits for more than 10 years and this is the first time something like this has happened,\" Ms Sugimoto told the weekly magazine Flash.\n\nAs well as having no ears, the rabbit also appears to have clear signs of albinism - a pure white coat and red eyes - that are the result of mutations in several genes.\n\nOutwardly, the rabbit appears to be healthy and video footage posted on YouTube shows it eating vegetables in an enclosure, although the owner said she has since stopped eating locally grown produce.\n\nSome experts have dismissed a link between the deformed rabbit and the radiation released after the March 11 tsunami wrecked the nuclear plant, with some pointing out that animals are occasionally born with deformities and mother rabbits have been known to chew off the ears of their young through over-enthusiastic grooming.\n\nImages of the rabbit have inevitably caused concern in Japan, however, and coincide uncomfortably with the announcement by Tokyo Electric Power Co.\n\nthat levels of radioactive strontium around 240 times the legal limit have been detected in samples of sea water taken close to the plant, 150 miles north of Tokyo.\n\nStrontium, which accumulates in bones and has been linked to bone cancer and leukemia, has also been found in groundwater near two of the damaged reactors. Previously, Tepco confirmed that traces of plutonium and radioactive iodine had been released into the atmosphere from the plant."
