Hopefully those red stripes are just player colour, and therefore variable.\n\nSupremacy next, please. Nobody cares about space hippy traitors.\n\nJust kidding!\n\nThe only thing they said about colors is:\n\nWe looked at a lot of images from our modern military when designing the units for Purity. We were able to use this pretty effectively for Purity because the tan and dirt-like colors emphasize the Affinity&#8217;s attachment to Earth.\n\nSo I am betting that yes, the red stripes are a faction specific color. But I found this tidbit interesting:\n\nFloating tanks look more like floating fortresses. They move slowly, but they don&#8217;t suffer from the same environmental move penalties of a typical ground unit. Your enemy will not see a more terrifying sight than an army of floating tanks crossing the ocean.\n\nSo now I can have a strong army and navy at the same time! Amphibious invasions have never been easier and for any would be James Camerons out there, I am pretty sure that tank is arrow-proof.\n\nLiex\n\nKing\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 27, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n940\n\nLocation\n\nBrasil\n\nMay 16, 2014\n\n#5\n\nThat's amazing! Those units models would make great action figures. I want a mini floating cavalry!\n\nAlso, is the cavalry line = tank line?\n\nGa1Friday\n\n2K Community Manager\n\nJoined\n\nApr 2, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n76\n\nLocation\n\nNovato, CA\n\nMay 16, 2014\n\n#6\n\nLove the unit designs.\n\nWhat are we going to see next?

Likely xeno monstrosities for Harmony, and maybe sleek mechs for Supremacy. Though an earlier screenshot did show Supremacists fielding tank-like cavalry at, I'm guessing again, level 2.\n\nThere's a drastic shift in style between levels 2 and 3, which might hint at a major mid-game defining event, affinity-wise.\n\nEagle Pursuit\n\nPer Scribendum, Volo\n\nJoined\n\nAug 12, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n17,170\n\nMay 16, 2014\n\n#9\n\nI'm guessing that's the case, and also that it's named \"cavalry\" to encompass whatever the other affinities will field in the same category.

Submarines, lighter vehicles, air transports, maybe specialized infantry and affinity units unique beyond appearance and under-the-hood upgrades.\n\nKarl0413\n\nPrince\n\nJoined\n\nApr 24, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n554\n\nMay 16, 2014\n\n#12\n\nI did not expect to see those images in the thread so quickly!
