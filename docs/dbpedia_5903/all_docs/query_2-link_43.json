        "text": "Heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) is an ancient eukaryotic transcription factor that adjusts the cellular proteostasis system to changing stress loads by inducing the expression of a large set of genes (Morimoto, 1998; Åkerfelt et al., 2010). During acute heat shock, unfolded proteins accumulate in the cell resulting in the rapid and transient activation of Hsf1 that counteracts the harmful proteotoxic effects by inducing the expression of protective chaperones and aggregation factors (Richter et al., 2010). This core heat shock response (HSR) is a conserved transcriptional program that depends on the induced binding of Hsf1 as a trimer to promoters that harbour heat-shock elements (HSEs) (Sorger and Nelson, 1989; Sorger and Pelham, 1987; Wiederrecht et al., 1987). The target promoters also receive signals from other stress-induced pathways (Verghese et al., 2012). In budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the metabolic-stress transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 (Msn2/4) associate with stress-response elements (STREs) present within many Hsf1 target promoters, leading to an expanded HSR that integrate stress-induced metabolic and proteostatic perturbations (Gasch et al., 2000; Martínez-Pastor et al., 1996; Schmitt and McEntee, 1996).\n\nRegulation of Hsf1 activity to match the cellular load of unfolded proteins is central for maintaining proteostasis. In mammals, Hsf1 is kept latent by multiple layers of regulation, including cytosolic sequestration and monomerization, and stress triggers activation via nuclear targeting and induced DNA-binding (Li et al., 2017). Yeast Hsf1 is subject to more fundamental regulation and resides in the nucleus and is responsible for both basal and stress-induced gene expression (Jakobsen and Pelham, 1988; Solís et al., 2016; Wiederrecht et al., 1988). Hsf1 is considered to be regulated by a titratable chaperone repressor according to a model originally adapted from bacteria (Craig and Gross, 1991). Accordingly, chaperones bind and repress Hsf1 and are titrated away by unfolded or misfolded proteins under stress conditions. The chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90 have been implicated in the regulation of Hsf1 (Abravaya et al., 1992; Bonner et al., 2000; Zou et al., 1998). Recently evidence from the yeast model has been presented to support the notion that Hsp70 directly regulates Hsf1 as a titratable repressor (Krakowiak et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2016). First, Hsp70 (Ssa1 and Ssa2) binds Hsf1 and this association is transiently decreased by heat shock. Second, overexpression of Hsp70 (Ssa2) together with its J-domain cochaperone Ydj1 attenuates Hsf1 activity. Finally, eliminating transcriptional induction of Hsp70 as part of the HSR results in prolonged Hsf1-activation following heat-shock. A peptide in the CE2 subdomain of Hsf1 has been implicated as an important regulatory site for the association of the Hsp70 repressor (Høj and Jakobsen, 1994; Jakobsen and Pelham, 1991; Krakowiak et al., 2018). Thus, Hsp70 functions as the titratable chaperone repressor of Hsf1.\n\nA simple scenario that explains chaperone titration is based on the direct competition between Hsf1 and substrates for binding to the Hsp70 substrate-binding domain (SBD). Hsp70 transiently associates with hydrophobic peptides of unfolded and misfolded proteins via its SBD (Rüdiger et al., 1997). Initially, substrates weakly associate with the SBDβ of ATP-bound Hsp70 and induce ATP hydrolysis and then become trapped by the closing SBDα lid subdomain (Mayer and Bukau, 2005). Substrates in the cytosol are released by nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) of the Hsp110 (Sse1 and Sse2) and armadillo (Fes1) classes that accelerate the exchange of ADP for ATP and thereby trigger opening of the SBD (Bracher and Verghese, 2015). Fes1 employs a specialized release domain (RD) to enable the efficient dissociation of persistent Hsp70 substrates such as misfolded proteins (Gowda et al., 2018). Notably, fes1Δ cells exhibit strong constitutive activation of Hsf1 suggesting that this NEF is involved in Hsf1 latency regulation at the level of substrate release from Hsp70 (Gowda et al., 2013; Gowda et al., 2018). Yet presently it is unclear whether Hsp70 handles Hsf1 as a canonical substrate and how NEFs influence the interactions. Moreover, the compartmentalized proteostasis system presents a spatial arrangement of significance for the chaperone titration model since both latent and transcriptionally active Hsf1 resides in the nucleus, while the bulk of its titratable negative regulator Hsp70, including the NEFs, are cytosolic and interact with newly translated proteins (Morán Luengo et al., 2019; Sorger, 1991).\n\nIn this study, we reconstitute the Hsf1-Hsp70 interaction and isolate activation complexes that bind HSEs and are negatively regulated by excess Hsp70. Hsp70 binds Hsf1 via its canonical SBD providing direct support for the model of direct competition between chaperone substrates and Hsf1. During heat shock, these activating substrates are derived from the misfolding of cytosolic translation products. Unleashing Hsf1 from Hsp70 control reveals a cryptic hyper-stress program with a widely broadened gene-target signature and much amplified transcriptional effects. Thus, our data provides mechanistic insight into how Hsf1 activity is regulated by Hsp70 to modify the HSR regulon.\n\nWe have summarized our current understanding of Hsf1 regulation in Figure 7. Accordingly, under non-stressful conditions the lion share of constitutively trimerized Hsf1 is organized in nuclear latency complexes in which Hsp70 restricts the transcription factor from binding HSEs. Hsp70 dynamically engages the latency complexes via its canonical SBD. Under stress conditions, the pool of available Hsp70 decreases as a result of chaperone titration by the accumulation of aggregating misfolded chaperone substrate proteins. The decreased availability of Hsp70 transforms Hsf1 latency complexes into 600–700 kDa activation complexes that bind HSEs and activate transcription. The main source of titrating substrate proteins during heat shock are newly translated polypeptides. Under hyper-stress conditions, protein misfolding and aggregation become wide-spread and protein aggregates sequester Hsp70. Consequently, Hsf1 is unleashed from Hsp70 latency control. The much-increased levels of active Hsf1 promote the occupancy of HSEs, including low-affinity HSEs (HSEL), thus triggering a hyper-stress transcriptional program with a wide target signature and much increased transcriptional amplitude. Our data support a model where the nuclear pool of available Hsp70 tightly controls Hsf1 DNA-binding capacity and represses a genetic emergency program that is triggered by proteostasis collapse.\n\nFigure 7\n\nOur model is based on the nuclear localization of Hsf1 and the subcompartmentalized organization of the proteostasis system in the cytosol and nucleus as autonomous but still communicating pools. Experimentally, support of such autonomy was obtained by the finding that expression of the cytosolic NEF Sse1 in the nucleus triggers strong activation of Hsf1. Such strong deregulation of Hsf1 suggests that the nuclear and cytosolic Hsp70 pools are not immediately exchangeable via trafficking through the nuclear pores. Nevertheless, we find evidence for communication between the cytosol and nucleus. Newly translated proteins, which are produced in the cytosol are potent activators of Hsf1 when they misfold and similarly, impairing the release of persistent misfolded substrates from Hsp70 in the cytosol (fes1Δ) results in strong activation of Hsf1. Thus, the nucleus and cytosol communicate in the regulation of Hsf1, which likely involves transfer of Hsp70 and its substrates between the cytosol to the nucleus. Indeed, certain proteins that misfolded in the cytosol have been shown to target the nucleus where they are compartmentalized en route proteasomal degradation (Finley et al., 2012; Gardner et al., 2005; Park et al., 2013; Prasad et al., 2010; Prasad et al., 2018; Samant et al., 2018). Interestingly, the J-domain protein Sis1 is an important factor for the nuclear targeting of misfolded proteins suggesting that this Hsp70 co-chaperone is directly involved in Hsf1 regulation by delivering the titrating substrates to the nuclear Hsp70 pool (Gardner et al., 2005; Prasad et al., 2010) The implication of our data is that the regulation of Hsf1 latency relies on the compartmentalization of the proteostasis system between the cytosol and the nucleus. Nevertheless, the subcellular site(s) of Hsp70 titration by misfolded proteins remains to be determined. Upon mild heat shock we observe that half of the soluble Hsp70 (Ssa1) population is transferred to the aggregate fraction and under Hsf1 hyper-induction conditions (heat shocked fes1Δ cells) only 10% of the population remains soluble. Thus, the extent of the effect shows that the soluble pool of Hsp70 is titrated globally in the cell under Hsf1-inducing conditions.\n\nOur reconstitution experiments show that Hsf1 and Hsp70 are sufficient components to form an ATP-sensitive activation complex that is competent of binding HSEs. The estimated size of the complex of 600–700 kDa and the Hsf1-Hsp70 stoichiometry of 3:1 is not readily compatible with a single trimer of Hsf1 in complex with one Hsp70 (Hsf1 = 93 kDa; Hsp70 = 70 kDa: 3 × 93 kDa + 70 kDa = 349 kDa). Instead the size fits better with two Hsf1 trimers each carrying a single Hsp70 (6 × 93 kDa + 2 × 70 kDa=698 kDa). Hsf1 has previously been observed to form oligomers larger than trimers that may correspond to hexamers (Sorger and Nelson, 1989). Supplementing it with an excess of free Hsp70 impedes HSE binding. In light of the DNA-binding activity of the 600–700 kDa complex and our finding that dissociation of this complex by ATP does not result in increased binding of HSEs, we consider this complex to be the transcriptionally active form of Hsf1. Consistent with this notion, >669 kDa Hsf1-HSE complexes derived from yeast-cell-free lysates migrate slower on gels when mixed with Hsp70 antibodies and this effect is attenuated by ATP (Bonner et al., 1994). Similarly, Hsf1 complexes > 670 kDa have been observed in lysates derived from Drosophila and human cells (Clos et al., 1993; Westwood et al., 1991). Neither these studies nor our reconstitution address whether other proteins than Hsf1 and Hsp70 are present in the cellular activation complexes. At present, we can rule out that the J-domain protein Sis1 is a stable constituent of the complexes since we co-expressed it with Hsp70 and Hsf1 and still it did not co-purify with the activation complexes. Our in vitro data show that an excess of free Hsp70 pushes the activation complexes into latency complexes that are unable to bind HSEs. In vivo crosslinking shows that Hsp70 binds Hsf1 directly via its SBDβ and that this interaction weakens when cells are heat shocked or stressed by the buildup of misfolded proteins (AzC and fes1Δ). Addition of ATP to the EMSA assays did not efficiently hinder formation of the latency complexes. We do not favor the interpretation that Hsp70-ATP binds Hsf1, rather we consider that the EMSA assay relies on a gel electrophoresis step that rapidly depletes free Mg2+ and ATP and thereby enables binding of Hsp70-ADP early during gel running. Thus, the regulatory interactions between Hsp70 and Hsf1 depend on the intrinsic Hsp70 ATPase cycle. We consider that these dynamics are central for cellular titration of the Hsp70 chaperone repressor and also explains why we obtain an activation complex rather than a latency complex when purifying Hsf1-Hsp70 from E. coli. Previous studies highlight the hydrophobic CE2 motif of Hsf1 as an important site for latency regulation (Høj and Jakobsen, 1994; Jakobsen and Pelham, 1991; Krakowiak et al., 2018). Hsp70 occupancy of this and other binding sites may represent the difference between the activation and latency complexes. In support of this notion, a just published study identified an additional negative regulatory Hsp70 binding site in the N-terminal activation domain of Hsf1 (Peffer et al., 2019). Interestingly, the N-terminal activation domain has recently been implicated in regulating the DNA binding activity of Hsf1 (Krakowiak et al., 2018). Together with our data these findings suggest that multiple Hsp70-binding sites control Hsf1 affinity for DNA. Independent of the exact regulatory Hsp70-bindings sites, chaperone titration should be understood in the context of complexes between trimeric Hsf1 and multiple Hsp70s.\n\nThe chaperone repression titration model raises questions regarding what protein species functions as the stress sensor. Our finding that Hsf1 engages the canonical Hsp70 SBD indicates that the transcription factor in principle competes with any Hsp70 substrate. Newly synthesized proteins are strong candidates as the stress sensors and that upon their misfolding will function as Hsp70 titrating agents. This notion is supported by our observation that inactivation of Fes1, a cytosolic NEF that specifically releases misfolded proteins from Hsp70, triggers unsurpassed activation of Hsf1 (Gowda et al., 2016; Gowda et al., 2013; Gowda et al., 2018). Furthermore, blocking translation at either the initiation or elongation step diminishes Hsf1 activation in response to heat shock. In the same line, inducing misfolding of newly synthesized proteins using the proline analogue AzC activates Hsf1 and triggers synergistic potentiation when combined with heat shock. The notion that newly translated proteins are stress sensors also gains support from literature. Furthermore, it is known that newly translated proteins readily misfolds by stress. Specifically, heat shock leads to increased degradation of newly synthesized but not of long-lived cytosolic proteins and formation of aggregates decorated by Hsp104 requires ongoing translation (Medicherla and Goldberg, 2008; Zhou et al., 2014). In light of this data it is interesting to consider what kind of newly translated proteins functions as the stress sensors for Hsf1 latency regulation. Organellar and secretory proteins are prime candidates. Many are synthesized in the cytosol and are maintained in unstructured conformations by Hsp70 until they are translocated over membranes into the organelles. Consistent with the notion that these species misfold in the cytosol and regulate Hsf1, stress specific to the ER has been reported to activate Hsf1 likely as a result of hampered protein translocation (Liu and Chang, 2008). Similarly, mutations in the tail-anchored pathway activates Hsf1 (Brandman et al., 2012; Schuldiner et al., 2008). Another candidate class of Hsp70 titrating proteins is the ribosomal proteins and support for their involvement in Hsf1 activation has recently been obtained by experimentally impairing ribosome biogenesis (Albert et al., 2019; Tye et al., 2019). On the biochemical level, the amyloid forming peptide aβ42 that is derived from a transmembrane domain has recently been shown to decrease the interaction between Hsp70 and Hsf1 (Zheng et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the actual contribution of a newly translated polypeptide to Hsf1 activation will depend on how well it titrates Hsp70. This in turn is affected by a multitude of characteristics including how fast the protein folds, how chaperones impact on the folding process, how the folding is affected by the stressor, how aggregation-prone the protein is and how the misfolded species interact with Hsp70. In the end, it is likely that a plethora of different proteins function in concert to regulate Hsf1 latency via Hsp70 titration.\n\nOur transcriptional data show that yeast cells accommodate a cryptic genetic hyper-stress program that upon activation involves a widely broadened gene-target signature and much amplified transcriptional effects. The finding shows that in WT cells the bulk of Hsf1 is maintained latent under non-stressful conditions as well as after heat shock. A simple mechanistic interpretation to explain the induction of this hyper-stress program is that the increased concentration of Hsf1 activation complexes results in intensified occupancy of HSEs, including low affinity and obstructed sites (Erkine et al., 1999; Giardina and Lis, 1995; Santoro et al., 1998). This interpretation explains both the broadened gene-target signature and the much-amplified transcriptional effects. Interestingly, the activation of a cryptic Hsf1 hyper-stress program in yeast is reminiscent of the induction of non-canonical and distinct genetic programs elicited by Hsf1 in cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (Mendillo et al., 2012; Scherz-Shouval et al., 2014). Specifically, the cells employ Hsf1 to induce specific oncogenic and malignancy genes that are distinct from the classical HSR target genes. Despite that the here identified hyper-stress program in yeast involves other gene targets than the mammalian programs, we speculate that the fundamental mechanism of chaperone titration may underlie the expanded Hsf1 regulons in both yeast and cancers. Accordingly, like in the yeast model also mammalian cells harbor a large pool of latent Hsf1 that can become mobilized by the accumulation of persistent misfolded proteins that are associated with the malignant phenotype. This increased pool of constitutively active Hsf1 allows it to reach normally inaccessible genes and together with other transcription factors and chromatin modifiers to induce alternative regulons. To summarize our conceptual contribution, we find that an apparently simple chaperone-titration mechanism can produce diversified transcriptional outputs in response to distinct stress loads."
