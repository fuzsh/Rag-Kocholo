        "text": "About Nuclear Rabbit\n\nNuclear Rabbit is a California band, started in Novato. The band's music has been called metal, but incorporates a variety of other styles, making classification difficult. Known for its unusual sound and lyrics and bassist Jean Baudin's 11-string bass, Nuclear Rabbit has a large fan base despite being a perpetually underground and independent band. They are perhaps the most well known underground band in California, having bands like Papa Roach, Alien Ant Farm, and Deftones opening up for them."
