Adults and kids alike will enjoy a treat from Celine’s Sweets, or a scoop of refreshing handmade ice cream from the counter at La Michoacana.\n\nJust around the corner from Grant Avenue, don’t miss the iconic City Hall – a well known local landmark. It began life as a Presbyterian church in 1896 and became City Hall in 1963, three years after the city’s incorporation.\n\nThe Novato History Museum is also located in downtown Novato, next door to the Tourist Information Center on DeLong Avenue."
