        "text": "Day Use Fee\n\nParking is $8 per vehicle, payable by cash, check, or via smartphone with QR code at the parking lot.* No fee is charged if you borrow a free State Park pass from Novato or other public libraries.\n\nIf paying by cash, look for the yellow fee payment tube at the west end of the parking lot to deposit your payment. Our automated credit card machine is no longer available. Failure to pay fees may result in citation. *Smartphone $0.55 service fee applies, no discounts or refunds available for payment by phone.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nThe park overlooks the Petaluma River and San Pablo Bay from the east-facing slopes of 1,558 foot Mount Burdell.\n\nThe name \"olompali\" comes from the Miwok language and may be translated as \"southern village\" or \"southern people.\" The Coast Miwok inhabited at least one site within the area of the present-day park continuously from as early as 6,000 BC, until the early 1850s.\n\nOlompali contains \"kitchen rock,\" a large boulder used as a mortar in which early people ground acorns and seeds into a fine flour for food preparation. Many women would gather near such grinding rocks to prepare food and socialize.\n\nLocation-Directions\n\nThe park is accessible from both the Northbound and Southbound lanes of Highway 101. Exit at Atherton Ave./San Marin Dr. and follow posted directional signs to the park. The park address is 8901 Redwood Blvd., Novato.\n\nFacilities\n\nOlompali State Historic Park is open every day from 9:00am to 5:00pm. The gates to the park close promptly, so plan to return to your vehicle and exit the park by 5:00pm.\n\nVisitors will first encounter a picnic area surrounded by the historic Burdell mansion, gardens, and ranch facility. Adventurous visitors will enjoy the hiking and horseback riding trails. Dogs and bikes are prohibited on the park trails. Hike the lower hillside of Mt. Burdell on the 2.5 mile Miwok Loop Trail. Those venturing to the peak of Mt. Burdell will traverse approximately 9 miles round trip, depending on which portions of the loop trail are used. The peak of Mt. Burdell is 1558'. Remember when choosing to set out on a hike that park gate is closed proptly at 5pm. Mt. Burdell is also accessible via county open space trails from the San Marin area of Novato.\n\nCollecting or destroying anything in the park, including mushrooms, is prohibited.\n\nA project is underway to build several structures representative of a Coast Miwok village. The village will be used as an interpretive and educational site. Visitors to the park can see two kotchas (houses), made from redwood bark. There is also a nicely labeled native plant garden.\n\nSeasons, Climate, Recommended Clothing\n\nSummer is hot, spring is warm, and fall and winter can be cool. Layered clothing is best."
