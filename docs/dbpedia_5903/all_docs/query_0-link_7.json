        "text": "(2020 - Current) Los Angeles, CA\n\nSQUID PISSER was an idea that had been eagerly awaiting it's birth for well over a decade. The project began as a prolific and furious period of writing in Tommy's home studio during 2020.\n\nSeth Carolina (STARCRAWLER) joined shortly after to handle drum duties and the duo recorded 3 releases worth of material. \"My Tadpole Legion\" (Three One G), \"Vaporize a Neighbor\" (Skin Graft), and \"Dreams of Puke\" (Sweatband Records).\n\nNow a 5 piece, the band has teamed up with 33 and West and Atonal Agency for booking and are currently prepping to hit the road for extensive touring.\n\n​\n\nBand Members: Seth Carolina, Michael Armendariz, Corey Wolford, Kieran, and Tommy Meehan\n\n(2020 - Current) Los Angeles, CA\n\nWhat began as a shit talking session on conservative America between Meehan and Saint Anthony Mehlhaff in 2020, CANCER CHRIST has quickly become a fan favorite within the burgeoning Los Angeles punk scene and beyond. Live sermons include illegal use of a flamethrower, blood baptisms, fans dressed as nuns, tons of confetti, and lots and lots of Snake People.\n\nThe band put out 2 eps (The \"The Blood of Jesus\" and \"Satan is a Bitch\") and are currently awaiting the pressing of their debut full length LP (\"God is Violence\") out on Seeing Red Records and Sweatband Records. The group is slated to tour with EYEHATEGOD and **** later this year.\n\n​\n\nBand Members: Saint Anthony Mehlhaff, Snake Boss, Apocalypse Snake, Candy Snake, Diesel Snake, Piss Snake, Chain Snake, Missing Snake, Snake Babe, Snake Momma, and countless other Snake Boys...\n\n(2020 - 2023) Los Angeles, CA\n\nFormed by Brian Amalfitano and Justin Pearson in 2019, the band's first live performance took place opening up for THE MANX's \"Malibu Slime\" release show. Shortly after, the band asked Tommy to join as their guitar player.\n\nThe quintet ran several tours and went on to produce 3 releases (\"Productive Disruption\", \"The Wait\", and \"Bad Songs Forever\") before Tommy's departure in 2023.\n\n​\n\nBand Members: Justin Pearson, Brian Amalfitano, Scott Osment, Jason Klein, Colin Smith and Tommy Meehan\n\n​\n\n(2010 - 2020) Los Angeles, CA\n\nThis group of animation industry veterans ended up, essentially, creating their own genre defying genre. They called it GOO-CORE (the band would douse themselves in colorful goo before performances).\n\nComposing and arranging for accordion, custom electric banjo, mandolin hybrids, stand up bass and drums, forced the boys to think far outside the box with their song writing. The project toured the US, produced a ton of music videos, and even became the house band for a NICKELODEON television pilot (among countless other collaborations with members of bands like THE MELVINS, LOVELY LITTLE GIRLS, THE LOCUST, QUI, BLOOD BROTHERS and more...)\n\nWith 10 releases in 10 years, THE MANX were constantly experimenting with different sonic approaches, leaving behind a truly eclectic discography...\n\n​\n\nBand Members: Myke Chilian, Max Winston, Zach Zdziebko, Adam Barnes and Tommy Meehan\n\n(2009 - Current) Los Angeles, CA\n\nAn exercise in aural and performative disgust... Leaning heavily into noise and chaos through abuse of synthesizers, drum machines, guitar and vocals, CHUM OUT! was born of poverty and despair.\n\nThe band developed it's sound in a period of time when the duo was (figuratively and literally) constantly surrounded by cockroaches, rats, and lots of alcohol.\n\nCHUM OUT! have produced 6 dementedly experimental releases since 2009 and have played countless DIY noise bills throughout California (and one in Miami, FL).\n\n​\n\nBand Members: Jimmy Turner and Tommy Meehan\n\n(2003 - 2005) Novato CA\n\nOriginating in comic book form from notes passed back and forth in class at Novato High School, THE BROCKLY TACOS is a project rich with lore, story, and tons of characters. Led by \"The Fearless Pumpkin Warrior\" (Tommy Meehan) and \"Mr. Lego\", the band created their own cult of misfits and weirdos in the Northern California town of Novato California.\n\nThe band would regularly play shows at the famous PHOENIX THEATER in Petaluma, CA with some of their favorite bands like NUCLEAR RABBIT, HOSTILITY, HORSE THE BAND, and more.\n\nThe group released 4 strange albums rooted in oddly orchestrated metal and experimental stylings. Their final release (\"CHILD MAYONNAISE\") features a cameo from the late great DAVE BROCKIE of GWAR fame...\n\n​\n\nBand Members: Luis Briones, Gaelon Davis, Sean Cannon, Mike Rosario, Jesse Maxwell, Sam Hickerson, Jeremy Williams, and Tommy Meehan.\n\n(2006 - 2008) Los Angeles, CA\n\nAggressively odd and experimentally pissy, the band's spazzed out rhythms, deranged melodic sensibilities, grimy sonic textures, and psychotic vocal approaches garnered intrigue and attention in the hey day of MySpace.com.\n\nThe group played a handful of live shows in Los Angeles and went on to released 4 records.\n\nUltimately, Meehan experienced difficulty in finding musicians who could physically perform the parts that he was writing and when he fell into financial hardship in the late 2000's, the idea for executing a hardcore band of such musical ambition was shelved until the formation of SQUID PISSER almost 13 years later...\n\n​\n\nBand Members: Greg Atria, Drew Scott, Flanders Bayliss, Rusty Kennedy, Jimmy Turner, Corey Hebert, and Tommy Meehan\n\n(2004 ) Petaluma, CA\n\nAs a 3 piece instrumental band founded in aggressive slap bass, angular shred guitar, frenetic punk drums, and catchy little ditties, THE ZOMBIE SQUAD was the closest thing to a jam band that Meehan was ever involved in.\n\nThe trio would flow through several different musical themes within a given song. Building things up and and then removing all footing completely in order to introduce new motif after new motif.\n\nThe band was influenced largely by other Bay Area acts like BUCKETHEAD and NUCLEAR RABBIT. They released a single rehearsal demo tape called \"4 Songs of Death\" and played one show at The Phoenix Theater before disbanding.\n\n​\n\nBand Members: Bob Solden, \"Wiesel\", and Tommy Meehan\n\n(2003 - 2005) Petaluma, CA\n\nWhile in his teens, Tommy started frequenting The Phoenix Theater where local rock stars and teen sensations EXPOSURE seemed to always be opening up for bands that were touring through town.\n\nWhen the band needed a new guitar player, Tommy joined and the group wrote enough material for their first release together (\"Hi 5's and Handshakes\") in just a few months. A poppy, hard-rock and almost adult contemporary experiment in \"sophisticated\" music for Meehan, the band attracted a predominantly female fan base with songs like \"Table For One\" and \"Banana Hammock\".\n\n​\n\nBand Members: Brandon Hall, Ross Fernandez, Luis Briones, and Tommy Meehan"
