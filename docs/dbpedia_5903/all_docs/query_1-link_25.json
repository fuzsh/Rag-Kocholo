        "text": "Nuclear Rabbit\n\nNuclear Rabbit Zone\n\nFan account that I use to post Nuclear Rabbit songs, demos, and live performances that cannot be found on any other streaming services. Nuclear Rabbit is a California band, started in Novato. The band's music has been called metal, more specifically \"avant-garde\" metal, but incorporates a variety of other styles, making the classification even more difficult. Known for its unusual sound and the lyrics, as well as bassist Jean Baudin's 11-string bass. Nuclear Rabbit has a large fan base despite being a perpetually underground and independent band. They are arguably one of the most well known underground bands in California, having more mainstream bands like Papa Roach, Alien Ant Farm, and Deftones opening for them.\n\nNuclear Rabbitâs tracks\n\nInterlude by Nuclear Rabbit\n\npublished on 2023-11-09T15:45:36Z\n\nBirthworm by Nuclear Rabbit\n\npublished on 2023-11-09T15:08:20Z\n\nIntro by Nuclear Rabbit\n\npublished on 2023-11-09T15:08:01Z\n\nIncubus by Nuclear Rabbit\n\npublished on 2023-11-09T14:59:55Z\n\nBarbie Comein by Nuclear Rabbit\n\npublished on 2023-11-09T02:29:05Z\n\nToo Much Funk by Nuclear Rabbit\n\npublished on 2023-11-09T02:28:27Z\n\nOne (Live) by Nuclear Rabbit\n\npublished on 2023-11-08T19:20:50Z\n\nEenie Meenie by Nuclear Rabbit\n\npublished on 2023-11-08T18:33:12Z\n\nGalaxy Hoppin' Ranch Hands by Nuclear Rabbit\n\npublished on 2023-11-08T18:32:59Z\n\nIntro/Birthworm by Nuclear Rabbit\n\npublished on 2023-11-08T18:32:29Z"
