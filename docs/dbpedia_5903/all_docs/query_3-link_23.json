        "text": "VC Novato is where it all began. Visual Concepts (and the legendary NBA 2K franchise) was born in a small office above a Novato Bank. Thirty five years later, the VC Novato studio operates from a massive, converted airplane hangar in gorgeous Marin County, California. The studio houses gaming legends withÂ incredible industry knowledge alongside passionate newcomers who bring cutting edge expertise in everything from computer vision and machine learning to deep infrastructure and network optimization.\n\nVC Novato is a fun place to work, with classic arcade games, a state-of-the-art gym, on-site massages, fully stocked fridges, and more. Going outside is fun, too! The gorgeous campus sports bocce ball, a turf volleyball court, a dog park, and an accessible walking trail.\n\nSituated between the hustle and bustle of San Francisco and the rolling vineyards of Wine Country, VC Novato's location is perfect for fun-filled team getaways and celebratory off-sites.\n\nMarin County is known for its stunning redwoods, bayside restaurants, and Mt. Tamalpais State Park, but the Bay Area as a whole offers some of the best eateries, entertainment, and views youâll find anywhere in the world. And whether you choose to settle down in San Francisco, Marin County, or the East Bay, there are ample public transportation options, including rail transit and ferry services.\n\nMeet our VP of Talent Acquisition, Nicola Smith! A British import to Novato, CA, Nicola is responsible for all talent strategy at Visual Concepts, and itâs a job she performs with boundless energy.\n\nWhen sheâs not guiding the TA team, youâll find her hiking the hills of Novato and playing with her excellent pup, Toto. Nicola is also dedicated to and works in womenâs health and health awareness. About VC, she says: \"Great games are truly made by great people. VC is like a big family. Everyone cares, and everyone has a voice. That means so much to me.\"\n\nEmployees enjoy a variety of benefits and perks while working at VC.Â While these benefits and perks vary by location, the list below highlights some of the many amazing offerings employees can utilize while being a part of the VC team:"
