        "text": "Toxic Rabbit and Nuclear Rabbit are villains in the series Kaiju Paradise Gets Grounded on YouTube. They are bunnies with toxic abilities that they use against their main enemy Lemy and the guards of Laminax Laboratories in attempts to escape and transfur them into furries, as well as defeat Lemy so they can take over the facility.\n\nThey are portrayed both by Rod.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nToxic Rabbit has bright green skin and dark green fur at the top, and Nuclear Rabbit has dark green skin and brighter green fur at the top.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nToxic Rabbit is usually social and energetic, while Nuclear Rabbit is destructive and chaotic, and more evil then his friend. Nuclear even goes as far as yelling at him because of his status quo personality of being mean to people.\n\nBiography[]\n\nThey first appear sitting in their cell, and Toxic Rabbit asks Nuclear Rabbit what they should do, but Nuclear pushes him and Toxic asks why he did that, Nuclear responds that he's supposed to be a jerk to people and Toxic reminds him that he's his only friend, and Nuclear tells him that if he continues that they're not going to be friends anymore, Toxic throws it back at him and tells him to take his anger out on the humans.\n\nNuclear swears at Toxic and Toxic says that he's telling the guards and yells at Nuclear, but Nuclear replies with an even more vulgar response, prompting Toxic even more to tells the guards, but before he can, Nuclear turns into a teeth guy and destroys their cell, meanwhile, two people hear the commotion and suspect Nuclear, the guard goes in the cell and yells at the other guy to get over there, when he does, he's just as shocked as the guard and grounds Nuclear, as well as giving him a potion to reverse his teeth guy effects.\n\nThey were later accidentally run over by Jammer in his toxic waste delivery truck, the toxic waste turned the two rabbits into zombies, but before they could get a chance to escape their graves, they were sliced up by Lemy with a lawnmower.\n\nThey were among the villains who escaped Laminax Laboratories when Nightcrawler took the facility over, they were later defeated by Lemy along with their fellow inmates when Toxic Rabbit was thrown at Figs and Nuclear Rabbit was knocked down and bodyslammed by Lemy.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nKaiju Paradise Gets Grounded[]\n\nNuclear Rabbit becomes a teeth guy and destroys his/Toxic Rabbit's cell\n\nComing of the Zombtraxians\n\nThe Laminax Breakout (cameo)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThey have yet to appear in a speaking role in the redesign."
