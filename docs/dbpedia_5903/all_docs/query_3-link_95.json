        "text": "Stafford Lake and Dam\n\nStafford Lake was created with the construction of Stafford Dam on Novato Creek in 1951. It was created to provide a drinking water source of supply for the growing Novato community.\n\nStafford Lake has also developed into a recreation destination for many in the community. It provides opportunities for fishing and is stocked with Florida-strain large mouth bass, sunfish, and channel catfish. Because it is a drinking water source, access for fishing is restricted within 1,500 feet of the dam and intake tower.\n\nNo swimming or boating is allowed at the lake as a protective measure.\n\nStafford Lake Information\n\nLocation\n\nOn Novato Creek, four miles west of downtown Novato, adjacent to Novato Boulevard. Stafford Lake is contained by the Stafford Dam, which is also known as the “Novato Creek” Dam, California Dam No. 88-0 and National ID No. CA00321.\n\nOwner & Operator\n\nAll of Stafford Lake and much of the land adjacent to the shoreline is owned by North Marin Water District (870+ acres). The northern portion is owned by the County of Marin.\n\nBeneficial Uses\n\nWater Supply – provides 20% of the Novato area’s water supply.\n\nRecreation – fishing from shoreline only; Marin County Regional Park, Indian Valley Golf Course (open to public); hiking, etc.\n\nCattle Grazing – in areas fenced off from lake shoreline.\n\nFlood Control – Stafford dam does not have multi-purposes; it’s primary function is water supply. Some incidental flood control occurs within the notched overflow when the lake is spilling.\n\nHistory of Stafford Lake\n\nStafford Dam Information\n\nOwner & Operator\n\nNorth Marin Water District\n\nRegulatory Jurisdiction\n\nThe Dam is under the jurisdiction of the California Department of Water Resources Division of Safety of Dams (DSOD). Stafford Dam is listed as the Novato Creek Dam under the DSOD inventory as DSOD Dam No. 88-0; National Inventory of Dams National ID No. CA00321.\n\nDownstream Hazard Classification\n\nDSOD has classified Stafford Dam as an Extremely High Hazard Dam; federal classification is a High Hazard Dam. An Extremely High Hazard classification is unique to California and is based solely on potential downstream impacts to life and property should the dam fail when operating with a full reservoir (lake). This hazard classification is not related to the potential for the dam to fail due to natural hazards or other causes.\n\nPhysical Characteristics\n\nThe Dam is an earthen embankment with a reinforced concrete spillway. The Dam is 71 feet high (measured from upstream toe) and has a crest length of 650 feet. The crest elevation is 213 feet (NGVD-29), and the spillway elevation is 196 feet (flood control crest) and 199 feet (emergency spillway).\n\nPurpose\n\nThe primary function of Stafford Dam is impoundment of run-off water for treatment and distribution of potable water to NMWD customers. It collects runoff from approximately 8.3-square miles of Novato Creek’s upper tributary watershed to create Stafford Lake Reservoir. Stafford Lake supplies surface water to the 6 MGD Stafford Water Treatment Plant, just below the dam, that annually provides approximately 750 MG (or ~20%) of Novato’s potable water supply. Fish releases via the primary outlet (30-inch pipe) occur between May and October totaling on average 150 AFY.\n\nStafford Dam Safety Fact Sheet\n\nDam Emergency Action Plan\n\nMarin County Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan\n\nDam Inundation Mapping\n\nFEMA Flood Maps\n\nFlood Risk Below Dams"
