        "text": "The Marin Sonoma Narrow extends 16-miles from State Route 37 in Marin County to Corona Road in Petaluma. The project will add a northbound and southbound carpool lane for the entire 16-mile stretch of highway.\n\nThe project was divided into 13 sub-projects to correspond with funding availability.\n\nThe ABCs of the Project\n\nThe projects were assigned names (Segment A, B or C) according to the location of the project. The map below will help to identify the projects.\n\nSegment A projects - Novato from south of State Route 37 to Atherton Avenue.\n\nSegment B projects - Novato from Atherton Avenue to Route 116 in Petaluma\n\nSegment C projects - Petaluma from State Route 116 to the Corona Road\n\nWhat Projects are Left for the Marin/Sonoma Narrows Widening?\n\nThe final widening project, B7, began in July 2022. During construction, Hwy 101 will be widened between northern Novato and the Sonoma/Marin county line. The project is scheduled for completion in summer 2025.\n\nAlso, two smaller projects need to be completed, B8 and B3.\n\nB8 is a utility relocation project that covers that same stretch of highway as B7. Typically, utility relocation must be done before widening begins, but in this case the utilities are not in the work area and can be moved after the B7 project is completed.\n\nB3 is a small project to renovate the San Antonio Creek Bridge to prevent it from flooding. This bridge restoration project is located on a nearby county road and will not affect the freeway widening.\n\nProjects Currently Under Construction Now\n\nMSN B7, Add carpool lanes between Novato and the Marin-Sonoma county line.\n\nAddition Project Information\n\nCompleted Projects"
