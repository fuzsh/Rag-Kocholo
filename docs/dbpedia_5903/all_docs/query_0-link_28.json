        "text": "Overexpression of the ErbB2/HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase occurs in up to 25% of human breast cancers, where it is predictive of aggressive disease and poor clinical outcome, and serves as a validated clinical target for a growing class of anti-ErbB2 therapeutics (1, 2). In addition to therapeutic antibodies and small molecule kinase inhibitors that specifically interfere with ErbB2 receptor function, some targeted agents in clinical development actually depend upon the endocytic recycling and intracellular trafficking of membrane overexpressed ErbB2 (3, 4), calling attention to this poorly understood but critical feature of ErbB2 receptor biology. Yet another class of therapeutics being developed to treat ErbB2-positive cancers includes derivatives of the benzoquinoid ansamycin antibiotic geldanamycin (GA), which bind to and inactivate an essential chaperone of membrane-bound ErbB2, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), inducing endocytosis and receptor downregulation by proteasomal and lysosomal mechanisms (5, 6). Given its unique mechanism of action and the particular sensitivity of overexpressed ErbB2 to HSP90 inhibitors, GA has become a favorite tool for studying ErbB2 receptor endocytosis and trafficking (7–10). Less well appreciated is the recent observation that proteasome inhibition by the clinically approved dipeptide boronate bortezomib (PS341) can also induce ErbB2 internalization and lysosomal decay (11).\n\nUnlike the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) whose ligand-activated endocytosis and intracellular trafficking has become a model for all receptor tyrosine kinases (12, 13), the ligand-less ErbB2 receptor is considered to be endocytosis impaired, although there is poor understanding of how this is achieved (8, 12–14). Instead of being internalized and endosomally routed into vesicles and the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway for subsequent lysosomal degradation as with ligand-activated EGFR, ErbB2 dimers are largely recycled back to the plasma membrane for reactivation (8, 12, 13). ErbB2 can even transfer its endocytosis impairment to EGFR and other heterodimerizing partners, although this impairment can be fully abrogated by HSP90 inhibition, which induces rapid ErbB2 ubiquitination followed by receptor downregulation (15, 16). The importance of ubiquitination in regulating ErbB2 endocytosis and plasma membrane overexpression remains obscure, although it has been suggested that the endocytosis impairment of ErbB2 is due to its intrinsic resistance to ubiquitination (12). Thus, new insight is needed into the mechanisms and ubiquitination codes associated with ErbB2 endocytosis and downregulation (13, 17).\n\nUbiquitination is a reversible posttranslational modification regulating a wide variety of protein signaling mechanisms, including endocytic downregulation of ErbB family receptors (13, 17). The 76–amino acid ubiquitin polypeptide can be covalently attached via its COOH terminal glycine (G76) to either a target protein's lysine (K) ϵ-amino group or to another target-bound ubiquitin molecule via one of its seven internal K residues, forming topologically distinct polyubiquitin chains. Ubiquitin (E3) ligases interact with specific ubiquitin conjugating (E2) enzymes associated with different intracellular sites and linkage-specific reaction products. Two different E3 ligases, CHIP (COOH terminus of HSP70-interacting protein) and c-Cbl, have been reported to associate with ErbB2, each capable of forming different types of polyubiquitin chains (13–16, 18, 19). The most abundant polyubiquitin chains in living cells are K48 linkages, which adopt a closed conformation and serve as a signal for target protein degradation by the 26S proteasome. Next most common, K63 linkages adopt an extended linear conformation as nonproteasome addressing dock sites for such diverse cellular functions as DNA repair, signal transduction, transcription, endosomal trafficking, and MVB sorting for lysosomal decay (12, 13, 17, 20). In particular, K63-linked polyubiquitination has been clearly associated with clathrin-dependent endocytosis and lysosomal downregulation of ligand-activated EGFR (13, 21, 22). As well, ubiquitination can be edited via developmentally and subcellularly restricted deubiquitinating isopeptidases (deubiquitylating enzymes, DUB), regulating the intracellular fate of a target protein (23, 24). Two DUBs potentially relevant to the endocytosis and trafficking of breast epithelial membrane proteins are USP8/UBPy, known to facilitate the downregulation of EGFR and ErbB3 (25), and USP9x/FAM, an endosomally localized regulator of epithelial stem/progenitor cell function (26, 27).\n\nThe present study used SK-BR-3 cells to explore the dependence of ErbB2 overexpression on both polyubiquitination and deubiquitination mechanisms. The contrasting effects of PS341 and GA on ErbB2 polyubiquitination were assessed using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)/mass spectrometry (MS) and linkage-specific monoclonal antibodies (28), showing that proteasome and HSP90 inhibitors downregulate overexpressed ErbB2 by alternative cytoplasmic trafficking and degradative pathways linked to different K48 and K63 polyubiquitin chain editing mechanisms.\n\nAlthough there is little understanding and still some controversy behind the conclusion that ErbB2 is an endocytosis-impaired receptor system (12, 13), interest in this aspect of ErbB2 biology has increased with the development of novel therapeutics that either modulate or use the ErbB2 endocytosis mechanism (1–4). Whereas GA inhibition of HSP90 has emerged as an invaluable tool for investigating mechanisms regulating the maintenance of ErbB2 surface expression and its endocytic downregulation (5–10, 12, 13), controversies arising from these studies as well as comparisons between ErbB2 and EGFR internalization mechanisms now include clathrin dependence or independence of ErbB2 internalization (9, 10, 12, 13, 32, 33), endocytic trafficking of ErbB2 to either proteasome or lysosome for receptor degradation (5, 9, 10), and the role of ErbB2 ubiquitination in mediating any of these processes (12–17). Given the extensive investigations into ErbB2 internalization activated by HSP90 inhibition, the present study attempted to cast new light on these processes by evaluating ErbB2 internalization and downregulation activated by proteasome inhibition using the approved therapeutic bortezomib (PS341).\n\nUnlike the rapid ErbB2 downregulating effects of HSP90 inhibition by GA (50% by 6 hours), complete proteasome inhibition in SK-BR-3 by PS341 induced a more delayed exchange in the ErbB2-associated chaperones (HSP70 for HSP90), followed by surface-to-perinuclear redistribution of ErbB2 and a 50% reduction in total ErbB2 protein expression by 24 hours. This perinuclear sequestration of ErbB2 colocalized with lysosomal proteins and occurred by a clathrin-independent internalization process that required new protein synthesis, and as previously shown, chloroquine inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis prevented the PS341-induced degradation of ErbB2 but not its lysosomal sequestration (11). Whereas recent studies have been inconclusive about either the clathrin dependence or lysosomal trafficking of GA-induced ErbB2 endocytosis (9, 10, 32, 33), our SK-BR-3 studies indicate that GA-induced downregulation of ErbB2 may be clathrin dependent, is unaffected by chloroquine, and therefore unassociated with lysosomal trafficking. Furthermore, our SK-BR-3 imaging and molecular studies of full-length ErbB2 clearly indicate that proteasome and HSP90 inhibition result in different ErbB2 chaperone exchange and internalization rates, intracellular trafficking mechanisms, and degradative fates. Associated with these clear mechanistic differences in ErbB2 downregulation, we have also shown that PS341 and GA differentially affect ErbB2 receptor ubiquitination as well as its association with the E3 ligase, c-Cbl, and the deubiquitylating enzyme USP9x.\n\nUbiquitination, primarily in the form of K63-linked polyubquitin chains, is known to play an essential role in the endosomal trafficking and lysosomal degradation of EGFR (25), yet its potential role in mediating plasma membrane overexpression or endocytosis of ErbB2 remains obscure (13, 17). Transient transfection into SK-BR-3 of constructs expressing mutated ubiquitin unable to form any polyubiquitin chains or specifically unable to form K63 linked polyubiquitin prevented surface overexpression of ErbB2 and, in the former case, also prevented SK-BR-3 cell growth. Given the myriad intracellular mechanisms affected by polyubiquitination, it is likely that the observed abnormalities induced by these constructs reflect a general impairment in plasma membrane protein trafficking rather than direct alteration of ErbB2 polyubiquitination. Direct and indirect ErbB2 effects may also explain our observation that siRNA knockdown of the deubiquitylating enzyme USP9x significantly enhanced PS341-induced lysosomal decay of ErbB2, although the observed physical association between ErbB2 and USP9x/FAM in PS341-treated and untreated cells implicates direct mediation of this DUB in the ErbB2 internalization and ubiquitination induced by proteasome inhibition. Unlike this ErbB2 association with USP9x, neither of the two E3 ligases (CHIP or c-Cbl) were found to coprecipitate with overexpressed ErbB2 in untreated SK-BR-3 cells. However, within 6 hours of PS341 (but not GA) treatment the intact and internalized ErbB2 receptor became associated with c-Cbl (but not with CHIP) and remained so for at least 24 horus, during which time ErbB2 polyubiquitination topology was changing from predominantly K48 to K63 chain linkages whereas the COOH terminally intact receptor was trafficking into the lysosome compartment.\n\nBecause K48-linked polyubiquitin is required for 26S proteasome recognition and degradation (13, 14, 17), proteasome inhibition might be expected to result in a buildup of K48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins otherwise destined for proteasomal degradation. In contrast, the proteasome system is not inhibited in GA-treated cells, so an early buildup to a steady-state limit of K48 ErbB2 polyubiquitin might also be expected if K48 ErbB2 polyubiquitin was rapidly induced and then proteasomally degraded at a constant rate. It is interesting to note that the modest yet balanced buildup in both K48 and K63 ErbB2 polyubiquitin following HSP90 inhibition was not associated with any detectable lysosomal trafficking and proteolysis, suggesting that GA-induced ErbB2 polyubiquitin contains mixed chain linkages that lack the extended linear topology of K63 ErbB2 polyubiquitin essential for endosomal sorting to the MVB and lysosome. In contrast, the early buildup of K48 ErbB2 polyubiquitin followed by the later (>8 hours) buildup of K63 ErbB2 polyubiquitin, during proteasome inhibition and when ErbB2 is associated with c-Cbl, suggests a sequential polyubiquitin editing process rather than unbalanced mixed ubiquitin chain formation, superimposing K63 chain formation on a primary base of K48 linkages to enable lysosomal trafficking. Although CHIP has been shown capable of producing either K48, K63, or even mixed polyubiquitin chain linkages depending on its associated E2 enzyme (34), we were unable to detect any GA-induced ErbB2 association with CHIP in SK-BR-3 cells. In contrast, we found that upon exposure to PS341, ErbB2 associates with c-Cbl, and recent studies indicate that c-Cbl can also produce either K48 or K63 ubiquitin chains (35, 36), suggesting that, depending on its subcellular context and E2 partner, c-Cbl may also be able to form mixed polyubiquitin chain linkages and participate in ErbB2 polyubiquitin editing.\n\nFurther investigations are needed to understand the various mechanistic controls determining K48 and K63 ErbB2 polyubiquitination, as well as the roles these topologically distinct forms of ErbB2 polyubiquitin play in determining ErbB2 intracellular trafficking and degradation. Nonetheless, the translational importance of these processes is becoming clearer. Recently, it was shown that combined treatment with trastuzumab and an HSP90 inhibitor produces greater ErbB2 ubiquitination and degradation than can be achieved by either treatment alone (19). Therefore, ErbB2 intracellular trafficking mechanisms activated by either GA or PS341 treatment must be better delineated for optimal clinical development of the next generation of ErbB2-targeted therapeutics, which will also include drug-encapsulated anti-ErbB2 immunoliposomes (4) and antibody-drug conjugates like trastuzumab-DM1 (3) that depend upon ErbB2 internalization and endocytosis to deliver their cytotoxic cargos."
