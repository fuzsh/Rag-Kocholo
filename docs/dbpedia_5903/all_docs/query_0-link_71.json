I have lived here on on a small farm in northern New Mexico since 1967 raising children, animals and vegtables. Attended several reunions of people from the '50s-'60s era of what we called UCHC including one here at our place in '96. Hope there will be more. Several other old-timers of that time also reside nearby.\n\nThanks for the pictures of the Redwood Park hike at the 50th anniversary.

I spent my life leading wilderness and natural history trips, and immersed in environmental education. I married another one of the gang, Dottie Gasser, who farmed with me in Nova Scotia in the 1960s, and created with me two splendid daughters, Sarah and Martha. In the 70s, I joined my fortunes to Cristina Kessler Noble, and two more magical kids appeared, Jennifer (Wren) and Brendan. Tina, married to this ol' guy for 41 years, is now deep in late-stage Alzheimer's, sound asleep on my shoulder. She's at home with me and my beloved partner, Desiree Storch, in our hobbit house at the verge of the bay. I aspire to be a poet (one national poetry prize under my belt) and have written and edited much short fiction. For my 75th, despite a few health challenges, I climbed Mt Tamalpais from sea level and back - 22 miles and 3000 ft. Take that, geezerhood! Keep hiking, dear friends.\n\nEntry received Jan 2014\n\nCathy Aley\n\nâSee Tom Aley\n\nDave Rottman\n\nActive: Late 1950s - early 1960s\n\nNo computer, contact via helenmcginnis frontiernet.net\n\nRock climbing, building and bridge climbing, steam tunneling, caving, and much more!

Air Force for 5 years following graduation in physics. Returned to UC Berkeley in 1968, married Jean (very smart move!), gave up technical rock climbing, and almost completed a PhD in forestry. Had a career in reforestation and related silvicultural practices with the USDA Forest Service in California, retiring in 2002. Two children: Will, now 31, is a lawyer in Walnut Creek; Laurel, now 29, is a supervisory lab tech working in drug medical research in San Francisco. We live in Burlingame, CA, and I volunteer-teach science in local public schools and am active in amateur astronomy. We still hike and backpack, but more slowly, not as far, and for shorter periods.\n\nEntry received July 2010\n\nJohn Fitz\n\nSee: Miriam Berg\n\nKay Hershey Loughman\n\nActive: 1959-66\n\nE-mail: kayloughman earthlink.net\n\nActive: 1959-66, caving, hiking, backpacking, folkdancing.

The love of outdoors and nature that came with formative years in UCHC led to lifelong patterns. After grad work at Yale I started off a career in geology at the U.S. Geological Survey, a gig that has taken me from GalÃ¡pagos to Molokai, from training Apollo astronauts to a Fulbright at Cambridge U., from Bolivia to Scotland, Greek Islands, Pyrenees, and Madagascar, from initiating the agencyâs climate research program in the 70s, to getting laid off temporarily in the 90s after questioning the science done for a prospective nuclear waste dump. Years of field work in the California-Arizona deserts, lower Colorado River, and Nevada mountains continue to expand in my USGS now-Emeritus years -- canât help myself from active research wandering the hills. Linda, my wife of 15 years, likes to travel too, so we manage many trips together, and also enjoy 3 grandkids. Daughter Crystal, a prosecutor, has great allegiance to her undergrad campusâyes, Berkeley.\n\nEntry received October 2010\n\nLarry Epperson\n\nTish Reams Epperson\n\nActive: 1958-1960\n\nNewport, OR\n\ntishandlarry gmail.com\n\nI joined the Hiking Club in 1958. learned the basics of rock climbing and backpacking. I really enjoyed the Friday night folk dances in Senior Mens Hall. I met Tish there in 1960, and we were married a year later. We have lived mostly in the Northwest, Stevens Pass, Leavenworth. Now we are on the Oregon coast. We would enjoy seeing any old friends.\n\nLarry and Tish Epperson\n\n654 NW Nye Street\n\nNewport, Oregon 97369\n\nEntry received April 2013\n\nMinard \"Pete\" Hall\n\nLate 50sâearly 60s\n\nvolcan_pete yahoo.com\n\nPete is with the Instituto Geofisico, Escuela Politecnica Nacional, Quito, Ecuador.

I taught math for one year and wrote software for 2.5. During that time we did a fair bit of hiking in the rain forests and some skiing too. We were also acquired by a cat named Tuolumne (named after the river and meadows).\n\nLast year (2002), we had our first child â a girl named Risa Phair Jones â and moved to Boulder. Neva is working for the Denver Kaiser OB/GYN group, and I am still writing software. Despite a silly climbing accident (I broke the Talus bone in my left foot while bouldering), we still do a lot of hiking and we're looking forward to taking Risa on some CHAOS Junior trips (see Coy Chanders' entry).\n\nEntry received June 1998, updated October 2003\n\nDavid Thomas (A.K.A. \"Dessert Dave\", \"Toxic Dave\", \"Cave Dave\")\n\nActive: 1979; more actively during 1990-96\n\nDavid Thomas\n\nDr. Kristin Mitchell\n\nPeninsula Internal Medicine\n\n247 Fireweed, Suite A\n\nSoldotna, Alaska 99669\n\nHome phone: 907-283-4109\n\nemail: dthomas alaska.net\n\nIn 1997, Kristin Mitchell and I were married on a beach on Tomales Bay, 8 miles from where we on a CHAOS Gourmet Trip at Wildcat Camp in Point Reyes. After her 3-year residency in Seattle, we moved to the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska. Kristin joined a private internal medicine practice and I built our house (www.alaska.net/~dthomas for photos) on 13 acres of spruce forest on Cook Inlet. 700 feet of sandy beach and views of 3 glaciated volcanic peaks across the water await any visitors who want to camp out. We could even give you a heated room in the winter. Note that the Kenai Peninsula has spectacular mountains, glaciers, trout lakes, salmon rivers, fjords, great kayaking, hiking, skiing, dog sledding, etc - hint, hint. I continue to do environmental engineering and have gotten to travel to some obscure corners of the state to clean-up toxic waste sites. Our big activities up here are sea kayaking, lake/river canoeing, and hiking/backpacking in the summer. And X-C skiing, mushing with friend's sled dogs, and kayaking in neoprene in the winter. I am slowing learning from the locals how to kill and eat the wildlife, or at least the salmon, clams, and crabs. Our son, Drake, was born March 1, 2000 and is quite the traveler. In his first year, he has visited 5 countries, 10 states, and flown over 50,000 miles. Our trips clearly have not slowed down since parenthood. I'm still an avid road warrior with the silly goal of getting to all 3082 counties in the U.S. To date, I've been to 1305 including all within 1080 miles of Berkeley or Seattle. So wherever you are, I may be driving by sometime.\n\nEntry updated January 2001\n\nDiane Hirshberg (a.k.a. full moon goddess)\n\nActive: 1999-2002\n\ndrdi_2001 yahoo.com\n\nI'm now part of the CHAOS - Alaska contingent.

Shasta, CA\n\nemandelkern yahoo.com\n\nAs of 2010 I have been living and working in Mt Shasta, CA for over 3 years. There are 3 stop lights in this town. I am working as a master's level mental health therapist at Siskiyou County Behavioral Health Services in these extreme northern reaches of California. Every day I get to look up at the 14,000+ ft peak of Mt Shasta. A half hour drive from my house puts me above 7000 ft on the mountain.\n\nMemories of the group: Numerous trips to Sykes hot springs, take a left at the Big Sur coast and walk 12 miles. Pumpkins in the strangest places all over campus on Halloween. 13,000+ ft. with crampons and ice axeÂ on Mt. Shasta, Dave Chalfant leading the way. Packed meetings with people crammed in and spilling out into next room. Pizza at Kips after the meeting. A very veryÂ cold Hetch Hetchy trip. Bicycling thousands of feet down the White Mtns (after driving up). Winter at Tahoe at the cabin. Ultimate Frisbee on Fridays. Tracy's family's house boat. A few of us skiing into the backcountry and camping and having fun somewhere in the Sierra building and sleeping inÂ snow caves until \"Electro\" had to lead usÂ out early whenÂ a storm brought in white out conditions. Wondering if one of the cars in the convoy going out on a trip would ever not get lost.\n\nI also made a couple excursions into winter backcountry with Chris V. including an assent of Lassen in the middle of winter(with half an igloo builtÂ at base camp) and a trip to Harbin with Sara.

All four of us were members of the Hiking Club about the same time, and they informed us of the 50th anniversary of the club. Unfortunately, the timing of the reunion doesn't work for us, so we will have to miss the upcoming festivities!\n\nRolf and I met in the Hiking Club in March 1989 and have been hiking buddies since the April 1989 Lost Coast Trip. We graduated in 1992 and moved to Seattle where Rolf is now finishing his Ph.D. in geomorphology at the University of Washington and just returned from a month of fieldwork in Bolivia. I got a Masters in creative writing (nonfiction) and especially enjoyed teaching \"American Literature of Nature and Place.\"\n\nWe bought a run-down farm six years ago and have spent a good deal of our time building fences, sanding floors, painting, roofing, and planting trees. Goats once lived in our farmhouse, but now it shines with domestic tranquility... There is also a creek (creeks here are small rivers) and we have a beautiful view of the jagged Cascade Mountains. We also have a nine month-old son named August. We LOVE the Pacific Northwest and would like to stay here after Rolf finishes since there is so much to do in the mountains and on the water.\n\nWe'd love to hear from anyone from our era!\n\nâKathryn Aalto\n\nEntry received September 1998\n\nUpdate:\n\nRolf and I ran into old Hiking Club folks from the 1989-1992 era at the Spring 2001 Strawberry Music Festival: Robo Mark, his wife Jessica and their chubby son as well as Katy Vogel, her husband, and their young son. As for our family, it's growing â our son, August Riordan, was born in December 1997 and daughter, Tess Elizabeth, was born in March 2000. I teach research paper writing and other courses at Everett Community College on a very part-time basis. Rolf is now \"Dr. Mud,\" having just completed nine years of work in geology at the University of Washington.\n\nMarch 2002\n\nKees Meyboom\n\nIn club from September '91 to May '92\n\nEmail address: kees.meyboom hccnet.nl\n\nHome address:\n\nDikkeboomweg 15\n\n6542 RJ Nijmegen\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nPhone number: +31 24 3294877\n\nAfter I left Berkeley to travel around Mexico, Guatemala and Belize I ended in Boston with Megan, Matthew and Glenn. From there I went back to The Netherlands and graduated. After a few short odd jobs, one to teach Genetics at the university in Wageningen I had to join the army.\n\nThis did not turn out to be the disaster I assumed it would be. In fact I had a very good time. They made me an officer (not a gentleman, that I was already :-)) in intelligence, which made things more interesting. The army asked me to stay for another 10 months. I accepted because it was fun and because they would pay me quite a lot of money. This money came in handy for the next paragraph.\n\nIn January '95 I left the army and decided to go travel around the world on a motorcycle. Which I did. There was roaming the streets of Odessa with a ukrainian bike-gang, swimming in the Volga in Russia, getting stuck in the dessert in Kazachstan, escaping war in Afghanistan(only just), spending the night with Khomeiny in Iran, duckhunting with a prince in Pakistan, spending Christmas with mother Theresa in India, getting shot at in Bangladesh, crossing the bridge over the river Kwai in Thailand, a crash in Malaysia, love in Indonesia and visiting friends in the USA.\n\nLuckily my girlfriend Annet (who visited me in Indonesia, hence the love) was still waiting for me when I came back. I settled in Nijmegen, where she lives as well. Since I assumed it would be hard to find work in Biology after leaving the subject for so long I decided to make a switch to IT (Information Technology). Now I am working for a company which is educating me in software called SAP and logistics (we are taking APICS exams). For this company I am working at the tax department of the government, trying to implement this SAP software.\n\nHopefully I will be able to come to the States sometimes soon to see everybody again.\n\nUpdate: Imke Meyboom was born on october 7, 2003.

Angela and Mike started dating in April 97 and now we know the real reason for his disappearance.\n\nMike continues to work at World Wrapps in SF as their accounting manager and still invites everyone in the outdoor club(s) to his restaurant opening parties. Mike also continues to climb, bike, run, backpack, fly fish, scuba and mountaineer. He just started learning aid climbing and hopes to do his first big wall within the next year.

This year they are each in a different troop level â Daisy, Brownie, and Junior â fortunately I have recruited a few other people to help out. Iâve enjoyed working with kids so much, last year I made a career shift from computer programmer to math teacher. Working in the DC public schools has been an adventure, a lot of the time itâs like being dragged behind a boat after failing to get up on your waterskis, but I havenât given up yet.
