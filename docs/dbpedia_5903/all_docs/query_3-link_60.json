        "text": "About Bel Marin Keys\n\nBel Marin Keys is a waterfront development located in an unincorporated portion of northeastern Marin County, California, approximately 3 miles east of US 101, 4 miles east of the City of Novato and approximately 25 miles north of the City of San Francisco. A community of 702 single family homes, Bel Marin Keys is surrounded by open space, bounded by tidal wetlands owned by the California State Coastal Conservancy to the south; east and west of Novato Creek and farm land managed by the Novato Sanitary District and the County of Marin Flood Control District to the North and Northeast. The community surrounds two man made lagoons, each in excess 100 acres, which open to Novato Creek via locks and provide homeowners with water access to San Pablo Bay.\n\nApproximately 70% of the community was subdivided from the period 1962 through 1965 by Jack and Evelyn West. The remainder of the community was subdivided in 1981 and 1982 by Home Savings of America, with construction of units following soon after. With the exception of a 30-unit townhome (the Gardens of Bel Marin) and a 12 unit town home (Bermuda Harbor), each home has a back-yard water access to either one of the two lagoons or the Novato Creek. The residents of the Gardens of Bel Marin share a private dock on the North Lagoon."
