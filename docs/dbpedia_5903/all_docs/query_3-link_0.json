        "text": "City in California, United States\n\n\"Novato\" redirects here. For the meteorite, see Novato meteorite. For the stream, see Novato Creek.\n\n\"San Marin, California\" redirects here. Not to be confused with San Marino, California or San Martin, California.\n\nCity in California, United States\n\nNovato (Spanish for \"Novatus\") is a city in Marin County, California, United States, situated in the North Bay region of the Bay Area. At the 2020 census, Novato had a population of 53,225.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nWhat is now Novato was originally the site of several Coast Miwok villages: Chokecherry, near downtown Novato; Puyuku, near Ignacio; and Olómpali, at the present-day Olompali State Historic Park.[9]\n\nMexican era\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1839, the Mexican government granted the 8,876-acre (35.92 km2) Rancho Novato to Fernando Feliz. The rancho was named after a local Miwok leader who had probably been given the name of Saint Novatus at his baptism.[10] Subsequently, four additional land grants were made in the area: Rancho Corte Madera de Novato, to John Martin in 1839; Rancho San Jose, to Ignacio Pacheco in 1840; Rancho Olómpali, awarded in 1843 to Camilo Ynitia, son of a Coast Miwok chief; and Rancho Nicasio, by far the largest at 56,621 acres (229.1 km2), awarded to Pablo de la Guerra and John B.R. Cooper in 1844.[11]\n\nPost-Conquest era\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the American Conquest of California and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Novato, along with the rest of California, became part of the United States on February 2, 1848. Early pioneers included Joseph Sweetser and Francis De Long who bought 15,000 acres (61 km2) in the mid-1850s and planted orchards and vineyards.[12]\n\nThe first post office at Novato opened in 1856; it closed in 1860, and a new post office opened in 1891.[13]\n\nThe first school was built in 1859, at the corner of Grant Avenue and what is today Redwood Boulevard.\n\nThe original town was located around Novato Creek at what is now South Novato Boulevard. A railroad was built in 1879, connecting Novato to Sonoma County and San Rafael. The area around the train depot became known as New Town, and forms the edge of what today is Old Town Novato. The Novato Flatiron Building was built in 1908.\n\nModern era\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s had a marked effect on the area, as many farmers lost their land. After World War II, Novato grew quickly with the construction of tract homes and a freeway. As the area was unincorporated, much of the growth was unplanned and uncontrolled.\n\nNovato was finally incorporated as a city in 1960.[14] One of the most important venues of the time (1960 to 1965) was \"Western Weekend\". Beard-growing contests, sponsored by Bob's Barber Shop, and many other odd activities helped to bring this community together.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Novato has a total area of 28.0 square miles (73 km2) and is the largest city in area in Marin County. A total of 27.4 square miles (71 km2) is land and 0.5 square miles (1.3 km2) (1.85%) is water.\n\nThe southwestern part of Novato is significantly more mountainous, whereas eastern Novato is characterized by marshland and diked fields and pastures.\n\nMajor geographical features nearby include Mount Burdell and Mount Burdell Open Space Preserve to the north and Big Rock Ridge to the southwest. Stafford Lake to the west is a secondary water supply for Novato, with the Russian River in Sonoma County to the north supplying 80% of the city's water.[15]\n\nNovato includes ten Marin County Open Space District preserves: Mount Burdell, Rush Creek, Little Mountain, Verissimo Hills, Indian Tree, Deer Island, Indian Valley, Ignacio Valley, Loma Verde, and Pacheco Valle. Although Novato is located on the water, access to the water is blocked by expansive farmland and wetlands.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial weather observations were taken at Hamilton Air Force Base through 1964. Average January temperatures were a maximum of 53.6 °F (12.0 °C) and a minimum of 38.7 °F (3.7 °C). Average July temperatures were a maximum of 79.9 °F (26.6 °C) and a minimum of 52.0 °F (11.1 °C). There were an average of 12.4 days with highs of 90 °F (32 °C) or higher and an average of 12.5 days with lows of 32 °F (0 °C) or lower. The record high temperature was 111 °F (44 °C) on September 5, 2022.[16] The record low temperature was 16 °F (−9 °C) in December 2013. Average annual precipitation was 25.49 inches (64.7 cm). The wettest year was 1940 with 46.63 inches (118.4 cm) and the driest year was 2015 with 6.35 inches (16.1 cm). The most rainfall in one month was 18.87 inches (47.9 cm) in December 1955. The most rainfall in 24 hours was 10.55 inches (26.8 cm) between December 10, 2014 – December 11, 2014.[17]\n\nToday, the nearest National Weather Service cooperative weather station is in San Rafael, where records date back to 1894. Compared to records from Hamilton Air Force Base, San Rafael is generally several degrees warmer than Novato and has an average of about 10 inches (25 cm) more rainfall. The record high temperature in San Rafael was 110 °F (43 °C) on September 7, 1904, and June 14, 1961. The record low temperature was 20 °F (−7 °C) on December 26, 1967.[18]\n\nAccording to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Novato has a warm-summer mediterranean climate, abbreviated \"Csb\" on climate maps. This means that Summers are Hot, but Winters are rainy and can be mild to chilly. Precipitation occurs in the colder seasons, but there are a number of clear sunny days even during the wetter seasons, except during spells of seasonal tule fog, when it can be quite chilly for many days.\n\nNovato has a history of flooding due to its low-lying position, as well as the fact that much of the city used to be marshland. Due to the system of levees in Eastern Novato, flooding is quite common in that area, both from excessive rain and levee breaches.[19][20]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nNovato is governed by a city council of five members. All five councilmembers are elected by city council districts to staggered four-year terms. The city council elects a mayor and mayor pro tem each year from its membership. The current councilmembers are:[22]\n\nDistrict 1 Councilmember: Susan Wernick\n\nDistrict 2 Councilmember: Rachel Farac\n\nDistrict 3 Councilmember: Tim O'Connor (Mayor Pro Tem)\n\nDistrict 4 Councilmember: Pat Eklund\n\nDistrict 5 Councilmember: Mark Milberg (Mayor)\n\nIn the United States House of Representatives, Novato is in California's 2nd congressional district, represented by Democrat Jared Huffman.[6] From 2008 to 2012, Huffman represented Marin County in the California State Assembly.\n\nIn the California State Legislature, Novato is in:\n\nthe 12th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Damon Connolly[23]\n\nthe 2nd Senate District, represented by Democrat Mike McGuire.\n\nAccording to the California Secretary of State, as of February 10, 2019, Novato had 31,544 registered voters. Of those, 15,794 (50.1%) were registered Democrats, 6,048 (19.2%) were registered Republicans, and 8,188 (26%) declined to state a political party.[24]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 196017,881—197031,00673.4%198043,91641.6%199047,5858.4%200047,6300.1%201051,9049.0%202053,2252.5%\n\n2020\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the 2020 census Novato had a population of 52,225.

About 3.1% of families and 5.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.1% of those under age 18 and 4.0% of those age 65 or over.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is home to the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, and several biotech firms, such as Biosearch Technologies, BioMarin Pharmaceutical and Ultragenyx.[31] Several small technology companies are also based in Novato, such as 2K, Radiant Logic, Toys For Bob, One Legal, International Genetics Incorporated, Channel Management Solutions, Enwisen, Sonic Solutions and DriveSavers.\n\nThe former Hamilton Air Force Base is also located in Novato, but was decommissioned in 1974 and designated a Historic District in 1998. After lying stagnant for many years, major renovations were pushed through by then-mayor Michael DiGiorgio. As of 2008 the base has largely been redeveloped into single-family homes. The former hangar buildings were gutted and redeveloped into two-story office buildings; tenants include 2K Sports, Sony Imageworks, Visual Concepts, The Republic of Tea, Toys For Bob, and Birkenstock Distribution USA.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1998, the iconic[32] developer of video games, Brøderbund Software, was headquartered in Novato, known through games Choplifter, Lode Runner, Karateka, and Prince of Persia, and others.[33] From the 1982 until 2015, Novato was headquarters for Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, which was Marin County's largest employer at one time, with 2,400 employees as of 2000. By 2015, the company had laid off or transferred most its employees and relocated its remaining employees to a smaller headquarters in nearby Petaluma.[34]\n\nIn Eastern Novato, north of Hamilton, there are several hayfields contributing to the local economy, but they are diminishing as more and more of them are restored to wetlands.\n\nMining and Quarrying\n\n[edit]\n\nNovato's history of mines and quarries goes back to 1863, when all of a sudden, multiple mining claims popped up in the area. At this time, most of the mines were either gold, silver, or copper mines. Initial results seemed promising, but eventually, prospects shifted elsewhere. Instead of mining for silver or gold, Novato's quarries and mines turned to Mount Burdell. Mount Burdell ended up being the source of hundreds of thousands of hand-cut andesite paving blocks, that were used as ballast in ships and street construction as far away as in Europe. Many of San Francisco's foundations and retaining walls from before the 1906 earthquake also came from Mount Burdell. Novato's largest quarry, the Burdell quarry, produced upwards of 2000-4000 tons of stone daily. Even with such high production, the quarrying activity in Novato slowly waned until the last quarry, located on the west side of Mount Burdell, shut down in the 1990s.[35]\n\nTop employers\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2018–19 the city's principal employers were:[36]\n\n# Employer # of Employees % of Total City Employed 1 BioMarin Pharmaceutical 1005 3.56% 2 Novato Unified School District 803 2.85% 3 2K/Visual Concepts 660 2.34% 4 Bradley Electric 342 1.21% 5 Costco Wholesale 316 1.12% 6 Novato Community Hospital 304 1.08% 7 City of Novato 290 1.03% 8 Ultragenyx 275 0.98% 9 Safeway Stores 250 0.89% 10 Novato Healthcare Center 233 0.83%\n\nRecreation\n\n[edit]\n\nNovato is a destination for outdoor enthusiasts, with its many parks and open space preserves providing ample hiking trails, biking trails, picnic spots, and playgrounds. Parks and open space preserves featuring hiking trails include:\n\nRush Creek Open Space Preserve\n\nMount Burdell Open Space Preserve\n\nIndian Valley Open Space Preserve\n\nOlompali State Historic Park\n\nStafford Lake County Park\n\nDeer Island\n\nLittle Mountain\n\nVerissimo Hills\n\nBuck Gulch Falls (also known as the Fairway Waterfall)[37] is located in the Ignacio Valley Preserve, and can be accessed from the trailhead at the end of Fairway Drive. There is also a waterfall in the Indian Valley Open Space Preserve, along the Ken Harth Waterfall Trail, and another in the Pacheco Valle Preserve, at the end of Pacheco Creek Drive.
