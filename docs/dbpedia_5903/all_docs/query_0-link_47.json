        "text": "Reverse transcription of the viral single-stranded RNA genome into double-stranded cDNA, followed by integration into the host genome, are defining features of retrovirus replication (Hu and Hughes, 2012). These events occur in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the newly infected cell within ill-defined nucleoprotein complexes, termed reverse transcription (RTC) and pre-integration complex (PIC), respectively. Accumulating evidence indicates that the viral capsid structure plays an essential role in early replication (Campbell and Hope, 2015; Yamashita and Engelman, 2017). Mutations in the HIV-1 CA (capsid) protein have been shown to cause defects in post-entry stages, and various cellular proteins binding CA exhibit positive or negative effects on early HIV-1 replication (Hilditch and Towers, 2014; Ambrose and Aiken, 2014; Campbell and Hope, 2015; Yamashita and Engelman, 2017). Accordingly, CA and/or the structure of the viral capsid have been implicated in reverse transcription, cytoplasmic trafficking, evasion from the cell-autonomous immune response and nuclear entry (Ambrose and Aiken, 2014; Hilditch and Towers, 2014; Yamashita and Engelman, 2017; Campbell and Hope, 2015).\n\nNeither the exact composition of the HIV-1 RTC/PIC nor the functional role of host cell dependency or restriction factors that interact with CA during early replication is currently well understood. Furthermore, the time of capsid uncoating during early HIV-1 replication is not well established, and may differ depending on the target cell type (Arhel et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2011; Hulme et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016). Individual viruses entering a host cell may follow different - productive and non-productive – pathways, and it is crucial to identify productive phenotypes correlating with infection. It is generally accepted that incoming capsids remain intact after cytoplasmic entry and during the initial stages of reverse transcription, while different reports suggest uncoating in the cytoplasm or at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (e.g. Xu et al., 2013; Mamede et al., 2017; Francis and Melikyan, 2018). Nuclear HIV-1 PIC have been observed to contain at least some CA (Zhou et al., 2011; Peng et al., 2014; Hulme et al., 2015; Chin et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016; Stultz et al., 2017), but the amount of residual CA and whether it maintains the lattice structure are unknown. Furthermore, the size of the conical viral capsid (~60 nm at the broad end (Briggs et al., 2003)) is larger than the width of the NPC transport channel (Beck et al., 2004), indicating that (partial) capsid disintegration or at least capsid or NPC remodeling is needed for HIV-1 nuclear translocation in non-dividing cells.\n\nCleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 6 (CPSF6) was initially identified as an HIV-1 restriction factor when exogenously expressed in a truncated form. The truncated protein is enriched in the cytoplasm, interacts with HIV-1 CA and impairs HIV-1 replication prior to nuclear import (Lee et al., 2010). In contrast, neither overexpression of full length CPSF6, which is almost exclusively nuclear, nor knock-down of CPSF6 significantly affected HIV-1 infectivity in cell lines (Lee et al., 2010; Hori et al., 2013; Fricke et al., 2013; De Iaco et al., 2013). Structural analyses identified a CPSF6-interacting interface and an overlapping site interacting with the nucleoporin Nup153 on the hexameric form of CA, the basic building block of the viral capsid (Price et al., 2012; Price et al., 2014; Bhattacharya et al., 2014). An HIV-1 derivative carrying a point mutation within this CPSF6-binding motif in CA (N74D) exhibited impaired CPSF6 binding in vitro and escaped restriction by truncated CPSF6, but displayed full infectivity in reporter cell lines (Lee et al., 2010; Schaller et al., 2011; Ambrose et al., 2012). In contrast, both CPSF6 knock-down and the N74D exchange impaired HIV-1 infection in post-mitotic primary human macrophages (Schaller et al., 2011; Ambrose et al., 2012), and this effect was attributed to induction of an interferon response triggered by viral DNA sensing (Rasaiyaah et al., 2013). Based on these results, it was speculated that cytoplasmic CPSF6 binds incoming viral capsids and blocks reverse transcription during cytoplasmic transport to prevent recognition of newly synthesized cDNA by cytoplasmic DNA sensors (Rasaiyaah et al., 2013).\n\nMore recently, CPSF6 was suggested to affect HIV-1 nuclear entry in a HeLa-based reporter cell line (Chin et al., 2015) and to be an important factor in targeting HIV-1 integration in infected primary CD4+ T-cells and macrophages (Sowd et al., 2016; Rasheedi et al., 2016; Achuthan et al., 2018). Strikingly, a later study described another point mutation in the CPSF6-binding interface of HIV-1 CA (A77V), which also abolished interaction with CPSF6 but did not appear to affect replication in primary cells (i.e. primary human macrophages and CD4+ T-cells), although it was negatively selected after passaging in vivo (Saito et al., 2016b). Taken together, it is clear that CPSF6 has an important, CA dependent function in early HIV-1 infection of macrophages, which may not be fully recapitulated in HeLa- or 293T-based reporter cell lines. This may reflect differences between cell lines and primary cells, but also between different cell types. The mechanism(s) of action of CPSF6 is not fully defined, and the relative contribution of cytoplasmic versus nuclear CPSF6 as well as the reason for the apparent cell-type specific differences are not resolved.\n\nWe have previously established a microscopy-based approach for quantitative analysis of HIV-1 post entry events on a single particle level (Peng et al., 2014). Labeling nascent RT products by incorporation of the thymidine analog EdU followed by click labeling, in conjunction with fluorescent labeling of the bona fide RTC/PIC component IN, identified reverse transcription competent HIV-1 RTC/PIC in the cytoplasm and nucleus of infected cells and enabled direct visualization of viral and cellular proteins associated with these complexes. Employing this system to investigate CPSF6 recruitment, we had observed weak or no CPSF6 signals on cytosolic RTC/PIC in model cell lines; pronounced-co-localization was only observed when transportin 3 (TNPO3), which is needed for CPSF6 nuclear import, was depleted (Peng et al., 2014). We have now used this approach for a detailed analysis of CPSF6 recruitment and its role for HIV-1 nuclear import in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). CPSF6 was strongly enriched on nuclear complexes, and depletion of CPSF6 or the A77V mutation in CA reduced HIV-1 infectivity in MDM. RTC/PIC accumulated close to the nuclear envelope in these cases. Two-color Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy revealed that CA-containing HIV-1 complexes directly co-localized with NPCs, and CPSF6 was associated with the nuclear basket at these sites in a CA-dependent manner. These results indicate that CPSF6 facilitates nuclear entry of HIV-1 in post-mitotic human macrophages in a CA–dependent manner at the level of the NPC.\n\nHIV-1 infection of all non-dividing cells requires transport of subviral complexes through the intact nuclear pore, and this can also be relevant in dividing cells. Various viral and host cell factors have been implicated in this process (Matreyek and Engelman, 2013; Bin Hamid et al., 2016; Yamashita and Engelman, 2017), but the exact mechanism of nuclear import remains unclear and may be cell-type dependent. We have analyzed nuclear entry of HIV-1 and productive infection in post-mitotic human MDM with a focus on the viral CA and the cellular CPSF6 protein. Applying quantitative microscopy of RTC/PIC, we detected CPSF6 primarily on nuclear complexes; cytoplasmic RTC/PIC were only found to be positive when CPSF6 was artificially targeted to the cytoplasm. No impairment of reverse transcription was observed in the latter case, arguing against the hypothesis that CPSF6 binding to the viral capsid arrests viral DNA synthesis to avoid recognition of viral DNA by DNA sensors (Rasaiyaah et al., 2013). In contrast, CPSF6 strongly associated with nuclear HIV-1 complexes, and bright nuclear punctae of CPSF6 could be used to identify subviral complexes following HIV-1 infection or lentiviral vector transduction even against the abundant background of CPSF6 in the nucleus. In agreement with a recent study (Rasheedi et al., 2016), we observed that CPSF6 is recruited to HIV-1 replication complexes as component of the CPSF52-CPSF62 CF Im complex. This complex is normally involved in pre-mRNA processing, but active transcription was not required for CPSF6 recruitment to HIV-1 PIC. We could also demonstrate that most nuclear subviral complexes co-localized with a signal from LEDGF immunostaining. Our results thus provide direct microscopic support for the model that LEDGF/p75 is recruited to the HIV-1 PIC (reviewed in Engelman and Singh, 2018), with the caveat that the antibody used did not allow us to discriminate between the two major isoforms of LEDGF.\n\nImaging of RTC/PIC revealed that CPSF6 knock-down or the A77V mutation had little or no effect on trafficking of the RTC/PIC to the nuclear envelope, while nuclear import was severely impaired in both cases. HIV-1 RTC/PIC accumulated close to the nuclear envelope under these conditions, indicating that the viral replication complexes were impeded or arrested at this site. RTC/PIC accumulation at the nuclear envelope was also observed for WT HIV-1 infection with normal CPSF6 levels at early, but not at late time points p.i., indicating that transfer across the nuclear envelope is a rate-limiting step as recently suggested (Burdick et al., 2017).\n\nIn agreement with several recent studies (e.g. Burdick et al., 2017), nuclear import of the HIV-1 post-entry complex did not require reverse transcription, but was affected by depletion of CPSF6 or lack of CPSF6 binding (Chin et al., 2015; Ambrose et al., 2012; Price et al., 2012). Few nuclear subviral complexes were observed in these cases and reverse transcription positive complexes were largely retained at nuclear pores. Infection of macrophages was only two- to threefold reduced under these conditions, however. This relatively modest effect may be due to the presence of residual CPSF6, since HIV-1 infection preferentially occurred in cells retaining a threshold level of CPSF6. Furthermore, infectivity was scored on the bulk population of macrophages with incomplete CPSF6 knock-down, while low CPSF6-expressing cells were selected in the imaging experiments.\n\nIt should also be considered that HIV-1 RTC/PIC arrested at or close to the nuclear pore in the absence of sufficient CPSF6 recruitment may eventually integrate into chromosomal DNA even without release from the nuclear basket, thus contributing to the observed infection rate. Integration at the NPC and possibly without full release from the nuclear basket is supported by accumulation of HIV-1 proviral DNA in the nuclear periphery for HIV-1 variants with defective CPSF6 binding and for CPSF6 depletion (Chin et al., 2015; Achuthan et al., 2018). It may also explain the altered integration site profile observed for CPSF6 binding defective HIV-1 variants (Schaller et al., 2011; Saito et al., 2016b) and upon CPSF6 depletion (Sowd et al., 2016; Rasheedi et al., 2016; Achuthan et al., 2018).\n\nBoth Nup153 and CPSF6 bind preferentially to the CA hexamer (Price et al., 2014), indicating that at least some capsid lattice is retained upon transfer through the NPC in MDM. This is consistent with our observation that a strong CA signal is observed on almost all nuclear HIV-1 complexes in these cells. Several recent studies have reported absent or low CA immunostaining on nuclear HIV-1 structures (Zhou et al., 2011; Hulme et al., 2015; Mamede et al., 2017), and we were unable to detect a clear CA signal on nuclear complexes in HeLa-based reporter cell lines as well (Peng et al., 2014). In contrast, CA was easily detected on almost all nuclear RTC/PIC of HIV-1 infected MDM, and signal intensities were similar or only slightly reduced when compared to cytoplasmic HIV-1 derived structures detected in the same cell. While this does not prove the presence of an intact HIV-1 capsid, the presence of CA on almost all nuclear complexes, the intensity of the CA signal and the known dependence of CPSF6 binding on the assembled CA hexamer suggest that nuclear HIV-1 replication complexes in infected MDM retain at least a large fraction of their CA coat and expose hexameric binding sites to interacting cellular factors. Whether this complex comprises the entire capsid, a partially uncoated capsid, or a capsid-derived structure stabilized by other factors needs to be investigated by ultrastructural analyses. Stabilization of an incomplete capsid by host factor binding is supported by the recent observation that PF74, binding to the same interface as CPSF6 and Nup153, can stabilize partially disassembled capsids in vitro (Márquez et al., 2018). Using a slightly different imaging-based approach, Francis and Melikyan (2018) recently reported HIV-1 capsid uncoating at the nuclear envelope, preceding nuclear import of subviral complexes. However, there are pronounced differences in the detection of CA signals on nuclear HIV-1 replication complexes in different cell types (Peng et al., 2014), and this apparent discrepancy may simply reflect cell-type specific differences in the mechanism of HIV-1 nuclear import.\n\nUsing two-color 2D and 3D STED microscopy, we provide direct proof that HIV-1 RTC/PIC at the nuclear envelope are associated with NPC in almost all cases. Accordingly, lack of CPSF6 interaction arrests or delays the HIV-1 replication complex at or within the NPC. A recent report suggested that CPSF6-capsid interactions allow subviral complexes to penetrate deeper into the nucleus of HEK293T- and primary CD4+ T-cells for integration, while loss of CPSF6 interaction led to integration into transcriptionally repressed lamina-associated heterochromatin (Achuthan et al., 2018). This may be due to integration of arrested PICs adjacent to the nuclear basket or may indicate an additional role of CPSF6 in intranuclear trafficking of viral PIC. The distance between the peak CA and Nup153 signals in our study was ca. 70 nm, with the CA signal oriented towards the cytoplasmic side. CPSF6, on the other hand, accumulated adjacent to Nup153, but clearly localized towards the nucleoplasm; this CPSF6 clustering was dependent on CA. Taken together, these results suggest that a strongly CA-positive HIV-1 replication complex retaining at least a partial hexameric lattice is arrested inside the pore of the NPC. The central pore is ca. 40–90 nm long, with filaments extending 50–75 nm on both sides (Beck et al., 2004). Accordingly, a single HIV-1 capsid or capsid-derived structure of ca. 100 nm in length (Briggs et al., 2003) could span the pore. It can concomitantly present numerous CA epitopes at a peak distance of 70 nm from the nuclear basket towards the cytoplasm and induce strong CA hexamer dependent CPSF6 binding on the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear basket. Tight association with the pore channel and the CPSF6 cluster may partially obscure antibody detection of CA, but the strong CA signal on nuclear complexes indicates that CA is largely retained after NPC passage. CPSF6 recruited to this capsid-derived structure at the nuclear basket might displace Nup153, thereby freeing Nup153 molecules of this NPC to progressively bind to upstream CA hexamers and thus promote nuclear import. Accordingly, abundant nuclear CPSF6 competing Nup153 from the common interface results in the observed large CPSF6 clusters on HIV-1 complexes at the nuclear basket and may eventually cause their release into the nucleoplasm. This model thus proposes consecutive and competitive binding of Nup153 and CPSF6 to the CA lattice on HIV-1 replication complexes as driving force for their nuclear entry; a graphic depiction of the model is shown in Figure 8.\n\nFigure 8\n\nWe realize that the width of 60 nm at the wide end of the cone shaped HIV-1 capsid (Briggs et al., 2003) exceeds the width of the NPC translocation channel of ca. 40 nm (Beck et al., 2004), and the capsid-derived structure may be modulated to fit these size requirements. Further studies applying (correlative) cryo-electron microscopy will be needed to define the ultrastructure of this HIV-1 capsid-derived structure at the NPC and to determine whether the NPC structure changes during nuclear translocation of such a large cargo. The experimental system described in this report seems ideally suited to address these important questions, which are relevant not only for HIV-1 biology, but for understanding nuclear transport of large cargo and the flexibility of the NPC in general."
