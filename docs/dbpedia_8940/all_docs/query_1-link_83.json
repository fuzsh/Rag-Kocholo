But 35-year-old guard Corey Williams kept the visitors in touch with his two-pointer midway through the first period.\n\nHarper also contributed to the league leaders, as he nailed a long three-pointer to give his side a 33-19 lead into the second quarter.\n\nSagesse kept up their rhythm in the second, thanks to another 3-pointer from Aaron Harper who would eventually finish the night with 33 points.\n\nBejjeh did not only struggle on defense, but their offense was not any better, with Julian Khazzouh delivering a superb block to deny Harold Jamison from scoring inside.\n\nWilliams tried to take the game on his shoulders for his side, but his final tally consisting of 27 points along 12 rebounds was not enough for the visitors to clinch their second win in a row, following their victory over city rivals Byblos last weekend.\n\nOnly two players from Sagesse managed to score in double digits – Harper and Sims combined for 63 points with the shooting guard Harper finishing with game-high 33 points.\n\nKhazzouh also registered 9 points and 9 rebounds for the victors, with 10 players from the home side putting their names on the score sheet.\n\nMouttahed will visit Hoops Thursday hoping to keep up their winning streak after recently beating Anibal Zahle and Amchit.\n\nThe Tripoli side currently lie in fifth position and a win would see them back among the top teams. They will hope to build on their recent performances, after the arrival of American veteran guard Eric Chatfield added a cutting edge to the roster.\n\nThey haven’t lost a match since Chatfield joined in place of fellow point guard Kevin Houston.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoops will hope their young squad will put in a good fight as they did against Amchit last week.\n\nLBL Season 2012/2013\n\nWeek 5:\n\nThursday November 22:\n\nAnibal (Zahle) v/s Antranik (Beirut) 6h00PM (SSCC - Rassieh) (WILL BE POSTPONED FOR FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER 2012) (+1D)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nHoops (Beirut) 62-92 Mouttahed (Tripoli)\n\nQ1: 16-18, Q2: 27-32, Q3: 42-62, Q4: 62-92\n\nStats:\n\nHoops:\n\n-Larry Blair 24pts, 2Rbs, 4Ass (11/26 FG + 1/6 3's + 1/1 FT) (Added 1 Steal + 3 TO) in 38 min\n\n-Ersid Ljuca 14pts, 11Rbs, 1Ass (5/14 FG + 0/1 3's + 4/9 FT) (Added 1 Steal + 1 Block + 6 TO) in 35 min\n\n-Amir Eid 7pts, 4Rbs, 1Ass (3/5 FG + 0/1 3's + 1/2 FT) (Added 1 TO) in 12 min\n\n-Hassan Lakis 5pts, 2Rbs, 1Ass (2/7 FG + 0/4 3's + 1/2 FT) (Added 1 Steal + 1 TO) in 17min\n\n-Edgard Hadidian 4pts, 1Rb (2/2 FG) in 3 min\n\n-Hussein Kanso 3pts, 1Rb, 2Ass (1/5 FG + 1/4 3's) (Added 2 Steals + 1 TO) in 33 min\n\n-Hussein Tawbe 3pts, 6Rbs, 3 Ass (1/5 FG + 1/2 FT) (Added 1 Steal + 1 Block + 3 TO) in 30 min\n\n-Ali Fakhreddine 2pts, 3Rbs (1/3 FG + 0/1 3's) (Added 1 Block + 1 TO) in 12 min\n\nMouttahed:\n\n-Marc Salyers 26pts, 12Rbs, 3Ass (9/19 FG + 1/4 3's + 7/10 FT) (Added 2 Steals + 1 Block + 2 TO) in 35 min\n\n-Eric Chatfield 16pts, 1Rb, 4Ass (5/10 FG + 2/5 3's + 4/6 FT) (Added 3 TO) in 30 min\n\n-Bassel Bawji 13pts, 14Rbs, 2Ass (6/12 FG + 0/1 3's + 1/2 FT) (Added 3 Steals + 2 TO) in 32 min\n\n-Rony Fahed 10pts, 1Rb, 9Ass (4/11 FG + 1/6 3's + 1/2 FT) (Added 2 Steals + 1 TO) in 28 min\n\n-Hassan Dandach 10pts, 1Rb, 3Ass (4/4 FG + 1/1 3s + 1/2 FT) (Added 1 Steal + 2 TO) in 15 min\n\n-Mohammad Akkari 6pts, 1Ass (2/6 FG + 2/6 3's) (Added 2 Steals + 1 TO) in 12 min\n\n-Bachir Amoury 5pts, 9Rbs, 2Ass (2/4 FG + 1/3 3's) (Added 1 TO) in 21 min\n\n-Roy Samaha 4pts, 4Rbs (2/3 FG) (Added 3 TO) in 19 min\n\n-Marwan Ziade 2pts, 1Rb, 1Ass (1/2 FG) in 5 min\n\nChampville Maristes Just Replaced Dwayne Jones (211-C)(USA) With Mohamed Kone (211-C)(CIV-FRA) !!\n\nKone is a Huge player ,Huge profile and CV ,hope he'll adapt with Champville ,this players is just Great but it's not about Resumes ,Many EX-NBA And high Level players (Huge Profiles) didn't succeed in our League ,because our Lebanese League is considered one of the hardest in League in All Asia !
