In a Swedish maternity hospital in 1914, three women prepare to give birth, their stories told through flashbacks. Gio Petré’s level-headed aristocrat Angela is seduced by her aunt’s former lover, Harriet Andersson’s “cheerfully promiscuous” maid/model Adga’s ambitious nobleman lover has secured her a gay husband, and Gunnel Lindblom’s Adele is the embitered wife of a tenant farmer, whose child is stillborn. Abridged by the director and then-husband David Hughes from Fröknarna von Pahlen, the seven-volume novel by pioneer Swedish feminist writer Agnes von Krusenstjerna (subject of Mai’s 1986 biopic AMOROSA), and shot by frequent Bergman collaborator Sven Nyqvist, Zetterling’s feature debut caused a furor for its frank sexuality, lesbian relationships, and graphic scenes of childbirth.

Reviews

“One of the most ambitious debuts since CITIZEN KANE”

– Kenneth Tynan

“LOVING COUPLES has several startlingly explicit scenes—a panorama of aberrations; an on-screen birth; and, for those bored with sex by human beings, sex by a pair of terriers. Miss Zetterling feels she has limited the sex to what supports the story.”

– Joanne Stang
