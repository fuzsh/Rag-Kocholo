        "text": "It wouldn’t be a Hallmark Channel movie without chemistry between the two leads … and sometimes the love isn’t just onscreen! Three years after Carlos and Alexa PenaVega wed in 2014, they starred in the made-for-TV film Enchanted Christmas. The pair have gone on to costar in their own Hallmark Movies & Mysteries franchise, Picture Perfect Mysteries. Eric Winter and Roselyn Sanchez, who tied the knot in 2008, collaborated on Hallmark’s A Taste of Summer in 2019. “We had a blast but our process is very different. This was a lighthearted romantic comedy, so there was no point in us being all crazy serious. I goof around on set and have fun with everybody,” Winter exclusively told Us Weekly at the time. “Roselyn was so serious. I was looking at her like, ‘Why do you look like you want to kill me? We’re working together, we’re supposed to be falling in love!'” Colin O'Donnell revealed via Instagram in December 2019 that he felt “pretty darn lucky” to work with his wife, Patti Murin, in Love on Iceland.

I’m not kidding you. I’m, like, leaning on the table and he’s saying his lines and I just like, I think I like almost fell over,” Cassidy gushed to Us, confessing that she and Huszar later realized they first began falling for each other “30 seconds apart” while filming the “same scene.”\n\nCredit: Crown Media United States\n\nChris McNally and Julie Gonzalo\n\nThe pair met while filming 2018's The Sweetest Heart, where they played exes who reunited after 14 years apart. Fans speculated for years after the film that the two were actually dating, and they confirmed their relationship status when they announced in June 2022 that they welcomed their first child together. The baby's birth was a surprise to fans since neither publicly revealed they were expecting. In October 2023, the twosome reunited onscreen for Hallmark’s 3 Bed, 2 Bath, 1 Ghost.\n\nCredit: David Dolsen/Crown Media\n\nCarlos and Alexa PenaVega\n\nAfter making their joint Countdown to Christmas debut in 2017’s Enchanted Christmas, the duo went on to star in several Hallmark movies together, including 2018’s Love at Sea and the Picture Perfect Mysteries films. They reunited onscreen for Hallmark’s 2022 rom-com Love in the Limelight and 2023’s Never Too Late to Celebrate.\n\nThe twosome share sons Ocean King and Kingston James, born in 2016 and 2019, respectively, and welcomed daughter Rio in May 2021. The PenaVegas announced in November 2023 that they are expecting their fourth baby.\n\nCredit: MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nVictor Webster and Shantel VanSanten\n\nAfter meeting on the set of 2017’s Love Blossoms, Webster and VanSanten started dating. In February 2021, the One Tree Hill alum revealed that Webster had proposed.\n\n“We hiked 2000ft to the top of the mountain where @iamvictorwebster told me he loved me for the first time years ago! What happened next still has me in shock … He told me he wanted to spend forever with me, as he got down on one knee and asked if I would marry him!!” the actress wrote via Instagram. “I didn’t say anything for awhile, not out of suspense although it would have been a good prank, but because my legs stopped working, I had to sit down and I couldn’t stop crying and kissing him … I forgot to say anything at all … BUT OBVIOUSLY I SAID YES!!! I cant wait to spend FOR-EV-ER with my best friend!!!! I F—KING LOVE YOU.”\n\nThey tied the knot three times in 2021. After less than two years of marriage, Webster filed for divorce. He listed their date of separation as January 10, 2023."
