Very Good Condition.\n\nOriginal Prominent Films One Sheet Poster (27x41) for the Mai Zetterling drama, ALSKANDE PAR (1964) [American Title: LOVING COUPLES] starring Harriet Andersson, Gunnel Lindblom, and Gio Petre. This film chronicles three women about to give birth in a Stockholm hospital in 1915. The women are from different, but related backgrounds and tell their stories via extended flashbacks. The film explores the themes of male homosexuality and lesbianism, which was controversial in the 1960s; so, the film was marketed as a sexploitation film to American audiences. This original one sheet poster is folded and in very good condition.\n\nMAI ZETTERLING - Director"
