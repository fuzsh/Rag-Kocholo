        "text": "CANNES, France — In “Loving,” which was unveiled here on Monday to raves, the director Jeff Nichols tells the story of Richard and Mildred Loving, the interracial couple whose 1958 marriage broke Virginia’s anti-miscegenation law and eventually led to the landmark Supreme Court ruling that deemed marriage a human right.\n\n“I truly believe this is one of the most pure love stories in American history,” Mr. Nichols said at a news conference here on Monday about the white Southern construction worker, played by the Australian actor Joel Edgerton, and his African-American wife, played by the Ethiopian-Irish actress Ruth Negga.\n\nThe Lovings wed in Washington, and returned to their native Virginia, only to be arrested. Their prison sentences were suspended on the condition that they leave the state for 25 years, a ruling they eventually defied. As the civil rights movement gained momentum, the A.C.L.U. took on their case, and in 1967 the Supreme Court ruled in their favor in Loving v. Virginia.\n\n“The court case is fascinating; how these lawyers got this case to the Supreme Court could make a movie in and of itself,” said Mr. Nichols, who also wrote the screenplay. “I didn’t want to make that movie,” he added. “I wanted to make a movie about two people in love.”\n\nThe film has received strong reviews, with critics noting Mr. Nichols’s understated direction and strong performances by Mr. Edgerton and Ms. Negga. At the news conference, Ms. Negga was asked if she was ready to win an Academy Award.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
