        "text": "Welcome to Watchmojo and today we’ll be counting down our picks for the top 20 on screen couples from film and TV who, despite their performances, hated each other in real life. Which couple were you surprised to see on the list? Let us know in the comments!\n\n#30: Humphrey Bogart & Audrey Hepburn\n\n“Sabrina” (1954)\n\nThe filming of “Sabrina” was rife with personal drama and stirring romanticism. Audrey Hepburn and William Holden had a short but well-known affair during filming, although Audrey quickly called it off after learning that William had had a vasectomy and could not have children. Meanwhile, Humphrey Bogart wanted his wife Lauren Bacall to play the titular Sabrina, and was therefore quite hostile towards Hepburn, as she had stolen his wife’s spotlight. He also complained about what he believed to be her general inexperience and criticized her acting ability, saying she often had to do too many takes. The joke’s on him – Audrey ended up being nominated for an Oscar, while he was left cranky and perturbed.\n\n#29: Jamie Dornan & Dakota Johnson\n\n“Fifty Shades of Grey” (2015)\n\nLet’s get this out of the way first – Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson do not HATE each other, and they get along well enough NOW But there was a time when things seemed a little…awkward between the two of them. Fans continuously pointed out their palpable lack of chemistry on press tours, and many websites singled out their uncomfortable presence at the 2017 Oscars. Director James Foley also claims that they didn’t fully bond until the first movie’s press tour, so things were clearly a little off while filming “Fifty Shades of Grey.” We can’t say that we blame them for the reported awkwardness though: filming that kind of movie must be very difficult.\n\n#28: Mila Kunis & Ashton Kutcher\n\n“That ‘70s Show” (1998-2006)\n\nDespite their 2015 marriage, a long-time friend of Kutcher told Radar Online that “everyone shakes their head over the romance.” According to the source, the two were “absolutely not friends” during filming and that “they couldn’t stand working together.” We don’t know how credible this source is, but their words are backed up by Mila Kunis herself. She told Glamour that she once thought Ashton was crazy and that she started to hate him once he became famous. Apparently he thought he was all that! She also said that they had “full friendship breakups” on numerous occasions, signifying that their time together may not have been all sunshine and rainbows. Whatever the case, Kutcher now considers himself the ‘luckiest man alive’ in regards to their relationship, so things are unquestionably going great.\n\n#27: Harrison Ford & Sean Young\n\n“Blade Runner” (1982)\n\nRachael was one of Sean Young’s first movie roles, and what an introduction it was. Not only was she in one of the best science-fiction films ever (although it wasn’t considered that at the time), she got to work with none other than the brilliant and charismatic Harrison Ford. Only, she didn’t really like him. Rumors have long persisted that the two did not get along while filming “Blade Runner.” In the scene where Deckard stops Rachael from leaving his apartment, Ford reportedly pushed Young quite roughly causing her to get upset and irritated with him. Their love scene was also allegedly dubbed “the hate scene” by the production crew because the two despised filming such a passionate sequence with each other.\n\n#26: Luke Wilson & Kate Beckinsale\n\n“Vacancy” (2007)\n\nBack in 2007, Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale starred in a thriller called “Vacancy.” It followed a combative couple who are teetering on the edge of divorce as they are stalked and harassed at a creepy motel. Kate and Luke didn’t need to do too much acting to portray an antagonistic couple, because on-set sources claimed that they did not get along. The sources allege that Luke frequently did not show up to work on time and / or was hungover. In fact, he was supposedly “outwardly rude and awful to Kate.” Things apparently got so bad between them that Kate refused to act with him, instead sending out a picture with a note that said, “Read your lines to this – it will be better for both of us.”\n\n#25: Julie McCullough & Kirk Cameron\n\n“Growing Pains” (1985-92)\n\nWhile young Kirk Cameron was raised an atheist, he converted to Christianity when he was 17. This caused frustration on the set of “Growing Pains,” as he caused trouble with his co-stars and insisted that the writers remove any semblance of inappropriate content. However, it was Julie McCullough who faced the brunt of his criticism. Julie had previously posed nude for Playboy, and Kirk objected to this. The story goes that Kirk accused the producers of promoting pornography and ordered Julie to be fired. And although Kirk claims that he never called for her termination, he and Julie remain distant and are not on speaking terms. Whatever happened, it seems their growing pains were too much to bear.\n\n#24: Richard Beymer & Natalie Wood\n\n“West Side Story” (1961)\n\n“West Side Story” is a beautiful love tale, a kind of “Romeo & Juliet” for a new generation. Except that it turns out that the actress who plays the Juliet-like role, Natalie Wood, REALLY didn’t like the actor who played the Romeo-like role, Richard Beymer. Rumor has it that Natalie kept a “shit list” on her dressing room wall with the names of people she despised. And guess who was on the very top of that list? If you guessed Richard Beymer, then you get ten points. Russ Tamblyn even asked Natalie why Richard was on the list, and she simply said, “I just don’t like him.” Word has it that Richard didn’t even know about this list until Russ told him about it while they were filming “Twin Peaks” almost thirty years later.\n\n#23: Jay Mohr & Jennifer Aniston\n\n“Picture Perfect” (1997)\n\nJay Mohr is not shy about airing his dirty laundry. During an interview with Elle Magazine, Jay called working with Jennifer his most awkward interaction with a female celebrity. While he didn’t 100% confirm it was her, all signs point to Aniston being the female celeb in question. She apparently made it abundantly clear that she was not happy with his casting, as many more notable and famous actors had been screen-tested for the role. Her behavior was allegedly so antagonistic that Jay would go to his mother’s house and cry. In another interview with ESPN, he said that a bag of Doritos would last longer than a movie starring a “Friends” cast member. Few remember “Picture Perfect,” so maybe he has a point!\n\n#22: Joan Collins & John Forsythe\n\n“Dynasty” (1981-89)\n\nJoan and John played divorced couple Alexis and Blake Carrington on the popular soap opera “Dynasty.” While the two were split, their personal drama helped “Dynasty” become one of the biggest soap operas of the 80s. And it looks like Alexis and Blake’s toxic relationship was just as hostile as Joan and John’s. Joan has admitted that John didn’t like her very much and has called him “misogynistic and a bit sexist.” She also states that John lambasted her for demanding equal pay, and she was allegedly called “a diva and a bitch.” However, there seems to be no hard feelings, as Joan honored John upon his death, calling him “one of the last true gentlemen of the acting profession.”\n\n#21: Mickey Rourke & Kim Basinger\n\n“9 ½ Weeks” (1986)\n\n“9 ½ Weeks” is a controversial movie, as it involves touchy themes like sexual domination and sadomasochism. The filming was allegedly just as controversial, as Kim Basinger was reportedly treated like absolute garbage on set. According to a piece in The New York Times, director Adrian Lyne would often manipulate Basinger’s emotions and push her too far, so the crew began to grow concerned. The article also reveals that Mickey Rourke remained distant from Basinger and even helped Lyne abuse her. This included grabbing her arm, refusing to let go despite Kim’s cries and shouts, and even slapping her in the face when she fought back. The sadistic treatment eventually had a negative impact on Kim’s marriage, as she remained emotionally distant from her husband for an entire year.\n\n#20: Walter Matthau & Barbra Streisand\n\n“Hello, Dolly!” (1969)\n\n“Hello, Dolly!” had a very troublesome production, and one of its main issues was the truly bitter relationship between stars Barbra Streisand and Walter Matthau. Walter quickly grew irritated at the much younger Barbra’s insistence at shooting multiple takes, and it wasn’t long before he couldn’t even stand in the same room as the budding star. He also referred to Barbra as an incompetent actress and a “freak attraction, like a boa constrictor.” Walter even refused to kiss her, forcing the production crew to work some movie magic for their on-screen kiss. Barbra hated Walter in turn, referring to him as “old sewer mouth.” Maybe that’s why they refused to kiss…\n\n#19: Heidi Swedberg & Jason Alexander\n\n“Seinfeld” (1989-98)\n\nSusan’s untimely death from licking toxic glue is one of the most iconic moments of “Seinfeld.” It showcases the gang’s heartless and selfish mentality in the most upfront and brutal way possible, rivaling that of “Game of Thrones!” But her death was swift because her exit from the show was swift. While no one hated Heidi, Jason had issues with her comedic style and called her difficult to work with. No one really believed him until Jerry Seinfeld and Julia Louis-Dreyfus worked with her on season 7, and they quickly agreed with Jason. While Heidi was written off as a result, Jason still vouches for her, calling her “a kind [and] lovely person.”\n\n#18: Dustin Hoffman & Meryl Streep\n\n“Kramer vs. Kramer” (1979)\n\nYeah, there’s no sugar-coating it – reports say that Dustin Hoffman acted like a straight up jerk towards Meryl Streep during this film’s production. And it all started with a slap. Yes, a literal slap. Streep told The New York Times, “It was my first take in my first movie, and he just slapped me. It was overstepping.” That wasn’t the only time he allegedly abused her during this time. She also claims that he groped her breast on one occasion, threw a wine glass against a wall near her head, raised his voice and criticized her. While she’s since forgiven the inappropriate touching, it’s clear that Streep has soldiered on from the past as she’s since become one of the most acclaimed actresses of all time.\n\n#17: Jason Lee & Shannen Doherty\n\n“Mallrats” (1995)\n\nIt’s no secret that Shannen Doherty is not the easiest actress to work tiwh. She’s garnered quite the reputation over the years and is often regarded as one of the biggest divas in television history. Unfortunately for her “Mallrats” love interest, who was played by Jason Lee, she seemed to be just as problematic while working in the movies. Jason Lee apparently found Shannen very rude and difficult to work with, and he claims that she was heavily spoiled throughout the production. His comments are reminiscent of those of Jason Priestley and Alyssa Milano, both of whom have openly acknowledged Shannen’s belligerent personality and work ethic.\n\n#16: Cybill Shepherd & Bruce Willis\n\n“Moonlighting” (1985-89)\n\nCybill Shepherd is not shy about expressing her frustration with Bruce Willis. In 2005, she admitted to Entertainment Weekly that the two “hated each other.” Their co-star, Curtis Armstrong, says as much in his book “Revenge of the Nerd.” He tells a few interesting stories, like the time Cybill grew so frustrated that she threw a suitcase at the wall. There are a few theories as to why they didn’t get along. Curtis says that Cybill was called “a bitch” by the male-dominated crew. Another co-star called Bruce “an asshole.” Curtis also says that Bruce told him about an “ill-conceived ‘thing’ between him and Cybill” which led to their hostility. Whatever the case, it’s safe to say that they did not love each other.\n\n#15: Pierce Brosnan & Teri Hatcher\n\n\"Tomorrow Never Dies\" (1997)\n\nIn the franchise's eighteenth installment, Pierce Brosnan-as-Bond tries to stop a media mogul from starting World War III. Behind the scenes, the media reported that Brosnan was constantly furious with co-star Teri Hatcher, as she kept coming late to work in the morning. As it turns out, Hatcher was pregnant at the time of filming and was experiencing morning sickness. Brosnan later admitted to having said some things he shouldn't have, and has since apologized to Hatcher as he was not aware of her situation. He also told the press that everything had been blown out of proportion and that supposed feuding wasn’t as big as everyone had made it out to be. Regardless, it had still been a big deal at the time.\n\n#14: Anthony Hopkins & Shirley MacLaine\n\n\"A Change of Seasons\" (1980)\n\nThis comedy, about a married middle-aged couple in which each member begins an affair with younger people, stars Anthony Hopkins and Shirley MacLaine as the hitched pair in question. While they may be married in the film, Hopkins despised working with MacLaine in reality and reportedly called her \"the most obnoxious actress he’d ever worked with.\" The film itself was not critically well received, as demonstrated by its three Razzie Award nominations; however MacLaine’s lively performance at least helped make the duo’s relationship seem realistic on screen.\n\n#13: Selma Blair & Charlie Sheen\n\n“Anger Management” (2012-14)\n\nWhatever you do, do not tell Charlie Sheen that he has a poor work ethic. While filming “Anger Management,” Selma Blair allegedly complained about Charlie’s lack of work ethic, as she thought he took too long to learn his lines. Word got back to Charlie, and according to an insider, he “flew off the handle,” creating “an awkward and toxic” situation. Sheen retaliated by firing Blair via a nasty text message in which he allegedly called her the c-word. However, Sheen says that they were planning on writing Blair’s character off anyway to make the show and Charlie’s character more interesting. Regardless, Selma lawyered up and demanded $1.2 million in lost wages.\n\n#12: Patrick Swayze & Jennifer Grey\n\n\"Dirty Dancing\" (1987)\n\nThese two did not have the time of their lives on set. See what we did there? This romantic drama features Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze as a student and resort dance instructor who fall in love during her summer vacation. While they may be almost too-hot-to-handle on camera, Swayze found Grey incredibly difficult as a co-lead in real life, calling her too silly and immature to work with. The pair also supposedly had trouble working together on the set of “Red Dawn” three years earlier. They must have since mended fences though, as Grey was clearly upset about Swayze's death in 2009.\n\n#11: Leonardo DiCaprio & Claire Danes\n\n\"Romeo + Juliet\" (1996)\n\nRomeo and Juliet are literature's most iconic lovers, so it's very ironic that the two leads playing them did not get along. In this 1996 modern adaptation of the famous Shakespeare play, Romeo and Juliet vie for each other, despite their respective family's constant fighting. However, in real life, Danes reported that DiCaprio was a nuisance on set, acting very immature due to his pranks on crewmembers and general goofball attitude. DiCaprio in turn called Danes stuck up and too serious. While the characters may be star-crossed lovers, the actors couldn't have been more mismatched.\n\n#10: Sophia Bush & Chad Michael Murray\n\n“One Tree Hill” (2003-12)\n\nThings were quite sweet for a while, there. Sophia and Chad grew close throughout their time on “One Tree Hill” and even married in April 2005, right before the conclusion of the second season. However, they were separated the following September and later divorced. According to a friend of Sophia, Chad didn’t share Sophia’s enthusiasm for the sanctity of marriage. Sophia later told Andy Cohen that she never wanted to marry Chad, whose rep clapped back by saying that wasn’t true and that Chad “doesn’t feel the need to engage in this type of behavior.” Ouch. It sounds like there is still some bad blood between the two.\n\n#9: Vince Vaughn & Reese Witherspoon\n\n\"Four Christmases\" (2008)\n\nThis movie stars Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon as a loving couple who hate and actively avoid their families on Christmas. So maybe it’s actually appropriate that the actors reportedly hated each other during filming. Their personalities apparently clashed on set, with Witherspoon wishing to stick to the script so that she could nail a scene while Vaughn wanted to ad-lib and work with a more easy-going approach. While both certainly talented in their own way, their chemistry on set seemed to be the antithesis of ‘holly jolly’.\n\n#8: Marilyn Monroe & Laurence Olivier\n\n\"The Prince and the Showgirl\" (1957)\n\nThis romantic comedy about a showgirl who gets involved in political intrigue caused co-stars Monroe and Olivier to despise each other by the film's end. Olivier also acted as director, and he supposedly became enraged at Monroe due to many factors, including her constant tardiness, her unpredictable acting, and her constant consulting of her acting coach. The final nail in the coffin was when Olivier told her to \"try and be sexy.\" This would not be the last time Monroe allegedly caused problems, as Tony Curtis apparently became frustrated with her two years later filming \"Some Like it Hot.\"\n\n#7: Stana Katic & Nathan Fillion\n\n“Castle” (2009-16)\n\nWhen it comes to toxic working relationships, few are as hostile as Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion’s. An anonymous source told Us (not us, Us Weekly) that Stana and Nathan “completely despise each other” and refuse to speak when the cameras aren’t rolling. In fact, things got so bad between them that they were forced into couples counseling by the producers. A second insider told Us that Nathan wasn’t well-liked by the cast and crew and that his nastiness caused Stana to cry in her dressing room. The show was cancelled in 2016, and while it’s terrible that all those people lost their jobs, it was probably for the best in this case.\n\n#6: William Baldwin & Sharon Stone\n\n\"Sliver\" (1993)\n\nThis thriller stars William Baldwin and Sharon Stone as lovers in the middle of strange occurrences in a high-rise apartment building. Throughout filming, it was said that Stone would emasculate Baldwin, which he understandably did not appreciate. During one kissing scene, Stone supposedly bit Baldwin's tongue so hard that he couldn’t talk for a few days afterwards. Things became so bad that they soon requested that they shoot their scenes separately as they were obviously not getting along. Stone even went on to say that she would have preferred filming with Baldwin's older brother Alec in his place.\n\n#5: Nick Nolte & Julia Roberts\n\n\"I Love Trouble\" (1994)\n\nThis romantic comedy stars Nick Nolte and Julia Roberts as rival reporters who fall in love while uncovering an altered milk conspiracy. Roberts has called Nolte “the worst actor she has ever worked with as well as “completely disgusting.” Nolte did not take kindly to Roberts' disdain, and shot back that she’s “not a nice person.” Things were so bad that it was reported that they acted more with stand-ins than they did with each other. Their relationship has seemingly not progressed since, as they still appear to hold animosity towards each other in the 21st century.\n\n#4: Gillian Anderson & David Duchovny\n\n“The X-Files” (1993-2002; 2016-18)\n\nDavid and Gillian’s hostile working relationship has been well-documented. Their disagreements have been known since at least 1996, when Chris Nicksen’s book told of the “fine line” between the actors’ happiness and irritability towards each other. Other reports subsequently came out over the years, many of which recounted a strained working and personal relationship. David also told Metro that they often “couldn’t stand the sight of each other,” and Gillian told The Guardian that she and David went through periods of not speaking to each other. Reports of a full-on vitriolic hatred may be exaggerated, but there’s no denying that the actors had a tense and troublesome relationship.\n\n#3: Richard Gere & Debra Winger\n\n\"An Officer and a Gentleman\" (1982)\n\nThis romantic drama tells the story of a Navy Aviation officer candidate, played by Richard Gere, who comes into conflict with his drill instructor. During filming of the famous love story, Gere and Debra Winger definitely were not what you would call good friends, with Winger referring to Gere as a \"brick wall\" when trying to converse or interact with him. His stoic personality further aggravated Winger, and the two spent no time together off-camera, with reports that they distanced themselves as far away from each other as possible in order to give each other space.\n\n#2: Ryan Gosling & Rachel McAdams\n\n\"The Notebook\" (2004)\n\nThis romantic drama, about 2 lovers who are kept from each other because of their social standings, is regarded as one of the seminal chick flicks of our generation, so it's disappointing to hear that the star-crossed lovers didn’t actually get along on set. Director Nick Cassavetes reported that Gosling tried to have McAdams replaced due to his strong negative feelings for her. This led to a therapy session that saw the co-stars having it out with each other through screaming and yelling. Perhaps this very intense dislike for each other is what helped make the on-screen couple’s passion translate so well to the big screen. Whatever the case may be, it seemed they got over their differences – albeit temporarily – as the two actors actually went on to date for a bit after the movie had been completed.\n\n#1: Vivian Vance & William Frawley\n\n“I Love Lucy” (1951-57)\n\nThese two should have received all the acting awards, because they definitely deserved them. It all started when William overheard Vivian complaining about his age, as he was 22 years older than she was. William in turn wished that Vivian would return to her home state of Kansas, and Vivian proceeded to call him names like “that stubborn-headed little Irishman.” It’s also important to note that William was a well-known alcoholic who had a reputation for being crabby and ill-tempered. The two later declined a lucrative spin-off opportunity as they didn’t want to work with each other again. And, according to Hollywood legend, Vivian jokingly ordered champagne when she heard about William’s death. Now that’s true hatred, right there."
