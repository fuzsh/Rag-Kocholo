Top Gun\n\nImage supplied by Capital Pictures/EAST NEWS, Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/East News, ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/East News\n\nTop Gun is an awesome movie from 1986, directed by Tony Scott. The stars of the show are Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis.\n\nWhen it first came out, some movie experts had different opinions about it, but everyone agreed that the cool visual effects and the music were fantastic. Just a month after it started, even more theaters started showing it because so many people wanted to see it.\n\nEven though not everyone loved it at first, Top Gun made a ton of money. It earned $357 million all over the world, and it only cost $15 million to make. That’s a lot of people who loved watching Maverick and Charlie in action!\n\n2. Blast from the Past\n\n© Cinematic / Alamy Stock Photo, Invision/Invision/East News, Siegfried Nacion/STAR MAX/IPx/Associated Press/East News\n\nBlast from the Past is a 1999 American romantic comedy science fiction movie, directed by Hugh Wilson and featuring the talented Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone. The story revolves around Adam Webber, who spent his entire life in a shelter, lovingly constructed by his father. After 35 years, he finally emerges into the modern world, and his innocence and old-fashioned beliefs create some hilarious and amusing situations as he interacts with the people of the present day.\n\nWhile this film did receive some mixed reviews from movie critics, it’s important to remember that everyone’s taste is different, and the movie became famous. For some, this quirky tale of a man out of time provides a good dose of humor and heartwarming moments.\n\n3. Green Card\n\n© Green Card / Touchstone Pictures and co-producers, Jens Kalaene/DPA/East News, Vianney Le Caer/Invision/East News\n\nGreen Card is a charming 1990 American romantic comedy-drama, brought to life by the talented Peter Weir and starring the wonderful Gérard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell. The plot revolves around an American woman who finds herself in a marriage of convenience with a Frenchman. They enter into this unique arrangement so that he can secure a green card and stay in the United States.\n\nGérard Depardieu’s outstanding performance earned him a well-deserved Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. The film itself also claimed the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy. Additionally, it received an Oscar nomination in the category of Best Original Screenplay. Green Card is a heartwarming tale of love and unexpected connections, which showcases the complexities of human relationships with humor and finesse.\n\n4. 9½ Weeks\n\nMGM/AF Archive/Mary Evans Picture Library/East News, Courtesy Everett Collection / East News, © Fifty Shades Darker / Universal Pictures and co-producers\n\n9½ Weeks, a 1986 American romantic drama, is a film directed by Adrian Lyne and stars the talented Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke. In this captivating story, Kim Basinger portrays a New York City art gallery employee who embarks on a passionate yet fleeting affair with an enigmatic Wall Street broker, brought to life by Mickey Rourke.\n\nInterestingly, the film was actually completed in 1984 but faced challenges getting to the big screen. It wasn’t until February 1986 that it finally made its debut. The film’s content was deemed too explicit for its American distributor, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which led to significant editing before its US release. Unfortunately, despite the buzz, the film struggled to make a mark at the box office in the United States, grossing $6.7 million against a $17 million budget.\n\n5. Notting Hill\n\nAlbum Online/East News, MICHAEL TRAN/AFP/East News, Jordan Strauss/Invision/East News\n\nNotting Hill, a 1999 romantic comedy film under the direction of Roger Michell, weaves a delightful story scripted by Richard Curtis and brought to life by producer Duncan Kenworthy. The film’s charming stars, Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, paint a vivid picture of romance. It unfolds the tale of an unlikely connection between a British bookseller, played by Grant, and a famous American actress, portrayed by Roberts, who serendipitously enters his bookstore in London’s Notting Hill district.\n\nThis heartwarming film was unveiled to the world on May 21, 1999, and it received widespread acclaim from critics. In fact, it claimed the title of being the highest-grossing British film of all time, proving that love stories resonate with audiences worldwide. Notting Hill also made its mark on the 57th Golden Globe Awards, securing three nominations: Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy, Best Actress in a Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy for Julia Roberts, and Best Actor in a Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy for Hugh Grant.\n\n6. Moonlighting\n\nABC/AF Archive/Mary Evans Picture Library/East News, zz/John Nacion/STAR MAX/IPx/Associated Press/East News, Jordan Strauss/Invision/East News\n\nMoonlighting was a fantastic American TV series that graced our screens from March 3, 1985, to May 14, 1989, with a total of 67 episodes aired on ABC. It starred the dynamic duo of Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis as private detectives, with Allyce Beasley adding quirky charm as their receptionist. This show was a delightful blend of comedy, mystery, and romance, paving the way for the emerging genre of “dramedy” in television.\n\nOne of the many memorable aspects of Moonlighting was its catchy theme song, co-written and performed by jazz singer Al Jarreau, which became a chart-topping hit. The series played a significant role in launching Bruce Willis into stardom and rejuvenating Cybill Shepherd’s career after a series of less successful projects.\n\n7. You’ve Got Mail\n\nWarner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News, Evan Agostini/Invision/East News, Gilbert Flores/Broadimage/Broad Image/East News\n\nReleased in 1998, You’ve Got Mail is a heartwarming American romantic comedy-drama film skillfully directed by Nora Ephron. The delightful duo of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan takes center stage in this tale inspired by the 1937 Hungarian play “Parfumerie” by Miklós László. Interestingly, this play had already seen adaptations in 1940 as “The Shop Around the Corner” and in 1949 as “In the Good Old Summertime.”\n\nNora and Delia Ephron worked together to create this charming narrative that unfolds the story of two individuals engaged in a blossoming online romance, completely unaware that they are also rivals in the business world. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan previously shared the screen in Joe Versus the Volcano (1990) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993), the latter of which was also directed by Nora Ephron.\n\n8. While You Were Sleeping\n\nCAP/RFS/Capital Pictures/East News, Invision/Invision/East News, Invision/Invision/East News\n\nReleased in 1995, While You Were Sleeping is a heartwarming American romantic comedy film, skillfully directed by Jon Turteltau. The film’s stars include Sandra Bullock in the role of Lucy, a token collector for the Chicago Transit Authority, Bill Pullman as Jack, the brother of a man whose life she saves, Peter Gallagher as Peter, the man she rescues.\n\nThis film proved to be a resounding success, both critically and commercially, earning over $182 million at the box office. Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman received well-deserved acclaim for their performances, and Sandra Bullock’s talent even earned her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Comedy or Musical. While You Were Sleeping remains a beloved classic, known for its charming storyline and memorable characters that continue to capture the hearts of audiences.\n\n9. The Wedding Singer\n\nMary Evans Picture Library / East News, Chris Pizzello/Invision/East News, ANGELA WEISS/AFP/East News\n\nThe Wedding Singer, a delightful 1998 American romantic comedy directed by Frank Coraci, stars the dynamic duo of Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, along with talented actors like Christina Pickles and Christine Taylor. The story revolves around a wedding singer in the year 1985 who unexpectedly falls in love with a waitress. This heartwarming film made its debut on February 13, 1998, and was a true gem, especially considering its budget of only $18 million, as it managed to gross $123 million worldwide.\n\nCritics and audiences alike couldn’t help but sing its praises, earning it generally positive reviews and securing a spot as one of Adam Sandler’s best comedies. The film’s charm and humor were later adapted into a stage musical of the same name, debuting on Broadway in April 2006.\n\nMovies possess a unique and enchanting power — the ability to stop time, if only for a moment. Whether it’s a heart-pounding action sequence that seems to freeze the world around it or a tender moment of connection that lingers in our hearts, movies transport us to a realm where time stands still, and we become lost in the enchanting universe of storytelling."
