        "text": "As a long-married couple, Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson share an easiness suggesting utter normalcy, a lived-in quality as comfortable as your favorite sweater, warm, snug and enveloping. Thus, the title of their exquisite movie, “Ordinary Love.” It’s set in Ireland, but could easily be down the street, even your own living room. You identify immediately, recognize yourself and those closest to you in their every action, whether it’s good-natured ribbings or daily walks along the motorway.\n\nThis is how directors Lisa Barros D’Sa and Glenn Leyburn sneakily lure you in before delivering the sucker-punch of the three words every happily married couple prays they’ll never hear: “You have cancer.” In “Ordinary Love,” it cuts like a surgeon’s scalpel, straight, deep and sure. But who does it devastate more: The wife who has it or the husband suddenly faced with the prospect of life without the person they love most?\n\nThe script by playwright Owen McCafferty rings so honestly in that regard, you’d swear he and his wife lived through it. And it turns out, they did. As a four-time survivor myself, I can attest to the accuracy of every little detail of the experiences of dealing with such an unimaginable ordeal and the challenging effects it can have on a marriage. In a word, it’s frightening, a journey into the abyss of uncertainty, an arena in which your life is placed in the hands of complete strangers.\n\nThe experience is humiliating, degrading and fraught with peril. But you suffer it because, as a hospital roommate of Manville’s Joan says, “It’s better than the alternative.” Yet, we’re also made to understand that there are times when “the alternative” might not seem so bad, especially during chemotherapy, a “cure” worse than the disease. Manville expresses this truth with almost unbearable anguish, begging for relief from nausea, the extreme shifts in body temperature and the strength-sapping power of drugs so corrosive they leave your immune system shot.\n\nYet, it’s even worse for Neeson’s Tom. He’s virtually helpless. He wants desperately to ease his wife’s suffering but can do nothing but serve as her can-cierge, managing her medications, driving her to her endless hospital appointments and waiting and waiting, the hardest part. The film’s best trick is how it subtlety elicits empathy for Joan and Tom in equal measure. Your heart breaks intensely, particularly when the rage within them builds until it bursts. This is when Neeson and Manville are most brilliant, expertly negotiating the thin line between resentment and frustration.\n\nWhere Manville leaves her co-star in the dust is in depicting how cancer is twice as traumatic for a female, especially when it comes to the vanity of losing not just your hair, but your breasts, the body part that physically defines you as a woman. Through her, we watch Joan sort through the stages of grief, a feeling of pain and loss nearly the equal of years earlier having experienced the untimely death of hers and Tom’s only child.\n\nCheery it’s not, but there’s an underlying joy in hitting the finish line of an ordeal Tom accurately likens to a marathon, a contest in which your body is put to the ultimate test, a grueling experience in which every step is a challenge that makes the reward all the sweeter. Plus, there’s Neeson and Manville. You wouldn’t think them an ideal couple; him, tall and lanky, and she, petite and refined. But you’d be wrong. They are so terrific together, you’ll long for them to be cast as a couple again.\n\nYou’re enthralled to the point you’ll rue the introduction of another couple (David Wilmont and Amit Shaw) dealing with cancer, albeit a far more invasive kind. I’m not sure why the filmmakers felt the need to add the pair beyond giving Joan another cancer victim to commiserate with. But it comes at the expense of a handful of scenes better spent taking a deeper dive into the extraordinary “ordinary” relationship between Tom and Joan, a couple all in with the “for better or worse,” but utterly unprepared for just what it means.\n\nIn the end, Joan sums it up best when she confides, “I thought cancer would change me, but it really hasn’t. And I’m kind of glad it didn’t.” After having been in her shoes myself, I could not agree more. You are what you are, and even something this big and destructive isn’t going to change it. Like the signs say, “I have cancer but cancer doesn’t have me.”\n\nAl Alexander may be reached at alexandercritica@aol.com.\n\n“Ordinary Love”\n\nCast includes Lesley Manville, Liam Neeson, David Wilmont and Amit Shaw.\n\n(R for brief sexuality, nudity.)\n\nGrade: A-"
