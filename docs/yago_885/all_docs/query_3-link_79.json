        "text": "Lily D. Moore (“Never Have I Ever”), Erica Durance (“North to Home,” “Open by Christmas”), Benjamin Ayres (“You, Me & the Christmas Trees,” “Detention\n\nAdventure”) and David DeSanctis (“Where Hope Grows”) star in “Color My World with Love,” a new original for Hallmark Movies & Mysteries. The movie recently wrapped production for airing later in 2022.\n\n“Everyone has a dream to fall in love and get married one day, even people with disabilities,” said Moore. “I hope viewers take away that ‘Color My World with Love’ is about painting your own story through your emotions and that we all have endless possibilities.”\n\nIn the film, Kendall (played by Moore) is a talented artist with Down Syndrome who creates beautiful paintings in the Impressionist style that reflect the reality of her subjects as she sees them. Thanks to the support of her mother, Emma (played by Durance), and grandmother, Bev (played by Karen Kruper, “The Wedding Veil”), Kendall is\n\nhappy and thriving. Her life takes an exciting turn when she meets Brad (played by DeSanctis) in a cooking class at the local center for diverse learners… and romance blooms.\n\nBut Emma has spent the last 22 years trying to protect her daughter and has reservations about Kendall and Brad’s new relationship, especially when it quickly moves in a serious direction. Not wanting Kendall to experience heartbreak, Emma tries to slow things down. With the help of Nic (played by Ayres), a longtime family friend of Brad’s, Emma slowly\n\naccepts that Kendall is ready to – and should – live her own life. In the process, Emma learns a lesson from Kendall about how to look beyond what’s in front of you and see the beauty that exists. And, just maybe, she finds herself ready to find love once again.\n\n“Color My World with Love” is from Spell Love Productions LTD. Orly Adelson, Jonathan Eskenas and Kimberley Bradley are executive producers. Charles Cooper is producer and Peter Benson directed.\n\nWill you watch this inclusive film?\n\nThe article header image features movie stars Lily D. Moore and David DeSanctis."
