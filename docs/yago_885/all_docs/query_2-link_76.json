        "text": "MAI ZETTERLING'S \"Night Games,\" which opened at the Festival yesterday, is the Swedish film that the directors of this year's Venice Film Festival considered too raw for public showing in their urbane festival hall. (It was shown to the jury in private, and did not win an award.)Also, it is the picture that so offended Shirley Temple that she refused to serve as a director and program chairman of the later San Francisco Festival, to signify her protest at its being shown there.The quantitative judgments of both protestants were correct. \"Night Games\" is loaded with material of the most explicit and licentious sort. In telling a symbolistic story of a man's turbulent efforts to gain release from the sexual and emotional inhibitions that a grotesque childhood with a depraved mother have forced on him, it has no restraint in showing many intimate, crude and shocking things in a perverted mother-son relation that do look awfully raw on the screen.Indeed, they look so raw and calculated, so deliberately overdrawn—and sometimes so ponderous and clumsy in their Freudian symbolism — that one might guess Miss Zetterling is either out to shock us with all the shock stuff that she can command, including several post-Fellini orgies, or she is mischievously putting us on.I would rather suspect the latter, for I cannot otherwise comprehend what would be her purpose in doing so many extravagantly bold and bizarre things that appear beyond any likely context of any level of Scandinavian life.Why would she start her hero's groping through the dusty chambers of his mother's old home and through the the painful recollections of his distorted past with a flash-back scene of the mother giving birth to a stillborn child in the presence of a gathering of musicians and revelers that looks like a mob celebrating Mardi Gras? Where in Sweden did anyone ever do anything like that?There are many such things in this picture that convey an outrageous idea of a mother's voracious maneuvers to corrupt and consume her son.But all of these things舒and there are many, including symptoms of homosexual bent showing up early in the youngster, when he rouges and adorns his face—give us little understanding of the mother, except that she's a monster of some sort. And an aged great-aunt who tries to lead the lad in another direction is just as obscure.Thus we are shown in \"Night Games\" only a set of grotesque memories placed against current endeavors of the hero to reach a normal relationship with a hopeful girl. And when he finally banishes his memories and his inhibitions by dynamiting the house in which all these distracting things happened, it is a much too easy and romantic out.Ingrid Thulin is spectacularly brazen as the mother, without revealing more than a sense of pain, and Jorgen Lindstrom is uncomfortably voluptuous in appearance and movement as the 9-year-old boy. Keve Hjelm is self-consciously mannered in the role of the son as a man, and Lena Brundin is like a pallid zombie as the girl he wants to love. Incidentally, she looks a lot like Miss Thulin, which is supposed to have significance, of course.Miss Zetterling, who also wrote the novel on which he and David Hughes's screenplay is based, has skill and an eye for color in creating visual images. But she takes us through a chamber of horrors without shedding any real light in \"Night Games.\"\n\nNIGHT GAMES; screenplay by Mai Zetterling and David Hughes; based on Miss Zetterling's novel of the same name; directed by Miss Zetterling; produced by Sandrews; a Gaston Hakim presentation released through Mondial Films, Inc.

Naima WifstrandSINCE kidding the Establishment, any Establishment, is big business in Britain, the company that created \"The Spy With a Cold Nose\" cannot be faulted for following the scent of success. But spoofing a movie genre that is itself a spoof takes a specialized ingenuity that this \"Spy\" only occasionally shows. Laurence Harvey, Lionel Jeffries and the free-wheeling troupe at the Lincoln Art and the R.K.O. 23d and 58th Street Theaters energetically try to make a clown of the likes of James Bond, and succeed largely in merely being clownish themselves.The basic idea of this caper is original and funny, as in some of the dialogue and a few of the sight gags. We have here the wonderfully foolish notion, dreamed up by Lionel Jeffries as the most blatant bumbler in British Counter-Intelligence, of implanting an electronic bug in a bulldog sent as a gift to the Soviet premier. Thus, Her Majesty's government will have a virtually undetectable superspy \"with a cold nose,\" right in the Kremlin. Mr. Harvey, a foppish, successful, society veterinarian with a sullied past and a yen for a knighthood, is the boy who does the job on the jowly, sniffing spy, Disraeli. Then, of course, both the vet and our clumsy snooper get caught up in chases that lead them to Moscow and back to London.Mr. Jeffries, as the bald, irascible associate of Peter Sellers and other top comics in other English japes, has proven himself an ace buffoon. He is fine here as the lunkhead who always manages to keep his investigative spirits up. Mr. Harvey's caricature of a somewhat delicate social climber is also broad, but amateurish in comparison with Mr. Jeffries's apoplectic comedy. Daliah Lavi, the curvaceous brunette beauty, who has served as a movie Mata Hari before, again is a spying siren and shows off her attributes in a mod wardrobe revealing enough to make men's eyes boggle.\"We are the Secret Service.\" Mr. Jeffries pompously says at one point. \"Not all of it. I hope,\" Mr. Harvey retorts. And the other principals—Eric Sykes, as Mr. Jeffries's fumbling assistant, Paul Ford, as an obvious, amorous American general; Robert Flemyng and Denholm Elliott, as snobbish intelligence officers—prove it in contributing comic mites to what amounts to transparently genial ribbing but mild merriment at best.\n\nThe CastTHE SPY WITH A COLD NOSE; original story and screenplay by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson; directed by Darriel Petrie; produced by Leonard Lightstone; executive producer, Joseph E.

DisraeliMIREILLE DARC, in the title role of \"Galia,\" is a girl for all seasons and a sparkling ornament for any man's Christmas tree. The bubbly extroversion of this new young French actress, a rounded squirrel of a blonde who makes Doris Day seem rickety, is the chief attraction of this sleek but disjointed film that opened yesterday at the 34th Street East and 72d Street Playhouse. As a French-Italian co-production, the picture is medium; the lady is rare.The Zenith International release, written by Vahe Katcha and directed with crisp, knowing sophistication by Georges Lautner, gets off to a good, original start and sustains an intriguing half-hour or so.As a briskly amoral young girl about Paris, the heroine hauls a suicidal matron from the Seine, impulsively installs the petulant lady in her apartment and hears her tale of woe, the old, wronged-wife saw. Galia then stalks the errant husband, a satyrish charmer, annexes him and presently finds herself the wide-eyed apex of a dangerous triangle with the couple of older, neurotic worldlings. Led by her own pert nose, Galia lands in a jam that serves her right.The rest of the movie is a psychological teaser, with the smitten Miss Darc balking at her new lover's basic decadence and also backtracking home for more murderous looks from her lingering house guest. Something's got to give and it does—the picture.It's just too bad that the lady known as Galia couldn't wiggle out of her own mess the way she wiggles out of her clothes."
