        "text": "Intimate photographs of the real life interracial couple who inspired Oscar nominated movie Loving demonstrate the powerful bond between them that helped change history.\n\nThe beautiful images featured in new book, The Lovings: An Intimate Portrait , were taken as the couple fought a landmark US civil rights case to overturn a law prohibiting interracial marriage.\n\nPhotojournalist Grey Villet, working for theLife magazine, spent time with Mildred and Richard at their home, following as they went about their daily life surrounded by friends and family, as the history making trial played out around them.\n\nThe story of married couple Mildred and Richard Loving’s incredible and enduring romance was told in the critically acclaimed Hollywood film, which scored Ruth Negga an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress and brought the Lovings’ story to a whole new audience.\n\nAfrican American Mildred, who also had Native American heritage, and Richard, a white man, were arrested in 1958 in Virginia, USA and sentenced to one year in prison for the crime of marrying each other, as the state banned marriage between white and black people.\n\nThey had wed in Washington DC, as interracial marriage was not illegal in that state, and returned to Virginia afterwards, but around five weeks later, local authorities arrested them after bursting into the couple's bedroom early one morning.\n\nThe Lovings were accused of violating another Virgina law which banned marrying elsewhere then returning to a place where interracial marriage was against the law.\n\nAfter pleading guilty to interracial marriage, they were sentenced to one year in prison, suspended so as long as they left Virginia and did not return for 25 years.\n\nBut the Lovings, who had moved to Washington DC after the trial, wanted to return to Virginia and set about trying to get the judge to change his mind.\n\nTheir legal action began when Mildred wrote to Attorney General Robert F Kennedy asking for help moving back to Virginia, as the couple missed their family.\n\nKennedy forwarded the letter to the American Civil Liberties Union, who took up Mildred's plea and assigned a young lawyer to the case.\n\nTwo initial attempts to overturn their conviction were denied, but success finally came when the issue was brought before the US Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1967, the US Supreme Court unanimously overturned the couple’s convictions, saying marriage was a “basic civil right of man” and the law gives people the freedom to marry regardless of race.\n\nThe court declared the remaining US anti-miscegenation laws illegal, paving the way for other interracial couples to marry without prejudice in states where that had previously been denied to them.\n\nHowever, the Lovings remained modest about their ground breaking achievement, with Richard telling theLife magazine: \"We have thought about other people, but we are not doing it just because somebody had to do it and we wanted to be the ones.\n\n“We are doing it for us, because we want to live here.\"\n\nRichard died in 1975 after his car was struck by a drunk driver.\n\nMildred, who was injured in the incident and never remarried, passed away at home n 2008 from pneumonia."
