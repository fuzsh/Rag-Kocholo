        "text": "Richard and Mildred Loving’s marriage became the subject of a landmark ruling when, in 1967, the US supreme court ruled that the couple’s arrest under state law that said that inter-racial couples couldn’t marry was unconstitutional. Jeff Nichols’s biopic, which follows the couple during the Loving v Virginia trial and stars Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga, premiered at the Cannes film festival in May and is released in the UK on 3 February 2017"
