        "text": "There is such unassuming artistry and maturity in this sweet, sad, wise movie by Ira Sachs, who has shown a flair for relationship nuance in films such as Keep the Lights On (2012) and his noir drama Married Life (2007). This is his best work yet: a wonderfully acted study in intimacy and the mystery of how much of our identity is invested in coupledom, especially in the long haul of marriage. Love is strange, says the title. Perhaps it gets stranger the longer you stay in love.\n\nJohn Lithgow and Alfred Molina play Ben and George, a gay couple in late middle age who live in New York City. Ben is an artist who is the financially dependent one; George is a music teacher at a Catholic school who pays the bills on the apartment they have recently bought. After living together for 40 years, Ben and George take advantage of recent changes in state law and get married. The exuberant reception at their place for a wide, loving circle of friends and relatives is a happy affair, more an anniversary party than a wedding. It reminded me, perhaps oddly, of the family parties in Woody Allen’s Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), in which the characters played by Lloyd Nolan and Maureen O’Sullivan start singing boozily – but those traces of melancholy and regret are absent here. Later, Ben amiably says he spent the afternoon at the cinema, seeing a revival of Busby Berkeley’s The Gang’s All Here. Another very Woody Allen moment.\n\nAll the guests had themselves made a kind of commitment: to redouble their friendship and love for the happy couple. But no one could have imagined how soon they would be expected to redeem this pledge. George is fired from his job by church authorities who disapprove of the gay wedding, though they were happy enough with the deniable hypocrisy of his merely having a roommate. Unable to meet their mortgage payments, these two men suffer an unthinkable catastrophe: in what they imagined to be the comfortable evening of their lives, they become homeless refugees, having to split up temporarily and live separately with two sets of friends who, with strained generosity, take them in.\n\nTheir humiliation is complete as we realise that each man is with the wrong host: hard-working George is billeted with a laid-back couple of gay cops who like noisy parties and get-togethers in the evening; after a hard day teaching private pupils, George comes back wanting peace and gets none. He would have been better off with Kate (Marisa Tomei) and Elliot (Darren Burrows), whose ordered but strained family life is put under further stress by genial Ben, who has the bunk bed in their teenage son’s room and does nothing all day but hang around getting under Kate’s feet. Their chaotic situation would be amusingly suited to bohemian foreign-exchange students; for grown, ageing men, it is almost shocking.\n\nWhat is even more disquieting for each is the revelation that, agonising though the situation is, it can work – after a fashion. They can get by. Their love is real enough, but they can function as individuals, as single people. It is as if they are young again – messy and troublesome kids living with their parents, meeting up for dates and illicit sex, yet what they are concealing is not their sexuality but the fear of disaster, the fear of ending their days in poverty and failure, with the relationship that they thought was the bedrock of their existence shattered, almost casually.\n\nYet Ben and George are vouchsafed something long-term couples rarely have: a vision of what remains of them as individuals, a demonstration of the fact that individuals are what they inevitably are, and not some platonic fusion. It is a guide, of sorts, to how they might function without each other – and how, indeed, they will one day have to do this.\n\nThis is a film of great gentleness and subtlety. Sachs arguably sucker-punches us at the end by omitting one key scene, and yet when the truth about this omission dawns on the audience, it confers retrospective power on what has gone before. Lithgow and Molina give excellent performances in a film composed in a reflective minor key."
