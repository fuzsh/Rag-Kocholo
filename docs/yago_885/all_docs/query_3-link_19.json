        "text": "Their debut documentary feature film You and Me (2014) premiered at Visions du Réel and won several awards at Cartagena IFF, Trinidad & Tobago IFF, Havana IFF, Márgenes, Austin and Santo Domingo, among others. Their second documentary film Site of Sites (2016), supported by DOCTV Latinoamérica, premiered at IDFA – International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam. The film was presented in the US at the Neighboring Scenes Showcase of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, was official selection at Biarritz, Cartagena and Lima, and was listed as one of the 25 best Latin American films of 2017 by Cinema Tropical.\n\nMiriam Lies (2018) is the couple’s first fiction feature film, co-produced by the Catalan arthouse production company Mallerich Films Paco Poch, with support of Fonprocine, the Ibermedia programme and the Latin America Fund of the Tribeca Film Institute.\n\nThe film premiered in the official competition of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, where it obtained a special mention from the jury. Later, it was awarded with the Golden Colon for Best Film at the Huelva Ibero-American Film Festival, the ALMA Award for Best Spanish Film Script at the Gijón International Film Festival, Best Director at the Punta del Este Festival, the SFCC Award from the French Critics at Cinélatino Toulouse, among others.\n\nMiriam Miente is considered among the most notable films of Latin American cinema and is particularly outstanding within the showcase of Dominican Republic cinema, winning in 2020 the award for Best Film at the ADOCINE Awards of the Dominican film industry and the ADOPRESCI critics awards.\n\nA Film About Couples (2021) is their latest work. The film was screened at the Locarno, Rome, Miami, Hamburg and Cartagena International Film Festivals. It won the best film award from the Syndicat Français de la Critique de Cinéma, and a special mention from the jury at the Biarritz Latin American Film Festival. It also won three awards at the Gijón International Film Festival, including Best Spanish Film and Best Director.\n\n“Spectators of our films often ask us what it’s like to co-direct as a couple. It’s a question whose answer changes according to the day. Sometimes we can share crazy anecdotes about our struggles of egos or about our bittersweet quests to achieve the films we set out to make. Other times we argue and wonder if it’s worth continuing. But like most couples, we move on, trying to show the best side of our relationship and our persona.\n\nOne day, we realized that it was very important for both of us to share the creative challenge of trying to make cinema with another person who is dissimilar from you because of differences of sex, culture, and personality and the vital challenge it can be if you are also in love with this person.”\n\n– Natalia & Uri, Directors"
