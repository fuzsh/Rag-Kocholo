        "text": "Ross and Rachel. Carrie and Big. Edward and Bella. Romeo and Juliet. What do these pairings all have in common? For one thing, not one of them made our list of the best fictional couples in film and television. (That’s right! No “breaks,” jilted weddings, imprinting by werewolves, or deaths by poison here.)\n\nWho did then, you ask? Come along as we revisit the on-screen sweethearts that continue to capture our affections—proving that some love stories are simply unforgettable. Spoilers—and plenty of swooning—ahead.\n\nAllie and Noah, The Notebook (2004)\n\nWe kick things off with one of the most memorable romance films of the 21st century. What makes Allie and Noah such a good couple is that through years of miscommunication, family issues, and even old age, they continue to choose each other. And isn’t that what love is truly about?\n\nBen and Leslie, Parks and Recreation (2009-2015)\n\nTwo ambitious, career-focused people falling in love doesn’t always pan out perfectly, but Ben and Leslie grew into their relationship while learning to navigate the big plans they each set out for their futures—even if that meant Ben putting his own career on ice for a bit.\n\nTara and Willow, Buffy The Vampire Slayer (1997-2003)\n\nAlthough Tara and Willow never get their happy ending, their relationship made history as one of the first lesbian love stories on a popular TV show. Tara started as a shy and almost secretive character who befriended Willow in college, and they ended up going from witchy pals to genuine partners.\n\nFran Fine and Maxwell Sheffield, The Nanny (1993-1999)\n\nThe will-they-won’t-they dynamic of the recently widowed Broadway producer and his children’s eccentric nanny had many of us gobsmacked in front of our television sets—especially when Mr. Sheffield finally said “I love you\" to Ms. Fine (and then promptly took it back). Between their zany bits and talent for physical comedy, this duo felt like the ’90s equivalent of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo.\n\nDavid and Patrick, Schitt’s Creek (2015 - 2020)\n\nIf you binge-watched Schitt’s Creek during quarantine, then you also probably fell in love with David and Patrick’s relationship. They had no shortage of ups and downs, but Patrick’s rendition of “Simply the Best” was so endearing, and David’s unique proclamation of love so undeniably charming. Seeing them happily married by the end of the series was exactly what we needed in 2020.\n\nJim and Pam, The Office (2005-2013)\n\nWith Jim and Pam came the worthy reminder never to give up on love—even when it’s with a colleague at your paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nHan Solo and Princess Leia, Star Wars (1977)\n\nLet’s ignore the whole Luke-and-Leia-kissing thing, and instead focus on the absolutely fun chemistry between Leia and Han. Rugged scoundrel Han Solo and fearless Princess Leia were a power couple waiting to happen: From their witty banter laced with just the right amount of malice to the iconic, “I love you”/‘I know,” Han and Leia’s love story was written in the stars.\n\nMarshall and Lily, How I Met Your Mother (2005 - 2014)\n\nMany—if not most—relationships on How I Met Your Mother were complete messes, but one couple that we could always get behind was Marshall and Lily. Even with their brief breakup in the earlier seasons, these two remained one another’s biggest cheerleaders throughout the series. Besides, for a sitcom with so much silliness, Marshall and Lily’s relationship felt surprisingly realistic.\n\nAmy and Rory, Doctor Who (1963-1989, 2005-)\n\nIn honor of Ncuti Gatwa recently taking on the mantle of the 15th doctor, this spot goes to Amy and Rory Pond. Rose and the Doctor are close runner-ups, but Amy and Rory’s love story was the first time the revamped 2005 Doctor Who focused on romance. Although their final episode was devastating, who could forget Rory waiting centuries as he protected Amy in Pandora’s box, or Amy choosing to be touched by a weeping angel just so she had the chance to live the rest of her life with Rory?\n\nMr. Darcy and Elizabeth, Pride and Prejudice (2005)"
