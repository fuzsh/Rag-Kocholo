        "text": "1. Pris and Roy in Blade Runner (1982)\n\nDirected by Ridley Scott, Blade Runner became an instant hit when it was released in 1982. The couple on everyone's lips in this blockbuster was Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer (AKA Pris and Roy), mostly because their gothy personalities matched their dark, punk-like style. Heavy-duty leather, big boots, dark make-up – it all made a bold contrast to their bleached hair and looked seriously cool. It also struck a cord with the public, because their appearances were totally different to couples from popular movies in the late 1970s, such as Saturday Night Fever and Superman. In short, daring to be different was a good way to go.\n\n2. Bonnie And Clyde (1967)\n\nArthur Penn's biographical crime film, Bonnie And Clyde, may have been released in 1967, but its leading couple (played by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway) were plucked from the 19 0s3 – as evidenced by their style. The best scene to prove that? Their first gang bank robbery with Clyde's brother, Buck, and his flighty wife, Blanche. Entering the premises, Clyde is dressed in a single-breasted herringbone suit (waistcoat and fedora added for extra effect) and Bonnie is in a cream windowpane checked suit and black beret. Very sharp, very elegant and definitely a contributing factor for the film's worldwide success.\n\n3. Jack and Ennis in Brokeback Mountain (2005)\n\nBrokeback Mountain, directed by Ang Lee, might have captured headlines when it was released in 2006 but this Academy Award-winning movie was also an unexpected hit when it came to fashion. Ennis Del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) didn't sport matching outfits (good thing), but their clothing items correlated perfectly: plaid shirts, boot kick denim jeans, shearling collared jackets, bold buckled belts, cowboy boots and those all important cowboy hats. Basically, a perfect combination of Western couple dressing complete with the ultimate finishing touch: a horse.\n\n4. Rick and Isla in Casablanca (1942)\n\nWhy is it that Michael Curtiz's Casablanca remains the most loved Hollywood film of all time? The quotable script (no, here's looking at you, kid) and tear-triggering feature song both come into it, of course, but half the reason we're obsessed with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's characters is down to their wardrobes. Forties victory suits for her, sharp tailoring and trench coats for him and formal hats for both (those fedoras and panamas go hand in hand), their style is classic, well-cut and just plain cool (and actually makes us want to throw out our jeans forever).\n\n5. James Bond and Moneypenny in Skyfall (2012)\n\nOK, we know these two aren't an actual couple, but as Bond girls come and go, Moneypenny always stays. There's always a good bit of romantic tension between this pair, and we're kind of rooting for them because, boy, do they look stylish together. In Sam Mendes' Skyfall especially, Daniel Craig's bankable wardrobe of slim grey suits, crisp collared shirts and presidential folded pocket squares look brilliant next to Naomie Harris' A-grade selection of loose blouses and pencil skirts. And we can't forget that shaving scene; grooming has never looked so stylish.\n\n6. Marge and Dickie in The Talented Mr Ripley (1999)\n\nAnthony Minghella's The Talented Mr.Ripley is a movie known for its shock value as much for its fashion. With an all-star cast of Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Matt Damon (set against the backdrop of the Italian cliffside resort town of Positano – gorgeous), it came as no surprise that the fashion in the film was also excellent. It's set in the late 1950s and the clothing was elegant summer tailoring at its finest. Knitted polos and Cuban-collared shirts were paired with soft linens and cottons in a variety of pastel shades and ecru whites. Oh, and we should talk about Jude Law (AKA Dickie Greenleaf)'s hairstyle too; that curly flick fell effortlessly in pretty much every scene (something of a grooming wonder).\n\n7. T'challa and Nakia in Black Panther (2018)\n\nThe love story of T'challa and Nakia’s (Chadwick Boseman and Lupita Nyong’o) from Black Panther is, to say the least, a confusing one. The will they, wont they storyline keeps us at the edge of our seats throughout the movie, but, this said, we can't ignore the style this couple oozes. A mix of futuristic materials and traditional African prints conjure a clever dichotomy mirrored in the fabric of the film itself. If you haven't watched the Ryan Coogler-directed blockbuster yet, there has never been a better time, with the movie now available on Disney+.\n\n8. Su Li-zhen and Chow Mo-wan in In The Mood For Love (2000)\n\nWong Kar-wai's romantic drama earned Tony Leung the award for Best Actor at Cannes in 2000 (the first Hong Kong actor to win it, FYI). He plays Chow Mo-wan, a melancholic romantic who enters a platonic relationship with Su Li-zhen (played by Maggie Cheung) after they both discover their spouses are having affairs. In The Mood For Love is 90 minutes of pure ambience: whether that be through its mellow jazz soundtrack, long shots or warm lighting, which really amps up their stunning wardrobes. A collection of Mandarin dresses for her and a combination of traditional tailoring and satin ties for him (that white windowpane design is definitely our favourite).\n\n9. Elio and Oliver in Call Me By Your Name (2017)\n\nSet in 1983 northern Italy, Luca Guadagnino's Call Me By Your Name was the most hyped movie of 2017 – and for good reason. The main characters, Elio (played by teen heart throb Timothée Chalamet) and Oliver (played by Armie Hammer), were the unexpected couple that everyone fell in love with, and their style, put simply, was effortless and chic. We're talking oversized shirts, washed denim, varsity socks and those all important short shorts. The key message to take? Simple, evidently, works best.\n\n10. Ferdinand and Marianne in Pierrot Le Fou (1965)\n\nJean-Luc Godard's Pierrot Le Fou stars Jean-Paul Belmondo as Ferdinand, who trades in a bourgeois lifestyle for a travelling crime spree with ex-lover Marianne (played by Anna Karina). Criminal activities aside, it makes you want to jump into a vintage Citroën and embark on an adventure to the French Riviera stat, purely because these two make it look so damn stylish. His slim-cut tailored trousers, unbuttoned long-sleeved shirts and leather loafers are perfectly matched with her white T-shirts, high-waisted kecks and bold sailor caps.\n\n11. Carolina and El Mariachi in Desperado (1995)\n\nWe had to have an action couple in here, and one above all sprung to mind: Carolina and El Mariachi in Robert Rodriguez's Desperado. Played by Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas , hectic schedules don't leave much room for outfit changes, but that's no issue because nothing compares to those fierce black and white uniforms. Big shoutout to Banderas' henley top in particular, styled with some wide black trousers and a woven leather belt. Rebellious nonchalance done right and his guitar case is the ultimate accessory.\n\n12. Queen And Slim (2019)\n\nFormer GQ cover star Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner Smith joined forces to release the formidable Queen And Slim. Directed by Beyoncé's long time contributor Melina Matsoukas, Queen And Slim is a gripping on-the-run movie. Now, if you think “on-the-run” means trying to keep a low profile or wearing understated clothing, you could not be more wrong. Highlight looks include Queen's knee-high snakeskin boots with a slinky tiger-print dress and Slim's runway-ready berry-coloured velour tracksuit (v Gucci).\n\n13. Nick and Rachel in Crazy Rich Asians (2018)\n\nCrazy Rich Asians, directed by Jon M Chu, follows the forbidden love story of Nick Young (Henry Golding) and his girlfriend, Rachel Chu (Constance Wu). The movie itself is not only opulent and lavish but the style throughout is equally so. Young and Chu perfectly demonstrate throughout the movie how not be influenced by your surroundings. The pair's effortless and understated looks make a stark contrast to the movie's sugary, OTT backdrops, allowing them to stand out in every scene. A noteworthy look from the couple is the linen pastel pink suit worn by Young with Chu in a coloured metallic plunge gown.\n\n14. Annie and Alvy in Annie Hall (1977)\n\nWoodie Allen's Annie Hall was released in 1977: a time when oversized collars and flared trousers were the go-to in fashion. Alvy Singer (played by Allen) meets Hall (Diane Keaton) after a game of tennis and those oversized Dunlop bags, white polos and tiny tennis shorts really set the tone for their utterly preppy, totally waspish on-screen wardrobes. After a few near-death experiences in a mint green Volkswagen Beetle, it's Annie Hall who takes centre stage, by way of her trademark waistcoat, white shirt and polka dot tie combinations – all sourced from Ralph Lauren.\n\n15. Reynolds and Alma in Phantom Thread (2018)\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson's 2017 film, Phantom Thread, is a masterpiece. It's about a British dress designer called Reynolds Woodcock (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) who, after meeting on a recuperatory visit to the countryside, develops a complex relationship with a waitress called Alma (Vicky Krieps). She becomes his muse, his lover and an integral part of his craft. Disclaimer: his meticulous mind complicates things a bit, but throughout, their wardrobes are unbeatable. A plethora of couture gowns alongside incredibly elegant tailoring, relaxed shirts and the odd dapper bow tie – needless to say, we're obsessed.\n\n16. Marcello and Maddalena in La Dolce Vita (1960)\n\nThere's more to the 1960s than fashion and music. Film was booming too and that was largely down to Federico Fellini's lauded Italian film, which kicked off the decade, La Dolce Vita. It follows through the streets of Rome the drifting lifestyle of Marcello Rubini (played by Marcello Mastroianni), whose romantic relationships (plural) are spirited, carefree and undeniably stylish – especially that with Maddalena (played by Anouk Aimée). And that's down to their shared understanding and appreciation of glamour. An embellished floor-length black gown next to a classic black tux complete with bow tie? We're dubbing this the most simple and cinematic look on screen.\n\n17. Missy and Colette in Colette (2018)\n\nIf there's one film to stick on your watch list this weekend, make it Wash Westmoreland's Colette. It recounts the evolution of French literary genius Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette who, after ghostwriting a novel for her bourgeois husband, embarks on a fight for creative ownership. The plot is enlightening and the clothing is compelling (no surprise really since it's set just after the turn of the 20th century). Top sartorial points go to Missy (Denise Gough) and Colette (Keira Knightley). We won't spoil the details of their bond, but the interplay between structure and elegance is, well, perfect. And considering the film's context, also pretty revolutionary.\n\n18. Billy Brown and Layla in Buffalo '66 (1998)\n\nVincent Gallo's 1998 cult film, Buffalo ‘66, is a lesson in how to master laidback attire. Gallo, the director, also plays the main character: Billy Brown. He kidnaps a young dancer called Layla (played by Christina Ricci), requesting that she act as his wife in order to please his parents. An unconventional relationship to start with, but one thing leads to another and serious feelings soon get involved. Darkly comic and moving, Billy Brown's outfit especially plays a big part in the film's casual charm. Grey leather jacket, slim grey trousers, a sleeveless striped T-shirt and bright red Chelsea boots? It's a little Dennis The Menace, but we're very into it.\n\n19. Tish and Fonny in If Beale Street Could Talk (2019)\n\nSet in early 1970s Harlem, Barry Jenkins' romantic drama If Beale Street Could Talk is an incredibly moving tale that chronicles a couple's unbreakable bond in light of derailed plans. That central couple are known as Tish and Fonny – played by Kiki Layne and Stephan James respectively – and if we had to list one simple signifier of their bond, it would be their well-suited wardrobes. Together, they provide some essential lessons on how to layer up your neutral hues, best shown in the above scene. That beige wool cape Tish wears is a womenswear classic and as for Fonny? His artistic profession is clear in his styling, having layered a textured jazz cardigan over a white henley shirt. Top score for both.\n\n20. Jordan and Naomi in The Wolf Of Wall Street (2014)\n\nThink Martin Scorsese's hit film, The Wolf Of Wall Street, think money, sex and drugs.
