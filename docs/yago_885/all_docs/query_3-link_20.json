Ahead of Valentine's Day, here's five who left their mark on us...\n\n1. Romeo and Juliet (Romeo + Juliet, 1996):\n\nBaz Luhrmann's modern adaptation of William Shakespeare's classic tragedy brought the iconic characters of Romeo and Juliet to life with a unique and vibrant twist. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes portrayed the star-crossed lovers against a visually stunning backdrop. Their passionate and ill-fated romance is not only a testament to timeless love but also an exploration of the challenges that come with it.\n\n2. Jack and Rose (Titanic, 1997):\n\nLeo just knows how to fall in love on screen! James Cameron's epic romance, set against the tragic sinking of the Titanic, introduced audiences to the unforgettable love story between Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). The film's grand scale and heart-wrenching narrative, coupled with the undeniable chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet, made Jack and Rose one of the most iconic and beloved couples in cinematic history.\n\n3. Allie and Noah (The Notebook, 2004):\n\nBased on Nicholas Sparks' novel, The Notebook tells the poignant love story of Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) and Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling).

Allie and Noah's unwavering commitment to each other in the face of societal expectations and personal challenges makes them an iconic and enduring cinematic couple.\n\n4. Westley and Buttercup (The Princess Bride, 1987):\n\nRob Reiner's cult classic, The Princess Bride, features the fairy tale romance between Westley (Cary Elwes) and Buttercup (Robin Wright).
