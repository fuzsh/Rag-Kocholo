Born for inventing a new method called “coincidence method” by which he detected subatomic particles, and further applications.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on the Walther Wilhelm Georg Bothe or alternatively, you can download our 24-page Walther Wilhelm Georg Bothe worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION\n\nWalther Wilhelm Georg Bothe was born on January 8, 1891 in Oranienburg, Germany.\n\nHe was born to Fritz Bothe, a merchant, and Charlotte Hartung.\n\nFrom 1908 to 1912 he studied at the University of Berlin, particularly focusing on physics, mathematics, and chemistry.\n\nIn 1914, he earned his doctorate in physics, under the mentorship of physicist Max Planck, for his thesis about the molecular theory of reflection, refraction, dispersion, and extinction.\n\nHe continued to study such theory in the years that followed.\n\nCAREER AND CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nIn 1913, Bothe began to work as a researcher at the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (Reich Physical and Technical Institute) where he stayed until 1930.\n\nDuring World War I, Bothe served in the German army.\n\nIn 1915, he was captured by the Soviets and was held captive in Siberia for a year.\n\nWhile he was a prisoner of war, he studied the Russian language and continued his scientific research.\n\nIn 1920, Bothe returned to Germany and continued his employment at the radioactive laboratory under under Hans Geiger at the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR).\n\nIn PTR, Bothe and Geiger collaborated on Bothe’s most important discoveries.\n\nIn 1924, Bothe published a paper on his invention of the coincidence method, which states his discovery that when a single subatomic particle passes through two Geiger counters, the pulses from each counter are coincident in time.\n\nHe further applied this method to his studies on the wave-particle duality of light and the Compton effect.\n\nBothe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954, which he shared with Max Born, for the coincidence method and his further applications of the method.\n\nThe results of the coincidence method disproved a statistical interpretation of the Compton effect and established the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nBothe’s coincidence method also made it possible to determine the angular distribution of cosmic rays.\n\nIn 1925, while still working at PTR, Bothe became a Privatdozent at the University of Berlin.\n\nA Privatdozent is a teacher or lecturer in a German university that is recognized formally as a teacher but does not receive a salary.\n\nIn 1927, Bothe succeeded Geiger as director of the Laboratory for Radioactivity.\n\nIn 1929, Bothe applied the coincidence method on cosmic radiation, in collaboration with astronomer Werner Kolhörster and physicist Bruno Rossi.\n\nBy passing the cosmic rays through a Geiger counter array, Bothe was able to demonstrate that cosmic rays was composed of gamma rays and high energy particles rather than photons.\n\nBothe studied cosmic radiation for the rest of his life.\n\nBothe was also interested in studying the transmutation of elements.\n\nIn 1930, he took a full professorship at the University of Giessen.\n\nIn 1930, Bothe worked with Herbert Becker and observed a new form of radiation by bombarding beryllium, boron, and lithium with alpha particles from polonium.\n\nThe radiation was later identified by Sir James Chadwick as the neutron in 1932.\n\nHEADER\n\nIn 1932, he became director of the Physical and Radiological Institute at the University of Heidelberg.\n\nIn 1934, he became director of the Physics Institute of the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research at Heidelberg, where he remained until his death in 1957.\n\nIn 1938, working with Wolfgang Gentner, Bothe published a paper on the energy dependence of the nuclear photo-effect.\n\nIn Heidelberg, Bothe was responsible for the planning and building of the first operational German cyclotron which was completed in 1943.\n\nThe cyclotron is a device that can accelerate particles along a spiral path.\n\nDuring the Second World War, he worked on the German nuclear energy and weapons research.\n\nAfter the war, Bothe used the German cyclotron to create radioactive isotopes.\n\nBothe published numerous scientific articles and books in his lifetime.\n\nPERSONAL LIFE\n\nWhile he was held as a prisoner of war in Russia, Bothe met Barbara Below, who became his wife in 1920.\n\nThe couple had two daughters.\n\nBothe was a skilled pianist who was fond of listening to Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven.\n\nHe was also an artist, mostly painting using watercolor and oil.\n\nAt 66 years old, Walther Wilhelm Georg Bothe died on February 8, 1957 in Heidelberg, Germany.\n\nHONORS AND AWARDS\n\nBothe was a member of the Academy of Sciences of Göttingen and the Academy of Sciences of Heidelberg.\n\nIn 1952, he became a Knight of the Order of Merit for Sciences and the Arts.\n\nIn 1953, he received the Max Planck Medal.\n\nWalther Wilhelm Georg Bothe Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything
