The Swedish Royal family enters: King Gustaf VI Adolf, Queen Louise, Princesses Sibylla and Margaretha and Princes Wilhelm and Bertil. The Nobel Laureates enter the scene.\n\nAfter Birger Ekeberg delivered his presentation speech, each Nobel Laureate was introduced and the Nobel Prizes awarded. Professor Gunnar Waller introduced the Physics Laureates, Max Born and Walther Bothe (Professor Bothe’s award was received by his daughter Elena Riedel); the Chemistry Laureate, Linus Pauling, was introduced by Professor Gunnar Hägg; Professor Sven Gard introduced the Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine, John F. Enders, Thomas H. Weller and Frederick C. Robbins; and Dr Anders Österling spoke for the absent Nobel Laureate in Literature, Ernest Hemingway; John C. Cabot, United States Ambassador to Sweden, received the Nobel Prize on behalf of Mr Hemingway."
