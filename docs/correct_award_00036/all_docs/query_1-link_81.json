        "text": "Cindy Kelly: I’m Cindy Kelly, Atomic Heritage Foundation. It is Monday, May 28, 2018, in Antony, France. I have with me Hélène Langevin-Joliot.\n\nI have read about her. I have heard my parents speaking about Marie and her love of science. I remember my parents saying, “She was a very good director of the Radium Institute after the French war [World War I]. She was really a very good director. But it happened that she didn’t make the good decision at that time, that day. She was not always right every day.” It’s a life, it’s not a myth.\n\nI see Marie and Pierre, frankly, more difficult—as exceptional persons, but also in life, as other people are. They are nearer to me. They are not mythical persons.\n\nKelly: Tell us about her background. Was she born in France? Where is Marie from?\n\nLangevin-Joliot: Marie was born in Poland, in Warsaw, in a family with several children. She was a younger one. The family was—I would not say poor, but with a very high level of education, her father and her mother.\n\nAt that time, Warsaw was in the Russian Empire. The situation when she was a girl was very difficult because there had been protests in Poland, so she could not study in Polish. She was obliged to do that in Russian.\n\nAfter that, she wished to enter a university. She was a very good student. But at that time, women were not accepted in Warsaw University. Her sister wished to become a doctor. She [Marie] didn’t know exactly what she wished—but she wished something about science. But of course, she needed to go abroad.\n\nHer father did not enough money to help. The elder sister went to France first to study medicine. Marie decided to become a governess to children in a rich Polish family. It was sometimes not so bad, but sometimes rather difficult. Finally, she succeeded several years after.\n\nShe was twenty-four when she came to Paris, and entered easily the Sorbonne University. It was more easy for her than for a French student, because French women didn’t get at, that time, the baccalaureate. It was very difficult to enter the university. Marie had a certificate from the Russian Empire and that certificate was at the level of the baccalaureate, so it was accepted. It’s not special—you have in physics and mathematics about the same amount of French and foreign students at that time for women.\n\nKelly: How many women were there at that time?\n\nLangevin-Joliot: I would say, it depends if you take all the universities or not, and it was changing every year. Because it was what I call a transition period, where you start from zero, then one, two, three, ten, more or less twenty, and the year after there were twenty-five, and so on.\n\nIt was increasing, but it was a small number. The total number of students was very small, 200, 2,000, something like that, two or three thousand. The women were 20, 30, 50 maybe, depending of the year of your viewpoint.\n\nKelly: So she was clearly a minority.\n\nLangevin-Joliot: Oh more than a minority. A special situation. Changing rather quickly, if you compare with the situation at the beginning of the nineteenth century.\n\nKelly: She was a good student?\n\nLangevin-Joliot: Very good, very good. She had success in Paris, first in physics and then in mathematics.\n\nThen she decided to come to Poland to try to find a position to teach. But it happened that after a French Professor of Physics, [Gabriel] Lippmann, was impressed by this Polish student. He finds for her a research contract to make some measurements, some rather easy in principle, some easy measurements about the magnetic property of steel.\n\nIt is when she wished to start that work that she met Pierre Curie, who at that time had a lot of research, research very important. Already he had discovered piezoelectricity with his brother [Jacques Curie] twenty years before. He had produced a theoretical paper about symmetry. He was finishing his thesis about magnetic properties, the first important thing after [Michael] Faraday on the subject. They met, and it happens that Pierre Curie at first decided that he will make everything to become her husband.\n\nIt was difficult for Marie to decide, because Poland or France? They exchanged letters, very beautiful letters. In fact, letters from Pierre Curie were successful to decide her to remain in France and remain with him. He wrote something like that, “It will be a beautiful thing to spend our life together, a humanitarian life and also your patriotic life and your scientific life.”\n\nShe married. Marie studied, and was able in principle—she could have a teaching position in France, and then she decides it’s better to try research and to try to have a thesis on that. They discussed about what subject, and they choose the discovery of Henri Becquerel of the uranium radiation. It is a starting point of the two discoveries.\n\nIn September 1897, she started arranging the apparatus with Pierre because the system was built by him, and she started measurements. She studied uranium. It is radiation, uranium radiation is really anatomic radiation. She had the idea to compare to see if other elements, chemical elements have the same property—not so much. One. Then she had the idea to look again at minerals, and was very much surprised that pitchblende and another one were more active, as it is written in the publication, as uranium.\n\nThey began to work together, Pierre and Marie. By the end of 1898, they have discovered first, polonium in July, and radium in December. There was a note of the French Academy of Science just before the polonium. The first note was signed only by Marie, and you will understand that many physicists would have signed the note with Marie. All the experimental setup was from Pierre, and maybe he decided that it was better. He was already known as a physicist. I am sure that the fact that this first note had been signed by Marie alone was the starting point of all her career, because you cannot say, “It’s Pierre.” After that, it’s true that the two discover it, they worked together, and they have their common discovery.\n\nFor a thesis, she found it very important to not only to use the work they had done together about polonium and radium, but to go farther, to get to have radium as a pure salt. Because at the end of 1898, it was trace, so the things they wanted to produce, you have not one part in 100 of radium, for example, in the barium salt. They were at work for at least three, four years. Very difficult.\n\nIt was a huge amount of pitchblende. It must be said that they never had four tons of pitchblende in the lab. It was completely impossible. Pierre Curie arranged to ask an external society to treat the beginning of this huge mass of pitchblende. But they have tens of kilos to have to process, and it was already enough.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in 1903 was given for physics to Becquerel and Pierre and Marie Curie, divided in two. The reason was that the Nobel committee received first a French proposal for Becquerel and Pierre Curie, without Marie. Pierre was aware of that and he wrote to say that on this work, it was necessary to have Marie included, and she was.\n\nKelly: Tell us about the hazards of working for three or four years with these huge vats of pitchblende. How dangerous was that?\n\nLangevin-Joliot: It was dangerous because of radioactivity increasing and increasing. When she had at the end one decigram or less of radium, there is a lot of radiation in that, and no special means for chemistry in this place. They had their fingers burned.\n\nBut at that time, people don’t know so much about the risk of cancer, in fact. Marie started to be aware of that maybe fifteen or twenty years after. It was Pierre Curie who at that time began to have some collaboration with medical people who tried to use radium to cure.\n\nKelly: Cure cancer?\n\nLangevin-Joliot: Not immediately cancer. Radium was destroying things, so it was possible to use first for skin problems. Then they say, “Maybe we can try on cancer, to cure cancer.” But medical people need twenty years to be able to start, I would say, scientific, a really scientific trial with measurement of the radiation, looking at the ways and then so on. At the beginning, it was just, “The people are dying, so we try something.”\n\nKelly: I have read the laboratory where they worked was part of the School of Medicine once. It was a morgue.\n\nLangevin-Joliot: Pierre Curie was a professor at the School for Chemistry and Physics, a school for engineers. The place of the school was organized from a public school, more general. In a part, there was an older place, which had been not a medical school, but a place with some medical tie. It was old and not convenient at all as a laboratory, that was the point. It was the reason that Pierre was trying to get a real laboratory.\n\nAfter he died, Marie takes her work. The Nobel Prize helps, but it takes a long time before the faculty of science in Paris [of the University of Paris] and the Pasteur Institute agree to start the building of the Radium Institute. There was already at that time a Radium Institute in Vienna. The Radium Institute in France was just finished at the beginning of the First [World] War. There was in the Radium Institute a part for chemistry and physics, directed by Marie, and a part for biology and medicine, directed by a very important, very good researcher, Claude Regaud. So they combined.\n\nIt happens that during the first war, Marie decided it was not time to start study on the radioactivity at the Radium Institute. She devoted completely her time and her effort for radiology tests for the soldiers. In other countries, the same thing happened. Lise Meitner, for example, does the same thing. But Marie, with her energy, was able to convince the military stage, convince the medical people, with things that take searching—that X-rays were not so useful, and they don’t understand how to use X-rays. She was able to convince them. She searched for people to help. My mother, who was seventeen years old, started to help.\n\nJust after the war, Marie was the director of a lab. She increased the lab, she developed the Radium Institute. Between the end of the French war and her death in 1934, she makes the Radium Institute one of the main laboratories in the world. Two or three were maybe comparable to that. She had to get money, especially during the first year after the end of the war, because France was in a very poor situation.\n\nIt happened that this journalist, Mrs. [Marie Mattingly] Meloney, was successful in getting an interview from Marie, which was amazing because she never gave interviews, and Mrs. Meloney was successful to get one. It happened that instead of asking Marie that she was very unhappy with that and that and that, she asked the situation about the lab. Immediately, Marie answered. They discussed together in the interview. She didn’t imagine an interview for that.\n\nIt was the starting point of the petition for money to pay for one gram of radium to Marie, and the trip in America to get such radium in 1921. I would say this travel probably made more, or the same level, than the Nobel Prize. It was a promotion, an exceptional promotion.\n\nIt’s true that it was built on serious things, but I am not sure that without that travel, Marie would not have been known as much as she was in those times. Because the two trips in the States, in ’21 and ’29, with all the publicity and all the newspapers speaking about it, that gave the idea to an important editor just after Marie’s death to ask Ève Curie to write a biography of Marie. That biography was in English, published in English earlier than in French, in spite of the fact that it was translated from French. It was a very important first printing of the book, because the book was known even more to English-speaking people than in France, the number of people.\n\nThere have been other books about Marie after the Second [World] War. Several of them at the beginning were people by historians, because the archive was opened. Many things that my aunt could not know about—for example, this story about the first Nobel Prize, nobody knows until historians open the archive of the Nobel Committee. It was not immediately after the war, it was much later.\n\nYou have serious works written about Marie, and also some books for children, summaries, and all that. Marie has become really a symbol of the myth about women in science, and a number of books have been written. I read some of them, I discussed with the writers in some cases, and you have a lot of books I never know about. Some are good, some are interesting.\n\nOr you arrange the life of Marie so that it becomes a roman [novel], which have in some cases nothing to do with the truth. It’s like that.\n\nIf you wish to know about Marie, we made publicity for a book I took care of for the publication, I took care of with the director of the Curie Museum. We have gathered parts of the letters exchanged between Marie Curie and her daughters, Irène and Ève. You have a thousand of letters in total. That really is the true Marie Curie, you will find in that.\n\nKelly: That’s great. Could you go back a little bit on World War I, when she used X-rays—was that the first time they were used in war, in hospitals even, to detect where the bullet might be or broken bones? Was that the first time that X-rays were used for that purpose?\n\nLangevin-Joliot: X-rays had been used before the First [World] War in hospitals. But not so much in France, but also in Germany, in England, all those places. It was the beginning of the use of X-rays. As the war started, the number of soldiers who needed X-ray was huge.\n\nMarie appreciated that immediately in the first weeks of the war. She thought that she could do something on that. She searched for a car to be able to change things, or to put the X-ray apparatus and use [them]. She began to teach to medical people and women so that they were able to use the X-ray apparatus, which at that time were laboratory apparatus.\n\nKelly: Do you remember what people called those ambulances she fixed with the X-ray apparatus? Do you know the term “petite Curie?”\n\nLangevin-Joliot: Yes. To tell the truth, Marie organized this “petite Curie,” this car.\n\nIt must be said that during the war, once the military stage were convinced that it was really needed, there were a huge number of those cars, and so those cars are not “petite Curie.”\n\nKelly: That’s great.\n\nLangevin-Joliot: Yes, not all. You had “petite Curie” in Germany, because it was obvious at some time, even the military understood that it was necessary.\n\nKelly: That’s great. One other image I have of Marie and Pierre is on their honeymoon. Is it true they went on a bicycle trip in Brittany? Can you tell us about how much they liked to bicycle?\n\nLangevin-Joliot: Yes. They loved trips in the country, with bicycle or by foot. They thought it was very important for children not only to study, but also to be in good health. This is a tradition, which came to the next generation. Few people used to do so, in those times. You have a number of things like that.\n\nThey were not always at the laboratory. It happens that they may come back at night to continue some operation or to look at a result. But at other times, they take some vacation. You may ask a question: between the discovery of polonium and radium, they knew that there was another element than polonium to discover. And what they do they do? They take a vacation, and they spend on vacation more than one month, or maybe two.\n\nAmong the many things, many ideas which came from Pierre and Marie to my parents—and I would say to me and my brother—was the love of science, of research. An idea about the fact that everybody needs good condition of life. At each generation, they hoped that more people are happier, with better social conditions.\n\nThis was something from one generation to the other, in different conditions, because the time of Marie and Pierre is not the same as my time, for example. And also the fact that children—boy and girl—I would say my parents, because for Marie and Pierre, it was two girls [Irène and Ève]. For my parents, boy and girl [Hélène and her brother Pierre]. They need the same kind of teaching, the same kind of education, and the whole family needs to not always be working at the lab or at the school, but needs to have vacation, to do sports, taking some time for active vacation. All that was transmitted from one generation to the other.\n\nMy parents, they did not have to come from one country to the other. Frédéric Joliot and Irène Curie were both born in Paris. Irène was born in a scientific family, and she was quickly interested in science. I would say, she dropped in science quite naturally.\n\nFor Frédéric Joliot, it’s completely different, because his family had no connection at all with science. Maybe some arts. They loved very much theater and all that. They had money before the First War. It was a rather big family, two girls, my father, an older brother. The family was rather rich and the father, retired, had money, was not working for money for a long time. My father, he goes to school. He was not especially good. Chemistry is interesting, but football is very interesting also.\n\nIt happens that it was the First [World] War. The First War was not simple for their family. The older brother of my father was lost in the two first weeks of the war. It was very important for my father, during all the life of my father, the number of times he spoke about that.\n\nIf you look at the mention in the notebook—it’s completely incredible for a scientist in all time. You have made a discovery, you know that there is another one to do. And you stop everything to go and take a vacation, and take care of the young children, and so on.\n\nHis comment the same day hearing about that—we were on vacation in Brittany at that time. It was, “Atomic energy maybe used, will be used for the good of society, will have a useful application, and not only the bomb. And also to tell to French people that, yes, this is a very important result obtained in the States. But the starting point of the Manhattan Project is not only an American work. You have also the French work.”\n\nHe was not completely happy of the way the American government behaved for him. He was unable to go to the States. He could go to England, but to go to the States, he could not do so at the end of ’44.\n\nThere was this official report, the Smyth Report, telling the story of the Manhattan Project, and giving an introduction at the beginning, summarizing the people, the reason from fundamental research. There was nothing in the report about French research. They put some research from Copenhagen but that, strictly nothing.\n\nThe reaction of my father: “We must explain that we have done something.” It’s only later that the fact that if you imagine a new war with the atomic bomb, it was the future of mankind.\n\nThe newspapers and radio came from the States and from England to Paris. They have connections between the physicists. Nuclear physicists or chemical physicists, having taken part in the Manhattan Project gave statements advertising that fact of, with the atomic bomb, it was completely necessary to have an agreement for peace, not to use them. This was the case of a number of physicists. Some of them, even before the bomb, proposed that one give a demonstration of the bomb, not using the bomb on the civilians, on the population. Those with [James] Franck and a few others, with [Leo] Szilard and a few others, there was a small number. But after the bomb is there, there were a number of physicists saying the same thing, “You have to take care of that.”\n\nThis statement by Einstein, who was not involved in the Manhattan Project—he was the man who had said to [President Franklin] Roosevelt that something has to be done about the chain reaction and the atomic possibility of the Germans having it. But he was not involved at all in the Manhattan Project itself. The statement was with this situation, the future of all mankind. The only possibility that this doesn’t happen is to turn to a world government—which is not so surprising. It’s exactly the things he said after the First [World] War, as a pacifist very much engaged.\n\nHis reaction was more than the approach. More realistically, it has to be said, we must be able to control more or less that, in order not to have a war with atomic weapons. But Einstein was, “If you have not a world government, this will happen one day.” That idea, he pushed it for some time.\n\nThe bomb is really a turning point in the life of many nuclear physicists. Among them, my father. I would say the general opinion of nuclear physicists, more or less, thinking about the future was, “You need to avoid a nuclear war, absolutely. But the situation was such that very quickly the combination of the need for peace based off no atomic weapons, and developing science as before with liberty.”\n\nThat point was, this was completely opposite to what was needed to have science again. You find in the statement not only from my father saying that in Paris, but the others were saying that in other countries: “It not only is the end of the civilization if we have an atomic war, but it is the end of science if we are not able to have the condition for fundamental research and freedom of ideas all among the world.” The two questions became mixed together. And for the last one, a statement by Einstein about the law—to those people saying that the law was good, “Science is international, gentlemen, whether you like that or not.” I like the statement very much.\n\nIt happened that in July 1946, the United Nations opened a special discussion, diplomatic and scientific discussion about the way of applying nuclear energy for useful purposes and controlling the production of armament, of atomic arms. You have diplomats and you have scientific experts. My father, as High Commissioner of Atomic Energy in France, was one of the experts starting this discussion in the States in July and in September. All that, after that, continued for two years without a real result.\n\nIn July, it started with a report from America, from the States, a report has been prepared by the scientists knowing the situation, five American scientists. They have prepared the Lilienthal Report, and taking the Lilienthal Report, the diplomats and governmental people taken what they want, and introduced a number of things. The secret about the bomb: “The bomb must remain at one only place, which is the States.” In spite of the fact that physicists state to everybody who will hear that there was no secret of the bomb, that a big country will be able to make an atomic bomb. Some say one year, some say two years, but ten years it will [inaudible]. Most say three or four years, which was exactly what happened.\n\nThe diplomats, they were in between two choices: “The security of the States rely on the fact that we are the first. We have to remain the first, and we build more bombs, or the security of the States will make us rely on other countries, on an agreement. And you cannot prepare an agreement when you take steps to war.”\n\nWhen the discussion occurred in this commission, diplomats and scientists, I heard my father commenting to my mother, “If scientists were alone, we will find a solution. If I look at the position of the Soviet Union and other states, of the United States, you can pick some of the proposals and you can find some proposals which are more reasonable than others.\n\nThe situation after this period, all the politics, strictly political problems, and history and all that, results in the fact that this main problem, was completely forgotten. You had to be one side or the other. You could not be on the middle side thinking, “Really, the fact that the States could think the Soviet Union has the army in Europe or very near. And Russia”—as many physicists pointed out—“they have more reason to fear the United States, than the United States has to fear Russia.” So it’s another story after.\n\nBut the way scientists were able to decide what to do, my father was engaged rather quickly in the World Federation of Scientific Workers. Not only to fight against the possible use of a bomb, but to try to develop not only atomic energy, but all kinds of science, science as a social function. That idea did not come especially from my father. It came in particular from a book written by Bernal, a very well-known English scientist, Desmond Bernal. His book, The Social Function of Science, my father read it, and many others also. So it was that.\n\nWe cannot speak of all the story of what happened until the death of my parents. My father first focused on what the scientists can do. But after one or two years, he convinced himself that scientists alone were not enough to push on this problem. Really, you must involve the public, other cities. So, that is the reason they tried to find ways to motivate people for that. He was in this Greek World Congress for Peace in ’49. We were a number. The year after, there was this Stockholm Appeal, given in Stockholm to adopt a clear position to forbid any use of the bomb and to say, “We must find a way to control.” This was signed by many, many, many people.\n\nBut the political situation was such that people read what is stated here and here, adding many other considerations. I think this is true—this is really not their position, because of reasons which have nothing to do with it. And it was the same thing, one side, and the same thing, the other one. It takes time. It’s a pity, because in the States or even in England, people don’t understand at all the position of my father as a scientist. And my father didn’t understand the position of others.\n\nUnfortunately, it happened that hydrogen atomic bombs began to be produced. This time, there is only one year between the States and the Soviet Union. And the bomb from the Soviet Union was somewhat better, it seems. You produce that, and you have this use in the atmosphere, and you have radioactive products everywhere on the earth and accidents and so on.\n\nThe discussion among physicists starts again here and here and here. In 1955, what is known as the Einstein-Russell Declaration, which for the first time starts with eleven signatures. One only in France, my father, agreed, especially with Russell, Bertrand Russell saying, “I am anti-communist completely. And you are communist. We have two sides together.” It was the last declaration of Einstein, as it is known.\n\nThis was a special year, because at the time the declaration was made public, there was at the same time the conference in Geneva with a number of physicists invited. Not my parents. There was a story—and the French were the worst in that—because there was an exhibition to remind the progress of science before the war. There was nothing on the work of the Joliot-Curies, nothing, not a photograph, nothing. Many people were upset at that. Otto Hahn visiting that exhibition, told them because there was a photo of him, “If you don’t have something [about the Joliot-Curies], I wish that you take my photograph out.”"
