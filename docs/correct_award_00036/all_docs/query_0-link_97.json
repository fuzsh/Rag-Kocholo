        "text": "The reader of this book is introduced by Max Born to his own scientific work and extraordinary achievement. Born is one of the founders of quantum mechanics, a major intellectual accomplishment of the twentieth century, comparable to such other feats in scientific thought as the Newtonian philosophy and the Darwinian revolution. For his contributions to quantum mechanics, Born was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics. One learns that Born did not become involved in nuclear fusion and its applications to the atomic bomb. This enables him to consider the ethical and political questions connected with the bomb from an objective viewpoint. It is to these questions that most of the essays in the volume are addressed. Born is concerned with two major questions: Can human affairs be regulated without the use of force? Can the current decline of ethics and morality be reversed? More simply stated, Is there hope for man's future? His position ranges from darkest pessimism and despair to optimism and hope. In the moving final essay he exhorts: \"But we must hope!\" He speaks of hope as \"a moving force\", for he is convinced: Only if we hope do we act in order to bring fulfillment of the hope nearer.\" It is Born's dedication as a teacher and his deep insight into the material universe enlightened by philosophical understanding that makes this collection of writings so profound. And it is his social conscience that makes the essays so relevant and so significant"
