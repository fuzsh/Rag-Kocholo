        "text": "Special to The New York Times\n\ntockholm, Sweden. Dec. 10--Winners of the 1954 Nobel prizes received them today from King Gustaf Adolf.\n\nThey included Dr. John Franklin Enders, Dr. Frederick C. Robbins and Prof. Thomas H. Weller, all of the United States, winners of the prize for medicine; Prof. Linus C. Pauling, also an American, a chemistry winner, and Dr. Max Born, a German physicist.\n\nDr. Born shared the physics prize with his countryman, Dr. Walter Bothe who because of the amputation of a leg could not come here.\n\nThe winner of the prize for literature, Ernest Hemingway, also was absent. He is recuperating in Cuba from injuries received in an airplane mishap in Africa. His message accepting the award was read for him by the United States Ambassador, John M. Cabot, in Stockholm's Town Hall.\n\n\"Writing at its best is a lonely life,\" Mr. Hemingway's message said. \"Organizations for writers palliate the writer's loneliness, but I doubt if they improve his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone, and if he is a good enough writer, he must face eternity or the lack of it each day.\n\n'Each Book a New Beginning'\n\n\"For a true writer, each book should be a new beginning where he tries again for something that is beyond attainment. He should always try for something that has never been done or that others have tried and failed. Then sometimes, with great luck, he will succeed.\n\n\"How simple the writing of literature would be if it were only necessary to write in another way what has been well written. It is because we have had such great writers in the past that a writer is driven far out past where he can go, out to where no one can help him.\"\n\nMr. Hemingway wrote that \"no writer who knows the great writers who did not receive the [Nobel] prize can accept it other than with humility.\"\n\nThe prizes, $35,000 in each field, were awarded by the King in the Stockholm Symphony Hall. The King also presented diplomas and gold medals to the winners.\n\nAs each winner came forward, the King shook hands and chatted briefly with him. No prize for peace was awarded this year, and no reason was given for the omission.\n\nDr. Anders Oesterling, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, said:\n\n\"It is hardly an exaggeration to say that Ernest Hemingway to a greater extent than any of his American colleagues, makes us feel we are confronted by a still young nation which seeks and finds its exact form of expression.\n\nEffect off Style Cited\n\n\"Hemingway's significance as one of this epoch's true molders of style is apparent here and there in American and European narrative art from the last quarter-century, chiefly in the vivid dialogue and the verbal thrust and parry in which he has set a standard as easy to imitate as it is difficult to attain.\n\n\"* * * It is possible to trace the distinctive linking thread between Hemingway's latest work, 'The Old Man and the Sea,' and one of the classic creations of America literature, Melville's story about Moby Dick.\"\n\nThe awards for medicine went to Dr. Enders of Harvard, Dr. Weller of the Harvard School of Public Health and Dr. Robbins of Cleveland's Western Reserve Medical School for discoveries on polio virus.\n\nDr. Pauling, of the California Institute of Technology, received the chemistry award for research and discoveries on the forces that hold atoms together.\n\nDr. Born was honored for his work in quantum mechanics, and Dr. Bothe for work on the co-incidence method, a means of measuring time with extreme accuracy.\n\nThe prizes are awarded on the anniversary of the death in 1896 of Alfred Nobel, Swedish inventor of dynamite, and are paid out from a $9,000,000 fund left by him."
