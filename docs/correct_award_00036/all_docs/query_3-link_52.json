He was a physicist awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his fundamental research in quantum mechanics, especially for his statistical interpretation of the wavefunction” along with Walther Bothe (1891–1957) “for the coincidence method and his discoveries made therewith.” In philosophical discussions, Max…",

        "text": "“The start of his 1948 schedule signaled a year of nearly constant travel. After Brussels, he traveled directly to Oxford to give the Waynflete Lectures at Magdalen College that he had agreed to almost two years earlier. He no longer planned to discuss the purpose of science as he had considered doing after the meeting of the Association of Atomic Scientists. Required to address himself to the lecture series’ overall theme of the boundary between science and philosophy, he decided to define nature within a consistent system that is ruled by both cause and chance. As he said to Hedi*, ‘If both are God’s work, then is the point a crazy game of rule and chaos or of chaotic order?’\n\n“The hall for the first lecture at Magdalen was so crowded that Born and the president of the college had to push their way through the standing- room-only audience to get to the podium. After the introduction, Born began by observing that chance can follow rules and cause-effect relationships cannot predict the future with certainty. He told the audience that he would untangle these two ideas and show, through the course of the lectures, the common features of cause and chance through the example of physics. Astronomy, the oldest science, was Born’s first example. He explained that its foundations were deterministic, and according to his definitions, not causal since early theorists such as Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Johannes Kepler did not state a cause for the behavior of the planets, except God’s will. Indeed, cause only became prominent when Galileo determined the rules for falling bodies and Newton, the laws of motion. Born’s lectures proceeded through electromagnetic fields, thermodynamics, kinetic theory of gases, and electrons to illustrate the interplay of causality, chance, contiguity, and antecedence in the development of physical theories. Then he turned to quantum theory and the statistical interpretation of the wave function, a theory, as he said, that is ‘frankly and shamelessly statistical and indeterministic.’ He asked,"
