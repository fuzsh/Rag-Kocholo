        "text": "The History of Cosmic Ray Studies\n\n1900 - 1949\n\n1900\n\nPaul Villard described gamma rays\n\n1900\n\nMax Planck put forward his quantum theory\n\n1901\n\nFirst Nobel Prize awarded in physics (to Roentgen)\n\n1905\n\nAlbert Einstien published his theory of Special Relativity and introduced the idea of discrete packets of energy, later called \"photons\"\n\n1908\n\nGeorge Hale demonstrated that sunspots are produced by strong magnetic fields\n\n1909\n\nThe amount of charge in an electron was determined by Robert Millikan\n\n1911\n\nErnest Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus\n\n1911\n\nCharles Wilson invented a cloud chamber, which was used to detect alpha and beta particles and electrons\n\n1912\n\nCosmic ray research began in 1912 when Victor Hess, of the Vienna University, and 2 assistants flew in a balloon to an altitude of about 16,000 ft. They discovered evidence of a very penetrating radiation (cosmic rays) coming from outside our atmosphere. In 1936, Hess was awarded the Nobel prize for this discovery.\n\n1913\n\nNiels Bohr proposed that atoms contain orbital shells of electrons\n\n1914\n\nErnest Rutherford discovered the proton\n\n1916\n\nAlbert Einstein published his General Theory of Relativity\n\n1920\n\nHarlow Shapley and Heber Curtis: The Great Debate over the scale and structure of the universe\n\n1920\n\nErnest Rutherford proposed the existence of the neutron\n\n1920\n\nHarkins and Eddington found that the fusion of hydrogen could be the energy source of stars. Image of Sagittarius star cloud is courtesy of NASA/ARC.\n\n1922\n\nRussian physicist/mathematician Alexander Freedmann predicted that the universe is expanding\n\n1925\n\nRobert Millikan introduced the term \"cosmic rays\"\n\nMarch 16, 1926\n\nRobert Goddard, for whom the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center is named, fired the first liquid fuel rocket.\n\n1928\n\nPaul Dirac predicted that for every particle, there is a corresponding anti-particle that is exactly like the particle but with opposite charge = antimatter\n\n1929\n\nUsing a newly invented cloud chamber, Dimitry Skobelzyn observed the first ghostly tracks left by cosmic rays\n\n1929\n\nWalter Bothe and Werner Kolhorster verified that the Skobelzyn's cloud chamber tracks are curved, showing that cosmic rays are charged particles\n\n1930\n\nErnest Lawrence invented the cyclotron, the first particle accelerator, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1939\n\n1930\n\nWolfgang Pauli proposed the existence of the neutrino\n\n1930\n\nInvention of the coronograph by Bernard Lyot\n\n1932\n\nJames Chadwick discovered the neutron\n\n1932\n\nCarl Anderson discovered antimatter (positrons) in his cloud chamber. He shared the 1936 Nobel Prize with Victor Hess for his work.\n\n1932\n\nJohn Cockroft and Ernest Walton used a particle accelerator to split the atom\n\n1932\n\nDr. Robert A. Millikan of Caltech, winner of the 1923 Nobel prize in physics, completed a series of tests on the intensity of cosmic rays at various altitudes in a Condor bomber from March Field, Calif.\n\n1935\n\nExplorer II, a 113,000 cubic foot rubberized helium balloon ascended to the official record of 22,066 m while collecting atmospheric, cosmic ray, and other data.\n\n1935\n\nHideki Yukawa predicted the existence of mesons, for which he won the 1949 Nobel Prize\n\n1937\n\nSeth Neddermeyer and Carl Anderson discovered the muon (for mu meson) in cosmic rays\n\n1937\n\nFirst artificial element, technetium, was created\n\n1938\n\nOtto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission\n\n1938\n\nPierre Auger discovered \"extensive air showers\", showers of secondary subatomic particles caused by the collision of high energy cosmic rays with air molecules\n\n1940\n\nA Beechcraft AD-17 biplane was flown to an altitude of 21,050 ft over the Antarctic to measure cosmic rays for the U.S. Antarctic Expedition.\n\n1947\n\nPions (for pi mesons) were discovered by Cecil Powell.\n\n1947\n\nPhysicist Martin Pomerantz announced at Swarthmore College that he had sent a flight of four free balloons, carrying cosmic ray equipment, to a record height of at least 127,000 feet over the Antarctic.\n\n1948\n\nBethe and Gamow explained nucleosynthesis in a hot big bang.\n\n1949\n\nEnrico Fermi proposed that cosmic ray protons are accelerated by bouncing off moving magnetic clouds in space, as in the shock waves around a supernova\n\nBack to main history page\n\nClick on images above to learn more about them\n\nA service of the Heliophysics Science Division at NASA's GSFC\n\nQuestions and comments to: cosmicopia@cosmicra.gsfc.nasa.gov\n\nCurator: Dr Eric R.
