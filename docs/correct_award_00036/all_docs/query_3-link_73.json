        "text": "Interesting Walther Wilhelm Georg Bothe Facts: Walther Bothe was born in Oranienburg, Germany. He studied physics at the University of Berlin where Max Planck was one of his professors. In 1914 he earned a PhD in Physics. He was captured by the Soviets during World War I and spent a year in Siberia. He was released in 1920 and returned to Germany. Beginning in 1920 he worked with H. Geiger at the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin. In 1924 he published a paper on his method of coincidence which states that when a single particle passes through two Geiger counters, the pulses from each are coincident in time. By using banks of Geiger counters and Bothe's method of coincidence it is possible to determine the angular distribution of cosmic rays. From 1920 to 1926 he worked on corpuscular theory of light. In 1927 he published an important paper on light quanta and interference. The corpuscular theory of light was supported by this work. In 1929 he was able to demonstrate cosmic and ultraviolet rays by passing them through a Geiger counter array. In 1930 he was a Professor Extraordinary at the University of Berlin. He became Professor of Physics and Director of the Institute of Physics at the University of Giessen in 1930. In 1930 he used alpha rays from polonium to create a new form of radiation. This was the basis of the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932. In 1932 he moved to Heidelberg to become Director of the Institute of Physics at the University of Heidelberg. While at Heidelberg he obtained funding for a cyclotron."
