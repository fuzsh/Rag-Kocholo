        "text": "1. Max Born Natalie Martinez Period 1, English December 12, 2013\n\n2. Biography     Max Born was born on December 11, 1882 in Breslau, Germany. He lived in Gottingen, West Germany. Born had two kids named Irene Born and Gritli Born. Max Born died on January 5, 1970 in Gottingen, Germany.\n\n3. Assertion  Max Born is a significant scientist because he made brilliant contributions in the areas of physics and optics.\n\n4. Evidence #1  “Max Born was a pioneer in developing quantum mechanics. The term quantum mechanics was introduced by Born.”\n\n5. Explanation #1  The phrase \"quantum mechanics\" was coined by the group of physicists including Max Born, Werner Heisenberg, and Wolfgang Pauli at the University of Gottingen in the early 1920’s. It was first used in Born’s 1924 paper \"Zur Quantenmechanik.\"\n\n6. Evidence #2  “This technique is called the Born Approximation. It is also known as the Born-Oppenheimer theory of molecules deals with interatomic forces.”\n\n7.  Explanation #2 The invention Approximation is used for solving problems concerning the scattering of atomic particles. Born and J. Robert Oppenheimer introduced a widely used simplification of the calculations dealing with electronic structures of molecules.\n\n8. Evidence #3  “The Nobel Prize in Physics 1954 was divided equally between Max Born and Walther Bothe. He also won Nobel Prize for his invention, Born Approximation.”\n\n9.  Explanation #3 Max Born won these two Nobel Prizes for his fundamental research in quantum mechanics, especially for his statistical interpretation of the wave function."
