Stephen Edwin King, born on September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine, has cemented his legacy as an influential author of both the 20th and 21st centuries. Although dubbed the "King of Horror," his repertoire extends beyond horror to include suspense, crime, science fiction, fantasy, and mystery. King's literary journey began with the publication of "Carrie" in 1974, a novel that established him as a master of horror and set the stage for his prolific career. His works, including "The Shining," "Misery," and "The Shawshank Redemption," have gone beyond books to become cultural landmarks in film and television. King's deep exploration of the human psyche and society has earned him widespread critical acclaim, including the Bram Stoker and August Derleth Awards, the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, and the National Medal of Arts.

Raised under challenging circumstances by a single mother, King's early life was marked by financial strain and frequent relocations. From a young age, however, his passion for storytelling was evident, drawing inspiration from comics, films, and a diverse range of literature. King spent his formative years voraciously reading and writing, laying the groundwork for his storytelling career. After graduating from the University of Maine at Orono with a Bachelor of Arts in English, King briefly worked as a teacher before committing fully to writing. His personal experiences, along with his keen observations of American culture, have profoundly influenced his writing, making Stephen King a household name and a towering figure in the world of literature.
