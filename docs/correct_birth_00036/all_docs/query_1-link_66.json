This can only be one home in Bangor, Maine - the home of one of the world's most famous and likely the most prolific authors - Stephen King. People often stop by here to be photographed in front of the gates and home or to take their own. Stephen is a long time “Maine boy” as it is referred to here and someone in whom the Maine people are quite proud of.\n\nPhoto# Stephen King 1873"
