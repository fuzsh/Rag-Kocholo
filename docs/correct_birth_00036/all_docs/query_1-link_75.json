        "text": "A beautification project taking place in front of legendary Maine author Stephen King's former house on West Broadway is coming along nicely.\n\nCity of Bangor Communication's Manager, David Warren says the Bangor City Council initiated the project recently, after becoming concerned that the area outside of the residence keeps getting destroyed by the number of tourists and fans to stop to take pictures in front of the Bangor landmark.\n\n\"As you know, the home attracts hundreds, if not thousands, of people each year, and the grass there has been worn away and just become a large dirt patch. Based on that Council's concern, the City is installing the cobblestones in an effort to make it more presentable. \"\n\nRead More: What's Happening Out In Front Of Stephen King's House in Bangor?\n\nEarlier this month, the project was started and so far, it seems to be coming along nicely.\n\nWarren says the entire undertaking isn't costing too much money, as they already had some of the materials on hand.\n\n\"The cost of the project is just under $6K to cobblestone two sections of the esplanade in front of the King Foundation home. The cobblestones were recovered from an old project so the City's investment is mostly in labor and equipment. The City believes the investment is warranted because it's beautifying an area that's among the most visited spots in Bangor.\"\n\nWarren said the project should be completed in the next week or so."
