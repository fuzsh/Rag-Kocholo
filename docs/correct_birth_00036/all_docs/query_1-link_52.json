        "text": "A book release party for Sharon Kitchens’ Stephen King’s Maine (Arcadia Publishing) and film screening of Pennywise: The Story of ‘It’, directed by John Campopiano, followed by a Q&A with author and director!\n\nCome celebrate life in Stephen King Country! Close on the heels of the 50th anniversary of Carrie‘s release, local author Sharon Kitchens’ new book identifies the locations that serve as the basis for King’s fictional towns of Castle Rock, Jerusalem’s Lot, Derry, and Haven. Drawing on historical materials and conversations with locals and people who know King, the author sheds light on daily life in the places that became the settings for Carrie, Salem’s Lot, The Dead Zone, Cujo, IT, and 11/22/63.\n\nSharon will be on-hand to sign copies of Stephen King’s Maine, and we will be screening John Campopiano’s documentary Pennywise: The Story of ‘It’ (2021), followed by a Q&A with John. He will also be displaying one of the Pennywise costumes, worn by actor Tim Curry during filming of the 1990 TV miniseries.\n\nLocal vendors will be available with copies of Sharon’s book, posters from John’s films, and other fun Stephen King-related stuff.\n\nPre-order the book (pub date May 20th) via Green Hand Bookshop:\n\nhttps://greenhandbookshop.com/products/stephen-kings-maine-by-sharon-kitchens\n\nOfficial trailer for Pennywise: The Story of ‘It’ documentary:\n\nAbout the author Sharon Kitchens:\n\nSharon Kitchens has lived in Maine for a couple decades. She has\n\nwritten about food and agriculture for a variety of New England publications. Every week she can be seen carrying an armload of library books. She loves hanging out in cafés eating chocolate croissants and sipping lavender lattes. Her fondness for Patti Smith’s poetry is matched only by her love of Taylor Swift’s lyrics. She is a cat and dog person. She recently launched a Substack newsletter.\n\nAbout the filmmaker John Campopiano:"
