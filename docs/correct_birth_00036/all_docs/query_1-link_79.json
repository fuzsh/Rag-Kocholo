        "text": "There was once a Maine island for sale but only for those who could handle it.\n\nWe often joke around about wanting to run away and live remotely on your own island away from others but do you think you could truly rough it out?\n\nThis special Duck Ledges Island is only for those who can truly handle being alone, aren’t scared of perilous storms, and can handle the lack of a septic tank.\n\nLiving on this remote island would be so intense that Stephen King thinks it would make for a killer novel.\n\nDuck Ledges Island in Maine Not Fit for “Man or Beast” in Winter\n\nLocated just a short 10-minute boat ride from Jonesport public marina, a small cottage on a 1.5-acre island was for sale for only $339,000. A woman from New Jersey bought it but she had to earn the right for her offer to even be considered.\n\nThe rustic private island was once owned by Billy Milliken, who had ownership since 2007 until recently, as shared by Insider.\n\nMilliken was presented with plenty of offers well beyond the asking price but to take on ownership of the island came with a different type of price.\n\nTo even be considered the new owner, Milliken required that whoever wanted to buy the island needed to be able to spend one night alone in the small cottage.\n\nA woman from New Jersey had what it takes.\n\nA Woman From New Jersey Buys Duck Ledges Island in Maine\n\nAs the article shares, Charlotte Gale took on the test and spent time alone in the cottage before making the purchase.\n\nMilliken drove her by boat to the island and he shared with Insider that he suspected she was the one when she brought nothing but a waterproof backpack compared to the others who had packed luggage and suitcases.\n\nLiving on a remote island is not for everyone, and the cottage isn’t even inhabitable between October-May because of “perilous storms”.\n\nImagine being alone on an island in the ocean in the dark with waves crashing around you, sitting on 1.5-acres of land only 20 feet from the water’s edge.\n\nNot everyone would be able to handle it.\n\nStephen King Makes Comment About Thrilling Remote Maine Island\n\nIn response to YahooNews posting about the island for sale, horror and sci-fi author (and Mainer!) Stephen King tweeted: “There’s a novel here, just waiting to be written.”\n\nA spooky novel could surely be written about a remote cabin out at sea, although Gale’s set up doesn’t sound so scary. She shared with Insider that she plans on growing a garden around the island and says it’s her happy place and loves being alone.\n\nWhile I would probably feel the same way on my own island, I can also see the scary parts of being out in the ocean only 20-feet from the breaking waves all alone in a 540-square-foot cottage.\n\nThe article said that representatives for King did not respond to a request for comment but that would be one hell of a book.\n\nI don’t read scary stuff but I would definitely read that."
