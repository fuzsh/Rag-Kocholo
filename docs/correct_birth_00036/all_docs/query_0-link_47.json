        "text": "At the time of its opening in 1888, the Hotel del Coronado (a.k.a. \"The Del\" or \"Hotel del\") was the largest resort hotel in the world. It has been featured in several books and films.\n\nL. Frank Baum wrote many of his Oz books at the resort.\n\nStephen King wrote his story 1408 (film release in 2007) from a collection of real-life news stories about parapsychologist Christopher Chacon's investigation of a notoriously haunted room at the hotel.\n\nIt also was the setting for the 1975 novel Bid Time Return by Richard Matheson; however, for the movie version, Somewhere in Time (1980), the story setting and filming were moved to the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, Michigan.\n\nThe hotel is featured on a US Postage Stamp honoring director Billy Wilder, with images of Marilyn Monroe and the hotel from Some Like It Hot (1959). Other films shot here include My Blue Heaven (1990), The Stunt Man (1980), and Wicked, Wicked (1973).\n\nview full location details...\n\nStephen King came up with the idea of what would become his third published novel The Shining after staying at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado with his wife in 1974. The hotel, which was about to close for its off-season, became the basis for the book's fictional Overlook Hotel. They were the only guests there, although King was able to have a drink in the bar served by a bartender named Grady.\n\nSome of The Shining tv mini-series that aired in 1997 (starring Wings Steven Weber as Jack Torrance) was filmed at The Stanley.\n\nThe hotel is rumored to be haunted and if you stay there you can catch Stanley (no relation to the hotel) Kubrick's version of The Shining playing non-stop on channel 42.\n\nview full location details..."
