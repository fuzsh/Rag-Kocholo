        "text": "My Notes\n\nAbout Stephen King\n\nStephen King was born in Maine in 1947. He made his first professional short story sale in 1967. In the fall of 1971, he began teaching high school English classes. Writing in the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories and to work on novels. In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co., accepted the novel Carrie for publication, providing him the means to leave teaching and write full-time. He has since published over 50 books and has become one of the world's most successful writers.\n\nAbout On Writing\n\n“This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit.”\n\nOne exception to the bullshit rule ⇒ The Elements of Style by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White. (it’s short; at eighty-five pages) ⇒ every aspiring writer should read it.\n\nThis is not an autobiography ⇒ It’s an attempt to show how one writer (Stephen King) was formed ⇒ King believes many people have the ability to write and that ability can be improved.\n\nStory ideas\n\nGood story ideas often come out of nowhere ⇒ Often, two previously unrelated ideas come together and make something new ⇒ your job isn’t to find these ideas but to recognize them when they show up.\n\nWriting is scary\n\nFear is at the root of most bad writing ⇒ Good writing is often about letting go of fear and affectation (affectation = writing that is designed to impress).\n\n(Affectation itself is fearful behavior because it begins with the need to define some writing as “good” and other “bad”).\n\nCriticism comes with writing ==> If you write, someone will try to make you feel bad about it ⇒ it’s just a fact.\n\nThe scariest moment about writing is always just before you start. After that, things can only get better.\n\nWriting is a lonely job. ==> “Having someone who believes in you makes a lot of difference. They don’t have to make speeches. Just believing is usually enough.”\n\nKing’s key learnings from Carrie:\n\nA writer’s original perception of a character may be as wrong as the reader’s.\n\nStopping a piece of work just because it’s hard is a bad idea ⇒ “Sometimes you have to go on when you don’t feel like it, and sometimes you’re doing good work when it feels like all you’re managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.”\n\nWhat writing is\n\nWriting = Telepathy. (Good writing allows the reader to see the same thing as the writer.)\n\nThe writing toolbox is made up of\n\nVocabulary\n\nGrammar\n\nStyle\n\nParagraphs\n\nYou build a story one paragraph at a time, constructing each paragraph with your vocabulary, grammar, and style.\n\nGood writing consists of mastering the fundamentals (vocabulary, grammar, the elements of style) and then filling the third level of your toolbox with the right instruments (description, narration, dialogue)\n\n1. Vocabulary\n\n“The basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful.”\n\nPut your vocabulary on the top shelf of your toolbox ⇒ (And don’t make any conscious effort to improve it ⇒ that happens naturally as you read.)\n\nSome writers use enormous vocabularies (e.g. H. P. Lovecraft, T. C. Boyle, and Cormac McCarthy).\n\nOther writers use smaller, simple vocabularies (e.g. Ernest Hemmingway, Theodore Sturgeon, Douglas Fairbairn, and John Steinbeck).\n\n“It ain’t how much you’ve got, honey, it’s how you use it.”\n\nVocabulary includes the stuff you can’t find in a dictionary such as this street speak from Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities:\n\n“Egggh, whaddaya? Whaddaya want from me?”\n\n“Here come Hymie!”\n\n“Unnh! Unnnh! Unnnhh!”\n\n“Chew my willie, Yo’ Honor.”\n\n“Yeggghhh, fuck you, too, man!”\n\nVocabulary is all about meaning ⇒ and a word is only a representation of the meaning ⇒ even at its best, writing almost always falls short of full meaning. (The best you can do is choose vocabulary as close to what you mean as you possibly can; and adjust for appropriateness when you must.)\n\n2. Grammar\n\nYou’ll also want grammar on the top shelf of your toolbox.\n\nRelax ⇒ you probably know most of this stuff anyway.\n\nIt’s important to avoid bad grammar so you can avoid confusing the reader ⇒ Bad grammar can lead to misunderstanding.\n\nBad grammar produces bad sentences.\n\nThere are eight parts of speech:\n\nNoun\n\nPronoun\n\nVerb\n\nAdjective\n\nAdverb\n\nPreposition\n\nConjunction\n\nInjection\n\nNouns and verbs are the two indispensable parts of writing ⇒ Without one of each, no group of words can be a sentence.\n\nA sentence = a group of words containing a subject (noun) and a predicate (verb) ⇒ these strings of words start with a capital letter, end with a period, and combine to make a complete thought which starts in the writer’s head and then leaps to the reader’s. (The sentence is the basic structure for writer-to-reader telepathy.)\n\nYou only need nouns (the words that name) and verbs (the words that act) to create sentences. Examples:\n\nRocks explode.\n\nJane transmits.\n\nMountains float.\n\nPlums deify!\n\nIf you get lost in complex grammar rules, remember how simple a sentence can be and fall back to it.\n\nOther definitions (in case you’re interested):\n\nA gerund is a verb form used as a noun.\n\nA participle is a verb form used as an adjective.\n\nWant to improve your grammar? Buy a copy of John Warriner’s English Grammar and Composition.\n\nTLDR; With grammar, do the best you can.\n\n3. Style\n\nYou should avoid the passive tense ⇒ Verbs come in two types, active and passive:\n\nWith an active verb, the subject of the sentence is doing something.\n\nWith a passive verb, something is being done to the subject of the sentence.\n\nThe adverb is not your friend ⇒ Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. (They usually end in -ly.) ⇒ Instead, replace adverbs with stronger verbs.\n\nWriters typically use adverbs when they are afraid the reader won’t understand them if they don’t.\n\nPart of good writing is about making good choices when it comes to picking the tools you plan to work with. ==> For example, even sentence fragments can “work beautifully to streamline narration, create clear images, and create tension.”\n\n4. Paragraphs\n\nKing argues that the paragraph (not the sentence) is the basic unit of writing (“the place where coherence begins and words stand a chance of becoming more than mere words”).\n\n“Paragraphs are almost as important for how they look as for what they say” ⇒ “they are maps of intent”.\n\nEasy books contain lots of short paragraphs—including dialogue paragraphs which may only be a word or two long—and lots of white space.\n\nHard books, ones full of ideas, narration, or description, have a more substantial look.\n\nIn nonfiction, writing is refined thinking ⇒ Paragraphs should be neat and utilitarian ⇒ ideally, a topic followed by others which explain or amplify the first.\n\nThe basic nonfiction paragraph form = Topic-sentence-followed-by-support-and-description ⇒ It forces the writer to organize his/her thoughts and creates clarity.\n\nIn fiction, the paragraph is less structured ⇒ “it’s the beat instead of the actual melody.” ⇒ they often form on their own (and that’s what you want).\n\nThe object of fiction is to make the reader welcome and then tell a story ⇒ to make him/her forget that he/she is reading a story at all.\n\nThe single-sentence paragraph more closely resembles talk than writing ⇒ Writing is seduction. And good talk is part of seduction.\n\nThe paragraph is “a marvelous and flexible instrument that can be a single word long or run on for pages.”\n\nYou must learn to use it well if you are to write well ==> This means is lots of practice; you have to learn the beat.\n\n“Words have weight” ⇒ “Words create sentences; sentences create paragraphs; sometimes paragraphs quicken and begin to breathe.”\n\nHow to become a good writer\n\nIf you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others:\n\nRead a lot\n\nWrite a lot.\n\nRead a lot.\n\nReading is the creative center of a writer’s life.\n\nEvery book you pick up has its own lessons:\n\nBad books often have more to teach than the good ones (i.e. what not to do).\n\nGood writing teaches the learning writer about different tools: style, narration, plot, characters, and truth-telling.\n\nIf you don’t have time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write\n\nWhere can you read? Everywhere\n\nConstant reading will do two things:\n\nGive you confidence in your writing, and\n\nHelp you avoid making a fool of yourself with your word processor.\n\nWrite a lot\n\nHow often should you right? Write every day and don’t stop unless you absolutely have to.\n\nWhen you should write? Mornings are King’s prime writing time, but this varies from writer to writer.\n\nHow much should you write? King’s goal is ten pages a day (or ~2,000 words) ⇒ That’s 180,000 words over 3 months. (It’s best to set this goal low at first, to avoid discouragement.)\n\nWhere should you write? The space should be humble and have a door that you are willing to shut (a closed door = a commitment to walk the walk.)\n\nEliminate every possible distraction and create a ritual (start and end at about the same time every day.)\n\n“Life isn’t a support-system for art. It’s the other way around.” ⇒ “Put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn’t in the middle of the room.”\n\nWhat should you write about?\n\nWriting about anything you want to as long as you tell the truth.\n\nThe rule used to be “write what you know.” ⇒ King thinks you should interpret this as broadly and inclusively as possible.\n\nWhat you know is what makes you unique.\n\nThere’s a difference between lecturing about what you know and using it to enrich the story. (The latter is good. The former is not.)\n\nAvoid writing to impress (affectation) and writing to make money.\n\nWhen a reader hears strong echoes of his or her own life and beliefs, he or she is apt to become more invested in the story.\n\nStylistic imitation is a fine way to get started as a writer (and impossible to avoid).\n\nFeeling and plot should not be imitated ⇒ “Write what you like, then imbue it with life and make it unique by blending in your own personal knowledge of life, friendship, relationships, sex, and work. Especially work. People love to read about work.”\n\nWhat is a story?\n\nA story is made up of 3 parts:\n\nNarration, which moves the story from point A to point B and finally to point Z;\n\nDescription, which creates a sensory reality for the reader; and\n\nDialogue, which brings characters to life through their speech.\n\nPlot is intentionally left out. King distrust’s plot for two reasons:\n\nOur lives are largely plotless\n\nPlotting and the spontaneity of real creation aren’t compatible.\n\n(“Plot is, I think, the good writer’s last resort and the dullard’s first choice.”)\n\nStories are “found things” ⇒ the job of the writer is to find them and give them a place to grow.\n\nSituation vs story\n\nKing’s books tend to be based on situation instead of story.\n\nKing puts a group of characters in some sort of predicament and then watches them try to work themselves free.\n\nThe situation comes first. The characters come next. And once these things are fixed in King’s head, he begins to narrate.\n\nHe wants characters to do things their way. (He doesn’t worry about the ending… because sooner or later every story comes to an end.)\n\nComing up with interesting situations\n\nThe most interesting situations can usually be expressed as a What-if question:\n\nWhat if vampires invaded a small New England village? (‘Salem’s Lot)\n\nWhat if a policeman in a remote Nevada town went berserk and started killing everyone in sight? (Desperation)\n\nWhat if a cleaning woman suspected of a murder she got away with (her husband) fell under suspicion for a murder she did not commit (her employer)? (Dolores Claiborne)\n\nWhat if a young mother and her son became trapped in their stalled car by a rabid dog? (Cujo)\n\nInversion, or looking at something from the opposite point of view, is one way to create an interesting situation to explore\n\nStory vs plot\n\nThere’s a huge difference between story and plot:\n\nStory is honorable and trustworthy\n\nPlot is shifty\n\n(Exercise) Change the sexes of the traditional antagonist and protagonist in the Estranged Hubby Murders Ex-Wife Plot ⇒ “Narrate this without plotting—let the situation and that one unexpected inversion carry you along.”\n\nWhen you finish your exercise, drop King a line at www.stephenking.com and tell him how it worked for you.)\n\nNarration\n\nNarration = action.\n\nHonesty and storytelling\n\nHonesty in storytelling makes up for a great many stylistic faults ⇒ Be honest about how your characters speak and behave.\n\nIf you lie, your writing will reek of it.\n\nDescription\n\nDescription makes the reader a sensory participant in the story.\n\nClarity is the objective of description.\n\nGood description begins with clear seeing and ends with clear writing, the kind of writing that employs fresh images and simple vocabulary.\n\nGood description is a learned skill ⇒ you cannot succeed at description unless you read and write a lot.\n\nDescription begins with you visualizing what you want the reader to experience ⇒ And it ends with you translating what you see in your mind into written words.\n\n“If you want to be a successful writer, you must be able to describe it, and in a way that will cause your reader to prickle with recognition.”\n\nYou have to get description just right:\n\n“Thin description leaves the reader feeling bewildered and nearsighted.”\n\n“Over-description buries him or her in details and images.”\n\nDescription begins in the writer’s imagination, but should finish in the reader’s.\n\nKing’s tips on how to describe:\n\n“Locale and texture are much more important to the reader’s sense of actually being in the story than any physical description of the players.”\n\n“Good description usually consists of a few well-chosen details that will stand for everything else.” (Often these are the first ones to come to mind.)\n\nKing’s process for calling up his imagination:\n\n“I’ll take a moment to call up an image of the place, drawing from my memory and filling my mind’s eye, an eye whose vision grows sharper the more it is used. I call it a mental eye because that’s the phrase with which we’re all familiar, but what I actually want to do is open all my senses. This memory search will be brief but intense, a kind of hypnotic recall. And, as with actual hypnosis, you’ll find it easier to accomplish the more you attempt it.”\n\nIf I have to tell you, I lose. If, on the other hand, I can show you, I win.\n\nFigurative description\n\nThe use of simile and other figurative language = “the chief delight of fiction”.\n\nWhen on target, a simile or metaphor can delight the reader ⇒ By comparing two seemingly unrelated objects, the reader sometimes sees an old thing in a new and vivid way.\n\nWhen a simile or metaphor doesn’t work, it’s often funny and sometimes embarrassing.\n\nRough comparison is only useful if you and the reader see the world and measure the things in it with similar eyes.\n\nAvoid clichéd similes, metaphors, and images:\n\nHe ran like a madman\n\nShe was pretty as a summer day\n\nThe guy was a hot ticket\n\nBob fought like a tiger\n\nDialogue\n\nDialogue gives your characters their voices ⇒ it is crucial in defining characters.\n\nWhat people say often tells us more about someone's character than what they do.\n\nOne of the cardinal rules of good fiction is never tell us a thing if you can show us.\n\nGood dialogue tells the reader if a character is smart or dumb, honest or dishonest, funny or serious.\n\n“Dialogue is a skill best learned by people who enjoy talking and listening to others—particularly listening, picking up the accents, rhythms, dialect, and slang of various groups.”\n\n“Writing good dialogue is art as well as craft.” ⇒ “You must tell the truth if your dialogue is to have the resonance and realism.”\n\nThe best form of dialogue attribution is said (e.g. he said, she said, Bill said, Monica said.)\n\nCharacters\n\nThe best stories are character-driven ⇒ they end up being about the people rather than the event.\n\nBuilding characters in fiction boils down to two things:\n\nPaying attention to how the real people around you behave, and\n\nTelling the truth about what you see.\n\nDon’t draw fictional characters directly from life (you’ll get sued or shot)\n\nAs a story progresses, King often discovers more about his characters ⇒ If they grow a lot, they begin to influence the course of the story instead of the other way around.\n\nIn real life, no one is “the bad guy” or “the best friend” or “the whore with a heart of gold” ⇒ in real life, we each see ourselves as the main character (the camera is on us).\n\nWhen you ask yourself what a certain character will do given a certain set of circumstances, you’re making the decision based on:\n\nWhat you yourself would or wouldn’t do.\n\nThe character’s traits, both lovely and unlovely, which you observe in others.\n\nPure blue-sky imagination.\n\n“Skills in description, dialogue, and character development all boil down to seeing or hearing clearly and then transcribing what you see or hear with equal clarity.”\n\nOther stuff\n\nThere are lots of other tools too:\n\nOnomatopoeia\n\nAlliteration\n\nIncremental repetition\n\nStream of consciousness\n\nInterior dialogue\n\nChanges of verbal tense\n\nBack story (how do you get it in and how much of it belongs)\n\nTheme\n\nPacing\n\nEtc.\n\nIt’s all on the table ⇒ “you should use anything that improves the quality of your writing and doesn’t get in the way of your story.”\n\nSymbolism and themes\n\nGood fiction always begins with story and progresses to theme; it almost never begins with theme and progresses to story.\n\nSymbolism and themes can serve as focusing devices for you and your reader ⇒ If it’s there, it’s there. If it isn’t, so what? (If it’s there and you notice it, bring it out in a second draft as well as you can to enrich the story.)\n\nYou probably won’t see stuff like this until the story’s done ⇒ “When you write a book, you spend day after day scanning and identifying the trees. When you’re done, you have to step back and look at the forest.”\n\n“If there is any one thing I love about writing more than the rest, it’s that sudden flash of insight when you see how everything connects.”\n\nRevision\n\nEvery book worth reading is about something:\n\nYour job after the first draft is to decide what something or somethings yours is about.\n\nYour job in the second draft is to make that something even more clear. (This may require revisions.)\n\nHow many drafts? King prefers two drafts and a polishing third draft. (Rewriting varies greatly from writer to writer)How\n\nThe first draft should be written with no help (or interference) from anyone else.\n\nThen, let it rest. (how much or how little depends on the individual writer, but King recommends a minimum of six weeks ⇒ this is enough time for you to look at it with fresh eyes)\n\nThen, reread it and:\n\nMake all the notes you want\n\nConcentrate on fixing misspellings and picking up inconsistencies (e.g. character motivations)\n\nDelete adverbs\n\nKnock out pronouns with unclear antecedents\n\nAdd clarifying phrases\n\nFocus on 3 big questions\n\nIs this story coherent?\n\nAnd if it is, what will turn coherence into a song?\n\nWhat are the recurring elements? Do they entwine and make a theme?\n\nIs this story coherent?\n\nAnd if it is, what will turn coherence into a song?\n\nWhat are the recurring elements? Do they entwine and make a theme?\n\nIn the second draft, you want to:\n\nadd scenes and incidents that reinforce the story\n\ndelete stuff that confuses the story.\n\nFormula: 2nd Draft = 1st Draft – 10%. Good luck.”\n\nAdvice from John Gould to King when he was in high school:\n\nWhen you write a story, you’re telling yourself the story. When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story.\n\nWrite with the door closed, rewrite with the door open ⇒ Your stuff starts out being just for you, in other words, but then it goes out.\n\nShare your draft with some first readers, including your ideal reader.\n\nIdeal reader\n\nNovels are really letters aimed at one person ⇒ “Every novelist has a single ideal reader; that at various points during the composition of a story, the writer is thinking, ‘I wonder what he/she will think when he/she reads this part?’” ⇒ Call that one person you write for Ideal Reader.\n\nListen carefully to the things your Ideal Reader didn’t understand ⇒ Then ask yourself if you understand them:\n\nIf you do and just didn’t put those parts across, your job in the second draft is to clarify.\n\nIf you don’t, then you need to think a lot more carefully about the past events that cast a light on your characters’ present behavior.\n\nPace\n\nPace is the speed at which your narrative unfolds ⇒ Move too fast and you risk leaving the reader behind, either by confusing or by wearing him/her out ⇒ Move to slow and you risk boring them.\n\nYour Ideal Reader is also the best way for you to gauge whether or not your story is paced correctly ⇒ Imagine whether he or she will be bored by a certain scene:\n\nIs she going to feel there’s too much pointless talk in this place or that?\n\nWill she think I’ve underexplained a certain situation or overexplained it?\n\nWill she say that I forgot to resolve some important plot point?\n\nWatch for when your I.R. puts your book down - what made it easy for them to put down?\n\nBack story\n\nBack story is all the stuff that happened before your tale began, but which has an impact on the front story ⇒ it helps define character and establish motivations.\n\nWith back story, remember the following: Everyone has a history and most of it isn’t very interesting. (Stick to the parts that are.)\n\nIt’s important to get the back story in as quickly as possible, but with grace ⇒ Readers are more interested in what’s going to happen than what already did.\n\nYour Ideal Reader can help you figure out how well you did with the back story and whether to add to or subtract from it.\n\nResearch\n\nWhen you step away from the “write what you know” rule, research becomes necessary. And it can add a lot to your story, but be careful.\n\nResearch = a special kind of back story. Research belongs in the background. Readers care more about your characters and your story than your research.\n\nWriting classes and seminars\n\nShould you attend writing classes and seminars to improve your writing? King is not a fan ⇒ best to focus on reading and writing.\n\nYou learn best by reading a lot and writing a lot ⇒ and the most valuable lessons are the ones you teach yourself.\n\nAgents\n\nAgents, publishers, and editors are all looking for the next hot writer who can sell a lot of books and make lots of money.\n\nYou must begin as your own advocate, which means reading the magazines publishing the kind of stuff you write and identify the editors.\n\nWhen you send your story out, include a cover letter telling the editor where you’ve published other stuff and a line or two about what this one’s about. Close by thanking him or her for reading.\n\nWhy write?\n\nKing doesn't write for the money; he writes for the joy of it. ⇒ If you can write for the joy of it, you can do it forever.\n\nWriting isn’t about making money, getting famous, getting laid, or making friends. In the end, it’s about enriching the lives of those who will read your work, and enriching your own life as well."
