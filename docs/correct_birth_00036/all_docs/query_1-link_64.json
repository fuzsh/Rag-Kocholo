        "text": "May 19, 2024\n\nWhen I spotted this book on the shelf at Bookstacks, Bucksport, Maine's local bookstore, I grabbed it. There was very little decision. The title grabbed me, and this book was going home with me.\n\nPart Stephen King history, part Maine history (and Stephen King's history in relation with Maine History), it's a very quick read.\n\nI've been reading Stephen King for over a decade, and I'm an avid Maine history buff, so I honestly wasn't expecting to learn any new information (just expecting to enjoy reading the book), so I was pleasantly surprised that I did in fact learn quite a bit from this book.\n\nWhether you're a Stephen King fan, a Maine history fan, or both, I highly recommend reading this book!\n\nJuly 7, 2024\n\nGrowing up in suburban Maryland, I first picked up a Stephen King book in Jr. High school - 1982 or so. I think it was The Dead Zone or Firestarter. I'm not sure which of my parents brought them home. They weren't library books, I still have them. Thus started my fascination with King's works, and that far away place; Maine.\n\nFast forward to 1994 and - by pure coincidence - I not only find myself living in Maine, but right in the heart of King Country. First Durham, now Lisbon. Most of the time, working in Lewiston.\n\nWhile I've played about with the \"where is this, really?\" when reading King's works (especially 11/22/63), Kitchens has pursued and compiled an impressive portrait-infused road map of the geography. Teasing out the small details and influences that underpin both the man and his richly detailed fictional worlds.Truth really is stranger than fiction.\n\nThe personal interviews really add a degree of intimacy. You can feel the weight of time passing and pressing on these small towns coping with progress and what it can leave behind in its wake. (\"Beware the under toad.\" with respects to John Irving.)\n\nBut it's not all about King. While his life and stories have led us to these locales, each one has a life of its own, well worth exploring. Rather than leaving you wondering what to do with your new-found knowledge, Kitchens provides easy to follow, short road-trip itineraries, including tons of food recommendations and a variety of activities, that will bring you closer to these places.\n\nReading this book makes me want to venture out and explore more of King's works (I've fallen a bit behind) and my adopted home state."
