        "text": "Quick Details\n\nHour Glass\n\nDuration: 2.5+ hours\n\nWho: All are welcome, but due to the content and duration, this tour may not be appropriate for younger children. For families traveling with children under 10 we’d ask that you consider a private tour. Private tours can be adjusted to meet the needs of your family. Pets are not allowed on the public tour. The comfort and safety of everyone on the tour is important to us and we are aware some people have allergy issues or anxiety issues. Service dogs (not support dogs) are welcome on all of our tours.\n\nWhen: Times vary seasonally. Please click on the calendar for “real-time” availability.\n\nWhere: All tours depart from SK Tours headquarters at 872 Hammond Street in Bangor.\n\nWhat to expect: There are a few locations where the bus stops and the tour continues on foot. The distance we cover on foot is minimal but is also always optional. If you have serious mobility concerns, please consider a private tour where we will be better able to meet your specific needs. Please dress for the weather and we recommend wearing comfortable shoes.\n\nPLEASE let us know if you are arriving in an RV. We are pretty darn pleased with our new parking lot but keep in mind it is also where we park our buses and it is where other passengers will park their cars. If more than one party arrives in an RV (or pulling a trailer), depending on the size, we may not be able to accommodate everyone.\n\nDuration: The length of the tour will vary from 2.5 to 3 hours. Weather, traffic conditions, and size of the tour group will impact how long the tour lasts. If you are concerned about the length of the tour, a private tour might be a better option. Don’t hesitate to contact us to discuss.\n\nThis tour does not include access to the King house. The King house is the location of the Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation and is not open to the public.\n\nThe Derry, Maine Tour\n\nCome join us for a 2.5+ hour, narrated, bus driven tour of Stephen King’s Derry, Maine. We will visit various locations where Stephen King has lived, worked, places that have inspired his stories, film location, and we will discuss the many charitable contributions from the Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation to our fair city.\n\nDerry, Maine is a fictional town based on Stephen King’s long-time hometown of Bangor, Maine, and has been mentioned in various books and short stories, including IT, Insomnia, 11/22/63, and Bag of Bones.\n\nWith the exception of a few name changes, the maps of Derry and Bangor are quite similar. With its landmarks, clear book and movie references, and accurate history, Derry is a place where King fans can come and see their favorite works comes to life.\n\nWelcome to Derry. Let us show you around.\n\nThis tour does not include access to the King house. The King house is the location of the Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation and is not open to the public."
