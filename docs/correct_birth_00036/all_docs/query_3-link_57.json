He graduated from his state university and continued to live in Maine, at first supporting himself with odd jobs while establishing his writing career. The success of his first horror novel, Carrie (1974), enabled him to publish earlier work under the pseudonym Richard Bachman (1977–84), a ploy which disguised the true extent of his prolific output of novels, short stories, and screenplays, until the ruse became public knowledge and he abandoned it. His own name became synonymous with best- selling novels blending horror, fantasy, and science fiction into a consistently scary mix. His books have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide and include Salem's Lot (1975), The Shining (1977), The Dead Zone (1979), Misery (1987), Gerald's Game (1992), and Cell (2006). He has also written collections of short stories, including Hearts in Atlantis (1999). Several were made into successful films, and he himself tried his hand at film directing. King and his novelist wife live in Bangor, Maine. They have three children: Naomi Rachel, a reverend; Joseph Hillstrom, who writes under the pen name Joe Hill and is a lauded horror-fiction writer in his own right; and Owen Phillip, whose first collection of stories was published in 2005. -taken from biography.com\n\n3 “ON WRITING” The scariest moment is always just before you start. Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open. Your stuff starts out being just for you, in other words, but then it goes out. Once you know what the story is and get it right — as right as you can, anyway — it belongs to anyone who wants to read it. Or criticize it. One of the keys to doing that is to have an honest voice and honest characters with both bad and good sides to them. People we can relate to with all of their faults, If you want to be a better writer you need to read a lot to get fresh input, broaden your horizons and deepen your knowledge. I’ve saved the most important tip for last. To become a better writer you probably – and not so surprisingly – need to write more.\n\n4 HIS WORKS “It” tells the story of a man dressed in a clown suit who terrorizes a group of people.\n\n5 The 1986 movie “Stand By Me” was based on his novella “The Body” from Different Seasons. It is a coming of age story involving four teenage boys out on a quest to find a body.\n\n6 The 1999 film “The Green Mile” is about the death row guards who befriend a prisoner falsely accused of killing a young girl.\n\n7 The 1994 film “The Shawshank Redemption” featured Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. It was nominated for several awards.\n\n8 The 1995 drama “Dolores Claiborne” deals with such controversial issues as spousal abuse and murder.\n\n9 1408 A paranormal expert is haunted by hotel ghost in the 2007 film “1408”.\n\n10 The iconic 1980 film “The Shining” dramatizes the terror and madness that is born from isolation."
