        "text": "Next to the Paul Bunyan statue or the Thomas Hill Standpipe, Stephen King's former house on West Broadway is one of Bangor's most famous landmarks. As such, that location sees quite a bit of vehicle and foot traffic daily.\n\nNow, those \"in the know\" know King himself hasn't lived at the residence in many years, and that the building is now owned by the King Foundation which is managed by an out-of-state financial firm. But that doesn't stop folks from gathering outside the ornate black fence in front of the property to take pictures.\n\nHowever, tourists are not the only thing that seems to be hanging out in front of the home these days.\n\nWhere once there was trampled on grass, has now been replaced with caution tape, cones, dirt, and stones.\n\nIt would appear that the front of the property, the part that goes from the sidewalk to the road, is getting a bit of a facelift.\n\nAt least two large sections that sit along the road will soon be completely covered in cobblestone.\n\nAccording to David Warren, the city's communications manager, it's a project that was initiated by the city because that area gets so much foot traffic.\n\n\"The area in front of the King home where work is being done is actually City land. The City Council over the last couple of years has had concerns with how that area looks. As you know, the home attracts hundreds, if not thousands, of people each year, and the grass there has been worn away and just become a large dirt patch. Based on that Council's concern, the City is installing the cobblestones in an effort to make it more presentable. \"\n\nWarren says that normally, the City wouldn't necessarily get involved with a project like this for a private residence but this is one of those exceptions.\n\n\"This is work that the City has undertaken on its own, rather than based on any request by the King Foundation, although the City has kept the foundation up to speed on the plans. The City wouldn't normally undertake a beautification effort like this in front of a private residence (or at least what was formerly a private residence), but this is a rather extraordinary situation in light of the many, many people who each year come to see the home.\"\n\nWarren said he's been told by Bangor Public Works that the work should be completed in a few weeks."
