Stephen King career

King has written two novels with horror novelist Peter Straub: The Talisman (1984) and a sequel, Black House (2001).

My Pretty Pony (1989), an artistâs book he co-created with designer Barbara Kruger, was released in a limited run of 250 copies by the Whitney Museum of American Art Library Fellows. It was published as a general trade edition by Alfred A. Knopf.

A paperback companion to the Stephen King-written miniseries Rose Red (2002) was The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red (2001). The book was authored by Ridley Pearson and published under anonymous authorship.

The book is written by Ellen Rimbauer in the style of a diary, with annotations added by Joyce Reardon, a fictitious professor of paranormal activity.

The book also includes a made-up afterword by Steven Rimbauer, Ellen Rimbauerâs grandson. Its success led to the creation of The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer, a 2003 television miniseries that served as a prelude to Rose Red and was intended to be a promotional piece rather than a stand-alone work.

A different author was given permission to use Kingâs fictional characters and plot devices in this spin-off, which is an unusual occurrence. In Stephen Kingâs subsequent project, the miniseries Kingdom Hospital, the book tie-in concept was used once more.

In 2004, Richard Dooling, who worked with Stephen King on Kingdom Hospital and penned a number of the miniseriesâ episodes, released a fictional journal titled The Journals of Eleanor Druse. In Rose Red, Dr. Joyce Readon and Ellen Rimbauer are both significant figures, and Eleanor Druse plays a similar role in Kingdom Hospital.

His son Joe Hill and he co-wrote the novella Throttle (2009), which is included in the collection Him Is Legend: Celebrating Richard Matheson.

In the Tall Grass, their second novella project appeared in Esquire in 2012 and was split into two parts. Later, it was made available as an audiobook read by Stephen Lang as an e-book.

The 2017 book Sleeping Beauties, written by King and his son Owen King, is set in a prison for women.

A horror novella set in Kingâs made-up town of Castle Rock, Gwendyâs Button Box (2017) was co-written by King and Richard Chizmar.

Chizmar wrote the entire sequel, Gwendyâs Magic Feather (2019). A full-length novel titled Gwendyâs Final Task, the third book in the series, will be published in February 2022, according to a November 2020 announcement by Chizmar and King.
