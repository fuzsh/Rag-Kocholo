On Friday, the Manoel Theatre will present a concert featuring pianist Balázs Szokolay and the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Brian Schembri.

This concert commemorates the bicentenary of the birth of Franz Liszt, whose music will form the bulk of the programme.

This begins with one of his best-known symphonic poems, Les Préludes, followed by the Piano Concerto N.2. The second half of the concert begins with the overture to Wagner’s Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg and ends with Liszt’s Piano Concerto N.1.

Schembri is director of the MPO. He is also a pianist.

Based in Paris for many years, he has also conducted widely in various European countries including France, the UK, Spain and Portugal and has directed several well-known orchestras.

Szokolay was born in Budapest in 1961, son of composer Sándor Szokolay, a winner of the prestigious Kossuth prize.

He has performed with various renowned orchestras, among them the Birmingham Symphony under Sir Simon Rattle.

He also has a special predilection for performing chamber music either as solo recitalist, in duos or other chamber formations.

He has recorded extensively for the Naxos and Hungaroton labels.

In 1992, one of his Naxos CDs of music by Grieg was declared Record of the Year by London’s The Daily Telegraph.
