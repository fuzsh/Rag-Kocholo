We suggest visitors arrive at the Elbphilharmonie Plaza not later than 30 minutes before the start of the concert or event. Late seating is not guaranteed and latecomers may not be admitted to the concert hall.\n\nConcert tickets for the Grand and Recital Halls authorise a visit to the Plaza from two hours before the start of the concert or event.

The entrance »Elbphilharmonie Hotel« is reserved for »The Westin Hamburg« hotel guests.\n\nPlease find more information about prices and advance booking of the discounted flat rate on this page: arrival by car\n\nAll visitors enter the building via the main entrance; access to the concert hall is via the »Plaza«, the viewing platform on the 8th floor of the Elbphilharmonie. The Plaza can be reached from the entrance area via the long escalator. Your tickets will be checked twice, at the access control in the entrance area and on the Plaza in front of the staircase to the Great Hall.\n\nThe hall entrances are on floors 12, 13, 15 and 16.\n\nThe cloakrooms are located on the 11th floor (fee: € 2). Jackets and handbags may be taken into the hall.\n\nWalking-stick umbrellas, bags sized A3 (42 x 30 cm) or above, luggage and other bulky items must be stored in the lockers (largest size 27 x 87 x 47 cm) located in the corridor leading to the ticket shop on the ground floor (on the right-hand side of the entrance area).\n\nStrollers and prams can be left with the admissions personnel on the Plaza. Wheeled walkers can be handed in at the hall entrances.\n\nIt is forbidden to take photographs or record videos during a concert or event. Video recordings and photography are permitted for private purposes only on the Plaza and in the foyers as well as before the start or following an event in the concert hall, provided that you respect the privacy of other visitors and do not interfere with regular business operations. Employees may not be photographed or filmed.\n\nPhotography, audio or video recordings of concerts and events are strictly prohibited.\n\nEvent-related video recordings or photographs for editorial or commercial purposes must be authorised by the Press Office of the Elbphilharmonie.\n\nAll halls and spaces are accessible for visitors with disabilities. More information at www.elbphilharmonie.de/en/accessibility.\n\nLifts to the Plaza are located in the tunnel on the right-hand side of the Tube (long escalator). From the Plaza, access to the Grand and Recital Hall foyers is via lifts, also located to the right. Please note: cloakrooms for visitors to the Grand Hall are only located on the 11th floor. From there, the upper floors can be accessed via further lifts.\n\nA concert at the Elbphilharmonie is a unique experience for both audience and artists. Guests and musicians alike rave about the precise acoustics in the Grand Hall. You can hear every note, even from the highest balcony.\n\nUnfortunately, the opposite is also true: even presumably quiet noises from the audience are clearly audible in the entire hall. We therefore ask our visitors to take the following recommendations into consideration: Tips for your concert visit"
