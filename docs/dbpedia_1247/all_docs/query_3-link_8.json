        "text": "Toccata Classics continues its exploration of the music of the Hungarian composer Ferenc Farkas (1905–2000) with this second of two releases of his chamber works for cello. As with previous albums in this series, the music here features the characteristics that make Farkas’ music so appealing: catchy tunes, transparent textures, buoyant rhythms and a fondness for Baroque forms and folk-dances. Some of these pieces speak a tougher language that show Farkas to have been in touch with his times, but it is the infectious melodic appeal of most of the music here that carries the day.\n\nGábor Bretz, bass (Tracks 8–14, 18–20)\n\nVeronika Oross, flute (Tracks 3–5, 21–23)\n\nKristóf Baráti, violin (Tracks 1–2, 6–7, 24–26)\n\nEszter Lesták Bedő, violin (Tracks 6–7)\n\nPéter Bársony, viola (Tracks 1–2) , viola d’amore (Tracks 6–7)\n\nMiklós Perényi, cello\n\nMiklós Spányi, harpsichord (Tracks 3–5)\n\nBalázs Szokolay, piano (Tracks 24–26)"
