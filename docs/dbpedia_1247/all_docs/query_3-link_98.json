His grandfather, Imre Csenki (d. 1998), was a composer, conductor and music teacher well known for his revival and celebration of Hungarian folk music. When his parents decided to return to Hungary in 1977, nineyear old Alex spoke only Italian, but his piano playing skills suffered no language barriers: that same year, he won the national competition in rnusic school and gave his first recital in Budapest. It marked the beginning of a lifelong love affair with classical music and the unique voice of the piano.\n\nAlex Szilasi's work has become synonymous with the music of Chopin in Hungary. With 2010 marking the bicentenary of the birth of Chopin, he was busy with international performances honouring the great Polish composer and pianist. He began his studies in Budapest at the Béla Bartók Academy of Music in Budapest, followed by the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, also in Budapest, taught by masters including Ferenc Rados, Sándor Falvai and Peter Solymos. After receiving his diploma in 1993, he toured the world, giving concerts in Austria, in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Poland, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, Turkey, the United States and Canada. From 1998 to 2001, he took the chair of piano faculty at Taegu University in South Korea.\n\nIn 2001, he became the director of the collection \"Esther\" and the complete library of Chopin, presented by Editions Fuzeau (France).\n\nThe Chopin connection runs deep, with Alex deeply imbedded in the music at every level, from the compositions themselves and the recording of Chopin's work, to playing on the same kind of piano Chopin was known to prefer.\n\nAlex Szilasi's commitment to the authenticity of Chopin comes through strongest when he is performing on an authentic Pleyel piano built in 1849, the year of Chopin's death. The Pleyel, configured differently than conventional keyboards of today, was Chopin's favourite model to play on, one he described as \"the last word in perfection.\"\n\nBuilt by his friend Camille Pleyel in Paris, Chopin believed the Pleyel piano was most ideally suited to his music. \"When I feel in good form and strong enough to find my own individual sound, then I need a Pleyel piano,\" he said. Franz Liszt wrote that Chopin \"particularly cherished\" Pleyel pianos \"for their silvery and slightly veiled sonority and their lightness of touch\" and antique keyboard collectors of today assert that notes played on the Pleyel produce a unique sound, dying away quickly, resulting in a completely different texture to the music than the long, sustaining notes of today's pianos.\n\nIn 2005, Alex Szilasi performed a concert at the newly inaugurated Palace of Arts in Budapest in 2005 and presented two 19th century Pleyel pianos as a gift to the magnificent concert hall. The concert was advertised simply as: Chopin - Pleyel - Szilasi, crediting the pianomaker and piano equally with the composer and player, the heart of Szilasi's musical philosophy. Following his success at the Palace of Arts, he was invited to perform a season of concerts in the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, dedicated to romanticism.\n\nThe next year, a series of four seasons made its debut: the complete works of Chopin performed by Alex Szilasi over four years, playing every piece Chopin ever wrote in honour of the approaching bicentennial anniversary of the composer's birth. In addition to these musical evenings, concerts were performed throughout Hungary in various cities, universities and museums.\n\nFrom these 2006-2010 performances, four CD compilations have been released by the Hungaroton Classic label, all under the umbrella title \"The Complete Bicentennial Edition of the Works of Chopin\". The first is subtitled Valses (Waltzes), the second, a two-disc compilation, Mazurkas, the third contains all Polonaises, and the fourth presenting the art of Chopin's songs. Authentic Pleyel pianos are used for every recording.\n\nIn 2010 Alex Szilasi celebrated the opening concerts of the bicentenial year of Chopin's birth in Poland (Bydgoszcz 19/02/2010) and Hungary (Budapest 01/03/2010) performing on both concerts orchestral piano works of Chopin, on Pleyel P-280 Concert Grand piano, directly disposed by Pianos Pleyel factory (Paris - France). The concert was broadcasted by the MR3 Bartok national radio channel and the \"DUNA TV\", the national satellite TV channel.\n\nSzilasi's credits and awards are numerous, but among them are: Soloist for Radio Hungary (1991); winning Italy's GIA competitions and the and Kawai Prize in 1994 and 1995 respectively; Hungary's Kölcsey Cultural Prize in 2005.

He was the first pianist who played in Hungary on the newest ultramodern Pleyel piano designed by Peugeot Design Lab in Paris.\n\nSince 2015, Alex Szilasi is the guest of different festivals and concert halls in the People Republic of China.\n\nHe owned yearlong radio program every week called \"Chopiniana\" on Radio Classic Hungary in 2009, and organize regularly romantic salons in different locations (museums, institutions, private locations).\n\nAlex Szilasi owns a single collection of ancient pianos, among them two Pleyel pianos from Chopins time (1843, 1847) and two Erard pianos (1847, 1866).\n\nHe is co-owner of Zeneszalon Concert and Piano Ltd. in Budapest, wich is organizing concert events, and lend and sell pianos of the romantic period.

However, in the questionable arbitrariness, they revealed of the master, the elaborate appearance open to diversified solutions. Rossella Marcantoni, soprano of modernity, did not choose the path of metamorphosis, but that of elevation. He took to the extreme what is classic, cultured, and even sacred is inherent in Ferré, he transferred his melodies to the high areas of vocality lyrical, he freed them in a sound of crystal pure as evocative shards of poignant emotion, he added in the sublime the absolute tension that animates every existing instance of the poetcomposer. From a strict Orthodox discipline Rossella Marcantoni knew, for choice, break away periodically to explore other expressed terrains, from vocal music to chamber to the contemporary one, experimenting with new sound morphologies. In our case, even staying in the technical and timbre registers that best add to its potential, we have the feeling that the singer has found a vocal cross between internal voice and lyrical voice, a tone independent, more realistic, more accessible even to those who are not passionate about opera.\n\nAnd if Ferré said, about his Genesis \"Je suis dicté\" , so Marcantoni could affirm \"I am Sung\".\n\nThe \"ferreiana\" experience gave birth to the recording of the CD Les Fleurs du Mal en Musique Léo Ferré / Charles Baudelaire, recorded in world premiere for the label Movimento Classical of Milan. The CD, reviewed by Aldo Nicastro in the monthly music of January 2016, highlights the particular timbre quality of Rossella Marcantoni's voice, defined as luminous:...brava la singer to assert the right to adhere to the baudelairian saying with an appropriate recited dramatic, which explains its very strong desecrating value.\n\nShe has performed several times at the festival Ferré of San Benedetto del Tronto, alongside icons of chanson French such as Juliette Greco, Georges Moustaki and others.
