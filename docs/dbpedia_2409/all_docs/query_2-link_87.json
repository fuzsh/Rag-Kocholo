        "text": "FEW people really like the idea of a cheap hotel. For the budget-minded, bed-and-breakfasts are cute and cozy, and hostels have a kind of scruffy glamour. The cheap hotel seems undignified by contrast. It conjures mysterious, Hollywood-inspired images of solitary business trips, anonymous trysts, the barebones room where a film's young hero stays when he first comes to the big city.\n\nAs it happens, I've been thinking about the subject lately. My boyfriend, Dan, and I have spent the last week in pursuit of good, cheap hotels in London, a city where budget accommodation is in notoriously short supply.\n\nIn September 2002, when Mayor Ken Livingstone announced a new push to lure visitors, he listed the dearth of reasonably priced hotels as one of London's chief problems in attracting tourists. The outlook hasn't improved much since: in June 2003, the real estate company Jones Lang LaSalle published a Hotel Affordability Index, which ranked London's hotel rooms as the most expensive in the world by a substantial margin. So an assignment to find four hotels in central London for around $100 a night was a challenge.\n\nCould we find, we wondered, not just a passably clean cheap hotel, but one that was also pleasant, even charming? We spent two days searching the Internet and on foot, and then stayed at four hotels in five days, spending between £55 and £90 per night (about $93 to $153, at the current exchange rate of $1.70 to the pound), including the 17.5 percent V.A.T. Two of the hotels were privately owned, and two were part of chains; three had private baths, and only one had a bathroom down the hall. We found that while it is possible to find a lovely, comfortable and relatively inexpensive hotel room in London, doing so requires luck and some patient navigation of hotel bargain Web sites.\n\nOur first pick was the Express by Holiday Inn-London City, with a marvelous location on Old Street in Hoxton, a youngish neighborhood that is the current epicenter of the London art scene. It's just a short hop from Hoxton Square, with its galleries and bars. In this showy, self-consciously hip landscape, the staid, practical Holiday Inn looks almost incongruous. We found an Internet rate of $153 including V.A.T. for a double on www.ichotelsgroup.com, and rushed to book a room for the following night.\n\nWhen we arrived, we found ourselves waiting behind a large group of 10- and 11-year-old Italian children, accompanied by a handful of adults. A church group? A Scout troop? We couldn't tell. The kids seemed exhausted, and sat slumped against piles of suitcases as their chaperones paid for their rooms. While the Italians took turns going up in the elevators, we presented the printout of our Internet reservation, and a brusque desk clerk handed us a key card for Room 335.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
