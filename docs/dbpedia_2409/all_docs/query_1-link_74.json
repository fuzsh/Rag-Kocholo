        "text": "“The only two people I’ve ever been afraid of,” Frank Sinatra once said, “are my mother and Tommy Dorsey.”\n\nBiographer James Kaplan begs to differ. His mother, Dolly, did indeed frighten and inspire the kid from Hoboken, but the other figure who kept him terrified wasn’t the band leader, but the love of his life, Ava Gardner.\n\nIn his highly detailed account of the early life of this “exquisitely sensitive genius,” Kaplan explains how the icon of American music was alternately coddled and abused by his Mafia-esque mom. Once, in a fit of anger, Dolly pushed him down a flight of stairs, knocking him unconscious. She hit him regularly with a policeman’s billy club that she kept behind the bar.\n\nAva, meanwhile, abused the adult Frank in different ways. Scared of intimacy, she first embraced him, then tormented him. Jealousy was their emotional ammunition.\n\n“She was a pisser, she scared the s – – outta me,” Sinatra said. “Never knew what she’d hate that I’d do.”\n\nThat’s Frank describing his mother to Shirley MacLaine. But as Kaplan notes, it could have described Ava, too. Sinatra was Chairman of the Board, but facing these two women he was a little boy again — not knowing if he’d get the hug or the nightstick.\n\nDOLLY\n\nNatalie “Dolly” Sinatra was a gregarious figure, with a mouth that would make longshoremen blush, who both spoiled and nitpicked her only child. She worked as a midwife after Sinatra’s birth in 1915, performing secret abortions as well, earning the nickname “Hatpin Dolly.”\n\nFrank’s father, Marty Sinatra, had been a bantamweight prizefighter, fighting under the name Marty O’Brien because of the anti-Italian prejudice at the time. Despite their ethnicity, Dolly made sure they got ahead. She became a Hoboken ward leader, collecting favors in exchange for votes. She even got Marty a coveted job at the fire department despite his being illiterate and Irish in nickname only.\n\nThe couple owned a bar, Marty O’Brien’s, that was frequented by guys like Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel and Lucky Luciano. Luciano was born in the same Sicilian village as Frank’s grandfather. Sinatra hung around the bar after school doing his homework and singing atop the player piano for nickels or quarters. Frank admired these men and the power they wielded, particularly in the economic turmoil of the Great Depression. It was “small wonder,” Kaplan writes, “that when the real Mafiosi met Sinatra, they smiled as they shook his hand. It wasn’t just his celebrity . . . it was that part of Dolly that her son always carried with him: his own inner godfather. He both wanted to be one of them and — in spirit and in part — really was.” The association, though, garnered Frank an FBI file that would cause trouble for him throughout his career.\n\nSinatra’s education was the radio, Bing Crosby his headmaster. Forty-seven days into high school, he either dropped out or was expelled. He was not yet 16.\n\nCompletely unqualified for the position of sports writer at the Jersey Observer, Frank lied that his godfather and namesake, Frank Garrick, gave him the position. When Garrick had to fire Sinatra, Frankie cursed him out. “Like Dolly, he resented authority in any guise — especially when he knew he was wrong,” Sinatra’s daughter Tina says. “The more you yanked him by the neck, the less he liked it, and the more he’d dig in his heels.”\n\nIt’s telling that Sinatra did not speak to Garrick for five decades after that. A 66-year-old Sinatra went to visit an 85-year-old Garrick in their retirement apartment in Hoboken. After presenting gifts with the promise of more to come, the two men embraced and wept. Sinatra tells his godfather he didn’t come before because he was scared, “but now Dolly is gone and it’s safe.”\n\nSportswriting was just a distraction, anyway. With a charge account at the local department store, Sinatra got himself a white yachting cap with gold filigree, new suits, and even a pipe like his idol Bing. Dolly paid for everything, from the Chrysler to the microphones. He acquired a new nickname, “Slacksey O’Brien.”\n\nFrank made the rounds; he visited radio stations and entered amateur contests. He pestered a singing trio of Hoboken Italian boys known as the Three Flashes to sing with them at their gig at the Rustic Cabin, where there was a live remote broadcast on New York’s WNEW. He drove the Flashes, who did not own car, into the city and watched them perform. That’s where they met talent show host Major Bowes. Dolly, stepping in again, sends word to the boys’ parents that, “she would be very disappointed if her son were not included in the audition for the great Major Bowes.” Thus the Hoboken Four was christened, and on Sept. 8, 1935, they won the Original Amateur Hour contest.\n\nOne week later, they joined the Major Bowes tour, and Frank was on the road, having any woman — young or old, married or not — that he could bed. Dolly realized this was going to be trouble. So, as was her way, she pushed forward with her plan — Frank would have to marry his childhood sweetheart, Nancy Barbato. She was a nice girl from a good family who would make good babies, take care of a household and, Dolly thought, never threaten her supremacy. They wed on Feb. 4, 1939.\n\nThe next decade turns Sinatra into a star, as he tours first with Harry James’ band, then Tommy Dorsey’s. Touring with Dorsey is where Frank worked on his unique sound. He swam underwater and ran laps. He listened to classical music and practiced “calisthenics for the throat.” Sammy Cahn recalled watching Sinatra sing with Dorsey: “Frank can hold a tremendous phrase, until it takes him into a sort of paroxysm — he gasps, his whole person seems to explode, to release itself.” Sinatra was bringing the big band era to an end and ushering in the age of the solo vocalist.\n\nHis marriage did little to stop his womanizing. The gossip columns were full of his affairs, actresses Marilyn Maxwell and Lana Turner among others. By 1946, Frank and Nancy were in open warfare. Despite Nancy insisting on more control over the purse strings, Sinatra bought his parents a new home in Weehawken for $22,000. Mother would always come first.\n\nAVA\n\nSinatra said that if he had all the dalliances the press said he had, “I’d now be speaking to you from a jar at the Harvard Medical School.”\n\nWho needed rumors, anyway? Frank wasn’t discreet, especially when it came to his most famous affair, Ava Gardner. In 1949, after Frank and Nancy had separated and reconciled and had three children together, Sinatra decided he was going to marry Ava, forgetting, for the moment, that he was already married.\n\nThe bad press, especially gossip columnists, were relentless; Ava was being accused of being a scarlet woman, a home wrecker. Ava was real trouble, she cared about nothing except having a good time. She was that most dangerous of creatures, a gorgeous nihilist. But Frank’s love for Ava was a grand passion. In Ava, he had literally met his match.\n\nA large portion of Kaplan’s book takes us through their tumultuous relationship. Ava drove Frank crazy with jealousy and passion and betrayal. She was his equal in immense appetites, for food, drink, cigarettes, diversion, companionship and sex. Both hated being alone. Ava was a foulmouthed and dominant facsimile of Dolly; she wielded the metaphorical baton. Frank’s friend Jimmy Van Heusen took to calling her “The Man.”\n\nAva had it all worked out: If Frank wouldn’t get a divorce, she was free to do whatever she wanted. The infidelities had their desired effect — while Nancy had opposed a divorce on religious grounds, he finally wore her down, and was wiped out financially by their split. Shortly after, on Nov. 7, 1951, Frank and Ava married.\n\nFrank told her, “All my life, being a singer was the most important thing in the world. Now you’re all I want.”\n\nTheir riotous marriage played out in the press, as they fought and made up passionately. After one particularly spectacular quarrel, Ava watched Frank from the wings staring at him as he sang. A Chicago reporter asks her, “Hey, Ava — come on — what do you see in this guy? He’s just a 119-pound has-been!”\n\nNot even blinking, she said, “Well, I’ll tell you — 19 pounds is c – – -.”\n\nFrank’s professional career had stalled by the 1950s. He couldn’t get work while new wife Ava was the fair-haired MGM star. On the long flights to see her on set in Africa and Spain, Sinatra became obsessed with the novel “From Here to Eternity.” The character Angelo Maggio was perfect for him. Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures bought the screen rights, and the book was to be made into a movie. Frank relentlessly lobbied the studio, the director and producers to get a shot.\n\nIt’s not a horse head in the bed but Ava who gets him the role, Kaplan says. She appealed to Joan Cohn, Harry’s wife, to ask her husband to consider Frank. “He wants that part more than anything in the world, and he’s got to have it, otherwise I’m afraid he’ll kill himself . . . please, just get him a test.”\n\nFrank’s test goes well but the studio wants Eli Wallach. When negotiations with Wallach fall apart, Sinatra gets his shot, and in 1954 wins the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nIt was the highest point of Frank’s career to date, and wife Ava was in Spain, in the arms of a matador. He got everything he wanted — except her.\n\nFrank: The Voice\n\nby James Kaplan\n\nDoubleday"
