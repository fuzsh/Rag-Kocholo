        "text": "Import assay comparisons\n\nFigure compares uptake of ferrous ions by HEK293 cells for a series of situations that illustrate how DMT1 can release an external/internal concentration gradient to generate cellular uptake and that hinokitiol is effective in the same conditions whereas C2deoxyhinokitiol (C2d, an inactive control for hinokitiol) is ineffective. This effectiveness demonstrates that hinokitiol can replace DMT1 for import of ferrous iron.\n\nResults similar to Fig. were obtained with HEK293 cells capable of expressing mouse 1B/− IRE DMT1 (not shown). Our results with hinokitiol confirm and extend those obtained by Grillo et al. (2017), supporting hinokitiol as a potential treatment modality for DMT1 deficiency and the concentration gradient rationale offered. DMT1 fails to transport Fe3+ unless supported by a ferrireductase to convert it to Fe2+ (Conrad et al. 2000; Fleming et al. 1998; Mackenzie and Garrick 2005), whereas hinokitiol enables Fe3+ entry (Grillo et al. 2017). We tested Fe3+ entry in this HEK293 system (Fig. ).\n\nThe ordinate for Fig. is × 7.5 greater than that for Fig. to allow coverage of the increased expression of DMT1 in the former; so one should recognize that hinokitiol actually imports Fe2+ faster than Fe3+. Similar results were obtained with HEK293 cells capable of expressing rat 1A/+ IRE DMT1. The results with hinokitiol confirm and extend those obtained by Grillo and colleagues (Grillo et al. 2017) to indicate that hinokitiol can enable the import of iron in its ferric form whereas DMT1 does not do so (Conrad et al. 2000). Nevertheless, the import is faster with ferrous ions as they had also noted after incorporating hinokitiol into liposomes (Grillo et al. 2017). Because DMT1 supports uptake of Mn2+, we then also tested whether hinokitiol did so as well (Fig. ).\n\nResults similar to Fig. were obtained with HEK293 cells capable of expressing rat 1A/+ IRE DMT1. The results with hinokitiol confirm and extend those obtained before (Grillo et al. 2017) to indicate that hinokitiol does not enable Mn2+ import. Although it is clear that hinokitiol can rely on concentration gradients of external/internal Fe2+, its behavior is clearly distinct in this role from that of DMT1 because DMT1 can similarly import Mn2+ based on concentration gradients of external/internal Mn2+, gradients that are not utilized by hinokitiol. Moreover, hinokitiol directly permits Fe3+ import while DMT1 does not.\n\nKinetics for transport by hinokitiol\n\nTransporters like DMT1 act as macromolecular catalysts similar to enzymes. As such they follow Michaelis–Menten kinetics (Eq. 1) (Michaelis and Menten 1913).\n\nE+S⇌ES→E+P\n\n1\n\nwhere E = enzyme (or transporter for this analysis); S = substrate (here, extracellular Fe); ES = enzyme/substrate complex; P = product (here, intracellular Fe) and rate constants kf, kr and kcat are assigned to the forward and reverse reactions plus to conversion to P, respectively.\n\nEquation 1 is usually analyzed further\n\nv=d[P]/dt=Vmax·S/Km+S\n\n2\n\nwhere v = the initial velocity for formation of product; Vmax = the maximal velocity and Km = (kr + kcat)/kf. This result assumes that [S] > [E] so that one sees a saturable process but the left hand side of Eq. 1 is symmetrical in E and S.\n\nThis property of transporters encouraged us to compare hinokitiol head-to-head to DMT1 in such an assay of transport or catalysis as one can argue that the concentration response to Fe2+ for a channel like hinokitiol could also follow Michaelis–Menten kinetics. We therefore examined this response for hinokitiol with time dependency graphs like those in Fig. as the basis for the initial velocity in each point (Fig. ). Prior to being able to use nonlinear least squares fits to estimate Km and Vmax, various transformations were used to linearize the graphs of which the classical approach (Lineweaver and Burk 1934) takes the reciprocals of both sides of Eq. 2 to give a linear result:\n\n1/v=1/Vmax+Km/Vmax·1/S\n\n3\n\nSupplementary Fig. S1 shows a Lineweaver–Burk plot for the same data with an acceptable linear fit. The differences in the estimates for Km (242 vs 455) and Vmax (3.5 vs 4.3) are mostly attributable to the inverse weighting in a reciprocal plot so we chose to use the latter two values in Table . The fit to Michaelis–Menten kinetics (Fig. ) for 1000 nM hinokitiol as a catalyst is suitable even though the [S] values are in a range comparable to those for [E] so we used the same approach to ascertain the Km and the Vmax when 500 nM hinokitiol was present and [Fe2+] was varied (Table ) and obtained an essentially identical Km while the Vmax was essentially halved. We also applied this approach to analyses for Fe3+ entry (Table ) and observed that hinokitiol had a decreased apparent affinity for it but allowed more rapid entry. In contrast, the Burke group found by more direct measurements that the affinity for Fe(III) was much higher than for Fe(II) (Grillo et al. 2017). Noting that the left side of Eq. 1 is symmetrical in E and S, we tested if hinokitiol (E) could also be evaluated by this approach (Table ) and obtained kinetic parameters again.\n\nTable 1\n\nConcentration constantConcentration variedVmaxKm500 nM hinokitiolFe2+2.2 ± 0.1448 ± 661000 nM hinokitiolFe2+4.3 ± 0.2455 ± 86500 nM hinokitiolFe3+24.1 ± 3.31790 ± 5001000 nM hinokitiolFe3+87 ± 83010 ± 510200 nM Fe2+Hinokitiol5.8 ± 1.26000 ± 2400500 nM Fe2+Hinokitiol15.7 ± 5.413,200 ± 7000200 nM Fe3+Hinokitiol6.2 ± 1.11620 ± 848500 nM Fe3+Hinokitiol10.1 ± 0.6545 ± 117\n\nThe results with hinokitiol extend those obtained by Grillo et al. (2017), demonstrating that this small molecule can substitute for DMT1 for Fe2+ entry into cells provided that there is a concentration gradient of the substrate across the plasma membrane. They also show that saturable kinetics apply to using hinokitiol in place of DMT1 with Fe2+ entry into cells. Hinokitiol can also do this for Fe3+ entry unaided whereas DMT1 requires reduction of the substrate prior to entry and again a Km analysis is applicable. Remarkably, one can also hold the initial concentration of ferrous or ferric ions constant, vary the hinokitiol concentration and fit the results to Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The saturable behavior could be due to the symmetry of E and S on the left hand side of Eq. 1 or to the solubility of hinokitiol in the relevant membrane (here the plasma membrane).\n\nAssessing hinokitiol’s chelation of metal ions\n\nIt is also important to learn how hinokitiol interacts with other metal ions, given their physiological and toxicological implications. Rather than develop assays for radioactively tagged metal ions, we adapted another assay. Grillo et al. (2017) also showed that hinokitiol is able to partition metal ions into a lipid layer after chelating them. We used this assay to verify our results with Fe and Mn ions paralleled the data on import of these metal ions, then extended it to using other metal ions. Figure illustrates results for 59Fe2+, 59Fe3+ and 54Mn2+ analyses.\n\nThese results with hinokitiol also confirm and extend those obtained by Grillo et al. (2017) showing that ferrous (Fig. a) and ferric (Fig. b) iron both bind to hinokitiol rendering the iron able to partition to the organic phase. Consistent with more effective import by hinokitiol of ferrous (Fig. c) than ferric (Fig. c but note the y-scale) iron, ferric iron extracts less well after binding to hinokitiol. Based on the transport results, one might also expect that hinokitiol does not chelate Mn2+ without an excess of the chelator so that it will not appear in the organic phase. This expectation was tested and met (Fig. c).\n\nBecause of the regulatory complexity of working with radioisotopes for the other metals of interest, we chose to modify this extraction assay to have the results ascertained via inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). First, however, we examined the concentration dependence in the assay above to assure that the higher concentrations needed for ICP-OES should produce interpretable results. Supplementary Fig. S2 portrays these analyses with the data indicating that C2d binds neither ferrous (S2a) nor ferric (S2b) ions consistent with Figs. b and b, respectively, where the control does not support their import. Fig. S2 shows that hinokitiol, however, does bind the two ions with ferrous (S2a) clearly associating more effectively than ferric (S2b), consistent with the Km results in Table .\n\nThe next experiments tested whether the results for ICP-OES were equivalent to those with radioisotope tags for the three metal ions already examined. Supplementary Fig. S3 illustrates results for Fe2+ analysis. The bar graph like Fig. a supports the distinction between hinokitiol as chelating ferrous ions and allowing their extraction into an organic phase versus the negative control that does not chelate them is a property that reproduces over at least a 5000-fold range of Fe2+ concentrations. We surveyed some of the metals ultimately tested at this level (10 µEq/L with 20 µM hinokitiol) and were usually unable to detect partitioning (data not shown). Because the Burke group found that they had to use higher, non-physiological concentrations of most other metals, we also tested similar high levels; data for Cd2+ are representative (Supplementary Fig. S4). The results show that statistically significant amounts of this toxic ion appear in the organic phase when hinokitiol is present; but the actual quantity is close to minimal. These data are summarized in Table as also are similar data for Pb2+; they indicate that accumulation of toxic levels of either metal ion due to hinokitiol substituting for DMT1 is not a likely problem.\n\nTable 2\n\nMetal ionHinokitiolC2d P N 200 nM 59Fe2+34.7 ± 0.50 ± 0.1< 0.00053200 nM 59Fe3+11.0 ± 0.50 ± 0.3< 0.00053350 nM 54Mn2+0 ± 0.600 ± 0.580.985310 μM Fe2+145 ± 89− 5.5 ± 4.60.00066100 μM Cd2+0.04 ± 0.02− 0.001 ± 00.00283100 μM Pb2+0.181 ± 0.140.01 ± 0.12400.00396100 μM Mn2+0.014 ± 0.010 ± 0.0020.00326100 μM Cu1+0.02 ± 0.0120.005 ± 0.0060.00386100 μM VO2+0.003 ± 0.002− 0.001 ± 0.0060.0866100 μM Zn2+0.016 ± 0.026− 0.008 ± 0.0080.0096100 μM Cu2+0.002 ± 0.01− 0.009 ± 0.0020.0096100 μM Co2+0.031 ± 0.016− 0.003 ± 0.0040.176100 μM Ni2+− 0.013 ± 0.004− 0.012 ± 0.0020.516\n\nThese results with hinokitiol also confirm and extend those obtained by Grillo et al. (2017). The portion of 59Fe2+ that is extracted with C2d is 0; while with hinokitiol it is 34.7 ± 0.5% (Table ). These results illustrate the properties of hinokitiol that permit it to substitute for DMT1 in ferrous ion import. One might also expect that hinokitiol must chelate Fe3+ so that it too will appear in the organic phase. This expectation was tested in a similar fashion; again the control does not lead to any counts in the organic phase while hinokitiol retrieves 11.0 ± 0.5% (Table ). Mn is clearly not transported nor is it extracted (Table ) until non-physiological levels are present. Whereas DMT1 imports multiple other metal ions of physiological or toxicological relevance and has also been tested for other ions that remain controversial, Table indicates that substituting hinokitiol for DMT1 is unlikely to cause import any of these ions to an extent that will ordinarily impact their metabolic behavior.\n\nMetal ion interactions, round 1\n\nWhile hinokitiol binds to and supports the import of ferric ions, DMT1 does not (Fig. ). This result is a reminder that nearly two decades have passed since clear published results showed that there were separate pathways for ferrous and ferric iron import (Conrad et al. 2000), yet only the path for the former has seen more publications to elaborate on it. The participants in the latter pathway remain largely uncharacterized except to the extent that multiple ferrireductases that divert Fe3+ into the Fe2+ pathway are now known (McKie et al. 2001; Ohgami et al. 2006; Tripathi et al. 2015). Hinokitiol, however, can import Fe3+ without prior reduction.\n\nThe situation is also different for Mn2+ (Fig. ) with DMT1 effectively importing this metal ion, but hinokitol unable to do so until the level of Mn2+ (Table ) is far above what is physiological. The potential for DMT1 to transport Mn in addition to iron was initially noted in the study that led to the acronym DCT1 (Gunshin et al. 1997)—for divalent cation-transporter 1—but it soon generated a better appreciation for how iron and manganese metabolism interact in both physiological and toxic fashions (Roth and Garrick 2003). One would therefore not expect hinokitiol to have a direct impact on these interactions in the ways that DMT1 does.\n\nTransport kinetics\n\nThe original treatment of Eq. 2 (Michaelis and Menten 1913) relied on the assumption that [S] ≫ [E] so that one could use the input concentration of S as [S]. If, however, one considers that the activities of S and E are the more chemically appropriate values, this treatment might still apply [as well as the linearization in Eq. 3 (Lineweaver and Burk 1934)] despite our using concentrations of hinokitiol not much below the range (~ 3–4 μM) of the Km for DMT1. We chose therefore to find out whether similar saturation curves and linearizations were the result for varying [Fe2+], asking if they were similar to those for DMT1 (Garrick et al. 2006a). They were (Fig. , Supplementary Fig. S1) and the Km’s (Table ) even indicated that hinokitiol had a higher affinity for Fe2+ by nearly an order of magnitude. We also then did similar analyses for Fe3+ to find that the affinity of hinokitiol for these ions was × ~ 5 less (Table ). Because it was easy to vary the level of the hinokitiol, we also did Km studies for it. We again observed a saturable process (Table ). It is beyond the scope of the current paper to address whether the process was due to limiting constant quantities of the substrate or another component of the system like the ability to solubilize hinokitiol in the plasma membrane. It is novel to find that this type of kinetic analysis can be applied to a small molecule substituting for the transporter and hence inverted between the catalyst and the reactant.\n\nMetal ion interactions, round 2\n\nThere have been many studies showing that DMT1 is relatively promiscuous in terms of which metal ions it can transport (Arredondo et al. 2003, 2014; Bannon et al. 2002, 2003; Davidson et al. 2005; Garrick et al. 2003, 2006a, b; Gunshin et al. 1997; Illing et al. 2012; Jiang et al. 2013; Knöpfel et al. 2005; Roth and Garrick 2003) while dysfunction after mutation implies it serves iron homeostasis primarily (Fleming et al. 1997, 1998; Gunshin et al. 2005). The consensus adds Cd2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, VO2+ and Zn2+ to the metal ions it can transport, while excluding Fe3+ and Cu2+. Cu1+ has seen some debate but current support looks sufficient (Arredondo et al. 2003, 2014; Jiang et al. 2013). Clearly this promiscuity indicates that DMT1 not only serves iron import but also involves some toxic risks and may support other metal ion transporters by providing some redundancy to exploit. We therefore asked if hinokitiol was similarly promiscuous. To screen the variety of cations, we verified that the combination of lipophilicity and chelation as properties of hinokitiol (Grillo et al. 2017) to which the Burke lab attributed its ability to substitute for DMT1 did parallel our positive metal ion import results with radioisotope tagged Fe2+ and Fe3+ (Fig. , Supplementary Fig. S2) and the negative results with Mn2+ (Fig. ). Adopting a variation of the assay relying on ICP-OES, we still saw consistency with the Fe data (Supplementary Fig. S3) and established that hinokitiol works, but minimally for the toxic metal ion, Cd2+ (Supplementary Fig. S4). To the extent that one can rely on this partition assay, our data do not support physiological transport of the other metal ions tested in Table . Thus we conclude that hinokitiol has a narrower substrate specificity than DMT1, a property that may be an advantage in terms of interacting with the homeostasis of these metal ions and particularly in terms of not importing toxic metals like Cd and Pb. Hinokitiol’s ability to import Fe3+ could pose an issue relative to iron overload but clearly Fe2+ import by hinokitiol is more effective than for Fe3+ so a little caution in monitoring iron status while using hinokitiol appears to be what this property calls for rather than excluding the use of hinokitiol.\n\nExtractions\n\nFor 59Fe experiments, [Fe] = 200 nEq/L in Hank’s Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) unless otherwise specified; while hinokitiol and C2d were 500 nM. As iron binding of hinokitiol is tridentate, the concentrations chosen provided a modest excess of Fe. When Fe2+ was present, this status was achieved by having a × 10 excess of FeSO4 relative to the 59Fe and a × 10 excess of ascorbic acid relative to the FeSO4. When Fe3+was present, this status was achieved by having a × 10 excess of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) present relative to the 59Fe. For 54Mn experiments, [Mn] = 350 nEq/L was achieved by adding MnCl2. All extractions involved 1 mL for the aqueous phase and an equal volume of hexane. Tubes were vortexed at low speed, allowed to settle and aliquots of the two phases removed and allowed to dry in a fume hood then counted in a LKB Compugamma 1282 γ counter.\n\nFor nonradioactive experiments, the metals were at 10 or 100 μEq/L in HBSS; while hinokitiol and C2d were 20 or 200 μM, respectively, leading to a slightly larger excess of metal ion than in the radioactive extractions. Metals were provided as FeSO4 (with a × 10 excess of ascorbate), FAC, MnCl2, Pb(CH3CO2)2, Cd(CH3CO2)2, CoCl2, NiCl2, VOSO4, Cu(CH3CO2)2 with a × 10 excess of histidine, Zn(CH3CO2)2 and CuSO4 with both histidine and ascorbate in × 10 excess. Extractions were performed as above but metals were determined using ICP-OES (Model Optima 4300D, Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT) after drying the two phases in a fume hood and dissolving an aliquot of each in 3 N HCl/10% trichloracetic acid."
