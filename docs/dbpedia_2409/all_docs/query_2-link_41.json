        "text": "I am aghast. \"If refusing to admit women is morally and legally indefensible, then how do you defend single sex women's spaces like spas, gyms, swimming pools and women-only clubs?\" This was the question posed by Toby Young on Radio 4 last night, in response to the Guardian exposé of the Garrick Club's exclusive \"old boys club\"* membership. (*Literally, it is a club for 'old' boys of a certain wealth and standing). I find Toby Young's question disturbing and infuriating in equal measure. For those unclear on the difference, here's why these comparisons are unhelpful: 1. It's about visibility and access to powerful networks. Business is done according to who you know. Most holders of powerful positions are men, therefore being locked out of clubs like this limits women's ability to network with powerful people, exacerbating gender inequality. And No, Toby, the fact that women can occasionally visit the Garrick Club as a guest of a male member does not compensate for the other 364 days of the year where they aren't hobnobbing with the most powerful people in the country. Any setting where decisions are being made and networks are being formed should not exclude 50% of the population. 2. Women-only clubs are about gender equity. Historically men have held all the power in society - let's not forget women in the UK have held the right to vote for less than 100 years. I am part of a women-only club and clubs like this exist to help and support women navigate a system that wasn't designed for them. Such networks provide camaraderie, coaching, and professional development. This is called positive action and is a form of gender equity - helping the minoritised group (in this case women who still only account for 10% of FTSE100 CEO roles) to counterbalance historical inequities. It is not only lawful but widely encouraged by most countries around the world. 3. Women can't just start up their own Garrick Club. We wouldn't have the King, the Deputy Prime Minister, the head of MI6, the Civil Service or many of the other most coveted roles in the land, as they aren't held by women. Doh. (This point was beautifully made by Mary Ann Sieghart in her on point rebuttal against Toby Young on the Radio 4 segment - link in comments). 4. (It pains me to have to point out this last one....) Women-only spas, gyms, swimming pools and the like (as specifically referenced by Toby Young) aren't about being elitist or exclusive. They are about women's PHYSICAL SAFETY! REmember that over 90% of sexual assault victims are female. How can it be right in 2024 that women are still locked out of some of the most powerful institutions? All of this in the context of global progress on gender equality stagnating, whilst at the same time over half the population (53%) think gender equality has gone far enough (according to the recent Ipsos survey of 31 countries). Enough is enough. #GenderEquity"
