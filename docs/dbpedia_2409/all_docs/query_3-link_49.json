        "text": "Why Am I So Single?\n\nHave you ever sat on your bed wondering why you’re single when you’re actually really cool, funny, creative and smart? Why Am I So Single? at the Garrick Theatre is the musical for you! Get ready to laugh, cry, cringe and celebrate the power of BFFs at this new show, created by the team who brought you SIX. Written by Olivier Award winners Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, their story about two best friends who get together to bemoan their lack of love life is an all-singing, all-dancing tribute to the relationships that we sometimes forget to celebrate. It has its world premiere in the West End, not far away from the Vaudeville Theatre where Marlow and Moss’s runaway hit SIX has been reigning since 2021. This loud and proud extravaganza is perfect for fans of empowering pop musicals including & Juliet and homegrown British talent - and don’t worry, even if you’re happily coupled up, you’re still welcome to watch it."
