        "text": "3This tale of temples and monuments, idolatry and jubilation begins with a moment that I have usually considered simply as an act of cultural tourism, a sightseeing trip by three sisters visiting London from Bristol, their home town, but which I want here to see in the complex context of the creation of the Shakespeare religion, something I will want to redefine as a moment as much of anxiety as of celebration as well as a moment of religious incoherence and imprecision.\n\n4When she was 29, Hannah More, the brilliant young playwright, spent the winter season of 1773-4 in London with her two sisters, Sarah and Martha, the first of what would be annual trips to the capital for all of them. They were well connected, perhaps now one should say “networked”, with a letter of introduction to Sir Joshua Reynolds’ sister who introduced them to, among others, Dr Johnson. Among the trips they made from the flat they rented near Covent Garden, one was along the Thames to Hampton to see the villa, set in six acres, that David Garrick had bought in 1754 and which, for more than twenty years, would be altered, extended and decorated on the advice of the innovative architect and designer Robert Adam, pretty much unknown when Garrick first hired him. They had not yet met Garrick – that would not happen until the following year. Perhaps their connections made it possible to drop by as visitors but perhaps the house and grounds were already on the tourist trail. They had spent the day visiting Claremont, the Palladian house near Esher in Surrey, seat of the Duke of Newcastle designed by Vanbrugh, and went to Garrick’s villa on their way back to town.\n\n8For Hannah, there was no epiphany from the chair, no transformational moment from this equivalent of the wood of the true cross (and, given the astonishing number of objects supposedly created from this one mulberry tree, it did have the prodigious powers of cloning itself that the true cross seems also to have had). Garrick seems to have had no doubt about the provenance of his mulberry chair, even though in his play The Jubilee he has two competing vendors arguing about whose goods are made from the real tree:\n\n7 David Garrick, Plays, ed. Harry W. Pedicord and Frederick L. Bergmann, 7 vols., Carbondale, Ill., (...)\n\nDon’t buy of that fellow, your honor, he never had an inch of the Mulberry Tree in his life. His goods are made out of old chairs and stools and colored to cheat gentlefolks with. It was I, your honor, bought all the true Mulberry Tree.\n\nIn the absence of such a sacred moment as Hannah More hoped to have from sitting in the chair, her experience returned to the human, indeed the emphatically somatic:\n\n8 Stone and Kahrl, op. cit., p. 429.\n\nBut what drew, and deserved, my attention was a most noble statue of this most original man, in an attitude strikingly pensive – his limbs strongly muscular, his countenance strongly expressive of some vast conception, and his whole form seeming the bigger from some immense idea [with] which you suppose his great imagination pregnant.\n\n9The statue, which can be glimpsed through the door in Zoffany’s painting, had been commissioned by Garrick in 1757 from the sculptor Louis François Roubiliac at a cost, Hannah More noted, of “five hundred pounds” (other accounts suggested the price was only 300 guineas but that was still a huge sum). Garrick’s fame was established on his special bond with Shakespeare and his plays but the statue was marked by a more particular identification than a quasi-religious adoration. The adoration was of course mixed with gratitude for Shakespeare’s part in Garrick’s successful career and the wealth it had brought him, the (good) fortune that had enabled him to buy the Hampton villa, build the temple and commission the statue. Nonetheless, the statue was seen and probably intended as more than that mix of awe and thanks: a widespread contemporary rumour suggested that the statue was not only for Garrick but also of him, that Garrick was the model as well as the patron, that Garrick was here performing or becoming Shakespeare, an assumption magnified for us by two strikingly similar paintings of Roubiliac working on the maquettes of two statues, one of Shakespeare (painted by Adrien Carpentiers) and one of Garrick (painting by Andrea Soldi). Roubiliac’s pose is virtually identical in each, only the subject has changed – if it really has: in effect, Roubiliac sculpted Garrick twice.\n\n10I mentioned Walpole’s description of the temple as a sign of Garrick’s being “grateful” to Shakespeare. Walpole, indeed, wrote for Garrick a motto to ornament the building: “Quod spiro et placeo, si placeo tuum est”. In a letter, Walpole offered a translation:\n\nThat I spirit have, and nature,\n\nThat sense breathes in every feature,\n\nThat I please, if please I do,\n\nShakespear, all I owe to you.\n\n11 Quoted by Michael Dobson, The Making of the National Poet, Oxford, The Clarendon Press, 1992, p. 1 (...)\n\nUnnotic’d long thy Shakespear lay,\n\nTo dullness and to time a prey;\n\nBut lo! I rise, I breathe, I live\n\nIn you, my representative!\n\n12The appropriation of Juliet’s line to Romeo to describe Garrick’s reverence towards Shakespeare would reappear near the opening of Garrick’s “Ode” at the Stratford Jubilee. In response to the question\n\nTo what blest genius of the isle,\n\nShall Gratitude her tribute pay,\n\nDecree the festive day,\n\nErect the statue, and devote the pile?\n\ncomes the answer:\n\n12 David Garrick, The Poetical Works, 2 vols., London, George Kearsley, 1785, 1:57.\n\n’Tis he! ’tis he! – that demi-god!\n\n… ’Tis he! ’tis he!\n\n“The god of our idolatry!”\n\n14 Reprinted in Anti-Midas (1769), p. 23.\n\nHad the Author been a little more conversant with the Pagan Mythology, he would have known that the title a Demi-God was never conferred but on Heroes. This is the first time it was ever applied to a Poet.\n\nBut that shift from “demi-god” to “god” was even more troubling:\n\n15 Ibid., p. 23-4.\n\nBut, he [Garrick] seems to think, that even the rank of a Half-God was far too low for Shakespeare; and therefore, in a few lines after, he makes him a whole god…Well said Christian! But it is no wonder he should endeavor to make a God of Shakespear, since he has usurped the office of his High-priest; and has already gained money enough by it, to make a golden calf, to be an object of that idolatry which he recommends… This extravagant expression, which is pardonable from the mouth of a young girl distracted with love, and applied to her lover, he uses as his own serious sentiment, and that of all the good People of this Realm, with regard to Shakespear.\n\n14Eventually, inevitably, the transition from Shakespeare to Garrick would occur: in his long poem The Task (published in 1785), a work which capaciously manages to include almost anything, William Cowper found space to turn the god of our idolatry into Garrick, not Shakespeare:\n\n16 Cowper, The Task, Bk 6, in William Cowper, The Poetical Works, ed. H.S. Milford, 4th ed., London, (...)\n\n…Garrick’s mem’ry next,\n\nWhen time hath somewhat mellow’d it, and made\n\nThe idol of our worship while he liv’d\n\nThe god of our idolatry once more,\n\nShall have its altar; and the world shall go\n\nIn pilgrimage to bow before his shrine.\n\n16If Stowe’s temple is, in some senses, a sacred spot it is an unusual one. Technically a roofless exedra, it is a temple without an interior, an open, public space, not one that defines its meaning by analogy to classical temples or churches. It is strikingly unlike any of the other temples at Stowe, for example, the Temple of Concord and Victory or the Gothic Temple. Its form desacralizes its meaning, turning its parade of worthies into something less than sacred, more heroic. One would not here expect to find that “ray of inspiration,” that semi-divine spark of genius that Hannah More hoped to find from the mulberry chair in Garrick’s temple. The bust of Shakespeare at Stowe has no signs of the heroic body that she saw in the “strongly muscular” limbs of Roubiliac’s statue. As patriotic project, Stowe is not about the supra-human nor about the bodily presence, that which lies below the head and shoulders of the bust, that which so overexcited Hannah More.\n\n17But the supra-human, semi-divine Shakespeare has a long history, reaching its apogee long after Garrick’s or Hannah More’s conceptions of it in Sir Sidney Lee’s proposal for a change in the nation’s saint. In 1900, in a lecture to the Royal Institution of Great Britain on “Shakespeare and true Patriotism,” Lee began by comparing Shakespeare and St George as candidates for England’s patron saint:\n\n19 Quoted by Peter Holland, “Shakespeare and the DNB” in J.R. Mulryne and T. Kozuka, eds., Shakespear (...)\n\nIf at the beginning of a new century a patron saint was chosen anew, and the choice lay between a mythical native of Cappadocia and Shakespeare, the native of Stratford-on-Avon, the straitest of cosmopolitan intellects among us could hardly defy the sentiment that gave the preference to the Englishman.\n\nThe complete absence in Shakespeare’s biography or afterlife of any of the prime requirements for sainthood, such as the performance of miracles through the saint’s intercession, seems never to have crossed Lee’s mind.\n\n19In 1662 William Winstanley began the long series of almanacs he published as “Poor Robin”, and Falstaff turned up frequently as one of the saints in the double calendar, one liturgical, one parodic, he listed month by month. In Poor Robin for 1668, for instance, he is on 11th January, in 1675 31st January, in 1676 11th January and 1677 25th January. There is an exuberant energy in Winstanley’s lists of parodic saints; as Frank Palmeri comments, in a fine article on the parody almanacs,\n\n22 Frank Palmeri, “History, Nation, and the Satiric Almanac, 1660-1760”, Criticism 40 (1998), 377-408 (...)\n\nPoor Robin’s list draws its parodic saints from such widely disparate realms as picaresque and satiric literature, Greek history, English folklore, Italian literature, imperial Roman history, chivalric romance, criminal history, British political history, Shakespearean and other British drama, Elizabethan fiction, French fables, European mythology, the history of Catholicism and Anabaptism.\n\nWinstanley, who, not surprisingly, was running out of inspiration the longer the series continued, quoted the winter part of the final song in Love’s Labour’s Lost for a number of wintry months (for example, Poor Robin for 1670 and 1679),\n\nWhen icicles hang by the wall,\n\nAnd Dick the shepherd blows his nail,\n\nAnd Tom bears logs into the hall,\n\nAnd milk comes frozen home in pail… (LLL, 5.2.897-900)\n\n21But, even as Cobham was having his temple built, there were already signs of the campaign to have Shakespeare appropriately memorialised in marmoreal form in Westminster Abbey, a movement that gathered force once a bust of Milton had been placed there in 1737. The author of an early elegy on Shakespeare, William Basse, had argued that Shakespeare should be placed beside Chaucer, Spenser and Beaumont in the Abbey, making of their tomb a bed for four, adequate till Doomsday since “hardly will a fifth / Betwixt this day and that by Fate be slain”. It may be for Basse “a sacred sepulchre” but we are a long way here from Shakespeare as saint, however ironically. Basse’s proposal was, of course, one that Ben Jonson strongly resisted, proclaiming, in his elegy on Shakespeare printed in the First Folio, that Shakespeare did not need such a memorial: “Thou art a Moniment, without a tombe, / And art alive still while thy Booke doth live”.\n\n29 Quoted by Vanessa Cunningham, Shakespeare and Garrick, Cambridge, CUP, 2008, p. 8.\n\nTho’ sunk in death the forms the Poet drew,\n\nThe Actor’s genius bade them breathe anew.\n\nTho’, like the Bard himself, in night they lay,\n\nImmortal Garrick call’d them back to day.\n\n24Visit Garrick’s Shakespeare temple now to admire its 1990s restoration and you will not find the Roubiliac statue, only a reproduction of it. In his will, as the symbolically-placed second item, after the disposition of the Hampton estate, Garrick left the statue to the British Museum where it stood in the King’s Library until the opening of the new British Library where, instead, it stands at the foot of the library’s main staircase. Garrick plainly wished to have it seen as occupying a different kind of space from the temple; no longer part of religious fervour but instead as part of the national collection of the genius of the country that the new museum and its central feature, the library, were intended to symbolize. In many ways, Garrick’s Shakespeare religion was always a matter of celebrating the genius of the nation. One might worship at the Shakespeare temple or by reading in the British Museum or by going to the theatre or even by going on pilgrimage to the birthplace of the saint. That this is various and not exactly thought through is only appropriate: Garrick is an actor-manager, not a theologian, and his aim was always a Shakespeare cult, rather than a church. The transpositions of location for the act of faith is therefore characteristic and, for Garrick, probably desirable.\n\n25Even before the Shakespeare temple was built at Hampton, Garrick had redefined where the sacred space of Shakespeare should be, no longer in Westminster Abbey nor in Holy Trinity church in Stratford-upon-Avon. In his prologue for the new season in 1750, Garrick defined the Shakespeare religion as belonging in the theatre itself: “Sacred to Shakespeare was this spot design’d, / To pierce the heart, and humanize the mind.”\n\n26But, as Garrick well knew, especially given his responsibilities as manager, it all depends on the audience’s taste – even a sacred spot can remain empty:\n\n30 Vickers, op. cit., 3:365-6.\n\nBut if an empty House, the Actor’s curse,\n\nShews us our Lears and Hamlets lose their force:\n\nUnwilling we must change the nobler scene,\n\nAnd in our turn present you Harlequin.\n\n27But, by 1769, Garrick had allowed the sacred spot to shift again, this time to Stratford-upon-Avon in the event that would be explicitly established as a religious one in its very title, the Jubilee. Garrick set out to privilege the birthplace over the rival attractions in Stratford:\n\n32 Quoted in Jonathan Bate, Shakespearean Constitutions: Politics, Theatre, Criticism, 1730-1830, Oxf (...)\n\nThe Gothic glories of the ancient Church, the modern elegance of the Civic Hall, cease to be regarded, when it is remembered that the humble shed, in which the immortal bard first drew that breath which gladdened all the isle, is still existing; and all who have a heart to feel, and a mind to admire the truth of nature and splendour of genius, will rush thither to behold it, as a pilgrim would to the shrine of some loved saint; will deem it holy ground.\n\n37 David Garrick, The Poetical Works, 2:431.\n\nBehold this fair goblet, ’twas carv’d from the tree,\n\nWhich, O my sweet Shakespeare, was planted by thee;\n\nAs a relick I kiss it, and bow at the shrine,\n\nWhat comes from thy hand must be ever divine!\n\nAll shall yield to the mulberry-tree,\n\nBend to thee,\n\nBlest Mulberry,\n\nMatchless was he\n\nWho planted thee,\n\nAnd thou like him immortal shall be!\n\n31To document something of the scale of the response to the events in Stratford I need first to offer a short table of the Jubilee plays and prologues for London and a few of the associated pamphlets published in the capital:\n\n39 Deelman, op. cit.,p. 272.\n\nBarely a week after the Jubilee had begun, on 13th September, Samuel Foote added a speech for the Devil in his play The Devil upon Two Sticks that offered a definition of a Jubilee as “a public invitation…to celebrate a great poet whose works have made him immortal by an ode without poetry, music without melody, dinners without victuals and lodgings without beds”.\n\nGeorge Colman’s prologue, “Scrub’s Trip to the Jubilee”, was performed by Weston at Covent Garden on September 19th.\n\nFrancis Gentleman’s play, The Stratford Jubilee, was intended for Samuel Foote’s company at the Haymarket but never performed. It was published, with Colman’s prologue, on the same day.\n\nGarrick’s Vagary, an anonymous satire in dialogue-form, was advertised on 22nd September.\n\nGarrick performed the Ode on stage at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 30th September and repeated it on a few days thereafter.\n\nFoote announced that his theatre would perform a Burlesque Jubilee Ode with a parody of the Drury Lane procession of characters, dressed in rags, but was eventually dissuaded from doing so. Drugger’s Jubilee, a reference to Garrick’s role in Jonson’s The Alchemist, was still being anticipated in May 1770.\n\nGeorge Colman’s play Man and Wife, hastily rewritten to include satire on the Jubilee and including a pageant of Shakespeare’s characters, was first performed at Covent Garden on 7th October 1769.\n\nGarrick’s The Jubilee followed at Drury Lane on 14th October.\n\nAnti-Midas, a pamphlet defence of Garrick’s Ode, was probably published in November.\n\nEdward Thompson’s poem, Trinculo’s Trip to the Jubilee, also appeared in November.\n\nHenry Woodward’s pantomime, Harlequin’s Jubilee, opened at Covent Garden in January 1770.\n\nAnd Peter Barnes’ play Jubilee was first performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company in the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, in July 2001.\n\nwhy celebrate Shakespeare?...While you celebrate him, the real world is being forgotten for a verb or a noun…What does Shakespeare know of the terror of my life…? Don’t cry over his verse, cry over my life. …Celebrate me! Celebrate me! (op. cit., p. 43).\n\nI heard Yesterday to my Surprize, that the Country People did not seem to relish our Jubilee, that they look’d upon it to be popish & that we shd raise ye Devil, & wt not – I suppose this may be a joke, - but after all my trouble, pains labor & Expence for their Service & ye honor of ye County, I shall think it very hard, if I am not receiv’d kindly by them – how ever I shall not be the first Martyr for my Zeal.\n\n37At its most extreme, the comparison between a celebration of the national poet and the threat of a foreign and subversive religion was carefully and anxiously pursued in the pamphlet-dialogue Garrick’s Vagary. The author spends page after page charting the similarities between the events of the Stratford jubilee and the precise rituals of the jubilee at Rome, so that, for instance,\n\nholding a golden Hammer in his Hand, that is, the Ticket, which cost him a Guinea, he knocks at the Gate three Times, from a natural Impatience to get in, and have a good Seat, repeating these Words, Aperite mihi Portas justitiae, &c. Open the Door, for I have a just Right to in and hear the Praise of Shakespeare.\n\nOr for the moment when the Pope takes up the cross and enters St Peter’s,\n\n54 Garrick’s Vagary (1769), p. 16, 19.\n\nHere we are to substitute our Roscius, entering the Booth at Stratford, followed by all his theatrical Tribe, of various Denominations; and then, taking up not the Cross, but the Ode, he begins to read…’\n\n38Garrick’s Vagary opens with an attack on everyone in London,\n\n56 Garrick’s Vagary, p. 3-4.\n\nrunning out of Town, pell-mell, after a Brat of Judaism, a since foster-Child of Popery, now, forsooth, revived by an Actor, to the very imminent and most alarming Danger both of Church and State – As a good Englishman, and a true Protestant, I feel much Concern, am patriotically hurt,…at so papistical a Manœuvre,…I wonder how our Bishops can remain quiet on so critical an Innovation…\n\n39It is no surprise, then, that the Stratford Jubilee would lead to a proposal of yet another quasi-religious structure, another Shakespeare temple, not this time in the gardens of an actor who wished to appear a gentleman but as a public structure to celebrate the glory of the nation. Paul Hiffernan, like Francis Gentleman a Dubliner, was another playwright, poet, critic, hack, eking out a living in London. Helped by Garrick’s drumming up subscriptions, Hiffernan published in 1770 his study of Dramatic Genius, the first book of which sets out his “Plan of a permanent Temple, to be erected to the memory of Shakespeare, in a Classical Taste; with Inscriptions and Decorations, suitable to the Objects chosen” (p. v). The inscriptions were to be in Latin and English, “the one for the sake of learned Foreigners unacquainted with our Language, and by whom we are now visited in greater numbers than usual heretofore” (p. 3-4), a sign of Shakespeare’s potential interest for the developing tourist trade. Whatever the Jubilee might have done for Stratford and whatever Garrick may have done at his villa in Hampton, Hiffernan wanted to see extended to the proper kind of shrine to the poet and his actor, with scenes from tragedies and comedies but, intriguingly, without Othello because “the blacking screens, and renders incommunicable to spectators, all impassioned working of the countenance” (p. 6).\n\n40The exterior inscription, in Hiffernan’s own awkward translation of his awkward Latin, was to read:\n\nNor gay Thalia’s comic Fane stands here,\n\nNor solemn Temple of the tragic Muse;\n\nBut Shakespeare’s Shrine, they emulous have raised! (p. 23)\n\nWhen entered into the Temple, the first object for the curious spectator’s attention, is the great Poet; over whom is to be a sun, rising in all its glory, after having dissipated from our British Theatre, the long incumbent clouds of Gothic ignorance and barbarism, that are to be seen flying from the victorious lustre… (p. 16)\n\nBut, if that suggests the sun behind Shakespeare, the inscription shows that Shakespeare himself is the source of the light and power: “Darkness’ dark shades fly Shakespeare’s solar Beams” (p. 16).\n\n41Shakespeare is the blessed sun, an Apollonian transfiguration; the saint in whose honour the temple is created as a “shrine”, Hiffernan’s word, has become fully divine, the energy for the world or more especially nation. Not a place for Shakespeare’s relics like Garrick’s collection in his temple, mulberry chair and all, but a place of pilgrimage to see the classical divine and the beatified Christian united against foreign darkness. No wonder Hiffernan wanted the foreign tourists to understand the message. No wonder this supremely hyperbolic architectural vision was never built. Shakespeare commemoration may often be grand or even grandiose but nothing out-tops Hiffernan’s fantasy.\n\n43Lichtenberg was no more likely than Garrick to unpack the complex and conflicting notions of faith and adoration sitting within that short word “holy”. As usual, the imprecision is central to the possibility of turning fame into sainthood."
