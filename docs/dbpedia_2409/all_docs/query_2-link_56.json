R. Smith, Sottile, Southard, Spires, Stavrinakis, Stringer, Tallon, Taylor, Thayer, Toole, Tribble, Vick, Viers, Weeks, Whipper, White, Whitmire, Williams, Willis and Young: A HOUSE RESOLUTION TO NAME CRAVEN CHRISTIAN HOPPER OF MYRTLE BEACH AS 2012 SOUTH CAROLINA CONGENITAL HEART DEFECT AMBASSADOR AND TO DECLARE FEBRUARY 14, 2012, AS CONGENITAL HEART DEFECT AWARENESS DAY IN SOUTH CAROLINA.\n\nWhereas, each year, the American people recognize February as Heart Month and February 14, 2012, as Congenital Heart Defect (CHD) Awareness Day in the United States; and\n\nWhereas, congenital heart defects are the number-one birth defect worldwide and the number-one cause of birth-defect-related deaths worldwide. About one out of every one hundred babies are born each year with some type of CHD in the United States, approximately forty thousand a year; and\n\nWhereas, in addition, nearly twice as many American children die from CHDs each year as from all forms of childhood cancers combined, yet funding for pediatric-cancer research is five times higher than funding for CHDs. Although research is ongoing, at least thirty-five CHDs have been identified, some of which are diagnosed during gestation or at birth, others of which are not detected until days, weeks, months, or even years after; and\n\nWhereas, critically, it is a proven fact that the earlier a CHD is detected and treated, the likelier it is that an affected child will survive and have fewer long-term health complications; and\n\nWhereas, in light of the emphasis on CHDs during the month of February, the House of Representatives wishes to highlight to the citizens of South Carolina the fine work of medical professionals who seek to help families dealing with heart defects, as well as the courageous manner in which affected families rise above this medical challenge; and\n\nWhereas, to that end, the House, recognizing the need for a champion representative for these important causes, wishes to name Craven Christian Hopper of Myrtle Beach as 2012 South Carolina Congenital Heart Defect Ambassador; and\n\nWhereas, born on May 9, 2005, at Conway Medical Center, Craven Christian Hopper appeared to be a perfectly healthy baby boy. Soon, however, a nurse expressed concern about Craven's coloring and recommended a few tests to make sure all was well. After Craven's pediatrician and various specialists at the Medical University of South Carolina had looked into his case, they determined he suffered from hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), which meant the left side of his heart had not developed as it should. Surgeries would be required over the next few years to enable his heart to function at the highest level of which it was capable. Due to the expertise of Craven's medical team and the care of his family, Craven has now had all necessary surgeries and is progressing well. His parents are able to enjoy watching Craven grow into a wonderful little boy with a big personality. They gratefully testify that Craven \"makes us stop and realize what is truly important in life. [We] thank God for every moment of every day we have with Craven and our other children\"; and\n\nWhereas, to further underscore the importance of these matters, the House of Representatives wishes to declare February 14, 2012, as Congenital Heart Defect (CHD) Awareness Day in South Carolina. Now, therefore,\n\nBe it resolved by the House of Representatives:\n\nThat the members of the South Carolina House of Representatives, by this resolution, name Craven Christian Hopper of Myrtle Beach as 2012 South Carolina Congenital Heart Defect Ambassador and declare February 14, 2012, as Congenital Heart Defect Awareness Day in South Carolina.\n\nBe it further resolved that copies of this resolution be provided to Craven Hopper and the South Carolina branches of the American Heart Association.\n\nThe Resolution was adopted.\n\nHOUSE RESOLUTION\n\nThe following was introduced:\n\nH. 4720 (Word version) -- Reps.
