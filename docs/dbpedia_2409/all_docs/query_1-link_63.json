Adapted by Joel Horwood and directed by Katy Rudd, The Ocean at the End of the Lane takes audiences on an epic journey to a childhood once forgotten.\n\nReturning to his childhood home, a man finds himself standing beside the pond of the old Sussex farmhouse where he used to play. Heâs transported to his 12th birthday when his friend Lettie claimed it wasnât a pond, but an oceanâ¦ Plunged into a magical world, their survival depends on their ability to reckon with ancient forces that threaten to destroy everything around them."
