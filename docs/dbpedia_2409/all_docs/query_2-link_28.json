        "text": "Volume 65, No. 2 - Spring 2023\n\nManaging Editor: Malcolm B. Yarnell III\n\nThis year marks the 40th anniversary of the genesis of the formal debate over whether Southern Baptists may also be described as \"evangelicals.\" The executive editor and managing editor have both written on this subject, but we have set aside our own statements to return attention to the original question and to evaluate the answer we believe James Leo Garrett Jr. crafted and argued so well.\n\nDownload Journal\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEditorial - David S.

Dockery\n\nThe Fall 2021 issue of the Southwestern Journal of Theology is devoted to “The Use of the Old Testament in the New.”\n\nThis important theme has implications for how we understand both testaments. Should we consider the Old Testament to be Christian Scripture, or should we reserve this designation for the New Testament? What do the ways that the New Testament writers use the Old Testament tell us about translation and interpretation practices? Do answers to these questions help us develop a doctrine of Scripture and understanding for biblical interpretation in the twenty-first century? The contributors to this issue wrestle with these and other questions, which are not new, but which need to be revisited by each generation.\n\nDownload Journal\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEditorial – David S.

Dockery\n\nThe articles found in this issue of the Southwestern Journal of Theology are authored around the theme of “The Doctrine of Humankind.”\n\n“What does it mean to be human?” This question was asked nearly two decades ago at a major bioethics conference by Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary alumnus C. Ben Mitchell. The way he framed the conversation was profound. Realizing the importance of this question and the various implications for our lives and ministries, we have invited a group of thoughtful theologians and ethicists to help us think carefully and wisely about these challenging issues.\n\nDownload Journal\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEditorial – David S.

Dockery\n\nThe articles found in this issue of the Southwestern Journal of Theology are built around the theme of “Theology Applied.”\n\n“Theology Applied” calls for us to be hearers of God’s Word, students of God’s Word, followers of God’s Word, as well as doers and practitioners of God’s Word. The contributors to this issue have provided a harmonious chorus to help us begin to connect the dots between thinking about God and our worship of and service to God. In doing so, we recognize that theology is not an individualistic cerebral experience. We contend that theology matters to the church. Moreover, theology serves as the foundation for the life of the church and for the Christian witness to and for the world.\n\nDownload Journal\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEditorial – David S.

Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary annually hosts an Expository Preaching Workshop that addresses the major concerns of text-driven preaching. In the Spring of 2015 that workshop focused in on the book of Jude. The articles in this issue are adaptations of those presentations. They are helpful to students of the Bible and especially to preachers. Those who are preparing to preach part, or all, of Jude will find these articles of great worth. From making decisions on how to approach the book to tackling some of its difficult statements, the articles address the major concerns a preacher faces when tackling Jude. Also, they present important facets of preaching that can be applied universally to most texts of the Bible. For those who are new to preaching or those that have been preaching for quite awhile these articles are beneficial for the craft of preaching.\n\nDownload Journal\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEditorial – W.

It can be of tremendous assistance to us in the present day. For example, history helps us to understand and gain perspective on our current situation and thinking. It can answer questions like: “How did we get to where we are now?” “Where did that idea or line of thought originate?” “From what tradition did that opinion stem?” In other words, history provides us with fresh insights from past knowledge as we evaluate and make sense of our present. History also helps us learn not to repeat the mistakes of the past and enables us to see how people long ago met challenges and dealt with the crises, problems, and obstacles that came their way. History is especially valuable when studying theology because it gives us a look at the specific contexts in which theologies were created, developed, and defined. This describes historical theology.\n\nDownload Journal\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEditorial – Terry L. Wilder\n\nEarly English Baptists’ View of the Lord’s Supper– W.

The growth in mission was represented in the evangelistic aspirations expressed in the Bold Mission Thrust adopted by the convention. The excitment over theology was recaptiulated in the report of the Peace Committee led by Charles G. Fuller and adopted by the convention. This issue of the Southwestern Journal of Theology (SWJT) focuses on that second aspect of Southern Baptist life in the latter half of the twentieth century, our theology.\n\nDownload Journal\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEditorial – Malcolm B.

Yarnell III\n\nThe desire of believers to display real faith through appropriate action is rooted in the witness of Scripture and exemplified in Christian history. Jesus Christ asked this haunting question of those who wished to identify themselves as His disciples: “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?” The Lord proceeded to illustrate the difference between two types of disciples with an architectural metaphor. One disciple comes to Christ, hears His words, “and acts on them.” This one is praised as having penetrated to “the rock” and built his house upon Him. This one is an authentic disciple, manifesting his beliefs in action. The second type, however, hears the Lord’s words, “and has not acted accordingly.” The second disciple is not founded upon the rock, so that when judgment comes, “the ruin of that house was great.” The second disciple is a hypocrite, a person whose actions do not match his claims. These are the two disparate options present to those who hear Christ: authentic discipleship or hypocrisy.\n\nDownload Journal\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEditorial – Malcolm B.

Yarnell III\n\nChristianity wages warfare against two opposing worldviews: mysticism, which would dismiss reason entirely, and scientism, which would exalt reason unduly. Both are manifested in contemporary culture. For many in our age, modern science seems to be dissolving before the acidic onslaught of a mystical postmodernism. Even more recently, a resurgent militant atheism has attacked any form of theism as incompatible with enlightened rationality. As an historical and intellectual yet spiritual and simple faith, Christianity takes firm stands against both the mystical and the scientistic errors. On the one hand, our faith depends upon the eyewitness of the apostles, who literally saw the God-man die and were then amazingly transformed by Jesus’ bodily resurrection. On the other hand, our faith is based on a hope that we ourselves may neither see nor measure in the same way that a geometrician calculates the hypotenuse of a triangle or a physicist measures the speed of light. Christianity does not fit within the modernist or the postmodernist worldviews, because it sublimely integrates historical objectivity with spiritual fideism.\n\nDownload Journal\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEditorial – Malcolm B.

Afterwards, Mark Leeds, our Registrar, presents a compelling essay in defense of why reading must be considered a virtue for the Christian. The remainder of the issue is composed of book reviews from various professors, pastors, and advanced theological students. Our Editorial hope in bringing these reviews from experts within the various theological disciplines into one issue is that their constructively critical, keen, and appreciative minds will inform your own reading practices. The reviews have been arranged by subject area, typically alphabetically but canonically within the field of biblical studies and chronologically within the field of historical studies.\n\nDownload Journal\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEditorial – Malcolm B.
