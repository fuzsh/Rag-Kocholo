        "text": "Lake Forest College complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), as amended, by publishing an annual notice to eligible students in attendance explaining their rights under FERPA with respect to their educational records (An “eligible student” under FERPA is a student who is 18 years of age or older or who attends a postsecondary institution at any age), including:\n\nThe right to inspect and review education records within 45 days from the day Lake Forest College receives a request for access.\n\nA student may inspect and review the student’s educational records by submitting to the Office of the Registrar at registrar@lakeforest.edu, a written request that identifies the record(s) that student wishes to inspect. The school official will make a plan for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected within 45 days from receiving the request. If the records are not maintained by the school official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. If the records contain information on more than one student, the requesting student may inspect, review, or be informed of only the specific information about his or her records. Student’s educational records are maintained under the supervision of the Registrar and Associate Dean of Students.\n\nThe right to request the amendment of education records that the student believes is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights under FERPA.\n\nA student who wishes to ask Lake Forest College to amend a record he or she believes to contain inaccurate or misleading information should submit a written request to the Office of the Registrar at registrar@lakeforest.edu, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants to be changed and specify why it should be changed with any supporting documentation to the request.\n\nThe school official will issue a decision within reasonable period of time whether to amend as requested. If the decision is unfavorable, the student has the right to a hearing before the Academic Appeals Board (for academic records) or Dean of Students (for conduct records).\n\nIn the event of an unfavorable decision by the Academic Appeals Board and/or Dean of Students, the student has the right to insert a written statement in the record setting forth his or her reasons for disagreeing with the decision.\n\nThe right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information (PII) in education records, with certain exceptions that FERPA authorizes to disclosure without prior written consent.\n\nLake forest college will not release personally identifiable information in education records or allow access to those records without prior consent of the student, other than information considered\n\n“Directory Information.” Unless disclosure is to the student himself or herself, the consent must be written, signed and dated, and must specify the records to be disclosed, state purpose of disclosure and identify the recipient to who disclosure may be made. A student wishing to restrict the release of directory information may do so by completing and submitting the Request to Restrict FERPA Directory Information. A student must formally rescind a restriction of directory information by submitting a subsequent directory information restrictions form.\n\nThe request to restrict the release of directory information does not prevent the disclosure of information to college personnel with a legitimate education interest. FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. Lake Forest College defines school official as a person employed by the college in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position, including student employees, public safety and health care personnel; a person or company with whom the college has contracted who performs an institutional service or function to assist another school official in performing his or her professional responsibilities and who is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of education records.; a person serving on the Board of Trustees or a student serving on an official committee. School officials may only access and use education records as necessary to conduct official college business or for which they have legitimate educational interest.\n\nThe college may disclose, without consent, the education record information to parents of a student who is a dependent for income tax purposes (dependency must be documented). In general, the college will share information related to the student’s academic performance, progress toward graduation, any indebtedness, and involvement in matters that may lead to suspension or dismissal.\n\nThe right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Lake Forest College to comply with the requirements of FERPA.\n\nFile a Complaint\n\nU.S. Department of Education\n\nStudent Privacy Policy Office\n\n400 Maryland Ave, SW\n\nWashington, DC 20202-8520\n\nFERPA Complaint Form\n\nStudent. An individual who is, or has been, in attendance at Lake Forest College. A student definition also includes an individual whom the institution maintains education records (alumni/former students).\n\nIn Attendance. Lake Forest College defines attendance as being officially registered for a course and the course has begun. A student in attendance can be participating in any official, organized campus activity (e.g. orientation, athletic practice, class, etc.)\n\nEducation Records. Education records include those records that are personally identifiable, and which are maintained by the college or a school official. Records could be information or data recorded in any medium, including but not limited to photos, handwriting, print, video or audio tape, computer media, film, microfilm, and microfiche.\n\nExceptions to “education records” include -\n\nNotes about students made by professors and administrators for their own use and not shown to others “Sole possession notes”. Also, notes composed in conjunction with a student or in the physical presence of a student are not considered sole possession notes. Once these notes are disclosed to another party (or placed in a physical or electronic location where another party could view them) they cease to qualify as sole possession notes and become a part of the student’s educational record.\n\nLaw Records created and maintained by a law enforcement unit for a law enforcement purpose.\n\nEmployment records, except where a currently enrolled student is employed as a result of his or her status as a student (i.e. work-study).\n\nMedical records made and maintained during treatment and disclosed only to persons providing treatment.\n\nRecords that only contain information about a student after he or she is no longer a student at the college (e.g., alumni records).\n\nApplication for admissions records to Lake Forest College or program in which the student is not currently in attendance.\n\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII). Data or information that contains the student’s name; the name of student's parent or other family member's; the address of the student, parent, or family member; a personal identifier, such as the social security number or student ID number; biometric record; other information or in combination that would make the student's identity easily traceable.\n\nDirectory Information. Directory information is Information not generally considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Lake Forest College has the discretion to designate a student’s record information as directory information and disclose this information without student consent. Directory information cannot be confirmed using SSN.\n\nThe following categories of information have been designated directory information at Lake Forest College:\n\nName(s)\n\nAddresses (local/campus and home/permanent)\n\nTelephone listing(s) (local/campus, home/permanent, and mobile)\n\nEmail addresses (institutional and personal)\n\nMajor and minor field(s) of study\n\nEnrollment status (full/part time/ withdrawn/undergraduate/graduate)\n\nDates of attendance\n\nDate and place of birth\n\nPhotograph(s) and video footage\n\nGraduation and Degrees received (degree and conferral date)\n\nHonors and awards received (e.g., Dean’s List)\n\nawards received (degree information/ Dean’s List recognition)\n\nParticipation in officially recognized activities and sports\n\nWeight and height of members of athletic teams\n\nMost recent previous educational institution attended\n\nLake Forest College records, both visually and audibly, many campus events and daily activities such as classes, commencement, student events and other public occasions. These images, as well as other information about students, are published (e.g., print media, Lake Forest College website) regularly as part of the coverage of college life to a variety of audiences.\n\nIt is Lake Forest College’s practice not to provide student’s education record information to anyone, including parents, relatives and friends.

Directory information may appear in public documents and may otherwise be disclosed without student consent unless the student informs the college that he/she wishes to suppress the information from being disclosed.\n\nStudents may restrict the release of their directory information by completing and submitting the Request to Restrict FERPA Directory Information. The request for non-disclosure remains in effect until the student rescinds the request. A student must formally rescind a restriction of directory information by submitting a subsequent directory information restrictions form. The student should weigh the implication of placing the restriction request. By withholding the release of “Directory Information” Lake Forest College will refuse to release any information about the student to any non-institutional persons or organizations. A request in place at the time of graduation or at the time of leaving Lake Forest College remains in effect in perpetuity.\n\nRegardless of the effect on the student, Lake Forest College assumes no liability for honoring a student’s instructions that such information be withheld. In addition, the college assumes no liability for information disclosed by student or other groups associated with, but not under the direct auspices of Lake Forest College. Students must take additional measures to inform fellow students and student groups of their wish for their information to remain not listed as printed or online.\n\nDisclosure. Permitting of access or the release, transfer, or other communication of education records orally or in writing, or by electronic means, or by any other means to any party except the party identified as the party that provided or created the record.\n\nSchool Official.

School officials may only access and use education records as necessary to conduct official college business or for which they have legitimate educational interest.\n\nLegitimate Educational Interest.

The school official exception can include contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other third parties to whom the college has outsourced services or functions under certain circumstances: 1) Performs an institutional service or function for which the college would otherwise use employees; 2) The party is under the direct control of the college; 2) The party is subject to the same conditions governing the use and redisclosure of education records applicable to other school officials; 3) Meets the criteria specified in Lake Forest College annual notification of FERPA rights for being a school official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records.\n\nFERPA exceptions which relate to prior consent not required to disclose information are:\n\nTo school officials with legitimate educational interests (defined in annual notification)\n\nTo schools in which a student seeks or intends to enroll\n\nTo Federal, State, and local educational authorities conducting an audit, evaluation, or enforcement of education programs\n\nIn connection with financial aid\n\nTo organizations conducting studies on behalf of educational institutions\n\nTo accrediting organizations\n\nTo parents of a dependent student\n\nTo comply with a judicial order or subpoena (reasonable effort to notify)\n\nIn a health or safety emergency\n\nDirectory information\n\nTo the student\n\nResults of a disciplinary hearing to an alleged victim of a crime of violence\n\nFinal results of a disciplinary hearing concerning a student who is an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence and who is found to have committed a violation of the institution’s rules or policies\n\nDisclosure to parent of student under 21 if the institution determines that the student has committed a violation of its drug or alcohol rules or policies\n\nDisclosure of information received under a community notification program concerning a student who is required to register as a sex offender in the State\n\nIdentification and authentication of identity.
