        "text": "Is this a dagger, which I see before me,\n\nThe handle toward my hand?\n\n(Macbeth, II.i.33-34)\n\nDavid Garrick (1717-79) delivered Macbeth’s famous soliloquy 37 times on the London stage between 1744 and 1768. Thomas Wilkes, in A General View of the Stage (1759), attempted to describe the manner of Garrick’s performance, specifically his unrivaled ability to capture and communicate Macbeth’s psychological turmoil:\n\nThere is not any character in Tragedy so seldom hit off by the Actor as Macbeth, perhaps there are few more difficult; and in the hands of Garrick it acquires an inconceivable ease. It is curious to observe in him the progress of guilt from the intention to the act. How his ambition kindles at the distant prospect of the crown, when the witches prophecy! and with what reluctance he yields, upon the diabolical persuasions of his wife, to the perpetration of the murder! How finely does he shew his resolution staggered, upon the supposed view of the air-drawn dagger, until he is rouzed to action by the signal, viz. the ringing of the closet bell.\n\nDuring a visit to Italy in 1764, Garrick was persuaded by the Duke of Parma to give a private performance of Macbeth’s soliloquy before the elite company of the Duke of York, Lord Spencer and Guillaume-Leon Dutillot, Marquis de Felino. Writing to friend back in England, Garrick observed that the Duke ‘speaks English very well and understands it better—He had read Shakespear, and was very desirous to hear our manner of speaking’. Ever susceptible to flattery, particularly from an aristocratic source, Garrick duly obliged. Thomas Davies, an actor turned bookseller, and Garrick’s first biographer, imagined the scene in his Memoirs of the Life of David Garrick, Esq. (1780):\n\nMr. Garrick immediately recited a soliloquy of Macbeth, which is spoken during the instant of time when a dagger is presented to the disturbed imagination of a man ready to perpetrate a horrid murder. His ardent look, expressive tones, and impassioned action, convinced the nobleman of his great theatric excellence.\n\nDavies’s description of Garrick’s histrionics presumably derives from his first-hand experience of watching Garrick perform the role in a London theatre.\n\nSuitably impressed, the Duke of Parma sent Garrick the following day ‘a very handsome gold box, with some of the finest enamelled painting upon all the sides of it I ever saw’.\n\nThis was not the only snuffbox that Garrick acquired on his travels. He was also presented with one by the Duke of Wurtemberg. According to an anecdote supplied to Arthur Murphy by Tom King, his particular snuffbox provoked a waspish comment from the actor Charles Holland:\n\nHe and Holland were in conversation with Garrick in his library. Their subject turned on some occurrences that happened on the continent. In the midst of their discourse, Garrick opened the drawer of a cabinet, and took out a rich snuff-box, given to him as a present by the Duke of Wurtemberg, for the pleasure he had received from the extraordinary specimens of English tragedy. Holland looked at this handsome trinket, and in that blunt manner, for which he was remarkable, said to Garrick, ‘And so you went about the continent, mouthing for snuff-boxes’. Garrick knew his pupil and took no offence.\n\nThe snuffbox given to Garrick by the Duke of Parma was a cherished keepsake. In her Will, Garrick’s wife, Eva Maria (1724-1822), bequeathed it to her great nephew, Nathaniel Egerton Garrick (d. 1843). It remained in this particular branch of the Garrick family until 1885 when a solicitor, William Fras. Low, acting on behalf of the executors of the Will of Wilhelmine Caroline Garrick, wrote to the V&A to inform the curators of this surprise bequest. Low’s letter offered a description of the snuffbox as well as an account of its provenance:\n\nIt is described in the Will as a gorgeous Snuff Box with six compartments of Paintings by Teniers enamelled upon Gold and as having been bequeathed by the Relict of David Garrick to the late Nathan Egerton Garrick who bequeathed the same to his eldest son the Testators later husband Nathan David Garrick and is bequeathed in compliance with his wishes to that effect to the South Kensington Museum.\n\nThis snuffbox was, I think, the first object belonging to Garrick that the V&A acquired for its collection. It has since been joined by several other evocative relics including the Garrick bedroom furniture suite, bookcase and chairs, tea service, and the Robert Adam designed ceiling for the drawing room of Garrick’s London townhouse at No. 5 Adelphi Terrace.\n\nAfterpiece"
