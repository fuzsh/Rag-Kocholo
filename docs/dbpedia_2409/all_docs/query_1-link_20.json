        "text": "https://lnkd.in/eTDYGDRs I'de recommend reading the Magna Carter book to get a better understanding of the history of the implementation of the rule of law in the U. K! that suppose to be followed by everyone on the living land! but we still see today how the rule of law is abused by those in position of authority but Magna Carta has made it that no one, not even the King or Government are above the rule of law! We can see these principles are not been adhered to due to contradictory practices concerning law from the Government. They are not honouring their codes and practices. Just look at the recent behaviour from recent politians and associates to the parties. Let's use Diane Abbots as an prime example! as her human rights have been violated recently on a great scale before the world, without the rule of law been applied to her to bring the culprit to justice! As the government are protecting these individuals due to financial gains for the party. Lee Anderson and Frank Lester should be expelled from government duties due to the discrimatory and threatening behaviours from the party members and associates, thats only caused further community relation issues and damaged any rapport that was built up between the commoners and the Establishment due to the lawless speech and conduct from these individuals associated with those in the house of commons. However, under magna carter law everyman has the right to life without been ruined, so what about Diane Abbots rights? If Keirs, Starmer doesn't reinstate the whip for Diana Abbots then all the Negroes in the UK should petition for him to be removed from his position for not uphelding the law himself, due displaying discrimination towards Diane, when we can see that on the conservatives party side, those who are seen to be committing misconduct are been dealt with quite leniently. We don't need no more covert racist who pretend their not! to be apart of implementing anymore discriminatory policies and law? Why has so much disportionate discipline been used against poor Diane? It's because she's a brown lady who speaks out about discrimination and when you start doing that you get all types of backlashes, and whoopings. I only know this too well.\n\nOnly sin understands rights ‚Äì and only sin (fear) drives the need to claim them. At the same time, love does not suffer unloving acts‚Ä¶ a loving man or woman does not allow others to do unloving things to them. A man or woman upholds law. Rights are a tool s/he may use to do that. I don‚Äôt want to teach people how to uphold their rights simply to avoid their fears ‚Äì what‚Äôs the point? Don‚Äôt you want more from life? I know I do‚Ä¶ I want the garden restored to this earth. If you want to know how to apply law to uphold the creator‚Äôs law on earth ‚Äì to clear up the planetary mess and to contribute to seeing love prevail ‚Äì then we are here to help you with that. If you just want to avoid your fears, you‚Äôre probably not a match for us. If you are terrified, but you want to get through that and are willing to face it, and you have the desire to choose to love, then welcome‚Ä¶ that is all that is needed. https://lnkd.in/gDwjM8_b\n\nAustralia is the only former British colony to celebrate its national day on the anniversary that colonisation commenced. It‚Äôs a horrible day to celebrate our incredible nation. For many Australians, January 26 marks the beginning of the genocide of the world‚Äôs oldest continuing culture. It‚Äôs the beginning of the systematic, intentional murder, abuse, and exploitation of First Nations people. Watch A.B Original's version of January 26 to view a First Nations perspective on this day. In 2018 I wrote an article on why brands should reconsider celebrating the day and 6 years on, Australia's leading brands are finally reconsidering selling Australia Day merchandise. (Will pop links in the comments) Bigger change will come. It's just a matter of time. Which side of history is your business on? It's never too late to be intentional about January 26th. And you can do this in a way that doesn't vilify or exclude people. What ntegrity is doing in 2024: üè¢ For the 7th year, we‚Äôre giving staff the option to work on this day/switch the public holiday. üó£Ô∏è We communicate that there is no \"right or wrong\" to working on this day. Not everyone has childcare options available to be able to work on a public holiday and some people may wish to attend a protest. üß†Actively learn about First Nations perspectives and history. Providing content, training (thank you Australians Together), and inviting people to share. ü´±üèæü´≤üèº We‚Äôve found opportunities to learn from our clients and partners who are leading in reconciliation and activism with First Nations groups across the country (Amnesty International , Greenfleet) üîçWe're looking for a First Nations NFP Engagement Partner - to donate directly to ($10k per year for 3 years) and provide pro bono support to help with fundraising and product development. üî• We're adapting our HR practices to increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander recruitment, retention and professional development. Most importantly: we are learning we need to change. The process and outcome of The Voice taught us we need to change our approach and re-establish and commit to our Reconciliation Action Plan. We see that we need to listen more to First Nations voices and speak less without consultation. Our focus for the future has moved from lightning rod Op Eds to long-term sustainable action working alongside (not on behalf of) First Nations people. https://lnkd.in/g37SJRNn\n\nThis is highly personal (1/3) My soon-to-be 15 year-old's project brief is for a parent's short story in graphic novel style. As I grew up in that slow-burn civil war in the northeast of Ireland euphemistically called The Troubles, he naturally wants content on it. Like anywhere on the planet, we could unite around pop culture, soccer and shared humanity. As is played out between castes, creeds and countries around the world, however, labels - accidents of birth - can and did lethally divide us. Journalists' rule of thumb covering the conflict was: Catholics largely identify as Irish and prefer 'The North,' as they call it, to reunite with the rest of Ireland. In contrast, Protestants largely identify as British and prefer Northern Ireland to remain in the UK. With the benefit of hindsight and an (occasionally) wiser head on my shoulders, I have a much more nuanced perspective today. I forgive those who would have killed me and mine, believing doing so somehow protected their kith and kin. The story sees me in a summer job in the more 'peaceful' part of Belfast where I grew up, having gone to the equivalent of junior high and high school in an Irish Catholic area - the Falls - a major hotspot for the civil strife. My voice retelling the story to my son reflects vivid memories of how I felt. A chilling d√©nouement - linking two seemingly unrelated moments - came years later, and follows in Part Three. Anyway, here's Part One. Please forgive the photo quality, and a former spelling bee champ's capacity for typos in this deadline-racing first draft.\n\nJeffrey Tucker of Brownstone Institute, a personal hero of mine since he created the Institute, writes, with some measure of sympathy: ‚ÄúThe people we pay to think, influence, and guide the public mind ‚Äì and possess the requisite intelligence and training to do so ‚Äì also happen to be the least capable of doing so because their professional options are so limited. As a result, the term ‚Äúindependent intellectual‚Äù has become nearly an oxymoron.‚Äù Brownstone has provided an oasis and an outlet for brave minds to publish narrative-challenging findings and arguments, and share insights and musings. It is, perhaps most importantly, establishing a globe-spanning community of friends dedicated to intellectual and moral integrity. It is just this sort of community that is needed now, perhaps more than ever. The institute is now striving to sponsor affordable salon-style retreats for people who want to entertain the most serious and pressing questions of our time with others who are unafraid of questions as they arise. Perhaps this is what the university of the future should look like. It won‚Äôt continue to expand, though, without financial support from individuals dedicated to intellectual integrity and freedom of thought. No good thing can bloom among the briars that choke out real intellectual engagement in our institutions unless their are heroic sacrifices from people who value what is true and good over what is lucrative. Rethink your portfolio of giving. Help these tender shoots of hope fighting for life and breath. Be a friend to those who love what is good and true and beautiful."
