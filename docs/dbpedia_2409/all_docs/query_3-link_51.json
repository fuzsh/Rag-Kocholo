        "text": "First seen professionally at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds, where it began performances June 18 prior to an official opening June 26 for a run that ended July 14, the musical is inspired by \"Welcome to Loverville,\" an album by Son of Dork of which Bourne is the founder.\n\nIt is directed by Steven Dexter with choreography by Nick Winston. The West Yorkshire Playhouse run was produced by the theatre with Kevin Wallace for FIRST ACT! Limited (who is producing the transfer) and Youth Music Theatre UK (who staged the show's first try-out student production).\n\nAccording to press materials for the original Yorkshire run, the show is about \"dating, binary and staying true to your dreams...The class of 1971 have reached their senior year. Michael, Lucas, Francis and Marvin are about to revolutionise the world when a new complication enters their life -- girls. When the brilliantly clever and stunningly beautiful Holly arrives in town all of Michael's dreams seem to be coming true, but arch nemesis Eddie has his sights on stealing Michael's perfect girl and taking all the credit for his world changing ideas.\"\n\nThe Leeds cast featured Aaron Sidwell as super-smart geek Michael Dork, with newcomer Richard Howe as Lucas, Lil' Chris as Francis and Eliza Hope Bennett as Holly. Eddie was played by Gareth Gates, who will not be continuing with the production for its transfer.\n\nBourne has written seven number one hit songs, had numerous top three singles, and played to sold-out arenas across the U.K. He has won two Brit Awards and played two Royal Variety Performances. As an artist and songwriter, it is estimated he has sold over six million records. He has also written for numerous other artists including McFly, The Saturdays, Jonas Brothers and Pixie Lott. Davis is a writer and composer, who has written Out There and Loserville with Bourne and co-wrote Soho Cinders with Anthony Drewe that features music by George Stiles.\n\nThe box office is yet to open."
