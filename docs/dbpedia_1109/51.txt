What had started out as a bunch of girlfriends catching up for drinks and a bit of a sing-along turned into one of Australia's biggest pop groups of the late '80s and early '90s. In the first episode of a two-part special, singers Ally Fowler, Tottie Goldsmith, Angie Arnott (n√©e La Bozzetta) and Eve von Bibra, as well as musicians Brett Goldsmith, Scott Griffiths and David Reyne talk about how The Chantoozies came into being and went from playing gigs in one of the clubs run by the Goldsmiths' father to hitting the ARIA top 10 with their cover of "Witch Queen" and original track "Wanna Be Up". We'll also hear about the head-to-head battle with The Party Boys thanks to rival versions of "He's Gonna Step On You Again" and how the band's rigorous touring schedule earned them cred on the local music scene. In Part 2, the story continues as members leave and the eight-piece band, that also featured the late Frank McCoy on guitar, slims down to a trio.
