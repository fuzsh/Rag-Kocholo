But her vocal talent soon got her snapped up as a backing singer for artists like Wa Wa Nee, Peter Blakeley and Kylie Minogue. It was her voice that also saw her hired as the latest front...\n\nBorn to parents who both worked in the entertainment industry, Dannielle Gaha grew up surrounded by singing and dancing, training and helping out at the talent school run by her mother, Janice Breen. She made her first steps into the industry herself by appearing on TV talent contest Star Search, which led to ongoing singing work with judge Glenn Shorrock and, through that, her big break — being picked to record duet \"Communic...\n\nIt was inevitable that singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Rick Price would forge a career in the music industry, but rather than jumping at any offer of a record deal that came his way, he took his time to ensure the situation was just right. Before signing to Sony Music and releasing debut album Heaven Knows in 1992, he worked for many years as a session singer, appearing in a national ad for Australia's Bicentennia...\n\nIn 1983, synthpop bands were big business on the Australian music scene, with Kids In The Kitchen snapped up by Mushroom Records imprint White Label Records.

In an extensive interview about her music career, Katie explains her ...\n\nFor Sally Polihronas, the Bardot experience had its ups and downs. On the plus side, being part of the girl group allowed her to really hone her vocal skills — something she wanted to focus on after more than a decade as a dancer and performer in Adelaide — and took her into the studio with producers around the world. She also got to have her \"Madonna moment\" in the \"These Days\" video and has many cherish memori...\n\nIn early 2000, reality TV juggernaut Popstars changed the pop music landscape in Australia forever. Launched by the show, Bardot were an instant phenomenon, shooting to number 1 with debut single \"Poison\" and their self-titled album.

Formed by the core trio of Ray Medhurst and brothers Bryon and Jonathon Jones, the funk/soul/R&B/hip-hop/dance-influenced band also welcom...\n\nAs vocalist of Do-Ré-Mi and as a solo artist, Deborah Conway has received critical acclaim and mainstream success, but in this wide-ranging interview, the singer/songwriter reveals her music career hasn't always been smooth sailing.

That song was \"Read My Lips\" and in a frank and at times raw interview, Melissa reveals her naivety about the track's sexual overtones and how its success took everyone by surprise. She ...\n\nFunk, dance, pop, soul, jazz, rock, musical theatre and, with new album My Life Is A Symphony, orchestral arrangements, Kate Ceberano has covered a lot of musical terrain in her 40-year recording career. In this honest and unflinching chat, the singer/songwriter discusses the pop side of her extensive catalogue of work, starting as singer of '80s band I'm Talking and continuing through the roller-coaster ride of her solo ...\n\nR&B and funk had been slow to take off in Australia, but when those genres really started to be embraced locally in the mid-'90s, a four-piece boy band from Melbourne were perfectly placed to become this country's pre-eminent vocal harmony group.

She explains why the choices being made at this stage weren't ones she agreed with and how meeting husband Richard Harrison helped ge...\n\nIn a career spanning almost 20 years, Ricki-Lee Coulter has gone from the shock of an early elimination in Season 2 of Australian Idol to a prominent presence on the pop culture landscape thanks to her 15 top 50 hit singles, four studio albums, hosting gigs on two of the country's top reality shows (including the 2023 revamp of Idol) and role as a radio host. In the first part of a two-part chat, Ricki discusses her decision n...\n\nBetween 1980 and 1990, Icehouse racked up 13 top 20 hits across six studio albums and cracked both the US and the UK top 20 at different points, Initially known as Flowers, the band fronted by Iva Davies were at the forefront of new wave music in Australia, with their sound ranging from atmospheric synth ballads to rocky party tunes — and everything in between.

Recruited to front the band for top 5 ...\n\nThe Chantoozies had enjoyed an amazing run from their inception to the release of their debut album, but behind the hit singles and high rotation music videos, tensions were simmering. A split down gender lines developed — a situation that was exacerbated by a relentless touring schedule and some members not feeling they had enough say.
