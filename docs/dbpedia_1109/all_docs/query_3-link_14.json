        "text": "The girls originally formed for a one off show at the renowned Melbourne Underground nightclub, where they received an overwhelming response and their first residency.\n\n​\n\n​A recording contract with Mushroom Records soon followed and The Chantoozies found Top 10 success with their first single ‘Witch Queen of New Orleans’. Touring extensively, they delighted audiences across the country with their hit songs – ‘Wanna Be Up’, ‘Kiss & Tell’, ‘Walk On’,‘He’s Gonna Step On You’.\n\n​They went on to sell over 300,00 records, receiving Gold and Platinum status throughout the 80’s and 90’s.\n\n​\n\nThe Chantoozies shared the stage with many top Australian acts including John Farnham, Ross Wilson/Mondo Rock, Leo Sayer, James Reyne, Daryl Braithwaite, Hoodoo Gurus and a 38 show Australia wide tour supporting international act Billy Joel.\n\nAfter taking time out to pursue their individual careers, the girls reunited for ’25 Years of Mushroom Music’ at the MCG and then again in 2006 for the national ‘Countdown Spectacular’ tour.​\n\n​\n\nThe last few years have seen The Chantoozies release two new singles, appear on countless TV / radio shows and continue to wow audiences throughout Australia, most recently, with Bananarama, Wang Chung, Go West, Paul Young, Rick Astley and as part of the ‘Gold FM Concert’ series with their special blend of rock and pop.\n\nOne of Australia’s most dynamic, irresistibly catchy and hottest live bands, The Chantoozies are here to stay!\n\n​\n\n​"
