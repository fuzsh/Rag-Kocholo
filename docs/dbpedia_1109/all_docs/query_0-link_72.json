        "text": "Charlie is driven by a conscious connection and connecting people. His greatest joy in life is knowing he can meet people’s needs. This, coupled with his intention to generate a cultural shift in agriculture so as to improve the relationship between farmers and eaters, is the legacy he hopes to be remembered for.\n\nCharlie Arnott burst on my radar serendipitously, just like a nexus point where destiny and opportunity collide. My two great loves – food and music – have brought us to this place thanks to my sous chef Jasmine Norton – who kept bangin’ on about biodynamic farming down on Charlie’s farm at Boorowa – and one of my favourite gals Eve von Bibra. Eve wears many hats including chief cat herder for our extended Rockwiz family who pop into my kitchen for a feed every year over Easter during Bluesfest. Finally the penny dropped that both Jazzy and Eve were talking about the same folk – Farmer Charlie and his beautiful bride, Angelica.\n\nSo, fast forward a footy season and here we are about to roll out a great day in Sydney together as ambassadors for Landcare Australia’s launch of From Farm to Fork. FFTF is a fundraising campaign all about getting together to enjoy awesome Australian food, while supporting the farmers that make it possible, and the event in the Sydney CBD that celebrates farmers, growers and passionate chefs like me. Scroll down for details.\n\nWho’s Your Farmer?\n\nWhen was the last time you took a moment to consider who collected the eggs that you scrambled this morning for breakfast or the farmer who pulled the carrots from the ground that you had with dinner last night?\n\nWhile Charlie Arnott’s surname is better-known for his great-grandfather’s biscuit company, Charlie has always known his place to be working on the land in agriculture. He has made it his life’s mission to help consumers understand and track the origin of their food from field to fork and to help Australian’s know ‘Who’s your farmer?’.\n\n“They’re interested in the sizzle and not just the sausage.”\n\nCharlie is driven by a conscious connection and connecting people. His greatest joy in life is knowing he can meet people’s needs. This, coupled with his intention to generate a cultural shift in agriculture so as to improve the relationship between farmers and eaters, is the legacy he hopes to be remembered for.\n\nA biodynamic farmer and grazier, he is based on his 5000 acre mixed farming property at Boorowa, NSW, where he has established tens of thousands of native trees. He is passionate about growing clean healthy beef, which he sells direct to customers under his brand Charlie Arnott Natural Grass Fed Beef.\n\nWinner of the Conservation Farmer of the Year – Lachlan Region, Charlie has won several agricultural industry awards and has been an active Landcarer since the inception of the grass-roots movement in 1989. He is currently chair of the regional Landcare organisation, LachLandcare.\n\nFrom Biscuits to Beef\n\nThe Arnott family have bred and grown Shorthorn cattle at ‘Hanaminno’, Boorowa for 45 years, with our core bred since 1958. Michael Arnott, the great, great-grandson of William Arnott, the man who started the Famous Arnott’s Biscuit Company, decided after 8 years in the Homebush biscuit factory in Sydney to break with tradition, and given his strong family ties with the bush, moved to Boorowa after a few years in Southern Queensland. His son, Charlie Arnott, took over the reins in 1997, and has continued the proud Arnott tradition of producing high quality Australian products.\n\nCharlie Arnott Natural Grass Fed Beef\n\nOrder or enquire: charlie@charliearnott.com.au\n\n0412 623 422\n\nFirst published September 2015, updated April 2020."
