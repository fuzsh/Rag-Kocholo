        "text": "This page is not approved by MOVIEPEDIA, if this article includes any illegal or wrong information it belongs to the creator or editor user.\n\nKenny is a 2006 Australian mockumentary film starring Shane Jacobson as Kenny Smyth, a Melbourne plumber who works for a portable toilet rental company.\n\nDirector Clayton Jacobson describes the character of Kenny as \"'The Dalai-Lama' of Waste Management, eternally optimistic and always ready to put others before himself. Kenny represents the humbling nature of common decency.\" The film was shot entirely on location in the western suburbs of Melbourne and Nashville, Tennessee in the United States.\n\nThe film was released in the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom on 28 September 2007.\n\nPlot[]\n\nKenny is a mockumentary that follows the fictional Kenny through his daily life. His work and his personal relationships are explored as Kenny goes about his day-to-day activities and speaks directly to the camera and his audience. Kenny provides a most basic service to the community, portable toilets. The audience sees Kenny interviewing potential clients and involved in major public events. It is important to Kenny to know the kind of food and drink to be served at these events as this will determine the level of service he provides. Never ashamed of his job, despite the disparagement of some (including his own family), Kenny regards himself as a professional. Even at the most prestigious events for which he caters, Kenny realises that the most glamorous will need his portable toilets. He sees life in all of its complexities through the need of his services. Kenny takes his son Jesse to visit his father, but is hampered by his ex-wife's uncooperativeness and his father's bitterness. When Kenny travels to Nashville to attend a toilet convention, he is thrilled to travel outside his native Melbourne. His ingenuity, friendship and commitment to his profession opens business opportunities in Japan and the potential for a new relationship with Jackie, a flight attendant, but he must return home prematurely when his father suffers a medical emergency. In an attempt at bonding, Kenny and his father and his wealthy brother David go camping. After half a day, David leaves in disdain, to which Kenny tries to defend prompting his father to tell Kenny to step out of his brothers shadow and stick up for himself, a conversation with his father back in the tent prompts Kenny to consider his life. He reveals that his success in Nashville has led to the offer of a promotion, and though his father urges him to accept, Kenny is unsure. When Kenny's ex-wife unexpectedly leaves him with Jesse on the day of the Melbourne Cup, his busiest day of the year, Kenny finds Jesse to be an able and cheerful assistant. However, prejudice against his work again appears, with customers complaining that a child should not be made to clean toilets, and Kenny remands Jesse to the office. When he returns to find Jesse gone, Kenny searches the venue in a panic and eventually finds Jesse at the toilets, wanting to help again. That night, as he is about to drive away in his septic tank truck after a long and exhausting day, Kenny's way is blocked by a luxury car whose driver insensitively brushes off his requests to move. Kenny eventually breaks habit to fill the man's car with human waste, a suggestion that perhaps Kenny has decided to stick up for himself a little bit more. Finally, Kenny declines the opportunity to become an executive and seeks out Jackie to renew their relationship.\n\nCast[]\n\nShane Jacobson as Kenny Smyth\n\nEve von Bibra as Jackie Sheppard\n\nClayton Jacobson as David Smyth\n\nRonald Jacobson as Bill Smyth\n\nJesse Jacobson as Jesse Smyth\n\nMorihiko Hasebe as Sushi Cowboy\n\nVicki Musso as Kenny's ex-wife and Ringless Woman\n\nGlenn Preusker as Glenn\n\nChris Davis as Pat\n\nIan Dryden as Sammy\n\nMark Robertson as Robbo\n\nAlf Scerri as Alf\n\nJason Gann as Drunk Guy at Melbourne Cup\n\nNash Edgerton as Golf Cart Victim\n\nWorld premiere[]\n\nIn line with the theme of the film, its first screening was held in the Victorian country town of Poowong.[1]\n\nReception[]\n\nKenny received positive reviews.

She also praised the film's technical accomplishment, describing it as \"a triumph, superbly shot, edited and directed by Clayton Jacobson â€“ probably surpassing most Australian movies with its command of film language, shot on HD video to boot\".[4] Margaret Pomeranz from At the Movies awarded the film a score of 4.5 out of 5.
