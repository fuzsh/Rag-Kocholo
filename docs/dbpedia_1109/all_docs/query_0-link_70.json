        "text": "Here is the third in my series on recommended Australian (Oz) films, and I will look at 50 more Oz films I think are worth watching.\n\nIn 2016, I published my recommendations for the 100 best Australian films (see Ozflicks Guide to the Top 50 Australian Films and Ozflicks Guide to the Top 100 Australian films (Part 2 – 51 to 100)). I have updated these two pages annually as I have seen new Oz films worthy of inclusion, and you may wish to check these as well.\n\nNow it’s time to delve a bit deeper into Antipodean Cinema, to wander down the wombat hole of cinematic Australiana, as we look at another 50 Oz films and why you should consider watching them. (These are films which I have ranked from 101 to 150 on the list of 650* Oz films I have seen so far – the list is here). I have rated all these films at three and a half stars out of five, meaning above average. I have enjoyed all of these films (as well as all the 100+ films I have given three stars).\n\nA quick word about my taste – I like drama and comedy; I tend to dislike most horror and action films, and many ‘thrillers’. If your taste is a little Old School like mine, you may also like some of these films. Most of the films below are dramas and comedies, but there are a few action flicks, a number of thrillers (one of which borders on horror), some crime-comedies, some biopics, a few quirky films (it is Australia after all) and even a new take on a silent movie.\n\nBy the way, all these films follow my definition of what is an Australian film, that is, they tell stories about Australians and Australia.\n\nLet’s go\n\n[*Page updated in August 2023 with newly seen inclusions (and other ranking changes)]\n\n101. Kenny (2006) (Clayton Jacobson)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 101/650\n\nGenre: Comedy/Mockumentary\n\nSet in: Melbourne and Nashville (USA) in the 2000s\n\nCast: Shane Jacobson, Eve Von Bibra, Ronald Jacobson, Ian Dryden, Chris Davis, Jesse Jacobson\n\nSynopsis: Kenny, the manager of Splashdown, a portable toilet business, takes you on a tour his business activities, and you also get to see his private life.\n\nWhy See This Film: This film demonstrates the best of toilet humour, as Kenny teaches us a thousand euphemisms for natural human functions and the associated paraphenalia. Kenny is a man who sees it as his life’s mission to ensure everyone, everywhere has a pleasant place to relieve themselves at the thousand temporary celebrations that take place in and around Melbourne. Kenny even goes to a portable-loo conference in Nashville, enabling a bit of cross-cultural fun. Shane Jacobson is perfect as Kenny, and somehow manages to keep the joke going seamlessly for 90 minutes and leave you smiling at the end (if you like a good poo-joke, that is). Jacobson co-wrote the script with his brother Clayton, who directed the film. The film was a surprise hit in Australia.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: The Castle, Crackerjack, The Rage in Placid Lake, Strange Bedfellows, Muriel’s Wedding, Crocodile Dundee, Charlie and Boots, The Club, The Nugget\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4½ and 2½ stars respectively),\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Australian Screen Online, Film streamed on Ozflix, Trailer\n\n102. Bran Nue Day (2009) (Rachel Perkins)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 102/650\n\nGenre: Musical Comedy/Drama/Romance\n\nSet in: Broome (WA) in the 1960s\n\nCast: Rocky McKenzie, Ernie Dingo, ‘Missy’ Higgins, Tom Budge, Geoffrey Rush, Magda Szubanski, Deborah Mailman, Jessica Mauboy, Ningali Lawford\n\nSynopsis: An Aboriginal teenager is sent away by his religious mother to a Catholic boarding school near Perth but escapes to return to his family and the girl he loves.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is one of Australia’s few ‘real’ musicals (where characters burst into song to express their thoughts and feelings as opposed to films about musicians like The Sapphires or Dogs in Space), and it works pretty well on that level. It’s lively, funny and pretty strong musically, starring singers Jessica Mauboy and Missy Higgens, as well as top Oz actors Geoffrey Rush, Magda Szubanski, and Deborah Mailman along with a host of newcomers. This film and Perkin’s previous film One Night the Moon are actually better than our few other ‘real’ musicals such as Moulin Rouge (which fails my ‘Australian film’ test anyway), Starstruck and Oz. The film’s joyous celebration of Aboriginal identity is a rarity in Australian cinema.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: The Sapphires, Radiance, Beneath Clouds, One Night the Moon, The Fringe Dwellers, Top End Wedding, Beneath Clouds\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 stars from both), Luke Buckmaster\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Australian Screen Online, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n103. Danny Deckchair (2003) (Jeff Balsmeyer)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 103/650\n\nGenre: Comedy/Romance\n\nSet in: Sydney and Bellingen (NSW) in 2000s\n\nCast: Rhys Ifans, Miranda Otto, Justine Clarke, Rhys Muldoon, John Batchelor\n\nSynopsis: A truck-driver’s experiment with helium balloons and a deckchair carry him away from suburbia to a new life in the bush.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a sweet quirky romantic comedy about breaking away from mundane lives to find magic. The story is based on the urban-legend about a man tying balloons to his chair and managing to fly a considerable distance. Welsh actor Rhys Ifans is completely convincing as an inventive Aussie truck-driver, Miranda Otto is very good (and more cheerful here than in most roles she gets) as the woman into whose life Danny falls, and Justine Clarke is marvellous as the ambitious ex-girlfriend. In addition, the north coast town (Bellingen renamed Clarence) has a cast of local eccentrics that would make Doc Martin or Hamish MacBeth feel right at home. Wonderful location filming in Sydney (Earlwood and Charing Cross) and Bellingen, looking idyllically verdant, as indeed it is in real life. The flying deckchair scenes are fun as well.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Love and Other Catastrophes, Russian Doll, Thank God He Met Lizzie, Dating the Enemy, Paperback Hero, The Rage in Placid Lake, Me, Myself, I, Look Both Ways, Muriel’s Wedding, Strictly Ballroom, Crackerjack\n\nRecommended Reviews: Margaret and David (3½ and 3 stars respectively), Urban Cinephile, Washington Post\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Amazon, Trailer\n\n104. Lion (2016) (Garth Davis)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 104/650\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nSet in: India and Tasmania, from the 1980s to 2012\n\nCast: Sunny Pawar, Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman, Rooney Mara, David Wenham\n\nSynopsis: The true story of a small Indian boy, Saroo, who falls asleep on a train and wakes up in Calcutta with no idea of the name of his village or how to get back there. He is eventually adopted by an Australian couple, but later becomes obsessed with finding his real family.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a moving and generally upbeat film about the effects of inter-country adoption on both the children and the adopting parents. The film is contains an interesting portrait of Indian society in all its diversity, with its close family ties and its harshness for those in poverty and for the 80,000 children who go missing every year. The child actors who play Saroo and his brother are amazing. The older Saroo is played by British actor Dev Patel who is also good as usual, and conveniently handsome. Nicole Kidman and David Wenham are fine as the very ordinary, decent Australian couple – both look a little dowdy and dull: caring, but a little lacking in personality. The film tells us more about India than Australia, but is recommended for its depiction of humanity and relationships.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: The Home Song Stories, Careful He Might Hear You, Caterpillar Wish, Beneath Clouds, The Boys are Back, Romulus, My Father, Swimming Upstream, Floating Life, Ali’s Wedding,\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Benjamin Lee (Guardian), Vanity Fair, RogerEbert.Com\n\nOther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n105. The New Boy (2023) (Warwick Thornton)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 105/650\n\nGenre: Period Drama/Fantasy/Arthouse\n\nSet in: Rural South Australia in the 1940s (during World War Two)\n\nCast: Aswan Reid, Cate Blanchett, Deborah Mailman, Wayne Blair\n\nSynopsis: A young Aboriginal boy is captured and brought to live in a Catholic orphanage in rural South Australia during World War Two.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a beautiful film, capturing the grandeur of the South Australian farmland, as well as the intricate details of life for a gifted young Aboriginal boy thrown into an isolated Catholic orphanage with six or seven other young boys of various racial backgrounds. The young boy, who remains nameless throughout the film, settles in to the regimented life of the orphanage, but does not conform to its rules, rather co-existing alongside the other more obedient boys, and interacting with them on his terms. Because the boy has a magic light in his fingertips which comforts and centres him when he lies beneath his bed (sic) each night in the spartan dormitory. Cate Blanchett is good, as always, playing the head nun who has illegally taken over the orphanage since the priest died, and Deborah Mailman and Wayne Blair are stalwart as her Aboriginal assistants. But it is Aswan Reid, as the boy, who makes this film into a riveting fantasy, where Aboriginal spiritualism and magic co-exist with Catholic dogma for much of the story. It is an engaging character study of individuals making their own meaning in our wide brown land.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Sweet Country, Samson and Delilah, Rabbit-Proof Fence, Walkabout, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, Beneath Clouds, Satellite Boy\n\nRecommended Reviews: Guardian,\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n106. Unfinished Sky (2007) (Peter Duncan)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 106/650\n\nGenre: Drama/ Romance\n\nSet in: Rural Queensland in the 2000s\n\nCast: William McInnes, Monic Hendrickx, David Field, Bille Brown, Roy Billing, Christopher Sommers\n\nSynopsis: A Queensland farmer takes in an Afghan woman who has fled from criminals.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a very effective drama about a dour middle aged farmer whose life is changed when an escaped Afghan woman seeks refuge from her exploiters. They grow to trust each other, but the danger from her pursuers closes in. This film is tense, tender and thought-provoking, coming during the debates about accepting refugees, particularly Muslim refugees in Australia. William McInnes transcends his wooden style, and Dutch actress, Monic Hendrickx, is very effective as the Afgan woman (interestingly, she also played a Polish woman in an earlier Dutch version of this story, The Polish Bride). McInnes and Hendrickx picked up the AFI best actor and actress awards for this film.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Lantana, Look Both Ways, Kiss or Kill, Looking For Grace, The Dry, The Broken Shore, Mystery Road, The Hunter, The Boys are Back, The Turning, Dirt Music, Burning Man, Beautiful Kate, Mullet, Breath, Noise\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (3½ and 4 stars respectively)\n\nFurther Information: IMBd, Australian Screen Online, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n107. Lilian’s Story (1996) (Jerzy Domaradzki)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 107/650\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nSet in: Sydney (Balmain and elsewhere) in the 1990s and 1950s\n\nCast: Ruth Cracknell, Toni Collette. Barry Otto\n\nSynopsis: Lilian, a woman aged 60 or 70, is released after 40 years in an asylum, to a life on the streets.\n\nWhy See This Film: This film, by Polish-born director Domaradszki and adapted from Kate Grenville’s novel, was based on a real Sydney street-eccentric. The film tells the story of Lilian’s youth with her overbearing father, her life in the asylum where she shares her obsession with Shakespeare with the other inmates, and her life after her release when, as an old woman, she roams the Sydney streets, declaiming Shakespeare and freaking out passers-by. It is a touching and occasionally amusing film, propelled by three great actors: Ruth Cracknell as the older Lilian, Toni Collette as the young Lilian and Barry Otto playing first her awful father and later her meek brother with whom she is reunited as an older woman.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Shine, Passion, Cosi, Swimming Upstream, Children of the Revolution, Eye of the Storm, Muriel’s Wedding, The Dressmaker, Love Serenade, The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\n\nRecommended Reviews: Margaret and David (4½ and 4 stars respectively)\n\nOther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia – Ozmovies dossier – Excerpt\n\n108. Lucky Miles (2007) (Michael James Rowland)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 108/650\n\nGenre: Comedy with a serious message\n\nSet in: Western Australian desert in the 2000s.\n\nCast: Kenneth Moraleda, Rodney Afif, Sri Sacdprascuth, Glenn Shea, Don Hany, Sean Mununggurr, Sawung Jabo, Arif Hidayat\n\nSynopsis:. Three fugitives, one Iraqi asylum-seeker, one Cambodian looking for his Australian father and one Indonesian sailor wander the West Australian desert together looking for Australians or at least a bus to Perth. Meanwhile three blokes from the Army Reserve attempt to locate them.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a witty film about a big issue, the flight of asylum seekers to western countries such as Australia. Made in the middle of Australia’s debates about onshore and offshore detention of asylum seekers who attempt to reach Australia, this film humanises the situation, not as melodrama, but as comedy – a comedy with a serious message of course. The film works well, examining cultural differences as well as human commonalities. The landscape is beautifully filmed and reminds us of the vast emptiness of much of Australia. An entertaining look at a serious issue.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Unfinished Sky, Japanese Story, : Walkabout, Bran Nue Day, The Year of Living Dangerously, Top End Wedding, Beneath Clouds\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 and 3½ stars respectively), Luke Buckmaster (Guardian 2014)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Australian Screen Online, Trailer\n\n109. Not Suitable for Children (2012) (Peter Templeman)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 109/650\n\nGenre: Comedy/Romance/Drama\n\nSet in: Inner-city Sydney (Newtown) in the 2010s\n\nCast: Ryan Kwanten, Sarah Snook, Ryan Corr, Bojana Novakovic, Alice Parkinson, Daniel Henshall, Clare Bowen, Kathryn Beck\n\nSynopsis: A young hedonist, who is told he has testicular cancer and has only 3 weeks before he becomes infertile, has to think fast.\n\nWhy See This Film: This film works really well, despite its unexpected premise, due to its smart script and likable characters. Ryan Kwanten, Sarah Snook and Ryan Corr show that Australia has a promising new generation of actors. The story is resolved amusingly, but (unlike most Hollywood comedies) believably. Plus, for Sydneysiders, it is a particular pleasure to see the action taking place in some of our favourite areas of Newtown!\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Look Both Ways, Love and Other Catastrophes, Russian Doll, Better Than Sex, My Year Without Sex, Thank God He Met Lizzie, Dating the Enemy, The Rage in Placid Lake, Paperback Hero, Danny Deckchair, Any Questions for Ben?\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 stars from both)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n110. Sweetie (1989) (Jane Campion)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 110/650\n\nGenre: Arthouse Comedy/Satire\n\nSet in: Suburban Sydney and Warren NSW in the 1980s\n\nCast: Genevieve Lemon, Karen Colston, Tom Lycos, Jon Darling, Dorothy Barry, Michael Lake, Andre Pataczek, Jean Hadgraft, Paul Livingston, Louise Fox\n\nSynopsis: Kay and Dawn are a strange pair of sisters: Kay is shy, repressed and superstitious, but she manages to hold down a job in some institution; Dawn, called ‘Sweetie’ by her family, is loud, undisciplined and has some level of mental illness which makes her family concede to her whims. When Dawn moves out of her parents’ home and into the house where Kay is trying to forge a relationship with Louis, things spin out of control, and the sister’s odd parents Gordon and Flo.\n\nWhy See This Film: This was Jane Campion’s cinematic debut, after making a number of acclaimed shorts and a TV film, and it’s full of witty arthouse weirdness, focusing on a strange family from the world of Australian suburbia. Though Sweetie is the weirdest and most disruptive of the family, none of the others is exactly normal. Kay is a loner at her work, she chooses her boyfriend Louis (whom she steals from a colleague) according to a fortune-teller’s advice, and has a fear of trees as well as a fascination with porcelain horses. She has problems with sex, unlike Sweetie, who enjoys loud and frequent sexual encounters with the wacked-out boyfriend Bob who she brings to live in Kay’s house for a time. There are heaps of hilarious supporting characters as well, from Kay’s bitchy workmates, to Flo’s dancing jackeroos, to the little kid next door who loves to play with Sweetie. None of the main characters is exactly happy, although though do have some happy moments. The film is both funny and sad and touching in its own strange way. I didn’t ‘get’ this film the first time I saw it, but when I saw it again, I was struck by the funny little world Campion has created for us.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Holy Smoke, Greenkeeping, Love Serenade, Bliss, Cosi, The Dressmaker, Proof, Children of the Revolution, The Rage in Placid Lake\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David, Ozmovies (review section)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb,Wikipedia, Ozmovies, Australian Screen, Trailer\n\n111. Beneath Hill 60 (2010) (Jeremy Sims)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 111/650\n\nGenre: War drama\n\nSet in: France in 1916\n\nCast: Brendan Cowell, Mark Coles Smith, Alan Dukes, Leon Ford, Bob Franklin, Harrison Gilbertson, Gyton Grantley, Anthony Hayes, Chris Haywood, Bella Heathcote, Steve Le Marquand, Gerald Lepkowski, Jacqueline McKenzie, John Stanton, Martin Thomas, Alex Thompson, Aden Young, Duncan Young, Warwick Young\n\nSynopsis: The true story of Oliver Woodward, one of a team of Australian miners who fought on the Western Front in WW1, digging a tunnel to plant explosives under the German lines.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a gripping account of Australians at war, this time in the claustrophobic environment of tunnels under the front lines of the Western Front. The film captures the urgency and danger of war better than any other Oz film since Gallipoli. The cinematography is excellent and all the actors in this ensemble drama do a great job, particularly Brendan Cowell as Woodwood. Highly recommended.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Gallipoli, The Lighthorsemen, Breaker Morant, The Odd Angry Shot, Danger Close, William Kelly’s War, Forty Thousand Horsemen, The Man From Snowy River, 1915 (Mini-series), Anzacs (Mini-series)\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (3½ and 3 stars respectively)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n112. Passion (1999) (aka Passion: The Story of Percy Grainger) (Peter Duncan)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 112/650\n\nGenre: Biopic/period drama\n\nSet in: London before WW1 and Australia (briefly)\n\nCast: Richard Roxburgh, Barbara Hershey, Emily Woof, Claudia Karvan, Simon Burke, Linda Cropper, Julia Blake, Bille Brown, Martin Jacobs, Fiona Press, Genevieve Mooy, Peter Whitford, Jamie Croft, Claire Paradine, Branden Zandstra, Tailith Hughes, Scott Irwin, Dacre King, Roy Billing\n\nSynopsis: The great and eccentric Australian pianist and composer Percy Granger lived in London up to the start of World War One, and the film shows his intense relationship with his mother, as well as with two young women who were attracted to his genius.\n\nWhy See This Film: Percy Grainger was an important Australian composer and a wonderful pianist, and this engaging film looks at both the musical aspects of Grainger’s life (such as his interest in folk music and experimentation), as well as his eccentric lifestyle (his intense relationship with his mother sparked rumours of incest, and he practised sado-masochism with his lovers). All the actors are wonderful, especially Richard Roxburgh playing the mercurial Grainger, but also Barbara Hershey as his doting, but brittle mother with whom he often shares a bed, and Emily Woof, who plays his Danish lover who submits to his erotic whims. Claudia Karvan is also excellent as Grainger’s musician friend who refuses his advances but helps him as a friend. The film is an entertaining reminder of a largely forgotten complex musical phenomenon.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: , Shine, Careful He Might Hear You, Eye of the Storm, Newsfront, South Solitary, Wherever She Goes\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4½ and 3½ stars respectively), Ozmovies (Review section)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, YouTube\n\n113. Paradise Road (1997) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 113/650\n\nGenre: Prison camp drama\n\nSet in: Singapore and Sumatra from 1942 to 1945\n\nCast: Glenn Close, Pauline Collins, Cate Blanchett, Jennifer Ehle, Frances McDormand, Julianna Margulies, Elzabeth Spriggs, Lia Scallon, Pamela Rabe, Tessa Humphries, Wendy Hughes, Lisa Hensley, Susie Porter, Pauline Chan, Clyde Kusatsu, Stan Egi, Aden Young, Stephen O’Rourke, Noel Ferrier, Steven Grives, Robert Grubb, Julie Anthony\n\nSynopsis: A group of Australian, British, Dutch and American women are captured by the Japanese after the fall of Singapore in 1942, and sent to a prison camp in Sumatra, where they form a choir to help them survive the hardships.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a remarkable true story of a group of women who survive through three longs years of starvation and disease, under the strict and sometimes brutal supervision of Japanese prison guards. Though many die, some survive by making beautiful music which brings them together and helps them through. It’s an outstanding cast, with Glenn Close playing the key role, and Cate Blanchett appearing in one of her first films. Bruce Beresford’s films are always well-made and there is always something interesting and moving in them.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Sisters of War, A Town Like Alice, Ladies in Black, Blood Oath, Newsfront,\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (3½ and 4 stars respectively), ReelViews\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, Trailer\n\n114. Russian Doll (2001) (Stavros Kazantzidis)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 114/650\n\nGenre: Romantic Comedy\n\nSet in: Bondi (Sydney) in the 2000s\n\nCast: Hugo Weaving, Natalia Novikova, David Wenham, Sacha Horler, Rebecca Frith\n\nSynopsis: A young Russian Jewish woman trying to stay in Australia after the death of her fiancé, shares the flat of a pessimistic, non-Jewish private detective who works mainly on adultery cases.\n\nWhy See This Film: Australia makes relatively few rom-coms, and even fewer successful ones. This is one of our best in my opinion (as Look Both Ways is more drama than rom-com and Muriel’s Wedding is more comedy). It is full of humour, charm and eventual romance. It is set mainly in the famous beachside suburb of Bondi, and Bondi and the surrounding suburbs have never looked so good on film. But besides the beach, Bondi is also (incongruously) home to a large Russian Jewish community, and it is this community who provide much of the culture-clash humour in the film. This is one of very few Australian films which features Australia’s Jewish community, in marked contrast to Hollywood where Jewish characters and stories abound. Hugo Weaving is great (as usual) as Harvey, the non-Jewish private detective who has lost faith in humanity; Natalia Novikova is very funny as the spunky Russian, full of life but without a visa; David Wenham moves away from his dry Anglo-Australian roles to play Harvey’s orthodox Jewish friend (not entirely successfully) and Sacha Horler is fantastic playing a Russian vamp. I really enjoyed this film for the comedy and the various familiar locations from my home city of Sydney which appear in the film.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Look Both Ways, Love and Other Catastrophes, Danny Deckchair, Better Than Sex, My Year Without Sex, Thank God He Met Lizzie, Dating the Enemy, The Rage in Placid Lake, Paperback Hero\n\nRecommended Review: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (both gave this film 3½ stars)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, OzMovies Dossier, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n115. Mental (2012) (P.J. Hogan)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 115/650\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nSet in: Fictional Australian coastal suburb of Dolphin Heads (filmed in the Gold Coast and Ballina) in the 2000s\n\nCast: Toni Collette, Liev Schreiber, Anthony LaPaglia, Caroline Goodall, Kerry Fox, Rebecca Gibney, Deborah Mailman, Bethany Whitmore, Sam Clark, Lily Sullivan, Nicole Freeman, Rob Carlton\n\nSynopsis: A non-conformist hitchhiker is hired by a small-town politician as a nanny for his five girls, who all imagine they have mental problems after their mother is sent to an institution.\n\nWhy See This Film: This 2013 follow-up by PJ Hogan to his 1994 Muriel’s Wedding has perhaps too many similarities to his earlier film, but also enough differences to make it enjoyable. Also set in a dysfunctional (‘mental’) family of a domineering Gold Coast politician, this film takes The Sound of Music rather than Abba as its theme. This time Toni Collette plays the outsider who rescues the women of the family from their victimhood, allowing them to revel in their ‘mental-ness’ rather than be disabled by it. This is a real romp, covering familiar territory to Muriel’s Wedding, but in a different way, and with different results.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Muriel’s Wedding, The Dressmaker, Strictly Ballroom, Crackerjack, The Rage in Placid Lake, Holy Smoke, Bliss, Soft Fruit\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile and Margaret and David (4 and 2 ½ stars respectively)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n116. Angel Baby (1995) (Michael Rymer)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 116/650\n\nGenre: Drama/Romance\n\nSet in: Melbourne in the 1990s\n\nCast: Jacqueline McKenzie, John Lynch, Colin Friels, Deborah-Lee Furness, Robin Nevin, David Argue, Humphrey Bower, Geoff Brooks, Daniel Daperis, Samuel Johnson, Alex Pinder\n\nSynopsis: Two schizophrenics meet and fall in love at their mental health group.\n\nWhy See This Film: Angel Baby is a moving insight into the world of schizophrenics, with all the highs and lows. It is also a wonderful portrait of first love and relationships, with all those highs and lows. Jacqueline McKenzie is great as the passionate Kate, a young woman trying to keep the voices in her head at bay. John Lynch is good as Harry, full of love and compassion, and usually more in control of his condition. They make some bad decisions but their love shines through in the end. Colin Friels is alright as Morris, Harry’s supportive brother, though a bit inarticulate at times; Deborah-Lee Furness is better as Morris’s wife. The film won all the major AFI awards in 1995: Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress and Best Actor.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Cosi, Lilian’s Story, Shine, Malcolm\n\nRecommended Reviews: Margaret and David (4 stars from both), Australian Screen, Sheila Variations Review\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies Dossier, Trailer\n\n117. Jasper Jones (2017) (Rachel Perkins)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 117/650\n\nGenre: Drama-mystery\n\nSet in: The fictitious rural town of Corrigan in Western Australia in 1969.\n\nCast: Levi Miller, Aaron McGrath, Angourie Rice, Toni Collette, Hugo Weaving, Dan Wyllie, Matt Nable, Myles Pollard, Susan Prior, Wilson Moore, Gabrielle Chan, Ferdinand Hoang, Cooper van Grootel, Alexandra Jones\n\nSynopsis: A young white boy Charlie, and an older mixed race boy, Jasper Jones, try to investigate the death of Jasper’s white girlfriend.\n\nWhy See This Film: This adaptation of a popular Craig Silvey novel about a young boy in 1969 covers a lot of ground – murder-mystery, racial prejudice in small-town Australia, young love, family secrets, infidelity and community. And it succeeds due to good direction, great cinematography and excellent acting from the child actors as well as some of our best adult actors. If you haven’t read the story, the mystery unfolds engrossingly as young Charlie finds himself pulled this way and that by the other characters in the story: by the young Aboriginal outsider Jasper Jones, whose white girlfriend is found hanging from a tree, by the girl’s sister who is Charlie’s friend, by his best friend, the cricket-mad Chinese/Vietnamese kid who chats non-stop about all manner of ideas, and by Charlie’s demanding mother (Toni Collette in fine form) who is constantly ordering him about. But the movie is best in its depiction of 1960s small town Australia, with its sense of community and suppressed tensions.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Lantana, Beautiful Kate, Proof, Jindabyne, Storm Boy, Beneath Clouds, Satellite Boy, Mystery Road, The Dry, Sweet Country, Rabbit-Proof Fence\n\nRecommended Reviews: Luke Buckmaster (The Guardian), Canberra Film Blog\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n118. Blood Oath (1990) (aka Prisoners of the Sun) (Stephen Wallace)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 118/650\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nSet in: Ambon (Indonesia) in 1945-6.\n\nCast: Bryan Brown, George Takei, Terry O’Quinn, John Bach, Toshi Shioya, John Clarke (actor), Deborah Unger, John Polson, Jason Donovan, Russell Crowe, Nicholas Eadie, Tetsu Watanabe, Sokyu Fujita, Ray Barrett, Kazuhiro Muroyama, David Argue, Yuichiro Senga, Andrew Booth, Malcolm Cork, Donal Gibson\n\nSynopsis: Australian soldiers organise a war crimes trial for the Japanese soldiers who killed the majority of the Australian POWs on the island, but are hampered by a lack of witnesses and documentation.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is an engaging court-drama, rather than another brutal Japanese prison camp film, although there are constant allusions to the massacres, beatings and killings for which the Japanese soldiers are being tried. Brian Brown is very good as the chief prosecutor, trying to convict obviously guilty men, but hampered by the Western court rules on evidence, documentation and witnesses. The fact that most of the witnesses are dead or ill or have already been repatriated to Australia means he must try to prise evidence out of some of the more honest Japanese. There is an excellent cast, with a young Russell Crowe assisting Brown, John Poulson as a slightly deranged prisoner, Ray Barrett as the judge and John Clarke as an Australian reporter conveying news of the trial back to Australia. The Japanese cast are also very impressive, with different soldiers reacting differently to the charges brought against them.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Paradise Road, Sisters of War, A Town Like Alice, Ladies in Black, Newsfront,\n\nRecommended Reviews: Margaret and David (4 and 4½ stars respectively), Urban Cinephile, Ozmovies (Review section)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, Australian Screen, Trailer\n\n119. No Worries (1993) (David Elfick)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 119/650\n\nGenre: Drama/ Family drama\n\nSet in: Gilgandra and Sydney in the 1990s\n\nCast: Amy Terelinck, Geoff Morrell, Susan Lyons, Geraldine James, John Hargreaves, Steven Vidler, Ray Barrett, Harold Hopkins, Annie Byron, Bob Baines, Maureen Green, Fiona Press, Paul Jones, Rhondda Findleton, Simon Westaway, David Holman, Bill Young, Andrew Gilbert, Jacqy Phillips\n\nSynopsis: Matilda is a happy 11-year-old girl living on her parent’s farm in western NSW, but an extended drought drives the family closer to ruin, until she suddenly finds her world swept away, and has to adjust to a totally different life in the city.\n\nWhy See This Film: Drought, unlike fire and flood, is a slow disaster, and one that must be endured with hope and patience. This film is partly about rural life and rural communities, where people struggle individually and collectively to survive the vagaries of the weather. The film is seen through the eyes of 11-year-old Matilda, well played by Amy Terelinck, who is a happy, resourceful kid who loves her parents, her friends at the tiny bush school, and the animals on their farm, especially her dog, Dingo. She knows all the 13 other kids at the school and all of the adults in the neighbourhood. When a dust storm proves the final straw that drives their farm to ruin, Matilda is suddenly uprooted from her rural paradise and taken to live with an uncle and aunt in Sydney, where she is thrown into a new class of mainly migrant and Asian kids and where she doesn’t know anybody. No Worries is both moving and entertaining, and the best film I know of that captures the tragedy and trauma of drought in rural communities. But the film is also about the resilience of the human spirit in the face of tragedy, and people’s ability to get back up and try something new. Geoff Morrell and Susan Lyons are wonderful as Matilda’s parents, and the supporting cast includes John Hargreaves, Steven Vidler, Ray Barrett, Harold Hopkins and many more. Despite the difficult subject, the film, like most of the characters, somehow manages to stay upbeat and hopeful.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Red Dog, Country Town, Storm Boy\n\nRecommended Reviews: Ozmovies (review section) , Margaret and David (4 stars from both)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, ASO (includes clips)\n\n120. Hunt Angels (2006) (Alec Morgan)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 120/650\n\nGenre: Docu-Drama-comedy\n\nSynopsis: The true story of Australian film-makers Rupert Kathner and Alma Brooks whose passionate desire to make Australian films in the 30s, 40s and 50s put them in conflict with the distributors, the police and even the public.\n\nSet in: Adelaide, Sydney, Benalla and Queensland from the 1930s to the 1950s\n\nCast: Ben Mendelsohn, Victoria Hill, Eloise Oxer, Peter Hansen, Greg Poppleton\n\nWhy See This Film: Hunt Angels is more than a documentary, despite occasional interludes from real-life witnesses to the remarkable careers of Rupert Kathner and Alma Brooks. It is a dramatic and sometimes comic and occasionally surreal recreation of their adventures in movie-making. Ben Mendelsohn is electric as the passionate would-be director, constantly trying new angles to get his films made, and Victoria Hill brings a cheeky swagger to his partner-in-art, business and crime. Director Morgan beautifully and often surreally mixes archive film and photography with his own black-and-white film to capture this lost era of Australia, giving the film a certain noir-ish feel. He also uses our remaining 30s architecture for his action pieces, adding to the overall authenticity. But the story is the gripping thing, of man with a passion up against the big film distribution companies who preferred to buy films en masse from Hollywood rather than support Australian films. This film helps explain the collapse of our native film industry in the 1930s and 40s, and the subsequent drought in Aussie film-making until the 1970s. It’s not only a beautiful and entertaining film about this Bonnie and Clyde couple of film enthusiasts, but a lesson in a little-known part of our cultural history.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Newsfront, The Picture Show Man, The Glenrowan Affair (Kathner film on Ozflix)\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (3 and 4 stars respectively)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n121. One Night the Moon (2001) (Rachel Perkins)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 121/650\n\nGenre: Musical Drama\n\nSet in: The Flinders Ranges, South Australia in 1932\n\nCast: Paul Kelly, Kaarin Fairfax, Kelton Pell, David Field, Chris Haywood, Ruby Hunter, Memphis Kelly\n\nSynopsis: A little girl gets lost one night in the bush chasing the moon. Her father organises a search party but will not have the Aboriginal tracker on his land.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a poetic song of a film, as mythic as Picnic at Hanging Rock or Walkabout, about the disappearance of a child bewitched by the moon, and the anguished searching of his parents. It’s also about racism and the different attitudes to belonging in the beautiful but harsh outback. With haunting music and songs by Australian musical legends Paul Kelly (who also plays the father, singing as he searches) and Kev Carmody as well as Mairead Hannan, this is an unusual and satisfying experience. At under 60 minutes, it does really not qualify as a feature film, but it did play at cinemas in Australia, so I’m including it in my list.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Picnic at Hanging Rock, Walkabout, Beneath Clouds, Japanese Story, The Tracker, That Eye The Sky, Looking For Grace\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (3½ and 4½ stars respectively), Down Under Flix\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Australian Screen Online, Ozmovies, Wikipedia, Full Film\n\n122. South Solitary (2010) (Shirley Barrett)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 122/650\n\nGenre: Drama/Romance\n\nSet in: South Solitary Island, NSW in the 1920s\n\nCast: Miranda Otto, Marton Csokas, Rohan Nichol, Essie Davis, Barry Otto, Annie Martin\n\nSynopsis: A disgraced young woman accompanies her lighthouse-keeper uncle to an isolated windswept island, throwing the island’s few inhabitants out of their equilibrium.\n\nWhy See This Film: Miranda Otto both sparkles and annoys as a somewhat dreamy young woman whose life choices in post-WW1 Australia are limited by the scarcity of young men after the war, by her impoverished situation and by her past mistakes. The film’s pace is slow and poetic, and some have complained that too little happens. But romance and tragedy approach as quickly as the next gale.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Love Serenade, Danny Deckchair, Dead Letter Office, Daydream Believer\n\nRecommended Reviews: Margaret and David (3 and 4 stars respectively), Urban Cinephile\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n123.

The film switches back and forward in time, between the experiences of the five journalists, of Roger East’s search for them and the 2007 enquiry into the killings. This device bothered some reviewers, but I think it allowed the film-makers to tell both the story of the Balibo Five and Roger East at the same time and have both stories climax towards the end of the film. Anthony LaPaglia is excellent as Roger East, and won the AFI Best Actor award for his performance.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: The Year of Living Dangerously, Breaker Morant, Danger Close: The Battle of Long Tan, Wish You Were Here, Ground Zero\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 and 3½ stars respectively), Luke Buckmaster (Guardian 2015), Richard Kuipers (Australian Screen)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Australian Screen Online, Ozflix (Film streaming),Trailer\n\n124. What I Have Written (1996) (John Hughes)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 124/650\n\nGenre: Arthouse Drama\n\nSet in: Paris and Melbourne in the 1990s\n\nCast: Martin Jacobs, Gillian Jones, Jacek Koman, Angie Milliken, Margaret Cameron, Nicholas Lathouris, Fiona Stewart, Julie Forsyth, Bronwyn Gault, Libby Stone, Ian Scott, Jillian Murray, Daniel Witton, Terry Kenwrick, John Flaus, Sarah Stollman\n\nSynopsis: An Australian academic novelist-poet and his wife stay for a while in Paris, mixing with the artistic set there. The poet meets a mysterious older woman just before he returns to Melbourne, and they begin an erotic correspondence together. When the poet is hospitalised, his wife becomes aware of the correspondence through an academic friend.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is an inventive, intriguing piece of arthouse cinema, backed up by a strong narrative, about an unfaithful husband trying again, a suspicious wife, an unreliable colleague and a femme fatale far away in France. The film-maker mixes black-and-white stills of the action, with normal action in colour, and overlays segments of the film with the writer’s poetry and prose, as well as showing fictional scenes alongside real scenes. The four main actors: Martin Jacobs, Angie Milliken, Gillian Jones, and Jacek Koman, sometimes play the real characters, and at other times fictional characters based loosely on themselves. In other words there is fiction inside fiction. It’s all done so well, evoking the feelings of desire and betrayal. But the twists of the story make it especially satisfying, as the writer finds his own life fictionalised by another. Reminiscent of Paul Cox’s films, especially Man of Flowers.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Man of Flowers, Careful He Might Hear You, Golden Braid, Innocence, Lantana, Babyteeth, Bliss, Beautiful Kate, Proof, Phobia, Silver City\n\nRecommended Reviews: Ozmovies (Review section), Margaret and David (4 stars from both)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, Australian Screen, Trailer\n\n125. Little Fish (2005) (Rowan Woods)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 125/650\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nSet in: Sydney’s western suburbs (Cabramatta & Fairfield) in the 2000s\n\nCast: Cate Blanchett, Sam Neill, Hugo Weaving, Martin Henderson, Noni Hazlehurst, Dustin Nguyen, Anh Do, Lisa McCune, John Nguyen, Susie Porter, Rachel Aveling,\n\nSynopsis: Tracy, a former junkee is trying to go straight and help her family and friends, despite the odds stacked against her.\n\nWhy See This Film: Superb acting by Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving marks this downbeat film about junkies and ex-junkies in western Sydney’s blue-collar belt. It’s an acutely observed account of the uneven struggles of family members to break free of drug habits and make ends meet in a depressing situation and uninspiring environment.

This film travels similar territory to Lantana, searching for a young woman’s killer, and involving conflicts within four previously happy families. Though it’s not as successful as Lantana, there is still much to admire about this tense drama of guilt and suspicion.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Lantana, Beautiful Kate, Jindabyne, Mystery Road, The Dry, The Square, Unfinished Sky\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 and 4½ stars respectively), Paul Byrnes (Australian Screen)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Australian Screen Online, Film streaming on Ozflix, Trailer\n\n127. Crackers (1998) (David Swann)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 127/650\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nSet in: Melbourne and Port Phillip in the 90s.\n\nCast: Warren Mitchell, Peter Rowsthorn, Susan Lyons, Daniel Kellie, Terry Gill, Maggie King, Valerie Bader, Christopher Chapman, Louise Siversen, Graham Jahne\n\nSynopsis: A 12-year-old boy spends Christmas at his grandparents with an odd assortment of relatives and hanger-oners.\n\nWhy See This Film: An out-and-out comedy in the vein of The Castle, this 1998 film documents a young boy’s Christmas with his extended family at his grandparents. Lots of slapstick, fart jokes, out of control animals, randy relatives and family friction make this a wild ride along the borders of good taste (and not everyone will enjoy it as much as I did). Even David Stratton (he who gave The Castle only 1½ stars) found it funny! Though most of the actors are little-known, apart from England’s Warren Mitchell as the Scottish great-grandfather, the acting is great.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Crackerjack, The Castle, The Rage in Placid Lake, Strange Bedfellows, Muriel’s Wedding, Bad Eggs, Around the World in Eighty Ways, Dimboola\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 stars from both), Down Under Flix\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Oz Movies Dossier, Film on YouTube\n\n128. Puberty Blues (1981) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 128/650\n\nGenre: Coming-of-AgeDrama\n\nSet in: Cronulla Beach (Sydney) in the 1970s\n\nCast: Nell Schofield, Jad Capelja, Geoff Rhoe, Tony Hughes, Sandy Paul, Leander Brett, Joanne Olsen, Julie Medana, Jay Hackett, Ned Lander, Michael Shearman, Dean Dunstone, Tina Robinson, Nerida Clark, Kirrily Nolan, Alan Cassell, Rowena Wallace, Charles Tingwell\n\nSynopsis: Two schoolgirls learn about life when they are accepted into a gang of surfie-chicks, who are groupies for local surfies.\n\nWhy See This Film: This film is based on a best-selling 1979 book of the same name by Cathy Lette and Gabrielle Carey, which documented the position of young teenage schoolgirls involved in Sydney’s surfing culture. Lette and Carey’s book caused controversy in the late 70’s, for its depiction of underage sex and drugs, but was also important for its humorous feminism, as it revealed the oppression of girls in the macho-surf culture of Sydney. Whereas boys got to enjoy the thrills and camaraderie of surfing, their girlfriends were given subservient roles, and expected to be feminine, to defer to the boys, to buy food for them and be available for unsatisfactory sex. This film captures the atmosphere of the era, but lacks some of the humour and satire which made the book so popular. Nevertheless, the main characters are very likeable and the film does show the poor situation of the schoolgirls, as well as make the strong points about sexism in Australia and the need for equality for girls. The film shows the dangers of rape, pregnancy and bullying that girls faced in those days. The story has more recently been the subject of a TV series which was well-received.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Somersault, Candy, Caterpillar Wish, Looking for Alibrandi, The Year My Voice Broke, Flirting\n\nRecommended Reviews: Ozmovies dossier, Paul Byrnes (ScreenAustralia)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb,Wikipedia, Ozmovies dossier, Australian Screen, Trailer\n\n129. The Square (2008) (Nash Edgerton)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 129/650\n\nGenre: Crime Drama/Thriller\n\nSet in: A working-class area on the fringes of Sydney in the 2000s\n\nCast: David Roberts, Claire van der Boom, Joel Edgerton, Anthony Hayes, Lucy Bell, Paul Caesar\n\nSynopsis: Two married people involved in an affair plan to run away together, but need to collect some dirty cash to finance their escape.\n\nWhy See This Film: A well-told 2008 thriller of how a man’s life spins out of control due to his lies, deceit and greed. Set in the leafy working-class fibro outskirts of Sydney – home of battlers, tradesmen and shonky deals – the story starts with an affair between Raymond, a 40-something married construction manager, and Carla, a 20-something married hairdresser, and ends with various deaths, both accidental and intentional (if misguided), as deceit reaps its own reward. David Roberts, as Raymond, is great as the ever-worried philanderer whose plans constantly fall apart, and Claire van der Boom (sic) is pretty and good as the scheming unfaithful wife, keen to leave her boofy husband for the middle-class Raymond.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: The Hard Word, Money Movers, Two Hands, The Empty Beach, Dirty Deeds, Gettin’ Square, Chopper, Proof, The Square, Mystery Road\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (3 and 3½ stars respectively), Lynden Barber (ScreenAustralia)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Australian Screen Online, Film on Ozflix, Trailer\n\n130.

Small children will love this film, and there’s enough laughs for adults to endure this fairy-tale of ambition and acceptance. The fact that it was written and produced by Dr George “Mad Max” Miller was a surprise to everyone, but George Miller has always been a great entertainer.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Babe: Pig in the City, Happy Feet, Storm Boy, Red Dog, Oddball, Paper Planes\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4½ stars from both), Luke Buckmaster (Guardian 2015), Paul Byrnes (Australian Screen)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies Dossier, Australian Screen Online, Trailer\n\n131. The Shiralee (1957) (Leslie Norman)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 131/650\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nSet in: Rural NSW and Sydney in the 1950s\n\nCast: Peter Finch, Dana Wilson, Elizabeth Sellars, George Rose, Rosemary Harris, Russell Napier, Niall Macginnis, Tessie O’Shea, Sidney James, Charles Tingwell, Reginald Lye, Barbara Archer, Alec Mango, John Phillips, Bruce Beeby, John Cazabon, Edward Devereaux, Guy Doleman, Fred Goddard, Frank Leighton, Henry Murdoch, Lou Vernon, Lloyd Berrell, Mark Daly, Bettina Dickson, Gordon Glenwright, Clifford Hunter, Betty McDowall, Frank Raynor, David Williams, Chin Yu\n\nSynopsis: A swagman/itinerant rural worker chooses to travel with his 7-year-old daughter in country NSW while seeking work to survive.\n\nWhy See This Film: Peter Finch shows what a good actor he is in this story of parenthood from D’Arcy Niland’s novel. He is both charming and infuriating as the freedom-loving father and husband who takes his daughter on the road with him after he discovers his wife’s infidelity on one of his rare visits to his Sydney home. The countryside looks gloriously expansive, filmed in crisp sunlit black and white, and the story flows much better than most Australian films of those years, and even better than most British films of the era, since this is at heart a British production. While most of the main actors are British, Finch and a few other Aussies give this film a more authentic feel than some other British or American films made in Australia after WW2.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: A Town Like Alice, The Overlanders, The Sundowners, Robbery Under Arms, Sunday Too Far Away, Summer of the Seventeenth Doll\n\nRecommended Reviews: Paul Byrnes (ScreenAustralia), Hal Astell\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies dossier, Australian Screen Online, Video Review\n\n132. Mad Dog Morgan (1976) (Philippe Mora)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 132/650\n\nGenre: Bushranger drama\n\nSet in: Victoria and NSW in the 1860s\n\nCast: Dennis Hopper, Jack Thompson, David Gulpilil, Frank Thring, Michael Pate, Wallas Eaton, Bill Hunter, John Hargreaves, Martin Harris, Robin Ramsay, Graeme Blundell, Gregory Apps, Liddy Clark, Peter Collingwood, Peter Cummins, John Derum, Gerry Duggan, Max Fairchild, Norman Kaye, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Robert McDarra, Christopher Pate, Grant Page, Bruce Spence, Roger Ward\n\nSynopsis: Dan Morgan young Irishman, with a kind heart and a fiery temper, takes up bushranging after brutal treatment by the authorities, and successfully evades police attempts to capture him, for a time.\n\nWhy See This Film: Director Mora portrays Morgan as a polite humane man living in a violent, unfair society which mistreats its most disadvantaged citizens. A young, slender Dennis Hopper is a revelation as Morgan, and David Gulpilil is excellent yet again as his Aboriginal offsider. The film covers a lot of issues from the anti-Chinese riots on the goldfields, to sadism and buggery inflicted on convicts, to the class system of colonial Australia, to discrimination against the Aboriginal population, to the corruption of the government who wanted harsh sentencing to increase the pool of free labour for infrastructure development. But it also works as an entertaining story, based around a sympathetic rebel trying to live in his own way. The film was less violent than I’d feared, and better structured. It’s probably our best bushranger flick.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Ned Kelly (2003), True History of the Kelly Gang, Robbery Under Arms (1957), Robbery Under Arms (1986), The Proposition, The Outlaw Michael Howe, The Legend of Ben Hall\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Luke Buckmaster (Guardian 2014), Paul Byrnes (ScreenAustralia), DVD Talk\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies dossier, Australian Screen Online, Trailer\n\n133. Patrick (1978) (Richard Franklin)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 133/650\n\nGenre: Supernatural thriller\n\nSet in: Melbourne in the 1970s\n\nCast: Susan Penhaligon, Robert Helpmann, Robert Thompson, Rod Mullinar, Bruce Barry, Julia Blake, Helen Hemingway, Maria Mercedes, Walter Pym, Frank Wilson, Carole-Ann Aylett, Paul Young, Marilyn Rodgers, Peggy Nichols, John Murphy, Ray Chubb, Everett de Roche\n\nSynopsis: Nurse Kathy Jacquard gets a job at a private hospital, and is assigned to watch over Patrick, an apparently comatose young man, who has secretly developed the power of telekinesis – the supposed ability to move objects at a distance by mental power or other non-physical means.\n\nWhy See This Film: This supernatural thriller, about an apparently comatose young man with the power of telekinesis in a Melbourne private clinic, is surprisingly good, especially for a viewer who doesn’t normally like such things. Director Richard Franklin was a fan of Alfred Hitchcock, and there are a lot of Hitchcockian features in this film: the use of suspense, the visual and verbal jokes scattered throughout the film, the blonde heroine, the use of close shots in the corridors and on the stairs, the odd support characters, and the strong narrative building to a climax. The film looks great, and the cinematography resembles Hitchcock’s colour films of the 1950s and 1960s. English actress, Susan Penhaligon, is superb as the new nurse, who starts to suspect that Patrick is still conscious. Robert Helpmann and Julia Blake are creepy as the arrogant doctor and matron who run the hospital, and Rod Mullinar and Bruce Barry play Jacquard’s ex-husband and doctor/boyfriend respectively, who try to help Jacquard discover the truth. It’s a very entertaining, well-made film with just the right amount of suspense to keep you involved until the end.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Bad Boy Bubby, Roadgames, Alexandra’s Project, Siam Sunset, Metal Skin, Little Monsters, The Night, the Prowler, The Adventures of Barry McKenzie, Sweetie,\n\nRecommended Reviews: Ozmovies (Review section)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, Australian Screen, Trailer\n\n134. Holy Smoke (1999) (Jane Campion)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 134/650\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nSet in: Sydney, the Outback and India in the 90s\n\nCast: Kate Winslet, Harvey Keitel, Julie Hamilton, Sophie Lee, Paul Goddard, Kerry Walker, Tim Rogers, Daniel Wyllie, Austen Tashus, Pam Grier,\n\nSynopsis: A young woman who joins a cult in India, is tricked into returning to Australia by her family who send her to be ‘deprogrammed’ by an American expert in the isolated Australian outback.\n\nWhy See This Film: Some might find this film too strange, but strange is normal for director Jane Campion who likes to push her characters to their limits. Not everyone liked the mood-shifts in this erotic psycho-drama about power relations in cult-deprogramming, mixed with moments which parody a variant of Ocker culture, but I did. After a strong beginning in India and hilarious attack on suburbia in Sydney’s Sans Souci, the film becomes an emotional tussle between hyper-American deprogrammer, Harvey Keitel, and initially serene Aussie backpacker, Kate Winslett, with bizarre interruptions by Winslett’s average-Aussie, know-nothing family. Kate Winslet is excellent as the headstrong Aussie girl who is more than a match for the American expert. Campion pushes the drama to resolution through total destruction (as usual).\n\nIf you liked this film, try: The Piano (NZ film by Campion), Beautiful Kate, Proof, The Interview, The Dressmaker (Winslet’s other Australian film), Love Serenade\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 and 5 stars respectively), Richard Kuipers (Australian Screen)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies Dossier, Australian Screen Online, Trailer\n\n135.

The film is sweet romance between two shy people, both set in their ways and held back by the expectations of friends and family. It’s a beautifully understated film, with delightful performances by Wendy Hughes (who somehow managed to look dowdy for a while) and Norman Kaye, who did his best work with Cox. The films won the 1982 AFI Best Film Award, and Cox, Hughes, Kaye and Clarke were all nominated for awards.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Man of Flowers, Innocence, A Womans Tale, Cactus, Golden Braid, My First Wife, What I Have Written, Malcolm, Angel Baby, Flirting, Death in Brunswick, Dead Letter Office\n\nRecommended Reviews: Luke Buckmaster (Guardian 2015), Paul Byrnes (Australian Screen), Urban Cinephile\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, OzMovies dossier, Australian Screen Online, Trailer\n\n136. The Sundowners (1960) (Fred Zinnemann)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 136/650\n\nGenre: Period Drama\n\nSet in: Rural NSW in the 1920s\n\nCast: Deborah Kerr, Robert Mitchum, Peter Ustinov, Glynis Johns, Dina Merrill, Chips Rafferty, Michael Anderson Jr., Lola Brooks, Wylie Watson, John Meillon, Ronald Fraser, Gerry Duggan, Leonard Teale, Peter Carver, Dick Bentley, Mervyn Johns, Molly Urquhart, Ewen Solon, Max Osbiston, Mercia Barden\n\nSynopsis: An itinerant rural worker and drover travels the outback of Australia with his wife and teenage son, who both dream of a settled life.\n\nWhy See This Film: This American production, directed by US director Fred Zimmerman, and starring US and UK stars in its leading roles, does a good job of capturing rural Australia before WW2. Based on a popular novel by Australian writer Jon Clarey, the film follows Paddy Carmody (played by Robert Mitchum who manages a believable Aussie accent), a rugged individual with a love of travelling, and an ability to turn his hand to droving, shearing and other tough rural occupations. Deborah Kerr plays his long-suffering wife, Ida, with gusto, as she stands by him while trying to tempt him into becoming a settled man. Unlike Mitchum, her accent veers between cockney and strine, but she’s good anyway. Peter Ustinov avoids the accent problem by playing an educated Englishman adrift in the outback, living off his wits and the various women he charms with his witty repartee. The three, plus young UK actor Michael Anderson Jr as the son, make as strong team as they drove sheep, escape bushfires, go shearing, race horses, play two-up and enjoy outback pub life throughout the film. It’s an attractive film, replete with lots of well-filmed shots of our birdlife (corellas, galahs, emus and kookaburras), wildlife (kolas, kangaroos and wombats) and sheep (jumping, surging, being herded and being shorn), and a story which moves along, Hollywood-style. There are a few Aussie actors in support roles, notably John Meillon as a young shearer and Chips Rafferty as a foreman. It’s enjoyable and better acted and written than some of the foreign productions in Australia of the 40s and 50s.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: The The Overlanders, Sunday Too Far Away, The Man From Snowy River, The Shiralee, Summer of the Seventeenth Doll\n\nRecommended Reviews: Adrian Danks (Screening the Past),Paul Byrnes (ScreenAustralia), NYT (1960)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies dossier, Australian Screen Online, Trailer\n\n137. Gettin’ Square (2003) (Jonathan Teplitzky)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 137/650\n\nGenre: Crime-Comedy\n\nSet in: The Gold Coast in the 2000s\n\nCast: Sam Worthington, David Wenham, Timothy Spall, Gary Sweet, David Field, Freya Stafford, Luke Pegler, David Roberts, Richard Carter, John Brumpton, Joe Bugner, Ugly Dave Gray\n\nSynopsis: A young man is released from jail and tries to go straight, but his ex-colleagues and enemies make it hard to stay on the straight path.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a very funny, well-written comedy about minor criminals, bent cops, social misfits, and a hero trying to escape the criminal world. The entire cast is strong: Sam Worthington, in one of his early roles, plays the young man who has already served time in prison for a murder he didn’t commit, and who struggles to avoid his old criminal connections, Gary Sweet plays one of his early bad-guy roles after years of being a hero, British actor Timothy Spall seems quite at home in the sunny Gold Coast underworld, and David Wenham steals the show as an accident-prone heroin-addict mate of Worthington’s. The film was nominated for 14 AFI awards, and Wenham won the Best Supporting Actor award for his unforgettable performance.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: The Hard Word, Money Movers, Two Hands, The Empty Beach, Dirty Deeds, Chopper, Roadgames\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 and 4½ stars respectively), Luke Buckmaster (Guardian 2015), Paul Byrnes (Australian Screen)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, Australian Screen Online, Trailer\n\n138.

It’s a gritty but amiable observation of some poor Aussie suburbs and the characters that survive there. There is a sense of unease, but the cop’s not sure if he’s getting close to the criminals or if the tinitus is driving him crazy. Brendan Cowell is excellent as the laconic ‘every-cop’, trying to deal with his girlfriend, his condition and his job. It’s a beautifully filmed piece, slow but satisfying.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Lantana, Beneath Hill 60, Beautiful Kate, Jindabyne, Mystery Road, The Dry, Unfinished Sky, The Hunter\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4½ stars and 4 respectively), Luke Buckmaster (Guardian 2015), Paul Byrnes (ScreenAustralia)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Australian Screen Online, Film streamed on Ozflix, Trailer\n\n139. Swimming Upstream (2003) (Russell Mulcahy)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 139/650\n\nGenre: Period drama/Biopic\n\nSet in: Brisbane in the 1950s\n\nCast: Geoffrey Rush, Judy Davis, Jesse Spencer, Tim Draxl, David Hoflin, Craig Horner, Brittany Byrnes\n\nSynopsis: A young man is driven to become a swimming champion to gain the respect of his father who favours one of his brothers.\n\nWhy See This Film: Based on the childhood of swimming champion Tony Fingleton, this is an engaging story of family dynamics, of a working-class father who drinks too much and believes sons should be pitted against each other to become strong, of a mother who has the strength to keep the family together and who shows the sons the love they need, and of children who learn to be themselves against the background of their parents’ desires. Geoffrey Rush is superb as the overbearing father doing what he feels is best for his kids, but not listening to them or his wife; Judy Davis is good as the sometimes-battered wife whose resilience keeps the family going; and Jesse Spencer is also great as the son trying to win his father’s respect and who incidentally becomes a swimming champion. This is a strong, beautifully realised drama.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Romulus, My Father, The Home Song Stories, Careful He Might Hear You, Caterpillar Wish, The Boys are Back, Oranges and Sunshine, Barracuda (TV mini-series)\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 and 3½ stars respectively),\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n140.

The film finds the bookish teenager Danny three years later at a boys boarding school in Bathurst, where he meets Thandiwe, the daughter of a Ugandan diplomat, at a debating contest against the nearby girls school. Noah Taylor does a fine job again as Danny, and the film features British/Zimbabwean actress Thandie Newton as Thandiwe, and Nicole Kidman as a school prefect, as well as Naomi Watts as a schoolgirl. The film won the 1990 AFI award for best film, and along with The Year My Voice Broke is one of prolific director John Duigan’s best.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: The Year My Voice Broke, Flirting, The Nostradamus Kid, The Big Steal, Looking for Alibrandi, The Heartbreak Kid, He Died with a Falafel in His Hand, September\n\nRecommended Reviews: Margaret and David (5 and 4½ stars respectively), Cinephilia, Lynden Barber (Australian Screen)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Australian Screen Online, OzMovies dossier, Trailer\n\n141. Roadgames (1981) (Richard Franklin)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 141/650\n\nGenre: Thriller/Road Movie\n\nSet in: Melbourne to Perth in the early 80s\n\nCast: Stacy Keach, Jamie Lee Curtis, Marion Edward, Grant Page, Thaddeus Smith, Stephen Millichamp, Alan Hopgood, John Murphy, Bill Stacey, Robert Thompson, Ed Turley, Angie La Bozzetta, Colin Vancao, Carole-Ann Aylett\n\nSynopsis: A truck driver driving from Melbourne to Perth with a female hitchhiker suspects that another car he keeps seeing is driven by a killer.\n\nWhy See This Film: This 1981 ‘thriller with a sense of humour’ about a truck driver with a load of frozen meat following a van whose owner the truckie suspects is a serial killer, was made by Aussie Hitchcock fan Richard Franklin, and it’s an interesting and entertaining genre piece. True to Hitchcock’s method, it’s not too graphic in its violence, and the tension is interlaced with the truckie’s dry humour and the odd collection of individuals he encounters crossing the Nullabor Plain. Franklin chose minor US actors Stacy Keach and Jamie Lee Curtis (in one of her early roles) as the lead actors, but they do a good job as strangers in a strange land. (The director, writers and supporting actors are all Australian). This was enjoyable despite the fact that I don’t really like thrillers, especially not about serial killers.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Kiss or Kill, Looking For Grace, The Dry, True Love and Chaos, Doing Time For Patsy Cline, Mad Max, Heaven’s Burning\n\nRecommended Reviews: Cinephilia, Luke Buckmaster (Guardian 2014)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies dossier, Trailer\n\n142.

When their money runs out, they decide to rob a bank, despite their lack of any know-how.\n\nWhy See This Film: David Caesar knows about the Australian working class and underclass, and has created a very convincing picture of life for two young larrikins, who have no skills, no money and no motivation to work. There only ambitions are to have fun and get chicks. Kev (Ben Mendelsohn) is the angrier of the two and constantly takes risks for the thrills; Mick (Jeremy Sims) sometimes goes along with Kev’s crazy ideas, but sometimes acts as a restraining influence. When Kev gets the idea that robbing a bank will solve all their money problems, their life of idiotic pranks threatens to spin out of control.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Mullet, Two Hands, Dirty Deeds, Gettin’ Square, Greenkeeping, Prime Mover, The Boys, Praise\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 and 5 stars respectively)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, Australian Screen, Trailer\n\n143. Heatwave (1982) (Phil Noyce)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 143/650\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nSet in: Sydney in the late 1970s\n\nCast: Judy Davis, Richard Moir, Chris Haywood, Bill Hunter, John Gregg, Anna Jemison, John Meillon, Dennis Miller, Peter Hehir, Carole Skinner, Gillian Jones, Frank Gallacher, Tui Bow, Don Crosby, Lynette Curran, Graham Rouse, Paul Chubb, Vic Rooney, Gary Waddell, Alastair Duncan, Mercia Deane-Johns, Peter Williams, Robyn Moase, Kerry McGuire, Bill McCluskey, Margo Lee\n\nSynopsis: When a developer uses strong-arm tactics to take over terrace-houses in inner-city Sydney for a large high-rise housing development, a young woman tries to organise resistance, and the architect on the project finds himself caught in the middle.\n\nWhy See This Film: This film is based on the true story of Juanita Neilson, an activist who tried to stop the destruction and redevelopment of streets in Kings Cross, an inner-city suburb of Sydney in the mid-1970s, and who disappeared mysteriously. The film changes some details but keeps many elements of the true story, such as the involvement of sleazy underworld figures from the Cross, corrupt police, thugs violently evicting residents and squatters, the green bans by building unions and subsequent rise of rival, business-friendly building unions, and tricky deals by developers to maximise their profits. The film has a strong narrative and captures the feeling of the era, when protest, idealism and direct-action was common. Judy Davis is excellent, as usual, as Kate, the Juanita Neilson character, and Richard Moir is also wonderful as the young architect, hoping to get his beautiful ecological building constructed, but increasingly feeling conflicted about the developer’s methods. As someone who lived in Sydney at the time, it’s a delight to see areas I am familiar with, and sobering to realise that wholesale destruction and redevelopment of countless suburbs of Sydney has occurred since 2000 with barely a whimper of protest.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: The Killing of Angel Street, Winter of Our Dreams, Newsfront, The Removalists, In Search of Anna, Vacant Possession, High Tide, Monkey Grip\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Paul Byrnes (Australian Screen)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Oz Movies Dossier, Australian Screen Online, Trailer\n\n144. Praise (1998) (John Curran)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 144/650\n\nGenre: Drama/romance\n\nSet in: Queensland in the 1980s\n\nCast: Peter Fenton, Sacha Horler, Joel Edgerton, Yvette Duncan, Marta Dusseldorp\n\nSynopsis: A aimless young asthmatic who drinks and smokes too much, meets a vibrant young woman with a skin-condition and insatiable libido, who shares his interests in drinking and smoking, and they try to construct a relationship for several months.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a challenging film with lots of explicit sex and a couple of individuals with some very unattractive characteristics and a lack of conventional ambition to better their lives of lazy poverty. But there is also a truth in the way their relate to each other, and moments of kindness in their lives of self-indulgence. Peter Fenton is more famous as a rock musician, but here he plays a lazy loser with a certain charm and charisma. Sacha Horler bravely plays a loud, abrasive and needy young woman, who falls in love with Fenton’s character’s uncritical inertia. The film is at times funny, at times repellent and at times poetic, in its unflinching portrait of a relationship between two flawed young people. Music by The Dirty Three and other musicians enhances the moody atmosphere. Not a film for everyone, but with a lot of insight into a section of Australian society.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Dogs in Space, He Died with a Felafel in His Hand, Kiss or Kill, Looking For Grace, The Dry, True Love and Chaos, Doing Time For Patsy Cline, Mad Max, Heaven’s Burning, Love Serenade\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4½ stars from both), Paul Byrnes (ScreenAustralia)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Ozmovies Dossier, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n145. Innocence (2000) (Paul Cox)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 145/650\n\nGenre: Drama/Romance\n\nSet in: Adelaide in the 1990s and Belgium in the 1940s\n\nCast: Julia Blake, Charles Tingwell, Terry Norris, Robert Menzies, Marta Dusseldorp, Chris Hayward, Norman Kaye, Joey Kennedy, Liz Windsor\n\nSynopsis: An old man and woman meet again in Adelaide, 50 years after their passionate youthful affairs, and renew their old relationship, despite the woman still being married.\n\nWhy See This Film: Paul Cox is the most European of Australian directors, and this story of love reblooming is one of his best films. Julia Blake shines as Claire, a woman who has had a reasonably happy marriage, but who has never recaptured the passion of her youthful affair with Andreas in Belgium after the war. Likewise Charles Tingwell is very likeable as the musician Andreas, who lost his wife in an accident many years ago, and has decided to recontact the woman he should have married many years before. As their relationship moves from nostalgia to something more intense, Claire must confront her bemused husband (Terry Norris). It’s a positive depiction of a new love that’s possible, even as your life nears its end. The film won a number of awards for both Paul Cox and Julia Blake.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Lonely Hearts, Travelling North, A Woman’s Tale, Man of Flowers, Cactus, Golden Braid, My First Wife, What I Have Written, Dead Letter Office\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 stars from both)\n\nFurther information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, M&D, ASO], Trailer\n\n146. Radiance (1998) (Rachel Perkins)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 146/650\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nSet in: Near Bundaberg, Queensland in the 1990s\n\nCast: Rachael Maza, Deborah Mailman, Trisha Morton-Thomas\n\nSynopsis: Three Aboriginal half-sisters come together for their mother’s funeral, and try to deal with their past.\n\nWhy See This Film: This film adapts Louis Nowra’s play, and is a beautiful three-parter, where three long separated sisters come back together to bury their mother, to share hidden secrets, to accuse, to forgive and to celebrate together after so long. This is a warm and engaging debut feature from one of our best Aboriginal directors, Rachel Perkins, and also marked the film debut of Deborah Mailman, who went on to become Australia’s most successful and beloved Aboriginal actress.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: The Sapphires, Radiance, Beneath Clouds, One Night the Moon, The Fringe Dwellers, Top End Wedding, Beneath Clouds, Soft Fruit, Hotel Sorrento, Brilliant Lies, The Last Days of Chez Nous\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 and 2½ stars respectively)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Australian Screen Online, Oz Movies Dossier, Trailer\n\n147. The Man From Hong Kong (1975) (Brian Trenchard-Smith, Yu Wang)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 147/650\n\nGenre: Action/Kung Fu Comedy\n\nSynopsis: When Aussie cops capture a Hong Kong drug smuggler on the top of Uluru, Hong Kong Police Inspector Fang Sing Leng comes to Sydney to take him back, only to wind up fighting the Mr Big of Aussie crime and sampling the local blondes.\n\nSet in: Hong Kong and Sydney in the 1970s\n\nCast: Jimmy Wang Yu, George Lazenby, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Roger Ward, Frank Thring, Ros Spiers, Rebecca Gilling, Grant Page, Deryck Barnes, Hung Kam Po, Bill Hunter, Ian Jamieson\n\nWhy See This Film: This is an entertaining and amusing action flick, a rare bird in Australia. The dialogue ranges from corny to cheesy, but there are plenty of great action scenes and it’s a good, simple cop story well told. This film has our best car-chase scenes before Mad Max and is probably the link between The Cars That Ate Paris and the Mad Max series. Highlights of this film include a chase and a fight on the top of Uluru (or Ayres Rock as it then was), an extended car chase with multiple wrecks and explosions, wonderful hang-gliding footage over both Hong Kong and Sydney (interestingly showing the brown haze that used to hang over the city in those old leaded-petrol days), a fight with one man on fire, an exploding building, and numerous interminable kung-fu fights, where Inspector Fang whips multiple butts, complete with hilarious sound-effects. The director ensures that during the fights, nothing in the room is left unbroken and strewn across the floor, though it was a shame to see all those lobsters hitting the deck.\n\nFang is one tough Chinese cookie, bleeding from multiple injuries one moment and going horse-riding with a blond Aussie girl the next, before jumping into bed for some inter-cultural relations. The photography should be also mentioned as, despite the low budget, this film looks great and captures Sydney in the 70s with its streetscapes (including Taylor Square and Oxford St, Paddington, Sydney harbourside, Narrabeen beach and Terry Hills), cars and fashion. Add to this the director’s sense of visual humour and this film holds up pretty well.\n\nBesides Jimmy Wang Yu, who was a Hong Kong kung-fu ‘chop socky’ film star before Bruce Lee, the film includes Australia’s James Bond, George Lazenby, as the villain, and future Mad Max actors Hugh Keays-Byrne and Roger Ward playing the Aussie ‘good cop-bad cop’ team, plus a cameo from a skinny Bill Hunter.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Mad Max, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, Mad Max: Fury Road, The Cars That Ate Paris, Metal Skin, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, Stone, Roadgames, Mystery Road\n\nRecommended Reviews: Luke Buckmaster (Guardian 2016), Paul Byrnes (ScreenAustralia), Brian Trenchard-Smith (Trailers From Hell)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies dossier, Trailer\n\n148. He Died with a Felafel in His Hand (2001) (Richard Lowenstein)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 148/650\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nSet in: Brisbane. Melbourne and Sydney in the 1990s\n\nCast: Noah Taylor, Emily Hamilton, Romane Bohringer, Sophie Lee, Alex Menglet, Brett Stewart, Damian Walshe-Howling, Francis McMahon, Ian Hughes, Torquil Neilson, Tim Robertson, Linal Haft, Skye Wansey, Robert Morgan, Scott Major, Haskel Daniels, Clayton Jacobson, Nathan Kotzur, Steve Bastoni, Terry Serio, Sayuri Tanoue, Robert Rimmer\n\nSynopsis: Danny, a young aspiring writer, lives in a succession of share houses with a wide variety of odd young people.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a very funny window into the lives of groups of young Aussie, share-house dwellers, with all their tribal communality, desire for fun and sex, laziness, inventiveness, sloppiness, ideals, unrealism, honesty, dishonesty, inquisitiveness, self-delusion, hopefulness, ambition and self-destructiveness. Danny goes from one house to another, looking to fulfil his desire to become a great writer, as other characters crash and burn around him, and both happy and unhappy houses fall apart, sometimes literally. Noah Taylor is excellent as the laid-back, somewhat melancholy Danny. Englishwoman Emily Hamilton as Sam, and Frenchwoman Romane Bohringer as Anya are the female housemates who become most entangled in his life, and there are no end of good performances by Alex Menglet, Brett Stewart, Damian Walshe-Howling, Francis McMahon and others, as Danny’s eccentric mates. The film was based on the John Birmingham’s best-seller, though there have been changes made for the adaptation. This is a worthy companion to Lowenstein’s Dogs In Space as the definitive look at Aussie share-house culture.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Dogs in Space, Praise, Angst, Romper Stomper, True Love and Chaos, Strange Fits of Passion\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 stars from both), Luke Buckmaster (Guardian 2015), Richard Kuipers (Australian Screen)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, Trailer\n\n149. A Lion Returns (2020) (Serhat Caradee)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 149/650\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nSet in: Sydney in the 2010s\n\nCast: Tyler De Nawi (Moustafa Dennawi), Danny Elacci, Helen Chebatte, Buddy Dannoun, Jacqui Purvis, Maha Wilson, Maddox Elachi, Taffy Hany\n\nSynopsis: A young Muslim man, Jamal, returns home to Australia from a stint fighting with ISIS in Syria, and wants to see his dying mother, but his family have disowned him, and he must persuade his brother Omar to let him have one last visit.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a powerful look at a topical issue – the issue of modern Islamist terrorism in general and ISIS in particular – from the point of view of the families of the young men who left to travel to fight for ISIS in Syria and Iraq. The film takes place around Jamal’s family home as he argues with his brother in the back of a car about the need for jihad and the shame his leaving brought to his family, before Jamal is allowed into the house to face the more formidable challenges of his dying mother, the father who has disowned him, and the wife and child he abandoned to join ISIS. Meanwhile in the background Uncle Yahya (Buddy Dannoun) is playing a double game, hinting that Jamal will face more pressure to rejoin ISIS. Made with a group of little-known actors, this film is a dramatic entry into the world of Muslims trying to live in a Western country, and the difficulties of living a good life in such a complex multicultural world. Tyler De Nawi gives a convincing performance as Jamal, a man torn between different visions of rightiousness, but all the performances are spot-on.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Animal Kingdom, Romper Stomper, Ali’s Wedding, Lucky Miles, Blackrock\n\nRecommended Reviews: SMH, FilmInk, Stratton (The Australian), Matts Movies, Schembri\n\nFurther information: IMDb, Trailer\n\n150. Tracks (2014) (John Curran)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 150/650\n\nGenre: Adventure/drama\n\nSet in: NT and WA from Alice Springs overland to the Indian Ocean in 1977.\n\nCast: Mia Wasikowska, Adam Driver, Emma Booth, Jessica Tovey, Rainer Bock, Robert Coleby, Rolley Mintuma, Melanie Zanetti\n\nSynopsis: Based on the true story of Robyn Davidson’s 1,700 mile trek across the deserts of Western Australia from Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean, with four camels and her faithful dog, Diggity.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a remarkable and engaging story of a young woman eschewing society for 8 months in the desert with four delightful camels and her dog, Diggity. It’s a remarkable portrait of this determined solitary woman, and Mia Wasikowska gives an outstanding performance. The photography is beautiful and the scenery spectacular. The woman’s interacts positively with Aboriginals and lonely mavericks she meets along the way, while trying to avoid journalists and tourists who come with their four-wheel-drives to see the crazy woman. American actor Adam Driver puts it another fine performance as the National Geographic photographer who tracks her down from time to time to document her trip, and who worries about her at other times. A positively uplifting experience.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Walkabout, Japanese Story, Storm Boy, Wake in Fright, Beneath Clouds, We of the Never Never\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 stars from both)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n151. We of the Never Never (1982) (Igor Auzins)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 151/650\n\nGenre: Period Drama\n\nSet in: Elsey Station and Mataranka in the Northern Territory in 1902\n\nCast: Angela Punch McGregor, Arthur Dignam, Martin Vaughan, Lewis Fitz-gerald, John Jarratt, Tony Barry, Tom Lewis, Donald Blitner, Mawuyul Yanthalawuy, Cecil Parkee, Sibina Willy, Robert Morton, Kim Chiu Kok, Danny Adcock\n\nSynopsis: Historical drama about a woman who travels from Melbourne to live with her husband on a remote cattle station in the Northern Territory in the early 20th century and tries to form a bond with the local Aboriginal people.\n\nWhy See This Film: Angela Punch McGregor is impressive in this adaptation of the autobiographical novel by Jeannie Gunn. As the first white woman in the district, she must cope with the blokey sexism of tough stockmen as well as the primitive living conditions and extreme climate. She gradually forms a bond with the local aboriginal tribe who comprise an underpaid labour force on the station. It’s an interesting picture of the struggle to develop the outback and of race relations in remote Australia at the time. The film was nominated for the AFI Best Film Award, but lost out to Lonely Hearts.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Jedda, The Tracker, Sweet Country, Rabbit-Proof Fence, Walkabout, , Charlies Country, High Ground\n\nRecommended Reviews: Paul Byrnes (ScreenAustralia)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Oz Movies Dossier, Australian Screen Online, Trailer\n\n153. Yolngu Boy (2001) (Stephen Johnson)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 150/600\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nCast: Sean Mununggurr, John Sebastian Pilakui, Nathan Daniels, Lirrina Mununggurr, Sarah Fincham-Thomson, Makuma Yunupingu, Lalambarri Yunupingu, Mangatjay Yunupingu, Mulati Yunupingu, Merrkie Ganambarr\n\nSet in: Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory in the 2000s\n\nSynopsis: Three Yolngu (Aboriginal people of Arnhem Land) teenagers approach manhood and dream about their futures, but get into trouble and go bush together on a trip they will never forget.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is an engaging and surprising film about the camaraderie of three Yolngu teenagers. Three youths, Lorrpu (John Sebastian Pilakui), Botj (Sean Mununggurr) and Milika (Nathan Daniels), are caught between their still-strong traditional culture, and the temptations of modern life. Botj, in particular, is a troubled adolescent from a broken home, and has already been in trouble with the law for stealing. The acting of the three inexperienced young actors is very natural and convincing, bringing us into their world of tradition and teenage hijinks. The film is full of Yolngu language, art, music and culture, which pervade the boys lives in a very natural way, along with pop music, girls and football. It’s an interesting story of friendship, and is notable for being one of very few films being made chiefly about Aboriginals up to that time. Stephen Johnson made the film with the cooperation and guidance of Yolngu people. (Johnson recently made his impressive second film, High Ground, set in the same area.) The film also includes some stunning photography of the people and landscape.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Samson and Delilah, Ten Canoes, Satellite Boy, Mad Bastards, Charlies Country, Beneath Clouds, Rabbit-Proof Fence, High Ground, Last Cab to Darwin, Cunnamulla\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 and 3 stars respectively), Paul Byrnes (ScreenAustralia)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n154. Rams (2020) (Jeremy Sims)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 151/600\n\nGenre: Drama/Comedy\n\nSet in: Rural WA in the 2010s\n\nCast: Sam Neill, Michael Caton, Miranda Richardson, Asher Keddie, Wayne Blair, Hayley McElhinney, Leon Ford, Asher Yasbincek, Travis McMahon, Will McNeill, Kipan Rothbury, Bevan ‘Fudd’ Lang\n\nSynopsis: Two feuding brothers on adjoining farms are thrown into disarray when a disease strikes their prize sheep herds.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is an excellent adaptation of a 2015 Icelandic film of the same name, and maintains many of the dramatic elements of that film, while introducing distinctive Australian elements. Sam Neill and Michael Caton anchor the film as the two cranky old brothers who have not spoken to each other for 40 years, despite living in adjoining farms and carefully watching and silently judging each other’s activities day after day. Sam Neill plays the more social Colin who gets on with his neighbours and attracts the attentions of the local vet Kat, played by Miranda Richardson (in another of her jaunts down-under). Michael Caton plays the grumpier, hermit-inclined Les whose main pleasures are drink, his sheep and beating his brother in the local agricultural show’s ram competition. It’s an engaging story of struggle, setbacks, natural disasters and rough humour, as adversity eventually forces the brothers to cooperate for the good of their beloved sheep.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: Last Cab to Darwin, Strange Bedfellows, The Dish, The Castle, Country Life\n\nRecommended Reviews: Guardian, SMH, Paatsch, ArtsHub\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n155. Last Train to Freo (2006) (Jeremy Sims)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 152/600\n\nGenre: Drama-Thriller\n\nSet in: A late night Perth-to-Fremantle train in the 2000s\n\nCast: Steve LeMarquand, Tom Budge, Gigi Edgley, Glenn Hazeldine and Gillian Jones\n\nSynopsis: Two bored, noisy ex-cons catch the almost-empty last train to Freo (Freemantle), much to the discomfit of the two or three other passengers.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a first-rate drama, with a high level of suspense about whether the two louts’ friendly aggression will result in serious violence, and a hatful of surprises when people turn out to be something other than what they seem. Add the wonderful dialogue (being adapted by Reg Cribb from his 2001 play The Return), an award-winning performance by Steve LeMarquand as ‘The Tall Thug’, and excellent support performances by Tom Budge, Gigi Edgley and Glenn Hazeldine, and you have a film that exceeds the expectations of such a simple setup. This was actor Jeremy Sims’ directoral debut and he has gone on to make three more excellent films.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: The Removalists, The Plumber, The Club, Don’s Party, Last Cab to Darwin\n\nRecommended Reviews: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (4 and 1½ (!) stars respectively)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n156. The Dry (2020) (Robert Connolly)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 153/600\n\nGenre: Crime Drama\n\nSet in: The Wimmera (Western Victoria) in the 2010s\n\nCast: Eric Bana, Genevieve O’Reilly, Sam Corlett, Bruce Spence, Keir O’Donnell, James Frecheville, Matt Nable, John Polson, Jeremy Lindsay, Eddie Baroo, Joe Klocek, Miranda Tapsell, BeBe Bettencourt, Renee Lim, Martin Dingle Wall, Kameron Hood, Claude Scott-Mitchell, Bessie Holland, William Zappa, Nick Farnell, Francine McAsey, Stephanie Halmshaw\n\nSynopsis: Aaron Falk, a federal cop, returns to his drought-stricken hometown for the funeral of Luke, an old-friend accused of murdering his family before shooting himself. He agrees to investigate, but is haunted by the unsolved death of a girl when he and Luke were at school.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is an excellent adaptation of Jane Harper’s popular mystery novel about small town communities and their strengths and weaknesses. It is a story of a man’s return to the place he grew up, but it is also a story of painful memories, hidden secrets, unresolved accusations, old guilt and regrets. Eric Bana, back from Hollywood after a long-time, plays the cop with a very Australian laconicism, playing his emotional cards close to his chest. The rest of the large cast are also impressive as the range of characters found in a small town. It’s a gripping story, as Aaron slowly pieces together both the recent crime, and the older death of the girl. Beautifully filmed, the film captures the isolation and subtle beauties of the Australian countryside, even during a drought.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: The Broken Shore, Mystery Road, The Hunter, Dead Heart, The Interview, Jasper Jones, Lantana, The Square, The Empty Beach, Ground Zero, Goldstone\n\nRecommended Reviews: Guardian, Stratton, Flicks, SceneStr\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Trailer\n\n173. Three Dollars (2005) (Robert Connolly)\n\nOzflicks Rating: 3.5/5 — Ozflicks Ranking: 173/650\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nSet in: Melbourne in the 2000s\n\nCast: David Wenham, Frances O’Connor, Sarah Wynter, Robert Menzies\n\nSynopsis: A government chemical engineer with a happy family suddenly loses his job, and is engulfed in economic difficulties which threaten his house and family.\n\nWhy See This Film: This is a thought-provoking film about a good man trying to survive in the real world. David Wenham finds throughout the film that good deeds are not always rewarded and often come at a cost to his personal life. This film is serious, but does not dwell on the depressing aspects of the situation, looking for the positives during periods of financial stress. Both David Wenham and Frances O’Connor are excellent in the leads.\n\nIf you liked this film, try: The Bank, The Turning, Breath, Dirt Music, That Eye The Sky, In the Winter Dark\n\nRecommended Review: Urban Cinephile, Margaret and David (3½ and 4½ stars respectively)\n\nFurther Information: IMDb, Wikipedia, Australian Screen Online, Trailer\n\nThat’s it for this month. It’s good to get back to the films, after a long time looking at Oz directors, actresses and actors.\n\nComments are, as always, welcome.\n\n[Page updated in August 2023 with newly seen inclusions (and other ranking changes)]\n\nFor more information on the rest of the Top 250 Oz films, see:"
