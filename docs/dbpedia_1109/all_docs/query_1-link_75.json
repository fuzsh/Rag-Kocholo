        "text": "This paper has a long history. Given long ago at a conference, it was meant to appear in the conference proceedings which never appeared. I had lost both the file and knowledge where the submitted paper ended up - until by chance Robin Leaver had written to me and it turned out that the original paper did not only still exist, but that a very kind colleague, Jason B. Grant, had taken the effort to even translate it into English. Hence, I am glad that the effort of the past through academia.edu can now be put to public use. Sorry that I did not have the time to refresh the bibliography, so it is really a paper from the 1990s."
