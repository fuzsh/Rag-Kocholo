        "text": "Biography\n\n3 Tenors\n\n3 Tenors – Pavarotti (Angelo Falcone)\n\nAngelo Falcone is an accomplished compare/singer/cabaret-entertainer. His career in music began while in his early teens and through tuition in modern and classical singing, he developed a very flexible style, enabling him to tackle a huge variety of music. In his early years as a singer, he was the front man of an international group. The experience as a singer/entertainer led him to other areas such as professional comparing and even acting. Solo Cabaret Performers roles became second hand. His versatility extends from light jazz and rock `n roll, to evergreens, classics and arias. Angelo is the closest known Pavarotti singing look-a-like in the world and has impersonated the famous tenor since 1994. Angelo launched the “Australian Three Tenors Show” in 1998, and since then speared another 10 “Shows” which perform around Australia. The “Music of the Night”, “Pavarotti Live”, “Pavarotti meets Elvis”, “Pavarotti and Friends”, “Pavarotti sings with John Denver”, “Pavarotti and Sinatra”, “Pavarotti meets Jerry Lewis”, “Pavarotti and Dean Martin”, “A Touch of Class”, and the “Many Faces of Angelo”.\n\nDOMINGO (LAWRENCE ALLEN)\n\nLawrence Allen studied music at the Melbourne University Conservatorium of Music and the Victorian College of the Arts. In 1980, he continued his studies in London with Eric Viether and Geoffrey Parsons, participating in a series of BBC televised master classes given by Elizabeth Schwarzkopf. His overseas work included appearances with the English National Opera and Chelsea Opera, London. Since returning to Australia he has performed with the Victorian State Opera, the Australian Opera, the Western Australian Opera and also the New Zealand Opera. Lawrence has sung under the direction of noted conductors, such as Sir Charles Mackerras, Mark Elder, William Reid and Simone Young. He continues to be in demand as an opera and concert performer. He absolutely loves the light humour cabaret style performances with the “Australian Three Tenors Show”.\n\nCARRERAS (MARCO CINQUE)\n\nMarco has studied in Australia and Italy. He was honoured to sing for Maestro Luciano Pavarotti and work on facets of singing technique accompanied by renowned conductor Leone Magiera. He has studied with celebrated baritone Enzo Sordello, and was awarded the Umberto Giordano Scholarship in vocal studies that enabled him to study in Italy with conductor and vocal teacher Maestro Lorenzo Castriota Skanderbeg. Cinque has undertaken over twenty-two of the most important operatic tenor roles including Alfredo (La Traviata), Rudolfo (La Boheme), Nemorino (L’Elisir D’amore), Rinuccio (Gianni Schicchi), Turridu (Cavalleria Rusticana), Edgardo (Lucia di Lammermoor), Foresto (Attila), the title roles of Ernani and Andrea Chenier both, Ruggero (La Rondine), Mario Cavaradossi (Tosca), Ismael (Nabucco) and Macduff (Macbeth). Marco starred as Tony Candolino in the award-winning touring production of Maria Callas Masterclass. Pursuing other stagecraft he has performed in film and has recorded in popular and operatic genres. Cinque performs regularly in cultural and corporate events and is thoroughly enjoying his performances with the “Australian Three Tenors Show”.\n\nGIANNI TURCIO{MUSICAL DIRECTOR}\n\nGianni Turcio was born in Capri {Italy}. He followed in his fathers footsteps to become a very accomplished pianist, arranger, producer, musical director and teacher. He holds the Associate and Licentiate Diploma in Pianoforte.
