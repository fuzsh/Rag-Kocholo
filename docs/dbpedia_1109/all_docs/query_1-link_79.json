        "text": "TRINITY ^/ ewsletter COLLEGE A PUBLICATION OF TRINITY COLLEGE WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE Registered for posting as a publication—Category B The Bulpadock and <strong>College</strong> Buildings — including the old wooden Dining Hall — in about 1906. From a picture donated by Richard Gardner ('47). AROUND THE WORLD IN SEVENTY DAYS By the Warden, Dr. Evan L. Burge. The idea of a <strong>Trinity</strong> Dinner in London had been in the air for some time and had the enthusiastic support of Tony Buzzard ('60), the energetic Secretary of the Union of the Heur-de-Lys. Mark Johnson ('58), who was chosen to organize it, had been in the news for some months as the man about to establish Australia's newest bank. The <strong>College</strong> Council decided the Warden should attend, a date of 7th November 1980 at Boodles was set, and Boyd Munro ('61) generously made a comfortable company house in Fulham available as a London base. It seemed a long and expensive way to go just for a Dinner, even if that Dinner was destined to be a great success. A period abroad studying Collegiate accomodation seemed a good idea, with special reference to financial support in hard, inflationary times. And so I decided to visit the other <strong>Trinity</strong> <strong>College</strong>s around the world on my way to Dinner, to make contact with as many of our own <strong>Trinity</strong> members as I could, and to do one or two useful things on the side — such as taking the advice of Norman Canyon ('57) to visit the Alumni Office at the Harvard School of Business Administration. There are <strong>Trinity</strong> <strong>College</strong>s in Melbourne, Toronto, Hartford (Connecticut), Dublin, Oxford and Cambridge. One day, I hope, we'll display the six coats-of-arms in a window over the high table in Hall along the lines of a splendid heraldic window I saw in <strong>Trinity</strong> <strong>College</strong>, Toronto. In every <strong>Trinity</strong> <strong>College</strong> I found myself welcomed as an honoured guest, overwhelmed with hospitality, and put in touch with lively and stimulating people. I came away from each of them enlightened in some way, feeling both admiration and affection. We all have much in common, as members of a world-wide family. As well as to the five major <strong>Trinity</strong> <strong>College</strong>s, my travels took me, after two restful days in Hawaii, to Los Angeles, Vancouver, Toronto, Baltimore, New York, Hartford, Boston, Dublin, London, Oxford, Cambridge, Lincoln, York, Durham, St. Andrews, Paris, Rome, Jerusalem, Manila, and back to Melbourne. Twenty major centres is a lot to cover in seventy days, and yet I found it far more stimulating than wearying. Here, in brief, is what I did in each place. LOS ANGELES. Peter Barbour ('47) ending his time as the Australian Consul- General in Los Angeles, generously gave a day to showing me the city, including a memorable lunch at Adriano's, a delightful Italian restaurant in the suburbs, and an eye-opening visit to a huge student residence at ULCA. I left with ideas of how, in time, we could elevate the beds in the small but tall rooms of Clarke to give more free floor space. VANCOUVER This was a Sunday. I saw my first woman priest celebrate the Holy Communion in the Cathedral. (It seemed just as natural and inevitable as having women students in <strong>Trinity</strong>, including four women theologs to date Then I made a bus tour of this beautiful city's glorious parks, finishing with a visit to several student residences at the University of British Columbia. My only known <strong>Trinity</strong> member here, David Hornsby ('65) of the Mineral Engineering Department, could not be found in the local phone-book. TORONTO. <strong>Trinity</strong> <strong>College</strong>, . Toronto is a most impressive place with a soaring Gilbert Scott Chapel where I attended Wednesday choral evensong, very like our own in Melbourne. Among other things, I learned how computers can be used to teach Greek, how useful library space can be created in basements (? under Behan), and above all how to develop a first-rate Alumni and Friends Association and Development Office. Philip (`Geordie) Wilson ('50) was unfortunately away in Boston on business so we could not relive his famous leap from a window in Behan. Nor could I find Dr. James Oldham ('62) by telephone. I did, however, have a most enjoyable lunch with Penelope Sanderson, Robert Sanderson's ('45) daughter who is pursuing a post-graduate work in psychology. Among other worthwhile things, I noticed a `Rhodes Room' magnificently furnished by a graduate in honour of past and future <strong>Trinity</strong> <strong>College</strong> Rhodes Scholars. The Warden, Dr. Evan Burge"
