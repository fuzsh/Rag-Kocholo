        "text": "DOZENS of electorates are moving forward to the August 21 poll, so it's easy to confuse them. The Latrobe Valley Express has invited Julia Gillard to visit the region and get a firsthand look at the job losses likely from a greener valley but her spokesman declined, saying: ''She is kept well informed of concerns and issues of the people of the valley by Labor's candidate for Latrobe, Laura Smyth.'' Really? The Latrobe Valley, the gateway to Gippsland, has nothing to do with the seat of La Trobe, which spans Bayswater, Gembrook and Officer. Anyway, indefatigable Gillard will be jetting across the nation, even on election eve, to be the special guest at the Australian Writers Guild AWGIE Awards at Peninsula in Docklands. It's not the real Gillard but impersonator Amanda Bishop, who'll sing the Dolly Parton takeoff 9 to 9 about ''Working 24/7 under Kevin''. Guests likely to have a chuckle are Jane Turner, Gina Riley, Peter Moon, Andrew Denton and Jennifer Byrne. The real ones.\n\nSweet sherbet feeling\n\nA STANDING ovation for Daryl Braithwaite, the 61-year-old rock star who has released his first single on iTunes, Beautiful Feeling. Written with Oliver Jones, it conveys Braithwaite's joy from the stage when his fans are entranced by his music. ''Watching the euphoria gives me a beautiful feeling,'' Braithwaite said. He launched the tune at Toorak's TRAK on Friday with Toozies duo Tottie Goldsmith and Eve Von Bibra. The first station to play the song was not an FM one but 774 ABC Melbourne. A wolf whistle for Aunty the groover. A former rocker called Red Symons from Skyhooks did a good deed for his old Sherbet buddy.\n\nRight on the Mark"
