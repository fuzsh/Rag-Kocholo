        "text": "Congratulations to both NSW and Victoria for topping the World Skills Australia Comps. On a per capita basis, solid performances too from both WA and Qld Even Tasmania deserve applause for their gutsy five silver medal performance. However South Australia's results are alarming and throw considerable doubt on the southern states much vaunted commitment to the National Shipbuilding Program and to Vocational Training generally. The Commonwealth is providing $10Billion dollars a year towards Vocational Training in Australia and frankly taxpayers need to see significant skills improvements across bench marking comps Can anyone offer an explanation? (Designed by industry and skills experts, WorldSkills competitions assess an individual’s knowledge, practical skills and employability against strict criteria. Focusing on the highest quality of training standards, employers and training providers can use the competition to benchmark their own apprenticeship and training programmes.)\n\nGreat reminder post from Thomas Hal Robson-Kanu below. Here's my re-write for underestimated founders: Continually overlooked and underestimated - the hurt goes on. But let's not forget the immense growth and resilience underestimated founders continue to show. Diversity-X has a community of underestimated founders, who, despite the challenges, strap on the boots and climb the mountain daily. Underestimated founders do break through and reach remarkable milestones and created incredible impact - which in itself is awe-inspiring. To all underestimated founders and their teams - congratulations on everything you have achieved to date. Keep 🧗🏾♂️! You’ve faced criticism from those who have never walked in your shoes, or are just overlooked and underestimated. When you realise that what doesn’t break you makes you stronger, this journey will help shape your future success. 🏆 Keep your heads held high… the best is yet to come 🙏 Have a great day! #founders #startups #angelinvestors #vc #ecosystem\n\n*Internal Moot Championships 2024 Workshop: Day 1* The Simple Do's and Don'ts With each attendee listening intently while jotting down every little golden nugget of advice they received, clear emphasis was placed on a few important but overlooked areas. The key tips and tricks shared included maintaining eye contact, summarising points succinctly, expanding on points if time permits, and avoiding fillers like \"mmms\" and \"ahhs\", making relevant references to authorities, concluding with a summary, and including a prayer for relief were emphasised. Azim also advised speaking politely to the tribunal, engaging with opponents' arguments, and addressing points directly to save time. After the said advice, the first day of the Internal Moot Championships 2024 Workshop concluded. Each mooter left more informed and prepared to handle the stress that comes with the competition. It is no doubt that ABD Azim Bin ABD Razak's expert insights provided aspiring mooters with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in competitions. As they prepare for the next day's workshop, participants are well on their way to becoming confident and competent advocates.

In sport in particular, all countries work independently and not according to American, Chinese or EU guidelines. If you see an EU team here, please don't forget that only 2 starters or 1 team are allowed to compete per competition, i.e. not 30 or 15 as in Paris. Apart from how the selection process within the EU is supposed to work, the medal haul would be significantly lower. In this respect, the medal table per capita is probably closer to the truth 🥇🥈🥉 https://lnkd.in/dgDFEGxr\n\n𝐆𝐨𝐥𝐝 𝐂𝐨𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐁𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧 𝐒𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 📰 Glynis speaks about the story that has only just come to light now, some 4 years after the Olympics and then in more positive news, the highlights the triumphs of Track and Field with some recent wonderful performances on the world stage!

While our resources are limited, we can strategically focus on javelin to maximize our impact. By developing a targeted strategy—starting at the grassroots level with school programs, creating a national dedicated academy, making Arshad Nadeem Head of the academy, while also investing in international training—we can transform this single victory into a foundation for sustained success. With focused investment and collaboration, Pakistan can emerge as a global leader in javelin, ensuring future Olympic triumphs and inspiring our nation's youth. Let's seize this opportunity to build lasting national pride"
