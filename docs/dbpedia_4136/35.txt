Oriental Museum, Durham (must see)

The Oriental Museum is part of the University of Durham, formerly the Gulbenkian Museum of Oriental Art and Archaeology. Established in 1960, the museum now has over 23,000 pieces of Asian art and artifacts.

The museum was created by the University of Durham's School of Oriental Studies. The school wanted to place all the eastern treasures in one place where they could be seen, admired, and preserved.

Exhibition items come from China, Egypt, the Korean Peninsula, the Indian subcontinent, and Japan. The Chinese collection is the largest, with more than 10,000 objects from the Zhou dynasty through the Qing dynasty. Not so vast is the Korean exhibit, which has around 500 pieces from the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties.

The Ancient Egypt items include an 18th dynasty funeral mask, a funerary figure of Prince Bahmery, and a statue from the reign of Ramses II, among the other 6,700 objects.

The museum received "The Bronze Hear by Right" award from the National Youth Agency in 2012.
