        "text": "The theft of Â£1.8m worth of Chinese artefacts from a Durham museum was a \"complete farce\", a court has heard.\n\nAn 18th Century jade bowl and a Dehua porcelain figurine were stolen during the raid at Durham University's Oriental Museum in April.\n\nLee Wildman, 35, and Adrian Stanton, 32, both from Walsall, previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle.\n\nThe pair are due to be sentenced for their part in the raid at Durham Crown Court later.\n\nJudge Christopher Prince said the plan was not \"sophisticated\" and had been reduced to a \"complete farce\".\n\nThe court heard how the ornaments were hidden on waste land in the Browney Lane area of Durham after the break-in, \"possibly in a panic\", and could later not be found.\n\nA witness spotted Wildman two days later searching the waste land, speaking on his phone and \"seeming agitated\", the court heard."
