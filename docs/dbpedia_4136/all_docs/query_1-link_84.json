        "text": "On September 29, 2018, the Region of Durham successfully hosted the Hello Tomorrow: Smart Cities Durham Forum at University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) in the City of Oshawa.\n\nMore than 300 residents, community partners, businesses, academics, students, government officials and tech industry leaders in Durham Region and beyond registered to attend the forum to share feedback on, and learn more about, smart cities approaches and technologies.\n\nThe forum included:\n\nA keynote address by Hillary Hartley, Ontario's Chief Digital Officer.\n\nPresentations and panel discussions on innovation in Durham Region (including transit, energy, income stability and information technology), smart city innovation, education, leadership in a connected community, and automotive technology and mobility innovation.\n\nA free event app to allow attendees to interact and provide input.\n\nExhibits, technology demonstrations and networking opportunities.\n\nAs promised, we are pleased to share some exciting next steps, and invite you to sign up for future smart cities updates.\n\nResponses to all of the questions asked on the event app during the Smart Durham Panel have been added to the Documents section of the Hello Tomorrow: Smart Cities Durham app.\n\nThinkLink Graphics’ final visual facilitation boards have also been added to the Documents section of the app.\n\nThose who were not able to attend the forum can watch the recorded broadcast of the speakers and panelists.\n\nWe continue to receive ideas regarding future sessions focused on specific industries, including energy, transportation, public health, etc.\n\nmyDurham Intelligent Communities Plan is based on core principles:\n\nmyDurham is Open – There will be many ways to engage and co-create a Smart Durham.\n\nmyDurham is Collaborative – Partnership and collaboration will ensure Durham is a place where we work together to support our residents and businesses.\n\nmyDurham is Connected – Whether by physical or virtual infrastructure, Durham will be a place for connecting with your community.\n\nmyDurham is Inclusive – All Durham residents will be welcome and able to take part in activities and enjoy experiences\n\nacross the region.\n\nmyDurham is Prosperous – Durham will be a place of economic opportunity, supportive of business and piloting innovative ideas.\n\nmyDurham is Sustainable – Durham will be a place for environmentally sustainable living.\n\nImplementation of the myDurham Intelligent Communities Plan requires input from across departments and integration with our local area municipalities and community partners. It is important that everyone have a voice in the process. We envision three main governance structures.\n\n1) Regional Intelligent Communities Steering Committee - Within the Region of Durham, staff in the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer will centrally manage and coordinate the Intelligent Communities Plan. The project lead will be supported by a multi-departmental Steering Committee. Together they will:\n\nBuild business cases for smart initiatives and identify financial resources\n\nFoster an internal culture that embeds emerging smart values and promotes innovation, collaboration, creativity, openness, and risk taking\n\nFoster relationships with regional partners to implement new initiatives, such as local area municipalities, utilities, local tech innovators and educational institutions\n\nDevelop a data governance model, policies and standards\n\nSupport the development of values-based procurement\n\nMaintain the project and partnership inventory\n\nImplement continuous public and stakeholder engagement\n\nDevelop an evaluation framework and collect data\n\nDevelop and execute a coordinated communications plan\n\n2) Intelligent Communities Community Advisory Committee – The Advisory Committee will include representation from local area municipalities, educational institutions and members of the public to ensure alignment among community initiatives, participate in an evaluation process and inform future directions.\n\nContinuous Public Engagement – The Plan will be based on comprehensive and ongoing community engagement and consultation. We will use a variety of engagement tools and methods, including:\n\nYour Voice Durham platform to regularly engage the community in developing intelligent community ideas and developing collaborations.\n\nAnnual Hello Tomorrow event to engage the community and stakeholders in the development of smart solutions for Region of Durham.\n\nThe foundation of success for the Region’s Intelligent Communities Plan will be a robust, transparent data governance process. It is critical to ensure privacy, the protection of personal information, and all applicable legislative and regulatory requirements. The governance structure will include the following:\n\nMeaningful consent from residents\n\nStandardized Intelligent Communities policies and processes that create opportunities for the safe sharing of aggregated, non-confidential data to inform decision-making across departments and partners where possible\n\nConsideration of technological infrastructures, solutions and services that are provided through open digital service standards and ethically sourced data to ensure interoperability, inclusion and opportunity\n\nEmbedded principles of Privacy by Design (PbD) in every project to protect residents’ digital rights and privacy\n\nData Use Guidelines that would apply to all entities seeking to collect or use Regional data\n\nDurham can’t become a truly intelligent region without the help of many partners. Using this framework as a guide, we will continue to seek partnerships with community organizations and leverage our innovation ecosystem to initiate pilot projects. Regional staff will develop a set of guiding policies and procedures to ensure alignment and coordination. Data governance policies will protect our residents in project implementation.\n\nKey partners in the innovation ecosystem include:\n\nSpark Centre, Durham’s Regional Innovation Centre (RIC), provides support to earlier stage and pre-revenue technology start-up companies. Spark Centre acts as a “one-stop shop” providing business coaching and mentorship, learning tools and connections to business and research networks. The centre also offers help with access to investment and funding, ultimately creating jobs and wealth within Durham Region. Spark Centre has advised close to 600 companies in all facets of business and has 19 professionals focused on helping clients achieve scalable revenue and long-term success. Clients range in focus and include wearable technology, clean tech, health, software and invention\n\nThe 1855 Accelerator is a public private partnership (PPP) to support the growth of high potential technology companies. It fills a gap that exists in the Durham Innovation Ecosystem so that rapidly growing companies can stay in Durham to continue their trajectory. At the accelerator, entrepreneurs can move to the next stage in the business development cycle; receive greater depth and breadth of support; and secure resources and capital to grow their business.\n\n1nnovation Village, a regional community hub in Ajax, for talent, technology and entrepreneurship. With a focus on Artificial Intelligence, cyber security, and robotics, 1nnovation Village is a key ingredient in the Region of Durham’s innovation eco-system.\n\nThe Co-iLab Hub was created by the Community Innovation Lab and partners to provide entrepreneurs with access to affordable work space, professional development, skills training and business advisors and mentors. The Co-iLab Hub also offers entrepreneurs opportunities to connect with other entrepreneurs, industry leaders, innovators and thinkers. It is a central access point for all entrepreneurs to collaborate, convene and co-create.\n\nInnovative Collaborations with Post-Secondary Institutions\n\nCityStudio Durham - CityStudio is a proven model of experiential learning and civic engagement focused on developing tomorrow’s leaders by bringing municipal government to the classroom. It is a collaboration between the Region of Durham, Durham Regional Police Service, Durham College, Ontario Tech University and Trent University Durham Greater Toronto Area. By furthering connections between municipal government, academic institutions, and the community, Durham’s post-secondary students can apply their skills, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit to real-world challenges facing our community to shape a better future for all of Durham.\n\nTeachingCity Oshawa - Launched in June 2017, TeachingCity brings together the City of Oshawa and its education and research partners – the Canadian Urban Institute, Durham College, Ontario Tech University, Trent University Durham Greater Toronto Area, and the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering. The partners address Oshawa’s urban issues through innovation, collaboration, applied research and shared experiential learning opportunities with the aim to position Oshawa as a local, national and global community of urban research and learning."
