        "text": "Academic Integrity (Undergraduate)\n\nPolicy and Procedures\n\nThe pursuit of knowledge can proceed only when scholars take responsibility and receive credit for their own work. Recognition of individual contributions to knowledge and of the intellectual property of others builds trust within the University and encourages the sharing of ideas that is essential to scholarship. Similarly, the educational process requires that individuals present their own ideas and insights for evaluation, critique, and eventual reformulation. Presentation of others' work as one's own is intellectual dishonesty, and undermines the educational process.\n\nStandards\n\nAcademic integrity is violated by any dishonest act which is committed in an academic context including, but not restricted to, the following:\n\nCheating is the fraudulent or dishonest presentation of work. Cheating includes but is not limited to:\n\nthe use or attempted use of unauthorized aids in examinations or other academic exercises submitted for evaluation;\n\nfabrication, falsification, or misrepresentation of data, results, sources for papers or reports, or in clinical practice, as in reporting experiments, measurements, statistical analyses, tests, or other studies never performed; manipulating or altering data or other manifestations of research to achieve a desired result; selective reporting, including the deliberate suppression of conflicting or unwanted data;\n\nfalsification of papers, official records, or reports;\n\ncopying from another student's work;\n\nactions that destroy or alter the work of another student;\n\nunauthorized cooperation in completing assignments or during an examination;\n\nthe use of purchased essays or term papers, or of purchased preparatory research for such papers;\n\nsubmission of the same written work in more than one course without prior written approval from the instructors involved;\n\ndishonesty in requests for make-up exams, for extensions of deadlines for submitting papers, and in any other matter relating to a course.\n\nwork generated through unsanctioned and/or undocumented artificial intelligence (A.I.) assistance.\n\nPlagiarism is the act of taking the words, ideas, data, illustrations, or statements of another person or source and presenting them as one's own. This includes using the assistance of artificial intelligence (A.I.) text generators to perform central requirements of an assignment (i.e. reading, synthesizing, interpreting, writing, coding, programming, etc.) without both the explicit permission of the instructor and complete attribution and citation of A.I. assisted components.\n\nEach student is responsible for learning and using proper methods of paraphrasing, quotation, footnoting, and other forms of citation, to ensure that the original author, speaker, illustrator, or source of the material used is clearly acknowledged.\n\nOther breaches of academic integrity include:\n\nthe misrepresentation of one's own or another's identity for academic purposes;\n\nthe misrepresentation of material facts or circumstances in relation to examinations, papers, or other evaluative activities;\n\nthe sale of papers, essays, or research for fraudulent use;\n\nthe alteration or falsification of official University records;\n\nthe unauthorized use of University academic facilities or equipment, including computer accounts and files;\n\nthe unauthorized recording, sale, purchase, or use of academic lectures, academic computer software, or other instructional materials;\n\nthe expropriation or abuse of ideas and preliminary data obtained during the process of editorial or peer review of work submitted to journals, or in proposals for funding by agency panels or by internal University committees;\n\nthe expropriation and/or inappropriate dissemination of personally-identifying human subject data;\n\nthe unauthorized removal, mutilation, or deliberate concealment of materials in University libraries, media, or academic resource centers.\n\nCollusion is defined as assistance or an attempt to assist another student in an act of academic dishonesty. Collusion is distinct from collaborative learning, which may be a valuable component of students' scholarly development. Acceptable levels of collaboration vary in different courses, and students are expected to consult with their instructor if they are uncertain whether their cooperative activities are acceptable.\n\nPromoting Academic Integrity: Roles of Community Members\n\nStudent Roles in Maintaining Academic Integrity\n\nStudents have a responsibility to maintain high standards of academic integrity in their own work and thereby to maintain the integrity of their degree. It is their responsibility to be familiar with, and understand, the University policy on academic integrity.\n\nStudents who become aware of a violation of academic integrity by a fellow student should respond in one of the following ways:\n\nStudents may discuss their concerns with the student whom they suspect of a violation. Direct contact by another student may be the best means of resolving the problem. Repeated demonstration of student concern for academic integrity will, in the long run, build a peer-regulated community.\n\nIf the incident is a major violation or part of a repeated pattern of violations, students should bring their concerns to the attention of the instructor or to the appropriate department chairperson or associate dean. Suspected violations by students reported to members of the faculty or to an associate dean will be handled according to the procedures set forth below.\n\nStudents who have serious concern that a faculty member is not living up to his or her responsibility to safeguard and promote academic integrity should speak with the faculty member directly or bring their concern to the attention of the department chairperson or associate dean.\n\nFaculty Roles in Fostering Academic Integrity\n\nFaculty members should provide students with a positive environment for learning and intellectual growth and, by their words and actions, promote conditions that foster academic integrity.\n\nFaculty should be concerned about the impact of their behavior on students. Students are sensitive to messages communicated in informal discussions and in casual faculty remarks about personal decisions and value judgments. Students are perhaps most sensitive to how responsibly faculty members fulfill their obligations to them in the careful preparation of classes, in the serious evaluation of student achievement, and in their genuine interest in and availability to students.\n\nFaculty should promote academic integrity in the following specific ways:\n\nAt the beginning of each course, instructors should discuss academic integrity in order to promote an ongoing dialogue about academic integrity and to set the tone and establish guidelines for academic integrity within the context of the course, e.g., the extent to which collaborative work is appropriate. Where relevant, instructors should discuss why, when, and how students must cite sources in their written work.\n\nInstructors should provide students with a written syllabus that states course requirements and, when available, examination dates and times.\n\nInstructors are encouraged to prepare new examinations and assignments where appropriate each semester to ensure that no student obtains an unfair advantage over his or her classmates by reviewing exams or assignments from prior semesters. If previous examinations are available to some students, faculty members should ensure that all students in the course have similar access. Course examinations should be designed to minimize the possibility of cheating, and paper assignments should be designed to minimize the possibility of plagiarism.\n\nProctors should be present at all examinations, including the final examination, and should provide students with an environment that encourages honesty and prevents dishonesty.\n\nFaculty should respect students' intellectual property and the confidentiality of student academic information.\n\nAssignment of grades, which is solely the responsibility of the instructor, should be awarded in a manner fair to all students.\n\nAcademic Deans\n\nAcademic deans have overall responsibility for academic integrity within their schools. In particular, deans' responsibilities include the following:\n\npromoting an environment where academic integrity is a priority for both students and faculty,\n\nensuring that students who are honest are not placed at an unfair disadvantage, and\n\nestablishing procedures to adjudicate charges of academic dishonesty and to protect the rights of all parties.\n\nProcedures\n\nAcademic integrity is central to the educational and formative mission of the University. A University-Wide Undergraduate Academic Integrity Committee, made up of Academic Officers from each of the Undergraduate Schools and Colleges, reviews all reports of academic dishonesty. Faculty and students are consulted on an ad-hoc basis depending on the case.\n\nWhen a faculty member determines that a student's work violates the standards of academic integrity, the faculty member is encouraged to discuss the matter with the student. The faculty member should notify the student of the substance of the violation and the action that the faculty member proposes to take. If the faculty member decides to impose a grading penalty, a letter of notification describing the incident, the evidence supporting the allegation, and the proposed grading penalty is to be sent to the Associate Dean of the school or college in which the course is taught.\n\nOn receipt of such a notification, the Undergraduate Academic Integrity Committee will notify the student of the allegation and the evidence. If the course is outside of the student’s home school or college, the student’s class Dean will also be notified. The student will be given an opportunity to respond to the allegation in writing (within 5 business days). The Committee is dedicated to resolving cases in a just and timely manner and to maintaining the confidentiality of any students involved. While a case is pending, the student may not withdraw from or change status in the course.\n\nEach reported violation of the standards of academic integrity will be reviewed by the University-Wide Undergraduate Committee on Academic Integrity. This will ensure that, in cases involving students from more than one school or students in joint or dual degree programs, the process and penalty will be consistent.\n\nThe committee's approach is a formative one that expects students to reflect on their experience, understand the impact of their choices, and make decisions differently based on what they've learned. The approach is meant to be educational and restorative, rather than punitive. Consequences for students found responsible for violations will depend upon the seriousness and circumstances of the violation, the degree of premeditation involved, and the student's previous record of violations. The committee may simply affirm the faculty member's penalty and issue the student a \"warning,\" which will be kept in a confidential electronic file until the student graduates and will not be reportable to professional schools or outside agencies. The Committee may recommend a different grading penalty and/or impose additional administrative penalties. The most severe penalties may include university probation, suspension, or expulsion, all of which become part of a student's academic record and are reportable to graduate/professional schools and outside agencies.\n\nThe Associate Dean of the school in which the course is taught will convey to the faculty member and the student the Committee’s findings as to responsibility and recommended sanctions. Appeal of the Committee's decision may be made by written request to the Dean of the school or college of the course not later than ten days following notification. The decision of the Dean will be final.\n\nSummary of Process\n\nStep 1: The faculty member is encouraged to discuss the matter with the student.\n\nStep 2: The faculty member should notify the student of the substance of the violation and the action that the faculty member proposes to take.\n\nStep 3: If the faculty member decides to impose a grading penalty, a letter of notification describing the incident, the evidence supporting the allegation, and the proposed grading penalty is to be sent to the Associate Dean of the school or college in which the course is taught.\n\nStep 4: The Undergraduate Academic Integrity Committee will notify the student, who will be given an opportunity to respond to the allegation in writing (within 5 business days).\n\nStep 5: The case will be reviewed by the University-Wide Undergraduate Committee on Academic Integrity.\n\nStep 6: The Associate Dean of the school in which the course is taught will convey to the faculty member and the student the Committee’s findings as to responsibility and recommended sanctions.\n\nStep 7: Appeal of the Committee's decision may be made by written request to the Dean of the school or college of the course not later than ten days following notification. The decision of the Dean will be final.\n\nUndergraduate Admission\n\nAdmission Information\n\nFounded by the Society of Jesus in 1863, Boston College is dedicated to intellectual excellence and to its Jesuit, Catholic heritage. Boston College recognizes the essential contribution a diverse community of students, faculty, and staff makes to the advancement of its goals and ideals in an atmosphere of respect for one another and for the University’s mission and heritage. Accordingly, Boston College commits itself to maintaining a welcoming environment for all people and extends its welcome in particular to those who may be vulnerable to discrimination on the basis of their race, ethnic or national origin, religion, color, age, gender, marital or parental status, veteran status, disabilities, or sexual orientation.\n\nBoston College seeks to maintain an undergraduate student body that represents a broad variety of abilities, backgrounds, and interests. Therefore, in selecting students, the Committee on Admission looks for demonstrated evidence of academic ability, intellectual curiosity, strength of character, motivation, energy, and promise for personal growth and development. Requests for financial aid do not affect decisions on admission. The Undergraduate Admission website provides further details on the application requirements and deadlines.\n\nAdmission from Secondary School\n\nWhile specific courses are not required, the Office of Undergraduate Admission recommends that students pursue a strong college preparatory program that includes four units of English, mathematics, social studies, and foreign language, as well as four units of a natural science. Such a program provides a solid foundation for high quality college work, as well as a stronger application in a highly selective admission process.\n\nStandardized Testing\n\nThe SAT or\n\nThe American College Test (ACT)\n\nBoston College will continue its test-optional admission policy for the 2024-25 application cycle. Students may send official score reports from a testing center, list their test scores on their applications, and/or upload scores through their Applicant Status Portals. Enrolled students who provided scores with their applications will be required to submit official test score reports upon matriculation. At that time, students’ results will be verified.\n\nThe full policy can viewed at bc.edu\\admission.\n\nAll submitted standardized test results are used in the admission process. Applicants are required to take all standardized tests no later than the October administration date of their senior year for Early Decision and by December of their senior year for Regular Decision.\n\nThe Committee on Admission will select the best combination of individual section scores when evaluating an application. International students for whom English is not their primary native language are required to submit scores from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or the DuoLingo English Test (DET). Students who score 650 or above in the SAT EBRW or 29 or better on the ACT English section may have this requirement waived.\n\nApplication Procedures\n\nRegular Freshman Admission\n\nStudents applying to Boston College should submit the Common Application, the Boston College Writing Supplement and an $80 application fee no later than January 1. Both the Common Application and Boston College Writing Supplement are available on the Common Application website. Candidates are notified of action taken on their applications no later than April 1.\n\nEarly Decision\n\nEarly Decision I and II are binding programs for candidates who view Boston College as their unequivocal top choice institution. If admitted to Boston College through Early Decision, candidates must immediately withdraw applications to other institutions and enroll at Boston College. Students are required to submit an Enrollment Confirmation Fee to Boston College within ten days of receiving their admission offer.\n\nCompetitive Early Decision candidates present academic credentials, extracurricular engagement, and personal qualities that fit the profile of currently enrolled Boston College students. Because Early Decision attracts a small, but competitive pool of candidates, the acceptance rate will be higher at Early Decision. Completed Early Decision I applications and the Common Application Early Decision Agreement form must be submitted no later than November 1 for consideration. Candidates will learn of the Admission Committee's decision by December 15. Early Decision II applications are due by January 1 and candidates will learn of the Admission Committee's decision by February 15.\n\nApplying to an Undergraduate Division\n\nAll applicants must designate to which of the four undergraduate divisions they are making their application: Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences, Carroll School of Management, Lynch School of Education and Human Development, or Connell School of Nursing. Students are only considered for admission to the division to which they applied. Students may not change divisions following admission, but may be eligible to apply for an internal transfer to a new division after: one semester for those seeking a transfer to Morrissey or Lynch and two semesters to Connell or Carroll. Transferring internally is not guaranteed and selectivity varies by division; interested students should complete the Internal Transfer Form found on the Academic Forms page.\n\nInternational Student Admission\n\nInternational students are expected to submit the same credentials (transcripts, recommendations, standardized tests, etc.) as domestic applicants. All documents should be submitted in English. If the credentials must be translated, the original must be submitted along with the translation. All international students whose native language is not English are required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) exam, the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or the DuoLingo English Test (DET). Minimum scores of 100 on the TOEFL iBT, 7.5 on the IELTS, or 130 on the DET are recommended.\n\nTransfer Admission\n\nTransfer admission applications are available to students who have successfully completed three or more transferable courses (9 credits minimally) at a regionally accredited college or university. Transfer students must have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 to be considered for admission. Competitive applicants typically have above a 3.5 cumulative grade point average. Students are encouraged to finish one full year of studies before seeking admission-in-transfer.\n\nAll candidates for transfer admission should submit the Transfer Common Application and all other required forms along with the $80 application fee. All portions of the Transfer Application can be found on the transfer website at bc.edu/transfer.\n\nNOTE: An Academic and Disciplinary Report must be submitted for every undergraduate institution attended full-time by the applicant. Additional copies of this form may be obtained from the transfer website.\n\nAll supporting documents must be sent directly to the Boston College Office of Undergraduate Admission by the sending institution. Transcripts issued to students and photocopies will not be accepted. The deadline for submitting applications is March 15 for the fall and November 1 for the spring. Fall candidates will be notified of action taken on their applications no later than May 20. Spring candidates will be notified no later than December 15.\n\nPlease consult the transfer admission website for additional information about transfer policies.\n\nTransfer of Credit\n\nBoston College transfer credit policies are established by the Deans and Faculty of each undergraduate division. Course evaluations are completed by the Office of Transfer Admission. Any questions regarding the evaluation of courses, either before or after enrollment, should be directed to the Office of Transfer Admission.\n\nAt Boston College, transfer credit is established on a course-by-course basis. Transferable courses must have been completed at regionally accredited colleges or universities and must be similar in content, depth, and breadth to courses taught at Boston College. In addition, a minimum grade of C- must have been earned. Boston College students must complete the following number of credit hours for graduation: Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences—120, Carroll School of Management—120, Lynch School of Education and Human Development—120, and Connell School of Nursing—117. A maximum of 60 credit hours will be allowed in transfer. The unit of credit at Boston College is the semester hour. Most courses earn 3 semester hours of credit. Lab sciences usually earn 4 semester hours of credit.\n\nNo credit will be granted for internships, field experiences, practica, military training, or independent study.\n\nApplicants seeking to have online courses accepted in transfer by Boston College should submit a syllabus for each course, including information about contact hours and exam requirements.\n\nGrade point averages do not transfer with students. A new grade point average begins with the commencement of a student's career at the University and reflects only work completed as a full-time undergraduate at Boston College.\n\nFor transfer students, courses taken during the summer prior to enrollment at Boston College should be approved in advance by the Office of Transfer Admission to avoid difficulty in the transfer of credits. For all incoming freshmen and currently enrolled students, all summer courses must be approved in advance by the appropriate deans.\n\nCollege credit courses taken in high school with high school teachers and other high school students cannot be used for credit. These courses may be assigned advanced placement units only if a corresponding College Board AP exam is taken and a qualifying score is earned.\n\nDate of Graduation\n\nAll undergraduate students are expected to spend four years enrolled as full-time students in order to earn a bachelor's degree.\n\nStudents generally may not accelerate the date of graduation stated in the acceptance letter, with the following exception: students who enter Boston College after three or four semesters at a school where the normal credit requirements are less than those at Boston College and who experience a loss of one semester in their status as a result. If students have attended only one school prior to Boston College and the loss of status is due solely to differences between academic systems, students will be allowed to make up their status and graduate with their class.\n\nA transfer student's date of graduation is determined by the number of credits accepted in transfer and the number of Boston College semesters these satisfy. The normal academic load for undergraduates is five 3- or 4-credit courses per semester. Thus, students are expected to have completed 30 credits at the end of one year, 45 at the end of a year and a half, and 60 credits at the end of two years. In determining a transfer student's date of graduation, leeway of 6 credits is allowed without loss of status. For example, students completing 24–30 credits are accepted as first-semester sophomores.\n\nResidency Requirement\n\nThe requirements for the bachelor's degree generally include a minimum of eight semesters of full-time enrollment, at least four semesters of which must be at Boston College.\n\nTransfer students may need more than eight semesters in total in order to complete all the university’s degree requirements. As long as transfer students abide by all relevant University academic regulations, including at least four semesters at Boston College, they may seek to regain their original graduation-year status through course overloads and summer courses. Transfer students who seek to regain their original graduation date should consult with their associate dean to confirm that they are eligible to do so.\n\nSpecial Students\n\nOnly those persons who wish to be enrolled as full-time day students are admitted by the Office of Undergraduate Admission. All other students wishing to attend Boston College on a part-time basis, for either day or evening classes, should contact the Dean of the James A. Woods, S.J., College of Advancing Studies, St. Mary’s Hall South, Ground Floor, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467.\n\nAdvanced Placement Units\n\nThere are a number of ways to earn advanced placement units at Boston College including qualifying scores on College Board Advanced Placement (AP) exams, International Baccalaureate exams, British A Level exams, French Baccalaureate exams, as well as results from the German Abitur, and the Swiss Maturité and Italian Maturità. Official results from all testing should be sent to the Office of Transfer Admission for evaluation. Qualifying scores will be assigned advanced placement units as detailed at bc.edu/advancedplacement.\n\nCollege Courses Taken During High School\n\nAdvanced placement units can be earned for college courses taken during high school. For more information, visit bc.edu/advancedplacement.\n\nLanguage Proficiency Requirements\n\nRefer to the Language Proficiency Requirements section below.\n\nUniversity (Senior) Awards and Honors\n\nMorrissey College of Arts and Sciences\n\nFrank J.

(1 credit)\n\nPre-Health Program\n\nThe Core curriculum at Boston College is an advantage for students interested in professions in the health field, as it allows students to explore their unique talents and passions. The skills acquired in the study of the sciences and the humanities are readily transferable to careers in the field of health and medicine.\n\n“Science is the foundation of an excellent medical education, but a well-rounded humanist is best suited to make the most of that education.”\n\n—David Muller, Dean for Medical Education and Professor and Chair of the Department of Medical Education and Co-Founder of the Visiting Doctors Program at Mount Sinai Medical School (Julie Rovner of KHN; Kaiser Health News, May 27, 2015).\n\nFinding purpose in an academic program of study remains one of the most important decisions for BC students considering a career in the health professions. English majors acquire analytical skills needed for absorbing medical text. Philosophy majors develop critical thinking skills needed for differential diagnoses. Theology majors evaluate tenets beneficial in medical ethics and palliative care. History majors develop the ability to ask the pertinent questions in formulating patient history. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges’ 2022–2023 Report of Applicants and Matriculants to U.S. Medical Schools, the percentage acceptance rate of students majoring in the humanities was higher overall than for those majoring in other disciplines. Listed, as follows, are the acceptance rate percentages by discipline for the 2022–2023 application cycle: Humanities—50%, Mathematics, and Statistics—45%, Physical Sciences—46%, Biological Sciences—40%, and Social Sciences—40%. (Derived from data supplied in Table A-17 of the AAMC summary),\n\n“The humanities provide an outstanding foundation for understanding complexity and human variability, the conceptual basis for understanding medicine.”\n\n—Charles M. Wiener, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director Emeritus, Osler Internal Medicine Training Program at John Hopkins Medical Institute (Beth Howard—AAMC Medical Education, December 12, 2016).\n\nPre-Health students are encouraged to reflect on who they would like to become as health professionals. Eighty-two percent of BC students participate in campus service and volunteer organizations. This augments the formation of students to be “men and women for others'' in the health career of their choice. Health professions graduate schools are interested in students who demonstrate a commitment of service to the underserved and the poor, including populations historically underrepresented in patient care. This dedication to others expands and informs their decision to pursue a career in the health field which supports comprehensive patient care and health equity for all. Students entering the Pre-Health program are encouraged to reflect on the mission of the Core curriculum to refine a purposeful and authentic life that integrates academic disciplines and the building of relationships. Each semester, a student should be engaged in a course (or courses) that inspires them and creates an awareness and a curiosity to explore and grow. Furthermore, Pre-Health students considering their program major are encouraged to reflect upon “The Three Key Questions” posed by Fr. Michael Himes, Professor of Theology at Boston College:\n\nWhat brings me joy?\n\nWhat am I good at?\n\nWhat does the world need me to be?\n\nThe Pre-Health program in the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences is an open program for all students in every major program of study at Boston College. There is no minimum GPA requirement. The program provides support and comprehensive advising to undergraduates and alumni of Boston College interested in medical, dental, or veterinary careers, as well as other areas of health profession study. Students benefit from majoring in any of the varied academic disciplines offered at BC, which would help them address the three aforementioned questions. As a Jesuit, Catholic institution, Boston College is dedicated to the continual process of intellectual inquiry and student formation. Students are encouraged to examine the full spectrum of options and to select a major and find an enriching program of study in which he/she will excel.\n\nUtilizing the Pre-Health Team to Maximize Success\n\nIrrespective of major (humanities or STEM), the BC Pre-Health team meets with students at every stage of their Pre-Health portfolio development, from prospective freshmen to seniors and alumni. The Pre-Health team assists with all aspects of planning when considering a career in the health professions, including selection of a major, course selection, gaining health-related experience, evaluating extracurricular activities, preparing for professional exams (MCAT, DAT, GRE) and all aspects of the pre-and post-application process for health profession schools. If you are considering a career in a health profession, please set up an appointment with our office by emailing premed@bc.edu. For up-to-date information about the Pre-Health program please email us in order to receive notifications regarding programming and upcoming events. Our office resides within the Academic Advising Center and is located in Stokes Hall S132.\n\nAll Majors at Boston College Have Access to the Pre-Health Program\n\nIt is important to note that medical, dental, and veterinary medical school admissions committees accept a wide variety of majors. Therefore, it is imperative for students to decide on the particular major that would lead to their success as they embark on their unique career path.\n\nStudents are invited to think, explore, and discern in order to learn across disciplines and develop their minds and educational experiences to the fullest potential. The goal is to gain the ability to think critically, both broadly and deeply, and at Boston College, a liberal arts education is focused on the whole person. The liberal arts have always been at the center of the Jesuit, Catholic intellectual tradition, which promotes the integration of students’ academic and personal goals, inspiring them to reflect on who they are, who they want to become, and how they want to engage in the world for the common good.\n\nGregory Kalscheur, S.J., Dean of the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences shares, “At Boston College, we hope our students become women and men of depth of thought and creative imagination, who are ready to engage the needs of our world and well-prepared for meaningful lives of leadership, scholarship, and service.”\n\nIn choosing a major, we encourage students to allow their choice of major be shaped by academic experiences and exploration in programs of study that resonate with the student’s interests, skills, and talents. For example, a student may want to reflect upon evidence of previous academic success in a certain area when selecting a major. However, if a student is considering a major program of study that is new to the student, without prior foundational coursework, then the student may wish to weigh the pluses and minuses in forging new territory, as opposed to leveraging prior academic success. Exploring the groundwork for future immersion in a discipline is the primary tenet of the Core curriculum which fosters a broad and diverse perspective of the humanities and arts, the sciences, and the social sciences.\n\nThe BC Pre-Health team works with students to strategize on the optimal timeframe and coursework necessary to complete the foundational requirements. Keep in mind that course requirements vary when applying to health profession schools. Irrespective of any major at Boston College (humanities or STEM), below is a summary of the necessary Pre-Health program requirements. The Pre-Health team encourages interested students to research the requirements for specific medical or dental schools of interest, as well as research elective coursework helpful in preparation for standardized entrance exams.\n\nProgram of Study\n\nSuggested Foundational Curriculum for Pre-Health Students:\n\nTwo semesters of Biology with Lab\n\nTwo semesters of General Chemistry with Lab\n\nTwo semesters of Organic Chemistry with Lab and/or one semester of Organic Chemistry with one semester of Biochemistry*\n\nTwo semesters of Physics with Lab (either Calculus-based Physics or Algebra-based Physics is acceptable; refer to major program requirements as well.)\n\nTwo semesters of English\n\n*It is incumbent on the prospective applicant to be knowledgeable of individual medical school requirements when planning his or her course selection. We suggest meeting with a member of the Pre-Health team if uncertain.\n\nThe required courses for the professional school of interest may be taken during any of the four undergraduate years in any order with the exception of the General Chemistry– Organic Chemistry sequence. In order to apply to health profession schools directly upon graduation from BC, the student must complete all course requirements in three years, in addition to successful completion of standardized testing. Most BC applicants, however, elect to distribute the Pre-Health coursework over four years of undergraduate study and apply to medical, dental, or veterinary school as seniors and/or as alumni. The average age of a student matriculating into medical school is approximately 25 years old; therefore, electing to take one or more “growth” years to explore, reflect, and act on a specific health-related problem, clinical, or scientific inquiry may inexorably improve the competitiveness of a student’s candidacy. At Boston College, the Pre-Health team operates as a cohesive advising unit that closely collaborates with students during each undergraduate year of portfolio development to help create a career narrative.\n\nFreshman Year: Interested students should attend the freshman meeting and set up an initial consultation with the Pre-Health program office to learn and capitalize on the benefits of drop-in advising sessions and explore resources.\n\nSophomore Year: Interested students should attend the sophomore meeting and review progress and achievements with the Pre-Health team. Specific attention should be given to gaining relevant health-related experiences.\n\nJunior Year/Senior Year: Interested students should attend the application meeting and meet regularly with the Pre-Health team to ensure that all materials are complete to initiate the BC committee letter application process.\n\nThe BC Pre-Health program collaborates closely with BC alumni and the greater professional community to offer students the full gamut of possible pathways leading to a meaningful career in the health field. A unique aspect of a valued service that BC offers students interested in medical or dental school is the opportunity to obtain a committee letter of recommendation endorsed by the Boston College faculty committee. This letter presents a comprehensive assessment of the student under review by the committee and showcases the accomplishments and achievements of an applicant in a personalized portfolio. Additionally, during the application process, students receive one-on-one expert advising from an individual faculty member on the committee. While the Pre-Health team is dedicated to ushering students through the process of applying for professional health programs, it is important to note that the onus is on students to reflect, discern, and act in order to pursue their unique career path.\n\nFreshman Pre-Health Checklist\n\nRegister for Pre-Health program announcements at premed@bc.edu\n\nAttend the freshman meeting (first week in September —email invitation will be sent out)\n\nRead the freshman checklist online\n\nMake an appointment with a member of the Pre-Health team by calling 617-552-4663\n\nCultivate a mentor (get to know your professors and other administrative staff)\n\nDevelop study skills, attend office hours, and seek tutoring assistance from the Connors Family Learning Center and/or academic support when warranted\n\nVisit academic departments to research programs of study, minors, and concentrations\n\nGet involved with a health-related club (e.g., Mendel Society, Predental Society)\n\nGet involved judiciously with on- or off-campus service organizations and extracurricular activities"
