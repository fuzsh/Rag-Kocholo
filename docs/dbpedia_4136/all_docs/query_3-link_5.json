        "text": "G\n\n#14 Contacting Dr Julio Samsó – Involved in the Reproduction of the Astrolabe – Depicting the updates to modernise the replica Astrolabe\n\nobjects-of-desire-astrolabe\n\nAdriana from Hemisferium kindly passed on a link to Dr Julio Samsó’s profile on researchgate. He was the expert on Arabic culture and Islamic technology and scientific instruments who helped compute the ancient alphanumeric codes and other special characteristics for this new astrolabe.\n\nI contacted him through researchgate.net but unfortunately I did not receive a reply. However, this did not deter me, and I searched for any information on him on the internet and I was able to track down his University email as he is a Professor at the University of Barcelona.\n\nVery unexpectedly I received an email back a few days later!\n\nI wanted to pose a few questions to him. First and foremost, the replication process and what had been the major updates.\n\nHe pointed me in the direction of the booklet which comes with my astrolabe which he helped to write. Thankfully, I managed to get a copy of this from Adriana which was incredibly useful. As well as illustrating some other points of development.\n\nHe informed me that ‘it was never their aim to make an exact replica but to build a similar piece in the Oriental style for the latitude 21° 32’ N.\n\nIt was meant to be as ‘faithful as possible to the original but, at the same time, updated and furnished with certain essential elements that make it useful in present times.’\n\nFrom a combination from his booklet and email I have illustrated the main updates:\n\nThe front of the Hemisferium astrolabe\n\nRegula\n\nHemisferium updated their model to contain the classical regula (ruler), which offers agile, precise and versatile solutions to many problems (some of which cannot be solved without it).\n\nThe updated regula also offers the great advantage of saving the user tedious and repetitive movements, as well as the mathematical calculations needed to establish the time in degrees and then convert the latter to hours and its fractions to minutes. These operations were originally all performed with abacuses.\n\nLimbus\n\nUpdated in line with the traditional ‘European’ style of astrolabes, the limbus was divided in two XI- hour sections, AM and PM, and each section is divided into 15 and 30 minute sections.\n\nCalendars\n\nThe ecliptic was altered to include a monthly and daily Gregorian calendar.\n\nZodiac Calendar – There are also entrances for the different zodiacal signs marked with the corresponding symbol. The entrance for each sign also corresponds to dates on the Gregorian calendar, for example, the entrance into Aries corresponds to the 21st of March and entrance into Libra to the 23rd of September.\n\nIntervals are placed every 5 days in order not to alter the back of the astrolabe.\n\nRete or net (Fig. 4)\n\nIt has been abridged and updated by reducing the number of stars and leaving only the most relevant ones, with a cleaner plate in mind.\n\nThe stars placement also had to be updated to their corresponding locations for the 21st Century as stars change position so they are not where they were when the original piece was made in 1647 in terms of their Right Ascension and Declination.\n\nThey were able to accurately correct this through logic and calculations. They took the knowledge that the precession of the equinoxes is equivalent to 50’ of the annual arc and that 71.5 years correspond to 1 degree. Thus, with this update they could update the pattern without fear of any imprecision.\n\nPlates to Mater\n\nDiyâ’ al-Din’s astrolabe included 4 plates engraved on both sides, as well as an astrological plate engraved in the mater, whilst the replica does not have plates.\n\nOn the replica, the mater has the diagram of the Equator, tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, horizon, circles parallel to the horizon, and vertical circles.\n\nThey are set to a latitude 21º 32’ which corresponds to Jidda in Saudi Arabia. (Fig. 1)\n\nDr Samsó informed me that Hemisferium had planned to sell the instrument in Saudi Arabia which explains the choice of Jidda and Mecca.\n\nThe almucantars (heights) are labelled every 10° and azimuths marked every 10° and highlighted every 30°, increasing from the South.\n\nThis gradation is represented by a ciphered alphanumeric type scale, following the use of the period.\n\nIt also has a crepuscular (twilight) line corresponding to astronomic sunset (when the Sun has a negative altitude of -18°).\n\nThey also included the temporary and Babylonian hours for that latitude. (Babylonian hours were equinoctial or equal hours which represented the time elapsed from sunrise and were marked by the Sun’s nadir or antisolar point under the horizon; they were numbered from 1h to 13h.)\n\nBack of the Hemisferium astrolabe\n\nThe back (Fig. 5) of the instrument has been almost preserved completely.\n\nAlidade\n\nOnly the alidade has been changed, for one belonging to another astrolabe made a few years later (1660, catalogued as A-81) by Diya’al Din Muhammad in Lahore.\n\nThis alidade is more in keeping with the drawing of the scales in our piece.\n\nCurve of the solar meridian\n\nThe replica also contains the curve of the solar meridian altitudes throughout the solar year for the latitude of Mecca (modern value 21º 26’).\n\nIn Diya’ al-Dîn’s astrolabe there were two curves for latitudes 27º and 32º\n\nThis scale is made up of distances for the respective entrances into the signs of the Zodiac (separated by equal distances).\n\nDiagrams by Hemisferium\n\n20/02/2020\n\n{Tags}"
