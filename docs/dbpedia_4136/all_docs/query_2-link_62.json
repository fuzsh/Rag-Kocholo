        "text": "The Oriental Museum is home to over 36,000 objects, dating from pre-history to the present day.\n\nNot sure where to start? Use this guide to discover a selection of star objects from our collection, as chosen by our visitors.\n\nOur galleries are arranged geographically and the entrance to the museum is on Level 4.\n\nHowever you choose to explore, use the menu on the right to navigate based on where you are in the museum.\n\nSilk Roads\n\nChinese Bed\n\nJiangsu Province, 1830 - 1839 CE\n\nThis type of bed is called Babu chuang. This name refers to the fact that the sleeper has to step forward to get on the bed, reflecting its magnificent size.\n\nBeing the most important furniture in a Chinese household, the bed demonstrated the wealth and status of the family. This is the biggest type of Chinese bed, and it was only found in some of the richest areas in Southern China, as the craftsmanship was extremely complicated and expensive.\n\nThe decoration on this bed indicates it was originally intended as the bridal bed for a wealthy Chinese woman.\n\nNebuchadnezzar Cylinder\n\nIraq, 599 BCE\n\nThis fired clay cylinder preserves an inscription of the Neo-Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II. It records his restoration of the temple of the sun-god Å amaÅ¡ in Sippar.\n\nThe message starts with the king introducing himself, then gives an account of his building work before concluding with a prayer to the sun-god.\n\nThis cylinder may originally have been deposited in the walls of the temple, or kept as an archive copy in Sippar or elsewhere.\n\nWindow Grill\n\nPakistan, 19th - 20th Century CE\n\nWindow grills allow light and cool air to flow into a building while at the same time maintaining privacy. This particular grill was designed for use in an internal courtyard and so is decorated and glazed on both sides.\n\nThe intricate geometric design is inspired by Kufic script, a handwritten Islamic alphabet used by early Muslims to record the Qur'an.\n\nThis guide continues with our Egypt Galleries along the corridor.\n\nEgypt\n\nServant Girl\n\nEgypt, about 1360 BCE\n\nThis is probably the best known of all the Egyptian objects in the Oriental Museumâs collection. Made from boxwood, ivory and gold, it is famous both for the quality of the craftsmanship and for the natural pose of the girlâs body, which was unusual in Ancient Egyptian art.\n\nProduced during the reign of Amenhotep III, the statuette is believed to have been part of the burial equipment of Meryptah, high priest of Amun. A statue of Meryptah himself can be seen on display in the Statues case in this gallery.\n\nNot just a beautiful statue, this object is also a container, probably used for a cosmetic oil or paste.\n\nMummified Woman and Coffin\n\nEgypt, about 250 BCE\n\nThe exact origin of this mummy and painted wooden coffin are unknown. However, the style of decoration strongly suggests they are from the area of Akhmim in Upper Egypt.\n\nWe think the mummy may have been discovered by French archaeologist Gaston Maspero in 1884, before being donated to Penrith Public Library, Cumbria in 1888 and then Darlington Library and Museum in the 1930s.\n\nIn 1960 when the Oriental Museum first opened the public, it had an important Egyptian collection but no mummy. A loan was arranged from Darlington for this mummy which was later converted into a formal transfer.\n\nResearch into this mummy is ongoing. Tap the images below to see what we have discovered.\n\nThis guide continues downstairs in our Korea Gallery.\n\nKorea\n\nWedding Ducks\n\nRepublic of Korea, 2013 CE\n\nMarriages were once arranged between families in Korea, but in the past few decades, âlove marriagesâ have become more commonplace. This, along with the growth of Christianity, has led to more âwesternâ marriage ceremonies. However, many couples still have an additional traditional ceremony in the brideâs house where gifts are exchanged between families and respect shown to elders.\n\nWedding ducks are a traditional gift, and are given by the groom to the bridesâ family as a promise of fidelity, as ducks were believed to mate for life. After the wedding, the ducks became a symbol of the marriage and are placed in the coupleâs home. If the couple is happy, the ducks were placed beak-to-beak. But if the couple has an argument, they are positioned tail-to-tail. These ducks are painted with the auspicious colours, which bring good luck.\n\nItem 1 of 2\n\nSake Cups\n\nNorth Korea, 1910-1945 CE\n\nThis set of silver cups for drinking rice wine is still being researched.\n\nIt was given to Erna HÃ¤hnel, a member of a delegation from the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) which visited North Korea in 1957. The cups are Japanese in style and may have been made in Korea during the period of Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945 CE). This was a difficult period for all Koreans and so why they were deemed a suitable gift for an official visitor from an important ally is still unclear.\n\nErna, whose collection is now on loan to the museum, can be seen third from the left.\n\nJapan\n\nBuddhist Altar\n\nJapan, around 1980 - 1985 CE\n\nBuddhist family altars like this one are known as a Butsudan. They can be used to hold memorial tablets for dead ancestors and representations of Buddhist deities.\n\nThis altar belonged to a Japanese family and was used by the grandmother until her death in 1999, providing a focus for her daily rituals.\n\nEvery day she would open the doors to the altar, light candles or incense, leave offerings of food or drink for the ancestors and pray or speak to them.\n\nSamurai Armour\n\nJapan, 2013 CE\n\nThis set of armour was handmade in Japan for the Museum by a company specialising in the production of armour for films.\n\nIt is a reproduction of Å-yoroi style armour worn by samurai during the Medieval period in Japan. First seen in the 10th century, this was a rich manâs armour, not the armour of a low ranking samurai.\n\nThe colour and design of the armour helped to identify the wearer on the battlefield, indicating the wearerâs rank and family.\n\nHead downstairs to our Himalayas, South Asia and South-East Asia Gallery to continue with this guide.\n\nHimalayas, South Asia, South-East Asia\n\nSkull Cup\n\nTibet / Nepal, 1800 - 1900 CE\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhist rituals a skull cup, known as a kapala, is used to make offerings to appease angry or ferocious deities such as Dharmapalas. These offerings may take the form of dough-cakes and wine in place of flesh and blood. The dough may be formed into the shapes of eyes, ears or tongues.\n\nThe human skulls used for kapala are specially selected and prepared, often using the remains left by high lamas to their monastery. Once consecrated for use in the rituals they are sensitively cared for.\n\nStatue of Ganesh\n\nNepal, 1700 - 1900 CE\n\nIndian Door\n\nMumbai (Bombay), before 1918 CE\n\nDecorated Safety Helmet\n\nUK and Indonesia, 1959 - 2014 CE\n\nMetalworking in Southeast Asia continues to evolve. In Indonesia, particularly in Java, during the second half of the 20th century a tradition of decorating work helmets has developed.\n\nThis UK-made fire safety helmet has been decorated with traditional Islamic motifs including floral scrolls, birds and animals. There are also images of the Ali Qapu Palace and Imam Mosque, both in Isfahan, Iran.\n\nThe two men depicted appear to be Nadir Shah (1736-47 CE) founder of the Persian Afsharid dynasty and the ancient Persian king Darius the Great (550-487 BCE). This would suggest that the helmet was decorated for an Iranian working in Java.\n\nHead downstairs to our China Gallery for the final section of this guide.\n\nChina\n\nTiger Tally\n\nChina, 206 BCE â 220 CE\n\nThe tiger tally is an ancient form of military verification. An inscription was carved onto the body of the tiger, and the tally was then disassembled into two segments. One half was kept by officials in central government, the other half was given to a military leader stationed away from the capital.\n\nThe tally allowed local army commanders to verify the identity of a messenger from the capital. Only when the two segments had been reassembled could the orders that accompanied it be undertaken.\n\nApple by Li Lihong\n\nPeopleâs Republic of China, 2007 CE\n\nArtist Li Lihong (born 1974) was born in Jingdezhen, the traditional heart of the Chinese porcelain industry.\n\nHis reworking of Western company logos are among his most notable pieces. In this case you can see Appleâs bitten apple and Nikeâs swoosh. He has also reworked Disneyâs Mickey Mouse ears, and the McDonaldâs golden arches. These works all reflect Liâs upbringing in China in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution with the influx of American brands and products into the country looking for a share of the huge Chinese market.\n\nLi Lihong presents both the confrontation between tradition and modernity and the meeting of West and East. These concepts are important ongoing subjects for contemporary artists in China and also resonate with Western collectors.\n\nYou've reached the end of this guide, but there is still much more of the Oriental Museum to see.\n\nEnjoy the rest of your visit or scroll down for more of our online resources."
