        "text": "Tag Archives: Durham University\n\nThe best time of my life\n\nStandard\n\nSo here we are. My very last blog about my time in Durham. Even though I am extremely sad about the way my Exchange ended, I cannot express how grateful I am for having had the chance of spending a year abroad.\n\nYes, being away from home and living all by yourself will be hard at times. And yes, you will stumble and make mistakes. But this shouldn’t discourage you from going on an Exchange. The challenges you will be facing, will only make you stronger and more independent.\n\nI have met so many wonderful and interesting people, and have made friends for life. The memories we have together will stay with us and new ones will be added.\n\nBefore I came to Durham, everyone who has been on an Exchange told me that they returned as a different person. In a way they were right. The Fanny that will come to pick up her belongings in June is not the same like the one that first arrived in September. But I have not become a wholly new person. If I would have to summarise the biggest thing I’ve learned in one sentence, I’d say the following: I got to know myself. I am leaving this place with a new form of direction. I now finally know where I want to go, and where I want my place in this world to be. Once again, I can only encourage you to take the chance and study abroad!\n\nHere are some of my favourite memories of my time in Durham 🙂\n\nAll the best and stay safe, your Fanny ❤\n\nFollow me around Durham!\n\nStandard\n\nPart of your Exchange is also about discovering the area outside our campus. Use the chance to travel the country and visit places in and around your temporary home, as there are more than plenty of opportunities!\n\nIn this blog I am going to tell you a little about the trips I have gone to (so far 😉 ) and the places to discover in Durham itself.\n\nDay Trips and Weekend Trips around Durham\n\nIf you have read my previous blog (if you haven’t, here’s the link: https://thedurhamexchange.wordpress.com/2019/10/22/prepare-arrive-and-live/), you know that your first week in Durham will be very busy. But does it get any less busy after that? Nope… You might get more and more used to the place and the environment (your hairstyle won’t, trust me!) but there is so much going on that you will never get bored! This may sound scary, but I have quite appreciated it, as it prevented me from feeling homesick.\n\nNevertheless I would say that the first few weeks are definitely the ones you should use for exploring the surrounding, since you have no essays to hand in yet.\n\nSo what have I been up to?\n\nDay Trip to Edinburgh\n\nMy first trip was to the beautiful City of Edinburgh. We left Durham early in the morning and arrived by midday. At first we climbed Arthur’s Seat (the highest spot in Edinburgh) from where we could see the entire city lying at our feet, as well as the sea behind it. After that we joined a walking tour through the city, discovering not only the beautiful castle and many historical sites, but also several Harry Potter “locations”, such as Victoria street a.k.a. Diagon Alley!\n\nOf course, one day wasn’t enough to explore the entire town and its history, but it was a wonderful change of pace and I will definitely go there again during my exchange.\n\nWeekend Trip to the Scottish Highlands\n\nIn the week I went on a three-day-trip to the Scottish Highlands. This journey was absolutely breathtaking! It was a weekend full of beautiful nature, amazing historical sites, whiskey and lots of fun!\n\nWe left very early on Friday morning (at 5.30 am!) and our first stop was the Whiskey Distillery “Kingsbarns” close to St. Andrews. After having some Whiskey for breakfast we hopped back into our coach and rode to St. Andrews, a beautiful University Town well known for golfing and where Prince William met Kate Middleton.\n\nThe second day of the trip was my absolute favourite. Basically, we went from St. Andrews to Inverness with several stops along the way.\n\nApart from trying to find the right stone circle (fellow “Outlander”-fans know what I mean), we stopped at the Bridge of Orchy, the Glennfinnan Viaduct – well known for Harry Potter and the Hogwarts Express – Spean Bridge, Invermoriston and finally Inverness. Glenfinnan served as a very important site during the second Jacobite Rising in the early 18th century, which later on led to the famous “Battle of Culloden”, marking the end of the Scottish Clans and their way of life. Enough history though, at this point I will let the photos speak for themselves!\n\nThe last day of the trip we spent mostly in the bus. We still visited the famous Urquhart Castle though. The Castle is more a ruin by now but still very impressive and well-kept. If you are interested in Scottish and British History, you should definetely go there too!\n\nPlaces to visit in Durham\n\nDurham has many beautiful places to see if you need some time off. I somethimes walk through the Cathedral on a rainy day or just spend the day learning in a cafe, rather than in the library.\n\nAnother nice way to clear you head is to spent some time in the beautiful Botanic Garden with some friends. The garden has a lot of trees and especially in autumn you feel like walking through an orange, brown and green fairyland!\n\nAlso worth a seeing is the Oriental Museum. Though rather small, it has many beautiful artefacts from all over Pacific Asia.\n\nI will close this blog with a last impression from the Botanic Garden and will soon tell you all about University-Life, Lectures, Sports and Societies!\n\nSo long, your Fanny 🙂\n\nSummatives, deadlines and a 24/7 library\n\nStandard\n\nMaybe you still remember that I wanted to tell you about how well those New Year’s resolutions concerning the summatives went. I guess I’d have to say that they worked out mostly. I did make a schedule that included very long nights at the library, I also was one of those people who got really excited about the 24/7 opening times and I must admit that while actually managing to finish three of my essays several days before the deadline, the last one did include some falling behind my own schedule and desperate nightly phone calls to my brother, about how afraid I was not to have sufficient time to write something I was actually contended with. But even this one I was able to hand in without any nervous last-minute printing and running.\n\nIf you come here, and like me, are originally from a university where you do not need to write any essays during term time, it will definitely be a challenge to write them and at the same time keep preparing all your classes, seminars and tutorials sufficiently, especially if all deadlines will be very close together. Planning will be essential! But luckily the essays during last term gave me a rough idea on the amount of time I would need per essay and therefore it worked out well. This means that you should definitely take all the formatives seriously and not only use them as an opportunity to further investigate a certain topic but also to develop an idea on how essay-writing works. Besides, to avoid getting too stressed: use those Christmas holidays, to relax, to catch up with all you loved ones and eat a lot of cookies, but definitely also get some of your reading done.\n\nThat said; please don’t get too worried about those summatives. Firstly you will be able to choose from a range of topics, so that you can engage more with those topics you are especially interested in and secondly you can be assured that the professors at Durham University will put a lot of effort into helping you, discussing those topics with you and making you feel confident about your essay.\n\nThis time of summatives, however stressful it was, showed me in particular that Durham University is indeed special and a really good choice. Of course you may have already realized that I am really enthusiastic about this place. However, in making your decision to come here, one personal experience may not be enough. I therefore decided to ask around for you how others perceived Durham University and why they thought it was a good choice. With English being my main subject, the first person I talked to of course was the responsible contact person for exchange students of the English department, associate Professor Patrick Gray who told me: “The Department of English Studies at Durham is exceptionally attentive to individual undergraduate students, offering many occasions for one-on-one conversations with tutors and professors, as well as small-group tutorials and seminars. The curriculum is clearly-structured and emphasizes literary history. How does the canon of English literature change and develop over time? Students are free to attend any and all undergraduate lectures on English literature, in addition to those modules that they may be studying for Erasmus credits.”\n\nI couldn’t agree more, as the time of summatives has proved everything in this statement and more. I was really amazed by the many opportunities to have one-on-one conversations with tutors and professors and by how helpful they were in regards to the topics but also how reassuring they were. I took one seminar this year that I found especially demanding and the meetings with my professor have helped me a lot to feel confident about it and find a better way to prepare it. The close cooperation of students and professors as well as the attentiveness of the professors towards individual students at this university amazes me every time again. This is of course owing to the small groups in tutorials and seminars, which also allow for the students to take part in the decision which topic they would like to emphasize. I find the experience to study here very unique and it was actually the stressful time of summatives, when I realized that I would really like to come back for my postgraduate studies.\n\nSo yes, the only risk I see if you decide to come here is that you may find it harder than expected to leave again, once the exchange program will be over.\n\nFormatives & Festivities\n\nStandard\n\nNow that we’re past all the Christmas and New Year celebrations, I feel like it’s time to give some tips and tricks on how to really get into the Christmas spirit in Durham. Whether it’s a winter ball, a trip to what seems to be Father Christmas’ favourite holiday location (AKA the beautiful city of York) or some carol singing, England really knows how to get you in the mood for mulled wine, roasted chestnuts and German bratwurst.\n\nThe first event that really got me in the mood for Christmas, was the Durham City’s Christmas Lights Switch On, which was on the 30th of November. The warm feeling of people coming together on the market square, combined with the smell of some very yummy food, really sets the mood for Christmas. While a subtle arrangement of levers and pulleys set angels and holy figures on a flight over the market, Christmas music accompanied the narration of the event. This all cumulated in leading the apotheosis of the evening: The switch-on of the lights decorating the big Christmas tree!\n\nThe sighting of the first Christmas lights irrefutably induces in me the craving for mulled wine and German bratwurst. These necessities, however, appeared absent from the Durham Christmas scene.\n\nLuckily a few weeks later I went on a trip to York with the Theology Society where we went to visit York Minster and afterwards we strolled around the Christmas market. I definitely recommend visiting York in December, as the city seemed to be tailored to this holiday season. The city has a few Christmas shops that are open all year round and the Christmas market is to die for. It was there that my quest for foreign sausages and heated alcohol was fulfilled. I must say these taste better in an actual German Christmas market, but likewise, the consumption of tea and scones will always be best when indulged in the UK.\n\nOther events that really made me look forward to the 25th of December were the Stephenson Winter Nutcracker Ball, a Christmas party with other international students, the Durham Christian union carol service, and the Durham City’s Nativity Play.\n\nColleges all over Durham really splash out when it comes to organising a ball. Although at first, I found the prices for these balls a bit expensive as I’m not used to spending a lot of money on student events in my home country, I really think it’s worth going to one or two of these fancy dress balls. They often include a drink on arrival, a three-course meal and some fun surprises during the meal and the subsequent party. Considering that you get to be a part of this typical English tradition of going to a ball, and considering all the things you get to enjoy, it really is worth the expense!\n\nDurham also spoils its citizens and students with lots of carol singing. Be it during the nativity play, where live donkeys and camels accompanied the consort (BIG FAN!), or during a service as exquisite as the cathedral in which it was hosted, the carol singers always knew to hit that festive note. The fact that such typically British carol singing events are open to all, regardless of religious orientation, reflects the atmosphere of openness and celebration that pervaded the Durham air.\n\nWith all the fun I had, I almost forgot about my formative deadlines. Despite struggling with the notion of formatives, I duly arrived at the following conclusion: A formative essay is an essay that will be graded, without contributing to the final grade. It helps form the students by providing feedback and guidance while allowing the student the freedom to play with the novel concepts he or she is attaining. While I was reluctant at first to slave away for an assignment which would not count, I did feel that the work I put into my formative bolstered the confidence I will doubtlessly need when writing my summatives during the Epiphany Term.\n\nTot de volgende!\n\nKelly\n\nAre pet camels a thing? 🐪\n\nBeautiful York 😍\n\nCelebrating the season to be jolly with Linda (unicorn accessories are accepted all year\n\nround) 🦄🎄 + cheering for my friend Mirjam who was singing in the choir 🎤🌟\n\n🍴❄️Winter Nutcracker Ball – Stephenson College❄️🍾\n\nNew Year’s resolutions\n\nStandard\n\nHappy 2019 everyone! I hope you all got to enjoy a lovely Christmas break and ate at least as many delicious pastries and cookies as I did during the holidays, just so the list of New Year’s resolutions makes more sense…\n\nIn my case the Christmas break included stops in Germany, Slovakia and Scotland, to finally catch up with some of my favourite people, see and hug my incredibly amazing and adorable nana again (who by the way is turning 90 today!!!), spend a very stress-free Christmas-eve with my brother and make some amazing new acquaintances. It really was a wonderful holiday, which once again confirmed that going abroad doesn’t impair any of your interpersonal relationships. The very moment I got to see Leonie and Kathi waiting for me at the trainstation in Marburg with a self-made sign, I felt like I had never spent any time apart from them, exactly like when my brother picked me up in Siegen a few days later. So if you are thinking about spending a term or even a year abroad, this surely doesn’t need to be any of your concerns.\n\nLuckily, despite having the most amazing time, I also remembered to take my books travelling with me, wrote an essay and tried to prepare those ones that yet need to be written as much as I could. Because Epiphany term doesn’t start off as calm as Michaelmas. Epiphany term from the very start means being concerned with deadlines and trying to get to the library quite early to secure a good working place. At least for me it did, as I have four deadlines coming up within the next three weeks, and also several new topics in my seminars that need to be prepared. Hence some other of my New Year’s resolutions are being tested right away. If you therfore do not see me running around on days of deadlines, impatiently talking to printers that won’t listen, or having any meltdowns once the library closes at midnigt, this means that I was able to meet those resolutions much better than the one that included eating less chocolate.\n\nFortunately I was able to make use of the feed-back sessions for my past assignments, to meet the professors and discuss my work, so that now I have a better feeling for what is expected from me and I am less nervous about writing the further upcoming essays. The exact word-count still usually causes some difficulties for me, as I seem to tend to be writing a lot and usually end up having to cut down my essays. As a person who very much enjoys writing, it of course is a slightly hurtful proces to shorten down a text for which one has carefully chosen every word, but I also appreciate that this way I learn to focus on the most important arguments and get to involve with my topics even more intensivly.\n\nThose essays are also exactly what I should be getting back to now…\n\nIt’s great to be back in Durham and I wish all of you a successful new term. I’ll let you know how mine goes, how much the panick increased, once I got closer to those deadlines and whether or not I can just reuse the list of resolutions for 2019 for 2020. Talk soon!\n\nLeaving home to get home\n\nStandard\n\nTime in the past few weeks just flew by and I still cannot believe that I am right now sitting at the airport, waiting for my flight to take me to Germany for the Christmas holidays. Part of the reason for why time went by so quickly surely is that there were so many things to do lately. All those essays that are quite different to the ones I write in Germany, had to be written, seminars and presentations to be prepared and books needed to be read. Luckily I ended up enjoying the topics of every single one of my essays and even got used to the idea of a certain word count, which was something completely new to me. But especially the interesting topics – owed to a wide range of questions all students get to pick from – made the long days at the library a lot more enjoyable, than it may sound at the first instance. After all, I still managed to make enough time to meet some new people, build friendships and spend a beautiful afternoon in York with my friend Lea. And when all the work for the first term was finally done, the last lesson of my short-fat module was over and all essays were handed in, I decided to treat myself with a long awaited trip to Edinburgh that turned out to exceed all expectations and to be the perfect end to a great term.\n\nGetting used to the routine with classes and studying, being more familiar with the city and building true friendships with some people, also brought me to realize, that there is more than one way to arrive in a new place. At first I just arrived physically, getting off the plane, arriving to Durham, not sure yet what exactly was expecting me. Somewhat later my mind arrived, as it just needed a little bit longer than a two hour flight, to feel all of this to be real. Finally, arriving with the heart and developing a sense of ‘home’ for a newplace however did require some more time. For this I needed to know, that Iwill do well with my assignments, that I will be able to learn a lot at university, that there are people to turn to when I face a problem and that I have built up trusting friendships in this new city. Being in the lucky position to feel more and more assured of all this during the past weeks, I am now sitting at the airport with this curious feeling of leaving home and going home at the same time. It may seem a bit contradictory at first, if you haven’t yet lived abroad, but once you come here, I am sure you will be able to understand what I mean.\n\nI cannot wait to get off the plane and take the train to Marburg, where two of my dearest friends will be waiting for me at the station, because finally hugging them again is long overdue. I also can’t wait to spend Christmas with my brother, as it just wouldn’t feel like Christmas if we didn’t decorate the tree together and didn’t prepare a delicious Christmas dinner, so of course it will be wonderful to be back again and to catch up with everyone. But apart from that I am also very much looking forward to the next term at Durham university. Of course once again I won’t know what exactly will happen in the future, but I have a far better idea of what to expect and this time, when I take the plane in January, I won’t be travelling to the unknown, but I will be returning home instead. And knowing that ‘home’ isn’t necessarily defined by just where one is from, but can be anywhere we are going to, is a wonderful feeling that was once again confirmed by this exchange year in Durham.\n\nI hope you will all have a wonderful christmas break!\n\nAdventures in books and conquering castles\n\nStandard\n\nThere may have been one or two mentions of having to read quite a few books at the moment… Just know that this is not supposed to imply any complaint, as I actually love to read. Of course I enjoy some books more than others, and I usually wouldn’t pick a crime story or a thriller myself, because the slightest tension is just too much for me and does not just give me goose bumps but usually nightmares right away (Yes, even watching an episode of Monk in my case is reason enough to leave the lights on at night). Also I do believe that there is no such thing as a bad book. After all every single book will be able to transport us to a completely different world. I personally think it is incredibly fascinating how a certain combination of words, which already hold a specific meaning to us, when they are standing alone, can actually evoke such vivid pictures in our minds, once they are put together. It is just paper with some ink on it, one might think, and yet it takes us on adventures we never had imagined ourselves, to places we have never been before and to people we have never met.\n\nAs we cannot go away every time faraway places seem to call out for us the best and also the easiest solution to escape and take a journey anyway, is a book. That’s why I pretty much always carry one with me. Which brings me the other great feature of books: they are usually handy enough so that you can simply take them anywhere. Therefore sometimes it may even be possible to combine two of the greatest pass times with each other; just put a book of your choice in your backpack, go to the train station and take a little trip. There are so many interesting destinations you can easily reach from Durham. One of those definitely worth a visit: Holy Island.\n\nWithout my wonderful classmate from Spanish, who recommended this to me, I don’t know if I had gone. Therfore I must say, i am still very much grateful for this amazing tip. A direct train leads from Durham to Berwick upon Tweed, a little town just a few miles south from the Scottish border. There I went for a little walk along the coast, even got to see a lovely seal just relaxing in the sea and when it started to rain, I found a really cozy Café to warm up in, read, and enjoy the most delicious pumpkin cake, while waiting for the bus. The bus that takes you all the way from Berwick to Holy island has to run according to the tide times and usually only departs twice per day and on good weather conditions, hence it will be wise to check the times in advance. In my case the bus left Berwick sometime after 2pm and got me to this beautiful island in 30 minutes. It is also possible to walk, but you will need a lot more time and will definitely want to bring your wellies for that. Once at the island, I was able to enjoy a stunning view at the sea, the adorable castle of Lindisfarne and an amazing sunset at Lindisfarne Priory, before I escaped from the cold wind and treated myself with a cup of hot tea and some more pages of my book.\n\nOnce I got home that day I had not only seen the island St. Cuthbert was the bishop of in his times, but Nelly had also just finished telling me the story about the stirring lives of Heathcliff and Catherine. So if I haven’t mentioned this very good reason to come to Durham: you will be able to study really interesting topics and take advantage of living in a very beautiful region all at the same time.\n\nSquirrels and muscle pain\n\nStandard\n\nAs I gained weight the last time I stayed in the UK, I already accepted that a few extra pounds would be inevitable during my Erasmus year (‘cause bangers and mash, scones, jaffa cakes…). But hell was I mistaken. For a person who’s only used to the flat Flemish scenery, walking in Durham feels like climbing mountains. My department lies next to the cathedral and if you know Durham a bit or if you’ve seen pictures of Durham, then you know the cathedral and the castle are the highest points in the city. This all means that I basically had a sore bum for a week. But hey, I’m not complaining as it’s free exercise and to be fair the walks in Durham are just wonderful.\n\nNext to bum training, I also play squash. I’ve been wanting to get proper squash training forever, so I went to the trials of the University’s squash club and got into the squash development squad! Yay! A tip for people spending their Erasmus adventure in Durham next year, do go to the freshers’ fair! All sports clubs and societies gather for you to be explored. There are so many clubs/societies, that I’m sure, there’s one out there for everyone. Squash, Rowing, crafting, wine & cheese society, gin society… There’s even a Harry Potter society (you can try quidditch!!!). And even if you’re not that into sports and societies, it’s still worth going as there are gadgets and free food, which is kind of a reason in itself to go, isn’t it?\n\nAs well as squash, I signed up for a ‘learning how to row’ course. I can now proudly say I know the basics of rowing. Who knew it actually takes some brain work to figure out when exactly you should stretch certain limbs and how to coordinate your movements!? But I felt I had to try it as rowing is such a typical university sport in the UK. I really liked it as I felt focussing on staying in tune with fellow rowers created peace and quiet in my head. It’s a really good way to start the day and I definitely recommend it!\n\nApart from sports, I also became a member of the Theology Society. They organise fun socials and next week we’re going to York to explore York minster and the Christmas markets! Mulled wine, ice skating and bratwurst, here I come!\n\nSo while hiking between lectures, squash training and fun outings, my favourite pastime is spotting squirrels. Yes, that’s right, those cute brown little mammals that have the most gorgeous tails ever. As my student accommodation lies next to some woodland, I spot a few each week and I feel like a 6-year-old all over again. I can’t help it, I get so excited when I see them. On the question on why I get all happy and smiley on the sight of a rodent, my answer is quite similar to one from the beginning of this blog post: the West-Flemish scenery I’m used to. I live near the seaside and apart from seagulls and tourists, we don’t really have any funny-looking creatures exploring our beaches.\n\nTo sum up: mixed feelings on Durham’s hills, grateful for all the possibilities to join clubs and societies, and feeling like a kid when I see squirrels.\n\nTot de volgende!\n\nKelly\n\nsome nice spots I found while walking in Durham 🙂\n\nsquash and learning how to row\n\nA blur of first impressions\n\nStandard\n\nThinking about the first days in Durham now, they seem like a blur of classes, meeting new people, discovering the city with my wonderful friend who visited me just during my first week, getting used to the local accent and lots of reading.\n\nSo what is there in particular I remember?\n\nPeople in Durham are really lovely, welcoming and always up for a chat… It’s the little-town-magic that going outside also means running into some familiar faces; and walks to university are just a lot more fun when you get to play with your neighbour’s Australian Shepherds on the way.\n\nTaking the little path across the playground to the library may be muddier than the street, but also a lot more beautiful.\n\nIt is possible to take food and drinks to the library, so finally there is a place for me where I can indulge in my coffee addiction and study at the same time. Just once, when the person sitting just inches away from me started eating a bag of carrots, crispss and then what seemed like a selection of food that had to be chewed very loudly, I was wondering whether it was really worth having to put up with this for coffee… well, yes it is!\n\nClasses are usually 55 minutes, which is quite short compared to 90 minutes back home, but they are very informative and I feel like I am getting just the same amount of information like in longer lectures as my concentration is better.\n\nThe Café at the market has a very tasty Mocha! Sure… my opinion may have been impared by having some of worlds best company at my side, but also after Leonie went back home I still like coming here cor a cup of coffee.\n\nDurham cathedral and the castle are just awesome, and the cathedral may make the hearts of ‘Downton Abbey’ fans leap, as it bears some resemblance, I was told. Personally I do especially enjoy the view at night when everything is beautifully illuminated.\n\nThere is a lovely path along the river to the Old Durham Gardens, where also three Alpacas and a horse are to be found. That information is crucial to me, because Alpacas are my absolute favourite animals ever since I first saw one and walking past those adorable creatures with their big eyes and funny teeth every morning before class, just absolutely makes my day.\n\n‘Aye’ means ‘yes’ and when someone talks about a ‘lass’, they are referring to a girl. But knowing that is just the very first tiny step to understanding the local accent and I am still adjusting. Luckily I’ve already met many my very lovely neighbours who I can practice with every now and then… and who don’t mind repeating some sentences three times before I finally get them.\n\nSharing all the new impressions with an amazing friend doubles the fun, so it was wonderful to have Leonie here during the first few days, get lost with her and laugh about it together, as we both have a terrible sense of orientation. The only downside about this: having to say goodbye at the bus-stop also meant shedding some tears in public. Just couldn’t help it.\n\nThe coast is just a bike ride away! There are some beautiful cycling routes along the former railway lines and it makes a perfect little trip if you happen to have some spare time on the weekends. My flatmates and I are in the lucky position to have a wonderful landlord who actually provided all three of us with bikes for this year, so it was very easy to just hop on and go there. Alright, i have to admit: At least for people with a normal sense of orientation it would have been very easy to get there. For me it involved some serious discussions with the voice from the Google maps app and also some detours. But I made it anyway!\n\nEnglish pastry is delicious! Yes I have a sweet tooth and a weakness for pie.\n\nBrowsing the rails at all the book stores in town is dangerous, especially if your reading list already turned out to be quite long… but then again, there is no such thing as having enough books!\n\nI know this is a very random list of first impressions, but then again everyone will experience their first days in a new country in a different way. You may be more interested in a great party location than in the closest Alpaca farm. You may prefer studying at home compared to the library and visiting a big city over the weekend instead of a bike ride to the coast… I don’t expect you to do everything I did, to be surprised by everything that did surprise me or to think in the same way. I just want you to know, that when you come here, there will be a lot to discover. There will be many lovely people to welcome you, to help you out, tell you where the classroom is you are looking for, show you to the next supermarket, explain the bus schedule to you, or just have a chat. You may be the only one of your friends back home that is leaving, you may be travelling alone, but you won’t be once you arrived to Durham. And the first few days will be filled with new impressions and experiences, so that you won’t find the time to worry about anything.\n\nSetting foot in Durham\n\nStandard\n\nEverything I needed for my year abroad was stuffed into the big black suitcase next to me,everything else I owned safely stored in my brother’s attic and the tears fromsaying goodbye after a beautiful evening with all my loved ones were dried. I had just gotten off the plane in Newcastle and according to Google maps; I was supposed to arrive at the doorstep of my new home in less than one hour. I felt incredibly nervous, but the ticket inspector on the train luckily distracted me from that for a brief moment with his funny announcement: “Dear passengers, today is one of those wonderful days where everything is broken. As you may have realised there are no seat reservations. The machine simply decided not to print. But as it’s always a good solution I suggest that you just find a free seat and make yourselves comfortable. Also, I am not able to sell any tickets, which is why I decided not to check any either. I am sorry for those of you who purchased a ticket beforehand, but I promise to walk around the train anyway so you can angrily glare at me. For anyone else; just enjoy this useless day and your free ride.”\n\nTo me this day actually felt anything but useless, as it marked the first day of my life as a Durham University student. Therefore my heart just went back to this very quick and quite worrying rate. After all, I had never been to Durham before, never met my flatmates, and never studied or lived in England so far. But there is a first time for anything they say…\n\nAs I was already late for the Orientation Program due to my work back home, this day was not only exciting owing to my arrival in Durham, but it also had a full schedule. After arriving at my new place in time, and being welcomed by both my lovely flatmates, I was happy to see, that everything in the house looked exactly like in the pictures and the wardrobe and desk drawers in my room were just waiting for all my things to be put in. The great thing about moving with just one suitcase: moving in is a piece of cake. So within the next hour I was already able to explore the close surroundings of my home and get the very essentials in a nearby grocery store, which in my case included a French press, several bags of coffee and of course chocolate. With my daily dose of caffeine in one hand and a route planner in my other hand I then walked towards the University for an Appointment at the International Office, then to meet my supervisor for the first time, change the classes that I had to change due to schedule conflicts and get the necessary books for the first weeks. Luckily everything went according to plan and every single person I met was extremely welcoming and helpful so that I even managed to pick up my students ID at my college and check out the library all on the same day. I would however highly recommend everyone to attend the Orientation Program, because it may be manageable without it but it should be extremely helpful and a lot less stressful to attend it.\n\nWhen I got back home, dropped the bags with all those new books on the floor, and sat on my bed; it hit me for the first time: So much had changed within the past 24 hours! Of course I had been planning this for several months and I didn’t just suddenly and very surprisingly open my eyes in England one day, but theory is always a bit different to reality. So there I was, sitting on this bed I had never slept in, holding the keys to my new home that I shared with two people I had never met before, in a new city, a different country, with the English channel separating me from my brother and all my friends and I wondered if I should be intimidated by it… but I wasn’t. This first day, stressful and packed with new information as it was, made me look at this year ahead of me with even more anticipation than before. After all I had been given the warmest welcome by everyone I met, so when I closed my eyes that day, I actuall fell asleep without any doubts on my mind."
