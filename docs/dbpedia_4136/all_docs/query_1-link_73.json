        "text": "Preventive Archaeology represents the best available method for addressing the preservation and characterization of buried historical heritage in relation to modern economic development. A repertoire of remote and field practices is organised within a multi-scalar methodological framework and toward the aim of assessing and documenting the “archaeological risk”, or the potentiality of an ancient context to lay hidden underground.\n\nThis MOOC on “Preventive Archaeology” is the result of a shared endeavour between experts from both the public/academic and private sectors, having a distinctive knowledge and training in archaeology and cultural heritage. This cooperation provides the MOOC with a transversal perspective, addressing the involved issues through different points-of-view and approaches, with the result of providing multiple solutions. In detail, the contents include the educational paths and legislative frameworks related to the archaeological practice, the different tools available to the archaeologists to record and preserve historical evidence and a focus on some case studies concerning cultural heritage endangered by the development of settlements and landscapes. The MOOC is firstly addressed to European and Western Asian students and scholars interested in archaeology and cultural heritage: in fact, its structure and content allow any individual interested in such subjects to be able to acquire this specific knowledge in a clear and comprehensive way.\n\nThis MOOC is structured around four THEMES, in addition to a THEME 0 Introductory. Each THEME has modules and lessons consisting of texts, images, videos and quizzes.\n\nTHEME 1. Framing the archaeological risk\n\nTHEME 2. Monitoring the archaeological risk\n\nTHEME 3. Investigating the archaeological risk\n\nTHEME 4. Case-studies in archaeological risk\n\nCertificate of Accomplishment\n\nThe Certificate of Accomplishment will be released to anyone who has successfully completed the course by answering correctly to at least 60% of the questions by the end of the edition.\n\nYou will be able to download the Certificate of Accomplishment directly on the \"Progress\" tab inside the course.\n\nThe Certificate of Accomplishment does not confer any academic credit, grade or degree.\n\nCourse Professors\n\nNicolò Marchetti\n\nNicolò Marchetti is Full Professor of Archaeology of the Ancient Near East at the Department of History and Cultures (DiSCi) of the University of Bologna.
