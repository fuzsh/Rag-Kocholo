Before reaching the bridge go uphill, taking the first left past The Fighting Cocks public house to continue up cobbled South Street to reach Quarryheads Lane. Here, turn left and walk for a few minutes to reach a roundabout. Turn right here, going up Potters Bank until reaching Elvet Hill Road on the left.

Please note that this is a hilly route, which takes approximately 25-30 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, at Framwellgate Bridge, just before crossing the bridge, take the steps down to the riverbank path and follow the scenic riverside path up to Prebend's Bridge. Here, turn right up the hill and then left at the stone cottage. Continue through the white gate to reach the roundabout and then continue as above."
