        "text": "Tired of seemingly endless exams? Interested in exotic Korean culture and foods? If you are, Oriental Museum might be a perfect place for you to visit this and next week. From 18th to 31st of May, The Oriental Museum will be celebrating two-week programs of events and various activities about Korea, including traditional Korean martial arts Taekwondo demonstration, film showings, cultural lectures, and several family activities!\n\nFor those who have been deeply interested in Korean culture such as K-Pop and foods, the events will indubitably the best opportunity for you to know further about Korea. The unique cultural heritage and traits span way beyond the boundaries of those rather well-known parts of Korean culture – Movies and dramas to name a few. You will be astonished to learn how peculiar and independent culture does this small country have.\n\nSituated geographically in between two big countries – China and Japan, Korea has been considered by some to share most of the characters with the two counties. This is partially true, but Korea boasts some different cultural aspects that clearly make Korea more Korea-ish. By attending some of the programs you find fascinating, you will be able to savors and experience Korean art, music, and literature.\n\nAs a Korean myself, I have always been enthralled by its history and literature. There is some distinct, hard-to-describe-in-words sentiment that can only be understood and felt in Korean culture, and I hope some of you can to a certain extent, if not fully, enjoy the events and share your experience with others.\n\nI can guarantee that every single event hold on that time period is absolutely positively going to be amazing, and for sure a great chance not to be missed!\n\nFor more details and further information, visit Durham University Oriental Museum website or click the link below:\n\nhttps://www.dur.ac.uk/oriental.museum/whatson/events/koreafestival/\n\nSee you soon!\n\nInhoo\n\nCheck out my student ambassador page here.\n\nTop 3 Hidden Gems in County Durham\n\nWhile many students find themselves stuck in the so-called ‘Durham bubble’, it is often because they have yet to discover the many (relatively) unknown places outside of Durham City where the main university campus is located. Over the past few years, I managed to discover quite a number of exciting places and have chosen to share a few of my favourites with you today.\n\n#1 Shincliffe Wood\n\nJust a mere half an hour walk from Durham City is the quaint little village of Shincliffe. Situated just off Maiden Castle, Shincliffe is a miniature Durham to me, save for the absence of students and Tesco. Yet, this lack of hustle and bustle is why Shincliffe proves to be a lovely getaway.\n\nShincliffe Wood is an easy one-hour walking route, interjected with photo-taking sessions of the bluebells and wild garlic flowers that blossom in spring. This is a good, refreshing break from exams, stress, or the dread of summatives. My friends and I visited the place in May to take refuge from the horror of exam revision. Not only was it safe, but the path was obvious and clear for us to navigate through. Furthermore, the occasional fisherman and dog-walkers passing by are sure to stop by for a chat.\n\nWhen you’ve decided you had enough of a workout, you can retreat to the cozy garden centre for tea and cake. Brambles Café serves a delightful array of cakes, scones and tea. However, one must not forget that it is after all a garden centre, so it sells all your gardening necessities as well as quirky gifts. My best buy was a pizza clock!\n\nOverall, Shincliffe promises a good workout, a guilt-free slice of cake (if you did walk) and some retail therapy.\n\nBeautiful bluebells in full bloom\n\nThe walking path\n\n#2 Finchale Priory\n\n#tbt to Durham in the 13th century, Finchale Priory was a priory (monastery) founded on the site of a retired pirate’s hermitage (basically a hideout for pirates). While this sounds very ancient and foreign, it then became known as a holiday retreat for monks of Durham Cathedral that I’m sure everyone reading this should know of. Today, Finchale Priory is a tourist attraction that anyone can visit.\n\nI discovered this rather obscure attraction when I decided to go for a little adventure with my college hiking society last year. Although it was quite a few hours walk away from college, the time spent chatting with old friends and making new ones was definitely not wasted. The remains of the old priory are no less fascinating sight to behold compared to the famous Durham Cathedral. It reveals more about the old County Palatinate of Durham and is definitely a place that would interest anyone interested in history or even photography.\n\nAfter the long walk there, we were also pleasantly surprised to find a little snack shop where we could grab a bite to recharge for the return hike to college. If you fancy a journey back to ancient Durham, Finchale Priory is definitely a place worth visiting!\n\nRemains of the old priory\n\n#3 Beamish Museum\n\nThe last place on my list an interesting outdoor museum that’s a short drive out of Durham City. This unique museum brings you back to the early 19th to 20th century by allowing you to step into what everyday life was like back then in Northeast England. Moreover, it brings a wide span of history to life – from the Georgian times up to the industrial revolution.\n\nThe preservation of elements of the past along with the re-enactment of life during those times by people working at the museum has basically created a time machine for us to travel back to see over a hundred years back! My favourite part was the opportunity to take the numerous forms of transportation around the museum. From tramways to trolleybuses and even steam railways, the variety of vehicles collected and used by the museum is very impressive indeed.\n\nIf you don’t own a car or are turned away by the cost of taking a taxi there and back, there are also direct buses from Durham City. Moreover, there is a special ticket price for students valid for an entire year, which is definitely value for money.\n\nThe museum also changes up its exhibition and puts on special events based on the season so it’s definitely worth visiting them at various times around the year with your ticket. I’ve personally been there twice, once in summer and once in autumn/winter and am planning another trip before my ticket expires.\n\nTo have such a special museum in the vicinity is definitely something worth taking advantage of!\n\nNewcastle Corporation Tramways\n\nColliery Village\n\nLive music by a street organist\n\nI hope this list has inspired you to find more hidden gems around County Durham when you’re here. There are definitely a lot more beautiful and interesting places around the area that are waiting to be discovered!

There are lots of stunning places in Durham. Here’s my top 5…\n\nNo.1 –Flat White\n\nIf you are into coffee, as I am, you must visit Flat White in Durham (not the one in London!) A nice cup of Chai tea is no doubt ideal to kick start the week. However, remember not to visit there on Monday which I usually do. Cause it is closed\n\nNo.2 –The hill from Science Site to Psychology/ Biomedical Science building\n\nIf you are a psychology student, biomedical science student or you have to climb up the hill because you have lectures there. Please do pay attention to your surroundings, as you might find something stunning.\n\nThe Cherry Blossom (in April) is amazing, as I had never expected to see Cherry Blossom in Durham, or even in the United Kingdom.\n\nNo.3 Bridges\n\nKingsgate Bridge is the bridge that links the Bailey to the Science Site area (or DSU). Be careful when you walk across it in winter, it will be very slippery there! However, it is a very great spot to see the changes of Durham among seasons with Durham Cathedral as the background.\n\nThe ‘Town Bridge’\n\nI actually do not know what is the name of the bridge, so I just call it “The Town Bridge”. It is the largest bridge in town.\n\nThere are quite a lot of traditional bridges in Durham. Perhaps because I come from a city, where bridges don’t look like this. Therefore I think Durham is so special!\n\nNo.4 Cathedral\n\nThe Cathedral is no doubt the most remarkable building in Durham.This historical building provides opportunities for us to see what churches 1000 years ago looked like ! Don’t miss this place if you visit Durham .\n\nNo.5 Infinity Bridge\n\nIf you are studying at Queen’s Campus, you will also have a lovely bridge and river area in Stockton – the Infinity Bridge. This bridge is the fastest way to let you come across Castle Gate and to school. And at night there will be lights illuminating the bridge as well and reflecting beautifully along the river.\n\nHope you enjoyed my favourite spots!\n\nAlyse,\n\nSee my student ambassador page here.\n\n54.775250 -1.584852\n\nBeing an international student does not mean that you will miss one of the biggest holidays in your country, Lunar New Year. On the 23rd of February, students at Trevelyan College organised a Lunar New Year event (though I still could not figure out why on Monday when the New Year had been the Thursday before) for people craving Asian foods, traditional games, and a brief time off from loads of summatives.\n\nThe atmosphere was lively and I could see so many people enthusiastically trying to taste a bit of Asian culture, by trying calligraphy, wearing traditional clothes, and having exotic teas and drinks. What made me even more surprised was that not only did I see undergraduates and postgraduates during the events, but I could also meet one of my seminar tutors who used to teach us when I was a fresher a year ago, and two lecturers from the Business School! They warmly greeted me with hospitality and offered me a drink.\n\nBeautifully embellished with decorative ornaments, the surroundings were really worthy of attention, and I am pretty sure others felt exactly the same way as I did. Japan-themed sakura (Cherry blossom) and the red poster that reads ‘fu’(fortune) contributed to my feeling that I was having an authentic Lunar New Year.\n\nThroughout the night, there were a number of performers in the middle of the dining hall to keep people entertained. Dancers, singers, DJ, and a lot more showed their skills to make the event even more enjoyable. I, myself, was one of the performers to show up on the stage. See below pic 🙂\n\nHave you ever felt lonely during Lunar New Year or other big traditional/ national holidays? Well, there’s no need for worries. Durham is a place where you can feel like home. Of course, some of you might think that it would be better if you could go back home and celebrate the big day with your loved ones. However, why not try this amazing students-organised event while you are studying in Durham? 😀\n\nWrite again soon, Inhoo x\n\nSee my student ambassador page here.\n\n54.775250 -1.584852\n\nUs first years have come a long way since matriculation. As the Epiphany term comes to an end, I’ve found myself reflecting on the memories I’ve made after moving to Durham. It has been beyond amazing. Although grades in first year don’t count towards your degree, there is still a good amount of studying and assignments to do, regardless of your field of study.\n\nMy mind has been given quite the workout, and there have been times where I might have slipped into sleep in a cozy corner in the library, in between devouring books. However, this is nicely balanced with some of the many wonderful things the university, colleges and Students’ Union all have to offer. So far, nice little study breaks come in the form of everything from student salsa dance lessons to day trips out of town, my favorite of which was to the Edinburgh Christmas Market.\n\nWhether it be a night out for dinner and dancing, or snuggling up in your room with friends and flatmates to watch Harry Potter, you’re bound to have a good time. I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the amount of interesting people I’ve met here in less than a year. For example, one of my best friends is Indian but his home is in the Seychelles. His mom and dad came over for a visit last term and cooked up the most amazing feast for us, fit for kings. We even got to learn a few words in his and his parents first language, Tamil. Another friend of mine lived in Zimbabwe for part of last year and has the most enchanting stories from her home away from home, and my Northern Irish friend puts me in stitches every time he talks of his funny experiences working on a farm outside of Belfast, while he casually whips up homemade potato bread. I’ve had, and am having, the time of my life here. This is where I’ve made some of my best friends and have laughed so hard that I’m virtually certain I’d have a 6-pack by now if it weren’t for that marvelous thing that is Urban Oven, a pizza joint that essentially creates deliciously affordable magic. Not only is Durham University an incredible place to study, but this small town also has a big selection of distractions for whenever you might need it. It has the perfect balance between work and play, and now that I’m here, I can’t imagine being anywhere else.\n\nUntil next time my friends,\n\nDee x\n\nBeing in Durham means that you’re a mere 15 minutes train ride away from St James’ Park, home of Premier League club Newcastle United. After hearing many (tall?) tales of the legendary Newcastle United from my Geordie housemate who is a huge fan of the team, I finally got to see them play against Burnley on the first day of 2015.\n\nFootball selfie with my flatmate before the match!\n\nNew Year’s Day in the North East is quite similar to everywhere else in the world with most of the city hungover from the previous night’s festivities. Although many shops were closed and the city’s public transport was not in operation, we were fortunately still able to grab lunch at Eldon Square before the game. Since it was in the midst of our Christmas break, we also got to catch up on how we spent the holiday season.\n\nThis being my first time watching a Newcastle United game, my dear housemate bought us Newcastle United scarves to show our support for the team. Armed with our black and white scarves, we entered the stadium and got seated at a prime location that’s just a few rows away from the pitch! It was interesting to see the various pre-match activities going on: little ballboys being brought in and allocated positions, magpie mascots coming around taking photos with little children and the players warming up with some kicks and dribbles.\n\nMagpie mascots making their rounds!\n\nOnce the game began it surely did not disappoint! Newcastle United was on to a good start when they scored their first goal at the 15-minute mark. The action-packed game saw the ball zoom into the net quite a number of times, one of which even being an own goal. What was most memorable was the atmosphere of the crowd; the consistent fluctuation of emotions from waves of fury to boisterous cheers. The amount of shouting and swearing (though I couldn’t quite understand most of it under the thick Geordie accent) was insane. This was quite a surreal experience for me as being at the grounds is very different from watching it live on television.\n\nAlthough the game ultimately ended in a draw of 3-3 with Burnley scoring a late goal minutes before the end of the game, I was thoroughly impressed by the skills and stamina of each player on the field. To be able to constantly run around such a huge green pitch (the size of which is so misleading on television!) while strategizing and skillfully passing the ball around is truly the art of footballers.\n\nI later found out from my housemate that we were caught on camera for the BBC’s Match of the Day that airs the game’s highlights, though my face was blocked by one of the players. All in all it was a wonderful start to my year to be in a place overflowing with energy and excitement!\n\nBy Kelley (visit my Ambassador page)\n\nI was self-catered in my first year since I love to cook, which is partly why I chose St. Cuthbert’s Society as my college. However, before coming to Durham, I was worried about what kind of food I could buy and what I would be eating at University.\n\nAfter arriving at University, I found that Durham has amazing and fresh local produce, with lots of variety! I like to go to the local supermarket, the Indoor Market and the greengrocers on North Road to shop for food. There’s even a Chinese supermarket where I usually buy dumplings and tofu! I make it sort of like a fun trip that I look forward to every week!\n\nI never feel starved as a student (which I was definitely what I was primarily concerned about before coming to Durham) and have found friends from student halls in the first year who love food as well, who I also happen to be living with this year!\n\nMy flat mates and I occasionally have meals together. For example, recently my flat mate (and International Student Ambassador) Alyse made a delicious lamb pot for us!\n\nLamb pot prepared by Alyse (another International Student Ambassador)\n\nI certainly miss home less when I visit the Chinese supermarket and cook comfort food that I usually eat at home! For example, I often make steamed egg, which is really simple to prepare and cook!\n\nHomemade Chinese steamed egg\n\nFor Chinese New Year, we plan to have a hotpot dinner and dim sum in Newcastle, which is only a 15-minute train away from Durham.\n\nI also love going to food-related events hosted by the Anglo-Japanese Society, where we had the chance to make sushi and chicken skewers, and the Baking Society.\n\nThere are also lovely cafes and restaurants in and around Durham with many different cuisines. A friend from my course and I have made it a challenge to try out as many different cafes/restaurants as possible! We usually go after lectures as a treat and so far, we’ve found that we like Treats the most!\n\nBy Jessica (visit my Ambassador page)\n\nDrumming and singing at the same time might sound difficult to some people who might worry about their musical aptitude, talent, as well as how good their voice is, but you don’t have to worry in African singing and drumming – all you need is a sense of fun!\n\nYou can just join in clapping, dancing, singing or mumbling to the music, the rhythm will blend you, and when everyone joins in the music just happens, it’s natural and automatic.\n\nIt was not until my friend joined the African Singing and Drumming Society in Durham that I knew about it. After the first practice, it was obvious how excited she was, “Everyone was so lovely and friendly, I did not expect each of us would sing this loud like no one was around, start to join in the harmonies dancing, clapping. The atmosphere was fabulous, relaxing, I will definitely go to every single practice, it will be my two hours break from work!” And she did, she was never late for practice.\n\nIt was so hard for me to believe a girl like my friend, who had deadlines every week and was always complaining about a lack of time, would go every week. Nevertheless, I understood when I went to a concert last term – The Korogocho Concert. It was organised by the Gospel Society and African Singing and Drumming Society in Durham, and they performed the best vocal harmonised music ever 🙂 🙂\n\nIf you are a jazz or blues music fan, you’ll probably like African music, as it has similar rhythms. Apart from the music part, you might wonder whether with all of the hundreds of the languages of Africa, how would you be able to learn, to understand, and to memorise the lyrics of the songs. We are, yet, lucky enough to know that it is not a problem at all. Remember what I said, about the requirement for African Singing and Drumming? – All you need is a sense of fun and joy.\n\nAbout Durham African Singing and Drumming Society:\n\nBorn in 2007, they perform songs from East, Central and South Africa in languages including Tswana, Suthu, Zulu, Kiswahili, Luo, Digo, Girtama, Luhya and Lingala. Combining vocal harmonies with rhythms of the djembe drum and other types of percussion, they have practice twice a week. Every Saturday and Wednesday. Wednesdays 7pm-8pm\n\nSaturdays 6.30pm-7.30pm\n\nFacebook page: Durham University African Singing and Drumming Society\n\nYouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU3rpMCmz9I3FUFceBs93tA?feature=guide\n\nBy Alyse (visit my Ambassador page)\n\nAs an international ambassador at Durham University, I have had the chance to talk to many international students. Some of the students choose to contact me on WeChat and weibo instead of Facebook, and I have tried my best to provide the accurate feedback and answer prospective international students from China.\n\nThe general studying experience in Durham is simply amazing. Durham is a smaller place compared to all of the global cities and state capitals which many students might know. The small scale of Durham makes it easy to get around, and all the major teaching facilities are within walking distance no matter where people live. Some people from Southern China have repeatedly asked me about the weather in Durham, and they have expressed their fair share of concerns about the temperatures in winter. Here, I want to illustrate that the weather in Durham is lovely in most part, and people only feel a bit uncomfortable between the middle of December and the middle of January. Besides this, the weather in Durham is quite lovely, and you could certainly do outdoor activities without too much worry.\n\nDuring my last few months in Durham, I have been to amazing lectures in the Castle and Cathedral; I have the chance to join in many volunteering activities in the University and help others; I have the opportunities to make a lot of different friends from all over the globe and I have access to the educational resources in one of the best universities in the UK. I am satisfied with my experience in Durham, and I would recommend any international student studies in Durham and becomes a part of this amazing family. Anyone who has more questions about Durham can contact me as soon as they are in need of first hand accurate information about Durham. For those students from mainland China, people could add me on weibo or WeChat to stay in touch. At last, I genuinely hope that my wonderful experience in Durham can help any prospective international student to understand better about this beautiful university.\n\nBy Mingyu Lui (visit my Ambassador page)"
