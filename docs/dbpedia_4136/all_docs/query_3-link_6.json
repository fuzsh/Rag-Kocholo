        "text": "Nicky’s lecture was about a lesser known period in the development of Tell Nabasha in the North East of the delta. Usually thought of as a Late Period/Ptolemaic site, there is significant evidence dating back to the 18th dynasty, mainly in the form of royal and private statuary.\n\nThe site has had different names. Flinders Petrie called it Nebese but its ancient name was imt or Imet, and it was the capital of the imt-peHu nome. Initial exploration by Jean Jacques Rifaud in 1825 led to his discovery of a red granite shrine of Amasis II, of Dynasty 26. Petrie, with FL Griffith, began work there in 1886, attracted by tales of a ‘big stone’, a monolithic shrine, but found few other above ground structures. Petrie’s initial plan of the site shows a cemetery, temple and town but all that remains today are small areas of the temple and town; the rest is covered in modern buildings. Petrie concluded that the temple was sacred to Wadjet, with the monolith being in a smaller temple dedicated to Min. After the workmen dug around the monolith they didn’t fill in the trench, which became waterlogged so the monolith collapsed and was largely destroyed.\n\nThe Ramesside sculptural material is associated with the entrance pylon of the temple and consists of reused blocks from the time of Ramesses II, possibly from Piramesse. Petrie also found a sphinx of Amenemhat III now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (BMFA). The material from Tell Nabasha was split between the BMFA, Cairo and the British Museum. Sculptural material from the Old and Middle Kingdoms had been reinscribed during the Ramesside period, including columns, sphinxes and a, now missing, offering table of Amenemhat II. Some 12th dynasty statues were also found, used as foundations in the smaller temple. Petrie had suggested there was a Middle Kingdom temple on the site but there is no evidence of this.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting piece was a block statue of the charioteer Merenptah. This was found by Griffith and sold to the Chautauqua Archaeological Museum in New York. When this was closed in 1905 and demolished in 1930, the collection vanished but the statue was sold by Sotheby’s in 1983 to a private collector. Images of it can be seen on the Sotheby’s website. Fortunately Griffith had copied the inscriptions, which tell us that the statue was a wrSy or ‘watchman’, a guardian of the temple. The phrase ‘I belong to Imet’ is found on the right side of the statue. Nicky constructed a speculative family tree from the names mentioned in the inscriptions to show a possible link with the site of Piramesse. He speculated that an elite Theban family had moved to the delta and possibly married into an elite family at Imet.\n\nNicky then moved on to the tombs at Tell Nabasha. The majority of the cemetery is Late Period, overlying or reusing earlier tombs. Made of mudbrick, the tombs collapsed causing Petrie to misdate some. A group of Ramesside tombs had multiple chambers and were rich in terms of finds, including shabtis, two Ramesside plates and ceramic coffins. In the central part of the cemetery were the ‘Cypriote’ tombs, so called because Petrie thought they contained the bodies of Cypriot mercenaries, mainly because the grave goods included Cypriot pottery, spearheads, forked spear butts but no shabtis. However, the pottery has close parallels with Palestinian/Philistine pottery and the spear butts are more likely to be the butts of staves. There are many theories about who is buried in these tombs but it may be that they are simply Ramesside Egyptians with imported artefacts.\n\nIn his summary Nicky concluded that the archaeology does suggest a Dynasty 18 settlement, and there is textual evidence for connections with Piramesse in Papyrii Anastasi II and IV.\n\nJean Barnett\n\nNicky Nielson is senior lecturer in Egyptology at the University of Manchester. He has long been interested in the eastern Delta and his lecture today was on the Ancient Egyptian settlement of Imet. There is some confusion around the modern name of Imet known as Tell Nabesheh and also known as Tell Farum. Some of the confusion coming after Petrie names the area Tell Nabesheh.\n\nThe settlement is located in the eastern Delta, close to Pi-Ramesse and may well have been part of the extended city limits. This is an important consideration given that it may well have attracted people relocating from Thebes and other areas to support the growing city of Pi-Ramesses.\n\nArchaeological excavations\n\nInitial exploration of the area was carried out by Jean Jaques Rifaud in 1825. An interesting character who was a deserter from the French army. He wrote about Imet in his travel discoveries publication in 1830 in which he mentions a red granite shrine of Amasis III.\n\nIn 1886 Petrie and Grifith excavate the area attracted by reports of a standing stone. Initially Peterie described this as a standing sarcophagus, it was in fact a standing shrine. Unfortunately due to a trench dug around the shrine during excavations the shrine later toppled and broke into several pieces. It was Griffiths that did the majority of the work at the site which included excavations of a cemetery and temple complex. This could help explain some of Petrie’s later interpretations about the site in his published accounts.\n\nA variety of sculptures were discovered from the Old and Middle Kingdoms which were later reworked during the Ramesside period. One of the most interesting statues was that of a Ramesside charioteer called Merenpatah. The figure is that of a crouching man and has inscriptions on the different sides. One of the inscriptions read ’I belong to Imet’ and information on Merenptah’s family and life are included. It appears that he came from a Theban military family and married into a local priest family. His wife was Ia who was connected with the local temple and described as ‘Mistress of Imet’. It is very likely that this duality of family ties was common for families relocating to the area to support the expanding city of Pi-Ramesses.\n\nTombs excavated in Imet\n\nTomb 35 is ascribed to be that of Pamerihu following the discovery of 2 shabtis bearing that name. He was the father of Merenptah\n\nMost late period tombs were probably older and were reused late period tombs. Built from mud brick they have not survived intact. One group of tombs, 3,5,7,and 8 were probably a family complex. They may have been, in fact, a single tomb with several sub chambers. These tombs revealed a number of small finds including shabtis. Most are found today in either the Boston Museum of Fine Art or the British Museum.\n\nSo called Cypriot Mercenary tombs number 1,2,14,17,18,24,26,29, and 33 were identified by Petrie as being different to other tombs excavated. There were no shabtis found but a number of spear heads, pottery and spear butts of non-Egyptian design were. Later studies have identified these finds as more probably Levantine origin and not Cypriot at all. It is also quite feasible that these were tombs of Egyptians which included items from foreign countries. Not an unreasonable proposal given the significant international trading activities and cosmopolitan nature of near-by Pi-Ramesse.\n\nConclusions about Imet were that\n\n· Archaeological evidence suggests activity from dynasty 18 and beyond.\n\n· Imet expanded at the same time as Pi-Ramesses during the establishment of the new dynasty and beginning of the Ramesside period.\n\n· Evidence links Pi-Ramesses and Imet and it is feasible that Imet was part of a larger city footprint supplying Pi-Ramesses as families relocated to the new state capital from other parts of Egypt.\n\nPaul Newby\n\nDr Franzmeier is director of the Pi-Ramesse project and has been for the last eight years. He took over from Edgar Pusch who was director from the 1980s and who sadly died recently.\n\nThe talk covered what and why Pi-Ramesses was and details recent archaeological investigations.\n\nWhat was Pi-Ramesse\n\nPi -Ramesses is in the north east of the Egyptian Delta, and at first glance it looks rather an odd place to build a capital city. However, during the Ramesside period in the 19th dynasty it’s location was very strategic, especially in relation to the wider Egyptian empire and the Levant. It was not a greenfield site and had previously been the capital of the Hyksos and was known as Avaris.\n\nPrior to the Ramesside city there had been a temple of Seth in Avaris. Seti I built a royal building, probably a palace of some kind, in the 19th dynasty. The city became the primary residence of Ramses II and it was where he returned to after the battle of Kadesh with his troops. There is some evidence of occupation into the 20th dynasty and beyond. However, very little is known what was going on after Rameses III. At some point in the 21st dynasty it appears the city was abandoned and that some of the stones from large buildings were removed and reused in the construction of Tanis.\n\nDiscovery of Pi-Ramesse\n\nDiscovery and initial exploration of Pi-Ramesse was mainly done by Egyptian Egyptologists. Ahmed Kamal Pasha , who is regarded as one of the first Egyptian Egyptologist was responsible for discovery of the city. However, it was Muhammad Hamza and Labib Habachi who initiated most of the work uncovering the city. In the 1980s Edgar Pusch started work on the site and continued for the next 35 years. The city was relatively unheard of prior to the first World War . However, purchase of some faience tiles by the Louvre following WW1 brought Pi-Ramesses to the attention of the wider world.\n\nWhat was Pi-Ramesses?\n\nBy the Ramesside period Pi-Ramesse was a major city . The city centre was 4 square kilometres and the wider city could have stretched as far as 250 square kilometres. This would make it a city on the scale of places such as Babylon, Thebes and Memphis.\n\nPi-Ramesse was a military stronghold, seat of government and a major trading and diplomatic hub.\n\nThe city had a key strategic location being less than one day’s travel from the Mediterranean coast and was also close to the Egyptian boarder with the Levant. It was an important centre for international diplomacy with large archival resources. Evidence has been found of stables for 400 to 500 horses. Not only a military headquarter, it may also have been an important naval base. Pi-Ramesses was very much the gateway to Egypt and as such would have had many impressive buildings reflecting its status and importance. It would have been a very cosmopolitan and wealthy place to be.\n\nWhy build a new capital?\n\nUndoubtably the strategic location had a big influence on the development of Pi-Ramesses. However, with the emergence of a new dynasty at the beginning of the Ramesside period it may have been felt important to make a break with the past. The transfer of power to the new dynasty required a break from the old elite . A new capital some distance from the previous centre of power would help with this transition in many ways. There may also have been a desire to open up Egypt to the wider world. The location of Pi-Ramesses to the Mediterranean and to the wider Egyptian empire would have facilitated this opening up and its development as a major international trading centre.\n\nRecent Archaeological Exploration\n\nA magnetic imaging project from 1996-2013 has helped map larger areas of the city with tantalising evidence of ancient buildings just beneath the surface. These include temples, royal buildings, large villas and more humble domestic dwellings.\n\nSince 2016 a large, in fact monumental, building has been excavated. It is similar in size to structures of other known Ramesside palaces and temples. It is a complex site with multiple layers including irrigation ditches, lime kilns and foundation trenches for large walls. Given the nature of the site most of the walls have gone. However, large foundation trenches lined with sand are evident and show the scale of the building they once supported. The building could very well have been a royal place and a significant one at that. Evidence of columns have been found, similar in size and scale to the palace of Merenptah in Memphis. There is some evidence of a much earlier royal building with remnants of plaster walls being found, some fragments with pigmentation and patters still visible.\n\nVery recently a drone survey has been carried out by a French TV crew who were filming in the area. It is very hard to get permission to undertake drone surveillance in Egypt. So it was lucky that the French group had permission and could extend their work to include aerial footage of the Pi-Ramesses archaeological site. This work has provided new data on the scale of the city and has also allowed the tracing of the ancient riverbanks. This is significant as the Nile does shift over time and it may be one of the reasons why the city was eventually abandoned due to silting up of the river.\n\nFor further information and an on-line exhibition of finds go to piramasse-exhibition.de and @quantirpiramesse2564\n\nPaul Newby\n\nBarbara started her talk by recalling the first mummy she ever saw as a child was Irtyru on a visit she made with her mother to the Great North Museum. This visit ignited a life-long interest in mummies . Barbara has seen many mummies over the intervening years however, she told us that, by far, her favourite mummy is ‘The Unknown Lady’ located in the Oriental Museum.\n\nThe Unknown Lady\n\nAs her name suggests very little is known about this mummy due to extensive water damage received in antiquity to any hieroglyphic inscriptions on the coffin as to the name , location or occupation of this mummy. Damage to the base of the foot and inside of the coffin is particularly bad and is where most of the information on the occupant would normally be found.\n\nThe Unknown Lady was discovered in 1880 by Gaston Maspero. It was sold in 1888 to buyers in Darlington. In the 1930’s the mummy may have been used to advertise the film by Boris Karloff of the same name when it came to the cinema in Darlington. By today’s standards this seems rather shocking and disrespectful. Fortunately, the mummy was loaned to the Durham Oriental museum in 1960 where she was put on displayed to the public. In 1999 the loan became permanent when the mummy was gifted to the museum where she resides today on display in the Thacker gallery.\n\nWhat is known about the mummy has come from various scientific and not so scientific studies of The Unknown Lady by various scientist and medics. Unfortunately, some of these studies have resulted in significant damage to the mummy itself. The torso in particular was badly damaged when it was cut open with a tenon saw. This was done to retrieve a rather unusual prosthetic arm which was buried with the mummy. The Unknown Lady is Ptolemaic and is an elderly woman, around 56 years old . This has been confirmed by various Xray studies and scans of the body. These studies have demonstrated that The Unknown Lady journeyed from a poor background to eventual wealth. Evidence in her bones, Harris lines, similar to shin splints, which demonstrate interruptions to her growth caused by a poor diet. Her health in general was poor. There is evidence of damage to teeth, quite common in Ancient Egypt due to the grit contained in bread which was a staple food. In addition, there were abscesses to her teeth. * ( Again, this type of abscess was very common in Ancient Egypt. Teeth abscesses were not only very painful but also potentially fatal as they could lead on to more serious life-threatening infections such as septicaemia and infectious endocarditis, which attacks the heart.) In addition, there is evidence of both kidney and gall stones, and osteoarthritis. The mummy also showed signs of a broken toe, damaged pelvis and slipped disk. However, these were very likely due to damage caused during the various examinations of the mummy.\n\nThe Brighton Mummy\n\nThis is the mummy of a little boy dating from the 1st century AD. which also is on display in the Oriental museum. It was auctioned by Sutherby’s in 1975 following liquidation of Angora antiques. It was sold for around £1500 to £2000 which in today’s money is £10,664.64 to £ 14,219.53. So pretty expensive in terms of acquisitions if purchased today. The mummy came to Durham in 1985 , to the Wolfson gallery, where it is on display today.\n\nThe body has been beautifully wrapped but the little boy has lost his cartonnage mask.\n\nExamination of the mummy originally estimated the age to be around 8-9 years old and 5 ft tall. There is evidence of scoliosis to the spine. Gold leaf was found around the mouth and nose. Further examination of the mummy in 1985 by home office pathologist Dr Edmand Tapp estimated the age to be between 8 to 15 years old and possibly negroid. The bones were in good order and CT scans showed that major organs had not been removed during mummification.\n\nAnimal mummies\n\nTwo animal mummies in Durham’s collection were discussed, namely a Jackal and a Cat mummy.\n\nThey come from the 26th dynasty and were possibly votive offerings. Xray studies have confirmed that the mummies both contain skeletons. It was sometimes the case that such offerings did not contain a mummifies animal.\n\nThe Jackal dimensions are 340mm (H), 62 mm (W), 100 mm (D) .\n\nThe cat 190 mm (H), 50 mm (W), 66 mm (D).\n\nOther mummies\n\nIn conclusion, Barabara briefly mentioned that other types of mummified human remains can be found outside of Egypt. In Rome the Capuchin monks developed a form of mummification and buried bodies of monks in a catacomb. *( A similar catacomb can be found also in Palermo in Scilly and includes the bodies of the wealthy inhabitants of the city from the 19th century . The last mummy being that of a young child in the 1920s. The practise has now been stopped. )\n\nIn Denmark the preserved remains of Skrydstrup woman from the 1300 BC and Peruvian mummies from the high Andes were briefly discussed.\n\n*Added by author post lecture\n\nPaul Newby\n\n‘There was Light- Amenhotep III and His Dazzling World’, by Rachel Barclay and Penny Wilson\n\nRachel began our study day with an overview of the exhibition currently running at the Oriental Museum in Durham. Although the exhibition is a celebration of the 100th anniversary of the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun, it showcases objects from across the 18th dynasty rather than any relating to Tutankhamun in particular. This was a period of military expansion and trading ventures, a period of stability that enabled a flowering of the arts. Rachel showed pictures of a number of objects in the exhibition including statues, a decorated box, vessels made of travertine and blue glass, and cosmetic implements made of imported elephant ivory. In this period the depiction of the human form adopted a more sensuous style, with statues having elongated torsos and more detail on faces and wigs. Two notable items in the exhibition are part of a cult statue of Amenhotep III, with a gold collar and detailed blue glazed kilt, and a small but beautiful boxwood statue of a servant girl holding a jar. This latter piece is well-known, having featured some years ago in the BBC series ‘A History of the World in 100 Objects’.\n\nPenny continued the lecture by focussing on one object- a stele of Akhenaten found in 1909 at Buhen. Its subject is a campaign in Nubia to protect the gold mines from attack by local tribes. Shortly after its discovery the stele was sent to Pennsylvania. In the salvage operation at Buhen in 1962, part of the Aswan dam project, a number of objects were distributed to Cairo and the supporting institutions, one of which was the Gulbenkian Museum (as the Oriental Museum was then known). Our museum received some fragments that are part of the 1909 stele, and these are part of the exhibition, mounted together with a reconstruction of the text.\n\nThis talk was an excellent introduction to the exhibition in general and to one display in particular. Do make some time to visit the Oriental Museum and see these pieces. The exhibition runs until 21st May 2023.\n\n‘The Modern Resurrection of Tutankhamun’ by Aidan Dodson\n\nAidan joined our study day via zoom to talk about Tutankhamun, but not about the discovery of his tomb. His theme was how Tutankhamun has emerged from obscurity to become a recognised figure. He was probably the son of Akhenaten, who by the time of his death had restored Egyptian religion to its traditional forms, but his memory was relegated to obscurity. His cartouche was erased from Talatat blocks from Amarna reused at Karnak. He is absent from the Abydos King list, which jumps straight from Amenhotep III to Horemheb, and Manetho’s list has no Amarna kings at all. The erasure of Tutankhamun was compounded by the decline in the use of hieroglyphic script and the Arab conquest of Egypt in the seventh century that formed a watershed between the past and the present. After this point, scholars were limited to Classical sources, which they assumed to be accurate.\n\nThe next turning point was the discovery of the Rosetta stone in 1822 and the work of Champollion, but it was not until the 1850s that scholars were really able to read hieroglyphs. However, much effort was expended in trying to reconcile the new material with the classical sources rather than vice versa. The next significant step was the work of John Gardner Wilkinson, who discovered the tomb of Amenhotep-Huy, TT40, with its damaged but readable representations of Tutankhamun. By inspectiing cartouches of Amenhotep III and Tutankhamun on the Prudhoe lions from Gebel Barkal, Wilkinson also realised that Tutankhamun’s name was missing from the Abydos king list.\n\nIn subsequent decades of the 19th century more data came to light. In 1840 Prise D’Avennes noted blocks from Amarna reused in the second pylon at Karnak. In 1854 Lepsius attempted a reconstruction of the descendants of Amenhotep III. Mariette found canopic jars with Tutankhamun’s name on them in the Serapeum. In the 1890s Petrie found a vase of Tutankhamun at Gurob. During this period there were still doubts about Tutankhamun’s relationship to Amenhotep III and the prevailing view was that he must have attained the throne through marriage into the royal family.\n\nThe early 20th century saw discoveries made by Theodore Davies including gold foil showing a smiting scene from KV58 that led him to propose this as Tutankhamun’s burial place. Of course it was the discovery of KV 62 in 1922 by Howard Carter that brought Tutankhamun to the notice of the world at large. Aidan touched briefly on the excavation and pointed out that although a wealth of objects came out of the tomb, very little new data emerged. He also touched on the subsequent damage to the mummy at some point between when it was put back into the tomb at the end of the excavation, and 1968 when it was taken out again for re-examination.\n\nFinally, Aidan reminded us of the stories of mysterious curses that have proliferated after the death of Lord Carnarvon, and noted that, to this day, there is no consensus on Tutankhamun’s cause of death.\n\n‘After Amarna: temple Restorations under the Reign of Tutankhamun and Beyond’, by Jun Wong\n\nIn our third lecture Jun concentrated on the topic of erasure. Akhenaten had erased images of the traditional gods, so Tutankhamun was faced with the task of restoring them. But Tutankhamun’s own inscriptions were then erased by subsequent pharaohs. For example, Horemheb damaged the images of both his two predecessors. So this causes a certain confusion when we look at these images. Tutankhamun’s Restoration stele refers to neglected temples and his actions in restoring them, initiating a new age but it makes no mention of Akhenaten or his religious policies.\n\nMost of Jun’s examples came from Hatshepsut’s temple at Deir el Bahri. She, of course, reigned over a century before Tutankhamun but images of her were erased in the same way. Jun showed us several examples of where some areas of the temple walls had been left empty; nothing had been restored apart from the name of Amun-Re, sometimes around a sun disk, even if his name had not been there originally. Images of the gods have been restored, sometimes more precisely than others, and in some examples we were able to see how figures had been moved closer together to disguise the gap left by the missing figure of Hatshepsut. Jun noted that the restoration can be haphazard: the restored parts may not fit the proportions of the original scene or they may be superimposed on text. In the text itself, the name of Hatshepsut is erased and the name of Amun-re filled in rather than the name of another person.\n\nJun went on to talk about the process of restoration, showing us images of red markings that would indicate to the restorers what to work on. In terms of technique, sunken reliefs are easier to restore, as the stone can be shaved off, but raised relief is more difficult because areas of stone may need to be cut back to some depth. Occasionally a damaged area has been filled plaster, such as the scene of the Ennead in the middle portico, where white plaster can be seen clearly against the original stonework.\n\nFinally, Jun made the point that given the different layers of damage and restoration it can be difficult to differentiate what was done and when, not least because there are inconsistencies in how much stone was removed.\n\nJean Barnett\n\nThe Burial Chamber Wall Paintings in the tomb of Tutankhamun from creation to conservation\n\nLori Wong (Getty Conservation Institute, California)\n\nLori is a PhD student at Durham. She is a conservator of wall paintings and talked to us about a ten year project, 2009-2019, by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities and the Getty Conservation Institute in California.\n\nWe were reminded that the environment of the Valley of the Kings is arid, dry and dusty and this has determined the preservation of the wall paintings in the burial chamber.\n\nThe wall paintings were dismissed by Howard Carter as being “rough, conventional and severely simple”, but Lori thinks this is a harsh view.\n\nThere are paintings on all four walls. The east wall is meant to be viewed first and then you view the rest, counter-clockwise. The east wall depicts Tutankhamun’s body being pulled on a sledge by twelve mourning figures. Ay (as Osiris) is carrying out the opening of the mouth ceremony on the north wall, and Nut is welcoming the king into the underworld. Twelve baboons representing the twelve hours of night appear on the west wall. On the south wall, Tutankhamun stands before Hathor, with Anubis behind him.\n\nOn 19 August 2009 the Telegraph published an interview with Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s then head of antiquities, who warned that humidity and fungus, caused by visitor’s breath, were eating into the walls of the royal tombs. In response, several tombs would be closed and visitors would only be able to visit replicas (www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/6053123/Pharaohs-tombs-could-disappear-in-150-years.html). The condition of the paintings and the nature of the threat to them had to be better understood. Hence the need for the project.\n\nLori told us that visitors do have an impact. Moisture is created from sweat (but fluctuations in humidity in summer are also detrimental as the paintings require a stable environment) and visitors touch the walls and bring dust into the tombs on the clothing.\n\nBrown spots (a micro-organism) cover all the surfaces in the tomb. These were studied by Havard University and they were found to be dead and will not continue to grow. The micro-organism (which was impossible to exactly identify) grew soon after the tomb was sealed. The brown spots are therefore not caused by modern visitors. The brown spots were not removed by conservators because they are embedded into the paintings. Also, they are ancient and this is the only tomb that has them. Can it be argued that the brown spots themselves have archaeological value?\n\nVarious non-invasive techniques were employed to study the wall paintings including x-ray diffraction, x-ray fluorescence, infrared, ultraviolet radiation sources and visible induced luminescence (VIF). Limited samples were taken, with permission, in order for cross sections of the decoration to be analysed.\n\nA coarse earthen plaster was found to have been used to fill holes. Above that was a fine buff-coloured clay-based plaster, which was applied wet. Repairs had been made using grey plaster made of gypsum. On top of the plaster, on all walls apart from the south, there was a ground layer of white huntite. A yellow background was then painted on all of the walls, apart from the north, where the figures were painted first and then the yellow background was painted around them. Restorations carried out in the 1930s showed up using VIF and infrared. Extra brown spots had actually been added to blend in the restorations!\n\nA grid had been set out on the walls, in order to proportion the human figures. The conventional 18 square grid was used on the north wall, and the Amarna 20 square grid was used on the south wall.\n\nWe can only speculate about why the four walls were treated differently – were different people working on different walls? Were the walls decorated at different times? The tomb was, after all, finished in a hurry.\n\nVarious conservation interventions have now been put in place to help stabilise the wall paintings. Walkways and barriers prevent visitors from touching the walls, but at the same time provide them with a better view. A ventilation system was installed to extract carbon dioxide and sweat and remove the damaging fluctuation in humidity. Dust is reduced by closing the door at the entrance, and a metal grille captures the dust on visitors’ shoes. There is continuous monitoring of the wall paintings.\n\nIn 2014 the Factum Foundation for Digital Technology in Conservation produced a high-resolution 3D replica of the burial chamber, as seen in 2009, including cracks, pitting and dust. This is on display at Howard Carter’s mudbrick house, 3km away. The idea being, in 2009, that the tomb might be closed and tourists would visit the replica instead.\n\nTut's Tomb: A Replica Fit for a King (nationalgeographic.com)\n\nLori concluded by telling us that the greatest threat to the tomb is flooding, not tourists. The last flash flood was in 1994. Work is being done on flood control in the Valleys of the Kings and Queens.\n\nA fascinating lecture.\n\nJennifer Morrison\n\nKatja is an expert on the Pyramid Texts. Her talk discussed the beauty of sunlight and radiance and its connection with the regalia and power of the king.\n\nKatja’s first slide was an image of Seti I wearing a Henu (ostrich feather) crown with 8 uraei snakes on it. The snakes spit fire to defend the wearer. They represent light, fire and flame and wear gold and red discs.\n\n‘Divine Light in Egypt in Mesopotamia’ was a project at the University of Toronto between 2008 and 2013. Katja asked how divine was the king of Egypt? From the Old Kingdom, the king was thought to descend from the sun god. The myth of the divine birth of the king was popular from the time of Hatshepsut in the 18th dynasty, and possibly as early as the 5th dynasty. The king was thought to be the physical descendant of the god. Hatshepsut legitimised her reign by claiming that Amun took the form of her mother’s husband, Thutmose I, held the ankh to the Queen’s nose and conceived her.\n\nHatshepsut described herself as youthful and divine:\n\n‘Looking at her was more beautiful than anything (else). Her form was as (that of) a god. Her character was as (that of) a god. Her effectiveness was as (that of) a god. When her Majesty had become a beautiful young woman, it was Wadjit (the uraeus snake that spit fire), who is in her moment (of rage), who made her divine shape majestic’.\n\nIn The Tale of Sinuhe B252, Senwosret I was described as ‘God beneath a canopy of electrum’; the ‘likeness of Ra’.\n\nOn the Karnak Stele, Khaneferre-Sobekhotep IV was described as ‘Perfect God, likeness of Ra, Golden One…. Like Ptah-Sokar, a Lord of radiance….. like the sun disc’.\n\nDuring the Old Kingdom, kings were described as ‘divine sons’. For instance, on the Karnak Stela, Ahmose is described as ‘Likeness of Re, offspring of Re, who illuminates the kingship’. And on the small Sphinx Stela, Amenhotep II is ‘the image of Atum, Perfect God, likeness of Re, offspring of Harakhte’.\n\nDuring the Amarna period, Akhenaten said he was the ‘luminous child’ or the ‘little one’ of the Aten. He claimed to be descended from the sun god. One of Aya’s hymns reads ‘May you (Aten) form him in the morning like your own manifestations, may you build him in your image, like Aten’. His divine status was proven by depicting him the same size as the god. And because he and the god touched, he was endorsed by the god as his legitimate heir.\n\nThe name Tutankhamen means the living image of Amun.\n\nKings were also shown as divine by being depicted in animal (theriomorphic) form, being super human and strong. Common animals were lions, hawks and a winged sphynx. Statues, like a human head on a falcon body (Louvre E5351), show the king as a falcon, or part falcon. Both Horus and Re were falcons.\n\nThe animal link can also be read in the texts:\n\n‘Lion of the rulers, Thutmose III angered like a divine falcon’.\n\nKatja went on to tell us about the paraphernalia associated with the king. At their coronation the king became the deputy of god on earth and the god bestowed trappings on the king. These include the crown – Hatshepsut is crowned with a blue crown by Re. The blue crown with twirly uraei was used by the king so they looked like a god. The icons on the Henu crown represent sunrise from the Book of the Dead, so the king is being portrayed as a solar deity.\n\nThere are also lunar associations. Seti I said he was the ‘moon of the lands’ and that his father Ramesses was a Ra emitting rays and he was ‘a star at his side’. Kings were equated with shooting stars – Prince Osorkon was described on the battlefield like a shooting star. Kings were described as fire. Flames defeat enemies. The fire initially came from cobras or the sun disc, but later from the king himself who has fiery breath like a cobra. In the tomb of Tutu there is an inscription which reads ‘the king’s arms are like the rays of the Aten’.\n\nThe king ruled the earth like the sun ruled the sky. There are many hieroglyphs for light terms, such as to shine and to glitter. Pre Amarna, the light refers to the sun disc. After Akhenaten the king himself illuminates. The king was described as being like harakhte (the sun that rises from the horizon – i.e. the morning sun). Light leads to beauty (nfrw). Quotations relating to beauty and light include – ‘beauty is radiant’, ‘sparkling beauty’. ‘The king illuminates the land with his beauty’.\n\nThe word ‘shd’ means to illuminate, but also to elucidate, explain or enlighten. This is about enlightening minds. The king is wise, and so cures people of misunderstanding.\n\nThe final topic that Katja discussed was gold. Jewellery made the kings look sparkly like gods. When they died the kings have gold masks. The skin of a god was said to be gold. Hatshepsut was said to have skin of electrum. Amenhotep was the ‘mound of gold’. Ahmose was ‘a golden one’.\n\nJennifer Morrison\n\nPenny’s lecture was divided into two parts: an overview of her survey work in the Northern part of the Nile delta, followed by an update on the excavation at Sais. The survey was of eleven sites in the Kafr el Sheikh governorate, carried out for the Egypt Exploration Society. There are hundreds of sites in the area, which is dominated by waterways, but few are well-known. Many are Late Roman. Preliminary work consisted of collecting satellite images, mapping data and consulting old reports. This was followed by topographical surveys, pottery collection and recording, drill coring to reveal the geology of the settlements, magnetic mapping, and risk assessment. The latter is increasingly important, as sites may be threatened by modern development.\n\nPenny concentrated on six of the sites: Kom el Ahmar, Kom Kebir, Tell Tin, Tell Mansur, Tell Iniezi and Tell Landahur. A magnetic survey at Kom el Ahmar indicated sub-surface remains consisting of a raised platform and gouges that are possibly graves. Amphorae recovered from the site suggest a Late Roman date, and a large quantity of glass was found together with glazed pottery that may date from the 9th and 10th centuries CE. One of Penny’s photos showed a large mound of modern rubbish, a continuing threat to archaeological sites, as it contaminates the area and hiders excavation. The site of Kom Kebir, which has already been excavated by the Egyptian authorities, is close to where the Sebennytic branch of the Nile might have been, as indicated by drill cores that showed underlying clays. Again, Late Roman pottery was recovered dated to the 4th to 7th centuries CE. The site also has an unusual building with a labyrinth of passageways, a room plastered to resemble stone, and a room accessed via steps. One suggestion is that this may be a bathhouse.\n\nAccess was difficult at the site of Tell Tin, as it was in the area of a fish farm, with no roads! Magnetometry indicted a square feature, possibly a platform, underneath the mound. The site also yielded a lot of glass. There was evidence of Christian activity at Tell Manusr, as a church had been excavated by the Ministry of Antiquities. Magnetometry showed a rectangular enclosure around the church, so it may have been a monastic site. Magnetometry at the Ptolemaic site of Tell Iniezi indicated a lot of linear features and evidence of burning, possibly from kilns. Interesting finds here were an alabaster dish and a quantity of black Buto ware. Finally, Penny reported on the large site of Tell Landahur. Its 15m high mound is cut by a military post erected during the 6-day war in the 1960s. A quantity of Late Roman pottery was found, but perhaps the most striking thing about the site is the panoramic view from the mound, indicating its strategic location.\n\nIn the second part of the lecture Penny gave us an update on her work at Sais. The aim was to confirm the pattern of waterways around the site, using ERT (Electrical Resistivity Tomography). Remote sensing and satellite imagery shows water retention in the landscape and the evidence shows that the river moved westwards. Excavation revealed mud bricks, a possible enclosure wall and a temple building. In the Northern enclosure at Kom Rebwa earlier excavations had uncovered a structure with a column base and scattered pottery, including Canaanite amphorae, dating from the late 20th Dynasty to the 21st squashed on the structure’s floor. The aim for 2021/2 was to complete the excavation.\n\nThe pottery layer consisted of a mix of materials going back as far as the late Old Kingdom, indicating reuse in the rubble strengthening the brickwork of a wall under which the pottery layer continued. In order to deal with the mass of broken pottery the floor was divided into grids of 1m square, then the fragments were lifted from each grid layer by layer. The pieces were marked so they could be reconstructed later, after drying and cleaning. The pottery looked as if it had been smashed and thrown down arbitrarily. Other material found included cutting tools and lumps of bitumen. Grid 3 was particularly interesting, as it contained a quantity of beads under a meat jar, similar to beads found on top of the pottery layer during the 2019 season. In grid 6 a glass rod and pieces of faience, ivory and gold were found. Other work was carried out by Durham University students, who found a hair ornament, a Bes amulet and a wadjet eye.\n\nThis was a really absorbing lecture that gave an insight into the methods and some of the problems that lie behind archaeology in Egypt. It will be interesting to see whether, in Penny’s next update, the purpose of the pottery layer can be clarified.\n\nJean Barnett"
