        "text": "#7 Research Proposal\n\nObjects of Desire Research Proposal\n\nMy object of desire is the Replica Islamic Astrolabe, accession number: DUROM.2017.323\n\nInitial Description of Object\n\nIt is a replica Astrolabe created by ‘Hemisferium’, a specialist manufacturer in antique scientific instruments. It is based on an original piece by Diya’al Din Muhammad, who was part of a predominant family of astronomical instrument makers from Lahore.[1] The original piece was created in Lahore, Pakistan in 1647 whilst the replica was made in Madrid, Spain around 2016/17. The replica astrolabe is 180 mm (height) X 6mm (depth) X 120mm (width).\n\nThe astrolabe is an astronomical instrument made from cast metal which was originally used to measure angles, the altitude from the horizon to the celestial space, and for navigation purposes by helping to identify constellations to determine your location and the direction you were heading. Although, some Astrolabe specialists argue it has hundreds of uses.\n\nContext\n\nThis concept was integrated into the Islamic faith when they inherited texts and technology from the Greeks, as they were going to be destroyed by the Christians who saw the technology as heathen. The navigational concept of astrolabes was adopted into the Islamic faith to help Muslims find the Qibla, the direction of Mecca, especially whilst they were travelling.\n\nThis piece isn’t simply a scientific instrument, but also a masterpiece of art and design with intricate carvings on the ‘rete’, the decorative netting overlay, which is designed with Arabic and Latin script and numbers which encapsulates the Greek and Islamic cultures its evolved from.\n\nRationale for Choice\n\nI wanted to choose an object which stood out to me, or ‘spoke’ to me in a way. I have always had a fascination with celestial space – galaxies, nebulas, the solar system. One of my Art & Design A Level projects centred on this topic and I have always been curious of how outer space has been used for scientific purposes through the decades and in different cultures. As an English Literature student, I have not had the opportunity to learn about such scientific objects and their historical importance, and I thought this project would be a great opportunity to explore that intrigue. Equally, the Islamic culture and region of the Islamic Republic, where the original Astrolabe originates from, is an area I have not investigated in great depth and I feel this project will help open up a dominate area of worldly culture which is missing from my knowledge.\n\nContact with the Oriental Museum & Review of Existing Information:\n\nI contacted Gillian Ramsay following our trip to the Oriental museum as she was the curator who originally purchased the replica astrolabe for the collection. We met in mid November and she was very helpful in sharing her knowledge of the object and subject area. She provided me with the museum’s material on the specific object which consisted of the dimensions, a brief description of the piece, details of its production, and materials used and how much it cost. As it is a replica it does not have a large paper trail of former owners or donors, but I believe it provides a unique opportunity to explore how and why it has remained an ‘object of desire’ for so many centuries and why are replicas still being produced.\n\nThe lack of direct material on the object I feel opens up a world of opportunity to explore the development of the astrolabe from its original concept in the Greek world and then to its use in the Islamic world. I also feel there is a great area for exploration amongst the original craftsman, Diya’al Din Muhammad, and his family and the seminal pieces they created that are still being replicated.\n\nResearch Questions:\n\nI feel a central debate for my project is whether a replica can still hold the same value as an object of desire compared to an original piece?\n\nEqually, whether the astrolabe has lost value when it is now being mostly used as an aesthetic piece rather than one of a functional purpose as a scientific instrument?\n\nQuestions surrounding the Astrolabe as a reference piece into the ancient Greek world, where it was first created, and whether it can shine light on to this culture and the importance they place on exploring the universe?\n\nExploration into how the Islamic culture utilised scientific objects to support their religion when Christian based religions rejected them.\n\nQuestions surrounding the evolution of pieces due to transferring cultures could be posed. The astrolabe was originally a scientific instrument developed by the Greeks and was adopted by the Islamic world who expanded its potential use through further scientific research. I feel it would be insightful to explore into this adoption of objects into other cultures and what implications does this have for the development of the object and the cultures?\n\nReflective Analysis\n\nI think the first natural obstacle is that it is a replica, not an original piece. This means it does not have a personal story attached to it or a donor. I hope to counter this issue by contacting the replica manufacturer ‘Hemisferium’ to understand why they feel there is a demand for replicas of these pieces and to explore the questions of replica vs original and whether they hold equal value.\n\nI hope to also explore the original manufacturing company from Lahore to see where the original piece is located and if it had an intended owner. Equally if the manufactures have any personal anecdotes and explore what their production line meant to their family as it remained as a generational business.\n\nIt is an intricate piece of science and I feel the first hurdle will be understanding how it works. I hope to consult scientific material and the Astrolabe specialist at the Oxford museum to understand how it actually functions.\n\nAlthough, there is not a great deal of information on my specific item, there is an abundance of material on Astrolabes in general which makes the topic quite broad. I will tackle this challenge by being highly selective of what is explicitly relevant to my object of desire and the questions I want to answer, as outlined above.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nDurham’s physical library came up short but their ‘discover’ link to online documents was highly fruitful.\n\n- I have explored the general descriptions of Astrolabes and their evolution and purpose from: The Oxford History of Science Museum, The British Museum, The University of Hawaii’s, Institute for Astronomy, and the Smithsonian magazine, Oxford Art online.\n\nConstanze Hampp & Stephan Schwan (2015) The Role of Authentic Objects in Museums of the History of Science and Technology: Findings from a visitor study, International Journal of Science Education, Part B, 5:2, 161-181.\n\nEagleton, C.

On investigation I found they have the ‘world’s largest collection of astrolabes’ and another astrolabe by Diya’al Din Muhammad. I also discovered that there is an incredible colossal astrolabe in the Albukhary Gallery in the British Museum. I have consulted both of their collections and online material, and I will be in contact with their curators for more in-depth questions I have on the topic such as: Why the curators feel such objects hold importance in the education of Islam and scientific development.\n\nI also hope to visit both collections in Epiphany term if possible so I can compare their specific details to my Astrolabe as the designs, notably on the rete, are typically different on each which provides a personal and beautiful aesthetic quality to the object.\n\n11/12/2019\n\n#8 Basic breaking down of the Astrolabe: How each piece of the Astrolabe works\n\nMy astrolabe is made of cast metal and comprises of many intricate parts. As a scientific instrument, it is very complex and sophisticated. Each astrolabe is very unique in construction, design, and are set for different locations.\n\nWhen we talk of astrolabes, we typically mean ‘planispheric astrolabes’. Sreeramula Rajeswara Sarma describes these as essentially a ‘representation of the three-dimensional celestial sphere on a two-dimensional plane by stereographic projection’.\n\nHe notes ‘the most common type is the northern astrolabe’ which projects the North Pole as the centre of the astrolabe and the outermost periphery is formed by the Tropic of Capricorn. So it is aligned only for stars which are north of the Tropic of Capricorn. You can also get Southern Astrolabes which reverse the situation and the centre is formed by the celestial South Pole and the outer periphery by the Tropic of Cancer, and it represents stars whose courses are between the south pole and the course of the beginning of Cancer. A few were made as North-South astrolabes so they could display stars on both hemispheres.\n\nThe British Museum blog depicts astrolabes as ‘complex devices which use several moving parts to turn raw data provided by the user into practical information’. In many ways, they are seen as ‘the computers of their time, used to solve problems relating to the position of the sun, stars, planets and timekeeping.’\n\nI have done some research into what each part of my astrolabe actually is and how they work, and I will try to convey this information.\n\nMoreover, I will be contacting Hemisferium for assistance in breaking down the exact intricacies of my astrolabe.\n\nAstrolabe Summary:\n\nThe astrolabe is usually made of brass or copper, circular in shape, and can vary from a small handheld piece, to large ornamental works.\n\nThe front of the astrolabe comprises of a face or mater, which holds plates or tympanum a throne attached to the top of the mater and a decorated rete or net covering the mater. Modern adaptations also have a Regula. The back is divided into an upper half and lower half and it has an alidade.\n\nFront\n\nBody/womb or Mater (Arabic: umm/ أم)\n\nThe mater or body houses the plates or ‘tympani’, and the net or ‘rete’.\n\nThe mater is a body which is deep enough to contain several plates.\n\nThe face was often engraved with circles around the rim or limbus which could be broken down for the twenty-four hours of the day, the zodiac calendar etc. As well as engraved lines for the tropic of cancer and Capricorn, and the equator.\n\nPlate or tympanum (Arabic: safiha)\n\nEach plate or tympanum is inscribed with a projection of sky above an observer at a given latitude.\n\nEach plate is calculated for a different latitude so they can be used in different locations. One places on top the plate one wishes to employ.\n\nOften engraved on the plate are names of cities, their longitudes, latitudes and identification.\n\nRete or Net (Arabic: ankabut / شبكة)\n\nOn the surface of the mater sits the rete or net, it is the map of the stars as it is engraved with star constellations and the ecliptic (the path of the sun against the background stars).\n\nThe constellations through which the sun passes on the ecliptic are the signs of the Zodiac.\n\nThe spikes on the rete indicate the positions of individual stars.\n\nIt can be rotated so it reflects what the user sees in the sky.\n\nIt is also very decorative. Some have vines, intricate patterns, animal heads, and zodiac signs cut into them.\n\nRegula or ruler\n\nA rotating ruler which offers agile, precise and versatile solutions to many problems (some of which cannot be solved without it).\n\nThrone (Arabic: Kursi/ كرسي)\n\nThe mater is topped with a triangular shaped ‘throne’ rising to a trifoil shaped point.\n\nAttached to the thone is a Ring/Halqa/ حلقة which allows the astrolabe to be held flat at eye-level.\n\nBack of the Mater (Arabic: zahr/ زهر)\n\nThe face is usually engraved with several circles divided by different kinds of gradations, such as 360 degrees, or 365 1/4 parts for the days, 12 for the months, etc. This data would then be used to make calculations to help serve the task at hand.\n\nThe back of the instruments is divided into an upper half and lower half, and oftentimes into four quadrants.\n\nEach section contains various trigonometric scales and astrological tables.\n\nAlidade or Label (Arabic: Al-‘idada / الحلقة العضدية)\n\nA rotating bar which is used to measure angles, determine directions and look at constellations.\n\nThis side of the instrument is divided into degrees for taking altitude measurements, and is also engraved with a calendar and divisions of the zodiac.\n\nIt has sighting vanes, the observational part of the astrolabe, which allows the user to establish the altitude of the Sun and the stars to help work out direction and time.\n\nFor example, you set the latitude and longitude and then look towards the constellation and where it aligns on the marked degrees can help determine your direction and time.\n\nIn Islamic astrolabes – There were often also ‘prayer lines’ which were used to indicate the correct times for Muslim prayers in different seasons.\n\nPin (Arabic: Faras / فرس)\n\nMost Arabic astrolabes have a bolt performing as axis traverses the alidade, the mater, the tympanum and the rete.\n\nImage kindly provided by Durham Oriental Museum.\n\n28/12/2019\n\n#10 The Astrolabe being used within different fields\n\nCurator William Greenwood also breaks down how astronomy and astrology was considered within science for most of its existence.\n\nThat astronomy was looking at the skies and trying to understand natural phenomenon.\n\nWhilst Astrology is what those stars, planets and phenomenon are supposed to do upon on earth. He noted that, although astrology is generally seen as less scientific today, that for the longest time up till very recently, astrology was seen as much of or maybe even more of a science than astronomy. Astronomy was there to serve astrology.\n\nRoderick and Marjorie Webster break down some of these uses in Western Astrolabes\n\nAstrologers\n\nThe Webster’s point out previously that astrologers would use scientific instruments like astrolabes to practice ‘natural astrology’ for ‘foretelling the weather, earthquakes, diseases, mortality, wars, discords, and conspiracies from the state of physical conditions, which were thought to be dependent both on the course of the planets through the signs and on the appearance of comets. ‘\n\nThey note alternatively they also practiced ‘judicial astrology’ which ‘attempted to divine the outcome of human affairs from the disposition of the heavens at the time of a client's birth or the occasion of an election.’\n\nThe Webster’s outline how astrological readings would work with astrolabes, that ‘judicial astrologers answered horary questions. In other words, they would be consulted by a person preparing to undertake a great project or go on a business trip. Once the astrologer learned the time of the client's birth, he saw how that person's horoscope corresponded with the aspect of the celestial bodies at the time the inquiry was made. Upon this comparison, he foretold how successful the undertaking would be-typically adding that God may do more or less as he pleased.’\n\nMedicine The Webster’s further illustrate how astrology was also a ‘major component of medical care’. That since the Middle Ages, ‘astrolabes were used to determine the critical days of an illness, the optimum times for bleeding, and occasions for medications.’\n\nDark Arts\n\nThe Webster’s further note that ‘Western sources confirm that astrolabes were used in the darker, prophetic arts.’\n\nThat a ‘medieval manuscript of Czech origin shows astronomers toiling with astrolabes alongside geomancers.’\n\nThey reference that there is even ‘crude woodcuts in chapbooks’ which depict ‘astrolabes alongside Dr. Faustus, seen conjuring in a circle, with the devil beside him.’\n\nGeography\n\nGeography, navigation, and surveying – which might be grouped together as topographical arts – were other institutions which used astrolabes.\n\nAny astrolabe could be used to find the difference in longitude between two towns if the initial time of a lunar eclipse was noted each location.\n\nUsed at sea\n\nThe Webster’s further remark that in astrolabe ‘early use at sea would have been difficult, given the rocking of the ship and the wind resistance offered by the metal plate’. However, they note that ‘these problems were overcome in the late fifteenth century, when the instrument was stripped of all nonessential parts, leaving only a heavily weighted, graditated limb and an alidade.’\n\nThus, in this new form, ‘the astrolabe came of age as a nautical tool and it was readily adopted by Renaissance sailors, who were taught to sail by the altitude of the pole star or \"run down the latitude.”’\n\nImage Credits: astrologyandart@tumblr.com and WelcomeImages\n\n18/01/2020\n\n#12 Breakdown of Diya’Al Din’s original astrolabe\n\nAfter contacting Hemisferium I was surprised to learn that my object was not an exact replica of the original piece made by Diya’Al Din Muhammad in 1647, but that it had involved an extensive team who worked on analysing the original and then updating it for the contemporary day.\n\nObject title: Astrolabe: Eastern\n\nMaker(s): Diya' al-Din Muhammad (Maker)\n\nDate produced: 1647 - 1648\n\nPlace of production: Lahore, Pakistan\n\nMaterial(s): Brass, Copper\n\nDimensions (H x W x L): 21.1 (cm) x 12.3 (cm) x 4.1 (cm) (Object)\n\nDimension notes: Mater thickness: 0.9 cm\n\nDescription: Body, rete, graduated diopter with scales and sights, pin, handle, ring and 4 tympans. Horse missing. 33 star markers. Labelled in Arabic.\n\nInscription/signature: `amal diya' al-din muhammad ibn mulla qa'im muhammad ibn mulla `isa ibn mulla allahdad asturlabi humayuni lahawari sanah 1057 hijri\" [The work of Diya' al-Din Muhammad ibn Mulla Qa'im Muhammad ibn Mulla `Isa ibn Mulla Allāhdād, the astrolabe-maker, the Humayuni, the resident of Lahore, in the year 1057 of the Hijra].\n\nOn display: Astronomy in Culture\n\nHemisferium were able to provide me with a breakdown of how exactly the original 1647 Diya’Al Din Muhammad astrolabe is composed which is as follows:\n\nFront\n\nEngraved on the original mater are two concentric circles, bearing names of cities, their longitudes, latitudes and identification.\n\nThe inner circle includes two cities referenced on the back of the instrument: Lahore, longitude 109° and latitude 31.5°, and Varanasi, longitude 117.2° and latitude 26.5°\n\nOn the periphery we find the limbus, or outer rim, labelled with 1 degree marks and 5° intervals which run clockwise from 1° to 360°, with the latter located under the throne.\n\nThis original piece includes four different plates for different latitudes, plus two others, one of them with multiple horizons and the other for the 66.5° latitude, which enables the user to convert from equatorial coordinates to ecliptic ones.\n\nIn the lower part of each plate there is a notch that fits onto a pin in the lower part of the mater, so that the plate is properly fixed and there are no displacements.\n\nOn the plates or tympani, circles denoting heights (almucantars or almucantarats) are indicated every 3° and azimuths every 30°.\n\nUneven hours and Babylonian hours are also represented.\n\nThe rete or net, which is on the surface of the mater, portrays the ecliptic, which is subdivided every 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 degrees, starting from each sign of the zodiac. Stars are noted on a separate list, thirty-three in total.\n\nBack\n\nThe back of the instruments is divided into upper half and lower half.\n\nUpper half of the back\n\nOn the outer rim of the semicircle, the upper half contains two scales for measuring heights, labelled degree by degree (following the alphanumeric system) and with divisions at every 5° up to 90°, starting from the horizontal on both right and left.\n\nEach scale originates at 0° and ends at 90° in the central section of the throne, in such a way that the left-hand side scale progresses clockwise, and the right-hand side scale goes anti-clockwise.\n\nOn the left-hand side of this semicircle there is a Sine scale divided into thirty equal double parts.\n\nOn the right-hand side there is a scale of maximum heights, which represents the curves for latitudes – 27° (Varanasi) and 32° (Lahore).\n\nThis scale for maximum heights includes distances for the entrance into the signs of the Zodiac (separated by equal distances).\n\nThere are ‘prayer lines’ with the purpose of indicating the correct times for Muslim prayers in the different seasons.\n\nIn most Islamic astrolabes, a quadrant on the back (quarter of the circle) depicts a chart corresponding to the Sun’s altitude at the moment it crosses the zenith in Mecca for a particular latitude. This way, if we determine the altitude corresponding approximately to a particular day of the year, we will see the Sun is located at the altitude we have determined on the chart. The Sun’s azimuth at that moment will correspond to the azimuth of the Qibla.\n\nLower half of the back\n\nThe lower half has an engraved ‘shadow quadrant’ which is an altitude scale.\n\nOn the right, both the straight shadow scale (umbra recta) and the reverse shadow scale (umbra versa) are divided into 12 inches.\n\nOn the left, they are divided into seven feet.\n\nInside this square are engraved the names of the signs of the Zodiac and, further inside, the Lunar Mansions.\n\nOn the rim of the lower half, surrounding the shadow quadrant, there is a cotangent scale.\n\nThe right-hand side is divided into 36 parts and the left-hand side into 21 parts.\n\nAlidade\n\nThe alidade has sights/vanes which allow the user to establish the altitude of the Sun and the stars.\n\nIt is furnished with a scale for maximum heights and another scale for the Sine measures.\n\nThis astrolabe does not have the typical bolt which traverses the alidade, the mater, the tympanum and the rete.\n\nAlthough it has an indentation which matches the wedges of the other components and allows the user to rotate the alidade and the rete over the plates\n\nThrone or Kursi\n\nAt the top of the back, there is a detailed throne with a hole designed for the hanger rings. (So the user could hold the Astrolabe easily).\n\nIn the centre of the back is the name of Diya' al-Din Muhammad, that he was the son of Qa'im Muhammad, and that is was produced in Lahore in 1647-48.\n\nWhat is Notably missing\n\nHemisferium noted an important shortcoming in the original astrolabe is that there is no regula, and the hours are not inscribed on the limbus in two XII-hour halves; there is no zodiacal calendar either.\n\nAll images kindly supplied by the Adler Planetarium\n\n10/02/2020\n\n#14 Contacting Dr Julio Samsó – Involved in the Reproduction of the Astrolabe – Depicting the updates to modernise the replica Astrolabe\n\nAdriana from Hemisferium kindly passed on a link to Dr Julio Samsó’s profile on researchgate. He was the expert on Arabic culture and Islamic technology and scientific instruments who helped compute the ancient alphanumeric codes and other special characteristics for this new astrolabe.\n\nI contacted him through researchgate.net but unfortunately I did not receive a reply. However, this did not deter me, and I searched for any information on him on the internet and I was able to track down his University email as he is a Professor at the University of Barcelona.\n\nVery unexpectedly I received an email back a few days later!\n\nI wanted to pose a few questions to him. First and foremost, the replication process and what had been the major updates.\n\nHe pointed me in the direction of the booklet which comes with my astrolabe which he helped to write. Thankfully, I managed to get a copy of this from Adriana which was incredibly useful. As well as illustrating some other points of development.\n\nHe informed me that ‘it was never their aim to make an exact replica but to build a similar piece in the Oriental style for the latitude 21° 32’ N.\n\nIt was meant to be as ‘faithful as possible to the original but, at the same time, updated and furnished with certain essential elements that make it useful in present times.’\n\nFrom a combination from his booklet and email I have illustrated the main updates:\n\nThe front of the Hemisferium astrolabe\n\nRegula\n\nHemisferium updated their model to contain the classical regula (ruler), which offers agile, precise and versatile solutions to many problems (some of which cannot be solved without it).\n\nThe updated regula also offers the great advantage of saving the user tedious and repetitive movements, as well as the mathematical calculations needed to establish the time in degrees and then convert the latter to hours and its fractions to minutes. These operations were originally all performed with abacuses.\n\nLimbus\n\nUpdated in line with the traditional ‘European’ style of astrolabes, the limbus was divided in two XI- hour sections, AM and PM, and each section is divided into 15 and 30 minute sections.\n\nCalendars\n\nThe ecliptic was altered to include a monthly and daily Gregorian calendar.\n\nZodiac Calendar – There are also entrances for the different zodiacal signs marked with the corresponding symbol. The entrance for each sign also corresponds to dates on the Gregorian calendar, for example, the entrance into Aries corresponds to the 21st of March and entrance into Libra to the 23rd of September.\n\nIntervals are placed every 5 days in order not to alter the back of the astrolabe.\n\nRete or net (Fig. 4)\n\nIt has been abridged and updated by reducing the number of stars and leaving only the most relevant ones, with a cleaner plate in mind.\n\nThe stars placement also had to be updated to their corresponding locations for the 21st Century as stars change position so they are not where they were when the original piece was made in 1647 in terms of their Right Ascension and Declination.\n\nThey were able to accurately correct this through logic and calculations. They took the knowledge that the precession of the equinoxes is equivalent to 50’ of the annual arc and that 71.5 years correspond to 1 degree. Thus, with this update they could update the pattern without fear of any imprecision.\n\nPlates to Mater\n\nDiyâ' al-Din's astrolabe included 4 plates engraved on both sides, as well as an astrological plate engraved in the mater, whilst the replica does not have plates.\n\nOn the replica, the mater has the diagram of the Equator, tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, horizon, circles parallel to the horizon, and vertical circles.\n\nThey are set to a latitude 21º 32' which corresponds to Jidda in Saudi Arabia. (Fig. 1)\n\nDr Samsó informed me that Hemisferium had planned to sell the instrument in Saudi Arabia which explains the choice of Jidda and Mecca.\n\nThe almucantars (heights) are labelled every 10° and azimuths marked every 10° and highlighted every 30°, increasing from the South.\n\nThis gradation is represented by a ciphered alphanumeric type scale, following the use of the period.\n\nIt also has a crepuscular (twilight) line corresponding to astronomic sunset (when the Sun has a negative altitude of -18°).\n\nThey also included the temporary and Babylonian hours for that latitude. (Babylonian hours were equinoctial or equal hours which represented the time elapsed from sunrise and were marked by the Sun’s nadir or antisolar point under the horizon; they were numbered from 1h to 13h.)\n\nBack of the Hemisferium astrolabe\n\nThe back (Fig. 5) of the instrument has been almost preserved completely.\n\nAlidade\n\nOnly the alidade has been changed, for one belonging to another astrolabe made a few years later (1660, catalogued as A-81) by Diya’al Din Muhammad in Lahore.\n\nThis alidade is more in keeping with the drawing of the scales in our piece.\n\nCurve of the solar meridian\n\nThe replica also contains the curve of the solar meridian altitudes throughout the solar year for the latitude of Mecca (modern value 21º 26').\n\nIn Diya' al-Dîn's astrolabe there were two curves for latitudes 27º and 32º\n\nThis scale is made up of distances for the respective entrances into the signs of the Zodiac (separated by equal distances).\n\nDiagrams by Hemisferium\n\n20/02/2020\n\n#15 How to Establish the time using Hemisferium Astrolabe\n\nHemisferium’s booklet breaks down how to use their astrolabe for these different purposes. This is their detailed breakdown of how to use their astrolabe to establish the time using the sun’s height.\n\nEstablishing the time using the Sun’s height\n\nThey take May 21st as the date for their example.\n\nOn this day, you calculate the height of the Sun in the afternoon with the help of the alidade, placing it in such a way that a ray of sunlight comes through the first vane and falls on the centre of the second vane, which should produce 20°. (They warn that one should never look at the Sun directly through the vanes, since there is risk of going blind.)\n\nNext, you must locate on the ecliptic the solar point corresponding to May 21st, which is exactly 0° Gemini ( ).\n\nNext, you rotate the rete or net until the solar point falls over the South meridian (a circle of constant longitude passing through a given place) which is under 360°.\n\nYou then read the number of degrees marked by the net’s index and copy down this number. In this case the number should be 150°.\n\nAfter this you must rotate the net/rete until the solar point coincides with the almucantar (circle on the celestial sphere parallel to the horizon) corresponding to 20° on the right-hand side of the astrolabe.\n\nThe net’s index should now indicate 227°.\n\nTherefore, the hourly angle of the Sun will be 227°-150°=77°.\n\nThis will then be divided by the 15° that correspond to each hour, with a result of 5,13h.\n\nThis can then be converted into hourly fraction to minutes: 5h8m, which, when added to XII hours, give us a final result of 17h8m (local solar time).\n\nThis is the method for establishing the time in Arabic astrolabes that do not have a regula.\n\nIf you employ the newly incorporated regula, you simply have to displace the ecliptic’s solar point to almucantar 20°.\n\nImage Credit: Linda Geddes via Aeon\n\n20/02/2020"
