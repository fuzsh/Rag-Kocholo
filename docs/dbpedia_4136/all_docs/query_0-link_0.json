T here was not a year in which India did not drain the Roman JEmpire of a sum eq^uivalent to about one and a half crores of rupees. Thus complained Pliny, in the first century A. D., of Rome s unequal trade with India. Pliny’s statement testifies to the superiority of India s industrial skill and commercial organisation which had given her practically a mono- poly of the European market in a wide range of goods. In the succeed- ing centuries India s pre-eminence in world trade was nevqr seriously challenged, until Europe forged ahead with the advent of the Industrial Revolution. With a rich store of natural resources and the traditional skill of her workmen, now aided by modem tcclinology, India is work- ing hard through her Five Year Plans to regain her ancient position of pride in the world of trade and industry.

It has a land fron- tier of 8,200 miles long and a coast line of 3,500 miles. It is approxi- mately thirteen times as large as United Kingdom, eight times the size of Japan and a seventh of U.S.S.R, It is the seventh largest country in the world. It extends about 2.000 miles from north to south and about 1,700 miles from east to west. Its triangular peninsula juts into the Indian Ocean and is bounded on the south-west by the Arabian Sea and on the south-east by the Bay of Bengal. In^a is bordered on the north-west by West Pakistan and on the norih-east by Burma, East Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Tibet. PHYSICAL DIVISION India is divided into three main toi>ograpJiical areas. 1. The Himalayan region v:aU). 2. The Indo-Gangetic plains (the Plains). 3. The Deccan or Plateau of the south {Plateau region). The Himalayan region extends across the northern border from Kashmir to the Burma frontier. The Himalayas comprise a system of stupendous fold-mountain ranges, some of them the loftiest in the world ; extending in the shape of a scimitar with its edge facing soLithw aid. Suuth of the mountains are the Indo-Gangetie plains. They are about 1,500 miles long, east to west, and from 150 to 200 - miles broad. The plains are broken by intermittent low-lying mountain ranges and are watered by India's three main rivers — ^the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Jumna — ^which flow southward from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal The Plateau region comprises a three-sided table-land covering much of Central and South India except for the narrow* strips of plain along the eastern and western coasts. Behind the narrow coastal plains lie low ranges of mountains knowm as Western and Eastern Ghats. CLIMATE AND RAINFALL India lies just north .of the equator, extending from about the 8th to 35th latitude- A tropical monsoon climate prevails in most of the country ; changes in the time or nature of the monsoons can vitally affect the Indian economy. There are two monsoon seasons. The south-wrest monsoon from June through September is the most important. It brings heavy rainfall to most of the country but only light showers in the central and eastern parts of the peninsula. The monsoon’s direction reverses in November blowdng from north- east through February. The north-east monsoon provides the heaviest rainfall of the year to the south-eastern areas but dry HINDUSTAN YEAR-BOOK weather everywhere. The climate is everywhere dominated by the seasonal rhythm of the monsoons and about 85 per cent of the rain comes from the south-west monsoon between June and October. Rainfall in most parts of India ranges from 30 to 70 inches. The temperature in the north ranges from a mean of about 40 degrees in January to llo degrees in May. There is a cool winter season from November through February, a hot summer period from March through June and a humid rainy season from July through October. The plains are hot throughout most of the year. The temperature of the plateau is also hot and fairly constant, although the temperature and humidity are somewhat lower than the plains. The mean annual temperatures for India’s three major cities are : Calcutta, 79 degrees, ^vith a range from 50 to 85 ; and Bombay and Madras between 80 and 85 degrees with a normal annual range of less than 10 degrees. We can divide the country into four zones according to rainfall : (1) Wet zone, wliere minimum rainfall is 100 inches. This includes West Bengal, Assam and Western coast strips. (2) Intermediate zone (zone of moderate rainfall); it includes portions of Central India, Himalayas to Godavari river, east-coaSt of the peninsula and eastern side of the Western Ghat and up to Baroda, 'where rainfall is between 40 inches and 80 inches. (3) Dry zone, where rainfall is less than 40 inches. (4) Desert zone, where rainfall is less than 20 inches, Le,, Rajasthan and East Punjab. SOIL OF INDIA About 35 per cent of the land area is fertile, well-watered and under cultivation. 20 to 25 per cent is left fallow or is 'waste land which can be brought under cultivation. Forests cover some 15 per ■cent of the land area. The remainder consists of deserts, semi- deserts and mountain ranges. Indian soil may be mainly classified under four different heads namely, (1) alhirial soil, (2) hla^k soil, (3) red soil and (4) laterite soil. The alluvial soil is formed by the silts brought by the rivers every year and deposited on their hanks. It is very fertile and covers greater part of the northern India between the foot of the Himalayas and the northern slopes of the Vindhyas and extends in a narrow fringe round the coastline of the peninsula. Territorially they occupy Punjab, Uttar-Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, parts of Assam and Orissa and also in the coastal regions of Southern India. The whole of the Indo-Gangetic plain is comprised in this area. Red soils cover the whole of Madras, Mysore and south-east Bombay, east of Hyderabad and Madhya Pradesh to Orissa and Chota Nagpur. Northwards the red soil extends into greater part fif Santhal Parganas and the Birbhum district of West Bengal, the -Mirzapur, Jhansi and Hamirpur districts of the Uttar Pradesh, the .Baghelkhand States of Central India, the Aravalis and the eastern half of Rajasthan. HINDUSTAN YEAR-BOOK 3 Black soil or black cotton soil is formed by tbe lava of volcanic eruptions and is very suitable for cotton cultivation. The black soil covers greater part of Bombay and Saurasbtra, western part of Madhya Pradesh, Madhya Bharat and Hyderabad and some parts of Madras State. Black cotton soil is exceedingly compact and tenaci- ous and sticky when wet. The water-holding capacity of this soil is good. Cotton, jatvar, wheat, linseed and gram are cultivated in these areas and the soil is rich in iron and aluminium but very poor in organic matter and other plant nutrients. Late rite soil is derived by the atmospheric weathering of several types of rocks under monsoon conditions of alternating dry and wet periods. This soil is found on the summits of the hills of the Deccan, Madhya Bharat, Madhya Pradesh and of the Rajmahal and Eastern Ghats and certain parts of Orissa, Bombay, Malabar and Assam. COAST LINE Coast line of India lacks in indentations and although about 3,500 miles in length, it has only four openings of importance into land, such as Runn of Cutch and Gulf of Cambay on west, the Gulf of Mannar between India and Ceylon and the head to the Bay of Bengal. The coasts are singularly free from islands and the sea round the coast of India is very shallow and the shores are usually fiat and sandy. The West coast is rocky with mountains close to the sea. East coast is less rocky but the sea here is shallow, so that large ships cannot approach the coast. LANGUAGES According to the census of 1951, the total languages or dialects in India are 845 which includes 63 non-Indian languages. But this multiplicity of languages need not dismay any one, because only 12 are of major importance. Hindi, the national language is spoken by the largest number of people. English is used in Government notices and coirespondence and is widely understood in Government and business circles. The Constitution of India provides that English is to continue to he used for official purposes at least until 1965, but eventually Hindi in Devnagri script is to become the official language of record. RIVER SYSTEMS (1) Rivers of Northern India — ^They all rise in the mountain wall or beyond it. The rivers are fed with waters from the gradual melting of snow. They do not depend entirely for their waters on the monsoon rains. The three greater river systems of ' northern India are : — (a) Indus river with its five tributaries, i.e., the Jhelum, the Chenub, the Ravi, the Beas and the Sutlej ; (6) The Ganges with a course of fifteen hundred miles, drains Himalaya's southern slopes and with its tribu- taries, the Jamuna, the Gogra, the Gondak, the Chambal and the HINDUSTAN YEAR-BOOK Sone, and enters Bay of Bengal through extensive deltas with multi- tude of channels ; (c) The Brah-maimtra flows down through Tibet, Assam and Eastern Bengal and discharges its floods after a course of sixteen hundred and eighty miles into Bay of Bengal. (2) Rivers of Peninsular India — They are quite different from the rivers of the northern India. They rise in the hills of the plateau and they are fed only by monsoon rains. The rivers rise near Western Ghats, and flow towards Bay of Bengal. The most important are the Mahanadi. the Godavari, the Kistna and the Cavery. In the north of the plateau two important rivers, the Narbada and the Tapti flow westwards. PORTS India has very few natural harbours, because it is broken by very few inlets of the sea, the sea round the coast is very shallow and the shores are usually flat and sandy. Except Bombay, Okha and Cochin, all other ports in Western India coast are virtually in- accessible during the monsoon. The eastern coast of India is surf- bound and has no natural harbour. Calcutta is about 90 miles -from the sea and the formation of sand banks in the Hooghly has made Calcutta a dangerous port. The principal ports of India are Bedi Bunder, Okha, Porbandar, Surat. Kandia, Bombay, Marraugao, Mangolore, Calicut, Cochin, Alleppey, Quilon, Tuticorin. Dhanushkodi, Kegapatam, Karikal, Cuddalore, Pondicherry, Madras, Masulipatam, Kakinada, Visakhapat- nam, Calcutta. Bombay, Visakhapatnam, Madras, Cochin and Cal- cutta are termed ‘major ports’ of India. There are also 200 minor poi'ts of varying capacity. Practically all the India’s foreign trade is channelled through one of the five main ports which are under Central Government supervision. PEOPLE According to the 1951 census, India has a population of 35,68,29,485 of whom onljj 17.3 per cent live in cities and towns, while 82.7 per cent live in villages. The chief concentrations are along the plains and delta region of the north and along the well- watered coasts of the peninsula. India has many large and densely populated urban areas. The rate of population increase is around 1 per cent a year. The life expectancy is only 32 years, due in large part to the high death rate among infants. The average additional life expectancy of persons aged 20 is about 35 years. During the ten years 1941-50, births have oceured at an average rate of 40 per thousand per annum and deaths have occured at an average rate of 27 per thousand per annum. India has 947 females for every 1,000 males. The average density of population in India is 312 per square mile. There are 3,018 towns and 5,58,089 villages in the country. There are 73 cities in India that have a population of one lakh and over. The classification of population according to means of livelihood shows HINDUSTAN YEAR-BOOK that 70 per eent of the people of the countiy depend on agriculture and 30 per cent live by non-agricuiture professions. RELIGION The predominant religious afF.liation is Hindiusm which includes among its followers about 260.000.000 persons or three.fourths of the population. Muslims number about 43.000,000 ; Christians 5.000.000 to 6,000,000 and Bikhs 4.000,000 to 5,000.000. There are also Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, Jewish and Animist minorities. INDIAN RACES During the British period the first official enumeration of the people of India was made by Sir Herbert Risley which was an official pronouncement accepted very largely both in India and outside India, though it is now regarded as arbitrary classification based on in- sufficient data and immature science. Indian races were divided into seven broad groups, such as Mongoloid, Indo-Aryan, Bravidian, Movgolo-DravkUan, Aryo-Dravidian, Scytho-Dra vidian and Tui'ko- Iranian. Next classification was made by Dr. J. H. Hutton in 1933 based on race-cum-language and culture sequence. According to this theoi'y all people came to India from outside, such as — (1) Negritos from Africa — the oldest people to have come to India now surviving in the Andaman islands and in ilalaya. Traces of them seem to occur among the Nagas in Assam and in certain tribes in South India. (2) Proto- Australoids — ^who came from the East Mediterra- nean area. (3) Early Mcditerraniavs— who brought earlier forms of the Austric speech. (4) Civilised or Ad,vanecd Mediterranean — ^who became Dra- vidians in India. (5) Armenoids — a specialised offshoot from the standard Alpine stock probably came with the civilised Mediterraneans (Dra vidians) and spoke their language. (6) Alpines — found in Gujarat and Bengal ; earlier than Vedic Aryans but probably .speaking Aryan dialects. (7) Vedic Aryans or Nordics — ^who brought the Vedic Aryan (Sanskrit) speech. (8) Mongoloids — Not important for the greater part of India as they touched only the northern and eastern fringes. The most recent and authoritative classification has been made by Dr. B. S. Guha, Director of Anthropology who divides the peop> of India into six main races with nine sub-types. (1) Negrito — ^is now almost extinct in India, a small gimip is still surviving in Andamans and its traces have been found among Kadars and Palayans of Cochin and Travancore Hills, Irurals of the Wjuad, the Angami Nagas of Assam and some of the Rajmahal Hill tribes of Bihar. 6 HINDUSTAN YEAR-BOOK (2) Proto Australoids — seem to have come from the West. They survive in a good many aboriginal peoples of the present day India, although more or less mingled with other people. A branch of the Proto Austroloids passed on to Australia in recent times. Through- out the greater part of India, the Proto-Austroloid peoples still live as the lower castes or sections of the Indian people. (3) The Mongoloid Group — ^is divided into (1) Palaeo-Mongo- loids consisting of long headed and broad headed types. They form a dominant element in the tribes in Assam and the Indo-Burmese frontier and among the less primitive types in Burma and in Chitta- gong; (2) Tibeto-Mongoloids are found in Sikkim and Bhutan. (4) Mediterranean Group consisting of (a) Palaeo-Mediterra- nean, medium statured, dark skinned and slight built, found in Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam tracts ; (5) Mediterranean, true European type found in the Punjab, Upper Gangetic Valley and is supposed to represent civilised pre-Aryan Dravidian people of Northern India, who contributed largely to the evolution of Hindu people and culture of North India ; (c) Oriental Type, sometime called Semitic or Jewish, found in the Punjab, in Sind, in Rajputana, in western U.P. and in some other parts of India. (5) Western Brachycephals consisting of (a) Alpinoid, (6) Dinarik and (c) Armenoid. They seem to have evolved in the Central Asian mountain regions and both Alpine and Dinai-ik varie- ties appear to have spread over the greater part of India, i.e,, Bengal, Orissa, Kathiawar, Kannada and Tamil countries, Gujarat, West coast of India excepting Malabar. The Parsis of Bombay are allied to Armenoids. (6) Nordics are the Aryan speaking group of India who are responsible for India’s Hindu civilisation and seem to have come from the Eurasian steppe lands and entered India during the second half of the second millennium B.C. The Nordic elements are strong in North-West Frontier of India, in the south of Hindu-Kush range. Nordic elements are present in mixed form in Punjab, Rajputana, Upper Ganges Valley. They are also found among higher castes and groups and also Nordic type predominates in certain sections in India. Lastly the author of this classification Dr. B. S. Guha has how- ever stated, “It must be clearly understood that no rigid separation is possible as there is considerable over-lapping of types.” MINERALS India is very rich in mineral resources. She is favoured with a supply of coal sufficient for its present and future industry. Coal reserves are estimated at 20 billion long tons, of which 5 billion are good-quality coking co,al. More than 80 p.c. of India’s coal is pro- duced in the States of Bihar and West Bengal. Other coal mining areas are Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Hyderabad and Assam. Large deposits of lignites have recently been reported in Madras coastal HINDUSTAN YEAR-BOOK plain. India’s reserves of high grade iron ore are estimated to be about 10 billion tons, or 100 years supply at the present rate of coipumption. The principal iron ore deposits ai*e in Bihar and Orissa and smaller deposits in iladhya Pradesh . Hysore and Hadras. Regarding non-ferrous metals, deposits of mica and manganese are large enough not only to meet present domestic requirements but also to enter signincantly into the country’s export trade. India produces about 75 p.c. of the world's total supply of mica. Reserves of high grads manganese ore are estimated at io to 20 million long tons and the deposiis of low grade ore several times larger. India’s bauxite reserves are estimated at 250 million tons. India also has substantial deposits of titanium, kyanite, beryllium, chrome and gypsum. Reserves of most other important non-ferrous metals are either small or non-existent. India is' dependent upon foreign sources for copper, zinc, tin, lead, platinum, nickel and mercury. Regarding mineral oil. India imports 95 per cent of its petro- leum and petroleum products, the remainder being supplied by oilfields and a refinery in Assam. New refineries have been started in Bombay. AGRICULTURE Agriculture is the major enterprise of Ijidia, providing the liveli- hood for about TO per cent of the population. Cereals are the impor- tant item of agricultural production, being grown on about 60 per cent of the cropped area. Rice accounts for about half of India’s cereal output, the other half is accounted for by a variety of grains including wheat, millet and barley. In addition to cereal production, 18 per cent of India’s total cropped area is devoted to pulses, gram and other food crops. Thus, 7S per cent of the cropped area of over 246,000,000 acres is devoted to food crops. Nevertheless India does not produce sufficient food for its own needs. One of the major objectives of first five-year Plan is to make India self-sufficient in foodstuffs by bringing more land under production. Various commercial crops are also significant. Oil seeds, cotton, sugarcane, tea, coffee, spices, rubber and jute are the most important of these. Such crops foma the basis of some of the major industries and are among the leading exports either in raw or manufactured form. ANIMALS Indian climatic conditions have naturally developed a gre^ variety of animal life and the number of animal species found in India is much greater, than that in Europe. In India, animals are chiefly seen in the valleys of the Hima- layas {i.e. Terai Forests) extending from Kashmir to the Brahma- putra valley, on the Eastern and Western Ghats and in the jungles of Madhya Pradesh and Central India. There are several big game reserve forests in India which now preserve some rare animals of India. (1) Wil3. Aniinals — lion is almost extinct and is now preserved 8 HINDUSTAN YKAR-BOOK in Gir forest of Kathiawar. Tigers are found all over India. Leopards (hunting leopards). Panthers, Cheetahs are common in the hills and plains. Elephants are found in the lower Himalayan valley, the Brahmaputra valley and forests of Nilgiri hills. Bears are available on the hills everywhere. Deer and antelopes are commonly seen in the plains. Yaks are only seen in higher Himalayas. Rhinoceros live in the swamps of Assam, North Bengal, Nepal. Mo^ikeys, Porciqnnes, Hares, vnld Hogs are to be seen everywhere, (2) Domestic Animals — goats, sheep, horses, ponies, asses, mules, hillocks, buffaloes are available here and there. Camels are seen in the desert districts of Rajasthan and East Punjab. (3) Birds — Vultures, kites, haivlcs, wild ducks, u'ild geese, pat- ridges, pigeons, parrots, cranes, peacocks, s'nipes and sand grouse are available everywhere. Birds in India, as in most hot countries, are more famous for their plumage than for their song. (4) Reptiles — Crocodiles are seen everywhere. The deadly snakes of India are Cobras, RusseVs Vipers, Kerait, Hamadryeds. (5) Fish — Most numerous fish are of carp family. The finest fish from angler’s point is Masher found in all streams. The richest and tasty fish of India is kilsa. Fishing waters, river and sea, of Bengal and Madras are among the most extensive in the world. LIVESTOCK India is one of the largest livestock countries in the world, According to the 1951 livestock census, there are 155 million cattle, 43 million buffaloes and 39 million ship in the country. India’s 155 million cattle constitute a fourth of the world’s cattle population. The most important cattle-rearing region is the north-west. It is a belt extemliiig from Kathiawar through Rajasthan and Punjab to Kashmir. The chief livestock products are milk, butter, ghee, meat and eggs, w'hile a proportion of hides, skins, wool, bones and horns is exported. The annual production of milk is 17*7 million tons and per capita consumption of milk and milk products has been estimated at 5-45 oz. a day. Among the best cows in India are Sahiwal (Punjab) and Gir (Saurashtra). The important breeds of bullocks are Hansi (Punjab), Nellore (Madras), Amrit Mahal (Mysore), Kankraj (Gujarat), Kangayam. (Madras), Kherigarh (U.P.), Dangi and Nimar (Bombay) and Harina (Punjab). Best breeds of buffaloes are Murrah (Punjab), Jafferbadi (Saurashtra), and Mehasana, Siirati and Pandharpuri (Bombay), FORESTS The forests cover about 15 per cent of the total area. The forest areas are not well-distributed in some of the States, specially in the Indo-Gangetic plain where area has fallen to the dangerously low feature of 11 p.c. in Punjab, 16 in U.P., and 14 in Bihar. HINDUSTAN YEAR-BOOK India has been divided into three botanical areas and six pro- vinces for the proper study of vegetation of India. The three bota- nical areas are (a) Hh^wlayav . — represents a rich, tropical tem- perate and alpine flora with forest? of conifers, oaks, rhododendrons and a profusion of orchids, (b) Easfurii — consisting of a few conifers, many oaks and palms with a greater preponderance of orchids and (c) Western which has oniy one co!;ifer. few palms and very small orchids without any oak. These three areas are divided into six botanical provinces based on their climate and physical characters, namely (11 Eastern Hima- laya, (2) Western Himalaya. (3) Indus plain, (4) Gangetic plain in- cluding Sunderbans, (5) Alalabar and (6j Deccan — each with its peculiar flora. The forest vegetation of India Is divided into five tj^pes accord- ing to the variation in climate, altitude and habitat, such as — (1) Evergreen, (2) DeckJnousi, (3) Dry, (4) Hill and (5) Tidal or L iff oral. The forests in India supply valuable timber, firewood, essential oils, resin, turpentine, lac, dyeing material, niyrobalans, sources of paper pulp and other materials of commerce and industry. The chief forest products of India are — ^teak, sal. deodar, chir, sheesham, many species of bamboo, leaves, fruits, fibres, grass, gums, resin, barks, etc. STATES The States and territories of India are divided into several cate- gories. Fart A States consist of the following States based on the original provinces of British India : the bicameral States of Bihar, Bombay, Madras, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and the unicameral States of Assam, -Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Andhra. Part B States consist of new administrative units formed after 1948 by princely States or group of States which acceded to India. They include Hyderabad, Madhya Bharat, Mysore, Patiala and East Punjab States IJnion (PEPSU), Rajasthan, Saurashtra. Travancore- Cochin and Vindhya Pradesh. In many instances, the former heads of princely States have been confirmed as Rajpramukh. Part C States are territories which because of special adminis- trative problems, enjoy a lesser degree of self-government, are to a greater degree under the control of the Central Government. This category consists of Ajmer, Bhopal, Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur, Coorg, Delhi, Kutch, Manipur. Tripura and Pandicherry State. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands form a separate administrative category. FLAG National Flag is horizontal tricolour with bands of deep saffron, white and dark green in equal proportions. On the centre of the white band appears an Asoka Chakra (wheel) which is navy blue. 10 HINDUSTAN YEAR-BOOK INDIAN FACTS IN A NUTSHELL POPULATION Next to China, India is the world’s most populus country. ^ ^ Every seventh man in the world is an Indian. * * * $ * India’s total population of 361-25 (including Kashmir and Tribal areas of Assam) according to 1951 census is the second highest in the world, China leading with a population of 463-50 million. The density of population per sq, m. in Indian Union is 312 according to 1951 census. ^ He df: ^ India’s population constitutes 15-1 per cent of the total popula- tion of the world population against China’s 19-4 per cent. » * * * * In respect of population of States, Uttar Pradesh has got the highest number with a total of 63*25 millions. Next comes Madras with a population of 57 millions. * !|e « * In respect of area M.P. is the largest State with an area of 130-32 thousand sq. miles, next comes Rajasthan with 1,30,207 sq. miles. Total land area of India covered by 1951 census is 1,269,640 sq. miles. ^ * India’s 73 cities have a population of a lakh or over. Uttar Pradesh has the largest number of cities — 16. 82-7 per cent of the population reside in villages whereas 17-3 per cent live in cities and towns. India has 947 females for every 1,000 males. AGRICULTURE India is mainly an agricultural country. It provides livelihood to 70 per cent of the people and accounts for nearly half of the total national income. ^ * India is one of world’s leading producers of commercial crops and they form the bulk of country’s export trade. « « « * * India is the world’s largest producer of oilseeds and tea and third largest grower of ^tobacco. HINDUSTAN YEAR-BOOK 11 The average holding in India is only about 5 acres. $ 4: « « India is one of the most fertile lands in the -^vorld. But the average yield of every crop per acre is not only the loudest in the ■world but the figures are tragic. %****£ Indian forests cover nearly a ninth of the country’s area. ¥ * * ¥ India has now the largest irrigation ‘works and the longest mileage of canals in the world. * * * ¥ ¥ . India has fourth of the world’s total cattle, ie., about 155 millions. But India’s cattle are worst of the lot, and they are fit only, as they do, to produce for India the largest amount of cattle hides. The^ average yield of milk per cattle per annum is only 413 lb,, which is the lowest in the world. * ¥ * * * The chief crops of India are rice, wheat, sugarcane, tea, cotton, jute, linseed, groundnut, coffee and rubber. * * * * ¥ India today is one of the largest producers of sugar, 80% of which is produced in the two States of U.P. and Bihar. But the per capita consumption of sugar in India is the lowest in the world. ¥ * * ¥ ¥ India enjoys virtual monopoly of lac production in the -world and leads the world in the production of groundnut and tea. ¥ « ¥ ¥ ¥ India is the second largest producer of rice, jute, tobacco and cotton. ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ More than 50 per cent of the tea grown in the \"world comes from India. MINERALS India is the main source of the world’s supply of ilmenite, manganese, manazite, zircon and mica. ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ India is one of the world’s leading producers of high grade man- ganese ore. ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ India produces about 75 per cent of the world’s total supply of mica. ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ Indian iron ore has the highest metal content (about 55 to 70 per cent) which makes the production cost of pig iron the lowest in the world. ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ The annual consumption of salt in India is estimated at 530 lakh tons which means that per capita consumption of salt is one of the 12 HINDUSTAN YEAR-BOOK lowest in the world. India has however become self-sufficient in salt within recent years. ^ * India produces annually about 3,50,000 ounces of gold value at about Rs. 3 crores. * * India stands 12th among the petroleum producing countries of the world, and the average production per year is about 0-62 i of the world output. TRADE & INDUSTRIES India is one of the largest industrial countries of the world ; but industry gives occupation to only about 8% of the total population of India, and the pressure on land is very great. ❖ « India ranks fifth in the world in volume of trade. Raw' mate- rials take the biggest place in the export trade, of which jute, tea, cotton, skin and rice form half. * :S * * Jute and cotton manufactures, tea, spices, vegetable oils, raw cotton and wool, tobacco, seeds, gums, fruits, mica and manganese have constituted the bulk of the country’s export trade in recent years. si! * ❖ * * India is ranked among the first ten industrial countries of the world. ^ * Indian film industry is the third largest in the world. ss * * « Indian textile industry is the leading industry of India : India’s tea, sugar, match and vegetable oil industry are among the biggest in the W'orld. Sugar takes the third place among Indian industries. * 4= 4= * Tata Iron and Steel works at Jamshedpur are now the largest steel W'-orks in the East. . * * The India railway system is by far the largest in Asia and the second biggest state-owmed enterprise in the w'orld. ^ ^ ^ Production of cement probably constitutes the second major heavy industry in India. Iron and Steel constitute one of India’s largest heavy industries. PUBLIC HEALTH & HYGIENE It is estimated that nearly 2-5 million people suffer from tubercu- losis and half a million die of it annually. HINDUSTAN YEAR-BOOK IS Malaria still continues to take the largest toll of human lives. It has been estimated that at least 100 million persons in the whole of India surfer from malaria every year. The annual mortality on this account is probably of the order of 1 — li million. >:! * * 1} s'!
