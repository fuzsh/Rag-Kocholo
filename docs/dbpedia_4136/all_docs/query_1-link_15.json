It is a unique collaboration initiated by the Community Outreach and Engagement teams at the Duke Cancer Institute, UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Since 2012, it has been firmly committed to diversity, inclusion, and reducing cancer disparities facing historically underserved populations.\n\nThe Office of Health Equity spearheads in-person and virtual outreach efforts to educate historically marginalized and underserved communities throughout Duke Cancer Institute’s catchment area about the importance of routine care, which includes regular health screenings to detect and manage chronic illnesses and prevent cancer. We also connect people with a cancer diagnosis to the most appropriate healthcare facility for treatment. Our programs include screening events and attendance at health fairs.\n\nDCI-OfficeofHealthEquity@dm.duke.edu\n\nPhone: 919-684-0409\n\nPatient Navigation Services\n\nOur patient navigators are trained to work closely with people in the community before and when a cancer-related concern becomes known. Their services include:\n\nBilingual education on cancer prevention, risk factors, and screening guidelines.\n\nConnecting people with recommended cancer screenings, treatment needs, and finding a primary care provider or medical home.\n\nHelping people find financial assistance for needed cancer-related medical care.\n\nDirecting people to healthcare services for further diagnosis and referral for treatment navigation.\n\nKeep track of and help people get to their medical appointments.\n\nCoordinate care with people’s medical teams.\n\nThe patient navigators serve everyone in the community regardless of insurance or documentation status.\n\nIn-Person and Virtual Community Events\n\nThe Office of Health Equity organizes free prevention and screening events and participates in community events, health fairs, and church gatherings to connect with people from historically underserved populations. Our team distributes information in person and virtually to increase awareness about the risks of cancer and help people in these communities find ways to overcome barriers such as not having health insurance.\n\nMen’s Health Screening and Awareness Event\n\nEach year, OHE partners with Duke Primary Care-Croasdaile, and Lincoln Community Health Center (a local federally qualified health center), to host a free Men's Health Screening and Awareness event aimed at improving the health outcomes of men in the community. Taking place the first weekend of June, the event offers screenings for prostate, skin, and colon cancers, as well as lung cancer risk assessments. Educational resources and assessments for chronic health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and HIV/Hepatitis C are also provided.\n\nPatient navigators work with participants who receive abnormal test or screening results and concerning findings to help address health concerns by connecting them with accessible, comprehensive, and high-quality primary and specialty care, health education resources, and/or additional patient navigation services. Learn more about Men's Health Screening.\n\nWomen’s Health Awareness Day\n\nThe Office of Health Equity provides cancer education and screenings during Women’s Health Awareness Day, an annual conference typically held in April that aims to increase awareness and knowledge among women to help promote better health.\n\nThe Office of Health Equity cancer education sessions feature experts and cancer survivors who provide women with information about cancer risk factors, prevention, relevant and recommended screening guidelines, and helpful information related to a survivor’s personal journey with cancer. The cancer screening room generally includes multiple recommended cancer screening and patient navigation services to follow up on any abnormal or concerning findings.\n\nThe health conference is sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the Durham Alumnae Chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., the Durham Alumnae Delta House, Inc., and the Public Health Education Department at North Carolina Central University (NCCU).\n\nCommunity Health Ambassador Program – Virtual Training\n\nThe Office of Health Equity team members provide virtual trainings for leaders in faith and community organizations to teach them how to spread the word about preventing and screening for cancer, hypertension, and diabetes. The leaders also learn how to set up a health advocacy team or health ministry within their own organization. So far, the program has reached more than 50 organizations in 40 North Carolina counties.\n\nThe office has worked with the trained Community Health Ambassadors to develop programs for their specific communities. For example, we coordinated virtual events providing information on specific types of cancers to include a Spanish-language Facebook Live event organized with the Mexican Consulate in Raleigh which drew 469 participants.\n\nThe office assists DCI scientists in refining research ideas and proposals to promote the principles of community engagement and assist with finding collaborators and partners who can contribute to ongoing studies. The office does so by:\n\nProviding Feedback\n\nOn recruitment, retention, and community engagement.\n\nFrom community advisory council members on research proposals, or projects.\n\nFacilitating Connections\n\nWe help identify collaborators or community partners.\n\nWe assist in outreach to diverse populations for recruitment and retention.\n\nWe encourage participation in COEE events to generate new ideas and collaborations.\n\nSupporting Evidence\n\nEpidemiologic data on the burden of cancer in our catchment area.\n\nDescription of DCI catchment area demographics and SDOH.\n\nLanguage on COEE, CAC, and community partner resources for proposals.\n\nPilot Funding\n\nDCI community-engaged research pilot grants.\n\nDIRECT Program\n\nThe DIRECT (Diversifying Research and Experiential Learning in Cancer Training) Fellowship program promotes cancer research equity among minority trainees through mentorship, professional development, and science communication. The 12-month applied research opportunity aims to create a diverse, innovative, and impactful experience in the cancer research workforce.\n\nLearn More\n\nCommunity Outreach and Engagement Foundational Training Modules\n\nAccess Module 1 CITI Training\n\nGo to your CITI member page and click on “View Courses” next to Duke Health.\n\nScroll down and click “Add a Course.\"\n\nSelect “Community-Engaged and Community-Based Participatory Research.” Click Next.
