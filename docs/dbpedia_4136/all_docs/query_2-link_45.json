        "text": "For the Academic Libraries North event ‘You Said, We Did’\n\nA post by Faculty Librarian Ben Taylorson\n\nWith Zoom and Teams now part of everyday working practices for many of us, the need to physically go somewhere for ‘a thing’ has diminished. But I do like a good, old-fashioned ‘in person’ event. So, when the chance came to travel to the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) to meet with a group of fellow librarians for a morning of information sharing, I took it.\n\nI arrived the night before the event, and thus was able to have a bit of a mooch about in Preston. I’d been a couple of times before, but only to the football ground to see my beloved Boro win once and get thrashed once. After having a wander and buying a meal deal from Tesco, I then retired to the comfort of the Premier Inn where I ate a BLT sandwich and 2 boiled eggs whilst watching Police Interceptors (I feel this is the realistic glimpse behind the curtain of the life of a librarian you were looking for).\n\nContinue reading “A trip to Preston” →\n\nFind out more about the benefits of self-archiving and going “green”\n\nIf you are publishing research at Durham University, it is likely that you’ve had some contact with the ‘DRO team’ (i.e. the staff who manage Durham Research Online).\n\nOne of the DRO team’s main responsibilities is supporting academics to self-archive their outputs. You may receive email reminders, or receive a notification from us on Worktribe, reminding you to deposit your accepted manuscript – but what is an accepted manuscript and why is it so important to deposit?\n\nContinue reading “Know your open access options” →\n\nEach month we spotlight one of our databases to highlight the range of resources available to our users. This month, Business Faculty Librarian Ben Taylorson turns the spotlight on a database we have on trial.\n\nWe are frequently approached by resource providers who are keen to have us trial their databases – obviously they do this as they are hoping we might add their product to our overall portfolio of resources. One such resource that we have on trial currently is the Henry Stewart Talks (HS Talks) Business and Management Collection.\n\nContinue reading “eResource of the month: Henry Stewart Talks Business and Management Collection (being trialled during February-March 2024)” →"
