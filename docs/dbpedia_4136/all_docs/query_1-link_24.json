Given the increasing role the mathematical sciences play in a more quantitative society and some of the large investments that are being made in STEM research in the UK, there are opportunities and there are threats. It is always crucial that the theoretical parts of the discipline remain strong and vibrant, taking advantage of opportunities whenever possible, working broadly and openly so that the whole of the discipline flourishes. In the current environment, it is important to continue to support intellectual and geographic diversity, but also benefit from the large-scale funding.\" I always try to act on this: helping coordinate the LMS response to Covid-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, supporting Early Career Researchers and those who faced increased pressures during the pandemic; participating in discussions around major issues including Additional Funding for Mathematical Sciences; and starting discussions within LMS on environmental sustainability. I do this as an advocate for the community coming together, in its diversity.\n\nProfessor Cathy Hobbs\n\nVice-President\n\nChair of the Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research, University of Bristol\n\nHomepage:https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/catherine-a-hobbs\n\nPhD: University of Liverpool, 1993\n\nPrevious appointments: 1992–94 Teaching Fellow, University of Nottingham; 1994–2010 Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Head of Department/Associate Dean, Oxford Brookes University. 2010-2018 Head of Department of Engineering Design and Mathematics, University of the West of England, Bristol, 2018-2022 Associate Dean Research and Enterprise, Faculty of Environment and Technology, University of the West of England, Bristol, 2022-2023 Academic Dean, Faculty of Engineering, Environment and Computing, Coventry University.\n\nResearch interests: Singularity Theory and its applications, particularly to physical sciences\n\nLMS service: 1997-2000 and 2013-2017 Member at Large, LMS Council; 1998-2001 Chair LMS Women in Mathematics Committee; 2003-2007 and 2013-2018, member LMS Women in Mathematics Committee; 2003-2005, 2008-2010, 2013-14 Member of LMS Nominating Committee; 2008-2013 LMS representative on BMC Scientific Committee; 2015-present Member of LMS Publications Committee; 2017-present LMS Vice President; 2017-present Member of LMS Education Committee; 2017-present Chair of LMS Personnel Committee; 2019-present Member of the LMS Newsletter Editorial Board\n\nAdditional information: Chair of Heads of Departments of Mathematical Sciences Committee 2014–2017; Member of EMS Women in Mathematics Committee 2004–2010; Member of Standing Committee of European Women in Mathematics, 2001–2007; Fellow of the IMA; Member of IMA Council 2016-present, Honorary Education Secretary of the IMA 2023-present. Member of the Executive Committee of the proto-Academy of Mathematical Sciences, 2022-present. Principal Fellow of the HEA. National Teaching Fellow 2019.\n\nPersonal statement: I have had a long association with the LMS and have a firm belief in the importance of the Society to UK mathematics, as a membership organisation as well as a publisher and supporter of research mathematics across the broad range of mathematical activity in the UK. I have been involved in a number of aspects of LMS business over the last 25 years, including women in maths, publications and education committees. During my tenure as Vice President thus far I have taken on chairing Personnel Committee and become a member of the LMS Newsletter Editorial Board alongside my continuing membership of various other LMS Committees. I have the role of overseeing LMS Communications as part of my portfolio. I’m also involved at Executive level with the IMA and the proto-Academy for Mathematical Sciences which I believe enables me to bring useful connections and perspective to the LMS. I would be honoured to be able to continue to work for the Society as Vice President.\n\nProfessor Robb McDonald\n\nGeneral Secretary\n\nProfessor of Mathematics, University College London\n\nHomepage: https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=NRMCD79\n\nPhD: 1991 University of Western Australia\n\nPrevious appointments: 1991-93 Royal Society Endeavour Fellow, University of Oxford; 1993-94 Australian Research Council Research Fellow, Monash University; 1994--present Lecturer, Reader and Professor, UCL.\n\nResearch interests: fluid mechanics, vortex dynamics and applied complex analysis. Application of mathematics to geoscience.\n\nLMS service: General Secretary from November 2020\n\nAdditional information: 2011-18 Head of Department of Mathematics UCL; Fellow of the IMA\n\nPersonal statement: Having benefited personally from LMS support through its research funding schemes and Good Practice workshops, and witnessed the positive impact of the society’s activities (e.g. the undergraduate research bursary scheme), I am keen to help the Society realise its ambitions. While HoD at UCL I enjoyed working with departmental and university colleagues, as well as those from other London and UK universities, in supporting mathematical science, and addressing the challenges of equality and diversity of our discipline. I hope these experiences will be useful in the LMS General Secretary role. This is an exciting time to be mathematician with the proposed new Academy of Mathematical Science, increased funding opportunities and the public and policy makers increasingly aware of the important role science and mathematics does and can play in society. If elected General Secretary, I look forward to working with LMS colleagues and the mathematical community in ensuring LMS is well-placed to create and take advantage of opportunities, and that it has a strong voice in education, research and promotion of all areas of mathematical science. Finally, partly owing to my UCL association, I am aware of the remarkable history of the LMS—a history deserving of recognition and celebration.\n\nProfessor Chris Parker\n\nProgramme Secretary\n\nProfessor of Pure Mathematics, University of Birmingham\n\nHomepage: https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/maths/parker-christopher.aspx\n\nPhD: University of Manchester, 1988.\n\nResearch interests: Group theory, representation theory and related areas.\n\nLMS service: Regional organizer Midlands Region (2006-2019), chair Early Career Research Committee 2017-, chair Research Meetings Committee 2016, Programme Secretary 2018-, Member Publications Committee, Member of the LMS Covid Response working party, and Ukraine working party.\n\nAdditional information: Editor in chief of Journal of Group Theory. Organizer of Groups St Andrews in Birmingham 2017, organized numerous other workshops and conferences.\n\nPersonal statement: The breadth, health and vibrancy of the mathematical community in the UK is in no small part due to the backing and support added by the LMS. Through my leadership of the Early Career Research Committee over the last years, I have witnessed the impact of the LMS support offered to our undergraduate and postgraduate students, postdoctoral researchers and new lecturers. The activities of the Early Career Committee encourage the development of mathematicians nationwide. If re-elected as Programme Secretary, I will continue to be a strong advocate in support of these activities and will seek to advertise the support available as widely as possible. I will also emphasise the importance of continued support for Early Career Researchers. Feedback from our “Early Career Researcher Professional Development” series demonstrates that PhD students and postdoctoral researchers are eager to take advantage of advice and networking opportunities. With the economy in a weak position, job openings in UK universities may become even harder to secure and so programmes which support people at the beginnings of their career such as the LMS Early Career Fellowships may prove even more valuable in helping researchers establish academic careers. I will also continue to speak in support of mathematics as a research activity that can be practised at a world leading level in institutions across the country.\n\nProfessor Niall MacKay\n\nPublications Secretary\n\nProfessor of Mathematics, University of York\n\nHome page: https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/niall-mackay/\n\nPhD: University of Durham, 1992\n\nPrevious appointments: 1992-93: JSPS Fellow, RIMS, Kyoto University; 1993-95: PPARC Research Fellow and fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge; 1995-98: Stokes Fellow, Pembroke College, Cambridge; 1998-99: Lecturer, University of Sheffield; 2000-date: University of York: Lecturer (2000), Senior Lecturer (2005) Reader (2009), Professor (2014); Head of Department 2015-2021.\n\nResearch interests: Integrable systems and quantum groups; operations research and history.\n\nLMS service: LMS Education Committee 2004-09 and 2011-14; Editorial Adviser 2005-14; Council Member-at-Large from November 2020; Publications Committee and Personnel Committee from February 2021; LMS Newsletter Editorial Board from April 2021\n\nAdditional Information: Member of QAA MSOR benchmark statement review group 2005-08, Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education (ACME) 2011-14, MEI \"Critical Mathematics\" advisory group 2013-15, IoP Curriculum Committee 2013-15, and various other committees and working groups for the ILTHE, HEA, QCDA etc. Member of EPSRC Peer Review College 2003-10.

Editorial Board member, Teaching Mathematics and its Applications, 2014-2021\n\nCurrently Chair of Correspondents for the INI and ICMS (2019-date).\n\nPersonal Statement: I stepped down as Head of Department at York in 2021, and am now enjoying my renewed involvement with the LMS. Publications Secretary is a difficult job, both strategically and operationally, during an era of great change in academic publishing. As we navigate the transition to Open Access, I hope to preserve our income as far as possible, so that it can continue to be used to support the mathematics community, and to preserve and enhance the quality and standing of the LMS journals within world mathematics and thereby their value to UK mathematicians, both as authors and as readers. These two goals are in an ever-shifting state of tension.\n\nProfessor Mary McAlinden\n\nEducation Secretary\n\nDeputy Dean and Professor, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University\n\nHomepage: http://www.ntu.ac.uk/staff-profiles/science-technology/mary-mcalinden\n\nPhD: University of Belfast, 1992.\n\nPrevious appointments: 1992-1993 Teaching and Research Assistant, University of Western Brittany; 1993-1997, Research Fellow, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge; 1997-1999, Senior Lecturer Staffordshire University; 1999-2015 Senior Lecturer/Principal Lecturer Oxford Brookes University; 2011-2014 Discipline Lead for Mathematics, Statistics and Operational Research, Higher Education Academy; 2015-2020 Head of Department/Deputy Head of School/Professor, University of Greenwich.\n\nResearch interests: Mathematics in Higher Education.\n\nLMS service: Member, Invited Speaker LMS Education Days .\n\nAdditional information: Chair of Heads of Departments of Mathematical Sciences (HoDoMS) (2020-present); Secretary of HoDoMS (2015-2020); Member of the Office for Students TEF Natural Sciences Panel (2018-2019); Member of the Royal Society Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education (ACME) (2014-2018); Member of the QAA Subject Benchmark Review/Advisory Groups (2014-2015, 2022-2023 respectively); Fellow of the IMA (FIMA); Principal Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (PFHEA).\n\nPersonal statement: Having worked across the higher education mathematics sector in roles such as Chair of HoDoMS, a Mathematical Sciences expert on the Office for Students TEF Natural Sciences Panel, and as Discipline Lead for Mathematics, Statistics and Operational Research at the Higher Education Academy, I have acquired an in-depth understanding of the richness and diversity of educational provision within the mathematics discipline across the UK. I have worked collaboratively with many mathematical organisations and institutions across the UK, including those focussing on the delivery of the subject at pre-university level. I have a particular interest in the transition into university and have led project work in this area, including while I was at the Higher Education Academy. I have also served as a member of the Royal Society’s Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education. As a Deputy Dean leading on teaching and learning and the student experience, I have an up-to-date knowledge and understanding of the current education landscape, both within mathematics and more widely. I understand well the current and emerging opportunities and challenges that the sector is facing.\n\nAs a member of the LMS for many years, a recipient of an LMS Education Grant, and having attended LMS events both as a participant and an invited speaker, I have seen the enormous value of the work that the Society makes to the mathematics community in many spheres. If elected, I would be honoured to serve as Education Secretary and contribute to continuing the development of the Society’s valuable and wide-ranging portfolio of education activity.\n\nProfessor Sara Lombardo\n\nMember-at-Large (Women and Diversity)\n\nProfessor of Mathematics, Heriot Watt University\n\nHomepage: https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/sara-lombardo\n\nPhD: University of Leeds, 2004\n\nPrevious appointments: I have held various post-doctoral positions in Leeds, Manchester, Rome and Amsterdam, before returning to the UK in 2010, accepting a Senior Lectureship at Northumbria University in Newcastle upon Tyne. I was promoted to Reader in 2014 and served as Head of Mathematics between 2014 and 2017. I obtained a personal Chair in 2017 and I am currently the Executive Dean/Head of School of the School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at Heriot-Watt University and a member of the Maxwell Institute for Mathematical sciences in Edinburgh.\n\nResearch interests: Integrable systems, a lively area of mathematics which brings together algebra, analysis and geometry to tackle fundamental problems often motivated by mathematical physics\n\nLMS service: Since 2017 member of the Women in Mathematics Committee, now Women and Diversity in Mathematics Committee, and of the Good Practice Scheme steering group; since 2021 Chair of the Committee.\n\nAdditional information: I am a member of the IMA Council and IMA Research Committee. I am the Chair of the EPSRC Strategic Advisory Team for Mathematical Sciences (2022-2024). I have organised several research workshops and conferences, in the UK and abroad, often as chair of the organising committees. I have been guest editor of volumes and collections and I am currently on the editorial boards of two journals. Since 2021, I serve on the Scientific Steering Committee of the Isaac Newton Institute. I have led Equality (Equity), Diversity and Inclusion initiatives, both nationally and internationally; I am currently leading the ED&I workstream of the (proto) Academy for the Mathematical Sciences.\n\nPersonal statement: I am a keen advocate of the role of mathematics in the society, and of the unique contribution that mathematical sciences bring to other STEM disciplines and to the economy. I believe that it is important to promote interdisciplinary research as well as to emphasise the importance of fundamental research, especially in this moment of changes and uncertainty. I also believe that embracing diversity – in all its aspects – is key to successfully tackle research challenges and to create a welcoming and truly inclusive environment for the UK mathematics community. The LMS clearly has one of the key roles to play with the Women and Diversity in Mathematics Committee and I am keen to contribute with my experience, ideally influencing also the EPSRC and UKRI; the Committee has started a number of projects which I would like to see completed in the next two years.\n\nProfessor Peter Ashwin\n\nProfessor of Mathematics, University of Exeter\n\nPhD: University of Warwick 1991.\n\nPrevious appointments: 1991-92 Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Marburg (Germany); 1992-95 Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Warwick; 1995-96 Postdoctoral Researcher, INLN Nice (France); 1996-2000 Lecturer in Mathematics, University of Surrey\n\nResearch interests: My research interests are in dynamical systems theory and applications, including low dimensional systems, theory of attractors, bifurcation theory, coupled and nonautonomous systems, computational modelling and applications, mostly in life and environmental sciences.\n\nLMS service: Member of London Mathematical Society since 1991, member of LMS Council 2020-2022.\n\nAdditional information: I have been active in the UK mathematical community as part of the MAGIC Taught Course Centre, and have been serving as Director since 2016. I was co-founder of the UK Mathematics for Climate research network “CliMathNet”, which has been promoting scientific interchange between climate science, mathematics and statistics since 2013. My research has been supported by a range of sources including EPSRC, BBSRC, Leverhulme and EU Horizon 2020. At the University of Exeter I have served in various academic management roles, including, at various times, Head of Department and Director of Education. I am currently the Director of Research and Impact.\n\nPersonal statement: I believe a lot of the strength of mathematics comes from the interaction of pure and applied branches. Although interactions may occur quite slowly with some areas, for others (such as dynamical systems) rapid communication between theory, experiment and simulation has been possible and this has resulted in some remarkable new mathematics. Through my experience at the Department of Mathematics at Exeter and through mentoring many PhDs and early career researchers, I have gained a good understanding of many of the challenges, opportunities and trade-offs that are facing departments and individual members of the LMS. Throughout its existence, the LMS has helped ensure that the mathematical community of the UK benefits from intellectual exchange at the highest international level (via exchange of people, ideas and funding). I am keen for the LMS to work to ensure that these benefits remain with us in the longer term. On the one hand, we need to benefit from traditional modes for sharing mathematics. On the other hand, we can benefit from many recent developments in the technology of how sharing mathematics can take place.\n\nProfessor Anne Taormina\n\nProfessor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Durham University\n\nHomepage: https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/anne-taormina/\n\nPhD: University of Mons-Hainaut, Belgium, 1984\n\nPrevious appointments: 1984–86: Chargé de Recherches, Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS), University of Mons-Hainaut, Belgium; 1986–87: Chercheur Associé, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris, France; 1987–89: CERN Fellow, Theory Division, Geneva, Switzerland;\n\n1989–91: Enrico Fermi Fellow, University of Chicago, USA; 1991–96: SERC Advanced Fellow, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Durham University, UK; 1996–97: Temporary Lecturer, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Durham University, UK; 1997–00: Leverhulme Fellow, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Durham University, UK; 2000–04: Lecturer, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Durham University, UK; 2004–06 : Reader, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Durham University, UK; 2006–present: Professor of Mathematics, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Durham University, UK; EPSRC Springboard Fellowship (Oct 2006–Sept 2007); Leverhulme Research Fellowship (Jan 2013–Dec 2013); Head of Department (Jan 2014–Dec 2018).\n\nResearch interests: Conformal Field Theory and String Theory. I use group theory, algebraic geometry and number theory in my research, which is mainly at the interface with theoretical particle physics. My most recent research interest is to understand the implications of newly observed Moonshine phenomena in the context of string theory and conformal field theory.\n\nLMS service: member since 1999; Member of the LMS Women in Mathematics committee and of the LMS Good Practice Scheme committee (2014-2020); Member-at-Large of Council since 2019; Member of Personnel Committee since 2021.\n\nPersonal statement: As a member of Council seeking reappointment, I will use my experience as Head of the Mathematical Sciences Department at Durham for five years and as a member of the LMS Women in Mathematics committee since 2014 to continue to tackle the factors influencing the course of a career in Mathematics, especially for young women nowadays. For example, I will continue to explore possibilities for the LMS to be involved in initiatives targeting youngsters preparing for their GCSE exams, especially those from more challenging backgrounds and minorities. In particular, I will continue to promote the fun aspects of mathematics and help design activities to boost girls' confidence in their mathematical abilities. Although I believe that profound changes must happen already at primary school stage, a targeted effort at GCSE level to interest a higher proportion of talented girls in mathematics and its applications will help achieve a healthy gender balance and genuine diversity in mathematical studies at A-level and higher/further education. I am particularly keen that excellence in mathematics be recognised, whatever the gender of the researcher. Generally, I am interested in furthering the cause of any mathematician who has an innovative idea in mathematical education and needs support.\n\nProfessor Jason D Lotay\n\nProfessor of Pure Mathematics and Fellow at Balliol College, University of Oxford\n\nHome page: https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/lotay/\n\nPhD: University of Oxford, 2006\n\nPrevious appointments: 2005-07/08-09 Junior Research Fellow in Science, University College, Oxford; 2007-08 NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow (held at MSRI, Berkeley, USA); 2009-14 EPSRC Career Acceleration Fellow (2009-11 held at Imperial College, London; 2011-14 held at UCL); 2011-18 Reader/Professor, UCL.\n\nResearch Interests: Special geometries, particularly related to special holonomy, minimal submanifolds, gauge theory, geometric flows and theoretical physics, mainly via differential geometry and geometric analysis techniques.\n\nLMS service: I was the LMS Representative for UCL from 2012 to 2018.

Took part in the Royal Society Pairing Scheme 2015: a very selective scheme providing an opportunity for researchers to spend a week in Westminster paired with an MP or civil servant, allowing insight into the workings of parliament. Written feature article on research for Physics World (2017), article on research for El Pais (2018), and contributed to Daily Mail and Telegraph articles on social distancing (2020). Twice interviewed on radio about research and public engagement: BBC Science Café and BBC Radio 4 Word of Mouth. Co-organized and delivered Art and Maths workshops for general public and teachers (2013-2017) with artist Lilah Fowler. Supervised several undergraduate summer research project students funded by LMS and EPSRC.\n\nPersonal statement: I am passionate about public engagement and outreach, as well as engaging with research funders and policy makers. My aim is always to truly communicate the excitement and importance of mathematics at all levels from elementary school mathematics to current research. I am dedicated to promoting all areas of mathematics, with a particular emphasis on pure mathematics, which I feel requires additional support given the current focus on practical applications and economic impact. I therefore believe that, with these qualities and my experience in communication and engagement, I can make an important contribution to the valuable work the LMS does for mathematics in the UK.\n\nProfessor Elaine Crooks\n\nProfessor, Department of Mathematics, Swansea University\n\nHomepage: https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/science/maths/e.c.m.crooks/\n\nPhD: University of Bath, 1996\n\nPrevious appointments: Lecturer/Associate Professor Swansea, 2007-2019; Darby Fellow, Lincoln College, Oxford, 2002-2007; Junior Research Fellow, Balliol College, Oxford, 1999-2002; EPSRC postdoc 1996-1999; short term postdoc positions in Lausanne, Paris, Rome.\n\nResearch interests: Nonlinear partial differential equations; singular limits of elliptic and parabolic systems; reaction-diffusion-convection systems and travelling waves; applications of PDE to biology; geometric methods for image processing.\n\nLMS service: Editorial Advisory Board 2009-2018; Member-at-Large of Council, from 2019; Publications Committee, from 2020; Council Diarist, from 2020; LMS Representative to ICIAM, since 2021.\n\nAdditional information: EPSRC Peer Review College, from 2018; Participation in various panels for EPSRC, including as chair, and for UKRI Future Leaders Fellowships; Deputy Head of Department for Research and Engagement/Acting Head of Mathematics, Swansea University, 2019-2021; Head of the School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Swansea University, from 2021; Co-director of Swansea Centre for Biomathematics, from 2016.\n\nPersonal statement: Having benefited from the LMS in many ways since my time as a PhD student, I would like to continue to contribute to the ongoing success of the LMS through being a Member-at-Large of Council. I bring a perspective of someone who does research with the flavour of both pure and applied mathematics, and think that much less distinction should be made between the two. I believe that research of the highest quality is, and should be, undertaken at institutions all over the UK, and LMS grants and research schools should continue to enable as many mathematicians as possible, including early career researchers, to grow and fulfil their potential as researchers and academics. I also feel that a crucial role needs to be played by learned societies such as the LMS in advocating the nature and needs of their discipline to institutions, funders and government.\n\nProfessor Gregory Sankaran\n\nProfessor of Pure Mathematics, University of Bath\n\nHome page: https://people.bath.ac.uk/masgks\n\nPhD: University of Cambridge, 1986.\n\nPrevious appointments: 1986-88 SRC Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Nijmegen; 1988-95 College Lecturer & Fellow, St Catharine’s College, Cambridge; 1995-present Lecturer/Reader/Professor, University of Bath.\n\nResearch interests: Algebraic geometry, especially moduli theory, and interactions with number theory and with computer science..\n\nLMS service: Editorial advisor for LMS publications on Algebraic Geometry, 2003-2013.\n\nAdditional information: Member of the local organising committee of British Mathematical Colloquium 2023; member of EPSRC College since 2004 and of Strategic Advisory Team for Mathematical Sciences since 2020; co-organiser of LMS scheme 3 collaborative seminar COW, 1992-2018; member of Programme Committee of ICMS Edinburgh since 2020; MARM mentor, Makerere University, Kampala (supported by LMS), 2008-2012; Commonwealth Scholarship Committee Academic Advisor Panel since 2022.\n\nPersonal statement: I believe that mathematics in the UK is currently in a strong position, being both very successful and often highly regarded nationally and internationally. That regard does not automatically translate into action supportive of mathematics, and success does not automatically breed success. The LMS has an important role to play in ensuring that both these things do happen: by influencing decision makers in collaboration with others; by widening and strengthening the position and appeal of mathematics in the UK; and by directly supporting national and international initiatives. I can contribute to this effort because of my experience of working with government bodies, because I have built collaborations and diverse collaborative structures (LMS Scheme 3 was modelled on COW, not the other way round) and because like most mathematicians I work internationally. In particular mathematics is underrepresented in the global South, especially Africa, and the LMS has done important work to change that.\n\nDr Andrew D. Brooke-Taylor\n\nAssociate Professor, School of Mathematics, University of Leeds\n\nHome page: https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/4010/dr-andrew-brooke-taylor\n\nPhD: University of Vienna, 2007\n\nResearch interests: Set theory and its applications to other areas of mathematics, particularly category theory and topology.\n\nAdditional information: Co-organiser (since 2022) of LMS Scheme 3 network Set Theory in the UK. Organiser or co-organiser for various conferences, including Accessible categories and their connections: set theory, model theory, homotopy theory (Leeds, 2018), and the 2017 “Young Set Theory Workshop” New directions in the higher infinite (ICMS, Edinburgh). EPSRC Mathematics Prioritisation Panel member, 2014 and 2017. Panellist in UK Games Expo 2015 panel discussion The mathematics of games..\n\nPersonal statement: I am enthusiastic to do my bit to support the UK mathematics community through membership of the LMS council - helping to maintain what the LMS does well, while working to address the challenges our community faces, such as in equality, diversity and inclusion, and the academic career pipeline. I am someone with broad mathematical interests, based in a relatively small but active subfield, with my research drawing connections to other parts of the discipline. As such I believe I am well-placed to represent on council the interests of mathematicians from across the community.\n\nProfessor Sarah Whitehouse\n\nProfessor of Pure Mathematics, University of Sheffield\n\nHome page: https://sarah-whitehouse.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/\n\nPhD: University of Warwick, 1994\n\nPrevious appointments: 1994-1996 Lecturer (fixed term), University of Warwick; 1996-1998 Marie-Curie Postdoctoral Researcher, Université Paris 13; 1998-2002 Maître de Conférences (Lecturer), Université d'Artois; 2002-2014 Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Reader, University of Sheffield\n\nResearch interests: Algebraic Topology, Homotopical Algebra\n\nLMS service: Research Meetings Committee 2015-2017, Early Career Research Committee 2017-2021\n\nAdditional information: Co-organiser since 2010 of the Transpennine Topology Triangle, one of the longest-running LMS scheme 3 networks; longstanding commitment to Women in Topology, as a team leader, co-organiser and member of the steering group; commitment to supporting early career stages, including involvement in LMS Prospects in Mathematics, Young Researchers in Mathematics and LMS Undergraduate Summer Schools.\n\nPersonal statement: Over the last few exceptionally challenging years, it has been heartening to see the excellent work of the LMS in many areas, including its pandemic response, its support for early career stages and for under-represented groups and its work in supporting mathematicians seeking refuge in the UK. I view service work for the LMS as a key way in which I can make an effective and positive contribution to the mathematical community.\n\nThe LMS has a crucial role in representing mathematics, explaining its importance in addressing huge challenges such as climate change, and making the case for a broad base of mathematical research, including foundational aspects whose potential applications may not emerge for decades.\n\nI would bring experience of research coordination, commitment to supporting early career stages and women in mathematics, as well as a willingness to engage with the problems facing the mathematical community and the HE sector in the UK. Experience as deputy head of my department over the last four years had led to insight into some of the challenges faced by colleagues at all career stages and with a wide variety of personal circumstances.\n\nDr Jessica Enright\n\nSenior Lecturer, School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow\n\nHomepage: http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jenright/\n\nPhD: University of Alberta, 2011\n\nPrevious appointments: 2018-2019 Lecturer in Global Academy of Agriculture and Food Security, University of Edinburgh. 2015-2018 Lecturer in Mathematical Biology, University of Stirling. 2012-2015 postdoctoral research associate modelling animal disease outbreaks, University of Glasgow\n\nResearch interests: Graph theory and complex networks, particularly graphs and networks with temporal, spatial, or geometric structure. Combinatorial games on graphs. Applications and modelling involving infectious disease.\n\nLMS service: LMS Newsletter Editorial Board Member since 2020, LMS Council member-at-large and Education Committee member since 2021.\n\nAdditional information: From 2016 to 2018 I was a member of the EPSRC early-career forum for mathematics. I have been the General Secretary of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society since 2017, and a member of the Young Academy of Scotland since 2018. I have regularly contributed to industrial study groups, and have been active in events run by the Virtual Knowledge Exchange in Mathematics during the pandemic\n\nPersonal statement: Through the last decade working in the UK, I have been privileged to take on roles allowing me to serve the mathematics community and advocate for the mathematical sciences. I am keen to take these activities forward as part of LMS council. I work at the intersection of mathematics and theoretical computing science, and so believe I could particularly well represent society members who work across disciplines.\n\nI am also interested in how the LMS might increase its engagement with student members of the UK’s mathematical sciences community, and am hoping to investigate a student chapter or student-led event model.\n\nThe LMS and the maths community more broadly face challenges (e.g. related to changing funding and publication models and the marketisation of higher education), but I believe that a renewed appreciation of the importance of mathematics to our wider society by policy-makers will lead to opportunities. I strongly believe that these can best be captured by advocating for and supporting the whole mathematics community with a coordinated approach, and this would inform my approach to council service. Supporting diversity within mathematics is important, including across mathematicians' backgrounds and identities, career stages, research interests, and geographic locations.\n\nProfessor Minhyong Kim\n\nDirector of the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences; Whittaker Professor of Mathematical Sciences, Maxwell Institute; Christopher Zeeman Professor of Algebra, Geometry, and Public Understanding of Mathematics, University of Warwick; Distinguished Professor, Korea Institute for Advanced Study\n\nHomepage: https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/mkim\n\nPh.D.: Yale University (1990)\n\nPrevious Appointments: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Columbia University, University of Arizona, Purdue University, University College London, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Ewha Womans University, University of Oxford\n\nResearch Interests: Arithmetic Geometry, Topology, Mathematical Physics\n\nLMS Service: Member-at-Large of Council (2020-22), Michael Atiyah Fellowship Panel (2021-), Editorial Board of LMS publications (2013-14), Editorial Board of Mathematika (2008-17), LMS representative on ICMS Board (2014-19)\n\nAdditional Information: As general service to the profession, I have been an organiser for numerous workshops and conferences, including a 5 month programme at the Newton Institute (2009), a Durham Symposium (2011), an AMS Summer Institute (2015), the Asian-French Summer School on Algebraic Geometry and Number Theory (2006), and several years of the Arizona Winter School on Arithmetic Geometry. I have also been on the organising committee for the ICM 2014. I have been on the scientific committee of the Korean Mathematical Society (2011-2016) and the prize committee of the American Mathematical Society (2019-2021). I am a co-editor-in-chief (with Katrin Wendland) for the Springer Monographs in Mathematics. I am on the Scientific Steering Committee of the Isaac Newton Institute and a member of the External Advisory Board of the Bath Institute for Mathematical Innovation.\n\nPersonal Statement: I have substantial experience working in the mathematical communities of three continents, Asia, North America, and Europe. I am also on the editorial board of the Tunisian Journal of Mathematics, which is perhaps one of the premier scholarly outlets available in Africa. Mathematics among the other academic disciplines has always greatly benefitted from the coherence and openness of the global community, in which the UK plays a prominent role. I hope to bring to the Council an international perspective and the ability to communicate easily with people from different regions of the world. I have substantial experience with mathematical outreach. In addition to quite a bit of direct engagement, I have written six books for the general public. `The Moment You Need Mathematics' (2018) was on the list of top 20 bestsellers in Korea for eight weeks. My experience with public communication is something I hope might benefit the LMS. Finally, I have held professorships at 9 different universities, leading to a broad perspective of the strengths and weaknesses of different environments for research and teaching. I hope this kind of knowledge is useful to the diverse constituency that the LMS is expected to serve.\n\nDr Rachel Newton\n\nReader in Number Theory, King's College London\n\nHomepage: https://sites.google.com/view/rachelnewton\n\nPhD: University of Cambridge, 2012\n\nPrevious appointments: 2012 - 2013 postdoc, Leiden University; 2013 - 2014 postdoc, Max Planck Institute for Mathematics (MPIM); 2014 postdoc, Leiden University; 2014 - 2015 European Post-Doctoral Institute Fellow, MPIM and IHES; 2016 - 2021 Lecturer/Associate Professor, University of Reading; 2020 - present UKRI Future Leaders Fellow\n\nResearch interests: Number theory, especially rational points on algebraic varieties, local-global principles and Braeur-Manin obstructions\n\nLMS service: Member-at-Large of Council from 2021; member of the joint editorial board of the Journal and Bulletin of the LMS from 2023; member of the Early Career Research Committee 2017 – 2023 (deputy chair 2021 – 2023); Cecil King Travel Scholarship panel chair in 2021 and panel member in 2022; LMS Departmental Representative for the University of Reading 2016 – 2017.\n\nAdditional information: Co-organiser of the LMS Scheme 3 research network ERLASS (Egham–Reading–London Arithmetic Statistics Seminar) 2019 – 2021; member of the EPSRC External Communications Group advisory network 2022 – 2023; member of the EPSRC Mathematical Sciences Early Career Forum 2018 – 2021; member of the Women in Numbers Steering Committee from 2016; regular participation in grant panels (EPSRC, NSF); UCU departmental representative for Mathematics and Statistics at Reading 2020 – 2021; co-organiser of several conferences in number theory as well as broader interest events such as the LMS Women in Mathematics Day (Reading 2022), LMS Prospects in Mathematics Meeting (Reading 2017) and Young Researchers in Mathematics (Cambridge 2010).\n\nPersonal statement: The 2006 LMS Prospects in Mathematics Meeting was my first glimpse of contemporary mathematical research, and a chance to meet other mathematicians who went on to become friends and collaborators. Since then, I have co-organised many of the LMS-sponsored events I attended as a young researcher. I see Council membership as another way of giving back.\n\nThe community-building activities of the LMS are especially important in this era of remote working and online meetings. I am concerned about the difficulties facing early career mathematicians without strong professional networks or job security, and the danger of hybrid meetings inadvertently creating second-class citizens.\n\nMy PhD students have made me keenly aware of the visa-related and cash-flow issues that face international researchers on low pay and I think there is an opportunity for the LMS to help remove some of these barriers to participation.\n\nIn my first term on Council, I advocated for a stronger defence of mathematics departments facing cuts and redundancies. If re-elected, I will continue to pursue this cause as well as seeking to make mathematics more inclusive at every level. I also think there is scope for an LMS good practice scheme around anti-casualisation and supporting early career mathematicians.\n\nDr Amanda Turner\n\nProfessor, University of Leeds\n\nHome page: https://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~turnera/\n\nPhD: University of Cambridge, 2007\n\nPrevious appointments: Lecturer and then Senior Lecturer, Lancaster University (2007-2022); Visiting Professor, University of Geneva (2018-2020), College Teaching Fellow, Selwyn College, University of Cambridge (2006-2007);\n\nResearch interests: Probability, complex analysis and mathematical physics, with a specific interest in random growth models.\n\nLMS service: Member of Council since 2020, Research Grants Committee since 2017 and Publications Committee since 2018; Editorial Advisor for the LMS journals since 2016.\n\nAdditional information: Founding member of the Applied Probability Section of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS), Vice Chair (2012-2014) and Chair (2014-2016). Member of Nominations Committee of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) (2018-2022).\n\nPersonal statement: My first term as a Council member coincided with the Covid crisis, which imposed profound changes on the mathematical community. I see the LMS as a centre of the mathematical community within the UK, and as a natural body within which to share good practice and resources, and to address the challenges faced by PhD students, early career researchers and minority groups. I therefore use my position over the last two years to push for changes which support the community in becoming more diverse and sustainable. As a member of Council, the LMS Covid Working Group, the Research Grants Committee and the Publications Committee, I have worked hard to ensure that the LMS resources are deployed in a way which benefits all members of the community. However, I believe that still more can be done to engage directly with minority groups and early-career mathematicians to find out their opinions and how they can be best served by the LMS. As a member of Council, I will continue to ensure that groups across all career stages and all branches of mathematics are consulted and listened to as we face new challenges and opportunities."
