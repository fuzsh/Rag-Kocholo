        "text": "A new Egyptian gallery at Durham University’s Oriental Museum opens to the public tomorrow (Friday, February 26), following a £100,000 refurbishment that has taken six months.\n\nIts star attraction will be “The Lady”, the stunning mummy and coffin of a woman who died in her 50s around 300BC.\n\nLittle is known about her life, as the part of her coffin that would have detailed it is worn, but she is believed to have been very wealthy and important. Intriguingly, she was buried with an artificial limb, made of linen and plaster, believed to be the oldest surviving anywhere in the world.\n\nThe Lady is thought to have been rediscovered in an Egyptian cemetery in 1884 and taken to Penrith. She spent 30 years at Darlington Library before being moved to Durham.\n\nBut while she may be the most eye-grabbing exhibit, for Egyptologists the real treasure is a six-inch high wooden figurine depicting a serving girl carrying a jar, that would have been used to store eye make-up.\n\nDating from 1,360BC, it is the best of a very small group of objects surviving from a very short period when Egyptian artists defied the usual rules and experimented with lifelike pieces.\n\nThe Oriental Museum is the only museum in the north of the UK dedicated to Oriental art and archaeology.\n\nRenamed the Thacker Gallery in honour of Professor TW Thacker, who was the first head of Durham University’s School of Oriental Studies and whose dream it was to found the museum, the Egyptian gallery has been extended and refurbished, with improved security and environmental controls to protect the treasures on show.\n\nPieces not previously on show include a box used to hold organs during mummification, early pottery from 4,500BC, an alien-like figure used in magic from 3,200BC and a 3,500-year-old bronze dagger.\n\nMuseum curator Rachel Barclay said: “The Oriental Museum is home to the largest and most important collection of Ancient Egyptian material in the North East of England.\n\n“The aim of this project has been to showcase the very best objects in this wonderful collection as well as we can. We hope that visitors will enjoy the results.”\n\nShe added: “It’s always been my favourite gallery and it’s always bene popular. It’s been nerve-wracking but we knew it could be better and now it’s even better than I imagined.”\n\nThe Oriental Musuem, on Elvet Hill, Durham, is open from Monday to Friday from 10am to 5pm and at weekends and on bank holidays from noon to 5pm. Entry costs £1.50 for adults, 75p for children aged five to 16 and over-60s and free for under-fives and students. Call 0191-334-5694 or visit durham.ac.uk/oriental.museum"
