        "text": "Oriental Museum, Durham (must see)\n\nThe Oriental Museum is part of the University of Durham, formerly the Gulbenkian Museum of Oriental Art and Archaeology. Established in 1960, the museum now has over 23,000 pieces of Asian art and artifacts.\n\nThe museum was created by the University of Durham's School of Oriental Studies. The school wanted to place all the eastern treasures in one place where they could be seen, admired, and preserved.\n\nExhibition items come from China, Egypt, the Korean Peninsula, the Indian subcontinent, and Japan. The Chinese collection is the largest, with more than 10,000 objects from the Zhou dynasty through the Qing dynasty. Not so vast is the Korean exhibit, which has around 500 pieces from the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties.\n\nThe Ancient Egypt items include an 18th dynasty funeral mask, a funerary figure of Prince Bahmery, and a statue from the reign of Ramses II, among the other 6,700 objects.\n\nThe museum received \"The Bronze Hear by Right\" award from the National Youth Agency in 2012.\n\nCreate Your Own Walk in Durham\n\nCreating your own self-guided walk in Durham is easy and fun. Choose the city attractions that you want to see and a walk route map will be created just for you. You can even set your hotel as the start point of the walk."
