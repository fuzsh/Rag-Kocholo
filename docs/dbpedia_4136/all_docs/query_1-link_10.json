        "text": "The Black Maternal Health Equity Initiative is a student-led organization with the goal of improving the health and wellbeing of Black women by bridging the gap between the healthcare system and social drivers of health through patient advocacy and social support. The program achieves this goal by pairing a high-risk patient who receives prenatal care at HROB with a medical student who will work closely with the patient, social workers, and pregnancy care managers to address their patient’s psychosocial needs throughout their pregnancy. The intersection between the stressors of being a black woman and having a high-risk pregnancy are addressed through a longitudinal relationship built throughout the pregnancy which provides emotional support and connection to community resources. Student liaisons establish continuity of care through weekly check-ins, attending prenatal visits, and with permission, being present at the birth. Patients who participate will be also given a starter kit for their newborns containing newborn essentials such as clothing, diapers, and bottles.\n\nContact: Jennifer Okunbor and Carmen Rauh\n\nSNaHP (Students for a National Health Program) is a student group that works toward healthcare for all. In particular, our purpose is to advocate for a universal, comprehensive, single-payer national health program in the US. As a student group, we focus on educating our student members and the general community about single payer healthcare by holding discussions, social events, and sessions with invited speakers. We also join with our local chapter of Physicians for a National Health Plan (PHNP) and other advocacy organizations in public events or lobbying activities advocating for healthcare for all. SNaHP is the student arm of Physicians for a National Health Program. The Duke chapter of SNaHP was formed in 2017 and has been active since that time. It is interprofessional, welcoming any students from the medical school (such as med students, PA students, PT students, OT students, Population Health) or nursing schools at Duke, as well as pre-professional students from programs such as the Masters in Biomedical Education.\n\nContact: Perri Morgan (faculty advisor) , Devika Shenoy and Aron Mebrahtu\n\nThe Student Coalition for Addiction Recovery (SCAR) is dedicated to education and advocacy around substance use disorders, as well as reducing the impact of addiction on the local community. This group will provide resources for Duke students who are interested in a career in addiction medicine, as well as for anyone interested in learning more about substance use disorders and treatment. We hope the group will facilitate connections between students and clinicians with academic interest and clinical experience in addiction medicine. Additionally, we believe that students benefit from opportunities to learn about the legal ramifications for patients with substance use disorders. Finally, we plan to partner with local community organizations to create volunteer opportunities, such as Naloxone kit assembly and fundraising for syringe exchange programs, and to encourage an interdisciplinary approach to research and best practices in addiction treatment.\n\nContact: Bronwen Foreman, Beau Blass, and Rebecca Shen\n\nWC4BL is a medical student led organization devoted to embodying the responsibility of the institution of medicine to counteract systemic and interpersonal racism and its effects on the practice of medicine and the health of patients. Vision To safeguard the lives and well-being of patients through the elimination of racism. Mission Statement To dismantle racism in medicine and promote the health, well-being, and self-determination of people of color.\n\nContact: Sierra Atwater, Co President, and Camille Robinson, Co President,\n\nThe mission of the Mental Health and Wellness Committee is: “To maintain and promote the many dimensions of wellness - including physical, emotional, social, financial, spiritual - among Duke medical students.”\n\nWe aim to improve the awareness of and access to wellness and mental health support resources for the whole student body. We work with students, faculty, and administration to coordinate school-wide wellness events, gather yearly data on student well-being, and work toward effecting social and curricular changes across all four years of medical school.\n\nAdditionally, we organize numerous large-scale panel events throughout the year, perhaps most notable is our “Imperfection Sessions.\" This longitudinal series revolves around residents and faculty engaging in vulnerable, authentic discussion about their own journeys, challenges, and reckoning with their own imperfections in medicine. Every year since its inception, the members, horizons, and opportunities of the Wellness Committee have grown. We are always looking for future members who are passionate about mental health awareness and finding creative, sustainable data-driven ways to support their fellow students.\n\nDon't forget to follow us on Instagram @dukemedwellness for the latest on wellness at Duke Med!\n\nContact: Julie Thamby, Co-Chair; Linda Li, Co-Chair; Rachel Fenner, Co-Chair; Roshini Srinivasan, Co-Chair\n\n*Not affiliated with Davison Council\n\nThe Durham Medical Orchestra (DMO), affiliated with the Office of the Vice Provost for the Arts of Duke University, was founded in 2010 by volunteer musicians with the mission to unite health-related professionals, Duke University, and the surrounding community through musical performance and collaboration to foster health, wellness, and the cultural enrichment of its audiences and members. Inspired by two similar organizations -the Life Sciences Orchestra at the University of Michigan and the Longwood Symphony Orchestra in Boston- the DMO now has over 100 members: health-related professionals, medical and graduate students of the life sciences, colleagues, and family members who share values of artistry, wellness, passion and community. Their music features major compositions from the classical literature as well as contemporary and newly commissioned works, under the baton of vibrant artistic director and conductor, Dr.Verena Mösenbichler-Bryant. The DMO concerts are uniquely designed as collaborations of musical performance and community engagement. Breaking sown the barrier between the audience and the stage is an important goal for the DMO and its artistic director. The DMO also and partners with other non-profits to help raise community awareness and engagement for organizations with similar missions.\n\nContact information: www.dmomusic.org | personnel@dmomusic.org\n\n*Not affiliated with Davison Council\n\nSCOPES is a student-led initiative committed to integrating the arts and humanities into medical education at Duke University School of Medicine. Over the course of medical education, there are precious few opportunities to explore a patient’s relationship with their disease and encouragement to give life to that relationship through artistic expression. The SCOPES program provides first-year medical students an opportunity to consider the experiences of patients through creative forms and media, such as photography, film, writing, visual arts, music, and more. Students are encouraged to use art as a tool to reflect on and reinterpret their experiences with their patients as well as in all aspects of medical school. As students explore the patient-doctor relationship and are introduced to the practice of medicine, they produce a creative project in the media of their choosing that prompts them to examine the meaning of chronic illness on a deeper level. They are encouraged to work in partnership with their patients to develop a piece that captures the patient’s experience from his or her unique perspective. SCOPES is\n\nin its sixth year. This experience will culminate with a live exhibition on the sixth in August 2022. Check out this past year's virtual exhibition here: https://sites.duke.edu/scopes/.\n\nContact: Lindsay Olson and Isa DeLaura\n\nSome questions about healthcare require a different lens and an economic toolbox of methods to study them. Duke MedEcon was founded to answer common questions about healthcare delivery like What’s the price of this medication for my patient? What options are there for patients struggling to afford treatment? How do providers help patients make difficult decisions about treatment options? We create an environment for medical students to learn about the newest research and healthcare and behavioral economics that aims to improve the delivery of care and patient outcomes. This is accomplished by inviting speakers to share their research at events and through our podcast, the Unbiased Estimator, a show about how we know what we know. Whatever your background, if you are curious about finding answers to pressing healthcare questions, we are excited to have you join us!\n\nContact: Daniel Wang\n\nThe Duke IHI Open School Chapter was founded in January 2009 to build a student organization dedicated to innovating and improving health care delivery and patient safety, both at Duke and beyond. Our approach centers around support for three different populations within Duke Health: Our general IHI membership, the Quality & Innovation Scholars Program (QISP), and Duke Faculty pursuing quality improvement (QI) initiatives. We are part of the larger IHI Open school, a nonprofit dedicated to developing “triple threat” health care professionals with interdisciplinary experience, strong leadership skills, and passion.\n\nHow to participate:\n\nApply for our Quality Improvement Scholars Program (QISP): MD-led hands-on QI research projects (see more info below)\n\nAttend team-building and networking sessions\n\nAttend QI-centered Speaker Events\n\nQISP supports graduate and professional students annually to further engage in QI in a practicum setting. Scholars are matched with mentors and projects based on their background, skills, and interests to ensure optimal collaboration and enrichment. This practicum work culminates in our annual QISP Symposium each spring. Scholars are given the opportunity to present their work to the larger Duke community before participating in a panel discussion led by Duke champions of quality and innovation.\n\nContact: Lindsay Olson , Max Sumner\n\nThe Bioethics Interest Group (BIG) brings together students and speakers to learn about and discuss contemporary bioethical issues. We learn about everything from resource allocation, to gene editing ethics, to the role of physician conscience, and more! Students choose what topics to discuss and take an active role, collectively, in working through these issues with faculty and their peers. Wherever you’re at in your bioethics learning, we welcome everyone!\n\nGetting Involved: In early August, invitations to join the Bioethics Interest Group are sent out (and stay open!). No application is needed to join, and you can join at any time. In late August/early September, the BIG gets together to brainstorm topics that we’re interested in exploring and holds elections for the co-Presidents. Throughout the year, we will convene for lunch to speak with faculty and learn more about bioethics and engage in some of that work ourselves.\n\nSome of the meetings we’ve had include:\n\nMeeting with Dr. John Roberts, a nephrologist at Duke, to discuss use of race in GFR calculations.\n\nMeeting with Dr. Dan Wikler, the first staff bioethicist for the United Nations and professor of bioethics at Harvard, to discuss priority-setting in global COVID vaccine allocation.\n\nMeeting with Dr. Farr Curlin, the bioethics faculty advisor at Duke, to discuss physician conscience and when it is ethical to refuse treatment to patients.\n\nContact: Ryan Kramer , Rachael Putman.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Farr Curlin, MD\n\nGroupMe: https://groupme.com/join_group/62036926/WDGLgoKl\n\nOur mission is to provide an avenue for medical students to explore the business side of medicine, whether they may be interested in pursuing an MBA, are curious how to manage a private practice, or want to gain a better understanding of the economics of the healthcare industry. Through speakers, panels, and interactive events, we hope to explore subjects such as careers in healthcare consulting and management, understanding health insurance and the revenue cycle, exploring device development, and the intersection of medical-business ethics. We are the student group at Duke Med that provides a space to learn about the business aspects of healthcare management, other than pursuing an MBA degree. Our hope is to expose students to material outside of a traditional curriculum such as learning about health insurance reimbursement or understanding the hospital revenue cycle. Overall, BMIG hopes to give Duke Med students an unique opportunity to learn more about the business landscape of medicine. If you are interested in joining, please email max.sumner@duke.edu or tommy.dvergsten@duke to be added to our listserve!\n\nContact: Max Sumner and Tommy Dvergsten\n\nHotspotting is a clinically-oriented, interprofessional program with the medical, PT, and OT schools at Duke that will provide you with robust early experiences in patient care as well as unique opportunities to examine the many social drivers of health affecting local patients in our Durham community. In this program, you will be paired with a fellow student to engage with a local patient, working with them to understand their health goals and address barriers to health. You’ll have the opportunity to maintain weekly contact with them, correspond with their PCP, and function as a member of a team focused on providing care to socially and medically complex patients. Hotspotting has a robust curriculum that focuses on psychosocial dimensions of health, telehealth, strategies for motivational interviewing, the Durham community, patient goal development, and healthcare coaching. These techniques are immensely helpful in preparation for your time on the wards as a second year. We also provide unique opportunities to work on the cutting edge of academic medicine and medical education. In the past year, we have submitted submitted research to conferences, received an AAMC grant, and worked closely with clinician scientists and educators to increase health care access for our most vulnerable populations through telehealth. Most important, Hotspotting offers students the privilege of engaging with Durham - both its past and its present - through the story of an individual who lives here and has been shaped by the realities of racism, poverty, and more.\n\nContact: Phifer Nicholson, and Christine O'Connell\n\nThe Duke Navigators Project (DNP) is a year-long interprofessional program that aims to help health care students gain experience working with seriously ill patients and become more comfortable with discussions about end-of-life care. The program involves PA, MD, nursing, OT and PT students from Duke. We have monthly workshops occurring in the fall and spring covering various topics, including financial toxicity, spirituality, difficult conversations, and advance directives. Workshops will be interactive seminars led both by leaders in their fields and occasional patient panels. The session will end with small-group debriefs (groups include one or more students from each school). Exact dates TBD, but most workshops will be held on weekday evenings from 6-8 pm. In addition to workshops, students will be paired with an oncologist/palliative care mentor and shadow them in clinic to see firsthand how they approach these topics with their patients. Mentors will then help students find a patient to follow and meet with regularly during their appointments for the rest of the year. The goal of these meetings is to utilize the information learned during the workshops and to gain experience with having conversations centered on challenging topics related to goals of care and end-of-life care, hopefully increasing students’ comfort with initiating and navigating these interactions. Students will communicate the valuable information they gather from patients back to their provider mentor. Additionally, students are paired with a student leader who will introduce them to their mentor and help troubleshoot any logistical challenges.\n\nContact: Jennifer Guo and Claire Washabaugh\n\nThe mission of Duke Students Unifying Patient Outreach and Research in Transplant Surgery (SUPORTS) is to promote the overall health and well-being of transplant patients, advocate for equitable organ access, and increase medical student engagement with transplant surgery through mentorship, scholarship, and service.\n\nService: Students will identify transplant patients at high risk for medication non-adherence and work alongside transplant center providers to provide education, resources, and support for these patients both pre- and post-transplant. In addition to counseling patients (virtual or by phone) on the importance of immunosuppression and antiviral medications, students will join patients in pre-operative rehabilitation, meet with them in the PACU ahead of their procedure, join the OR staff for the procedure, and follow the patients in the post-operative stages.\n\nLeadership: Students are responsible in taking ownership of their patient connections and independently will learn patient histories, attend surgery, visit patients in the hospital post-operatively, and round on patients with the transplant team. We are actively planning the leadership transition for the coming year with rising MS2s and MS3s taking on roles for the coming year. Education: So far this year, we have had lectures from DCT faculty including Dr. McElroy (kidney txp), Dr. Hartwig (lung txp), Dr. Barbas (liver txp), and Dr. Jackson (HLA).\n\nResearch: Participate in outcomes research with the Duke Group for Abdominal Transplant Outcomes Research (GATOR). Further Introduction to third year research opportunities in transplant surgery labs. Research talks from MS3s and residents in the transplant labs at Duke.\n\nMentorship: We are fortunate to have support and mentorship by transplant attendings, fellows, and residents through didactic and skills sessions, and participation in transplant operations. We rely on peer-to-peer mentorship between MS1s and MS2- MS4s for teaching patient-centered clinical skills, OR etiquette, and suture techniques.\n\nContact: Sydney Jeffs and Mary Moya Mendez\n\nRoot Causes is a Duke Med student group aimed at addressing social determinants of health for patients in the greater Durham area. Towards this aim, we have a variety of branches geared towards drivers of health such as food insecurity, housing insecurity, exercise availability, and nutrition education. Our largest program, the Fresh Produce Program, packs and delivers bags of fresh produce and distributes them to food-insecure households. Through a diverse student base of Duke students and community members, we serve over 150 patients every week! Other programs such as WellNest provide support for homeless community members or those transitioning from houselessness to being housed, while others such as Healthy Harvest provide a community gardening space. We have other programs focused on education (Project FEED), exercise availability (Healthy Steps), and even research aims! Root Causes also serves as an incubator for students passionate about addressing other SDOHs in the Durham area. We are always looking for new volunteers and excited leaders!\n\nContact: Emily Peairs, and Eleanor Seo\n\nProject FEED is a collaborative program which partners medical students and dietetic interns with community members experiencing food insecurity and chronic illness. Patients are identified from various Duke care sites. Each pair, consisting of a dietetic intern from NCCU and a Duke medical student, meets monthly with their community partner to drop off fresh produce and provide individualized nutrition counseling. Teams also participate in nutrition education sessions once per month that will help guide their dietary advice. Contact: Cyrus Ghaderi and Ella Belina\n\nThe Serenity Garden is located in West End Durham and is open to the public. It is a place to seek relaxation as well as harvest fresh produce to anyone who needs it. With the help of volunteers, we maintain a supply of fresh vegetables, fruits, and flowers planted in our 16 raised beds. We also hold community days which are opportunities for community members to learn about gardening and help with garden maintenance. Contact: Maggie Min, Garden Leader\n\nThe WellNest Housing Support Program is a student-led program at Duke Med, part of Root Causes, that connects students to community members with a history of homelessness. Student-volunteers assist community members with the initial move-in process, source furniture for their homes, provide support in accessing community resources, and develop a longitudinal support plan to best fit each patient’s needs. The program also provides a series of educational sessions on housing and health, including trauma-informed care, home safety, and affordable housing. Through this program, we hope to make a positive impact for neighbors who have experienced housing insecurity as well as provide students an opportunity to engage with our local community in a meaningful way. Contact: Trisha Dalapati, and Skye Tracey\n\nMedicine in Motion strives to bring allied health professionals in the Duke and Durham community together around physical activity, interdisciplinary community building, and philanthropy in order to address healthcare burnout.
