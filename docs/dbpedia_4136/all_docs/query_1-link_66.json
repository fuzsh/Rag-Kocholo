        "text": "I have a Master’s Degree in Teaching English as a Second Language and Graduate Certificate in Higher Education. I am also a Higher Education Academy Fellow (https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/). I have a particular interest in collaborative approaches to teaching and learning and linking theory with real-world practice to equip graduates with the skills they will need in practice. I currently coordinate the four units that make up the Graduate Certificate Health Sciences (Emergency and Disaster Management) . The Graduate Certificate links the theory with the practical, real-life challenges in managing disasters. The course draws on my own experiences as well as those of others who have worked for example, with the International Committee of the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the Australian Defence Forces and Queensland Health. In the course we take a problem-solving approach to look at how we can reduce the population health effects of common hazards such as flooding, bush fires, earthquakes and consider the practical and ethical challenges when working in disasters. Often, natural disaster and conflict overlap to produce complex humanitarian crises, as in the tsunami in conflict-affected Aceh and Sri Lanka in 2004. As such, the course attracts a range of participants from around the world and there is plenty of opportunity to debate issues disaster management and humanitarian leadership with a range of experienced practitioners. Honours, Masters and HDR supervision is also central to my teaching and research agenda and I welcome inquiries from potential student interested in undertaking research related to access to healthcare, social determinants of health and health equity and the protection of health in complex humanitarian emergencies, disasters and the nexus between health, climate change and disasters. All the PhD students and several Masters students whom I have mentored have published articles in peer-reviewed journals. I take person-centred approach in supporting students in the preparation of the theses, while also foregrounding skill development."
