The Academy is designed to develop the knowledge, skills and networks needed by Sea Grant aquaculture staff to be successful in their work supporting the development of the United States aquaculture community.\n\nThroughout the year, participants in the Academy will participate in 80-100 contact hours of interdisciplinary curriculum. This will primarily take place during two, four day workshops in the Northeast (New Hampshire) and Mid-Atlantic (North Carolina) chosen to maximize topic exposure through field trips, activities, guest speakers and more. In addition to the workshop activities and virtual curriculum resources, there will be a strong emphasis on networking with Sea Grant peers and partners to promote short and long-term information exchange across the country.\n\nTime commitment: Participants will commit to attend the two, multi-day in-person workshops and brief, virtual introductory presentations in the months leading up to each workshop.\n\nWorkshop 1: April 8 - 11, 2024 (arrival on April 7, 2024), in the New Hampshire Seacoast area\n\nWorkshop 2: October 22 - 25, 2024 (arrival on October 21, 2024), in North Carolina\n\nWho's eligible? Participants from any Sea Grant program who work on topics related to aquaculture are eligible to apply.\n\nMore info: See our FAQ page for additional details or reach out to Linas.Kenter@unh.edu\n\nSign up for our mailing list to receive periodic updates on the program and announcements when the application period opens each year."
