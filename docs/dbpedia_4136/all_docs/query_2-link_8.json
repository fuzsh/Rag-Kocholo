        "text": "The museum is split into a number of sections including:\n\nChina - Comprising over 10,000 objects from the Zhou dynasty to the Qing dynasty, including 400 items from the Malcolm MacDonald collection. (I am assuming this isn't SuperMac!)\n\nKorea - An impressive collection of over 500 artifacts from the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties, two of Korea's most significant historical periods. This collection includes a range of artifacts such as bronze mirrors and ceramics, many of which feature the intricate and beautiful sanggam decoration that is characteristic of these periods.\n\nIndia - A vast collection of 1,500 objects, which includes an array of artifacts ranging from stone sculptures to Mughal jade and Gandharan sculptures. Additionally, the museum houses a vast photographic archive of over 5,000 images taken by John Marshall, providing visitors with a valuable glimpse into the art and culture of Asia and the Middle East.\n\nJapan - The Japanese collection focuses predominantly on the Edo and Meiji periods of Japanese history, but it also features objects from the Muromachi and Momoyama periods, as well as a significant bronze Buddha head dating back to the Kamakura era.\n\nSouth East Asia - The Oriental Museum's collection primarily comprises two major acquisitions. The first is the Harold MacDonald collection, which features objects that were presented to him during his time as the Commissioner General of South East Asia. The second is the Roberts Collection of Balinese art, which includes a range of exquisite works from Bali\n\nThe Levant and Middle East - This collection contains numerous artifacts that were collected through archaeological excavations, including pieces from Sir Leonard Woolley's excavations at Ur, Kathleen Kenyon's at Jericho, and the Lachish excavation. The centrepiece of the museum's collection, however, is from the Northumberland Collections, which features seals and cuneiform tablets."
