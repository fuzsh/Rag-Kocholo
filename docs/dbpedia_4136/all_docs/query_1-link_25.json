        "text": "Dietrick Dining Center was named in 1968 for Leander Burton Dietrick, a professor and specialist in horticulture, Extension administrative assistant, Extension director, and dean of agriculture from 1923 to 1962. Known for his humorous anecdotes, \"Deet\" Dietrick established several academic departments at Virginia Tech, added Extension specialists in new fields, and worked through Extension to improve the status of Virginia's professional women. Among his many honors were the state Agribusiness Award and Man of the Year in Virginia Agriculture."
