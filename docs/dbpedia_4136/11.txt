• Obelisk of Amenhotep II (1420 BC) Originally erected on the island of Elephantine (Abu) in Aswan, Southern Egypt, this obelisk shows the pharaoh kneeling before the god, Khnum-Re, an ancient deity from pre-dynastic times representing the primaeval waters. The lower inscription gives the name of the king in a cartouche.

This is one of a pair; the other remains in Egypt. This one was presented to Lord Prudhoe by Muhammad Ali Pasha in 1838. It stood in the Lord's London residence, Syon House, for many years.
