        "text": "Liz Harrison’s research background is an asset in the courtroom.\n\nLiz’s fascination with the law was first sparked during her time studying economics at the University of Virginia, where she spent two summers interning for a local plaintiff’s firm. With deep experience in legal research, she comes prepared for cases across a wide array of practice areas.\n\nLiz graduated cum laude from Tulane University Law School, where she was a Dean’s Medal Recipient and earned top honors for her advanced legal research course. During law school, Liz served as a Notes and Comments Editor of the Tulane Law Review and a senior fellow to the Legal Research and Writing Program. Her work has been published in the Tulane Law Review twice. Liz's curiosity for litigation developed during her judicial internships for Judge Madeline Haikala and former Chief Judge Karon Bowdre, both of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.\n\nOutside of the office, you can find Liz cheering on the 'Hoos and Crimson Tide, relaxing with friends and family at Lake Wedowee, and attempting new recipes in the kitchen."
