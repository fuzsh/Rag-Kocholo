P Curtin Co., circa 1900\n\nCOURTESY OF THE DAVID POOR COLLECTION\n\nLocated about four miles northwest of Helena, Fort William Henry Harrison was authorized by an act of Congress in 1892. The Fort was originally named Fort Benjamin Harrison in compliment to the then President. The name was changed in 1906 to eliminate duplication with a fort in Indiana.\n\nThe military reservation was acquired by donations through the efforts of Col. C.A. Broadwater (who owned the nearby Broadwater Hotel and Natatorium), the local Optimist Club, and interested private parties.\n\nThe Fort was built from 1894 to 1896. In 1895, a detachment of the Hospital Corps from Fort Assinboine south of Havre and several small military posts, which were scheduled to close in the Dakotas, began training at the post. The Montana National Guard began utilizing Fort Harrison for training in 1911, after abandoning Fort Ellis near Bozeman.\n\nHelena Independent - Fort Harrison Under Construction, Nov. 11, 1894\n\nCLICK ON IMAGE FOR A BIG VERSION IN A NEW WINDOW\n\nFort Harrison, About 1910\n\nCOURTESY OF THE DAVID POOR COLLECTION  CLICK ON IMAGE FOR A BIG VERSION IN A NEW WINDOW\n\nSoldiers' Quarters\n\nCOURTESY OF JOHN JOHNSON\n\nSoldiers' Quarters, Looking Northwest\n\nCOURTESY OF THE DAVID POOR COLLECTION  CLICK ON IMAGE FOR A BIG VERSION IN A NEW WINDOW\n\nFort Harrison Band Quarters, Bowling Alley and Post Exchange\n\nCOURTESY OF JOHN JOHNSON  CLICK ON IMAGE FOR A BIG VERSION IN A NEW WINDOW\n\nPost Exchange\n\nCOURTESY OF JOHN JOHNSON\n\nRare Token from the Fort Harrison Post Exchange\n\n\"NCO Row\" Housing, Early 1900s\n\nCOURTESY OF THE DAVID POOR COLLECTION  CLICK ON IMAGE FOR A BIG VERSION IN A NEW WINDOW\n\nThese buildings still stand on Middle Road, just northwest of the V.
