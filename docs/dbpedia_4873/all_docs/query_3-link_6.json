For other people with similar names, see Martin Harrison.\n\nAmerican football player\n\nMarvin Darnell Harrison Sr. (born August 25, 1972) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for 13 seasons with the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL), playing much of it with quarterback Peyton Manning. He played college football for the Syracuse Orange and was selected by the Colts in the first round of the 1996 NFL draft.\n\nHarrison earned a Super Bowl ring with the Colts in Super Bowl XLI where they beat the Chicago Bears. An eight-time Pro Bowler and All-Pro member, he held the record for most receptions in a single season (143) until it was broken by Michael Thomas (149) in 2019. Harrison was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016 and is widely considered one of the greatest wide receivers in NFL history.[1]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nHarrison was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended and played high school football at Roman Catholic High School in Philadelphia.[2]\n\nCollege career\n\n[edit]\n\nHarrison attended Syracuse University;[3][4] he was a three-year starter for the football team, playing with quarterback Donovan McNabb in his final year.[5] He was named as a captain for the 1995 season.[6] In a game against West Virginia in the 1995 season, he had a 96-yard touchdown reception from Donovan McNabb.[6] He was the Big East Special Teams Player of the Year in 1995.[6] In the 1996 Gator Bowl, he had seven catches for 173 yards in a 41–0 win over Clemson.[6] Harrison's 1,131 yards were a school record for a single season until Amba Etta-Tawo broke it in 2016.[6] Harrison set a school record with 2,718 career receiving yards, which stood until 2017 when it was broken by Steve Ishmael in the final game of his career.[7] Harrison also returned 42 punts for 542 yards and two touchdowns[8] and ranked second to Rob Moore in school history with 20 receiving touchdowns.

Dixon alleged that Harrison was the gunman who shot at him. On January 6, 2009, Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham confirmed the gun that fired shots at Dixon was the same model as Harrison's gun but said they had been unable to determine who pulled the trigger.[137]\n\nAbraham also said that she was not going to pursue charges in the case due to conflicting witness statements. In fact, within a week of the first shooting, Marvin Harrison was not considered a suspect.[138] Dixon, who had initially given the police a false name and claimed he was robbed by two men when interviewed at the hospital,[139] was then convicted of filing a false report for the incident on January 28, 2009. Dixon was sentenced to six months probation. His attorney reportedly sought a new trial; the conviction violated Dixon's parole in an unrelated case.[140] Harrison was also sued by Robert Nixon, a victim who was caught in the crossfire of the shooting who identified Harrison as the shooter in a statement to the police.[141]\n\nDixon died on July 21, 2009, after he was shot several times while he was in his car outside a building two blocks away from the sports bar.[142] At the hospital after the shooting, detectives questioned Dixon before surgery. He asserted that it stemmed from the Harrison incident a year prior and that Harrison had hired a gunman to shoot him. An informant also made a statement to the effect that the gunman who killed Dixon was Lonnie Harrison, Marvin Harrison's cousin. On June 16, 2010, Shaun Assael of ESPN The Magazine reported that police confiscated a 9mm handgun from Harrison during a routine traffic stop on Wednesday in Philadelphia. They tested the gun to see if it matched three spent 9mm shell casings found inside the truck driven by Dwight Dixon at the scene of an April 2008 shooting. Dixon's claim, he was now deceased, was that the casings came from a second gun which Marvin Harrison fired. Authorities had already matched other bullets to a separate gun which Harrison owns—which he claimed was in his home on the day of the shooting. The police found the gun during a search of Harrison's Escalade. Harrison was stopped as he was driving the wrong way on a one-way street.[143]\n\nHarrison claimed he did not have a gun. But the police believed that they saw Harrison put what appeared to be a weapon in the center console between the two front seats. They concluded that they had probable cause to search the vehicle and they found the gun; however, Harrison was not charged.[144] Another incident occurred in 2014 when Harrison narrowly escaped a Philadelphia shooting.[145]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
