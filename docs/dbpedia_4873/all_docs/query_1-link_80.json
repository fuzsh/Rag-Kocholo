        "text": "Francis Burton Harrison (born Dec. 18, 1873, New York City—died Nov. 21, 1957, Flemington, N.J., U.S.) was the U.S. governor general of the Philippines (1913–21) and later adviser to Philippine presidents.\n\nHarrison was born into a wealthy and prominent family; his father was a successful New York lawyer who had been a private secretary to Jefferson Davis, and his mother was a well-known Virginia-born novelist. After receiving an A.B. from Yale University (1895) and a law degree from New York Law School (1897), he taught law, served in the Spanish–American War, and was elected to Congress as a Democrat, serving from 1903 to 1905 and from 1907 to 1912. The Harrison Narcotics Act (1914), which he espoused, laid the basis for the later Pure Food and Drug Act.\n\nA vigorous anti-imperialist and opponent of “Dollar Diplomacy,” he was appointed by Pres. Woodrow Wilson to ameliorate U.S. governance of the Philippines. In Manila, as governor general, he declared the Democratic Party’s intention to seek independence for the Philippines and locally introduced a number of reforms, that brought more Filipinos into responsible administrative positions and added other elements of self-government.\n\nAfter the Democratic defeat in the United States in 1920, Harrison lived abroad, on an estate in Scotland and at resorts on the Mediterranean. In 1935 he returned to the Philippines to become a “presidential adviser” to the fledgling Philippine government under Pres. Manuel Quezon and served the Philippine government-in-exile in Washington, D.C., during World War II. After the war, he was special adviser to the first three presidents of the independent Republic of the Philippines. In his last years (1950–56), however, he and his sixth wife lived secluded in Spain. On his death he was given a state funeral in Manila and was buried there.\n\nHe wrote Cornerstone of Philippine Independence (1922). Origins of the Philippine Republic: Extracts from the Diaries and Records of Francis Burton Harrison was published in 1974."
