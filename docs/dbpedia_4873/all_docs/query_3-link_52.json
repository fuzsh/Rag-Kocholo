        "text": "Hanging Indents:\n\nAll citations should be double spaced and have a hanging indent in a Reference List.\n\nA \"hanging indent\" means that each subsequent line after the first line of your citation should be indented by 0.5 inches.\n\nHyperlinks:\n\nIt is acceptable for hyperlinks to be blue and underlined (live) or black without underlining.\n\nAll hyperlinks must include https://\n\nDo not put a period after DOIs or hyperlinks.\n\nA print book means it's printed on paper. If you checked the book out of a library or bought it from a bookstore, it's print.\n\nAn eBook is a book you can read entirely online.\n\nNote that most of the time, references are exactly the same for a print copy of a book and an eBook copy of the same book from a library database.\n\nEditions - What to do when a book has an edition\n\nSome books have specific editions listed. Include the edition after the title of the book in the reference list. You do not have to include the edition if it is the first edition. Shorten the word \"edition\" to \"ed.\".\n\nExample:\n\nGasher, M., Skinner, D., & Lorimer, R. (2016). Mass communication in Canada (8th ed.). Oxford University Press.\n\nAuthors/Editors\n\nAn author won't necessarily be a person's name. It may be an organization or company, for example Health Canada. These are called group or corporate authors.\n\nIf a book has no author or editor, begin the citation with the book title, followed by the year of publication in round brackets.\n\nIf an author is also the publisher, put the word \"Author\" where you'd normally put the publisher name. This happens most often with corporate or group authors.\n\nWhen a book has one to twenty authors or editors, all authors' names are cited in the Reference List entry. When a book has twenty-one or more authors or editors, list the first nineteen authors followed by three spaced ellipse points (. . .) , and then the last author's name. Rules are different for in-text citations; please see the examples provided.\n\nTitles\n\nCapitalize the first letter of the first word of the title. If there is a colon (:) in the title, also capitalize the first letter of the first word after the colon.\n\nCapitalize the first letter of proper names in titles, such as names of places or people. Example: Canada\n\nLast Name of First Author, First Initial. Second Initial if Given, & Last Name of Second Author, First Initial. Second Initial if Given. (Year of Publication). Title of book: Subtitle if given. Publisher Name often shortened.\n\nNote:\n\nAuthors' names are separated by commas. Put a comma and an ampersand (&) before the name of the last author cited.\n\nMust include ALL names in the reference list for publications with up to 20 authors.\n\nPlace of publication is not required when using APA 7th edition.\n\nFor library eBooks, the database is not required.\n\nExample\n\nCase, L. P., Daristotle, L., Hayek, M. G., & Raash, M. F. (2011). Canine and feline nutrition: A resource for companion animal professionals. Mosby.\n\nIn-text See chart for in-text rules for 2 or more authors.\n\nAuthor's Last Name, First Initial. Second Initial if Given. (Year of Publication). Title of chapter, article, essay or short story. In Editor's First Initial. Second Initial if Given. Editor's Last Name (Ed.), Title of book (pp. first page number-last page number). Publisher Name often shortened.\n\nNote:\n\nIf you have more than one editor list their name(s) after the first editor listed in the book, giving their initials and last name. Put an ampersand (&) before the last editor's name.\n\nWhen you have one editor the short form (Ed.) is used after the editor's name. If you have more than one editor use (Eds.) instead.\n\nLast Name of First Author, First Initial. Second Initial if Given, & Last Name of Second Author, First Initial. Second Initial if Given. (Year of Publication). Title of book: Subtitle if given. Publisher. URL\n\nNote:\n\nAPA style does not require you to identify the format of an eBook (PDF, Kindle, ePUB). However, be sure to read your assignment guidelines carefully in case your instructor would like you to include this or any other extra information.\n\nMust include ALL names in the reference list for publications with up to 20 authors.\n\nIf no author or creator is provided, start the citation with the title/name of the item you are citing instead. Follow the title/name of the item with the date of publication, and the continue with other citation details.\n\nRemember: an author/creator may be an organization or corporation, for example Health Canada. If you don't have a person's name as the author, but do have the name of an organization or corporation, put that organization/corporation's name as the author.\n\nAnonymous\n\nIf and only if an item is signed as being created by Anonymous, use \"Anonymous\" where you'd normally put the author's name.\n\nIn-Text\n\nWhen you have no author, use a shortened version of the title where you'd normally put the author's name.\n\nIf you're citing something which is part of a bigger work, like an article from a magazine, newspaper, journal, encyclopedia, or chapter/short story from a book, put the shortened title in quotation marks in your in-text citation:\n\nExample, paraphrase: (\"A few words,\" 2014)\n\nIf you're citing an entire work, like a book, website, video, etc., italicize the shortened title in your in-text citation:\n\nExample, paraphrase: (A few words, 2014)\n\nWhen you are citing two different sources that share the same author and year of publication, assign lowercase letters after the year of publication (a, b, c, etc.). Assign these letters according to which title comes first alphabetically. Use these letters in both in-text citations and the Reference list.\n\nExample In-Text:\n\nThis is paraphrased content from the first source by this author (Daristotle, 2015a). \"Now I am quoting from the second source by the same author\" (Daristotle, 2015b, p. 50).\n\nExample Reference List entries:\n\nDaristotle, J. (2015a). Title of book used as first source. Toronto, ON: Fancy Publisher.\n\nDaristotle, J. (2015b). Title of book used as second source. Toronto, ON: Very Fancy Publisher."
