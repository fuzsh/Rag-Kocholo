        "text": "Description:The county seat of Harrison County was laid out and named by a number of Tennessee settlers in 1845. The names Carthage and Bethany were proposed and voted upon, the latter receiving the majority of votes. The Reverend Mr. Allen, who was foremost in the founding of the town, selected the names from the Bible. The town has also been known as Bethpage and Dallas (q.v.). (HIST. HARRISON 1888, p. 341; Eaton p. 171; Conard, Vol. 3, p. 197; MISSOURI GAZ., p. 163; Mrs. J.M. Roberts)Description:This name is a good example of the development from an uncomplimentary name to a more fanciful one. It was first called Dog Town (q.v.), then Snell's Mill (q.v.) and Snellville (q.v.), but when it was surveyed and recorded in 1865 it was named Brooklyn. \"The fact that the village was located on a stream, Big Creek, may have suggested the name Brooklyn.\" (R.H. Dunn; BETHANY REP., Feb. 10, 1915, p. 3; Mar. 31, 1915, p. 5) [1876 Gazetteer \"formed in 1855.\"]Description:In a history of Harrison County the following statement testifies as to the appropriateness of the name Crab Apple. \"The early comers in the southern part of the county who named Crab Apple Creek, gained thereby the first right to a name that might well have been applied to other streams, for the Crab Apple was, and still continues to be quite common in all parts of the county.\" Throughout Northwest Missouri that species of trees is indigenous to the soil. (HIST. OF CALD. & LIV., p. 525; R.H. Dunn; HIST. OF HOLT, p. 44; Inman, p. 5; H.N. Kennedy)Description:The town of Eagle was laid off in 1851. The eagle was frequently seen by the pioneers which may account for the name. Another possible explanation is that it is derived from an inn called \"Eagle House\" which was one of the first buildings in the village. (BETHANY REP., Feb. 10, 1915, p. 3; Mar. 31, 1915, p. 5; Eaton, p. 171; R.H. Dunn; HIST. HARRISON, p. 366)Description:Fairview is an interesting descriptive name, found in three counties. An account of the origin of the name in Harrison County as told by Mr. E.W. Howe, in his STORY OF A COUNTRY TOWN, is as follows: \"On the highest and bleakest point in the county, where the winds were plenty in winter because they were not needed, and scarce in summer for an opposite reason, the meeting-house was built, in a corner of my father's field. This was called Fairview, and so the neighborhood was known.\" In reality, the name describes a locality near Bethany which was made famous by Mr. Howe's popular story. Fairview, Nodaway County, was established about 1875 by John Bilby, who came from Illinois to Missouri, where he bought several thousand acres of land. He was the first postmaster in Fairview. Originally the town site was known as Whig Valley (q.v.). Denver, Worth County, was first given the name Fairview. (Eaton, p. 74; Inman, p. 98; N. Sisson (letter); MISSOURI GAZ., 1883, p. 303; HIST. GENTRY & WORTH, p. 522; PAST & PRESENT, Vol. 1, p. 260)Description:Not only was Grant a popular name for towns and post offices, but it was also a general favorite with the county courts which selected the names for townships. Five counties thus honored General Grant; one county, Harrison, gave the name in 1845, in honor of a prominent family of the county. In May, 1870, Caldwell County Court divided Blythe Township and named the new township Grant. In 1866, Jackson Township, Daviess County, was divided, forming Grant, but four years later the name was changed to Jamesport. In the same year the name was rejected in Daviess County, DeKalb organized a township and named it Grant. In Nodaway County, Washington and White Cloud Townships were reorganized; the new one formed was named in honor of the commander-in-chief of the Union forces. The dates for the organization of the Grant Townships in Nodaway and Holt were not found. (HIST. OF CALD. & LIV., p. 617; SOME PIONEER HIST. ATLAS OF DAV., p. 12; HIST. OF DAV., p. 305; ATLAS OF DE KALB, 1877; R.H. Dunn; ATLAS OF HOLT, 1876, p. 23; HIST. OF NOD., p. 159)Description:All of the counties, with the exception of Gentry, which honored Andrew Jackson by naming townships for him, likewise honored Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States. The dates for the organization of these townships are as follows: Andrew, 1846; Buchanan, 1839; Clinton, 1838; Daviess, 1840; Harrison, about 1845; Nodaway, 1871. (Names File, No. 20; ATLAS OF ANDREW, 1877; HIST. OF BUCH., 1915, p. 39; MORNING HERALD, Aug. 20, 1873, p. 8; HIST. OF CLINT., p. 107; HIST. OF DAV., p. 252; Sam Evans (letter); ATLAS OF DAV., 1876, p. 12; HIST. OF N.W. MISSOURI, Vol. 1, p. 449; R.H. Dunn; PAST & PRESENT, Vol. 1, p. 286)Description:Sugar Creek Township, Harrison County, was named for the stream, and indirectly, because a large number of sugar maple trees grew within its boundaries. The township in Daviess County was organized in 1839 and perhaps derived its name also from the creek, which borders its northeast corner. In 1886 it became known as Lincoln (q.v.). (HIST. HARRISON, p. 98; HIST. DAVIESS, p. 248; ATLAS DAVIESS, 1876, p. 12; HIST. N.W. MISSOURI, vol. 1, p. 449)"
