        "text": "Professor\n\nEconomic Analysis & Policy | Business & Public Policy\n\nRenowned economist and former dean of the Haas School of Business\n\n510-643-2027\n\nCV\n\nAbout\n\nProfessor Ann E. Harrison is a renowned economist and one of the most highly cited scholars on foreign investment and multinational firms. She has dedicated her career to creating inclusive and sustainable policies in development economics, international trade, global labor markets, and now higher education. Harrison served as the the 15th dean of the Haas School of Business where she was the second woman to lead the top-ranked business school.\n\nAt Haas since January 2019, Harrison has prioritized meeting the needs of a diverse, rapidly changing world that is facing the existential threat of climate change. Under her leadership, Haas increased fundraising commitments by 50 percent. Over the last five years, total fundraising exceeded all previous records for the business school. She also significantly expanded faculty size through both generous gifts from alumni and revenue expansion. This allowed her to create a more diverse group of superb faculty and increase female faculty representation by 50 percent. Under Harrison’s leadership, Haas also secured the largest single gift in the school’s history—$30 million from alumnus Warren “Ned” Spieker, BS 66—to transform the number-two ranked undergraduate program into a four-year program.\n\nHarrison also launched the first Flex MBA cohort at any top 10 business school, which lets students take courses remotely with the option to come to campus for electives. Virtual classrooms make the Evening and Weekend MBA—ranked number one nationally by U.S. News & World Report in 2023—available to students who prefer flexible schedules, including students based abroad and working parents. Partnerships with the rest of UC Berkeley allowed Harrison to offer exciting programs with the School of Law, the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Berkeley Engineering, the Graduate School of Journalism, and the Rausser College of Natural Resources (RCNR).\n\nUnder Harrison’s leadership, Haas became one of the first leading business schools to appoint a chief officer for diversity, equity, and inclusion. Her focus on DEI was instrumental in the enrollment of the most diverse full-time MBA class of any top ten business school in the country, with 49 percent of the class representing students of color; and underrepresented minorities accounting for 23 percent of enrolled U.S. students.\n\nIn parallel, Harrison launched two new successful programs for expanding, diversifying, and strengthening access to Haas. The first program, Accelerated Access, allows students to pre-commit to business school while acquiring important work experience to apply to Haas in their senior year of college and gain conditional acceptance. The second program, Cal Advantage, offers a streamlined application process to talented University of California undergraduates.\n\nHarrison brought the same intense focus to sustainability. In addition to an MBA certificate—and a summer minor—in sustainable business, Haas retooled all of its MBA core courses at the end of 2023 to incorporate thinking about climate change and other sustainability challenges throughout various business disciplines.\n\nPitchBook ranked UC Berkeley as the #1 public institution for startups. For Harrison, entrepreneurship and innovation are the growth engines that will fuel a more inclusive and sustainable future—and fostering an entrepreneurial mindset is a critical part of a business school curriculum. In 2022, Haas began construction on its Entrepreneurship Hub, an incubator for faculty and students with exciting ideas across the Berkeley campus.\n\nBerkeley Haas offers six degree programs, all ranked in the top ten. Since Harrison arrived at Haas, the school also introduced a joint MBA and MEng program—which allows students to earn an MS in Engineering and an MBA in two years—as well as a joint biology and business degree for its top-ranked undergraduate program.\n\nHarrison came to Haas from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, where she was the William H. Wurster Professor of Multinational Management and a professor of business economics and public policy. Before joining Wharton in 2012, she was the director of development policy at the World Bank, where she co-managed a team of 300 researchers and staff.\n\nAs director of development policy at the World Bank, Harrison reformed its process for allocating research funds and oversaw the institution’s flagship publications. She convinced the World Bank’s president to release all historical records on project loans, a milestone in increasing its transparency.\n\nHarrison earned her PhD in economics from Princeton University. She also holds a DEUG (diplôme d’études universitaires générales) from the University of Paris. She earned her bachelor’s degree from UC Berkeley with a double major in economics and history. She also served as a professor of Berkeley’s Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics from 2001 to 2011.\n\nExpertise and Research Interests\n\nMultinational Firms\n\nForeign Direct Investment\n\nInternational Trade and Global Strategy\n\nEmerging Markets\n\nIndia\n\nChina\n\nAt Haas since 2019\n\n2019 – present, Professor, Haas School of Business\n\n2019 – 2024, Dean and Bank of America Chair, Haas School of Business\n\n2017 – present, Research Fellow, The Center for Economic and Policy Research\n\n2012 – 2016, Professor of Business Economics and Public Policy, Wharton School of Business\n\n2010 – 2011, Director of Development Policy, The World Bank\n\n2009 – 2010, Trade Team Manager, The World Bank\n\n2007 – 2008, Visiting Professor, The Center for Research in Economics and Statistics (CREST), Paris\n\n2001 – present, Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research\n\n2001, 2007 – 2008, Visiting Professor, University of Paris\n\n2001 – 2011, Professor of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Berkeley\n\n1998 – 2001, Associate Professor of Finance and Economics, Columbia Business School\n\n1994 – 2001, Faculty Research Fellow, National Bureau of Economic Research\n\n1994 – 1998, Assistant Professor of Finance and Economics, Columbia Business School\n\n1991 – 1992, Visiting Faculty, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University\n\n1989 – 1994, Economist, Young Professionals Program, The World Bank\n\n1982 – 1984, Health Economist, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan\n\nAcademic Advisory Council, Peking University, 2018 – present\n\nBoard Member, United Nations WIDER, Helsinki, 2019 – present\n\nPresident, International Atlantic Economic Society, 2017 – 2018\n\nVice President, International Atlantic Economic Society, 2016 – 2017\n\nMember, Committee on Development Policy, United Nations, 2013 – 2018\n\nExpert Group Member, The E15 Initiative, 2014 – present\n\nGraduate School Leadership Council, Princeton University, 2011- 2017\n\nGreen Growth Knowledge Platform Advisory Committee, The World Bank, 2011-present\n\nEditorial Board, The Journal of Economic Literature (current)\n\nEditorial Board, The Journal of Asian Economics (current)\n\nEditorial Board, The World Bank Research Observer (2009 – 2018)\n\nAffiliate, International Growth Centre, London (current)\n\nBoard Member, Association of Princeton Graduate Alumni (2010 – 2013)\n\nMember, Knowledge Advisory Commission, The World Bank (previous)\n\nEditorial Board, The World Bank Economic Review (2010 – 2011)\n\nBoard Member, Global Development Network, New Delhi (previous)\n\nBoard Member, Economic Research Forum (previous)\n\nSteering Committee, Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation, University of California (previous)\n\nCommittee Z on the Economic Status of the Profession, American Association of University Professors (previous)\n\nNational Science Foundation Economics Panel (previous)\n\nAssociate Editor, The Journal of International Economics (previous)\n\nPaul Streeten Lecture, Boston University\n\n2021\n\nSun Yefang Prize (Best Economic Research on China)\n\n2017\n\nWilliam H.

She is also developing a broader range of elective courses and planning to launch a master’s degree in climate solutions. “California is at the heart of climate change with fires, water shortages, and the move to electric vehicles,” she said.\n\nWarnings from history for a new era of industrial policy, The Economist, 1/11/23\n\nThe $52 billion CHIPS Act, aimed at reshoring semiconductor manufacturing, is ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy. In examining the repercussions, The Economist cites research by Ann Harrison and Andrés Rodríguez-Clare which found that “soft” collaborations between government and business can be more effective than “hard” policy interventions that distort market prices.\n\nThe Crystal Ball: B-School Leaders Offer Predictions—And More Than A Dash Of Hope—For 2023, Poets&Quants, 1/3/2023\n\nDean Ann Harrison predicted a surge in demand for expertise in sustainability in 2022, continuing into the new year. “We are seeing this unfold with major policy shifts that set the stage for a surge of action and innovation to combat climate change. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act is the biggest package of climate investments in U.S. history. And at COP27, the UN Conference on Climate Change in November, we saw support for reshaping how some of the world’s biggest financial institutions respond to the devastation of climate-change-driven storms, floods, and droughts around the globe.” Jennifer Chatman, professor and associate dean for academic affairs at the Haas School, emphasized the importance of diversity in 2023, particularly among those who stand at the head of the classroom. “I predict that faculty diversity will increasingly reflect the diversity of the MBA student body, and that cases and course materials will increasingly reflect a diverse set of business leaders.”\n\nBerkeley Haas Dean Ann Harrison on her days as a globetrotting development economist and her new book, Berkeley Haas News, 11/23/2022\n\nTalking leadership 49: Ann Harrison on transforming business education, Times Higher Education, 11/08/2022\n\nWhen she took on the job of Berkeley Haas dean in 2019, Ann Harrison turned her attention to efforts to improve the school’s diversity and sustainability agenda. Business schools must change to stay relevant, Harrison says in this extended profile. Given the top-ranking school’s reputation for creating the next generation of business leaders, she knew she could have real impact. She said she wants to “not just tinker with business education but transform it.”\n\nDo more MBAs mean lower wages?, The Business Journals, 10/07/2022\n\nA study published earlier this year suggests that CEOS with MBAs reduce the wages of their employees. But Professor Ann Harrison, Bank of America Dean of Berkeley Haas, called the findings into question, saying “there’s been this enormous shift towards … an economy that’s replacing low-skilled workers with machines, and companies have struggled. And as they’ve struggled, they’ve made changes to their leadership, which is trying to avoid making things worse. More and more are business-school-trained CEOs.”\n\nInfluential women 2022: Ann Harrison of the Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, San Francisco Business Times, 10/07/2022\n\nProfessor Ann Harrison, Bank of America Dean of Berkeley Haas, was named as one of the “Most Influential Women in Bay Area Business.” She said her biggest accomplishment at the school was leading through the pandemic and the upheaval it caused in business education. And the most valuable advice she’s received? “To be more assertive, speak up and make my voice and viewpoint heard,” she said.\n\nAre MBAs to blame for wage stagnation?, Freaknomics, 10/05/2022\n\nA recent research paper examined higher levels of professional management — such as MBAs — and the connection to wage stagnation. Professor Ann Harrison, Bank of America Dean of Berkeley Haas, took issue with some of the conclusions. “There’s been this enormous shift towards a more global economy, towards an economy that’s replacing low-skilled workers with machines, and companies have struggled,” she said. “And as they’ve struggled, they’ve made changes to their leadership, which is trying to avoid making things worse. More and more are business-school-trained CEOs — that’s happening exactly when globalization is really becoming big. So, I think the focus should be on finding ways to address the losers from globalization and the losers from technological change, rather than focusing on who the CEOs of the companies are.”\n\nSustainability at Haas: Reshaping How Business Schools Teach Sustainability with Dean Ann Harrison and Michele de Nevers, OneHaas Podcast, 10/01/2022\n\nNews From 2022 AIGAC Conference: What Is Top of Mind For Admissions Directors, Beat the GMAT, 05/31/2022\n\nWhy business schools need more women at every level, University World News, 04/09/2022\n\nBerkeley Haas Dean Ann Harrison named to AACSB board, Berkeley Haas News, 02/15/2022\n\nThe Crystal Ball: B-Schools Acknowledge Challenges, Put Positive Shine On 2022, Poets & Quants, 01/03/2022\n\nUC-Berkeley Haas Shakes Up MBA Core Curriculum, Poets & Quants, 08/03/2021\n\nIn honorary lecture, Dean Harrison argues for policies that increase competition, Berkeley Haas News, 03/08/2021\n\nIndustrial policy: If China does it, why can’t we?, Marketplace, 03/01/2021\n\nDo You Need to Get an M.B.A.?, The Wall Street Journal, 01/03/2021\n\nB-Schools (Try To) Predict What 2021 Will Look Like, Poets & Quants, 12/23/2020\n\nStudents return to reimagined courses and major technology upgrades, Berkeley Haas News, 08/06/2020\n\nMessage from Dean Harrison: Condemning racial violence and hate, Berkeley Haas News, 06/01/2020\n\nWhat Business Schools Will Look Like After The Pandemic, Poets & Quants, 04/22/2020\n\nBusiness schools grapple with a high turnover of deans, Financial Times, 03/02/2020\n\nFT Global MBA ranking 2020: analysis, Financial Times, 01/26/2020\n\nBusiness schools work towards a better world, Financial Times, 10/20/2019\n\nDean Harrison signs national diversity & inclusion pledge, Berkeley Haas News, 08/01/2019\n\nChoreographing Haas’ Future: New Dean Ann Harrison outlines her plans to advance Haas, BerkeleyHaas Magazine, 04/08/2019\n\nThe ‘Flight To Quality’ In The MBA Market, Forbes, 02/17/2019\n\nNew Dean: Berkeley Haas ‘Doesn’t Look Like The Rest Of California’, Poets & Quants, 02/09/2019\n\nRunning a b-school in the age of Trump, Bloomberg Business, 12/11/2018\n\nA Berkeley homecoming: Q&A with incoming Dean Ann Harrison, Berkeley Haas News, 11/06/2018\n\nRenowned economist and Berkeley alumna Ann Harrison named new Haas dean, Berkeley Haas News, 08/22/2018"
