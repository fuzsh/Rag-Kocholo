        "text": "Investing in non-traditional real estate with attractive, steady and defensible demand drivers\n\nThe cycle-resilient user demand for Harrison Street’s target real estate sectors are derived from demographic trends: an aging population that continues to grow and live longer; increasing college enrollments; and a more mobile population. Additionally, these highly-fragmented asset classes generally have short-term leases, which the Firm believes can be beneficial in inflationary environments, allowing rents to re-price more frequently.\n\nLong-tenured investor in alternative real estate sectors across the risk-return spectrum\n\nUS Opportunistic Fund Strategy\n\nLaunched in 2006, the opportunistic fund strategy has completed over $33 billion of gross investments (approximately 906 assets) since inception and disposed of 568 properties with a gross cost of over $13 billion. The strategy’s investment focus is to create a diversified portfolio of assets in demographic-driven real estate. The strategy seeks to create value through the acquisition, development, redevelopment and/or repositioning of assets in the target sectors in partnership with strong operating partners.\n\nThe strategy has invested in over 120,000 student housing beds, approximately 30,700 senior housing units, over 12.2 million square feet of medical office space, nearly 5.0 million square feet of life sciences, approximately 600MW of data center capacity, over 6,100 build-to-rent units and over 131,000 storage units. The following provides a summary of funds sponsored under the opportunistic strategy:\n\nUS Core Strategy\n\nLaunched in 2011, Harrison Street’s core strategy was created to provide investment in stabilized, cash-flow producing real estate with demographic-driven demand. The strategy focuses on investments in student housing, both on and off campus, and other education-related real estate investments; senior housing including independent living, assisted living and memory care communities; medical office buildings and other healthcare-related real estate investments; life sciences buildings and storage properties.\n\nSince its inception, the strategy has consistently produced an attractive distribution yield. Assets managed under the core strategy are valued over $16.9 billion and consists of a diversified portfolio of 392 properties."
