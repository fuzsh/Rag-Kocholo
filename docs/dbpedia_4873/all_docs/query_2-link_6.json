        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Harrison\n\nThe patronymic last name Harrison is a popular one that originated in Northern England. Originally from Germany, the name Harrison means ‘house ruler.’ the Medieval English pronunciation of Henry is represented by the phrase “son of Harry.”\n\nHenry, a name that arrived in England via the French during the Norman Conquest, has a pet version called Harry. The words “haim” and “ric,” which in Old German meant “home” and “strength,” respectively, are the roots of the French Henri.\n\nSince the US government started tracking naming trends in 1880, Harrison has been used as a given male name in America. The family name Harrison most likely originated in at least 1841, when William Harrison, the ninth president of the United States, was elected, or maybe in 1811 when he rose to fame as a result of the Battle of Tippecanoe.\n\nHarrison represents a more modern variation of Henry and can easily condense to the delightfully retro name Harry. After the Normans brought this name to England, the name Henry gave rise to several pet names and nicknames, including Harry, Hal, Hann, and Hankin. Another way to spell this name is Harryson, Harrisson, or Harrysson. Early records indicate that some households may have used Harrison and Harris’s surnames interchangeably.\n\nThe popularity of Harrison gradually decreased throughout the 20th century, and in 1977 it nearly disappeared entirely from the charts.\n\nThis name is also popular in the fictional world. In The CW’s Arrowverse series, particularly the television show The Flash, Tom Cavanagh played the fictional character, Harrison Wells. In literature, American author Kurt Vonnegut published his satirical dystopian science-fiction short tale “Harrison Bergeron” in October 1961. The tale, which had first appeared in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, was later collected by the author in 1968 under the title Welcome to the Monkey House.\n\nHow To Pronounce Harrison?\n\n‘Harrison’ In QR Code\n\nNotable People Named Harrison\n\nThis section covers people who have made the name Harrison famous with their contributions in various fields.
