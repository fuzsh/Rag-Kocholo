        "text": "Choosing a topic - where do you begin?\n\nMany students choose a topic that they already know something about and explore new research in that area. Whatever you choose, make sure you are interested in the topic! If you don't have an idea yet, browsing through the library's book collection in biology will present you with a broad variety of subjects. You might also want to scan issues of the magazines Discover, New Scientist, BBC Knowledge, or Science to read about topics in the recent news.\n\nToo big or too little?\n\nA quick way to get a feel for how well your area has been researched is to run a search in Google Scholar. If only 10 hits are returned you'll know you have to expand your topic or change your topic. There just isn't enough information. On the other hand, if you get 10,000 hits you'll know you have to narrow down your topic. Google Scholar also has a link at the top of the results list to limit results by date.\n\nIf a book or article you want is not available, use Interlibrary Loan (ILL). The Library can order books and articles from other libraries. This process takes few days but is completely free for DelVal students, faculty, and staff.\n\nBefore you submit an ILL, check Google Scholar or Summon to see if we have immediate access or if it is freely available online.\n\nResearch articles are also often known as scientific or peer-reviewed articles. If the article is NOT written by the person or group who did the research, it is NOT a peer-reviewed or scientific article. Research articles are important for knowing what new discoveries have been made. This is why it is important to use recent articles, since they will be the first things published on a new scientific development.\n\nHere's a quick overview of how to identify these journal articles:\n\nwritten by the scientist(s) who actually did the research\n\nfollows a specific format\n\nabstract\n\nintroduction\n\nmaterials & methods\n\nresults\n\nconclusions\n\nreferences\n\nassumes reader already knows background information about the topic has been evaluated by experts\n\nTip: Look for a statement about when the article was accepted for publication. Most peer-reviewed articles will include one.\n\nWhen the author's name appears in the sentence, it does not need to be repeated in the citation.\n\nExample:\n\nRecent literature has examined long-run price drifts following initial public offerings and other factors (Ritter 2009).\n\nFisher (2010) reaches more or less the same conclusion.\n\nMore than one author\n\nExample:\n\n(Smith and Johnson 1998)\n\nMore than two authors\n\nExample:\n\n(Smith et al. 2001)\n\nMultiple citations in the same sentence\n\nWhen referencing multiple studies within the same sentence, cite in order by author's last name\n\nExample:\n\n(Dawson J 2006; Mondari 2010)\n\nNo author\n\nUse the first word or first few words of the title. Use only as many words as are needed to distinguish it from other references.\n\nExample:\n\n(Handbook ... 2000)\n\nJournal article\n\nLast name First initial. Year. Article title, sentence style capitalization. Abbreviated journal title. Volume(issue, if available):pages. URL, if no DOI available.\n\nExample:\n\nLawskowski DA. 2002. Physical and chemical proprieties of pyrethroids. Rev Environ Contam Toxiocol. 174:149-170. doi:10.1136/rect.330.7500.1119.\n\nArticle titles are not italicized. However, species names are italicized and capitalized normally.\n\nExample:\n\nIn vitro and in vivo reconstitution of the cadherin-catenin-actin complex from Caenorhabditis elegans.\n\nNOTE: As many more journals only publish online, they often don't have page numbers. They will usually have a article number which sometimes has an \"e\" before it, for example, \"e586839.\" You would use this in place of the page range.\n\nJournal article with multiple authors\n\nWhen there are 2 to 10 authors, list all of them. If there are more than 10 authors, list the first 10 followed by et al.\n\nLast name First initial, Last name First initial, Last name First initial. Year. Article title, sentence style capitalization. Abbreviated journal title. Volume(issue, if available):pages. URL, if no DOI available.\n\nExample:\n\nSmart N, Fang ZY, Marwick TH. 2003. A practical guide to exercise training for heart failure patients. J Card Fail. 9(1):49-58. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12612873.\n\nJones AR Smith KR, Williams AB, Carter F, White RY, Little RT, Kane TR, Larosa J, Mann FD, Swartz MN, et al.\n\nForthcoming articles\n\nLast name First initial, Last name First initial, Last name First initial. Estimated date. Article title, sentence style capitalization. Abbreviated journal title. URL, if no DOI available.\n\nExample:\n\nChinsembu KC, Syakalima M, Semenya SS. Forthcoming 2019 Mar. Ethnomedicinal plants used by traditional healers in the management of HIV/AIDS opportunistic diseases in Lusaka, Zambia. S Afr J Bot. doi:10.1016/j.sajb.2015.05.009.\n\nLast name First initial. Year. Title, sentence style capitalization. Edition, if available. Publisher's location: Publisher's name.\n\nExample:\n\nStahl SM. 2000. Essential psychopharmacology of depression and bipolar disorder. New York (NY): Cambridge University Press.\n\nBook with multiple authors\n\nLast name First initial, Last name First initial. Year. Title, sentence style capitalization. Edition, if available. Publisher's location: Publisher's name.\n\nExample:\n\nSchott J, Priest J. 2002. Leading antenatal classes: a practical guide. 2nd ed. Boston (MA): Books for Midwives.\n\nChapter in edited book\n\nLast name First initial. Year. Chapter title, sentence style capitalization. In: Editor, editors. Book title, sentence style capitalization. Publisher's location: Publisher's name. Pages.\n\nExample:\n\nAnderson RJ. 2001. Acute renal failure. In: Braunwald E, Isselbacher KJ, editors. Harrisonâ€™s principles of international medicine. New York (NY): McGraw-Hill. p. 1149-1155.\n\nChapter in non-edited book\n\nLast name First initial. Year. Book title, sentence style capitalization. Publisher's location: Publisher's name. Chapter title, sentence style capitalization; Pages.\n\nExample:\n\nShakelford RT. 2018. Surgery of the alimentary tract. Philadelphia (PA): W.B. Saunders. Chapter 2, Esophagoscopy; p. 29-40.\n\nCSE recommends placing reference to personal communications such as letters and conversations with the running text, not as formal end references. The nature and the source of the cited information should be identified by an appropriate statement. Place the source information within parentheses, using a term or terms to indicate clearly that the citation is not represented in the reference list.\n\n...and most of these meningiomas proved to be inoperable (2003 letter from RS Grant to me; unreferenced, see \"Notes\") while a few were not.\n\nThe author must provide written permission to the publisher from the cited person (if living) or from the cited organization if it is carried in a document such as an internal memorandum that is not accessible to scholars. The permission should be acknowledged in an \"Acknowledgements\" or a \"Notes\" section that follows the text of an article or is placed at the end of a book's main text; such statements may include additional details such as the reason for the communication.\n\nCSE Manual 29.3.7.15.3 Personal Communications\n\nThe same format applies for reports sponsored by the government as for other sponsors.\n\nLast name First initial. Year. Report title, sentence level capitalization. Edition, if available. Publisher's location: Publisher's name. Report number, if available.\n\nExample:\n\nFeller BA. 1981. Health characteristics of persons with chronic activity limitation, United States, 1979. Hyattsville (MD): National Center for Health Statistics (US). Report No.: VHS-SER-10/137."
