        "text": "When you search Google Scholar, the scientific articles in the databases listed below may be included in your results. Scholar acts as an umbrella search engine for all of them and displays information when the library has access to the journal.\n\nHowever, searching each database individually will give you a better hit rate because of the specialized search \"bells and whistles\" of the individual database.\n\nIf you find that most of the hits you find useful come from a particular database, go to that database to run your search. You'll weed out the citations that don't relate to your topic.\n\nIf a book or article you want is not available, use Interlibrary Loan (ILL). The Library can order books and articles from other libraries. This process takes few days but is completely free for DelVal students, faculty, and staff.\n\nBefore you submit an ILL, check Google Scholar or Summon to see if we have immediate access or if it is freely available online.\n\nThe contents of this page are borrowed in part from Purdue's Online Writing Lab and UNC's Writing Center.\n\nYour abstract should summarize the key points of your research paper by touching briefly on the following elements:\n\nReason for Writing -- Why is the topic important? Why would someone want to read your paper?\n\nProblem -- What issue are you trying to solve? What is your main argument, thesis, or claim?\n\nMethodology -- How did you conduct your research? What types of data and evidence did you include?\n\nResults -- What did you discover?\n\nImplications -- What are your conclusions and suggestions for the future?\n\nReread your finished paper and look specifically for the elements included in this list. Then sit on your paper (or put it away) and write a rough draft of your abstract. Do not simply copy and paste key sentences from your paper, and do not mention any information that you didn't include in your paper! When you're ready to revise your rough draft, check for organization, coherence, and content.\n\nMost informative abstracts are generally 200-300 words and one paragraph in length.\n\nA good abstract...\n\noffers a concise, coherent, and complete summary of your paper in one well-written paragraph\n\nuses an introduction/body/conclusion structure that discusses the parts of your paper (purpose, findings, conclusions, recommendations)\n\ndiscusses the parts of your paper in chronological order\n\nincludes only the information that you address in your paper (no extraneous details)\n\nappeals to a wide audience (even those readers who may not be experts on your topic)\n\nTo view examples of abstracts, do a search in any database, or take a look at the abstracts attached to the studies that you found for your paper! Or click the document below...\n\nWhen the author's name appears in the sentence, it does not need to be repeated in the citation.\n\nExample:\n\nRecent literature has examined long-run price drifts following initial public offerings and other factors (Ritter 2009).\n\nFisher (2010) reaches more or less the same conclusion.\n\nMore than one author\n\nExample:\n\n(Smith and Johnson 1998)\n\nMore than two authors\n\nExample:\n\n(Smith et al. 2001)\n\nMultiple citations in the same sentence\n\nWhen referencing multiple studies within the same sentence, cite in order by author's last name\n\nExample:\n\n(Dawson J 2006; Mondari 2010)\n\nNo author\n\nUse the first word or first few words of the title. Use only as many words as are needed to distinguish it from other references.\n\nExample:\n\n(Handbook ... 2000)\n\nJournal article\n\nLast name First initial. Year. Article title, sentence style capitalization. Abbreviated journal title. Volume(issue, if available):pages. URL, if no DOI available.\n\nExample:\n\nLawskowski DA. 2002. Physical and chemical proprieties of pyrethroids. Rev Environ Contam Toxiocol. 174:149-170. doi:10.1136/rect.330.7500.1119.\n\nArticle titles are not italicized. However, species names are italicized and capitalized normally.\n\nExample:\n\nIn vitro and in vivo reconstitution of the cadherin-catenin-actin complex from Caenorhabditis elegans.\n\nNOTE: As many more journals only publish online, they often don't have page numbers. They will usually have a article number which sometimes has an \"e\" before it, for example, \"e586839.\" You would use this in place of the page range.\n\nJournal article with multiple authors\n\nWhen there are 2 to 10 authors, list all of them. If there are more than 10 authors, list the first 10 followed by et al.\n\nLast name First initial, Last name First initial, Last name First initial. Year.

The nature and the source of the cited information should be identified by an appropriate statement. Place the source information within parentheses, using a term or terms to indicate clearly that the citation is not represented in the reference list.\n\n...and most of these meningiomas proved to be inoperable (2003 letter from RS Grant to me; unreferenced, see \"Notes\") while a few were not.\n\nThe author must provide written permission to the publisher from the cited person (if living) or from the cited organization if it is carried in a document such as an internal memorandum that is not accessible to scholars. The permission should be acknowledged in an \"Acknowledgements\" or a \"Notes\" section that follows the text of an article or is placed at the end of a book's main text; such statements may include additional details such as the reason for the communication.\n\nCSE Manual 29.3.7.15.3 Personal Communications\n\nThe same format applies for reports sponsored by the government as for other sponsors.\n\nLast name First initial. Year. Report title, sentence level capitalization. Edition, if available. Publisher's location: Publisher's name. Report number, if available.\n\nExample:\n\nFeller BA. 1981.

Report No.: VHS-SER-10/137.\n\n20.1. 2 Proprietary Names (Trade Names, Trademarks)\n\nProprietary names are those established by manufacturer and vendors of drugs to represent their own products. Because such names are proper nouns, they must be capitalized. Authors other than manufacturers and inventors are not required to use a superscript symbol indicating trademarking or registration of a proprietary name.\n\nRefWorks is a new way to collect, manage, and organize research.
