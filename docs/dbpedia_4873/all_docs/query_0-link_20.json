        "text": "Harrison P. 7 years old\n\nI would like to be in a world where we the people are all healthy and where the color of your skin does not matter.” I wish the corona virus did not exist anymore and that white police officers would stop killing black people. People should get vaccinated completely and wear masks and hand sanitizer so we can all be healthy. I think Americans should send Corona Virus vaccines to everyone in the world because I think that its right for all the women, men, boys and girls around the world to have it not just Americans. I think protestors should tell the judge that white police officers are not treating black people nicely and the judge should think about that and call President Biden to train the police officers to be good to black people. I also want to go to the Judge to tell him white Police Officers aren’t treating the black people nicely and I think that is very wrong and I think that should be fixed! The President will then agree to train all the Police Officer so they can fix the problem and so since the President is the Boss everyone will listen to him. And if any Police Officer kills a black person they will be fired. My name is Harrison Paulonis and I am seven years old and I live in Brooklyn. I am just a kid in Brooklyn, like Captain America’s quote and Harrison’s quote, and proud of my lovely mom who helps me do my work and helps me log on to zoom when I can’t. On my free time I like to play on my Nintendo switch and go camping with my family and friends. I like to spend time with my family and my favorite foods are chicken cutlets, pizza and rice and beans and also French fries and I love my family and friends."
