        "text": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Adam Harrison, one of three sons of reality TV show “Pawn Stars” celebrity Richard “Rick” Harrison, has died in Las Vegas, a family representative said Saturday. He was 39.\n\nHarrison family spokesperson Laura Herlovich confirmed Adam Harrison died Friday, said his death was from a suspected drug overdose and issued a short statement.\n\n“Our family is extremely saddened by the death of Adam,” the statement said. “We ask for privacy as we grieve his loss.”\n\nThe Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that police were investigating Adam Harrison’s death, which was first reported by celebrity website TMZ. Las Vegas police did not immediately respond Saturday to messages from The Associated Press.\n\nHerlovich said she did not know where Harrison died or the overdose substance.\n\nAdam Harrison was not featured on “Pawn Stars.” The show does feature Harrison’s oldest son, Corey Harrison.\n\nBoth Richard Harrison and Corey Harrison posted short memorial comments on their Instagram accounts.\n\nThe History Channel program started in 2009. It centers on family relationships and business operations of a storefront business on Las Vegas Boulevard."
