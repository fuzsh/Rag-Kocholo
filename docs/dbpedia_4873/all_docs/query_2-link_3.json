        "text": "Harrison Surname Name Meaning, Origin, History, & Etymology\n\nThis is a baptismal or patronymic surname meaning “son of Harry”, a medieval personal (first) name popular throughout Europe and the British Isles. The first name Harry of a medieval form of the personal name Henry or Henri, a French name, and is also used as a diminutive (short form or nickname) of Harold. One source asserts the name means “estate ruler”. The French first name Henri in turn derives from the Old German name Haimric, deriving from the worlds haim (home) and ric (power). The name was introduced from France to England during the Norman Invasion of 1066 AD. The first recorded person bearing this last name was Robert Harriesone, who was documented in the Calendar of Pleas for the City of London in 1355 AD. The name Henry was born by eight English Kings. One source asserts that in England, the name was first established in Lancashire were the family held land and titles.\n\nSpelling Variations\n\nCommon spelling variants or names with similar etymologies include Harryson, Harrisson, Harrieson,\n\nPopularity & Geographic Distribution\n\nThe last name Harrison ranks 128th in popularity in the United Status as of the 2000 Census. The name ranks particularly high in the following seven states: Virginia, Georgia, Maryland, Alabama, South Carolina, Arkansas, and Oklahoma.\n\nThe surname Harrison frequency/commonness ranks as follows in the British Isles: England (42nd), Scotland (150th), Wales (79th), Ireland (505th) and Northern Ireland (183rd). In England, it ranks highest in Westmoreland, Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and Lancashire. In Scotland, the surname Harrison ranks highest in Shetland. In Wales, it ranks highest in Denbighshire. In Ireland, it ranks highest in county Sligo. In Northern Ireland, it county Down.\n\nThe name is also present throughout the remainder English speaking world: Canada (150th), New Zealand (84th), Australia (70th), and South Africa (489th).\n\nThe 1890 book Homes of Family Names by H.B. Guppy, states the following in regard to this surname: “Harris and Harrison. These names, considered together, are distributed over England and Wales. Each, however, has its own area of frequency, Harrison in the north and Harris in the south, whilst they wage a sharp contest for supremacy in the midlands, A line drawn across England through the cities of Lincoln and Chester will define the northern border of the area of Harris. This name is at present most numerous in Monmouthshire and South Wales, in the southern midland counties of Oxford, Northampton, Warwick, and Worcester, and in the west of England, especially in Cornwall and Devon. It is less frequent in the eastern portion of its area, that is to say, from Lincolnshire south to Kent Harrison is most numerous in Westmoreland, Lancashire, Yorkshire, and Lincolnshire. Further south we find it invading in numbers the area of the Harrises and fighting for the supremacy in the midland shires, victorious in some, as in those of Derby and Stafford, waging an equal contest in others, as in the county of Notts, and completely outnumbered in the advance southward into the counties of Warwick and Worcester. Pushing on, however, in greatly diminished numbers, the Harrisons have established outposts on the borders of the English Channel. In this struggle between the Harrises and the Harrisons, it is evident that the former have been worsted. The Harrises, in fact, have been entirely on the defence. Not only have they been unable to make any successful inroads into the northern territory of the Harrisons, but they have not prevented their foes from forcing a way through their ranks and reaching the south coast”.\n\nHarrison Family Tree & Harrison Genealogy\n\nHarrison of Caerhowel\n\nThe Harrison genealogy traces back to Robert John Harrison, Esquire of the 52nd regiment, who in 1779, married Mary, daughter and heiress of John Devereux of Cefngwernfa, and had a son with her named Robert.
