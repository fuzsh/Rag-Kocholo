        "text": "Harrison History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe origins of the name Harrison are with the Anglo-Saxon tribes of Britain. The name is derived from the personal name Henry. The personal name Henry arrived in England after the Norman Conquest of 1066, when William the Conqueror won the Battle of Hastings, killing King Harold, the last Saxon King of England. It is of Germanic origin, and arrived with the wave of immigration that followed King William into England from continental Europe. The surname Harrison is derived from a diminutive form of the name, Harry. The name means \"the son of Henry.\"\n\nOne source has an interesting note: \"This surname is derived from the name of an ancestor. 'the son of Harry,' this being the English attempt at pronouncing the French Henri. Thus Harry is not a nickname, of Henry, but the English representative form. Hence our endless Harrisons, not Henrysons.\" 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Harrison family\n\nThe surname Harrison was first found in Lancashire where they held a family seat from very ancient times, some say well before the Norman Conquest and the arrival of Duke William at Hastings in 1066 A.D.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Harrison family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Harrison research. Another 124 words (9 lines of text) covering the years 1579, 1583, 1590, 1606, 1621, 1640, 1655, 1656, 1660, 1669, 1685, 1713, 1797 and 1890 are included under the topic Early Harrison History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nHarrison Spelling Variations\n\nThe first dictionaries that appeared in the last few hundred years did much to standardize the English language. Before that time, spelling variations in names were a common occurrence. The language was changing, incorporating pieces of other languages, and the spelling of names changed with it. Harrison has been spelled many different ways, including Harrison, Harryson, Harieson and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Harrison family\n\nNotables of this surname at this time include:\n\nSir John Harrison (c. 1590-1669), an English politician who sat in the House of Commons variously between 1640 and 1669, supporter of the Royalist side in the English Civil War\n\nJohn Harrison (1579-1656), a prominent inhabitant of Leeds in Yorkshire, England, in the 16th and 17th century, variously as one of the early woollen cloth merchants, and as a benefactor of the town\n\nSir Richard Harrison (1583-1655), an English politician who sat in the House of Commons variously between 1621 and 1640, supported the Royalist side in the English Civil War\n\nMajor-General Thomas Harrison (1606-1660), an English soldier who sided with Parliament in the English Civil War, found guilty of regicide\n\nHarrison World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Harrison is the 115th most popular surname with an estimated 189,012 people with that name. 2 However, in Canada, the name Harrison is ranked the 154th most popular surname with an estimated 22,265 people with that name. 3 And in Australia, the name Harrison is the 74th popular surname with an estimated 31,663 people with that name. 4 New Zealand ranks Harrison as 87th with 4,323 people. 5 The United Kingdom ranks Harrison as 37th with 93,284 people. 6\n\nMigration of the Harrison family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Harrison family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 80 words (6 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nHarrison migration to the United States +\n\nThousands of English families in this era began to emigrate the New World in search of land and freedom from religious and political persecution.

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 18\n\nHarrison Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nMr. John Harrison, (b. 1589), aged 45, British settler travelling from Gravesend, UK aboard the ship \"Hopewell\" arriving in Barbados on 17th February 1634 7\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Harrison (post 1700) +\n\nGeorge Harrison MBE (1943-2001), English musician, singer, and songwriter, member of the Beatles 1962-1970\n\nPresident Benjamin Harrison (1833-1901), American politician, the 23rd President of the United States\n\nRobert Leslie \"Bobby\" Harrison (1939-2022), English drummer and singer, best known as an early member of the progressive rock band Procol Harum\n\nReginald Frederick \"Reg\" Harrison (1923-2020), English professional footballer who played as a right winger\n\nLeo Harrison (1922-2016), English cricketer who played from 1939 to 1956\n\nReginald 'Rex\" Harrison (1908-1990), English Academy Award and Emmy Award winning actor of stage and screen\n\nSir Reginald Carey \"Rex\" Harrison (1908-1990), award-winning English actor of stage and screen\n\nPauline May Harrison CBE (1926-2024), née Cowan, a British protein crystallographer and professor emeritus at the University of Sheffield\n\nFairfax Harrison (1869-1938), American lawyer and businessman who became a lawyer for the Southern Railway Company in 1896, and by 1906 he was the company's vice-president of finance, President of Southern in 1913\n\nSir David Harrison CBE FREng (1930-2023), British chemist and academic, vice chancellor of the University of Keele from 1979 to 1984, vice chancellor of the University of Exeter from 1984 to 1994\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Vincit qui patitur\n\nMotto Translation: He conquers who endures.\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Harrison +\n\nThe Venturers: The Hampton, Harrison, and Earle Families of Virginia, South Carolina, and Texas by Virginia G.
