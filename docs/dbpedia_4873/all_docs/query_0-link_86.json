He completed postdoctoral training with Dr. Yasmine Belkaid at the National Institutes of Health and joined the faculty of Benaroya Research Institute as an Assistant Member in 2019. He became a faculty member of the UW Molecular and Cellular Biology Graduate Program, and joined the UW Department of Immunology as an Affiliate Assistant Professor in 2020.\n\nCONTACT:\n\noharrison@benaroyaresearch.org\n\nBenaroya Research Institute\n\nCenter for Fundamental Immunology\n\n1201 9th Ave\n\nSeattle, WA 98101\n\nPh: 206-342-6538\n\nRESEARCH AREAS\n\nMucosal Immunology\n\nAdaptive Immunity\n\nCommensal-specific immunity\n\nLAB MEMBERS\n\nHarrison Lab Members\n\nLAB\n\nHarrison Lab and BRI Lab Page\n\nPUBMED\n\nOliver Harrison on PubMed\n\nRESEARCH\n\nThe Harrison Lab studies the mechanisms controlling host-microbe interactions at barrier tissues, primarily the skin and the gut. We perform our research in a multidisciplinary and collaborative manner, combining in vivo cellular and molecular immunology, using genetic mouse models, microbiology, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses, to understand how commensal-specific immunity contributes to tissue homeostasis and repair. A major research interest in the lab is studying the role of commensal-specific T and B cells in the skin and gastrointestinal tract. To do so, we have generated new reagents, commensal-specific T and B cell tetramers, and T cell receptor transgenic mice, to enable us to identify, profile and manipulate commensal-specific immune responses following commensal colonization, and during experimental infection and injury. The goal is to understand how these immune cells promote barrier tissue integrity and repair, and to understand how this goes awry during disease.\n\nPUBLICATIONS"
