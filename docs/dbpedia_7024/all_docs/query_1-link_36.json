        "text": "Indian and European civil society groups call for an immediate halt to the India-EU trade negotiations\n\nIf you or your organisation want to sign this letter, please send your endorsement to: barbara[at]wide-network.org\n\nWe, signatories to this letter, are deeply concerned that the ongoing negotiations for a free trade agreement (FTA) between India and the European Union (EU) will fuel poverty, inequality and environmental destruction, and call for an immediate halt to the disastrous trade talks.\n\nOn 10 December 2010, the EU-India summit will take place in Brussels. It is supposed to give a political push to the negotiations, which are expected to be concluded in early 2011. The time to act is now. So far, negotiators on both sides of the talks have persistently ignored and sidelined analyses and protests by civil society, pointing out the detrimental impacts of the proposed FTA on people’s livelihoods and on the lack of social, ecological or gender- just economic development. Instead, the negotiating agenda generally reflects big business interests and demands.\n\nResearch suggests that just about every aspect of the negotiations, including the liberalisation of trade in goods and services, the extension and strict enforcement of intellectual property rights and the liberalisation of government procurement and investment will destroy people’s livelihoods and undermine their rights. The proposed FTA will also erode government policy space that is essential to manage trade and investment in the interest of pro-development, social and gender-just and environmentally sustainable outcomes.\n\nOur key concerns are:\n\nExtension and enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights through provisions that go beyond what is required under World Trade Organisation agreements. TRIPS+ provisions such as data exclusivity, patent extension, and border protection measures would severely affect India’s ability to provide affordable medicines for the treatment of AIDS, malaria and cancer, not only for Indian patients but worldwide; they would contribute to hunger and malnutrition by denying small scale and subsistence farmers’ rights to seeds and sharing of knowledge. This would undermine people’s basic rights to livelihoods, to food and access to healthcare, education and research.\n\nIncreased market access for European businesses would expose farmers, fisherfolk, street vendors and small businesses to crushing competition and lead to massive job and livelihood losses. In addition, tariff reductions would create a major loss of import duty income for the Indian government, with a potentially higher risk of further cuts in social spending including for education, health and food security.\n\nFurther liberalisation of investment would incapacitate governments, removing policy tools that protect and build domestic industries; that foster domestic value-addition and shield vulnerable sectors of society specifically in times of crisis. For example, Indian street vendors and small shop owners would be pushed out of the market if European supermarket giants are allowed to enter the Indian retail sector. Liberalising foreign direct investment in land, fisheries and other natural resources will deprive millions of people of access to the resources they depend on for their livelihoods. Provisions on investor protection and on investor-to-state dispute settlement would grant corporations the right to challenge the Indian government and the EU over any regulatory measures that diminishes their returns.\n\nFurther liberalisation of financial services would have a detrimental effect on lending to socially disadvantaged sectors like small farmers and small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), and would lead to a dramatic decline in rural credit and services. Financial sector liberalisation would reduce government policy space to respond to financial crises and would further destabilise the financial system.\n\nOpening government procurement markets would undermine the role and scope of the government to advance equity and social justice by boosting domestic production, supporting SMEs and marginalised regions and groups.\n\nSeeking reckless access to raw materials, including a ban on export taxes and other export restrictions, would undermine governments' rights to regulate the use of raw materials and natural resources in favour of their people; it would exacerbate ongoing land displacement struggles and undermine people’s rights for their habitats and produce.\n\nThe lack of transparency, public debate and democratic process surrounding the negotiations and the privileged access granted to business interests must be resolved. Up until now, the trade talks have been conducted behind closed doors, with no negotiating text or position made available to the public. Requests for access to meaningful information by parliamentarians, state governments and civil society in India and the EU have repeatedly been turned down. Instead, business interests have been granted privileged access to policy makers on both sides, allowing them to effectively set the FTA agenda.\n\nBoth the EU’s and India's current corporate-driven, export-oriented trade strategies are fundamentally flawed. These strategies prioritise the interests of global capital and profit maximisation over people’s right and livelihoods.\n\nWE THEREFORE CALL FOR AN IMMEDIATE HALT TO THE FTA NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN INDIA AND THE EU UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DEMANDS ARE FULLY ADDRESSED:\n\nThe deal must not infringe on the policy space and regulatory capacity of governments to shape economic and social policies that serve the most vulnerable of their people and enable governments to intervene in markets for the public interest.\n\nThe deal must desist from accelerating de-regulation of the kind that would increase market concentration while undermining access to essential services and public goods.\n\nNegotiators must end the privileged access of big business to trade policy-making in India and the EU.\n\nNegotiators must ensure transparency, public debate and a democratic process in relation to EU and India trade policy-making. They must release all existing information, including negotiating texts, and conduct broad consultations with the most affected groups in India and Europe such as workers farmers, street vendors, women, dalit, adivasi and people's organisations, including, cooperatives and trade unions.\n\nEnsure pro-development alternatives to corporate–driven FTAs that put sustainable livelihoods, food sovereignty, environmental, social and gender justice at the core. Such alternative approaches support sustainable, fair and peaceful relations between the countries and the regions instead of promoting competitiveness and a race-to-the-bottom in terms of working conditions, standards and wages.\n\nSignatories to this letter (as of 6.12.2010):\n\nAction Aid, Bangalore, India\n\nAction Aid International\n\nAEFJN (African Europe Faith and Justice Network), Belgium\n\nAdivasi Aikya Vedika, Andhra Pradesh, India\n\nAIDS Access Foundation, Thailand\n\nAitec, France\n\nAkriti, Ranchi, India\n\nAll India Drug Action Network, India\n\nAll Orissa Roadside Vendors Association, Bhuvneshwar, India\n\nAlternative Agriculture Network , Thailand\n\nAnthra, India\n\nArbeitsgemeinschaft bäuerliche Landwirtschaft, Germany\n\nArunachal Citizens' rights, Anuracha, India\n\nAsia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD)\n\nAsmita Collective, India\n\nAttac Austria\n\nAttac Denmark\n\nAttac Finland\n\nAttac France\n\nAttac Germany, working group on world trade and WTO, Germany\n\nAttac Liege, Belgium\n\nAttac Spain\n\nAttac Vlaanderen, Belgium\n\n“AUR” – The National Association of Human Resources Specialists, Romania\n\nAware Trust, Tumkur, India\n\nBabaylan DK, the Philippine Women's Network, Denmark\n\nBangladesh Krishok Federation, Bangladesh\n\nBanulacht, Ireland\n\nBharatpur Vyapar Mahasangh, Bharatpurhandigarh Vyapar Mandal, Chandigarh, India\n\nBerliner Entwicklungspolitischer Ratschlag (BER), Germany\n\nBharatiya Krishak Samaj, India\n\nBhartiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal, Delhi, India\n\nBiodiversity and Community Right Action Thailand, (Biothai), Thailand\n\nBLUE 21 (Berlin Working Group on Environment and Development), Germany\n\nBokaro Jila Dukandar Sangh, Bokaro, India\n\nBoth ENDS, the Netherlands\n\nCampaign for Reform of the World Bank (CRBM), Italy\n\nCancer Patient Network, Thailand\n\nCaucasus Development Group, Georgia\n\nCECI (Centre for Education, Counseling and Research), Zagreb, Croatia\n\nCECOEDECON, Jaipur, India\n\nCentre for Peace and Development, Mizoram, India\n\nCentral America Women's Network (CAWN), UK\n\nCentre for Education and Communication (CEC), India\n\nCentre for Health Policy and Innovation, International\n\nCentre for Trade and Development (Centad), India\n\nCentre National de Coopération au Développement (CNCD), Belgium\n\nChandigarh Vyapar Mandal, Chandigarh\n\nChattisgarh Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Raipur, India\n\nChennai Hawker Federation, Chennai, India\n\nChurch Development Service (EED), Germany\n\nColibri e.V., Germany\n\nComhlámh, Dublin, Ireland\n\nComite Oscar Romero de Madrid, Spain\n\nConsumers’ Guidance Society, Vijayawada, India\n\nCorporate Europe Observatory, Brussels, Belgium\n\nCorporate Frauds Watch, Vijayawada, India\n\nCIVIDEP, Bangalore, India\n\nCRTD.A, Lebanon\n\nDAWN (Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era)\n\nDeep Welfare, New Delhi, India\n\nDelhi Hawkers Federation, Delhi, India\n\nDelhi Hawkers Welfare Association, Delhi, India\n\nDelhi Network of Positive People (DNP+), India\n\nDelhi Vegetable Oil Traders Association, Delhi, India\n\nDelhi Vyapar Mahasangh, New Delhi, India\n\nDICE Foundation, Nagaland, India\n\nDiverse Women for Diversity, India\n\nDrug Study Group, Thailand\n\nDrug System Monitoring and Development Program, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand\n\nEcological Alert and Recovery, Thailand\n\nEcologistas en Acción, Madrid, Spain\n\nEco Ruralis Association, Romania\n\nECVC (European Coordination Via Campesina)\n\nEATGs, international\n\nEntally Market Stall Holder Association, Kolkata, India\n\nEnvironmental Study Center, Shivamogga, India\n\nEU-ASEAN FTA Campaign Network\n\nEQUATIONS, India\n\nFair, Italy\n\nFDI Watch India, New Delhi, India\n\nFédération Artisans du Monde -
