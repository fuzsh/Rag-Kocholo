        "text": "At a press conference held on 20th April at the National Museum of Modern Art in Zagreb, the Ties That Bind – Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb and Slovenian Artists Between the Two Wars exhibition was presented. The exhibition is the result of collaboration between the National Museum of Modern Art in Zagreb, the Božidar Jakac Art Museum in Kostanjevica on Krka and the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb.\n\nIn the presence of Minister Counsellor of the Embassy of the Republic of Slovenia in Zagreb, Matjaž Marko, media representatives were addressed by the Director of the National Museum of Modern Art, Branko Franceschi, and the Director of the Božidar Jakac Art Museum, Goran Milovanović. The exhibition was presented by the curators of the exhibition, namely museum consultant at the National Museum of Modern Art and Head of the 1898-1918 Painting Collection, Dajana Vlaisavljević, and art historian and curator at the Božidar Jakac Art Museum in Kostanjevica on Krka, Asta Vrečko, PhD.\n\nThe exhibition is accompanied by a bilingual (Croatian and English) exhibition catalogue. The texts are authored by art historians Asta Vrečko, PhD, museum consultant Dajana Vlaisavljević, Head of the Archives of the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb, Ariana Novina, and retired senior museum consultant at the National Museum of Modern Art in Ljubljana, Breda Ilich Klančnik. The exhibition catalogue was designed by Ana Zubić.\n\nAbout the exhibition: Ties That Bind – Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb and Slovenian Artists Between the Two Wars exhibition is the result of collaboration between the National Museum of Modern Art in Zagreb, the Božidar Jakac Art Museum in Kostanjevica on Krka and the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb.\n\nThe centuries-old contacts between artists from Croatian and Slovenian territories within the same country intensified with the founding of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Zagreb – the region’s cultural and studying hotspot at the time – was also the only city in the newly formed state that had a fine arts academy. Ivan Meštrović, one of the most famous artists of the period, was at the helm of the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb, which could easily compete with similar European education institutions thanks to its quality study programmes. In the interwar period, almost one hundred Slovenian artists studied there, many of whom later left their mark on Slovenian art and culture as painters, sculptors, set designers, art teachers, cultural workers, theorists and, ultimately, as professors at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Ljubljana which was founded in 1945. Lasting friendships were formed, former professors and students became colleagues, former colleagues became collaborators, they became active in different societies and associations, exhibited, were members of committees, and so collaborated in the shaping of pre-war and post-war cultural and artistic life.\n\nCurated by Asta Vrečko, PhD (Božidar Jakac Art Museum) and Dajana Vlaisavljević (National Museum of Modern Art in Zagreb), the exhibition is presenting approximately one hundred paintings, sculptures and graphic art pieces by the most famous Slovenian artists who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb, such as: Gabrijel Stupica, Zoran Mušič, Zoran Didek, France Pavlovec, Marij Pregelj, Maksim Sedej, Miha Maleš, Nikolaj Pirnat, France Gorše, France Mihelič, Zdenko Kalin. Some works were already exhibited in Zagreb in the interwar period and will now be presented to Zagreb’s public again after eighty years. The works of Slovenian artists will be exhibited in parallel with the works of their Croatian colleagues, namely Antun Motika, Oton Postružnik, Marijan Detoni, Frano Šimunović, Slavko Kopač and then professors Ljubo Babić, Vladimir Becić, Ivan Meštrović, Krsto Hegedušić, Marino Tartaglia and others. The exhibition attempts to detect the mutual influences, ties and collaborations between Slovenian and Croatian artists, and to point out some of the widely known key issues that were of particular interest to the artists of both milieus at the time, such as the issue of national artistic expression or socially engaged art.\n\nBesides works of art from the collection of the National Museum of Modern Art in Zagreb and the Božidar Jakac Art Museum, the exhibition is also presenting works from fifteen other public collections from Slovenia and Croatia, from several private collections and the archives of the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb.\n\nArtists: Grga Antunac, Ljubo Babić, Vladimir Becić, Menci Klement Crnčić, Marijan Detoni, Zoran Didek, Marta Ehrlich, Robert Frangeš Mihanović, Oton Gliha, Olaf Globočnik, France Godec, Franjo Golob, Jože Gorjup, France Gorše, Krsto Hegedušić, Karel Jirak, Leo Junek, Zdenko Kalin, Boris Kalin, Maks Kavčič, Dore Klemenčić, Joza Kljaković, Slavko Kopač, Tomislav Krizman, Frano Kršinić, Stane Kumar, Vladimir Lamut, Peter Loboda, Ivo Lozica, Miha Maleš, Ivan Meštrović, France Mihelič, Jerolim Miše, Antun Motika, Omer Mujadžić, Zoran Mušič, Nikolaj Omersa, Lajči Pandur, Vjekoslav Parać, France Pavlovec, Nikolaj Pirnat, Oton Postružnik, Marij Pregelj, Mira Pregelj, Vanja Radauš, Bara Remec, Eduard Salesin, Evgen Sajovic, Maksim Sedej, Frančišek Smerdu, Fran Stiplovšek, Gabrijel Stupica, Gabrijela Spanring, Lojze Šušmelj, Marino Tartaglia, Maksimilijan Vanka, Nande Vidmar, Branko Zinauer, Klavdij Zornik\n\nTranslated by: Ana Janković\n\nThe exhibition Josip Klarica, Light in Silver and Gold – In memoriam was presented at the press conference held on 14 September, at the National Museum of Modern Art. Branko Franceschi, director of the NMMA and author of the exhibition and set-up, presented, in the presence of the artist’s family, this exhibition dedicated to one of the most important Croatian contemporary photographers, who passed away suddenly in March 2020. Art historian and art critic Želimir Koščević, author of an essay in the exhibition catalogue, also spoke about Klarica’s work. The artist’s long-term partner Edda Dubravec expressed her gratitude on behalf of Josip Klarica’s family.\n\nThe presentation of the artist’s oeuvre in the six halls on the first floor of the Vranyczany Palace, conceived by art historian Branko Franceschi, will encompass the period from the 1970s to the more recent works created just before the artist’s death. Around a hundred of the photographs on display are part of the family bequest with only a small number from private collections.\n\nThe general and professional public will have the distinct pleasure to enjoy the recognizable poetic black-and-white depictions of Prague, the city where Klarica studied and spent a period of his life, frames of surreal still lifes and mystical panoramas of Maksimir, his favourite park in the vicinity of which he lived and visited almost every day to observe and photograph it.\n\nThe documentary material such as the photographic equipment and cameras he took photos with, props he used to capture still lifes will accompany the artistic material and acquaint the audience with the context of its creation.\n\nA richly illustrated bilingual catalogue with a foreword by Branko Franceschi, director of the National Museum of Modern Art and an essay by art historian and art critic Želimir Koščević will accompany the exhibition. The program will also include guided tours and workshops for children and adults, conversations with family members, authors and photographers, of course all to the extent that the epidemiological situation will allow.\n\nTranslated by: Robertina Tomić\n\nPhoto: Goran Vranić ©Nacionalni muzej moderne umjetnosti\n\nThe exhibition Ivica Malčić: Zoran Pavelić – Concept of Image: Image of Concept was opened this evening at the National Museum of Modern Art. In the presence of numerous guests, Branko Franceschi, NMMA director and Željko Marciuš, museum consultant and head of the Collection of Painting after 1945, who have jointly conceived and set-up the exhibition, made introductory remarks. Following director Franceschi’s opening remarks, Željko Marciuš talked about the postmodern condition of today’s world in general and of art, in correlation with the visual and textual form of the two artists. The envoy of the Mayor of Zagreb, Mirna Rudan Lisak, PhD, expert associate for museum activities at the City Office for Culture, International Relations and Civil Society, who officially opened the exhibition, emphasised in her speech: This evening’s exhibition delights with a dialogue that takes us in many directions. In fact, it is as if this evening we are celebrating dualism through art, because with this exhibition, the two curators have brought together the two artists so that their works could communicate with each other. Thus, in the best possible way, new relationships and connections are established through art, and it is not surprising that even the exhibition title is a mirror image, inviting us to move from the concept of image towards the image of concept, so that, as an audience, we can establish a final dialogue with the exhibition as a whole. In addition to the displayed artworks, the audience has this evening had the opportunity to observe Zoran Pavelić’s performance “Looking for a Mental Construction for My New Body”.\n\nStarting from the conceptually opposite initial positions – Ivica Malčić from the position of traditional visual art and Zoran Pavelić from post-conceptual art – they meet in the middle with their unorthodox approach to the painting discipline. They both use text and references to key cultural figures and phenomena, thus sublimating the most important dilemmas, issues and ideas that have determined the construct of visual culture at the turn of the millennium, with an emphasis on local themes and contents. Therefore, their parallel presentation at the NMMA provides the audience with a view of fundamental cultural issues: what is art, especially painting, and what should it be today, what is the artist’s position and what is their view of the curator-institution-audience construct that they depend on.\n\nThe exhibition remains on display at the National Museum of Modern Art until 28 August 2022, and is accompanied by a bilingual catalogue in Croatian and English with essays by art historians Branko Franceschi and Željko Marciuš. The catalogue is designed by Ana Zubić.\n\nTranslated by: Robertina Tomić\n\nFoto: Goran Vranić © Nacionalni muzej moderne umjetnosti, Zagreb, 2022.\n\nOn 4 July at 19:00 hr, as part of the accompanying program of the 11th Miroslav Krleža Festival, the National Museum of Modern Art will present the exhibition DIALOGUES - KRSTO HEGEDUŠIĆ / MIROSLAV KRLEŽA. Art historian and NMMA director Branko Franceschi has selected Krsto Hegedušić’s works from the NMMA Collection (Spring, 1930, Hlebine, 1931 and Waiting (Rain), 1963) to be displayed as part of an event written by director and actor Goran Matković, director of the Miroslav Krleža Festival. Dijana Vidušin, Franjo Dijak, Petar Prelog, Goran Matović will speak on this occasion.\n\nOn the exhibition DIALOGUES - KRSTO HEGEDUŠIĆ / MIROSLAV KRLEŽA\n\nThe Miroslav Krleža Festival continues to examine the relationship between contemporary visual artists and the work of Miroslav Krleža, who has, from his very beginnings, had an animated relationship with the visual arts scene and who significantly influenced modern Croatian art, as manifested in a series of oeuvres – from Hegedušić and Augustinčić, through Svečnjak, Radauš, Vaništa and Stančić to Bourek and Marija Ujević-Galetović, Šercar and Kauzlarić. In fact, very few notable painters and sculptors have remained indifferent to Krleža’s work, whether they viewed it as a black spot or a red rag. After the dialogues Krleža – Babić, Krleža – Bućan, Krleža – Vrkljan, Krleža – Vaništa, this year we are staging the exhibition Dialogues – Krsto Hegedušić/Miroslav Krleža. As part of this visual art-theatre program, we intend to set-up the paintings and drawings of this prominent artist in the space of the National Museum of Modern Art, while the actors will read Krleža’s notes on Krsto Hegedušić.\n\nThe Miroslav Krleža Festival program booklet can be found at the following link: Programska_11FMK_07\n\nReproductions: Krsto Hegedušić: Spring, 1930 (detail) oil on canvas, size: 114 cm x 130 cm.

This is the fourth book by the poet, polyglot and advertising expert from Zagreb, whose father is from Dubrovnik, and who has been writing poetry for more than two decades. His fist book Harlequin was published in 1996 for which he has won the best debut award by the Croatian Writers’ Association. Alongside the author, his latest collection of love poetry will be presented by the reviewers Branko Franceschi, art historian and director of the National Museum of Modern Art, and director and screenwriter Hrvoje Hribar. The poetry reading will be performed by theatre director Krešimir Dolenčić and actress Petra Kraljev, and the event will be moderated by journalist Milan Majerović – Stilinović.\n\n… Maro is aware of an entire cluster of meanings around Naïve art, so at the outset the title correctly points us towards the formal simplicity of its lyricism and the focus on the theme of love, which the majority of the audience expects and assumes when it comes to poetry. Naïve art is dedicated to everyday infatuation, both in the urban setting, in the first book, and the small town milieu, in the second. Building on the visual arts vocabulary, the poems are quick and compact, executed in a few strokes like a precise croquis, always with a steady rhythm and specific linguistic images. … Branko Franceschi\n\nAnyone who has ever fallen in love will recognise these thoughts, these emotions, this vulnerability, fragility and surrender. A state of wonder and foolhardiness that can only be caused by love, as well as the experiences of smell, taste and perception that are intensified by this special emotional state. … Gaela Gottwald\n\nThis is a collection of love poems by a man who is mature and does not calculate, who does not engage in playacting, who knows he is head over heels in love, and is completely honest, who has experienced everything and has drawn lessons from it, who stands wounded at times, and forthrightly says I love you I cannot live without you. … Edo Majka\n\nWith almost performative gestures, Maro Pitarević confronts love as a bulwark, or an island, that would protect the Two of Them in the world. Love as a daily occurrence and poetry as a linguistic obstacle are assurances of human durability. … Siniša Labrović\n\nMaro is one of those fanatics for whom verses are like moving, breathing, speaking or crying. He is a repository of verses, and its valve has to be released from time to time to prevent explosion, otherwise his work colleagues would have to call 112 emergency services because the entire marketing agency would collapse from the force of versepressure. … Željko Žutelija\n\nThese poems written in dialect are witty, accurate, clear, and all because the dialect comes from a locality, and this locality is neither urban nor complicated. For example, could “Popevke sam slagal” (“I Composed Songs”) be translated into the language of a contemporary, urban man without pathos? I doubt it. That is why these dialect poems are actually archetypal like Greek tragedy, precise as an electron microscope, visually impressive, so much so I cannot decide which is my favourite. Each could be made into a short film. … Ana Tonković Dolenčić\n\nTranslated by: Robertina Tomić\n\nPhoto: From the National Museum of Modern Art's archives © National Museum of Modern Art, Zagreb, 2022"
