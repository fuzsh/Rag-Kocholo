        "meta_description": "Kalin Ivanov, cellist, is a prominent soloist, recitalist, chamber musician, and recording artist. Compared by the press to Rostropovich, Yo-Yo Ma, Piatigorsky and Jacqueline du Pré he is quickly gaining recognition as an artist whose “dramatic urgency and expressive tone” (The STRAD, New York) is matched by “His deep, emotional, and poetic performing style” (Moscow North). The former music critic of the New York Times, Harris Goldsmith states that”…Ivanov presents himself as a player with a fine grained, luscious tone…” (New York Concert Review). The WORLD PANORAMA (Bulgaria) wrote: “…Kalin Ivanov is a phenomenon in the palette of the most talented musicians” and Musical Opinion (UK) confirmed:  “one of the most celebrated cellists of his generation.” A native of Bulgaria he began studying cello at age of six with his father. Mr. Ivanov holds BM and MM degrees from Academy of Music and Dance Arts, Bulgaria, State Academy of Music, Bulgaria and Conservatory of Music at Brooklyn College, CUNY where he studied cello with Marion Feldman. He has studied and participated in master classes given by distinguished cellists such as: David Soyer, Nathaniel Rosen, Steven Doane, Laurence Lesser, Andre Emelianoff, Anatoli Krastev and others. In 1999 Mr. Ivanov won the C.W. Post Chamber Music Festival Concerto Competition. Ivanov’s young career of charismatic performances led him from the concert halls of Bulgaria to Greece, Austria, Switzerland, France, England, Italy, Russia, Czech Republic, Caribbean Islands, and of course the United States, including recent appearances as soloist with Prague Sinfonietta, Sofia Philharmonic, Sinfonietta Sofia, Varna Philharmonic, Plovdiv Philharmonic, Bulgarian Virtuosi Orchestra, Sliven Symphony,  Pazardjik Symphony, Vidin Philharmonic, Academy Chamber Orchestra, Moscow Chamber Orchestra “Cantus Firmus”, New York Chamber Players Orchestra, Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra, Southern Arizona Symphony, North Shore Symphony, Manhattan Virtuosi Orchestra, and Ensemble Du Monde Orchestra, among others. Mr. Ivanov performed over 20 times at Carnegie Hall, New York (Weill Hall and Stern Auditorium) as soloist, principal cellist and chamber musician. His recordings include broadcasts for WNYC radio, New York, WWFM CLASSICAL Radio, NJ, Voice of America, Voice of Russia, Radio Free Europe, WNYE Radio, New York, WSTA Radio, WVWI AM 1000, CUNY TV, WNYE TV, NTD-TV, New York, Eurocom TV, Bulgarian National Radio and TV. Mr. Ivanov is the subject of one-hour film biography by Bulgarian National TV, broadcast in Bulgaria and internationally and was the featured performer in an Emmy Award-nominated short film “Study with the Best” by CUNY TV. In July 2007 Mr. Ivanov recorded music to the Motion Picture Film: “LUST, CAUTION” (Oscar-winning Director Ang Lee). He has recorded three CDs. The latest one was released on MSR Classics. In the spring of 2003 Mr. Ivanov, along with Natalia Gutman, Alexander Kniazev, Boris Pergamenstikov, Peter Bruns, Tomas Stral, and recent winners of the Tchaikovsky competition, was selected to perform in the International Music Festival in commemoration of Daniel Shafran, sponsored by Moscow State Philharmony and the State Institute of Arts. The Music Life magazine, Moscow called him: “…recognized master of the cello.” Mr. Ivanov currently teaches cello and chamber music at Brooklyn College, CUNY. In the past years he performed and gave master classes at the London Festival of Bulgarian Culture, UK, Festival of the Gulf, ITALY, Spring Music Academy, BULGARIA, International Music Festival, St. Petersburg, RUSSIA, Summit Music Festival, (NY), Portland Conservatory International Music Festival (ME), Rondo Music Festival (VT), Long Island Conservatory International Music Festival, (NY), Youngstown University, (OH) and others. He has also taught at Adelphi University, Conservatory of Music at Brooklyn College, CUNY, Long Island Conservatory, SUNY, Empire State University, SUNY, Brooklyn-Queens Conservatory, Manhattan School of Music Summer Music Camp, Manchester Music Festival and others. He led cello and chamber music master classes and was a judge of international competitions in the US and Europe. Mr. Ivanov is a founding member of The Forte String Quartet, New York Empire Trio and Ivanov-Antimova Duo. He is a recipient of the Chancellor’s Award and Cultural Achievement Award for teaching and performing in the U.S., as well as a career development grant by the Artist Fund of the New York Foundation for the Arts.
