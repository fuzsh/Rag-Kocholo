        "text": "This temporary collection – an exhibition with a published catalog – was opened in March 2016 on the initiative, and based on the research, of art specialist Krasimir Iliev. Iliev is keeper at the Sofia City Art Gallery (SCAG) and curator of the exhibition. The exhibition (and a catalog-book) accompanied by documentaries and discussions represented a large-scale review project dedicated to the relations between art and the socialist state. The collection contains abundant materials about the forms of repression as well as forms of resistance of artists against the state attempts at ideological dictates. The exhibition stimulated the discussion about the specifics of the Bulgarian variant of state socialism as well as about the specific forms of cultural opposition against it in Bulgaria.\n\n\"As a rule, my preferences are oriented to less known or completely unknown artists and more precisely to those who didn't accept the directions of the ideology then and those who are not influenced by the soft aggression now\", says Iliev. His first exhibition at the Sofia City Art Gallery was a retrospective of Ivan Georgiev-Rembrandt. \"My aim was to search for evidence that documents the actions of the system and the resistance of the artists against the deforming intervention of the ideology\", explains Krasimir Iliev. The meaning of the exhibition is also synthesized by the quoted words of Sirak Skitnik: \"Dogmatics is fatal to art\" (1936).\n\nThe exhibition presents key stages in the history of the relations between the socialist state and the artists. It includes documents of the repressions typical for the Stalinist period: such as the death sentence of the President of the Union of Bulgarian Artists, Rayko Aleksiev; documents pertaining the imprisonment of artists and their sending to so-called \"Work Education Centres\", i.e., forced labour camps (Tanev, Shtarkelov, Bozhinov, Dobrinov). Despite the so-called thaw following Stalin's death, repressions continued also in the next period – there were new persecutions of and sentences against artists (Genko Genkov, Asen Nikolov-Shopa, Todor Hadzhinikolov, and others were sent to labor camps); the methods of psychological pressure in order to horrify artists (and to \"buy\" their loyalty as well) became more intense. In the 1960s, some of the artists whose art had been branded as \"decadent\" and \"bourgeois\" were rehabilitated. Their works were allowed to participate in joint exhibitions and were purchased by the National Art Gallery and other galleries in the country. The narrow standards of Socialist Realism were broadened in the 1960s. However, the unpredictability, arbitrariness, and variability of the authorities' assessments remained in place which frightened artists who never knew with certainty, where the regime would draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable artistic expression. In many cases, the formal-style norms of (in)admissibility were used as a pretext of ostracisation of artists who were not loyal enough to the authorities. Manifestations of independence were therefore condemned by a rhetoric of \"stylistic diversion\" (Genova 2016).\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s are defined as a time of more freedom for artistic language. But this is also a time of \"semi-freedom\" during which \"strong self-censorship among most of the artists dominates\" (Iliev 2016). In Bulgaria, there were no forms of collective resistance by artists such as the Zachęta Gallery in Warsaw or the Accumulator Gallery in Poznan; there were no collective exhibitions such as \"New Tendencies\" in Zagreb or \"Confrontations\" in Prague. The forms of resistance and opposition were mainly individual. These practices were manifested differently by the various artists, the most common form of resistance being self-isolation, according to Iliev.\n\nPart of the works shown in the exhibition has been known since the time of their creation; other artwork is shown to the general public for the first time. There are also works from the 1920s and 1930s by famous artists (Ivan Milev, Vladimir Dimitrov-Maystora, Sirak Skitnik, Ivan Nenov, Boris Denev and others), who experienced repression in different phases during the socialist period. The collection-exhibition shows various forms of resistance as well as fates: leaving the country (Hristo Yavashev, Lyubomir Dalchev, Grigor Boyadziev); refusing to participate in the artistic life controlled by the ideological authority (Boris Denev, Ivan Georgiev-Rembrandt, Evgeniya Vodenicharova); self-isolation (Kiril Petrov, Lika Yanko, Galin Malakchiev). Speaking out against the authorities in public and open defense of works rejected by censorship were rarer (Genko Genkov).\n\nThe exhibition contains and presents artwork and materials which are the property of various institutions: Sofia City Art Gallery (SCAG), National Art Gallery (NAG), and numerous city galleries and private collections in Bulgaria. The presented documents pertain to organizations and individuals relevant to the artistic life in the People's Republic of Bulgaria (PRB). They are kept in the Archives State Agency (ASA). Materials from the State Security (DS) are kept at the Committee for Disclosing the Documents and Announcing Affiliation of Bulgarian Citizens to the State Security and the Intelligence Services of the Bulgarian National Army (CDDAABCSSISBNA), in popular parlance: Comdos.\n\nThe author of the exhibition, Krasimir Iliev, managed to provoke a broad discussion: there were articles in newspapers and journals, radio and television programmes as well as public discussions during academic seminars and in the exhibition halls."
