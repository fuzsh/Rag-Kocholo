        "text": "Denmark, recommended by bloggers/reviewers/librarians Zenia Johnsen and Janus Andersen\n\nMount København (Mount Copenhagen), by Kaspar Colling Nielsen, pub. Gyldendal\n\n— Kaspar Colling Nielsen’s debut shows that even people in little countries can think big. The creation of an artificial mountain south of Denmark’s capital city is the starting point for the book — and from that, Colling Nielsen weaves 17 stories that range from science fiction to magical realism and contain both their own stories and a tale of Denmark transformed. The author won the prize for Best Debut in 2010, and Mount Copenhagen has been optioned for a TV series.\n\nMarskens konge, by Alex Uth, pub. People’s Press, jr\n\n— Marskens konge is Uth’s second book and a sequel — but it is one of the very few fantasy sequels that manages to become a book all of its own. The girl, Fanke, returns from the realm of the Quiet People, the fishlike creatures that are a dark fact of life in the marsh. But everyone seems to agree that Fanke should have stayed to become a bride to the King of the marsh. Society comes together against her while dark forces rise from the waters. A tight, original, and atmospheric mix of horror and fantasy.\n\nDe underjordiske, by Thomas Strømsholt, pub. H. Harksen Productions\n\n— After having appeared in several anthologies, fanzines and other places, Thomas Strømsholt finally got a book all to himself — and it is very difficult to compare it to anything else published in Danish in the last century. Thomas Strømsholt writes horror — but in a way that you suspect that he has just returned from dinner with Arthur Machen and M. R. James. De underjordiske contains 19 short stories and is bound to transport you somewhere else entirely.\n\nDrømmetid, by Richard Ipsen, pub. Science Fiction Cirklen\n\n— Longtime fan writer Ipsen has proved his worth as a writer of science fiction years ago with both nerve and style. He may not be the most prolific writer, but stylistically he is often miles ahead of the competition. Drømmetid is mostly science fiction but weaves in into fantasy at times (and sometimes out of it). The string that ties Drømmetid together is Ipsen’s beautiful language and imagery.\n\nDiget, by Teddy Vork, pub. Tellerup\n\n— Vork’s second book and a shorter piece of historical horror. Diget takes place in the western part of Denmark in the Middle Ages, where every seven years a boy would be buried in the dykes to strengthen them against the sea. Knud is one of those boys and — as he is locked in the darkness — the story shifts between his encounters there and his flashbacks to what happened before. The power of Diget comes from its use of old Danish myths and legends and its refusal to tell us what is waiting there in the dark, just outside Knud’s touch.\n\nFinland, recommended by editor/writer Jukka Halme\n\nEn tunne sinua vierelläni (I Don’t Feel You Beside Me), by Tiina Raevaara\n\n— This Runeberg prize winning short story collection plays with various genre conventions. Stylistically strong stories mix surrealism, the fantastical, expressionism, and science fiction into a mycelium-like subconsciousness that verbalizes the silenced.\n\nUnenpäästäjä Florian (Dream Releaser Florian), by Jani Saxell\n\n— Part mystery, part love story, but all magical realism. While Europe is losing its dreams, Florian (a Romanian Roma living in Finland) has the ability to see into other peoples’ dreams — and lead them into those dreams. This near-future thriller also highlights the current plight of European internal refugees and beggars.\n\nKirkkaan selkeää (Bright and Clear), by Maarit Verronen\n\n— Gripping near-future dystopia on environmental disaster and social inequalities, from the POV of a societal drop-out. Sharp, almost clinical writing from Finland’s keenest critic of modern society. Plenty of questions, yet very few answers.\n\nFrance, recommended by writers Gio Clairval and Edward Gauvin\n\nRue Farfadet (Sprite Street), by Raphaël Albert, pub. Editions Mnémos\n\n— Panam (slang for “Paris”), 1880: Humans have known and controlled the Old People for a long time. Sylvo, an Elvish private detective in bowler hat, takes pictures of adulterous spouses and deals with cuckolded husbands and jealous wives. Our hero prefers cafés, maisons closes, and cancan dancers to his lackluster job — until, one day, a duke of Panam hires him to disentangle a diabolical plot. Surprising for a first novel, the tone proves both mischievous and profound, swerving between centaur taxis, steam-bikes, and magic.\n\nPlaguers, by Jeanne A. Debats, pub. L’Atalante\n\n— On near-future Earth, all resources are depleted, and all flora and fauna are destroyed. A few adolescents develop “plagues” — abilities to create water, fire, and extinct species — until the plaguers mature and merge to become gigantic creatures with multiple limbs and manifold powers. Mutant adolescents are parked in reservations from which they can escape only when the “externals” request their abilities. But the plaguers are needed when an untested energy source threatens to destroy the planet. This YA novel captures the reader thanks to the well-penned personalities of the protagonists, teenagers who discover love and sexuality in a tragic and disturbing setting.\n\nDruide (Druid), by Olivier Peru, pub. Éclipse\n\n— 1123: Druids rule the Forest, a domain that conceals dark secrets. Obrigan, investigating a strange massacre, faces a power of the blackest kind, poised to cause a fratricidal war. The protagonist eventually discovers that his life is built on lies. This debut novel is a dark tale rich in suspense and action, where ethically ambiguous characters cross the blurred boundaries between good and evil.\n\nForêts noires, by Romain Verger, pub. Quidam Editeur\n\nRosée de feu, by Xavier Mauméjean, pub. Du Belial\n\n— Both from small presses (the latter a spec-specific press), both involving Japan.\n\nGermany, recommended by writer Jakob Schmidt\n\nSchaumschwester, by Thor Kunkel, pub. Matthes & Seitz Berlin\n\n— Kunkel’s novel is based on the notion that in the near future, humanity is threatened by extinction because people have begun to prefer advanced sex puppets to human partners. To be honest, I dislike the philosophy put forth in this book so much that I did not finish reading it. But I can appreciate that it is among the most relevant German SF novels of 2010. Therefore, with kind permission, I’m borrowing Frank Böhmert’s words of praise: “Kunkel is taking us on a tour-de-force through the cultural history of the puppet, always keeping a close eye on his protagonists. His love of the crime pulps and William S. Burroughs is obvious. (…) Finally, a German SF novel that reminds the reader of the great iconoclastic tradition of British SF from the 60s and 70s.”\n\nWenn das der Führer wüsste, by Otto Basil, pub. Pabel-Moewig Verlag Kg\n\n— This alternate history novel about a victorious Nazi Germany was first published in 1966, but has been out of print most years since. In 2010, Austrian publisher Milena finally reissued the book, which represents a fundamentally different take on the well-worn topic. Wenn das der Führer wüsste shows the absurdity of Nazi ideology by further exaggerating all its contradictory elements and letting them clash: it is a surrealistic road trip, with a despicable and pathetic Nazi protagonist wandering through a German Reich that is rapidly falling to pieces after Hitler’s death, until finally Germany engages the Japanese in a third world war. An English translation of Basil’s novel has been published in 1968 under the title The Twilight Men.\n\nHinterland, Karla Schmidt (ed.), pub. Wurdack\n\n— This anthology collects 20 SF/slipstream short stories by a broad range of authors, among them well-known mainstream writers like Dietmar Dath, newcomers like Dirk Röse and Jasper Nicolaisen, and writers who are well-known in their community like Heidrun Jänchen, Karsten Kruschel, and Nadine Boos. The common element is that each of the 20 stories is inspired by a song by David Bowie. What makes this anthology special is not only the high overall quality of the stories, but also that it ventures further out into slipstream territory than anything published by a German SF small press in the last few years. Standout stories are Markolf Hoffmann’s disturbing Triptychon about a future society where murder is not a crime if the deed is considered to be of artistic value, Pepe Metropolis’ Lovecraftian steampunk-story Hinterland, and Erlösungsdeadline by editor Karla Schmidt, a restrained but powerful piece of social fiction.\n\nEnde der Nacht, by Ralph Doege, pub. Deltus Media\n\n— Doege’s short fiction has been published in various SF magazines and anthologies over the past few years. Ende der Nacht (End of Night) is his first collection. Most of Doege’s stories feature fantasy and/or SF elements, but the focus is always on psychological dilemmas. This in itself is pretty unusual for German science fiction and fantasy, and Doege takes it a step further by repeatedly confronting his characters with virtually unsolvable philosophical problems. Standout stories are Karmamaschine, about a machine that determines if someone is bound to become a criminal one day, Wunden, a frightening and sexual werewolf fantasy, and Im Sog, which contains no fantasy elements, but presents a haunting metaphor for the erosion of childhood memories. While Doege’s stories have a tendency to be flawed in one way or the other and are sometimes stylistically overwrought, he is a truly unique and highly recommended voice in German speculative fiction.\n\nIsrael, recommended by publisher/editor Rani Graff and writer Lavie Tidhar\n\nNuntia (Frost), by Shimon Adaf, pub. Zmora Bitan Publishing\n\n— Set 500 years in the future, the Tel Aviv depicted in this novel is a very different place from the vibrant seaside city we know today. In fact, it might be a different city altogether. Strange genetic alterations are discovered in the bodies of some yeshiva students, and a Torah scholar, who might be a scientific genius, is called to solve the mystery. This fantastic futuristic thriller walks on the border of Science Fiction and Fantasy. It is a demanding, not easy, read — but a very rewarding one.\n\nSequoia Children, by Gon Ben-Ari, pub. Zmora Bitan Publishing\n\n— Nikolina is a sequoia child, which means that when she was born she received, like all other sequoia children, a revolutionary injection that will prolong her life to a thousand years. She is 16 years old and her grandfather, the last holocaust survivor, is about to pass away — but before he does, he leaves her a coded letter that she must solve. But to Nikolina the whole world is one giant code that awaits a solution. Sequoia Children examines myths at large and tells a new one while doing so. This one of the most fascinating novels published in Israel in 2010.\n\nThe Day the Music Died, by Ofir Touche Gafla, pub. Keter Publishing\n\n— This modern tale is set in the imaginary town of Innoville, which was an ordinary town until June 26th, 1984. That day a mysterious boy came to town and wrote in a group of files the exact date of each resident’s death. Once a resident of Innoville turned 18, he or she was allowed to open the file. From that day on, Innoville became known to everyone as the town where people know when they will die. A few years after the mysterious visit, on her 18th birthday, Dora Matter opens her file — and her life, plans, and everything else becomes overshadowed by the grim news. But, unlike other people, she refuses to let her knowledge change her life, and she seems to be the only one in town who acts that way. In her unique voice, Dora tells a moving and intimate story of growing up and self discovery. Unlike its dire topic, The Day the Music Died is a funny, entertaining story that celebrates life rather than death.\n\nJapan, recommended by translator/publisher/editor Yoshio Kobayashi\n\nFirst of all, thank you for your concern over our recent tragedy, but most of us in Japanese speculative fiction community are alive and well. Although our publishing industry is based on paper books and is suffering very badly in many aspects — from editing to distributing to the bookstore shelves — our major concerns are the economy itself. Many readers likely won’t be able afford to buy books for quite a while. Yet for some people, book reading is still cheap and convenient pleasure under the controlled blackout situation, so we have to keep on.\n\nLast year, 2010, was regarded as a bad year for our SF community as well. We lost major figures in translation. Takumi SHIBANO, the founding father of SF community in Japan passed away in January. Hisashi ASAKURA (nee Zenji OTANI), one of our best translators followed in February. Both of them helped shape our idea of SF and had great influence over our writers, including Haruki MURAKAMI. Death took a heavy toll again following 2009 when Kaoru KURIMOTO and Project ITOH died in the middle of their growing popularity.\n\nYet, I read a decent share of good novels and my favorite three of 2010 were:\n\nPistils,by Kazushige ABE\n\n— The Tohoku area, ravaged by the recent earthquakes and tsunami, is the home of an excellent novelist. You might call Tohoku the Japanese south because, although it stands in the northern part of Honshu island, it was defeated in our civil war in the early 19th century. Since then has become a neglected and underdeveloped agricultural outland, rich with legends and myths. Kazushige ABE hails from this part of Japan and is regarded as one of the most ambitious novelists of mainstream literature today — especially after winning Akutagawa prize, equivalent of National Book Award for first fiction. The novel describes the rise and fall of Findhorn — a hippie-like commune in rural Tohoku village where a family with Psi power has been secretly residing for a millennium. It’s kind of a Magic realism novel with a small scale hippie dream (our heroine literally uses flower power by tapping into their aroma) and is reminiscent of The Children of Atom by William H Shiras.\n\nKoroyoshi! (Commence!), by Aki MISAKI\n\n— Mainstream writers in Japan have begun to employ fantastic elements more and more in their stories, and the most eminent young writer is Aki MISAKI. In his recent Koroyoshi!, he dovetails into another big trend: sports fiction. In an alternate Japan, people of the defeated Western Regions camouflage their martial arts and simultaneously keep them alive by creating the sport of brooming. In this sport, a player swings a broom-like stick to sweep confetti into the air and gather it swiftly and beautifully into a pile, while dancing. This book reminds me of another hippie-flavored SF novel from the 80s, The Gameplayers of Zan by M. A. Foster. Sports fiction tends to be a coming of age story, but this one is also an alternate history novel without describing the world. It’s a refreshing way to write an alternate history novel. I’ve been one of Aki MISAKI’s most devoted readers, but think this is his best so far.\n\nThe Ocean Chronicles (Karyu no Miya), by Sayuri UEDA\n\n— I’m happy to introduce you a genuine genre novel by a very young author, Sayuri UEDA. Due to the plume tectonics collapse (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plume_tectonics), most of the land masses of the world have sunk beneath the ocean. There is a big conflict between the ocean people — who genetically modify themselves to live in the ocean — and the land people — who control the power and resources in the former highlands. The major theme is ecology, but it is also about one renegade diplomat’s struggle to save mankind from the next tectonic collapse. The novel reminds me of Frank Herbert and Roger Zelazny, rather than Hilbert Schenk. It’s also a bit like Stations of the Tide by Michael Swanwick, because the author uses telepresence AI technology.\n\nYoreiden (Tale of Yan Ling),by Kenzo KITAKATA\n\n— A fifteen volume alternate history saga, a sequel to the author’s Suikoden (Water Margin), was completed in 2010. This is the tale of rebels who build an independent state in 12th century China, using international trade as their primary weapon.\n\nFukkatsu no Chi (The Land of Restoration),by Issui Ogawa (2004)\n\n— Though it is not a 2010 novel, I recommend this book for those who might be interested in how Japanese speculative fiction treats a massive earthquake and the restoration afterward. The author describes a scene like today’s Japan, where ordinary people perform heroic deeds to revitalize a ravaged planet.\n\nPhilippines, recommended by writer/blogger Charles Tan\n\nNeil Gaiman Presents The Philippine Graphic/Fiction Awards: Prose Anthology, pub. Sketchbooks Inc.\n\n— This anthology compiles all the winning prose entries of the previous three competitions in the Neil Gaiman-sponsored Philippine Graphic/Fiction Awards. There are over 20 stories, including both veteran and new voices, from the likes of Michael A.R. Co, Ian Casocot, Yvette Natalie Tan, Joseph Frederic Nacino, and Dean Francis Alfar. Covers fantasy, science fiction, and horror."
