The Prater Gallery has invited artists to explore the challenges of a digital exhibition space, and to try out their own work in the Prater Digital rooms. Taking their own artistic works as a basis, the artists have discovered different ways of approaching the digital gallery space.\n\nThe exhibition title POST NORMAL is borrowed from the work by Sharon Paz. It refers to the concept of ‘postnormal times’ (PNT) developed by Ziauddin Sardar. In 2010, Sardar described the present day as an interim phase during which old orthodoxies would die out while new ones were still to be born – a phase during which very little would appear to make sense. The digital space permits the playful abolition of the boundaries imposed in physical space. After all, who can make objects float in mid-air in the physical space, as Juliane Tübke does in her piece? Or deconstruct architecture entirely, like Michelle-Marie Letelier in her work, in which the digital gallery space is continually and increasingly disrupted? Starting from our bodily experiences and the limitations imposed in the physical space, we must still learn to move anew in the digital space. As a municipal gallery, we are investigating ways to operate in the digital space. It is with the aim of exploring this together with artists and the public that we have set up the digital residencies whose results we present in this exhibition."
