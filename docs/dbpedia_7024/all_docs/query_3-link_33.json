        "text": "Research on the etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical course of depression can contribute to the development of new treatments and the refinement of existing treatments. Importantly, because variability exists in both response to empirically supported treatments for depression and in affect-related brain function among people with depression, there is the potential to determine whether individual differences in affect-related brain function are associated with response to treatment. Thus, research on the neural substrates of depression can possibly reduce the heterogeneity of treatment response and contribute to the goal of improving outcomes by personalizing treatment.\n\nBecause depression is considered to be a disorder of affect regulation (Forbes & Dahl, 2005; Gross & Muñoz, 1995), neural response to affective stimuli could indicate alterations in many processes relevant to treatment response, including subjective experience of affect-eliciting events, ability to engage interpersonally in psychosocial treatment, and functioning of neural circuits potentially influenced by psychosocial or pharmacologic treatments. Studies have begun to address affect-related brain function as a predictor of treatment response, with stimuli including sad faces (Costafreda, Khanna, Mourao-Miranda, & Fu, 2009; Fu et al., 2008); fearful faces (Salvadore et al., 2009); happy faces (Fu et al., 2007); positive and negative affective words (Siegle, Carter, & Thase, 2006); and positive and negative affective faces (Sheline et al., 2001; Whalen et al., 2008). These studies have addressed improvement with cognitive behavioral therapy (e.g., Fu et al., 2008) and pharmacotherapy (e.g., Salvadore et al., 2009), focusing on both depression (e.g., Siegle et al., 2006) and anxiety disorders (e.g., Whalen et al., 2008).\n\nAdolescence is a particularly important point in the lifespan for understanding the implications of brain function for treatment response, since intervention early in the clinical course of depression—and during brain development—could be especially helpful to preventing future episodes. Adolescence is a time of great increase in the incidence of depression (Angold, 1988; Lewinsohn, Clarke, Seeley, & Rohde, 1994), and many adults with depression experienced their first episode during adolescence (Lewinsohn, Rohde, Klein, & Seeley, 1999; Weissman et al., 1999).\n\nReward-related brain function could be a particularly fruitful target for investigating affect-related brain function as a predictor of treatment response in adolescent depression. Reduced reward-related striatal function has been observed in adolescents and adults with depression (Epstein et al., 2006; Forbes, Hariri et al., 2009; Keedwell, Andrew, Williams, Brammer, & Phillips, 2005; Surguladze et al., 2005), and it is postulated to be associated with affective and motivational features of the disorder (Davey, Yucel, & Allen, 2008; Forbes & Dahl, 2005). The association of reward-related brain function with treatment response remains to be examined, as the most relevant study of affect-related brain function as a predictor of treatment response in adolescents focused on threat-related brain function and anxiety disorders (McClure et al., 2007).\n\nTo date, three lines of evidence suggest that functioning in reward-related brain areas could be important to treatment response in adolescents with depression. First, research on psychosocial treatment suggests that improvement of positive affect—a larger construct that includes reward processing—is part of response to treatment in adult depression. Specifically, cognitive behavioral therapy is associated with increased level of positive affect in adults whose depression improves significantly (Kring, Persons, & Thomas, 2007). Second, in adults with depression, amphetamine challenge, which exerts its effects through dopamine release in the ventral striatum, elicits greater subjective sensitivity to the rewarding effects of amphetamine and unusual striatal functioning (Tremblay et al., 2005). This finding suggests that striatal functioning is reduced in depression and reflects the emerging consensus that functioning of the dopamine system—which is critical to reward processing—contributes to the pathophysiology of depression (Dunlop & Nemeroff, 2007). Third, stimulation of reward-related areas in the brain can elicit improvement in adults with recurrent depression. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the ventral striatum has been demonstrated as an effective treatment in adults with severe, recurrent depression (Schlaepfer et al., 2008).\n\nOne possible explanation for these results is that individual differences in reward-related striatal function at baseline can indicate which depressed patients have the flexibility in the function of reward-related neural systems to respond to treatment. This hypothesis is consistent with a phenomenological finding in adolescent depression: a relatively higher level of subjective positive mood in natural environments in adolescents who are currently in a depressive episode is associated with lower likelihood of recurrence (Silk et al., under review). This finding suggests that higher positive affect can be protective (for example, by facilitating hope despite depression) or possibly promote improvement.\n\nAlthough often neglected, comorbidity with anxiety is worthy of attention in research on the neural predictors of treatment response in depression. Anxiety disorders are common in young people with depression, and the two types of disorders have shared familial risk and common genetic liability (Williamson, Forbes, Dahl, & Ryan, 2005). Anxiety and depression each appear to have distinctive features, but there is considerable overlap between them (Olino, Klein, Lewinsohn, Rohde, & Seeley, 2008). Little conceptual attention has been paid to associations between anxiety and reward processing, but recent evidence suggests that—contrary to the pattern of findings in depression—anxiety traits and disorders in adolescents involve enhanced reward-related functioning in the striatum (Bar-Haim et al., 2009; Guyer et al., 2006) and orbitofrontal cortex (Forbes et al., 2006). For adolescents with comorbid depression and anxiety, it is difficult to predict whether reward would elicit more or less reactivity in reward-relevant areas such as the striatum, since depression is associated with decreased reactivity and anxiety with increased reactivity. One possibility is that adolescents with depression and comorbid anxiety do not exhibit the decreased reward-related reactivity that adolescents with “pure” depression exhibit.\n\nAdditionally, a key methodological issue in examining neural predictors of treatment response is the operationalization of treatment response. Typically, treatment response has been measured by change in symptom level from pre- to post-treatment (e.g., Siegle et al., 2006) or by ratings of improvement post-treatment (e.g., McClure et al., 2007), rather than by change in severity or symptoms before, during, and after treatment. Psychopathology researchers emphasize that treatment response is best measured across multiple time points (Willett, 1997), however. As a result, methods such as growth curve modeling, which allow the examination of improvement over time, have become more widely used in treatment-outcome research (Lutz, Martinovich, & Howard, 1999). It is also valuable to take a multi-measure approach that includes several aspects of clinical state and assesses response from several perspectives. Clinical factors worth considering are both those that are global—that is, related to general functioning or behavior across several domains—and those that are specific—that is, relevant to the symptoms and signs of the disorder. Perspectives worth considering are those of the clinicians assessing or treating participants and, of course, those of the participants themselves (Spielmans & McFall, 2006).\n\nThe current study examined reward-related brain function in relation to change in self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms and clinician-reported clinical features in adolescents with major depressive disorder, most of whom had comorbid generalized anxiety disorder. Based on the growing literature on altered reward-related striatal function in depression, we predicted that greater striatal reactivity at baseline would predict both lower levels of symptoms and severity at the end of treatment (intercept) and faster decrease in symptoms and severity during treatment (slope). This prediction was somewhat tentative, however, because of the presence of comorbid anxiety disorders in the sample and reports of decreased striatal reactivity in the small literature on reward functioning in anxiety. Because both depression and anxiety have been associated with altered striatal functioning, and because we employed a functional MRI task that reliably elicits striatal reactivity (Delgado, Nystrom, Fissell, Noll, & Fiez, 2000; Forbes, Hariri et al., 2009), we focused on this region as relevant to our research question.\n\nIn addition, we examined reward-related reactivity of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as a predictor of treatment response. Although we did not have strong hypotheses about the association of mPFC reactivity and treatment response, three findings led us to investigate whether low reactivity in this region would predict better response to treatment. First, we have reported previously that adolescents with depression have greater mPFC reactivity to reward than do comparison adolescents (Forbes, Hariri et al., 2009). Second, findings on affect-related brain function as a predictor of treatment response in depression have indicated that higher medial prefrontal function to sad stimuli before treatment is related to non-remission with CBT (Costafreda et al., 2009). Third, research on default-mode network functioning indicates that adult depression is associated with less disengagement of the default mode network during affective processing (Sheline et al., 2009). The medial PFC is included in the default-mode network—a set of brain regions in which activity is high during a resting or self-referential state but decreases during cognitive engagement (Raichle & Snyder, 2007)—and has been implicated in depression-related alterations in the functioning of this network. Given this support for higher mPFC reactivity in depression and in poor response to treatment, we predicted that greater mPFC reactivity before treatment would be associated with higher levels of severity and symptoms after treatment (intercept) and slower decrease in symptoms and severity across treatment (slope).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe current study is the first to examine reward-related brain function as a predictor of treatment response in adolescent depression. In a sample of young people with major depressive disorder and high degree of anxiety disorder comorbidity, growth curve models indicated that participants improved over time: During treatment, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and severity decreased (albeit at a trend level for depressive symptoms), and clinician-rated improvement increased. Greater reward-related striatal function before treatment was associated with higher overall clinical severity at the end of treatment, lower anxiety symptoms at the end of treatment, and faster improvement in anxiety symptoms. Greater reward-related medial PFC function before treatment was related to slower improvement in anxiety symptoms. Reward-related brain function predicted final overall severity level, final anxiety symptom level, and rate of improvement of anxiety symptoms. This study is also unique in using fMRI in combination with growth curve modeling to account for patterns of change during treatment—including both final severity levels and slope of outcome measures over time—and their relation to brain function.\n\nHeterogeneity in reward-related brain function among young people with depression may provide information on which people or which symptoms are likely to improve with treatment. Given that heterogeneity in response to treatment is considered the norm in depression (Brent et al., 2008), understanding the physiological markers that characterize potential responders could inform the development of new treatments or the personalization of existing treatments.\n\nFindings that reward-related brain function predicted lower final anxiety symptoms and faster-decreasing anxiety symptoms are consistent with the hypothesis that higher, and potentially more adaptive, reward-related brain function before treatment is associated with better treatment response. A possible explanation for this is that flexible reward responding, with its implications for affiliative behavior (Bora, Yücel, & Allen, 2009), could serve as a mechanism in effective engagement in CBT. Such engagement could be expressed in the social, cognitive, or behavioral aspects of CBT. An adolescent with depression and comorbid anxiety who also responds to rewards might respond more collaboratively to the therapist, have optimism that the treatment will be helpful, be more motivated to try techniques suggested in treatment, experience more positive affect to behavioral activation, and have more awareness and enjoyment of positive changes in mood and experiences that occur with treatment. Along with an earlier study's findings on the positive clinical prognostic value of subjective positive affect in adolescents with depression (Joiner, Lewinsohn, & Seeley, 2002), the current findings support the hypothesis that relatively higher positive affect could be protective in youth with depression and anxiety.\n\nThe current findings about the association between reward-related brain function and anxiety symptoms parallel, in some ways, other studies' findings that affect-related brain function predicts treatment response. Most of the previous studies have focused on neural response to negative affect (Chen et al., 2007) or on threat-related brain systems (McClure et al., 2007), and although the current findings focus on reward-related rather than threat-related brain systems, the regulation of both systems is postulated to be altered in depression (Clark & Watson, 1991; Fowles, 1988). Interestingly, anxiety is postulated to differ from depression in its weaker association with alterations in positive affect (Clark & Watson, 1991), a construct that includes reward responding. That conceptual view is not supported by the current findings or by other findings on reward processing in anxiety traits or disorders (e.g., Forbes et al., 2006; Guyer et al., 2006). Perhaps appropriate affective responding rather than blunted affective response, regardless of stimulus valence, promotes the ability to benefit from treatment. This hypothesis must be tested by examining both reward-related and threat-related brain function in a single sample and, ideally, in a single task. Our task did not allow this, so this question must be addressed by future studies.\n\nNotably, depressive symptoms were not associated with reward-related brain function. The MFQ, our measure of depressive symptoms, is valuable as a depression screening tool and is more effective at detecting depressive than anxiety disorders (Katon et al., 2008). It is thus unlikely that the instrument measured anxiety symptoms better than depressive symptoms. In growth curve models, low variability in slope for depressive symptoms over time limited our ability to test the relation between reward-related brain function and rate of change in depressive symptoms, and thus we could not report associations between brain function and slope for depressive symptoms. This low variability could reflect a fairly uniform pattern of improvement in depressive symptoms among the adolescents in the current sample, and this similarity in pattern of improvement leaves little room for identifying factors related to improvement. In the current sample, anxiety symptoms had a more variable slope across time than did depressive symptoms, which could have been related to the presence of comorbid anxiety disorders in some participants. In addition, the difference between depressive symptom change and anxiety symptom change perhaps reflects the presence of more potential sources of influence on the improvement of anxiety with treatment.\n\nThe literature on anxiety disorders provides little context for our findings with anxiety symptoms. Because no previous studies have examined reward-related brain function as a predictor of treatment response in anxiety, and few theoretical models of anxiety postulate alterations in reward functioning, it is difficult to interpret the association of reward-related brain function with change in anxiety symptoms. A possible explanation is that reward-related brain function is related to general affective psychopathology rather than to depression in particular. Alternatively, the functioning of putative reward-related brain areas such as the striatum has yet to be determined definitively, and the striatum might be critical in some ways to the pathophysiology of anxiety. With the current pattern of findings, we cannot rule out the possibility that reward-related brain function is related more to treatment change involving anxiety than depression. Greater striatal reactivity has been reported in studies of adolescents with anxiety-related temperament (Guyer et al., 2006) or disorders (Forbes et al., 2006), and the next step in this line of research will be to directly compare the relation of reward-related brain function to treatment response in adolescents with anxiety only, depression only, and comorbid anxiety and depression.\n\nThe relation of reward-related medial PFC reactivity to slower rate of improvement in anxiety symptoms is consistent, to some extent, with findings on medial PFC involvement in depression. In adults with depression, medial PFC reactivity to affective stimuli is enhanced (Sheline et al., 2009), and decreased resting medial PFC activity is associated with improvement after CBT (Goldapple et al., 2004). Also, adolescents with depression exhibit greater reward-related medial PFC reactivity (Forbes, Hariri et al., 2009). Because the medial PFC is part of the default-mode network, the association of mPFC reward-related reactivity with less rapid improvement in anxiety suggests that difficulty disengaging from the usual, self-focused mental state interferes with response to treatment in adolescents with depression. The current association of medial PFC reactivity and change in anxiety symptoms could indicate that anxiety (at least in the context of comorbidity with depression) confers similar functional alterations to regions in the default mode network.\n\nIn contrast, the finding that greater overall clinical severity at the end of treatment was associated with higher striatal reactivity to reward was unexpected, and it does not support our hypothesis that greater reward-related responding predicts better treatment outcome. This correlation was not mirrored in the association between brain function and adolescents' symptoms: Reward-related brain function was unrelated to higher depressive symptoms at the end of treatment, and it was inversely related to anxiety symptoms. A difference between these measures is that overall clinical severity was rated by treatment providers, while symptoms were rated by the adolescents themselves. Treatment providers and adolescents could have different perspectives on the adolescents' symptoms and functioning, and differences in the instruments used for these variables are likely to lead them to capture different aspects of affective problems. It is also possible, of course, that higher reward-related brain function is related to the expression of distress to others even if that distress is not experienced as meaningful by a young person. Furthermore, final severity was associated with striatal reactivity during the outcome condition. Adolescents who exhibit greater response to winning money might respond strongly to external stimuli in general, and as a result, they might be judged as having greater general clinical severity.\n\nOur pattern of findings suggests that it is important to assess brain function in response to both reward anticipation and reward outcome when examining its predictive utility for treatment response. Greater anticipation-related brain function was associated with lower anxiety symptom level at the end of treatment and faster change in anxiety symptoms during treatment. Improvement in anxiety might thus be particularly associated with reward anticipation, which is thought to represent motivation or “wanting,” rather than “liking” of rewards (Berridge & Robinson, 2003).\n\nImprovement in self-reported symptoms was generally similar to that for clinician-rated severity and improvement, but greater reward-related striatal reactivity predicted higher clinician-rated severity and lower self-reported anxiety. However, severity was related to BOLD response during reward outcome, and anxiety was related to response during reward anticipation. It is possible that these two aspects of reward processing—reward anticipation reflecting motivation, and reward outcome reflecting enjoyment—are related to severity and anxiety in opposite ways.\n\nOur findings must be considered in light of some limitations. Several of these were related to our small sample size. First, the sample size may have resulted in Type I errors in finding associations between brain activation and symptom scores and change (Maas & Hox, 2005). In addition, not all participants completed treatment, and missing data created a challenge for analyzing data for all time points for all participants. This was a result of dropout, and although we made extensive efforts to contact participants and encourage completion of treatment, it may be valuable for future studies to use more creative methods to retain participants. Second, we were not able to compare psychosocial and combined psychosocial and pharmacotherapy treatments comprehensively. We could not include medication status in growth curve models, for example. Previous studies of adult depression have revealed that CBT and pharmacotherapy are associated with different patterns of treatment-related changes in brain function (Goldapple et al., 2004). It will be important for research on predictors and mechanisms of treatment response in young people to address possible differences in treatment modalities. Third, we had restricted ability to compare adolescents with and without comorbid anxiety disorders. We have found that depressed adolescents with anxiety disorders are similar in their reward-related brain function to those without comorbid anxiety disorders (Forbes, Hariri et al., 2009), but we have also found, in a different sample, that anxiety symptoms are related to reward-related brain function independently of depressive symptoms (Forbes et al., 2006). It is important to examine comorbidity effects in the prediction of treatment response, and also to consider the possibility that comorbidity of anxiety and depression represents greater severity than the presence of depression alone.\n\nWe acknowledge that our sample size is on the small side for growth curve modeling, but we also note that the number of time points in our study makes growth curve modeling the most appropriate approach to examining change in symptoms, severity, and improvement over time. To address possible power issues for this technique, and guided by the small literature on sample size in multilevel modeling (Maas & Hox, 2005), we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation in Mplus to examine the power to find significant variance estimates for the mean and variance components for the intercept and slope. We included the exact study characteristics from the present data to simulate 100 data sets to provide power estimates for the relevant parameters. Across outcome variables, power estimates for the intercept values, standard error of the intercept values, slope values, and standard error of the slope values were .92, .37, .84, and .34, respectively. Thus, the current study was sufficiently powered to find significant intercept and slope values but had little power to identify significant variance in the intercept and slope parameters. Thus, it is impressive that we found significant variance in four of the eight growth parameters.\n\nSeveral aspects of the study design also limit the scope of our findings. We only collected fMRI data before treatment, so we were not able to examine change in brain function with treatment. This issue is important in understanding the possible roles of reward-related brain function in both the pathophysiology of depression and the mechanisms of treatment response. One study has reported that reward-related areas have impaired functioning both before and after treatment in adult depression (Fu et al., 2007), which suggests that altered reward processing, at least in adults, is trait-like. Our study did not include a wait-list control group, which prevents us from concluding that change in severity reflects response to treatment rather than spontaneous recovery. Also, the high ratio of therapists to participants left us unable to examine potential therapist effects that could have contributed to variability in treatment response. Finally, treating clinicians, rather than independent evaluators, provided assessments of improvement and severity. Thus, some biases may have been present in their responses, even though ratings were performed without knowledge of the fMRI results.\n\nResearch on the pathophysiology and treatment of depression has indicated that development plays an important role in the disorder's onset and course. Findings in adolescents have not provided an exact replication of findings in adults, and developmental psychopathologists have postulated that the biological features of the disorder are different early in life (Kaufman, Martin, King, & Charney, 2001). Even though we did not find that age contributed to treatment response, the broad age range of participants could have introduced other developmental effects into our study. We have found, in a different sample, that striatal response to reward decreases with pubertal maturation in healthy adolescents (Forbes et al., under review), and development of reward-related systems during adolescence could influence the onset, course, and treatment of depression. Therefore, future treatment studies of adolescents should employ designs that allow the careful examination of developmental factors in both the response to treatment over time and the prediction of treatment response from affect-related brain function.\n\nIn summary, this study yielded preliminary findings on reward-related brain function as a predictor of treatment response in adolescents with depression, many of whom had comorbid anxiety disorders. The findings point to the potential importance of reward-related brain function in the treatment of depression, not simply in its pathophysiology. With a more complete understanding of the types of affect-related brain function that indicate which young people with depression will likely have a favorable response to treatment, it will become more possible to improve the efficacy of existing treatments or to develop biologically guided treatments that are personalized."
