        "text": "🌍 Financing the Future: Europe’s Path to Climate Neutrality 🌱 Carlos Eduardo Martins and Wim Van Aken have published an insightful #ESMblog on how the banking union and capital markets union are pivotal in financing the climate change challenge. - The blog outlines the need for billions of euros annually to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change risks. With the EU’s goal of climate neutrality by 2050, the banking and capital markets unions play a key role in mobilizing the necessary funds. The European Commission estimates that Europe needs between €350 billion and €620 billion in additional investments per year until 2030 to achieve its goals. This represents a significant share of the EU’s GDP and investment, highlighting the urgency of the matter. - The ESM emphasizes the importance of the private sector’s role in closing the financing gap, with public-private partnerships being a cornerstone of the investment strategy. For every €1 committed by public entities, the private sector is expected to contribute €41. - This blog is a must-read for anyone involved in finance, policy-making, or simply interested in the economic aspects of Europe’s environmental strategies. Read the full article here: https://lnkd.in/etxdnAPa #ClimateChange #SustainableFinance #EuropeanUnion #GreenTransition #ESM #BankingUnion #CapitalMarketsUnion #ClimateAction #Investment #Finance\n\nWe had a lovely ESM - European Stability Mechanism Staff Summer event. We reflected on the first half of the year, celebrated achievements and looked forward to the future. The event was on a boat that is inspired by the historic Princess Marie-Astrid on which the famous #Schengen agreement was signed June 1985. The signature happened on the 3 country water border of Germany 🇩🇪, France 🇫🇷 and Luxembourg 🇱🇺. See photo below. Thank you for everyone who made the first half 2024 a success and enjoy Summer ☀️! Photo credit: Peter Lindmark\n\nExcellent meetings with Han ten Broeke HCSS - The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies and Joris Teer (刘亚伯） - EU Institute for Security Studies on Europe’s geopolitical situation We discussed: - What to expect from the New Dutch 🇳🇱 government - Europe’s security risks and how to mitigate them - Geopolitical risks of critical materials - Impact of the wars in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia All the topics have a financial stability angle, the core mandate of the ESM - European Stability Mechanism Thanks for the great insights over the course of the day!\n\nBulgaria 🇧🇬 enroute to the Euro 💶! We had the pleasure to welcome Bulgaria’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Lyudmila Petkova, Deputy Minister or Finance Metodi Metodiev, the Ambassador to the EU and Financial Counselor. Bulgaria is due to become the 21st country to adopt de Euro as a currency. Once adopted, the country will become a member and shareholder of the ESM - giving it additional financial security and access to our firepower. We look forwards supporting Bulgaria in the final steps of its journey! Ministry of Finance - Republic of Bulgaria | ESM - European Stability Mechanism\n\nFirst visit of Kristalina Georgieva - MD of International Monetary Fund to ESM! - She shared the global economy does better than expected and flagged the highlights of EuroArea IMF Article 4 - 3 reasons why Europe 🇪🇺 lacks behind US 🇺🇸: 1. US is more energy independant, 2. innovation - even if it comes from Europe scale up is in the US and 3. immigration - in the US it is an economic tailwind that immidiately adds to the workforce and GDP - We showed Kristalina our trading room. While International Monetary Fund and ESM - European Stability Mechanism are similar on the lending side, we finance ourselves differently. IMF finances itself via central banks, ESM issues bonds and has capital to invest. This is why we have 2 trading rooms, which IMF doesn’t have. - Finally, Kristalina spontaneously met some fellow Bulgarians 🇧🇬 Thank you for the visit! 📸 Dora Siklos, Panayota Bakalakou and Peter Lindmark\n\nImportant week - our Annual Meetings! It was great to welcome the EuroArea Ministers of Finance and Deputies. 🌟 Highlights: - ESM’s annual report was approved, with €321 million profit and largest income from investments since our creation. Full report: https://lnkd.in/edZV67Cn - With the ministers, we reviewed our lending toolkit in the light of today’s financial shocks https://lnkd.in/ejMmgdaV - we had great bilaterals with ministers, I joined the one with Vincent Van Peteghem Belgian Minister of Finance 🇧🇪 on with the post election priorities - with the Finnish 🇫🇮 Minister Riika Purra we discussed how they gave up midsummer night to be in Luxembourg - With the Greek 🇬🇷, Croatian 🇭🇷, Italian 🇮🇹, Latvian 🇱🇻 and Belgian 🇧🇪 Minister we discussed the #Euro2024 games with important matches coming up - with Mindaugas Liutvinskas from Lithuania 🇱🇹 we spoke about the Baltic situation Thank you 🙏 for the great support from our 20 shareholders, the countries of the EuroArea. And a big thank you to the ESM team for organising a successful event!"
