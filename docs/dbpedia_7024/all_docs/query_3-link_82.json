        "text": "Submunition Type\n\nDelivery weapon type (and quantity of submunitions)\n\nNotes\n\n* The term \"dual purpose\" denotes a submunition with both anti-vehicle and antipersonnel fragmentation effects.\n\nCivilian Harm from Cluster Munitions\n\nThe exact number of cluster munition attacks thus far in the 2022-2023 conflict is not known, but hundreds have been documented, reported, or credibly alleged, mostly in populated areas. At least 10 of the country’s 24 regions (oblasts) have been affected by the use of cluster munitions: Chernihivska, Dnipropetrovska, Donetska, Kharkivska, Khersonska, Luhanska, Mykolaivska, Odeska, Sumska, and Zaporizka. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal stated in April 2023 that about 174,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian land is now contaminated with explosive objects, which killed 226 people in the month of March 2023 alone.[13]\n\nThe cluster munition attack with the highest known civilian casualties occurred on April 8, 2022, when Russia launched a Tochka-U ballistic missile equipped with a cluster munition warhead at a crowded train station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk as hundreds of people were trying to leave the area. A detailed Human Rights Watch investigation found that the attack killed at least 58 civilians and injured over 100 others.[14]\n\nThe following cluster munition attacks since May 2022 were predominately undertaken by Russian forces and demonstrate civilian harm from these weapons.[15]\n\nRussian armed forces used cluster munition rockets in attacks on Kharkiv city and nearby areas in Kharkivska region in May 2022 according to an investigation by Human Rights Watch.[16] Two volunteers were wounded on May 12 when a cluster munition rocket pierced the roof of a cultural center in Derhachi, near Kharkiv city. Two civilians about a kilometer away were killed, at around the same time, by submunitions – possibly from the same rocket. On May 23, a cluster munition attack struck a maternity clinic in Kharkiv city, wounding a man at a bus stop outside the clinic.\n\nUkrainian armed forces reportedly used cluster munitions in attacks on Izium city, Kharkivska region, between March and September 2022, when it was controlled by Russian armed forces, according to the Independent Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine.[17] The commission provided three examples illustrating this use of cluster munitions in Izium: a May 9, 2022 an attack on a residential area that killed three people and injured six; a July 14, 2022 attack on the central market that injured two older women; and, a July 16, 2022 attack on a residential area that killed two older persons.\n\nUragan cluster munition rocket attacks by Russian forces on the city of Sloviansk on June 27, 2022 killed a man and wounded three other civilians, according to Agence France Presse.[18]\n\nRussian armed forces used cluster munitions in an attack on city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovska region on July 9, 2022, killing two civilian women and wounding a civilian man, according to a statement by the Dnipropetrovska region Prosecutor's Office.[19]\n\nA Russian attack using Uragan cluster munition rockets killed a 70-year-old man and wounded two civilian women in an apartment building in Chuhuiv city, Kharkivska region on August 3, 2022, according to local authorities.[20]\n\nA cluster munition rocket attack by Russian forces reportedly killed two civilians and wounded 12 others near a public transportation stop in Mykolaiv on September 29, 2022, according to local authorities.[21]\n\nRussian armed forces used cluster munitions rockets in at least three attacks on Kherson city in November 2022, according to Human Rights Watch.[22] One attack wounded three people as they were walking down a city street on November 21.\n\nAn Uragan cluster munition rocket attack by Russian forces on the town of Hirnyk, Donetska region on December 12 killed two civilians and wounded 10 more, according to the Prosecutor General’s Office.[23]\n\nRussian forces fired Uragan cluster munition rockets near the central market in the town of Konstyantynivka in Donetska region on March 18, 2023, wounding at least six civilians, according to the region’s governor.[24] That same day, Russian forces used cluster munitions in an attack on the city of Kramatorsk, which killed at least two people and wounded eight.[25]\n\nA Russian cluster munition attack on the village of Malokaterynivka in eastern Ukraine on May 10 wounded eight people including three emergency medical workers, according to the governor of Zaporizka region.[26]\n\nRussia's Response\n\nThe Russian government has generally avoided commenting on its use of cluster munitions in Ukraine but has not denied using the weapons. Instead, it has sought to draw attention to past use of cluster munitions by, for example, NATO member states in Yugoslavia in 1999.[27]\n\nAfter the April 8, 2022, Russian cluster munition attack on the Kramatorsk train station, the Russian Defense Ministry blamed Ukraine for the attack.[28] Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov repeated the unsubstantiated claim on April 20.[29]\n\nRussia and its proxy forces previously used cluster munitions in eastern Ukraine in 2014 until a 2015 ceasefire, causing numerous civilian casualties.[30] Russia repeatedly drew attention to Ukraine’s use of cluster munitions at the time, but never acknowledged its role in using cluster munitions. Russia has never explicitly denied its direct involvement in supporting the Syrian government’s cluster munition attacks since 2015, which Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov told Human Rights Watch in 2016 were carried out in compliance with international humanitarian law.[31]\n\nRussia is the most vocal state critic of the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which it says it cannot join as it regards cluster munitions as “a legitimate type of weapon that is not banned by international humanitarian law and plays a significant role in the defense interests of Russia.”[32] Russia last participated as an observer in a meeting of the convention in 2012.\n\nUkraine’s Response\n\nUkraine has not denied credible evidence of its own use of cluster munitions in the current conflict. The New York Times was the first to report Ukrainian cluster munition use. It found evidence that strongly suggested that Ukrainian forces used Uragan cluster munition rockets in Husarivka in Kharkivska region on March 6 or 7, 2022 when Russian forces occupied the village.[33] The New York Times published the following response from Ukraine’s military:\n\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine strictly adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law. One of our constant priorities is the security of the civilian population. We do not open fire or destroy civilian objects, nor do we use weapons and methods prohibited by the Geneva Conventions.\n\nUkraine inherited a large stockpile of cluster munitions after the breakup of the Soviet Union and used them in the Donetska and Luhanska regions in 2014 and 2015.[34] At that time, the Ukrainian government repeatedly denied using cluster munitions and blamed the attacks on Russia-sponsored armed groups and the Russian armed forces. Ukraine reported in 2011 that cluster munitions constituted 35 percent of its stocks of conventional weapons, which totaled two million tons of ammunition.[35]\n\nIn September 2022, an unpaid US advisor to the commander in chief of the Ukraine Armed Forces, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, wrote an article in September 2022 advising Ukraine to request dual-purpose improved conventional munition (DPICM) submunitions from US stockpiles for Ukraine to use in its 155mm artillery systems.[36] Since then, several media outlets have reported on the Ukrainian government’s requests to be supplied with cluster munitions.[37] According to US lawmakers, Ukraine has also requested MK-20 Rockeye cluster bombs – also known as CBU-99 or CBU-100.[38]\n\nAt the Munich Security Conference in February 2023, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Olexander Kubrakov, and foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, appealed for Ukraine to be supplied with cluster munitions.[39] In response, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told media that \"NATO has neither recommended nor supplied these kinds of weapons. We supply artillery and other types of weapons, but not cluster bombs.\"[40]\n\nUkraine has not taken any steps to join the Convention on Cluster Munitions and last participated as an observer in a meeting of the convention in 2014.[41]\n\nInternational Response\n\nThe Convention on Cluster Munitions obligates each state party to “promote the norms it establishes and … make its best efforts to discourage States not party to this Convention from using cluster munitions.”[42] States parties should firmly oppose any use of cluster munitions by any warring party under any circumstances.[43]\n\nIn accordance with this explicit provision and the emerging international norm, the use of cluster munitions in Ukraine been condemned by at least 40 states: Albania, Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Mexico, Republic of Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Romania, San Marino, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.[44]\n\nThe United States government has expressed deep alarm at Russia’s use of cluster munitions in Ukraine.[45] However, it backtracked on a comment from one senior US official who criticized cluster munitions as unacceptable weapons that “have no place on the battlefield.”[46] This reflects the unwillingness of the US to join the convention.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg has called Russia’s use of cluster munitions in Ukraine “inhumane” and “in violation” of international law.[47] All of NATO’s 31 member states have ratified the Convention on Cluster Munitions except Estonia, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Turkey, and the United States.\n\nThe cluster munition attacks in Ukraine have also been condemned by the European Union and its member and candidate states, the UN high commissioner for human rights, and UN special rapporteurs and experts. It has also been condemned by the nongovernmental Cluster Munition Coalition, which is chaired by Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe condemnations of the use of cluster munitions in Ukraine in 2022 as well as strong media coverage and public outcry demonstrate the growing stigma against these weapons.\n\nTurkey and Ukraine both denied an article published by a US media outlet in January 2023 that claimed Turkey—which is not a party to the convention—had transferred cluster munitions to Ukraine in November 2022.[48] The Turkish president's spokesperson, Ibrahim Kalin, denied the report and reportedly stated, “We don't have cluster munitions and we haven't provided them to Ukraine.”[49] Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey, Vasyl Bodnar, denied the alleged transfer as “Russian propaganda.”[50]\n\nStates that have joined the Convention on Cluster Munitions are prohibited from assisting, encouraging, or inducing anyone to engage in any activity banned under the convention. Therefore, any NATO or other military operation in support of Ukraine in which states parties participate could not assist with the use or transfer of cluster munitions. In addition, states parties may not transfer any remaining cluster munitions that have retained or have yet to destroy to Ukraine due to the convention’s prohibition on transfer.\n\nGermany’s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, said in February 2023 that “Germany won’t authorize the transfer of cluster bombs to Ukraine.”[51] He was responding to media reports claiming that Estonia was considering providing Ukraine with German-made 155mm DM632 cluster munition projectiles.[52] Such a transfer requires approval of the German government.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nFor more Human Rights Watch reporting on cluster munitions in Ukraine, see:\n\n“Ukraine: Russian Cluster Munition Hits Hospital,” February 25, 2022, https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/02/25/ukraine-russian-cluster-munition-hits-hospital.\n\n“Ukraine: Cluster Munitions Launched Into Kharkiv Neighborhoods,” March 4, 2022, https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/04/ukraine-cluster-munitions-launched-kharkiv-neighborhoods.\n\n“Ukraine: Cluster Munitions Repeatedly Used on Mykolaiv,” March 17, 2022, https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/17/ukraine-cluster-munitions-repeatedly-used-mykolaiv.\n\nIntense and Lasting Harm: Cluster Munition Attacks in Ukraine, May 11, 2022, https://www.hrw.org/report/2022/05/11/intense-and-lasting-harm/cluster-munition-attacks-ukraine.\n\n“Ukraine: Russian Strikes Killed Scores of Civilians in Chernihiv,” June 10, 2022, https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/06/10/ukraine-russian-strikes-killed-scores-civilians-chernihiv.\n\n\"Ukraine: Unlawful Russian Attacks in Kharkiv,\" August 16, 2022,” https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/08/16/ukraine-unlawful-russian-attacks-kharkiv.\n\n“Growing Civilian Toll from Russian Cluster Munition Attacks,” August 25, 2022, https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/08/25/growing-civilian-toll-russian-cluster-munition-attacks.\n\n“Ukraine: Apparent Cluster Munition Hit Kherson,” December 13, 2022, https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/12/13/ukraine-apparent-cluster-munitions-hit-kherson.\n\n“Ukraine: New Light on Russia’s Rail Station Attack,” February 21, 2023, https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/02/21/ukraine-new-light-russias-rail-station-attack.\n\n[1] Convention on Cluster Munitions, adopted May 30, 2008, Dublin Diplomatic Conference for the Adoption of a Convention on Cluster Munitions, CCM/77, entered into force August 1, 2010, https://www.clusterconvention.org/.\n\n[2] See Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, article 51(4).
