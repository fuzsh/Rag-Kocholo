        "text": "Stop Motion Animation Workshop with Andy Gaukel\n\nIn this engaging workshop kids, adults, and their families learn through hands-on creation, demonstrations, and behind-the-scenes footage, how the same methods that studios employ on large-scale films can be used to create stop motion animation at home. This is a one-of-a-kind workshop with artist/educator, Andy Gaukel, whose work has been presented throughout Germany, France, Montreal, and the US. Up to 15 people are offered the opportunity to work with this master artist with a culminating performance at the end of the day, which will be open and free to the public. If you cannot be in the workshop be sure to come to the culminating presentation at the end of the day.\n\nAndy Gaukel is a Hudson Valley, NY based theatre and puppetry artist and educator whose work has been presented throughout the world including Le Mouffetard in Paris, France; Casteliers (Montreal); Blickwechsel in Magdeburg, Germany; the Chicago International Puppet Theatre Festival, among others. Andy’s puppetry education company, Atomic Arts, is proud to be serving the students and teachers of several CUNY early childhood centers including Bronx Community College, LaGuardia Community College, City Tech and Lehman College. Andy is also proud to bring puppetry programs to Imagine Learning Centers across the five boroughs and New Jersey. Andy is the proud recipient of five Jim Henson Foundation grants to help further his original work.\n\n“Andy Gaukel created quite an astonishing show…The result is powerfully evocative, poetic and very moving. We gradually forget the puppets and let ourselves get swept away by the emotion of the story. Amazing.”\n\n- COUP DE THÉÀTRE, Paris\n\n“With Schweinehund…Andy Gaukel and Myriame Larose offer a real lesson in puppetry.”\n\n- (MON)theatre, Montreal\n\nThis project is made possible with funds from the Statewide Community Regrant Program, a regrant program of the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of The Office of the Governor and the New York State Legislature and administered by CREATE Council on the Arts.\n\nView Event →\n\nVKB Band\n\n“My advice is to delay your heart break and see them now” - Penny Arcade\n\nVickiKristinaBarcelona is Rachelle Garniez, Amanda Homi and Mamie Minch, a power trio of music veterans dedicated to re-imagining the songs of Tom Waits via inventive three-part harmonies and a treasure trove of instruments including banjos, bottles, squeezebox and zills. They create a world of sound at once powerful, playful and poignant.\n\nSeasoned singers and songwriters, each a hybrid story-teller and multi-instrumentalist in her own right, join forces to salute the tragicomic lyrical genius of the Waits songbook. Picture the Triplets of Belleville disguised as Depression Era hobos riding the rails across America stopping to play dance parties and funerals along the road to nowhere.\n\nThree distinct styles form a captivating original mix, greater than the sum of its' parts, never failing to amaze and delight audiences of all stripes.\n\nThis project is made possible in part with funds from the Statewide Community Regrant Program, a regrant program of the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of The Office of the Governor and the New York State Legislature and administered by CREATE Council on the Arts.\n\nOTHER Contributors to this event: Rebecca and Richard Bell.

SPOHR Grand Nonet for Winds & Strings, op. 31, D. BRUCE Steampunk\n\nABOUT THE EVENT: David Bruce, a modern-day Master, has ingeniously crafted compositions that embody the essence of a Victorian-inspired, steam-powered universe. With an ingenious fusion of classical sophistication and avant-garde ingenuity, Bruce’s works capture the very essence of this alternate reality. Be prepared to be swept away by the haunting melodies, pulsating rhythms, and breathtaking orchestrations that are guaranteed to leave you awe-inspired. In the Nonet No. 2, Bohuslav Martinu’s vivid imagination takes flight, guiding you through a soundscape that pulsates with the energy of progress.

The Brooklyn based musician has become widely admired and much sought after for his unique approach to the violin. Primarily an improvising player, he has performed and recorded in a wide variety of musical styles, from blues and bluegrass, to jazz.\n\nBurnham became known internationally after joining James Blood Ulmer’s Oddessey Band in 1983. Since then he has recorded and performed with such musical luminaries as Cassandra Wilson, Wynton Marsalis, Henry Threadgill, Henry Butler, Nora Jones, Living Colour, Queen Esther, John Zorn, Steve Swell, Rufus Wainwright, Krishna Das, Kenny Wollesen, Billie Joe Armstrong, Jason Kao Hwang, The Woes, Hem, Elysian Fields, Adam Rudolph, the Heavy Circles, Mario Pavone, Joan As Police Woman, Gabrielle roth, Robert Musso, Jai Uttal, Soul Syndicate, Rick Moranis, Doug Wamble, Robert Musso, Babby Paunetto, Sasha Dobson, Kato Hideki and Emily Coates..\n\nHe is currently writing and performing new and original material often scored for small ensembles, and in particular, duets. These latest pieces feature Burnham singing original lyrics in his husky and soulful voice. Blues and gospel music has been his inspiration for his latest works.\n\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE\n\nView Event →\n\nBassoons! 4 of them!\n\nNorthWinds\n\nBassoon Ensemble\n\nA gaggle of geese, a school of fish, a murder of crows -- a monsoon of bassoons?\n\nThe bassoonists of NorthWinds have found a cheerful and spirited platform for this unsung bass wind pipe. The ensemble was formed in 2017 with the idea that all music is created equal -- except in a bassoon ensemble, which is more equal than others. These players bring out the jaunty, the moody, the serene, and the serious nature of the instrument with an easygoing and open style. The enthusiasm is infectious as the group performs and chats with the audience. What’s a double reed? You “crow” a reed? Wait, it’s eight feet long? Is a contrabassoon really eighteen feet long? Hold on -- is that an accordion up there? You might just get lucky with this group and hear something completely unexpected.\n\nAs for credentials: the group has one PhD, five graduate degrees, and years of study with prestigious musicians, including NY Phil players. One of us has even left behind a distinguished career as an oboist and has come to see the light as a bassoonist. Between the group we have toured Europe, performed solos with major orchestras, been part of Grammy nominated ensembles, and of course, trekked through the work-a-day world of the freelance musician. What’s really needed is a bit more fun now; and here it is.\n\nNorthWinds Ensemble is especially well suited to intimate settings like THE HALL at Panther Creek Arts where the audience and performers have a moment to exchange thoughts and listen to this lesser known beauty of the orchestral winds.\n\nJohn Douglas Ferrigno\n\nKaren Kelland\n\nCornelia McGiver\n\nNora Post\n\nView Event →\n\nOUR TOWN by Thornton Wilder\n\nDeb Hecht has once again spearheaded the campaign to bring drama to West Fulton.

I was an outside child. We walked miles up through cow pastures, made rooms in the woods, and castles and drawings in the sand in the summer. The layers, the patterns and colors of my natural surroundings are the source for my art.

And what role does “drama” play in our lives at any age?\n\nAny story can be told in a presentational way, often with a dramatic flair! With the teacher, children use any skills they already possess — music, dance, visual arts, public speaking, circus, magic, etc., to create a piece of theatre that is one-of-a-kind unique! It’s a talent show, more or less, highlighting your children — giving them a moment to be in the spotlight as themselves or as a character in a play… It’s all about inclusion, celebrating their comfort levels and contribution to the whole! Always different, always dynamic, never short on the DRAMA!!!!\n\nFor Tickets Click Here\n\nView Event →"
