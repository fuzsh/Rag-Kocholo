He attended the technical secondary school in Ljubljana and continued his studies between 1924 and 1929 at the Zagreb Academy of Fine Arts with the professors Rudolf Valdec, Frano Kršinić, Ivo Kredić and Ivan Meštrović. Between the years 1945 and 1970, Kalin taught sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana; he was also its dean for two terms. He educated numerous generations of younger colleagues who have become prominent European creators. Kalin was one of the few Slovene sculptors who mastered stone carving. In 1953 he became a full member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\nHe died in Ljubljana. His younger brother Zdenko Kalin was also a renowned sculptor.\n\nWork\n\nBoris Kalin mainly created classically formed portraits, public monuments and acts.\n\nFor his work he was bestowed with Prešeren Award three times: in 1947 for his statue \"The Fifteen-year-old Girl\" (\"Petnajstletna\") that was said to represent his daughter, in 1948 for his statue \"A Portrait of Marshal Tito\" (\"Portret Maršala Tita\"), and in 1950 for his \"Monument to the People's Liberation War\" (\"Spomenik narodnoosvobodilni borbi\") in Vrhnika.\n\nSome of his sculptures are kept in the mansion Brdo pri Kranju as part of the representative collection of modern Slovenian art.\n\nReferences\n\n*"
