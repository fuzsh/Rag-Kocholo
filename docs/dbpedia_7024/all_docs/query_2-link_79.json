        "text": "»The Karađorđević monuments were erected as expressions of gratitude to the kings who had liberated the Slovene nation. At the same time, they glorified the ruling dynasty and symbolized the idea of Yugoslavism«. A review of the monuments shows that the figurative (thus the most luxurious) monuments dedicated to the kings Peter I. and Alexander I. were not exclusively a matter of larger settlements and that their location was carefully chosen in every case. The statues adorned local centers, central parks, or Sokol Society halls. Several monuments were strategically erected along the state border, where they were supposed to encourage the Slovenes and other Yugoslavs while acting as a reminder to hostile foreigners. The list of sculptors and architects who designed and created the monuments is full of distinguished names of the Slovenian interwar sculpture and architecture milieu, which points to the strict scrutiny enjoyed by said monuments. Even though the monuments were in the service of propaganda meant to strengthen the power of the state, they were also works of art, thanks to carefully selected authors. Unfortunately, none of the monuments described is preserved. During the World War II occupation, statues depicting the former royal dynasty were an unwanted memory of a bygone era in the eyes of the occupiers and were therefore destroyed in the first weeks and months of the occupation.\n\nSpomenik seems to be the most recent word of Croatian and other languages of former Yugoslavia which has entered English language. Originally, the term denotes any kind of architectural or sculptural work dedicated to important people and events, and is generally used for all historical periods and purposes, regardless of their artistic and/or political characteristics. However, what it recently seems to become associated with on the Internet is a specific art-historical sculptural phenomenon from the second half of the 20th century. Due to Yugoslav unaligned political position in the context of the Cold War, its official attitude toward Modernist aesthetics was of considerate political importance as it served as a visible and evident demonstration of political independence, as well as compliance with both sides. Therefore, many official state commissions of the second half of the 20th century resulted in a peculiar blend of shape and content: while featuring High Modernist aesthetics and formal repertoire of contemporary Western art, they celebrated the defeat of Fascism and the victory of Communist ideas. By analysing contemporary semantic shift – semantic narrowing – of the term spomenik which seems to be happening on various foreign websites (from highly specialized to trivial ones), my paper will try to observe problems of the Western perception of Central Eastern European art of the socialist period, and on a more general level, the problem of the western perception of the so-called peripheral modernities.\n\nThe Places of Memory of the First World War in Croatia Until recently it was commonly believed that the newly-established political climate in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, or later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, impeded the construction of monuments and memorials to soldiers that died fighting for Austria-Hungary. I will prove that this is a belief with little or no basis in reality. While it is true that some of these memorials were removed from public spaces, the majority of these were in fact erected in honor of the Emperor and King Franz Joseph, the Austro- Hungarian state and the Austro-Hungarian army. I have divided the remaining places of memory in Croatia into the following categories: war cemeteries, public monuments–memorials to those that died in the war, individual gravestones, cenotaphs, ossuaries, mausoleums, memorial plaques, photo panels and crossroad crucifixes. War cemeteries were built next to civilian and military hospitals throughout Croatia (e.g., at Bjelovar, Pakrac, Vukovar-Bršadin, Vinkovci, Ilok, Požega, and Slavonski Brod). Today, the remains of these cemeteries exist only in Zagreb, Osijek, Karlovac, Našice, Pula and Sisak. War memorials from this time can be found in Dubrovnik, Korčula, Karlovac, Ogulin, Otočac, Sisak, Sušak and Varaždin. Most of the monuments were later destroyed and today no longer exist. Moreover, many of these monuments and memorials were erected after the end of the war. They were sometimes built in public spaces, in town squares, parks or next to parish churches, but most often appeared in local cemeteries. We have information about some of the initiators of these projects, the circumstances in which some were built, and the identities of some of the authors. For the most part, however, we have no information. The majority of the monuments or memorials were crosses, sculptures, and obelisks with lists of victims’ names, or they were simple memorials with the inscription 1914–1918, obviously referring to the First World War. To the best of my knowledge, memorials that were built after the war ended and that honored the war victims include those in Zagreb, Pakrac, Dol (on Hvar), Gola, Jarmina, Varaždin, Čakovec, Šemovci (near Virje), Đurđevac, Gospić, and Koprivnički Ivanec. The memorials erected during the interwar period are dedicated to all victims regardless of nationality or religion. However, there are also examples that prove this was not always the case. For example, a cenotaph dedicated to local Germans who died in the war was erected in Krndija (1926), while Križevci (1935), Koprivnica (1934), and Zagreb (1930) all contain memorials to Jews who were killed in the conflict. In Križevci (1935), Koprivnica (1934), Zagreb (1930) and Slavonski Brod (?) we find monuments to fallen Jews. Photo panels are another form of memorial. Such panels were placed in Đakovo, Nuštar, Vinkovci, Koprivnica and Koprivnički Ivanec. Other communities produced metal plaques with the names of fallen parishioners and locals. Most of these were placed on the inside walls of churches, but some were also placed on the outside (e.g., at Šestine, Našice, Karlovac, and Varaždinske Toplice). Smaller villages and individual citizens put up crucifixes at crossroads, usually in front of churches or in cemeteries (as seen in Čazma, Milaševac, Bosiljevo, Dragičevci, Vučani, Dubrovčan, and Šemovci). The neglect and even destruction of graves, cemeteries, memorials and monuments 13 from the First World War became commonplace after 1945. The restoration of the old First World War memorials and the construction of new ones in Croatia began only a few years ago, and such activities have mostly been related to the centenary of the war."
