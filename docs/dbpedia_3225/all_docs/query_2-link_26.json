        "text": "Submerged beneath the crystal clear waters off Key Largo lies a remarkable sight ‚Äì the Christ of the Abyss statue. This 8.5-foot tall bronze sculpture depicts Jesus Christ with his head tilted upwards and hands raised towards the heavens, embodying a sense of peace and tranquility.\n\nOriginally created and cast by Guido Galletti in 1954, the first Christ of the Abyss was placed in the Mediterranean Sea offshore from the Italian Riviera town of San Fruttuoso near Camogli, Italy. It was the sculptor‚Äôs gift to the people of the sea to protect local divers.\n\nThe Key Largo Christ of the Abyss is one of several additional casts of Galletti‚Äôs famous underwater statue. It was installed in 1966 as the first underwater Christ statue in the United States.\n\nResting in about 25 feet of water in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, this iconic statue has become a beloved diving and snorkeling attraction. Over the decades, it has been embraced by the local marine life, with colorful sponges, corals, and schools of tropical fish making their home around the peaceful Christ figure.\n\nTo view this underwater wonder, visitors can book snorkeling tours or scuba diving charters from Key Largo operators. Many opt for snorkel tours, as the relatively shallow depth allows good visibility of the statue from the surface with a simple mask and snorkel.\n\nCome, the Keys are calling. ‚òÄÔ∏èüèùüê†üêü\n\nReady to explore?
