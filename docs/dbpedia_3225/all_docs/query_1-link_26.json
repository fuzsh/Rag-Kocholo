        "text": "Key Largo is a good demonstration of the value of star power, and how it can sometimes overcome the weakness of the original source material. The story was based on a script that had to be rewritten extensively, as the movie’s director John Huston thought it was poor. The final script is presumably much better, but it does have its weaknesses. Lionel Barrymore draws the short straw here, and he is left to struggle with some insipid dialogue.\n\nThe movie had other constraints. It was based on a play, and this accounts for its stagey settings. Almost all the action takes place in one hotel, and we have to wait until the end of the movie to see any real action. After his last movie ran over budget, Huston was kept in rein here. The storm scenes are obvious models and, as if that is not bad enough, they are stock footage lifted from an earlier Warner Brothers movie, Night Unto Night.\n\nAnd yet…and yet…Key Largo is an immensely entertaining movie that overcomes the limitations of its script, budget and setting. While a good cast and a good director cannot always redeem a bad movie, consider the talent that is on offer here. It has a great villain in Edward G Robinson. At the time Robinson’s status was so high that his name had appeared above Humphrey Bogart’s in all of their movies together. For this, their last time together onscreen, the two had equal status. Robinson’s standing was still so strong that he is given a delayed entry in the movie, adding dramatic weight when he finally does appear.\n\nThe movie also marks the final pairing of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, the couple whose offscreen and onscreen chemistry added flavour to the four movies they made together. As the hero Bogart has more to do, and Bacall is often left to give smouldering looks at Bogart. However there are moments when we catch of a glimpse of Bacall’s more spirited screen persona. She is ready to scratch or spit on Robinson’s face, and to bitterly criticise Bogart for his seeming cowardice.\n\nWe should also not forget Claire Trevor. Her performance as the faded lush, Gaye Dawn, adds pathos to the movie, and won her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. She plays a singer who was the lover of Johnny Rocco (Edward G Robinson) before he was expelled from America. After not seeing her for eight years, Rocco is disgusted to find that she has slid into alcoholism and lost her singing talent.\n\nHe now despises her, and openly makes a play for Nora Temple (Bacall) in front of Gaye. What he whispers in the ear of the stony-faced Nora is inaudible to the audience, but we assume that he is making comments of a sexual nature. Ultimately Rocco’s mistreatment of Gaye will prove to be his undoing, as we shall see.\n\nHowever the greatest star of all is John Huston, the talented director who made so many great movies over a number of decades. It is Huston who managed to paper over the cracks in the movie, and to tease good acting performances from his cast. The result is a movie that strains for a far greater significance than its gangster movie origins might suggest.\n\nBogart plays Frank McCloud, a former Major who has left the army after the end of World War Two. McCloud finds that he is unable to stick to the job he had before the war, and he drifts from place to place. He decides to visit Key Largo to meet the father and widow of George Temple, a soldier and friend of his who died in the Italian campaign. It is possible that his decision to go there is also influenced by a wish to find a job at sea. He is finding life on land too complicated for his tastes, as he explains later.\n\nMcCloud finds a chilly welcome when he enters the Largo Hotel, which is owned by the Temples. A group of shady looking characters are staying there, supposedly on a fishing trip, and they insist that the hotel is only open for them exclusively, and he has to leave. There is something wrong in this hotel.\n\nNext McCloud speaks to George’s father, James Temple (Lionel Barrymore) and to George’s widow, Nora (Bacall). They are touched by McCloud’s story, and he is invited to stay at the hotel. Temple has no problem in offering McCloud the chance to stay in George’s old room, and from the looks that Nora offers to him, it seems that he has a prospect of taking George’s widow too. Nora explains that marriage with George offered her roots, and it seems as if she will now be able to offer the same roots to McCloud.\n\nHowever, this is not going to be a romantic tale. The disreputable guests at the Largo Hotel are actually mobsters led by Johnny Rocco (Robinson). Their reason for staying here is to prepare the way for Rocco to return to America, and to arrange a counterfeit money racket with Rocco’s American contact. After a police officer recognises Rocco, it becomes necessary for the gangsters to take over the hotel, and to hold the Temples and McCloud hostage.\n\nFrom here the story becomes a test of human integrity and courage for McCloud. A disillusioned ex-soldier, McCloud is seeking a peaceful and uncomplicated life, but he finds himself in a situation where his wish for neutrality is increasingly challenged. The hostages have fallen into the hands of a ruthless gang, and a severe hurricane further prolongs their stay at the hotel.\n\nAt the head of this gang is Rocco, the most ruthless of them all. Rocco’s character is an amalgam of Al Capone and Lucky Luciano. A once powerful gangster, Rocco was deported from America for being an undesirable alien. He is embittered and unstable, and at several points he comes close to killing his hostages, and perhaps his own men too.\n\nThis is the man that McCloud faces, and matters come to a head when Rocco throws him a gun and invites him to shoot it out. McCloud refuses the challenge, and the gun is taken up by the police officer who recognised Rocco earlier. It transpires that the gun is not even loaded, and Rocco ruthlessly shoots the officer down. Nora appeals to McCloud, asking him if he knew that the gun was not loaded. However McCloud says that he knew no such thing. The disenchanted Major has no wish to get himself killed over a gangster. Nora has another word for this. She sees it as cowardice.\n\nThe scene is left open for the viewer to interpret. We have grown up on a diet of heroic action heroes who stand up to the villains at every opportunity, but this is a hero who refuses to stick his neck out. However his actions, whatever their motive, prove to be justified since he was not being given a fair chance by Rocco, and he is outnumbered.\n\nThe ruthlessness of Rocco is further demonstrated in later scenes. Rocco misleads the sheriff into shooting a couple of Indians whom he frames for the murder of the police officer. Later, after making his deal with Ziggy, his American contact, Rocco is unconcerned that Gaye Dawn might betray Ziggy to the police.\n\nNonetheless we are not too surprised to discover that our hero will take action and do the right thing in the end. Our first hint of this comes in a scene between Rocco and Gaye Dawn. The alcoholic singer begs Rocco for a drink, but Rocco makes it conditional upon her performing a song for him. The scene is a powerful one. To make it more authentic, John Huston sprang the scene on Claire Trevor without giving her time to prepare, so that her voice would sound more raw when she sang.\n\nGaye’s singing performance is so poor that Rocco refuses to give her the promised drink. McCloud takes pity on her and pours her a drink in defiance of Rocco’s wishes. Rocco strikes him across the face, but McCloud has reasserted his manhood, and Nora softens towards him again. “Your head says one thing but your whole life says another,” she tells him.\n\nWe now have no doubt that McCloud will do the right thing, because he cannot help himself. What’s more, his actions have already saved his life and doomed Rocco, though this is not yet apparent. When Rocco asks McCloud to pilot a boat to help him get away, McCloud has no choice to agree, although he is aware that this may mean his death. However, before they leave Gaye Dawn steals Rocco’s gun, and passes it to McCloud. This will finally give McCloud the edge when the fight begins on the boat.\n\nWhat does this conflict really signify though? Is it purely a desperate struggle for survival in a lonely hotel? In the hands of Huston, the situation is turned into something more meaningful than this. In describing Frank McCloud’s dilemma, I am not merely seeking to repeat the storyline, an unnecessary task since you can watch the movie for yourself.\n\nMcCloud’s predicament reflects that of many Americans at the time. After the optimism of the early Roosevelt years, America had slid into war, and with the arrival of peacetime organised crime was returning to the country. At one point McCloud quotes from Franklin D Roosevelt’s 1942 State of the Union address:\n\n“But we aren’t making all this sacrifice of human effort and lives to return to the kind of a world we had after the last world war. We’re fighting to cleanse the world of ancient evils. Ancient ills. “\n\nRoosevelt was referring to the war with Nazi Germany, but he also expressed aspirations for peace, security and independence. These are the values that Rocco and his men are endangering. Their return to America, and their expressed wishes to bring back the days of mob law and prohibition are repugnant to McCloud who fought for his country. Rocco represents all that is worst in the greedy and acquisitive spirit of the people who hope to run things in post-war America. The respective positions of the two men are expressed clearly at one point:\n\nFrank McCloud: He knows what he wants. Don’t you, Rocco?\n\nJohnny Rocco: Sure.\n\nJames Temple: What’s that?\n\nFrank McCloud: Tell him, Rocco.\n\nJohnny Rocco: Well, I want uh …\n\nFrank McCloud: He wants more, don’t you, Rocco?\n\nJohnny Rocco: Yeah. That’s it. More. That’s right! I want more!\n\nJames Temple: Will you ever get enough?\n\nFrank McCloud: Will you, Rocco?\n\nJohnny Rocco: Well, I never have. No, I guess I won’t. You, do you know what you want?\n\nFrank McCloud: Yes, I had hopes once, but I gave them up.\n\nJohnny Rocco: Hopes for what?\n\nFrank McCloud: A world in which there’s no place for Johnny Rocco.\n\nIt is possible to view the movie on an allegorical level, with James Temple representing America. Indeed he is viewed so by the Indians. “As far as they’re concerned, he’s the United States of America,” Nora observes. The fate of the Indians reflects their position in America. Once they owned the land, and some were royalty. Now they are reduced to selling seashells, if Nora’s joke is to be taken literally. They turn to Temple for shelter during the storm, but they are left outside to weather the elements, and later two of them are killed.\n\nWe can take the idea of Temple as a symbol of America further. His name suggests that he is a temple for all-comers, and his profession is that of a hotel owner. His job is to offer a safe haven for all-comers. However events have weakened him. His offspring has died in war. He is old and crippled, facing a violent storm and needing protection from criminals who seek to take control of his safe haven.\n\nHowever, there is hope for the future. America still has protectors such as McCloud who will risk their lives to keep their country free from the likes of Rocco. The movie ends with McCloud triumphing over his enemies and returning to Key Largo, whilst Nora flings open the curtains and lets in the sunlight. It is an uplifting end to a tough and satisfying movie."
