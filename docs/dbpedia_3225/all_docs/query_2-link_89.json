        "text": "\"The Keys are different from anything I've ever seen,\" said Humphrey Bogart in the 1948 gangster flick, Key Largo. His sentiment added to the atmosphere evoked in the film, with its hot, off-season weather, a moody old hotel with slowly revolving fans, wayward Seminole Indians, a hurricane and ominous bad guys led by Edward G. Robinson.\n\nIn truth, Bogie spoke the words from a Hollywood film set. Neither he nor Lauren Bacall set foot on the Keys for the filming of the movie; only a few interior shots were made in a Key Largo bar. The opening credits roll over an aerial shot of the Overseas Highway, but even that location is much farther down the keys.\n\nNonetheless, moviemakers have been drawn to the little islands ever since, but what you see on screen isn't always what is really there.\n\nI came to the Keys to find the myth behind the fact, seeking the Hollywood rendition of this string of coral rocks running 110 miles, from Key Largo to Key West.\n\nLargo, meaning \"long\" in Spanish, is the largest and most developed of the Keys. U.S. 1 is four lanes here, with billboards and other commercial clutter hiding the nearby blue water of the Atlantic and the green gleam of the gulf. Near mile marker 104 (the highway is marked with signs beginning with 110 at the top of Largo and ending with 0 in Key West), I pulled into the Caribbean Club, the bar of movie myth, as the sign outside says.\n\nThe 50-year-old bar looked its age. Through the open front door I could see through the open back door to the gulf. A narrow beach, a couple of palms and a short dock whisked me momentarily into film reality. People sitting around the rectangular bar were several degrees beyond casual. I wouldn't have known the site from the Key Largo movie presentation, but could see how a location scout would have been inspired to re-create the atmosphere.\n\nAt mile marker 100, the owner of the Holiday Inn was obviously a Bogart fan. He had bought the riverboat used in The African Queen, now docked beside the motel. Also on display, for whatever reason, was the wooden Chris-Craft boat used in On Golden Pond. A gaping hole in the boat's bottom had resulted from Katharine Hepburn wrecking it, sending Henry Fonda flying off the bow.\n\nI passed through built-up Islamorada and eased onto Grassy Key, home of the Dolphin Research Center. In the 1950s a fisherman rescued a dolphin and brought her to Grassy Key for recovery. Mitzi, after recovery, made film history as Flipper in the 1963 black-and-white movie, and dolphin movies have been made at the center's holding pens ever since.\n\nI took the $9.50 tour to meet 12 dolphins, watch them perform and see how the fence nearest the gulf can be lowered to give the illusion of open water for movies. I also watched tourists have a Dolphin encounter, where for $90 one can swim and be pushed and pulled around by dolphins.\n\nThe Seven-Mile Bridge is a remnant of the ancient railroad that linked the Keys to the mainland. After a 1935 hurricane washed out the railroad, the Overseas Highway was built between 1936 and 1938 by laying I-beams over the trestles. The original bridge, relieved of automobile service in 1982, is still there for the use of joggers, bikers, anglers, Rollerbladers and, of course, Hollywood.\n\nAt mile 47, the eastern terminus of the bridge, I stopped at the Pigeon Key Visitors' Center. Housed in an old railroad car, the center is actually on Knight's Key (few things in the Keys are where the name presupposes). For filming the Arnold Schwarzenegger-Jamie Lee Curtis action movie True Lies on the old Seven-Mile Bridge, makeup and wardrobe trucks parked on Knight's Key for a month.\n\nA trolley runs from the center to Pigeon Key, two miles down the bridge, where former bridge tender buildings are being historically reconstructed. Five dollars gets you a two-way ride and admission to the island, but the walk is free and delightful. The bridge spans the meeting place of the gulf and the Atlantic, and gives the feeling of walking out to sea.\n\nIn a harrowing sequence in True Lies, Curtis is whisked from a driverless limousine by husband Schwarzenegger an instant before the car plunges off the blown-up bridge into the water. Though the moviemakers didn't really blow up the bridge, scorch marks are still visible on its surface from Hollywood explosives. The eastern end parking lot had to be resurfaced to support the Harrier planes which landed there in a movie sequence.\n\nLittle Palm Island is a lush, upscale resort three-and-a-half miles off Little Torch Key, at mile 28.5, in the Atlantic. A launch called Escape takes overnight guests and dining-only guests to Little Palm. In-season rates for one of the only 30 suites on the five-acre island run from $545 to $695 per night per suite.\n\nBecause of its South Seas appearance, Little Palm was selected by Warner Brothers for filming PT 109, based on John F. Kennedy's wartime experiences, in 1962. The island (officially called Little Munson Island) had been a fishing camp and vacation site for presidents Roosevelt and Truman. President Kennedy came down to watch the filming in 1962 and his father, Joseph Kennedy, suggested that cables for electricity be run to the island so the president wouldn't have to listen to a generator, and that's how electricity came to Little Palm.\n\nEver since Ernest Hemingway arrived in 1928, Key West has attracted world-class writers, such as Robert Frost and Tennessee Williams. The earliest film made on the island was an adaptation of a Williams play, The Rose Tattoo, and was shot at the playwright's house at 1431 Duncan St. The house is now privately owned.\n\nHemingway's home, behind a brick wall on Whitehead Street, played a prominent role in the 1989 James Bond movie License to Kill. At a meeting on the second-story balcony of the home, while tourists and six-toed cats meander about, Bond's license to kill is revoked by \"M.\" A rifle-carrying operative watches the action from atop the Key West Lighthouse, across Whitehead Street. Bond begins to turn over his weapon, saying, \"I guess it's, uh, a farewell to arms\" (get it?), but then leaps over the railing and drops 15 feet to the ground (this is Hollywood, remember) and disappears into the tropical foliage planted by Hemingway in the 1930s.\n\nThe Eden House was a simple tropical hotel at 1015 Fleming St. that was renovated in the late 1980s. Shortly thereafter, a film crew arrived, worked the place over to give it a seedy, rundown appearance, and shot the film Criss Cross with Goldie Hawn in 1990. The film, about a 12-year-old boy and a broken marriage and drug deals, has two confusing plots but brings out the underside of Key West life, with scenes of the public beaches and docks around town.\n\nAbout an hour before sunset, the island tilts slightly to the northwest as everyone heads down Duval Street to Mallory Square for the street celebration called Sunset. I thought I had run out of film sites on the Keys, but at 900 Duval, I veered into the Casablanca Hotel. Turns out that Bogie had been in the Keys after all, in 1937, and later the hotel where he stayed, and its bar where he drank (now Bogart's) were named after him.\n\nIf you go\n\nFinding film sites: Ever notice how many people stand and watch the final credits at movie's end in a theater? They aren't looking for the name of the third camera-person on the 2nd Unit, but to see where the film was made. Most states and cities have film commissions to work with filmmakers, and they often keep detailed records of where specific scenes were shot. Some of the fun, though, is finding the locations yourself. Two books, both necessarily incomplete, are good beginning points:\n\nRoadside Hollywood, by Jack Barth (Contemporary Books, 1991); and Shot On This Site, by William A. Gordon (Citadel Press, 1995).\n\nErnest J. Green is a freelance writer living in Potomac, Md."
