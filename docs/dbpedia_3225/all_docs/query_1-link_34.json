        "text": "Key West has some beautiful scenery as well as some outrageous places. We have history with old Conch houses, museums, Civil War forts, and a Navy Base. We also have modern buildings and great hangouts like Sloppy Joe’s. Not to mention amazing wildlife and sea life. Add the fact that the islands of the Florida Keys are surrounded by emerald waters, what a great backdrop to almost any film. And so, you would not be surprised to find that there have been many, many movies and a few television shows have been filmed in Key West and throughout the Florida Keys.\n\nHere are some of the more interesting stories of movies that were filmed on the islands, abbreviated of course.\n\nIn 1955, Key West resident Tennessee Williams talked Paramount Pictures into filming the movie version of his play, The Rose Tattoo, in Key West rather than in Mississippi which is was the actually setting of the play. The film starred Burt Lancaster and Italian actress Anna Magnani.\n\nIn 1959 director Blake Edwards filmed Operation Petticoat starring Tony Curtis, Carey Grant, and Janet Leigh. This film went on to be Universal Pictures’ biggest grossing film of the year that year.\n\nYears later, in 1993, Tony Curtis’ daughter Jamie Lee Curtis would come to the Florida Keys to film parts of True Lies, also starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tia Carrera, and Tom Arnold. While the actors stayed at the Pier House Resort in Key West while they were here filming, the scenes were actually shot in Marathon and Lower Sugarloaf Key.\n\nIn 1988, the James Bond film License to Kill starring Timothy Dalton, Benicio del Toro, and Cary Lowell was filmed here. Scenes for this movie were shot all over the island including Garrison Bight Marina, St. Mary’s Star of the Sea Church, and the Hemingway House. And one of the planes used in the film is still sitting in the Keys, parked right in front of the Sugarloaf Airport located at Mile Marker 17 on Lower Sugarloaf Key. I drive by this plane pretty much every day of my life and did not know until recently that it was a part of License to Kill.\n\nAnd speaking of the Sugarloaf Airport, Drop Zone starring Wesley Snipes was filmed in part here.\n\nHollywood returned to Key West in 1990 to film Criss Cross which starred Goldie Hawn, Arliss Howard, Keith Carradine, and Steve Buscemi. Most of the filming was done at the Eden House which is where the real life woman the story was based on lived with her son, Chris back in the 1970s.\n\nAnd here is a more accurate, chronological list of filming done in the Florida Keys taken from the Florida Keys and Key West Film Commission and IMDb.\n\n1912 – Oversea Celebration\n\n1912 – Key West Celebration\n\n1940 – Island City Republic (March of Time)\n\n1942 – Reap the Wild Wind\n\n1948 – Key Largo\n\n1951 – The Frogmen\n\n1953 – Hurricane Hunters\n\n1954 – Beneath the Twelve Mile Reef\n\n1954 – Rose Tattoo\n\n1956 – Carib Gold\n\n1959 – Operation Petticoat\n\n1960 – All Fall Down\n\n1962 – PT 109\n\n1963 – Escape from Hell Island\n\n1973 – Key West\n\n1974 – 92 in the Shade\n\n1976 – Gums\n\n1976 – Mako: There Jaws of Death\n\n1978 – Hunters on the Reef\n\n1979 – Butterflies in Heat\n\n1979 – Cuba Crossing\n\n1979 – The Last Resort\n\n1979 – The Final Countdown\n\n1981 – Against the Wind and Tide: A Cuban Odyssey\n\n1984 – Devil Fish\n\n1985 – Running Scared\n\n1986 – Blue City\n\n1986 – Russkies\n\n1988 – License to Kill\n\n1989 – Cops (TV series)\n\n1989 – Route One USA\n\n1990 – Havana\n\n1991-92 – Criss-Cross\n\n1992 – The Real World (TV Series)\n\n1992-93 – Matinee\n\n1993 – True Lies\n\n1993 – Key West (TV Series)\n\n1994 – Drop Zone\n\n1994 – Fantasies of the Stars (TV Special)\n\n1994 – Tollbooth\n\n1995 – Up Close and Personal\n\n1995 – Blood & Wine\n\n1995 – Executive Decision\n\n1995 – Cruel Jaws\n\n1996 – Zeus and Roxanne\n\n1996 – Spanish Prisoner\n\n1996 – Speed 2\n\n1996 – Blind Swimmer Completes Key West Marathon\n\n1997 – Assault on Devil’s Island\n\n1997 – The Spanish Prisoner\n\n1997 – Tomorrow Never Dies\n\n1997 – Murder of Crows\n\n1998 – Office Space\n\n1998 – Dance of the Dolphins\n\n1998 – Nawa Shibari: Rope Art\n\n1999 – This Old House (TV Episode)\n\n2000 – The Crew\n\n2000 – Heartbreakers\n\n2000 – Say What?
