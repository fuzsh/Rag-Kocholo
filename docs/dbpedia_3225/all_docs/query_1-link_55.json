        "text": "Baker’s Cay Resort in Key Largo, Florida makes for an amazing wedding venue. From the ocean views to the beautiful resort, everything about this resort is perfect for a wedding. And Logan and Isabelle sure had a perfectly beautiful wedding day.\n\nThe Resort\n\nBaker’s Cay Resort is one of the most beautiful resorts I have seen. The minimalistic, modern look really makes it unique. There are many different picturesque places in and around the resort. The main entrance, the sides of the building, the gardens, the beaches, and more!\n\nAlong with being a beautiful resort, there are plenty of rooms for your guests to stay! The resort also has pet friendly rooms, a huge bonus! There are two different restaurants on the resort along with a couple bars. The resort is also kid friendly! While capturing the day, we saw a few different families with young children. There are many perks to having your wedding at Baker’s Cay Resort in Key Largo, Florida.\n\nHammock Beach\n\nAt Baker’s Cay Resort, there are a ton of different locations for weddings. Indoor and outdoor. Isabelle and Logan chose to get married on Hammock Beach. It is a beach on the corner of the resort that get’s blocked off which makes it pretty private. It is a gorgeous location on the resort to get married at. The white sand with the ocean in the background make it picture perfect. Also, can we talk about how GORGEOUS the florals done by Bride Candy are? WOW! I was in awe! These guys absolutely crushed it in the floral department.\n\nCay View North Ballroom\n\nLogan and Isabelle held their reception in the Cay View Ballroom. It was perfect for their guests to enjoy cocktail hour on the patio and then move inside for dinner and dancing. Overall, the room hold approximately 160 people. This ballroom also has gorgeous views over looking the ocean on one side and main beach of the resort on the other. Such a perfect location for a reception. Huge shout out to Julia Timmins with Blue Water Weddings for setting up the most beautiful decorations!\n\nLogan + Isabelle – Key Largo Wedding\n\nThe day was absolutely perfect. From the details to ceremony, everything was drop dead gorgeous. Logan and Isabelle are two gems that have the biggest hearts. The chose Florida for their wedding location because of family. And if that doesn’t show the type of people they are, I am not sure what does. Their wedding guests consisted of all family, so it was a very special and intimate wedding day.\n\nEverything flowed so smoothly on their big day. Which a lot of timing and planning was thanks to Julia Timmins with Blue Water Weddings. She was such a great wedding planner. From pre-wedding meetings with the couple and I for timeline to setting up all decor for the wedding, she rocked it all. Having everything in one location helps with this a ton. Everyone is in one place the entire day and makes everyone accessible when they are needed.\n\nLogan and Isabelle’s Key Largo wedding was nothing short of perfect.\n\nPlanner: Julia Timmins with Blue Water Weddings\n\nOfficiant: Pastor Tony Hammon\n\nFlorist: Bride Candy\n\nDress: Lovely Bride in Denver\n\nGroom’s attire: J.H. & Sons in Sioux Falls\n\nBride’s ring & band: Greenberg’s in Sioux Falls\n\nGroom’s ring: Gentlemen’s Junction\n\nHair: Mel Serrano with Beauty and the Beach\n\nMakeup: Alexis Smith\n\nVideographer: Hailey Jean Films\n\nPhotographer: Sydney Leigh\n\nCake: Maggie’s Bakery in Key Largo, FL\n\nDj: DJ Maynor\n\nSignage: The Basic Birch Co.\n\nRentals: Nuage Design"
