        "text": "UPDATE: Playa Largo has been rated one of the best resorts in Florida. See here.\n\nWow!\n\nNancy and I went to Key West via an afternoon flight to Ft. Lauderdale. Now, Ft. Lauderdale is a long drive from Key West, but we chose that route rather than a direct flight so that (a) we could see our good friends Bob Leland and Vicki Doff in Delray on the way back, and (b) so we could save a boatload of money. As we had a late afternoon flight, we’d have to spend the night on the way to Key West.\n\nAfter sedulous research (seven minutes checking the Marriott/Bonvoy website), I hit on the Playa Largo Resort and Spa. After decades of travel, I have, or used to have, an abundance of Marriott points, with enough stays that I have achieved Lifetime Titanium status — equivalent to a very minor demi-god. (Brand loyalty pays off.)\n\nI had the option of either spending some of my Marriott points — about two nights worth at an inland Residence Inn for the one night at Playa Largo — or $1,900 dollars and change for the night. I chose the points, and chose the hotel in part to see what sort of room and services that prompt people to spend over $1,900 for a night in a hotel room.\n\nNancy and I arrived and were greeted by a very friendly fellow at the gate, and by even friendlier people at the front desk, whose friendliness extended to a complementary glass of rum punch. We were upgraded from an ordinary room to a Bay Front King Suite — a very sweet suite indeed. There was a large foyer, a very large (12 x 12 bathroom), a larger bedroom, and a large sitting room off which was a water-view balcony and a table for four.\n\nI think the whole thing was about 900 square feet, and oh, was it nice.\n\nIt was dinner time, so we went to check out the three on-site restaurants — Las Olas, a roomy bar with lounge seating (i.e., with comfortable chairs and couches for sitting but only coffee tables on which to eat), La Marea, a nice indoor/outdoor restaurant with a full menu and full tables, and a casual seafood-focused restaurant, Sol by the Sea. We decided we Better Call Sol.\n\nSol by the Sea has three levels of seating. There is a large upper level overlooking the Gulf, a level on the beach itself, and a level with tables set in the water.\n\nBeing unfamiliar with the tides, we chose the upper deck. Good choice. We could see the Gulf, the lights of boats and houses, and fireworks in the distance. It’s a large space, open to the breezes, with a very high peaked ceiling, all in wood and thatch.\n\nAn attractive duo — an older man and a young woman — played and sang mostly Latin music, and they did so very well. It reinforced the languid mood.\n\nNancy and I sat down and tried to access the QR code menu. No luck. We should have connected to the internet inside the hotel. A problem at Playa Largo is no problem. The head waiter left his personal iPhone with the QR code accessed for us to study the menu.\n\nNancy ordered a Caesar salad topped with blackened grouper instead of anchovies.\n\nThe grouper was fresh and the salad, also very fresh, wasn’t overdressed. Nancy was pleased.\n\nI ordered a blackened grouper sandwich.\n\nSee that slice of tomato? It was a revelation, a real tomato. A real tomato in late December. I felt like I’d hit the lottery. And the grouper was very good, too. It came with a large serving of mango slaw featuring touches of radicchio and red and yellow bell pepper, and dressed with a light touch of vinegar and a little sweetness.\n\nI also had ordered, upon sitting down, a Hop City IPA, which after careful analysis, I would describe as okay. With dinner I switched to a very good, very dependable, Cigar City Jai Alai.\n\nIt was a very good dinner, just what we needed. We walked around the grounds for a while — the spacious pool area, the pier, a park with a snow machine; and the Playa Largo interior, with separate play rooms for younger and older children, a large gym with a view of the water, and a spa. Then back to our room for a great night’s sleep.\n\nWe rose and went to La Marea for our complimentary breakfast. There was an omelet station and large hot and cold buffet. Since I was in the gap between the Extended Holiday Over-Eating Season and a Key West Vacation Over-Eating Season, I departed from form and chose with unaccustomed wisdom.\n\nThe fruit was excellent. How often do you get a hotel buffet fruit that actually has flavor? About as often as you get a real tomato in December. It was a nice light breakfast. And, yes, with a pastry … for balance.\n\nWe both enjoyed the breakfast, and when I went back afterwards to get the hat that I’d left at the table, the staff was there waiting for me, hat in hand. Nancy and I did another walk around the property, this time to include a series of stand-alone houses with their own beach club. We left reluctantly, lured by the prospect of seeing granddaughters Ella and Lily. Oh, and their parents, Liza and Michael, and Michael’s parents, David and Sue Boyd, and the promise of adventure and misadventure in Key West.\n\nI don’t know that I’ll get back to Playa Largo. Our mountain of Marriott/Bonvoy points is now a relative molehill, and I haven’t hit the lottery recently. And I’m unlikely to hit it because I never buy lottery tickets. But if I do hit it, I’ll head straight to Playa Largo as soon as winter intrudes. If you can, go to Playa Largo, and sit in the lap of luxury.\n\n***"
