        "text": "2015\n\nCity Locations\n\nIslamorada, Florida, USA\n\nLocation Types\n\nAmerican, Beach/Oceanview, Cabins, Naturescapes, Restaurant\n\nLocation Styles\n\nBeachfront, Boat Style, Cabin, Tropical, Sail\n\nAbout Bloodline\n\nBloodline is a Netflix original series brought to us by the creators of Orange Is the New Black and House of Cards. The series revolves around the lives of the Rayburn clan and their day-to-day goings on.\n\nWe have Ray Rayburn, daddy dearest, and the matriarch with his wife Sally Rayburn, who champions Danny. The siblings, on the other hand, John, Meg, and Kevin donât share the same sentiment and are cold towards him.\n\nThe Rayburns are a wealthy lot, living in the Florida Keys in their stunning beach view home when the family's black sheep, their oldest son Danny, makes an appearance out of the blue after years of estrangement. Heâs right on time for the 45th anniversary celebration of his parents.\n\nThe whole family is skeptical of his return and wants him to leave but Danny is here to stay for good. He looks like a changed man ready to right the wrongs, and start with a clean slate.\n\nIt is later revealed in the series the reason why everyone is cold towards Danny, an accident that still haunts the family to this day. His dysfunctional relationship with his family stems from the death of his younger sister Sarah as his family blames him for her death.\n\nAs Danny is forced to leave, he confronts his dad one last time which causes Robert to have mini-strokes, resulting in his untimely death. Danny now has a spot open; he takes Robertsâs place in running the familyâs inn. However, not everything is all sunshine and rainbows as Danny is hiding a dangerous secret that could tear the family apart once again.\n\nFollow the lies, deceit, and murder in this dark and corrupt family where you will be left questioning who is right and who is wrong. When blood does not run thicker than water, and a brother murders his own brother, see what a family is reduced to.\n\nBloodline uncovers all that and much more in this trickery, intrigue, and drama powerhouse. After all, they are not bad people, but they did a bad thing.\n\nBloodline Locations\n\nBloodline is family-drama series that takes place in Islamorada, Florida. It was the perfect location to film the lavish and glamorous lives of the Rayburns who have spent their whole life on the keys of Florida where the vast shoreline is surrounded by the ocean on one side and the gulf on the other. During the start of season 1, we are treated to the perfect lives of the Rayburns, who enjoy celebrity status in the local community and throw grand parties and go yachting in the ocean.\n\nThe whole scenery is synonymous with Rayburns. The producer Todd A. Kessler described the Florida Keys as âa place not quite like others and the color of the water and being outside. It really feels like paradise and then having this kind of underbelly of whatâs going on underneath itâ.\n\nThe whole series is shot in a hyper-realistic, documentary style, which allows viewers to see the whole actors as real-life characters. Plus, it allows for an immersive experience of the exotic filming location of Bloodline.\n\nAfter watching the series, we felt compelled to write an article on the best scenes in Bloodline (spoiler alert) and the location where each of these scenes was shot so that you as a fan of the series can easily visit the area and sightsee with your own eyes!\n\nIronically it was in this season one scene where we see Robert Raburn make a toast to his wife and children about how good their life has been. They are just celebrating the 45th anniversary of their seaside hotel when Danny, the estranged son returns home.\n\nIn this scene, Robert makes a speech in which he says, âI would like to say a few words about my kids, there is Meg, my sunshine. There is Kevin my youngest son and of course, thereâs John who takes care of the whole damn Island.â\n\nIn this scene, the Rayburn family is about to inaugurate a pier close to the restaurant and dedicate it to Robert and Sally. It is a beautiful location to spend vacations with your loved ones. The pier is very close to the Rayburn House and can be reached by foot. Surround yourself with corals, mangroves, and tons of palm trees!\n\nCoral Gables Filming Locations Tour\n\nLetâs go to season one. John, Meg, and Kevin find out that Danny is smuggling drugs and stashing cocaine in the familyâs inn, which he uses as a front. All three siblings discuss and conclude that in order to protect the family business and name from the feds they need to pack up the stash and move it to Dannyâs home, which is situated in Miami.\n\nThe family thinks if the feds bust the whole plot, Danny is the one going down, not the family or the inn. However, when Lowry the drug dealer finds out that Danny lost his cocaine, he hires a hitman to kill him, who ends up getting killed by Danny instead.\n\nTheir mother Sally asks the siblings to sit and have a chat about what is actually going on. Danny confesses that he needed money, so he ended up doing business with some bad guys. Now, he deals and sells drugs and was using the family inn as a warehouse.\n\nIt is one of the main scenes of season 1 as Danny finally lets go of the resentment and hate he had for his family when they lied about his abuse during his teenage years. He delivers some chilling lines here, âI never felt safe in this house, and now none of you are safe in this houseâ. We clearly see how disturbed Danny still is about his past and that he wonât let go.\n\nThis Bloodline film scene takes place in the Rayburn House which in real life is a hotel known as The Moorings Village Spa, right on the beachy shores of the Florida Keys. However, the bad news is that the hotel charges a whooping USD 465 for a nightâs stay. And the minimum limit for a stay is only 2 nights! It is a gorgeous place though.\n\nMiami Filming Locations Search\n\nDanny is trying to get in his motherâs good graces. We see him managing the family inn remarkably well. He takes responsibility after the death of his father. While trying to project a good image, he takes the guests snorkeling and exploring on the family boat.\n\nThis was one of those scenes where we might think that Danny has some redeeming qualities but they are later on shattered!\n\nThe place he takes them to sightsee is a gorgeous underwater piece of paradise that can be easily visited by tourists. We see him take these guests to the iconic and famous âChrist of the Abyssâ statue which is situated underwater deep in the sea, Key Largo. It is situated 25 feet deep off the coast of Key Largo and is surrounded by stunning wildlife and corals.\n\nThe state park where the statue was lowered is one of the first underwater state parks in the USA. Whenever you visit the Bloodline filming locations visit this statue as well, and donât forget to have your photo taken! Set a guided trip with local guides and visit soon!\n\nMiami Production Spaces Exploration\n\nSeason 1 ends with a bang after all the twists and turns. The drama finally boils down to the rift between Danny and John, who have a deep-seated silent animosity toward each other.\n\nIn this scene, we see John confront Danny, he warns Danny of the looming DEA investigation and tries to ask about the cryptic threat Danny made to his daughter.\n\nEarlier in the scene, Danny gave a seahorse necklace to Johnâs daughter while they went sailing. It was the same necklace worn by Sarah, the dead sibling. John loses it when he sees the seahorse necklace. Just as Danny turns to leave John grabs a wooden log and hits Danny. They both go tumbling down and start sparring. John keeps on yelling, âWhen is it going to endâ to which Danny simply laughs manically knowing that he had succeeded in shattering the faÃ§ade of Johnâs perfect life once and for all.\n\nThe thousand-yard stare of John when he's sitting on the beach and Danny's body lying face down in 6 inches of water was so brutal. Finally, the sibling rivalry came to an end, but at what cost!\n\nThe family now is truly shattered, as John comes to grips with the fact that he killed his brother. This scene was painful to watch. While some might disagree and say Danny got what he deserved, what we think is that they should not have killed him so early on.\n\nDanny was the only character with a good arc and was the backbone of the series. Killing him so early just did not make sense.\n\nThis major Bloodline action scene takes place on the isolated strip of sand that belongs to Long Key State Park in real life. It is a 980-acre beach park that has all the amenities to make your visit memorable. They offer swimming, fishing, and snorkeling, as well as a paddling trail through coastal lagoons!\n\nLocate Filming Locations"
