The majority of these birds have been conditioned to be tolerant of humans as they perch, feed, walk and fly. The Sanctuary and Rehabilitation Center is open from sunrise to sunset 365 days per year.\n\n7. African Queen Canal Cruise\n\nTake a trip on the iconic boat seen in the famous 1951 Humphrey Bogart/Katherine Hepburn film The African Queen!

The African Queen can be rented for private events and cruising the canals of the Port Largo area.\n\n8. Bamboo Charters\n\nCaptain Matt Bellinger is the owner and operator of Bamboo Charters, offering some of the best fishing in and around the Florida Keys. Ever since his marine biology studies at the University of Tampa, Bellinger has been entranced with the laid-back way of life in the Florida Keys. His father and grandfather taught him how to fish, and today, Bellinger knows the waters of the Keys and the Everglades National Park better than almost anyone. His charters can be booked online, and Bellinger also offers a live fishing report that airs daily on three Keys radio stations.\n\n9. John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park\n\nJohn Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park was the first park in the United States to incorporate extensive undersea areas, including spectacular coral reefs. Encompassing some 70 nautical square miles, the park includes mangrove swamps and upland areas with tropical hammocks. But the park’s real beauty can be found underwater; visitors can get a glimpse of these sights by snorkeling, scuba-diving or riding in the glass-bottom boat that plies the park’s waters. Additionally, the park allows picnicking, swimming, hiking, canoeing, kayaking and fishing, and there’s a 30,000-gallon saltwater aquarium and a theater with nature videos in its Visitor Center."
