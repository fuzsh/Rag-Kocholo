        "text": "Introduction\n\nRight, let’s get this monster of a post started – with my carefully researched guide to the Bloodline filming locations. First of all, a few things to note – if you haven’t watched Bloodline on Netflix, then what on earth is wrong with you?\n\nIt’s one of the best thriller series in years and will keep you guessing right up to the final scene.\n\nThe trailer should help convince you:\n\n“We’re not bad people, but we did a bad thing.” Hmm, I reckon he’s only half right there…\n\nClearly a scene-by-scene guide is going to contain spoilers – that would be an understatement. So if you have somehow missed out on Bloodline, remedy that now and come back here in 13 episodes’ time.\n\nStill with me? Good. You’re either a fan like the rest of us or have the memory of a goldfish and are expecting to have forgotten everything you learn here by the time you start watching the series.\n\nI’m going to assume you’re a fan. Actually I’ve yet to meet anyone yet who watched Bloodline and didn’t love it, so the odds are in my favour.\n\nSo, where was Bloodline filmed?\n\nIt’s often said that the Florida Keys is as much a star of Bloodline as any member of the cast, and there is a lot of truth in that. A few locals have taken issue with some aspects of the way their home is portrayed (ranging from understandably disliking the human trafficking and narcotics trade storylines to complaining about the Keys being shown as a constantly sweltering beach destination.)\n\nBut in general, tourism has received a huge boost from the Netflix show. And unlike some TV series set in Florida but mostly filmed elsewhere (step forward, Dexter…) the Bloodline Filming Locations are real ones that fans can visit – which gave me the inspiration for this article.\n\nIt wasn’t always easy. I spent countless hours carrying out online research, poring over Google Maps and trying to obtain clues from pausing the episode and searching satellite imagery for a match.\n\nI had to deal with incorrect information (one blogger confusing the Whistle Stop bar with the Ocean View pub – I mean really!) and some creative license by the film crew, but with a few exceptions I was able to find almost every location used in the first season.\n\nLuck also played a part – there were at least two places for which zero information was available online, but I found on Google Earth purely by chance.\n\nI’ve included those Bloodline filming locations which I couldn’t find and would love to hear from you if you can shed any light on those I missed. And if you find any mistakes, please let me know.\n\nBloodline Filming Locations: Exploring the Florida Keys\n\nI didn’t bother with the few scenes shot in Miami as the intention was to focus on the Florida Keys, and also omitted those in which it was impossible to determine the location. Places are obviously used many times in the series and are only included the first time they appear.\n\nMost of the action takes place in Islamorada and nearby parts of the Middle and Upper Keys. As you know I visited the area in January this year and I can also tell you that I will be returning with my family at Christmas – at which time I will be attempting to visit each location and any additional ones from the second season.\n\nI have included links to relevant articles on the site as well as to the locations themselves where appropriate. All images and video is credited – the still images from the series are screenshots directly from my Mac and are published in accordance with the “Fair Use” legal interpretation for copyrighted material. Netflix obviously owns the rights to the series, images and video.\n\nI have indicated the run times for each episode as well as the start time and time remaining for each scene. These are as exact as possible and I included both markers because the Netflix app displays different information depending on the device used – on the PC, Mac and iPad app I only see the time remaining, whereas on the PlayStation 3 version I see the time elapsed.\n\nI think that’s all you need to know – we’ve got a lot to get through so let’s get cracking…\n\nThe Episodes\n\nThe Overseas Highway – The Jugular Vein of Bloodline Filming Locations\n\nPart 1 – Runtime 59:30:00\n\nElapsed time: 1:26\n\nRemaining time: 58:04\n\nDescription: The show opens with a beautiful aerial shot of a bus driving the Overseas Highway which runs all the way through the Florida Keys to Key West.\n\nLocation: The section shown is Cross Key before the road swings ninety degrees into Key Largo.\n\nElapsed time: 02:39\n\nRemaining time: 56:51\n\nDescription: Kevin’s boatyard\n\nLocation: No amount of research revealed any clue about one of the most important scenes in Bloodline, but I found it by accident on Google Earth. “Ocean Key Marina” is in fact Coral Bay Marina right in the middle of Islamorada. There is little evidence from this scene, but it will become clear later…\n\nElapsed time: 03:14\n\nRemaining time: 56:15\n\nDescription: The Rayburn House\n\nLocation: Not only is the actual place real, it actually is a hotel. The bad news is that it is a (justifiably) very expensive one. If you are feeling flush, you can stay at The Moorings Village and Spa where rates start at USD 465 a night and there is a minimum stay of 2 nights.\n\nIf you really want the Bloodline experience you can rent the entire two-storey house that served as the Rayburn family residence for the tidy sum of USD 2500 per night…\n\nAlternatively, visit the beach bar at the resort which also featured in the show.\n\nElapsed time: 07:48\n\nRemaining time: 51:42\n\nDescription: Bus ticket booth\n\nLocation: The building exists, and is located right next to Alabama Jack’s (see below). You won’t be able to buy bus tickets, though. It looks like this place was dressed by the set designers as Google Earth reveals it to be no more than a plain shack.\n\nElapsed time: 08:04\n\nRemaining time: 51:26\n\nDescription: Islamorada bus stop\n\nLocation: John waits for his brother by Abel’s Tackle Box in Islamorada.\n\nElapsed time: 09:29\n\nRemaining time: 50:01\n\nDescription: Bar where Danny buys week-old fish tacos\n\nLocation: Alabama Jack’s is a real bar but they are famous for their excellent conch fritters. The nasty tacos were artistic license…\n\nElapsed time: 11:00\n\nRemaining time: 48:30\n\nDescription: Islamorada bus stop\n\nLocation: Abel’s Tackle Box\n\nI included this again to point out one of the few continuity errors in the show. The picture above shows the first bus arriving.\n\nThe one above here shows the second, later bus arriving. Notice anything? 🙂\n\nElapsed time: 11:21\n\nRemaining time: 48:09\n\nDescription: Danny and Eric smoking in boat\n\nLocation: Robbie’s of Islamorada\n\nElapsed time: 35:14\n\nRemaining time: 24.16\n\nDescription: Searching the mangrove swamps\n\nLocation: Robbie’s of Islamorada\n\nElapsed time: 43:56\n\nRemaining time: 15.34\n\nDescription: Beach bar\n\nLocation: Oceanview Pub and Inn, Islamorada\n\nPart 2 – Runtime 51:02:00\n\nElapsed time: 06:11\n\nRemaining time: 44:51\n\nDescription: Kevin’s boatyard\n\nLocation: Coral Bay Marina, Islamorada\n\nElapsed time: 10:22\n\nRemaining time: 40:40\n\nDescription: Aerial shot\n\nLocation: Wahoo’s Bar and Grill, Islamorada\n\nElapsed time: 13:35\n\nRemaining time: 37:27\n\nDescription: Out kayaking, Robert Rayburn comes across his son Danny standing on the beach\n\nLocation: Anne’s Beach, Islamorada\n\nElapsed time: 14:56\n\nRemaining time: 36.06\n\nDescription: Family gathers at hospital where Robert has been admitted\n\nLocation: Mariners Hospital, Tavernier. It is not clear from any of the scenes in the series but I found out that this was indeed the place it was shot.\n\nElapsed time: 23:10\n\nRemaining time: 27:52\n\nDescription: Eric calls Danny from dock\n\nLocation: It’s almost impossible to tell for sure, but it seems like this short scene was filmed at Robbie’s of Islamorada again.\n\nElapsed time:\n\nRemaining time: 22.20\n\nDescription: Kevin’s boatyard\n\nLocation: Coral Bay Marina, Islamorada\n\nPart 3 – Runtime 59:09:00\n\nElapsed time: 16:20\n\nRemaining time: 42:50\n\nDescription: “PostNmail” store\n\nLocation: Thanks to reader Jim Marshall for this and many other nuggets of information. This is the current PostNet store right across the street from Marker 88 restaurant.\n\nElapsed time: 25:05\n\nRemaining time: 34:05\n\nDescription: Danny and Meg drinking in bar, pool being played in background\n\nLocation: Caribbean Club, Key Largo\n\nElapsed time: 30:52\n\nRemaining time: 28:18\n\nDescription: Danny takes guest snorkelling\n\nLocation: Christ of the Abyss statue, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park\n\nElapsed time: 44:28\n\nRemaining time: 14.42\n\nDescription: Danny and Chelsea playing pool in bar\n\nLocation: Caribbean Club, Key Largo\n\nPart 4 – Runtime 53:03:00\n\nElapsed time: 04:17\n\nRemaining time: 48:46\n\nDescription: Kevin’s boatyard\n\nLocation: Coral Bay Marina, Islamorada\n\nElapsed time: 15:47\n\nRemaining time: 37:16\n\nDescription: Family watching baseball game\n\nLocation: Founder’s Park, Islamorada\n\nElapsed time: 35:02\n\nRemaining time: 18:01\n\nDescription: Fisherman finds second body\n\nLocation: Bridge turn-off to Anchorage Resort and Yacht Club\n\nElapsed time:\n\nRemaining time: 08.21\n\nDescription: Aerial above Overseas Highway\n\nLocation: Over Whistle Stop bar, Islamorada\n\nElapsed time: 45:53\n\nRemaining time: 07.10\n\nDescription: Danny and Robert talking in bar\n\nLocation: Marker 88 restaurant, Islamorada\n\nPart 5 – Runtime 54:46:00\n\nElapsed time: 08:58\n\nRemaining time: 45:48\n\nDescription: Aerial above Overseas Highway\n\nLocation: Again this was shot over the Whistle Stop, but this time flying south.\n\nElapsed time: 12:26\n\nRemaining time: 42:20\n\nDescription: Danny meets Chelsea in cafe\n\nLocation: Mangrove Mike’s. I highly recommend visiting this place, whether or not you are searching for the Bloodline filming locations.\n\nElapsed time: 38:22\n\nRemaining time: 16:24\n\nDescription: Danny, Chelsea and Eric at bar, Kevin, Meg and Marco at table\n\nLocation: Caribbean Club, Key Largo\n\nElapsed time: 47:21\n\nRemaining time: 07.25\n\nDescription: Aerial above Overseas Highway\n\nLocation: This shows Craig Key Bend\n\nPart 6 – Runtime 57:58:00\n\nElapsed time: 06:11\n\nRemaining time: 51:47\n\nDescription: Lenny on docks\n\nLocation: At first I couldn’t find this one. I found the company running the boat in the background but their tours don’t start from the dock shown, so it is presumable somewhere on their route. Then reader John tipped me off that this is probably the Holiday Isle Marina, which makes sense as this was also used in another scene.
