        "text": "Over a century of filmmaking in our state, Florida has experienced all the highs and lows. It’s created Best Picture Oscar winners “The Greatest Show on Earth” and “Moonlight,” and box-office hits ranging from Ron Howard’s family-friendly films to the raunchy “Porky’s.” It’s also resulted in some movies regularly considered among the worst ever, such as “American Idol” spin-off “From Justin to Kelly.”\n\nYet if you look at our overall cinematic track record, you’ll find plenty for us to be proud of. Here are 20 essential films set and/or shot primarily in Florida. Note: this excludes such classics as “Citizen Kane,” “The Godfather Part II” and “Goodfellas,” which have scenes in the Sunshine State but mainly take place elsewhere.\n\n“Apollo 13″ (1995)\n\nFilmed on location, at least partially, at Kennedy Space Center, “Apollo 13″ is Ron Howard’s gripping retelling of the near-disastrous 1970 attempt by NASA to return to the moon. Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan all turn in memorable performances, with Harris and Quinlan earning Oscar nominations. — Wade Tatangelo\n\n“The Birdcage” (1996)\n\nSouth Beach serves as the setting for director Mike Nichols’ and screenwriter Elaine May’s blockbuster remake of the Franco-Italian comedy “La Cage aux Folles.” The inspired casting finds Robin Williams and Nathan Lane playing a gay couple trying to pass themselves off as straight for the benefit of their son. One of the funniest films of the ’90s, “The Birdcage” was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award. — WT\n\n“Body Heat” (1981)\n\nLargely shot in Palm Beach County and set during a fierce Florida heatwave, “Body Heat” is a “Double Indemnity”-inspired serving of neo-noir mastery starring Kathleen Turner as the femme fatale who wants her husband murdered by her lover (William Hurt). The film marks the directorial debut of Lawrence Kasdan, who was born in Miami. — WT\n\n“Caddyshack” (1980)\n\nOne of the most hilarious and quotable movies ever made, Harold Ramis’ slobs-versus-snobs classic “Caddyshack” — featuring killer comedic performances by Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray — filmed its golf scenes at Rolling Hills Golf Club (now the Grande Oaks Golf Club) in Broward County, with the dinner scene shot at the Boca Raton Resort & Club. — WT\n\n“Cocoon” (1985)\n\nWhile St. Petersburg’s reputation as “God’s waiting room” didn’t get any help from this film, Ron Howard’s “Cocoon” remains a heartwarming sci-fi fantasy featuring an all-star cast including Don Ameche, who won an Oscar. The film spawned the 1988 sequel “Cocoon: The Return” (with filming in Miami), while Howard returned to Florida for the hit 1989 comedy “Parenthood,” largely filmed around Orlando, and “Apollo 13.” — WT\n\n“Cool Hand Luke” (1967)\n\nSet and partially shot in the Sunshine State — it’s based on a book by safecracker Donn Pearce, who did a couple years in the Florida Department of Corrections chain gangs after being arrested in 1949 — “Cool Hand Luke” stands out in the prison movie genre thanks to a tour-de-force performance by Paul Newman, whose endearingly boyish smirk and those disarming blue eyes are perfect for bringing to life the vision of inmate Lucas “Luke” Jackson. — WT\n\n“Edward Scissorhands” (1990)\n\nPasco County served as the pastel-colored backdrop for this Tim Burton film about a scissor-handed outcast clad in all black (Johnny Depp) who suddenly moves to the suburbs. If not quite Burton’s best film, “Edward Scissorhands” may be his definitive misfit toy protagonist. It also marks the final onscreen film appearance of Burton’s idol, Vincent Price. — Jimmy Geurts\n\n“The Florida Project” (2017)\n\nSean Baker’s film follows an impoverished community living in a motel on the outskirts of Walt Disney World, chronicling their struggles honestly but sympathetically. Along with some excellent child performances, it features a wonderfully warm turn by Willem Dafoe as the hotel manager, earning a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. — JG\n\n“The Greatest Show on Earth” (1952)\n\nCecil B. DeMille’s 150-minute circus epic, largely filmed in Ringling Bros.’ winter quarters of Sarasota, is often considered one of the lesser Best Picture Oscar winners. Yet that’s largely because it beat out classics like “High Noon” and “The Quiet Man.” On its own merits, it’s frequently dazzling with an engaging cast, if occasionally overstuffed and overwhelming — not unlike the circus itself. — JG\n\n“The Heartbreak Kid” (1972)\n\nThis Elaine May-directed, Neil Simon-scripted comedy stars Charles Grodin as a newlywed who has second thoughts about his wife (an Oscar-nominated Jeannie Berlin) when he meets another woman (Cybill Shepherd) on his Miami Beach honeymoon. Funny and existentially bleak in equal measure, the film makes a fine companion piece with “The Graduate,” by May’s former comedy team acting partner Mike Nichols. — JG\n\n“Key Largo” (1948)\n\nFeaturing exterior shots filmed in the Florida Keys, John Huston’s film noir classic “Key Largo” finds Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall’s characters trapped in a hotel by gangsters (Edward G. Robinson plays the nefarious ringleader), with the very real threat of an encroaching hurricane. Claire Trevor, who plays an alcoholic singer, won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. — WT\n\n“Magic Mike” (2012)\n\nBased on Channing Tatum’s time as a male stripper while living in Tampa, “Magic Mike” proves to be more than just beefcake eye candy (though there’s plenty of that, too.) That’s thanks to the assured direction of Steven Soderbergh and a great cast that includes what may be Matthew McConaughey’s best performance of his 2010s “McConaissance” era. — JG\n\n“Moonlight” (2016)\n\nBarry Jenkins’ drama following a black man from Miami’s Liberty City neighborhood during three stages of his life took home the Best Picture Oscar in a historic surprise win, and was recently named the best film of the 2010s by IndieWire. It’s a deserving choice in both categories, combining life’s harsh realities with an aching romantic lushness, especially in its third act. — JG\n\n“Night Moves” (1975)\n\nGene Hackman followed “The Conversation” with another neo-noir, this one about a private eye who travels to the Florida Keys to find a missing teenage girl and uncovers a much greater conspiracy. Don’t let the sunny setting fool you — “Night Moves” is as paranoid and despairing as any great ’70s thriller, with a particularly haunting final image. — JG\n\n“Out of Sight” (1998)\n\nBased on author Elmore Leonard’s crime novel of the same name, “Out of Sight” stars George Clooney as a bank robber who busts out of a Sunshine State prison and falls in love with a U.S. Marshal played by Jennifer Lopez. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, it’s one of the wittiest, sexiest and often funniest gangster movies of recent decades. — WT\n\n“The Palm Beach Story” (1942)\n\nPreston Sturges’ screwball comedy starred Claudette Colbert as a woman with a financially strapped husband (Joel McCrea) who heads to Palm Beach in hopes of getting a divorce and her marrying a Florida millionaire. The film is an inspired blend of the down-to-earth and absurdist, building to a downright bizarre twist ending. — JG\n\n“Scarface” (1983)\n\nMiami has never looked quite so eerily exotic or vicious as it does in Brian De Palma’s ultra-violent gangster epic, scripted by Oliver Stone, about a Cuban immigrant (Al Pacino) determined to realize the American dream by any means necessary. In addition to Pacino’s awesomely over-the-top portrayal of Tony Montana, there are also strong, star-making performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. — WT\n\n“Spring Breakers” (2013)\n\nIndie film provocateur Harmony Korine got his biggest budget and stars to date for this St. Petersburg and Sarasota-shot crime drama, and the results were surprisingly invigorating: a surrealistic collage of bright-colored bikinis, beer, bongs and bullets. It also features perhaps James Franco’s finest performance as drug dealer and rapper Alien. — JG\n\n“The Truman Show” (1998)\n\nIn “The Truman Show,” the Florida Panhandle master-planned community of Seaside plays the part of the town where Truman (Jim Carrey) has unknowingly been on a television show set his whole life. The film is as philosophical as that premise would suggest, while remaining a breezy and enjoyable comedy in a manner reminiscent of “Groundhog Day.” — JG\n\n“The Yearling” (1946)\n\nWith Florida filming locations including Ocala, “The Yearling” — based on the novel by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings — is an emotive family drama about a young boy on a farm who adopts a young deer, which, alas, has a penchant for the crops. Starring Gregory Peck, it was nominated for Best Picture and won two Oscars at the 19th Academy Awards. — WT"
