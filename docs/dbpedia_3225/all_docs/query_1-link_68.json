        "text": "Key Largo is an island in the Florida Keys. It is perhaps also known as the setting for the eponymous film starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in 1948, as well as the eponymous hit song by Bertie Higgins in 1981.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nFly into Miami or Fort Lauderdale. Chauffeured transportation is expensive. Renting a car is best. From Miami, take Florida's Turnpike south to US Route 1. Take US 1 to Key Largo. Note that the toll roads no longer allow you to pay cash, however, you can register your car online in order to use the toll roads. Rental cars are equipped with transponders, but fees vary by company.\n\nThere are also cheap local bus connections to Key Largo from the Miami metro area for those with some patience and flexibility.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nKey Largo does not lend itself to bikes or walking. Although there is a bike path, it runs just alongside the highway, and as such would not be the most relaxing (or pleasant) of rides. Most shops are along the highway, and as such the main drag has something of a strip-mall feel (for the most part, the water is not visible from the highway).\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nDo\n\n[edit]\n\nKey Largo is known as a diving Mecca, and many dive companies operate from here, taking large numbers of people to the reefs. In addition, other water-related activities like snorkeling, touring on a glass bottom boat or casino boat, parasailing, and fishing are all popular activities here. On land, motorcycle riding is popular, with rentals available.\n\nJohn Pennekamp Park also has kayaks for rent, with routes ranging from 30 minutes to 2 or more hours. You can also snorkel from the beaches at the park, but there's no coral reef there - you'll be looking at sea grass beds and mangroves, and the water may not be as clear as the sites that the tours take you to.\n\nBuy\n\n[edit]\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Keys have a large Cuban population, so in addition to the obvious (fish), be sure to try some Cuban food (or coffee). Many restaurants have excellent seaside seating with amazing views. In addition to the offerings below, neighbouring Islamorada has the excellent Marker 88 (located at mile marker 88) seaside restaurant.\n\nThe food is very good. The service is enthusiastic and the staff has personality.\n\nDrink\n\n[edit]\n\nIslamorada has some decent dive bars.\n\nSleep\n\n[edit]\n\nCampground\n\n[edit]"
