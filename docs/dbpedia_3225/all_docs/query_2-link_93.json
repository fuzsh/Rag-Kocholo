        "text": "COLDWATER – Legendary couple Bogie and Bacall bring their famous chemistry to the big screen on Saturday, April 4 with the Tibbits Classic Film Series showing of “The Big Sleep”and“Key Largo.”\n\nFilm stars Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall shared an iconic romance and a happy, albeit short-lived, marriage. They achieved this despite a 25-year age difference. Bacall wrote in her memoir, “No one has written a romance better than we lived it.” Bacall admits there was ‘no lightning bolt’ when she first met Bogart. When she first arrived in Hollywood, 19-year-old Bacall wasn’t a big fan of Bogart. When Howard Hawks told her he was thinking of putting her in a movie with either Bogart or Cary Grant, her reaction was, “I thought, ‘Cary Grant — terrific! Humphrey Bogart — yucch.” In their first film together, “To Have and Have Not,” Bogart’s character romances another woman, but when director Howard Hawks saw how the two were interacting on film the screenplay was changed so Bogart’s character ended up with Bacall’s. As Bacall noted in 2007, “Chemistry — you can’t beat chemistry.”\n\nFirst to be screened is the Raymond Chandler noir classic, “The Big Sleep.” P.I. Philip Marlowe (Bogart) is hired by a wealthy general to find out who is blackmailing his youngest daughter Carmen and put a stop to it. Very soon Marlowe finds himself deep within a web of love triangles, blackmail, murder, gambling, and organized crime. With help from the general’s oldest daughter Vivian (Bacall), Marlowe hatches a plot to free the family from this web and trap the real culprit.\n\nThe evening will close with the tense drama “Key Largo.” World War II veteran Frank McCloud (Bogart) travels to a run-down hotel on Key Largo to honor the memory of his friend who died bravely in battle. His friend’s widow, Nora Temple (Bacall), manages the hotel along with her father. Soon after arriving, the three find themselves virtual prisoners when the hotel is taken over by a group of gangsters led by Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), who plans to use the hotel to wait out a passing hurricane. Now being opposed to violence due to his experiences in the war, Frank is reluctant to act, but Rocco’s demeaning treatment of his alcoholic girlfriend and his complicity in the death of a deputy sheriff slowly begin to motivate McCloud into taking action.\n\n“Bogie and Bacall” is the sixth installment of the Tibbits Classic Film Series, a set of monthly double features showcasing Hollywood classics from every decade. Be sure not to miss “The Swift Sword of Errol Flynn” in May, this season’s last installment. The Classic Film Series is sponsored by Dr. Matthew Christopher, DDS. Admission to the film series is free. Concessions, including a cash bar, will be available for purchase. For more information, please visit Tibbits.org or call 517-278-6029.\n\nCOLDWATER – Experience the tongue-twisting musical mastery of Hollywood legend Danny Kaye on March 21 at 6pm with “The Inspector General” and “The Court Jester,” part of Tibbits Classic Film Series at Tibbits Opera House.\n\nLeading man Danny Kaye left school at the age of 13 to work in the so-called Borscht Belt of Jewish resorts in the Catskill Mountains. From there he went through a series of jobs in and out of show business. In 1939, he made his Broadway debut in “Straw Hat Revue,” but it was the stage production of the musical “Lady in the Dark” in 1940 that brought him acclaim and notice from agents. Danny could sing and dance like many others, but his specialty was reciting those tongue-twisting songs and monologues.\n\nSamuel Goldwyn signed Kaye and put him in a series of Technicolor musicals, starting with “Up in Arms” (1944). His debut was successful, and he continued to make hit movies such as “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” (1947) “The Inspector General” (1949), and “White Christmas” (1954), which was based on the Irving Berlin song of the same name. In 1955, he made what many consider his best comedy, “The Court Jester” (1955), with the brilliant Pellet with the Poison routine. Some of his last roles were also his most memorable, such as an intense Holocaust survivor in “Skokie” (1981) and as a kind but goofy dentist in an episode of “The Cosby Show” (1984). He also worked tirelessly for UNICEF.\n\nThe first film of the evening will be “The Inspector General.” An illiterate stooge in a traveling medicine show wanders into a strange town and is picked up on a vagrancy charge. The town’s corrupt officials mistake him for the inspector general whom they think is traveling in disguise. Fearing he will discover they’ve been pocketing tax money, they make several bungled attempts to kill him. In addition to Kaye, this film stars Walter Slezak and Elsa Lanchester.\n\nThe night will close with the musical spoof “The Court Jester.” Former carnival performer Hubert Hawkins and maid Jean are assigned to protect the infant royal heir from tyrannical King Roderick. While Jean takes the baby to an abbey, Hawkins gains access to the court by impersonating the king’s jester, unaware that the jester is really an assassin hired by scheming Sir Ravenhurst. Hawkins is able to persuade Roderick and his men that he is indeed a jester, but his espionage work gets complicated when Princess Gwendolyn falls in love with him. “The Court Jester” also stars Basil Rathbone and Angela Lansbury.\n\n“Danny Kaye Musicals” is the fifth installment of the Tibbits Classic Film Series, a set of monthly double features showcasing Hollywood classics from every decade. Coming up are “Bogie and Bacall” in April and “The Swift Sword of Errol Flynn” in May. The Classic Film Series is sponsored by Dr. Matthew Christopher, DDS. Admission to the film series is free. Concessions, including a cash bar, will be available for purchase. For more information, please visit Tibbits.org or call 517-278-6029.\n\nCOLDWATER – Tibbits Classic Film Series will once again showcase the 2020 Academy Award nominees for best animated and live action short films on Sunday, February 9.\n\n“We are excited to bring this event back for a second year and present these films on the big screen,” said Tibbits film curator Matt Biolchini. “You have a chance to enjoy these shorts and make your predictions of the winners prior to the Academy Award ceremony, which takes place the evening of Sunday, Feb. 9,” he continued.\n\nA short film is any motion picture that has a running time of 40 minutes or less, including all credits, per guidelines set forth by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In the past, short films generally relied on exhibitions at festivals to reach an audience. This is still the case for the most part, with the short films being shown at Sundance and Cannes, the biggest festivals.\n\nWhile there are three categories-live action, animation, and documentary- Tibbits will be showing nominations in the first two categories. Animation really took advantage of the short film format when Warner Brothers and Disney began putting short cartoons before all of their feature length films. This is a tradition that Pixar has carried over to the present day by screening a short along with each of its feature films during its initial theatrical run since 1995.\n\nTypically the short film is the first step for new filmmakers, but professional actors and crews will quite often opt to create shorts as an alternative form of expression, such as Twilight star Kristen Stewart did with her directorial debut Come Swim in 2017. The short film has been particularly kind to up-and-coming directors, most notably Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine on a Spotless Mind, Be Kind Rewind), John Lasseter (Toy Story, Cars), Tim Burton (Edward Scissor Hands, Batman), John Carpenter (Halloween, The Thing, Christine), Mike Judge (King of the Hill, Office Space, Idiocracy), and F. Gary Grey (Friday, The Italian Job-2003).\n\nThis special presentation of the 2019 Oscar-Nominated Shorts begins at 2pm and has a cost of $8. The films are not yet rated but the trailers for each film are available at shorts.tv/theoscarshorts. Concessions, including a cash bar, will be available for purchase. Tibbits Classic Film Series showcases Hollywood classics from such genres as sci-fi, film noir, musicals, comedies, and mysteries, and is sponsored by Dr. Matthew Christopher, DDS. All other showings to the Classic Film Series are free. For more information or to purchase tickets, please visit Tibbits.org or call 517-278-6029. Screenings are held at the historic Tibbits Opera House, 14 S. Hanchett St. Coldwater.\n\nBUY TICKETS HERE\n\nCOLDWATER – Tibbits Classic Film Series will re-introduce audiences to two forgotten masterpieces when they screen Joel and Ethan Coen’s “Miller’s Crossing” and Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy” on January 11 at 6pm.\n\nEven film makers who are generally regarded as geniuses can make a film that slips into obscurity. “Miller’s Crossing” and “The King of Comedy” are classics to film buffs but are mostly unknown to the general public. These films either fade away due to not being well-received by audiences at the time of their release, or as is the case with “The King of Comedy,” the creator’s films before and after are so highly praised or infamous— “Taxi Driver,” “Raging Bull,” “The Last Temptation of Christ,” and “Goodfellas”— that they are just plain overlooked.\n\nThe evening will open with Joel and Ethan Coen’s “Miller’s Crossing,” a neo-noir mob movie set during Prohibition. Tom Reagan is the chief adviser to a mob boss, Leo, who is in a dispute with lower level boss, Johnny Caspar, over the activities of bookie Bernie Bernbaum. Meanwhile, Tom is in a secret relationship with Leo’s girlfriend, Verna who happens to be Bernie’s sister. In trying to resolve the situation without bloodshed, Tom is cast out from Leo’s camp and ultimately finds himself stuck between several deadly and unforgiving parties. “Miller’s Crossing” was considered a huge failure at the time, making back a little over five million dollars of its 14-million-dollar budget. In later years it found an audience on home video and in 2005 Time Magazine chose it as one of the 100 greatest films made since the magazine’s inception. “Miller’s Crossing” stars Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, John Turturro, and Marcia Gay Harden.\n\nRounding out the evening is Martin Scorsese’s black-comedy gem, “The King of Comedy.” Rupert Pupkin is obsessed with becoming a comedy great. After meeting his idol, comedian and talk show host Jerry Langford, Rupert sincerely believes he has been given a spot on Langford’s show and a shot at stardom. Reality soon drags Rupert out of his cloud of delusion and he realizes to get on Langford’s show he will have to enlist the help of his celebrity-obsessed friend Masha and kidnap the comedy great. Some film buffs consider this film to be a companion piece to “Taxi Driver.” Both films are set in New York City and deal with a main character who has a distorted sense of reality. “The King of Comedy” is more along the lines of “The Office,” compared to “Taxi Driver” which is very dark, violent, and depressing. Like “Miller’s Crossing,” “The King of Comedy” also bombed with audiences making back a feeble $2.5 million of its $19 million budget but found an audience in later years. Actor Steve Carell, a fan of black comedies, cited “The King of Comedy” as a personal favorite and fans of “The Office” will be able to see the influence of De Niro’s Rupert Pupkin on Carrell’s Michael Scott. “The King of Comedy” stars Robert De Niro, Jerry Lewis, and Sandra Bernhard.\n\n“Forgotten Masterpieces” is the fourth installment of the Tibbits Classic Film Series, an 8-part set of monthly double features showcasing Hollywood classics from every decade screened at the Tibbits Opera House on 14 S. Hanchett Street in downtown Coldwater. The Classic Film Series is sponsored by Dr. Matthew Christopher, DDS. Admission to the film series is free unless noted. Concessions, including a cash bar, will be available for purchase. For more information, please visit Tibbits.org or call 517-278-6029.\n\nCOLDWATER – The warmth of the historic theatre, the smell of hot chocolate, and the sights and sounds of two family-friendly Christmas movies will fill Tibbits Opera House December 22 at 2pm when the Tibbits Classic Film Series offers free showings of “The Polar Express” and “It’s a Wonderful Life.”\n\nFew things are capable of evoking the heart-warming feeling of the holiday season like a good Christmas movie. They range in subject matter from simple stories of people finding love as in “A Boyfriend for Christmas” to the off-the-wall B movie greatness of the classic sci-fi adventure “Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.” In recent years even Krampus, Santa’s evil counterpart, has gotten in on the act with several of his own films being released. The December installment of Tibbits Classic Films Series will focus on the family-friendly, feel-good holiday movie with the modern-day adventure, “The Polar Express,” and the timeless classic, “It’s a Wonderful Life.”\n\nThe afternoon begins with “The Polar Express”. This 2004 computer-animated film based on the 1985 children’s book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg features Tom Hanks in multiple roles. On Christmas Eve, a young boy embarks on a magical adventure to the North Pole on Santa’s Polar Express, while learning about friendship, bravery, and the true spirit of Christmas.\n\nNext is the Frank Capra 1946 masterpiece, “It’s a Wonderful Life,” starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed. Based on the short story “The Greatest Gift” by Philip Van Doren Stern, the film has become one of the most beloved in American cinema, and has become traditional viewing during the Christmas season. An angel named Clarence is sent from Heaven to help George, a desperately frustrated businessman contemplating suicide on Christmas Eve. Clarence shows George all the lives he has touched, and how different life would be if he had never been born. Screening of “It’s a Wonderful Life will begin approximately 3:45pm.\n\nIt’s a Wonderful Christmas is the third installment of the Tibbits Classic Film Series, an 8-part set of monthly double features showcasing Hollywood classics from every decade. The Classic Film Series is sponsored by Dr. Matthew Christopher, DDS. Admission to the film series is free unless noted. Concessions, including a cash bar, will be available for purchase. For more information, please visit Tibbits.org or call 517-278-6029.\n\nFind the event on our calendar HERE.\n\nCOLDWATER – The big screen will explode at Tibbits Opera House with two unconventional Christmas classics, “Die Hard” and “Lethal Weapon” on Saturday, November 23 at 6pm with An Action-Packed Christmas.\n\nIn the world of cinema, few things are as beloved or as comforting as a good holiday movie. Families coming together, lonely hearts finding true love amidst colorful lights, children staring at glowing decorations in wide-eyed wonderment, and cold hearts being thawed by festive cheer and togetherness. According to Matt Biolchini, Tibbits film curator, “These Christmas movies have none of that.”\n\nEvery once and a while Hollywood presents audiences with an atypical holiday classic that despite their lack of seasonal conventions still become staples of holiday viewing. For many action movie fans “Die Hard” and “Lethal Weapon” are two such features.\n\nLaunching the film careers of its star, Bruce Willis, and its director John McTiernan, “Die Hard,” considered to be the benchmark for action movies even today, some 30 years after its release, will be the first to be screened at 6pm. While visiting his estranged wife in Los Angles, New York City police officer John McClane is invited to her office Christmas party at the still under construction Nakatomi Tower. Midway through the evening a group of European criminals take the party goers hostage in an attempt to steal millions from the company’s vault. In the chaos McClane is able to slip away and begins making life for the robbers very difficult. Determined to rescue his wife and the hostages, McClane is forced to deal with an angry thug bent on revenge, inept police and FBI officials, treacherous elevator shafts, and the fact that he’s barefoot amongst construction debris, steel, concrete, and broken glass.\n\nThe second film, “Lethal Weapon,” will take to the screen at 8pm. Roger Murtaugh is an aging family man and sensible veteran police officer just trying to make it through his last few years on the force unscathed. Martin Riggs is a suicidal, loose cannon who doesn’t care if he even lives to see the end of the day. Reluctantly thrown together to solve the mysterious murder of a banker’s daughter, the unlikely duo uncovers a dangerous ring of drug smugglers employing ex-military mercenaries. After a tragic turn of events, the mission becomes personal and the mismatched investigators must learn to trust one another as they wage a two-man war against a deadly criminal organization. “Lethal Weapon” is responsible for starting the movie convention of an aging character proclaiming, “I’m getting too old for sh–,” which has been parodied in countless films and TV shows.\n\nAn Action-Packed Christmas is the second installment of the Tibbits Classic Film Series, an 8-part set of monthly double features showcasing Hollywood classics from every decade. The Classic Film Series is sponsored by Dr. Matthew Christopher, DDS. Admission to the film series is free unless noted. Concessions, including a cash bar, will be available for purchase. For more information, please visit Tibbits.org or call 517-278-6029.\n\nCOLDWATER – On Saturday, October 26 at 5:30pm, Tibbits Opera House once again unleashes its MONSTER FEST for the fourth year for another evening-long Halloween event.\n\nBefore Coldwater’s Halloween parade starts, head to Tibbits and watch what is considered to be one of the most beloved family films of the 90s, Disney’s “Hocus Pocus.” In 1693, three sisters, Winifred, Mary and Sarah are executed for practicing witchcraft but not before their living book of spells reveals to them a way for the trio to return from the dead. 300 years later, teenager Max Dennison is a newcomer to Salem, must spend the evening escorting annoying little sister door to door for trick or treating while their parents enjoy the town Halloween dance. Max’s efforts to impress a girl lead him to break the curse and bring the sisters Sanderson back from the dead. Thus begins a non-stop, fun-filled chase that has the fate of all the children of Salem hanging in the balance.\n\nThe evening continues after the parade with 1984s cultural phenomenon “Gremlins.” Bank teller Billy Peltzer is given a small creature known as a Mogwai for Christmas by his father. Billy is then told there are three VERY important rules he must follow to properly care for his strange new pet, which Billy names Gizmo: Don’t get him wet, no food after midnight, and keep him away from bright light. In true monster movie fashion, Billy almost immediately fails to follow two of the three rules. The accidental violation of the first two rules unleashes an uncontrollable horde of small, mean-spirited and mischievous green monsters who proceed to terrorize the unsuspecting town of Kingston Falls.\n\nMONSTER FEST 4 comes to a close with “Critters,” which will begin around 10pm. After breaking out of an intergalactic prison, a pack of small creatures known as Krits steal a ship and make their way to the closest planet with enough life to satisfy their voracious appetite, Earth. Pursued by a pair of shapeshifting bounty hunters the Krits begin to turn the inhabitants of a small town into lunch. Looking to capitalize on the success of “Gremlins,” Hollywood gave the green light to any movie involving small destructive creatures. Films like “The Gate,” “Ghoulies” and“Munchies” were the order of the day. Even though “Critters” spawned from the desire to rip off a major blockbuster it has lasted longer than intended, spawning four sequels, the most recent being released this year and the third starring a young Leonardo DiCaprio. 2019 also saw the release of a recent limited run TV series. It is a must-see for any fan of 80s monster movies.\n\nMONSTER FEST 4 is the first installment of the Tibbits Classic Film Series, an 8-part set of monthly double features showcasing Hollywood classics from every decade. The entire Classic Film Series is sponsored by Dr. Matthew Christopher, DDS. Admission to the film series is free unless noted. Concessions, including a cash bar, will be available for purchase. For more information, please visit Tibbits.org or call 517-278-6029.\n\nGo to the TIBBITS CALENDAR to see all events listed in the CLASSIC FILM SERIES\n\nCOLDWATER—Tibbits Classic Film Series brings another batch of must-see films featuring classics from every decade from modern classics to Monster Fest and musicals to swashbuckling adventures of the past.\n\nIn 2016, Tibbits began a salute to its movie house days of the 30s and 40s by screening two classic double features each month. The idea was to host a movie-going experience seldom offered in this part of the state: classic films on the big screen. From October 2019 through May 2020, Tibbits will screen two classic films a month consisting of all genres from comedy and action to drama and musicals.\n\nAs with the last three years, the film series begins with MONSTER FEST. Perfect for the season this event starts before Coldwater’s Halloween parade with the 90s family favorite “Hocus Pocus,” continuing after the parade with the 80s creature features of “Gremlins” and “Critters.” The following months will see such themes as An Action Packed Christmas featuring “Die Hard” and “Lethal Weapon,” It’s a Wonderful Christmas featuring “Polar Express” and “It’s a Wonderful Life,” Forgotten Masterpieces featuring “Miller’s Crossing” and “The King of Comedy,” the 2020 Academy Award Nominated Short Films: Animated and Live Action, Danny Kaye Musicals featuring “The Inspector General” and “The Court Jester,” Bogie & Bacall featuring “The Big Sleep” and “Key Largo,” and finally The Swift Sword of Errol Flynn featuring “The Adventures of Robin Hood” and “Captain Blood.”\n\nAgain this year Tibbits will present the 2020 Academy Award Nominated Short Films in February. Most movie fans are never given the opportunity to see these short films in the theatre or they are forced to drive hours away. Last year Tibbits Opera House became one of only three locations in the southern part of Michigan to exhibit these titles. This is the one event in the series for which an $8 admission will be charged.\n\nTibbits Classic Film Series is sponsored Dr. Matthew Christopher, DDS, PC. With offices in Coldwater and Union City the dental office prides itself on “crafting smiles to last a lifetime.” Information on their dental services can be found at UCSmiles.com. Admission to the classic film series is free unless indicated. Concessions, including a cash bar, will be available for purchase in the elevator lobby at the Ghost Light Bar during all screenings. All showings take place at the historic Tibbits Opera House, 14 S. Hanchett St. in Coldwater, MI. For more information or a detailed listing of all films being presented during the Classic Film Series, please visit Tibbits.org or call 517-278-6029.\n\nView all Classic Film Series dates at our calendar.\n\nCOLDWATER – Experience the artistry of cinema with two groundbreaking classics when Tibbits Classic Film Series screens “Invitation to the Dance” and “Citizen Kane” on June 9 at 2pm.\n\nWhile the story is always key to a good film, the method of telling the story becomes key in each of these films. “Invitation to the Dance” integrates dance and film to tell a story. “Citizen Kane” explores new visual devices, lighting and unique camera angles as a means of advancing the story. Both films also celebrate the genius of their creators Gene Kelly and Orson Welles, respectively.\n\nFirst “Invitation to the Dance” from 1956, written, directed, choreographed and starring Gene Kelly, conveys three separate stories told entirely through dance. In the first story, “Circus,” Kelly portrays a clown who’s in love with a performer while she’s in love with an aerialist, forming a tragic love triangle. Segment two, “Ring Around the Rosy,” follows a golden bracelet through a delirious journey of re-gifting each time to win over someone. In the final segment, “Sinbad the Sailor,” sailor Kelly discovers a genie who grants his wishes. Sinbad wishes himself inside a book and fights for love by out dancing his enemies.\n\nNext, audiences dive into the unraveling of the mystery of “rosebud” in 1952’s “Citizen Kane.” Produced, co-written, directed and starring Orson Welles, the film also features Joseph Cotton and Dorothy Comingore. “Citizen Kane” follows publishing tycoon Charles Foster Kane’s life leading up to his inevitable demise. Running parallel with Kane’s back story, news reporter Jerry Thompson is tasked with discovering the meaning of Kane’s last word “rosebud.”\n\nThe Art of the Silver Screen is the final segment of Tibbits Classic Film Series for the season. The monthly double-features showcase Hollywood classics from such genres as sci-fi, film noir, musicals, comedies, and mysteries. The entire Classic Film Series has been graciously sponsored by Dr. Matthew Christopher, DDS. Admission to the films is free. Concessions, including a cash bar, will be available for purchase.\n\nFor more information, please visit Tibbits.org or call 517-278-6029. Screenings are held at the historic Tibbits Opera House, 14 S. Hanchett St. Coldwater.\n\nLearn more about the films HERE\n\nCOLDWATER – Watch ordinary people risk their lives for justice as they investigate seemingly hopeless and hard to crack crimes as Tibbits Classic Film series presents Mystery Night May 25, 2019 at 7pm.\n\nFirst up in this double feature, the 1950 classic starring Ricardo Montalban and Bruce Bennet, “Mystery Street.” A small town policeman, Pete Morales (Montalban), is assisted by Harvard professor, Dr McAdoo (Bennet), when a human skeleton is found on a Massachusetts beach. Lt. Morales must use the bones to his advantage, to identify the victim’s identity, killer, and history to save an innocent suspect and find the real culprit. This method of identifying the body, killer and history was new and they had little to go on because it was before modern Forensic Science.\n\nThe evening concludes with the 1944 crime drama “Phantom Lady” starring Alan Curtis and Ella Raines. An unhappy Scott Henderson (Curtis) and a woman with a hat that doesn’t divulge her name spend the evening together. Upon returning home, Scott finds his wife strangled making him the prime suspect. His alibi, an anonymous woman wearing a hat, is oddly not remembered by anyone which causes him to lose his only alibi. His faithful secretary, Kansas (Raines), believes that he’s innocent and risks her life following dangerous clues to find the phantom lady.\n\n“If you’re a fan of the classic ‘who do it’, this would be the night to attend our film series” says Matt Biolchini, Tibbits Graphic Designer and curator of the film series. “Wrong man accused, shady characters, a femme fatale and plenty of twists and turns, these two films have plenty.” He adds, “Not to mention the dramatic chiaroscuro lighting that was common in all film noir of this time.”\n\n“Phantom Lady” and “Mystery Night” are both classified as Film Noir. The term used to describe Hollywood crime dramas is French for “black film” or “dark film.” The Film Noir period extended from the 1920s to late 1950s and is usually associated with a black and white visual style.\n\nThe “Tibbits Classic Film Series”, a 10-part set of monthly double features, showcases Hollywood classics from such genres as sci-fi, film noir, musicals, comedies, and mysteries. The entire Classic Film Series is sponsored by Dr. Matthew Christopher, DDSwho has been supporting Tibbits since 2012. Admission to the film series is free. Concessions, including a cash bar, will be available for purchase.\n\nFor more information, please visit Tibbits.org or call 517-278-6029.
