        "text": ".\n\nDirector: John Huston\n\nScreenwriters: Richard Brooks, John Huston\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nWhen the ranks of Hollywood directors who left the sound stage to contribute to the World War II effort returned home to their careers, many had made a personal promise to strike out with a more independent and purposeful brand of cinema. John Huston was one of them. Huston, already long-weathered as a screenwriter who rode into that career on the coattails of his actor father Walter, had been lucky to survive some of his wild and oft-inebriated adventures in the 1930s: not everyone in his company did. He recovered to make a startling directorial debut with 1941’s The Maltese Falcon, a work of machine-tooled efficiency that managed the impossible task of giving Citizen Kane a run for its money as the most significant debut film of the year. Huston was immediately ensconced as a major filmmaker. But he only managed two more movies – the Bette Davis vehicle In This Our Life (1942) and Across The Pacific (1942), a lumpy espionage thriller with the reunited stars of The Maltese Falcon – before he left to join the US Army Signal Corps as a filmmaker. He made three highly regarded documentaries during the war, Report From The Aleutians (1943), The Battle of San Pietro (1945), and the study of psychiatric treatment for shell-shocked veterans Let There Be Light (1946). But he fought losing battles to keep more critical elements in the second film, and the third was suppressed altogether.\n\nWhen Huston finally returned to the fold at Warner Bros. he successfully battled a dubious Jack Warner to make The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948). His comeback feature only gained mild box office success at first, but won plaudits including Oscars for himself and his father, and quickly became an anointed classic. More than that, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre was a vital moment for American film. In style, Huston melded aspects of the pre-war working class melodramas Warners had specialised in, the French Poetic Realist tradition, post-war noir, and neorealist and docudrama elements. In terms of subject, it depicted the perpetually nagging and destructive nature of seeking wealth, into a mixture singular in its moment and near-endlessly influential, particular in the New Hollywood era: it’s been said that filmmakers from Sam Peckinpah to Robert Altman devoted themselves to remaking it again and again. The run of work Huston accomplished in the first five years of his resumed Hollywood career – The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Key Largo, We Were Strangers (1949), The Asphalt Jungle, The Red Badge of Courage (1951), and The African Queen (1952), is one of the strongest from any filmmaker of any time, even if not every film was appreciated in the moment. Key Largo was the price Warner exacted from Huston for backing The Treasure of the Sierra Madre: in a classic “one for me, one for them” trade-off, Huston was obligated to take on a less expensive and arduous property for a follow-up.\n\nBut Key Largo provided an ideal blueprint that let Huston find new stages to work through the preoccupations had winnowed on The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and kicked off a triptych of films concerned with claustrophobic criminal enterprise and group dynamics. Huston immediately followed it with We Were Strangers, a highly underrated study in revolutionary terrorism only really hindered by the miscasting of Jennifer Jones, and The Asphalt Jungle, a film that was to inflect 1950s crime cinema as much or more than The Maltese Falcon had set the scene for film noir in the ‘40s. Huston, never the most easy-going of personalities, was struggling through divorce and the lingering effects of wartime experience at the time, and was also facing a rapidly curdling peacetime zeitgeist. By 1948, the optimistic and reforming zeal instilled by victory in the war was slowly devolving into the tense and paranoid early days of the Cold War and the Red Scare. Huston and favoured collaborator Humphrey Bogart, despite their reputation as macho, hard-drinking hell-raisers, also represented the leading edge of the Hollywood progressive ethos at the time, and with Bogart’s wife and frequent co-star Lauren Bacall, William Wyler, Sterling Hayden, and others helped form a protests and resistance organisation aimed at defending the “Hollywood Ten” called as witnesses before HUAC. That resistance fell apart in the face of the orchestrated political aggression and, some of their defenders felt, the misjudged and showboating attitude of the Ten themselves.\n\nAs if rubbing salt into the wounds, Warner was making Huston film, in Key Largo, a play by the politically reactionary dramatist Maxwell Anderson, first performed in 1939. Anderson was a peculiar talent, fond of writing dramas blending hardboiled contemporary topics and personalities with a rarefied theatrical approach, sometimes even employing blank verse dialogue: his work was something of a bridge between the American theatre of Eugene O’Neill and that of Tennessee Williams. Anderson’s play Key Largo was ostensibly a chamber piece melodrama about motley characters, including a band of vicious gangsters, locked up in a hotel on the titular island together during a hurricane. The play was filled with dated geopolitical motifs by the time it was handed to Huston. Anderson was a noted political enemy of Franklin Roosevelt, whereas Huston was a committed New Dealer. As if by compensation, Huston got to work with Bogart and Bacall together for the first time, as well as another fiercely liberal actor, Edward G. Robinson, one of the many actors who had to pass on the Huston-written, Raoul Walsh-directed High Sierra (1941) before Bogart landed his star-making role in it. Huston worked on the script with Richard Brooks, another dynamic, hardboiled screenwriter about to become a director of note, and the creative team began to reknit Anderson’s play into a thriller with an edge of parable closer to their own bent. That Huston invested much of his own experience and perspective into the rewritten storyline is apparent as he makes the protagonist a veteran of the San Pietro campaign he had documented. Key Largo became one of the most famous Hollywood films of its time, not least for capturing Bogart and Bacall in their fourth and final on-screen pairing, a moment of movie star mystique dubiously celebrated in a hit 1982 pop song.\n\nFor Bogart, the project might have contained extra dimensions of irony. His first attempt to go Hollywood after a successful stage career floundered in the early sound days, and it wasn’t until he played the gangster Duke Mantee in Robert Sherwood’s play The Petrified Forest that he gained a vehicle that changed him from an actor typecast as Joe College types to a fearsome tough guy on either side of the law, the persona that would make him one of cinema’s perennial stars. Mantee had held up a diner in the middle of the desert. Key Largo saw Bogart now playing the hero in a similar situation (he would revert to the villain again in a third visit to the theme, 1955’s The Desperate Hours). He was also cast opposite Robinson, one of several stars who once had to pass on a script before Bogart could get it, and with whom he’d acted in films like Kid Galahad (1937) and Brother Orchid (1938), always playing heavies to Robinson’s protagonists. Anderson’s play might well have taken some licence from Sherwood’s, which presented the anxiety, all too keen and justified in the mid-’30s zeitgeist, that the world was being taken over by bullies, thugs, and crude avatars of a brutish age. Anderson’s play more explored the fears that cripple otherwise good people, preventing them from taking positive action in the face of such evil. Huston’s take angrily revised this to encompass a study of the fate of the wartime confidence in the face of old evils and lingering ghosts.\n\nSo, Anderson’s hero, who had served in the Spanish Civil War, became the former Major Frank McCloud (Bogart), whose life since VE Day has been unsettled, nomadic, and increasingly, cynically alienated. He can be seen as a version of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre’s Fred C. Dobbs who weathered the awfulness of life on the bottom and has gotten his act together, but hasn’t quite kicked the slow poison of cynicism. Anderson’s protagonist was a deserter; Huston’s became a hero who shuns spotlights and finds himself resentful in being presented with yet another great moral quandary and demand for sacrificial heroism. The opening shots swoop down from a godlike remove to sweaty intimacy, setting in motion a movie laced with visual and thematic hints of the spiritual clashing with the all too earthbound. The camera eventually locates McCloud listening in as the police who pull over the bus he’s riding over warn the driver about a pair of brothers from a local Seminole tribe, the Osceola boys, who have escaped custody and are now on the loose. Huston pulls off a neat unit of visual economy in this scene, McCloud’s attentive face visible in a rear-view mirror whilst cop and driver talk, introducing McCloud via Bogart’s unmistakeable mug without a word, giving the sense immediately that he’s an attentive and canny person who knows when to keep his mouth shut and his ears open.\n\nAlready McCloud is being drawn into the peculiar mesh of events about to unfold as he nears Key Largo itself, the largest of the islands off the South Florida coast. The apparent note of threat sounded by the escaped convicts on the scene proves a red herring that also encompasses ironies that permeate the rest of the film: Tom (Rodd Redwing) and John (Jay Silverheels) Osceola are essentially harmless, young men who got drunk and “decided to take Florida back for the Indians,” but the law is wasting manpower and energy chasing them when far greater criminals are lurking in the wings. McCloud has come to the island on a personal mission, to visit the family of one of his former soldiers, George Temple, who died in combat but captured a medal for gallantry in the process. James Temple (Lionel Barrymore), George’s father, owns a large hotel on the Key Largo beachfront, and George’s widow Nora (Bacall) lives with him, helping run the place. Barrymore, because of leg injuries he had suffered in a fall, was by this time mostly acting in a wheelchair, and Huston exploits this to make Temple essentially an avatar for Roosevelt in the drama, the ailing but nobly humane paterfamilias whose house is invaded by the iniquitous.\n\nIn this regard Key Largo deals overtly with a theme usually left more abstract or suggestive in other noir films, in dealing directly with the problem of battling social evil on the home front upon return for ex-soldiers, and the lingering, disconsolate spirit of the war hanging over their lives. The cost of that war is still inflecting the lives of people who fought it and lost loved-ones in it. McCloud recounts to Nora and Temple the circumstances of George’s death, still vague to them as they subsist in a forlorn stasis. This vignette contains flashes of strange and numinous poetry, as McCloud mentions a story George told him about how he knew all the secrets of life and death before birth, but an angel left the dimple under the nose placing his lips there to silence him. McCloud also mentions listening to George throughout a long and terrible night under fire, listening to George rave on the field telephone from a forward post during bombardment. Later Nora tells McCloud George wrote to her about the same event, only with their positions reversed; which man was where is ultimately unimportant, for the hallowed George and the grimly overwhelmed and restless McCloud present a dioptre vision of those who served, and as the story unfolds they become increasingly blurred. McCloud also recounts his own experiences since the cessation of hostilities, following which he couldn’t stand his old profession as a newspaperman and has since then burned through jobs, including stints as a day labourer. Eventually McCloud steps into the vacated place of George as son and husband, but he has to pass through a rite of death and rebirth to do so.\n\nMcCloud and Nora converse as Nora gets McCloud’s help to tie up Temple’s cabin cruiser, the two treading out to the dock jutting before the hotel, as McCloud tells Nora about his wanderings and many jobs since demobilisation, “including day labour.” Key Largo has a score by one of the most employed and likely the most famous of Old Hollywood’s stalwart composers, Max Steiner, who was rarely exactly subtle in creating aural textures but also helped invest so many movies that rarefied quality of mythic grandeur that distinguished the era’s Hollywood product. Steiner’s swooning touch is particularly apparent in a seemingly minor moment, when Nora helps McCloud secure the cruiser for the oncoming storm, McCloud heaving the boat in close to the dock and making it safe with his nautical skill on display. Steiner makes the subtext of the scene, of the bond already forming between the former soldier and war widow, rather more overt with this florid scoring. The Osceolas and their Seminole nation clan row up as McCloud and Nora work, with a marvellous vignette of Nora introducing McCloud to Mama Ochobe (Felipa Gómez), an incredibly old matriarch of the clan whose age nobody knows: “She admits to being a hundred and eight years old, but she has a son who’s a hundred and twelve, so we suspect Mama doesn’t tell the truth about her age.”\n\nMcCloud, upon first entering the hotel, encounters a range of uneasy, sweaty men who seem about as much at home as a polar bear in the same locale, and are split between making their distaste for company plain or seeming a little too eager play nice. There’s the talkative Curly (Thomas Gomez), the nervously sniggering, funny papers-reading Toots (Harry Lewis), the silent, hulking Ralph (William Haade), and the glumly servile Angel (Dan Seymour). Also hanging around is Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor), a wilted former nightclub singer who loves drinking and betting on horse races, in that order. McCloud tries to avoid the men, but is happy to partake of a few drinks once Gaye forces Angel to serve. Curly insists on dogging McCloud’s footsteps and explaining their presence as the miserable result of a holiday gone bad, which Curley blames on one of their party insisting on bringing Gaye. The local sheriff Ben Wade (Monte Blue) and his deputy Clyde Sawyer (John Rodney) visit the hotel, seeking out the Osceolas, who arrive a little later with members of their nation looking to give themselves up. Not long after, Sawyer’s car is seen parked near the hotel, but Sawyer himself in nowhere to be found. Soon enough the truth emerges: the men hiring out the hotel are all members of a criminal gang headed by the former mob boss Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), who was deported from the United States but now has risked a return on an illicit venture, and McCloud, Temple, and Nora are all taken hostage at gunpoint, and hustled into Rocco’s room, where Sawyer is held at bay.\n\nThe first glimpse of Rocco is a quintessentially Hustonian shot that nudges abstraction and harsh and oddball realism simultaneously: he’s found immersed in a bath, a rotating fan obscuring his features before a careful dolly in to reveal him as a bulbous and bullfrog-mouthed ogre rising up to take control of the land he once played feudal lord over. Huston repeats the impression of queasy intimacy with a Dickensian grotesque later when Rocco launches on an extended rant waxing nostalgic and frustrated about his one-time capacity to easily manipulate the processes of democracy and officials. Rocco delivers this whilst he’s being given a shave with a straight razor by Angel, who seems well used to such contortions whilst performing such duties, filmed in a long, epic close-up that also provides a showcase for Robinson’s virtuosity. Rocco’s emergence from his lair once his gang have detained the others in the hotel sets in motion the central drama, which is defined by the way the three entangled innocents react in their own special ways to the situation. Temple is defiantly disdainful of Rocco once McCloud tells him who he is. Nora is fretful but driven to glaze-eyed and clawing resistance when Rocco makes repeated sexual advances on her, whispering in her ear with insidious purpose. McCloud for his part vehemently declares his lack of interest in the gangster’s presence: “Who difference does it make if there’s one more or less Johnny Rocco in the world? What do I care if he lives or dies?”\n\nAnd yet McCloud’s inability to dampen down his acerbic phrasing and aura of hard-shelled sufficiency riles Rocco, to the point where he tries to bully the man he mocking calls “Soldier” into taking a gun he gives him and using it to make a break. McCloud refuses the chance; Sawyer instead eagerly snatches up the gun, only to find no bullets in it, but plenty in the one in Rocco’s hand. Sawyer’s body is dumped in the ocean as the hurricane rages. This drama is invested with a patently symbolic element, made overt when he has McCloud quote Franklin Roosevelt in commenting that the war wasn’t fought to go back to the kind of a world there was before it. Temple’s resemblance to the recently deceased president makes the connection even more explicit, whilst Rocco is identified not only with a bygone era of tabloid hero gangsters but also a sort of barbarianism associate with assaults on democracy and general civic corruption. Huston makes Rocco echo not just Lucky Luciano, who infamously helped keep the Nazis out of the docklands for the US government during the war only to then be turfed out of the country, but also political fixers like ‘Boss’ Tom Pendergast. McCloud prompts Rocco with the question of what he wants out of life, seeing as he’s still a rich and influential figure even in exile, and then answers for him: “More.” Rocco readily and enthusiastically concurs, imbuing the feeling that Rocco represents not just lingering barbarianism but also depicts the old-fashioned racketeer morphing into the modern entrepreneur.\n\nRocco’s deceit also results in the Osceola brothers being gunned down by the Sheriff, when Wade finds Sawyer’s dead body and Rocco slyly takes advantage by telling the Sheriff the two fugitives did it. This in turn sparks furious blame flung at Temple from both the Sheriff and the Osceolas’ tribe, nodding to a metaphor for the way all sorts of conniving and malfeasance gets laid at the door of the nation despite its best and most elevated intentions. The deaths of the Osceolas also proves a breaking point for McCloud: Huston moves for an electrifying close-up of McCloud after he learns of it, registering his virulent, oh-you-absolute-bastard offence and suddenly re-emerging fighting will to take on evil. Huston wrings Rocco’s gang for queasy humour: the gang regarded individually and without Rocco around have a quality reminiscent of a Disney animated film supporting cast in their variably oddball personas and tetchy relations, particularly Toots’ habit of reading out gags from comic strips to Curly’s irritation: “Explain it to us Toots,” Curly sneers after one too many, to Toots’ narrow-eyed irritation: “A wise guy, eh?”, a moment that writes a very rough sketch for the psychopathic brinkmanship of Goodfellas (1990). Only with Rocco marshalling this lot do they become anything more than a bunch of petty hoods, their varying talents, like Toots’ way with torture, given focus and purpose: here are shades of the oft-stated conviction many had that most of Hitler’s underlings were barely more than petty thugs and gangster poured into uniforms and roles of statecraft thanks to hitching their wagon to a great motivator.\n\nHuston would return often to chamber-piece dramas with fare like Night of the Iguana (1964) and The Dead (1987), but Key Largo is a slightly ungainly film in negotiating all this stagy talk, nor ideal for a thriller. Yet Key Largo remains riveting despite its lumpier pretentions, in part because those pretentions have substance, and also because the metaphorical drama is plugged into something raw and human, as Rocco’s various sadistic provocations land – goading Temple into trying to stand up from his wheelchair and punch him, baiting McCloud with the gun, and trying it on with Nora until she gouges ruts in his face with her fingernails. Trevor won an Oscar for her part as Gaye, who’s been living with the aftereffects of Rocco’s cruel charisma all her life, left a nerve-shot alcoholic who nonetheless recovers some of her character when she’s made a spectacle of, particularly in front of Nora, who Rocco says reminds him of the young Gaye before he successfully subjugated her. Gaye is indeed the kind of attention-getting supporting turn it’s easy to imagine any waning star leaping to land. Trevor strikes an initially overblown note in the way she hollers “Give him a drink!”, as if we’re in for an extended piece of showy hamola, but quickly settles into a sustained performance filled with brittle pathos. The scene that likely won her the Oscar is extended display of both that pathos and Rocco’s sadism, as he urges her into singing the tune she used to warble in her glory days, on the promise of a drink at the end. Gaye complies and after an initially impressive start falters and becomes increasingly frayed in voice and manner, Rocco unhappily shaking his head at the spectacle and finally refusing her the drink for her poor performance, leaving Gaye shivering and broken. This however stirs a show of deliberate defiance from McCloud that’s also an act of mercy as he pours a drink for Gaye and gives it to her: he accepts Rocco’s rebuking slap to his face with barely a blink.\n\nKey Largo constantly points out its own status as a work conscious of its genre and the tradition it’s both revisiting and helping evolve into something new. Huston offers many nods to the mystique of the 1930s gangster film, many of which he helped to write, through the presences of Bogart, Robinson, and Barrymore, who had won a Best Actor Oscar defending Leslie Howard for shooting Clark Gable’s hoodlum in A Free Soul (1932). Key Largo counts on the immediate recognition of Robinson as the ghost of Little Caesar (1930) as Huston confronts that familiar if dated mode with the post-war moment, Rocco the spectre of returning iniquity and tolerated evil, slipping almost literally in the back door. Walsh’s White Heat (1949) from the following year would take that further in climaxing with a miniature atomic holocaust that is also the apotheosis of the revelling gangster-barbarian king. Lewis’s performance as Toots nods to the impact of the previous year’s Kiss of Death as a variant on Richard Widmark’s tittering psychopath in that film, using that characterisation as a touchstone to note the evolution of the genre and the entrance into a rather more maniacal and unnerving age. Casting Bogart as a disillusioned and wounded warrior who regains his fighting pith obviously nods back to his role in Michael Curtiz’s Casablanca (1942), where he was essentially asked to play a symbolic actualisation of the hardboiled, cynical America of the 1930s, still feeling burned by involvement in World War I but eventually recognising the current fight really needed its involvement. Here Huston adapts this emblematic standing, noting that peacetime needs as much commitment and passion as war.\n\nTrevor’s role nods less to her parts in noir and gangster films, where she often played femmes fatale, than her other most famous role as the hapless prostitute in Stagecoach (1939). The way Huston’s casting plays on established personas and the elusive factor of audience recognition is to a certain extent subverted in Bacall’s casting, although she certainly serves the obvious purpose of providing Bogart’s love interest. But Bacall, so often called upon to play premature worldliness and audacious poise, here is cast as a relatively innocent figure, one who, whilst no naïf, is still recovering from tragic loss and lodged in the small world she keeps with the elder Temple. Nora is nonetheless no naïf, nor passive: far from reacting coolly to provocations from bullies as her character did in To Have And Have Not (1944), after Rocco and his men push Temple around Nora is stoked to glaze-eyed fury by the spectacle, launching on Rocco and slapping and scratching him, until grabs her and forces a kiss on her, calling her “little wildcat” in his delighted and aroused reaction, “Smell blood huh? Got your appetite up huh?”, in his conviction that such anger contains also the seeds of erotic excitement, that the diastolic relation of the two is a secret truth of life flowing under its staid surfaces, much like the simultaneous loathing of and desire for the dictatorial strength Rocco embodies. Interesting stuff, even if Huston can’t chase any of it as far as he might have.\n\nOther aspects of the film however have a strongly anticipatory quality of where popular storytelling was going. Key Largo is an ancestor of First Blood (1982), where the embittered veteran and the hunted criminal would collapse into the same frame. The duel of wills and finally guns between McCloud and Rocco anticipates the more expansive version in John McClane and Hans Gruber in John McTiernan’s Die Hard (1988), and the climactic scenes, where McCloud has to outwit and annihilate the criminal band, lays groundwork for that film and a slew of others in the action genre. The approach to Rocco and his gang, as embodiments not of a transitory barbarian phenomenon in American social life as they were usually viewed in the ‘30s gangster films but of something more insidious and perpetual and bound in with a sedimentary layer of venality and corruption, lays the groundwork for the mob films of Coppola and Scorsese. Whilst the actual purpose of Rocco’s invasion of the Keys is revealed to be peddling counterfeit cash, the location and the portrait of criminal traffic looks forward to the great days of the cocaine trade and the many cinematic portrayals of it, including Brian De Palma’s Scarface (1982) and Michael Mann’s Miami Vice (2006). In this regard, a running joke in the film – the conviction of the gangsters that one day pretty soon they’ll have a new form of Prohibition to make them rich and powerful again – feels alarmingly accurate.\n\nHuston’s reputation as a screenwriter turned director evidently who was fascinated by translating literary qualities into the cinematic has to a large extent hindered critical regard for him as a filmmaker proper. The play-like compression of his debut on The Maltese Falcon belied the edge of strangeness he was able to invest that space with, his as a character that encloses the humans, frames within frames that become strange portals, particularly the marvellous moment where his camera tracks over and above Bogart’s Sam Spade kissing Mary Astor’s Brigid O’Shaughnessy through a billowing curtain-framed window to glare down at Elisha Cook Jr’s lurking killer in the street, the impish embodiment of the falsity and danger in the relationship as if viewed through a portal into the psyche. Huston, as he told Michael Caine decades later, laboured hard to remove his filmmaking from the audience’s consciousness, which is a very different thing to not doing much of it. Through the 1950s and ‘60s, a time of thematic as well as artistic restlessness for the director that suggests personal connection with McCloud’s rootless search for new purpose, Huston experimented constantly with expressive modes in his moviemaking, including the earthy palette of Moby Dick (1956) and the saturated colours of Reflections in a Golden Eye (1966), the interplay of realism and surrealism in Freud (1962), and the shabby chic of The Misfits (1961), all of which would help set the scene for New Hollywood style in the 1970s. If The Treasure of the Sierra Madre had seen Huston perfectly fuse elements of film noir and neorealism, Key Largo asked for something very different given its tight and stagy focus.\n\nHuston turned to the veteran cinematographer Karl Freund, who had shot films for F.W. Murnau and Tod Browning and made his own legendary horror movie The Mummy (1932). Freund’s familiar, unique way with visual textures, using chiaroscuro sparingly and with a curiously soft and powdery feel for light and shadow, help Huston imbue overtones of the mystical in the otherwise clammy drama. The furore of the hurricane crashing down on the keys anticipates the war-with-chaotic-nature metaphors of Moby Dick and The Bible…In The Beginning (1966), as the gangsters squirm through the night of its blasting force, scared by something larger than themselves and heedless of their insectoid infestation, even as the storm is also correlated with their brief reign of power. The death of the Osceolas is the film’s most vital visual interlude and one that also, given the socio-historical slant Huston has invested throughout, wields a deliberate associative power. The Seminoles have been waiting out the storm, shown earlier by Huston as the people wither and cringe under the onslaught of the weather, itself a powerfully suggestive image of those neglected and left out of the political process. The Sheriff, on the warpath after finding Sawyer’s body and reacting to Rocco’s wily miscue, marches out to the dock with his torch shining and gun drawn, picking out the grim faces of the tribe until catching sight of the Osceolas, who dash off into the dark only for the sheriff to gun them down.\n\nHuston here manages to conflate many lines of enquiry. The image of the man of authority, picking out the faces of the insulted and injured gazing back sullenly with his torch, evokes both the imagery of the just-repressed fascist yolk, and of a more immediate, local, and ever-ongoing test of will between those imposing order and those seeking a chance. The ease with which the otherwise easy-going and liberal-minded sheriff is turned into murderous weapon by Rocco’s quick-witted exploitation of an existing tension is also just as pointed, as the association of Rocco with the dark side of politics is extended to make him a skilful in distraction through scapegoating. Finally the buyer for Rocco’s counterfeit dosh, Ziggy (Marc Lawrence), turns up and the trade is made, although Rocco is happy to let Ziggy get scooped up by the cops. When morning finally comes with the storm wilted and the shore a morass of rubbish and corpses, Rocco finds the captain of the yacht (Alberto Morin) who was supposed to take the gangsters back to Cuba has fled in fright not of the storm but of Rocco, so McCloud is obliged, under pain of threatened torture (“You’ll start asking yourself questions like – ‘What if I come out of this a cripple?’” Rocco assures McCloud), to take command of Temple’s cabin cruiser. The voyage means sailing through murky fog, again charged with a certain symbolic import – after the chaos, uncertainty – that is then transmuted into something transcendental at the very end, when Nora opens the hotel windows to let in streaming, revivifying sunlight, and McCloud sails back to her, emerging from the glistening fog."
