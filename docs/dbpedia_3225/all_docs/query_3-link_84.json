        "text": "We asked historian Susan Fernandez, co-author (with Robert Ingalls) of “Sunshine in the Dark: Florida in the Movies” to suggest five Florida films people should watch.\n\n“These may not be the best films made in terms of artistry (or familiarity — I don’t include ‘Key Largo’), but I think they each represent something significant about films and about Florida.”\n\nHere are her five suggestions and what she had to say about them:\n\n1. “Sunshine State” (2002)\n\nA stellar cast that explores ethnicity, class, generational conflicts and the “meaning” of development through both comedy and drama. Set in two small communities with families confronting their pasts, present and future.\n\n2. “Adaptation” (2002)\n\nL. Paatsch, an Australian critic, wrote that this film “Blurs the lines between truth, fiction and bald-faced lies.” Based on Susan Orlean’s book, “The Orchid Thief,” I found it a strange and captivating take on the creative process, filmmaking, and the joy and danger of obsession.\n\n3. “Body Heat” (1981)\n\nThis was one of the first Florida noir films — and the best known — with an enjoyable story line, dialogue and cast. It was the first film to centralize the Florida climate, and make the viewer almost feel it.\n\n4. “Rosewood” (1997)\n\nA film that needs to be seen not for its historical accuracy but for a seldom-discussed part of Florida history. I think it is also useful for other reasons: to encourage more research into the subject matter — and the web has an abundance of information on what “really” happened — and to learn about other race massacres that occurred then and later.\n\n5. “Moonlight” (2016)\n\nThe themes in this more recent award-winning film could have dissolved into standard cliches or tropes in another director’s hands but should be appreciated for its sensitive and bold portrayal of a subject other movies have avoided. Also wonderful casting and cinematography. ¦"
