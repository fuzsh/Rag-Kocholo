        "text": "There are so many wonderful things to do in Key Largo. As the northernmost island in the Florida Keys, getting here from Miami is a piece of cake. Or should I say a piece of key lime pie?\n\nThe most easily accessible of the Florida Keys, Key Largo is an island brimming with stunning natural wonders.\n\nSurrounded by Florida Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Key Largo is more than just a line in a Beach Boys song — it’s the Dive Capital of the World! This island is home to the first undersea park in the United States and the world’s second-largest artificial reef.\n\nEven if you don’t dive — and I don’t — you still stand to encounter a lot of wildlife in Key Largo through snorkeling, glass bottom boat tours, kayaking, paddleboarding, and sailing trips. You could see sea turtles, tropical fish, manatees, dolphins, and tarpon, just to start! The beaches in Key Largo are truly a gateway to another world.\n\nWhile most things to do in Key Largo revolve around the water, hiking and cycling are other fun ways of seeing the scenery. At eye level, the northernmost key is awash with palm trees, mangroves, hammock forest.\n\nIn addition to eating ALL the key lime pie, you’ll find only the freshest seafood on sale in Key Largo. Wash it down with a craft beer or tiki cocktail as you watch the most gorgeous sunsets in the Sunshine State.\n\nLet’s dive into the best things to do in Key Largo — for water fans as well as landlubbers!\n\nThis post was published in January 2024 and was co-written by Adventurous Kate and Hannah Cooper.\n\nBest Things To Do in Key Largo, Florida\n\nVisit the John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park\n\nSpending time in John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park is an excellent way to start your time in Key Largo. The first underwater park in the United States protects around 70 nautical square miles of living coral reefs and marine life. It also has two lovely beaches, an aquarium, and a campground.\n\nThe state park sits next to the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, where there are further coral reefs plus mangrove forests. These warm waters are best explored via snorkeling or scuba diving although glass-bottom boat tours and kayaking are other options.\n\nThis snorkel tour in John Pennekamp State Park is my favorite activity I did in Key Largo. The tour takes you to two shallow sites which usually include Christ of the Abyss (an underwater Jesus statue) and/or the Grecian Rocks. You have about 90 minutes in the water overall.\n\nExplore Nature in Key Largo\n\nIf Miami has the monopoly on sandy beaches, Key Largo is all about the wildlife – we’re talking marine, mammal, reptilian, bird, the whole nine yards! So where are the best places to see wildlife in the area?\n\nWindley Key Fossil Reef Geological State Park has five entry-level hiking trails along mangrove swamps and the world’s only fossilized coral reef. Swing by the visitor center for a history lesson.\n\nUp in North Key Largo, past the bridge that connects you to the mainland, Dagny Johnson Key Largo Hammock Botanical State Park is a floral wonderland. Keep an eye peeled for American crocodiles as you stroll through its vast West Indian tropical hardwood hammock. This is one of the few places in the Keys where these crocodiles live.\n\nA mile south brings you to Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge, although it’s more like a butterfly park. There are some American crocodiles nesting in the saltwater mangrove swamps as well.\n\nOrnithophiles can visit Laura Quinn Wild Bird Sanctuary (also known as the Florida Keys Wild Bird Center). This reserve rehabilitates and releases wounded birds and has a lovely boardwalk trail through the mangroves. It’s free to visit but a donation of $10 per person is appreciated.\n\nTake a Boat Trip in Key Largo\n\nA boat trip is a rite of passage for all travelers in Key Largo! And, you have a slew of options, from family-friendly excursions and wildlife-watching boat rides to booze cruises and historic barges.\n\nLet’s start with the iconic African Queen Canal Cruise. This steamboat was the star of the eponymous movie starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, and is available for shared and private sails along the Port Largo Canals.\n\nHopping aboard a glass-bottom boat tour in Key Largo is a great way to eyeball the underwater national parks’ coral reefs and marine life without getting wet! A great option for non-swimmers who want to see some underwater wildlife. The tour includes a narration of the coral reef.\n\nIf mammals float your boat, you must go dolphin- and manatee-watching in the Keys. This eco-tour in Key Largo is capped at six participants for a more intimate experience. The same operator runs a sunset cruise in Florida Bay.\n\nThis catamaran sunset cruise is another option for more of a party spirit. It’s a BYOB setup, so bring a bottle or two — and guests are always full of praise for the soundtrack!\n\nLast but not least, a private sunset cruise is one of the most unique things to do in Key Largo for couples or small groups. You’ll have the boat all to yourselves for that castaway vibe.\n\nGo Scuba Diving or Snorkeling\n\nYou can’t go to Key Largo, the Dive Capital of the World, and not explore beneath the surface! Popular dive sites include the USS Spiegel Grove shipwreck and its artificial reef system. There’s also an underwater statue of Jesus, called Christ of the Abyss, where sea turtles are often spotted.\n\nThis snorkel trip in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and John Pennekamp Coral Reef is designed for beginners. These shallow waters only require a basic swimming ability.\n\nExperienced snorkelers might prefer this two-reef snorkel tour in Key Largo. Locations vary, but typically include the Christ of the Abyss and the Grecian Rocks.\n\n(First time snorkeling? Make sure you wear a rash guard and use reef safe sunscreen. It’s so easy to get sunburned through the water, especially when your back is constantly facing upward.)\n\nAre you a diver? This guided two-tank shallow diving experience includes Christ of the Abyss (sometimes called Christ of the Deep), the Grecian Rocks, the City of Washington, and/or The Elbow Reef. If you’re a more experienced diver, this two-dive excursion in the Florida Marine Sanctuary goes a little deeper.\n\nWant to learn to dive? Great idea! Learn to scuba dive in Key Largo and you’ll never look back. This Discover Scuba Diving commences in the pool before hitting two open-water dive spots. It’s perfect if you want to test the waters before getting qualified.\n\nEnjoy Key Largo Beaches\n\nYou have probably come to the Florida Keys to enjoy all the beaches — and Key Largo definitely has some nice contenders among the best beaches in the Florida Keys!\n\nOne thing you should know is that many of Key Largo’s beaches are private to hotels and homes. That said, there are a few public beaches that are especially nice.\n\nSome of the nicest beaches with public access are in John Pennekamp State Park. I recommend checking out Far Beach and Cannon Beach, which are both family-friendly with snorkeling opportunities nearby.\n\nA unique option is Rowell’s Waterfront Park, which has a 10-foot-deep tidal pool you can jump into.\n\nAnd just down the road in Tavernier, you have Harry Harris Park with its perennially popular beach!\n\nExperience Jules Undersea Lodge\n\nA truly unique kind of accommodation, Jules Undersea Lodge is a great place to stay in Key Largo if you know how to dive. This is an underwater hotel and access means scuba diving into an airlock chamber!\n\nOnce you’re tucked up nice and dry in the suite, you can watch parrot fish, barracuda, and – if you’re really lucky – manatees swim past from bed. Lodging is only available to certified divers or those who enroll in the Discover Scuba Diving course.\n\nHonestly, if I stayed here I wouldn’t sleep a wink the whole night (I’ve watched too many disaster movies) — but I can completely understand how this would be a bucket list item for divers.\n\nIf you don’t want to sleep over (starting at $1,350 per night, this is definitely a once-in-a-lifetime splurge!) you can just dive or snorkel in the lagoon. Snorkeling costs $15 per person while all-day diving is from $40. If the underwater suite is vacant, you can peer through the window while diving.\n\nTry all of the Key Lime Pie\n\nWith all the outdoor adventures, you’ll build up an appetite in Key Largo — and that calls for key lime pie! You may have had key lime before, but trust me — it’s so much better in the Florida Keys. The pies are made from limes indigenous to this region.\n\nMrs. Mac’s Kitchen in Key Largo is home to my favorite key lime pie in the Florida Keys. I make sure to stop here whenever I’m in the Keys. The OG diner sits on the southbound side of the Overseas Highway, while the larger restaurant is on the northbound side. Their flawless key lime pie is reason enough to pull over, but the diner also serves fresh seafood and comfort food.\n\nFish House is another favorite among locals for key lime pie and fresh dishes plucked from the sea. The coconut version is a radical take on the classic, but so delicious. This is located alongside the overseas highway, between Key Largo and the Florida mainland, so it makes a good stop on your way to or from Miami.\n\nVisit Keys’ Meads\n\nIf you’re familiar with the craft spirits revolution, you may have heard of mead — a honey wine popular in medieval times that is making a comeback today. If you’re interested in trying some, head over to Keys’ Meads, a meadery right here in Key Largo!\n\nMead is similar to port — you pour yourself a small glass and enjoy the flavors. Keys’ Meads makes mead in sweet, semi-sweet, and dry flavors like orange blossom, plum, starfruit, holiday spiced apple pie (which I really enjoyed!), and mango.\n\nThe tasting room is open from 12-8 PM Monday through Saturday, and 12-6 PM on Sundays. They also ship — so if you’re traveling carry-on only and can’t bring a bottle home, they’ll gladly send one to your house!\n\nCoral Restoration Foundation\n\nThe Coral Restoration Foundation is located in Tavernier, just outside Key Largo, and they’re doing inspiring work repairing the coral reefs in the area. You can drop in and learn about the important work they’re doing.\n\nSince 2007, they’ve returned more than 220,000 critically endangered corals back to the reefs in the Florida Keys.\n\nIf you’re a diver, you can even volunteer with them, replanting new coral in the reefs!\n\nExplore the Florida Keys Overseas Heritage Trail\n\nStart your day with a stroll or cycle along the Florida Keys Overseas Heritage Trail.\n\nRunning parallel to the U.S. Highway 1, this 106-mile multi-use trail links Key Largo with Key West through a series of 23 historic Flagler Railroad bridges. Construction is still ongoing, but over 90 miles are completed.\n\nWhile some hardcore cyclists tackle the entire highway all the way to mile marker 0 in Key West, you can have just as much fun covering a few sections of the trail.\n\nYou can rent bikes from All Keys Cycles or Key Largo Bike and Adventure Tours, or ebikes from Bike the FL Keys. While I love ebikes for the extra bit of power they give you going up hills, there aren’t that many hills in the Florida Keys! It’s nice to have the extra oomph on a hot day, though.\n\nPicking a segment between mile markers 106.5 and 60 is the best option in Key Largo. This incorporates John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park and a bit of Islamorada before ending in Long Key (and passing some of the best Florida Keys beaches).\n\nKayak or paddleboard through the mangroves\n\nThe mangroves in and around Key Largo are a paddler’s paradise — and exploring them is one of the most special things to do in Key Largo. These mangroves are the natural habitat for invertebrates, turtles, birds, and even manatees.\n\nIf you fancy exploring independently, just arrange an all-day kayak rental or an all-day paddleboard rental. Instruction is provided before you launch and the crew can suggest the best mangroves and lagoons based on your level of ability.\n\nOtherwise, this guided two-hour eco-tour is suitable for all skill levels and welcomes family groups and solo travelers. It concentrates on Tavernier Creek and you have the choice of taking a kayak or paddleboard. Lighted crafts are available for sunset or twilight paddles.\n\nDrink on a floating tiki bar\n\nKey Largo is the perfect place for twirling an umbrella in a tropical cocktail. But happy hour gets an upgrade in the Sunshine State courtesy of a floating hut!\n\nThese guys run shared and private tiki cruises with specialty options for the likes of birthday parties, bachelorettes, and one-of-a-kind engagements. Departing from Snooks Bayside or Sundowners in Key Largo, the tiki fun cruise floats during the day whereas the sunset tiki cruise is timed for golden hour.\n\nAll of these are BYOB cruises, so you’ll have to remember to swing by the liquor store and make your own daiquiris. Both tours let you stream your favorite tunes with an iPad. Note that the capacity is a maximum of six people.\n\nGo fishing\n\nFishing for mahi mahi, snapper, tarpon, and wahoo is one of the most popular things to do in Key Largo. People come from all over the world come to Key Largo to fish in the rich waters here, and locals love it, too!\n\nThis private fishing charter adventure is perfect for families and groups. It’s a full-day excursion with a professional captain. The crew deals with all permits and the boat is stocked with fishing equipment, bait, tackle, and snorkel gear. Non-fishers are welcome – you can even spend the day just sailing if you’d like.\n\nAlternatively, this private chartered fishing charter for two is aimed at couples. The captain provides a lesson in fishing for the tarpon shoals that migrate between the Florida Keys and Everglades National Park.\n\nRent a jet ski\n\nJet skiing is one of the most thrilling water sports in the Florida Keys. It’s easy to rent a jet ski and explore the bays independently — newbies will have an introduction on how to enjoy yourself while keeping wildlife safe. This should give you all the knowledge and confidence you need.\n\nAlternatively, this guided jet ski tour still puts you in the driver’s seat, but you’ll have a guide to follow. The typical itinerary starts at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park and follows through Blackwater Sound. Tours run all day and sunrise options are available.\n\nOtherwise, this daytime or sunset jet ski tour is a private activity for couples and groups. The route focuses on the best places in Key Largo for spotting wildlife.\n\nExplore Islamorada and the Upper Keys\n\nIslamorada, the “Village of Islands,” is just about a 20-minute drive from Key Largo. With so many cool activities, a day trip here is one of the top things to do in Key Largo. Starting with a pit stop at one of the best Key Largo beaches on the way, of course!\n\nHarry Harris Park has a sandy beach, tidal swimming pool, playground, boat ramp, and picnic tables. It’s tempting to spend a whole day there, but you’re only five minutes north of the Laura Quinn Wild Bird Sanctuary.\n\nHand-feeding the tarpon at Robbie’s is a classic — you buy a bucket of small fish and feed them to the giant tarpon in the water! No matter where you’re visiting in the Florida Keys, I think this activity is a must! It only costs $2.50 to access the dock and $5 for a bucket of feed. Watch out for the pelicans — they know you’re holding a bucket of delicious fish!\n\nRobbie’s is an awesome place for water activities and to eat, and another nice spot for a meal is Marker 88. This beachfront grill serves seafood and tiki cocktails with regular live music. It fills up at sunset but has a great atmosphere.\n\nIt only takes an hour to tour the History of Diving Museum. This is a treasure trove of relics and equipment tracing the evolution of underwater exploration and scuba diving for fun.\n\nRound off a day in Islamorada with a craft beer inspired by the local area at Florida Keys Brewing Company. The cheekily-named brews, live music, backyard games, and food trucks make this one of the best places to hang out in the Keys. And don’t miss the surrounding galleries and studios that are part of the Morada Way Arts District.\n\nRead More: 22 Fun Things to Do in Islamorada, Florida Keys\n\nTake a day trip to Everglades National Park\n\nIf you’re in Key Largo and you have a car, you can easily add on a day trip to the Everglades National Park — the largest tropical wilderness in the continental United States. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve, and a Wetland of International Importance.\n\nThe Everglades begin about a 45-minute drive from Key Largo and extend outward from there.\n\nOne of the best ways of exploring the park’s mangroves and wetlands is via airboat. The Everglades National Park airboat tour and wildlife show is the safest way to look for alligators and crocodiles. This ride lasts 30-40 minutes and is fully narrated.\n\nOn top of the tour, you’ll need to pay an admission fee of $30 per vehicle/$15 per pedestrian for entry.\n\nTake a day trip to Miami\n\nIt might sound counterintuitive if you’re flying into Miami and driving straight down to Key Largo, but hear me out! Key Largo is close enough to Miami that I don’t think it’s a waste to drive in for a day.\n\nI recommend taking time to explore Miami’s coolest neighborhoods — Wynwood and South Beach, which couldn’t be more different.\n\nMake buzzing South Beach at Miami Beach your destination for the day if you’re a beach bum. The sandy beach is like nothing you’ll see in the Florida Keys — South Beach is home to the best urban beaches in the US, in my opinion! The sand is white and soft, leading to the perfect turquoise water. South Beach is also home to lots of neat deco architecture.\n\nWhen you’re done soaking up the sun, stop off at artsy Wynwood. The Brooklyn of Miami is a happening spot flooded with murals, galleries, boutiques, and cafes. Pick up a flat white to go and lose yourself in this gigantic outdoor art installation.\n\nDrive time between Key Largo and Miami is around 90 minutes.\n\nTake a day trip to Key West\n\nShould you do a day trip to Key West from Key Largo? Honestly, I think you should spend at least a few days in Key West, because it’s such a cool town with so much to do!\n\nBut if you have a long time in Key Largo — say, five days to a week — and you don’t mind driving about two hours each way, you can definitely make a day trip to Key West work.\n\nI recommend starting early and coming back after sunset. My recommendations would be to visit one of the historic homes: either the Hemingway House (with the six-toed cats!) or Truman’s Little White House; spend time walking down Duval Street and enjoying the merriment, and taking in the sunset celebration at Mallory Square.\n\nThere are plenty of other things to do in Key West, from beach-hopping and boat rides to some of the craziest festivals around (and I’ve been to one of the best, the Hemingway Lookalike Contest) — so I hope you come back for a much longer trip!\n\nHow Much Time to Spend in Key Largo\n\nWith two or three days, you can see all there is to see in Key Largo, plus a good about of the attractions in nearby Islamorada, too. That’s if you’re planning a more active trip with a busy itinerary.\n\nHowever, you could easily spend a week or more in this part of the Florida Keys. The Keys are all about relaxing and taking it slow, and you can definitely do that here! There are tons of activities to fill your days with and it’s always nice to have a day or two for enjoying downtime on the beach.\n\nA longer itinerary makes day trips the Everglades, Miami, and/or Key West more feasible, as you won’t feel like you’re missing out on Key Largo itself.\n\nHow to Get to Key Largo\n\nMiami International Airport (MIA) is the gateway to Key Largo and the Florida Keys. This is a big, international airport with lots of flight options and connections. From here it takes about 90 minutes to drive to Key Largo. Buses operated by Greyhound and FlixBus run between the Intermodal Center and Key Largo but only in the morning.\n\nKey West International Airport (EYW) is another option, about two hours from Key Largo, although there are significantly fewer flight options. If you’re starting or ending your trip in Key West, this can be a good option. Sometimes I fly into Miami and out of Key West.\n\nBuses and Uber do operate throughout the Keys, but this is very much a driving destination, and renting a car will make your life much easier. Find deals on rental cars here.\n\nWhere to Stay in Key Largo\n\nThere are hotels dotted along either side of the Overseas Highway throughout Key Largo. If you’re set on beach time, it’s definitely worth booking accommodation with a private beach, as public beaches on the island are few and far between.\n\nLuxury: The Kona Kai Resort and Gallery is a dreamy adults-only property set amid a botanical garden next to mile marker 98. Tropical bungalows grant easy access to the Florida Bay where you can paddle, swim, and surrender to gorgeous sunsets. I stayed here and really enjoy it!\n\nMidrange: You can bring the whole gang to the Atlantic Bay Resort in Tavernier and splurge on one of the beachfront suites or cottages. All of these have kitchen facilities and access to the hotel’s private beach overlooking the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBudget: The Seafarer Key Largo Resort and Beach is the perfect place to stay in the Keys on a budget. It’s basically a motel but with the soothing sound of ocean waves replacing the usual highway rabble! Breakfast is on the house and there are free kayaks for guests.\n\nFind deals on places to stay in Key Largo here.\n\nBest Time to Visit Key Largo\n\nSpring is the best time to visit Key Largo (and the rest of the Florida Keys). The winter sun frenzy peters off after the holidays with March, April, and May offering mild weather and affordable accommodation plus fewer other tourists hogging the pool.\n\nTemperatures hover around the 70s and 80s and the humidity drops to bearable. Any rainfall will be short and sweet; use the excuse for a pre-sunset nap. And I think this is a perfect time for swimming in the water! Winter can be a little on the chilly side at times.\n\nThe worst time to visit Key Largo is during the hurricane season. This season technically runs from June until November although tropical cyclones are most common in September and October.
