        "text": "Last Updated on April 3, 2024\n\nThis post contains some affiliate links. If you make a purchase through these links, I receive a small commission at NO EXTRA COST TO YOU.\n\nSome destinations are best explored on a road trip and Florida Keys are definitely that kind of place. A chain of islands that stretch for 110 miles, starting 15 miles south of Miami all the way to Key West. While Miami doesn’t suffer from the lack of visitors, and Key West gets most of the attention in the Keys, there’s a whole world in between those two, that is worth exploring. The best way to do it is by car, allowing you to make multiple stops along the way. Miami to Key West road trip is without a doubt one of the best and most scenic in the country.\n\nThere’s a lot to love about Florida Keys: low key island vibe, fresh seafood, key lime pie and spectacular sunsets. As soon as we left Miami, I couldn’t help but notice, that the Keys have a very different vibe from the rest of the Sunshine state. It reminded me more of the Caribbean than mainland Florida. Driving the Overseas Highway from Miami to Key West, especially the Seven Mile Bridge, is an attraction on its own.\n\nMiami to Key West road trip – how long is it?\n\nMost people fly into either Miami or Fort Lauderdale Airport, rent a car and start making their way down. The driving distance from Miami to Key West is 160 miles. If you go directly, it takes about 4 hours to cover that distance, assuming there’s no traffic. But heavy traffic and back ups are not unusual. Stretches of US Highway 1, which runs down the Florida Keys, are one lane in both direction, which often causes delays.\n\nAs you start driving down the Overseas Highway, you will notice small green and white signs with numbers. There are so called Mile Markers ( MM ), a system used in Florida Keys alongside addresses along Rt 1. It starts in Florida City with MM 126 and ends with MM 0 in Key West.\n\nIf you need a rental car, Discover Cars is a good site to find the best deal. It’s a price comparison website, which means it searches all the big rental companies to find the best prices.\n\nMiami to Key West stops on the map\n\nWhere to stop driving from Miami to Key West\n\nKey Largo\n\nOur first stop in the Upper Keys was Key Largo, the biggest of the Keys stretching for over 30 miles. Florida Keys are famous for spectacular sunsets, and Key Largo is no exception.\n\nDistance from Miami to Key Largo: 62 miles / over 1 hour\n\nBest things to do in Key Largo\n\nStop at Alabama Jack’s for lunch\n\nAlabama Jack’s, a favorite dive bar among the locals and bikers, is a great first stop in Key Largo, before you embark on your Miami to Key West road trip. It has a typical for the Keys laid back vibe, and makes for a great introduction to the bar scene and drinking culture in Florida Keys. They are famous for their Conch fritters, but also have a quite extensive menu and a full bar.\n\nTo get to Alabama Jack’s, you will have to take a little detour off the Overseas Highway. The bar is located on Card Sound Road. You can’t miss it, it’s a shack, that sits on the water among the mangroves.\n\nLocation – 58000 Card Sound Road, Key Largo\n\nVisit John Pennekamp Coral Reef State park\n\nEstablished in 1963, John Pennekamp is the first underwater park in the US, covering some 70 nautical square miles. Although you can most definitely make a quick stop there to break up the drive, it’s best to spend a day, especially if you are staying in the area. Between swimming, snorkeling/diving, kayaking and hiking, you can easily spend an entire day at the park.\n\nEven though there’s plenty to do at the park, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park is best known as one of the top spots for diving and snorkeling. There are several beautiful reefs to explore with abundance of marine life. You can either book a short snorkeling trip or go on a diving adventure.\n\nIf you are into hiking there are three natural trails within the Park: Mangrove Trail, Wild Tamarind Trail and the Grove Trail.\n\nLocation – 102601 Overseas Highway (MM 102.5)\n\nOpening hours: the park is open daily from 8 am until sunset\n\nEntrance fee – $8 ( per vehicle )\n\nAfrican Queen boat\n\nThis one is going to make me sound like I’m a 100 years old, but I really enjoyed the ride on this historic boat. African Queen is a boat, that was made famous in the movie from 1951 featuring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. After years of serving as a working boat in Africa and all over the US, this iconic steam vessel has been repaired and is now located in Key Largo.\n\nThese days, the renovated boat is used to take tourist on a leisurely 90 minute cruise down the canals. It departs daily from Marina del Mar at 10 am, 12 pm, 2 pm, 4 pm and 6 pm. African Queen cruises tend to sell out, so be sure to pre-book yours on the official website. Even if you have no idea about its origin, it’s a great way to spend 1.5 hour on the water.\n\nLocation – 99701 Overseas Highway\n\nCost – $59\n\nWhere to eat and drink in Key Largo\n\nPilot House – a very popular restaurant/marina with a glass bottom bar. Some nights they have live music.\n\nKey Largo Fisheries Backyard Café – a great casual place by the Marina. This a working fishery/restaurant, so the seafood is as fresh as it gets.\n\nMrs Mac’s Kitchen – charming little cafe with awesome ambience, famous for great breakfast and Key Lime pie. There is a second Mrs Mac’s II, down the street, but if you want the eat at the original one, make sure to go to the one located at Market 99.3\n\nShipwreck’s Bar and Grill – a real fun, low key place with amazing sea food, right on the water.\n\nCaribbean Club – this local, waterfront bar perfectly represents the gritty side of the Keys. Very much a dive bar with live music 4 nights/week and killer sunset views. Its claim to fame is, that it served as an inspiration for the “Key Largo” movie. More recently, it can be seen in several scenes in “Bloodline”, as one of the favorite hangout spots. If you are a fan of the Netflix series, Caribbean Club is a must stop. It’s Cash only, but there’s an ATM inside.\n\nIslamorada\n\nIf you love fishing, Islamorada is a must stop on the Miami to Key West road trip. It’s known as the Sport fishing capital of the world, and there are plenty of boat charters available for fishing excursions. It’s very common for people to catch their own dinner, as a lot of restaurants in the area are happy to cook your fish for you.\n\nDistance from Key Largo to Islamorada: 16 miles / 25 min\n\nFor a more detailed Islamorada travel guide read Fun things to do in Islamorada, Florida besides fishing.\n\nBest things to do in Islamorada\n\nStop at Rain Barrel Village\n\nThere are a lot of quirky places in Florida Keys, and Rain Barrel Village is definitely one of them. It’s an open air market with a collection of small stores selling everything from art, to handmade crafts to clothes and snacks. Definitely a fun place to stop on your Miami to Key West drive, whether it’s just to browse or pick up a unique souvenir.\n\nRain Barrel Village is located at the Mile Marker 86.7 and it’s almost impossible to miss it, thanks to the 40 foot lobster sculpture up front. The giant Betsy the Lobster is not only a sign you found it, but also a great photo op.\n\nFeed tarpons at Robbie’s\n\nRobbie’s, one of the most popular places in Florida Keys, is definitely a must stop. It’s a busy marina with plenty of water activities available, but the reason most people stop by is to feed the tarpons. For a few dollars, you get a bucket of fish, then dangle them off the dock as the hungry tarpons leap out of the water and grab it out of your hand. As touristy as it as, it’s quite entertaining and a fun activity, that doesn’t cost much.\n\nAfter you are done feeding the tarpons, you can head to the Hungry Tarpon restaurant and watch others do the same, while having a bite to eat.\n\nLocation – 77522 Overseas Highway ( MM 77.5 )\n\nCost – $2.50 ( to go on the dock ) + $5 ( for a bucket of fish )\n\nSnorkel the Alligator Reef\n\nFlorida Keys are home to fantastic coral reef, so snorkeling is naturally one of the top things to do while you visit. In Islamorada, one of the top spots to enjoy underwater world is Alligator Reef, which is about 4 nautical miles off shore, right by the old lighthouse.\n\nPlenty of boat tour operators offer snorkeling excursions to Alligator Reef, but if you are already at Robbie’s, I recommend going with Sundance Watersports. They leave right from Robbie’s marina for a 2.5 hour snorkeling trip twice a day ( 10 am and 1.30 pm ).\n\nCost – $45/adult and $39/child under 12 years old ( plus $10 for snorkel gear if you need to rent it )\n\nWhere to eat in Islamorada\n\nMarker 88 – a great restaurant with spectacular views. The seating is basically right on the water.\n\nLazy Days – fun, ocean front restaurant with amazing sea food and fun atmosphere.\n\nLorelei Restaurant and Cabana Bar – fun, casual dining right on the water and one of the prime spots to watch the sunset. They don’t take reservations, so make sure to arrive on the earlier side to score a nice table.\n\nWhere to stay in Islamorada\n\nCasa Morada – this 16 suite boutique hotel is perfect for those who prefer smaller hotels to big resorts. It caters to adults only, so you are guaranteed a relaxing stay.\n\nPelican Cove Resort & Marina – this resort/marina is right on the water. With your stay you get access to its sister properties.\n\nCheeka Lodge Spa – if you are looking for some luxury, you can’t go wrong with this beautiful resort. Some of the amenities include a spa, a private fishing pier and a 9-hole golf course.\n\nMarathon\n\nRight in the middle of the Miami to Key West road trip is Marathon, a city set on 13 islands in Florida Keys. There are plenty of things to do in Marathon, so it’s a must stop on your drive from Miami to Key West. I recommend spending at least 2 days to take advantage of all the activities.\n\nBecause of its central location, Marathon is also a great base for exploring both Marathon and Islamorada, so if you’d like to stay put in one place for a few days and be able to experience both, Marathon is a great choice.\n\nDistance from Islamorada to Marathon: 30 miles / 40 min\n\nFor a more detailed guide check out The Ultimate Guide to visiting Marathon, Florida\n\nBest things to do in Marathon\n\nSombrero beach\n\nFlorida Keys, although beautiful, are not really famous for their beaches. Sombrero Beach in Marathon was as close to a classic white sand beach as I’ve come to in the Keys. It’s also quite big by Florida Keys standards. The beach is also dog friendly, so if you are traveling with your dog, he/she is more than welcome there.\n\nVisit Pigeon Key\n\nPigeon Key is a tiny piece of land sits under the old Seven Mile Bridge and is more than just a little oasis. The island played a significant role in the construction of Henry Flagler’s Overseas Railroad, as it used to house the workers.\n\nFor a few years, when the bridge was undergoing much needed restoration, the only way to get from Marathon to Pigeon Key, was by taking a ferry. Now, that the bridge is done and open, you have more than one way of getting there.\n\nFirst of all, the ferry got replaced by a little train, that takes you from the Visitors Center to the island on a narrated ride. The train runs 4 times daily at 10 am, 11.30 am, 1 pm and 2.30 pm. The price is $25 ( $20 for children ), which includes the roundtrip ride, a 1 hour guided tour of Pigeon Key and access to the museum on the island. You can get the tickets the day of at the Visitors Center, or get them online in advance.\n\nThe guided tour is optional, so if you prefer to explore on your own, you can certainly do that too. Your time on the island can be spent swimming, snorkeling or fishing ( bring your own gear ). There are also a couple of great spots to have a picnic or a drink with amazing views of the Seven Mile Bridge. Just keep in mind, there is nothing on the island ( other than restrooms and water fountain ), so make sure to pack snacks and drinks.\n\nNow that the bridge is open, you can also walk, run and bike to Pigeon Key. Just be aware, that if this is how you plan on getting there, you will still have to pay to access the island. It’s $15 for an adult or $12 for a child.\n\nWalk the Old Seven Mile Bridge\n\nThe many islands in the Keys are connected by 42 bridges, the biggest of them being Seven Mile bridge. This was the most scenic part of the drive, and the highlight of my Miami to Key West road trip. You drive surrounded by blue waters and the views are simply spectacular. For some great views of the actual bridge, make sure to pull over right before getting on it.\n\nThe Florida Keys used to be connected by the Overseas Railway, until the devastating hurricane hit the Keys and destroyed it in 1935. The railway got replaced by the highway, but parts of the old bridge remained and became a favorite spot for runners, bikers and fishermen. But time took its toll and the bridge closed for much needed renovations in 2017. Fast forward a few years, and as of January 2022, the bridge is open again.\n\nThe 2.2 mile stretch of the Old Seven Mile bridge is a great stop on your Miami to Key West drive, even just for a little stroll. The newly reconstructed bridge goes from Marathon all the way to Pigeon Key, so if you are up for a longer walk, that’s how you can now get to the historic island.\n\nLocation: the bridge is at located at MM 47\n\nVisit Turtle Hospital\n\nVisiting the Turtle Hospital is an absolute must during your stay in Marathon. This is a wonderful place, full of dedicated workers, that rescue and rehabilitate sick and injured turtles before releasing them back into the wild. Their amazing work is possible thanks to the admission price paid by visitors, so I cannot encourage you enough to put it on your Florida Keys itinerary.\n\nTurtle Hospital is a working hospital, so you can’t just roam around on your own, you can only visit on a guided tour. They are offered several times a day and last a little over 1 hour. Making a reservation is highly recommended, as they often sell out, which is amazing, since the admission is the main source of money for the hospital. Your tour will start with a short presentation about the turtles and the problems they are facing. They have a success rate of 80%, but there are some permanent residents, that will never be able to return to the wild. The most famous of them is Bubble Butt, named for his deformity, and has been in the hospital since 1989. You get to meet him as well as many other turtles.\n\nIf you’d like to further support the amazing work the hospital does, you can adopt one of the turtles for $35/ year. This obviously does not mean you get to take the turtle home, but that your contribution goes towards the care they require. These are the turtles, that sustained serious injuries, that prevent them from ever returning to the wild.\n\nLocation – 2396 Overseas Highway, Marathon ( MM 48.5 )\n\nAdmission – $35 ( $17.50 for children )/ guided tours from 9 am to 4 pm every half hour\n\nWhere to eat in Marathon\n\nPorky’s Bayside – a very popular seafood place. It’s one of the restaurants in the Keys, that encourages you to bring your own catch of the day, and they will happily cook it for you.\n\nCastaway – waterfront restaurant with fresh seafood, sushi and 52 beers on tap. Even though it’s a casual place, it’s one of the most popular restaurants in Marathon, so reservations are recommended.\n\nMarathon Grill and Alehouse – great food and an amazing selection of craft beers.\n\nKeys Fisheries – this place is an absolute must when you’re in Marathon. You order at the window and can either eat there or take with you. There is also the Upstairs bar serving $3 Stone Crab Claws in season ( mid October until mid May ).\n\nWhere to stay in Marathon\n\nCaptain Pip’s Marina & Hideaway – this is a hidden gem in Marathon. It’s a great value for what’s offered. Great location ( a few restaurants within walking distance ) and amenities. There are kayaks, paddle boards and jet skis right on site for rent. They also offer daily snorkeling trips to Sombrero Reef and Pirate’s Cove.\n\nCourtyard by Marriott Marathon Florida Keys – this is one of the nicest properties in Florida Keys. The rooms are large and comfortable, there are 2 pools with one infinity pool overlooking the ocean, as well as hot tub and poolside bar.\n\nTranquility Bay Beachfront Resort – another beautiful property in the heart of Florida Keys, right on a private beach. You can choose from guest rooms or beach houses. There are 3 pools on the property, one of them adults only, as well as on site water sports.\n\nBig Pine Key\n\nBig Pine Key is part of Lower Keys and the last big Key before you reach Key West. It’s quiet, laid back and the total opposite of what you will experience in the Conch Republic. I highly recommend making a stop there on your Miami to Key West road trip.\n\nDistance from Marathon to Big Pine Key: 21 miles / 25 minutes\n\nVisit Key Deer Refuge\n\nThe main reason I wanted to visit Big Pine Key was its adorable residents: Key Deer. The miniature kind of deer can only be found in Florida Keys, mostly in Big Pine Key and the nearby No Name Key. Once on the brink of extinction, their population went up to about 800 in recent years, however they are still endangered. Key Deer Refuge played a crucial role in increasing the key deer population, and you can learn all about it on your visit. They are open Monday – Saturday 10 am – 3 pm.\n\nHowever, Key Deer Refuge is not the only place you can encounter the adorable and tiny deer. You can spot them all over Big Pine Key, at the most random places, so keep your eyes open. They roam the streets, stand on the side of the road and walk through people’s yards and parking lots. They are most active at dawn and dusk, but you are also very likely to see them mid day.\n\nEven tough their population has increased, Key deer still face a lot of challenges. One of them is getting hit by cars, which is the number one cause of death. That’s why it’s so important for people to obey the speed limits and and pay attention, especially when driving after dark, when the key deer are the most active.\n\nStop at Blue Hole\n\nBlue Hole is a nice, quick stop if you enjoy nature and wildlife. It’s a limestone quarry where you can spot turtles, iguanas and even an alligator lounging on the big rock. There is a trail, but parts of it are closed, so the walk itself is rather short.\n\nBoth Blue Hole and Key Deer Refuge are great and easy stops in Big Pine Key while driving from Miami to Key West. But if you’d like a more informative and guided tour of both, as well as Bahia Honda State Park, you sure will enjoy this small group Florida Keys Nature & History Tour from Key West. In close to 4 hours, you will visit all the above mentioned places with a knowledgeable guide, and learn about the history of this part of the Keys. Great way to spend a few hours.\n\nStop at No Name Pub\n\nIf you’ve made it this far on your Miami to Key West drive, you know by now, that Florida Keys has a lot of dive bars. There are a lot of great ones, but the award for the coolest one goes to No Name Pub in Big Pine Key. Located a few miles off the main road, basically in the middle of nowhere, it’s the oldest bar in Big Pine Key. It started back in 1931 as a general store and a bait shop, with the pub added on 5 years later.\n\nNo Name Pub is definitely a must visit, mostly for its ambience, as the interior walls are completely covered in dollar bills. It seems like there’s not even an inch left to add more. For those who prefer outdoor seating, there is also a patio out back.\n\nLocation – 30813 Watson Blvd, Big Pine Key\n\nOpen – Monday – Sunday 11 am – 10 pm\n\nKey West\n\nReaching the 0 marker indicated the end of our Miami to Key West road trip. We got to the southernmost point of the country and the most popular of the Keys. At this point we were closer to Cuba than mainland Miami.\n\nKey West is unlike any place I’ve been to. It’s a very relaxed and open minded place, famous for its lively night life and colorful conch houses. If I was going to describe it in one word, “quirky” would be the most fitting. A lot of the things might strike you as odd on the first day, but give it another one and they become quite normal. Chickens roaming everywhere, eccentric house decorations, conch covered cars and dogs on scooters. Out of all the places I’ve been to, Key West was also the most dog friendly.\n\nDistance from Big Pine Key: 30 miles/45 min\n\nFor a more detailed Key West guide, check out Best things to do in Key West – the perfect guide for a first time visitor.\n\nBest things to do in Key West\n\nStroll Duval Street\n\nDuval Street in the most popular and touristy street in Key West, sort of an equivalent of the Bourbon Street in New Orleans. Only a little smaller and MUCH cleaner. It’s where the most action is, with many bars, outdoor cafes and quirky stores. You can’t miss one of the most iconic bars on Duval street: Sloppy Joe’s. It was Hemingway’s favorite hangout spot.\n\nTake a picture at Southernmost Point buoy\n\nWill it even count that you went to Key West if you didn’t get a picture next to the Southernmost Point Buoy? I think not. The giant colorful buoy serves as a reminder, that while in Key West, you are only 90 miles away from Cuba, which is closer than to mainland Florida. It’s a popular photo op, so unless you show up early in the morning, expect to wait in line.\n\nTake a tour of Ernest Hemingway’s house\n\nThe writer was one of the famous people, who made Key West their home. He lived in his Key West house for a decade, but kept it till his death. The house is now US National Historic Landmark and it’s open to visitors.\n\nIf you are a cat lover, you’ll especially enjoy the visit, because there are about 50 of them living in the house. They are the descendants of Hemingway’s cat Snow White he received as a gift. Snow White was polydactyl, in simpler words: it had 6 toes, an abnormality you will notice in about half the cats currently living in the house.\n\nLocation – 907 Whitehead St\n\nAdmission – ticket costs $18 ( includes a 30 minute guided tour). Tickets are only available at the main gate.\n\nClimb to the top of Key West lighthouse\n\nRight across the street from Hemingway’s house, there’s the Key West Lighthouse. For $17 ( or $15.50 online ) you can climb 88 steps to the top for some nice views. There is also small museum on site, if you are interested in its history.\n\nTry Key Lime pie\n\nKey lime pie is the official dessert of the Keys, and it’s almost obligatory to try it at least once when you visit. Finding it is not a problem, because it’s served literally everywhere.\n\nWatch the sunset at Mallory Square\n\nSunsets in the Keys are a big deal, and in Key West they become quite a celebration. Mallory Square is the top spot for sunset viewing, and every evening the plaza fills with street performers, artists and food vendors.\n\nGo on a Sunset cruise\n\nAn even better way to watch the sunset is from a sailing boat. You really can’t beat being right out on the water, watching the sun set, while sipping a drink and listening to live music. Sunset cruises are very popular in Key West, so there are many companies to choose from.\n\nI highly recommend booking this sunset cruise with Fury Adventures, which is a 2 hour catamaran cruise, that includes an open bar, snacks and a live band. It’s one of the top rated sunset cruises in Key West. I can’t think of a better way to end a long day of sightseeing.\n\nWhere to eat in Key West\n\nBlue Heaven – if you ask for a restaurant recommendation in Key West, everyone will tell you to go to Blue Heaven, and they will be right. This is a great outdoor restaurant with amazing food, and live music at times. Also, it is dog friendly.\n\nAndy’s Cabana – right across the street from Blue Heaven is this little spot, owned by the same people who own Blue Heaven. It’s an outdoor place with a small menu and a great vibe. We had a drink here while waiting for our table at Blue Heaven, and ended up returning a couple more times.\n\nWhere to stay in Key West\n\nKey West is not a cheap place, and that applies especially to hotels. If you want to be close to all the action and within a walking distance to most Key West attractions, be prepared to pay for it. Accommodations will be cheaper a bit further away from the downtown area, but you will have to add the cost of getting around.\n\nSouthernmost House Hotel – beautiful, adults only, beach front hotel located on the lower end of Duval Street. Close enough to many attractions, but removed enough to ensure some quiet and relaxation.\n\nMarquesa Hotel – small boutique hotel with 2 pools, beautiful grounds, just a block away from Duval Street. It’s one of the highest rated hotels in Key West, and it’s it’s easy to see why.\n\nAmsterdam Curry Mansion Inn – gorgeous, historic B&B steps away from Mallory Square, Duval Street and all the action. The rooms are beautiful and spacious, there is a small pool and parking is free, which is not always the case with Key West accommodations.\n\nParrot Key Hotel & Villas – this recently renovated hotel is a great choice if you want to be removed from the commotion of Duval Street and close to Smathers Beach.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFun things to do in Islamorada, Florida besides fishing\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to visiting Marathon, Florida\n\nBest things to do in Key West – the perfect guide for a first time visitor"
