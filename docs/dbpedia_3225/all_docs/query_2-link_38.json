        "text": "Posted by Ra Moon\n\nTrouble in paradise - set in a gorgeous wonderland, the locations featured in the series can become hell for a dysfunctional wealthy family.\n\nBloodline was almost entirely filmed in Islamorada, situated midway between Miami and Key West, on the tropical archipelago of the Florida Keys.\n\nThe Rayburns live in a superb waterfront house surrounded by lush nature and dark secrets.\n\nIt's almost impossible to take sides with any character of the show - as almost everybody has something to hide. This prevents the family from fully enjoying the sensational outdoors where this Netflix production is set.\n\nThe cast is headed by Kyle Chandler as John Rayburn, Ben Mendelsohn as Danny, Linda Cardellini as Meg, Norbert Leo Butz as Kevin, and Jacinda Barrett as Diana.\n\nWe tried to keep spoilers at bay in this guide to the filming locations of the three seasons of Bloodline.\n\nThe Bloodline locations\n\nEvery episode includes spectacular low-flying aerial shots of the Sunshine State keys.\n\nThe Overseas Highway carries the U.S. Route 1, running from Key Largo to Key West for 113 miles.\n\nThis iconic and scenic route is the only real location in the state that was featured in the 2024 movie Road House, set in the fictional Florida's Glass Key.\n\n(You can open all the locations on Google Maps by clicking on the links below in the captions ↴)\n\nImage courtesy of Netflix - Map\n\nThe Bloodline House\n\nThe Bloodline House, the idyllic Rayburn House Inn is in real life the Blue Charlotte ocean view home, part of the exclusive Moorings Village and Spa in Islamorada.\n\nYou can book this awesome 6,000-square-foot vacation home with its 18-meter swimming pool for $4,000 per night.\n\nImage courtesy of Netflix - Map\n\nThe first floor of the house features a kitchen, private office, large foyer, and a single bedroom with a bathroom. On the top floor, there is the living room area and two suites with ensuite baths.\n\nThe Moorings is a spacious beachfront resort. The complex is set in a tropical former coconut plantation boasting over 800 palms and lush gardens surrounded by crystalline turquoise waters.\n\nThe production tried to keep everything local, filming as much as they could in Islamorada and its surroundings.\n\nThe Coral Bay Marina doubles as Kevin’s boatyard. Also, some other scenes with boats were shot at the sensational waterfront seafood restaurant Robbie's of Islamorada.\n\nImage courtesy of Netflix and Google Maps\n\nThe Long Key State Park was used to film a key scene with the two older brothers, John and Danny, at the end of the first session (hey, we said no spoilers).\n\nThis is an excellent place for bird-watching, swimming, kayaking or just relaxing on the dazzling Atlantic Ocean shoreline.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the park was home to a luxury resort which was destroyed by a Hurricane in 1935 and never reopened.\n\nImage by Faungg - Map\n\nThe beautiful spot where the patriarch Robert Rayburn (played by Sam Shepard) goes kayaking is Anne's Beach at Lower Matecumbe Key.\n\nThe beach is located on the Atlantic Ocean, but is super quiet, almost with no waves due to the wide expanse of shallow water typical for the Florida Keys.\n\nWhat a paradise! Here you can enjoy clear and warm waters all year round. There are two parking lots for visitors, located on US-1 at MM 73.\n\nImage by Katie Wheeler - Map\n\nLowry's fishing shop was set up at Tackle Center of Islamorada. The film crew just basically changed the signs of this real fishing store.\n\nImage courtesy of Netflix - Map\n\nThe Red Reef Motel was filmed at the Drift Hotel (formerly known as Stoneledge Paradise Inn) in the Key Largo village.\n\nImage courtesy of Netflix and Google Maps\n\nSeveral scenes in the bar with Danny and Eric O’Bannon (played by Jamie McShane) were filmed at the iconic Caribbean Club in Key Largo.\n\nOpened in 1938, the bar, along with the former hotel that the property included, served as the filming location of the 1947 Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall film Key Largo.\n\nImage by Jenni Konrad - Map\n\nSeveral scenes were filmed at the dining restaurant Green Turtle Inn in Islamorada.\n\nImage by Google Maps\n\nThe Oceanview Inn tropical-themed hotel and Sports Pub, also in Islamorada, was featured in a few scenes.\n\nImage by Google Maps\n\nThere are so many bars, pubs, and restaurants appearing in Bloodline... the Hog Heaven Sports Bar (from the last episode of season 2), is the last one to be added to a long list including Atlantic’s Edge, Pierre’s Restaurant, The Whistle Stop Pub and Mangrove Mike's Cafe in Islamorada, Cafe Moka, Sunrise Cuban Market and Cafe in Tavernier, Gilbert's Tiki-Bar in Key Largo, and Alabama Jack’s in Homestead.\n\nImage courtesy of Netflix - Map\n\nDanny's failed Viva Caputa restaurant is a building at 1555 Washington Avenue in Miami Beach.\n\nSome interior sets were built on a soundstage in Homestead, also on the mainland.\n\nImage courtesy of Netflix and Google Maps\n\nThe Christ of the Abyss is an underwater sculpture that appears briefly in the first season, located at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park in Key Largo.\n\nImage courtesy of Netflix - Map\n\nCan you help to improve this article about the shooting locations of Bloodline? To complete and correct this report, any feedback, info, or images that you may have are more than welcome, thank you!\n\nNOTICE: If you’re using this information on your website, please credit and link to this page as a source.\n\n*****\n\n9 comments:\n\n1- Paivi - July 26, 2017 at 11:47 PM\n\nHi and thanks for these photos and addresses, they are very helpful! :) One thing - Please correct me if I'm wrong but I thought that \"The Rayburn House\" is The Blue Charlotte House in real life? If so, I think you have the wrong picture of \"The Rayburn House\" at the beginning of this story (second photo from the top)? Your picture is showing Pierre's Restaurant House, right? These two houses look alike but Pierre's doesn't have grass in front of it as Blue Charlotte House does.\n\n2- Anonymous - October 8, 2017 at 2:45 PM\n\nI noticed that too. Incorrect picture. Close, but no cigar!\n\n3- Bloodline Fan - February 4, 2018 at 4:53 PM\n\nYou are right! Houses are almost identical, except the grass.\n\nReply\n\n4- Ra Moon - February 5, 2018 at 10:10 AM\n\nThank you, updated!\n\n5- Jenn The Mermaid - May 29, 2019 at 3:56 PM\n\nMy friend and I spent a few days checking out a lot of the filming locations in Islamorada and the keys a couple of weeks ago and got lots of pictures. We hit Alabama Jack's, Kevin's Boatyard, Robbies, The Whistle Stop, The Moorings Village, the Ocean View, Turtle Inn, and The Caribbean Club in Key Largo. We have a lot of pics if anyone is interested. The locals and employees were always happy to share what went down during shooting at their locations, it was a lot of fun!\n\n6- Carol Symanski - Nov 24, 2021, 6:41 AM\n\nThank you for this info about the filming locations. I hope to be able to visit someday.\n\n7- Anonymous - Apr 14, 2023, 11:56 AM\n\nWas awesome seeing all the cool places!\n\n8- Anonymous - Apr 23, 2023, 6:35 AM\n\nWhere can I see your pics?\n\n9- Anonymous - Nov 22, 2023, 7:00 PM\n\nCan’t wait to visit all of the locations while on vacation with my husband and daughter, I loved this series so much, I was hoping they added another series! I am going to watch it again before I leave for vacation to Islamorada, so excited to to be going where it was filmed Thank you so much for all the information and websights, great article!\n\nRa Moon\n\nAtlas of Wonders is looking for wonderful Filming Locations all around the world.
