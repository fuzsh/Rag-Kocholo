        "text": "Islamorada, a collection of islands that includes Tea Table Key, Lower Matecumbe Key, Upper Matecumbe Key, Windley Key, and Plantation Key, is located midway between Miami and Key West (it’s a 90-minute drive to either location), making it the perfect stopping point if you want to break up your drive. But the village offers much more than just a place to sleep: it’s a seaside oasis that offers top-notch dining and accommodations (we recommend the intimate Casa Morada for a true hideaway, with just 16 romantic suites in a waterfront setting), and is also where you’ll find the Holiday Isle Tiki Bar, a stalwart tiki throwback.\n\nIf Islamorada is the sport fishing capital of the world, then Robbie’s Marina is the one-stop venue you need to experience all the area has to offer. Whatever your preferred mode of water-based transportation, it’s here for you to rent: kayaks, paddleboards, jet skis, and fishing boats. If you’d rather let someone else be the captain of your ship, fishing charters and partyboats depart all day (when the sun begins to drop toward the water, sunset cruises with Sundance Watersports offer an epic end to the day). But even land-dwellers will find ways to keep themselves occupied, whether that means shopping (there’s an open-air market onsite with artwork, nautical-inspired signs and the like) or grabbing a cocktail and a bite to eat at the Hungry Tarpon (the tuna tacos, shrimp burrito, cracked conch, and Thai-style mahi fish fingers are among their signature dishes). But the most popular thing to do—as long as you don’t mind a giant fish lunging up out of the water toward you—is to fork over $4 for a bucket of bait and help feed the hungry tarpon (yep, that’s where the name comes from) that surround the deck and are always ready for a snack.\n\nWhile nearby Key Largo is known as “The Diving Capital of the World,” the History of Diving Museum travels far beyond the Florida Keys—and even America—to trace humankind’s long love affair with the sea. It’s a surprisingly lengthy history, and one full of mesmerizing items that some people might not think would make for a memorable outing. The museum houses photographs, documents, suits, diving apparatus, and the world's largest collection of diving helmets—some of which look like they came straight from the set of Doctor Who. Because the museum is just a simple turn off the highway, it may seem like a few people just decided to stop to stretch their legs a bit. But once inside, the variety of things to do and see keeps them in place, perhaps for longer than they expected.\n\nThe Holiday Isle Tiki Bar, which opened in 1969, is a bit like a time machine. Though it underwent a massive renovation (the establishment sustained a lot of damage following Hurricane Irma), it still maintains much of its original charm, and many of its original features—including floorboards with the names of some of its many visitors carved into them and a neon sign that serves as a sort of beacon to kitsch and cocktail fans. The space has all the requirements of a great tiki bar: soft lighting, beach views, a friendly, if raucous, crowd (usually a mix of scuba divers, anglers, and hotel guests from the nearby Postcard Inn Beach Resort); and a menu full of frozen drinks themselves seemingly frozen in time as the craft cocktail world has evolved around them. The bar is also supposedly the original home of the Rum Runner—rum, blackberry brandy, banana liqueur, lime juice, and grenadine—making it a destination for those with a cocktail bucket list.\n\nYou came to the Florida Keys for the water views and the sunsets, and Lorelei Restaurant has both, plus the freshest seafood around. The Florida Bay views are pristine and the menu is a perfect mix of tropical dishes (try the conch chowder and smoked fish dip). If colorful cocktails lure you, the rum punch (coconut and dark rums, grenadine, pineapple juice, and orange juice) and Bahama mama (silver, gold, coconut, and 151 rums with pineapple, orange, and Key lime juices) are solid choices.\n\nIs this the Keys or the Caribbean? The lines are blurred at this evocative hotel that conjures barefoot island living to a tee. Nightly rates include snorkeling gear, bikes for exploring Islamorada’s bike paths, and stand-up paddleboards—and there’s free yoga three days a week. You can also access the resort’s tiny but pretty private island via a footbridge from the “mainland” where the suites are located. There’s a freshwater pool on the island, as well as a hidden cabana and a pavilion where you can scope for passing manatees and dolphins and watch the sunset.\n\nThe beautiful beer garden on the backside of this brewery has a Bavaria meets Islamorada aesthetic that's impossible not to love. Picnic tables sit under palms and flowering tropical trees, and bands often strum island tunes on the tiny outdoor stage. This is the Keys, so the beer is not exactly straight ahead. Only real fruit extracts like mango, passionfruit, and pineapple are used to season the brews. There are lagers, kolsch beers, browns, wheat ales, and IPAs on the menu. People love the Run Aground Brown.\n\nIf you’re aching to explore something beyond Key West, but don’t want to stray too far, a two-hour-and-15-minute ferry ride will take you the approximately 70 miles from Key West to the Dry Tortugas, a small group of islands that once operated as a military fort and was re-designated as a national park in 1992. There are no luxury hotels to be found here (though you can spend the night if you don’t mind pitching a tent and camping), nor are there any quaint boutiques or cafes. This destination is for history lovers and outdoorsy types (but it's okay if your idea of “outdoorsy” is laying on the beach all day).\n\nFrom a distance, the 65,000-acre Dry Tortugas National Park looks like what could be one of the world’s most stunning private islands: the sand is powdery and white, the water is a stunning shade of blue, and an impressive brick fortress overlooks this island utopia. But there's more. Get a little closer and you’ll see that the brick structure is actually a historic military fort, and that the cluster of islands’ only full-time residents are the diverse range of marine and wildlife. There are no hotels (unless you count a small campsite), nor are there are any bars, boutiques, or restaurants…though there is a tiny gift shop). If you're an outdoor enthusiast, you can choose to plant yourself on the beach and not move until your boat or seaplane (the only possible modes of transportation) is ready to take you back to the mainland, or actually get up and explore.\n\nCuban Coffee Queen is a lively counter-service joint with three locations (all within one square mile of each other in the heart of town), any one of which makes an ideal spot for enjoying a bit of sunshine with your morning coffee. But don’t let the name fool you: Sure, they serve one of the best cups of joe in town—break away from your same-old caffeine fix and opt for one of their classic Cuban specialties, like a café con leche—but they serve up a whole lot more. Give the pressed Cuban bread with guava and cream cheese or one of their homemade sammies a try.\n\nIf you want to get out to the Dry Tortugas, you’re either going to need a boat or a seaplane—and if you don't happen to have a spare of either, the Yankee Freedom III is your next best choice. The ferry makes the two-hour journey to and from the Dry Tortugas each day, and the price of a ticket ($180 for adults, $125 for kids 16 and under) includes a comfortable boat ride, plus breakfast and lunch, complimentary snorkeling equipment, admittance to Dry Tortugas National Park, and entry to Fort Jefferson, a massive, though unfinished, military fortress that dates to the Civil War. For those who want to take a guided tour of the 16-acre facility, that’s included, too. Just know that there are no shops here, so you’ll want to remember to bring a beach towel and some sunscreen. (The ferry itself serves up drinks and snacks.)\n\nKey Largo may be the title of one of Humphrey Bogart’s most famous movies, but the town itself—which is the first one you’ll reach while driving onto the Keys—has a link to one of Bogart’s other films: the boat that ferried around Bogey and Katharine Hepburn in The African Queen (it’s been restored to take guests on day trips as well as sunset dinner cruises). If you’d rather be in the water than on top of it, the town is also where you’ll find John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park—the country’s first underwater park, which is a must-see for scuba enthusiasts. Grab your sunscreen and get moving.\n\nOpen since February 2019 in Key Largo, Baker’s Cay Resort has been a hit with Traveler readers from the jump. It spans 15 tropical acres that were once a pineapple plantation tucked away off the busy Overseas Highway. The resort has 200 rooms but manages to maintain a boutique and intimate feel with winding nature trails throughout leading to quiet beaches. Rooms—including lavish suites with views of Florida Bay—have handcrafted wood furnishings, custom tile work in the bathrooms, and hardwood floors. On-site dining includes waterfront taqueria Dry Rocks, and Caribbean-Creole cuisine with bay views at the more upscale (but still Florida Keys casual) Calusa restaurant. Other amenities include a kids’ camp, two swimming pools with a waterfall grotto, and hammocks everywhere. The resort is super pet-friendly, too: dogs can swim in the water, walk on the beach, escape the sun in dedicated dog tikis, and even enjoy “yappy hour” specials.\n\nThe country's first underwater park, John Pennekamp is a scuba diver's dream—there are more than 250 species of tropical fish and 85 types of coral within its nearly 200 square nautical miles. Which means you’re going to want to plan an itinerary ahead of time: throughout the day, the park runs a number of snorkeling and scuba diving tours, and kayaks, paddleboards, and canoes are also available for rent. For less active types, a glass-bottomed boat tour will let you experience the park’s majestic underwater wonderland—all from a comfy, seated position. But the park’s most impressive, must-see feature is right there in its name: its coral reefs (they’re part of the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States, and the park was established in part to protect that). The park’s snorkeling and scuba tours are the best way to get an up-close view of these marine wonders, but the glass-bottom boat is a nice option for guests who are less inclined to get wet.\n\nClassic movie lovers will feel transported to Hollywood's golden age while being chauffeured around the Port Largo Canal aboard the steam engine-powered boat from The African Queen, the 1951 Oscar-winning film starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. Because the boat only holds about half a dozen people, a tour on board will feel quite intimate. Chat up your captain during the 90-minute trip to get the lowdown on Key Largo and its history. A heads-up: there's no bathroom on board, so be sure to make a pre-departure pit stop.\n\nSpread across seven acres of mangrove wetlands that lead visitors on a boardwalk past rescued bird habitats to the open bay, this facility blends in with its surrounds. It feels wild, not manicured at all, but still safe and comfortable as you walk the boardwalk pathway to the area where it opens to mangrove fringed bay views of the undeveloped shoreline. Some 1,000 birds are rescued and rehabilitated by the facility every year, with many released back into the wild. Barn owls, pelicans, broad-winged hawks, great horned owls, and all manner of shore birds and pelicans are some of the characters you'll see.\n\nThe Keys is a place for seafood, and the Conch House is no exception. The food is simple here but exceedingly fresh, and serves as a nice departure from the usual abundance of fritters, fish, and fries found throughout the Keys. The emphasis is on healthy cooking, with the freshest possible fish prepared blackened or grilled with seasonal vegetables (or fries if you must). The must-try is huge portion of conch, and lobster ceviche.\n\nThis nonprofit organization is dedicated to rescuing dolphins, manatees, and other sea mammals, and visitors to the sanctuary can assist by doing anything from observing their resident animals from the dock and watching the team at work, to shadowing a trainer for the day. But the highlight for most will be getting to take a swim with the dolphins. Some of the other programming here shows visitors how to care for the animals; depending on the day and dolphin, you might see how a dolphin ultrasound is performed, or how to brush a dolphin’s teeth.\n\nWhile Snappers has long been a Key Largo icon, it’s also a popular stopping point for travelers making their way from Miami to Key West (it’s about a 90-minute drive from South Beach), so prepare for a crowd and plan your trip accordingly. The waterfront setting, old-school décor, and history of the place make it rather boisterous regardless of whether you stop in for lunch, dinner, or Sunday brunch (which runs from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and features live jazz plus a build-your-own-Bloody Mary bar). The food leans Caribbean, and the menu changes slightly each day based on what's fresh—the hallmark of any great seafood joint—but you can't miss if you order the gator bites (lest there be any confusion, made from actual gator). If you’ve spent the day doing some fishing of your own, they’ll also cook up your personal catch of the day."
