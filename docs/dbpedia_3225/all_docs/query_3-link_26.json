        "text": "Over the years, NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Daytona International Speedway, Disney theme parks have had a 'role' in many films set in Florida.\n\nFlorida, you're home to beautiful beaches, Orlando theme parks and iconic attractions.\n\nIt's no wonder movies get filmed here.\n\nFrom independent films to big-budget action blockbusters (we're looking at you, Ben Affleck and \"Armageddon\"), the Sunshine State has been in the spotlight over the years as a place to shoot movies or the perfect setting for one.\n\nSometimes the Florida attractions, which already get global attention, take a supporting role. For instance, in the Space Race rom-com \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" star Scarlett Johansson donned a '60s-style wig and vintage dresses to look the part. NASA's Kennedy Space Center got a slight change in appearance, too, when fake lamps and vintage cars were added to the parking lot of the Vehicle Assembly Building in March 2023. (A video about that went viral, by the way.)\n\nBrad Pitt and Tom Cruise as race car drivers? Both superstars partially filmed their respective movies (the upcoming \"F1\" and cult classic \"Days of Thunder\") at Daytona International Speedway, home of the Daytona 500 in Daytona Beach, Florida.\n\nAnd we would be remiss not to mention the reigning champ of theme parks: Disney World Resort in Orlando − which has been the setting and topic of many a film.\n\nEven the campy \"Sharknado\" franchise targeted Florida's wacky weather with \"Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!\" Though the Sunshine State is known for being a hotbed of tropical storm activity during hurricane season (every year), \"Sharknado 3\" mixed great white sharks and a different type of weather disaster.\n\nFlorida's long and varied cinematic history ranges from '80s audience favorites to Best Picture Oscar winners, with several other Sunshine State films winning or being nominated for additional Academy Awards.\n\nAction? With financial incentives gone, advocates seek other ways to attract film, TV work to Florida\n\nBelow is a guide to some favorite Florida films and cult classics, presented in alphabetical order. Note: This (very long) list excludes such classics as “Citizen Kane,” “The Godfather Part II” and “Goodfellas” that have scenes in Florida but primarily take place elsewhere. We also omitted movies such as “Some Like it Hot,” “Key Largo” and “The Longest Yard” that are set in Florida but were entirely, or almost entirely, filmed in other states. For example, in the 2017 bridesmaid black comedy, \"Rough Night,\" Scarlett Johansson plays a bride-to-be whose friends (Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell and Zoe Kravitz) host a bachelorette party gone wrong when the stripper they hire accidentally dies. Though the film is set in Miami, with references to \"Florida Man\" stories that originate from Port St. Lucie, production took place outside of Florida.\n\n‘Apollo 13’ (1995)\n\n\"Houston, we have a problem\" was already a famous quote, and it became part of the pop culture vernacular after this film. \"Apollo 13,\" Ron Howard’s famous thriller about the ill-fated 1970 Apollo mission, starring Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton, filmed scenes at Kennedy Space Center. Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan co-star, with Harris and Quinlan earning Oscar nominations.\n\n'Armageddon' (1998)\n\n\"Armageddon\" was one of several \"disaster-asteroid\" films during that time (remember \"Deep Impact?\"). Starring Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Owen Wilson and Steve Buscemi, the space disaster movie was filmed on the Space Coast in 1998.\n\nIn the action-comedy movie, an oil rig crew flies into space aboard a military space shuttle to destroy an asteroid headed for Earth. Fun fact: Academy Award winner Gwyneth Paltrow, then-girlfriend of Ben Affleck, appeared with him at a movie premiere event at NASA's Kennedy Space Center where Bruce Willis and his blues band performed in the rocket garden.\n\n‘The Birdcage’ (1996)\n\nSouth Beach serves as the setting for director Mike Nichols’ and screenwriter Elaine May’s blockbuster remake of the Franco-Italian comedy “La Cage aux Folles.” The inspired casting finds Robin Williams (\"Dead Poets Society,\" Good Will Hunting\") and Nathan Lane (\"Modern Family,\" \"Only Murders in the Building\") playing a gay couple trying to pass themselves off as straight for the benefit of their son. One of the funniest films of the ’90s, “The Birdcage” was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award.\n\n‘Body Heat’ (1981)\n\nLargely shot in Palm Beach County and set during a fierce Florida heatwave, “Body Heat” is a “Double Indemnity”-inspired serving of neo-noir mastery starring Kathleen Turner as the femme fatale who wants her husband murdered by her lover (William Hurt). The film marks the directorial debut of Lawrence Kasdan, who was born in Miami Beach.\n\n‘Caddyshack’ (1980)\n\nOne of the most hilarious and quotable movies ever made, Harold Ramis’ slobs-versus-snobs classic “Caddyshack” — featuring killer comedic performances by Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray — filmed its golf scenes at Rolling Hills Golf Club (now the Grande Oaks Golf Club) in Broward County, with the dinner scene shot at the Boca Raton Resort & Club.\n\n‘Cocoon’ (1985)\n\nWhile St. Petersburg’s reputation as “God’s waiting room” didn’t get any help from this movie, filmed there with a largely senior citizen cast, Ron Howard’s “Cocoon” remains a heartwarming sci-fi fantasy, with an Oscar-winning performance by Don Ameche. The film spawned the 1988 sequel “Cocoon: The Return,\" with filming in Miami. \"Cocoon\" stars Steve Guttenberg, best known for the \"Police Academy\" movies.\n\nThumbs up, thumbs down? Best Florida movies ... here are our favorite films set in the Sunshine State\n\n‘Cool Hand Luke’ (1967)\n\nSet and, at least partially, shot in the Sunshine State — it’s based on a book by safecracker Donn Pearce, who did a couple of years in the Florida Dept. of Corrections chain gangs after being arrested in 1949 — “Cool Hand Luke” stands out in the prison movie genre thanks to a tour-de-force performance by Paul Newman, whose endearingly boyish smirk and disarming blue eyes are perfect for bringing to life the vision of inmate Lucas “Luke” Jackson.\n\n'Days of Thunder' (1990)\n\nBefore the \"Mission Impossible\" movies and \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" Tom Cruise felt a need for speed as hotshot rookie driver Cole Trickle in \"Days of Thunder.\" Co-starring Academy Award-winning actress (and then-wife) Nicole Kidman and Michael Rooker (Marvel's \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" films), \"Days of Thunder\" was partially shot at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach.\n\n‘Deathdream’ (1974)\n\nFilmed in Brooksville, this horror movie provides a potent take on both the classic tale “The Monkey’s Paw” and the then-ongoing Vietnam War, following a soldier killed in combat who answers his mother’s pleas that he come back home – which he does, but as something not quite human. The film was directed by onetime Floridian Bob Clark, whose fascinating career also includes the original “Black Christmas,\" the very different holiday classic “A Christmas Story,” and fellow Florida feature “Porky’s.”\n\n‘Dolphin Tale’ (2011)\n\nOne of the most endearing family films of the past decade, “Dolphin Tale” stars Harry Connick Jr., Ashley Judd and the bottlenose dolphin Winter, with a screenplay based on her real-life story: Winter lost her tail after becoming entangled in a crab trap line and the team at Clearwater Marine Aquarium worked with Hanger Clinic to develop a prosthetic tail. Spoiler alert: Winter made a full recovery, and her pal Hope starred in the 2014 sequel. Sadly, Winter died in 2021 at age 16 due to a gastrointestinal abnormality.\n\n‘Edward Scissorhands’ (1990)\n\nPasco County served as the pastel-colored backdrop for this Tim Burton film about a scissor-handed outcast clad in black (Johnny Depp) who suddenly finds himself in the suburbs. If not quite Burton’s best film, “Edward Scissorhands” may offer his definitive misfit toy protagonist. It also marks the final onscreen film appearance of Burton’s idol, Vincent Price. A blonde Winona Ryder (\"Mr. Deeds,\" \"Reality Bites\") and Anthony Michael Hall (\"Weird Science,\" \"Sixteen Candles\") co-star.\n\n'F1'\n\nPreviously referred to as \"Apex,\" the action film \"F1\" stars the Academy Award-winning Hollywood superstar Brad Pitt as Sonny Hayes, an ex-Formula 1 driver who returns to the sport to mentor a rookie teammate. British actor Damson Idris plays Pitt's rookie teammate on their fictional team APXGP, and Academy Award-winning actor Javier Bardem plays the leader of APXGP. Other co-stars include Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, Sarah Niles, Kim Bodnia and Samson Kayo. The Apple Original film about the world of Formula One racing, directed by Joseph Kosinski (“Top Gun: Maverick”), was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and seven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, who has a cameo in the film. \"F1,\" which gives viewers a peek of Daytona International Speedway, opens in theaters June 27, 2025.\n\n'First Man' (2018)\n\nBefore Ryan Gosling was just Ken in \"Barbie,\" donning fluorescent rollerblading clothes, he suited up for \"First Man.\" The film about astronaut Neil Armstrong, played by Gosling, and the legendary space mission that led to his first steps on the moon co-stars Claire Foy as Janet Armstrong. Corey Stoll (\"Ant-Man\") portrayed Buzz Aldrin, the second person to set foot on the moon and a Space Coast, Florida, resident. \"First Man\" was directed by Academy Award-winning director Damien Chazelle (\"La La Land\"). Scenes were filmed on location at Kennedy Space Center in February 2018.\n\n‘The Florida Project’ (2017)\n\nSean Baker’s film follows an impoverished community living in a motel on the outskirts of Walt Disney World, chronicling their struggles honestly but sympathetically. Along with some excellent child performances, it features a wonderfully warm turn by Willem Dafoe as the motel manager, earning a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.\n\n'Fly Me to the Moon' (2024)\n\n\"Fly Me to the Moon\" is an alt-history rom-com about a slick ad executive named Kelly Jones (Scarlett Johansson), who’s hired by the U.S. government to “sell” the 1969 Apollo 11 mission to a dubious public, which sees space exploration as a waste of resources. But when she arrives in Cape Canaveral, Florida, she quickly butts heads with Cole Davis (Channing Tatum), an earnest launch director who feels that Kelly’s grandstanding undermines the hard work of NASA astronauts and engineers. \"Fly Me to the Moon\" filmed scenes at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in February and March 2023.\n\n‘The Greatest Show on Earth’ (1952)\n\nCecil B. DeMille’s 150-minute circus epic, largely filmed in Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey's winter quarters of Sarasota, is often considered one of the lesser Best Picture Oscar winners. Yet that’s largely because it beat out classics like “High Noon” and “The Quiet Man.” On its own merits, it’s frequently dazzling with an engaging cast, if occasionally overstuffed and overwhelming — not unlike the circus itself.\n\n‘The Heartbreak Kid’ (1972)\n\nThis Elaine May-directed, Neil Simon-scripted comedy stars Charles Grodin as a newlywed who has second thoughts about his wife (an Oscar-nominated Jeannie Berlin) when he meets another woman (Cybill Shepherd) on his Miami Beach honeymoon. Funny and existentially bleak in equal measure, the film makes a fine companion piece with “The Graduate,” by May’s former comedy team partner Mike Nichols. Its 2007 remake, directed by the Farrelly Brothers and starring Ben Stiller, was not set in Florida.\n\n‘Magic Mike’ (2012)\n\nBased on Channing Tatum’s time as a male stripper while living in Tampa, “Magic Mike” proves to be more than just beefcake eye candy (though there’s plenty of that, too). That’s thanks to the assured direction of Steven Soderbergh and a cast that also includes Matthew McConaughey in what may be the best performance of his 2010s “McConaissance” era. The 2015 sequel \"Magic Mike XXL\" was similarly strong, though it left Florida for Georgia and South Carolina, with 2023's \"Magic Mike: Last Dance\" starting in Miami but mainly taking place in the U.K.\n\n‘Miami Blues’ (1990)\n\nGeorge Armitage’s adaptation of South Florida writer Charles Willeford’s novel stars Alec Baldwin in one of his earliest (and best) roles as a charismatic but sociopathic criminal who resolves to start a new life in Miami, but doesn’t get as far as the airport before causing trouble, attracting the attention of cop Hoke Moseley (Fred Ward). A pitch-black comedy with a sunny setting, “Miami Blues” offers a Floridian addition to the slew of great crime films released in 1990, also including “Goodfellas,” “Miller’s Crossing” and “The Grifters.”\n\n‘Moonlight’ (2016)\n\nBarry Jenkins’ drama following a Black man from the Liberty City neighborhood in Miami (Jenkins' own hometown) during three stages of his life took home the Best Picture Oscar in a historic surprise win and was later named the best film of the 2010s by IndieWire. It’s a deserving choice in both categories, combining life’s harsh realities with an aching romantic lushness, especially in its third act.\n\n‘Night Moves’ (1975)\n\nGene Hackman followed “The Conversation” with another neo-noir, this one about a private eye who travels to the Florida Keys to find a missing teenage girl and uncovers a much greater conspiracy. Don’t let the sunny setting fool you — “Night Moves” is as paranoid and despairing as any great ’70s thriller, with a particularly haunting final image.\n\n‘Out of Sight’ (1998)\n\nBased on author Elmore Leonard’s novel of the same name, “Out of Sight” stars George Clooney as a bank robber who busts out of a Sunshine State prison and falls in love with a U.S. Marshal played by Jennifer Lopez. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, it’s one of the wittiest, sexiest and often funniest crime movies of recent decades.\n\n‘Out of Time’ (2003)\n\nDenzel Washington reunited with “Devil in a Blue Dress” director Carl Franklin for this thriller starring the actor as the chief of police in the fictional Florida town of Banyan Key, who finds himself set up for a double homicide he didn’t commit. “Out of Time” offers a sunny Floridian take on a wrong-man noir, with the film shooting in locations including Boca Grande and the Manatee County fishing village of Cortez. Eva Mendes (\"Hitch,\" \"The Place Behind the Pines\") co-stars.\n\n‘Scarface’ (1983)\n\nMiami has never looked quite so eerily exotic or vicious as it does in Brian De Palma’s ultra-violent gangster epic, scripted by Oliver Stone, about a Cuban immigrant (Al Pacino) determined to realize the American dream by any means necessary. In addition to Pacino’s awesomely over-the-top portrayal of Tony Montana, there also are strong, star-making performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.\n\n'Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!' (2015)\n\nOne of the most popular staples in Shark Week history, the \"Sharknado\" movies spawned several sequels − with lots of celebrity cameos and \"what on earth\"-like plots (sharks, out of water, in a tornado?). In \"Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!\" a tornado unleashes ravenous sharks from Washington, D.C., all the way to Central Florida. Star Ian Ziering, best known for \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" filmed scenes at Kennedy Space Center and parts of Cape Canaveral in May 2015. The \"Sharknado\" series also stars \"American Pie\" actress Tara Reid.\n\n‘Spring Breakers’ (2013)\n\nIndie film provocateur Harmony Korine got his biggest budget and stars (including Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens) to date for this St. Petersburg and Sarasota-shot crime drama, and the results were surprisingly invigorating: a surrealistic collage of bright-colored bikinis, beer, bongs and bullets. Florida has proven to be a muse for Korine, with his following films, 2019’s Matthew McConaughey stoner comedy “The Beach Bum\" and 2023's experimental crime movie \"AGGRO DR1FT,\" set in the Sunshine State as well.\n\n‘Summer Rental’ (1985)\n\nThis beloved comedy finds John Candy giving a winning performance as Jack Chester, just a regular fellow taking his family on vacation to the fictional Gulf Coast resort town Citrus Cove, which is played by various coastal Pinellas County communities. These include St. Pete Beach, Treasure Island and Tierra Verde, where you can still dine at Billy’s Stone Crab, which serves in the film as Scully’s, the ramshackle waterfront restaurant owned by Rip Torn’s character.\n\n‘Sunshine State’ (2002)\n\nFeaturing an all-star cast led by the St. Pete-raised Angela Bassett and Edie Falco, “Sunshine State” is set in the fictional coastal northern Florida town of Delrona Beach and was largely filmed on Amelia Island. The drama about family issues, race relations and encroaching real estate development earned numerous honors, with Bassett receiving the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress. The Florida Film Critics Circle gave writer/director John Sayles its Golden Orange Award for his “witty satire that insightfully examines Florida’s historic past, expanding present and uncertain future.”\n\n'Tomorrowland' (2015)\n\n\"Tomorrowland,\" inspired by the Space Age and Walt Disney's vision for EPCOT, is a sci-fi film starring Academy Award winner George Clooney as an inventor who travels with a girl, actress Britt Robertson, into an alternate universe. Emmy-winning actor Hugh Laurie of \"House\" also appears in the film. Scenes with Clooney and Robertson were shot at Titusville’s Space View Park and Kennedy Space Center.\n\n‘The Truman Show’ (1998)\n\nIn “The Truman Show,” the Florida Panhandle master-planned community of Seaside plays the part of the town where Truman (Jim Carrey) has unknowingly been on a television show set his whole life. The film is as philosophical as that premise would suggest, while remaining a breezy and enjoyable comedy in a manner reminiscent of “Groundhog Day.” Laura Linney and Ed Harris co-star.\n\n‘Ulee’s Gold’ (1997)\n\nVictor Nuñez is arguably Florida’s finest resident filmmaker, having directed such standout Sunshine State movies as the Sarasota-Manatee-shot John D. MacDonald adaptation “A Flash of Green” and Ashley Judd’s breakthrough film “Ruby in Paradise.” Yet his best-known work remains this drama starring Peter Fonda as a beekeeper living in Gulf County, with the film set and shot there as well as Orlando. The role earned Fonda a Golden Globe Award, along with his only Best Actor Oscar nomination.\n\n'Wild Things' (1998)\n\nSet and largely shot in South Florida and considered one of the most notorious movies of the ‘90s, “Wild Things” still stands up nearly 25 years later thanks to its by turns salacious and smart approach to the erotic thriller genre. Starring Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell and Denise Richards (who famously appear in a three-way sex scene together), “Wild Things” also offers juicy performances by Kevin Bacon (as a detective) and Bill Murray (as an ambulance-chasing attorney) with the film’s finest attribute probably being the script, which buzzes with a near-constant barrage of surprises.\n\n'The Yearling' (1946)\n\nWith Florida filming locations including Ocala, “The Yearling” — based on the novel by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings — is an emotive family drama about a young boy on a farm who adopts a young deer, which, alas, has a penchant for the crops. Starring Gregory Peck, it was nominated for Best Picture and won two Oscars at the 19th Academy Awards. Rawlings was later the subject of the 1983 biopic “Cross Creek” (based in part on her 1942 memoir by the same name), which was also shot in Florida and earned four Oscar nominations.\n\n'Zola' (2021)\n\nThe latest addition to A24's roster of Florida-set and shot films, \"Zola\" adapts a viral 148-tweet Twitter thread and resulting Rolling Stone article about a part-time stripper (Taylour Paige) who agrees to accompany a woman she just met (Riley Keough) on a Tampa road trip, which quickly goes downhill. The frenetic crime comedy premiered at Sundance Film Festival and earned seven Independent Spirit Award nominations, winning for Paige's performance and Best Editing.\n\nContributing: Patrick Ryan, USA TODAY"
