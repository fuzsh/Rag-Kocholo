        "text": "There’s nothing as magical as a Florida Keys babymoon! This tropical paradise is the ideal setting for taking a leisurely stroll by the beach, visiting luxurious spas, enjoying a sunset sail, and touring historic sites as you spend quality time with your sweetheart before the baby arrives! You’ll even have plenty of opportunities to spot Florida’s colorful wildlife when sailing out to sandbars or visiting sanctuaries.\n\nWith Caribbean-like temperatures, the Florida Keys provide incredible opportunities for slipping in some fun, sun, and relaxation regardless of the time of year. This is also the perfect babymoon destination because you can feel like you’re jetting off to faraway tropical islands without ever pulling out a passport.\n\nHere’s some inspiration for planning a perfect babymoon!\n\n1) Take A Romantic Boat Trip For Two\n\nThere’s no better bonding experience for a couple than a private boat trip in a romantic setting! Key West Boat Trips has helped countless couples enjoy memorable babymoons. When you book an excursion with us, you can choose everything from a laid-back sunset sail to an exciting adventure on the sandbars.\n\nOur experienced and attentive captains sail you away from the crowds to enjoy a wide range of activities that can include:\n\nKayaking among the mangroves\n\nSwimming and snorkeling\n\nExploring sandbars\n\nSunset dinners cruises\n\nDolphin watching from the water in Mud Keys and Boca Grande Key\n\nWe offer an array of boat trips catering to all types of travelers! Let us pamper you on your babymoon with an unforgettable experience on the water that doesn’t require you to fight for views aboard a cramped, hot ferry. With our tours lasting two to four hours, you will feel like you traveled to secluded “parts unknown” while still getting back to shore in time for dinner or an early night at the hotel.\n\n2) Explore Key Largo\n\nWhile Key Largo is most famous for its scuba diving excursions that bring divers to some of the best wreckage spots in the world, there are plenty of ways for expectant mothers to safely enjoy the scenery here from dry land!\n\nKnown as the first and longest key in the Florida Keys, this beautiful island stretches 33 miles. In fact, the island’s name means “long key.” Here’s a rundown of the best babymoon attractions and activities to visit here:\n\nFlorida Keys Wild Bird Rehabilitation Center\n\nIsland Dolphin Care\n\nHarry Harris Beach Park\n\nDagny Johnson Key Largo Hammock Botanical State Park\n\nIf you need proof that this is the perfect destination for romance, look no further than the classic 1948 film called “Key Largo” that was filmed here with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall during their marriage!\n\n3) Visit Islamorada Florida\n\nKnown as the sport fishing capital of the world, Islamorada is a village consisting of tiny islands located between Key Largo and Marathon. You’ll love putting in a little bit of island time while exploring stunning beaches and fun attractions. Here’s a rundown of all of the things to put on your Islamorada Florida babymoon list:\n\nShop for unique gifts at Rain Barrell Village\n\nStroll among fossilized coral reefs on the nature trails at Windley Key Fossil Reef Geological State Park\n\nSee Alligator Reef Lighthouse\n\nVisit the History of Diving Museum\n\nTour a tropical paradise at Lignumvitae Key Botanical State Park\n\nExplore ruins from the 1800s at Indian Key Historic State Park\n\n4) Create Lasting Memories In Key West\n\nIf you’re all about conserving your time and energy, you won’t have any trouble finding plenty of ways to enjoy warm weather, breathtaking sunsets, and the laid-back vibe of the Florida Keys without straying far from your hotel room or rental house in Key West. Here’s a rundown of essential things to do on a Key West babymoon:\n\nTour Old Town Key West\n\nOld Town is really the soul of Key West! Famed for its beautiful architecture, this neighborhood houses many of the island’s most important landmarks. Consider taking a Conch Tour Train to get off your feet for a bit while learning all about the historic estates and buildings around Old Town.\n\nYou should also consider visiting the Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum, Southernmost Point Buoy, and Key West Lighthouse.\n\nVisit Duval Street\n\nWhile Duval has a reputation for being a bit rowdy because it’s the epicenter of bars and clubs in Key West, you can certainly find ways to have fun here even when you’re sticking to a virgin margarita. Duval Street is the ideal destination to enjoy some live music at night.\n\nDuring the day, the neighborhood is actually great for shopping. The point is that you don’t want to skip Duval on a babymoon just because you’ve heard it’s where everyone goes to drink.\n\nSee A Sunset Celebration\n\nIf you haven’t already heard about the famous nightly sunsets at Mallory Square in Key West, this is essential information! For more than 60 years, people have been gathering at Mallory Square nightly to watch the sun setting over the Gulf of Mexico. Kicking off about an hour before sunset, this celebration attracts street performers and food vendors.\n\nAs you stand in this perfect location during your Florida Keys babymoon, you’ll be watching the same exact sunset that was written about by Mark Twain, Tennessee Williams, and many more icons who have been attracted to the beauty and vitality of the Florida Keys over the years.\n\n5) Taste The Flavors Of The Florida Keys\n\nEating your way around Key West is a time-honored tradition that visitors have been doing for decades! When you plan a Florida Keys babymoon or Key West babymoon, you will have opportunities to experience so many refreshing flavors. One thing to know about the Key West culinary scene is that the chefs here like to keep things fresh. Let’s talk about the essential dishes you need to try when you come to Key West.\n\nThe best Key lime pie in the world is found in Key West! The truth is that it doesn’t really matter which restaurant or bakery you choose for your slice because every place here knows how to do this dessert correctly. Here’s a glance at places to enjoy famous Key Lime pie in Key West:\n\nKermit’s Key West Key Lime Pie Shoppe\n\nKey West Key Lime Pie Company\n\nBlue Heaven\n\nMattheessen’s\n\nMoon Dog Cafe and Bakery\n\nOnce you’ve satisfied your sweet tooth with the famous Key lime pie, you can move on to savory dishes. One thing you may not know about the Florida Keys is that the cuisine here leans heavily on Caribbean-inspired dishes. Nearly every restaurant serves fresh seafood. However, you can also find American comfort foods that range from burgers to pizza. If you want the authentic Florida Keys food experience, eat like a local by ordering these staples:\n\nConch fritters\n\nKey West pink shrimp\n\nSpiny lobster\n\nConch chowder\n\nWhile coconut water will certainly keep you feeling refreshed during your romantic babymoon, there’s no shame in picking up some famous Key West rum from one of the local distilleries for the big celebration once the baby is here!\n\nStart Planning Your Florida Keys Babymoon\n\nNo couple ever regrets taking some time away to bond during a babymoon in paradise! Here at Key West Boat Trips, we want to help make your babymoon as magical as possible.
