        "text": "Key Largo manages to keep audiences on their toes or at the edge of their seat from start to finish.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Feb 11, 2024\n\nLoosely based on Maxwell Anderson’s 1939 play, “Key Largo” took the form of a brilliant crime drama anchored by a great cast and superb performances.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Aug 22, 2022\n\nThe real stars of the film are mind games and manipulation, sharply brought to life by the restrained verbal feuding between Bogart and Robinson.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 9/10 | Aug 13, 2020\n\n...there's an inherent theatricality in the situation of strangers involuntarily sharing a small space...\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 8/10 | Feb 26, 2019\n\nIt's pure irony that perhaps the objective best Bogart and Bacall film has their least satisfying onscreen relationship.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 8/10 | Dec 29, 2018\n\nThis is surprisingly staid for a Huston film. Still, the top-notch cast punches it across, and the swirling storm raging outside the hotel provides an interesting backdrop.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Dec 21, 2018\n\nA classy little '40s chamber piece that is competently handled by writer-director John Huston and supremely well acted by its starry cast.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Dec 16, 2018\n\nFirst seen soaking in a tub while chomping on a cigar, Robinson arises from the water to put a stranglehold on the film.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jul 27, 2012\n\nTrapped in a country estate by an impending storm, a mobster attempts to lay low before escaping from the police, but takes a risky gambit holding Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall hostage.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Aug 15, 2011"
