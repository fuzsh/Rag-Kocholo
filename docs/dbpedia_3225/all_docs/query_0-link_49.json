        "text": "Sunburst Inn is located right in the sand of Indian Shores, directly ON the beach. It’s been listed as one of the most beautiful beaches in the country, and we agree! There are many mom-and-pop style restaurants, shops, cafes, and eateries along Gulf Blvd and the surrounding areas. We’re also right next door to Indian Rocks Beach!\n\nWe do not have a gym on premises, but we have partnered with IRB CrossFit to offer our guests the opportunity to workout while on vacation. Contact irbcrossfit.com and tell them you are an SBI guest for 25% off your workout!\n\nWe would LOVE to host your small event at Sunburst Inn. We welcome intimate weddings, corporate retreats, family reunions, and girls’ get-aways to name a few. Rooms blocks are available so you have the entire inn to yourselves. We can set up catering and are happy to help with special requests.\n\nBecause our property is 75 years old, building codes back then were not up to today’s standards. However, some of our rooms on the first floor are more spacious and much more accessible. If you have any mobility concerns, please call us so we can chat more to see how we can be of service.\n\nFull refund for cancellations up to 30 days before check-in. If booked fewer than 30 days before check-in, full refund for cancellations made within 48 hours of booking and at least 14 days before check-in. After that, 50% refund up to 7 days before check-in. No refund after that. Please be advised that all cancellations will require a 4% processing fee.\n\nWe do not make exceptions to our refund policy for any reason, including weather, illness, or other circumstance that interrupts your travel (whether it is within your control or not), and do not accept date changes. So, we always suggest that guests purchase travel insurance for their trip, just in case! This is particularly important from June-November, as weather events in the southeast are considered known travel risks and not eligible for an exception"
