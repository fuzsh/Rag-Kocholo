        "text": "Blessed with year-round sunshine and spectacular scenery, the Florida Keys offers a natural backdrop that is one of a kind. We like to think of the Florida Keys as not just a location, but rather a character in whatever story you are trying to tell.\n\nWe are a full-service film commission providing location and logistics assistance, government liaison, production information, and lots of local color you can’t get anywhere else.\n\nPlease feel free to contact our office with any questions you might have. We look forward to working with you and making your production a success.\n\nSee you in the Keys!\n\n— Chad Newman, Film Commissioner\n\nIt’s the look and feel of the Caribbean with all the conveniences of shooting in the United States.\n\nThe Keys have served as a location site for numerous films, television, videos and catalogue shoots. After all, what other Caribbean-like islands exist that are accessible to a grip truck via an Overseas Highway?\n\nThe color of our surrounding waters, dry balmy winters, accessibility by land, air and sea make the Florida Keys & Key West a diverse, one-of-a-kind location for the film, video and print industry.\n\nHemingway resided here and wrote To Have and Have Not. Tennessee Williams made his home here and filmed A Rose Tattoo in Key West.\n\nThe romance with our islands continues with three seasons of Bloodline filmed up and down the Keys; The Beach Bum shot in Key West; Arnold Schwarzenegger’s True Lies filmed in Marathon and Sugarloaf Key; Up Close and Personal shot at Bahia Honda State Park; I Am Number Four used Islamorada as a location; and most recently Netflix filmed The Laundromat in Key West."
