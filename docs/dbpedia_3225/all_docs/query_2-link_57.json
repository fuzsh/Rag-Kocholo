        "text": "Mile Markers in the Florida Keys\n\nBy Jerry Wilkinson\n\n-\n\nMile Markers (MM) in the Florida Keys are a relative location of a site in reference to the number of miles north of Key West. The business center of unincorporated Key Largo is at about MM 100; therefore, about 100 miles northeast of Key West. The Florida DOT tries to maintain small rectangular green with white number mile marker signs every mile on both sides of the highway.\n\nGenerally except Marathon, addresses along the highway is the MM expressed as a four, five or six digit number. For example, a business with an address of 100511 Overseas Highway would located at about MM 100.5. If the extreme right digit (least significant) number is an even number, it is on the west or Bay/Gulf side. If an odd number it is on the east of ocean side.\n\nSubtracting two MM's gives the approximate number of miles between two known locations.\n\nIf the MM's are getting smaller, one is traveling south or southwest. They are listed from south to north. Note: the farther south in the Keys one is, the highway more east and west the highway runs.\n\nBusiness/commercial locations may change or even disappear. This was compiled early 2003. For example, the Jewfish Creek Drawbridge - MM 107.2 - has been replaced by modern 65 foot fixed concrete span.\n\nI assume this practice began with Henry Flagler who numbered every mile of railroad beginning at Jacksonville (Mile Post 0)and ending at Key West (Mile Post 522. Then for returning northbound trains the number system was reversed., To do this they used white triangular concrete posts with the Mile Post (MP) numbers embossed and painted black on one face and the northbound miles on the second face. On the railroad timetables only the 0 to 522 locations were printed. For researchers to convert a MM to its equivalent MP, substract the MM from 522.\n\nThis list of MM's are approximate as I have recorded them.\n\nItems listed in italics are historical locations and may not still physically exist."
