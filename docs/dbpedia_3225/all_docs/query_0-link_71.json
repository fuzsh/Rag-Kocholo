        "text": "In 1970, a man named Hal Bailey saw a picture and an article about the Queen in an Oregon newspaper with a for sale sign on her. Bailey rescued the Queen and cleaned her up and started running her up and down the Deschutes River in Oregan. Bailey wanted to be able to run the Queen year-round, so he strapped her onto her trailer and began the trip down south.\n\nOnce Bailey got to Florida, he only found disappointment, as the U.S. Coast Guard would not let him launch The African Queen in any waters where they had jurisdiction because she was a foreign-built vessel. So Bailey started looking for a good home for the Queen.\n\nIn 1982, a retired lawyer name James W. Hendricks bought the boat from Bailey and transported the boat south to Key Largo, Florida. She was then taken touring all around the world, from the Queen of England to Ireland, and held her own in a couple of boat races. Now, she is home in Key Largo where to this day she still gives rides to people who want to capture a piece of movie history."
