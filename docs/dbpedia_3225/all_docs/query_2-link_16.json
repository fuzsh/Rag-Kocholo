        "text": "This is everything you need to know about visiting Key Largo, the start of the Florida Keys. See what to expect on the biggest of the Keys, including the main attractions and basic ideas for starting a Florida Keys trip the right way.\n\nVisiting Key Largo in the Upper Keys is a great introduction to the vibe and activities of the Florida Keys. Stretching over 30 miles long and situated between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, this beautiful island is known for its coral reefs, tropical climate, and breathtaking sunsets. With its crystal-clear waters and stunning beaches, Key Largo is a popular destination for visitors seeking outdoor adventures such as scuba diving, snorkeling, kayaking, and fishing.\n\nThe island is also home to the John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, a protected marine reserve, and the first undersea park in the United States. Key Largo offers a unique blend of natural beauty and adventure that makes it an ideal vacation spot for anyone seeking a tropical getaway.\n\nHistory of Key Largo\n\nKey Largo has a recorded history dating back to the early 1800s when the island was primarily inhabited by the Calusa Native American nation. The Calusa were skilled fishermen and hunters who built their homes on the island’s high ground and utilized the surrounding waters for food and transportation.\n\nIn the mid-1800s, European settlers began to arrive on Key Largo, and the island became a hub for the lucrative sponging industry. Divers would harvest natural sponges from the ocean floor and bring them back to Key Largo for processing and shipment to markets throughout the world.\n\nDuring the early 1900s, Key Largo’s economy shifted towards agriculture, and pineapple plantations became the primary industry on the island. However, the Great Depression brought about the decline of the pineapple industry, and Key Largo transitioned towards tourism.\n\nIn the 1960s, the island gained national attention as the setting for the popular movie “Key Largo,” starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. The film was a major success and put Key Largo on the map as a premier vacation destination. And if you’re a Humphrey Bogart fan, when you’re visiting Key Largo you can actually take a ride on the African Queen from the famous film. No, not filmed here, but the boat lives in port here and it’s a great film history tour!\n\nToday, Key Largo is home to a thriving tourism industry and is known for its world-class diving, fishing, and eco-tourism activities. Despite its modern amenities, Key Largo has managed to maintain its laid-back, tropical charm, making it a favorite destination for visitors from around the world.\n\nWas the Film “Key Largo” actually Shot Here?\n\nYes, the film “Key Largo” was actually filmed on location in Key Largo, Florida. The movie was directed by John Huston and starred Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Edward G. Robinson, and Lionel Barrymore, among others. The story takes place in a hotel in Key Largo during a hurricane, where a group of gangsters hold the guests hostage. The film was released in 1948 and was a critical and commercial success, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for Claire Trevor, who won the award. The film’s success helped to put Key Largo on the map as a popular vacation destination, and it remains a classic piece of American cinema.\n\nState Parks and Preserves are on Key Largo\n\nThere are two State Parks, a National Park (part of one) and a National Wildlife Refuge on or near Key Largo. These spots are great for seeing wildlife, bird watching and enjoying the natural side of the Florida Keys. Key Largo is a huge island, so it’s got lots of undeveloped land and marine areas to explore.\n\nJohn Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park\n\nJohn Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park This is the first underwater park in the United States and covers approximately 70 nautical square miles. The park includes the only living coral reef in the continental United States, which can be explored through snorkeling, scuba diving, and glass-bottom boat tours. The park also offers kayaking, canoeing, and hiking trails.\n\nDagny Johnson Key Largo Hammock Botanical State Park\n\nDagny Johnson Key Largo Hammock Botanical State Park is located just north of Key Largo (after the exit from the island) and features 84 protected acres of tropical hardwood hammocks, mangrove swamps, and wetlands. Visitors can explore the park’s trails, which are home to a variety of native plant and animal species, including the endangered Key Largo woodrat and cotton mouse.\n\nCrocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge\n\nThe Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge is a 6,700-acre preserve located in the upper Florida Keys, including parts of Key Largo. The refuge was established in 1980 to protect critical habitat for the endangered American crocodile and other wildlife species.\n\nThe American crocodile is a rare and threatened species that lives in coastal areas, including mangrove swamps, and estuaries throughout the Caribbean, Central, and South America. Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge provides a sanctuary for this species and its habitat, including freshwater marshes, mangrove forests, and saltwater ponds.\n\nThe refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and is closed to the public except for occasional guided tours and research activities.\n\nNote: I wanted to include the Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge here because if you’re looking at a map as you explore Key Largo, you’ll see it and maybe try to visit it. We never want to send anyone on a wild goose (or croc) chase, so it’s good to have all the info before you try to explore.\n\nEverglades National Park\n\nWhile not located directly on Key Largo, Everglades National Park is situated just a short drive north of the island. The park covers over 1.5 million acres of wetlands, mangroves, and forests, and is home to a vast array of plant and animal species. Visitors can explore the park’s wilderness through hiking, boating, and guided tours.\n\nThe Flamingo Entrance located in Homestead is the closest road into Everglades National Park. If you’re spending a week in the Keys and are based out of Key Largo, planning a day trip into Everglades National Park is a great idea. You’ll love the environment and wildlife!\n\nMuseums on Key Largo\n\nWhile Key Largo is primarily known for its natural beauty and outdoor activities, there are a few museums on the island that are worth a visit. Here are some of the top museums on Key Largo:\n\nHistory of Diving Museum\n\nOkay, you caught me; this museum is just south in Islamorada, but it’s only just off Key Largo so I’m including it. The History of Diving Museum is dedicated to the history of diving and features a collection of artifacts and exhibits showcasing the evolution of diving equipment and techniques over time. The museum also hosts educational programs and events, making it a great museum for families and history buffs alike. It’s basically vintage Florida Keys meet underwater culture. Pretty cool! PS: is also has one of the best murals in the Florida Keys!\n\nFlorida Keys Wild Bird Rehabilitation Center\n\nWhile not strictly a museum, the Florida Keys Wild Bird Rehabilitation Center is a non-profit organization that provides care and rehabilitation for injured birds in the Florida Keys. Visitors can take a self-guided tour of the center and learn about the different bird species that call the Keys home. There is also a trail into the mangroves, and throughout the day there are staff present talking about the birds onsite.\n\nBonus: there is an epic strangler fig/banyan tree on property too!\n\nThe Art Scene on Key Largo\n\nWhile the art scene on Key Largo is relatively small, there are a few galleries on the island that showcase the work of local and regional artists.
