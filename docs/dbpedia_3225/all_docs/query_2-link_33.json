        "text": "Overview\n\nLocally owned and operated since 1963, this Key Largo treasure is a great place to kick back and enjoy some of the Key Largo lifestyle and history.\n\nCaribbean Club has gone through a few owners, and it also went through a period of time as a gambling establishment. The movie Key Largo starring Bogie and Bacall was filmed at this Florida beach bar in 1947. Mostly the place was the inspiration for the movie and only some exterior and interior shots were used. But still you will find that this bar is filled with memorabilia from the Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall classic.\n\nHappy hour is from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. every day. Monday nights you can watch a movie on the dock. Tuesdays is Trivia Night and Wednesday is Karaoke Night. Other nights you can catch live bands.\n\nFour nights a week you can listen to great local bands and enjoy a beautiful Key Largo sunset. Reminisce about the \"olden days\" of good black and white movies and enjoy a Keysi moment in time. And bring your dog, too. This is a dog friendly Florida beach bar. It is also cash only, but there is an ATM on site."
