        "text": "Four brave children watch, listen, search, and feel, as they experience the inequalities, dangers and injustices of life in our world.\n\nInspired by real-life activists and campaigners Greta Thunberg, Yusra Mardini, Marley Dias and Iqbal Masih, each of these children is filled with courage, determination and hope. They campaign to help save the planet, show that refugees can contribute and show leadership in sport in their new land, they build a library of 1000 books depicting black girls, they speak out against the outrage of child slavery. Lyrical and powerful, this book is a passionate call to children everywhere to speak their truth and stand up for a better world.\n\nNa'ima B Robert is the award-winning author of over 25 diverse and inclusive books for all ages, from picture books to YA fiction, that have been translated into more than 14 languages. Her picture book Ramadan Moon, with Shirin Adl, became an international bestseller, celebrating the month of Ramadan for younger children. Na'ima is the founder of Sisters, the acclaimed magazine for Muslim women across the world, and was its editor-in-chief for ten years. Na'ima lives in Egypt.\n\nNadine Kaadan is an award-winning children's book author and illustrator from Syria now living in London. She is published in several countries and languages and her mission is to champion empowered and inclusive representation in children's books so that every child can see themselves in a story. Nadine's work with young refugees in mitigating post-conflict trauma has captured the attention of CNN and the BBC, both of which have broadcast special features on her books Tomorrow and The Jasmine Sneeze. She has been nominated for a Kate Greenaway Medal, and is the 2019 winner of the Arab British Centre Award for Culture. Nadine was selected as one of The BBC 100 Women 2020's 'most influential and inspiring women', and was featured on their BBC 100 Women masterclass."
