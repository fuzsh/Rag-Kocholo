        "text": "I found him unconscious on the bed early on Saturday morning and, within two weeks, he was gone.\n\nA shock.\n\nAn out-of-the-blue, out of nowhere, blindsiding shock.\n\nWhen award-winning author and magazine editor Na'ima B. Robert lost her husband of 15 years and found herself solely responsible for their five children and her late husband's company, the entire axis of her world shifted. Suddenly, she was a widow, a single mother, and a reluctant CEO.\n\nBut, through her faith in Allah's plan for her and her decision to choose gratitude over despair, she was able to rise from the tragedy and show up differently: more present, more confident, more powerful, more grateful than ever.\n\n'Show Up: A Motivational Message for Muslim Women' is based on the lessons Na'ima learned on her journey, inviting the reader to show up, authentically and sincerely, in their lives, casting aside the role of victim and instead, living as the hero of their own life story.\n\nThe book is replete with personal stories, quotes from Qur'an, hadith and contemporary thinkers like Seth Godin, Brene Brown and others, as well as action points and space for the reader to reflect and apply the principles."
