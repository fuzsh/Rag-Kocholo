Robert has some interesting stories to tell.\n\nA mother to five children, she crafted a career as an author, specialising in diverse and multicultural children's books, as well as novels for young people and a groundbreaking memoir.\n\nShe founded SISTERS, the magazine for fabulous Muslim women in 2007 and went on to publish for ten years, touching the lives of thousands of readers and launching the careers of dozens of writers.\n\nIn a tragic turn of events, she lost her first husband of 15 years and became, all at once, a widow and the CEO of a company of 300 staff.\n\nShe credits this experience with the expansion and growth she has since experienced as a woman, as a mother, as an entrepreneur and public figure.\n\nHaving travelled the world addressing a variety of audiences and indulging her love for new experiences, Na'ima continues to intrigue and inspire.\n\nAs an outgoing, successful, confident, adventurous veiled Muslim woman, she shatters stereotypes wherever she goes and encourages audiences to address their preconceptions, strip away their prejudices and open themselves up to a transformational experience.\n\nNa'ima's signature style has evolved over the years: she has a unique ability to command attention from the stage and connect with women and men of all ages and from different backgrounds, with her blend of honesty, vulnerability, strength and humour.\n\nHer keynote presentations typically leave the audience shaken, stirred and ready to make big changes in their lives and finally show up as the heroes of their life stories."
