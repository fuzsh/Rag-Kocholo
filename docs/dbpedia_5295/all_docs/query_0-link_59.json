        "text": "Title: A Child Like You - Hardcover\n\nAuthor: Na’ima B. Robert / Illustrated by Nadine Kaadan\n\nISBN: 9781623717230\n\nPublisher: Interlink Publishing\n\nAge: 4-8\n\nAn empowering picture book that encourages children to feel that they can have a positive impact on the future in a troubled world, inspired by real-life activists and campaigners.\n\n“Somewhere, out there, in the wide, wide world, a child like you is watching …”\n\nFour brave children watch, listen, search, and feel, as they experience the inequalities, dangers, and injustices of life in our world.\n\nInspired by real-life activists and campaigners Greta Thunberg, Yusra Mardini, Marley Dias, and Iqbal Masih, each of these children are filled with courage, determination and hope.\n\nThey will campaign to help save the planet, show that refugees can contribute, and show leadership in sport in their new land, they will build a library of 1,000 books depicting black girls, they will speak out against the outrage of child slavery.\n\n“A meaningful call to action … Encouragement for the future leaders and caretakers of our planet inspired by four real-life youth activists. As Robert points out, ‘the world can be a scary place sometimes.’ Climate change is wreaking havoc on our environment, refugees make perilous journeys in search of a better life, many children from marginalized backgrounds are unable to see themselves reflected in literature, and young people feel uncertain and afraid. Despite these painful realities, the book points out several reasons to be optimistic. Young people are protesting, participating, imagining, and fighting their way toward a better future … Rather than brushing over harsh realities, Robert and Kaadan acknowledge children’s very real fears while empowering them and offering hope.”\n\n— Kirkus Reviews\n\nAbout the author:\n\nNa’ima B. Robert: is a writer and campaigner. Celebrated for her memoir From My Sisters Lips (2005) she has written over twenty books for children and teens, and founded Sisters Magazine, of which she was editor-in-chief for ten years.\n\nNadine Kaadan: is a Syrian illustrator, author and worker with refugee children.
