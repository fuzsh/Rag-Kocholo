        "text": "English actor (born 1986)\n\nFor the British politician, see Robert Pattinson (politician).\n\nRobert Douglas Thomas Pattinson[1][2] (born 13 May 1986) is an English actor. Known for starring in both big-budget and independent films, Pattinson has ranked among the world's highest-paid actors. In 2010, Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world, and he was featured in the Forbes Celebrity 100 list.\n\nAfter starting to act in a London theatre club at age 15, Pattinson began his film career by playing Cedric Diggory in the fantasy film Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005). He gained worldwide recognition for portraying Edward Cullen in The Twilight Saga film series (2008–2012), which grossed over $3.3 billion worldwide. After starring in the romantic dramas Remember Me (2010) and Water for Elephants (2011), Pattinson began working in independent films from auteur directors. He received praise for his starring roles in David Cronenberg's thriller Cosmopolis (2012), James Gray's adventure drama The Lost City of Z (2016), the Safdie Brothers' crime drama Good Time (2017), Claire Denis' science-fiction drama High Life (2018), and Robert Eggers' psychological horror film The Lighthouse (2019). He returned to mainstream films with a leading role in Christopher Nolan's spy film Tenet (2020), and starred as Bruce Wayne / Batman in Matt Reeves' superhero film The Batman (2022).\n\nAside from acting, Pattinson plays music and has sung on several soundtracks for film. He supports several charities, including the GO Campaign, and has been the face of Dior Homme fragrance since 2013.\n\nEarly life\n\nPattinson was born on 13 May 1986 in London,[3][4] the youngest of three children of Clare (Charlton), a scout at a modelling agency, and Richard Pattinson, a vintage car dealer.[5] He grew up in a small home in Barnes with two older sisters, Elizabeth (Lizzy) and Victoria.[6] Pattinson started learning the guitar and piano at the age of four.[7] He attended Tower House School, from which, aged 12, he was expelled for shoplifting adult magazines at a post office shop and selling them later to his male classmates.[8] He completed his schooling at the Harrodian School.[9][10] As a teenager he worked as a photo model for British fashion brands and magazines to improve his pocket money and developed a love of cinema where he counted Jack Nicholson, Marlon Brando and Jean-Paul Belmondo among his acting idols.[11] In his late teens and early twenties, he performed acoustic guitar gigs at open mic nights in pubs around London where he sang his own written songs either solo under the stage name Bobby Dupea, or with his band Bad Girls. He was a frequent performer at the pub The Spice of Life in London's Soho at open mic nights.[12][13][14]\n\nPattinson considered becoming a musician or going to university to study speechwriting but never thought about pursuing an acting career; his teacher in school even advised him not to join the drama club because she thought he was not suited for the creative arts.[15][16] However, when he was 13, he joined the local amateur theatre club called Barnes Theatre Company after his father convinced him to attend because he was quite shy.[17][18] At age 15 and after two years of working backstage, he auditioned for the play Guys and Dolls and he got his first role as a Cuban dancer with no lines. He got the lead role of George Gibbs in the next play Our Town,[10] was spotted by a talent agent who was sitting in the audience and he began looking for professional roles.[19] He also appeared in the plays Macbeth, Anything Goes, and Tess of the d'Urbervilles.[20][21][16] Pattinson had planned to go to university, but did not because the shoot for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire went over schedule. He used to share a flat in London's Soho with fellow actor and good friend Tom Sturridge.[22]\n\nCareer\n\n2004–2007: Career beginnings\n\nPattinson had supporting roles in the German made-for-television film Ring of the Nibelungs in 2004, and in director Mira Nair's costume drama Vanity Fair, although his scenes in the latter were deleted and only appear on the DVD version.[23][24] In May 2005, he was scheduled to appear in the UK premiere of The Woman Before at the Royal Court Theatre, but was fired shortly before the opening night and was replaced by Tom Riley.[25] Later in 2005, Pattinson played Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.[26] Pattinson learned how to scuba dive to play the role of Diggory.[27] For this role, he was named the 2005 \"British Star of Tomorrow\" by The Times.[28] During this period, he was hailed as \"the next Jude Law\".[10][29][30]\n\nIn 2006, Pattinson appeared in The Haunted Airman a psychological thriller, aired on BBC Four on 31 October, and he earned favourable reviews.[31][32][33] The Stage praised his performance by saying that \"[he] played the airman of the title with a perfect combination of youthful terror and world weary cynicism.\"[34] On 19 February 2007, he appeared in a supporting role in a one-off television drama based on the best-selling novel by Kate Long, The Bad Mother's Handbook.[35][36]\n\n2008–2013: The Twilight Saga and worldwide recognition\n\nIn 2008, Pattinson was cast as Edward Cullen in Twilight, based on the novel by Stephenie Meyer. According to TV Guide, Pattinson was apprehensive about auditioning, fearful that he would not be able to live up to the \"perfection\" expected from the character.[37] The film was released on 21 November 2008 and turned Pattinson into a movie star overnight.[38] Although the film received mixed reviews, critics praised his chemistry with co-star Kristen Stewart.[39] The New York Times called Pattinson a \"capable and exotically beautiful\" actor[40] and Roger Ebert said he was \"well-chosen\" for the role.[41]\n\nPattinson's other release of 2008, How to Be, was a low-budget comedy drama film written and directed by Oliver Irving.[42][43] It screened at number of film festivals, earning mixed reviews from critics.[44][45] Pattinson then starred as Salvador Dalí in the film Little Ashes, a Spanish-British drama directed by Paul Morrison.[46] He also starred in a short film entitled The Summer House, directed by Daisy Gili.[47] This short film was later re-released as a part of an anthology film titled Love & Distrust, comprising five short films following eight individuals from diverse backgrounds on their quest for true contentment.[48][49]\n\nPattinson reprised his role as Edward Cullen in the Twilight sequel, The Twilight Saga: New Moon, which was released on 20 November 2009. The film earned a record-breaking $142,839,137 on its opening weekend and earned an overall $709,827,462 worldwide.[50] Though the film received negative reviews, film critic Michael Phillips from the Chicago Tribune said that Pattinson was \"interesting to watch\" despite bad makeup.[51] Bill GoodyKoontz from the Arizona Republic said that \"Pattinson's actually not in the film that much, but he does his best when he's around\"[52] and Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post noted that his acting was \"uniformly strong\".[53] New Moon brought Pattinson global stardom[54][55] and made him one of the highest-paid actors in the world.[56][57][58]\n\nIn 2009, Pattinson presented at the 81st Academy Awards ceremony.[59] On 10 November 2009, Revolver Entertainment released the DVD Robsessed, a documentary on Pattinson's life and popularity.[60] His next film, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, was released on 30 June 2010, earning $698,491,347 worldwide.[61][62] The film received mixed reviews. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised Pattinson's performance, stating that \"(he) makes you forget the white makeup and weird eye contact lenses – to focus on a character torn between his love for the human Bella (Stewart) and the knowledge that she'll have to let go of her beating heart if she's to stay with him forever\".[63] Will Lawrence of Empire Online praised the performance of three leads of the film, stating that \"all three corners of the love triangle look sharper than before: the most accomplished actor, Stewart, still lip-biting, Lautner still pec-flexing, and Pattinson not fully shaking that fiery-eyed pout. But all have grown into their roles, cutting loose in a film that (thankfully) sidesteps the melodrama of its prequels\".[64]\n\nPattinson executive-produced and starred in the film Remember Me, which was released on 12 March 2010.[65] Though the film received mixed reviews, some critics praised his performance. Jake Coyle of The Associated Press said that Pattinson had \"an unmistakable screen presence\" but \"pour[ed] it on thickly and self-consciously. With low eyes, sleeves rolled up just so and cigarette drooping artfully from his mouth, Tyler (like Edward Cullen) is a reluctant romantic\".[66] However, Ian Nathan of Empire Online stated that the film was \"the best thing\" Pattinson had done.[67] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised his chemistry with co-star Emilie de Ravin in the film, stating that the \"scenes between Pattinson and de Ravin exude genuine charm.\"[68]\n\nIn 2011, Pattinson starred as Jacob Jankowski in Water for Elephants, adapted from the novel by Sara Gruen.[69] The film received mixed reviews, but Pattinson's performance was praised. Film critic Richard Corliss from Time praised Pattinson for being \"shy and watchful\" and said that he \"radiates a slow magnetism that locks the viewer's eyes on him\", ultimately calling him \"star quality\".[70] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle stated that Pattinson succeeded at holding his own at the center of a major feature and was \"endlessly watchable\".[71] Peter Travers of the Rolling Stone said he \"smolders\" in the film[72] and Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said that \"Pattinson is entirely convincing as Jacob\".[73]\n\nPattinson reprised the role of Edward Cullen in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1, which was released on 18 November 2011 and earned $705,058,657 at the worldwide box office.[74] The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 24% of critics (of the 188 counted reviews) gave the film positive reviews; the site's consensus reads, \"Slow, joyless, and loaded with unintentionally humorous moments, Breaking Dawn Part 1 may satisfy the Twilight faithful, but it's strictly for fans of the franchise\".[75] Pattinson also played Georges Duroy in a film adaptation of the 1885 novel Bel Ami, and the film had a world premiere at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival.[76] It was released on 12 February 2012.[77]\n\nPattinson starred in the film adaptation of Don DeLillo's Cosmopolis, directed by David Cronenberg.[78] The film competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.[79][80] It was well received, with Pattinson's performance particularly praised. Justin Chang of Variety wrote, \"An eerily precise match of filmmaker and material, Cosmopolis probes the soullessness of the 1% with the cinematic equivalent of latex gloves. ... Pattinson's excellent performance reps an indispensable asset.\"[81] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph stated that it is a sensational performance from Robert Pattinson, \"yes, that Robert Pattinson – as Packer. Pattinson plays him like a human caldera; stony on the surface, with volcanic chambers of nervous energy and self-loathing churning deep below.\"[82] And Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly stated, \"Pattinson, pale and predatory even without his pasty-white vampire makeup, delivers his frigid pensées with rhythmic confidence.\"[83]\n\nPattinson starred one last time as Edward Cullen in the final instalment of the Twilight saga, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 which was released on 16 November 2012, and has grossed over $829 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of the Twilight series.[84][85] At Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 48% approval rating, based on 174 reviews with the consensus stating: \"It is the most enjoyable chapter in The Twilight Saga, but that's not enough to make Breaking Dawn Part 2 worth watching for filmgoers who don't already count themselves among the franchise converts.\"[86]\n\n2014–2019: Independent films and critical acclaim\n\nIn May 2014, two of Pattinson's films premiered at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.[87] First, Pattinson starred in David Michôd's futuristic western The Rover,[88] alongside Guy Pearce and Scoot McNairy.[89][90] The film had its premiere out of competition at the festival.[91] For his performance as a naïve simpleton member of the criminal gang, Pattinson drew rave reviews. Scott Foundas of Variety said that \"Pattinson who turns out to be the film's greatest surprise, sporting a convincing Southern accent and bringing an understated dignity to a role that might easily have been milked for cheap sentimental effects.\" He further added that \"(it is) a career re-defining performance for Pattinson that reveals untold depths of sensitivity and feeling.\"[92] Todd McCarthy, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, wrote that \"Pattinson delivers a performance that, despite the character's own limitations, becomes more interesting as the film moves along.\"[93] Jessica Kiang in her review for The Playlist, noted that \"(Pattinson) turns in a performance that manages to be more affecting than affected.\"[94]\n\nNext, he reunited with Cronenberg in Maps to the Stars, a satirical drama described as a darkly comic look at Hollywood excess.[95][96] The film competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.[97] In the film, he played the role of Jerome Fontana, a limo driver and struggling actor, who wants to be a successful screenwriter.[98] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph summed up his performance as \"winningly played.\"[99]\n\nIn 2015, two of his films premiered at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival in February. First he appeared in Werner Herzog's adaptation of Gertrude Bell's biopic film Queen of the Desert alongside Nicole Kidman and James Franco.[100][101] Pattinson appeared as T. E. Lawrence aka Lawrence Of Arabia in the film, which Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent described as \"comic and a very long way removed from Peter O'Toole. He plays Lawrence Of Arabia as a sharp-tongued, sardonic figure who can see through the pretensions of his bosses and colleagues.\"[102] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter called his role \"brief but significant\" and concluded that \"the easy camaraderie in his scenes with Kidman is appealing.\"[103] Sam Adams of Indiewire said that, \"Robert Pattinson gets relatively high marks for his brief turn as the bonafide T.E. Lawrence.\"[104]\n\nNext he starred in Anton Corbijn's Life as Life Magazine photographer Dennis Stock; the film deals with the friendship between actor James Dean and Stock.[105][106] Critical reception for the film was mixed but Pattinson received appreciation for his performance as a photographer. Guy Lodge of Variety called his performance a \"sly turn\",[107] Little White Lies said that \"Pattinson's performance is as crisp as the white shirt and black suits his character always wears. This is a camouflage for his own problems that slowly unfurl, adding colour and improving the film.\"[108] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter noted that Pattinson \"gives arguably the most fully rounded performance.\"[109]\n\nIn late 2015, Pattinson appeared in Brady Corbet's directorial debut film The Childhood of a Leader, alongside Bérénice Bejo and Stacy Martin.[110][111] In the film, he played the dual roles, first a brief but crucial role of Charles Marker, a reporter in Germany during World War I and later as an adult version of the leader. He received praise for his performance, which Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called \"elegant\"[112] and Lee Marshall of Screen International described as \"excellent\".[113]\n\nIn 2016, Pattinson appeared in Paramount Pictures and Plan B Entertainment's adaptation of The Lost City of Z, directed by James Gray.[114][115] Premiered at the New York Film Festival, the film starred Pattinson as British explorer Corporal Henry Costin. He grew a heavy beard and lost 35 pounds (16 kg) for the film.[116] Earning critical praise for his role, Matt Neg of NBP described him as \"one of the better actors working today\",[117] Keith Uhlich in his review for Brooklyn Magazine called him \"subtle scene-stealer\",[118] and Linda Marric writing for Heyuguys find his performance \"an impressively subtle, yet brilliant.\"[119]\n\nPattinson next starred in the Safdie Brothers' neo-exploitation thriller Good Time, as a bank robber, Connie Nikas,[120] which he has described as a \"really hardcore kind of Queens, New York, mentally damaged psychopath, bank robbery movie.\"[121] The film premiered in competition at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival[122] and proved to be a turning point in his career. Pattinson's performance garnered critical acclaim. Guy Lodge of Variety described it as his \"career-peak\",[123] Eric Kohn of Indiewire called it \"his Career-Best\"[124] and David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter drew comparisons with Al Pacino's Sonny Wortzik in Dog Day Afternoon, and ultimately noted it as \"his most commanding performance to date.\"[125] Pattinson received his first Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead for his performance in the film.[126][127]\n\nIn August 2017, while promoting Good Time, Pattinson wrote and starred in a short film for GQ, titled Fear & Shame, which was described by the magazine as, \"Robert Pattinson Battles Fame and Fear to Get a New York Street Dog\". Shot on the streets of New York, the film narrates Pattinson's journey to buy a hot dog while avoiding media and fans in the hustle of the city.[128][129][130] The A.V. Club called it \"bizarre and delightful\".[131] While IndieWire said that \"he's got a bright\" and \"shimmering future\".[132]\n\nZellner Brothers' western-comedy Damsel was his first comedy since his 2008 film How to Be.[133] Pattinson portrayed Samuel Alabaster, an eccentric pioneer who travels west in search of his fiancée. His performance was favourably received: the New York Post described it as a \"hilariously oddball performance\"[134] and The A.V. Club found him \"easily the best thing about Damsel\".[135]\n\nHis last film of 2018 was Claire Denis' science-fiction drama film High Life, set in space, about team of criminals traveling towards a black hole.[136][137] Denis initially had Philip Seymour Hoffman in mind for the role of the protagonist, but after becoming aware of Pattinson's commitment and desire to work with her, she cast him in the role instead.[138] Pattinson starred as Monte, one of the criminals on the spaceship, who became a father against his wishes through artificial insemination, and raised his daughter as the ship progressed to the black hole. Critics praised the film with Allen Hunter of Screen International noting Pattinson as the most \"dominant\" and \"engaging\" element in the film[139] and Jason Bailey of The Playlist called it \"another scorching Pattinson performance; he plays the character's menace and rebellion with brio\".[140]\n\nPattinson's first 2019 role was Robert Eggers's black-and-white psychological horror film The Lighthouse, set on a remote New England island in the 1890s.[141] The film premiered at the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, with widespread critical acclaim for both the film overall and Pattinson's performance.[142][143] In his review for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw described Pattinson's performance as \"mesmeric\" and a \"sledgehammer punch,\" which \"just gets better and better.\"[144] Gregory Ellwood, writing for Collider, said that Pattinson has \"topped himself here\" and his performance is \"so transformative it's jarring. You simply never thought he had it in him.\"[145] He received his second Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead for the film.[146]\n\nPattinson's following two film releases premiered at 2019 Venice Film Festival; he starred in his second collaboration with director David Michôd, an adaptation of William Shakespeare's plays titled The King.[147][148] He played Louis, The Dauphin, who served as the nemesis of Henry V. For the role, Pattinson adopted a French accent, which he based on the fashion industry people of France.[149] Though divided on his accent, critics found his performance the \"scene-stealing\" and \"highlight\" of the film.[150][151] He then appeared in Ciro Guerra's Waiting for the Barbarians, based on a 1980 novel by J. M. Coetzee, alongside Mark Rylance and Johnny Depp.[152] Boyd van Hoeij writing for The Hollywood Reporter called his character as \"a rather flat supporting role\", while The Guardian described his performance as \"stiff\" and \"over-articulated\".[153][154]\n\n2020–present: Return to mainstream films\n\nPattinson starred as a spy handler in Christopher Nolan's Tenet (2020), alongside John David Washington, and it marked his return to big-budget films. He based his character's mannerisms on those of author Christopher Hitchens.[155] Jessica Kiang of The New York Times labelled him as \"delightful\" and praised his chemistry with Washington.[156] Pattinson next featured as part of an ensemble cast in The Devil All the Time, a psychological thriller based on the novel by Donald Ray Pollock.[157] Both the film and Pattinson's performance as a lewd small town preacher received mixed reviews.[158][159] Nonetheless, Austin Collin of Rolling Stone found him \"eely, eerie, [and] intriguing\", while Owen Gleiberman of Variety noted that he did \"a stylish job\".[160][161]\n\nPattinson starred as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Matt Reeves's 2022 superhero film The Batman.[162][163][164] Reeves, following Ben Affleck's departure from the role, wrote the character of Bruce Wayne with Pattinson in mind after seeing his performance in Good Time.[165] The announcement of Pattinson's casting was met with backlash from some Batman fans, but the ultimate portrayal of the superhero was applauded by critics following its release.[166][167] Pattinson voiced the titular grey heron in the English-language dub of the 2023 Japanese animated film The Boy and the Heron by Hayao Miyazaki.[168]\n\nPattinson is set to star in Bong Joon-ho's upcoming science-fiction film Mickey 17, based on Edward Ashton's novel Mickey7.[169]\n\nOther ventures\n\nModelling and endorsements\n\nPattinson began modelling at age 12, but his workload began to decrease four years later. In December 2008, he blamed the lack of modelling work on his masculine appearance: \"When I first started I was quite tall and looked like a girl, so I got lots of jobs, because it was during that period where the androgynous look was cool. Then, I guess, I became too much of a guy, so I never got any more jobs.
