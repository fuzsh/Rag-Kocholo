        "text": "Show Up\n\nNai’ma shares the story of how she came to understand the meaning of ‘Showing Up’ through tragic circumstances and enormous life changes.\n\nSo many of us sleepwalk through life: frustrated, unhappy and lacking confidence in our abilities and accomplishments, destined never to reach our full potential. We allow our limiting beliefs to hold us back. We allow our challenges to define us. We allow other people’s expectations to imprison us.\n\n‘Show Up: A Motivational Message for Muslim Women’ is based on the lessons Na’ima learnt on her journey, inviting the reader to show up, authentically and sincerely, in their lives, casting aside the role of victim and instead, living as the hero of their own life story.\n\nAward-winning author and magazine editor Na’ima B. Robert lost her husband of 15 years and found herself solely responsible for their five children and her late husband’s company, the entire axis of her world shifted. Suddenly, she was a widow, a single mother, and a reluctant CEO. But, through her faith in Allah’s plan for her and her decision to choose gratitude over despair, she was able to rise from the tragedy and show up differently: more present, more confident, more powerful, and more grateful than ever.\n\n“I chose to see that challenge, not as a setback but, as a set up for a comeback”\n\nThe book is replete with personal stories, quotes from Qur’an, hadith and contemporary thinkers, as well as action points and space for the reader to reflect and apply the principles.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nNaima B. Robert, is a trail-blazing speaker, coach, and best-selling author of ‘From My Sisters Lips’, as well as over 25 other books for adults, teens and children, many of which have been translated into over 14 languages. She is the recipient of several literary awards and is a respected author of diverse fiction, including her newest book with popular speaker Mufti Menk.\n\nABOUT THE BOOK\n\nShow Up: A Motivational Message for Muslim Women by Na’ima B. Robert\n\n120pp | Paperback\n\nWhat does ‘Showing Up’ in\n\nYOUR life look like?\n\nEvery day, you play a multitude of roles:\n\nWorshipper\n\nWoman\n\nWife\n\nMother\n\nDaughter\n\nFriend\n\nBoss\n\nLeader\n\nWhat would it look like if you showed up – sincerely and authentically – in any one of those roles? How transformational would that be for you and for those who love you?\n\nIf you brought humility to your acts of worship;\n\nIf you brought joy to your womanhood;\n\nIf you brought sincerity to your wifely duties;\n\nIf you brought intention to your mothering;\n\nIf you brought passion to your work;\n\nIf you brought focus to your relationships.\n\nWe don’t have to live on autopilot.\n\nWe can show up as the hero in any given role. We can all take the easy route and choose to hide our true selves, rather than stepping into our power and claiming our authentic identity, both for ourselves and others. I know that I hid behind a particular identity for years. I wanted to be liked and respected by everyone. I wanted to be the acceptable role model. I wanted to live up to everyone’s expectations of me. But if living up to other people’s expectations forces you to hide who you truly are and what you truly believe in, it can be a source of frustration and, more seriously, dissonance.\n\nFor a long time, it was like there were two versions of me: the public version and the private version. And the two were not always aligned. I found myself slipping into one or the other, depending on who I was with, and what was expected of me. what does ‘showing up’ in your life look like?\n\nThis meant that, while I was showing up in a particular way in public, this wasn’t reflected in my private life. In public, I was a woman of goals and ambitions, a woman who inspired others to level up and aim higher. But, to my own family, I was none of those things. It pains me to say this but, for the longest time, I had been telling myself a story. The story was that I am not a good mother, that being a mum is ‘not my thing’, that my children don’t really need me, that they are not my biggest legacy.\n\nI know that may sound shocking especially as, in Islam, we are encouraged to revere the mother and the role she plays in the stability of the family and raising the next generation. But that’s where I was. It was a story that helped me to hide from my own failings and weaknesses and made me feel better about the fact that I didn’t really have a vision for my family. But it was also a story that was stopping me from getting out of my comfort zone and truly pushing past my fears and self-doubt to find the gold on the other side.\n\nBecause, when I decided to challenge that story, and choose a different, more empowering belief – that my children deserve the best of me and they are my greatest gift to the world – everything changed.\n\nI decided to take extreme ownership for my children’s development and wellbeing. I decided to stop hiding away behind my work and business, and step out into a new space of vulnerable and authentic leadership. It is scary and unfamiliar, but I can see the benefits already, and so can my children. I am\n\nshowing up for them, 100% authentic and real. And I know we will all be the better for it, insha Allah.\n\nSo, what will showing up look like for you? Well, as you can imagine, showing up in the different roles you play will look different at different stages of your life. The defining features of showing up, however, do not change: Showing up requires you to be present, authentic and sincere. Let’s have a look at how you could be present, authentic and sincere in the different spheres of your life.\n\nShowing up for yourself\n\nThere are two vital components of showing up for yourself: self-acceptance and self-love. Without these two ingredients, it is far too easy to sleepwalk through your own life, neglecting yourself and your needs and never fully living up to your potential as a blessed creation of Allah (swt).\n\nAvailable at Kube and on Amazon\n\nUK\n\nUS"
