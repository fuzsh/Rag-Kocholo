Moorishgirl features literary news, commentary, book reviews and author interviews as well as political and cultural debates. Najat El Hashimi (2011) is a writer and owner of the distinguished Ramon Llull Prize (2008) and the Prix Ulysse (2009). Naima.B.Robert (1977) is an author of multicultural literature and founding editor of the UK-based Muslim women’s publication, SISTERS Magazine. Their contemporary postcolonial writing manifests that the body becomes a site of cultural encounters, identity negotiation, women’s agency, and proof of the trauma of displacement. They explore the ways women’s bodies are, as I would argue, exiled socio-culturally and sexually controlled as well as their resistance to indigenous and colonial domination. This paper shall examine their works within a tradition of northward and eastward travel literature from Africa or the Orient to Europe and vice versa in terms of gender, femininity, sexuality, and the ways bodies are presenting and resisting the hegemonic discourses."
