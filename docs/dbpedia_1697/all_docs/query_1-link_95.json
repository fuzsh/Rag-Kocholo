Spring makes me want to play some of the punk rock.\n\n“I wanna go to New York City, I just know it’s the place for me…”\n\nThe Demics - New York City\n\n“I’ve been drinkin’, but drinkin’ doesn’t make me… feeeeeeeeeeeel alright.”\n\nSlow - Have Not Been The Same\n\n“You can call it whatcha like! Come on, stand up for your rights!”\n\nD.O.A. - General Strike\n\n“HEY!” PS: Best video ever.\n\nThe Gruesomes - Hey!\n\n“A pillow and a coffin’s just as nice as a bed…”\n\nForgotten Rebels - Fuck Me Dead\n\n“Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah…”\n\nDayglo Abortions - ARGH FUCK KILL / Die Sinner Die!\n\n“I lie to myself and to my friends too! If I want your girl, I’ll lie to you too!”\n\nSubhumans - Slave To My Dick\n\nSadly, I couldn’t find any Dik Van Dikes on YouTube, so you’ll have to trust me that “The Birthday Song” by The Dik Van Dikes is totally awesome.\n\nI can see where you’re coming from on that, but punk vs. new wave can be an awfully fine hair to split. I would say the line gets drawn somewhere around Martha and the Muffins.\n\nI think given their role in the growth of the Canadian punk scene (and particularly the Toronto punk scene in the late 70s and early 80s with bands like Teenage Head and the Viletones), plus the “Waking Up Tired” singalong in Hard Core Logo, these guys earned some pretty solid punk rawk stripes.\n\nAnd it’s a great song, wherever you think they lie on the spectrum. :)"
