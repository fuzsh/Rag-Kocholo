        "text": "13 January 2023\n\nJanuary is a long, miserable, cold, wet month so a night with one of the best punk bands to grace the planet is the perfect antidote. January gigs always carry the risk that people will be too skint, but not too night with tickets sold out. With pre-orders now live for Silence Is No Reaction – the new Ian Glasper book about the band – it was perfect timing for Subhumans to be touring.\n\nThe venue is tucked away at the back of an industrial estate in the shadow of Portsmouth FC’s Fratton Park ground. Although we feared that at the end of the deserted dark alley, we were likely to stumble upon a major international drug deal in the process, the bright lights of the Staggeringly Good Brewery were like an oasis. Their porter was Good and by the end of the night I was Staggering.\n\nOnce inside, one of my companions, Ady, spotted that one half of local grindcore two-piece Scab was working behind the bar and as we chatted to a couple of the younger people in the crowd, it transpired that I was talking to the other half, who also works at the Brewery.\n\nThe gig took place in the 150-capacity tap room which seemed somewhat sparse with a tiled floor, high ceilings and plenty of brick and metal. This would make for a rather echoey sound tonight, which really took me back to DIY gigs that used to take place in cavernous community halls and the like – before music venues realised that the drinking capacity of punks made for a good source of income and they weren’t going to trash the place. That tiled floor became incredibly sticky as the night wore on and pints were spilled by young punks careening into the crowd. Another nice factor was that I found myself talking to people I’d never met before and this gave the whole thing a vibe of a gig in a youth club back in the day.\n\nThe Dinz, who had organised tonight’s shindig, took to the stage – a few sheets of wood raised a foot or so in front of the metal shutters of the loading bay. They take their name from the local dialect dinlo, meaning an idiot. I’m led to believe the word has roots in Romany. There seemed to be a strong audience reaction and I guessed that some of the local crowd were there for The Dinz as much as Subhumans. The demographic certainly was dominated by the older end of the spectrum. A few of the young punks started throwing each other about halfway through the set. “I’m Alright” in particular seemed to be a popular number.\n\nThe Dinz have definitely improved since I last saw them in the summer, with the tempo up a notch or two and the guitar much dirtier. Their sound is yobbish yet tuneful street urchin punk that made bands like Sham 69 and the Cockney Rejects so popular in the late 70s and early 80s. They’ve got some nice bouncing bass lines and the odd bit of rabid drumming reminiscent of some of the bands on Riot City. (Drummer Turkee was in local 80’s legends Ad Nauseum actually Nath -Factcheck Ed) Throw in some of the thuggery of The Stooges and The Business and you’re nearly there. The vocals range from singing to shouting and at times so high pitched I thought Joe Pasquale had invaded the stage. The Dinz are not an Oi! band but there were a few moments where I was half expecting a Cock Sparrer song to appear. As they closed their set I realised that the timbre was not far off that of Nick Cash from 999. Finishing on their anthem “We Are The Dinz”, which they dedicated to local music scene stalwart Jim Cruttenden who had recently died, The Dinz had got proceedings off to a good start.\n\nWith the room nicely warmed up, it was the turn of Subhumans. They are always good. I’ve never seen them do a bad gig. I don’t know anyone who has! Subhumans deserve the accolade of the most consistent band in punk. Even if they seem to be in a not-so-great mood they will always turn out a great set. And there was no way that the challenging sound tonight was going to get in the way.\n\nThe Subhumans significant back catalogue is all killer, no filler. Catchy tunes, neat solos, key changes, bass runs, neat drum patterns and fills, singalong choruses. Bruce’s guitar playing is mercurial. Trotsky never drops a beat and hits those drums hard. Phil makes the often complex bass lines look easy. Subhumans have written so many really good anthemic punk songs that range from angry to sarcastic to fun. Dick’s lyrics are simultaneously intelligent, witty, thought-provoking, and political yet accessibly down to earth.\n\nKicking off with Apathy from their Worlds Apart album followed by Forget from The Day The Country Died they then launched into Rats with a suitable rant about capitalism and the Stop The City protests that the song set out. And they kept going, knocking out songs from across their career. When they played a song from their recent album, the younger element of the crowd exploded in front of the stage and the dancing didn’t stop. It was really nice to see the youth owning the gig when the majority of the crowd, who were well into at least their 50s, rightly took a step back. However, Dick matched them, bouncing about full of beans and flapping the microphone around – making a non-blurry photo difficult to capture.\n\nWith so many good songs it is difficult to pick out any for special mention. There was another good-humoured rant from singer, Dick, about nasty chemicals to make you smell nice being tested on animals before they launched into Evolution, which really made the dance floor go off. The skanking Ruts-esque Human Error sounded particularly good tonight. One of the songs which benefited from the echoey sound. The thing is, I got swept away in the moment so had no concept of time passing, or how many songs they had done. This is the mark of a good band. Even though songs from their EPs and first couple of albums are my personal favourites, there was no point where I found myself distracted or deciding now was a good time to hit the bar.\n\nAll things must come to an end so Dick announced that they had to pretend to have a short break (literally seconds) and go through the charade of pretending the encore was spontaneous rather than planned or people would expect an encore after they’d finished the set. One of Subhumans redeeming factors is their brutal honesty and humour! Then it came to the last 3 tunes: No, which got the crowd really riled up; Work Rest Play Die, which is always a favourite, and then they bowed out, as ever with Religious Wars. Still the most consistent band in punk.\n\n~\n\nSubhumans Facebook\n\nWords by Nathan Brown. Author archive here.\n\nPictures by Tony Whatley (Suspect Device zine)\n\nWe have a small favour to ask.
