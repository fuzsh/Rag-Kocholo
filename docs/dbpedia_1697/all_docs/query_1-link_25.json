        "text": "The MoBBallet Roll Call is being revised and expanded!⁠ In 2015 the Roll Call began as a crowd sourced database of the names of professional Black ballet dancers. Founder Theresa Ruth Howard wanted to make this list a Black ballet Wikipedia, and we gradually expanded to design biography pages or as we call them “Artist Pages” for every name on the list. ⁠ This is no easy task given the lack of documentation on Black participation (overall) but specifically in areas like the classical arts.⁠ ⁠ We conducted deep dive research earlier, and more obscure artists, and even gathered information from their former colleagues to cobble together even the slightest of bios for them. For more contemporary artists we pulled existing bios in company, personal websites, and festival or guesting listings. Although we do not function like Wikipidea where anyone can make changes at any time we encourage artists to view their pages and should they like to make amendments (update information, add or change photos and links) send all the information as you would like it to appear and we will place it in the queue to be applied. ⁠ We issued a call to action encouraging dancers to submit the information they would like on their page. Unfortunately there was little response. However we do not let that stop us. That being stated. We once again encourage artists to share their information by emailing. If you would like your name ADDED to the Roll Call go the Roll Call on mobballet.org and choose ADD YOUR NAME TO THE ROLL CALL. (it will not automatically populate) ⁠ ⁠ If you would like to update your MoBBallet Artist Page please send: Updated bio, links, and pictures to: estewart.mobb@gmail.com⁠ ⁠ Know your History- Learn your Legacy- Carry it forth...⁠ ⁠ #mobballet #mobbsters #blacksinballet #wearenotunicorns #doingthework #BHM #blackballerinas #doyouknow? #blacksinclassics\n\nThe MoBBallet Roll Call is being revised and expanded!⁠ In 2015 the Roll Call began as a crowd sourced database of the names of professional Black ballet dancers.
