        "text": "While Naked Raygun might be Chicago's most beloved punk band, Screeching Weasel (formely known as All Night Garage Sale) is arguably the most well-known on a national level. Since 1986, the band has issued a slew of LPs, EPs, and compilation tracks despite frequent line-up changes, record label problems, break-ups, and controversies and animosities that seemed to follow frontman Ben Weasel. The band announced they were splitting for good in 2001 but there were some random reunion shows in 2004. In 2009, Ben announced that the band was reforming again, this time without guitarist and co-founder Jughead. At a SXSW performance in 2011, Ben Weasel punched a female audience member, after which the then current line-up quit the band (although Ben maintains he fired them after the show). Ben has since continued on with new players.\n\nMembers\n\nCurrent Line Up\n\nBen Foster aka Ben Weasel - Vocals/Guitar (1986-1989, 1991-1994, 1996-2001, 2004, 2009- )\n\nMike Kennerty - Guitar (2022- )\n\nMike Catalano aka Mike Hunchback - Guitar (2011- )\n\nZach Brandner aka Poutine - Bass (2013- )\n\nPierre Marche - Drums (2011- )\n\nFormer Members\n\nJohn Pierson aka Jughead - Guitar (1986-1989, 1991-1994, 1996-2001, 2004)\n\nDan Schafer aka Dan Vapid aka Sewercap - Bass/Guitar (1989, 1991-1994, 1996-1997, 2004, 2009-2011)\n\nDan Sullivan aka Dan Panic - Drums (1991-1994, 1996-1997)\n\nMass Giorgini - Bass (1998-2001, 2004)\n\nDan Lumley - Drums (1998-2001, 2004)\n\nSteve Dubick aka Steve Cheese - Drums (1986-1988) (R.I.P. 2021)\n\nVince Vogel aka Vinnie Bovine - Bass (1986-1988)\n\nBrian McQuaid aka Brian Vermin - Drums (1988-1989)\n\nPhilip Hill - Guitar (2000-2001)\n\nWarren Fischer aka Fish - Bass (1988-1989)\n\nJohn Stockfisch aka Johnny Personality - Bass (1992)\n\nDave Lally aka Dave Naked - Bass (1991-1992)\n\nScott Conway aka Gub - Bass (1992)\n\nDouglas Ward aka Doug ID Under aka Doug Wonderful - Guitar (1989)\n\nMike Dirnt - Bass (1994)\n\nSimon Lamb - Guitar (2009-2010)\n\nJustin Perkins - Bass (2009-2011)\n\nAdam Cargin - Drums (2009-2011)\n\nDrew Fredrichsen - Guitar (2010-2011)\n\nDave Klein - Bass (2011-2013)\n\nZac Damon - Guitar (1998-1999, 2011-2017)\n\nTrevor Jackson - Guitar (2017-2021 )\n\nDiscography\n\n27 song demo tape (1986)\n\nScreeching Weasel LP (Underdog Records 1987)\n\nLicensed to Shikagu Trading/What Goes On? in 1987, who issued it in England.\n\nReissued on CD by VML Records in 1997 with 12 bonus tracks.\n\nIf You Can't Have Fun...Why Bother Living? split with The Ozzfish Experience 7\" (Weaselfish Records, 1987)\n\nThe record was never released but the covers had been printed and some were sold prior to the planned release.
