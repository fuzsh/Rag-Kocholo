        "text": "Dick S: You guys play Rebellion every year. You seem to love it.\n\nDick L: Oh yes, we do love it. We play every year. The best thing about Rebellion is meeting the people you haven’t seen in a year. It's like a big family gathering. The best thing about Rebellion is the socialization. For a lot of people, it’s not about seeing this band or that band, no, because you can plan it all you want but you’ll get caught up in a conversation and before you know it you’ve missed that band. I mean for me, it is socialization and meeting people, meeting new people that you would otherwise never meet. They travel across the planet to get there, you know.\n\nDick S.: Do you know how many times you have played REBELLION?\n\nDick L.: Nope! laughs That's another fact I should carry around for times like this. At least ten, maybe fifteen times, probably closer to fifteen.\n\nDick S.: Is it always all three bands?\n\nDick L.: It was, but it is not this year. Oddly, they didn’t want Citizen Fish or Culture Shock this year, just the SUBHUMANS. Which was like, what? It has been a three-band thing for ten or fifteen years, or whatever it is.\n\nDick S.: Oh, that is surprising. You guys are so popular, especially Citizen Fish. That was one of my favorite sets last year.\n\nDick L.: It’s a shame with Citizen Fish because we are not doing many gigs at the moment. With the six of us all doing different things, coming together at Rebellion for that one show and playing five or six shows a year is vital. It is refreshing and good to see that the people are still there, as we do get a good crowd.\n\nDick S.: Yeah, you do. Club Casbah seemed full to me last year. That is too bad because I love Citizen Fish. Maybe they will bring you back next year.\n\nDick L.: Well, we shall see, I do hope so.\n\nDick S. will you come back to the US after Rebellion?\n\nDick L.: Oh yes, we will be here. You have to do something every 30 days to keep your work permit valid. If you can’t work that out, you have to reapply each time. Oddly enough, NOFX is doing their last tour with a series of outdoor festival-style shows, and we are doing one in Toronto in mid-August. We have a couple of shows in Pittsburgh and Buffalo before that, and in September, we’re doing a show with NOFX somewhere in LA. We also have some shows near San Francisco."
