        "text": "In a 1992 referendum, Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) and Croats voted overwhelmingly for secession from Yugoslavia, while Serbs predominantly boycotted the vote, based on calls from their political representatives, who preferred to remain attached to a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. After the vote, BiH declared its independence and received international recognition. Almost immediately, fighting broke out, resulting in The Bosnian War, one of the deadliest conflicts in Europe since the Second World War. The grievances related to war atrocities -- the Srebrenica Massacre (ruled a genocide) in particular -- continue to shape the country’s politics. The U.S.-brokered Dayton Peace Agreement (DPA) in 1995 put an end to the war and enshrined Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs as the country’s three constituent peoples. It created a tripartite presidency, it introduced a new administrative organization of two entities (the Federation of BiH, populated largely by Bosniaks and Croats, and the Serb-majority Republika Srpska), and it created what some call the world’s most complicated system of government. Dayton also created the Office of the High Representative, which empowers a diplomat from the international community to take binding decisions for BiH in situations of political gridlock. In general, the Republika Srpska opposes moves in the direction of accession to the EU. Over the years, it has favoured close ties with neighbouring Serbia and with Russia. Bosniaks have advocated for a more centralized state, while Croats have repeatedly called for their own administrative unit. Croats are a significantly smaller part of the population than the other two ethnic groups. Finally, constitutional discrimination against ethnic minorities of non-constituent peoples remain a challenge.\n\nWith regards to gender equality, GSoD Indices data show that BiH has performed at the mid-range for the past few decades. Legislation, policies and institutional mechanisms on gender equality and anti-discrimination are in place, yet implementation of policies is uneven. Discrimination at work, threats against women and LGBTQIA+ activists, gender-based violence and impediments to equal political participation persist."
