        "text": "SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Oct. 2 — Bosnia’s ethnic divisions seem most likely to become even more firmly entrenched, as partial results of national elections on Monday showed two parties with diametrically opposing views in the lead. The results could delay a move by the international authorities to end their oversight of the country.\n\nAfter a campaign dominated by nationalist grandstanding, parties led by Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Muslim who was prime minister during the war fought from 1992 to 1995, and Milorad Dodik, the most prominent Bosnian Serb politician, were expected to dominate the country’s main institutions. Complete results in the voting for the country’s complex governing system were not expected until the end of the week.\n\nDuring the election campaign, both men were criticized for increasing ethnic tensions as they outlined conflicting views of Bosnia’s future.\n\nEach man advocates a tough version of the policies generally supported by his ethnic group. Bosnian Muslims, the country’s largest group, with some support from their Roman Catholic Croat allies, seek a more unified country. They want to carry out political and economic changes that will enable Bosnia to join the European Union.\n\nBut many Serbs still want the half of the country that they dominate to become independent.\n\nVoters on Sunday were selecting members of Bosnia’s three-member presidency, which includes one member from each of the three main ethnic groups, as well as members of a national Parliament and those of two substates — the Muslim-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serb Republic.\n\nRepresentatives were also being selected for the federation’s 10 cantons, which provide local health, education and police services. The complex layers of government were devised under the Dayton peace agreement, which helped bring an end to the war.\n\nMr. Silajdzic, of the Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina, won the Muslim presidency. Nebojsa Radmanovic, a member of Mr. Dodik’s Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, won the Bosnian Serb seat. The competition between the main Bosnian Croat candidates was too close to call, with just 50 percent of votes counted by Monday afternoon. Mr. Silajdzic’s and Mr. Dodik’s parties were likely to hold the largest number of seats in the national Parliament.\n\nInternational officials here worry that the strongly differing stances will set back progress on political changes to ease a transfer of power from foreign officials to local politicians.\n\nDuring the campaign, Mr. Silajdzic advocated the replacement of Bosnia’s ethnically divided structures with a single centralized state. Mr. Dodik countered by saying any attempt to carry out such a plan would lead the Bosnian Serbs to hold a referendum on independence. Diplomats fear that such a development would ignite violence.\n\nMore than a decade after the end of the war that claimed about 100,000 lives from all sides, international officials still have a significant influence over the country’s government.\n\nBosnia’s most senior international official, the high representative — currently Christian Schwarz-Schilling of Germany — has the right to dismiss politicians and impose laws. In February, the mainly Western governments that oversee the high representative’s office will review whether it should be closed by mid-2007 or extended. The European Union still has 6,000 peacekeepers in the country.\n\nMr. Silajdzic said Monday that he was determined to start work on creating a new Bosnia, in which institutions and politics were no longer based on ethnicity. “We have to transfer ourselves from a country based on ethnic rights to citizens’ rights,” he said in an interview. “What we have now is the result of genocide and a war of aggression, and it should be changed.”\n\nMr. Dodik said the support for his party confirmed that Bosnian Serbs favor the federal structure, and he repeated warnings that “in the case that demands for abolishing the Serb Republic are repeated, demands for referendum will be raised again.”\n\nThe European Union has told Bosnia that, in order to move toward possible membership, it must reform its Constitution to simplify its political structures and create a single national police force. Talks among Bosnia’s political parties on both topics became deadlocked earlier this year."
