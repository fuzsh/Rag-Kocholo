        "text": "This entry lists the basic form of government for each country. Definitions of the governmental terms are as follows (note that for some countries more than one definition applies):\n\nabsolute monarchy - a form of government where the monarch rules unhindered by laws, constitution, or legally organized opposition.\n\nanarchy - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought about by the absence of governmental authority.\n\nauthoritarian - a form of government in which state authority is imposed onto many aspects of citizens' lives.\n\ncommonwealth - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on law and united by a compact of the people for the common good.\n\ncommunist - a system of government in which the state plans and controls the economy and a single -- often authoritarian -- party holds power; the state imposes controls and eliminates private ownership of property or capital, while claiming to make progress toward a higher social order in which people equally share all goods in a classless society.\n\nconfederacy (confederation) - a union by compact or treaty between states, provinces, or territories that creates a central government with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme authority, except in matters delegated to the central government.\n\nconstitutional - a government operating under an authoritative document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental laws and principles that determine the nature, functions, and limits of that government.\n\nconstitutional democracy - a form of government in which the sovereign power of the people is spelled out in a governing constitution.\n\nconstitutional monarchy - a system of government in which a monarch is guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom.\n\ndemocracy - a form of government in which the supreme power is retained by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly through a system of representation and delegated authority periodically renewed.\n\ndemocratic republic - a state in which the supreme power rests in the body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them.\n\ndictatorship - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws).\n\necclesiastical - a government administrated by a church.\n\nemirate - similar to a monarchy or sultanate, but a government in which the supreme power is in the hands of an emir (the ruler of a Muslim state); the emir may be an absolute overlord or a sovereign with constitutionally limited authority.\n\nfederal (federation) - a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided -- usually by means of a constitution -- between a central authority and a number of constituent regions (states, colonies, or provinces), so that each region retains some management of its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that the central government exerts influence directly on both individuals and the regional units.\n\nfederal republic - a state in which the powers of the central government are restricted and in which the component parts (states, colonies, or provinces) retain a degree of self-government; ultimate sovereign power rests with the voters who chose their governmental representatives.\n\nIslamic republic - a particular form of government adopted by some Muslim states; although such a state is, in theory, a theocracy, it remains a republic, but its laws are required to be compatible with the laws of Islam.\n\nMaoism - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in China by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous revolution is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to keep in touch with the people.\n\nMarxism - the political, economic, and social principles espoused by 19th century economist Karl Marx; he viewed history as a progression from a class struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists (business owners), to a socialist \"dictatorship of the proletariat,\" and finally to a classless society (communism).\n\nMarxism-Leninism - an expanded form of communism developed by Vladimir Lenin from Karl Marx's doctrines; Lenin saw imperialism as the final stage of capitalism and shifted the focus of the workers' struggle from developed to underdeveloped countries.\n\nmonarchy - a government in which the supreme power is in the hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually for life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole absolute ruler or a sovereign -- such as a king, queen, or prince -- with constitutionally limited authority.\n\noligarchy - a government in which a small group of individuals exercises control.\n\nparliamentary democracy - a political system in which the party with the most votes in the legislature (parliament) selects the government -- a prime minister, premier, or chancellor and the cabinet ministers; by this system, the government has a responsibility to the people as well as to the parliament.\n\nparliamentary government (cabinet-parliamentary government) - a government in which a legislature or parliament nominates members of an executive branch (the cabinet and its leader -- a prime minister, premier, or chancellor); this type of government can be dissolved at will by the parliament (legislature) through a no-confidence vote, or the leader of the cabinet may dissolve the parliament if it can no longer function.\n\nparliamentary monarchy - a state headed by a monarch who is not actively involved in policy formation or implementation and may have only a ceremonial capacity; governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its head -- a prime minister, premier, or chancellor -- who are drawn from a legislature (parliament).\n\npresidential - a system of government where the executive branch exists separately from a legislature (to which it is generally not accountable).\n\nrepublic - a representative democracy in which the people's elected deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on legislation.\n\nsocialism - a government in which the means of planning, producing, and distributing goods is controlled by a central government that theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of property and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have ended up being no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling elite.\n\nsultanate - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim state); the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with constitutionally limited authority.\n\ntheocracy - a form of government in which a deity is recognized as the supreme civil ruler, but ecclesiastical authorities interpret (bishops, mullahs, etc.) the deity's laws; a government subject to religious authority.\n\ntotalitarian - a government that seeks to subordinate the individual to the state by controlling not only all political and economic matters, but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its population."
