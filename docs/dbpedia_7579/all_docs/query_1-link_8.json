        "text": "The 1995 Dayton Accords that ended the war in BiH reorganized the state as including two autonomous entities—the Federation of BiH, whose residents are mainly Bosniak and Croat, and the Serb-dominated Republika Srpska (RS)—that operate under a weak central government. The position of head of state is held by a three-member presidency comprising one Bosniak, one Serb, and one Croat; they are each elected to a four-year term, which they serve concurrently.\n\nThe chair of the Council of Ministers, or prime minister, is nominated by the presidency and approved by the House of Representatives.\n\nIn October 2022, BiH held general elections. Denis Bećirović of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) defeated longtime Bosniak nationalist chief Bakir Izetbegović of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) for the Bosniak seat on the state presidency. Željko Komšić, leader of the multiethnic Democratic Front (DF), defeated Borjana Krišto of the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ BiH) for the Croat seat. The secessionist Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) from the Serb-dominated RS entity won the Serb seat on the state presidency. An observer mission from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) noted irregularities but called the elections competitive. It further noted that “increasing segmentation along ethnic lines and the corresponding divergent views on the future of the country remain a concern for the functioning of democratic institutions.”\n\nFollowing the elections, the state-level presidency and government were formed relatively quickly—although both institutions are largely dysfunctional, owing to obstructionist activities by Serb secessionist parties. Government formation in the RS entity also proceeded quickly, despite a recount in the entity’s presidency election.\n\nHowever, the government formation process in the Federation entity ground to a halt when it became clear that the new Troika coalition—made up of the SDP, the People and Justice party (NiP), and Our Party (NS)—and the HDZ BiH lacked sufficient votes in the entity’s upper chamber, the House of Peoples, to seat a new prime minister. Unwilling to make a deal with the SDA or DF, the Troika urged the High Representative, Christian Schmidt, to change government formation rules. Schmidt did so in April 2023, using the executive Bonn powers to amend the constitution so that only two of three Federation presidency members were needed to support a proposed government. The House of Representatives appointed a government the following day. (The previous Federation government had been operating in a caretaker capacity for its entire mandate because the HDZ BiH had blocked government formation in an effort to secure certain electoral reforms.)\n\nA government was formed in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton in November. At year’s end, a government had yet to be formed in Canton 10 (Livno), because here too the Troika and HDZ BiH lacked votes and coalition partners.\n\nThe Central Election Commission (CIK) administers elections with the help of municipal election commissions. Both are subject to significant political party interference. The CIK is a largely ineffectual body, unable to act decisively without political support.\n\nConflicts over fair ethnic representation surround aspects of the constitution and electoral laws. BiH citizens who do not identify as members of the country’s Bosniak, Serb, or Croat “constitutive peoples” remain barred from the presidency and membership in the House of Peoples.\n\nIn late August 2023, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) issued its sixth and most sweeping ruling since 2009 that Bosnia’s constitution and electoral laws violate the European Convention on Human Rights. The court struck down large segments of BiH’s state constitution on grounds that territorial and ethnic restrictions governing whom citizens can vote for were discriminatory. The case was brought by Slaven Kovačević, an advisor to President Željko Komšić, who pointed out that he was constitutionally barred from taking part in the vote for Serb members of the presidency, and argued that the country’s existing political system operated not as a parliamentary democracy of equal citizens but a sectarian “ethnocracy.” The court agreed, saying that Bosnian nationals who belong to minority groups or reject ethnic nationalism are “akin to second-class citizens.”\n\nPolitical parties typically organize and operate freely, though the political arena in the Federation is generally limited to Bosniaks and Croats, while Serbs control politics in the RS. Coalitions at all levels of government shift frequently, but incumbent parties have tended to maintain their positions with the help of vast patronage networks, making it difficult for smaller reform-oriented groupings to achieve meaningful gains. Election law amendments made by the Office of the High Representative (OHR) in 2022 significantly strengthened the position of the HDZ BiH in the Federation House of Peoples.\n\nThe ECtHR’s August 2023 Kovačević ruling suggested that BiH’s electoral and constitutional regime was fundamentally discriminatory and undemocratic and that future constitutional reforms cannot limit the right to free and equal participation in the democratic process in order to protect ethnic-group rights, formally, the rights of the “constituent peoples.” However, there is little to suggest that either the Kovačević ruling or any of the other outstanding ECtHR civil rights rulings against BiH will be implemented in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn addition to domestic problems like the politicization of public resources and the influence of corrupt patronage networks, the governments of Serbia and Croatia exert leverage in Bosnian politics through their respective local allies, the SNSD and the HDZ BiH. The Russian and Turkish governments have also offered support to preferred parties and candidates.\n\nBiH’s Office of the High Representative (OHR) is an ad hoc international institution mandated with overseeing implementation of civilian aspects of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Between October 2022 and April 2023, High Representative Christian Schmidt amended the constitution and electoral code twice in order to unblock government formation. There are credible reports that the government of Croatia intensively lobbied Schmidt, especially with respect to the first intervention in 2022; Croatian officials have also publicly boasted of their regular but “discreet” communications with Schmidt. In July 2022, local media reported that the Croatian foreign minister had helped directly prepare the OHR’s election law amendments. The scale and frequency of Croatia’s interference in BiH’s domestic politics also saw Slovenia’s president-elect, Nataša Pirc Musar, critique Zagreb’s posture in late 2022, saying Croatian officials were “a little too involved” in BiH. In September 2023, after Komšić criticized Croatia and Serbia for interfering in BiH’s domestic politics, the Croatian foreign minister referred to him as a “pest” and a “parasite.”\n\nScore Change: The score declined from 2 to 1 due to the OHR’s renewed intervention in government formation processes, as well as signs of political interference in OHR decision-making by the government of Croatia.\n\nPolitical rights in BiH are in large part contingent on one’s ethnic background and place of residence. Jews and Roma are constitutionally barred from the presidency and from membership in the House of Peoples, despite ECtHR rulings against those provisions. Serbs who live in the Federation and Croats and Bosniaks who live in the RS are also excluded from the presidency. Some Croats argue that their rights to representation are violated by electoral laws allowing non-Croats a significant voice in the selection of the Croat member of the presidency and Croat members of the House of Peoples. Critics of the Croat nationalist HDZ BiH, however, counter that the party has manipulated the discourse surrounding this issue to obstruct civic and liberal reforms of the country’s constitutional order.\n\nWomen are underrepresented in politics and government. As a result, debates pertaining to maternal health and domestic violence are rarely at the center of parliamentary discussion, although they are openly, if infrequently, discussed in the media. LGBT+ people are marginalized in formal political life, but LGBT+ rights groups are active in the civic sphere. Sarajevo continued to host a Pride march in 2023, with little substantive public opposition.\n\nGovernment formation and policy implementation are seriously impeded by the country’s complex system of ethnic representation. Under the Dayton Accords, representatives from each of the three major ethnic groups, at both the state and entity levels, may exercise a veto on legislation deemed harmful to their interests. The state government is also undercut by movements within each of BiH’s entities for greater autonomy.\n\nMilorad Dodik, the RS president, maintains expansive control over the entity, and continues to speak openly of his desire for the RS to secede from BiH. In October 2021, he announced the RS’s withdrawal from various federal institutions, notably the military, prompting fears of a secession crisis. The move came largely in response to the OHR’s July 2021 law against genocide denial and was the latest in a series of escalating efforts to chip away at the functionality of the BiH state. Dodik has continued to engage in secessionist rhetoric, including periodic blockades of the inter-entity boundary line. His actions have prompted denunciations and rounds of sanctions against him and his associates by the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nFreedom of expression is legally guaranteed but limited in practice. Journalists face political pressure as well as harassment, threats, and occasional assaults in the course of their work. There is a large private media sector, including outlets that are affiliated with local political parties and those that belong to major international news networks. Public broadcasters in both entities, and at the canton level, often operate as partisan platforms; this is especially pronounced with the entity broadcaster in the RS, Radio-Television Republika Srpska (RTRS), whose coverage serves the interests of the SNSD.\n\nOn a number of occasions during 2022, High Representative Schmidt reacted aggressively to pointed questions by journalists.\n\nIn 2023, the RS entity government passed a law criminalizing defamation, and Dodik signed it in August. The move drew widespread condemnation as incompatible with international human rights standards, and warnings that it could be used to stifle free speech and criticism of the Dodik regime both in the RS and across BiH.\n\nThe judiciary is formally independent but weak in practice. Dozens of Constitutional Court decisions have been disregarded by political leaders, as has some jurisprudence from the ECtHR. Individual judges are also subject to political pressure, interference, and intimidation regarding the cases before them. The High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HJPC), which appoints judges, has been racked by scandals and is widely perceived as corrupt.\n\nThe existence of four separate court systems—for BiH, the RS, the Federation, and the self-governing Brčko District—contributes to overall inefficiency.\n\nSuccessive rounds of US sanctions in 2022 targeted, among other things, criminal elements within the Bosnian prosecutor’s chamber and individuals involved in the refusal of the Croat nationalist HDZ BiH to appoint judges to the Federation’s Constitutional Court.\n\nIn March 2023, the Constitutional Court upheld the High Representative’s constitutional and election law changes made in October 2022, but the decision only passed narrowly on account of the chief justice, an HDZ BiH appointee, being allowed to vote twice to break a deadlock on the bench and after the court had failed to reach a decision. The decision was criticized among much of the public and in media as overtly partisan.\n\nIn June 2023, secessionist authorities in the RS entity passed a law through which they claimed to have withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court. The High Representative in July invalidated the law but it was nevertheless published in the entity’s public gazette.\n\nAlthough overall violent crime rates are low, organized crime is a significant problem, and high-profile incidents in recent years have fueled public frustration with the police and judicial system. Members of vulnerable groups are subject to harassment by police, including migrants transiting through the country. Many prisons are overcrowded or feature other substandard conditions, and detainees face physical abuse by prison authorities. Active land mines dating to the 1990s continue to pose a threat to civilians in rural parts of the country.\n\nIn 2023, there was a sharp uptick in the number of attacks against Bosniak returnees in the RS entity. This prompted an emergency session of the state parliament in September at which lawmakers passed a measure condemning the violence. However, local police have been criticized for failing to respond to the attacks, and no meaningful steps were taken to provide additional protection to the Bosniak community in northern and eastern BiH.\n\nLaws guaranteeing equal treatment are unevenly upheld. Discrimination against members of the Romany minority is widespread. People who returned to their homes after being displaced during the war face discrimination in employment and housing in regions where their ethnic group constitutes a minority. Bosniak returnees in the RS face notable discrimination and harassment; Bosniaks and Croats in the RS more generally experience difficulties in accessing social services. Women are legally entitled to full equality with men but encounter discrimination in the workplace in practice. Members of the LGBT+ community face discrimination, harassment, and occasional physical attacks, and authorities often fail to adequately investigate and prosecute crimes against LGBT+ people.\n\nTens of thousands of migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers have arrived in the country since 2018. The vast majority travel on to other locations, but thousands remain stranded in BiH. Authorities in the RS have refused to allow any migrant centers, and the burden of care has been thrust almost entirely on a handful of municipalities in the country’s northwest. Treatment of migrants has improved in recent years due to EU funds provided to set up shelters and camps. However, the EU has also been criticized for attempting to effectively refuse entry and keep migrants and refugees in BiH and the region."
