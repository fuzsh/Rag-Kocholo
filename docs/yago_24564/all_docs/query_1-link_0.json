        "text": "Burt Reynolds says his breakup with Judy Carne kept him a bachelor for decades and he once nearly died from addiction to Halcion, a controversial prescription sleeping pill.\n\nThe actor also talks about his relationships with Dinah Shore, Sally Field and Loni Anderson in the April 25-May 1 issue of TV Guide magazine.\n\nReynolds, who won an Emmy award last year for his performance in the TV show Evening Shade, said he met Carne while doing a promotional tour for Gunsmoke.\n\n\"She was so adorable, such a pixie,\" he said. \"And she was absolutely not immoral, but amoral, bawdy funny. She was wild, she danced on table tops. And I was such a Southern boy, I wanted to turn her into Mrs. June Cleaver.\"\n\nWhen their marriage broke up, Reynolds said, \"I lost all interest in women, I just couldn't go out with anyone . . . She broke my heart, she really did.\"\n\nReynolds didn't remarry for decades, but did have a long relationship with Shore, whom he met on her talk show.\n\nHe met Anderson on The Merv Griffin Show in 1978. A year and a half later, he first asked her for a date. They eventually married.\n\nReynolds said he was addicted to Halcion more than four years after he hurt his jaw while making the 1984 film City Heat. His pain was so intense that he took as many as 50 pills a day. He went into a coma and nearly died when he tried to quit cold turkey, he said."
