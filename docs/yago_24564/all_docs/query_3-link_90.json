        "text": "Actress Judy Carne, best known for being the \"Sock it to me!\" girl on \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\" in the '60s, died on Sept. 3, according to the Telegraph. She was 76.\n\nCarne rose to overnight fame with her appearances on \"Laugh-In,\" where the bouncy actress' zany persona would be doused with water every time she uttered the phrase \"Sock it to me,\" accidentally or not. She acted on the sketch comedy show for two years, making the occasional appearance in the third season.\n\nCarne was also known for her tumultuous relationship with Burt Reynolds. She was the actor's first wife, marrying him in 1963 before they divorced in 1965. She detailed their relationship, confessing to partaking in several affairs and struggling with drug addiction, in her 1985 autobiography \"Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside: The Bittersweet Saga of the Sock-It-To-Me Girl.\"\n\nShe battled heavily with drug addiction after leaving \"Laugh-In,\" being charged with heroin possession and prescription forgery in the late '70s. She was acquitted of the heroin charge.\n\nThe actress was born near Northampton, Northamptonshire, England, and trained at the Bush Davies Theatrical School for Girls at East Grinstead as a child. Her first television appearance came in 1956, in \"The First Day of Spring.\"\n\nCarne went on to serve as a panelist on \"Juke Box Jury\" and also appeared on sitcom \"The Rag Trade,\" as well as the 1962 comedy film \"A Pair of Briefs.\"\n\nHer other TV credits include a regular role in sitcom \"Fair Exchange,\" \"The Baileys of Balboa,\" a starring role in sitcom \"Love on a Rooftop\" and appearances in \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\"\n\n© 2015 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC"
