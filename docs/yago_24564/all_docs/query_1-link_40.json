        "text": "British television actress Judy Carne - best known as the 'Sock It To Me' girl on hit 1960s show Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In - has died aged 76.\n\nShe found overnight fame on the sketch comedy series, and spent two years being doused with water every time she said the phrase \"Sock it to me!\".\n\nCarne was also known for her tumultuous relationship with actor Burt Reynolds, to whom she was married from 1963-65.\n\nThe Northampton-born actress died on 3 September, reported The Telegraph, external.\n\nCarne's other TV credits included appearances in The Man from Uncle, Juke Box Jury, sitcoms The Rag Trade and Fair Exchange, and the 1962 comedy film A Pair of Briefs.\n\nThe actress detailed her relationship with Reynolds in her 1985 autobiography Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside: The Bittersweet Saga of the Sock-It-To-Me Girl.\n\nIn the book she confessed to several affairs and also described her long struggle with drug addiction.\n\nWhen she and Reynolds met she said they \"were immediately in love, so we immediately made love\", but they divorced in 1966, with Carne claiming the actor had become abusive.\n\nThe actress - who was born Joyce Audrey Botterill on 27 April 1939 - was brought up in Kingsthorpe, Northamptonshire, where her parents ran a greengrocer's shop.\n\nShe was a popular figure during her time on Laugh-In, but quit the show in the middle of the third series - around the same time Goldie Hawn emerged as the show's female star - complaining that it had become \"a bore\"."
