        "text": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Carne\n\nJoyce Audrey Botterill (27 April 1939 – 3 September 2015), known professionally as Judy Carne, was an English actress best remembered for the phrase \"Sock it to me!\" on Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In.\n\nCareer\n\nCarne was born in Northampton, England, the daughter of a couple who ran a greengrocer's in Kingsthorpe.[1] She made her first British television appearances on the series Danger Man (1961) and episodes of The Rag Trade (also 1961), a BBC sitcom. She moved to the US not long afterwards.[citation needed]\n\nHer first regular role was in the CBS-TV sitcom Fair Exchange (1963), in which she played an English teenager who goes to the U.S. to live with an American family whose daughter (played by Lynn Loring) has gone to live in England. That was followed by The Baileys of Balboa (1964), also CBS and then she co-starred with Pete Duel in Love on a Rooftop on ABC (1966). She made appearances in the TV show The Man from U.N.C.L.E..\n\nShe had a small part in the ninth episode of the TV series Gidget (1965), guest-starred as Floy in second season episode 3, \"Then Came The Mighty Hunter\" of 12 O'Clock High (1965), and appeared in an episode of I Dream of Jeannie (1966). She appeared in the Bonanza episode \"A Question of Strength\" (1963) as Sister Mary Kathleen, two episodes of The Big Valley (1967), and the TV adaptation of QB VII (1974). Her film roles included A Pair of Briefs (1962), The Americanization of Emily (1964), the wife of Tom Bell in All the Right Noises (1971), and Rachel Amodeo's street movie What About Me (1993), opposite Richard Hell and Johnny Thunders.\n\nOn Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (1968–1970) Carne gained stardom. Her most popular routine ended with her saying \"Sock it to me!\", at which point she was doused with water or assaulted in some other way. Carne was on the series for the first two seasons (1968–69), but made occasional appearances during the 1969-70 season. At the time she left, Carne complained the show had become \"a big, bloody bore\".\n\nPersonal life\n\nCarne was married to actor Burt Reynolds from 1963 to 1965, and producer Robert Bergmann from 1970 to 1971.\n\nHer 1985 autobiography, Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside: The Bittersweet Saga of the Sock-It-To-Me Girl, chronicled her difficulties with drugs, her failed marriage to Reynolds, and her bisexuality.\n\nFilmography"
