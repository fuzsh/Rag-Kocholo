Her school instructor told her that Joyce was not a good professional name, so she changed it. Judy had small roles in a number of films and TV shows but she gained famed on “Laugh-In.” She told me about a body part she showed that was a no-no at the time and listen closely for a line that was in a script that got by the censors, but got a lot of flak from viewers. She also reveals the inside scoop about her failed marriage to actor Burt Reynolds.\n\nMore Exhibits"
