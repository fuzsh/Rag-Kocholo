        "text": "Burt Reynolds has passed away at the age of 82.\n\nThe American actor starred in many huge movies of the 1970s and beyond, including Smokey and the Bandit and Deliverance.\n\nUs Weekly reports that he passed away in a Florida hospital of a heart attack, and was with his family.\n\nKnown for his iconic moustache and as a leading man in many successful films, he had previously undergone heart bypass surgery in 2010.\n\nHe is survived by his son, Quinton.\n\nThe actor's agent, Todd Eisner, told NBC News that his death was \"heartbreaking\".\n\nBurt Reynolds' breakout hit was as Lewis Medlock in the 1972 horror-drama Deliverance, and he went on to appear in The Longest Yard, Smokey and the Bandit, Semi-Tough, Hooper, The Cannonball Run and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\n\nHe had a big comeback in 1997, earning an Oscar nomination for his performance in Boogie Nights.\n\nReynolds was married to Judy Carne from 1963 to 1965, and to Loni Anderson from 1988 to 1993. He and Anderson adopted a son, Quinton.\n\nHe also had relationships with Dinah Shore and actress Sally Field."
