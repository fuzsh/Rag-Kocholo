        "text": "Two years ago, Burt Reynolds exclusively revealed to Closer Weekly that he still loves his ex-girlfriend Sally Field, leaving many fans wondering one thing: was the actress ever his wife? Turns out, they never tied the knot, even though we think they would have made the perfect married couple.\n\nIn a previous interview, Sally opened up about their relationship today and revealed they “don’t really talk” anymore, which is sad because it appears Burt is in ill health. “We don’t really talk to each other, no,” the 70-year-old actress once told People. When subsequently asked about her former flame’s recent (and frequent) declarations that she is “the one that got away,” Sally quipped, “Well, yeah.”\n\nFollowing the demise of her first marriage to Steve Craig, Sally dated Burt, 81, for five years beginning in the late 1970s. During that time, the pair co-starred in four movies: Smokey and the Bandit, Smokey and the Bandit II, The End, and Hooper. They later split in 1982. Burt was married to Judy Carne from 1963 until 1965 and to Loni Anderson from 1988 until 1994.\n\nBurt has admitted he regrets their breakup. “I don’t know why I was so stupid. Men are like that, you know. You find the perfect person, and then you do everything you can to screw it up,” he said. He also shared that she almost wasn’t his leading lady in Smokey and the Bandit! “I was told she was not sexy — she was the Flying Nun,” Burt recalled exclusively to Closer. “I told them, ‘Trust me, talent is sexy. She is talented and sexy.'”\n\n“I still love [Sally] very much,” Burt told Closer in October 2015. “I wish I could stay in touch with [her], but I live in Florida.” Sally then confessed she had “no response” to Burt’s proclamations. “Any response I would have would belong to him,” she said. Maybe they will rekindle now that they’re both single…"
