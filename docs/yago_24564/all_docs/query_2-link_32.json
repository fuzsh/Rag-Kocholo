        "text": "Judy Carne was a British actress best known for her regular appearances on Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In, where she popularized the catch-phrase “Sock it to me.\" She was also briefly married to actor Burt Reynolds.\n\nCarne got her start on the U.K. television series Danger Man and The Rag Trade, but made her move to American television in the mid-1960s. She appeared on the series Bonanza, Dr. Kildare, Gunsmoke, I Dream of Jeannie, The Patty Duke Show, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and Ironside.\n\nShe also appeared in several films: A Pair of Briefs, What About Me and The Americanization of Emily, starring James Garner and Julie Andrews.\n\nHer biggest role, however, came on the sketch-comedy program Laugh-In, hosted by Dan Rowan and Dick Martin, which ran from 1968 to ’73. She was featured in a recurring routine where she would deliver her famous saying, “Sock it to me,” before being doused with water. After performing regularly in the first two seasons, she returned occasionally thereafter, resulting in 45 credited appearances.\n\nJudy Carne was a British actress best known for her regular appearances on Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In, where she popularized the catch-phrase “Sock it to me.\" She was also briefly married to actor Burt Reynolds.\n\nCarne got her start on the U.K. television series Danger Man and The Rag Trade, but made her move to American television in the mid-1960s.
