        "text": "The late Hollywood legend Burt Reynolds, who died on September 6 2018 in Florida, spoke to the Mirror back in December 2015.\n\nThis is what had to say as he looked back on his life then:\n\nWith his wry grin, thick moustache­ and thicker chest rug, Burt Reynolds was one of the biggest sex symbols of the 1970s. And, boy, did he take­­ advantage­ of it.\n\nBy his own admission the Smokey and the Bandit star, who was one of the decade’s highest paid actors, hopped from bed to bed, dating beauties from Farrah Fawcett to Goldie Hawn.\n\nBut the medallion man image quickly went out of fashion and just as the serial womaniser was rumoured to be have Aids, his career nosedived.\n\nLooking back as he released his autobiography­, But Enough About Me, an older, wiser Burt saw why so many people leapt to the wrong conclusion.\n\n“I was surprised a lot of women didn’t say, ‘Have you been tested, because you should be?’” he said.\n\n“I jumped from one to the other and I certainly could have handled those situations­ better.\n\n“I was an a**hole. When all the Aids stuff came out you’re going to get swallowed­ up by everything.\n\n“I made some stupid mistakes” he said. “And I haven’t been the nicest guy in the world about keeping my mouth shut about women.”\n\nBurt lamented his days as a boastful stud, which is why he judged Charlie Sheen so harshly after he revealed he’s HIV positive.\n\nHe even said the Two And A Half Men star “deserved” to get the virus .\n\n“I don’t have any pity for the boy. He’s been in trouble a lot and seems to revel in the women he’s bedded, I didn’t like that at all,” said Burt.\n\n\"How can you feel good about yourself when you’ve got yourself into this mess?\n\n“My heart goes out to his father, Martin Sheen, whom I love very much. He’s a dear friend. We worked together – he’s a terrific actor and a terrific guy. This must be just tearing him apart.”\n\nBurt knew how HIV and Aids brought the glare of publicity, even when, in his case, he hadn’t contracted the virus.\n\nAfter breaking his jaw while performing a stunt in the early 1980s, he developed a painful joint problem which meant he couldn’t eat.\n\nHe lost a lot of weight and, as a result of the rumours, lost a lot of friends, though celebs like Elizabeth Taylor and Clint Eastwood stood by him.\n\n“A lot of those friends who turned their backs were a pain in the a** too,” he said. “I also knew some people who had Aids and I had a whole different kind of respect for them after what happened. I tried all I could to help them.”\n\nLong before Burt earned his womanising­ reputation, he was a Hollywood wannabe and much more cautious with the ladies .\n\nBorn in Michigan, he spent his teenage years in Florida, before moving to New York in the 1950s to make a name for himself in theatre before quickly getting signed by the Hollywood studios.\n\nOnce there he struck up a fleeting friendship­ with Marilyn Monroe, already a huge star. “I used to walk with her to the studio,” he recalled. “I was a young kid – she was free and open and beautiful to me.”\n\nDid he make a move on one of the greatest ever sex symbols?\n\n“In a New York minute I would have, but I was scared to death. I didn’t want to be rejected – and I’m sure she was an expert at that,” he says.\n\nHe’d hoped to be an American footballer­, winning a scholarship to college because of his talent, but injury ended that dream.\n\nStill he was a hunky young sportsman and an object of desire to a few stars, including Greta Garbo.\n\nHe met the movie legend at a party but didn’t recognise her and blew his chances.\n\n“She was stunning and asked me if I wanted to walk her home,” he says.\n\n“She wore a yellow silk blouse, no bra. I was blown away. I kept staring at her breasts.\n\n\"We came to this little diner and – it’s frightening­ to think I did this – I said, ‘Would you like to go in for a burger?’” Not surprisingly, she said no and he never got a second chance.\n\nBurt’s fame slowly built through the 60s and was compared with Marlon Brando, mostly due to his looks.\n\nThis saw him grow his trademark moustache to avoid being mistaken for a man he disliked.\n\n\"He was so arrogant,” said Burt, “and he had every right to be, he was on top of the mountain. The moustache­ I thought would help. And it did.”\n\nBurt said he rejected an offer to play James Bond after Sean Connery quit.\n\nHe wed British actress Judy Carne in 1963, but they divorced two years later.\n\nBy 1972 he gained more credibility with the movie Deliverance, which many thought should have got him an Oscar nomination­. But, just before it came out, Burt believes he blew his chances by posing naked for Cosmopolitan.\n\n“The image turned up everywhere. A group of us were in a motel and somebody said, ‘Come to my room and see this!’ So I did, and there I was, an image of me naked on the sheets.”\n\nHis fame continued to soar, but film offers were always commercial­. None more so than Smokey and the Bandit.\n\nIn 1977 this simple story of two smugglers­ – one in a lorry, the other a sports car – trying to ship bootleg booze across county lines was second only to Star Wars in box office takings.\n\nThanks to two sequels, and parts in movies like The Cannonball­ Run, Burt became the top money-making­­­ film star for five years from 1978.\n\nHe also had a five-year fling with co-star Sally Field who he referred to as the love of his life.\n\nMost of the 80s was a spiral down. He wed actress Loni Anderson in 1988, a costly divorce followed five years later. His career was briefly resuscitated when he starred in 1997’s Boogie Nights.\n\nBut in recent years his health gained more attention than his acting.\n\nHe had spinal surgery in 2009, a heart op a year later and went into rehab to deal with an addiction to painkillers.\n\nFrail and in discomfort after doing many film stunts, he walked with a stick . But Burt, who had an adopted son Quinton, 28, was happy to contemplate his mortality.\n\n“I don’t fear dying,” he said. “I talk to God every night.\n\n“I just think of the luck I’ve had. I’d like my epitaph to be, ‘He had a hell of a good time and he was a good friend’.\n\n“The only thing I fear is getting sick and being a bother to people.”\n\nBut he won’t just leave behind an epitaph, there’s an unusual heirloom.\n\n“It’s beautiful­ hair but it’s not mine,” he says, gesturing to his famous wig.\n\n“When I die they’ll find this beautifully dressed man with this beautiful­ hair.\n\n“They’ll say, ‘Well, he left a note – ‘Pass this to his brother, he needs it badly.’ ”"
