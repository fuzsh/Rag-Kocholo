        "text": "Is It Love or Symbiosis?\n\nAnne and John announce they have arranged a scholarship for Gidget at a school in Paris where she can become a sophisticated young lady. John tells Russ he is so dependent on Gidget that he will probably never marry and in time will be an elderly parent with a spinster daughter. Impressed, Russ decides to send Gidget abroad. Gidget tells Larue she can't understand why. Associate Professor Jerry Rogers, a swinger with the ladies, tells Russ he will move in after Gidget leaves and that together, they can lead a dolce vita existence. Overhearing this, Gidget pretends she wants to go to Paris. Hoping to change Russ' mind, Gidget's friends dramatize the perils facing Gidget abroad. Realizing their motives, Russ decides he may be mistaken in his reasons for sending Gidget to Paris. Questioned by Russ, Gidget tells him she thought he wanted to lead his own life. She is overjoyed when her father tells her life with her has been perfect. Later Gidget reflects that Anne and John should want to keep her at home, because without a target, they'd be fighting with each other.\n\nIs There an Extra Jeannie in the House?\n\nRoger keeps Sheila, Dr. Bellows' niece, out long past her uncle's curfew. Dr. Bellows tells Roger he is assigning him to a remote island. Tony forbids Jeannie to call on a cousin from Baghdad to help Roger. Certain Roger has gone for a month, Mr. Billings, the manager of his apartment house, allows Arnie Conway, a magician, and his wife, Myrt, to use the apartment in Roger 's absence. When Roger returns and sees the Conways rehearsing a routine in oriental costume, he is sure, Jeannie has brought her relatives to help him. Then Dr. Bellows tells Roger he is not sending him away. Tony is also sure Jeannie's cousins are helping Roger. Roger, confident of his newfound power, tells Sheila he'll make her uncle head of the medical department and get her a mink coat. Although Jeannie tells Roger Myrt is not her cousin, Roger calls Bellows and tells him he'll get him the position he's been working for. Myrt and Arnie, having had enough of the kooky situation, decide to leave. They tell Tony they are not genies and he apologizes to Jeannie. Just as Bellows is telling Roger something must be done about his mental condition, Bellows receives word of his appointment. Roger's elation fades when he realizes that without the help of his departed genies, he'll have to pay for Sheila's mink coat himself.\n\nBiggest Star in Hollywood\n\nTony and Dr. Bellows leave for Hollywood on NASA business. Gary Owens and George Schlatter of Laugh In see Jeannie pop in and out of a mirror as she waves goodbye to Tony. Roger overhears them ask Jeannie to appear on their show and immediately takes over as her agent. He convinces Jeannie to go along with his plans so she can impress Tory as a Hollywood celebrity. At the hotel in Hollywood, Roger tries to keep Tony from meeting Jeannie, whom he has billed as \"Princess Anitra.\" However, a news photographer snaps them together in a corridor at midnight.. Tony convinces Bellows he was sleepwalking, but worries when Judy Carne shows him the picture. Determined to get Jeannie back to Cocoa Beach, Tony imprisons Jeannie in her bottle and tells Dr. Bellows it's shaving lotion. When Flip Wilson and Arte Johnson come to escort Jeannie to the studio, Dr. Bellows is shaving: As he opens Jeannie's bottle, she blinks and a baby skunk appears. Bellows emerges, choking. To elude him, Roger climbs out on the window ledge. Tony announces that Princess Anitra will not appear on the Laugh In, but Roger, still resolved to make it big as Jeannie's agent, grabs the bottle and declares the show will go on."
