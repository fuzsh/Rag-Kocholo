        "text": "The 911 call made before Burt Reynolds passed away describes a scene of agony as a male caller said the actor had chest pains and trouble breathing.\n\nThe call was made just after noon on Thursday from Reynolds’ Florida estate.\n\n“Is he awake right now?” the 911 operator asks.\n\n“Semi,” the caller replies. “Breathing but not answering questions.”\n\n“Has he ever had a heart attack or angina in the past?” the operator says.\n\n“He had a bypass a few years ago,” the caller responds.\n\nThe star of iconic movies like \"Deliverance\" and “Smokey and the Bandit” died at a Florida hospital after suffering an apparent heart attack.\n\nIn his heyday in the '70s, Reynolds was a huge box office attraction. His love life was as famous as his professional life, courting Sally Fields and Dinah Shore. He was married twice — to comedienne Judy Carne from 1963 to 1965 and to actress Lonnie Anderson from 1988 to 1993. His divorce from Anderson in 1993 was one of the nastiest in Hollywood history.\n\nIn 1997, Reynolds found a new generation of fans when he starred in “Boogie Nights,\" for which he was nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar.\n\nBefore his death, Reynolds was slated to star in the upcoming Quentin Tarantino film “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” opposite Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nAriana Grande Pays Tribute to Aretha Franklin With Stirring Rendition of 'A Natural Woman'\n\nThe Hidden Meaning of Aretha Franklin's Red Dress at Her Public Viewing\n\nRelated Articles:"
