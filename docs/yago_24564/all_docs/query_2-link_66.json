        "text": "After all, both got their big break on US sketch comedy show Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In, Goldie as the giggling dumb blonde and Carne as the Sock It To Me Girl.\n\nBut unlike Hawn, who went on to become a major Hollywood movie star with fi lms such as Private Benjamin and The First Wives Club, Carne’s life spiralled out of control as she battled heroin addiction, broken marriages and a series of arrests for drugs possession.\n\nIn her autobiography Laughing On The Outside, Crying On The Inside she revealed all about her volatile marriage to Burt Reynolds, named several of her famous lovers and confessed to having a lesbian affair.\n\nShe also wrote about how much her addiction had cost her. “I lost sight of myself,” she confessed.\n\n“My whole life has been extremes. It took me near-death to see the light at the end of the tunnel.”\n\nBorn Joyce Audrey Botterill in Northampton she was the daughter of greengrocers Harold and Kathy.\n\nAn early talent for music and dance saw her attend the city’s Pitt-Draffen Academy of Dance before being accepted into the prestigious Bush Davies Theatrical School for Girls in East Grinstead, West Sussex.\n\nA teacher there began calling her Judy, telling her that Joyce wasn’t a suitable professional name, while the second part of her stage name was taken from a character named Sarat Carn in the play Bonaventure by English playwright Charlotte Hastings.\n\nIn 1956 she made her West End debut in the revue For Amusement Only and her television debut in The First Day Of Spring.\n\nFurther appearances in television shows such as Danger Man and The Rag Trade boosted her profile, as did notable romances with hairdresser Vidal Sassoon, racing driver Stirling Moss and actor Anthony Newley.\n\nIn 1962 she packed her bags and headed to the US where she became a familiar face in sitcoms such as Fair Exchange, The Baileys Of Balboa and Love On A Rooftop.\n\nShe also appeared in the popular spy show The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\n\nIt was while she was promoting Fair Exchange in 1963 that Carne met and married Burt Reynolds.\n\n“We were immediately in love,” she revealed in her 1985 memoir.\n\n“I was engulfed by him, my small body lost in his large frame.”\n\nLess than three Lives remembered years later however they divorced with Carne claiming that Reynolds was abusive during their marriage.\n\nOne-night stands with Steve McQueen and Warren Beatty followed, as did a “meaningful relationship with a woman for a year and a half”.\n\nAfter a couple of films including The Americanisation Of Emily and A Pair of Briefs, Carne joined the cast of Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In in 1968.\n\nThe show which served up a fast-moving barrage of jokes, oneliners and musical numbers, saw Carne doused with water every time she uttered the phrase “sock it to me.”\n\nIt did wonders for her career but after two years she declared that it had become “a bore” and left."
