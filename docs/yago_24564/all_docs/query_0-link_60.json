        "text": "Hollywood legend Burt Reynolds, known for starring in hit films such as Smokey and the Bandit, Deliverance, The Longest Yard, Semi-Tough, and more recently, Boogie Nights, has died at the age of 82. Reynolds died Thursday at Jupiter Medical Center in Florida his manager Erik Kritzer confirmed to multiple publications. Born Burton Leon Reynolds Jr. in Waycross, Ga., Reynolds attended Florida State U. for two years on a football scholarship; however his promising career as a running back was cut short by a knee injury suffered in a car accident. It was at that time that Reynolds turned his attention to acting. After marrying television actress Loni Anderson, Reynolds decided to produce and star in the sitcom “Evening Shade” on CBS from 1990-94, which earned him an Emmy as best actor in a comedy series. Reynolds also received critical acclaim for his performance in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Boogie Nights,” which brought him an Oscar nomination for supporting actor. Reynolds was married and divorced twice, first in the 1960s to “Laugh-In” comedienne Judy Carne and then to Loni Anderson. He is survived by his son Quinton from his marriage to Anderson.\n\nHollywood star Burt Reynolds dies at 82: Hollywood Reporter\n\nVia www.reuters.com\n\n(Reuters) – Hollywood actor Burt Reynolds died on Thursday at age 82, The Hollywood Reporter…\n\nEditorial credit: Kathy Hutchins / Shutterstock.com"
