        "text": "Variation on r1’s comment: There are things worse than death.\n\nA slow decline.\n\nMy MIL dropped dead suddenly at the age of 72, from a massive coronary. She was still otherwise quite healthy and very active. That’s how I want to go.\n\nMy own mother is in slow decline like Burt here, and it fucking SUCKS. She wears adult diapers. She hates everything. She has to decide whether or not to have open heart surgery. I think she’s gonna take the big gamble. Either it’ll make her feel a little better or it’ll kill her. And she said she wouldn’t mind if it killed her. I agreed.\n\nR16 - how old is your mom?\n\nI fully am on board with the idea of quality of life over quantity & in general agree with your mom’s take on the risks/rewards of having the surgery.\n\nThe reason I ask about her age is because of a great article in New York Magazine a few years back. The authors mother went in for a heart prociedure but because she was in her 80s the anistesia really messed her up worse - a possible outcome the doctors really didn’t discuss with them beforehand. The article is about our screwed up medical system, and it is shockingly informative - but as someone with parents in their 80s the new thing I learned is how dangerous being put under is for people that age\n\nGood luck with everything.\n\n[quote]Maybe, it's karma. He was abusive to some women.\n\nHe would also physically assault men on the set of his movies, apparently because he thought it was \"manly,\" and of course no one could hit him back because he was the star. What an asshole.\n\nSo, I'm fine with OP's pic.\n\nI know this sounds like hitting him below the belt when he's down, but usually when someone either ODs or just dies after years of heavy drug abuse you guys show little sympathy(especially when it is a flyoverian opioid user type.)\n\nI an absolutely tell you that no one still standing up on earth has used more drugs than BR. Oh, it was for his TMJ...oh it was from back injuries from stunt work(that one is the funniest if you new the real story.) He was using Halcion when it was still available like it was MnMs and Percocet like it was breath mints. Frankly, I don't know how he managed to walk around 30 years ago, and I really don't understand how he is still alive. Judy Garland had NOTHING on Burt Reynolds(who we all called Buddy.)\n\nHe can be a great guy, but he can also be a complete shit turd of an asshole. I suppose that applies to most of us. Put 2+2 together and think about why he lost the theater, his ranch in Jupiter and his house in LA(I think it was in Bel Air.) It's the same reason he is still needing to drag himself out to get work in any film that wants him. It's okay to feel sad for his condition, but believe me, it happened for a reason.\n\nI think it partly stems from painkillers. And part of it is spending a life in the closet. When your best friends are Charles Nelson Reilly, Jim Nabors, and Dom DeLuise.\n\nAn acquaintance of mine is Casey Hendershot. He's a stuntman, but he's also been Burt's \"assistant\" for the last 13 years. I'm not going to say too much, but I can tell you he's a giant, (6'7) muscular dude, and he's lived with Burt for the last 13 years as well. Burt gave him the nickname \"Big Red\" And his stunt man career happened to take off shortly after he became Burt's \"assistant.\" And, even though he works all the time as a stunt man, he never quit his \"job\" as Burt's \"assistant\"\n\nI also happen to know that he was flat broke in 2004, and is set for life now.\n\nCome on, be fair, like former dancers, his body has taken a lot of blows. And, as mentioned above, that jaw injury was really bad.\n\nI stood in line behind him at Tower one time and wanted to ask him if he thought we looked alike (I had gotten it all my life at that point, sure as shit not now) -- but resisted, thank God. He was extremely tall and built well, this was right after his first book came out. No entourage or any of that silly stuff, just him in line in the Valley. I don't buy that all that height was from lifts in his shoes as always rumoured. At least he nodded politely to me as he left. A good vintage Movie Star. Don't forget how good the original \"Longest Yard\" was.\n\nWell there definitely seems to be something up with Casey Hendershot, who R91 mentioned, but it seems to go even further back than 15 years. Seems our Casey was nominated for the 1995 Carbonnell Awards (South Florida's Theatre & Arts Honors -- you've heard of it, haven't you) for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Laura's gentleman caller in a production of Glass Menagerie, at, you guessed it: The Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre!\n\nIn the Palm Beach Post, there is an archived article with a pic that has this caption: \"Michael Lin-stroth, Ellen Noelle Barron, Trude Strom and Casey Hendershot, are ready for a day of fun and entertainment at the Burt Reynolds Ranch in Jupiter.\" It was a \"Bandit's Howedown\" for charity.\n\nAs well, it looks like Casey has been a stuntman in a few of Burt's movies in the past 20 years.\n\nHere we go again, just as I did last time I called a celebrity I had seen \"tall\". (a) Burt Reynolds is in no way, shape or form considered short -- even with the dig people make about the lifts in his shoes. He played college football, for Chrissakes, and not as a punter either. I am 5'10\" and I looked up to him when I was behind him in line and (b)( fuck you, I don't have to make up anything as many on this site already know. Trust me, if I were to create a situation, it'd be a lot more sexy than standing behind him in line at Tower without a word.\n\nBurt did a lot of talk shows when it was considered uncool for a major movie star. He obviously loved doing them all, Merv, Mike Douglas, Johnny, Dinah. During the 1970's you would never see Barbra, Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Clint Eastwood, Jack Nicholson, Robert DeNiro, or Al Pacino on talk shows\n\nIt was obvious that he had anger issues stemming from his being redneck southern, Indian (he was bugged by the swarthiness that gave him great looks), and also he wanted to be more Cary Grant than John Wayne or Brando.\n\nHe was probably a victim of the casting couch, and his sexuality probably was the source of his stormy, violent relationships with women. Loni Anderson, with bottle blonde hair and fake tits, was most likely a beard. But my god he was gorgeous.\n\nR136, you just don't \"go to\" Switzerland or Denmark, it's not easy to get in to these countries and get the services - otherwise the entire planet would be there. I know someone who is married to a Dane for 20 years and she lives and works there. I don't know exactly how it works, but she's giving them half her income or something like that in taxes, and will be able to get help now through the end of her life.\n\nHe says the Cosmo thing cost him his Oscar (nomination and award) for \"Deliverance.\" And that he himself cost him his Oscar for \"Terms of Endearment\" by being too vain to have his stomach out (and his hair off, according to Shirl). Not sure it would've had the same punch without Jack though.\n\nI wondered how long it would take before he went on the record as hating Ariel Winter. A train wreck meets an old crotchety train wreck. What a mess. But maybe the tension made the movie good?\n\n\"Going to Switzerland\". There are two options: 1. You are a resident and join Exit, which is a serious outfit that offers counselling first and then sends a doctor over with a vial, that you have to drink yourself. 2. Option two is the ironically named Dignitas, which is open to anyone and tries to talk you into leaving all your money to the organisation in exchange for the same service in a sad room somewhere in the suburbs. Dignitas also got caught dumping urns of ashes into the local lake instead of burying them like their clients paid for.\n\nI always had a feeling growing up in the 70s that he was gay. He just seemed to overcompensate. I doubt he is 5'10\". He was known to wear lifts and cowboy boots to give himself height, and he used to joke about it on the Tonight Show saying God gave him the wrong pair of legs and some other guy was walking around with his long legs. He would make fun of his short legs.\n\nI would love to hear more from R62. I never believed the TMJ story. My mom bought all the tabs and the tabs were all questioning if it was AIDS. He didn't respond for a long time and the came up with the TMJ story. Cocaine makes sense. But I also don't think the AIDS rumors would have been so rampant if he wasn't known to do guys.\n\nI watched him on The Talk after R155's tip and guess what? One of the co-hosts asked him who he misses the most out of all the people he's lost over the years. His answer? Several stunt men he was very close to and Charles Nelson Reilly/Dom DeLuise. I laughed, thinking of all the gossip in this thread. He also told a story about rolling around in bed with Jon Voight after he lost the Oscar and scoffed when the audience giggled at the thought of them being more than friends."
