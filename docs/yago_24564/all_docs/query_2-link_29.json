        "text": "Judy Carne (born Joyce Botterill on April 27, 1939 in Northampton, Northamptonshire, England) is an actress and may be best remembered for her introducing the phrase \"Sock it to me!\" while a regular on Laugh-In.\n\nCarne moved to the United States in the early 1960s. Her first regular acting role was on a sitcom called Fair Exchange, in which she played an English teenager who goes to the United States to live with an American family whose daughter (played by Lynn Loring) has gone to live in England. That was followed by The Baileys of Balboa (1964) and then she had the lead role in Love on a Rooftop (1966).\n\nIt was on Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (19681973) that Carne soared to stardom. Her most popular routine on the show ended with her saying the phrase \"Sock it to me!\", at which point she was doused with water or in some other way assaulted. Carne was on the series only for the first two seasons (19681969), but she made occasional appearances during the 196970 season. Her career faltered after she left the show. Laugh-In producer George Schlatter blamed her for breaking up the Laugh-In \"family.\"\n\nCarne was married to actor Burt Reynolds for two years (19631965) and producer Robert Bergman for one (19701971).\n\nCarne developed a drug dependency starting with marijuana and eventually became a heroin addict. She lived as a junkie and had a near-fatal automobile accident in 1978 that broke her neck. She was in traction for about three months. On October 22 of the same year, Carne was arrested at London's Gatwick Airport for drug possession and did a stint in an English women's reformatory. Her autobiography, Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside (1985), chronicled her difficulties."
