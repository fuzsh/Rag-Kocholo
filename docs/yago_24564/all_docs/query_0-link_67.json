        "text": "The joke now seems as cruel — and as difficult to explain to millennials — as it seemed hilarious in the 1960s: A young, lithe woman, often in a miniskirt or less, stands onstage. She announces that it’s “sock-it-to-me time.” Then, she is hit with a bucket of water, or dropped through the floor, or otherwise clobbered in some form or fashion. Sure, Richard Nixon famously said the words — but he didn’t have his clothes ripped off.\n\nTelevision runs on catchphrases — consider the instant memories sparked by “De plane!” or “What you talkin’ ’bout, Willis?” — but none seem as strange four decades later as the four words routinely uttered by actress Judy Carne on Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In: “Sock it to me.” And now that Carne, who died at 76 last week, reportedly of pneumonia, is gone, her derailed career and tragic life can have no other epitaph.\n\nIn 1969, Carne offered a concise assessment of the show that had her dancing in a bikini when it wasn’t pummeling her. “Frankly, it has become a big bloody bore,” she said before leaving the show the next year.\n\n“Everyone wanted me to sock it to them everywhere I went,” she told People in 1978 — the same year she broke her neck in a car accident. “The role that made me nearly destroyed me.” (The People article’s headline: “Busted Three Times, Judy Carne Says Life Is Still Socking It to Her.”)\n\nAs Burt Reynolds became a star, Carne arguably became best known as his first wife — the pair were married from 1963 to 1966. When she faced legal trouble in the late 1970s, however, her calls to Reynolds, then on top of the world after his appearance in Smokey and the Bandit, were not returned.\n\n“At least he could have helped with the legal fees,” Carne said. “After all, I supported him when he was out of work, and I never asked for alimony.”\n\n“She broke my heart, she really did,” Reynolds later said. “I’ve never said a bad word about Judy, but she’s made a great deal of money talking about me.”\n\nIn 1985, Carne wrote a biography detailing her short marriage to Reynolds, her bisexuality and her drug addiction. Even the title was a downer: Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside: The Bittersweet Saga of the Sock-It-To-Me Girl.\n\n“And, finally, after those celebrities have sold every used-up comedy line, or discount-shoe, or 15-minute stint on a cable talk show, or two-minute cameo appearance,” one Los Angeles Times reviewer wrote, “they go into their Emotional Ready Reserve, and — drawing on resources they never even legitimately had — sell the very last things in their lives: their memories and fabrications.”\n\nThe next year, she was sentenced to three months in jail for “for returning from the United States with cocaine and cannabis in her pocket,” as UPI put it at the time.\n\nCarne’s last credit, according to IMDB, dates back to 1993.\n\n“She was a bit of a recluse toward the end,” said Jon Barrett, who confirmed her death to The New York Times.\n\n“I’m a 1960s flowerchild who has refused to grow up,” she once said, as the Telegraph reported. “‘Mature’ and ‘responsible’ are words I don’t understand.”"
