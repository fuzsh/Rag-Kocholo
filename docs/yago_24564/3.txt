English actress Judy Carne who made it big in America has died aged 76.

The Laugh-In star and ex wife of actor Burt Reynolds was best known for the phrase "sock it to me" on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In.

The star is understood to have been battling pneumonia in hospital, although the cause of death has not yet been confirmed.

Judy made her first television appearance on The First Day of Spring in 1956 and went on to star in Danger Man and The Rag Trade.

Following a number of TV appearances she moved over to the US and soon became a familiar face on American screens.

She married actor Burt Reynolds in 1963, although they divorced just two years later.

In an autobiography published in 1985 entitled Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside, Judy opened up about her battle with drug addiction, including facing charges of possessing heroin, for which she was later acquitted.

Her colourful life in the spotlight also included flings with Warren Beatty and Steve McQueen, she claimed.

Judy's biggest role came in 1968, on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In.

She moved back to the UK some time later and lived in the village of Pitsford, Northamptonshire, with her two dogs.

She died on September 3 at Northampton Hospital, according to reports.

Jo Woolard, a friend of the star, told the Northants Herald and Post: "She was such a lovely lady and it was really nice having a celebrity in the village.

"It is very sad that she has died and I know many people in the village will feel the same.

"She always kept herself to herself whilst living here, but we often saw her walking her two dogs. In fact, that's how I first met her. She had lost one of her dogs and I found it."
