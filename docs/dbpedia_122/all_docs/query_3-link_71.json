        "text": "The new advanced de-mosaic algorithm is a central component of Blackmagic RAW. Part of the RAW processing is moved out of software and into the camera, where it can be accelerated. Noise management, sensor profiling and new edge reconstruction algorithms are used to produce high quality cinematic images with incredible depth, crisp details and beautiful image separation. The partially de‑mosaiced images, along with the unique characteristics of the image sensor, are encoded and saved into the Blackmagic RAW file so you get total control over features such as ISO, white balance, exposure, contrast, saturation and more. The partial in camera accelerated de‑mosaic allows for extremely efficient compression. This results in significantly reduced processing on your computer, making it faster to decode and use the files while retaining the sensor data needed for full RAW control!\n\nUnlike traditional RAW formats, which are slow and processor intensive, Blackmagic RAW is designed to accelerate your post production workflow. It’s highly optimized for AVX, AVX2 and SSE4.1 enabled processors, it’s multi‑threaded and it works across multiple CPU cores. In addition, Blackmagic RAW is also GPU accelerated and works with Apple Metal, CUDA and OpenCL. Frame decoding and image processing is extremely fast, making Blackmagic RAW super smooth for editing, color correction and visual effects in DaVinci Resolve. Best of all, clips are stored as single files, not image sequences. That makes media management easier and file transfers faster than other RAW formats. Blackmagic RAW performance scales as processors and GPUs get faster, making it the only codec that’s ready for tomorrow’s higher resolution and higher frame rate formats!\n\nBlackmagic RAW and the .braw SDK feature highly descriptive and flexible metadata options that are designed to support today’s modern workflows. The SDK takes care of all the work for developers, so supporting Blackmagic RAW is easy and fast. Using the Blackmagic RAW SDK means you get flawless handling of all camera metadata such as lens information, iris, ISO, color space, slate information and much, much more. Metadata is embedded directly into the .braw file. In addition, .sidecar files that contain fully editable and human readable JSON formatted metadata can also be used. The metadata in .sidecar files is ancillary, which means that it can override the file’s embedded metadata without overwriting it. Blackmagic RAW also supports frame based metadata so you can access values, such as focus distance, that often change on a frame by frame basis!\n\nDaVinci Resolve includes support for Blackmagic RAW, so you can start shooting and finishing your work immediately! DaVinci Resolve is used on more feature films and television commercials than any other solution and is the standard in high end post production. This means you can work with the world’s largest facilities to finish your work, or simply download DaVinci Resolve now and edit, color correct, perform visual effects and audio post production yourself! DaVinci Resolve includes full support for Blackmagic RAW, giving you a non-destructive workflow. Picture adjustments and settings that you make in the camera will come into DaVinci Resolve via metadata and are completely editable. You can even make changes to the RAW settings in DaVinci Resolve, open the files in other applications that support Blackmagic RAW and automatically see the settings, so you have a consistent look and controls between software apps and different platforms.\n\nThe .braw SDK is fully documented and publicly available for all developers on Mac OS, Windows and Linux. Using the SDK gives you access to GPU accelerated and CPU optimized algorithms for decoding Blackmagic RAW files. In addition to the encoded image data, the SDK also provides access to unique information about the camera’s imaging sensor so you know how to accurately decode and present the image based on the characteristics of the sensor. The SDK supports 32‑bit float, 16‑bit integer and 8‑bit integer pixel formats, manages the decoding of color science, allows for user customizable color space transformation, and provides access to all embedded and sidecar metadata. You even get advanced features such as I/O clip trimming, preview scaling for fast playback and much more. Best of all, Blackmagic RAW and the .braw SDK are available free and are even included on Blackmagic Design’s camera software installers!\n\nBlackmagic RAW gives you several options for working non‑destructively with LUTs. 3D LUTs can be directly embedded as metadata within the .BRAW file, making it easy to display the images with the \"look\" you want. LUTs can also be stored in the .sidecar files that accompany .BRAW files. LUTs stored in the sidecar file will automatically override embedded LUTs, and if the sidecar file is removed, the embedded LUT will revert to be used again. When working with software such as DaVinci Resolve Studio it’s easy to access these 3D LUTs for editing and color correction, as they always travel with the BRAW file. DaVinci Resolve can even save color grades as 3D LUTs, so you can build your own LUT cube files for completely custom \"looks\" and endless creative options!"
