        "text": "You have to select each different color for each cube which at first is kinda hard. If you want to learn how to solve a runic cube and take lessons and you downloaded it because of that reason please get your money ready to use, it cost money which Iâm not a big fan of i really home that they change it so you donât have to pay money but if you just want to solve it and not learn how to you donât need to pay money, over all there are lots of different ways you could use this app, i wanted to solve a 3 x 3 which I had near me thereâs also an option of 2x2 or a 4x4. Over all itâs an AMAZING APP\n\nPs: have a good day\n\nMy nine year old granddaughter used this app to solve this Rubik's cube that her brother messed up. âAt first, I wasnât sure if this app was going to work, but in the end, it did.â She says. However at the beginning it was a little difficult for her because you had to select a the colors for each square on each side. She had to do it very carefully, because the app can also identify some mistakes you made if you made any. The app itself was free, and the 3x3 feature and the instructions were free, while I think a lot of the other features were not free. It automatically generates instructions after you put what you Rubikâs cube looked like. You just need to find the right column. But overall, if you do it carefully, youâll end up with a perfect, fixed Rubikâs cube and you wonât have to worry about anybody messing up your Rubikâs cube again! Also this whole review was written by my nine year old granddaughter under my permission.\n\nMy first try out with this app, I was so very puzzled with my Rubiks cube. I wanted to figure out a way to figure my cube out. This app came up first so I wanted to try it. To show your cube and what it looks like on the color panel is easy. I must say it works every time! The directions are clear with steps you can do with at any pace. This app is truly remarkable and I would never imagine an app (for free) That works so well! I like to experiment with rubiks cubes, but I am always scared that I will lose my place and forever have my rubiks cube scrambled. But now I donât need to worry because I have this app that will always be able to help and succeed, every time! If you find your rubiks cube to be messed up, you can use this trust worthy app to always have your back.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMackenzie"
