        "text": "All travelers know that having a trusty suitcase or duffle bag makes your trip feel that much smoother and less stressful. As someone who travels frequently throughout the year, whether for a birthday trip to Los Angeles or a week-long work trip to Paris, I've come to rely heavily on my rotation of luggage. I don't switch brands often because when I find the ones I like, I stick to them and that includes labels like and . I've come to rely on various items from both companies, depending on what I'm packing and where I'm going. If these two names have piqued your interest, too, scroll ahead for my personal Béis vs. Away luggage guide.\n\nI tested four different products—a check-in luggage, a carry-on, a duffle bag, and packing cubes—from each of the two brands, so I have a good understanding of their travel selections. And while I would love to say one label is \"better\" than the other, this is too much of a generalization. I know that everyone has different shopping budgets, packing needs, and aesthetics, so I touched on all these points in my reviews of each product ahead. Use my notes as a helpful guide to find the best Away and/or Béis luggage for you and your travel needs.\n\nBéis Check-In Bag vs. Away Check-In Bag\n\nI was excited to test the check-in bags, since A) I'm an overpacker and B) they come in these pretty olive hues, which felt fitting for the fall/winter seasons. Right off the bat, I noticed the Béis 29-inch Roller was huge, even without expanding it to its full size, and lighter in weight (at 11.84 pounds) compared to Away's large check-in of a similar size (at 12.1 pounds).\n\nWhen I did the 360-spin test, both luggages spun around effortlessly while the smooth-gliding wheels rolled down my carpeted hallway and on my hardwood floors easily. They are both sturdy, though I find Away's polycarbonate shell feels harder than the Béis shell (I also asked my husband what he thought, and he agreed). They both feature striped designs with Béis's having a 3D raised element to it. The Béis luggage is a few dollars less than the Away option: $328 vs. $375.\n\nWhat I love about the Béis check-in:\n\nSoft cushion underneath the handle bar\n\nThe retractable bag strap that holds up to 15 pounds\n\nSide carry handle with a weight limit indicator\n\nExpandable compartment (expands to 14.5 inches)\n\nAll the different functional interior compartments\n\nGood for overpackers, big families, and people with kids\n\nWhat I love about the Away check-in:\n\nThe two-tone color contrast between green and black\n\nThe little side bumpers keep your suitcase off the floor when on its side\n\nLock button is on top vs. the side, so that's super convenient\n\nComes with an eraser to buff out scuff marks and dirty spots\n\nComes with a laundry bag (I can stop packing a garbage bag to hold my dirty clothes in!)\n\nA good size for the frequent traveler (though you can get for more space)\n\nThe verdict:\n\nI love both suitcases and would use them depending on the traveling situation. If I was going on vacation with my husband and we could only pack one suitcase between the two of us, I'd go with the roomier Béis Roller. If I just traveling by myself for the week and wanted my suitcase to feel compact and chic with my fashun outfits, I would go with the two-toned Away option. I also love the deeper olive hue here, which I'll use to justify the $47 price difference between the two brands. If you feel torn right now on your check-in luggage purchase, simply go with the color you love more!\n\nBéis Carry-On Luggage vs. Away Carry-On Luggage\n\nI've had my Away The Bigger Carry-On for years, as you can tell by the visible black marks all over it. The suitcase has held up well from my cross-country travels, so I was intrigued to see how it would compare to the Béis carry-on. They're comparable in size as The Bigger measures 22.7\" x 15.4\" x 9.6\" while The Carry-On Roller measures 22.8\" x 15.7\" x 9.8\" and both feature smooth wheels and handle bars. One thing to note is that since my Away suitcase is an older model, I don't have the provided laundry bag or extra interior pocket that the newer versions do. That said, all the other details are the same.\n\nThe Béis Carry-On Roller is a \"shrunken\" down version of its check-in bag so all the functional interior pocket details are the same, which is nice when I don't want to use my check-in bag. I opted for the carry-on without a for aesthetic purposes, though in hindsight, after speaking with a colleague, this extra element would've been nice when I travel with my work laptop (but I digress).\n\nWhat I love about the Béis carry-on:\n\nIt features all the same elements as the check-in bag, from the cushioned handle bars to the retractable bag strap that holds up to 15 pounds to the side weight indicator\n\nThe unique maple color makes the bag easily identifiable at the airport\n\nExpands up to 12 inches\n\nWhat I love about the Away carry-on:\n\nHas lasted me six years (and counting) and is not dented or broken in anyway\n\nFuss-free compartments that force me to not overpack for quick getaways\n\nThe baby blue color, since it's not sold in this hue anymore\n\nThe verdict:\n\nSince I haven't yet used my Béis carry-on for a flight, it's hard to know how it will hold up after being thrown around by TSA agents. That said, I do think the brand's design offers me way more room for storage than my current Away suitcase. The overpacker in me is very pleased that I can now bring that extra pair of shoes or even my handheld steamer with me on vacations. The price difference between the two is $77, with Béis costing less and offering more functionalities—a win-win situation in my opinion.\n\nBéis Duffle Bag vs. Away Duffle Bag\n\nTo start, both these duffle bags are perfect for three-to-four night stays depending on the season and what you pack (chunky knit sweaters and boots take up more room than breezy dresses and shorts for instance). The Away duffle has a smooth and semi-shiny exterior and is longer than the boxy Béis option, which has a thicker, fabric-like material. They both have trolley straps, so you can secure your duffles to suitcases and the straps are comfortable to wear across your body. The handles nestled nicely into my hands, too, for toting around.\n\nThe Béis duffle has two deep pockets on the outside you can stuff your chargers and passport into while the Away only has one, but it’s also deep and has a zipper to further secure your items. There are also little loops on the outside you can attach keys or other small items to (like a mini flashlight or portable dog water bowl), but it makes me nervous to have my keys openly displayed, so I didn’t use this design feature.\n\nWhat I love about the Béis duffle bag:\n\nMy keys don't get lost in the duffle thanks to the key leash\n\nOne of the pockets unzips to go over your suitcase's handle bar\n\nFabric feels thick and protective, same with the detachable strap\n\nWhat I love about the Away duffle bag:\n\nThere's a handle on the side to pick up the bag and carry it vertically\n\nThe \"hidden\" zipper pocket is convenient for easy access to your items\n\nDetachable shoulder strap goes across your body diagonally for a comfy fit\n\nThe verdict:\n\nI personally like Away's duffle bag more than the Béis one because it's a little bit bigger and opens up wider, making it easier to take your clothes in and out of. Not only was it able to fit my four outfits, undergarments, and socks for a three-day trip, but there was also room for me to pack two small board games. If you're a conservative packer, you could probably fit a week's worth of clothes in here. Additionally, the germaphobe in me finds Away's smooth duffle bag material easier to wipe down than the Béis one, which feels more fabric-like, even though they're both crafted from polyester.\n\nBéis Packing Cubes vs. Away Packing Cubes\n\nThis was my first time using packing cubes, and now I understand the hype around them. Both the Away and Béis cubes were super helpful in keeping me organized while I packed my duffles over the Thanksgiving holiday. Since packing cubes can be utilized however you see fit—I used the Béis shoe bags not for my footwear, but to hold my undergarments and socks—the possibilities for what they can contain are endless.\n\nI found that the cubes from both brands can carry roughly the same number of garments. To give you a better idea of what they can hold: the biggest cubes can fit at least three to four extra thick sweaters while the medium cubes can hold up to five pairs of my jeans. The Béis flatter pouches held less clothing items than some of the boxier cubes from Away, but offers more versatility if you choose to use the zipper pouch for say, makeup, rather than clothes.\n\nWhat I love about the Béis packing cubes:\n\nThe paper labels that read “sweaters” and “kiddies” were cute touches and made identifying your clothes in suitcases and duffle bags convenient\n\nBags come in various shapes to appeal to all types of packers\n\nYou get a comfortable grip on the packing cubes thanks to the handles on top\n\nWhat I love about the Away packing cubes:\n\nThe set comes in five different shades, which is nice if you like to match them to your suitcase color\n\nThey fold down super flat and compact when not in use\n\nCubes are all of similar rectangular shapes, allowing for more clothing storage\n\nThe verdict:\n\nBoth sets of packing cubes are equally functional and appeal to all types of packers. For me specifically, because I have my own shoe bags already and have countless zip pouches for my beauty products, I prefer to have cubes I can organize my clothes into. Away’s pack of six caters to that more—I can use the longer, smaller cubes to stuff leggings and even rolled up T-shirts into while reserving the bigger cubes for sweaters and jeans. However, I do wish they came with pre-made labels like the Béis set, as this thoughtful detail makes packing much more fun."
