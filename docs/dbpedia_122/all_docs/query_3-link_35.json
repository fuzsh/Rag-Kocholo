        "text": "How to Tell if a Monarch is a Boy or Girl\n\nTo the untrained eye, most monarch butterflies look pretty similar. But if you take a closer look at four butterfly pictures below, you’ll see how easy it is to tell monarch butterfly males from females.\n\nLearning how to sex monarchs is especially helpful if you see a butterfly garden monarch and wonder if you should start searching for monarch butterfly eggs. I can guarantee with 100% certainty a male will leave no such gift.\n\nMales are (slightly) larger than females, but butterflies (like people) come in many different sizes. Some caterpillars pupate appearing far too small, while others keep stuffing their little faces with milkweed ’til they’re ready to burst. I’ve seen giant monarch butterfly males and females. I’ve also seen both in mini-me form. So, if size doesn’t matter, how can you tell monarch males and females apart?\n\nThe male monarch butterfly has a black spot on each hind wing that is made up of specialized scales. In other butterflies, similar spots emit pheromones to attract females, but scientists are not sure what function these spots serve for monarch males.\n\nThese black dots are an excellent ‘male marker’ for sexing purposes.\n\nThe monarch female has noticeably thicker wing veins, which give her a darker appearance. The females hind wings are spotless…\n\nWhen you compare them together, the differences become obvious. Unfortunately, most monarchs won’t be this cooperative in spreading their wings to let you get a close-up view. So how can you sex a close-winged butterfly?\n\nMost of the time, you should be able to see part of the monarch male’s black dot bleeding through to the outside wing. In my experience, it’s pretty easy to see this outside mark on most males. Make a mental note of where this dot is located on the outside wing…you’ll have a much easier time finding it on future males.\n\nSex Monarchs by Caterpillar?\n\nThis is only possible through dissection.\n\nSex Monarchs by Chrysalis?\n\nYou can even tell the sex of a monarch by looking for some identifying marks at the top of the chrysalis. You won’t be able to see these subtle differences with the naked eye, but a digital camera with macro capability or a microscope makes it easy to see the differences:\n\nThe best way to get a good look at monarchs is by raising them at home. After adult butterflies eclose (emerge from their chrysalis) they need a few hours to dry their wings before flight. This give you time to get up close and personal. Raised butterflies will typically allow you closer access after they’re released too…assuming you were a good butterfly parent!"
