        "text": "You could using a ImageEdit. This is a dropdown of Images. So you generate Images first via:\n\nImage.FromFile(Path);\n\nAdd them to a List or ImageList and fill the dropdown with it. Then you just bind the index of the picture to your column.\n\nI hope this is able to work in your case.\n\nedit: OR\n\nAt first you have to create a UnboundColumn in your Grid. Just create a column and set the Property 'UnboundType' to object. Then set a RepositoryPictureEdit as ColumnEdit. Now you have a Column which got a pictureedit in each row. To populate the Images you can handle the CustomUnboundColumnData event. This event you can find on the GridView.\n\nTo accomplish this task do following:\n\nRun GridView Designer -> Change to columns at the left side\n\nAdd Column\n\nIn the Propertywindow ->\n\nset the Columnedit to repositorypictureedit\n\nset the UnboundType to object\n\nActivate the CustomUnboundColumnData event (you can find in the GridView) -> this event fires on loading Grid for every cell.\n\nWith e.ListSourceRowIndex you can get the row of your datasource appending to the unboundcolumn. So you could do following:\n\nprivate void gridView1_CustomUnboundColumnData(object sender, DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Base.CustomColumnDataEventArgs e) { if (e.Column.Name == \"MyColumn\") { clsTest test = myListAsDataSource[e.ListSourceRowIndex]; e.Value = test.Bild; } }\n\nI hope this can help you."
