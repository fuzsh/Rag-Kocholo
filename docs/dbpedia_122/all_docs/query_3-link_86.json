        "text": "For the mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Husk.\n\nA husk is a variant of a zombie that spawns in deserts. They function similar to zombies, except they do not burn in sunlight and inflict Hunger with their unarmed attacks.\n\nSpawning[]\n\nHusks spawn at a light level of 0 in the desert, mostly replacing zombies in these biomes.\n\nIn Java Edition, husks spawn directly under the sky in groups of 4 in place of 80% of all zombies spawned in desert biomes variants.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, husks spawn on the surface in groups of 2-4 in place of 70% of all zombies spawned in desert biomes.\n\nVariants[]\n\nBaby husks and chicken jockeys[]\n\nIn Java Edition, there is a 5% chance for husks to spawn as babies, and baby husks have a chance to spawn as a chicken jockey.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, 15% of naturally spawned baby husks can start riding a mob and become a jockey when it tries attacking a villager, player, or golem. They can ride:\n\nBehavior[]\n\nLike zombies, husks are hostile toward the player, iron golems, villagers, baby turtles, and wandering traders and pursue those mobs on sight from 35 blocks away in Java Edition or 16 blocks away in Bedrock Edition, as opposed to 16 blocks like most other hostile mobs. If any other mob attacks a husk on purpose, all other husks and zombie variants (except zombified piglins) within a 67×67×21 to 111×111×21 area become hostile towards the attacker. They attempt to avoid obstacles, including sheer cliffs, water, and lava, and try to find the shortest path to the player.\n\nHusks apply Hunger to any player or mob they hit using a melee attack unless the husk is holding an item in its main hand or the player blocks the attack with a shield. This effect lasts for 7 × floor (regional difficulty) seconds.\n\nHusks can break down doors successfully on Hard difficulty.\n\nHusks seek out any nearby turtle eggs and trample them.\n\nHusks can pick up items if the game rule mobGriefing is set to true, which will prevent them from despawning.\n\nA husk that is submerged in water for 30 seconds begins converting to a normal zombie, which takes an additional 15 seconds and cannot be stopped even if the husk leaves water. Once this process finishes, the zombie that it converts into will have full health even if the husk has been damaged, and may further convert into a drowned if it remains submerged.\n\nDrops[]\n\nWhen they die, husks drop 0–2 Rotten Flesh. The maximum drop is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.\n\nThey can also drop an iron ingot, carrot, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This drop has a 2.5% chance of occurring, increasing by 1% per level of looting. Individual items have the following chances of dropping:\n\n5⁄600 (about 0.83%)\n\n7⁄600 (about 1.17%) with Looting I\n\n9⁄600 (1.5%) with Looting II\n\n11⁄600 (about 1.83%) with Looting III\n\nAny picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up.\n\nUnlike regular zombies, a husk does not drop its head if killed by a charged creeper explosion.\n\nNaturally-spawned equipment[]\n\nCarved Pumpkin [note 1]\n\nJack o'Lantern‌[Java Edition only][note 1]\n\nIron Shovel\n\nIron Sword\n\nRandom Armor\n\nHusk have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment (other than Halloween pumpkins), with random durability. Each level of Looting increases the chance 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III).\n\nExperience[]\n\nAdult husks drop 5 and an additional 1–3 per naturally-spawned equipment. Baby husks drop 12.\n\nSounds[]\n\nJava Edition:\n\nHusks use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nSoundSubtitlesSourceDescriptionResource locationTranslation
