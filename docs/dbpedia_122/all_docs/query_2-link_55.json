        "text": "The main differences between Soundbar Ultra and Soundbar 600 are related to the acoustic performance of the Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar. They both support Dolby Atmos encoded content and optimizes content that is not Dolby Atmos encoded through proprietary TrueSpace spatial processing technology to sound just as spacious and immersive. The Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar also includes ADAPTiQ audio calibration technology, which adjusts the sound of the soundbar to best fit your room, no matter the shape or furnishings. The Bose Smart Soundbar 600 offers great dialogue intelligibility, spacious sound, but it doesn’t come with ADAPTiQ. While it is still a great performing system, it does not play as loud, as deep, or as spacious as the Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar. Soundbar 900 offers the same features as Soundbar Ultra, but does not include A.I. Dialogue Mode.\n\nProprietary Bose TrueSpace spatial processing intelligently analyzes signals other than Dolby Atmos, like stereo or 5.1, and upmixes them to create an immersive multi-channel sound experience with a sense of height in the soundscape. The result? Enveloping immersive sound no matter what you watch.\n\nUnlike Dolby Atmos — which requires compatible content, hardware, content source, and speaker system —TrueSpace will take any content — regardless of how it was encoded or your equipment — and deliver that Atmos-like experience.\n\nWorks with Google gives you voice control over content playback on Works with Google-enabled Bose devices. This is done via an additional proxy device such as a Google Mini. The command is given to the proxy device, while the content itself is played on the Bose device. You can set up a Bose device as the preferred speaker in the Google Assistant app — this defaults content playback to that device. If you don’t set the Bose device up as a preferred speaker, you will need to include the name of the Bose device in the command.\n\nNo. It only handles the audio output from the TV, no external video goes through the soundbar.\n\nYes.\n\nFor best sound quality, the Bose Bass Module 700 and Bose Bass Module 500 should be placed on the floor against the same wall as the television and soundbar, with an electrical outlet nearby for the power cord. The bass module should not be placed on a shelf or table. For more bass, the bass module should be placed closer to walls and corners. For less bass, the bass module should be pulled away from walls and corners.\n\nNo. All sources must be connected to the TV and then a single connection (via the HDMI or optical cable) must be made from the TV to the soundbar.\n\nYes. It can be controlled by third-party remote controls that include the set of Bose IR commands.\n\nYes. The optional Bose Soundbar Wall Bracket lets you mount the soundbar to the wall.\n\nYes. You can group any of our smart speakers and soundbars (Home Speaker 300, Smart Speaker 500, Portable Smart Speaker, Smart Soundbar 700, Soundbar 500, Smart Soundbar 600 and Smart Soundbar 300) together for multi-room listening using the Bose Music app. This way, you can fill your whole home with music – either synchronized, or different music in different rooms.\n\nYes. Simply say, “Alexa, turn off [speaker name].” or “Hey Google, turn off [speaker name],” (if a compatible Google device is on the same network). This action will stop any content playing, turn off any lights on the light bar, and disconnect Bluetooth devices. If enabled, Amazon Alexa will still listen for voice commands in standby mode.\n\nYes. Bass can be controlled in the Bose Music app.\n\nYes. The Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar and the Bose Bass Modules all use the same wireless protocols and can be mixed and matched. However, the design language and materials of the Smart Ultra Soundbar and the Bass Module 700 are designed to complement each other.\n\nYes. If you desire even more bass, you can wirelessly connect two bass modules to your Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar. But you can only connect two of the same bass modules. In other words, you must connect two Bose Bass Module 700s or Bose Bass Module 500s to a single soundbar. You cannot connect one Bose Bass Module 700 and one Bose Bass Module 500 to a single soundbar.\n\nYes. You can cast audio content to your group of Bose smart speakers or soundbars through the Bose Music app or on the products themselves. Start by creating a group in the Bose Music app and casting to that group, or by pressing and holding the Action button on the connecting device to pair them into a group that’s playing a cast stream. Group your ground floor speakers, or all the speakers in the house and get the party started."
