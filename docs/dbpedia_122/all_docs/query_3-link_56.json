        "text": "“Prior to the BoxIO, you had to modify the electronics of other devices to create a color correction tool that could withstand the rigors of production work. With BoxIO, Flanders delivers beyond the highest bar of quality — not only integrating with their own software suite, but with Livegrade, PreLight and those of the major post production houses. Whether it’s ITU-709, P3, or ACES — BoxIO handles the whole color pipeline, from camera to display, in feature film workflows demanding the highest color fidelity.”\n\nJoshua Gollish, DIT\n\nAdvanced Color Management\n\nBoxIO is an advanced color management device designed for both color critical post production environments and demanding on set color management applications.\n\nBoxIO supports both 3D and 1D LUTs for unparalleled image control. BoxIO can be used for calibration, on set grading, and other LUT based operations.\n\nBoxIO is uniquely well-suited for HDR workflows thanks to 4 key features that are not typically found in combination on other devices:\n\n33x33x33 3D LUT support\n\nTwice the data points of devices with 26^3 3D LUTs and over 7 times the data points of devices with just 17^3 3D LUTs\n\n4096 entry point 1D LUTs both before and after the 3D LUT\n\nMany LUT devices offer no 1D LUT support or only support 1D LUTs or 3D LUTs, but not a combination of the two. The few devices that do offer 1D LUT support typically only offer 1024 entry point 1D LUTs in a single position, either before or after the 3D LUT.\n\nTetrahedral LUT interpolation\n\nTrilinear LUT interpolation, found on many LUT devices, can be particularly problematic in HDR workflows. Tetrahedral LUT interpolation can provide significantly improved accuracy and visual performance.\n\nFull 12bit 444 signal support\n\nMany LUT boxes limit support to 10bit signals, but some HDR specifications are specifically optimized for 12bit signal paths.\n\nFrame Capture\n\nBoxIO supports frame capture over IP allowing select applications including FSI’s IP Remote Utility and Pomfort’s Livegrade to grab reference still frames from incoming video signals.\n\nFrame Callback\n\nFrames captured in BoxIO’s own .RAW format from the IP Remote Utility can be displayed using Frame Callback. This feature has many potential uses including review of reference stills in on set environments, display of complex test patterns, and preview of new looks on previously captured content. Frames can be loaded quickly from a connected computer or directly from 16 available memory slots on BoxIO for even faster frame recall.\n\nPomfort’s Livegrade Pro and Livegrade Studio also support Frame Callback functionality without the need to first capture in BoxIO’s RAW format. You can simply display a shot’s graded still image (or thumbnail frame from a recorded movie) on any connected BoxIO device. By toggling the frame callback on/off, you can conveniently compare a look from your shot library with the current live signal. This way, you transform BoxIO into an SDI output device for reference still frames with just a few clicks.\n\nIP Remote Utility\n\nThe IP Remote Utility provides useful toggles and controls for management of your BoxIO and can be used in conjunction with other applications from FSI’s software partners.\n\nQuickly change mode and channel settings, load LUTs to BoxIO, toggle LUTs on and off instantly, update, manage BoxIO IP and WiFi settings, and capture frames at full resolution that can be saved instantly as a .JPG or .BMP\n\nBoxIO comes equipped with 2 x 3Gbps SDI inputs, 2 x clean SDI loop throughs, 2 processed SDI outputs, and 1 mini-DisplayPort output. The mini-DisplayPort output mirrors the processed SDI output allowing for LUT application on mini-DisplayPort as well as SDI outputs.\n\nBoxIO can be used with consumer 4K and HDTVs using SDI to HDMI adapters such as the BMD Micro Converter for HD signal formats and the AJA HI5-4K for 4K signal formats.\n\nClean loop through SDI outputs mean BoxIO isn't limited to being an \"end of chain\" device. Both clean and processed SDI outputs cleanly pass incoming ancillary data.\n\nChannel Stacking\n\nInternal Channel Stacking in dual-channel mode allows users to select Channel 2's output as the input for Channel 1. This capability has many potential applications including the ability to use a single device for both calibration and real-time look LUTs.\n\nUse a single device for simultaneous use of Calibration and Look LUTs without having to rely on LUT concatenation while supporting both 1D and 3D LUTs at each step in the signal processing chain.*\n\nOperating modes\n\nSingle input / single channel: 1 input, 2 outputs with same LUT\n\nSingle input / dual channel: 1 inputs, 2 outputs with different LUTs\n\nDual input / single channel: 2 inputs, 2 outputs with the same LUT\n\nDual input / dual channel: 2 inputs, 2 outputs each with their own LUT\n\nDual-Link SDI Input / Dual-Link SDI Output (ST-372M)\n\nInputs\n\n2x 12bit 3Gbps SDI\n\nOutputs\n\n2x 12bit 3Gbps SDI\n\n2x 12bit 3Gbps SDI Clean Loop Through\n\n1x 12bit mini-DisplayPort\n\nmini-DisplayPort is not suggested for use with HDMI displays\n\nAncillary data is passed on both processed and clean SDI outputs\n\nConnectivity\n\nEthernet & Ad Hoc WiFi\n\nPower\n\n4pin mini-XLR 12~18V\n\nApprox. 7W power consumption\n\nDimensions\n\nWeight: 2.2lbs (998g)\n\nDimensional Drawing"
