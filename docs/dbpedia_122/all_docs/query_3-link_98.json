Learn how we test and review.\n\nBy a slim margin, Google Assistant wins as our top virtual-assistant pick. As much as Google Assistant† and Amazon's Alexa try to differentiate themselves from their rivals, they're getting more similar with every update.\n\nBut each platform has its strengths. For a better virtual assistant and smart displays, we think Google's the one to beat, but Alexa dominates in terms of music quality and smart home prowess. Despite these strengths, the one you choose ultimately boils down to personal preference.\n\nPros and cons\n\nGoogle Home\n\nPros\n\nBest smart displays\n\nExcellent video service selection\n\nIntuitive in-app smart home controls\n\nGoogle account integration\n\nReal-time language translation\n\nMulti-tasking\n\nCons\n\nFewer smart home options than Alexa\n\nSimplistic smart home routines\n\nAmazon Alexa\n\nPros\n\nBest smart speakers\n\nExcellent music service selection\n\nBetter smart home compatibility than Google\n\nDynamic smart home routines\n\nLocation triggers\n\nDynamic voice tones\n\nCons\n\nLimited support for video services\n\nClunky in-app smart home controls\n\nWhere should you start?\n\nWe suggest starting with a cheap smart speaker to decide if you like voice controls in the first place. At around $50 each, the Nest Mini and Echo Dot are excellent options for beginners.

Read full disclaimer.\n\nDifferences: Google Home vs. Amazon Alexa\n\nMuch like early Android and iOS smartphones were worlds apart but now practically mirror each other in features, you can expect the gap between Alexa and Google Assist to narrow over time as they mature.\n\nFor now, the differences between Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa boil down to how each system deals with specific tasks like smart home routines, shopping lists, and how they design their mobile apps.\n\nFirst, we’ll cover which brand wins in categories they can both compete in:\n\nBest smart displays: Google Assistant\n\nBest smart speakers: Amazon Alexa\n\nBest smart home compatibility: Amazon Alexa\n\nBest mobile app: Google Assistant\n\nBest shopping list: Google Assistant\n\nBest smart home routines: Amazon Alexa\n\nBest real-time language translation: Google Assistant\n\nThen, we’ll cover unique features from the brands:\n\nMultitasking: Google Assistant\n\nLocation triggers: Amazon Alexa\n\nDynamic voice tones: Amazon Alexa\n\nSenior safety features: Amazon Alexa\n\nBest smart displays: Google Home\n\nGoogle's smart displays are pleasant to use, particularly with how many video streaming services they support. It's not a perfect feature but is more capable than what we experienced with Alexa.\n\nAnother feature we like is the option to show curated photos from Google Earth and artwork when the screen's not in use. This is in addition to drawing from your Google Photos collection.\n\nNest Hub (2nd gen) (about $100): This smart display is Google's more affordable model due to a smaller 7-inch screen and no built-in camera. We think it works great as an alarm clock for adults or a tiny TV alternative for the kids' playroom.\n\nNest Hub Max (about $230): The Nest Hub Max has a large 10-inch screen—about the size of an iPad. It also has bigger speakers and a built-in Nest security camera, making it great for video calls over Google Meet. The large size is perfect for recipes in the kitchen but works just as well for watching TV shows in the background of most medium and large rooms.\n\nAmazon Alexa smart display\n\nDuring our research, it was surprising that Alexa's dominance with music services didn't translate into similar performance for video services on smart displays.\n\nWhile Alexa has competent devices, we ultimately preferred Google's approach (and more massive video service selection) as an easier product to use. But they do have one advantage over Google smart displays: every model includes a camera for video calls.\n\nEcho Show 5 (2nd gen) (about $85): The smallest Amazon Echo Show targets a lower price than Google's cheapest smart display, and the minuscule 5-inch screen makes a better alarm clock.\n\nEcho Show 8 (2nd gen) (about $130): This device competes directly with the Google Nest Hub but narrowly wins because it has a built-in camera. It's great for offices and kitchens because it doesn't take up much space.\n\nEcho Show 10 (about $250): The Echo Show 10 doesn't hold up as well to Google as other Amazon Echo smart displays but is a solid option thanks to built-in Zigbee device compatibility. As a bonus, the screen can follow you around a room for optimal audio and video.\n\nEcho Show 15 (about $250): This massive 15.6-inch beast is Amazon's biggest smart display. The Show 15 has a strong focus on helping organize your schedule and is the only model built for wall mounting in both landscape and portrait modes.\n\nFire TV Cube (about $120): Currently unavailable. It doesn't have a built-in screen, but this smart speaker connects directly to your TV for stunning 4K movies and TV shows. It even links to other Echo smart speakers for a better TV experience than Google offers.\n\nAmazon’s pricing dominance\n\nAmazon offers incredible discounts on its Echo devices on a near-monthly basis, while Google's sales are less frequent. This means you're more likely to score a deal on an Amazon Echo.\n\nBest smart speakers: Amazon Alexa\n\nAmazon's Echo smart speakers created the pattern that most online reviewers use to judge all other smart speakers. They deliver big in terms of audio quality but at a price that's more affordable than the industry-topping Sonos wireless speakers.\n\nGoogle perfects a few devices for specific scenarios, while Amazon seems content to experiment with as many Echo smart speakers as possible:\n\nEcho Flex (about $25): The Echo Flex plugs directly into a wall outlet and is a cheap option to add Alexa in hallways or small rooms.\n\nEcho Dot (4th gen) (about $50): While the Flex adds a basic smart speaker to most rooms, the Echo Dot is your starting place for better music quality.\n\nRead our Echo Dot 4th gen review for more info.\n\nEcho (4th gen) (about $100): As the smart speaker market grows, the Amazon Echo doesn't feel as groundbreaking as the original 2014 version. But it's still a worthwhile addition to the smart home with better music quality than most competitors in this price range. Plus, it can control Zigbee smart devices without a hub. This powerful feature is ideal for smart homes with tons of sensors.\n\nEcho Studio (about $200): The Echo Studio is Amazon's thunderous reply to folks that want the loud, vibrant music you might find in a stereo system. It even has Dolby Atmos surround sound, which pairs great with blockbuster movies on a Fire TV streaming device.\n\nOn top of a full range of traditional smart speakers and smart displays, Amazon's playful experimentation results in some nontraditional Echo devices:\n\nEcho Buds (2nd gen)(about $120) and Echo Frames (2nd gen) (about $150) for personal audio\n\nEcho Auto for cars (about $50)\n\nEcho Link for controlling stereo systems (about $200)\n\nGoogle Home smart speakers\n\nGoogle has a smaller selection of smart speakers than Amazon. These speakers hold their own in terms of audio quality but overall aren't as good as Echo speakers.\n\nNest Mini (2nd gen) (about $50): This is an upgraded version of the Google Home Mini. It comes with better sound quality and a wall-mounting option to save space on shelves and tables.\n\nNest Audio (about $100): Nest Audio has great sound quality compared to its tiny counterpart. It's great for most living rooms and larger bedrooms.\n\nGoogle Home Max (discontinued): Google brought the beat with its largest smart speaker but stopped selling it in 2020. This leaves Google without a competitor to the Echo Studio.\n\nGoogle's most radical smart speakers already serve another purpose, and Google Assistant is only a bonus feature:\n\nNest Wi-Fi router (about $170)\n\nNest Cam IQ Indoor security camera (about $300). Read our Nest Cam IQ review.\n\nNest Cam battery (about $180) Read our Nest Cam (battery) review.\n\nBest smart home compatibility: Amazon Alexa\n\nThe first Echo device with Alexa voice services hit the market in 2014—two full years before the Google Home speaker landed. Because of this head start, Alexa supports more smart home devices than Google. Still, most major smart home device makers like Philips Hue and Samsung SmartThings support both.\n\nBut Alexa has another advantage over Google: it can directly control Zigbee devices using the Echo, Echo Studio, and Echo Show 10. This compatibility makes it easier to automate your home with Alexa. It also has some fun extra and hidden features.\n\nGoogle's not completely helpless with smart home integration: Nest Hub (2nd gen), Nest Hub Max, and Nest Wifi all have built-in Thread radios (which work similar to Zigbee) that offer more growth in the future. But Google's not currently using this tech. We expect this to change once the industry-wide Matter smart home standard launches.\n\nWhich is better for smart home security?\n\nAll major home security systems work with both Amazon Alexa and Google Home, so the field's wide open for this category.\n\nLearn how to control some of our favorite security systems with either voice hub:\n\nBest Alexa-Compatible Home Security Systems\n\nBest Google Home Security Systems\n\nBest mobile app: Google Home\n\nFor times you don’t want a vocal reply or you want to manage settings, you’ll use the mobile app. We think Google Home’s app is superior since it grants you quick access to control your smart home devices.\n\nIt places all of your devices on the app's home screen so you can quickly navigate to the one you want to control. You can also create groups of devices specific to the rooms in your home to make it easier to turn off the lights.\n\nSmart device list in the Google Home app\n\nScreenshot: John Carlsen, SafeWise\n\nSmart device list in the Amazon Alexa app\n\nAlexa doesn't place your devices on a single screen like Google—it uses buckets to categorize your smart devices. This is a bit clunkier than Google Home, since you need to select a category first before controlling an individual device. For faster access, you can group devices or add them to your favorites, which places them in an easily accessible spot on the devices tab of the Alexa app.\n\nOne recent addition to the Amazon Alexa app we'd like to see in Google Home is the Energy Dashboard. It tracks how long your devices run and estimates your energy usage. The energy estimation isn't always accurate so you might need to set the right wattage for your devices (the Alexa app guesses at first), but it's still a cool tool for learning about your energy footprint.\n\nAdvanced room planning\n\nEvery device that you assign to a room will react as part of that room. For example, if you have a smart plug and smart lights in the family room and tell the virtual assistant to turn off the family room, everything will turn off.\n\nIf you want the plug to stay on, you'll need to specify turning off the lights in that room or place the plug in a separate room altogether.\n\nBest smart home routines: Amazon Alexa\n\nAlexa has a more robust approach to smart home functionality than Google Assistant:\n\nAlexa can trigger actions and react to conditions in your smart home.\n\nGoogle Assistant only triggers actions. It can't react to most smart home devices.\n\nGoogle Assistant reactions\n\nWhile Google Assistant can't react to a door sensor in the same way as Alexa, it can alert you when a Nest Doorbell (wired or battery) receives a visitor.\n\nLet's try creating a routine using the Alexa app. When you select the option to create a routine, you'll see a screen with basic options:\n\nCreating a new Alexa routine\n\nScreenshot: John Carlsen, SafeWise\n\nYou have the option to name the routine, set a trigger condition (\"When this happens\"), and set an action dictating how Alexa reacts to that action (\"Add action\"). In the second option, \"When this happens,\" you can choose from various triggers, including voice commands, specific dates and times, smart home devices, location, alarms, Echo Buttons, sound detection, and Alexa Guard.\n\nAlexa routine triggers\n\nScreenshot: John Carlsen, SafeWise\n\nHunches\n\nOne recent Alexa feature, Hunches, even allows it to automatically turn off lights when it thinks everyone's asleep or out of the house. Hunches can also change Alexa Guard to Away mode for added security when you leave for an evening run.\n\nOne of the best examples of Alexa's superiority with routines is the simple option to have it play a sound or message whenever a sensor triggers on the front door. Alexa can then say the front door is open. This is something Google Assistant simply can't do.\n\nIn contrast, Google's routines are too simplistic. The only trigger options it gives you are when you say a specific voice command, dismiss an alarm, or at a particular time each day.\n\nGoogle Assistant routine triggers\n\nScreenshot: John Carlsen, SafeWise\n\nAlexa's flexibility with routines is akin to what you find in a smart home system like Samsung SmartThings, making it much more effective and easier to use.\n\nBest shopping list: Google Assistant\n\nGoogle Assistant shopping list\n\nScreenshot: John Carlsen, SafeWise\n\nAmazon Alexa shopping list\n\nScreenshot: John Carlsen, SafeWise\n\nWhile Alexa's lists are easier to access, Google's images are absolute perfection for finding a specific item quickly. This is especially great if you help someone with their shopping or have someone shop for you. Google used to allow you to look up specific items with a picture of the actual product, but now it just shows a generic image.\n\nBoth Alexa and Google allow you to create shopping lists using voice commands: \"Add X to the shopping list.\" But Alexa has a more intuitive shopping list feature than Google Assistant because it stores your lists in the Alexa app. Just select Lists & Notes from the popup menu to access them.\n\nBy default—instead of placing your list in the Google Home app, or even sending it to Google Keep (a great app for shopping lists)—Google Assistant stores its shopping lists on a website: shoppinglist.google.com. This is an odd choice that isn't as intuitive. It requires you to leave the Google Home app or add items using voice commands.\n\nBut Google shopping lists are easy enough to use once you're on the website. We particularly like that you can choose specific items on Google Shopping List and get a helpful photo. It's a strong visual reminder, something Alexa only does with sponsored items or in the suggestions section.\n\nUsing Google Keep with Google Assistant\n\nIt's possible to add shopping list items to Google Keep with voice commands if you create a list in the app and give a specific name. It works as long as you don't have the same list names on the Google shopping list site. It doesn't have the helpful photos or categories, but doesn't require the website.\n\nYou can view all of your Google Assistant lists and notes at assistant.google.com/lists/mainview.\n\nGoogle Assistant supports multiple notes and list apps\n\nAside from the Google Shopping List and Keep app, you can switch to a different provider like Any.do, AnyList, or Bring Shopping Lists. Just choose the Notes and lists option in the settings menu of the Google Home app.\n\nBest real-time language translation: Google Assistant\n\nIn terms of sheer wow factor, Google Assistant's ability to translate conversations between two languages is hard to top.\n\nYou simply ask Google to help you speak a particular language or to turn on interpreter mode, and it does the rest. It's not as fluid as actually speaking the other language since people need to pause between phrases to allow Google time to translate, but it's incredible to have this feature.\n\nWhile interpreter mode supports many languages, there's still room to grow. This feature works on smartphones (48 languages) and smart speakers (32 languages).\n\nAlexa Live Translation\n\nAlexa recently introduced its own interpreter mode: Alexa Live Translation. It works similar to Google's, but currently supports only seven languages: English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese (Brazilian), and Spanish.\n\nUnique capabilities\n\nMultitasking: Google Assistant\n\nGoogle Assistant can handle up to three actions in a single voice command. All you have to do is say \"and\" between each request. Saying \"Hey Google, turn off the lamp and lock the door\" is much faster than making separate requests like on Alexa.\n\nLocation triggers: Amazon Alexa\n\nAlexa routines can trigger based on a location. This helps control all kinds of devices and services, like starting a Spotify playlist when you get home from work. You can also get reminders about picking up tomatoes at your preferred grocery store.\n\nYou can add as many locations as you like by using the settings menu in the Alexa app. This is great for helping Alexa know where to jump into action when you want to do something.\n\nDynamic voice tones: Amazon Alexa\n\nAlexa recently gained the ability to adopt different vocal tones to match the emotions in news articles and user interactions. It can tell if you're happy or sad and reacts accordingly.\n\nOur experience was a mixed bag. Alexa sounds more sympathetic than Google, but not as confident. Still, we suppose emotional sensitivity is better than the hasty confidence behind Google Assistant's voice.\n\nSenior safety features: Amazon Alexa\n\nAmazon has a relatively new service for older adults and their loved ones called Alexa Together. It's a subscription-based service that turns Echo devices into a voice-activated medical alert system. Calls from Alexa Together subscribers are routed directly to Lively's medical alert monitors.\n\nOther features include activity alerts so you know your loved one's up and at 'em for the day, or the ability to remotely set up Alexa routines or reminders on your loved one's Echo device.\n\nGoogle doesn't offer a similar program. The best alternative would be to use the Ask My Buddy skill to place a voice-activated call to friends or family.\n\nSimilarities: Google Assistant vs. Amazon Alexa\n\nGoogle Assistant and Alexa are both great options for a voice assistant—especially for practical tasks like setting timers, smart home controls, listening to music, and checking the weather. Here are categories where they’re neck to neck.\n\nVoice controls\n\nVoice controls are the main selling point of virtual assistants like Amazon's Alexa, Samsung's Bixby, Google Assistant, and Apple's Siri. Entire swathes of the internet are abuzz about which system answers questions better and what skills they have.\n\nStill, there's an unspoken dismissal of the core things most folks use virtual assistants for:\n\nTimers, reminders, and alarms\n\nNews and weather\n\nSmart home controls\n\nMusic\n\nIn practice, there's very little brand differentiation for the things you'll do most often with voice controls.\n\nThe only real difference is how voice search answers questions, with Alexa usually offering briefer answers and Google providing more detail. Even then, you'll likely get a satisfactory answer on most questions as long as you're not digging too deep into specifics.\n\nFor example, both Google Assistant and Alexa know who stole the most career bases in Major League Baseball (Rickey Henderson), but they can't tell you who did it in 2017 (Dee Gordon).\n\nWhy does this happen? It's because voice assistants have to choose one reply within a few seconds. That quick turnaround doesn't allow time to browse every single website on a topic, even with the processing powerhouse involved. In these cases, you're better off whipping out your smartphone to find the best information.\n\nStill, expect this to change as voice assistants get smarter and faster. Who knows what they'll be capable of in five years?\n\nSkip the wake word\n\nBoth assistants can listen for a few seconds after your first voice command, so you don't get weary of repeating wake words. The feature is called Continued Conversation on Google and Follow-up Mode on Alexa. This is a convenient option and pretty much the only way to issue multiple commands to Alexa.\n\nTimers, reminders, and alarms\n\nYou can ask Google and Alexa to set reminders, timers, and alarms quite easily:\n\n\"Remind me to pick up the dog from the groomer.\"\n\n\"Set a timer for 5 minutes.\"\n\n\"Set an alarm for 7:00 a.m.\"\n\nWant to make reservations at a restaurant or order food for pickup? This is possible too, though you might have to set up a preferred service like Grubhub or DoorDash.\n\nLocation-based reminders\n\nBoth brands have location-based reminders where you can get a reminder upon arriving home, to work, or custom location. For example, if you ask for a reminder to get eggs at Walmart, the smart assistant will ask which store you want to use and give you a reminder on your smartphone when you get there.\n\nEntertainment\n\nMost popular music and video services work with both platforms, though there are some minor differences in the selection of brands. Honestly, if you prefer Amazon Music or YouTube Music, then you should choose the voice assistant that works with it.\n\nCheck out our breakdown of compatible entertainment services to learn what works with each assistant.\n\nGoogle AssistantAmazon Alexa Music servicesYouTube Music\n\nApple Music\n\nDeezer (paid only)\n\niHeartRadio\n\nPandora\n\nSiriusXM\n\nSpotify\n\nTuneIn Amazon Music\n\nApple Music\n\nDeezer\n\niHeartRadio\n\nJioSaavn\n\nPandora\n\nSiriusXM\n\nSpotify\n\nTidal\n\nTuneIn\n\nVevo Video servicesGoogle TV\n\nYouTube\n\nDisney+\n\nHBO Max\n\nHulu\n\nNetflix\n\nParamount+\n\nStarz\n\nSling TV\n\nTubi TV\n\nViki\n\nPrime Video\n\nFire TV\n\nHBO Max (Fire TV only)\n\nHulu\n\nNBC\n\nNetflix\n\nTubi TV\n\nWhile looking through Alexa's video skills, we didn't find native support for as many popular streaming services if you're using an Echo Show. It seems the best way to watch other services using Alexa is to get a Fire TV streaming device for your TV, which offers more streaming integrations than Google.\n\nIt took a few years, but Google Assistant finally supports Netflix on Nest Hub smart displays. Previously, it was only possible to stream Netflix on a Chromecast device.\n\nAudiobooks\n\nThese voice assistants use different audiobook services: Audible for Alexa and Google Play Books for Google Assistant, and there really aren't any third-party alternatives.\n\nMultiple accounts\n\nAlexa and Google Home each support up to six user accounts, though Google handles its accounts much better than Alexa. For Google, you can add anyone to your home for free as long as they have a Google account. This includes supervised accounts that you create for children using Google Family Link.\n\nFor Amazon, you can add one other adult with an Amazon account to your Alexa household and up to four accounts for children. Unfortunately, it costs extra to get Amazon accounts for children because you need to subscribe to Amazon FreeTime Unlimited.\n\nTo be fair, neither voice assistant requires more than one user account to start answering questions and controlling smart home devices. But you miss out on things like personalized reminders and access to your meticulously-curated Spotify playlists when you don't link multiple accounts.\n\nVoice match\n\nEach person needs to set up a voice recognition profile for the best customization options so the virtual assistant can provide personalized options.\n\nCalls\n\nYou can make free phone calls using Alexa and Google Assistant to anyone in your contacts list, a business, or by speaking the phone number directly. Calling also works on smart speakers and displays using Drop In (Alexa) and Google Meet.\n\nIf you have a smart display with a camera, then Alexa uses Skype for video calls, while Google Duo is the equivalent on Nest Hub Max.\n\nIntercoms\n\nYou can use smart speakers and displays as intercoms for Google and Alexa. The basic intercom command for both systems is \"announce\" or \"broadcast,\" though Google has extra options like \"shout\" and \"tell everyone.\" Now you can tell the kids to come down for dinner or let everyone know you're running late.\n\nSend a reply to intercom messages\n\nTo reply on Google Assistant, the fam can say \"Reply\" or \"Send a reply,\" followed by your message. Unfortunately, Alexa doesn't support replies to general announcements, but you can use Drop In to establish an audio connection between two Alexa speakers, which works similarly.\n\nWinner: Google Assistant\n\nThere are plenty of differences between Google Assistant and Alexa, but they ultimately achieve similar performance when it comes to tasks you'll use every day.\n\nStill, Google Assistant's smart displays and access to Google's treasure trove of information make it a better digital assistant. But Amazon Alexa steals the spotlight on speaker quality and smart home integration.\n\nIf you're interested, we have a lot more to say about these companies. Check out our related articles below to explore what they can do and see our favorite devices for each.\n\nHow we decided: Google Home vs. Amazon Alexa\n\nBefore comparing Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant directly, we looked at over a dozen reviews covering this subject and asked what was missing.\n\nWe found plenty of articles that summarize what each platform can (or can't) do, but many skimmed over how well each does basic tasks. We also didn't see very much information about how these platforms leverage their smartphone apps. As a result, our review takes a different approach.\n\nWe tested over a dozen features to make sure they work using a Nest Hub and an Amazon Echo Show. We chose these two devices because they cover the gamut of what each brand can do.
