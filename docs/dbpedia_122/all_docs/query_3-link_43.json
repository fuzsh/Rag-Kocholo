        "text": "A security camera lens size determines the field of surveillance view and zoom level that the camera provides. The camera lenses that CCTV Camera Pros supplies generally range from 2.5mm to 100mm. The larger the size of the lens, the more narrow and zoomed in the field of view is. Some of our fixed lens cameras come standard with a 3.6mm or 6mm lens. If you need precise adjustment to the angle and field of view for your application, a varifocal lens camera is recommended so that you can adjust the lens to the exact view that you need. CCTV Camera Pros offers vari-focal lenses such as 2.8-12mm, 6-60mm, and 5-100mm.\n\nDo you need help deciding what size lens is best for you? CCTV Camera Pros has USA based support techs that can assist via email and over the phone. Please contact us if you need assistance.\n\nCCTV Lens Comparison Video\n\nThe above video provides a side-by-side CCTV lens comparison using a box security camera setup with the following lens settings: 2.8mm, 6mm, 12mm, 60mm, and 100mm.\n\nSecurity Camera Lens Comparison Photos\n\nAbove is a side by side photo that compares the same lens settings from the video. Please click here or on the image to view a larger format of this image. The above photos and video were captured using our PRO-680DN box style security camera.\n\nHD Security Camera Lens Comparison\n\nHere are some sample still photos that were taken using different lens' settings from these HD box security cameras focused on a garbage dumpster 90 feet away from where the camera is installed. There are two versions of this camera. The only difference is the varifocal lens that is included. The AHD-BX3-28 comes with a 2.8-12mm lens. The AHD-BX3-5 comes with a 5-50mm lens. The camera captures full 1080p HD video.\n\nTo record these images, the camera was connected to an iDVR-PRO HD surveillance DVR.\n\n2.8mm Lens\n\nThis first image was captured with the camera lens set at 2.8mm. You can see that the 2.8mm setting provides an approximate 95-degree field of view. The garbage dumpster in the background is located 90 feet away from where the camera is mounted.\n\n5mm Lens\n\nThe above image was captured with the 5 to 50mm lens of the AHD-BX3-5 set at the widest setting - 5mm. The 5mm setting provides an approximate 66-degree field of view. The garbage dumpster in the background is located 90 feet away from where the camera is mounted.\n\n12mm Lens\n\nThis image was captured with the camera lens set at 12mm. The garbage dumpster is still 90 feet away.\n\n50mm Lens\n\nThis image was captured with the AHD-BX3-50 camera lens set at the most narrow / zoomed in setting - 50mm. You can see the huge difference in the field of view / zoom when you compare the other images to the 50mm settings. The garbage dumpster is still 90 feet away but appears as though it is right in front of the camera because the lens has been adjusted to bring the view much closer.\n\n180 Degree Fisheye Lens\n\nThis image was captured using a specialized 180 degree fisheye lens security camera. It is a 2.5mm fisheye which makes the view ultra-wide. Mike is standing almost directly below where the camera is mounted.\n\nAbout the Author"
