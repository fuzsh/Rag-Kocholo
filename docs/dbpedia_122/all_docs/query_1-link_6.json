        "text": "The ARRI Look File 1 (ALF1) is our discontinued Look File an was replaced by the ALF2 (ALEXA SXT, Mini, AMIRA, Mini LF) and ALF4 (ALEXA 35 and later).\n\nThe ALF1 can not deal with any 3D-LUTs and only use printer lights, saturation and CDL values.\n\nUse ARRI Look Creator (ALC) to create ARRI’s Look File 1 (ALF1) to use in ALEXA Classic and XT. Based on a *.dpx still frame you can create look by using printer lights, saturation and CDL values.\n\nALC is a free application for Mac and Windows computers.\n\nPlease note: The ARRI Look Creator (ALC) and the ARRI Look File 1 (ALF1) is end-of-life (EOL) and has been discontinued. Nevertheless there are still possibilities generating looks for your ALEXA Classic and XT. Please have a look here...\n\nAn ALF1 can still be created by our ARRI Look Creator (ALC), but the software is EOL and is not maintained since OSX 10.8.\n\nThere are 3rd party possibilities to create ALF1 files with:\n\nPomfort Livegrade Pro\n\nThe ALF1 functionality was removed from the Livegrade GUI, but it can still be made visible by importing this sample Pomfort Look File (*.plf). Select File -> Import Look as Shot -> Pomfort Look (plf).\n\nLattice\n\nWith Lattice it’s still possible to convert a 3D-LUT/Look and generate an approximation ALF1 *.xml Look file for the ALEXA Classic series. Select File -> Export Approximate -> Arri Look XML.\n\nExternal LUT Box\n\nIt's also worth considering external 3D LUT boxes as an option:\n\nAJA Color Box\n\nFlanders Box IO\n\nTeradek COLR\n\nTV Logic IS mini (former Fuji IS mini LUT boxes)\n\nGenerally speaking you need to export the look as a 3D-LUT and build this into an ARRI Look File.\n\nFor ALEXA 35 this needs to be a Log-to-Log 3D-LUT based on actual LogC4 footage (\"Creative Modification Transform\"); the transform to Rec 709 can be either handled by the camera/ARRI Color Management or by using a custom Display Render Transform (DRT). Use the ARRI Reference Tool to create an ARRI Look File 4.\n\nFor all ALEXA and AMIRA cameras using the previous look file format (ALF-2), the look must be based on LogC3 footage. A 3D-LUT to use in an ALF-2 needs to have a transform to Rec 709 baked-in. Use the ARRI Color Tool to create the look file.\n\nARRI Look Library LogC3\n\nCollection of log-to-log 3D LUTs for ALEXA Classic, ALEXA Mini, AMIRA, ALEXA 65, ALEXA LF, and ALEXA Mini LF\n\nARRI Look File 1 offers CDL-like controls as well as printer lights, saturation and a user-definable tone mapping curve. The ALF-1 does not apply LIFT/Gamma/Gain before but after the conversion to REC 709. Usually CDL is done in Log C because there’s more image information in Log C (low- and highlights) still there to work with.\n\nARRI Look File 2 offers full CDL and 3D LUT or Video Look Parameters. Look files in the file header can be utilized in post. The ALF2 enables support for REC 2020 (please see second question: \"What is Rec 2020\") and provides the option for live grading.\n\nARRI Look File 2 – Using the ALF2\n\nARRI Look File 2 - Looks in Editorial\n\nAs explained in the answer \"What is Log C?\" the maximum value of the Log C function depends on the exposure index. In a video image, however, one wants to have the clipping point of the sensor represented by the maximum signal (100%) regardless if this clipping point is 6, 7, or 8 stops above mid gray. Therefore, the LUTs for conversion from Log C to Video normalize this range, e.g. the video signal range will always go from approx. 1% to 100%.\n\nThis normalization is done always in the camera. For post-production, it’s possible to use a LUT that is computed without this normalization step, and it’s called “photometric” (the name is a bit misleading). When one works with a timeline of shots recorded with different settings of the exposure index, it’s easier to use one conversion LUT for all.\n\nOne side effect of this normalization is that you get lower blacks. Users who want to use a single LUT while maintaining the look of the image as output by the camera should use the LUT computed for EI 800.\n\nThe values of the primaries in an image from the sensor of a digital camera relate to the amount of light seen through red, green and blue color filters. There are no colors a camera can’t see, so it does not really make sense to talk about the gamut of a camera. It is, however, necessary to describe the color space used to encode the colors, which in case of the ALEXA camera is called the ARRI Wide Gamut color space.\n\nARRI always strives to deliver the best overall image quality. As part of that we’re continuously improving our color science.\n\nWith the new ALEV4 sensor we've taken our color science through its biggest rewrite since we introduced the ALEV3 sensor in the first ALEXA in 2010. We've made various improvements over the years, but our color science never really came to a rest. In these last years LogC3 became famous throughout the industry. With ALEV4 LogC3 had to change to hold all the dynamic range the new sensor if capable of. So all is new: ARRI Color Engine, ARRI Wide Gamut 4, LogC4. To sum it up we call the new color science REVEAL.\n\nThe good news: REVEAL is compatible with ALEV3 cameras. One can de-bayer ALEV3 ARRIRAW to ARRI Wide Gamut 4/LogC4 and use all the benefits of REVEAL. If shot in ProRes – no worries LogC3 is and will be supported in all post tools through our SDK.\n\nTo get a good, correct color representation, you typically want to adjust the white balance of the camera to the lighting of your scene. As a result, the live output and recorded image of a neutral grey target should not exhibit a color cast (at least while no artistic look is applied). Since it may be difficult to see a color cast depending on the viewing environment, the best way is to look for a color shift with an RGB waveform display or a vecorscope display.\n\nThe camera offers two dials that allow you to set the white balance:\n\n- the color temperature [K] will move the white point between blue and red, or \"colder and warmer\".\n\n- the tint or color cast [CC] will move the white point between green and magenta or \"plus and minus green\".\n\nYou can either set these values manually or have the camera calculate an automated white balance while it is looking at the neutral grey target.\n\nMaterial recorded in Rec 709 (short for ITU-Recommendation BT.709) has a display specific encoding or a, in other words, \"what you see is what you get\" characteristic. The purpose of a display specific encoding is to immediately provide a visually correct representation of the camera material, when it is screened on a certain display device. This is achieved by mapping the actual contrast range of the scene into the contrast range that a display device can reproduce. Examples of display specific encodings are Rec 709 for HDTV screens or DCI P3 for Digital Cinema Projectors. On the downside, a display specific encoding puts some limits on the options for a colorist.\n\nUse the ARRI Color Tool (ACT) to create ARRI’s Look File 2 to use in ALEXA SXT, ALEXA Mini and AMIRA. Based on a Log C-clip or a *.dpx still frame you can create looks using Color Decision List (CDL) parameters, “Video Look Parameters” (VLP) or import 3D LUTs created in a grading session.\n\nACT is a free application for Mac and Windows computers.\n\nPlease note: The ARRI Color Tool has been discontinued. The functionality will be covered by our ARRI Reference Tool (ART) from now on.\n\nUse ARRI Look Creator (ALC) to create ARRI’s Look File 1 (ALF1) to use in ALEXA Classic and XT. Based on a *.dpx still frame you can create look by using printer lights, saturation and CDL values.\n\nALC is a free application for Mac and Windows computers.\n\nPlease note: The ARRI Look Creator is end-of-life (EOL) and has been discontinued.
