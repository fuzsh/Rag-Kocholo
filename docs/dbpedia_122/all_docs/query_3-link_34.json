        "text": "ALEXA 35 uses version four of the ARRI Look File (ALF4). Starting with SUP 1.2.1 the camera offers two modes to use the ALF4 look file:\n\nwith ARRI Color Management (ACM) -> ALF4 (*.alf4)\n\nor with Custom Color Management (CCM) -> ALF4c (*.alf4c)\n\nIn ACM you are using the full ARRI REVEAL color pipeline (from the sensor until the last conversion where ARRI 3D-LUTs are being used for Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) or High Dynamic Range (HDR) conversion to the desired target color space) with your creative touch, where in CCM you must define your own 3D-LUTs to bring your creative grade into an SRD or HDR color space.\n\nLet’s have a look at an ALF4 using ARRI Color Management. In its essence the ALF4 carries Color Decision List values in combination with a 3D-LUT:\n\nIn camera or in the ARRI Reference Tool it is possible to change the look file’s intensity from 0 to 100 in 10% steps.\n\nIf we add the intensity setting and ACM to the graphic it gets more crowded, but nothing changes as one cannot influence the ACM. What we just simply called “Custom 3D-LUT” is now called Creative Modification Transform (CMT), because in CCM it would be difficult to differentiate the one or the other “3D-LUT”:\n\nWhen using Custom Color Management not only the CMT is user definable but also the Display Render Transforms to SDR and HDR. We recommend keeping the CMT a LogC4-to-LogC4 based 3D-LUT and going from LogC4 to SDR/HDR via custom DRTs, but this is not a must. When using CCM mode, Intensity is not available.\n\nPlease keep in mind: LogC4 images require new LogC4 Display LUTs\n\nExisting LogC3 LUTs can't be used with LogC4 images\n\nLogC3 LUTs cannot be converted; looks must be recreated visually in LogC4\n\nIn CCM you are not using “full REVEAL” if you will, because custom DRTs are in place. Both Look Files offer the option for on-set live grading through ASC CDL manipulation (Color Decision List).\n\nTo better differentiate which mode the ALF4 is using we added a “c” to the file extension for an ALF4 using CCM: *.alf4c, where the file extension for a regular ALF4 with ARRI Color Management stays *.alf4.\n\nPlease note: If you are unfamiliar with the creation of 3D-LUTs acting as a “Display Render Transform” or you want to keep it simple, we recommend playing it safe and using the ARRI Color Management.\n\nARRI cameras use the look file to offer the option for on-set live grading through CDL manipulation (ASC Color Decision List).\n\nLike other metadata, for example camera status information or lens metadata, the look file travels in each clip’s file header. This means if you have the original file, or a copy of it, you can extract the look file. Transcoding destroys all the embedded metadata. Looking at ALF2's role in a production shooting with ALEXA Mini for example, it plays a central role in the production’s camera department. ALF2 gives the director, cinematographer, and costume department a close idea about the final image:\n\nThe ARRI Look Library is a collection of 87 looks that are available pre-installed in-camera. Due to their variety, the looks cater to a lot of different shooting scenarios.\n\nThe looks are numbered within nine themed groups: Application, Black-and-White, Contrast, Environment, Film, Period, Season, Special, and Tinted. In a sense, the looks can be thought of as being similar to different film stocks, each providing a unique but repeatable aesthetic when combined with the cinematographer’s choice of lenses.\n\nThe Look Library is a tool for on set as well as for postproduction: a look can be a grading node in a more complex setup or work on its own. When a look is selected on set it travels as metadata in the clip's file header into postproduction, where it can be extracted and exported as a 3D LUT. To ease the use in postproduction and the development of custom log-to-log look variants, we're also offering log-to-log versions of the Look Library free of charge.\n\nIn general there are two Look Libraries: \"LogC3\" and \"LogC4\" - choose the right one depending on which camera was used on your project:\n\nLook Library LogC3 for ALEXA Mini, AMIRA, ALEXA SXT, ALEXA 65, ALEXA LF and ALEXA Mini LF\n\nLook Library LogC4 for ALEXA 35\n\nThe looks are available as *.cube log-to-log 3D LUTs or as ARRI Look Files for in-camera use. See below.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nARRI Reference Tool (ALF4 creation for ALEXA 35)\n\nARRI Color Tool (ALF2 creation for ALEXA SXT, ALEXA 65, ALEXA LF/Mini LF, ALEXA Mini, and AMIRA)\n\nColor FAQ"
