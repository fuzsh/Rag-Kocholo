        "text": "This overview will help you identify a USB power adapter from Apple. Apple USB power adapters and cables are included with many products and are available separately from Apple and authorized Apple resellers.\n\nCustomer safety is a top priority at Apple. That’s why all our products—including USB power adapters—undergo rigorous testing for safety and reliability and are designed to meet government safety standards around the world.\n\nAs part of our efforts to reach our environmental goals, iPhone models no longer include a power adapter in the box. iPhone continues to work with existing power adapters and USB-A to Lightning cables, such as those included in prior models. iPhone models now include in the box a newer USB‑C to Lightning cable that supports fast charging and is compatible with USB‑C power adapters and computer ports that you might already have. You can use either a USB-A to Lightning cable or the newer USB-C to Lightning cable with your iPhone.\n\nYou can use any of the adapters listed below to charge your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or iPod. You can also use a Mac USB-C Power Adapter or third-party adapters that comply with applicable safety standards. For more information about charging your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or iPod, refer to the Safety, Handling, and Support section of the iPhone User Guide, iPad User Guide, Apple Watch User Guide, or iPod User Guide.\n\nLearn about USB power adapter certifications\n\nWhen an iOS or iPadOS device comes with an Apple USB power adapter, that adapter is certified to meet government safety standards in countries and regions where the device is available. Many of these countries and regions, including the United States, have adopted the Safety of Information Technology Equipment standard, IEC/UL 60950-1 or Safety of Audio/Video, Information, and Communication Technology Equipment Standard, IEC 62368-1.\n\nApple USB power adapters are designed for use with power sources rated to provide 100V AC to 240V AC at 50Hz to 60Hz.\n\nOriginal and replacement power adapters\n\nIf your device shipped with a power adapter, you can find that listed in the technical specifications for your iPhone or iPad, or in the list below.\n\nIf the original power adapter for your device isn't available, you can also charge iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or iPod with “Made for iPhone” or other third-party cables and power adapters that are compliant with applicable country regulations and international and regional safety standards. Or you can use a Mac USB-C Power Adapter. Other adapters might not meet applicable safety standards, and charging with such adapters could pose a risk of death or injury. For more information about charging your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or iPod, refer to the Safety, Handling, and Support section of the iPhone User Guide, iPad User Guide, Apple Watch User Guide, or iPod User Guide.\n\n20W USB-C power adapter\n\nThese devices come with a 20W power adapter in the box:\n\niPad (8th, 9th, and 10th generation)\n\niPad Pro (M4)*\n\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (5th and 6th generation)\n\niPad Pro 11-inch (3rd and 4th generation)\n\niPad Air (M2)*\n\niPad Air (4th generation)\n\niPad mini (6th generation)\n\n*In some countries and regions this package does not include a charger.
