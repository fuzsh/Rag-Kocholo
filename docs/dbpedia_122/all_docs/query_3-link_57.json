        "text": "I just downloaded this today. Everybody please download this if you have a difficulty with trying to find out how to solve your Rubiks cube go to this app, please go to this app if you follow along, it will help you it shows it shows a thing where you can press the arrows on whenever you like, and then When youâre all the way to the end you solve it itâs pretty simple whatever Rubiks cube you have press the sword button and then it will show you what Rubiks cube you have and then you get to start putting putting the RU know I ribs keep the colors to start putting the colors on the app and then once youâre done with thatYou solve it boom is so simple everybody please download this app I swear you wonât regret it\n\nI tried every way to solve my cube I even made a cross but I still could not solve it till I ran into this app! It made me happy to finally solve this so If I were u I would get this app if u have trouble solving ur cube itâs AWSOME!!!!! But also this needs more ads I could not see this till my friend at school told me since I cannot solve my cube at home so I never got it till now! But this game also needs updates There are other cubes out there! And if u need to solve them and u have this app and itâs not on there u canât solve it but on top of all of that I will rate this a five star it really AWSOME!\n\nI was looking at the bad reviews and saw some untrue stuff like how there was no 3x3 and crazy stuff like that it is either that the app is just being weird because of internet connection, or your blind and you need to visit a mental hospital. But the main reason I got the game is because I got a Rubikâs cube for Christmas and I accidentally scrambled it up and then I asked my cousin and they screwed it up but they got one side done so then about an hour later I got the app and I took like 4ish minutes to complete the cube and it was amazing. So get this app right now"
