        "text": "At 1-800-PACK-RAT, we aim to make your moving and storage experience as simple and stress-free as possible by offering convenient portable storage units at affordable prices. When it comes to portable storage container costs, several factors need to be considered, including the size of your portable storage container, how long you might need temporary storage, and how far you need your mobile storage unit to be transported. For a more accurate estimate for portable storage container costs, get a free quote or check out our How Much Does 1-800-PACK-RAT Cost page to learn more about what goes into the pricing for your container.\n\nPortable storage containers offer many beneficial solutions when you’re moving, decluttering, or just looking for extra space. When you choose 1-800-PACK-RAT’s portable storage units, you can enjoy benefits such as:\n\n1) Security: One of the most important factors to consider when looking for a mobile storage unit is security. Our mobile storage containers are weather-resistant, and the all-steel structure helps to prevent the absorption of moisture which can lead to mildew and mold, and come with lockable barn doors to protect your belongings.\n\n2) Convenience: No longer are the days of driving to and from a storage facility to access or drop off your belongings. Our mobile storage containers will be delivered and picked up straight from your driveway or business when you need them.\n\n3) Ground-Level Loading: To make your moving and storage experience as easy as possible, our portable storage containers come with ground-level loading, so you don’t need to lift or carry bulky or heavy items up a ramp or stairs.\n\nOne of our top priorities at 1-800-PACK-RAT is to keep your belongings secure at all times. Our moving and storage containers are designed to be as safe and secure as possible, including the use of our barn-style doors, which are more difficult to break through than our competitors' conventional roll-up doors. Barn doors provide more interior space and are less likely to jam if the contents move around.\n\nOur all-steel, weatherproof, and lockable portable storage containers are designed to keep your valuables safe. They provide security, protection, and moisture resistance to prevent mold and mildew, which wood and plastic containers cannot match. When your container is picked up and delivered for transport, our loading mechanism holds it level, reducing shifting and damage to your items. For even more protection, you can browse our selection of Contents Protection Plans.\n\nCheck out what each container size has to offer!\n\n8-Foot Portable Storage and Moving Containers\n\n12-Foot Portable Storage and Moving Containers\n\n16-Foot Portable Storage and Moving Containers"
