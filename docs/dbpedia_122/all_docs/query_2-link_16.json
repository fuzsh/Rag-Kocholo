        "text": "The Diesse MINI-CUBE is an automated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) analyzer that evaluates whole blood directly from EDTA tubes without consuming the patient sample. The MINI-CUBE produces results in 20 minutes, uses bar code scanning for positive patient identification and easily interfaces to LIS.\n\nThe MINI-CUBE is available through Streck distribution channels in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Mexico, Malaysia and the United States of America, excluding the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Please visit www.diesse.it for distribution information in other countries.\n\nProduct Description\n\nThe Diesse MINI-CUBE is an automated sed-rate instrument that provides excellent correlation to the Modified Westergren method and is compatible with standard 13 x 75 mm K2EDTA and K3EDTA tubes (2.0-4.0 mL) and pediatric (500 ÂµL) BD Microtainer and BD Microtainer MAP EDTA tubes. This compact ESR analyzer requires no reagents, eliminating operator exposure to patient samples and offers random access sample loading, bar code scanning, a Bluetooth printer, automatic archiving of QC and patient data and LIS compatibility. By running your sed-rate testing on the MINI-CUBE, you can eliminate the need to manually record daily runs. Statistical reports are generated with the following features: Levey Jennings charts, standard deviation, CV%, mean, and highest and lowest result."
