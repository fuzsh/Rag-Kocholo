I am Joaquim Rafael Branco of Sao Tome & Principe. I am the immediate past Prime Minister, under the Government of President Fradique de Menezes.Acting in my previous capacity as minister of natural resources, during the bidding for oil exploration rights in the gulf of guinea by several oil companies, I assisted a particular company to obtain one of the licenses .After their bid succeeded, they gave me 48 million$ in cash for my assistance. I cannot introduce or circulate this amount into the banking system of my country because:\n\n1. My provisional duty as a minister allows me to earn less than $1000 equivalent of Dobra (our local currency)\n\n2. Strict stipulations of the Bureau of conduct guidelines and regulations for Public/Civil servants.\n\n3. Due to the intense competition during the bidding for the oil exploration licenses at the time there are now investigations into how the whole process was handled.\n\n4. Furthermore, Groups of persons' in the Government and opposition parties have ganged up against me, with false allegations of an intention by me to contest the next presidential elections. This has caused dissent and discontent in my party circles even though I am the present leader, now prompting my decision to take flight with my family, hence my soliciting your co-operation to take delivery of the funds into your custody for investment purposes .25%of the entire funds will\n\nbe apportioned to you for your efforts and assistance.\n\nI implore you to accord this transaction strict confidentiality and secrecy it deserves no matter what your decision may be.\n\nAwaiting your response with urgency!\n\nRegards,\n\nMr.Joaquim Rafael Branco\n\nFormer Prime Minister and President of the Movement for the Liberation of\n\nSao Tome and Principe/Social Democratic Party (MLSTP/PSD)\n\nSao Tome & Principe"
