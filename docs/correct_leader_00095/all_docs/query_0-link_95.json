        "meta_description": "Arguments over a beer company have opened dangerous divisions in the elite while the ruling party plays fast and loose with the constitution, One of the few working industrial facilities in São Tomé e Príncipe, the Rosema brewery, is the locus of a vicious political dispute pitting one part of the political establishment against the other. It's become a bone of contention in a dispute which threatens the tiny island republic's fragile democratic institutions and threatens to make it a pawn in a geopolitical game. The dispute has also provided the government with an excuse to dismiss judges in the country's highest court, whom it regards as political enemies.",
