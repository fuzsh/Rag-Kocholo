        "text": "About the IPP\n\nCEBRAP’s International Postdoctoral Program (IPP) is designed to provide Ph.D. graduates with an interdisciplinary research experience, allowing them to explore topics beyond the boundaries of their field of study. We believe this will broaden their perspective on contemporary societies’ major issues.\n\nFounded in 2016, the IPP builds on CEBRAP’s successful history of the Cadre Training Program (1986-2002) and the Postdoctoral Program (2003-2007), which have trained 116 young researchers who have since achieved prominent positions at universities and institutions throughout Brazil.\n\nThe Program is currently led by Prof. Maria Hermínia Tavares de Almeida and Prof. Vera Schattan Ruas Pereira Coelho (learn more at Coordinators). It has over 20 active Postdoctoral Fellows supervised by experienced researchers from different Cebrap’s Nucleus (meet them at Supervisors). The IPP has produced 15 outstanding researchers to date (check out their profiles in our Alumni section) and helped current and former Fellows to publish remarkable papers and books. You can learn about the products of the research projects conducted at the IPP in the profiles below and by attending our Open Seminars (see more in News).\n\nAt the IPP, we seek to attract outstanding researchers who are eager to pursue their projects and make a positive impact in their fields. We understand that diversity is a key ingredient in fostering academic excellence and are committed to promoting it. Therefore, we have implemented an affirmative action policy for black scholars. In addition, we strive to create a cohort with a balanced representation of gender, race, and geographic diversity.\n\nIf you are interested in applying to our Program, we announce our annual Call for Proposals during the months of October or November. If you have any questions, please feel free to Contact us.\n\nDo you want to learn more about the IPP? Watch this video where Prof. Maria Herminia Tavares de Almeida and Prof. Vera Schattan Coelho talk about the Program or click here to watch testimonials from participants of the IPP.\n\nProf. Tavares is a senior researcher at CEBRAP and retired titular professor from the Department of Political Science at FFLCH-USP and from the International Relations Institute, working in the International Relations and Political Science Postgraduate Programs at USP. She graduated in Social Sciences from the University of São Paulo (1969), holds a PhD in Political Science from the University of São Paulo (1979) and a post-doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley (1984). Among her publications are the book Crise econômica e interesses organizados (Economic crisis and organized interests – EDUSP) and the article “Privatization: reform through negotiation.” She was a director of the International Relations Institute at USP (2010-2013). She was a visiting researcher at the Institute of Latin American Studies at London University (1992), Tinker Visiting Professor at Stanford University (1996), visiting professor in the Latin America Doctoral Program at the Ortega y Gasset Institute (2000, 2001 and 2002), visiting Professor in the Department of Political Science at Université de Montréal (2006), and a visiting researcher in the King’s College Institute Brazil, University of London (2012). She participated in the Executive Committee of the Latin American Studies Association (2001-2004), the Executive Committee of the International Political Science Association (2006-2009), and was president of the Brazilian Association of Political Science (2004-2008) and the Latin American Studies Association (2010 -2012). She is currently a member of the Brazil Institute Advisory Board and the Latin American Program at the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars (Washington), the Council of Eminent Persons of the World Bank Chief Economist, and the Academic Commission of the European Union-Latin America and the Caribbean Foundation (EU-LAC Foundation). She was awarded by the president with the National Order of Scientific Merit, in the Comendador category (2006) and received the Academic Excellence Award in Political Science from ANPOCS (2013).\n\nCV\n\nClass of 2018\n\nResearch Project at IPP: The Energy Issue in the Macrometropolis of Sao Paulo.\n\nSupervisor: Celio Bermann.\n\nCurrent professional position: Professor in the area of Applied Social Sciences/Governance at the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP).\n\nPublications resulting from the IPP:\n\nALDUNCE IDE, P., GONZÁLEZ MARELLO, M.P., LAMPIS, A., PARDO BUENDÍA, M., POATS, S.V., POSTIGO, J.C., ROSAS, A., SAPIANS ARRUE, R., UGARTE CAVIEDAS, A.

As an option, the researcher can extend their participation in the program for up to two extra years.\n\nThe post-doctoral program is grounded on research activity. Postdoctoral researchers might develop their project under the supervision of CEBRAP senior researchers (PhDs for over 10 years) and can become part of their research teams, choosing topics related to ongoing studies in the institution (see above a list of available Supervisors and check here the Nucleus at Cebrap).\n\nPostdoctoral researchers will participate in three mandatory and regular activities:\n\nWeekly research seminar (Thursdays) in which postdocs successively present their initial project, partial results, and a final written product (article, book chapter, book). This seminar aims at following the project development in its several stages: object definition, theoretical approach, research design, research strategies, and partial and final results. The weekly seminars are held remotely (by Zoom) or in a hybrid format so those who do not live in São Paulo can also engage themselves in participating. Seminar attendance is mandatory.\n\nOpen Seminar with the participation of CEBRAP researchers as well as national and international guests. Open to the academic community, the Open Seminar is an occasion for the post-docs to present the results of their work to the public.\n\nSubmission for publication of an article or book at the end of the program.\n\nPostdoctoral researchers should also:\n\nBe active participants in CEBRAP’s collective activities (seminars and debates) as well as in their affiliated research group, if that is the case.\n\nPresent their research proposals in the Weekly Research Seminar before submission to funding applications.\n\nEVALUATION\n\nThe postdoctoral researchers will have their final product (book or article) evaluated by the IPP Academic Committee.\n\nParticipants who meet the program’s requirements will receive an achievement certificate.\n\nOFFICIAL LANGUAGES OF THE PROGRAM: English and Portuguese.\n\nAPPLICATION\n\nRequired documentation (in English, Portuguese, or Spanish):\n\nApplication form;\n\nResearch project (up to 20 pages, including an initial half-page summary);\n\nCurriculum Vitae (up to 4 pages);\n\nLetter stating the reasons for the candidate’s interest in the program (up to 2 pages);\n\n1 (one) article or paper, published or unpublished, that the candidate considers the best example of their academic production;\n\nPh.D. diploma (or equivalent);\n\n2 (two) recommendation letters to be sent by their authors (former professor or employers) directly to our email – postdoc@cebrap.org.br;\n\nProof of English proficiency for fluent reading and speaking: TOEFL or equivalent, or a statement of advanced knowledge of English, or a description of a significant previous international experience;\n\nDocuments should be sent to the email postdoc@cebrap.org.br, by March 1st, 2024.\n\nApplication Fee:\n\nR$ 150,00, paid through PayPal, bank deposit, or PIX.\n\nFor Paypal, send the payment to: cebrap@cebrap.org.br\n\nBank transfers should be sent to:\n\nBanco do Brasil\n\nAgência 0300-X\n\nConta 10.8440-2\n\nCNPJ: 62.579.164/0001-72\n\nCentro Brasileiro de Análise e Planejamento\n\nPIX: postdoc@cebrap.org.br\n\n*Please send the transfer proof to both postdoc@cebrap.org.br and financeiro@cebrap.org.br\n\nSELECTION PROCESS\n\nClass: up to 10 doctors per year.\n\nFirst phase (until April 15th, 2024): evaluation of the submitted documentation and research project;\n\nSecond phase (if necessary) (until April 30th, 2024): in person or online interview with the potential supervisor.\n\nResults will be announced up to May 10th, 2024 via email (postdoc@cebrap.org.br).
