        "text": "The small African state of Sao Tome and Principe is located on the islands of the same name, in the Gulf of Guinea near the equator. It is an agricultural country, which is among the least developed countries in the world. The economy is heavily dependent on plantation agriculture, and the nascent tourism industry. Employment of the local population is concentrated mainly in such sectors as:\n\n• service sector;\n\n• construction and industry;\n\n• oil and gas extraction;\n\n• agricultural, forestry, and fisheries.\n\nOver the past few years, Sao Tome and Principe's economy has seen significant growth and development driven by the construction, transport, and retail sectors. Cocoa and palm kernels are among the main exports. The state has great potential to become a middle-income country based on its size and GDP per capita but currently has a weak economy.\n\nA little about wages\n\nThe local currency of the country is good. For government employees, the minimum rate of 1,300,000 goods in Sao Tome and Principe is $60 per month. The average salary here is 2,415,000 good, that is, 115 dollars. Given the relatively low cost of groceries in supermarkets, it may well be enough to live on. For example, products such as milk, fresh bread, and cereals cost $1 per item.\n\nWhom to work?\n\nSao Tome and Principe is considered a good place for potential job seekers. There are only a few major employers in the archipelago, but the employee benefits are quite attractive. Skilled workers will mainly find work in the oil and gas sector, and not only.\n\nThe country has been growing significantly in recent years and its education and healthcare systems are improving as a result. Thus, for foreign citizens, there are vacancies for teachers in economics, mathematics, physics, and information technology. One of the most sought after, but at the same time risky in this African country, is the specialty of doctors in various branches of medicine.\n\nIn the field of construction, you can consider proposals for such vacancies as managers of low-rise and road construction, design engineers, and specialists in the field of landscape gardening and landscape buildings. Thanks to natural and cultural resources, the tourism industry in Sao Tome and Principe continues to develop. The professions of private guides with knowledge of several foreign languages, booking agents in hotels, administrators and maids in hotels, and bartenders, chefs, and waiters in restaurants are becoming popular.\n\nForeign residents who do not have special knowledge and skills will be able to find an easy job to their liking. Help in agriculture is always needed here. In exchange, housing is provided and the opportunity to get acquainted with the colour of the country.\n\nEmployment conditions in Sao Tome and Principe\n\nThe process of applying for a job in this country takes place under certain conditions. You will need a work visa in Sao Tome and Principe. Before applying for a work visa at the embassy, it is important to have a guaranteed job. Thus, your new employer will become a sponsor. List of documents:\n\n1. Valid foreign passport. If there is a previous old copy, it must also be presented.\n\n2. A special questionnaire was filled out by the applicant.\n\n3. Photo 3.5 by 4.5 on a light background - 4 pieces.\n\n4. Original and copy of working permit. This document is usually issued by the new employer.\n\n5. An official letter from the company, or employer about the job offer.\n\n6. You also need to provide the necessary information about the vacancy and the salary received.\n\n7. An insurance policy is an essential document, especially in the context of COVID-19. You can buy insurance with one click on the website. The service is offered in several categories, as well as taking out insurance with covid coverage.\n\nThis list is just a basic one. Worth remembering: The Embassy of Sao Tome and Principe has the right to require additional documents, such as property and its valuation or mental health certificate."
