        "text": "“What will you find in Sweden and Norway except obscurity and darkness, all [are] heretics, idolat[ors], sorcerers, poor, miserable, without order nor the use of human reason, sterile lands, and [people] living in the hills like savage beasts.”1\n\nJuan Palafox y Mendoza, Diálogo político del estado de Alemania (1632?)\n\nSweden, the North, the Septentrion; cold, distant, obscure… for many Spaniards and Portuguese in the Early Modern era the Scandinavian countries seemed a distant, heretical, and enemy world. But politics and commerce made an alternative vision possible as well. In 1653, after the Peace of Westphalia had ended the Thirty Years War, Philip IV of Spain wrote to Antonio Pimentel del Prado, his able envoy in Stockholm, emphasizing that Spain like Sweden had been settled and ruled by the Goths, and thus despite their present religious differences, the two monarchies shared a common heritage, He expressed his desire for a firm alliance with Christina, Queen of Sweden,\n\n“Whose friendship I will always put first. Considering it the most dependable and secure not only because of the goodness and sincerity of the current queen, but also because of the ancient friendship and relationship of the two kingdoms of Sweden and Spain being of the same nation [people], and now entrenched by the Peace of Germany.”2\n\nIt would seem at first glance that despite shared Gothic origins, Lutheran Sweden had little in common with the Iberian kingdoms of the composite Habsburg Catholic Monarchy, and Portugal even less so than Castile.5 In reality, however, there were some surprising similarities and connections between Portugal and Sweden. In the Early Modern period their populations were roughly similar: Portugal had about a million inhabitants, and Sweden including Finland about a million, two hundred thousand. Both Portugal and Sweden created empires; the Portuguese in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and the Swedes in the seventeenth with the acquisition of Finland, parts of Norway, Estland, Livonia, Ingria, Karelia, Denmark and northern Germany.6 We should also recognize Swedish short-lived attempts at colonial settlements or commercial activity outside of Europe with the settlement in North America of New Sweden (Delaware 1638-55), attempts to acquire a Caribbean island, and the trade outposts created on the Gold coast of West Africa.7 Both countries “suffered” a period of “foreign” control or domination; Sweden under Denmark, and Portugal under Castile, and both kingdoms experienced a dynastic crisis at the end of the sixteenth century; 1578-80 in Portugal and 1593-1604 in Sweden. Both relatively small countries had, by the early eighteenth century, become marginalized from the centers of power in Europe by the rise of France, England, and Holland, and both were forced to engage in a small state diplomacy against larger and more powerful players.\n\nThere is also a curious parallel between the history of Sweden and Portugal since both were affected by the death of their kings in battle, and by the dynastic politics that followed those events. The death of a ruling monarch on a battlefield was an extraordinary event, and the images of a vacant throne and of a headless body politic weighed heavily in political discourse of the two kingdoms. In 1578, Dom Sebastião, king of Portugal and a nephew of Spain’s Felipe II, moved by religious fervor and imperial ambitions had led a hapless crusading intervention into Moroccan politics. There, the king died, disappearing in the midst of battle, his death creating a dynastic crisis that eventually carried Phillip II of Spain to the throne of Portugal in 1581. For the next sixty years, Portugal remained a kingdom within the composite Habsburg Catholic Monarchy, although rumors of Sebastian’s survival circulated and solidified into a nationalistic millenarian myth.\n\nDuring the same period in Sweden, king Gustav II Adolph (Gustavus Adolphus), a firmly convinced Lutheran and an energetic and strong leader, pursued an expansionist program, hoping to control strategic points around the Baltic that would turn it into a Swedish sea.9 In the 1620’s the military power of Sweden rapidly increased due to the foreign policy of the king, a reform of the army, and a program of industrial development that concentrated on mining and the export of copper and iron.10 Sweden became self-sufficient in armaments and a major supplier of weapons to the rest of Europe. These changes along with the introduction of new military tactics that integrated light artillery into the plan of battle made Swedish troops the most feared in the Baltic by mid-century, and Sweden a major player in the Thirty Years War.11 Its rise as a fiscal-military state and an empire was also accompanied by millenarian expectations based on a perception of biblical kings deemed to be Lutheran in spirit.12\n\nBut this rise in Swedish power had come at a high cost. Taxes on land and on commerce in the Baltic Sea to pay for the territorial expansion, and the growing military expenses and conscription weighed heavily on the population. They also negatively affected Sweden’s relations with England and Holland, countries that also maintained a considerable Baltic trade. Gustavus Adolphus needed the Baltic commercial income because Sweden was essentially a poor country and lacked the funds to finance his program of expansion. That need also influenced the country’s diplomacy. A treaty with Richelieu’s France (Treaty of Barwalde, 1631) brought Sweden over one million livres tournois annually in return for keeping its forces in Germany confronting the Habsburgs. Sweden’s cost was also high in men. National recruitment and high mortality levels for those enlisted produced demographic decline and an increasing use of expensive mercenaries. Sweden’s export of iron and copper and use of the latter metal for currency became essential to cover these costs and basically funded Sweden’s expansion in the seventeenth century.13\n\nFrom a strategy originally defensive in nature, Sweden’s success in Germany after 1630 caused Gustavus Adolphus and his Lord Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, to consider the formation of a Protestant League that could unite Swedish and German princes for political and military advantage. This idea of a centralization of power under Sweden, like a parallel project on the Catholic side under the Hapsburg Empire, was never achieved.14 The death of Gustavus Adolphus at the battle of Lūtzen (16 November 1632) although a Swedish victory, hampered the grandiose projects of expansion which continued into the 1650s, although subsequent military and political problems weakened the Protestant cause.15 Its defeat at the battle of Nördlingen (September, 1634) initiated a new phase of the conflict and the retreat of Sweden as a military power, even though new victories in 1636 and 1639 did restore the army’s reputation, as did its defeat of Denmark in 1643-45.\n\nFollowing the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) that ended the Thirty Years War, Sweden still held a position of power and influence, but after the king had died in battle, the successor to the crown was his daughter Christina, a girl only six years old at the time of his death. Government had to be assumed by a regency under the direction of Axel Oxenstierna who then governed until 1644 when the young, but quite remarkable Christina, “the semiramis of the North,” could rule in her own name.16 As had happened in Portugal during the period of instability following the death of Dom Sebastian (1578-81), and prior to the assumption of the throne by Phillip II of Spain, in Sweden the regency period witnessed complaints of the estates against monarchical control, the demands of regions against central government, and of the actions of the nobility in favor of their own control of the state.\n\nIt is within this complex international political and military context that the Portuguese revolt of 1640 and its subsequent war for recognition of its independence that lasted until 1668 took place. For Spain, the war to regain Portugal became a conflict with a paucity of heroes, limited accomplishments, and few outright victories; a war that stretched Spain’s thin resources.18 Nevertheless, despite Spain’s ultimate recognition of Portugal’s independence, during the conflict the Habsburg rulers had often conducted an effective political and diplomatic campaign to isolate its restive kingdom. Overall, the changing relationship between the two Iberian kingdoms and Sweden, as all three jockeyed for diplomatic and commercial advantage, had broad implications for the outcome of the war, and at the core of their relations was Sweden’s role as a major supplier of timber, arms, iron, and Europe’s most important provider of copper.19 That relationship also underlined the role of the north Atlantic and Baltic trade in Iberian imperial expansion and the intensification of global trade.20\n\nOn December 1, 1640 a group of Portuguese “fidalgos” entered the governmental palace in Lisbon and assassinated the governor of Portugal, Miguel de Vasconcelos. They then proclaimed the independence of Portugal under the Duke of Bragança who was acclaimed as Dom João IV. After neutralizing the Spanish troops in various garrisons across the country, the first objective of the new king, was to seek international allies and support for the struggle against Spain.21 Both Portuguese historiography and the work of the British diplomatic historian Edgar Prestage (1869-1951) have painted Bragança diplomacy of the era a great triumph, but that characterization seems to be an exaggeration since diplomatic achievements varied greatly due to the shifting objectives and fortunes of the perspective allies, England, France, Holland and Sweden. All those countries desired at times to harass the Spanish monarchy by supporting a rebellious Portugal. Each of them expected some benefit or concession from Portugal in return for their help or alliance. The advantages most sought were commercial; the ability to sell raw materials, armaments, and manufactured goods, to purchase Portuguese salt, and hopefully to gain access to the direct trade with Portugal’s Indian Ocean and Atlantic colonies, the sources of pepper and spices from the former and sugar and dyewood from the latter.22\n\nCommerce and changing European political fortunes, alliances, and hostilities had much to do with the success of the Bragança diplomatic campaign. In fact, given the circumstances, Spanish response to Portugal’s rebellion and its diplomatic campaign was generally effective in isolating Portugal, preventing its participation in the Treaty of Westphalia, and in the Habsburg use of its influence in Rome to prevent recognition of the new regime’s legality, and thus the appointment of bishops in the rebellious kingdom.23 We can not enter into the details of these events, but it is within this international context that the relations between Spain, Portugal, and Sweden should be examined. Portugal’s diplomatic success prior to the end of the Thirty Years War in 1648, and its commercial concessions thereafter reflected its vulnerability as a small power, but one that played its few cards relatively well.24 Its successes also confirm the “new diplomatic history” of the early modern era that emphasizes the role of informal or occasional agents who supported or financed appointed diplomats in achieving the country’s political goals.\n\nThe Swedish reception of the Portuguese delegation was far more encouraging. This was the Sweden of the regency following the death of Gustavus Adolphus, and the young queen Christina was only fifteen at the time. Oxenstierna the powerful regent, had a broad vision of the political situation and had linked Sweden to France as a way of limiting the power of the Habsburg empire. As noted, France since 1635 had been at war with Spain and had formed alliances with Holland and Sweden. Cardinal Richelieu saw the advantages of bringing a rebellious Portugal now into that alliance, although he wished to avoid a formal pact that might later restrict his ability to negotiate a peace with Spain when he saw fit.27 In fact, Hugo Grotius who served as Sweden’s ambassador in Paris had suggested to Richelieu as early as 1637, when news of anti-Spanish riots in Evora arrived, that backing the claims of the Duke of Bragança to the Portuguese throne was a way to weaken the Spanish monarchy.28 Thus Sweden welcoming Portugal as an informal ally served the interests of France, and so Sousa Coutinho’s arrival at the Swedish court was facilitated by a French diplomat seeking to smooth the acceptance of the Portuguese delegation. The entrance of the embassy in Stockholm was splendid and made with all the ceremonial of a formal reception, and there was little need for assistance of the French ambassador since the Swedes sensed their own advantage in the alliance. The official audience was conducted in Latin, and Sousa Coutinho found his hosts anxious to conclude an alliance that would aggravate the king of Spain. A treaty was signed on July 29, 1641.29\n\nThe treaty noted the ancient friendship that existed between the rulers and the peoples of the two kingdoms and mentioned the usurpation of the Portuguese crown by the king of Spain. It then proceeded in twenty-eight articles to establish free commerce between to two countries especially in arms, timber, and masts for naval construction from Sweden in exchange for Portuguese products like salt, essential for the fisheries of the northern countries. The treaty also stated that mariners and merchants would be allowed to take up residence in the other country and would be allowed “freedom of conscience” and religion without hinderance. Portugal was most interested in military and naval supplies, raw materials like iron and copper, and the ability to raise troops and officers from its new ally. Sweden, like England and Holland, had been particularly interested in acquiring the right of direct trade with the Portuguese colonies, but Dom Joao IV had instructed the Portuguese embassies here and elsewhere that under no conditions to agree to an opening of direct maritime commerce with Portugal’s Asian or Atlantic colonies.30 Subsequently, when in 1648 Portugal created a mercantilist Companhia Geral do Comércio do Brasil that would send an bi-annual trade convoy to Brazil, the Swedish representative initiated discussions to involve Swedish investors and ships, but by 1650, those negotiations broke down, in part, it would seem, because England had proved more capable of providing Portugal with the investments and shipping that the fleet required.31\n\nNevertheless, it should be noted that the commerce between Iberia and the Baltic was long-standing and extensive, and had been particularly important to Portugal.32 Even during periods of the Habsburg embargo, some Baltic ports sought to open trade to Portugal and its colonies. In 1636 the master of the Galgo Branco (White Greyhound), one of two ships from Danzig (G’dansk) that had brought wheat to Lisbon during a period of famine, submitted letters to the king and to Princess Margarida, Governor of Portugal, asserting that as a loyal subject of the king of Poland and having brought gain in a time of need, that he should be allowed to sail to Brazil despite the embargo. All of the members of the members of Portugal’s Treasury Council supported the measure, and suggested that the king of Poland would thus be moved to send more ships and goods, and the taxes would benefit the crown. The appeal apparently did not go forward.33 The new Bragança king proved no more willing to open direct colonial trade than the Spanish Habsburgs had been, but he welcomed the continued Baltic commerce. Of the 96,034 ships that had passed eastward through the Baltic Sound and been registered in the century between 1557 and 1657, 19 percent (8,700) of them had come from Portugal, and 78% of these had carried the salt from Setúbal.34 Sweden was consuming 70-80,000 barrels of salt a year, much of it carried in Dutch vessels, except during the periods of embargo in 1598-1607 and 1621-47, when English, Danish, and Hamburg shippers had replaced the Dutch.35 These figures underline the fact that the national origin of merchants, masters, ships or the flag under which they sailed had to great extent become irrelevant as trading networks and patterns had developed that avoided embargos or other state restrictions.36\n\nThe Portuguese treaty with Sweden, like that later signed with Cromwell’s England in 1654, while limited in some ways, was, nevertheless, important because it provided the new Portuguese regime with a certain legitimacy, and overcame its diplomatic isolation.39 Portugal’s representatives in Sweden had expected to find in that country an ally that would that would sponsor Portugal’s place as the table in the negotiations of Westphalia in 1648, but that expectation was eventually frustrated as was also the hope that Sweden might help in the return of Dom Duarte, João IV’s brother who was being held as a hostage by the Holy Roman Empire, and who eventually died in captivity.40 Nevertheless, access to essential raw materials like iron and copper and to high quality arms was a major achievement for the survival of the new monarch. From the viewpoint of England, Holland, France, and other European powers, the attraction of a treaty with Portugal was principally to have a hostile neighbor on Spain’s western flank, access to a few essential Iberian products like the high quality salt available on the Portuguese coast, and the possibility at least of indirect trade with the Portuguese overseas possessions. All of these states also wished to secure the right to trade directly with the Portuguese colonies, but at least for the first decade after 1640, Portugal remained adamant in maintaining the mercantilist exclusive control of trade with its colonies.41 Nevertheless, the treaty between Portugal and Sweden set in motion the linkage of three commodities-copper, salt, and sugar- that were economically essential to those countries, and to Portugal’s colony in Brazil. That relationship underlined the way in which commodity chains are always embedded in changing political and social contexts.\n\nCopper, had been in short supply in the Iberian Catholic Monarchy and especially in Portugal which had long depended primarily on importation for this metal. Some sources for copper had traditionally been found in the Mediterranean, but also in northern and central Europe. In the sixteenth century, merchant firms in Augsburg and Nuremberg, attracted by access to spices and other oriental luxury items that the Portuguese were bringing from the Indian Ocean and the gold coming from West Africa, became the principal suppliers of both silver and copper, the latter metal essential when alloyed with tin to make bronze, or combined with zinc to make brass. Copper coinage of low value was in common use as currency in Portugal itself, but the Portuguese crown also found this metal essential for its trade in Asia, and useful in the form of manilhas, copper bracelets or arm bands traded for slaves in West Africa.43 For those reasons, Portugal became dependent on the Fuggers and other south German merchants, some of whom maintained resident agents in Lisbon, and others who managed their commerce through the active Portuguese trade “factory” in Antwerp.44 A virtual “river” of copper of about 10,000 quintals (c.267 metric tons) a year, much of it mined in Hungary, Bohemia, and elsewhere in central Europe, flowed to Portugal by way of Antwerp or Bruges in the first decades of the century.45 Over half of that imported copper was used profitably in the Portugal’s Indian Ocean trades.46 By the later sixteenth century, German control of copper supply had diminished, and much of that metal was now coming from Sweden, but mostly carried by the Dutch as intermediaries.47 That was particularly the case during the Twelve Year Truce (1609-21) which ended the mercantilist embargos that the Catholic Monarchy had imposed on the Dutch Republic. During those years the Dutch carried two-thirds of all the Baltic trade to Iberia due to their lower carrying charges.48\n\nPortugal remained a major customer. With the beginning of the Thirty Years War in 1618 the increasing demand for armaments created a market with tremendous potential for profit. The careers of the Dutch arms dealer Louis de Geer, and his brother-in law Jacobus Trip who managed the Swedish crown’s royal monopoly on copper purchases provide an example of the possibilities available, and the way in which the copper and other metals could be profitable.49 Using Amsterdam as his base, De Geer created an entrepreneurial network that involved commerce in grains, wool, cloth, timber, iron and copper from the North Sea to the Mediterranean, investments in Swedish mining operations, and the manufacture of armaments that greatly expanded in the 1620s, as well as in shipping these various commodities. The Netherlands played a crucial role in this Baltic trade that while it never stopped, was often disrupted by military and political considerations such as the Catholic Monarchy’s embargoes on trade with the rebellious provinces of the Netherlands (1598-1607, 1621-47) and the fortunes of war between Demark, Sweden, and the Hanseatic ports.50 Portugal, long reliant on the importation of metals, became after 1641 even more dependent because copper was essential in the making of bronze, and thus artillery and other armaments needed by both its land and naval forces.\n\nDuring the period 1599 to 1626, the increasingly large Spanish demand for copper for this purpose had driven up the price of this product. Portugal had long been dependent on copper for its trade, and as part of the Catholic Monarchy it was sensitive to the increasing cost and scarcity of this metal. As early as 1622, the municipal council (câmara) of Lisbon complained that the lack of copper coinage had resulted in the rise of prices. It proposed the minting of 20-30,000 cruzados worth of copper coinage made from money raised by the excise tax (real d’agua). By 1624, the câmara was complaining of a desperate situation and shortage of money, calling it among the “worst problems that we suffer and getting worse each day.” The town council complained that the face value of the coins was so low in relation to the price of copper that coppersmiths were profitably taking coinage and using it to make kettles thus making the shortage even worse.52 While the shortage of copper coins negatively impacted everyday sales, the government feared the circulation of foreign copper currency and of counterfeit coinage and worried about the effect that it would have on trust in the coin already in circulation. What later would be called “Gresham’s Law” (bad money drives good money out of circulation) was already functioning, as gold and silver coins were horded because of their intrinsic value, or used for international exchange, but copper coinage, already scarce, became more expensive to produce for the government, and thus even scarcer.53 During the Iberian union, matters were made even worse as the monarchy’s rising military costs in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe, a series of agricultural crises, and the crown’s diminishing share of the silver arriving from America, forced the crown to alter the value of the existing currency as a way to lessen its financial burdens. Changing the value of coinage, either by debasing its content of precious metal, or by remarking its face value had long been theoretically and theologically questioned, but by the 1620s, such measures had become a seemingly necessary royal action that could be used to relieve the government from financial pressures, but one that undercut public trust in royal authority and added to the process of inflation and to the discontent of anyone on a fixed income, or who otherwise suffered from these state manipulated currency policies.54\n\nAfter its separation from Spain in 1641, Portugal, now lacking access to Spanish silver, and with diminishing access to gold, no longer able to secure it from the Monomotapa region in Mozambique and having been cut off from West African sources after the Dutch had seized its outposts at Arguim in Mauritania (1633) and El Mina on the Gold Coast (1637), was particularly in need for copper coinage for everyday business transactions.55 Moreover, for the new Bragança regime in the period following its separation from Spain, the need to devalue its currency in Europe and in its colonies in order to meet its fiscal obligations, to buy armaments for its defense, and to pay troops both foreign and domestic moved it almost immediately to a monetary policy that would reduce its financial burdens.56 During the previous Habsburg rule from 1580-1640 an exchange rate of one marco de plata had been consistently valued at 2,800 reis. In 1641, Dom João IV seeking to lessen his financial burden, raised the exchange rate to 3,400 reis and then again in 1643 to 4,000 reis. By 1688, later Bragança rulers raised the value to 6,400 reis to one mark of silver, in other words, a depreciation of almost 75 per cent.57 These changes were met with a guarded and well-argued criticism from the Lisbon municipal council which admonished the king that “all change and novelty in money is risky and prejudicial to the common good,” and that in well governed societies, the ruler who had the right to make such changes should only do so with the consent of the people. The council then presented a lengthy historical review of currency devaluations in Iberia, pointing out that the immediate benefits were often ephemeral and in the long term, costly.58 Their objections, however, had little effect.\n\nIn addition, there was now a further reliance created by the growing importance of Brazilian sugar production and trade to the Portuguese economy as the revenues from the spices and pepper trade from the Indian Ocean contracted while those of sugar in the Brazilian colony expanded.59 In 1624, the Count of Salinas, governor of Portugal, had estimated that at a minimum the crown’s annual income from that trade was 250,000 cruzados.60 Copper because of its conductivity of heat was also an essential metal for the equipment and utensils used by confectioners and by the producers of sugar. The need for copper became especially acute in Portugal because of its growing dependency on the taxes derived from the flourishing sugar industry of Brazil that required this metal used in the production of the vats, kettles and shallow pans or teaches needed for the cooking of the cane juice in the process that eventually produced crystalized sugar.61\n\nThe problem was not small. A large sugar mill (engenho) had about 175 arrobas (2.2 metric tons) of copper in its kettles and pans, smaller mills had perhaps about half that amount. Portuguese Brazil with around 350 sugar mills in 1630 would have required about 460 to 500 tons of copper for its equipment, and about 25 metric tons per year to repair and maintain them. Mill owners calculated that each year about thirty percent of its kettles had to replaced or repaired, so that the annual need for copper for existing mills must have been at least 165 tons to say nothing of new construction or expansion.62 Some of the copper came to Brazil in sheets (pastas) or ingots which local artisans used to make or repair the cauldrons, but notarial records from Amsterdam that document shipping of copper also indicate that large sugar cauldrons were sometimes made in Oporto and shipped from there.63 In the early seventeenth century, Bahia bound Lisbon based caravels were carrying copper sheets, “bottoms” (fundos) and iron to the large Sergipe do Conde sugar mill and returning with sugar crates.64 These kettles were a major item in a planter’s capital expenses, and their repair a significant and necessary operational cost.65 The Jesuit manager of Engenho Santana in Ilhéus complained in 1634 that a lack of copper was his principal problem.66 The will and testament of Antonio de Sá Doria who left his estate to the Misericordia of Salvador in 1662 listed in detail the copper kettles and utensils of his small sugar mill.67 This used equipment was auctioned in the following year at 300 réis per pound for over 600 milréis. In 1697, Luís do Couto spent 1,492 milréis for the kettles of the engenho he was building on Itaparica island in the Bay of All Saints.68 Repair of the coppers was usually the largest single item outlay of a sugar mills’ annual costs. The few existing annual account books from sugar mills of this period often contain entries on the purchasing of pastas or bars of copper, or entries such as:\n\n“For the caldereiro of the house of Dinis Bravo for the making of a kettle and for another that he repaired anew, and he enlarged the skimming ladle (parol de escumas) and he fixed the smaller coppers that are necessary at the engenho. 58,520 réis)69”\n\nBy the late seventeenth century, the Portuguese Overseas Council recognized that the rising price of copper and iron imported from Europe forced the sugar planters to buy these essential commodities “fiados” on credit at a price 20-30% higher than what merchants had paid for them, the accounts then settled by the planters by receiving far less for their sugar than the officially determined legal price. The planters had no alternative since “necessity has no law.”70 These significant repairs and purchases were, of course, a continual and essential capital investment, and without access to copper deposits or to a well-developed metropolitan industry for the founding and industrial application of the metal, its supply remained an expense for sugar planters in the Brazilian colony that did not promote industrial development in Portugal as would later be the case in Great Britain with the expansion of sugar in its West Indies.71\n\nHopes for finding an alternative source for copper had flourished in the Catholic Monarchy. In 1616, Felipe III had written expectantly to the governor of Portugal that reports of copper in Maranhão might satisfy the imperial need for bronze armaments, but those expectations were never realized.72 Because of Portugal’s outposts in West Africa, a region where copper circulated widely as currency, and often also had a ritual and symbolic importance as a sign of power as well, rumors of silver and copper mines had circulated since the early sixteenth century.73 The Portuguese crown had even sent smiths to verify the rumors causing the manikongo to complain in 1536 that his rule over the Kongo kingdom would be threatened if his access to copper was reduced.74 Ambitious Portuguese found that reporting the existence and possible benefit to the king of copper or silver mines became a useful tactic for anyone seeking royal assistance for a project in west central Africa.75 The 1611 regimento or royal instructions to the Governor of Angola referred specifically to abundant copper in Benguela that could produce 300 to 350,000 cruzados a year for the “manufacture of artillery, and for my service and for the state of Brazil;” the king suggesting that the copper could be shipped to Brazil without cost as ballast in the slave ships.76 Both Manuel Cerveira Pereira, the first governor of Benguela in 1618, and the Bishop of the Kongo, Frei Manuel Batista in 1621, noted the existence of copper mines in the interior.77 In Angola, the dream of deposits of silver and copper had prospered alongside the expansion of the slave trade, and perhaps their failure to be realized had speeded the growth of the human trafficking. Silver mines eventually found at Cambembe long proved to be naught but a false hope, and although some copper could be found in Kongo and Angola, and had been brought back to Lisbon from the former since the late fifteenth century, profitable mines were never realized until the nineteenth century.78 The real copper belt lay further eastward in south central Africa, in Katanga and modern day Zambia, but since the 9th century, long distance trade had brought it westward.79 Nevertheless, the Portuguese dream persisted as can be seen in exaggerated reports like that of Manuel Pereira who in 1622 told the Count Duke of Olivares that with sixty veteran soldiers at the orders of the king, he had traveled to find the mines in “the midst of the most warlike people in Ethiopia” protected only by his own military reputation. Seeking Olivares’ patronage, he boasted that with his own slaves that he had extracted “the finest copper that exists in your kingdoms, so lacking for the manufacture of artillery.”80 The results, however, were apparently exaggerated or ephemeral.\n\nWell into the seventeenth century the search for copper mines in Angola continued. In 1663, the Portuguese king Afonso VI asked the governor of Angola, Andre Vidal de Negreiros, himself a former sugar planter in Pernambuco, and the owner of five engenhos (sugar mills), to explore further information about mines in the Kongo kingdom. His instructions (regimento) specifically referred to “abundant mines of the finest copper” that could be found in the interior and that could annually yield “great income to my custom’s houses as well as being necessary for artillery and many services for the kingdom [Portugal] and for the State of Brazil.”82 Some mention of mines had been made in a treaty of 1649, but there was no reference to them in a new treaty of 1651. Even though the Kongo ruler informed him that no such mines existed in his territory, Negreiros, realizing the crown’s interest in finding such deposits, and under pressure from the municipal council of Luanda anxious to develop a colonial currency based on copper to pay the troops and to eliminate the local currency of palm cloth (libongos), used the possibility of their existence as justification for a military invasion of the neighboring Christian African kingdom.83 The defeat of the Kongo kingdom at the battle of Mbwila (1665), and the subsequent wide-spread expansion of the slave trade to Brazil benefitted Negreiros personally.84 The introduction of a copper currency for Angola, however, was delayed until 1694.85\n\nIn a sense the fantasy of an African source for Portugal’s copper needs was an inversion of reality since Portugal’s supply of copper to West Africa had driven much of its trade in the previous century.86 While for Portugal Angolan copper mines remained a dream, both Hapsburg Spain and Bragança Portugal continued to depend on European providers and the Japanese, and because of that, they remained captive to the vagaries of diplomacy, politics, national interest, and international commerce. That dependency became obvious when in 1635 after France’s declaration of war against the Iberian Catholic Monarchy, Philip IV retaliated by placing an embargo on all commerce with France and its allies which included at the time both Sweden and the United Provinces of the Netherlands whose ships had often carried the Baltic products like naval stores, timber, and copper to Iberia. It was following the embargo of 1635 when Olivares prohibited the importation of copper from nations hostile to the Catholic Monarchy, that his agent in Lisbon, the secretary of state. Miguel de Vasconcelos, urged the Judicial Council (Desembargo do Paço) in Lisbon in 1638 to discuss how the sugar mills of Brazil could survive given the challenge of finding the copper necessary to continue production.87 Portuguese merchants were already seeking alternatives. In that year Gaspar Pacheco in Oporto sought to send bronze kettles and equipment for engenhos from São Tomé to Brazil, but was denied permission since his small ship had no canons and would probably be lost to the Dutch.88\n\nProceed to the second part of the article..."
