        "text": "Election Results (June–September 2010)\n\nAfghanistan: Legislative elections were scheduled for September 18; results will be reported in a future issue.\n\nBurundi: In the presidential election on June 28, incumbent Pierre Nkurunziza of the National Council for the Defence of Democracy–Forces for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD–FDD) ran unopposed and won 91.6 percent of the vote. Opposition parties had withdrawn from the election in protest of government interference with the vote, and some opposition leaders went into hiding. Grenade attacks and other violence occurred on election day as well as in the days preceding the election. Legislative elections were held on July 23 for the 106-seat National Assembly. The ruling CNDD–FDD won 81 seats. The Union for National Progress, the only opposition party participating in the election, won 17 seats. EU election monitors noted “the absence of multi-party competition.”\n\nColombia: Juan Manuel Santos of the Social Party of National Unity (Party of the U) won the June 20 presidential runoff with 69 percent of the vote. Antanas Mockus of the Green Party won 27.5 percent.\n\nEthiopia: In parliamentary elections held on May 23 for the 547-seat House of People’s Representatives, the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi won 499 seats. Parties allied with the EPRDF won 46 seats, the opposition coalition Medrek won 1 seat, and an independent candidate won 1 seat. A statement by EU election monitors noted that “the electoral process fell short of certain international commitments, notably regarding the transparency of the process and the lack of a level playing field for all contesting parties.” [End Page 175]\n\nGuinea: On June 27, the country held its first presidential election since a December 2008 coup after the death of longtime president Lansana Conté. Coup leader Moussa Dadis Camara, who had declared himself president in 2008, remained in exile during the election. In the first round, Cellou Dalein Diallo of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UFDG) won 39.7 percent of the vote. Alpha Condé of the major opposition party Rally of the Guinean People (RPG) won 20.7 percent, and Sidya Touré of the Union of Republican Forces (UFR) won 15.6 percent. Diallo and Touré had both served in Conté’s government, but later opposed it. The runoff between Diallo and Condé is scheduled for September 19; results will be reported in a future issue.\n\nPhilippines: Concurrent legislative and presidential elections were held on May 10, in which Benigno (Noynoy) Aquino III was elected president.

Two opposition parties had been banned by the government from participating in the election. While the day of the election was peaceful, Amnesty International commented that “in recent months, killings, arrests and the closure of newspapers and broadcasters has reinforced a climate of fear.”\n\nSão Tomé and Príncipe: In August 1 parliamentary elections for the 55-seat National Assembly, former prime minister Patrice Trovoada’s Independent Democratic Action party won 26 seats, while Prime Minister Joaquim Rafael Branco’s Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe–Social Democratic Party (MLSTP-PSD) won 21 seats.
