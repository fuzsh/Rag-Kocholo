The CAME in connection with the National Medicines Fund (Fundo Nacional de Medicamentos) (FNM), a semi-autonomous governmental organization, is responsible for procuring, stocking and distributing essential medicines for the public sector on behalf of Ministry of Health (Ministry of Health of STP, n.d.-b).\n\nProduct Registration Module\n\nAccording to a survey conducted in by “WHO and The Global Fund”, Sao Tome and Principe does not have a pharmaceutical policy, but this does not include product registration (WHO & Global Fund, 2010). The technologies used in this process are not known.\n\nModule for both GDP and GMP\n\nThe Ministry of Health has a General Health Inspection Office (Gabinete de Inspeção Geral de Saúde) (IGAS). This office inspects, audits, controls, and evaluates the actions of health-related establishments in Sao Tome and Principe (Ministry of Health of STP, n.d.-a). Subdivisions of this office include Inspection and Licensing Commission, Medicines Control and Inspection Commission.\n\nThe IGAS ensures that all health-related establishments are in strict compliance with the law, regulations and procedures set out by the Ministry of Health. Inspections are carried out in both private and public healthcare units. Failure of the health establishment to comply with the set standard attracts a penalty. (Ministry of Health of STP, n.d.-a) There is no indication of the use of any software to carry out inspection processes.\n\nPharmacovigilance\n\nPer the conducted survey, Sao Tome and Principe, does not have a pharmacovigilance centre. There is also no adverse drug reaction form for reporting (WHO & Global Fund, 2010). The information available does not include improvements in pharmacovigilance in the country. There is also no information on the technologies used in this sector.\n\nClinical Trials\n\nAccording to the national assembly basic health law, “clinical trials are performed under medical direction per rules defined in a specific diploma and patient consent” (Ministério da Saúde de STP, 2019). However, information on the processes undertaken and the technologies used are not available.\n\nPost Marketing Surveillance\n\nBased on the information gathered from a survey conducted, post-market surveillance is not conducted in Sao Tome and Principe (WHO & Global Fund, 2010).\n\nImport and Export\n\nAll medicines in Sao Tome and Principe are imported (Martinho do Rosário, 2008). As of 2007, drugs are procured through the International Dispensary Association (IDA).

However, the processes involved and the technologies used in gaining a license are not provided.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nMartinho do Rosário indicated that there are no regulations regarding the monitoring and evaluation of the pharmaceutical sector (Martinho do Rosário, 2008).\n\nFinance Module"
