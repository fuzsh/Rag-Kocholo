        "text": "Selected Literature\n\nSupporting countries in using evidence for policymaking is an objective shared by many organizations and initiatives. Under the KIX initiative for which UNESCO IICBA manages the KIX Africa 19 Hub and collaborates with KIX Africa 21, the focus is on six themes: (i) learning assessment systems (ii) early childhood education; (iii) teaching and learning (iv) the data challenge; (v) gender equality; and (vi) equity and inclusion. For each topic, a link is provided to the GPE-KIX Discussion paper written at the start of the initiative in 2019 and additional publications that could be useful for policy. By necessity, to keep this brief short, only a few resources can be mentioned, but additional resources can be accessed through digital repositories listed below. A brief note on UNESCO IICBA research is also provided.\n\nLearning Assessment Systems [GPE-KIX Discussion Paper]. Learning assessment tools and systems are essential to gauge and improve learning outcomes for students. A primer on large scale assessments from the World Bank provides guidance on such assessments, as does a review of learning assessments in Africa from UNESCO IIEP. Among regional assessments, PASEC (Programme for the Analysis of Education Systems) for francophone countries in West and Central Arica and SEACMEQ (Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality) for anglophone countries in East and Southern Africa are the best known. These instruments target primary schools. Also interesting is PISA for development which is being piloted in secondary schools in a few African countries. In São Tomé and Príncipe, the national assessment program known as AALEB (National Large-Scale Assessment in Basic Education) is implemented to evaluate learning outcomes in grades 2, 4, and 6. This program plays a crucial role in assessing and improving the educational landscape. Additionally, São Tomé and Príncipe actively participates in PASEC regional assessments, demonstrating a commitment to benchmarking its education system against regional standards.\n\nImproving Teaching and Learning [GPE-KIX Discussion Paper]. How teachers and students interact and engage is key to improve learning outcomes. Cost-effective approaches pr ‘smart buys’ to improve learning in low-income countries are discussed in a World Bank report. Teaching is paramount, and therefore so are teacher policies to ensure that successful teachers make for successful students. Standards for the teaching profession were proposed by Education International and UNESCO with regional standards available from the Africa Union Commission, including a framework for standards and competencies. São Tomé and Príncipe's formal education system follows a 3-6-6 structure, and the country has outlined its education priorities and actions in the Partnership Compact titled \"Strengthening the education system to generate quality and equity in learning.\" This compact serves as a roadmap for the government and stakeholders to implement strategies aimed at transforming the education sector. Notably, the government is focused on enhancing the teaching quality to address learning poverty.\n\nStrengthening Early Childhood Care and Education [GPE-KIX Discussion Paper]. Experiences children undergo in early childhood can affect their entire life. Nurturing care is essential. Essential interventions in early childhood include pre-primary education. Yet less than half of young children in Africa benefit from pre-primary education according to the Global Education Monitoring report 2021. The Office of Research at UNICEF maintains a webpage with useful links to organizations working on child-related themes organized by subject, including early childhood. São Tomé and Príncipe is actively involved in the Better Early Learning and Development at Scale (BELDS) initiative, a collaborative effort supported by GPE and UNICEF to strengthen early childhood education priorities.\n\nAchieving Gender Equality In and Through Education [GPE-KIX Discussion Paper]. The cost of gender inequality is massive, as is the cost of not educating girls, including in Africa. When girls lack education, this affects their earnings in adulthood, the number of children they will have and their health, as well as their agency, among others. When girls are not in school, they are also at higher risk of child marriage, with again high costs for them, their children, and society. In Africa, the African Union’s International Centre for the Education of Girls and Women in Africa supports member states on girls’ education. São Tomé and Príncipe has experienced significant developments in promoting gender equality in education. The removal of the Disciplinary Act in 2020, with the support of the GPE, was a milestone achievement. This act previously prohibited pregnant girls from attending classes or school activities after the third month of pregnancy, mandating them to attend night school until the end of their pregnancy.\n\nData Management Systems Strengthening [GPEKIX Discussion Paper]. Education management information systems (EMIS) are key for management. They can also support evidence-based policymaking. In Africa, the African Union’s Institute of Education for Development supports member states on EMIS. In addition to EMIS data, other data sources including household surveys, school surveys, student assessments, and impact evaluations of pilot interventions are essential to inform policy. The Department of Education, Culture, and Sports of São Tomé has implemented the Education EMIS integrated system.\n\nEquity and Inclusion/Leaving No One Behind [GPEKIX Discussion Paper]. Equity and inclusion are major challenges for education systems. Gender, disability, ethnicity, indigenous status, poverty, displacement, and many other factors may all lead some children to lack access to education. In Africa especially, gaps in educational outcomes between groups may be large, as illustrated in the case of disability. Equity must be at the center of education policy on the continent. UNESCO GEM Report provides valuable information on strategies, policies, and projects aimed at improving the provision of inclusive education in São Tomé and Príncipe.\n\nNote on UNESCO IICBA Research. IICBA recently launched a new program of applied research on teacher and education issues in Africa. This includes studies, discussion papers, training guides, reports, knowledge briefs, data briefs, event summaries, and interviews. Several of those publications focus on Sao Tome and Principe. All publications are available on IICBA’s website.\n\nCountry Policies\n\nInformation on Sao Tome and Principe’s education system and policies is available on the website of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEES). The country’s Education Policy roadmap covers the period from 2012 to 2022. While some African countries have an independent Teacher Service Commission, Sao Tome and Principe’s does not.\n\nA few organizations aim to capture education policies on specific themes across countries, including Sao Tome and Principe. UNESCO’s Profiles Enhancing Education Reviews (PEER) covering the themes of the Global Education Monitoring reports, including: inclusion in education (2020 Report), non-state actors in education (2021/22 Report), technology in education (2023 Report) and leadership in education (2024/25 Report, forthcoming). PEER also covers additional topics on key SDG 4 issues, including financing for equity, climate change communication and education, and comprehensive sexuality education.\n\nKnowledge Repositories\n\nOnly a few links to the literature on education by theme for São Tomé and Príncipe, Africa, and globally were provided earlier to keep the brief short, but repositories of digital resources facilitate access to the literature. A few of those repositories are listed below by alphabetical order:\n\n3ie Development Evidence Portal (DEP): DEP is a repository of rigorous evidence on what works in international development, including in the area of education.\n\nAERD: The African Education Research Database hosted by the Faculty of Education at the University of Cambridge collates research by African scholars on education.\n\nAfrican Development Bank: The Bank has publications that cover a range of topics, including education. It also hosts ADEA which also has selected publications.\n\nGlobal Partnership for Education: GPE is one of the largest funders for education in Africa. It collaborates with Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC) to build and mobilize evidence on education through the Global Partnership for Education Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (GPE KIX), which has a Library of research outputs.\n\nJ-PAL: The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab maintains a database of impact evaluations and policy publications, quite a few of which are about education.\n\nRePEc: Research Papers in Economics is a large archive of research on economics, including the economics of education. It can be searched through IDEAS.\n\nTeacher Task Force (TTF): The TTF is collaborative across many organizations hosted by UNESCO. It maintains a Knowledge Hub with resources on teacher policies.\n\nUNESCO HQ: UNESCO is the lead agency in the UN systems on education. Its Digital Library includes UNESCO Open Access which includes most UNESCO publications.\n\nUNESCO GEM: UNESCO publishes annually a Global Education Monitoring Report on a different theme each year with associated resources and background papers.\n\nUNESCO IICBA: IICBA is a Category 1 Institute at UNESCO. It conducts research on education in Africa with several publication series and maintains a digital repository.\n\nUNICEF: Publications can be found under Reports, the Office of Global Insight and Policy, and the Office of Research. Also of interest is the Data Must Speak initiative.\n\nWorld Bank: The Open Knowledge Repository provides access to the Bank’s research. It includes a section on Africa with country pages including for São Tomé and Príncipe.\n\nMany organizations maintain websites that include country pages with useful information. Examples include the GPE Country Page; UNICEF Country Page; World Bank Country Page; UNESCO IIEP Country Page. Many organizations also maintain blogs on education issues, often with stories on Africa. Examples include Education for All (Global Partnership for Education), Education for Global Development (World Bank), Education Plus Development (Brookings Institutions), and World Education Blog (UNESCO). Beyond blogs focusing on education, blogs on Africa more generally may also provide useful resources. This includes Africa Can End Poverty and Nasikiliza (the World Bank’s two blogs for sub-Saharan Africa ) and Arab Voices (the Bank’s blog for the Middle East and North Africa).\n\nData\n\nWhile education data are available on the website of the Ministry of Education, it is often useful to download data for São Tomé and Príncipe and other countries from multi-country databases. The largest database on development, including education data, is the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI). The World Bank also maintain the Education Statistics (EdStats) database. Both World Bank databases rely in part for education on data from the UNESCO Institute of Statistics. UNESCO also maintains the Global Education Observatory and the World Inequality Database in Education (WIDE), as well as a wide range of other databases. Specific estimates are occasionally maintained by other agencies. For example, UNICEF provides data on out-of-school rates, adjusted net attendance rates, completion rates, foundational learning skills, information communication technology skills, youth and adult literacy rates, and school-age digital connectivity. Another useful reference is StatCompiler which provides data at various levels of aggregation from Demographic and Health Surveys across countries and over time. For comparison purposes, data from the OECD for member and partner countries (including South Africa) can be useful.\n\nReferences\n\nReferences are available through the links provided in this brief."
