Both are part of an extinct volcanic mountain range, which also includes the island of Bioko in Equatorial Guinea to the north and Mount Cameroon on the African west coast. Sao Tome is 50 kilometers (31 mi.) long and 32 kilometers (20 mi.) wide and the more mountainous of the two islands. Its peaks reach 2,024 meters (6,640 ft.). Principe is about 30 kilometers (19 mi.) long and 6 kilometers (4 mi.) wide. Swift streams radiating down the mountains through lush forest and cropland to the sea cross both islands.\n\nAt sea level, the climate is tropical—hot and humid with average yearly temperatures of about 27°C (80°F) and little daily variation. At the interior's higher altitudes, the average yearly temperature is 20°C (68°F), and nights are generally cool. Annual rainfall varies from 500 centimeters (200 in.) on the southwestern slopes to 100 centimeters (40 in.) in the northern lowlands. The rainy season runs from October to May.\n\nPEOPLE\n\nOf Sao Tome and Principe's total population, about 137,500 live on Sao Tome and 6,000 on Principe. All are descended from various ethnic groups that have migrated to the islands since 1485. Six groups are identifiable:\n\nMestico, or mixed-blood, descendants of African slaves brought to the islands during the early years of settlement from Benin, Gabon, and Congo (these people also are known as filhos da terra or \"sons of the land\";\n\nAngolares, reputedly descendants of Angolan slaves who survived a 1540 shipwreck and now earn their livelihood fishing;\n\nForros, descendants of freed slaves when slavery was abolished;\n\nServicais, contract laborers from Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde, living temporarily on the islands;\n\nTongas, children of servicais born on the islands; and\n\nEuropeans, primarily Portuguese.\n\nIn the 1970s, there were two significant population movements—the exodus of most of the 4,000 Portuguese residents and the influx of several hundred Sao Tomean refugees from Angola. The islanders have been absorbed largely into a common Luso-African culture. Almost all belong to the Roman Catholic, Evangelical Protestant, or Seventh-day Adventist Churches, which in turn retain close ties with churches in Portugal.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe islands were first discovered by Portuguese navigators between 1469 and 1472. The first successful settlement of Sao Tome was established in 1493 by Alvaro Caminha, who received the land as a grant from the Portuguese crown. Principe was settled in 1500 under a similar arrangement. By the mid-1500s, with the help of slave labor, the Portuguese settlers had turned the islands into Africa's foremost exporter of sugar. Sao Tome and Principe were taken over and administered by the Portuguese crown in 1522 and 1573, respectively.\n\nSugar cultivation declined over the next 100 years, and by the mid-1600s, Sao Tome was little more than a port of call for bunkering ships. In the early 1800s, two new cash crops, coffee and cocoa, were introduced. The rich volcanic soils proved well suited to the new cash crop industry, and soon extensive plantations (rocas), owned by Portuguese companies or absentee landlords, occupied almost all of the good farmland. By 1908, Sao Tome had become the world's largest producer of cocoa, still the country's most important crop.\n\nThe rocas system, which gave the plantation managers a high degree of authority, led to abuses against the African farm workers. Although Portugal officially abolished slavery in 1876, the practice of forced paid labor continued. In the early 1900s, an internationally publicized controversy arose over charges that Angolan contract workers were being subjected to forced labor and unsatisfactory working conditions. Sporadic labor unrest and dissatisfaction continued well into the 20th century, culminating in an outbreak of riots in 1953 in which several hundred African laborers were killed in a clash with their Portuguese rulers. This \"Batepa Massacre\" remains a major event in the colonial history of the islands, and the government officially observes its anniversary.\n\nBy the late 1950s, when other emerging nations across the African Continent were demanding independence, a small group of Sao Tomeans had formed the Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP), which eventually established its base in nearby Gabon. Picking up momentum in the 1960s, events moved quickly after the overthrow of the Salazar and Caetano dictatorship in Portugal in April 1974. The new Portuguese regime was committed to the dissolution of its overseas colonies; in November 1974, their representatives met with the MLSTP in Algiers and worked out an agreement for the transfer of sovereignty. After a period of transitional government, Sao Tome and Principe achieved independence on July 12, 1975, choosing as its first president the MLSTP Secretary General, Manuel Pinto da Costa.\n\nIn 1990, Sao Tome became one of the first African countries to embrace democratic reform and changes to the constitution —the legalization of opposition political parties—led to elections in 1991 that were nonviolent, free, and transparent. Miguel Trovoada, a former prime minister who had been in exile since 1986, returned as an independent candidate and was elected president. Trovoada was re-elected in Sao Tome's second multiparty presidential election in 1996. The Party of Democratic Convergence (PCD) toppled the MLSTP to take a majority of seats in the National Assembly, with the MLSTP becoming an important and vocal minority party. Municipal elections followed in late 1992, in which the MLSTP came back to win a majority of seats on five of seven regional councils. In early legislative elections in October 1994, the MLSTP won a plurality of seats in the Assembly. It regained an outright majority of seats in the November 1998 elections. The Government of Sao Tome fully functions under a multiparty system. Presidential elections were held in July 2001. The candidate backed by the Independent Democratic Action Party, Fradique de Menezes, was elected in the first round and inaugurated on September 3. Parliamentary elections held in March 2002 led to a coalition government after no party gained a majority of seats.\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nFollowing the promulgation of a new constitution in 1990, Sao Tome and Principe held multiparty elections for the first time since independence. Shortly after the constitution took effect, the National Assembly formally legalized opposition parties. Independent candidates also were permitted to participate in the January 1991 legislative elections. The National Assembly is the supreme organ of the state and the highest legislative body. Its members are elected for a 4-year term and meet semiannually.\n\nThe president of the republic is elected to a 5-year term by direct universal suffrage and a secret ballot, and may hold up to two consecutive terms. Candidates are chosen at their party's national conference or individuals may run independently. A presidential candidate must obtain an outright majority of the popular vote in either a first or second round of voting in order to be elected president. The prime minister is named by the president but must be ratified by the majority party and thus normally comes from a list of its choosing. The prime minister, in turn, names the 14 members of the Cabinet. The National Assembly is made up of 55 members, all of whom must stand for reelection every 5 years.\n\nJustice is administered at the highest level by the Supreme Court. Formerly responsible to the National Assembly, the judiciary is now independent under the new constitution.\n\nAdministratively, the country is divided into seven municipal districts, six on Sao Tome and one comprising Principe. Governing councils in each district maintain a limited number of autonomous decision-making powers, and are reelected every 5 years.\n\nPrincipal Government Officials\n\nLast Updated: 7/7/03\n\nPresident: De Menezes, Fradique\n\nPrime Minister: das Neves, Maria Min. of Agriculture, Fishing, & Rural Development: da Silva, Julio Lopes Lima\n\nMin. of Defense: Danqua, Fernando, Maj.\n\nMin. of Education, & Culture: Pontifece, Fernanda Bonfim\n\nMin. of Foreign Affairs & Cooperation: Rita, Mateus Meira\n\nMin. of Health: Cruz, Claudina Augusto, Dr.\n\nMin. of Industry, Commerce, & Tourism: Dos Prazeres, Arzemiro\n\nMin. of Justice, State Reform, & Public Administration: Viegas, Justino Tavares\n\nMin. of Planning & Finance: Torres, Maria Santos Tebus\n\nMin. of Public Works, Infrastructure, Natural Resources, & Environment: Branco, Joaquim Rafael\n\nMin. of Youth, Sport, & Parliamentary Affairs: Viegas, Jose Santiago\n\nSec. of State for State Reforms & Public Administration: Pinto, Elsa Teixeira\n\nSec. of State for Environment, Territorial Security, & Nature Conservation: de Carvalho, Arlindo\n\nGovernor, Bank of Sao Tome & Principe:\n\nCharged'Affaires to the US: Ferreira, Domingos Augusto\n\nPermanent Representative to the UN, New York:,\n\nThe Sao Tome and Principe Mission to the United Nations, which also is the Sao Tomean Embassy to the United States, is located at 400, Park Avenue, 7th floor, New York, NY 10022 (tel. 212-317-0580; email [email protected]).\n\nPOLITICAL CONDITIONS\n\nSince the constitutional reforms of 1990 and the elections of 1991, Sao Tome has made great strides toward developing its democratic institutions and further guaranteeing the civil and human rights of its citizens. Sao Tomeans have freely changed their government through peaceful and transparent elections. And while there have been disagreements and political conflicts within the branches of government and the National Assembly, the debates have been carried out and resolved in open, democratic, and legal fora, in accordance with the provisions of Sao Tomean law. A number of political parties actively participate in government and openly express their views. Freedom of the press is respected, and there are several independent newspapers in addition to the government bulletin. The government's respect for human rights is exemplary; the government does not engage in repressive measures against its citizens, and respect for individuals' rights to due process and protection from government abuses is widely honored. Freedom of expression is accepted, and the government has taken no repressive measures to silence critics.\n\nECONOMY\n\nSince the 1800s, the economy of Sao Tome and Principe has been based on plantation agriculture. At the time of independence, Portuguese-owned plantations occupied 90% of the cultivated area. After independence, control of these plantations passed to various state-owned agricultural enterprises, which have since been privatized. The dominant crop on Sao Tome is cocoa, representing about 95% of exports. Other export crops include copra, palm kernels, and coffee.\n\nDomestic food-crop production is inadequate to meet local consumption, so the country imports some of its food. Efforts have been made by the government in recent years to expand food production, and several projects have been undertaken, largely financed by foreign donors.\n\nOther than agriculture, the main economic activities are fishing and a small industrial sector engaged in processing local agricultural products and producing a few basic consumer goods. The scenic islands have potential for tourism, and the government is attempting to improve its rudimentary tourist industry infrastructure. The government sector accounts for about 11% of employment.\n\nFollowing independence, the country had a centrally directed economy with most means of production owned and controlled by the state. The original constitution guaranteed a \"mixed economy,\" with privately owned cooperatives combined with publicly owned property and means of production. In the 1980s and 1990s, the economy of Sao Tome encountered major difficulties. Economic growth stagnated, and cocoa exports dropped in both value and volume, creating large balance-of-payments deficits. Efforts to redistribute plantation land resulted in decreased cocoa production. At the same time, the international price of cocoa slumped.\n\nIn response to its economic downturn, the government undertook a series of far-reaching economic reforms. In 1987, the government implemented an International Monetary Fund (IMF) structural adjustment program, and invited greater private participation in management of the parastatals, as well as in the agricultural, commercial, banking, and tourism sectors. The focus of economic reform since the early 1990s has been widespread privatization, especially of the state-run agricultural and industrial sectors.\n\nThe Sao Tomean Government has traditionally obtained foreign assistance from various donors, including the UN Development Program, the World Bank, the European Union, Portugal, Taiwan, and the African Development Bank. In April 2000, the IMF approved a poverty reduction and growth facility for Sao Tome aimed at reducing inflation to 3% for 2001, raising ideal growth to 4%, and reducing the fiscal deficit. In late 2000, Sao Tome qualified for significant debt reduction under the IMF-World Bank's heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. The reduction, which should take effect in 2004, should free additional resources for poverty reduction and public investment.\n\nIn 2001, Sao Tome and Nigeria reached agreement on joint exploration for petroleum in waters claimed by the two countries. After a lengthy series of negotiations, in April 2003 the joint development zone was opened for bids by international oil firms. Winners of the bidding round are expected to begin exploration in early 2004. Sao Tome stands to gain significant revenue both from the bidding process and from follow-on production, should reserves in the area match expectations.\n\nPortugal remains one of Sao Tome's major trading partners, particularly as a source of imports. Food, manufactured articles, machinery, and transportation equipment are imported primarily from the EU.\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\n\nUntil independence in 1975, Sao Tome and Principe had few ties abroad except those that passed through Portugal. Following independence, the new government sought to expand its diplomatic relationships. A common language, tradition, and colonial experience have led to close collaboration between Sao Tome and other ex-Portuguese colonies in Africa, particularly Angola. Sao Tomean relations with other African countries in the region, such as Gabon and the Republic of the Congo, also are good. In December 2000, Sao Tome signed the African Union treaty; the National Assembly later ratified it.\n\nThe Sao Tomean Government has generally maintained a foreign policy based on nonalignment and cooperation with any country willing to assist in its economic development. In recent years, it also has increasingly emphasized ties to the United States and western Europe.\n\nU.S.-SAO TOMEAN RELATIONS\n\nThe United States was among the first countries to accredit an ambassador to Sao Tome and Principe. The U.S. ambassador based in Gabon is accredited to Sao Tome on a non-resident basis. The ambassador and embassy staff make regular visits to the islands. The first Sao Tomean Ambassador to the United States, resident in New York City, was accredited in 1985. In 1986, Sao Tomean President da Costa visited the United States and met with then-Vice President Bush.\n\nU.S. relations with Sao Tome are excellent. In 1992, the Voice of America and the Government of Sao Tome signed a long-term agreement for the establishment of a relay transmitter station in Sao Tome; VOA currently broadcasts to much of Africa from this facility. The U.S. Government also maintains a number of smaller assistance programs in Sao Tome, administered through non-governmental organizations or the embassy in Libreville.\n\nPrincipal U.S. Embassy Officials\n\nLibreville, Gabon (E), Blvd. de la Mer • B.P. 4000; Tel IVG 587-0000 or [241] 76-20-03/04, After hours 74-34-92, 72-12-41, Fax: 74-55-07; Direct Lines: EXEC 74-34-93, GSO 73-31-88, PC 73-33-33; EXEC Fax: 77-37-39, CON Fax: 76-88-49, GSO Fax 73-98-74, PC Fax: 73-84-70.

Bruce Barr\n\nLast Modified: Monday, December 15, 2003\n\nTRAVEL\n\nConsular Information Sheet\n\nJuly 18, 2003\n\nCountry Description: Sao Tome and Principe is a developing nation, comprising the islands of Sao Tome and Principe, located off the west coast of Africa. Facilities for tourism are limited, but adequate.\n\nEntry and Exit Requirements: A passport, visa and evidence of yellow fever vaccination are required for entry. Visas must be obtained in advance. Travelers should obtain the latest information and details from the Permanent Mission of Sao Tome and Principe, 400 Park Ave., 7th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10022, telephone (212) 317-0533, fax (212) 935-7348. Overseas, inquiries should be made at the nearest Sao Tomean embassy or consulate.\n\nIn an effort to prevent international child abduction, many governments have initiated procedures at entry/exit points. These often include requiring documentary evidence of relationship and permission for the child's travel from the parent(s) or legal guardian not present. Having such documentation on hand, even if not required, may facilitate entry/departure.\n\nSafety and Security: U.S. citizens should maintain security awareness at all times. Recent civil unrest in the capital city mandates a cautious attitude. Large gatherings or any other events where crowds have congregated to demonstrate or protest should be avoided. In instances where such actions occur, American citizens may contact the U.S. Embassy in Gabon for the most up-to-date information. Taking photographs of military or government buildings is strictly forbidden.\n\nThe Embassy informs the registered resident American community of security matters through a warden system (Please see the U.S. Government Representation section below for more information.).\n\nCrime: Crimes such as burglary, pick-pocketing and armed robbery do occur on the islands. Such crimes can occur anywhere, but are more prevalent in public places, such as in markets, on the streets, or near hotels. Do not display large amounts of cash in public. If possible, leave valuables and extra cash at your hotel while sightseeing or visiting the beach.\n\nThe loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately to local police and to the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate, which is in Libreville, Gabon. If you are the victim of a crime while overseas, in addition to reporting to local police, please contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate for assistance. The Embassy/Consulate staff can, for example, assist you to find appropriate medical care, to contact family members or friends and explain how funds could be transferred. Although the investigation and prosecution of the crime is solely the responsibility of local authorities, consular officers can help you to understand the local criminal justice process and to find an attorney if needed.\n\nU.S. citizens may refer to the Department of State's pamphlets A Safe Trip Abroad and Tips for Travelers to Sub-Saharan Africa, for ways to promote a trouble free journey. The pamphlets are available by mail from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402 or via the Internet at http://www.gpoaccess.gov/index.html, or via the Bureau of Consular Affairs home page at http://travel.state.gov.\n\nMedical Facilities: Medical facilities in Sao Tome and Principe are extremely limited. There is one hospital in the country, on the island of Sao Tome, and several clinics. However, the level of care is low. For all but minor medical needs, it is necessary to travel to Libreville, Gabon or Lisbon, Portugal. Additionally, some medicines are not available; travelers should carry, properly labeled required medicines and medications with them.\n\nMedical Insurance: The Department of State strongly urges Americans to consult with their medical insurance company prior to traveling abroad to confirm whether their policy applies overseas and whether it will cover emergency expenses such as a medical evacuation. U.S. medical insurance plans seldom cover health costs incurred outside the United States unless supplemental coverage is purchased. Further, U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs do not provide payment for medical services outside the United States. However, many travel agents and private companies offer insurance plans that will cover health care expenses incurred overseas including emergency services such as medical evacuations.\n\nWhen making a decision regarding health insurance, Americans should consider that many foreign doctors and hospitals require payment in cash prior to providing service and that a medical evacuation to the U.S. may cost well in excess of 50,000 dollars (US). Uninsured travelers who require medical care overseas often face extreme difficulties. When consulting with your insurer prior to your trip, ascertain whether payment will be made to the overseas healthcare provider or whether you will be reimbursed later for expenses you incur. Some insurance policies also include coverage for psychiatric treatment and for disposition of remains in the event of death.\n\nUseful information on medical emergencies abroad, including overseas insurance programs, is provided in the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs brochure, Medical Information for Americans Traveling Abroad, available via the Bureau of Consular Affairs home page or autofax: (202) 647-3000.\n\nOther Health Information: Malaria is endemic in Sao Tome and Principe. P. falciparum malaria, the serious and sometimes fatal strain found in many parts of Central Africa, including Sao Tome and Principe, is resistant to the anti-malarial drug chloroquine. Because travelers to Sao Tome and Principe are at high risk for contracting malaria, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise that travelers should take one of the following antimalarial drugs: mefloquine (Lariam™), doxycycline, or atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone™). The CDC has determined that a traveler who is on an appropriate antimalarial drug has a greatly reduced chance of contracting the disease. In addition, other personal protective measures, such as the use of insect repellents, help to reduce malaria risk. Travelers who become ill with a fever or flu-like illness while traveling in a malaria-risk area and up to one year after returning home should seek prompt medical attention and tell the physician their travel history and what antimalarials they have been taking. For additional information on malaria, protection from insect bites, and antimalarials, please visit the CDC travelers' health website at http://www.cdc.gov/travel/malaria.\n\nFurther information on vaccinations and other health precautions, such as safe food and water precautions and insect bite protection, may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's hotline for international travelers at telephone 1-877-FYI-TRIP (1-877-394-8747); fax 1-888-CDC-FAXX (1-888-232-3299), or via the CDC's travelers' Internet website at http://www.cdc.gov.\n\nTraffic Safety and Road Conditions: While in a foreign country, U.S. citizens may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below concerning Sao Tome and Principe is provided for general reference only and may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance:\n\nSafety of Public Transportation: Public transportation is not available\n\nUrban Road Conditions/Maintenance: Fair\n\nRural Road Conditions/Maintenance: Poor\n\nAvailability of Roadside Assistance: Non-existent\n\nStreets in the city of Sao Tome are paved, but large potholes are common. Major roads outside of town are also paved, and are less worn. Pedestrians and animals on the roads can be a major obstacle. There is no street lighting outside the capital. Some roads may be impassable without a four-wheel-drive vehicle.\n\nOnly a few miles of paved roads exist on the island of Principe and their conditions are similar to those in Sao Tome.\n\nFor additional general information about road safety, including links to foreign government sites, see the Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, home page at http://travel.state.gov/road_safety.html.\n\nAviation Safety Oversight: As there is no direct commercial air service between the United States and Sao Tome and Principe by local carriers at present, nor economic authority to operate such service, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Sao Tome and Principe's Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international aviation safety standards.\n\nFor further information, travelers may contact the Department of Transportation within the U.S. at 1-800-322-7873, or visit the FAA's Internet website at http://www.faa.gov/avr/iasa. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) separately assesses some foreign air carriers for suitability as official providers of air services. For information regarding the DOD policy on specific carriers, travelers may contact DOD at (618) 229-4801.\n\nCriminal Penalties: While in a foreign country, a U.S. citizen is subject to that country's laws and regulations, which sometimes differ significantly from those in the United States and may not afford the protections available to the individual under U.S. law. Penalties for breaking the law can be more severe than in the United States for similar offenses. Persons violating Sao Tome and Principe's laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested or imprisoned. Penalties for possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs in Sao Tome and Principe are strict and convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.\n\nCurrency Information: Credit cards are accepted only at a few major hotels. Travelers' checks can be cashed at hotels and at one private bank in Sao Tome city, but transaction fees can be high. U.S. dollars are widely accepted at tourist establishments.\n\nChildren's Issues: For information on international adoption of children and international parental child abduction, please refer to our Internet site at http://travel.state.gov/children's_issues.html or telephone 202-736-7000."
