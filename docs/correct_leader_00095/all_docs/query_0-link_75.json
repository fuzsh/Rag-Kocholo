        "text": "By Marie-Eve Bouchard\n\nThis dissertation focuses on the variety of Portuguese spoken in São Tomé, the capital of São Tomé and Príncipe, and its surroundings. From the sixteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, Forro, Angolar, and Lung’ie (three native creoles) were the most widely spoken languages on the islands. However, the massive arrivals of contract laborers starting at the end of the nineteethn century, and the use of Portuguese as a lingua franca completely changed the sociolinguistic setting. As a consequence, a process of linguistic shift (from creoles to Portuguese) started to take place. This shift was intensified from the 1960s, with the rise of the nationalist movement, the independence of the country (in 1975), and the generalized access to education. Since then, children have been growing up with the local variety of Portuguese as their first (and often only) language. The objective of this research, therefore, is to investigate the emergence of a Santomean variety of Portuguese, with special reference to rhotics and subject pronoun expression (SPE), and to explore the differences between Santomean Portuguese and other varieties of Portuguese. In a larger context, I am also interested in understanding the social and ideological phenomena that explain the linguistic choices, linguistic change, and language shift in São Tomé and Príncipe. The study is based on 15 months of ethnographic fieldwork and sociolinguistic interviews with fifty-six native speakers of Santomean Portuguese, aged between 12 and 73 years old, who were born and raised in the capital of São Tomé and its surroundings. The results of the study show that the use of the rhotics is an innovative and distinctive feature of Santomean Portuguese. Some Santomeans use the strong-R (the historical trill) in word positions that would be considered non-standard to European and Brazilian norms. This reflects a change in progress led by the younger generations. Within the strong-R category, the rhotic fricative has emerged as a variant that clearly distinguishes two generations, Santomeans over forty years old and those under 39. This dividing point also marks the year of the independence of the country, a milestone in the history of São Tomé and Príncipe and the formation of its national identity. This suggests that fricative rhotics are a marker of Santomean identity. Surprisingly, however, the ideologies that surround this use of the rhotics are highly pejorative. Regarding SPE, less social significance is attached to this feature. One reason for this might be the fact that it is a feature that has maintained a usage that is similar to European Portuguese. My results show that most of the linguistic constraints on SPE in Santomean Portuguese are similar to those of studies of other Portuguese varieties. The one element that differs from previous studies is social: highly educated people favor the use of overt subjects, while in European Portuguese null subjects are highly favored, and usually used more by educated speakers. I believe that this study of rhotics and SPE captures the nature of Santomean Portuguese: it reflects a combination of creole influences, linguistic conservatism, and innovation. Indeed, the history of the islands is reflected in its languages: the creole influence that relates to the African origin of Santomean Portuguese, conservatisms from European Portuguese that recall the colonial society that endured for 500 years, and innovations that mark development of São Tomé as an independent nation....Read more\n\nRelated Papers\n\nForum , 2022\n\nThis paper provides a linguistic overview of the history and current status of Santomean and Princepean Portuguese (PST and PP). The rise of these varieties in Sao Tome and Principe dates back to their colonial origins in a multilingual environment, as well as to their development into Second Language of indigenous people — later nativized as mother language by their offspring. Besides, based on data collected in situ, this paper presents a brief synchronic overview of some phonological features of these varieties, focusing on phonological phenomena such as nasalization, rhotic variation, vocalization and segmental deletion, which are recurrent in PST and in PP. The analysis of historical, social, and linguistic factors allows us to conclude that the development of local varieties is evident in STP. Despite the lack of robust linguistic description and systematization, PST and PP are endowed with identity linguistic traits.\n\nDownload\n\nAlthough the Santiago variety of Cape Verdean Creole (CVC) has been the subject of numerous linguistic works, the second major variety of the language, i.e. the São Vicente variety of CVC (CVSV), has hardly been described. Nevertheless this lack of studies and given its striking differences, on all linguistic levels, from the variety of Santiago (CVST), the implicit explanation for such divergences, echoed for decades in the literature on CVC, has been the presumably decreolized character of CVSV. First, this study provides a comprehensive fieldwork-based synchronic description of CVSV major morpho-syntactic categories in the intent to document the variety. Second, it aims to place the study of CVSV within a broader scope of contact linguistics in the quest to explain its structure. Based on analyses of historical documents and studies, it reconstructs the sociohistorical scenario of the emergence and development of CVSV in the period of 1797-1975. From the comparison of the current structures of CVSV and CVST, the examination of linguistic data in historical texts and the analysis of sociohistorical facts it becomes clear that the contemporary structure of CVSV stems from the contact-induced changes that occurred during the intensive language and dialect contact on the island of São Vicente in the early days of its settlement in the late 18th and ensuing early 19th century development, rather than from modern day pressure of Portuguese. Although this dissertation argues for multiple explanations rather than a single theory, by showing that processes such as languages shift among the first Portuguese settlers, L2 acquisition, migration of the Barlavento speakers and subsequent dialect leveling as well as language borrowing at a later stage were at stake, it demonstrates the usefulness of partial-restructuring model proposed by Holm (2004).\n\nDownload\n\nJournal of Pidgin and Creoles Languages, 2019\n\nDownload\n\nIssues in Hispanic and Lusophone Linguistics, 2018\n\nDownload\n\nRevista Diadorim\n\nThis paper describes how the Portuguese language came to be widely spoken in the Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe and demonstrates how the spread of Portuguese language can be associated with the endangerment of other languages in the archipelago. A country that has been multilingual since its formation has moved towards monolingualism, marginalizing native languages or pushing them into obsolescence in the process. Based on a literature review, we suggest that the spread of Portuguese and its consolidation as the dominant language are associated with a complex socio-historical process, including urbanization, mass schooling, media and the desire of local elites to remain connected to an imperial language and the benefits of such a connection. The choice of the ruling elite to adopt Portuguese as the official language in the young republic in 1975 effectively created the mechanisms for the diffusion of Portuguese and set the stage for the endangerment of other local languages.\n\nDownload\n\nDiadorim, 2019\n\nThis paper looks at the role of African, Amerindian, and Portuguese peoples in shaping and spreading the Portuguese language in Brazil from an interdisciplinary approach. Drawing from secondary and primary sources-such as Antônio da Costa Peixoto's New Book of the Mina General Language (1741) and Friar Cannecattim's Dictionary of the Bunda or Angolan Language (1804)-it explores the interplay between language, power, and identity to historicise the process by which Portuguese became the primary language in Brazil, despite its multilingual landscape. In doing so, it challenges the idea that the spread of Portuguese and language shift was always a conscious product of the Portuguese Crown and a result of open violent imposition. On the contrary, the spread and consolidation of Portuguese deeply depended on the missionaries, the population, and symbolic colonial practices. Additionally, the fact that Portuguese prevailed as the main language spoken in Brazil has not precluded it from being profoundly intertwined with Amerindian and African languages. Such languages formed a multilingual society, being largely responsible for the differentiation between European and Brazilian Portuguese.\n\nDownload\n\nBecoming Monolingual, 2019\n\nThis article discusses the loss of the creole languages on São Tomé Island and the societal move from multilingualism to monolingualism in Portuguese. It argues that recognizing the ideologies attached to these languages is key in understanding the language shift, but also the processes leading toward monolingualism. This qualitative study is based on three main theories: Language as social practice, language ideology, and monoglot standardization. Data comes from ethnographic fieldwork and sociolinguistic interviews with 56 speakers from the capital of São Tomé and Príncipe. I argue that the existence of multilingualism on São Tomé Island is not valued at a societal level because of the pejorative ideologies that have been held about the creole languages since colonial times. Also, the use of the creole languages stood as a problem for the creation of a unified Santomean nation, as the different racial groups on the islands had their own creole. Results show how ideologies about the Portuguese language and its association with national unity, modernity, and European-ness favored its expansion on São Tomé Island and a move toward monolingualism.\n\nDownload"
