        "text": "Plants at the Beach-San Onofre\n\nBoy, was I excited to finally go to the beach on May 24, 2020? Is anyone else happy to get out of their houses, too? I was so pleased to go to San Onofre State Beach twice a week. Because of the lockdown in California, I could not witness the beginning of the wildflower season. So my main objective on this first day back to the beach was to see as many plants as possible! The first time we headed to Trestles, and the following Friday, I explored the southern section, just under San Onofre Campground at Bluffs Beach (or Trails Beach). Below, I would love to share with you what I saw- all the plants at the beach I encountered.\n\nPrevious to this beach adventure, I had just finished a post on Southern California Native Plants. This post has documented all the plants and wildflowers I encountered in the scrub and Southern Oak Woodland behind my neighborhood during Lock-Down in 2020. After hours and hours of research, I sure learned a tremendous amount!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nPlant Names Given by San Diego Native Inhabitants\n\nI have recently been fascinated with Native American uses of the native plants in the area (Ethnobotany), so I thought I would continue with the same format I followed for my previous native plant post.\n\nThe Kumeyaay people were the first known original inhabitants of San Diego, with meyaay translating to ‘those who face the water from a cliff.” (Click on the link to hear the correct way to pronounce Kumeyaay)\n\nIn this post, all plants are separated at the Family level. I will keep things simple by only providing alternative names and the native Kumeyaay name if available. If you would like a more in-depth look at each Family, please click on the link above.\n\nIf any Southern California tribe traditionally utilizes the plant (in the past or present), it will be included.\n\nFor fun, I will also be adding any plants that have been photographed here throughout the year 2020. (I came seven times in one year!)\n\nThough there are many non-native plants at San Onofre State Beach, I have decided to showcase native plants.\n\n#Click on any photo to see a larger version\n\nSan Onofre State Beach Native Plants\n\nSan Onofre State Beach is located in North County, San Diego, bordering Orange County to the north and Marine Base Camp Pendleton to the east and south. Noted above, I explored the northern section (Trestles) and the southern section of the park (San Onofre Bluffs Beach)- over three miles total.\n\nI love San Onofre State Beach.
