The Amatanthaceae family has been divided into Amaranthoideae subfamily, for amaranths, and Chenopodiodeae subfamily, for the chenopods.\n\naWormwood family discrepancies, may belong to Asteraceae.\n\nbCelery/Angelica family discrepancies, may belong to Apiaceae.\n\nBotanical Definitions\n\nVegetable\n\nThis is any edible part of a plant, and in my opinion excludes the fruiting part (the seed containing structures). Vegetables therefore are stems, leaves, flowers, roots, bulbs and tubers.\n\nStem vegetables include: Celery, kohl rabi, asparagus\n\nLeaves: Lettuce, cabbage, spinach\n\nFlowers: Broccoli, cauliflower\n\nRoots: Beet, carrots, parsnip, radish, turnip, swede, salsify\n\nTubers: Potato, yam, sweet potato, yaro\n\nBulbs: Onions, garlic\n\nHerbs\n\nHerbs are soft plants that do not form permanent woody tissue and may be annual, biennial or perennial. Some herbs are trees, however most are shrubby plants. The term ‘herb’ applies mostly to plants with some medicinal or culinary property.\n\nFruits\n\nThe botanical definition of a fruit is the mature ovary of a flower that contains seeds. The fleshy part of the fruit may be soft or dry. Therefore, fruits can be apples, pears or mangoes with which we are all familiar, but fruits also include tomatoes, cucumber, beans, squash and eggplant.\n\nAs with everything in life fruits can be differentiated into various fruit types, based upon the number of ovaries and overall fruit structure:\n\nA quick look at fruits\n\nSimple Compound Dry Fleshy Multiple Aggregate Dehiscent – pea Drupes – plum Accessory – strawberry Syconium – fig Indehiscent – wall nut Berry – redcurrant Balausta – pomegranate Sorosis – mulberry Pome – apple\n\nSimple fruits\n\nFruit develops from a single/compound ovary of a single flower often with a single seed. These include dry and fleshy fruits. Dry fruits are further classified into dehiscent (split upon ripening) and indehiscent (do not split upon ripening).\n\nFleshy simple fruit include; drupes, berries (hesperidium, pepo) and pomes.\n\nDrupes: ‘Stone fruit’, contains hard inedible pips – plum, cherry, peach, apricot, olive\n\nBerries: ‘Soft fruit’ containing many seeds in one fruit – redcurrant, gooseberry, tomato, cranberry, pepper, eggplant\n\n~ Hesperidium: Berry with a leathery rind and segmented fruit pulp, i.e., all citrus\n\n~ Pepo: Berry with watery flesh and flat seeds – Cucurbit/gourd family (squash, cucumber, melon, pumpkin, watermelon)\n\nPomes: The fruits from the Rosaceae family that develop from a half-inferior ovary – apples, pears, rosehips, saskatoon berry\n\nDry simple fruits include; dehiscent (follicle, legume, silique, capsule) and indehiscent (samara, achene, caryopsis, nut).\n\nDehiscent: Ovary splits upon maturing\n\n~ Follicle: Pod formed from a single carpel and splits on one side – milkweed, peony, magnolia\n\n~ Legume: Pod from a leguminous plant (fixes own nitrogen for growth) – pea, bean, soya, peanut\n\n~ Silique: Long pods from the mustard family and splits from both sides – fruits/seeds of the cabbage family (not the cabbage/leafy part we eat!)\n\n~ Capsule: Pod formed from two carpels – brazil nut, horse chestnut, poppy\n\nIndehiscent: Ovary does not split upon maturing\n\n~ Samara: Single seeded fruit with a flat and fibrous winged structure has formed over the ovary, to be carried by the wind – sycamore, elm seeds\n\n~ Achene: Single seeded fruit – buckwheat, buttercup\n\n~ Caryopsis: Single seeded fruit where the pericarp is fused to the seed – cereals, grass seeds\n\n~ Nut: Hard fruit or shell encasing the seed – acorn, hazelnut, wall nut\n\nCompound Fruits\n\nFruit develops from multiple ovaries. Two categories of compound fruit exist – aggregate and multiple fruits\n\nMultiple: Coalesced ovaries of an entire interflorescence (the flowering structure)\n\n~ Accessory: Fruit not formed from the ovary, but from an exterior nonovarian tissue, such as the receptacle, which forms the base of the flower stem – strawberry\n\n~ Balausta: Old term for the fruits of the pomegranate – it is now known as a ‘Hyp’, a multiple of drupes\n\nAggregate: Many ovaries attached to a single receptacle forming fruitlets\n\n~ Syconium: ‘Receptacle fruit’, flowers/fruit and seeds form within the stem/receptacle. Each fig has its own specialist fig wasp for pollination, fig and wasp are dependent on each other and co-evolve together – Ficus family, figs\n\n~ Sorosis: The fruit is formed by the consolidation of many ovaries – mulberry\n\nThis is a simple guide; as many fruits fall into multiple categories and some are further differentiated in the main categories.
