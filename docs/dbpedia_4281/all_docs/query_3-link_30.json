        "text": "Hello all, I was on the CF early Sept to early Oct, and just wanted to start a thread about the wealth of medicinal plants, aka \"weeds\" I found along the way. As a long time plant medicine student and lately teacher, I was thrilled to see the wealth along the way. I KNOW this is a thread that hasn't been touched on much, because believe you me, I looked and looked before I left...\n\nI carried a wide mouth glass water bottle, and added things along the way, which, with all the sloshing and warm sun, made a nice beneficial tea.\n\nHere are some personal plant favorites from the camino ditches and roadsides! My dearest wish is that many of you add experiences and knowledge to this thread and we can ethically and sustainably pick a few of these ubiquitous weeds, or just know they are they and give them a smile and a thank you as you walk by.\n\nStinging nettle. Careful how you pick it, (it can sting your fingers) but this is one of the best tonic and nourishing teas, good for over-all system health, esp kidneys, immune system.\n\nSt. John's Wort (or, as we like to say in midwifery circles, St. Joan's Wort). Still blooming in October here and there!! Flowers have red hypericum oil, good for mood elevation, also great for muscle pain and soreness!\n\nRose hips: all along the way in the fall: crush and add to water for Vit C, immunity booster\n\nWild fennel: Good for digestion (gas), helps respiratory system, cleans palate, also expands the mind?!\n\nDandelion: Not enough good things can be said about this eurasian native. Systemic tonic, great for liver health, and just about anything that ails you. ID real dandelion by the smooth leaves, hollow stem, and little \"skirt\" under the flower bud.\n\nDandelion look alikes: Groundsel: Tons along the trail all 500 miles! What a versatile survivor in all places from the meseta to the mountains! Groundsel, hawkbit, etc. etc. None of it will hurt you, it is all tonic and good to pop in your water bottle.\n\nTeasel: Another hardy and widespread trail companion. Chinese herbalists loved it for kidney health, which means it is a good blood purifier, and the root is good for GUESS WHAT? pain and stiffness in knees, joints, sinews etc.\n\nI'll stop there for now, but this is the tip of the iceberg, I assure you! It is clear to me, after years of loving/studying plants, that they are allies that GROW WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED by their human friends.\n\nWe are all in this together, even the plants love us and want to help!\n\nMendi:\n\nDef would not be involved in picking any plant protected by law. Def def def. I have total respect for the laws of the countries I am visiting. I am very glad to hear there are resources out there to tell you what these laws are, regionally and specifically. So glad you brought up this topic!\n\nI do doubt, however, that there are laws forbidding the pinching off of a few flowers/leaves/seeds of dandelion, fennel, dock, plantain or nettle (some of the most beneficial and ubiquitous \"weeds\" out there).\n\nBut if there are laws against doing this, you can bet I wont be doin it!\n\nTo quote Falcon: \"Each of the 17 Autonomous Regions of Spain has its own Red Book on protected species, so you have a lot of places to research! The protection is generally for the habitat, not the individual plant. That is, developers cannot obliterate a habitat for a protected specie, but it is OK to pluck a branch (with about 5 exceptions for truly rare plants, most of which are in State parks).\"\n\nYou can bet I'll be accessing that Red Book on any return trips I make, so I can be in compliance. And will def NOT be messing with the rare and endangered (which is an issue everywhere for plant medicine practitioners).\n\nSome rare and endangered plants which I saw, and of course left entirely alone, along the Camino were: echinacea (one of our natives here in the US that we \"gave\" to Europe), larkspur, aconitum (a thrilling find, but even touching it can make you a little...crazy). I also would never pick wild bulbs, like the little crocuses we saw all along the way (tho I might, if moved, gently touch a finger into the center of one for a taste of the gold!). Also: any orchids, of course. Did not spy even one of the lovely Spanish Bee Orchids, pictured here, but needless to say, wouldn't harm a hair on their heads!\n\nAlso, any plants that look stressed, occur uncommonly or are off the trail, should be left alone. If you aren't sure, leave alone.\n\nAttachments\n\nFriburgensis-opt.jpg\n\n\"For Peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands the Atlas y Libro Rojo de la\n\nFlora Vascular Amenazada de España (BAÑARES et al., 2003, Atlas in the text)\n\nlists 20 extinct, 157 critically endangered and 95 endangered taxa (species and\n\nsubspecies), which are protected at the national level. Each Spanish\n\nAutonomous Region, of which there are 17 in the country, has its own Red\n\nBook and a series of species protected by law. I will only refer to the two\n\nPeninsular Communities which include in their territory Western Mediterranean\n\nIslands, and to the Balearic Community whose territory covers the\n\nBalearic Islands.\"\n\n\"Do all plants have the same conservation value?\n\nAnother issue that is not explicitly addressed in the lists and red books is the importance (absolute value) of the plants to be protected. This is something that needs a more scientific basis than simply the anthropocentric value of plants (for their nutritional, pharmaceutical, and ritual uses, etc.). Thus the classification (systematics) of plants is the best starting point for this purpose. When we talk of taxa we usually refer to species and subspecies, as reflected in the preceding paragraphs. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that genera, families and higher categories are also taxa.\n\nAlthough they are all taxa, it seems clear that loss of a genus through extinction is more serious than the loss of a subspecies. That is to say, a genus that is threatened because very few populations remain of its sole species should receive priority over other lower taxa. In Spain there are not many higher taxa as the only family endemic to Spain’s latitudes (Aphyllanthaceae) is distributed throughout the Mediterranean.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value of higher taxa is the fundamental argument being addressed by the Fundación General CSIC Proyectos Cero project whose title asks the question “Do all endangered species the same value?” (“¿Tienen todas las especies amenazadas el mismo valor? Origen y conservación de fósiles vivientes de plantas con flores endémicas en España”).\"\n\n\"Study of the “big five”\n\nJust as the term “big five” is applied to all five species of big game (lion, leopard, rhino, buffalo and elephant) that were hardest to capture in South Africa, we have adopted the metaphor for the five critically endangered species in the “biggest” taxonomic range (genera). The most up-to-date conservation techniques and methodologies available will be applied to the population of the big “five genera” to promote their conservation.\n\n\"Avellar fistulosa\n\nPerennial plant of the Asteraceae family now reduced in Spain to a single population in Doñana National Park (Seville). Another population located in Cadiz (Chiclana) has not been located since 1927. Four popu-\n\nlations are known in Portugal. No phylogenetic studies have been carried out on this species, but it is expected to be very close to the genus Scorzonera.\n\n\"Castrilanthemum debeauxii\n\nPopulations of this annual member of the Asteraceae family have been found in the mountains near Castril (Jaén), Guillimona (Granada) and Cabrillo (Jaén). However, only the population in Sierra de Guillimona has appeared several years in a row this decade. It would seem to fulfil all three requirements for it to be considered a living fossil because, apart from its taxonomic and geographical isolation, a preliminary phylogeny indicates that it forms a sister group with two genera (Leucanthemopsis, Prolongoa) containing about ten species (see picture).\n\n\"Gyrocaryum oppositifolium\n\nThis is another annual plant appearing capriciously in the spring, and it was discovered in large numbers in the town of Constantina near Seville, but has not been seen there again since 1982. Later, in 1994, it was discovered another town in Leon (Ponferrada) and again in Madrid (Cadalso de los Vidrios) in 2000. The only population that has been followed for a number of years is that of Leon since the Madrid population only appears in some benign years (for example, 2000 and 2005). It has been classified as belonging to the extensive Boraginaceas family, although its specific systematic position within one of its taxonomic tribes remains uncertain. While we have been able to include this species in a phylogeny of the family to which it belongs (Boraginaceae), lack of neighbouring genera that have been studied makes it impossible to know what position it occupies on the evolutionary tree.\n\n\"Naufraga balearica\n\n\"This perennial plant belonging to the Umbelliferae family can only be found in three populations in north-eastern Majorca. In 1981 a population was discovered in Corsica, but has not subsequently returned. Its position on the evolutionary tree has been studied in three previous phylogenies. However, limited sampling of species from other genera, especially of celery (Apium spp.) makes it impossible to know if this is a case of a true living fossil (see picture).\n\n\"Pseudomisopates\n\n\"This plant, belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family, has undoubtedly been studied more closely than the others thanks to a member of our team (Elena Amat) devoting her thesis to it. It is now known to occur in various parts of the Sierra de Gredos (Avila), with plants, distributed in two population centres in the Serrota and the Gredos mountains, both in Ávila (see picture), where it propagates by sending out long runners.\n\n\"The latest findings indicate that the sister genus (Acanthorrhinum) which also consists of a single species, is distributed throughout the Atlas mountains in Morocco. It therefore fails to meet the phylogenetic criteria and should not be considered a living fossil. However, the question remains whether the separation between the two genera is old enough for the absolute phylogenetic criterion to be applicable. That is, the question is whether these are two ancient lineages resulting from a separation before the Mediterranean climate became established.\"\n\nDon't make a tea of the \"big five\"!!"
