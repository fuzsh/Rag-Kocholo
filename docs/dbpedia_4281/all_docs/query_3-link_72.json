        "text": "Dear members,\n\nIn late December I noticed an unusual weed growing in a field (34 / 02/ 43 N , 74/ 48/30 E ) in Srinagar. I misidentified it and posted it on efi website as stoneseed (Lithospermum arvense). Garg ji pointed out that it was not Lithospermum arvense and suggested that it was N.edgeworthii. As N.edgeworthii had never before been reported from the Kashmir valley I carefully reexamined the herb and after examining all the features have come to the conclusion that it is a novel species of the Boraginaceae family which has never before been reported from the Kashmir Valley. Indeed I suggested it could be named Apononea bagathii (Apo is \"away from\" and Bagath is the locality where it was found. The entire discussion can be viewed at: https://groups.google.com/g/indiantreepix/c/XNgmai55Uao/m/8p1ruFTZAAAJ?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer\n\nAlthough its habit very closely resembles N.edgeworthii and like N.edgeworthii its stamens are situated just below the throat in the corolla tube attached with very short filaments and the style is very short and included and the shape and morphology of its nutlets is very similar to that found in the genus Nonea yet it differs in having a polysepalous calyx while the calyx of the members of the genus Nonea Medik is invariably gamosepalous. The presence of a polysepalous calyx leaves us no option but to put it in a separate genus. Some other ways in which it differs from N.edgeworthii are given below:\n\n1. Nutlet does not have longitudinal denticulations\n\n2.The bottom of the corolla tube is sinuous and not straight\n\n3.It is not an annual as the plant which I transferred to a planter in late December is still thriving and seems to enjoy the subzero temperatures of( -5 C)-(-6 C) prevailing at present in Srinagar. This suggests that its real habitat might be alpine. The hairs might be having some natural antifreeze.\n\n4. Its carrot like root also suggests that it might be a perennial.\n\nFor the above reasons I am posting it as a new thread. Over the next few days I will repost the photos and other data with this thread in which I hope to include a short review of existing members of Boraginaceae reported from the valley till now.\n\nAs Avery said in a letter to his brother “It is a lot of fun to blow bubbles but it is better to prick them yourself.” So I would request the members to prick this bubble and suggest a plausible ID for this herb.\n\nWith regards\n\nTaffazull\n\n2"
