        "text": "Abstract\n\nHeliotropium curassavicum L., 1753 belongs to the Boraginaceae family, and it was recorded for the first time to the Flora of Iraq in Basrah Province, Iraq. Its morphological characteristics have been described with photos; as well as a taxonomical key has been suggested to separate it from other species of Heliotropium that grow in Basrah Province. The geographical distribution of the species was determined, and the results showed that it was grown in five different locations along the southern parts of Shatt Al-Arab. Pollen morphology and anatomy of leaves were studied by using light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which showed that the species has psilate and hexa-heterocolpate pollen grains, and the leaves were glabrous with anomocytic and hemiparacytic stomata."
