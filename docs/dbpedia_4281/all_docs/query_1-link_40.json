        "text": "Because the one-sided spikes of its fragrant flowers always seemed to turn toward the sun, the heliotrope got its name from the Greek words helios, meaning “sun,” and tropos, meaning “turn.” Wild species of these hairy, many-branched herbs and shrubs are found in many parts of the world. Some species are cultivated in greenhouses and gardens, others are weedy plants. They grow from 1 to 4 feet (0.3 to 1.2 meters) high, with flowers varying in color from blue and purple to pink and even white.\n\nThe heliotrope is a genus (Heliotropium) of the borage family, Boraginaceae. There are about 250 species. The garden, or cherry-pie, heliotrope (H. arborescens) is the most common. The alternate leaves are lance-shaped, and the tiny flowers grow in clustered, five-lobed sprays. A species common in the alkaline and saline areas of the United States is the seaside heliotrope (H. curassavicum)."
