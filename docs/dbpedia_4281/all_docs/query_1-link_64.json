        "text": "Hemlock\n\nHemlock in Kit Carson park, Escondido\n\nAh, the famous plant that was used to kill Socrates. Hemlock plant belongs to apiaceae (or umbelliferae) family. Also known as carrot or parsley family. Umbelliferae means \"umbrella\" because the majority of species form clusters of small flowers that look like little umbrella. The thing about this family is that lots of species do indeed have family resemblance and it mights be difficult to tell one specie from another. What adds to confusion is the fact that lots of them are edible while others are poisonous. Hemlock is the example of the latter.\n\nHemlock flowers\n\nThe plant that resembles hemlock the most is wild carrot (also known as Queen Ann's lace or Daucus carota). Unfortunately I don't have a picture of the latter for comparison. Actually I have not seen that many hemlocks around but there was one patch where it was flourishing together with other bunch of plants.\n\nHemlock leaves\n\nRemember that hemlock is highly poisonous and even a little dose might kill you. Be very careful and make sure to identify any plant of the carrot family correctly as lots of them are very good medicinal plants, for instance angelica or spices like coriander.\n\nThere are actually two genera commonly known as hemlock: Conium that is discussed in this article and Cicuta (water hemlock). Both are highly poisonous, Cicuta is even more deadly than Conium.\n\nCurly Dock\n\nCurly dock in Felicita park (historic photograph)\n\nCurly dock is a great plant. Not only does it grow wild in commons and wastelands but it is also an edible plant and quite tasty at that. Just saute it with onions and tomatoes.\n\nSo we found some good looking curly dock in Felicita park when we first came. We harvested some leaves (always leaving the majority of the plant intact). The same common or meadow had sweet alyssum and nettle growing there as well. So you could get on a foraging expedition and be in and out in no time.\n\nBut something terrible happened. They (the park authorities) decided to use this common for the parking lot. They have not paved it but they destroyed all the plants. Curly dock was the first one to go. Then nettle, even it grew only on the hillsides and was not even visible. This all happened within one year. We witnessed the destruction of wild plants firsthand and it does not feel good.\n\nThere was still plenty of nettle in the park but you had to look in different places. But the park was getting to look more and more like a sports part: just the mowed grass and no more wild plants that do not look like the grass. That's the way things are.\n\nThe Indigo Bush\n\nA while ago we went to Anza-Borrego desert, which is one of the biggest deserts in the country or to be more exact is the biggest National Park that covers this particular desert.\n\nWell, desert is deceptively empty. True, the habitat is not as rich as, say, wetland or forest, however the life forms in the desert are numerous and their adaptations to the cruel heat climate are amazing. For example, some spend lots of time underground hiding from the unbearable heat of the day and going out at cool night. Others developed ability to suck the little moisture they find in plants so they don't need water. Yet others change their anatomy to adapt to living in extreme heat. Fascinating stuff.\n\nWe visited a museum that is located in the Visitors Center in Borrego Springs, little town right in the middle of this desert. The mountains around look desolate but the chaparral around the country is full of life.\n\nAnyway, I was very impressed with this museum. It was small but full of interesting information and numerous exhibits, mainly kids-oriented but what's the heck! Information is information. For example, here is a riddle for you: which is the oldest plant on the planet? If you answered bristlecone pine, WRONG! At leat that was what I thought. Turns out the oldest plant on the planet is a creosote bush, which is more than 9 thousand years old! They did not, however, reveal the location of this marvellous plant or even mentioned whether it was still living.\n\nThe Visitors Center also had a nice garden with typical desert plants. I am a sucker for botanical gardens so I took some pictures. For today's exhibit I chose the Indigo Bush, because it's not a famous plant yet it is quite numerous in that garden. So meet out friend:\n\nIndigo bush (Anza-Borrego National Park, Borrego Springs)\n\nThis is the best looking bush I found, most of them do not look that luscious. I wonder if this is the plant from which the famous indigo paint comes.\n\nDatura\n\nDatura (Picture takes in Wilderness Gardens near Pala, CA)\n\nWell, this one was really an exciting discovery. I first noticed this plant in Wilderness gardens near Pala Indian Reservation but I didn't know what plant it was. Only later i was able to identify it as datura or jimson weed, a plant that can be used as a poison or rather made into a psychedelic concoction to induce visions.\n\nWell, since then I have seen it in other places. It grows wild though it is not really a common plant. It seems to like desert environment. It has beautiful white flowers. I have no idea what part of plants is used for trips though I suspect it's a flower or seed. Anyway it really stands out in desert.\n\nDatura is part of the Nightshade family (Solanaceae)\n\nCreosote Bush\n\nCreosote (Picture taken in Casa Grande Ruins)\n\nAh, I've heard so much about this plant. The name itself always excited me. Travelling through Indian country one can learn that American Indians used the plant for medicinal purposes. It still grows in abundance in desert country like Arizona and desert parts of California.\n\nI expected it to smell like creosote (though I don't know how creosote smells) but I could not detect any smell. Perhaps Indians cooked it and the heating would release the smell. It has sticky oily substance that is released when you rub the leaves but it does not have any aroma.\n\nCreosote bush (Picture taken in Joshua Tree National Park)\n\nAnother creosote bush had little white puffy balls. My guess is they are seeds. As you can see there are flowers and white puffs on the same bush. It's fairly common in plants.\n\nCresoste bush is called Larrea tridentata in Latin and is part of family Zygophyllaceae.\n\nMystery of Jojoba\n\nBladderpod plant (Picture taken in Joshua Tree National Park)\n\nWha'd'yah'know? As soon as the mystery of epazote was solved, another one appeared. This time it's a mystery of jojoba plant. The mystery is the one of identification. This plant was growing in abundance in Joshua Tree National Park but I could not find any labeled plant in the botanical exhibit. Anyway, until confirmed otherwise, we'll consider it jojoba (Edit: the plant is actually Cleome isomeris, see note below).\n\nA few facts about jojoba. It's a desert plant and male and female flowers grow on different plants. The leaves are smooth and turn sideways to the sun so not to expose the whole surface and thus prevent moisture evaporation. In that particular area there were several plants with brights yellow flowers, including creosote bush and desert senna.\n\nThe plant on photograph has numerous pods that smell like fresh peas but the seeds are very small. I am not sure it is really jojoba.\n\nJojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) is the only species of the family Simmondsiaceae (Jojoba family). Chinensis means \"of Chinese origin\". Strangely enough, in spite of the name jojoba does not originate in China. It grows in the deserts of California, Arizona and Mexico.\n\nNote. As it turned out, the plant above is not a jojoba but bladderpod (Cleome isomeris, also known as Isomeris arborea). It does grow in the desert. The plant has big four-petaled yellow flowers and it is part of the family Cleomaceae that is closely related to Brassicasiae hence the morphological resemblance. In some systems it is still considered part of Brassicaseae. Peritoma arborea is another name for this plant."
