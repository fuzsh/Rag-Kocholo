        "text": "The four venomous snake species responsible for causing the greatest number of medically significant human snake bite cases on the Indian subcontinent are sometimes collectively referred to as the Big Four. 1. Common krait, Bungarus caeruleus 2. Indian cobra, Naja naja 3. Russell’s viper, Daboia russelii 4. Indian saw-scaled viper, Echis carinatus According to a 2020 study that did a comprehensive analysis of snake bites in India, Russell’s viper accounted for 43% of the snakebites in India, followed by kraits (18%), cobras (12%), hump nose viper (4%), saw-scaled viper (1.7%), and water snake (0.3%). The rest (21%) were of unidentified species.

They have this amazing multi functional tool called trunk. It's the extended upper lip grown together with the nose. The tip looks like 2 fingers. Much more sensitive than our finger tips. Elephants use their trunk to breath, to drink, to touch, to carry, to break, to pull, to push. They are able to pick up a single grass stem. If more force is needed then African Elephant have another tool: tusks. These are continuously growing elongated incisors. They are used to dig up soil, debarking trees and as a weapon. The eyesight of African Elephants is not very good. They can see clear for some meters. Look at the strong eyelashes protecting the eyes. Does an animal of this enormous size even need good eyesight? Their food isn't running away as they are herbivores, the sense of smell, touch and hearing is excellent. The only thread to a fully-grown healthy African Elephant is a human and its tools.

These small triangle cut-outs on the ears were made by our wildlife department. Every Rhino on the reserve features a different notch pattern and is therefore easily identifiable from a distance. This helps Thanda Safari's Monitors (= wildlife team members dedicated to tracking endangered species) to perform their task of keeping track of these endangered and prosecuted creatures. All our guides assist them by reporting any Rhino sightings to the monitors.

It is highly sought after by contemporary aristocrats and merchants in both Eastern and Western courts. This \"tortoiseshell\" color originates from the turtle shell itself. 🐢\"Tortoiseshell\" can refer to an organic gemstone composed of keratin and bone, and it's said that the name of this gemstone comes directly from the shell of the turtle of the same name. Tortoiseshells have also attracted misfortune due to their beautiful shells, much like elephants and rhinos, they have been targeted by poachers who take away vital parts of their bodies. Although improper hunting of sea turtles still occurs in some parts of the world, due to the rising awareness of turtle conservation worldwide, the situation of indiscriminate hunting of sea turtle is gradually gaining attention. #Fethiann® #Biotechnology #Fethiannglobal #FMO® #Magnoliafigo #FLC® #Litseacubeba #Lifescience #Skincare #Cosmetics #NaturalExtract #Foodandtea #April #2024 #Seaturtles #Tortoiseshell #incosGlobal #Enterprise #費生恩生技股份\n\n🐍 Creature Feature: The East African Gaboon Viper Today, let's take a field trip and explore the East African Gaboon Viper (Bitis gabonica). This viper is a fascinating species native to the lush forests and woodlands of East Africa and personally my favorite snake in the viperidae family. These serpents are renowned for their stunning appearance. With an average length of 1.2 meters (4 feet), Gaboon Vipers possess a broad, triangular head adorned with intricate patterns in various shades of green, brown, and gray. Their body is characterized by a series of striking, irregular diamond-shaped patterns, making them masters of camouflage amidst the forest floor. Seeing they are dressed for the part, Gaboon Vipers are forest dwellers, favoring dense, humid rainforests, and wooded savannas across countries like Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda. Their exceptional camouflage allows them to blend seamlessly with the leaf litter, making them exceptionally elusive. These vipers are known for their potent venom, primarily hemotoxic in nature. Hemotoxins attack blood vessels, causing swelling and tissue damage. Though their venom is potent, Gaboon Vipers are generally not aggressive and prefer to rely on their cryptic appearance to avoid conflict. However, caution is crucial if encountering them in the wild. Fun Facts: 1) Gaboon Vipers possess the longest fangs of any snake, reaching up to 5 centimeters (2 inches) in length. 2) These vipers use the ambush hunting strategy and rely on their camouflage to remain hidden until prey, such as small mammals or birds, ventures too close. 3) Some Gaboon Vipers have distinctive horn-like structures on their snouts, known as \"horns\" or \"bosses.\" These structures are composed of modified scales and are not fully understood but are believed to aid in camouflage. Remember, appreciating these incredible creatures from a safe distance is key to their conservation and our safety.

The day is dedicated to spread awareness and support the conservation efforts to save all five species of the rhinoceros. The great Indian rhinoceros, also known as the one-horned rhinoceros, holds a vulnerable status and is native to the Indian subcontinent. According to the State of Rhino Report 2022, released by the International Rhino Foundation, the greater one-horned rhino population India stood at 3,262, with Assam’s Kaziranga National Park reporting the highest number of rhinos at 2,613. 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗽 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗽𝗼𝘁 𝗿𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗼𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗮: - India is home to several remarkable national parks and wildlife sanctuaries where you can catch a glimpse of these magnificent rhinos. One of the most famous is Kaziranga National Park, which is located in Assam. Kaziranga National Park is the largest habitat of the greater one-horned rhinoceros, found only in India, Nepal and Bhutan. This park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its dense rhino population. #world #rhinoday #wildlife #animal #animalprotection #India #worldheritage #coretechitservices\n\nJaipurstuff - Elephants at Amer Fort are forced to walk, saddled, in the heat and unrelenting sun, with tourists on their back - all for profit. The real story here is not the cost to the tourists. The real story is the mental and physical cost to the elephants both on the walks and when they are chained standing for hours on end. This tourist experience can never be \"environmentally friendly\" or better \"organized\" - this is animal cruelty for profit. Please be better journalists. Look at the true situation. Question 'authority'. Do your due diligence. https://lnkd.in/gq2rKEHE"
