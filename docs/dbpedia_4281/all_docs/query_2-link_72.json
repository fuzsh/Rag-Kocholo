        "text": "In this study, methanolic extract of Heliotropium dasycarpum was assessed to explored for its biological and pharmacological activities. For antibacterial, antifungal and phytotoxicity activities 11bacterial, 10 fungal and 4 weed plant species were used respectively. Plant showed inhibition zone against only 3 Bacterial (Chlamydia trachomatis, β-hemolytic streptococci and Corynebacterium diphtheria) and four fungal species (Pneumocystis jiroveci, Cryptococcus neoformans, Zygomycetes and Microsporum canis) at maximum inhibitory concentration like; 60, 120 and 240 mg/ml and no inhibition zone was noted with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 10, 20 and 30 mg/ml. Phytochemical investigation exposed the occurrence of plant alkaloids, cardenolides, saponnins, flavonoids, enzymes, terpenoids and pigments. Results also indicated that H. dasycarpum had important phytotoxic activities. Plant designated maximum inhibition for the growth of Lemna minor L. (100 %) and Eichhornia crassipe...\n\nObjective: Heliotropium indicum (H. indicum) has been used widely for centuries on warts and to treat inflammations and tumors. H. indicum Linn (Family Boraginaceae) is a medicinal plant. It is known commonly as \"Cock's comb\". H. indicum Linn has various medicinal uses in the treatment of disease conditions such as Abdominal pains, Amenorrhoea, Dysmenorrhoea, Skin rashes, Wounds, Hypertension, Ocular infections, Convulsion, Dizziness. To provide scientific validation to the traditional use of plants in vitro cytotoxic effect was evaluated on HeLa cell lines. Methods: The crude extracts of stem and leaf of Heliotropium indicum were prepared using soxhlet apparatus using solvents of increasing polarity. The study was performed using methanolic extracts against human cancer cell line (HeLa) using MTT assay to analyze the cell growth inhibition. Results: The results showed that the methanolic extracts of stem and leaf of Heliotropium indicum possessed a good amount of anticancer activity and IC50 for both the extracts found to be 200µg/ml. Whereas stem extracts exhibited excellent activity up to 64.5% at 200 µg/ml and followed by leaf extract up to 49.67% at 200 µg/ml. Obtained results supports the traditional claim of the plant. Conclusion: The methanolic extracts of leaf and stem of H. indicum exhibits cytotoxic activity. Hence, Obtained results support the traditional claim of the plant.\n\nSince the time of our ancestors, natural products issued from plant play a therapeutic crucial role. About 25-30% of all medicines (drugs) available for the treatment of diseases are derived from natural products (from plants, animals, bacteria and fungi) or are derivatives of natural products. The aim of this research was to scientifically identify and supply tangible documentation on these two plants employed in the traditional medicine. From November 2020 to February 2021, an ethnobotanical survey was conducted within four markets at the south of Benin, employing a semistructured questionnaire. Two hundred respondents including 80% of females and 20% of males were interviewed. The 2 studied plants are mainly used for different types of sickness related to infections. Females’ herbalists are the most represented. From this research, it appears that the 2 plants are widely used for the treatment of severe infections. On the market, 95% of the leafy steam are sold against 5% of the ...\n\nEthnomedicinal practices used in better health treatment system from ancient time. Phytomedicines are now an essential area of better treatment and high prospects in many nations. It is less expensive as well as has better cultural and societal recognition, has better feasibility with the human physiological system and has decidedly fewer side effects. Heliotropium indicum Linn. (Family-Boraginaceae) an annual herbaceous medicinal weed and it is commonly known as Indian heliotrope. It is not only a common weed but also it is an important medicinal herb, too. These medicinal herbs are found in tropical and temperate parts of the world along with India, Bangladesh, and some other African countries. Extensive literature studies suggested that the various parts of the plant are reported to possess anti-microbial, anti-tumor, anti-tuberculosis, antiplasmodial, anti-cataract, anti-fertility, wound healing, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, analgesic and histo-gastro protective properties. Many pyrrolizidine categories of alkaloids have been separated from this particular medicinal plant. Maximum alkaloids which are isolated from Heliotropium indicum are toxic effects and for that reason use of Heliotropium indicum in internal therapy is not recommended. External methods to cure wound healing and skin infections are less risky, still much more research study is needed. The present review study deals with natural habitat, pharma phytochemical screening, botanical, taxonomical and other critical biological aspects of Heliotropium indicum. The main phytochemicals found in this plant are tannins and alkaloids. The present review may be helpful for identification and preparation of a clear monograph of Heliotropium indicum.\n\nIntroduction: A huge number of plants have remedial and therapeutic prospects throughout the world and are used in the treatment of diverse diseases. Heliotropium is a large genus of family Boraginaceae which widely distributed in tropical and temperate regions of hemispheres. The purpose of this review is to recapitulate the phytochemistry and pharmacological activities of the Heliotropium species to unveil future research prospects. Methods: Published data in this review were all gathered from the online bibliographical databases: PubMed, Elsevier, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science. Results: The plants of the Heliotropium genus in the history of traditional drugs provide remedies for gout, inflammation , skin disorders, menstrual dysfunction, rheumatism, and noxious bites. The active biochemical constituents extracted from the Heliotropium species comprise pyrrolizidine alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids. Significant biological activities viz. antimicrobial, antiviral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxicity, phytotox-icity, and wound healing were revealed by an enormous number of extracts and biochemically active constituents of various species of the Heliotropium genus. Conclusion: Phytomedicines are now an important and beneficial zone of the recommended treatment and have high potentials in many countries. Although this clear evidence that plants of the Heliotropium genus have several medicinal importance in the treatment of diverse diseases. The medicinal use of these plants as phyto-pharmaceuticals would depend on the production of the required systematic procedures necessary to standardize the various bioactive secondary metabolites in such herbal formulations. Therefore, we conclude that in the coming period, plants of the Heliotropium genus would become an acceptable source of indigenous medicines."
