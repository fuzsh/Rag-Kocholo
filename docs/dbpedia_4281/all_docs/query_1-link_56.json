        "text": "(Boraginaceae)\n\nThis page now includes scorpionweed, formerly (and for some botanists, still) in Hydrophyllaceae, the waterleaf family. Images are organized alphabetically by genus and species. Hover over a photo series to control the images.\n\nHidden Flower, Thicksepal Catseye (Cryptantha crassisepala)\n\nThere are many species of Cryptantha. My identification to the species level is bolstered by Littlefield and Burns's inclusion of C. crassisepala in their book and by the fact that similar-looking species apparently don't extend into the Albuquerque area.\n\nCryptantha and Oreocarya (below) are variously treated as synonyms or as two separate genera. Consistent with this discussion, I have placed this particular species in Cryptantha based on this web page.\n\nStickseed (Hackelia)\n\nMy 2020 photos of stickseed show all-white flowers; my 2021 photo shows flowers that are very pale blue. Several species of stickseed are reported from the Sandia Mountains.\n\nPhlox or Bindweed Heliotrope (Heliotropium convolvulaceum)\n\nGiven this plant's five-part but continuous flower, it would be easy (if incorrect) to assume that it's part of the Morning Glory Family. The white flowers are smaller than Bindweed flowers, and the leaves look hairy to the naked eye. The plant can be sprawling or a low bush. Look for Phlox Heliotropes in sandy areas.\n\nSalt Heliotrope (Heliotropium curassavicum)\n\nSalt heliotrope prefers moist, salty soils. Look for curling spikes of flowers. The centers of the flowers are yellow at first, purple as the flowers get older.\n\nFringed Puccoon (Lithospermum incisum)\n\nThis plant is also known as Fringed Gromwell, Narrowleaf Stoneseed, Narrowleaf Gromwell, Narrowleaf Pucoon, and Trumpet Stoneseed. Note how the flowers include long tubes, and how the leaves are covered with hairs that lie flat along their surfaces.\n\nWayside Gromwell (Lithospermum multiflorum)\n\nAlso known as many-flowered puccoon, manyflowered stoneseed, purple gromwell, manyflowered gromwell, and purple pucoon. Who knows, there may be other names.\n\nFranciscan Bluebells (Mertensia franciscana)\n\nAs these photos show, Franciscan Bluebells range from pale blue to white. In the latter case, if you check other blossoms in the same patch you're likely to see hints of blue.\n\nLanceleaf Bluebells (Mertensia lanceolata)\n\nThe Sandia Mountains have two species of Mertensia, Franciscan and lanceleaf bluebells. They look similar to me. But notice how narrow the lanceleaf leaves are, and how hairy the plant is.\n\nOreocarya flava\n\nOreocarya flava occurs mainly from the Four Corners area northward through eastern Utah and into southern Wyoming. These photos were taken near the southeast end of its range. In early April, it was one of the first wildflowers to appear along the nature trails at Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nCryptantha (above) and Oreocarya are variously treated as synonyms or as two separate genera. Consistent with this discussion, I have placed this particular species in Oreocarya based on this web page. You may encounter references to the same wildflower as Cryptantha flava, along with a common name such as yellow cryptantha. Once you read the linked pages, take another look at my photo where the plant has a ring structure. That's a sure sign that the species is perennial, having grown outward from the initial plant.\n\nVariable-Leaf Scorpion-Weed (Phacelia heterophylla)\n\nThis plant has flowers with white petals—but those can be all but lost in the uncurling \"fiddlehead\" style flower heads.\n\nGypsum Scorpionweed (Phacelia integrifolia)\n\nTo identify Gypsum Scorpionweed, look for small purple flowers on a base that's curled like a scorpion's tail. The flower cluster uncurls as it grows. Other species have this \"fiddlehead\" flower arrangement, however, so also look for the deep purple anthers that extend well beyond the petals."
