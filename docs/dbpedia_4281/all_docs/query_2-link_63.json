        "text": "American Coots & Baby... Cootlings?\n\nCoots are not ducks. That's probably one of the first lessons in waterfowl taxonomy you ought to learn. In fact, they're not even kind of sort of related to ducks. American Coots ( Fulica americana ) belong to the Rail family (Rallidae), along with rails (naturally) and gallinules. Going one taxonomic step above family, they belong to the order Gruiformes, which also includes the crane family. Ducks, geese and swans, however, are members of the order Anseriformes, quite a different branch of the avian family tree. So, the next time someone inquires about an all-black \"duck\" with a white bill and funny-looking feet, feel free to kindly share with them that the coot is not a duck at all, but actually more closely related to Sandhill Cranes ! Adult American Coot with two juveniles Because American Coots are terribly common birds on almost every body of water across nearly the entire North American continent, I pay them very little mind. They're al\n\nExploring New Places: South Carolina's Salt Marshes and Tidal Creeks\n\nThroughout South Carolina's Low Country, winding tendrils of water wend their way through a sea of grass, rising and falling with each new tide. Low-lying intertidal areas immediately inland from the coast, salt marshes and tidal creeks form the interface between upland forests and urban areas, and brackish estuaries where freshwater and saltwater mix. Tidal creeks are, to a first-time visitor to the South Carolina coast like myself, absolutely beautiful, mysterious, enthralling places where silvery ribbons of water meander seemingly aimlessly through a vivid green matrix. They give the impression that there is water everywhere , a foreign concept to someone from arid, drought-stricken Mediterranean California. And that was my first impression of South Carolina: there was water everywhere I looked! Water in the ocean, lakes, rivers, creeks and wetlands, water covering the ground, falling from the sky, in the air itself! Is there any land at all in this veritable wa\n\nA Shorebird Primer: Godwits, Curlews, Willets and Whimbrels\n\nFor those of us living in the Great Central Valley, autumn is the time to head to the coast. Of course, there is no bad time to visit California's magnificent coastline. But as the heat and haze of summer drag on in the Valley, the sea becomes increasingly tantalizing: September and the onset of autumn bring sunny weather and an abundance of migratory seabirds and shorebirds to our coast. A new birder visiting California's Central Coast will undoubtedly be met with a splendid array of very confusing birds. Among these are small shorebirds like \"peeps\" (sandpipers), Sanderlings and various plovers . But the larger birds can be just as confusing, until you learn a few distinguishing features. Four large shorebirds that are commonly seen (and commonly confused) along California's Central Coast are Godwits, Curlews, Willets and Whimbrels. Marbled Godwit (upper left), Whimbrel (upper right), Long-billed Curlew (center front) The distinguishing featu\n\nBirds of the Desert: Residents & Spring Migrants\n\nNearly everyone knows the desert as a barren, desolate land of extremes: high heat, low precipitation; little available food and water; prickly, spiny, unfriendly plants growing in a sea of rocks and sand as far as the eye can see. But for those who stop and look closer, the desert reveals itself as the beautiful, incredible, mesmerizing place it truly is, teeming with unexpected life. Juvenile male Costa's Hummingbird visiting chuparosa blooms next to our campsite in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. I particularly love the desert in the spring, when the annual wildflowers, cacti, flowering trees and shrubs are all in bloom. (I've experienced the desert in the searing 120 degree heat of summer, and the rainy, even snowy cold of winter... and spring wins every time!) Eric and I just returned from a week in the Colorado desert, exploring the imperiled, accidental Salton Sea (more on that coming soon), the vital wetlands of the Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refu\n\nGreat Horned Owl Fledglings\n\nIt's spring, and the marshes, grasslands and woodlands of California are brimming with life as young birds of all description hatch, grow and begin to fledge. I've mentioned before that when I can't get out into a proper patch of wilderness, I enjoy birding at CSU Stanislaus. This year, there is something particularly exciting on the college campus: a family of Great Horned Owls ( Bubo virginianus ). Great Horned Owls begin breeding very early (or late) in the year, with courtship beginning in the late fall and early winter. While out for a walk last December, Eric and I heard a pair of Great Horned Owls on campus. Noting the presence of tall pine trees (potential nesting habitat) and an abundance of prey (gophers and waterfowl), I dared to hope they might choose to stay. And it turns out, they did! Great Horned Owls lay their eggs as early as January or February in California. Eggs are incubated by the female for about four weeks, while the male keeps her"
