The new species is morphologically similar to Lappula himalayensis and L. tadshikorum. However, it can be distinguished from the compared species by several characteristics, such as: stem single, erect, frequently branched at middle and above, densely spreading hispid, hairs discoid at base; corolla white or blue; fruit compressed, heteromorphic nutlets with two rows of marginal glochids, nutlets acute ovoid, disc narrowly ovate-triangular. The diagnosis of the new species is supported with comprehensive investigation including photographs, detailed description, notes on etymology, distribution and habitat, conservation status, as well as comparisons with morphologically similar species.",
