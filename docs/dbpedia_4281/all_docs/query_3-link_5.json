        "text": "Boraginaceae, borage or forget-me-not family of flowering plants, with 148 genera and more than 2,700 species. The taxonomy of this family has been contentious: the earlier Cronquist botanical classification system placed it in the order Lamiales, and the first version of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) system treated it as part of Solanales. With a lack of consensus regarding its evolutionary history, Boraginaceae was placed in the Euasterids I (lamiids) clade without an order by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III (APG III) in 2009.\n\nBoraginaceae plants are frequently herbaceous and hairy and can be annuals or perennials. Some are vines or trees, and a few are obligate parasites (cannot photosynthesize and thus require a host). Boraginaceae was initially put into Lamiales because it shared with Lamiaceae (mints) and Verbenaceae (vervains) ovaries with four deeply divided partitions, a style attached to the base of the ovary, and fruits that break apart into four nutlets. These similarities appear to have evolved independently, however, and borages differ in having alternate leaves, round stems, different secondary metabolites (no iridoid alkaloids), regular flowers, the same number of stamens and petals, and flower clusters that are often coiled like a scorpionâ€™s tail.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPlants: From Cute to Carnivorous\n\nThe family includes a number of garden ornamentals, such as Heliotropium (heliotrope), Mertensia virginica (Virginia bluebell), Phacelia (scorpion weed), Pulmonaria (lungwort), and Myosotis (forget-me-not). Some of the more typical borages show colour changes of the corolla (the petals, collectively) upon aging, from pink to blue, yellow to pink to blue, or yellow to white; this transformation is caused by changes in the pH of the cellular fluids. Many species are poisonous, but some species have been used medicinally, such as Borago officinalis (borage), Symphytum officinale (comfrey), and Lithospermum (puccoon, or stoneseed). In the tropics the genus Cordia, with more than 200 species, is very diverse and includes some important timber species."
