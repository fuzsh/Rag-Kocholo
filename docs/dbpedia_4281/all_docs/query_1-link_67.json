        "text": "Southern California Native Plants\n\nSo what did you do during Quarantine 2020? Well, I spent many, many hours exploring the fields behind my neighborhood, and I went hunting for native plants and wildflowers! Would you like to see what I saw? Below, I have listed all of the Southern California native plants I observed from March to July.\n\nI had a lot of time on my hands, and I thought now would be an excellent time to get more familiar with the native plants in my area. Did you know that San Diego County has the highest biodiversity in the continental United States?\n\nYes! California hosts over 6500 species, subspecies, and varieties of plants, with 222 of these that are designated as rare, endangered, or threatened.\n\nI live about one mile from the San Diego Border, so even though technically Temecula is in southwest Riverside County, let’s pretend.\n\nSo, where did I see all of these lovely plants? Behind my neighborhood is an undeveloped area that lies just outside the Pechanga Indian Reservation, and a dry riverbed runs parallel to two golf courses owned by Pechanga.\n\nBelow, I have provided a Google Map of the area that has become my second home these past five months.\n\nThere are several biomes to explore here-\n\nGrasslands\n\nCoastal Sage Scrub\n\nChaparral\n\nSouthern Oak Woodland\n\nSerpentine\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nUnusual Amounts of Rainfall for Southern California\n\nOn a side note, I wanted to boast about how much rain we got this winter. Something extraordinary happened!\n\nYou see, we, on average, have very little rain here. But, in April, it rained almost every day for three weeks.\n\nWhy does this matter? First, the creek bed behind our neighborhood is always bone dry, and I have lived here for almost 17 years and have never seen this river flow. However, it was raining so hard in April that the creek could be heard over a block away.\n\nThe average rainfall for Southern California is usually only 10.3 inches, but we received over 11.63 inches of rain in March and April. Can you believe it? In just two months!\n\nI bring up this fact because I believe all of this extra rain impacted the chaparral tremendously, in a good way.\n\nTake a look and tell me if you agree.\n\nSouthern California Native Plants and Wildflowers\n\nI have been trying my darnedest to learn how to identify Southern California’s plethora of native plants, but the process has been very gradual because I am a slow learner. In my defense, San Diego County has the highest biodiversity of flora and fauna in the entire continental US.\n\nBecause of this, it helps me tremendously to separate each plant down to its Family and scientific name. Once you understand Family characteristics, identifying plants becomes more straightforward when observing them in the field.\n\n–>Click on any photo to see a larger version.\n\nEthnobotany and the Temecula Chaparral\n\nAs I was wandering around in nature, I thought a great way of learning about Southern California native plants would be by researching how the Native Americans of San Diego and Temecula Valley utilized them.\n\nOnce I became familiar with Ethnobotany, which is studying the region’s plants and practical uses through the traditional knowledge of the local culture and people, I now knew how to proceed.\n\nTo be honest, this post has taken me well over eight weeks to comprise, not to mention the endless hours of searching and searching for all the new blooming plants. I am not complaining, as I have learned a tremendous amount about the local flora and native plants of Southern Temecula.\n\nI additionally found some excellent references, which will be listed at the end of the post.\n\nKumeyaay and Luiseno’s Uses of Native Plants\n\nSo why did I choose the Kumeyaay and the Luiseno Tribes? Luiseno is evident as I live next to the Pechanga Reservation. I picked the Kumeyaay Tribe because I have learned about its rich history every time I visit a nature center in San Diego County.\n\nDown below, I will go over each tribe briefly to give you a general overview, but I have included links if you are interested in any additional information.\n\nAs I list all of the Southern California native plants, I will also add each of the Kumeyaay and the Luiseno indigenous names, if available. Also included within the list will be any traditional uses of each plant.\n\nApplications of each plant are noted separately for each tribe. If no tribe is specified, please assume that the plant was utilized by a Southern California tribe unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe Kumeyaay of Southern California\n\nKumeyaay translates to ” those who face a water from a cliff.” The tribe consists of two related groups with two divided homelands.\n\nThe Ipai remain in San Diego, bordering north at Oceanside. At the same time, the Tipai lives to the south in Mexico, including the Laguna Mountains, Ensenada, and Tecate (Baja California).\n\nThe Kumeyaay tribe were the original inhabitants of what is known presently as San Diego County when Europeans first arrived in California in 1769.\n\nThese immigrants were a combination of soldiers, explorers, and missionaries who preceded to settle in ancient Kumeyaay village Kosa’aay, formally known as Old Town San Diego.\n\nThese settlers brought non-native and invasive flora and domesticated animals, which all wreaked havoc on the native ecology.\n\nThere is evidence, via archeological findings proving that the Kumeyaay have been in this area for over 12,000 years. I have previously written briefly about a Kumeyaay coastal hunting trail that is believed to be over 10,000 years old and found at La Jolla- La Jolla Coast Walk Trail.\n\n–> For more historical information on the Kumeyaay Tribe\n\nThe Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians\n\nThe Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians, formally known as the Payaomkawichum ( “People of the West,”) has inhabited western Riverside County and San Diego North County for over 10,000 years.\n\nSpanish Missionaries arrived in Temecula Valley in 1797 and established Mission San Luis Rey de Francia on Luiseno ancestorial territory. I have written briefly on the subject if you want to know more.–> Notable Places of Interest Near Guamoje Regional Park\n\nThe Luiseno used more plant foods than animal foods, which included over 17 species of native grasses. With the arrival and colonization of European settlers, the plant communities considerably altered.\n\nThe Executive Order officially established the Pechanga Reservation on June 27, 1882.\n\n–> For more historical information on the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians\n\nGlossary of Southern California Plant Terms\n\nBefore we start, I thought it would be a good idea to define a few terms beforehand.\n\nFirst off, here is a plant diagram to help you understand how to identify-\n\nFlower Diagram\n\nNext, a helpful chart gives you an idea of identifying each type of leaf.\n\nLeaf Morphology\n\nAnd finally, here are some helpful definitions to elaborate on how Native Americans utilized various Southern California native plants.\n\nHerbal Medicine Definitions\n\nDecoction- a liquor results from concentrating a substance’s essence by heating or boiling, especially a medicinal preparation made from a plant; the process of extracting- slow evaporation.

The scale contains carminic acid, which is distasteful to predators. The Aztecs learned how to make a brilliant red dye from the acid. So when the Spaniards arrived in the New World, they found widespread farms of prickly pear cactus, along with its associated scale. Cochineal quickly became an extensive export to European markets, second to only silver for its export value.\n\nFun Fact- I have a prickly pear cactus situated right in front of my house. Though I have not cooked or eaten any of the pads, I do thoroughly enjoy the fruit. It is important to have something wrapped around the fruit before picking it, due to those nasty, nasty glochids!\n\nI use a newspaper to pick the fruit and then to roll it within the newpaper to get rid of the tiny spines. Next cut the peel off and enjoy! One thing that I do also, is let the fruit sit in a large glass of water for a couple of hours. By soaking, you increase the viscocity of the water and truly experience its wonderful watermelon flavor.

Writing about all of these Southern California native plants has been so satisfying! When I started this adventure in March, I was intimidated while hiking and trying to ID the flowers. Now that we are in July, I have improved tremendously. How about you?\n\nPlease check back shortly as I am working on a few other Southern California native plant articles if you enjoyed this post. The next one will concentrate on what I saw on the coast at San Onofre State Beach in May after California finally opened the beaches again.\n\nAnd finally, I wanted to add a few words of encouragement during this unprecedented time in history, as I like to refer to as, Quarantine 2020.\n\nStay strong and positive, as this will all be over soon. I highly recommend spending time in Nature. It sure helps me stay sane!\n\nUntil next time!\n\n-Southern California Native Plant References-\n\nCalFlora.org- What Grow’s Here?
