        "text": "One way to think about the diversity of plant forms is in the context of adaptations to life on land. The green algae are probably the least changed from the ancestors of modern day land plants, and many of the branches in the plant evolutionary tree relate to adaptations that give them advantages for living on land. For example, vascular tissues allow water to be delivered to parts of the plant not immersed in water, seeds provide a nutrition source so that a plant can wait to germinate until conditions are good, enclosed seeds, protected inside the ovary, often produce fruits that encourage animal dispersal, and flowers are of use in attracting pollinators."
