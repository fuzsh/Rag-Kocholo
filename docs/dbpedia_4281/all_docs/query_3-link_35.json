        "meta_description": "The inventory, generated from a list of structured data, is presented in two Supplements, as a searchable HTML document comprising a sequence of entries with internal cross-links and links to external sources, in particular to protologues accessible online or, copyright restrictions permitting, made available as scanned documents via DOIs, and as machine-readible file. With minor exceptions, all names have been verified in their original place of publication, and all were nomenclaturally assessed. Colour coding is used to distinguish between names (in green) pertaining to Cynoglossum sensu lato, for which complete synonymies are provided; and names (in orange) pertaining to other genera but published under Cynoglossum or its segregates. They are listed together with their basionym and the corresponding correct name (if it exists), but without complete synonymy. Acceptable, potentially correct names appear in bold-face type, both under a broadly defined Cynoglossum (for which purpose validation of 81 new combinations and the name of 1 new species was necessary) and under one or more of its segregates. When a name was published for a new taxon, original material is indicated, usually by direct quotation from the protologue. New type designations are exceptional (two cases), whereas former type designations are cited whenever known. Furthermore, types and original specimens, especially when their digital images are available online, are mentioned with their locations and accession numbers. Comments are added whenever appropriate, especially to explain nomenclatural assessments that are not self-evident.",
