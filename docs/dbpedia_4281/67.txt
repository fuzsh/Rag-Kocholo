Heliotropium L.M 1753 is one of the large genera in the family Boraginaceae, and subfamily Heliotropioiodeae (Bramwell, 1978). In Iraq, Al-Rawi recorded 15 species which belong to Heliotropium, while Rechinger found 8 species. It has chemical compounds, represented by tannins, phenols, saponins, terpenoids, and alkaloids (Choudhary et_al, 2013; Wasiullah et_al, 2019), which are isolated to be used effectively against infection with insects, fungi, and bacteria 1 Heliotropium curassavicum L., 1753 (Boraginaceae) (Yogamoorthi and Sathyapriya, 2006). This species is used in some countries to treat some human diseases such as ulcers, wounds, edema, local infections, gonorrhea, erysipelas, cancer, diabetes, as an enema, and to treat constipation, arteriosclerosis, and rheumatism (Davicino et_al, 1988; Satyavani et_al, 2013a, b; Kaliamurthi et_al, 2014). The distribution and anatomy of this species have been studied by Fari√±a et_al,, Taia, Satyavani et_al, (2013b), Alwahibi and Buhary, Pynee and Lorence and El-Hadidy et_al. Morphological studies of leaf epidermis and Palynological studies are important in the classification of species, and have been used in many studies, such as Al-Mousawi et_al and Khamis and Hamdy. The aim of this study is to provide taxonomic information on the morphological, pollen, and epidermis characteristics of the species H. curassavicum, which is recorded for the first time in the flora of Iraq. Plant collection: Fresh specimens were collected from various parts of Al- Mekhrag, AlDorah, Al-Duweeb, Al-Seeba and Al-Faw Districts in Basrah Province, South of Iraq through field trips that lasted for two consecutive years from 2020 to 2021. The physical and chemical factors of soils are among the main dominant factors in the distribution of plants (Abd El-Waha et_al, 2008). @@
