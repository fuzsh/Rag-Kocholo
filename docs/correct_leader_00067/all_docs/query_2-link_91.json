        "text": "A day was set for them to leave, \"It was so hard, my husband physically attacked me, I had to call the police for an escort. My husband screamed-she can't take the kids, I pay for them. The police officer said, so what if you pay for them? She's coming with us. I will never forget that moment of solidarity.\" The solidarity continues inside the refuge, women and children wander freely, in and out of each others rooms, sharing food, babysitting, having a shoulder to cry on. Hannah 25 gazes out of her bedroom window, with her 2 year old daughter, clutching at her hip, she suffered 3 years of emotional and physical abuse, before she found her freedom. \"Looking out into the garden, makes me feel happy every single day. It's the simple things I appreciate most. When I first came to the refuge, I was so frightened, as I wasn't from this country, I thought I would face racism and, nobody would help me, that's what my abuser told me. This is why it took me such a long time to leave. I thought I wouldn't get help or support, but I feel so welcomed, I was provided with everything, I needed for my child, because I left home with nothing.\" Then softly she describes some of the abuse she suffered. \"He head-butted me, when I was pregnant with our child; after the child was born, he showed no interest in her at all. But when I was planning to leave, he must have suspected something, because he started taking her out. Then he bought us a ticket, to go back to our home country and, threatened to hurt me if I refused. I was worried he was gong to kidnap our child. Now I feel happy and safe. I'm going to college in September and, I can continue my life, without fear of judgement or criticism. The staff and residence here, feel like 1 big family.\" Another resident Judith, who fled an abusive marriage, with her 14 year old son, is heavily pregnant. She lost a previous baby, during pregnancy, after her abuser pushed her. \"I left because I feared, for me and my babys' life. I had to make a decision, so I could see my children grow. When I was with him, I could not see a future, I suffered verbal, sexual and physical abuse, for 5 year. I wasn't allowed an opinion and, I had no right to refuse him anything. I do not feel worried about having my children here, we've been given a chance, of a new life. I feel protected, at peace, I have hope.\" In the year to March 2019, 2.4m adults aged 16 -74, experienced domestic abuse, (1.6m women, 786,000 men) police recorded 746,219 domestic-abuse related crimes, that year an increase of 24%. 64% of refuge referrals were declined in 2018-2019. Since 2010 1 in 6 refuges have closed, the many that remain open, have their resources stretched to the very limit, of their powers. The annual Womens' Aid Audit, calculated that the sector was operating at a shortfall of £393m. Charlotte Kneer 49 a domestic abuse advisor, who has managed Reigate + Banstead Womens' Aid Refuge, for 9 years, is relieved that new funds are imminent, but states, \"£10m is a joke for what is coming our way. It's all well and good throwing pots of money, at refuges now, but if these services are on their knees already, they will have to use the funding, to prop themselves up, rather than create new and extra space. It's simple. We needed a plan from the outset, of this pandemic, to provide additional capacity, in relation to Covid-19, but the plan never existed. I've literally had nightmares wondering what is going to happen, to women and children. Yes the police will help them-but then what? Take them where exactly? Imagine what it is like, for those 6 out of 10 women, who cannot get a refuge space. We have women coming to us, who have been sleeping rough, sleeping in their cars, with their children, or sent to unsafe hostels and B+B accommodation, where they are vulnerable to repeated victimisation.\" Kneer lived for 9 years with her abuser, during which time, she was struck on the head with a lamp, , threatened with a knife; her now x-husband did a 4 year term, for ABH(actual bodily harm)+threats to kill. \"People think, you can just take your kids and leave. You can't. It is a living hell. He could of killed me, he could of killed our kids. We already know similar incidents have happened, during the Covid crisis.\" Kneer took the fate of survivors into her own hands, entering a partnership with the domestic abuse charity, \"Your Sanctuary\" + Surrey count council, which gifted her an additional building, with capacity for 18 families. Charlotte says the new government funding, will keep her financially safe for 4 months. NICOLE JACOBS, the UKs 1st Domestic Abuse Commissioner states, \"A surge post-lockdown in women seeking help is inevitable. \"People in dire circumstances, will be wanting to know what to do next, they will be seeking help as soon as possible.\" The Victims' Commissioner DAME VERA BAIRD, agrees with Nicole, \"It was absolutely predictable, there would be an upturn and, it should have been taken into account, from day1. Then government have come to it late, that's very frustrating.\" NICKI NORMAN of Womens' Aid, feels her warnings fell on deaf ears, she welcomes the return of the, of a delayed Domestic Abuse Bill to parliament, which aims to create a statutory definition of the crime, crucially not just as physical violence, but also emotional, coercive or controlling and economic abuse. It would also include, placing a duty on local authorities in England, to provide refuge support. After her 1st night at the refuge, Maria says she woke up feeling startled but safe. \"Hopefully, there aren't too many people, who will ever know what it feels like, to make life-or-death decision, to leave behind their home and, everything they've ever known. But for those women and children, who will need to follow me, I pray to god, they will make it to safety. Surely the most vulnerable among us, deserve that.\"\n\nWhile we are on the subject of mainly, FEMALE DOMESTIC ABUSE, another local story from east London. Londons' only domestic violence centre for African women, is in a fight for its own salvation, it faces eviction at the end of July 2020. This could see it sent to a deeply unsuitable premises, that would jepordise the safety of the capitals, abused African + Anglo/African women. \"Sistah Space\" rents from Hackney Council, was founded 6 years ago, the council have been refurbishing their current building, since September 2019. They have now given the charity, until July2020 to move back to their premises. Founder Ngozi Fulani said that, the site in Lower Clapton Road, would now be unsafe, because of the glass shopfront, alongside the local anti-social behaviour. \"London needs a Domestic Violence Centre, for the African woman, because of the distress and distrust, that now exists with the police.\" African people are more likely to be subject, to stop + search procedures in the UK. The Metropolitan Police used force 5x, against the African compared to the European. In 2018/19 figures released, by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, covering the period from 2004-2019, show the African are 2x to die in custody, than the Caucasian. The Met has said that, that people of Afro-Caribbean heritage, are likely to be victims or perpetrators, of knife crime. Ms. Fulani said, \"We have sons, husbands, brothers, uncles, we know that if we reported an African man to the police, that could mean death or serious injury. So although we want the violence, abuse to cease, we do not want the perpetrator dead or injured. That's a massive problem, because we can see that there's a massive divide, between police and community. But bridging the gap shouldn't be a 1 way effort.\" Ngozi Fulani also stated that, \"Our community is not always innocent in this, because particular communities will put pressure on you, if you report to the police. Making you feel like, you have betrayed your own.\" Women who think, Immigration is going to throw them out, if they create a fuss, think about the \"Windrush Upset,\" there are women who feel betrayed and let down, thinking they would rather die, than go to the police. Again she told of an interview she had. \"We sat with someone, who explained to the police, the perpetrator held her neck and it hurt. She demonstrated and I asked, So he strangled you? Yes she said, then she carried on. I looked up and he was in the room, then he was there. The police wrote it word for word. I asked, what do you mean he was there? She explained, he was raping her, but she used the word \"there.\" You need to be more than an interpreter, cultural linguist for their use of the English language, it is about empathy, understanding, this was reported over 9 years ago, she has 2 babies both from rape. It is only after 9 years, she could make a statement, after finding \"Sistah Space. The police are now looking for the rapists.\"\n\nBack to south eastern Africa, to Malawi in fact, we talked about this country, in my 1st article, \"My New Book,\" where the hyena man, was considered a sex worker. Now the country has a deity, who is out to save the school girl, from the depraved Malawian male. Her name is THERESA KACHINDAMOTO, known locally as the \"Terminator of Child Marriages,\" this is the nickname she had been given, as the tribal chief annuls child marriages, to take them back to school , to give them a future. If you were a girl living in Malawi, you would have been married, long before you reached adulthood, you would have given up the chance of school, forgetting all about education, learning, knowledge; because you would be pregnant, within the 1st year of being married, probably before you were 12. In the country, with 1 of the highest rates of, child marriages in the world, where 50% of the girls, are married well before they are 18. There is 1 single woman, fighting for them and winning their freedom back. A senior tribal chief, who fights to prevent these cultural atrocities, from happening. To date she has annulled more than 1,000 child marriages. Theresa is a senior tribal chief, of the Dedza District, Malawi, 1 of the 300 tribal leaders, of the country, these elders are guardians of their traditions, but have the rights and powers to abolish some cultural practises, like child marriage. She has this authority and sway over 551 headmen. \"When I came I saw lots of girls, about 12, 13, 14, having 2 children. This is why I got angry, because they are too young, for having a baby. This is why I said no, this is too much I must do something. If the village headman allows a girl to be married, I dismiss him completely.\" Ever since that moment, she has been on a mission to stop this practise, giving the right of education back to the girls. Theresa started her fight, by trying to identify the girls, who fell victim to this practise, relying on a network of women; The Mothers Group, whose aim is ensuring that the girls that dropped school, due to a marriage or pregnancy, resume their education. \"We go door to door, to look for the girls,\" explains 1 of the group. The causes behind early child marriage, are often tradition (the female is worth nothing), and poverty (just get someone else to look after her). In 2017 Malawi took a major step by adopting an amendment; that raises the minimum marriage age from 15 to 18. \"Another important step for us, is to sensitise the community boys and girls, so that they know , that is now illegal to marry off girls, before they are 18.\" Ending early marriage means talking security and health, generally once the female is married, they are subject to gender and domestic violence, those that get pregnant face complications during the pregnancy and childbirth. Which is what contributes to 20-30% maternal mortality, in the country. SO EDUCATION IS A RIGHT FOR THE FUTURE OF THE GIRL, IN MALAWI.\n\nI thought perhaps as a little light relief, we might venture in to the world of music, where we are over-run with famous FEMALE COMPOSERS, or are we? If I was to say, tell me 2 Classic female composers, of any generation from any century. It would perhaps take a little time, to think of 1 possibly, let alone 2. So the idea of this chapter, is to introduce female composers, performers, singers/opera singers of any nationality, from any century to highlight their achievements, seeing as no-one else seems to bother with them.
