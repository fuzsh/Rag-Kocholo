Authors have tried to claim that Te Pito 'o Te Henua, meaning the Navel of the World in the island language, was the name brought with the founding migration, but this has been successfully disputed. The name Rapanui (Great Rapa, as opposed to Rapaiti, the Rapa in French Polynesia) was attributed in the 19th century and has acquired official status. The island had a highly tabooed paramount chief or king, the 'ariki henua. The office was hereditary in the Miru clan, and it appears that, in a similar fashion to Tahitian custom, the first-born son of the 'ariki henua succeeded to the position at birth because the mana passed to him at that moment, his father remaining in power as his regent until his marriage. In 1862, when the population of the island had already been severely depleted, Peruvian guano collectors raided the island, killed a large part of the population, and kidnapped almost all the rest, including the two 'ariki henua (i.e., the nominal 'ariki henua Maurata and his father and predecessor Kai Mako'i iti). Of the kidnapped population, fewer than 200 survived to be returned. Under these circumstances practically all knowledge of the past was lost or thoroughly garbled. It is therefore impossible to recover precise information. There are about six or seven lists of 'ariki henua that were provided to visitors and researchers, with between 20 and 57 names. Here is a list that is perhaps among the less unreliable ones (although interest in the 57-name list has been revived because carbon-dating has retrojected the human settlement of the island to no later than the 5th century).\n\n9 Sep 1888 annexed by Chile Paramount chiefs (title 'ariki henua) - Miru clan - ... - ...

From that date on, everything that has been written about the succession is essentially a fabrication by Philippe Paul Alexandre Henri Boiry (b. 1927 - d. 2014), who claimed to be Philippe I. His account runs as follows: the sole heir, and hence successor, of Antoine II was his daughter, Laure Thérèse Cros, veuve Bernard (b. 1856 - d. 1916), who \"was\" Queen Laure-Thérèse I from 6 Nov 1903 to her death 12 Mar 1916. There is no documentation of her acting as queen. Upon his mother's death, Jacques Alexandre Antoine Bernard (b. 1880 - d. 1952) became King Jacques-Antoine III. On 12 May 1951, Philippe I claimed, Jacques-Antoine III freely ceded the kingship to him, Philippe I, in the same terms as Orllie-Antoine I's nephew had ceded his claim to the future Achille I before his uncle's death. The documentation of this cession is a card that does not name to whom it is addressed.\n\nChina\n\nNote: Names are given in pinyin transliteration (which was officially adopted by the People's Republic on 1 Jan 1979, but not by Taiwan), except for Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek, who are best known under those versions. Emperors are listed with their personal name (ming), followed by their temple name (miaohao), posthumous name (shi), and the era name (nianhao) roughly coextensive with the particular reign (note that the overlap is not perfect). Although it is customary in \"Western\" sources to refer to a Qing ruler by his nianhao (e.g., the Guangxu emperor), Chinese usually refer to a former emperor by his miaohao, perhaps preceded by the name of the polity (e.g., Qing Dezong).\n\nImperial China\n\n15 May 1636 Great Qing Empire inaugurated Emperors - Qing dynasty - 7 Feb 1661 - 20 Dec 1722 Xuanye (b. 1654 - d. 1722) miaohao: Shengzu / shi: Ren huangdi nianhao 18 Feb 1662 - 4 Feb 1723: Kangxi 10 Jul 1706 - 1707 Wei Zhiye (in rebellion) nianhao 10 Jul 1706 - 1707: Wenxing 1707 - 1708 Zhu Cihuan (styled Ding wang, heading Great Ming [or Shining] Realm, in rebellion) 26 May 1721 - 30 Jul 1721 Zhu Yigui (in rebellion, rules almost exclusively on Taiwan) nianhao 26 May 1721 - 30 Jul 1721: Yonghe 27 Dec 1722 - 8 Oct 1735 Yinzhen (b. 1678 - d. 1735) miaohao: Shizong / shi: Xian huangdi nianhao 5 Feb 1723 - 11 Feb 1736: Yongzheng 18 Oct 1735 - 9 Feb 1796 Hongli (b. 1711 - d. 1799) miaohao: Gaozong / shi: Chun huangdi nianhao 12 Feb 1736 - 8 Feb 1796: Qianlong Dec 1786 - 10 Feb 1788 Lin Shuangwen (in rebellion, rules almost exclusively on Taiwan) nianhao Dec 1786 - 10 Feb 1788: Shuntian 9 Feb 1796 - 2 Sep 1820 Yongyan (b. 1760 - d. 1820) miaohao: Renzong / shi: Rui huangdi nianhao 9 Feb 1796 - 2 Feb 1821: Jiaqing Mar 1797 - 1797 Li Shu (in rebellion) nianhao Mar 1797 - 1797: Daqing 3 Oct 1820 - 25 Feb 1850 Minning (b. 1782 - d. 1850) miaohao: Xuanzong / shi: Cheng huangdi nianhao 3 Feb 1821 - 31 Jan 1851: Daoguang 9 Mar 1850 - 22 Aug 1861 Yizhu (b. 1831 - d. 1861) miaohao: Wenzong / shi: Xian huangdi nianhao 1 Feb 1851 - 29 Jan 1862: Xianfeng 11 Nov 1861 - 12 Jan 1875 Zaichun (b. 1856 - d. 1875) miaohao: Muzong / shi: Yi huangdi nianhao 30 Jan 1862 - 5 Feb 1875: Tongzhi 11 Nov 1861 - 23 Feb 1873 Empress Dowager Cixi (f) (1st time) (b. 1835 - d. 1908) + Empress Dowager Cian (f) (1st time) (b. 1837 - d. 1881) (regents) 25 Feb 1875 - 14 Nov 1908 Zaitian (b. 1871 - d. 1908) miaohao: Dezong / shi: Jing huangdi nianhao 6 Feb 1875 - 21 Jan 1909: Guangxu 25 Feb 1875 - 4 Mar 1889 Empress Dowager Cixi (f) (2nd time) (regent) (s.a.) jointly with 25 Feb 1875 - 8 Apr 1881 Empress Dowager Cian (f) (2nd time) (regent) (s.a.) 21 Sep 1898 - 15 Nov 1908 Empress Dowager Cixi (f) (3rd time) (regent) (s.a.) 2 Dec 1908 - 12 Feb 1912 Puyi (1st time) (b. 1906 - d. 1967) nianhao 22 Jan 1909 - 12 Feb 1912: Xuantong 2 Dec 1908 - 6 Dec 1911 Zaifeng (regent) (b. 1882 - d. 1951) 6 Dec 1911 - 12 Feb 1912 Empress Dowager Longyu (f) (b. 1868 - d. 1913) (holder of the imperial seal) 1 Jul 1917 - 12 Jul 1917 Puyi (2nd time) (s.a.)
