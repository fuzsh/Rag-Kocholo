13 Apr 1975 d. 1975\n\nHe was Head of State to 23 Apr 1962. He was known from 30 Aug 1973 as N'Garta Tombalbaye. François Tombalbaye (Arabic: فرنسوا تومبالباي‎ Franswā Tūmbālbāy; June 15, 1918  April 13, 1975), also known as N'Garta Tombalbaye, was a Chadian teacher and a trade union activist who served as the first president of Chad. The head of Chad's colonial government and its ruling party, the Chadian Progressive Party, after 1959, Tombalbaye was appointed the nation's head of government after its independence on August 11, 1960. He ruled as a dictator until his deposition and assassination by members of the Chadian military in 1975.\n\nHis father was a prominent trader and he was of the Sara ethnic group, the prominent ethnicity of Chad's five southern prefectures. He attended a primary school, run by Protestant missionaries, in Sarh, and secondary school in Brazzaville. As a young man, Tombalbaye studied to become an educator in the Republic of Congo's capital of Brazzaville, due to the lack of in-country schools.\n\nDuring World War II, Tombalbaye fought for Free France against the Nazi-backed Vichy regime.\n\nA further sign of liberalization came in 1971 when Tombalbaye admitted to the Congress of the PPT that he had made mistakes. Steps were taken to reform the government, and more Gorane were included in his new government. Order seemed to have been restored, and France withdrew its troops from the country. During the early 1970s, he chose to follow DRC strongman Mobutu Sese Seko in his move towards remaking African cultural institutions.\n\nProgress came to a grinding halt in August 1971, when an attempted coup d'état with links to Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi was uncovered. Tombalbaye immediately severed relations with his northern neighbor and even allowed anti-Qadhafi forces to operate from his territory. In return, Qadhafi granted formal recognition and aid to what remained of the FROLINAT opposition to Tombalbaye. Meanwhile, in the south, where Tombalbaye had his greatest support, he responded to a strike by students by replacing the popular Chief of Staff Jacques Doumro with Colonel Félix Malloum. Chad was in the grip of a crippling drought, and Tombalbaye rescinded his amnesty to political prisoners. By the end of 1972, over 1,000 political prisoners had been arrested. At the same time, he also made overtures to the Arab world, reducing Libyan support for, and fomenting infighting in, FROLINAT. Meanwhile, the drought worsened throughout Africa, so in order to improve the dismal economy, people were forced to \"volunteer\" in a major effort to increase cotton production. With his support in the south diminished, Tombalbaye lashed out at the army, making arbitrary promotions and demotions. Finally, on April 13, 1975, after some of the country's leading officers had been arrested for involvement in an alleged coup, a group of soldiers killed Tombalbaye and secretly buried his body in Faya. The military-installed Félix Malloum, by then a general, as the new head of state.\n\nTombalbaye belong to PPT and then from 1973 MNRCS. PPT = Parti Progressiste Tchad (Progressive Party of Chad, African nationalist, leftist, Jan 1962 - Jun 1973, only legal party, 1947-1973, renamed MNRCS). The party was founded in February 1947 by Gabriel Lisette, who had been elected to the French National Assembly in elections the previous November. MNRCS = Mouvement National pour la Révolution Culturelle et Sociale (National Movement for the Cultural and Social Revolution, PPT successor, Jun 1973 - 13 Apr 1975 only legal party, 1973-1975). Tombalbaye was overthrown in a coup and the party was banned in April 1975. It was a regional branch of the African Democratic Rally (RDA).\n\nInterim head of state (Military)\n\nNoël Milarew Odingar..............................13 Apr 1975 - 15 Apr 1975 d. 2007\n\nA Sara, Odingar was born in 1932. As a graduate of the French military academy he had a rapid career, and in 1965 Odingar, with the grade of Major, took the post as commander of the Chadian Armed Forces (FAT), a choice that strengthened Sara dominance of the government. Félix Malloum and the other jailed officers were immediately freed by the coupists. Already on 15 April a Supreme Military Council (Conseil Superieur Militaire or CSM) was formed, a nine-member military junta whose President was chosen to be Malloum, who so peacefully succeeded to Odingar as head of state.\n\nChairman Higher Military Council\n\nFélix Malloum N'Gakoutou Bey-Ndi..................15 Apr 1975 - 12 May 1975 d. 2009\n\nFélix Malloum or Félix Malloum Ngakoutou Bey-Ndi (Arabic: فليكس معلوم‎ Filiks Mʿalūm; September 10, 1932  June 12, 2009) was a Chadian politician. He attended the French military academy and saw action in Indochina and Algeria. He later served as an officer in the Chadian Military and a member of the ruling Chadian Progressive Party (PPT). In 1971, he became the Chief of General Staff with the rank of colonel and named Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces in 1972. In July 1973, he was arrested and imprisoned by President François Tombalbaye on charges of conspiring against the government, but was released after a successful coup-d'etat on April 13, 1975. He served as both President and Prime Minister of Chad until August 29, 1978, when Hissène Habré was appointed Prime Minister to integrate armed northern rebels into the government. However, he was unsuccessful and resigned from the presidency on March 23, 1979 after signing the Kano Peace Agreement which allowed the rebels to form a provisional government. Malloum retired from politics and settled in Nigeria. He returned to the Chadian capital N'Djamena on May 31, 2002, after 23 years in exile. Upon his return he was entitled to the various benefits allowed to former presidents. Malloum died from cardiac arrest aged 76 on June 12, 2009 at the American Hospital in Paris, France.\n\nHead of State\n\nFélix Malloum N'Gakoutou Bey-Ndi (continued)......12 May 1975 - 29 Aug 1978\n\nPresident\n\nFélix Malloum N'Gakoutou Bey-Ndi (continued)......29 Aug 1978 - 23 Mar 1979\n\nChairman Provisional Council of State\n\nGoukouni Oueddei (1st time).......................23 Mar 1979 - 29 Apr 1979\n\nGoukouni was installed as interim Chadian head of state on 23 March 1979. He was acclaimed President of the Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT), which sought reconciliation between warring factions, on 10 November 1979. Goukouni, a Cold War neutralist who supported Libya, was Head of State; Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué (a southern moderate) was Vice President; Hissène Habré (a pro-West northerner) was Minister of Defence; and Acyl Ahmat (a strongly pro-Libyan Arab) was Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nPresident of Transitional Government of National Union\n\nLol Mahamat Choua (Lol Mohamed Shawa).............29 Apr 1979 - 03 Sep 1979 d. 2019\n\nHe is the President of the Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) political party. An adherent of Islam and a member of the Kanembu ethnic group, Choua came into power during the First Chadian Civil War. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Chad (MPLT), a Kanembu rebel group backed by Nigeria, along with the central government, the Armed Forces of the North (FAN) and the People's Armed Forces (FAP) were the main combatants. When a peace conference was organized in Kano, Nigeria, the MPLT, which suffered from a lack of members, chose Lol to head its delegation to meeting.\n\nUnder Nigerian pressure, Lol was made head of the Transitional Government of National Unity on April 29, 1979, by the four factions present at Kano. The GUNT included 21 ministers, of whom 11 were northerners and 10 were southerners. Goukouni Oueddei, head of the FAP, became Interior Minister, Hissène Habré became Defence Minister, and Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué, leader of the Chadian Armed Forces (FAT), became vice-president. But the transitional government excluded all the pro-Libyan forces; as a result, a rival government, backed by Muammar al-Gaddafi, was formed; it was called the Democratic Revolutionary Council, and it was headed by Ahmat Acyl, an Arab.\n\nChairman Provisional Administrative Committee\n\nGoukouni Oueddei (2nd time).......................03 Sep 1979 - 10 Nov 1979\n\nPresident of Transitional Government of National Union\n\nGoukouni Oueddei (continued)......................10 Nov 1979 - 07 Jun 1982\n\nChairman Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North\n\nHissène Habré.....................................07 Jun 1982 - 19 Jun 1982\n\nHissène Habré (Arabic: حسين حبري Ḥusaīn Ḥabrī; born 13 September 1942), also spelled Hissen Habré, is a Chadian politician who served as the President of Chad from 1982 until he was deposed in 1990 by Idriss Déby. He was brought to power with the support of France and the United States, who provided training, arms and financing. In May 2016, he was found guilty by a court in Senegal of human-rights abuses, including rape, sexual slavery and ordering the killing of 40,000 people, and sentenced to life in prison. He is the first former head of state to be convicted for human rights abuses in the court of another nation.\n\nChairman Council of the State\n\nHissène Habré (continued).........................19 Jun 1982 - 21 Oct 1982\n\nPresidents\n\nHissène Habré (continued).........................21 Oct 1982 - 01 Dec 1990\n\nJean Alingué Bawoyeu (acting).....................01 Dec 1990 - 02 Dec 1990\n\nJean Alingué Bawoyeu (born on August 18, 1937 at Fort Lamy), known in French as the vieux sage, which translates as \"wise elder\", is a Chadian politician who was Prime Minister of Chad from 1991 to 1992.
