BELGIUM ’S AIM IN THE PRESENT PROCEEDINGS\n\n0.01. The Kingdom of Belgium (hereinafter “B elgium”) wishes to make clear that the\n\nbringing of the present case is in no way an unfriendly act towards the Republic of Senegal\n\n(hereinafter “Senegal”), with which Belgium has long enjoyed excellent relations. Belgium’s aim\n\nis to ensure compliance with the fundamental pr inciple, recognized by Senegal as well as Belgium\n\nand endorsed by the African Union, that perpetra tors of serious crimes under international law,\n\nincluding the crimes of torture and genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, must not go\n\nunpunished. To this end, full compliance with the provisions of the 1984 Convention against\n\nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuma1 or Degradi ng Treatment or Punishment (hereinafter the\n\n“Convention against Torture”) and with other rules of conventional or customary international law\n\nconcerning the autdedere aut judicare obligation is vital. It is in this spirit, and in the hope that\n\nthey will contribute to a solution satisfactory to bo th Parties, that Belgium has initiated the present\n\nproceedings.\n\nII. THE PROCEEDINGS\n\n0.02. By Application dated 16 February 2009 and filed in the Registry of the Court on\n\n19February2009, the Kingdom of Belgium (hereina fter “Belgium”) initiated proceedings against\n\nthe Republic of Senegal (hereinafter “Senegal”) in connection with a dispute concerning the\n\ninterpretation and application of the Convention against Torture and the application of other\n\ncustomary and treaty obligations to punish other serio us crimes under international law. Since late\n\n2000, various proceedings have been opened in Be lgium to bring to justice Mr.Habré, a former\n\nPresident of Chad now in Senegal, to answer fo r acts ascribed to him which may be characterized\n\n8 as, in particular, crimes of torture and other serious crimes under international law. Since 2005\n\nBelgium has been asking Senegal to try Mr.Habré, if not extradite him. Senegal has yet to give\n\nany concrete response to Belgium’s requests.\n\n0.03. Belgium considers Senegal to be under an obligation to prosecute Mr. Habré for crimes\n\nof torture and other serious crimes under interna tional law which have been ascribed to him as\n\nperpetrator, co-perpetrator or accomplice or, if Se negal fails to prosecute Mr.Habré, to extradite\n\nhim to Belgium so that he can stand trial in the Belgian courts for these crimes.\n\n0.04. The Court’s jurisdiction is founded on Article 30 of the Convention against Torture and\n\non the declarations recognizing the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court made by Belgium and\n\n2\n\nSenegal in accordance with Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court .\n\n0.05. On 19 February 2009, after filing its A pplication instituting proceedings, Belgium also\n\nsubmitted a request for the indication of provision al measures in accordance with Article 41 of the\n\nStatute of the Court and Articles 73 to 75 of the Rules of Court. Alarmed by comments made by\n\nthe President of Senegal, Mr.A.Wade, to the effect that Senegal might end Mr.Habré’s house\n\narrest if it did not find the funds it deemed necess ary to hold his trial, Belgium filed a request for\n\nthe indication of provisional measures. In that request Belgium asked the Court, pending its final\n\n1\n\nUnited Nations, Treaty Series (UNTS), Vol. 1465, p. 123 (1-24841), Ann. A.1.\n\n2\n\nAnn. A.2. - 2 -\n\ndecision on the merits, to indicate that Senegal was to take all measures in its power to ensure that\n\nMr. Habré remained under the control and surveillance of the Senegalese authorities . 3\n\n0.06. At the hearings on the request for the indication of provisional measures, which took\n\nplace on 6, 7 and 8April2009, Senegal, in answer to a question put by a Member of the Court,\n\naffirmed that it would not allow Mr. Habré to leave Senegalese territory. These assurances given to\n\nthe Court were expressed as follows in paragraphs 38 and 68 of the Order:\n\n9 “38. Whereas, in response to the questi on put by a Member of the Court at the\n\nhearings, referred to in paragraph33 above, Senegal solemnly declared that it would\n\nnot allow Mr4Habré to leave its territory while the present case was pending before\n\nthe Court” ; and\n\n“68. . . . whereas the Co-Agent of Senegal, at the end of the hearings, solemnly\n\ndeclared, in response to a question put by a Member of the Court, the following:\n\n‘Senegal will not allow Mr.Habré to leave Senegal while the\n\npresent case is pending before the Court. Senegal has not the intention to\n\nallow Mr.Habré to leave the territory while the present case is pending\n\n5\n\nbefore the Court.’”\n\nThe Court also observed in its Order that:\n\n“in response to a question put by a Member of the Court at the hearings, Belgium\n\nindicated that a solemn declaration made befo re the Court by the Agent of Senegal, in\n\nthe name of his Government, could be suffi cient for Belgium to consider that its\n\nRequest for the indication of provisiona l measures had no further raison d’être,\n\nprovided that such a declaration would be clear and unconditional, and that it would\n\nguarantee that all the necessary measures woul d be taken by Senegal to ensure that\n\nMr.Habré did not leave Senegalese territory before the Court delivered its final\n\n6\n\nJudgment . . .” .\n\n0.07. By reason of these assurances, solemnly given by Senegal before the Court, the Court,\n\nin an Order made on 28 May 2009 and “taking note of the[se] assurances given by Senegal, [found]\n\nthat the risk of irreparable prejudice to the ri ghts claimed by Belgium [was] not apparent on the\n\n7\n\ndate of [the] Order” and held that the circumstances, as they then presented themselves to the\n\nCourt, were not such as to require the exercise of its power under Article41 of the Statute to\n\nindicate provisional measures . The Court did nonetheless note that its Order “leaves unaffected\n\n10 Belgium’s right to submit in future a fresh request for the indication of provisional measures, under\n\nArticle 75, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court, based on new facts” . 9\n\nRequest for the indication of provisional measures, p. 2, Ann. C.8.\n\nQuestions relating to the Obligation toProsecute or Ex tradite (Belgium v. Senegal), Provisional Measures,\n\nOrder of 28 May 2009, para. 38.\n\n5\n\nIbid., para. 68. This assurance was given in English; CR 2009/11, 7 Apr. 2009, p. 23, para. 6.\n\n6\n\nQuestions relating to the Obligation toProsecute or Ex tradite (Belgium v. Senegal), Provisional Measures,\n\nOrder of 28 May 2009, para. 33.\n\n7\n\nIbid., para. 72.\n\nIbid., para. 76.\n\nIbid., para. 75. - 3 -\n\n0.08. After consultation with the Parties, the Court handed down an Order on 9July2009\n\nauthorizing the submissio10of a Memorial by Belgium on 9 July 2010 and a Counter-Memorial by\n\nSenegal on 11 July 2011 . This Memorial is being presented pursuant to that Order.\n\n0.09. By letter dated the same day, the Regist rar of the Court asked Belgium and Senegal to\n\nprovide to the Court as quickly as possible a document containing a detailed summary of the\n\ninformation in their possession in regard to certain new developments since the Court had made its\n\nOrder on the Request for the indication of provisional measures; those developments concerned:\n\n⎯ the various measures taken by Senegal to ensure that Mr. Habré’s trial would be held as soon\n\nas possible;\n\n⎯ the Parties’ diplomatic exchanges aimed at facilitating co-operation between them for the\n\npurposes of that trial; and\n\n⎯ Senegal’s approaches to the African Union and the European Union with a view to securing\n\nfunding for the trial.\n\n0.10. Belgium replied to the Court’s request for information by letter dated 16July2009,\n\ncommunicated to the Registry though diplomatic channels on 28 July 2009.\n\n0.11. By letter dated 15June2010, Senegal transmitted to the Court a “Note on the latest\n\ndevelopments in Senegal’s preparations for the tr ial of Mr. Hissène Habré since the delivery of the\n\nOrder of 28May2009 on the request for the indication of provisional measures submitted by\n\n11 Belgium” (hereinafter the “Note on the latest developments”), accompanied by a number of\n\nannexes .11\n\nIII. THE STRUCTURE OF THE M EMORIAL\n\n0.12. The present Memorial is divided into five chapters.\n\n0.13. Chapter I sets out the facts underlying the present dispute. It summarizes:\n\n⎯ conditions in Chad during Mr.Habré’s presidenc y; though not at the heart of the dispute\n\nbetween Belgium and Senegal, that situation is nevertheless important, forming as it does the\n\nbasis of the criminal proceedings initiated in Senegal and Belgium against the former President\n\nof Chad;\n\n⎯ Belgium’s efforts to prevail upon and help Se negal to fulfil its obligation to prosecute\n\nMr. Habré or, if not, to extradite him; these efforts brought the dispute between the two States\n\nto the fore; and\n\n⎯ the referral of the matter to the African Union and developments since the Union’s intervention\n\nin the Habré case.\n\n10\n\nQuestions relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite (Belgium v. Senegal), Order of 9 July 2009.\n\n1Note on the latest developments in Se negal’s preparations for the trial of Mr. Hissène Habré since the delivery\n\nof the Order of 28May 2009 on the request for the indication of provisional measures submitted by Belgium,\n\n15 June 2010, Ann. D.9. - 4 -\n\n0.14. Chapter II recapitulates the decisions: by th e Committee against Torture regarding\n\nthe Habré case; and by the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights and by the Community\n\nCourt of Justice of the Economic Community of West African States.\n\nI.15. Chapter III Belgium shows that the Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate the present\n\ndispute. This jurisdiction is founded on Article30 of the Convention against Torture and on the\n\ndeclarations recognizing as compulsory the jurisdiction of the Court made by Belgium and Senegal\n\nin accordance with Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court.\n\n0.16. Chapter IV establishes that, in failing to prosecute or extradite Mr. Habré, Senegal has\n\n12\n\nbreached, and continues to breach, obligations it bears under the Convention against Torture and\n\nunder the rules of conventional and customary inte rnational law. In particular, Senegal has\n\nbreached the obligations under Artic le5, paragraph2, of the Convention against Torture. It has\n\nalso breached, and continues to breach, its obligation to prosecute or extradite pursuant to Article 7,\n\nparagraph1, of that Convention and the closely related obligation in Artic le 6, paragraph 2.\n\nFurthermore, Senegal has not complied with the obligation international law imposes on States to\n\ncombat impunity in respect of persons present in their territory and suspected of having committed\n\nserious crimes under international law.\n\nI.n17. Chapter V Belgium shows that Senegal has in curred international responsibility by\n\nvirtue of these breaches of international law. Th is responsibility is neither set aside nor tempered\n\nby financial, legal or other difficulties faced by Senegal in organizing Mr. Habré’s trial. Senegal is\n\ntherefore under a duty to cease its breaches and it must fulfil its international obligations.\n\nSpecifically, it must submit the Habré case to its competent authorities so that criminal proceedings\n\ncan be conducted or, if it fails to prosecute Mr. Habré, it must extradite him to Belgium.\n\n0.18. Lastly, Belgium will present its submissions.13 C HAPTER I\n\nT HE FACTS\n\n12\n\nI. HAD UNDER M R. HABRÉ\n\n1.01. Chad, a former French colony that w as part of French Equatorial Africa, gained\n\nindependence in 1960 under the presidency of Fran çois Tombalbaye, who hailed from the southern\n\npart of the country. From 1968 onwards, eastern and northern areas of Chad took up arms against a\n\ngovernment seen as being too close to the people from the south. Mr. Tombalbaye sought France’s\n\nhelp in quelling the insurrection. He was as sassinated in 1975 after a coup instigated by\n\nGeneral Félix Malloum, who seized power.\n\n1.02. Mr. Hissène Habré, a member of the Toubou ethnic group (which lives in the Tibesti in\n\nnorthern Chad), became Prime Minister of Chad in August 1978. He and Mr. Goukouni Oueddei\n\nwere the leaders of FROLINAT ( Front de libération nationale du Tchad or National Liberation\n\nFront of Chad), an armed movement founded in Sudan to oppose the régime, which was thought to\n\nfavour southerners.\n\n1.03. Mr. Habré’s term as Prime Minister came to an end when General Malloum was forced\n\nto relinquish the presidency of Chad in 1979 and cede his place to Mr.Oueddei, who, like\n\nMr.Habré, comes from the Tibesti. Mr.Ouedde i formed a Transitional Government of National\n\nUnity (Gouvernement d’unité nationale et de transition (“GUNT”)), in which Mr. Habré served as\n\nMinister of State for Defence.\n\n1.04. Relations between Messrs. Oueddei a nd Habré could however be likened to those\n\nbetween rivals, since both claimed to lead FROLINAT and the Toubou rebels.\n\n1.05. In 1980 FROLINAT units calling themselves the Armed Forces of the North ( Forces\n\nArmées du Nord (“FAN”)) and under Mr.Habré’s lead ership waged war on Mr.Oueddei’s\n\nPeople’s Armed Forces ( Forces Armeés Populaires (“FAP”)). The FAP prevailed and Mr. Habré\n\n14 was forced to take refuge in eastern Chad, at the Sudanese border. Libyan troops which had\n\nsupported the GUNT withdrew in November 1981 and remained present only in the north in the\n\nAouzou Strip. Meanwhile, the FAN re-grouped and re-armed and regained control over areas in\n\neastern and central Chad. On 7 June 1982, the FAN entered N’Djamena, meeting virtually no\n\nresistance from the FAP. Mr. Oueddei left Chad and Mr. Habré became the new President.\n\n1.06. Mr.Habré abolished the office of Prim e Minister on 19 June 1982. A number of\n\npolitical opponents were executed. He transfor med the FAN into the National Armed Forces of\n\nChad (Forces armées nationales du Tchad (“FANT”)) and established a political police force: the\n\nDocumentation and Security Directorate ( Direction de la documentation et de la sécurité\n\n(“DDS”)).\n\n1Unless otherwise stated, the information in this section is Keesing’s Contemporary Archives ,\n\n1979-1982, and the Report of the National Commission of Inquiry of the Chadian Ministry of Justice on “The Crimes and\n\nMisappropriations Committed by ex-PresidentHabré, his Accomplices and/or Accessories” [ Rapport de la Commission\n\nd’enquête nationale du ministère tchadien de la Justice sur Les crimes et détournements de l’ex-Président Habré et de ses\n\ncomplices], Paris, L’Harmattan, 1993. [TranslatoFor an English translation of the RepoTransitional\n\nJustice (ed. N. J. Kritz), Vol. III, Washington D.C., U.S. Institute of Peace Press, 1995, pp. 51-93.] - 6 -\n\n1.07. In 1983 Mr. Habré called for French help in fighting Libyan forces which had returned\n\nto Chad. In 1987, Chad’s military succeeded in driving the Libyan forces out of the country,\n\nexcept for the Aouzou Strip, from which Libyan forces did not withdraw until 1994, further to the\n\n13\n\nCourt’s Judgment of 3 February 1994 .\n\n1.08. Mr.Habré remained in power until 1990. A new rebel movement (the “Patriotic\n\nSalvation Movement” (“ Mouvement patriotique du salut ” ⎯ MPS)), formed in Sudan by\n\nMr.IdrissDéby, a former defence and security adviser to Mr.Habré, ousted Mr.Habré from\n\npower. He took refuge in Senegal. Mr. Déby is still President of Chad.\n\n1.09. Many various human rights violations were reported in Chad during Mr.Habré’s\n\npresidency: arrests of actual or presumed politi cal opponents, detentions without trial, inhumane\n\n14\n\ndetention conditions, mistreatment, torture, extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances .\n\n1.10. According to an assessment published in 1993 by the National Commission of Inquiry\n\nof the Chadian Ministry of Justice, Mr. Habré’s pr esidency produced tens of thousands of victims.\n\nThe Commission gives the following figures:\n\n15 “⎯ more than 40,000 victims;\n\n⎯ more than 80,000 orphans;\n\n⎯ more than 30,000 widows;\n\n⎯ more than 200,000 people left with no mo ral or material support as a result of this\n\n15\n\nrepression” .\n\nII. THE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST M R. HABRÉ IN SENEGAL\n\n1.11. On 25 January 2000, seven Chadian nationals residing in Chad, together with the\n\nChadian Association of Victims of Political Repression and Crime ( Association des Victimes des\n\nCrimes et Répressions Politiques (“AVCRP”)), filed a complaint with civil-party application\n\n(constitution de partie civile1) against Mr. Habré with the senior investigating judge at the Dakar\n\n17\n\nTribunal régional hors classe .\n\n13Territorial Dispute (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Chad), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1994, p. 6.\n\n14\n\nSee the Amnesty International A nnual Reports, French editions, between 1983 and 1990: Report 1983,\n\npp. 116-117; Report 1984, pp. 124-128; Report 1985, pp. 132- 135; Report 1986, pp. 111-114; Report 1987, pp. 83-84;\n\nReport 1988, pp. 98-100; Report 1989, pp. 97-99. [ Translator’s note: Citations to the French version of these Reports\n\nhave been retained, given the difficulty in obtaining the English equivalents.]\n\n15Report by the National Commission of Inquiry of the Chadian Ministry of Justice on “The Crimes and\n\nMisappropriations Committed by ex-President Habré, his Accomplices and/or Accessories”, op. cit. (footnote 12), p. 92.\n\n16\n\nUnder Roman-Germanic law, this refers to: the filing of a complaint with an investigating judge in respect of a\n\ncrime or other offence by an individclaiming to have been injured as a result of that crime or offence; and the\n\nresulting initiation of criminal proceedings if such have not already been commenced. The civil party may participate in\n\nthe proceedings by receiving a hearing and may ask the court trying the case to award damages for the injury caused by\n\nthe crime or other offence.\n\n17Ann. D.1. - 7 -\n\n1.12. On 3February2000, the investigating judge indicted Mr.Habré for complicity in\n\n“crimes against humanity and acts of torture and barbarity” 18. A few weeks later, the prosecuting\n\n19\n\nauthorities, who had been in favour of Mr. Habré’s prosecution , reversed position and supported\n\nhis application to the Chambre d’accusation of the Dakar Court of Appeal to annul the\n\n20\n\nproceedings . Furthermore, the Conseil supérieur de la Magistrature (Judicial Service Council)\n\ntransferred the investigating judge, thereby removing him from the case . 21\n\n1.13. On 4 July 2000, the Chambre d’accusation annulled the proceedings on the ground that\n\nthey concerned crimes committed abroad by an alien against aliens and that they would involve the\n\n16 exercise of universal jurisdiction, whereas the Senegalese Code of Criminal Procedure did not\n\nprovide for jurisdiction of this sort (Art. 669) .22\n\n1.14. Following the dismissal of the proceedings, two Special Rapporteurs from the United\n\nNations Commission on Human Rights ⎯ Mr. Dato ParamCumaraswamy, Special Rapporteur on\n\nthe independence of judges and lawyers, and SirNigelRodley, Special Rapporteur23n torture ⎯\n\nmade known to Senegal their “concern” over the “circumstances” surrounding the decision.\n\nAccording to a press release dated 2August2000: “The Special Rapporteurs reminded the\n\nGovernment of Senegal of its obligations under the Convention against Torture . . ., to which it is\n\nparty”; and\n\n“[t]hey also draw its attention to the resolution adopted this year by the Commission\n\non Human Rights on the question of torture (resolution2000/43), in which the\n\nCommission stressed the general responsibility of all States to examine all allegations\n\nof torture and to ensure that those who encourage, order, tolerate or pe\n\nrpetrate such\n\n24\n\nacts be held responsible and severely punished” .\n\n1.15. The complainants lodged an appeal with the Court of Cassation, which rejected it and\n\non 20 March 2001 upheld the judgment to annul by the Chambre d’accusation . 25\n\n1.16.

On 16September2008, after constitu tional and statutory amendments had been\n\n17 28\n\neffected in 2007 , 14 individuals (inc luding a Senegalese citizen resident in Dakar, 11Chadian\n\ncitizens resident in Chad, and two Chadian citizens one of them resident in France and the other in\n\nthe United States of America) filed a complaint against Mr.Habré for crimes against humanity,\n\ntorture and complicity in those crimes. The complaint was addressed to the Procureur général\n\n(Chief Public Prosecutor) at the Dakar Court of Appeal 29. No action has yet (at the end of\n\nJune 2010) been taken on it.\n\nIII.T HE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST\n\nM R. HABRÉ IN B ELGIUM\n\n1.19. The legal proceedings against Mr. Habré in Belgium began on 30November2000,\n\nwhen a Belgian citizen of Chadian descent submitted a complaint with civil-party application\n\nagainst Mr. Habré to a Belgian investigating judge; two other Belgians of Chadian descent did the\n\nsame on 12 April and 3 May 2001; ten Chadian citi zens living in Chad also filed a complaint, on\n\n24 April 2001 .0\n\n1.20. The complaints were based on crimes c overed by the Belgian Law of 16June1993\n\nconcerning the punishment of serious violations of international humanitarian law, as amended by\n\nthe Law of 10February1999 31 (hereinafter the “1993/1999 Law”), and on crimes of torture\n\ncovered by the 1984 Convention . 32\n\n1.21. In response to these complaints, the inv estigating judge found that the acts complained\n\nof could be characterized as “crimes against humanity” under the 1993 Law and on\n\n19 September 2001 issued two international letters rogatory, one to Senegal and the other to Chad.\n\n18 1.22. The first was destined for the Senegalese authorities with a view to obtaining a copy of\n\nthe record 33om the proceedings conducted by a Senegalese investigating judg34looking into similar\n\ncomplaints ; it was transmitted by Note Verbale dated 10 October 2001 .\n\n1.23. On 22 November 2001, the Senegalese au thorities dispatched a file of papers and\n\ndocuments to Belgium concerning the proceedings in Senegal in the Habré case.\n\n27Human Rights Watch, Chad: The Victims of Hissène Habré Still Aw aiting Justice , July 2005, Vol.17,\n\nNo. 10 (A), p. 20, http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2005/07/11/chad-victims-hiss-ne-habr-stil…; Le\n\nTémoin, No. 553, 27 Mar.-2 Apr. 2001, Ann.

The second letter rogatory ⎯ the one sent to the Chadian authorities ⎯ contained\n\nrequests that:\n\n⎯ the Chadian complainants, the members of the Commission of Inquiry into the crimes ascribed\n\nto Mr. Habré, and various witnesses be examined;\n\n⎯ a copy of the Commission of Inquiry papers and documents be provided;\n\n⎯ the sites identified by the complainants and the Commission of Inquiry be inspected;\n\n⎯ those papers and documents which were helpful to the investigation and discovered during the\n\nletter rogatory proceedings be transferred to Belgium;\n\n⎯ Belgian representatives from the prosecutor’s office and the registry of the Brussels Tribunal\n\nde première instance and investigators from the Belgian federal police force be permitted to\n\nattend when the letter rogatory was carried out . 35\n\nThis letter rogatory was executed in Chad by the Belgian investigating judge between\n\n26 February and 8 March 2002 . 36\n\n1.25. On 27 March 2002, the Belgian investigating judge asked the Chadian Minister of\n\n37\n\nJustice whether Mr.Habré enjoyed immunity from jurisdiction as a former Head of State . On\n\n7 October 2002, the Minister of Justice of Chad responded to the effect that the Sovereign National\n\n19\n\nConference held in N’Djamena from 15 January to 38April 1993 had “officially lifted all immunity\n\nfrom legal process from Mr. Hissein Habré” .\n\n1.26. Between 2002 and 2005, various investiga tive steps were taken in Belgium; these\n\nincluded examining complainants and witnesses, and analysing very many of the documents\n\nprovided by the Chadian authorities in execution of the letter rogatory referred to above. These\n\ndocuments in total take up some 27 binder files, which constitute the judicial record in Belgium.\n\n1.27. On 23 February 2003, PresidentWade confirmed that an extradition request could be\n\nsubmitted to the Senegalese judicial authorities, and stated that, if it were up to him alone, the\n\n39\n\nextradition would be approved, but that he had not yet received any request for extradition .\n\n1.28. On 19 September 2005, the Belgian inves tigating judge issued an international warrant\n\nin absentia for the arrest of Mr.Habré “as the perp etrator or co-perpetrator” of crimes under\n\ninternational humanitarian law. The warrant was circ ulated by Interpol (red notice) to Senegal; in\n\n40\n\naccordance with Interpol practice (Belgium and Senegal having been members of Interpol since\n\n35Ann.

The warrant sets out, inter alia , the complainants’ names, the substance of their\n\n42\n\ncomplaints and the various bases for the jurisdiction of the Belgian judge; in respect of those\n\nbases, the warrant states that:\n\n⎯ ratione materiae , the acts in question amount to ser ious violations of international\n\nhumanitarian law and the Belgian judge has ju risdiction over them pursuant to the 1993/1999\n\nLaw; furthermore, that the acts complained of by the complainants actually took place is\n\n20 confirmed in the above-cited report by the Commission of Inquiry of the Chadian Ministry of\n\nJustice, published in 1993 43; finally, the fact that serious violations of international\n\nhumanitarian law were made crimes under Be lgian domestic law in 1993 and 1999 does not\n\nconstitute a violation of the principle of non-re troactivity of penal laws, since these were\n\ncrimes under international law at the time the acts in question were committed ; 44\n\n⎯ ratione loci , the 1993/1999 Law confers universal ju risdiction on the Belgian judge over\n\nserious violations of international humanitari an law; the Law of 5August2003, which\n\nrestricted the ambit of this jurisdiction as it was initially provided for in the 1993/1999 Law,\n\nimposes no bar to such universal jurisd iction, because the 2003 Law provides that\n\ninvestigations begun before its entry into force may be pursued if they follow from complaints\n\nfiled by Belgians ; 45\n\n⎯ ratione personae, the judge retains jurisdiction in respect of Mr. Habré inasmuch as Mr. Habré\n\nhas enjoyed no immunity ever since he ceased to be President of Chad and as Chad itself has,\n\n46\n\nin so far as is necessary, lifted the immunities which Mr. Habré may have sought to claim ;\n\n⎯ ratione temporis, the facts being investigated occurred while Mr. Habré was President of Chad,\n\nbetween 1982 and 1990, but they are not tim e-barred because crimes under international\n\nhumanitarian law are involved and there is no statute of limitations on these under international\n\n47\n\nlaw as it has been incorporated into Belgian domestic law .\n\n1.30. Finally, it is noted in the warrant that there is a great deal of evidence indicating that\n\nthe events described in the co mplaints actually took place and justifying further action by the\n\ninvestigating judge upon the complaints . 48\n\n1.31. Accordingly, the warrant states, if Mr .Habré were to remain at liberty, he might\n\n21\n\ninterfere with the course of the investigation or destroy evidence. The warrant therefore calls for\n\nhis arrest .9\n\n41\n\nAnn. C.6.\n\n42\n\nAnn.

As Mr. Habré continues to reside in Sene gal, the other procedural matters in respect of\n\nhim concern Belgium’s requests to Senegal to extr adite or prosecute, such requests having given\n\nrise to the present dispute between the two States .50\n\nIV. B ELGIUM ’S EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE AND HELP S ENEGAL TO FULFIL\n\nITS OBLIGATION TO PROSECUTE OR EXTRADITE\n\n1.33 The present dispute arises out of the failure of the Senegalese authorities to carry out the\n\nextradition requested by Belgium despite the fact that Senegal is required, by virtue of its\n\ninternational obligations, to extradite Mr. Habré if it does not try him in Senegal. Senegal’s replies\n\nto the Belgian Notes Verbales and requests, and the absence of any concrete measure to bring the\n\nH. Habré case before the competent judicial authorities, show that it has breached and continues to\n\nbreach its international obligations to prosecute Mr. Habré or, failing prosecution, to extradite him\n\nto a State which has so requested.\n\n1.34 On 22 September 2005, Belgium transmitted a Note Verbale to Senegal containing the\n\ninternational arrest warrant in absentia issued by the Belgian investigating judge against Mr. Habré\n\nfor crimes of torture, crimes of genocide, war crimes, murder, and intentional assault and battery . 51\n\nSenegal failed to reply.\n\n1.35. Two months later, on 16 November 2005, Belgium informed Senegal that members of\n\nthe Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office could go to Dakar\n\n22 “to give additional information about the request for extradition against Hissène Habré\n\nif the Senegalese authorities so wished” .52\n\nIt added that it would be grateful to receive a reply from the competent authorities with a\n\nview to informing the Belgian Federal Public Service 53 concerned .54\n\n1.36. On 25 November 2005, the Chambre d’accusation of the Dakar Court of Appeal ruled\n\non the request for extradition transmitted by Note Verbale from Belgium to Senegal, and dated\n\n22 September 2005 . In its judgment of 25 November 2005, the Chambre d’accusation found that\n\nArticle 101 of the Constitution and the Organic Law on the High Court of Justice\n\n“instituted a special procedure falling outside the scope of the ordinary law for any\n\nproceedings brought against the President of the Republic”\n\nand\n\n“that consequently the Chambre d’accusation , a court of ordinary law, cannot extend\n\nits jurisdiction to matters relating to the investigation or prosecution of a Head of State\n\nfor acts allegedly committed in the exercise of his functions”.\n\n5See paras. 1.34 et seq. below.\n\n5Ann. B.2. See also paras. 1.28-1.32 above.\n\n52\n\nAnn. B.3.\n\n53\n\nThe official title of a “Ministry” in Belgium is “Federal Public Service”.\n\n5Ann. B.3.\n\n5Ann. B.2. See also Ann. C.7. - 12 -\n\nAccording to the Chambre d’accusation , “HissèneHabré should therefore be given\n\njurisdictional immunity such as to survive the cessation of his duties as President of the Republic,\n\nwhatever his nationality and regardless of any convention on mutual assistance”; the Chambre\n\nconcluded that it had no jurisdic tion “to adjudicate the lawfulness of proceedings and the validity\n\nof the arrest warrant against the Head of State” . The judgment ends with a cryptic phrase inviting\n\n57\n\n“the Office of the Public Prosecutor to make a better case” .\n\n1.37. On 30 November 2005, Belgium, havi ng taken note of the judgment of 25 November,\n\nrequested Senegal, by Note Verbale, to reply to the following questions:\n\n23 ⎯ “What are the implications of this judicial decision” for Belgium’s request for extradition?\n\n⎯ “What is the current stage of the proceedings?”\n\n⎯ Could Senegal reply officially “to the request for extradition” and provide “explanations about\n\n58\n\nthe position of the Senegalese Government pursuant to this decision”?\n\n59\n\n1.38. By Note Verbale of 7December2005 , Senegal transmitted to Belgium a\n\ncommuniqué of the Senegalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs “concerning the Hissène Habré case” 60.\n\nThe communiqué referred to Belgium’s request fo r extradition, the above-mentioned61udgment of\n\n25 November 2005 by the Chambre d’accusation concerning that request , and the referral of the\n\ncase to the African Union. The Note Verbale specified that\n\n⎯ Senegal agreed to host Mr. Habré “without ever trying to protect him from the law”;\n\n⎯ thus, it remained committed “to its traditional values of hospitality”, but also remained attached\n\n“to the principles of justice and democracy”;\n\n⎯ “furthermore” it had referred the matter to the African Union Summit, which\n\n⎯ “prefigures a concerted approach on an African scale of issues that fall in principle under\n\nthe States’ national sovereignty”,\n\n⎯ contributes “to the continent’s political integration”,\n\n⎯ consolidates “justice and the rule of law in Africa”, and\n\n62\n\n24 ⎯ encourages “compliance with rules of good governance” .\n\n1.39. On 23 December 2005, the Senegalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to the Notes\n\nVerbales sent by Belgium in November 2005 concer ning the H. Habré case. The Ministry referred\n\nto the judgment delivered by the Chambre d’accusation of the Dakar Court of Appeal and pointed\n\n56Ann. B.2. See also Ann. C.7.\n\n57Ibid.\n\n58\n\nAnn. B.4.\n\n59\n\nAnn.

By Note Verbale of 11January2006, sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of\n\nSenegal, the Embassy of Belgium in Dakar obser ved that the Convention against Torture, and\n\nspecifically the obligation aut dedere aut judicare, imposed obligations only on States parties, that\n\nis, in the context of the request for the extradition of Mr.Habré, on Senegal; in particular, the\n\nEmbassy wished to be notified of the “final decision” of Senegal “to grant or refuse the...\n\nextradition application” concerning Mr. Habré . 64\n\nSenegal did not reply to this Note Verbale.\n\n1.41. On 9March2006, Belgium, through its Embassy in Dakar, referred to four earlier\n\nNotes Verbales (16November2005 65, 30 November 2005, 23 December 2005, 11 January 2006)\n\nand requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Senegal to “be so kind as to inform it as to\n\nwhether its decision to transfer the Hissène Habré case to the African Union is to be interpreted as\n\nmeaning that the Senegalese authorities no longer intend to extradite him to Belgium or to have\n\n66\n\nhim judged by their own courts” .\n\n25 1.42. On 4 May 2006, the Ambassador of Senegal in Brussels was summoned to the Belgian\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs 67 for talks with the Director-General of Legal Affairs. During those\n\ntalks, he was given a Note Verbale expressing\n\n“the concern of the Belgian Government w ith regard to the ab sence of an official\n\nreaction by the Senegalese authorities to th e repeated applications by the Belgian\n\nGovernment, to which there has been no response to date, with a view to obtaining the\n\nextradition from Senegal to Belgium of fo rmer PresidentHissèneHabré, who is\n\n68\n\nwanted for serious violations of international humanitarian law” .\n\nThe Note Verbale from the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that “former\n\nPresidentHissèneHabré fled to Senegal in 1990” and that Belgium’s request for extradition “was\n\nsent to the Senegalese authorities in September 2005”. However, in spite of\n\n“verbal notes and personal approaches by the Embassy of Belgium in Dakar on\n\n30 November 2005, 11 January 2006 and, once again, on 10March2006, the\n\nSenegalese authorities have not advised the Belgian Government as to whether or not\n\n69\n\nthey have decided to extradite Hissène Habré to Belgium” .\n\nIn the opinion of the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, “the decision to pass the\n\nHissène Habré case on to the African Union does not . . . relieve Senegal of its obligation to either\n\n63Ann.B.6.

Senegal replied to that Note Verbal e by Note Verbale addressed to the Belgian\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs on 9 May 2006 75, in which Senegal expressed the view that the Notes\n\n76\n\nVerbales of 7 and 23 December 2005 answered Belgium’s questions and added\n\n⎯ concerning the interpretation of Article 7 of the Convention against Torture\n\n“that by transferring the HissèneHabré case to the African Union, Senegal, in order\n\nnot to create a legal impasse, is acting in accordance with the sp irit of the principle\n\n‘aut dedere aut punire’ the essential aim of which is to ensure that no torturer can\n\nescape from justice by going to another country” ; 77\n\n⎯ “[that] by taking this case to the highest level on the continent, Senegal, while respecting the\n\nseparation of powers and the independence of its judicial authorities, has thus opened78p\n\nthroughout Africa new prospects for upholding human rights and combating impunity” ;\n\n⎯ that it “[takes] note” of “the possibility of Belgium having recourse to the arbitration procedure\n\nprovided for in Article 30 of the Convention agains t Torture”, but restates “the commitment of\n\n27 Senegal to the excellent relationship between the two countries in terms of co-operation and the\n\ncombating of impunity”.\n\n1.44. On 20June2006, Belgium, through its Embassy in Dakar, wrote to the Senegalese\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs to remind it of the two Belgian Notes Verbales of November 2005 and\n\n70\n\nAnn.

Senegal acknowledged that\n\nthose Notes fell within the framework of the ne gotiations provided for by Article30 of the\n\nConvention against Torture with regard to the Belg ian request for the extradition of Mr.Habré.\n\nBelgium recalled that its Note of 4May2006 no ted the existence of “an unresolved dispute”\n\nregarding the interpretation of Article 7 of the 1984Convention, which should lead to recourse to\n\nthe arbitration procedure provided for in Article30 of that Convention 80. Senegal had moreover\n\nreferred to this “in its reply of 981ay . . . while reiterating its differing interpretation of the relevant\n\nprovisions of said Convention” .\n\nAccording to Belgium, “the attempted ne gotiation with Senegal, which started in\n\nNovember 2005, has not succeeded and, in accordance with Article 30.1 of the Torture Convention,\n\n[Belgium] consequently asks Senegal to submit the dispute to arbitration under conditions to be\n\n82\n\nagreed mutually” .\n\n1.45. Senegal did not reply to this Note Verbale of 20 June 2006 and did not resume contact\n\nwith Belgium until 20 February 2007. On that date, the Senegalese Embassy in Brussels informed\n\nthe Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Sene gal’s Council of Ministers, on 9 November 2006,\n\nhad submitted two bills amending the Senegalese Pena l Code and Code of Criminal Procedure “to\n\nallow the prosecution and judgment of Mr.HissèneHabré in Senegal” 83; these bills “were\n\nscheduled for adoption by the Senegalese Natio nal Assembly during its plenary meeting of\n\n2 February 2007” . In addition, “on 23 November 2006 already, a National Commission charged\n\nwith defining the conditions of Mr.Habré’s tria l was established”; it was to “[examine] all the\n\n28 85\n\nlegal, judicial, diplomatic, security and fi nancial implications . . . of said trial” . The Senegalese\n\nEmbassy cited a decision by the Summit of the African Union which commended Senegal for its\n\nefforts regarding “the implementation of the Banjul Decision”, encouraged it “to pursue its\n\ninitiatives to accomplish the mandate entrusted to it”, and appealed to the international community\n\nto mobilize the “financial resources required” for the trial 86. On 21 February 2007, the Senegalese\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the above-mentioned points and indicated that the National\n\nAssembly of Senegal had adopted these two bills on 31 January 2007; it added: “With these two\n\ntexts, Senegal is filling the legal vacuum which, for technical reasons related to the unsuitability of\n\n87\n\nnational legislation, had prevented the Senegalese courts from hearing the Hissène Habré case.”\n\n1.46. The crime of torture had been intr oduced into Senegalese criminal law by Law\n\nNo. 96-15 of 28 August 1996, but it had been necess ary to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure\n\nin order to enable the Senegalese courts to exer cise universal jurisdiction; this was done by new\n\nlaws which, in addition, declared the non-applicability of statutory limitation to the crimes\n\nprovided for in the Statute of the International Criminal Court.

Moreover, in its Note Verbale of 21 February 2007, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of\n\nSenegal observed that “the principle of non-retr oactivity” does not block the sentencing of any\n\nindividual found guilty of acts “considered criminal under the general principles of law recognized\n\nby all States” . Senegal also established “a working group charged with producing the proposals\n\nnecessary to define the conditions and procedures suitable for prosecuting and judging the former\n\nPresident of Chad, on behalf of Africa, with the guarantees of a just and fair trial” . 91\n\nOn this basis\n\n⎯ “a special system must be established from the in frastructure, legislative and administrative\n\nstandpoint to bring it into conformity with the hi ghest relevant standards and enable a fair trial\n\n92\n\nto be held” ;\n\n⎯ steps must be taken to facilitate letters of re quest and the working stays abroad of judicial\n\n93\n\npersonnel “for purposes of investigation” ;\n\n⎯ the broadest possible accessibility must be assured fo r persons interested in the trial, as well as\n\nthe use of information and communication technologies ; 94\n\n95\n\n⎯ the “highest degree of protection” must be assured for judges, witnesses and victims ;\n\n30 ⎯ such a trial requires funds to be mobilized with “the assistance of the international\n\ncommunity”, as is moreover suggested by the African Union . 96\n\nSenegal submitted a report dealing with these poi nts to the Assembly of Heads of State and\n\nGovernment of the African Union (29-30 January 2007). The Assembly took note of the report and\n\ninvited the Member States and the entire intern ational community to mobilize “the resources”,\n\nparticularly the financial resources, required for the trial . 97\n\n88Ann.

On 5October2007, Senegal informed Belg ium, by Note Verbale, of its decision to\n\norganize the trial of Mr. Habré in Senegal and invited Belgium, together with other Member States\n\nof the European Union, to attend a “meeting of potential donors to finance it” scheduled for\n\n16 October 2007 . That meeting never took place.\n\n1.50. Subsequently, several exchanges concerning the holding of a conference of donors took\n\nplace between the Representative of the European Commission and the diplomatic missions of\n\nMember States of the European Union based in Dakar, on the one hand, and Senegal, on the other.\n\nHowever, no donor conference was actually organized for want of a realistic 100 mutually agreed\n\nbudget covering the costs of organizing Mr. Habré’s trial in Senegal .\n\n1.51. In a Note Verbale of 2December2008, transmitted to the Senegalese Ministry of\n\nForeign Affairs on 16December2008, the Belgian Embassy in Dakar referred to the dispute\n\nbetween the two States concerning the interpretati on and implementation of several provisions of\n\n31 the Convention against Torture. Belgium “reite rates its receptiveness to establishing international\n\njudicial co-operation with Senegal, in particular by forwarding to Senegal the Belgian investigation\n\nfile in response to a letter of request from the Senegalese authorities”. Belgium was prepared “to\n\nreceive, as soon as possible and as most convenient to them, the Senegalese investigating judges\n\nhandling this case”. Belgium hoped that this co- operation would result in “decisive progress in the\n\nnext few weeks” 101.\n\n1.52. On 19February2009, Belgium filed w ith the Registry of the Court an Application\n\ninstituting these proceedings. Toge ther with its Application, Belgium filed a request for the\n\nindication of provisional measures, having regard to the statements made by President Wade in the\n\npress and to the media, to the effect that Senegal could lift the house arrest of Mr. Habré if it failed\n\n102\n\nto find the budget which it regarded as necessary for organizing his trial .\n\n1.53. On 29 May 2009, the Minister of Justice of Senegal st103d that four judges had been\n\nappointed “to lead the investigation against Mr.Habré” . By Note Verbale of 23June2009,\n\ntransmitted on 2July2009, Belgium reca lled its Note Verbale of 2December2008 104 and added\n\nthat it would defray the costs associated with the execution of a preliminary letter rogatory aimed at\n\nenabling Senegalese judges to examine the Belgian record of investigation 10.

B.17. - 18 -\n\n29July2009, Senegal took note of Belgium’s propo sal for judicial co-operation in the H.Habré\n\ncase; it indicated that the proposal had been refe rred to the competent authorities and that “any\n\ndevelopment in this connection will be communicated to the Embassy as soon as possible” 10. By\n\nNote Verbale of 14September 2009, Senegal welcom ed Belgium’s offer of judicial assistance.\n\nSenegal also announced the designation of two of the four judges, Messrs.Diouf and Seck, to visit\n\n32 Belgium, and stated that concre te arrangements could be establ ished “at the convenience of the\n\nBelgian and Senegalese parties, once the period ofjudicial recess in mid-November 2009 has come to\n\n107\n\nan end” .\n\n1.54. In a Note Verbale of 14 October 2009, transmitted in the context of an approach made to\n\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs on 22October2009, Belgium took note of the designation of four\n\nSenegalese judges to conduct the investigation against Mr.Habré 108. It repeated that the Belgian\n\njudicial authorities were prepared to furnish to the Senegalese judges, in connection with a letter\n\nrogatory to be executed in Belgium, a copy of the Belgian record of investigation against Mr. Habré,\n\nand to bear the costs associated with the letter rogatory. Belgium laid stress on compliance with the\n\nrules governing mutual judicial assistance. On 28October2009, in an interview given to the\n\nAmbassador of Belgium, certai n Ambassadors of other States of the European Union and the\n\nRepresentative of the European Commission, the Senegalese Minister of Justice thanked Belgium in\n\nparticular for its offer of co-operation and said that he had undertaken to respond to it at the earliest\n\nopportunity. The Minister also referred to budgetarymatters and said that the Senegalese authorities\n\nwere not in agreement with the revised budget presented by the African Union following the mission\n\nof the African Union Commission in June 2009 . 109\n\n1.55. On 19November2009, in the cour se of a telephone conversation between the\n\nAmbassador of Belgium and the Senegalese Minister of Justice, the latter announced that his services\n\nwere preparing a formal letter rogatory in resp onse to Belgium’s proposal of mutual judicial\n\nassistance.\n\n1.56. On 5December2009, PresidentWade rece ived the Belgian Minister of Development\n\nCo-operation, Charles Michel, on a visit to Dakar,and reiterated Senegal’s intention to try Mr. Habré\n\nprovided that all the necessary fundswere available. He once again threatened to refer Mr. Habré “to\n\nthe African Union or to Belgium” ifno solution was found by January 2010.\n\n33 1.57. On 14 January 2010, the Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African\n\nStates held a hearing to examine the case brought against the Republic of Senegal in the context of\n\nthe H.Habré case. In their pleadings, counsel for Senegal noted inter alia that, at that stage, no\n\n110\n\nproceedings were pending against Mr. Habré in the Senegalese courts .\n\n1.58. In February 2010, the Belgian Minist er for Foreign Affairs met his Senegalese\n\ncounterpart in Addis Ababa on the sidelines of the African Union Summit. The Senegalese\n\nMinister indicated that the only remaining obstacle to the organization of the trial was merely of a\n\n10Ann. B.18.\n\n10Ann. B.19.\n\n108\n\nAnn.

On 23 February 2010, the Belgian Amba ssador transmitted to the Senegalese Ministry\n\nof Foreign Affairs a Note Verbale in which Be lgium again reiterated its offer of judicial\n\nco-operation and set 30April2010 as the deadlin e for execution of the letter rogatory for\n\nSenegalese judges to go to Belgium and be provided with a copy of the record of investigation\n\ndrawn up concerning H. Habré by the Belgian judicial authorities 111.\n\n1.60. In March2010, the Ambassador of Be lgium met the new Senegalese Minister of\n\nJustice who expressed receptiveness to the Belgian offer of judicial co-operation without, however,\n\nwishing to make a specific commitment regarding transmission of an international letter rogatory.\n\n1.61. In a Note Verbale dated 30April2010, the Senegalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\nreplied to the Note of 23 February 2010 from the Belgian Embassy regarding the Belgian offer of\n\njudicial co-operation whereby the Senegalese judg es responsible for the case would be received in\n\nBelgium on the basis of an international letter rogatory, and recalled that “the competent\n\nSenegalese authorities welcomed this proposal” and that “[a]ll that remained to be decided by the\n\n112\n\nparties were the terms of implementation” .\n\n34 1.62. On 26May2010, the Belgian Minist er for Foreign Affairs met his Senegalese\n\ncounterpart in Brussels. The Ministers discussed inter alia the H.Habré case. During the\n\ndiscussion, the Senegalese Minister for Foreign Affa irs told the Belgian Minister that no judge had\n\nto date been put in charge of the investigation, given the lack of agreement on the budget to finance\n\nthe proceedings. In that context, the Senegalese Minister stated that he was unable to transmit a\n\nletter rogatory in proper form and proposed, by way of alternative, that four prosecutors (“those in\n\ncharge of the criminal proceedings”) should undert ake an exploratory mission to examine the case\n\nfile in Belgium.\n\n1.63. In the Note on the latest developments transmitted to the Court by Senegal on\n\n15 June 2010 113, Senegal stated that “[t]he Senegalese authorities welcomed” 114 Belgium’s offer to\n\nreceive the judges in charge of the H. Habré case on the basis of an international letter rogatory and\n\nto bear the costs of their visit. Senegal referred repeatedly to its desire to fulfil its “international\n\ncommitments” with regard to initiating judicial proceedings against Mr.Habré 11. Senegal also\n\n11Ann. B.22.\n\n112\n\nAnn.

In a Note Verbale of 28June2010 fro m the Embassy of Belgium in Dakar to the\n\n118\n\nSenegalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Belgian authorities:\n\n“while welcoming Senegal’s readiness to ta ke up Belgium’s offer, recall that a State\n\nshould ‘not be invoking any argument based on a lack of financial resources in order\n\nto escape its [international] obligations’. This, moreover, was recalled by Senegal\n\nitself in its ‘Note on the latest developments in Senegal’s preparations for the trial of\n\nMr. Hissène Habré since the delivery of the Order of 28 May 2009 on the request for\n\nthe indication of provisional measures submitted by Belgium’, sent to the International\n\nCourt of Justice by letter of 15June2010 in the context of the dispute between\n\nBelgium and Senegal, brought before the In ternational Court of Justice by Belgium\n\nthrough its Application filed on 19 February 2009.”\n\nAnd they added:\n\n“If Senegal were to maintain its pos ition consisting of making the transmission\n\nof an initial letter rogatory to Belgiu m conditional upon the holding of a Donors’\n\nRound Table ⎯ a Round Table which would be unlikely to take place for at least\n\nseveral months ⎯ the Senegalese judicial authorities would risk finding themselves\n\nunable to initiate proceedings against Mr .HissèneHabré in accordance with the\n\nprinciple of a reasonable period of time. Accordingly, Belgium respectfully points out\n\nto Senegal that it is still possible for it to honour its obligation to prosecute or extradite\n\nby opting for the second of those alternatives.”\n\nV.

B.25.\n\n11Ann. B.26. - 21 -\n\n36 A. Referral of the H. Habré case to the African Union\n\n1.67. The involvement of the African Union in the proceedings against H. Habré dates back\n\nto December2005 and continues to this day. Duri ng the period of four and a half years that has\n\nthus elapsed, the Senegalese public prosecutor’s of fice has taken no judicial steps to institute\n\nproceedings against Mr.Habré. Moreover, be fore the Court of Justice of the Economic\n\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), Senegal itself affirmed that, to date, “no\n\nproceedings against [Mr.Habré] were pending... in the Senegalese courts” 11. Moreover,\n\nSenegal’s statements show a continued lack of certainty on the question whether Senegal considers\n\nthat it is acting solely under a mandate from the African Union, or whether it is seeking to fulfil its\n\nobligations under the Convention against Torture and other rules of international law.\n\n1.68. The day after the decision of 25November2005 in which the Chambre d’accusation\n\nheld that it had no jurisdiction to deal with the request for extradition, i.e., on 26 November 2005,\n\nthe Senegalese Minister of the Interior issued a decree “placing Mr. Habré . . . at the disposal of the\n\nChairman of the African Union”, while indicating that, after a lapse of 48 hours, Mr. Habré would\n\nbe expelled to Nigeria (a country which, at that point in time, was exercising the presidency of the\n\n120\n\nAfrican Union) . However, the Senegalese Minister for Foreign Affairs stated on\n\n27November2005, in a communiqué, that Mr. Habré would remain in Senegal as long as the\n\nAfrican Union Summit had not “indicate[d] which court has jurisdiction to determine this case” 121.\n\n1.69. In a communiqué of its Ministry of Fo reign Affairs, annexed to the Note Verbale\n\n122\n\naddressed to Belgium on 7 December 2005 , Senegal stated that it “is in no way directly involved\n\nin the ‘Hissène Habré’ case” and that this case “is not a Senegalese case but an African case”. As\n\nnoted above, the Minister of the Interior had adopted a decree placing Mr. Habré “at the disposal of\n\n37 123\n\nthe Chairman of the African Union” .\n\n1.70. Senegal duly informed the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African\n\nUnion, at its sixth ordinary session held in Khartoum on 23-24January2006, that the Senegalese\n\nGovernment had taken the decision to transmit the dossier to the African Union so that the H124s\n\nof State and Government could decide what follow-up should be given to this case .\n\n1.71. In its Decision103(VI), the Assembly of the African Union established a Committee\n\nof Eminent African Jurists to consider, among ot her things, “all aspects and implications of the\n\n125\n\nHissène Habré case” . That committee reported to the next session of the Assembly, held in\n\nBanjul on 1-2 July 2006. On that occas ion, the Assembly adopted Decision 127 (VII) 126in which\n\nit took note of the report presented by the Committee of Eminent African Jurists 127. The Assembly\n\nthen noted that, under the terms of Articles3 (h), 4 (h) and 4 (o) of the Constitutive Act of the\n\n119\n\nECOWAS Court of Justice, Hissein Habré v.

At its eighth ordinary session, held in Addis Ababa on 29-30January2007, the\n\nAssembly of the African Union recalled the decision adopted in Banjul and took note of an interim\n\n132\n\nreport from Senegal . At its twelfth ordinary session, held again in Addis Ababa\n\n(1-3February2009), the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union\n\nadopted Decision 240 (XII) 13. In that Decision, the Assembly:\n\nC“4.

At the hearings on the request for the indication of provisional measures, Senegal\n\nstated: “[A]t no point has Senegal established an y link between the dec136on of the African Union\n\nand the obligations incumbent upon it under the 1984 Convention.”\n\nSenegal also indicated that: “it is as a part y to the Convention, not pursuan137o a mandate\n\nfrom the African Union, that the Republic of Senegal is fulfilling its obligations” .\n\n1.76. While Belgium welcomes these statements, it notes that the decisions of the African\n\nUnion concerning the HissèneHabré case, including decisions subsequent to the statements made\n\nby Senegal to the Court, relate to proceedings against Mr. Hissène Habré “in compliance with the\n\nmandate from the African Union”. Moreover, the terms of reference decided in October2009 by\n\nthe Senegalese authorities explain that “[i]n the li ght of such a clear mandate [from the African\n\nUnion], the Senegalese authorit138 were required to make suitable arrangements for the trial to take\n\nplace as quickly as possible” and that it was necessary to “ensure the proper implementation of\n\ntheir political commitment” 139. This is consistent with certain statements by Senegal to the effect\n\nthat\n\n40 ⎯ it had voluntarily accepted the “mandate” of the African Union;\n\n⎯ the latter could terminate the mandate whenever it so wished;\n\n⎯ the entire case now came under the responsibility of Africa, not Senegal.\n\n13Assembly/AU/Dec. 246 (XIII), 3 July 2009 (Ann.

In July2007, the Senegalese au thorities requested financial support from the\n\ninternational community to organize Mr. Habré’s tr ial in Senegal, but no realistic or agreed budget\n\ncould be established 140.\n\n1.78. On 18July2007, in a letter from the Senegalese President to the Belgian Prime\n\nMinister, the Senegalese authorities communicated their own revised estimate of the budget needed\n\nto organize the trial (+/-€27million) and requested financial and technical support from Belgium.\n\nThe President also announced his intention to hold a meeting of potential donors in\n\n141\n\nSeptember 2007 . Several partners of the European Union received a similar letter. At the\n\nsuggestion of certain other Member States, it w as decided that the Presidency of the European\n\nUnion would reply on behalf of the Union to the request from the Senegalese authorities and would\n\nsuggest sending an expert mission from the European Union to help the Senegalese authorities in\n\nthe calculation of a realistic budget for the trial.\n\n1.79. On 14 September 2007, the Presidency of the European Union sent a letter to\n\nPresident Wade proposing the dispatch of an “expert technical mission to be tasked with analysing,\n\n142\n\nwith the competent authorities [of Senegal], existing needs for the organization of the trial” . In\n\nspite of this letter, the Senegalese Embassy transm itted a Note Verbale to the Belgian Ministry of\n\n41 Foreign Affairs on 5October2007, inviting Be lgium to a meeting of potential donors on\n\n143\n\n16 October 2007 . A similar Note Verbale was sent to all the diplomatic missions in Brussels and\n\nto the European Commission. After consultations between the Heads of Mission of Member States\n\nof the European Union in Dakar, the Presidency of the European Union in Dakar spoke to the\n\nPrincipal Private Secretary to MinisterGadio w ith a view to postponing the meeting of potential\n\ndonors until after the expert mission of the Europ ean Union, as the excessive budget estimates for\n\nthe organization of the trial by the Senegalese au thorities had not been revised in the meantime.\n\nThe Minister agreed to the adjournment of the meet ing to a date to be decided, and requested the\n\nrepresentatives of the European Union in Senegal to propose a new date at their convenience.\n\n1.80. Nevertheless, by a facsimile of 4December2007 addressed to Prime Minister\n\nVerhofstadt, the President of Senegal again convened a meeting of potential donors for 13and\n\n144\n\n14 December 2007 . A similar invitation was sent to the other diplomatic missions of the\n\nMember States of the European Union in Daka r and to the Representative of the European\n\nCommission. The latter immediately re quested and was granted a postponement sine die of the\n\nmeeting until after the expert mission of the Euro pean Union. By letter of 7December2007, the\n\nSenegalese President informed the Belgian Prime Mi nister of the postponement “to a later date” of\n\n145\n\nthe conference of potential donors “for scheduling reasons” . Belgium, for its part, exerted\n\npressure to have the expert mission organized as quickly as possible.\n\n14The terms of reference for the organization of the l of Mr.HissèneHabré, prepared in Oct.2009 by the\n\nCommittee on Follow-up and Communication established by Senegal, provided for a budget of more than 18 billion CFA\n\nfrancs (+/-€27 million), a budget identical in amount to the one already estimated in 2007.\n\n14Ann.

D.16. - 25 -\n\n1.81. Since January2008, the African Union and the European Union have endeavoured to\n\ndetermine the type of assistance that Senegal should receive for the purpose of organizing\n\nMr. Habré’s trial.\n\n1.82. On various occasions, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African\n\nUnion has called on the Member States of the Uni on to contribute to the budget for the trial 146. In\n\nits Note on the latest developments, Senega l noted that, at its most recent Summit in\n\n42 February 2010, Senegal had been invited to “continue with consultations with a view to holding the\n\nDonors’ Round Table in Dakar in 2010” 147. Senegal also refers to tw o preliminary drafts of terms\n\nof reference proposed by the African Union, on e on the organization of the Donors’ Round Table\n\nand the other on the management of the funds earmarked for the trial 14, although these documents\n\nhave not been communicated to the Court or to Belgium.\n\n1.83. In January2008, an expert mission from the European Union went to Dakar to\n\nformulate recommendations on support for the organi zation of the trial of Mr.H.Habré by the\n\nSenegalese authorities, including recommendations on a revised and finalized budget.\n\n1.84. In May 2008, the Senegalese Minister of Justice announced that, in order to prepare for\n\nMr.Habré’s trial, he had appointed Mr.Ibra himaGueye as co-ordinator, and a “Committee on\n\nFollow-up and Communication” whose member s included judges and representatives of\n\nnon-governmental organizations. He also announced the establishment of a working group on\n\nbudgetary aspects 149.\n\n1.85. By letter of 4November2008, the Senega lese authorities transmitted to the Office of\n\nthe Representative of the European Commission in Dakar a draft budget for the organization of\n\nMr.Habré’s trial: the draft was in the amount of 18billion CFA francs (approximately\n\n€27 million) 150.\n\n1.86. In December2008-January2009, in an exchange of letters be tween the Senegalese\n\nPresident and the President of the Council of the European Union, the French President,\n\nPresident Sarkozy, noted that the investigative stage of the trial had not started and that no credible\n\nbudget had been established. He proposed providing for technical support from the European\n\nUnion in order to work out a schedule and a budget which would make it possible to raise funds\n\nfrom the international community swiftly. Preside nt Wade reiterated Senegal’s willingness to hold\n\n43 the trial as soon as the financial and logistical conditions necessary to ensure its credibility had\n\nbeen met 151.\n\n1.87. In March 2009, Mr.RobertDossou, special envoy of the African Union for the\n\nH. Habré case, went to Dakar on a mission concerning the preparation of the budget. There he met,\n\n146\n\nSee also the Note on the latest developments, pp. 2-3.\n\n14Ibid., p. 3.\n\n14Ibid.\n\n149\n\nAgence de Presse Sénégalaise (APS), communiqué of 21 May 2008.\n\n15Ann.

By letter of 2 June 2009 addressed to the Representative of the European Commission\n\nin Dakar, the Senegalese President requested technical assistance for the evaluation of the budget\n\nneeded for H.Habré’s trial 15. The Representative of the Commission responded favourably and\n\nbegan drafting terms of reference for the technical assistance mission. At his request, the\n\nSenegalese Minister of Justice forwarded to him, on 25June2009, a set of documents relating to\n\nthe estimated budget for the trial (provisional budget estimate of 18 billion CFA francs prepared in\n\n2007, with an additional budget for the co-ordinator and a budget for the prison administration).\n\n1.89. A delegation from the African Union Commission visited Dakar from 4 to\n\n10 June 2010 in order to draw up a draft budget in accordance with the “mandate from the African\n\nUnion” 153. No meeting with representatives of the European Union was organized and the latter\n\nwere informed of the visit only after the event by a letter of 25June2009 from the Minister of\n\nJustice of Senegal to the Representative of the Commission of the European Union. At the\n\nconclusion of that mission, the African Union re-estimated the budget needed as US$16 million.\n\n1.90. In October 2009, terms of referenc e for the organization of the trial of\n\n154\n\nMr. Hissène Habré were prepared by the Committee on Follow-up and Communication\n\nestablished by Senegal. The term s of reference referred to the “mandate” from the African Union\n\nand to the “political commitment” undert aken by the Senegalese authorities 155. The objectives\n\n44\n\nconsisted in establishing the physical and lega l conditions necessary for organizing a fair trial\n\nwithin 28months (20months for preparation and tr aining, five months for the trial, three months\n\nfor the appeal). The terms of reference describ ed the legislative amendments already made in\n\nSenegal. They also described the working gr oup established after the decision of the African\n\nUnion to examine the legislative amendments, evaluate the costs, provide for a co-ordinator and a\n\ncommittee on follow-up and communication, and the tr aining needs of judges and legal officials in\n\nthe near future. It was recommended to designa te the persons concerned, provide them with\n\ntraining (including study trips), and address issues of security and communication. The budget\n\nwould exceed 18 billion CFA francs (approximately €27 million).\n\n1.91. In a letter of 29October2009 from the Senegalese Minister of Justice to the\n\nRepresentative of the European Commission, the former proposed a tripartite African\n\n156\n\nUnion-European Union-Senegal meeting on budgetary matters . The Representative of the\n\nCommission, in his reply, requested postponement of the meeting until after the second expert\n\nmission of the European Union scheduled to take place before the end of the year and proposed\n\nextending the invitation to other parties (fo r example, the United States of America and\n\nSwitzerland).\n\n15Letter of 2June 2009 from the Senegalese authoritis to the European Commission delegation in Dakar\n\n(Ann.

D.18. - 27 -\n\n1.92. From 7 to 17 December 2009, three Europ ean Union experts visited Dakar in order to\n\nassist the Senegalese authorities in finalizing the budget for the trial. This was the first phase in the\n\nsecond expert mission of the European Union.\n\n1.93. Taking advantage of the presence in Dakar of the European Union’s experts, the\n\nSenegalese authorities, on 9December2009, orga nized a “day of validation of the terms of\n\nreference for the organization of the trial of H. Habré”, in which the experts of the European Union\n\nand representatives of the African Union Commission participated as observers.\n\n1.94. The second phase of the second expert missi on of the European Union, scheduled for\n\n45\n\n19 to 23 April 2010, was postponed on account of disr uptions in European airspace. It was finally\n\nheld in the week of 17 May 2010.\n\nVI. SUMMARY OF THE FACTS\n\n1.95. The facts of this case may be summarized as follows:\n\n⎯ from 1982 to 1990, Mr.Habré was President of Chad; during his presidency, numerous\n\nviolations of the most fundamental human ri ghts were committed against several tens of\n\nthousands of persons (paras.1.05-1.10 above); having been deposed in 1990, H.Habré took\n\nrefuge in Senegal where he has been resident ever since (para. 1.08 above);\n\n⎯ in January2000, victims of Mr.Habré file d a complaint against him in Senegal; the\n\ninvestigating judge charged Mr.Habré with co mplicity in “crimes against humanity, acts of\n\ntorture and barbarity”, but the Chambre d’accusation annulled the proceedings on grounds of\n\nlack of jurisdiction of the Senegalese courts in the absence of a law enab ling them to exercise\n\nthe extraterritorial jurisdiction required by the case (paras.1.11-1.13 above); in March2001\n\nthe Court of Cassation of Senegal rejected the appeal of the victims who had filed complaints\n\nin Senegal (para. 1.15 above);\n\n⎯ in November2000, complaints were filed in Belgium against Mr.Habré (paras.1.19-1.20\n\nabove);\n\n⎯ in September 2005, upon completing his investigatio n, the Belgian investigating judge issued a\n\nwarrant in absentia for the arrest of Mr. Habré; the arrest warrant was transmitted to Senegal\n\nvia the Interpol system, with a red notice, and served as a request for provisional arrest with a\n\nview to extradition (paras. 1.28-1.31 and 1. 34);\n\n⎯ in November2005, the Chambre d’accusation of the Dakar Court of Appeal declared that it\n\n46 had no jurisdiction to rule on the request fo r extradition from Belgium, given the immunity\n\nenjoyed by the President of Senegal under Senegalese law (para. 1.36 above);\n\n⎯ in December2005, Senegal transmitted two Notes Verbales to Belgium referring to the\n\njudgment of the Chambre d’accusation of the Dakar Court of Appeal and pointing out that the\n\ncase had been referred to the African Union (paras. 1.38-1.39 above);\n\n⎯ in January and March 2006, Belgium transmitte d two Notes Verbales to Senegal, requesting\n\nSenegal to clarify its position on the request for the extradition of Mr. Habré, in the light of the\n\nConvention against Torture (paras. 1.40-1.41); - 28 -\n\n⎯ in May 2006, in its reply to the Notes Verbales of Belgium, Senegal stated that the transfer of\n\nthe case file to the African Union was in keeping with its obligations under the\n\n1984 Convention (para. 1.43 above);\n\n⎯ in June 2006, Belgium transmitte d a Note Verbale to Senegal in which it noted that it had not\n\nbeen possible to resolve by ne gotiation the difference of views between the two States on the\n\ninterpretation and implementation of the Convention against To rture and that, consequently, it\n\nproposed having recourse to the arbitration procedure provided for in the Convention\n\n(para. 1.44 above);\n\n⎯ in 2008, victims of Mr.Habré filed a further co mplaint against him in Senegal (para.1.49\n\nabove);\n\n⎯ in December2008, Belgium offered to extend j udicial co-operation to Senegal by forwarding\n\nthe investigation file relating to Mr.Habré and receiving Senegalese investigating judges in\n\nBelgium (para. 1.51 above);\n\n⎯ in February2009, Belgium filed an Applica tion instituting proceedings with the Court and\n\nsubmitted a request for the indication of provisional measures (para. 1.52 above);\n\n⎯ in July2009, Belgium reiterated the proposal s it had made in December2008 (para.1.53\n\nabove);\n\n47 ⎯ in July and September2009, Senegal welcomed the proposal for Belgian judicial assistance\n\nand designated two judges to go to Belgium; Belgium took note of this and declared its\n\nreadiness to finance this letter rogatory (para. 1.53 above);\n\n⎯ in November2009, the Minister of Justice of Senegal informed the Ambassador of Belgium\n\nthat a formal letter rogatory would be sent to Belgium (para.1.55 above); up to the present\n\ntime (end of June 2010), Belgium has not received a letter rogatory;\n\n⎯ in December 2009, President Wade stated that Senegal would try H. Habré on condition that all\n\nthe necessary funds were available (para. 1.56 above);\n\n⎯ in February2010, the Senegalese Minister for Foreign Affairs repeated this message to the\n\nBelgian Minister for Foreign Affairs (para. 1.58 above);\n\n⎯ in February2010, Belgium reiterated its offe r of judicial co-operation for the third time\n\n(para. 1.59 above);\n\n⎯ in March 2010, the new Senegalese Minister of Justice said that he was receptive to the Belgian\n\noffer, but could make no concrete commitment re garding the transmission of a letter rogatory\n\nto Belgium (para. 1.60 above);\n\n⎯ in June2010, Senegal transmitted to the Court documents intended to demonstrate Senegal’s\n\nwillingness to initiate criminal proceedings against Mr. Habré (para. 1.63 above);\n\n⎯ also in June2010, Senegal reaffirmed its readiness to accept the Belgian offer of a letter\n\nrogatory “as soon as the forthcoming Donors’ Round Table has taken place. This is being held\n\nunder the aegis of the European Union and the African Union.” (Para. 1.64 above);\n\n48 ⎯ in a Note Verbale in reply, also dated June 2010, the Belgian authorities indicated to the\n\nSenegalese authorities that, by making further proceedings conditional on the actual holding of\n\na Donors’ Round Table, the Senegalese author ities might not be able to honour, within a - 29 -\n\nreasonable period of time, the obligation to prosecute if not extradite, unless they opted for the\n\nsecond of those alternatives (para. 1.65 above).\n\n1.96. To sum up, Mr.Habré has been living in Senegal for 20years during which the\n\ncompetent Senegalese authorities have at no time taken concrete action on\n\n⎯ the international rules on action to combat impunity for the acts alleged against him;\n\n⎯ two sets of individual complaints addressed to the Senegalese courts (2000, 2008);\n\n⎯ the request for extradition addressed by Belgium to Senegal (2005);\n\n⎯ the offers of judicial co-operation from Belgium to Senegal (2008, 2009, 2010);\n\n⎯ the commitments explicitly undertaken by Senegal.49\n\nC HAPTER II\n\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE C OMMITTEE AGAINST T ORTURE ,THE A FRICAN C OURT\n\nON H UMAN AND PEOPLES ’ RIGHTS AND THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE\n\nECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF W EST A FRICAN STATES (ECOWAS)\n\n2.01. Several international forums have dealt with various aspects of the H. Habré case: the\n\nUnited Nations Committee against Torture and two international courts, the African Court on\n\nHuman and Peoples’ Rights and the Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African\n\nStates (as was stated by Senegal during thearings on provisional measures in April2009).\n\nThis chapter updates the information on those proceedings, in so far as such information is\n\navailable.\n\nI.COMMITTEE AGAINST TORTURE\n\n2.02. On 17May2006, the Committee against Torture rendered its decision on a\n\n158\n\ncommunication submitted against Senegal by SuleymaneGuengueng et al . The Committee\n\nconcluded that Senegal had violat ed the Convention against Torture by failing in its obligation to\n\nextradite or prosecute Mr. Habr.\n\n2.03. The Committee concluded:\n\n“9.3 On the merits, the Committee mu st determine whether the State party\n\nviolated article 5, paragraph 2, and article 7 of the Convention. It finds ⎯ and this has\n\nnot been challenged ⎯ that Hissène Habré has been in the territory of the State party\n\nsince December 1990. In January 2000, the complainants lodged with an examining\n\nmagistrate in Dakar a complaint against Hissène Habré alleging torture. On\n\n20 March 2001, upon completion of judicial proceedings, the Court of Cassation of\n\nSenegal ruled that ‘no procedural textonfers on Senegalese courts a universal\n\njurisdiction to prosecute and judge, if they are found on the territory of the Republic,\n\n50 presumed perpetrators of or accomplices in acts [of torture]. . . when these acts have\n\nbeen committed outside Senegal by foreigners; the presence in Senegal of\n\nHissèneHabré cannot in itself justify the proceedings brought against him’. The\n\ncourts of the State party have not ruled on th e merits of the allegations of torture that\n\nthe complainants raised in their complaint.\n\n9.4 The Committee also notes that, on 25 November 2005, the Indictment\n\nDivision of the Dakar Court of Appeal sted that it lacked jurisdiction to rule on\n\nBelgium’s request for the extradition of Hissène Habré.\n\n9.5 The Committee recalls that, in accordance with article 5, paragraph 2, of the\n\nConvention, ‘each State Party shall... take such measures as may be necessary to\n\nestablish its jurisdiction over such offen ces in cases where the alleged offender is\n\npresent in any territory under its jurisdand it does not extradite him...’. It\n\nnotes that, in its observations on the merits, the State party has not contested the fact\n\nthat it had not taken ‘such measures as mbe necessary’ in keeping with article5,\n\nparagraph2, of the Convention, and observes that the Court of Cassation itself\n\n15CR 2009/9, 6 Apr. 2009, pp. 28-29, para. 43 (Kandji).\n\n158\n\nMr. Suleymane Guengueng is one of the victims who filed a complaint with the Senegalese judicial authorities.\n\n15Ann. E.2. - 31 -\n\nconsidered that the State party had not taken such measures. It also considers that the\n\nreasonable time frame within which the State party should have complied with this\n\nobligation has been considerably exceeded.\n\n9.6 The Committee is consequently of the opinion that the State party has not\n\nfulfilled its obligations under article 5, paragraph 2, of the Convention.\n\n9.7 The Committee recalls that, under artic le 7 of the Convention, ‘the State\n\nParty in the territory under whose jurisdiction a person alleged to have committed any\n\noffence referred to in article 4 is found shall in the cases contemplated in article 5, if it\n\ndoes not extradite him, submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of\n\nprosecution’. It notes that the obligation to prosecute the alleged perpetrator of acts of\n\ntorture does not depend on the prior existen ce of a request for his extradition. The\n\nalternative available to the State party unde r article7 of the Convention exists only\n\nwhen a request for extraditi on has been made and puts the State party in the position\n\nof having to choose between (a) proceeding with extradition or (b) submitting the case\n\nto its own judicial authorities for the institution of criminal proceedings, the objective\n\nof the provision being to prevent any act of torture from going unpunished.\n\n9.8 The Committee considers that the State party cannot invoke the complexity\n\nof its judicial proceedings or other reasons stemming from domestic law to justify its\n\nfailure to comply with these obligations under the Convention. It is of the opinion that\n\nthe State party was obliged to prosecute Hissène Habré for alleged acts of torture\n\nunless it could show that there was not sufficient evidence to prosecute, at least at the\n\ntime when the complainants submitted their complaint in January2000. Yet by its\n\ndecision of 20 March 2001, which is not subj ect to appeal, the Court of Cassation put\n\nan end to any possibility of prosecuting Hissène Habré in Senegal.\n\n9.9 Consequently and notwithstanding the time that has elapsed since the initial\n\n51 submission of the communication, the Committee is of the opinion that the State party\n\nhas not fulfilled its obligations under article 7 of the Convention.\n\n9.10 Moreover, the Committee finds th at, since 19September2005, the State\n\nparty has been in another situation cove red under article7, because on that date\n\nBelgium made a formal extradition request. At that time, the State party had the\n\nchoice of proceeding with extradition if it decided not to submit the case to its own\n\njudicial authorities for the purpose of prosecuting Hissène Habré.\n\n9.11 The Committee considers that, by re fusing to comply with the extradition\n\nrequest, the State party has again failed to perform its obligations under article 7 of the\n\nConvention.\n\n9.12 The Committee against Torture, acting under article 22, paragraph 7, of the\n\nConvention, concludes that the State party has violated article5, paragraph2, and\n\n160\n\narticle 7 of the Convention.”\n\n2.04. In its Note on the latest developments tr ansmitted to the Registry of the Court, Senegal\n\nrefers to a confidential fact-finding mission by the Commission against Torture which visited\n\nSenegal from 4 to 7 August 2009 in order to “ascertain what steps the State of Senegal had taken to\n\nprepare for the trial of Mr.HissèneHabré and how much progress had been made” 161.
