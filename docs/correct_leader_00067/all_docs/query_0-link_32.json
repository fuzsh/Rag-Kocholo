        "text": "MINURCAT completed its mandate on 31 December 2010, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1923 (2010) and at the request of the Chadian Government, which had pledged full responsibility for protecting civilians on its territory. Following its withdrawal, the UN country team and the UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA) remained in the country to continue to work for the benefit of the Chadian people.\n\nReporting to the Security Council in December, the Secretary-General said “MINURCAT has been an unusual and unique United Nations peacekeeping operation in that it was devoted solely to contributing to the protection of civilians, without an explicit political mandate. It has gone through the stages of planning, deployment and withdrawal in the short span of less than four years, enduring adversities in each.”\n\nFor more on the implementation of the MINURCAT’s mandate, achievements and the lessons learned, please see the Secretary-General’s final report S/2010/611 of 1 December 2010.\n\nOfficially known as the Republic of Chad, Chad is a landlocked country in central Africa. It is bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest, and Niger to the west. At 1,284,000 square kilometres (496,000 sq mi), Chad is the world's 21st-largest country. N'Djamena, formerly Fort-Lamy, the capital, is the largest city. Chad is home to over 200 different ethnic and linguistic groups. In 2005 Chad's population was estimated at 10,146,000; 25.8% live in urban areas and 74.8% in rural ones. The country's population is young: an estimated 47.3% is under 15. Arabic and French are the official languages. Its currency is the CFA franc. Islam is the most widely practiced religion. The constitution provides for a secular state and guarantees religious freedom; different religious communities generally co-exist without problems.\n\nIn 1960 Chad obtained its independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965. In 1979 the rebels conquered the capital and put an end to the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hissène Habré defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss Déby. Recently, the Darfur crisis in Sudan has spilt over the border and destabilised the nation, with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad. Chad remains plagued by political violence. In 2006 and in 2008 rebel forces have attempted to take the capital by force, but have on both circumstances failed.\n\nThe country is one of the poorest; most Chadians live in poverty as subsistence herders and farmers. Since 2003 crude oil has become the country's primary source of export earnings, superseding the traditional cotton industry. However, cotton remains a primary export. Over 80% of Chad's population relies on subsistence farming and raising livestock for its livelihood. Chad also exports large numbers of cattle.\n\nSince 2003, nearly 240,000 Sudanese refugees have fled to eastern Chad from war-ridden Darfur, joined by approximately 45,000 refugees from the Central African Republic. With the 180,000 Chadians displaced by the civil war in the East, this has generated increased tensions among the region's communities."
