But when it comes to putting them into practice, that is an entirely different matter!\" The irony of this state- ment by an American diplomat is not without foundatinn. Last month, at Cancun, I saw Francois Mitterrand plead sincerely f or the Third World. He made credible proposals in the matter of North-South solidarity. But without any great results (JEUNE AFRIQUE, No 1087). Before that, in Mexico, I had heard the French presi- dent issue an appeal for liberty in Latin America. That was not without importance either. But, considering France's influence in this region, one may doubt the effectiveness of such remarks. In short, in less than a week, the weakness of new French diplomacy came to light. What good is an innovative policy if the means for implementing it are insuff icient? - But this skepticism perhaps is out of place when it comes to Africa. - If there is one region where the generous but just the same re~listic ideas of socialist France have a good chance of being translated into action, that is Africa. History, common language (in a part of Africa), and economic interests, to be sure, give French diplomacy here a significance entirely different from what it is else- where. But that is not enough. After all, Giscard also had ideas. His 7-year *_erm nevertheless ended with not much in the way of results. ~ The thing that strengthens France's position today is a certain African \"sensiti- vity\" on the part of the socialist administration. Pierre Meussa, a man who had been rather badly treated by those same socialists, recalled that rather deservedly in these columns several weeks ago in connection with Gaston Defferre, Claude Cheyssnn, and Francois Mitterrand (JEUNE AFRIOUE, No 1086). This sensitivity by the way was expressed on 3 NovemSer at the opening of the Paris conference: \"By identifying a phase of my life with that of your continent, I learned that Africa 1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY was not really known and understood except hy the Africans themselves.\" It was not the arrogant Giscard who said that! Mitterrand himself was talking about the \"great humility\" deriving from fiis interest in Africa. But these are just worda. This time hawever they strike home because they are true. Giscard; we remember, was on bad terms with Houphouet. Mitterrand l~imself, hail- ing those of his peers \"who were (his) colleagues in the French parliamentary as- semblies,\" paid \"friendly homage\" to the Ivorian head of state, \"your dean, my friend,(who) is quite familiar with what all of these memories can bring out in the way of. communion of ideas, com~on struggle, solidarity, and friendship.\" In the meantime, while the French president reviewed priority taaics, a religion and a crusade against the \"international speculators,\" was undnubtedly launched upon the instigation of Houphouet. J It is not by chance that the French Socialists, af~,er 6 months in power, managed to restore a climate of confidence with the majoriyo uf the Africans. With these \"progressives\" who bothered Giscard so much, with certain \"moderates\" whom he had bothered, with all those, finally, who not without worry were wondering sometime about the consequences of the victory of the left. From Jean-Pierre Cot to Guy Penne, numerous French diplomats traveled al.l over the continent (see the article by Sennen Andriamirado, below). Mitterrand received many Afr.ican chiefs of state _ at Elysee Palace; Houphouet was the first and Mobutu was the last. France was there when a friendly country seemed threatened, such as Cameroon, by its powerful Nigerian neighbor. In short, the socialist president reassured everyone. And, in receiving his guests in Paris, he wanted the conference to reassure those who were still unsure. With confidence restored, Mitterrand took the initiative. However, he preferred a more subtle and cautious approach over the interventionism of Qiscard, a kind of double or nothing which succeeded (Shaba) or failed (Chad). He was more res- pectful of appearances if not principles, he was more legalistic in any case, and he relied heavily on the OAU. Regarding the Sahara, for example, France supports the Nairobi II resolution. Even more so regarding Chad. Was the OAU powerless to dislodge the Libyans? Mitterrand's action, shielded h~ the pan-African organi- zation, today seems capable of putting an end to the designs of Qadhdhafi (see the article by Sennen Andria~irado and Francois Soudan, below). At other times, people would have been shouting \"interference.\" But the way it is done means much here. And also the fact that the new-look socialists a priori are cleansed of any suspicion of neocolonialism. In the beginning, the attitude o.f Paris, a powerful idea shared by a number of African capitals, was this: Regiona.l conflicts and local power appetites open the door to an East-West confrontation which is not gaod for the p~or countries. The latter primarily were concerned with pressing problems of development. On that level, socialist France proposed to act by stepping up its aid most of which goes to Africa. Cocrnnitments were made: The total amount of development aid would be increased from 0.35 percent to 0.7 percent of the GNP between now and 1988 and thz share reserved for the least advanced countries would be increased to 0.15 _ percent between now and 1985. 2 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONL.Y The Socialists want to promote a cextain type of development. Mittexrand was very clear on that in Paris; If France commits itsel~ to the job of consid~rably step- ping up its aid, it also wants to guide its logic along~~these lines. The ~olution to the drama of underdevelopment does not involve the establishment of export crops or industries based on inadequate technologies oriented exclusively toward the market of the developing countries. To this kind of inerchant capitalism we must prefer a kind of agricultural and industrial development that will utilize t:~z human and natural resources, seeking to satisfy the essential needs of the population on a priority basis.\" Does this kind of approach indicate a desire to interfere in affairs of othei countries? It is essentially a matter of good com- mon sense and reca].ls the spirit of the Lagos plan adopted by the OAU in 1980. Doe~ this mean that the daddy-style of cooperation has been buried? One can only hope so. \"I am minister of cooperation and development, Jean-Pierre Cot emphasized on the eve of the Paris sumanit in his office on Monsieur Str~et. It is the second term (development) in my demand which justifies my action.\" \"Self\"centered\" de- velopment, with priority going to rural areas, plus \"integrated\" programs. Cot seems to believe in that, quite happy to be addressing himself to his task \"without so far having received any guidance from Elysee Palace, telling me to do this or. that or the other thing.\" Of course, for the time being, he must finance aid pro- jects which fit in rather poorly with his philosophy and he must give emergency aici. But he intends to go into \"real\" development soon. The French are not wrong in emphasizing this point which is essentially in Africa today. Just as they were not wrong to insist on freedoms in Latin America where the economy is already more structured. To each his own priority. Having made this point, the zight for democracy is no less urgent in Africa. Now, in spite of the new reference to the \"people,\"' it seems to hav e been tragically forgotten in France's African diplomacy. It would be a shame if realism were to prevail over _ generosity here. Unless this generosity is preserved for those who can only ex- pect words from France. Realism is good for the others, that is, the Africans. Socialist Administration, Party Misunderstandings Pari~. JEUNE AFRIQUE in French No 1088, 11 Nov 81 pp 20-22 [Art~cle by Sennen Andriamirado: \"The ~ao Sides\"] [Text] The socialist administration has its reasons which the - Socialist Party does not understand. In Africa, the Trench administration and the French PS [Socialist Party] have four categories of \"common friends\": The leaders of Benin, of the Congo, of Niger, and of Senegal. And that is all. This at least is what emerges from a comparison among the guests invited by Mr Francois Mitterrand to the so-called French-African summit in Paris (3-5 November) and those invited by the party--from which the French president came--to the Congress of Valence (23-25 October, see JEUNE AFRIQUE, No 1087). The other invited guests on either side are not the same. It just so happens that the PS admin~_sters its friendships in a manner different from the administration. FOR OFFICiAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY In summary, the ~rench axe applying a new ax~pm; ~'The friends o~ our ~7riends are not our friends;\" The theorem even works the other way since the\"enemies o� our friends are not our enemies.\" Thus, African leaders ignored by the PS are among the guests invited by the government. This i~ of course the way it had to be for reasons of state: France maintains relations with states, not with parties. Comorian pr.esident Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahman can consider himself the most for- tunate: Although his regime is considered \"illegal\" by the PS, he was the only African received twice in 2 days by Francois Mitterrand. Qthei- leaders who, among the party comrades, are told that their methods of government are not appreciated, came out of Elysee Palace, their heads held high. That is true of the Togolese Gnassingbe Eyadema, the Zairian Mobuto Sese Seko, and above all the Gabonese Omar Boiigo, who even managed ta turn the situation around. It is Omar Bongo who, during S months, received the largest number of French per- s onalities. In particular, Mr Guy Penne, presidential advisor on Af rican affairs, in June, August, and October. More than that, the Gabonese chief of state can claim credi.t as conciliator since it was he who, in his own Libreville, organized the meetings between Guy Penne and the controversial leaders, such as the Chadian Goukouni Weddeye and the Central African Gen Andre Kolingba. In French socialist circles, Guy Penne was discreetly reproached for having manifested a certain pre- dilection for Omar Bongo, something which Valery Giscar~ d'Estaing was hardly ever - criticized for. The people at Elysee Palace are content with saying: \"Our only mistake in Gabon was not to have recalled ambassador Maurice Robert soon enough:\" In reality, there is a noticeable disparity between the criteria adopted by the two power centers. The socialist militants would have preferred to enlarge the Front Line countries to include the \"French-African family\" inherited from Giscard. That u~as undoubtedly too soon. But one must not forget that the African policy statements by candidate Francois Mitterrand quite correctly labeled unhealthy \"French aid concentrated on a limited number of countries, most of which were our colonies.\" This is explained as follows at Elysee Palace today: \"Mitterrand could not suddenly break with tradition.\" Another basic assertion from the PS seems to have been forgotten by the adminis- tration. It was emphasized that French cooperation w~uld not be extended to \"the racist regimes (that is to sa~, South Africa) and those in which attacks upon human rights in some way constitute a principle of government.\" After having become minister of cooperation and development, Jean-Pierre Cot kept saying, in an off icial brochure (\"La France et le Tiers monde,\" Paris, Diloutre- mer publishers, 4th quarter, 1981) that \"France can no longer be an active or pas- sive accomplice of crimes which it has tolerated far too long or a slanted concept of noninterference.\" This is a logical conclusion; none of the guests invited to Elysee Palace were ever suspected of attacking human rights. Beyond the friendship expressed on either side, there is, on principle, a search for coherence between the prof essions of faith and actior.. But that is not always discovered. What about French military bases in Africa? While in the opposition, the socialists condemned them. But, even before Francois Mitterrand was elected, the only phrase FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-04850R000400080036-0 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY taken out of the Sociaiist Party~s A~xic~n PXpgx3m cpncerned the hases in question; \"Their existence can be justified only in terms o~ extreme necessity and in a tem- porary fashion.\" It would thus be necessary to consider that the military support bases in Central Africa, in the Comoro Islands (Mayotte), in ivory Coast, at Jii,uti, in Gabon, and in Sene~al ail depend on \"dire necessity.\" The truth is that, while in the opposition, it was easy to demand that they be dismantled. ~Dnce in power, it is more difficult to close those bases down. The state has its reasons which the party has nothing to do with. A similar finding applies to other fields. Thus, the PS proclaimed noninterference in the affairs of others and affirms that defense agreements must only be aimed at tlie protection of state against foreign threats. This principle was appzrently implemented in Central Africa; French soldiers were withdrawn f rom the personal guard of David Dacko and allowed him to be \"toppled\" by General Kolingba. For Chad, on the other hand, the party had violently criticized military aid given by France to the successive regimes of Francois Tombalbaye and Felix Malloum. But today Paris flies to the aid of Goukouni Weddeye. Of course, the foreign threat does exist; with respect to Chad, it is already there; it is the threat from Libya. Of course, the shipment of weapons to Goukouni was deliberately ordered to prevent any attempt at a coup d'etat; according to ali evidence, however, the coup, which Paris had been afraid of, was not carried out by Qadhdhafi but rather by a Chadian who was one of his friends. That therefor.e would seem to be an internal Chadian affair. And Mitterrand avoided having to admit that. Looking at Chad, tlie French president moreover forgot other principles of his party. i To a certain degree, for example, strict respect which must ~overn French-African ~ relations. By sending ~ut a telegram to invite the current president of the OAU, ~ the Kenyan Daniel Arap Moi, without delay to send an inter-African force to Chad, ~ he aroused percept~.ble ill will in several capitals on the continent. The diplo- % matic formulas, employed here and there, might rather roughly be summarized as fol- lows: \"What is Mitterrand sticking his nos2 into?\" In Cameroon, Ahmadou Ahidjo, and in Gabon, Omar Bongo, continue to maintain that this kind of inter-African furce should be put together with the help of the UN. The meaning behind that is: , \"It is not up to France to push us!\" The same tune came from Algeria where there ' is only friendship for Mitterrand. As for OAU secretary-general Edem Kodjo, he f elt that French aid to the Pan-African force for Chad would have to be based on bilateral agreements between France and the countries to participate in that force,. Put less diplomatically, it sounds like this: \"Let those who want to nsk for French aid do so individually. The OAU, - wl~ich is a continental organization, does not deal with a single country, except France.\" The injunction of Francois ~Iitterrand thus becomes a flagrant incursion in the af- fairs of the OAU. Elysee Palace at least is guilty of lack of discretion. For having sent his message from Cancun (Mexico, see JEUNE AFRIQUE, No 1087). Did he want in this way to tell the world that he, that is to say, France, car~ directly speak to all of Africa? \"Valery Giscard d'Estaing would not have done better,\" African diplomats note with iro-~y.

And it is perhaps this issue on wh~ch the party and the administxa- tion do not disagree by a single iota. The premier proclaimed quite sincerely: \"Among the three major portions of the Third World, Africa is the one where, for historical and geograpfiical reasons, has been most present; this presence today is essential i:or our country's international clout; it is not negligible with respect to its eco~iomy.\" This is why Francois Mitterrand cannot really drop the idea of regularly--and by himself--meeting with half of Africa. Africa Without Tears The grand prize for doing the most traveling goes to Guy Penne. In less than 6 days (4-lA August 1981), the French president's advisor for African affairs visited eight countries: Niger, Benin, Gabon, the Congo, Angola, Mozambique, Zambia, and Jibuti. Another award, for the largest number of African countries visited, also goes to Guy Penne: 17, total, between June and October. The third award, the award for loyalty, must be given to Guy Penne: In 4 months, he was received in Gabon by President Omar Bongo on three occasions. That of course was part of his duty because the successor--although he does not like the co~nparison--of Jacques Foccart, Rene Journiac, and Martin Kirsch, in Africa, is both the most mysterious and the most visible French official. Believed to know everything and to be able to do everything, Guy Penne does not go unnoticed any- where ?~ecause his conversation partners are happy to report his presence. Less mythical, Cooperation and Development Minister Jean-Pierre Cot did not put in the same performance as his comrade in the Socialist Party. He was only able to \"make\" five countries in Af rica: Cameroon, Ghana, Senegal (3-16 August), the Congo, Nigeria (15-22 August). It is also noted that this balance was carefully worked out between West Africa and Central Africa, between the French-speaking countries and the English-speaking countries. This dosage did not inspire Regis Debray, a mission chief at Elysee Palace. Loyal to his guerrilla past, the companion of Che Guevara in Bolivia above all visited the \"revolutionary\" countries in Africa, such as Angola and Mozambique, and his presence at other airporLS ~as only due to necessary stopovers. French personalities carefully avoided certain countries. That was true of Michel _ Jobert, minister of foreign trade, and Gaston Defferre, minister of interior, who only went to Algiers to settle some very specific issues. Foreign relations minister Claude Cheysson did better although he did limit his trips to the Maghreb: Tunis (S-6 July), Algiers and Rabat (8-10 August), and once again Rabat, during the meeting of the French-African Commission. The chief diplomat however :iid not neglect Africa south of the Sahara since he very discreetly dispatched the rot*ing ambassador Jean-Pierre Campredon to Kenya and to the Sudan and even more discreetly to certain hot spots in Central Africa. This discretion only helped the African trips of the ninth French personality, Edwige Avice, minister of youth and sports, who, between 17 and 22 October, made a FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \"sporting\" trip to Senegalr Gabon~ Ivo~cy Coast~ Uppex Volta~ and Mali~ All the way to Mopti, Sangha~ and Tomhouctou, towns whexe sppxts activities as we know axe conf ined to tourist antics. (S.A.~ How Much Does Africa Cost Modesty? Perfidy toward the Giscard regime? The French ministers of foreign rela- tions and of cooperation, on the occasion of the eighth French-Af ricaa summit, published a nice little booklet of about 30 pages entitled \"La France et le Tiers monde\" (Paris, Diloutremer Publishers, 4th Quarter, 1981). The principal statis- tics of French aid in 1980 are contained in that publication. These are statistics of dazzling modesty. Last year, France devoted barely 0.36 percent of its GNP (in other words, $2,358,000,000) for public international aid to the Third World. The portion allocated to the 30 least advanced countries (the PMA [Least Advanced CountriesJ which met in Paris between 1 and 14 September) did not exceed 0.06 percent ($243 million). In terms of the ratio bet~ween aid and GNP, France is thus in ninth place among OECD countries and it is in seventh place in Europe, f ar behind Hol?and (0.99 percent), Norway (0.82 percent~, Sweden (0.76 percent), and Denmark (0.72 percent). In terms of absolute value, the situation is not as bad with France holding fourth place after the United States ($7,091,000, 000), West Germany ($3,518,000,000), and Japan ($3,304,A00,000). What is usually called aid to the DOM-TOM [Overseas Departments and Overseas Ter- ritories] being excluded here ($1,687,000,000), we distinguish between bilateral , aid ($1,645,000,000 or 70 percent of the total) and multilateral aid ($713,000,000). , The former f igure is broken dawn into $903 million for technical and cultural cooper- I ation (55 percent), $611 million f or investments (37 perr_ent), and $13i million in the economic and f inancial area. Concerning the second item, $428 million are channeled through the EEC, especially the FED (European Development Fund with $268 million), the BEI (European Investment Bank), food aid, with $167 million f or the group of the World Bank (AID, IFC); $62 million for the regional banks and $56 million for the institutions of the UN (UNDP, FAD, etc.). France's position is better in the matter of technical cooperation. It has 27,000 citizens working in Africa, including 15,000 in the three countries of the Maghreb and 12,000 ir. the area south of the Sahara. Moreover, two-thirds of them are teachers and county agents.

ONI.Y Mitterrand Speaks 'African Language' Pazis JEUNE AFRIQUE in ~rench No 1088, 11 Nvv 81 p 23 [Letter by Sennen Andriamirado; \"Letter to My Brother\"] [Text] \"Did ;ou know that our president was also a socialist?\" I have some big news f or you: French president Francois Mitterrand speaks African! Of course, neither Lingala, nor Bambara, nor even Inorian French--you know, where they drop all the articles--but his speech was well understood by our owcY president. He passed his f inal exam the moment he said at the opening of their su~nit: \"I have learned that Africa was not really known and iinderstood except by the Africans themselv~s.\" With your usual bad mood, you are going to tell me that this is demagogy. Still, it w~rks: We, the Africans, are ready to listen to the whites who tell us things like that. This is perhaps why so many of our leaders went to Paris to attend this summit wnich is no longer called \"French-Afr.ican\" but rather \"conference of the chiefs of state of Africa and France.\" There were almost 20 presidents plus their vice presidents and ministers. Overall, about 30 countries were represented, the newspapers tell me. So you know what that means! Half of Africa ~athQred around a single non-African: Francois Mitterrand. That gives me an idea: If you want a taxi license, a scholarship, or a passport, instead of going to see all those bureaucrats who take your money (which you do not have anyway), without taking you to the president, all you have to do is write to this fellow Mitterrand. They say he is very kind because he is a socialist. By the way, did you know that our president was also a socialist? I did not know that. Mitterrand did not know it either! Perhaps you, the young people, you understand this, but I was astonished to hear our boss say that he always had ideas like those of the French socialists. Why should he say that iow? In the old days, with Giscard, we were an \"advanced liberal\" country. With Mitterrand, we became \"socialists.\" Of course, nobody sang the International but thP tone of most of the speeches was socialist. While all of this bothers me in terms of my dignity as an African (changing opinions like changing a partner is not very glorious), this conversion of our presidents to socialism is good for us: Perhaps human rights will now be respected among us. At least Mitterrand will have rendered us a ser- vice. You will ask me whether I have seen all of our presidents. No, because that is difficult and, because to keep up with them, you are not traveling in the forest or in the prairie. They rode in fancy cars with many cops around and you, in Paris, can only take the subway. That is normal. And besides, they were not all ir. the same place. Houphouet lived in his own place, in a suburb of Paris. Mobutu lived in his apartment on Foch Avenue. Eyadema stayed in his residence on Maz~echal-Monory Avenue. The others stayed at the Crillon, a palace. It cost very much but France paid the bill. 8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-04850R000400080036-0 ~OR OFF[CIAL USE ONLY tis I know you Qnly too well, yau axe go~.ng to say; \"~y a~a pux pxesi.dent$ la.ye - in hotels as luxurious as those?\" I wi~ll rep].Y to y9u i-x~ adyance; Where would you have them stay instead?

The sixth coffee harvest since independence, beginning in June, did not enjoy good conditions: scarcity of food products for workers since February, delays in the - payment of wages and transport difficulties. Provincial ENCAFE officials in Cuanza-North supervise 409 plantations, spread out over 11 cantons, whose harvest was far from meeting planned production objectives. Some 29,000 persons work on these coffee plantations, including 12,000 permanent laborers and the rest seasonal workers who are not employed six days a week. The rate of absen~.eeism is high: Poorly nourished and badly paid, workers prefer to devote their time to their own plots of land that enable them to achieve a subsis- tence living for themselves and their families. ! Workers are taken to their work areas by ENCAFE transportation, but the company's vehicle pool is only half us~d because of constant breakdowns. As for the.firm's 60 tractors, many have been paralyzed because of the lack of spare parts. Shipping the coffee out after the harvest was difficult because of the lack of trucks and the poor condition of access roads, which should t~ave been maintained by the pro- vincial delegation of the Ministry of Construction (the only organization that has gradersj. However, it demanded previous payment~for work and ENCAFE did not have the necessary funds. After the drying of the coffee berries, it became apparent that there were not enough shellers, again because of the shortage of spare parts needed to repair existing equipment. The coffee therefore piled up in the warehouses in August. In addition to government plantations, there are many small production units in Cuanza-North belonging to private parties or cooperatives. Poorly organized, this production sector is no more motivated and tends to give up coffee growing for - other crops, especially because delays in payment are frequent. Coffee from the 1980-1981 harvest did not begin to be marketed domestically until between December 1980 and February 1981, and its shipping required much longer. 10 FdR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2407/02109: CIA-RDP82-00854R000400080036-0 FOR OFFlC1AL USE ONLY Finally, nature was merciless.

Its activity covers all of Angola. The enterprise has branches in the country's 18 provinces. It is established in 143 cantons and 408 communes. It is also in- volved in traveling sales in rural areas based on a previously set schedule, which is not without problems because ENCODIPAts visits to rural markets are awaited by the people, even if it has few or no industrial goods ta offer them. The deliveries of these industrial goods are often a problemfor enterpri::~~ offi- cials when the.y do not come at the proper time that is, harvest time: June to October for dry products (corn, beans, and so on) and May to August for vegetables from the Wako-Kungo and Benguele regioz?. ' i i Despite its broad decentralization, ENCODIPA's warehouses are located in Luanda: ~ for cotton, grain (in the facilities of the former Gremio.do Milho) and goods, as ; well as for spare parts and accessories needed for the activities of the enterprise. i These activities involve the purchase and distribution of agricultural products ~ and cover various sector~;, one of which is the primary processing of certain pro- ; ducts before consumption: rice husking and polishing, milling, baling and classi- fication of cotton, preparation of tobacco. Another important activity of ENCODIPA is that linked to seed. One department is in fact specifically assigned to the task: purchasing of imported seed, selection of lots marketed that should be grown again, separation and processing of such ~ lots. Regarding produce and fruits, ENCODIPA uses the services of firms in the private sector and a number of government domestic trade establishments. It also handles marketing, preservation, handling and the distribution of these products and has an establishment for their direct sale to the people. This is a store located in the facilities of the old COFA [expansion unknown], open from Thursday to Sunday and able to serve 1,500 persons a day during the week (including members of the party, the government and the diplomatic corps accredited in Angola) and 200 persons on Sunday. 12 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Special attention is given to the cashew sector.

The French Government intends to further the cooperation begun several years ago, particularly in the areas of oil, machinery, coffee and f ishing. Economic relations are clearly better.

The event that set off the tumult was the telegram sent from Cancun by the president of France to the president of the OAU, asking him to speed up the sending of the inter-African force to Chad. The presence in Cancun of the President of the United States and of hundreds of representatives of the world press naturaliy gave a spe- cial edge to this initiative, which reminded the international community of the existence of the Chadian problem and all its projections, in Africa itself as well as in the Near East, where the situation created by the disappearance of President Sadat does not leave the great powers indifferent. The telegram was motivated by information, deemed to be alarming, from Ndjamena, where President Goukouni Oueddei was being pressured by Colonel Qadhdhafi to hasten the merger between Libya and Chad. Francois Mitterrand's telegram was one more confirmation of the French policy on Chad: supporting OAU decisions made in Nairobi with all his strength, and conse- quently, supporting the legitimate government of Chad and helping the establishment of the inter-African force, which was to make the withdrawal of Libyan troops possi- ble. The only limitation that the Paris government placed on its assistance was the sending of French troops. France's affirmed support and the warning sent to Colonel Qadhdhafi, represented by the sending of 25 tons of munitions and light weapons to the Chadian Army, strength- ened the authority of President Goukouni Oueddei and encouraged him in his decision to call upon Colonel Qadhdhafi, in a message dated 29 October, to immediately with- draw his troops from Ndjamena and from Chari-Baguirmi Province and from the entire. Chadian territory by 31 December. President Goukouni Oueddei's personal position was not in fact as assured as it may have at first appeared. Within the Transitional National Union Gowernment (GiJNT), Oueddei's policy was disputed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Ahmat Acyl, whose ethnic base in northern Chad, far more substantial than that of the head of GUNT, might cause him to try to take over the leadership of the country. 16 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Oueddei's very legitimacy is questioned by some African chiefs oi state. At a press :.onference in Paris, the Togolese president, General Eyadema, gave decisions uf the Nairobi OAU summit conference an interpretation differeat from that of Paris. According to Eyadema, the OAU's support for the principles of settlement worked out by Chad's neighbors at the Lagos and Lome conferences, including the establishment of an inter-African force and the withdrawal of Libyan troops, in no way constitutes an extension or renewal of Oueddei's mandate, a mandste that expired in February. Consequently, the latter allegedly has no justification for trying to continue to remain at the head of GUNT and it should only be up tu the OAU \"committee of the 12) to make a ruling on the point. In requiring thaX Tripoli withdraw its troops, Oueddei thereby accepted a challenge on which his political survival depended. However, he seems to have first carefully weighed all his trump cards. � The inter-African force now seems on the way to being effectively set up. 7tuo coun- tries have pledged to send contingents: Nigeria, 2,000 men, and Senegal, 500 to 600 men. Others, like Algeria and Egypt, have promised logistical support and the president of the OAU says he is sure that thP replacement of Libyan troops by the inter-African force throughout the Chadian territory could be assured before the end of the year. Furthermore, Oueddei could speculate on Qadhdhafi's desire to have the next OAU summit conference in Tripoli and become president. The Libyan colonel, who sees - himself as the successor to Nasser and the liberator of peoples, could hardly allow his troops to look like an army of occupation on 31 December, or go back on his word to withdraw them whenever the legitimate government of Chad asked him to do so. i~i~ presence in Paris of over half of the African nations, including a number of Arab countries, may have made him fear the consequences of his diplomatic isolation when he would have to confront the hostility of the United States, which supports the French position on the question. Moreover, it is likely that Qadhdhafi, who considers Chad, where he has been able to rally supporters, as a natural extension of his country, might hope to maintain his influence there, even continue to control it by means other than military. Finally, Hissein Habre, spontaneously or following pressure put upon him by the countries that support him particularly Sudan, into whose territory he withdrew his army said that he had suspended all military activity until Tripoli's re- sponse were known to the request for the withdrawal of its troops. The essential condition for the departure of the troops that is, the maintenance of security throughout Libyan [si~J territory now seems to have been fulfilled. Qadhdhafi appears to have yielded to all these reasons. The commanding officer of the Libyan troops in Chad told newsmen in Nd3amena on 3 November that he had re- ceived a telephone call from Qadhdhafi ordering him to send his contingents home within 2 or 3 days, without stating that it was a total withdrawal from Chadian territory or merely from Ndjamena. He used the pretext of military secrecy to re- fuse to say how many troops were involved Westerners put the number at 10,000, which would seem to preclude their evacuation with equipment in such a short atnount of time. It did not appear at that time that GUNT had been officially informed of Qadhdhafi's decision. 17 FOR OFF7CIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2407/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400480036-4 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY If this is not a mere tactical maneuver on the part of Qadhdhafi, an important step will have been taken toward the normalization of Chad and Oueddei's authority will emerge considerably strengthened. But serious problems will have to be solved, the least of which is not the reconciliation of all Chadian factions. Before leaving Ndjamena to joint Oueddei in Paris, Ahmat Acyl confirmed his total opposition to the withdrawal of Libyan troops, which he views as premature inasmuch as the composition, date of arrival and mission of the inter-African force have not been determined. He believes that \"the seeds of civil war\" are still present in Chad and that \"the domestic situation (there) is more fragile than generally ad- mitted.\" The pitched battles in Mongo and Dourboli in mid October between the troaps of *linister of Interior Mahama Abba and those of the minister of foreign affairs seem to justify these remarks. Oueddei has understood the danger and his government has just announced the creation of a special commission in charge of determining respon- sibilities in confrontations between the various Chadian military factions. Those responsible will be brought before a tqilitary court. If foreign aid for the reconstruction of Chad, especially that of France, :is r~ot arranged, nothing can still be done as long as there is not a national union of a11 fac~ions, and the deployment of the inter-African force appears more urgent than ever if the withdrawal of Libyan troops is effective. ~ COPYRIGHT: Rene Moretix et Cie Paris 198I. ~ 11 464 , CSO: 4719/212 i , 18 - FOR OFF7CIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007142/09: CIA-RDP82-40854R040400080036-0 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY C~3AD BACKGROUND OF WITHDRAWAL OF LIBYAN FORCES FROM CHAD Reported Libyan Coup Paris JEUNE AFRIQUE in French No 1088, 11 Nov 81 pp 12-14 [Article by Francois Soudan: \"The Story of an Imagined Coup d'Etat\"] [Text] Why Paris believed for 24 hours that there had been a changing of the guard in Ndjamena. About half a score of lines in a speech covering 13 sheets, barely 40 seconds--that is rather little for Chad. Even though the speech was delivered slowly by Francois Mitterrand on Tuesday, 3 November, at the opening of the French-African summit in Paris before a score of attentive heads of gtate, this was after all nothing but a rather scholarly presentation. It was about the gravel at Tibesti and the cotton fields of Logone, about Hissein Habre, about Goukouni Weddeye, and about Qadhdhafi: There was hardly any more talk about that on Kleber Avenue. In any case, nothing more than the prices of cocoa or the Namibian issue. Off icially at least. In the well-appointed hallways of the Conference Center, e~ven before the announcement of the Libyan withdrawal, nabody had forgotten that a week ago a crazy rumor was mak- ing the rounds in Paris, coming from press agencies and newspaper editorial offices: A Coup d'Etat in Ndjamena. This deliberate desire to play the Chadian affair down, to reducing it to the pro- portions of a simple incident, is an accurate reflection of the atmosphere of drama which prevailed for a month in a square whose corners are called Kousseri, Tripoli, Paris, and Cancun. Is this the story of a manipulation or is it history? Both of them, it seems. It all began on 17 and 18 September, during the visit of Goukouni Weddeye to Francois Mittarrand. With his puny adolescent voice, his salt- and-pepper goatee, the Chadian president was complaining of \"pressing pressure\" (sic) to which he is exposed from Qadhdhafi. Goukouni is worried; in a rather funereal position for several months, between the \"southerners\" of Kamougue, viscerally anti-Libyan, and the men in his foreign min- istry, with Acyl Ahmat, very close to Tripoli, not at all sure of his own forces-- the FAP (People's Armed Forces), with their rather relative discipline, he is simply afraid that it might all collapse. He was listened to and understood at Elysc:e Palace; economic aid would be stepped up and the establishment of an inter- African force would be encouraged.

Upon his return he undoubtedly expects once again to take up the Chadian issue. Jean-Pierre Cot, minister of cooperation, who was in charge of the Chad affair, and Claude Cheysson, minister of foreign relations, were included in his delegation. That was when quite abruptly everything went the other way. One telegram and then two more arrived in Paris, at Quai d'Orsay [foreign office], starting on the next day, Tuesday, 20 October. They were signed by Pierre Ricard, head of the diplomatic mission in Kousseri. Located opposite Ndjamena, on the Cameroon bank of the Chari river, Kousseri--where there are still hundreds of refugees--is marking time, awaitin~ the reconstruction of Ndjamena and its telecom~nunications network from the half- way capital of Chad. And Pierre Ricard, ambassador of France. \"Things are going badly,\" the chief of missions wrote in his three messages \"strict- ly for office use only.\" He added in substance: The men of Goukouni are in the process of being eliminated; Acyl Ahmat wants power; Goukouni himself could be overthrown before the French-African summit. Big confusion in Paris. As a matter of fact, in addition to his own personal analysis of the situation, Pierre Ricard in his telegrams transmitted the proposals of Goukouni Weddeye, ~ahom he met the day before, on 19 October. Knowing that his words would be passed on, did the Chadian president push things and force Paris into clearly supporting him by dramatizing a situation that had already been defused? Was he \"bluffing\" when he mentioned to his conversation partner the imminence of a Libyan coup d'etat? In the absence of any effective way to check on events in Ndjamena, the alarmist telegrams from Pierre Ricard were received with much worry. Especially since Goukouni took care to send a small delegation rather discreetly to Paris to con- firm the messages of the Fr.ench ambassador. Several thousand kilometers away, on the other side of the Atlantic, there was f everish activity among the French officials who came with President Mitterrand to Cancun. Forwarded to the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, the telegrams from Kousseri had the effect of a bomb: It was necessary to act quickly. On Thursday, 2'L Octo- ber, early in the afternoon (in other words, in the evening as far as Paris and Ndjamena are concerned), Mitterrand published a statement as to the \"urgency\" of dispatching the inter-African force to Chad (JEUNE AFRIQUE, No 1087). Pressed with questions, Jean-Pierre Cot wound up saying that the situation was serious. On Saturday, 24 October, in the morning, Mitterrand, Cheysson, and Cot and the others returned to Paris. In Tripoli, what is now called the \"Cancun declaration\" was received in total silence: Not a line in the press, not a word on radio, not a picture on television. As if it had not been a surprise. On 26 October, Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi summoned French ambassador Charles Malo to whom he gave a message of surprising moderation for Francois Mitterrand: No, he said, we do not want to overthrow Goukouni; yes, the moment the authorities in Ndjamena ask us, we will leave Chad. In short, he explained, there had been a misunderstan~ing. 20 FOR OFFIC[AL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007142/09: CIA-RDP82-40854R040400080036-0 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Qadhdhafi already knew since that same morning that French air force aircraft, DC-8 and Hercules C-130, were taking off from Bordeaux and Ajaccio, with their cargo compartments full of a~unition. Unloaded at the Garoua airport in Northern Cameroon, the cases were shipped by truck to Ndjamena while light arms, taken from the stocks of Kalashnikov assault rifles, stored at the ?~rench base at Bouar, in Central Africa, went in the same direction. Objective: To reinforce the Chadian ANI (Integrated National Army) which needed the items. A rather motley assortment of diverse factions, the ANI, in 5 months of existence, as a matter of fact only managed to organize 200 men. Hardly enough to guard the Chagoua bridge. Tripoli decided to let things go. The decision to withdraw its troops probably had already been made. Suddenly there was drama on Wednesday, 28 October. At least there was tragi-comedy. On Place de la Bourse, in Paris, at the headquarters taken over from the French Press Agency, somebody i.ntroduced a report which was quickly picked up by a journa- list on a video screen and transmitted to the teletype of thc newspapers. Quoting \"witnesses coming from the Chadian capital,\" the message mentioned rumors of a coup d'etat, an airlift, a pro-Libyan column marching on Ndjamena, the disappearance of . President Goukouni--in short, without saying so, a coup d'etat. There was some panic among official circles; reading the message from Qadhdhafi to - Mitterrand, it was thought that Libya had resigned itself to a retreat. But here there was another coup d'etat in progress. Published that same morning a weekly confidential bulletin, LA LETTRE D'AFRIQUE, also stated that there was a Libyan plan aimed at \"legally replacing Goukouni with Acyl.\" Now, the AFP [French Press Agency] dispatch to say the least was rather full of fantasy and on the next day was contradicted by a journalist who had been sent by that agency to Ndjamena. He never saw any coup d'etat, not even a failed attempt. But the information had the advantage of being credible and on 29 October several newspapers came out with their stories on the presumed coup d'etat on the front page. Manipulation, intoxication, or disi.nformation? Yes. It remains for us to figure out who is behind it all. One can certainly accuse the French authorities of having orchestrated this campaign to exert pressure on Libya to speed up its retreat, especially since they themselves were wrong in the beginning regarding a situation which undoubtedly was less tense than indicated in the telegrams from Pierre Ricard. One might a15u think of a fantastic poker game between Paris and Tripoli with each side trying to bluff and, as the case may be, scare the other. But there is a third assumption, strengthened by the brief and at least suspecti \"alert\" of 1,200 paratroopers in Bouar on 28 October; large sectors of the French intelligence services--particularly the military ones--are hostile to the socialist administration who they hesitate to inform (we saw that at the time of the coup d'etat which overthrew David Dacko in Central Africa) and there are strong links in Paris with the Gaullist opposition. Their intent might very well have been to force the French administration to intervene once again directly in Chad in order to counter an imaginary but after all very imaginable coup d'etat. That would get Francois Mitterrand bo~ged down in the Chadian mess. 21 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - On Wednesday, 2~' October, at the end of a S~hour cabinet meeting, Goukouni Weddeye officially deman~ied the total evacuation of all Libyan troops from Chad \"before 31 December.\" Just 3 days later, Hissein Habre, the rebel, announced the suspengion of his guerrilla activities. And on 3 November Tripoli announced its retreat. Like the French in 1980. Was the French-African summit of Paris the summit of the rebirth of Chad? Chad a Burden for Libya Paris JEUI~IE AFRIQUE in French No 1088, 11 Nov 81 p 15 [Article by Mohamed Selhami: \"See Ndjamena and Leave\"] [Text] \"For us, Chad is of vital strategic interest. By helping it become stabi- lized, we will at the same time assure our own stability.\" This is how Colonel Qadhdhafi justified the intervention of tfie Libyan Army in Chad in December 1980. And speculations went along rather nicely: Was this a case of privileged coopera- tion between two neighboring countries or a real occupation? The Libyans always declared themselves ready to withdraw from Chad \"if the government of Ndjamena so demanded.\" Goukouni Weddeye wanted that and Qadhdhafi on 3 November decided to pull his troops back. People in Tripoli undoubtedly were relieved and that included high officials who, without saying so, were hoping to divest themselves of the entire Chadian affair, for several reasons. First of all the economic difficulties caused by the drop in petroleum sales which the Jamahiriya tried to counteract through austerity (JEUNE AFRIQUE, No 1082). Certain development projects in the 1981-1985 5-year plan were suspended or even dropped; Libya f loated a loan of $200 million on the internation.al market through the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company. The Jamahiriya is beginning to be in financial trouble to the point where it is finding it difficult to pay the salaries of its officials. Chad became a burden which Libya was having trouble sustaining. Likewise, it can no longer spread its bounty to the numerous liberation movements in as generous a fashion as so far. For tiie Libyans, withdrawing from Chad also means calmly preparing for the OAU summit which is to be held in June 1982 in Tripoli. Qadhdhafi knew that certain heads of African states--Egyptian, Sudanese, and Somali among others--would not agree to have him take over the chairmanship of their organization if he kept his army in Ndjamena. \"The OAU summit will take place and our country will be honored to receive it and to preside over it. The high Libyan official who made this statement to us did not conceal his worry about the future of Chad which \"risks another blowup.\" The Libyans do not care for that. For them it is enough that they are no longer chal- lenged over the issue of Libyan ownership of the Aouzou strip, a regioa in which the army is now solidly established, building bases and barracks. With this ram- part, Chad is no longer of. any \"vital strategic interest.\" Why then stay there \"except to become bogged down and make trouble for oneself.\" 22 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/49: CIA-RDP82-00850R040400080036-0 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Libya cannot allow itself to malce war outside its territory. It has neither the means for it--especially manpoa~er~-nor perhaps even the desire. Its soldiers certainly fought in the eastern part of Chad against the men of Hissein Habre, supported by the Sudan. A score of them died there. The Libyans would have pre-- ferred these \"martyrs\" to die in Palestine. \"There, at least, we have a noble cause, our cause,\" we were told by a writer who added: \"Since the union between Libya and Chad could not be accomplished.\" Colonel Qadhdhafi felt that a number of his fellow citizens were tired of the Chadian mess. And, since he is their chief, he followed them! It seems that he took the first steps by sending Major Jallud to Ndjamena; he has the position of chief of government. He met president Goukouni on Wednesday, 28 October. He ex- pressed the wish that the withdrawal should be made \"in a gentle fashion\" so as not to rub Qadhdhafi the wrong way and Goukouni played the game. In the morning of 3 November, during the opening of the conference of the heads of state of Fran~e and Africa, there was only one watchword: No pressure on Libya, it will withdrdw by itself. In the afternoon of the same day, Qadhdhaf i dropped his political bomb: The announcement of the withdrawal of his troops. Intervention Not Totally Negative Paris JEUNE AFRIQUE in French No 1088, 11 Nov 81 pp 16, 17 [Article by Amin Maalouf: \"Controlled Skid in Chad\"~ [Text] Just a f ew days ago it seemed that the Chadian affair would drag out in- definitely, like quite a few other crises throughout the world. But then quite abruptly, with a few dramatic moves, the situation was defused. A brilliant French-Chadian maneuver, a rapid and wise response from Tripoli, and the solution was there, before our unbelieving eyes. At the center of this development above all there was the decision of one man. Until this summer, Colonel Qadhdhafi had maneuvered admirably well. The triumphal entry of his troops in Ndjamena in December 1980 may have irritated certain circles but was accomplished within the rules, in response to an appeal from the only in- ternationally recognized Chadian authority. Moreover, the behavior of the Libyan troops in the field had not given rise to any massive abuses which are generally connected with foreign armies. Relations with the \"southerners\" remained correct and the country's institutions, in spite of thPir frailty--or because of it?--were not too badly shaken. Moreover, the main resource in this long battle, that is to say, the French--this was during the administration of Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing--seemed to accept their defeat with a serenity which sometimes bordered on unawareness. After his victory, the Libyan leader naturally wanted to strengthen his bonds with his \"neighbor-protege\" in the south. Essentially, the agreement signed with pre- sident Goukouni Weddeye called for and still calls for a contribution to solving ~had's serious economic problems. 23 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 i ~ FOR OFF[CIAL USE ONLY In recent weeks however there has heen a x'eal tuxnabout. In the beginning, it was hardly perceptible. Tn the beginning, Goukouni gave the impression that he had a . freer hand. He used this opportunity to try to counterbalance his special realtions i with Libya through a reconciliation with Fran�~e. That was made possible when the socialists came to power in Paris. Since this troubling situation was known only , in diplomatic circles, Qadhdhafi was able to pick one of the following solutions: , Either he himself could take the initiative and withdraw his troops from Chad, with- i out waiting for anybody to ask him to do so--by encouraging their replacement with i an inter-African force which Libya had never opposed and in which it of course -j would also have participated. He did not do that; Or he could intervene even more directly in Chadian affairs and try to put his own ; liegeman in place at the time, foreign minister Acyl Ahmat, in order to proclaim ~ Chadian-Libyan unity. The leader in Tripoli, perhaps not without reason, was sus- ; pected of wanting to do that but, in the end, he decided to uphold Chadian legality. i Between these two solutions there was a third one which was neither the wisest nor the most foolish: Wait for the dust to settle. That is the easiest solution for ~ any leader and Qadhdhafi adopted it. The result of this choice--or rather this non-choice--was to bring the problem of. the Libyan presence in Chad out into the open. Goukouni went to Paris on 17 Sep- tember and asked president Mitterrand for help. Not only in military and logistic terms, which woul.d ch ange nothing in the balance of forces out in the field, but also and above all in political and diplomatic terms, as we saw several weeks later. For the Chadian leader, that was more important because the publicity made around his semi-rupture with Tripoli is a form of protection. The turning point was reached in 3 days. And while the observer might use the term \"admirable\" in referring to the maneuver that enabled the Libyan troops to enter Ndjamena in December 1980, the same adjective is not too strong to describe the French-Chadian maneuver on 28-30 October 1981. First of a11, there was \"fool's day,\" when everybody was made to believe that Qadhdhafi was trying to overthrow the legitimate government in Ndjamena and that Goukouni had disappeared, while the Libyan number two man, Major Jallud, was talking naively with Goukouni himself. Then, protected by the noise created in this fashion, the Chadian leader dared take the decisive and almost irreversible step: He solemnly demanded the withdrawal of the Libyan troops. For the sake of completeness we must add that this \"controlled skid\" toak place behind the smokescreen made up of the debate on the inter-African force. Tripoli undoubtedly thought that the diplomatic discussion on this subject would drag on for several weeks, perhaps even until the OAU summit in June 1982, whereas the big show had been carefully prepared for the end of this October. The undeniable success of the maneuver, on the eve of the French-African summit, had created an entirely new situation. Before that, a coup d'etat against Goukouni could have had a semblance of ~ustification, regardless how disastrous the con- sequences of that may have been in long-range terms. After the \"days of October,\" a coup d'etat would have been nothing but a suicidal plunge. The chafrmanship of 24 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ,--i the OAU, which Qadhdhafi wants very much~ would undoubtedly have eluded him. Even more seriously, the United States, which does not conceal its militant hostility toward the Libyan leader, would have had a golden opportunity to get him bogged down in the sand of Chad once and for all. And the French would have been obli~ gated to participate in such an operation. Did Tripoli envisage this option? There is little likelihood of that. Libyan officials at no time Went beyond the point of no return, even when their actions had a cover of legitimacy. Another attitude which had become untenable was the wait-and-see attitude. That could have been justified before the whole thing came out into the open. After Goukouni's demand for withdrawal, libya could no longer stand by and wait because it had been put in the position of the accused and because the pressure exerted - against it could only grow day after day. The stronger the pressure, the less conciliatory could Tripoli's decision be because any conciliation would have looked like a defeat. The only reasonable development was for the Libyan leader to make the best of a bad - situation and without ambiguity to announce his intention to withdraw--he never said that he would not--and that he would take c~gnizance of the withdrawal re- quests from the Chadian government and that, like the French a year ago, he would disengage even faster than Goukouni wanted. By making the \"good choice,\" Qadhdhafi saved the essential aspects of the whole situation. While the disengagement took place urithout any big show, the bottom line after the Libyan intervention was not entirely negative. There was a certain stabilization and the civil war did no longer rage in the capital. But let us forget the past even if it is quite recent because what is even more important in current developments is the acceleration of events. llay after day, hour after hour, the Chadian situation is changing and if that solves certain problems, it also creates others. The inter-African force will iiave to be assem- bled, not in a few weeks, but in a few days. It would be disastrous not to fill the vacuum left by the departure of the Libyans without delaq. And national re- conciliation must be accomplished briskly if one wishes to keep the specter of civil war away once and for all. Let us repeat: The Chadian affair was never as close to a solution, the principal interested parties never proved to be as wise, the antagonisms never seemed as surmountable. And never before have we seen the light at the end of the tunnel this close. Is this a mirage? COPYRIGHT: Jeune Afrique GRUPJIA 1981. 5058 CSO: 4719/255 ?5 FOR OFFICIA[.

This brilliant man, a skilled tactician, lost a leg during the civil war. He is regarded as President Coukouni's eminence grise and has been the strong man of Chad since the Libyans' departure. He still leads tl-ie popular forces, which are loyal to the head of state and have not yet been integrated into the national army. These partisan units were severely affected by the war, and it is not unusual to see in their ranks youths aged 14 or 15 armed with kalashnikovs. In the ravaged country it is still the armed groups which are able to feed their men best. The defense minister also directs the military police and the integrated national army, which at present only has three batallions of 1,200 men and one in the process of formation. The rest of ~ the Chad armed forces (12,000 men under Colonel Kamougue's command) refuse to go and fight Hissein Habre's supporters in the East. In face of this complex situation in the lawful armed forces, the number of fighters under the banners of the various faction leaders is estimated to be 30,000. \"We are having difficulties in training our army,\" Adoum Togoi explained to me, \"mainly because of lack of equipment. If the inter-African force, which I prefer to describe as a peace-keeping rather than a neutral force, were willing to give us its equipment, we would be able to put ' down Hissein Habre's rebellion.\" ' After a few days of calm Hissein Habre's forces have in fact resumed fighting in Eastern Chad. The cities of Guereda, Iriba and Adre have apparently fallen into their hands. \"The Libyans' departure is forcing us to rethink our logistics entirely,\" Togoi willingly confided. Foreign Minister Acyl Ahmat, who is regarded as pro-Libyan, is now under the greatest threat. It is his troops, those of the revolutionary democratic council, which have been fighting Hissein Habre in the east for almost a year. Now that the Libyans have gone they are more exposed than anybody. After a short visit to Paris Mr Acyl Ahmat chose to return to Ndjamena. He is sick and rarely leaves his villa on the banks of the Chari, which is guarded by two Toyotas armed with Stalin organs and positioned in his garden.

Jean-Pierre Cot was anxious to participate in the meetings himself at the head of the French delegation, thereb~~ gaining an opportunity to better define the scope of the previously mentioned affinities [ideological] con- cerning the \"self-centered\" development of the People's Republic of the Congo and the aid that France can offer in the undertaking. One dare not forget, however, that the Congo's cooperation with France on the govern- mental level was accompanied, well before 10 May, by parallel relations with the French private sector. At the time of his last visit, President Sassou Nguesso himsclf was the guesr ~f T:~::.: c:aployers and manag�me^*. On 24 September- ~ Congo- lese delegation, made up of Pierre Moussa, minister of planning, Minister of Indus- try Itady and Minister of Mines and Energy Adada, was received at the CNPF [National Council of French Employers] by 250 executives and private meetings with a number of them were subse~,uently held. Several prominent French businessmen then went to Brazzaville and a delegation of P'rench industrialistsy led by the CNPF, will go to Brazzaville in the early months of 1982. The companies represented have no local base and constitute a new and � ~ receptive milieu for operations that will be proposed to them, operations that are ! a part of the 1982-1986 Five-Year Plan, advance notice of which was given to the CNPF by Mousssa in the form of a list of priority projects (see MARCHES TROPICAUX of 25 September, p 2452, and 2 October, p 2510). This direct appeal to French capital and technology demonstrates, first of all, the realism of the Congolese leaders, who have understood that one of the greatest merits of \"offic~al\" cooperation is to provide a favorable milieu for private coop- eration, outside of which it r.emains formal and incomplete. But the fact that the move comes at a time of economic recovery for the Congo, giving its leaders real lati~ude in the choice of partners, constitutes a pledge of confidence to which they are all the more sensitive because it promotes their lnterests. 1 Formula familiar to the minister of cooperation and to President Sassou Nguesso. 28 ' FOR OFF1C[AL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/49: CIA-RDP82-00850R040400080036-0 FOR OFF'iC1AL USE ONLY Financial Situation In a world in crisis, only oil could bring about this recovery, just as it is indirectly responsible for the mess that preceded it. Not only did the overestima- tion of national oil prospects in 1972 cause the reduction in investments under the 1976-1978 Plan, while public spending increased dangerously, but it delayed the working of deposits that that are now the most productive, at a very time when a decline in or disappearance of other mineral resources such as potash began to occur. Oil production fortunately began to rise again in 1978~ after the low point of 1977 with.its total tonnage of 1.8 million. For the time being, it is the task of two companies: ELF-Congo [Gasoline and Lubricants Company of France] and AG7P-Congo [Italian Petroleum Enterprise], both of which have a 20-percent share of the capital. Along with the Congolese Government, they carry out research and operations. Divi- dends the first will be paid in 1981 are based on the proportion of invest- ments after taxes are deducted. Except for the small land deposit of Pointe- Indienne, whose 10,000 tons are now only of symbolic value and which is ELF-Congo's exclusive province, extraction is done in partnership with the two companies (65 per- cent ELF and 35 percent AGIP). AGIP is an operator only for Loango, where the per- centages are reversed. Everywhere elsewhere, for Emeraude, Likouala, Yanga and, beginning in 1982, Senji, rPSponsibility for ~xtraction belongs to ELF. Qverall Congolese production rose to 4 million tons in 1981, compared with 2.4 million in 1978, 2.7 million in 1979 and 3.5 million in 1980. Progress registered at Kilouala and Yanga and the entry into production of Senji allow one to figure 5 million tons in 1982 and from 8 to 9 million tons in 1985.

It is certain that at deposits such as Emeraude, where operat- ing conditions do not permit the recovery of over 8 percent of the known reserves, their application would be of the greatest interest. Another cause for optimism is the development of land and offshore research which, although there are not yet any pasitive results, have the aid of American, Canadian, Brazilian and Swiss companies on the basis of sharing production �tith the government. Within about two years, oil production will be joined by gas production. Reserves are now estimated at some 50 billion cubic meters. A company has been set up by the government and the two operators in order to complete the inventory of r~ sources in this domain. If conclusions are positive, work could lead to the con- struction, as early as 1982, of a liquefaction plant with an annual capacity of 6 million cubic meters. Consequently, hydrocarbons represent the backbone of Congolese development, as the rising dollar solidifies the compensation of oil contracts month after month. A1- ready helped by the consolidation in 1980 of the Congo's debts, the financial situa- tion shows a foreign debt of 265 billion CFA francs, service on which represented some 20 percent of budget receipts in 1981 and 28 percent of all export receipts, which sets the ratio at a rather high level. Moreover, the internal debt amounts to 225 billion CFA francs and its payment does pose problems for enterprise trea- suries. On the whole, however, and despite inflation of about 15 percent, linked to a 40- percent rate of monetary expansion and a 17-percent growth in the volume of short- term loans, the economic situation is quite satisfactory: a surplus in the trade balance and balan~e of payments, a substantial increase in foreign assets; a gross national product that rose 30 percent between 1977 and 1980. While the share of oil receipts in the overall budget (70 percent in 1981 compared with 41 percent in 1979) does express a structural imbalance common to all economies of this type, their stability now seems beyond question. At any rate, they enable the government to redeem substantial public savings (20 percent of the 1981 budget) and to meet its foreign debt commitments. The Congo will have no difficulty in gaining aid on _ the international financial market. The danger would lie in letting itself be carried too far by such ease. Self-Centered Development Meeting the prime needs of the people, defined by their nature and volume rather than value, takes precedence here, as a strategy, over the search for industrial and commercial profits, for which the climate, soil and geographic features would supply the means, and constitutes one of the simplest definitions of this type of development. In fact, the volume of oil extracted turns the terms of the proposi- tion around in the Congo. Priority needs remain to be defined, but they tend to be met only by revenue derived from such extraction. - A few years ago, then Minister of Finance Lopes identified these prime needs as those that would be met by aRriculture primarily based on food crops, the goal being to lead the Congo, thanks to its oil income, to an \"after-oil\" period charac- terized by self-sufficiency. Agriculture still holds a place of honor in the 30 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080036-0 FOR OFF'IC1AL USE ONLY 1982-1986 Plan, although the absence of figures for the projects does not yet allow one to judge its precise role. It justifies a large percentage of the FAC [Aid and Cooperation Fund] program, estimates for the fifth EDF [European Develop- ment Fund] program and a loan of 2.16 billion CFA francs from the African Develop- ment Bank. However, one observes a certain slippage of grojects, from production to consumption and from primary to construction, transport and services. The govern- ment is led into this by political considerations. It is a question of making the equipping of the territory uniform so as to quell regional and ethnic rivalries _ that since independence have contributed to the instabiiity of national life. Tha entire population must be interested in improving the standard of living, affecting interest in work, technical training and creative initiative. As a result, Sassou Nguesso undertook an experiment in May of which few African chiefs of state can boast: a 24-day survey, village to village, on foot, accom- panied by the ministers of agriculture, health and social affairs. He returned from it convinced that meeting prime needs can be obtained only through agriculture, - even if based on food crops, but a true takeoff, including in this production sec- tor, is linked to what we call quality of life, whence the importance attached to often ne~;lected accomplishments: housing, naturally, but rural roads a~ well, telephone booths, out-patient clinics and ambulances within reach of the peasants.
