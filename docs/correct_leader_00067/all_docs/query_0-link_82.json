        "text": "MOSCOW, January 24. /TASS/. Chadian Transitional President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno described on Wednesday his official visit to Russia’s capital city of Moscow as a \"historic\" milestone in the two countries’ bilateral relationship, which was first established nearly 60 years ago in November 1964.\n\n\"This visit is historic. Chad and Russia enjoy long-time relations and the previous visit of the Chadian president was in 1968, when Francois [Tombalbaye] served as the president of Chad,\" he said during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"We hope that this visit will help us to enhance our bilateral relations in all spheres,\" the Chadian leader added.\n\nHe thanked the Russian leadership and citizens for his warm reception.\n\n\"I have arrived from a friendly and brotherly country, which wants to enhance relations with this friendly country,\" the leader of the African country added.\n\nPutin stated earlier that Moscow would be closely following developments in Chad and would help contribute to the stabilization of the situation in the Central African country."
