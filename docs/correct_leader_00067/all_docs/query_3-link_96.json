        "meta_description": "This film, produced by The White House Naval Photographic Unit, presents the activities of President Johnson in October 1968. With the presidential election looming ever closer, President Johnson took time to deliver a number of speeches clarifying his support for Democratic Presidential nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey. October saw the launch of the Apollo 7 space shuttle, visits from the President of Chad, Francois Tombalbaye, and Prime Minister of New Zealand, Keith Holoake, and the birth of President Johnson's second grandchild. Nevertheless, his focus this month was squarely upon the Vietnam peace talks being conducted in Paris. Throughout the month, President Johnson met with his advisors and military commanders, before announcing on the last day of October that he was calling for a halting of the bombing campaign in Vietnam.",
