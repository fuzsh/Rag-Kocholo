        "text": "Remadji Hoinathy was born in 1978 in Sarh, in southern Chad. An anthropologist and former professor at the University of N'Djamena, he is now a researcher at the Dakar office of the Institute for Security Studies (ISS).\n\nWhat is your first memory of contact with France?\n\nRemadji Hoinathy My most vivid memory is of a friendship with two young teachers who were sent as volunteers to the school I attended at age 14, in 1993-1994. Charles Lwanga College was a Jesuit institution in Sarh. One taught history, geography and French; the other, mathematics. Our friendship went beyond teaching. They talked to me and my cousin about France as it really was. They came to visit us as a family. This was the first direct contact with people from France living in our conditions.\n\nWhat about your first trip to France?\n\nI had not gone directly to France, but to Germany, to register for my anthropology thesis. I stayed there for a month and, on my way back, I made a point of changing my ticket to go through Paris. This was not accidental. I wanted to see the capital so I could visit all those monuments I had heard about. But it was also because, like any young person who grew up in a French-speaking country, I had this romantic image of France. Our history and literature classes take us back to France, and even when we talk about African literature, it was in Paris where those proponents of Blackness studied and flourished. It was also an opportunity to see an aunt who lives in Argenteuil, a suburb of Paris, as well as friends.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Africa's moment of reckoning with France\n\nIn Chad, perhaps a little more than elsewhere, France remains a major political player. How have you seen it evolve over time?\n\nThe further you go in life, the more you understand certain things, and the more you change your perception. At the beginning of my graduate studies, I began to see the long-standing relationship between France and Chad more clearly. It is a very tortuous relationship, with changes of direction on who to support. But it's one that has continuity – that of the defense of French interests and those who can provide that defense. It does not matter that this leads to changes in alliances. For example, France supported the regime of François Tombalbaye [president from 1960 to 1975] in his fight against various rebellions, before rejecting him. This is also what it did later with Hissène Habré, gradually abandoning him in favor of Idriss Déby.\n\n\"France supports a regime that pretends to be democratic, without ever achieving it,\" Remadji Hoinathy\n\nFrom Idriss Déby onward, France’s political agenda has not changed and has focused on stability. Deaf and blind, France does not seem to understand anything here except the preservation of this stability, whatever the cost. It feels like the La Baule speech [delivered in 1990 by François Mitterrand as part of the 16th Conference of Heads of State of Africa and France ] on the need for African partners to become more democratic was not aimed at Chad.\n\nHere, France supports a regime that pretends to be democratic, without ever achieving it. However, this does not exclude other forms of relations through cultural, university and academic cooperation, which is not inconsiderable. There are also the French Development Agency projects, which are important for the country. This is the paradox of such an important partner, which makes investments locally but has no clear agenda in terms of democracy and human rights.\n\nWhen Emmanuel Macron went to Idriss Déby's funeral in April 2021, did you see it as a necessary mark of loyalty to an ally or as the endorsement of dynastic succession?\n\nSymbolically, this trip was unfortunately catastrophic for France's image, especially among Chadian youth and in the eyes of a proportion of Africans. For the sake of military cooperation between the two countries, it was important for Emmanuel Macron to come to the funeral of such a close partner. It was also important to come and get a feel for the situation on the ground and to ensure that the transition would go in the direction that the Chadians wanted.\n\nBut this appearance was a failure because once again, Emmanuel Macron came to reiterate that stability will be the main agenda and that this means keeping those who had immediately come to power [after the death of Idriss Déby in combat]. Paris still feels that our country is on a collision course, that it could fall at any moment and that strong regimes and strong men are therefore needed, at the expense of strong institutions. We should go beyond this automatic perception.\n\nDo you think that after the repression of October 20, which according to an official report left about 50 people dead, Paris had the right response?\n\nThe condemnation was not strong enough. I am not saying that France supported what happened, but in terms of communication, once again it missed the point. When I say \"condemned,\" I am not necessarily pointing the finger at anyone, because there were significant mistakes by law enforcement and, to a certain extent, by the demonstrators. But the statements were not commensurate with what happened and did not sufficiently emphasize the need for the parties to calm the situation, establish responsibility and return to the negotiating table.\n\nRead more Subscribers only France forced into redefining military presence in Africa\n\nDoes it seem to you that France's policy in Chad, and more broadly on the continent, is now trapped by its fear of losing its zones of influence?\n\nIn Chad, Paris is not defending economic interests, but geostrategic ones. This rationale is reinforced by the fact that the shadow of Russia is everywhere in Africa. In Chad, it is at the southern gate, in the Central African Republic. The consequence is that this reinforces the more or less blind support for regimes that have understood that it is useful to have jokers in their game. Today, that joker is the threat of turning to the Russians. This brings us back to some of the practices of the Cold War: Back me up or I'll switch sides. Unfortunately, I get the feeling France is overly sensitive to this threat.\n\nHow would you like to see French policy toward Chad evolve in 2023?\n\nI would say an effort to refocus on democracy and human rights issues. Supporting stability from a purely military and security point of view, undertaking development projects in areas of agriculture and health and supporting higher education are not enough to get a country out of a rut. Nor are they enough to promote an image of France as a country of human rights if it is unable to see how democracy works among its partners. What is really needed is a shift that allows France to be not only a friend of the regimes that succeed one another in Chad but also a friend of Chadians as a nation.\n\n'From Dakar to Djibouti, a tour of the Africa-France relationship'\n\nCyril Bensimon\n\nTranslation of an original article published in French on lemonde.fr; the publisher may only be liable for the French version."
