The labor organizations section of each digest was contributed by the Division of International Trade Union Organizations of the Bureau of International Labor Affairs. Source material used in preparing the digests included reports of U.S. Embassies and official publications of the individual countries. The digests herein appear in the following order: Algeria Angola Basutoland [Lesotho] Bechuanaland [Botswana] Burundi Cameroon Central African Republic Chad Congo (Brazzaville) Congo (Kinshasa) Dahomey Empire of Ethiopia Equatorial Guinea French Somaliland Gabon Gambia Ghana Guinea Ivory Coast Kenya Liberia Libya Malagasy Republic Malawi Mali Mauritania Mauritius Morocco Mozambique Niger Nigeria Portuguese Guinea Reunion Rwanda Senegal Seychelles Sierra Leone Somali Republic South Africa South West Africa Southern Rhodesia Spanish Sahara Sudan Swazi land Tanzania Togo Tunisia Uganda United Arab Republic Upper Volta Zambia iii LABOR DIGEST No. 93 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 1966 BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS This is one of a series of brief notes on labor conditions prepared in the Office of Foreign Labor and Trade of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for inclusion in the Directory o f Labor Organizations—Africa, jointly prepared and published in 1966 by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs and the Bureau of Labor Statistics * LABOR CONDITIONS IN ALGERIA Algeria, located in northwestern Africa along the Mediterranean Sea, has an area of about 920,000 square miles and, in 1966, had a population between 11 and 12 million. Factors Affecting Labor Political. Algeria achieved its independence from France in July 1962. Following a coup against the government of Ahmed Ben Bella in June 1965, a 26member Council of the Revolution became the highest authority, holding both executive and legislative powers. The National Liberation Front (Front de Liberation Nationale--FLN) is the only legally recognized political party. The principal executive organ is the Council of Ministers, whose members serve at the pleasure of the Council of the Revolution. Colonel Houari Boumedienne is president of both the Council of the Revolution and the Council of Ministers. Economic. The Algerian economy is divided into two sectors. One, a highly developed modern sector of agriculture and industry, is still seriously dislocated as a result of the precipitous departure, immediately prior toAlgerian independence, of the French resident population, which had been a substan­ tial number. The other, a traditional sector, has its base largely in subsistence farming; about two-thirds of the population are in this sector. Despite the predominance of agriculture, it accounted in 1964 for only about 23 percent of the gross national product (GNP). Industry and public works contributed 13 per­ cent; petroleum, 24 percent; administration, 22 percent; and services, 17 per­ cent. The former French-owned farms in the modern agricultural sector are now managed largely by the farmers themselves (’’worker managed”), under Government supervision. Industry and commerce (except for Government-controlled trade in some mass-consumption items) are still privately operated to a large extent. The principal agricultural products are wine, grain, vegetables, and citrus fruits; the most important industries are food processing, construction, and metalwork­ ing. The country has abundant mineral resources, ranking 10th in the world in 1964 in the production of petroleum, but it must import certain mass-consumption agricultural products. About 40 percent of the best arable land is devoted to the production of grapes for wine, which accounts for about 33 percent of the value of agricultural production and is the second largest export after petro­ leum. In 1963, the per capita GNP was estimated by experts to be US$185. Social. The population was 88.7 percent Moslem and 11.3 percent nonMoslem prior to independence, but the European population has declined to about 100.000 since 1962. Islam, the official religion, is practiced almost univer­ sally. Although the official language is Arabic, French is spoken widely, and many Government publications are available only in French. The illiteracy rate among people above 15 is estimated at 80 percent. In the 1965-66 school year, about 1,418,000 students were in elementary schools and 100,000 in secondary schools. About 60 percent of the children between 6 and 14 years of age were in school, which is double the rate that existed among Moslem children at the time of independence. Manpower and Employment Employment and Unemployment. In early 1966, there were an estimated 900.000 employed wage and salary earners, including the Armed Forces (80,000). Of these, some 350,000 worked in the agricultural sector, including the selfmanaged farms. In addition, approximately 300,000 Algerians held jobs in France. Estimates of the total labor force vary considerably (a current census was begun in early 1966), but the Government's estimate was approximately 2.2 million in 1963, which was also the population figure for all males between 15 and 55. Government estimates on unemployment range from 370,000 to 2 million-the latter figure including many persons employed part time. In 1963, there were an estimated 550,000 underemployed males in agriculture alone. Productivity, Skills, and Training. Productivity suffers in both agri­ culture and industry because of low educational attainment, the shortage of skilled workers and technicians, poor health conditions, lack of managerial skills, and the breakdown in credit and marketing channels following the depar­ ture of Europeans. Industrial production in 1964 was estimated to be 50 percent below capacity, primarily because of the loss of skills and capital held by the Europeans. In agriculture, the highest level of productivity is on the large farms, which produce mainly grapes for wine. The Government is expanding vocational training facilities and providing other industrial short-term courses, night classes , and apprenticeship programs. In 1963, there were about 7,000 students in vocational and technical schools, and enrollment is reported to have increased substantially since then. The French Government and various international agencies are helping to make up for a short­ age of Algerian teachers and administrators in vocational training programs. Labor Standards Labor Legislation. Algerian labor legislation, most of which was in­ herited from France, is in the process of being redrafted. Work on a new labor 2 code has been slowed by the difficulty of having it cover so many different types of enterprises: State operated, private, mixed, and worker managed. In the meantime, the French Labor Code, modified in minor ways by decrees, still ap­ plies. It provides for compensation for accidents and diseases arising from work, social insurance benefits, family allowances, payment of a minimum wage, 1 day of rest per week, pay for all legal holidays, paid vacations based on length of service, maternity benefits, and protection of women and children un­ der 18 years of age against arduous and night work. The Constitution recognizes the right of workers to organize into unions, to strike, and to participate in the management of enterprises. Separate social security programs provide bene­ fits for agricultural, nonagricultural, and Government workers. Administration and Practice. Labor legislation is administered and en­ forced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, assisted by its eight re­ gional offices. The inspection office of the Ministry of Transport has similar functions for the transportation industry, as does the Ministry of Agriculture for the agricultural sector. Wages, Hours, Prices, and Level of Living In 1966, the minimum wage was US$1.53 a day for agricultural workers and US$0.23 to US$0.28 an hour for nonagricultural workers. Minimum wages, theo­ retically tied to the cost-of-living index, have not gone up since April 1963. In the worker-managed sector, workers theoretically are not in the role of wage earners but receive advances on \"profits.” In practice, they have been paid salaries, supplemented by payments in kind in the form of housing, clothing, and produce, especially in the agricultural sector. A large part of their medical and most of their hospital costs are covered by social security and programs for indigent persons. The workweek in industry is officially 40 hours but can be extended for various reasons, including makeup time for hours lost by strikes. The maximum hours of overtime legally permitted are 20 a week, with time-and-a-quarter paid for 41 to 48 hours, and time-and-a-half for more than 48 hours. Overtime is now discouraged by labor organizations and the Government in order to spread em­ ployment among the unemployed. In the agricultural sector, maximum working hours permitted by law are 2,400 a year; many exceptions are allowed. There are 10 paid legal holidays. The cost-of-living index increased 7.5 percent between 1961 and 1963, while wages and salaries in the industrial sector rose 10 percent. Many people in the larger cities are well dressed, well fed, and well housed, but millions of others, particularly those in the countryside, live at the subsistence level with inadequate housing and sanitary facilities. Employer Organizations The Algerian General Economic Confederation (Confederation Generate £conomique Algerienne--CGEA) is the principal employer organization. There are also chambers of commerce in the principal cities, and most principal profes­ sions and trades have their own employer groups. The number of organizations which engage in formalized labor-management relations is small, however. 3 Labor Organizations The General Union of Algerian Workers tUnion Generate des Travailleurs Algeriens--UGTA), the nation's only trade union center, claims a total member­ ship of 320,000, or about 35 percent of all wage and salary earners. The UGTA, which was formed in 1956, has a close relationship to the nation's only legally recognized political party, the F L N , dating from the preindependence period. The UGTA is affiliated with both the All-African Trade Union Federation and the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions. In 1963, it dis­ affiliated from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, with which it had been affiliated since 1956. The UGTA is organized into both geographic centers and industrial federa­ tions. In 1966, there were 18 regional centers and 12 national industrial fed­ erations. Most of the latter have been formed since 1964. Labor-Management Relations Only two national collective bargaining agreements have been negotiated since independence--one for the construction trades and the other for construct­ i o n material manufacturers. Remnants of preindependence contracts apply in a few other industries. Some individual plants have concluded written contracts. However, labor practices are not generally formalized in union contracts at present, although the UGTA is pushing for this goal. The law requires that col­ lective disputes be handled through regional conciliation boards composed of employer, employee, and Government representatives; in practice, the Labor Min­ istry takes over this role. Works councils, made up of elected employee repre­ sentatives but chaired by a management representative, are obligatory in all enterprises, industrial and nonindustrial, of more than 50 employees. These councils are in the process of expanding their jurisdiction to encompass direc­ tion of plant-level vocational training, including the choice of candidates for training. Many private owners argue that this enlargement of function in effect assigns to labor the responsibility for actions affecting promotions. 4 LABOR DIGEST No. 94 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 1966 BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS This is one of a series of brief notes on labor conditions prepared in the Office of Foreign Labor and Trade of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for inclusion in the Directory o f Labor Organizations—Africa, jointly prepared and published in 1966 by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. LABOR CONDITIONS IN ANGOLA Angola is a Portuguese territory located in southwest Africa. It has an area of 481,351 square miles and had a population of about 5.2 million in 1965. Factors Affecting Labor Political. Angola, an overseas province of Portugal, is controlled by the Portuguese Ministry of Overseas Provinces and administered by a Governor General who is appointed by the Portuguese Council of Ministers. It is repre­ sented in the Portuguese National Assembly. The Governor General is assisted by a Legislative Council, of which a majority of the members are elected on the basis of limited suffrage, and advised by an Economic and Social Council. The Portuguese National Union is the only legal political group. In 1961, the In­ digenous Statute was repealed, removing*restrictions on the freedom of movement, employment, and wages of the native Angolan and making him a citizen with equal rights under law. Economic. Most of the population engage in subsistence agriculture* Coffee and cotton are grown on large European-owned plantations. The principal activities in the limited industrial sector are the processing of primary prod­ ucts (fish, vegetable oils, sugar, cotton, and meat), production of cement and paper, and refining of oil. Coffee, the leading export, accounted for 49 percent of the total in 1964; diamonds, about 12 percent; and fish, about 12 percent. Iron ore, manganese, sisal, corn, and petroleum were also important. The esti­ mated average per capita annual income is US$100 to US$150. Social. An estimated 95 percent of the population in 1965 were African; the remainder were European and other. Portugal has promoted immigration to An­ gola; in 1960, about 200,000 Europeans lived there. The principal African tribes are the Mbundu/Ovimbundu and the Kimbundu , which constitute about one-third and one-fourth of the total population, respectively. According to estimates, about 60 percent of the population in 1965 were animists and most of the remainder were Christians. Portuguese is the official language. An estimated 5 per­ cent of the population were literate in 1965, in which year approximately 15 percent of the children of school age (ages 5-14) were enrolled in educational institutions. Manpower and Employment Employment and Unemployment. The total labor force in 1961 was estimated at about 2,056,400, of whom 1,670,000, or81percent, were engaged in subsistence agriculture. Europeans, who comprised about 15 percent of the total (excluding persons engaged in subsistence farming), constituted the managerial, supervi­ sory, and most of the technical and skilled labor force; they accounted for 49 percent of the total in industry, business, trade, and the professions, 36 per­ cent in the public sector (Government service and Government corporations), and 3 percent in each of the other categories. About 180,000 Africans in agri­ culture and mining were contract laborers under a law (since repealed) which required all African males over age 18 to work at least 6 months a year. According to official estimates, the total number of wage and salary earn­ ers in 1965 was 408,369 (excluding household servants and seasonal farm la­ borers) , of whom 367,351, or 90 percent, were in private enterprise and 4l,01E in Government. The largest number (41 percent) were engaged in agriculture, cattle ranching, and fishing, followed by civil construction, services, and Government, which each employed 10 percent of the total; 8 percent were engaged in communications and transportation, 7 percent each in mining and manufactur­ ing, 6 percent in commerce, and the remainder in other activities. Unemployment is extensive in urban areas, and underemployment character­ izes especially the subsistence sector of agriculture. Productivity, Skills, and Training. Low levels of education, inadequate training facilities, the lack of skilled labor, and poor health and nutrition of workers contribute to low productivity in all sectors of the economy. In agriculture, traditional and wasteful production methods and the migratory life of Africans result in low productivity. The Government's efforts to expand and improve the level of production, such as by means of stabilization projects to encourage Africans to remain in one place, technical assistance, and the dis­ tribution of higher quality seeds, are hampered by shortages of funds and an inadequate number of technicians. The Government has taken steps to improve livestock raising, which also follows traditional patterns, and to modernize the fishing industry. In 1965, of the wage and salary earners not employed by the Government, 241,351 (mainly in agriculture) were unskilled, 65,500 were listed as semi­ skilled and 65*000 as skilled. A decree of 1963 provided for the establishment of a number of vocational schools at the elementary and secondary levels. An artisan training school is planned for 1966. For the most part, training for white and mulatto workers is provided on the job and by the syndicates, some social service organizations, and the Stabilization of African Labor Program. 2 Labor Standards Labor Legislation, The Portuguese Rural Labor Code for Overseas Prov­ inces (1962) contains regulation's covering recruitment, the employment of immi­ grants, labor contracts , prof essional and vocational training, working conditions , wages, hours of work, holidays, women workers and child labor, social security benefits, professional organizations (syndicates), and enforcement machinery. It provides certain irrevocable rights, such as the right to refuse to perform work not called for in a contract and the right to receive wages at specified intervals. A number of the regulations have been amplified in implementing decrees. The Minimum Wages and Salaries Law (1959) , as amended, applies mainly to members of labor syndicates. Almost all Europeans, but relatively few Afri­ cans, were covered by its provisions. Administration and Practice. The Portuguese Government established the Labor, Social Security, and Welfare Institute in 1963 to implement labor legis­ lation and social welfare programs. It replaced the Office of Native Affairs. The Institute formulates standards relating to labor and promotes revision of labor legislation. The broadening of the laws to make them applicable to the entire population has taxed the capacity of the small Institute, and enforcement is uneven. Wages, Hours, Prices, and Level of Living The average monthly wage for unskilled labor in 1965 was US$15 to US$20, of which about half was generally paid in subsistence benefits. Semiskilled and skilled workers, concentrated in the urban areas of Luanda, Lobito, Benguela, and Nova Lisboa, received an average monthly wage of US$60 toUS$120, depending on the kind and level of skill. In the fishing industry, wages are determined by a Government-sponsored form of collective bargaining between employer guilds and labor syndicates. The 1962 labor code provides for introduction of an 8-hour day, 48-hour workweek. In practice, hours worked per week vary from 44 to 48. The level of living for most of that of metropolitan Portugal. Large in the traditional manner, outside the salary earners generally have a higher index (1938=100) rose from 310 in 1957 the European population is equivalent to segments of the African population live money economy; Africans who are wage and standard of living. The cost-of-living to 350 in 1959 and 385 in 1964. Employer Organizations Business firms are represented by several quasi-official agencies within the principal segments of the economy. The Commercial Association has branches in most urban centers which represent member firms engaged in wholesale and re­ tail trade; manufacturers and industrial concerns are represented by the Indus­ trial Association; the Institute of Fishing Industries of Angola regulates the fishing industry and represents its members in local fishing centers through fish guilds; the Agricultural Association represents agricultural interests, especially those of large enterprises. The functions of these agencies, which are similar to those of protective agencies and chambers of commerce, include 3 assisting their members with regard to legislation bodies of control in implementing regulations. and serving as additional Labor Organizations No trade union organizations exist in Portugal or its overseas terri­ tory of Angola. Labor is organized in syndicates which function essentially as beneficent societies. The syndicates are defined in the Rural Labor Code as an integral part of the corporative organization of the nation. However, the syndi­ cates in Angola are autonomous from those in Portugal and, unlike in Portugal, membership is not compulsory. There are presently four syndicates in Angola with a total membership of about 55,000, or approximately 13 percent of the wage and salary earners. Two national trade union centers have been established outside Angola for Angolan workers: The General League of Angolan Workers in Exile (Ligue Generale des Travailleurs de 1 1Angola--LGTA) and the Committee for Union of Action and Angolan Trade Union Coordination (Comite d'Unite d*Action et de Co-ordination Syndicale de 1 'Angola--CUACSA). Both have their headquarters in Kinshasa (for­ merly Leopoldville), Republic of the Congo. The LGTA, which has an estimated 1,500 members, has been affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and its African Regional Organization (AFRO) since 1961. It is also a member of the African Trade Union Confederation (ATUC). The CUACSA, a competing organization with an estimated 200 members, was formed in 1964 by amalgamation of the National Union of Angolan Workers in Exile (Union Nationale des Travailleurs Angolais--UNTA) and the Confederation of Free Angolan Unions (Confederation des Syndicats Libres Angolais--CSLA)0 Labor-Management Relations Collective bargaining was begun in 1963, with labor and employer repre­ sentatives meeting under the chairmanship of the Labor Institute. Since strikes and lockouts are illegal, the procedure resembles arbitration. Agreements exist in the fishing, petroleum, and insurance sectors. Grievances and disputes are settled by labor courts. Municipal labor tribunals were set up in 1962 to ad­ judicate minor grievances. A 1965 decree provided for regular labor courts in three districts in order to expedite the handling of the growing number of dis­ putes stemming from the abolition of the Indigenous Statute in 1961 and the Portuguese Rural Labor Code for Overseas Provinces in 1962; their abolition caused thousands of native litigants to come before the courts. 4 LABOR DIGEST Ho. 95 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS 1966 This is one of a series of brief notes on labor conditions prepared in the Office of Foreign Labor and Trade of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for inclusion in the Directory o f Labor Organizations—Africa, jointly prepared and published in 1966 by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs and the Bureau of Labor S tatistics. LABOR CONDITIONS IN BASUTOLAND Basutoland, a colony, is a British-protected enclave within the Republic of South Africa. It has an area of 11,716 square miles and, in 1964, had a popu­ lation estimated at 900,000. Basutoland was expected to become independent on October 4, 1966. The 1964 Constitution provides for a 60-member National Assembly, elected on the basis of universal suffrage, and a Senate, consisting of 22 principal chiefs and 100 others nominated by the Paramount Chief. The Prime Minister is appointed from the Assembly by the Paramount Chief. The three major political parties are the majority Basutoland National Party, the Basutoland Congress Party, and the Marematlou Freedom Party. The economy is based primarily on agriculture and livestock. Most farm­ ing is done at the subsistence level on small, individual holdings. The main crops are corn, wheat, and sorghum. Wool and mohair are the main exports. The estimated annual average per capita earnings are US$50 for the domestic popula­ tion and US$109 for workers living abroad. The latest census (1956) revealed that 99.5 percent of the population of 641,674 were Africans, and the remainder were of European, Asian, and other ex­ tractions. The nation is known as Lesotho, and the people are the Basuto or the Mosotho. The official languages are Sesotho and English; the latter is spoken by the educated. Of the total population in 1956, 71 percent were Christian and 29 percent were of other faiths. About 60 percent of persons 15 years of age and over are reported to be literate to some degree. Primary education is free but not compulsory. In 1960, 136,111 students, or about 50 percent of the schoolage population, were enrolled in 1,110 schools; most were in primary schools. The majority of the domestic population is engaged in growing crops and raising livestock. Manufacturing is in its incipient stages. The public sector, particularly the Government, is the largest employer. Some 43 percent of the adult male population are employed in South Africa, mainly in mining. Among other factors, the small size of holdings and traditional farming methods, which have reduced the fertility of the soil and have caused serious erosion, are responsible for low productivity. Further, the workers* skills are limited. There are 23 secondary schools, several vocational training insti­ tutions for craftsmen, 2 technical schools, a small commercial school, and 7 training schools for postprimary teachers. In addition, international organiza­ tions are sponsoring a number of rural training programs. Advanced studies are available at the University of Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and Swaziland. The principal labor laws are the Master and Servants Act (1856), the Wages Proclamation (1936), the Employment of Women and Children Proclamation (1937), the African Labour Proclamation (1942), the Trade Unions and Trade Dis­ putes Proclamation (1942, revised in the Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Act, 1964), and the Workmen's Compensation Proclamation (1948). A National Advisory Committee on Labour, composed of employee and employer representatives, ad­ vises on labor legislation. There is no social security legislation. A Depart­ ment of Labour was established in 1963 under the Department of Home and External Affairs. The minimum daily wage for unskilled laborers employed by the Government was US$0.50 in 1962 and 1963. Prices for basic commodities were stable in the period 1961-63. Employees in Government departments work a 5-day week. The principal employer organization is the Union of Employers of Basuto­ land . There is no information available on present trade union membership in Basutoland. The Basutoland Congress of Trade Unions, formed in 1961, is no longer in existence, and it is not known if any national trade union centers presently exist. Only five trade unions have registered under the Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Act, 1964, which went into effect in April 1965. There isno wage-fixing machinery; however, Wages Proclamation No. 37 of 1936 provides for the establishment of a Board of Enquiry to examine wages and conditions of employment. Trade unions and employers have made efforts to en­ gage in joint consultation and bargaining. District labor committees review changes in wages of Government daily paid workers and employees and hear indi­ vidual grievances. A number of works committees have been established. Major industrial disputes are few. On October 4, 1966, the United Kingdom Colony of Basutoland received its independence and changed its name to the Kingdom of Lesotho. 2 LABOR DIGEST No. 96 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS 1966 This is one of a series of brief notes on labor conditions prepared in the Office of Foreign Labor and Trade of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for inclusion in the Directory o f Labor Organizations—Africa, jointly prepared and published in 1966 by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, LABOR CONDITIONS IN BECHUANALAND Bechuanaland, located north of the Republic of South Africa, has an estimated area of about 275,000 square miles and had a population of about 550,000 in 1964. Factors Affecting Labor Political. Bechuanaland, a protectorate of the United Kingdom, is sched­ uled to become independent on September 30, 1966, and will be known thereafter as Botswana. Under the new Constitution of 1965, the British Commissioner is the chief administrative officer with the status of Governor. He presides over and is advised by the Cabinet, composed of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, and five other Ministers from the Legislative Assembly. The Commis­ sioner is assisted by an advisory, nonpolitical Public Service Commission in performing his duties connected with the public service. There is also a House of Chiefs, composed of the chiefs of the eight principal tribes and four other members elected by and from among the subchiefs of four districts. The principal political party is the Bechuanaland Democratic Party; others are the Bechuana­ land People1s Party (BPP) and the Botswana Independence Party (BIP). Economic. The economy is based primarily on livestock raising, in which about 98 percent of the population are engaged. Only 5 percent of the arable land is cultivated. Sorghum is the major crop. The country's small industrial sector consists of the production of asbestos, manganese, gold, and silver. The gross national product per capita is estimated to be under US$100 per year. Social. Ninety-nine percent of the total population are African; the remainder are European, Asian, and Colored (people of mixed race). The Bechuana, a Bantu people, comprise eight main tribal groupings, each of which lives in and, to a great extent, administers its own tribal territory. Major tribes are the Bamangwato, Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Batawana, Bakgatla, Bamalete, Barolong, and Batlokwa. About 85 percent of the population are animists and 15 percent are Christians. English is the official language; Sechuana is the main native language. Literacy is minimal; however, the education program is being rapidly expanded. At the end of 1964, there were 241 primary schools and 8 secondary schools. Manpower and Employment Employment and Unemployment. An estimated 240,000 persons are engaged in agriculture, generally at the subsistence level; the majority are self-employed farmers. The number of wage and salary earners outside agriculture in 1964 was 13,850, of whom 6,000 were employed in central and local government service, 2,500 in construction, 2,000 in commerce, 1,000 in manufacturing, 1,000 in trans­ port, storage, and communications, 850 in mining and quarrying, and 500 in utilities. An estimated 35,000 persons from Bechuanaland were employed in the Republic of South Africa, including 24,418 in mining, on contracts of up to 9 months; 8,000 in industry, commerce, and domestic service; and about 2,000 in seasonal agricultural work. Productivity, Skills, and Training. Training facilities include St. Joseph’s College, the Dutch Reformed Church Homecrafts Centre, the Bechuanaland Training Centre, the Commerce and Adult Education School, agricultural and veterinary schools, and two teacher-training institutes.

Legislation includes the Employment Law (1963), as amended, which covers labor contracts, wages, employment of women and children, recruitment of labor for work inside and outside the territory, health, and forced labor; the Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Proclamation (1949) and the Trade Unions Registration Rules (1964); the Workmen's Compensation Proclamation; the Wages Boards Proclamation; the Mining Health Proclamation; the Works and Machin­ ery Proclamation; and the Shop Hours Proclamation. Administration and Practice. Legislation is enforced by the Labour Branch (established in 1963), headed by the Commissioner of Labour. The Branch makes proposals for labor policy to ensure the enforcement and administration of labor legislation, is responsible for compiling labor statistics, and conciliates major labor disputes. It has 25 part-time district officers. Wages, Hours, Prices, and Level of Living The minimum hourly wage for Government manual workers in 1964 was US$0.08 for unskilled workers, US$0.14 for semiskilled workers, and US$0.25 for skilled workers. Prevailing minimum monthly wage rates in private establishments were US$4.20 in commerce, US$8.40 in services, US$14.00 in manufacturing, and US$25.20 in transportation. Employer Organizations No information is available on employer organizations. Labor Organizations land. No information is available on total trade union membership in Bechuana­ Although no national trade union centers are known to exist, recent efforts 2 have been made to establish the Bechuanaland Federation of Labour. There are six registered trade unions in the territory. Labor-Management Relations At the present time, there is no legislation which deals with industrial disputes. The Wages Boards Proclamation and the Trade Unions and Trade Dis­ putes Proclamation provide for setting up Wages Councils and Industrial Coun­ cils. In practice, disputes have been dealt with by negotiation between the parties, with conciliation by the Commissioner of Labour. 3 LABOR DIGEST No. 97 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS 1966 This is one of a series of brief notes on labor conditions prepared in the Office of Foreign Labor and Trade of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for inclusion in the Directory o f Labor Organizations—Africa, jointly prepared and published in 1966 by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs and the Bujre^u of Labor S ta tistics. LABOR CONDITIONS IN THE KINGDOM OF BURUNDI Burundi, located in east-central Africa, has an area of 10,747 square miles and, in mid-1965, had an estimated population of 2.8 million. Burundi was part of the former Belgian United Nations Trusteeship Terri­ tory of Ruanda-Urundi until it achieved independence on July 1, 1962, and became a constitutional monarchy patterned on the Belgian system. The Mwami, or King, is the head of state and appoints the Prime Minister, who selects his Cabinet, which must be approved by the National Assembly. The Constitution provides for an elected bicameral Legislature, an assembly consisting of 33 members, and a Senate of 16. Elections are held every 6 years. The only political party at present is the National Party of Unity and Progress (UPRONA). Approximately 95 percent of the population live in rural areas. A large majority are engaged in subsistence agriculture and are outside the money econ­ omy. The principal export product is coffee, followed by cotton and hides. Industry is limited and small scale. In 1964, the gross national product per capita was about US$40, one of the lowest in the world. The Hutu, or Bahutu, comprise the largest ethnic group, accounting for about 86 percent of the indigenous population; the Tutsi, or Batutsi, comprise 13 percent, and the Twa, 1 percent. In 1960, there were 7,000 Europeans and Asians in the country. The official languages are French and Kirundi, the principal native language. Approximately 50 percent of the population are Christians; the remainder are animists or practice Islam. Although children aged 7-16 are entitled to free education, the percentage of children of primary school age enrolled in primary schools is small, and only about 1 percent go on to secondary or technical schools. The official University of Bujumbura provides higher education. The labor force is predominantly unskilled. Unemployment has not been measured. Underemployment is probably extensive in the large subsistence sector. No data are available to indicate the size of the labor force in Burundi. In Ruanda-Urundi, the approximate distribution of the 97,000 wage and salary earners in 1960 was 23,000 in agriculture, 19,000 in service trades, 12,000 in trans­ port, 11,000 in construction, 10,000 in mining, 10,000 in retail trade, 6,000 in manufacturing, and the remainder in other activities. A decree issued in December 1963, modifying a 1964 decree establishing a National Labour Council, provides that the chairman of the Council be the Minister of Social Affairs or his representative. A decree of the Minister of Social Affairs, effective January 1, 1963, established minimum daily wage rates for unskilled workers. The wage rates for 8 hours of work per day are composed of (a) wages, (b) a food ration or its countervalue, and (c) lodging or its countervalue; these vary by locale and according to the classification of the work as heavy, ordinary, or light. Under the decree, workers in Bujumbura engaged in heavy work receive 52 percent more pay per day than workers in the interior; those engaged in ordinary work, 54 percent more; and those engaged in light work, 60 percent more. The daily rate established in Bujumbura for heavy work was US$0.30; for ordinary work, US$0.27; and for light work, US$0.25. The countervalue of food rations was US$0.30, US$0.25, and US$0.17, respectively, and of lodging for all types of work, US$0.10. For work outside Bujumbura, the daily rates of pay, including all items, were US$0.46 for heavy work, US$0.40 for ordinary work, and US$0.32 for light work. The cost-of-living index in Bujumbura (April 1963=100) was 132 in April 1965 and 142 in February 1966. Available data indicate that there is a Chamber of Commerce and a small association of manufacturers, most of whose members are also members of the Chamber of Commerce. No information is available on the present trade union membership in Burundi. Of the four existing trade union organizations, only two are known to be active at present: The Union of Free Workers of Burundi (Synidcat Libre des Travailleurs du Burundi--SLTB) and the Union of Administrative Agents of Burundi (Syndicat des Agents de 1 Administration du Burundi--SAAB). The SAAB, which was formed in 1964, is composed of all civil servants. Two centers which are presently inactive are the Christian Union of Burundi (Syndicat Chretien du Burundi--SCB) , which claimed 1,000 members in 1963, and the Federation of Workers of Burundi (Federation des Travailleurs du Burundi --FTB), which claimed 3,000 members in 1963. The SCB, an affiliate of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (Confederation Internationale des Syndicats Chretiens--CISC) and its African regional organization, the PanAfrican Union of Believing Workers (Union Panafricaine des Travailleurs Croyants --UPTC), has been inactive since an attempted coup d'etat in October 1965. The FTB, an affiliate of the All-African Trade Union Federation (AATUF), was banned from activity by the Minister of Justice in 1965 following the assassination of the Prime Minister. 2 LABOR DIGEST No. 98 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS 1966 This is one of a series of brief notes on labor conditions prepared in the Office of Foreign Labor and Trade of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for inclusion in the Directory o f Labor Organizations—Africa, jointly prepared and published in 1966 by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs and the Bureau of Labor S ta tistics. LABOR CONDITIONS IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON Cameroon, situated on the Gulf of Guinea along the west coast of Africa, has an area of 183,381 square miles (166,800 in East Cameroon and 16,581 in West Cameroon) and had an estimated population of over 5 million in 1965. Factors Affecting Labor Political. Cameroon, which became independent in 1960, is a federal republic consisting of East Cameroon, formerly administered by the French, and West Cameroon, formerly administered by the British. The Constitution of 1961 provides for a President andaV i c e President (one from each of the States), who are elected by universal adult suffrage for 5-year terms, and a Cabinet. While the two States have considerable autonomy in local matters, the President ap­ points the Prime Minister of each State, as well as the Federal Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries (whom he may also dismiss). The National Assembly, composed of 40 representatives from East Cameroon and 10 from West Cameroon, exercises legislative power. Representatives are elected for 5-year terms by universal adult suffrage. The major political party in East Cameroon has been the Union Camerounaise (UC), the party of President Ahmadou Ahidjo; the Kamerun National Democratic Party (KNDP) of West Cameroon was the party of Vice Presi­ dent John Foncha. However, on June 13, 1966, theUC andtheKNDP, along with two other West Cameroon-based parties, agreed to merge into a single party known as the Union Nationale Camerounaise (UNC). Economic. Cameroon’s economy is predominantly agricultural. Coffee and cocoa, the principal exports, are produced by thousands of Cameroonians farming small family holdings. In 1964, coffee accounted for about 27 percent of for­ eign exchange earnings; cocoa, 24 percent; cotton, 7 percent; fruits, mainly bananas, for 6 percent; palm products and rubber, 7 percent; and forest products, only 8 percent. Animal husbandry, a major economic activity, provides little for export. The principal food crops in the south are yams , manioc, plantains , and palm oil and, inthenorth, millet, sorghum, manioc, and peanuts. The industrial sector is small but has been expanding steadily. Most industrial enterprises are based on the transformation of locally produced raw materials, but a few assemble imported parts into finished products. The per capita gross national product in 1964-65 was approximately US$101. Social. About 99.6 percent of the population are Africans, who belong to about 80 different tribes; most of the remainder are Europeans. The Fang, Beti, Bassas, and Doualas are the principal ethnic groups in the south, the Bamileke and Bamoun in the west, the Fulani, Hausa, and Kirdi (pagan) peoples in the north, and small groups of Pygmies in the southeast. The two official languages are French and English; there are about 24 major African language groups. Approximately 53 percent of the population are pagan, 18 percent prac­ tice Islam, and 29 percent are Christian. Literacy was estimated at 40 percent in the south and 10 percent in the north in 1965. Almost 97 percent of all stu­ dents in 1963 were in elementary schools. Less than half of the school-age population were in school in 1965. Manpower and Employment Employment and Unemployment. The estimated number of wage and salary earners at the end of 1964 was 86,470, or about 2 percent of the total popula­ tion. Of the 62,032 persons employed in the private sector, 31 percent were in agriculture, 11 percent in forestry, 3 percent in fishing, 21 percent in indus­ try and commerce, 14 percent in transportation and communications, 10 percent in building and construction, and 10 percent in domestic service. A majority of the population are outside the money economy and live at a subsistence level. Although no statistics are available on the extent of unemployment, it reportedly is high, especially among migrants from rural to urban areas and among primary and secondary school graduates. Underemployment is widespread, especially in the traditional, subsistence sector of the economy. Productivity, Skills, and Training. A large majority of the country's manpower are untrained and relatively unproductive. Malnutrition, the lack of adequate health facilities, debilitating diseases, and an inadequate educational system are factors which contribute to low productivity. There is an acute short­ age of professional, administrative, and technical personnel and all categories of skilled and semiskilled workers. Expatriates fill the essential positions in these fields. In 1962, about 5,800 persons were receiving vocational-technical training and about 2,800, teacher training. The Government Trade Center at Ombe in West Cameroon graduates apprentice craftsmen in a number of trades. The College of Arts, Science, and Technology at Kumba provides middle-level agricultural and other technical training. In 1964-65, a center for English language instruction was opened; a new inter-African center for training labor administrators was inaugurated at the School of Administration in Yaounde;a private church organi­ zation from the Netherlands has agreed to construct and equip a technical school at Diang; and project and technical assistance from various sources was concerned with crop pest control, agricultural diversification, schools, public health, commercial and agricultural training, and the provision of scholarships and other training abroad. Cameroon has a university at Yaounde. In 1965, over 100 Peace Corps volunteers, many of whom were working as teachers and in community develop­ ment, were in the country. 2 Labor Standards Labor Legislation. The Labor Codes applied to Cameroon before independ­ ence an d , still in force, provide for maximum hours of work, paid overtime, and paid vacations. The codes also establish minimum wages for all occupations in the six salary zones (geographic regions into which the country is divided) and regulate the employment of women and young persons. Other labor regulations deal with indemnities for occupational diseases and accidents at work, and various plans provide for family allowances and prenatal and maternity benefits for wage and salary earners. Administration and Practice. The Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Legislation is responsible for the administration and enforcement of labor legis­ lation. In 1962, one employment exchange was in operation. Wages, Hours, Prices, and Level of Living Wages and prices have been as much as 30 to 40 percent higher in East Cameroon than in West Cameroon. In 1964, there was an average increase of 10 percent in minimum wages in public works, construction, and industry. Hourly wages of unskilled labor in 1965 ranged from US$0.07 to US$0.13. No other wage data are available. A fringe benefit commonly provided to workers is medical care. The statutory workweek is 40 hours in industry, business, and the pro­ fessions and 48 hours (or 200 hours per month) in farming and forestry, with provisions for overtime. Weekly hours worked, including overtime, in the early part of 1965, were about 48 in industry and 40 to 45 in business. Steadily increasing prices led to the establishment in 1964 of a Federal Office of Price Control. However, despite controls, some consumer prices con­ tinued to rise. The retail price index for European families at Douala was 110.4 in June 1965 (February 1963=100) and 124.1 at Yaounde (March 1961=100). As previously stated, a majority of the population live at the subsistence level. Employer Organizations The first Cameroonian Federal Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Mines was established in 1963. Other organizations are the regional Chambers of Com­ merce and Industry; the Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture, Pasturage, and Forests; the Union des Syndicats Professionels du Cameroun, which coordinates the activities of the approximately 20 associations of merchants and producers; the Association Professionnelle des Banques; and the Confederation des Petites et Moyennes Entreprises. Labor Organizations The total claimed trade union membership in Cameroon in 1965 was more than 88,500. This claim is believed to be inflated since the number of wage and salary earners in 1964 was estimated at about 86,500. The two national centers representing workers in East Cameroon claimed about 68,500 of the total trade union membership. By far the larger of the two is the Federation of Trade Unions of the Cameroon (Federation des Syndicats du Cameroun--FSC), which had an esti­ mated membership of 60,000. 3 The FSC was formed in 1963 by merger of the Confederation of Free Unions of Cameroon (Union des Syndicats Libres du Cameroun--USLC), the General Union of Workers of Cameroon (Union Generale des Travailleurs du Cameroun--UGTC), the Cameroonian General Confederation of Workers (Confederation Generale Camerounaise du Travail--CGCT), the Confederation of Autonomous Cameroonian Unions (Union des Syndicats Autonomes du Cameroun--USAC), and some independent unions. The USLC was an affiliate of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the UGTC was affiliated with the Communist World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). The FSC enjoys the support of the UC, the dominant political party. The other national center in East Cameroon is the Union of Trade Unions of Believing Workers of the Cameroon (Union des Syndicats Croyants du Cameroun-USCC), which claimed about 8,500 members in 1965. The USCC, which was formed in 1962 by the merger of two confessional unions, is affiliated with the Inter­ national Federation of Christian Trade Unions (Confederation Internationale des Syndicats Chretiens--CISC) and its African regional organization, the Pan-African Union of Believing Workers (Union Panafricaine des Travailleurs Croyants--UPTC). It is also affiliated with the African Trade Union Confederation (ATUC). The single national center representing workers in West Cameroon is the West Cameroon Trade Union Congress (WCTUC), which claimed 20,000 members in 1965. The WCTUC, which was formed in 1962, assumed the affiliation with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and its African Regional Organization (AFRO), which two of its affiliates had maintained previously. By far the largest WCTUC affiliate is the Cameroon Development Corporation Workers* Union, which claims 10,000 members. Five International Trade Secretariats (ITS) have affiliates in Cameroon: The International Federation of Commercial, Clerical, and Technical Employees; International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers; Postal, Telegraph, and Telephone International; Public Services International; and Inter­ national Federation of Free Teachers' Unions. Labor-Management Relations The Government establishes minimum wage scales for all occupations in six salary zones and labor legislation regulates hours of work and other conditions of employment. Although employer organizations are well organized and there is a large supply of unemployed, unskilled labor, organized workers engage success­ fully in collective bargaining. Shop stewards, who by law are elected annually for 1-year terms in all private and public establishments, process workers' grievances with employers. Labor tribunals are responsible for resolving con­ flicts between management and labor, and there is the right of appeal to higher courts. Workers have the right to strike. No information is available, how­ ever, on the number of labor disputes. 4 LABOR DIGEST No. 99 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS 1966 This is one of a series of brief notes on labor conditions prepared in the Office of Foreign Labor and Trade of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for inclusion in the Directory o f Labor Organizations—Africa, jointly prepared and published in 1966 by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. LABOR CONDITIONS IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC The Central African Republic is located in the center of Africa. It has an area of approximately 238,000 square miles and a population of 2,088,000, according to the 1965 census. Factors Affecting Labor Political. The country achieved independence on August 13, 1960; a new government, headed by Colonel Jean Bedel Bokassa, assumed power on January 1, 1966. It retained the existing constitution which provides for a single-chamber National Assembly, to which the members are elected for 5-year terms by uni­ versal suffrage (over age 21). Economic. The economy is primarily agricultural. The main cash crops are cotton, coffee, and peanuts and the principal food crops are small grains, peanuts, and cassava. The leading exports are diamonds, cotton, and coffee. Manufacturing includes a small number of plants engaged primarily in processing agricultural products, such as cotton, coffee, and tobacco; others manufacture beverages, textiles, and footwear. Per capita income was estimated to be US$90 in 1963. Social. The principal ethnic groups are the Banda, 318,000; Mandjia, 85,000; and Baya, 294,000. French is the official language and is taught in the schools; Sangho, a vernacular language, is spoken in all parts of the country. Sixty-nine percent of the population are animist, 27 percent are Christian, 3 percent profess Islam, and 1 percent are adherents of lo­ cal religions. The literacy rate has been estimated by the Government at 18 percent. In 1965-66, 129,000 pupils attended primary schools and 4,500 students were in secondary schools. In 1961, the latest year for which data are available, about 42 percent of the children of school age attended school. Manpower and Employment Employment and Unemployment, In 1965, the labor force was estimated at approximately 500,000, or roughly 25 percent of the population. According to these estimates, 90 percent of the labor force, or about 450,000 persons, were engaged in agriculture. There were 285,000 small-scale (about 1 acre) cotton farmers in 1964. The number of wage and salary earners in 1965 was officially estimated to be 49,000, of whom 35 to 40 percent were in the capital area; 38,750 were in the private sector, and 10,300 in the public sector, including 5,000 \"decisionnaires\" (noncareer employees of the lower ranks who are not in the civil service system). Although there is unemployment among those seeking work in the public sec­ tor, there has been an actual shortage of available manual and unskilled workers in urban areas. Underemployment, however, is widespread in rural areas. Productivity, Skills, and Training. Most of the population work on small plots of land, producing for local consumption and using traditional methods; as a result, the level of productivity is low. There is a significant shortage of modern skills. A vocational training center has been established in Bangui. Labor Standards Labor Legislation. The 1961 Labor Code covers general labor conditions. Other legislation establishes minimum wages and fixes the wages and working con­ ditions of domestic workers. A pension program covers all salaried workers; fund contributions are made from compulsory payroll deductions based on a per­ centage of salary received, up to a maximum of US$200 per month. A social secu­ rity program provides for family allowances, prenatal allowances, and lump-sum birth grants for each of the first three births in a family. Administration and Practice. The Ministry of Labor is the main agency in the labor field. It supervises the Central African Social Security Office, which administers family allowances, maternity benefits, and work injury bene­ fits. Enforcement is carried out through a small staff of inspectors. Wages, Hours, Prices, and Level of Living A 40-hour workweek has been established for most nonagricultural workers and a 48-hour workweek for agricultural and related occupations. A 260-hour-permonth work program has been established for domestic servants, and there are exceptions to the preceding general rule for certain categories of unskilled workers. There are 12 legal holidays. The consumer price index for Africans was 110.7 in December 1962 (1960=100) and 116.4 at the end of 1963. Increases in minimum wage rates have been promul­ gated from time to time. Employer Organizations There are two employer organizations in the Central African Republic, the Groupement Interprofessional pour l f6tude et le Ddveloppement de l'Economie 2 Centraf ricaine (GIRCA) and the Union Nationale Interprof essionel le Centraf ricaine (UNICA). The former, located in Bangui, is composed of the more prominent planters, tradesmen, transporters, and businessmen, and has about 60 members. The latter (also located in Bangui) is composed of businessmen operating on a smaller scale and appears to be less well established than the GIRCA. Both organizations were, however, represented at the International Labor Organization conference in Geneva in 1966. There are also Chambers of Commerce, Agricul­ ture, and Industries and Handicraft actively functioning in the Central African Republic. Labor Organizations The General Union of Central African Workers (Union Generale des Travailleurs Centrafricaine--UGTC), the nation's only trade union center, claims a membership of about 39,000, or 80 percent of the nation's estimated full-time wage and salary earners. The UGTC was formed in 1964 as a result of a merger of the African Confederation of Free Trade Unions-Workers Force-Central African Republic (Confederation Africaine des Syndicats Libres-Force Ouvriere-Republique Centrafricaine--CASL-F0-RC), African Confederation of Believing Workers-Central African Republic (Confederation Africaine des Travailleurs CroyantsRepublique Centrafricaine--CATC-RC), African General Confederation of LaborCentral African Republic (Confederation Generale Africaine du Travail--CGAT-RC), Confederation of Workers of the Central African Republic (Confederation des Travailleurs de la Republique Centrafricaine--CTC), and the FECETEC. The CASL-F0-RC was a former affiliate of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU); the CATC was affiliated with the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (IFCTU); and the CGAT was an affiliate of the Communist World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). The UGTC is organized into two co­ ordinating federations, one for unions of public servants and one for unions in the private sector. However, these local affiliates have only limited contact with the national center. The UGTC is affiliated with the All-African Trade Union Federation (AATUF). Labor-Management Relations Bipartite tribunals settle individual grievances, and advisory labor commissions deal with collective disputes. The number of man-days lost as a result of work stoppages was 39,205 in 1957, 7,336 in 1960, and 1,100 in 1961. 3 LABOR DIGEST No. 100 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 1966 BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS This is one of a series of brief notes on labor conditions prepared in the Office of Foreign Labor and Trade of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for inclusion in the Directory o f Labor Organizations—Africa, jointly prepared and published in 1966 by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. LABOR CONDITIONS IN THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD Chad, a landlocked country in north-central Africa, has an area square miles and had a population of about 3.3 million in 1964. of 496,000 Factors Affecting Labor Political. Chad became a republic in August 1960. Under the Constitu­ tion of 1962, executive power is vested in the President who appoints the Council of Ministers. Legislative power is vested in the unicameral National Assembly, which is elected for a 5-year term. The Parti Progressiste Tchadien (PPT) is the only authorized political party. Francois Tombalbaye has been President since 1960. Economic. The economy is based on agriculture; cotton and livestock rais­ ing are the chief pursuits. Cotton accounted in 1964 for 79 percent of exports; livestock, about 20 percent. Other crops of significance are grain (millet, sorghum, and rice) and peanuts. Food processing is the main manufacturing indus­ try. The gross national product per capita in 1964 was estimated to be US$50. Social. The ethnic composition of the population is mainly Arabic stock, largely nomadic or seminomadic, in the north and Bantu in the south. Among the latter, the Sara is the largest and most important tribe. Islam is the religion of approximately half the population; among the remainder are a few Christians, but most are animists. The official language is French, but a form of Arabic is spoken widely. The various tribal groups speak a variety of languages, such as Sara and Massa. Twenty percent of the school-age children attended school in 1963. The country literacy rate was estimated at 5 percent in that same year. Manpower and Employment Employment and Unemployment. Over half of the population lead a nomadic or seminomadic existence. In 1962, out of the total labor force of 1.4 million persons (45 percent of the population), 91 percent were in agriculture, 4 per­ cent were self-employed, and about 65,000 (5 percent) were wage and salary earners. Of the latter group, 31.9 percent were in government and commerce, 23.9 percent in transportation, 9.6 percent in construction, 2.7 percent in in­ dustry, and the remainder in other sectors. An estimated 30 percent of the total number of wage and salary earners were reported to be unemployed in 1962. Unemployment has been attributed to the withdrawal of French troops, migration of the agricultural population to urban centers, seasonal unemployment due to climatic conditions, and other factors. Underemployment is extensive in the agricultural sector. Productivity, Skills, and Training. Primitive techniques and the lack of skilled manpower have kept the level of productivity low in all sectors, particularly in the small industrial sector. A small number of technical schools are in operation, including a vocational school at Fort Lamy. Recently, some enterprises have provided on-the-job training for students during vaca­ tion periods. The Ministry of Labor, Youth, and Sports also operates a voca­ tional training center, which offers a 9-month training program for skilled workers. Labor Standards Labor Legislation. On December 28, 1965, the National Assembly enacted a Labor Code for the first time. The new code is a revision of the 1952 French Labor Code for Overseas Territories, which previously formed the basis for Chadian labor law. Provisions cover fringe benefits, hours of work, rest pe­ riods, minimum wages, holidays, conditions of work, health and sanitation, work injury benefits, and other topics. Administration and Practice. The Minister of Labor, Youth, and Sports supervises and administers labor legislation through labor inspectors and the labor courts. Wages, Hours, Prices, and Level of Living The minimum hourly wage in 1964 for nonagricultural workers, governmen­ tal or private, in principal towns and the north was US$0.09. In other parts of Chad, nonagricultural workers received US$0,082 and agricultural workers, US$0,075. These wages reflect a 46- to 68-percent increase in the minimum wage decreed in 1964--the first increase since 1959. The Labor Code provides for a 40-hour workweek. In Fort Lamy, the capital of the Republic, the retail price index for average European or wealthy Chadian families was 142.3 in 1964 (1958=100), a 5-percent increase over 1963. However, most of the population lives at the sub­ sistence level; in 1964, the average annual per capita income was estimated at US$55. Employer Organizations Employers* organizations include the Chamber of Commerce for Agriculture and Industry and the Intertrade Union of the Chad (Unitchad). 2 Labor Organizations Total trade union membership in Chad is estimated at 6,750, or approxi­ mately 10 percent of the 65,000 wage and salary earners. An estimated 5,500 members belong to the National Union of Chadian Workers (Union Nationale des Travailleurs du Tchad--UNTT), which was formed in March 1964 as a result of a merger of the African Confederation of Free Trade Unions-Workers1 Force--Chad (CASL-FO), the African General Confederation of Labor (CGAT), and the Union of Chadian Workers (UTT). The CASL-FO was a former affiliate of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, while the CGAT was affiliated to the Com­ munist World Federation of Trade Unions. The UNTT, which was formed with the encouragement of the Government, has a close relationship with the single politi­ cal party, the PPT. The only other national trade union center in Chad is the Chadian Con­ federation of Labor (Confederation Tchadienne de Travail--CTT), formerly known as the African Confederation of Believing Workers (CATC). The CTT disaffiliated from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CISC) in 1965. It remains affiliated with the African Trade Union Confederation. Labor-Management Relations A collective dispute is first handled by a labor inspector of the Minis­ try of Labor, Youth, and Sports. If settlement is not reached, the case is referred for conciliation to a labor advisory board. The board may itself act or appoint a special tripartite conciliation board. If conciliation fails, \"nonconciliation\" procedures are carried on by a neutral expert. Finally, the case may be referred to an arbitration board. Strikes and lockouts are prohibited until conciliation and recommenda­ tion proceedings have been exhausted. Strikes against the Government are for­ bidden. Information on the number of strikes which have occurred is unavailable. 3 LABOR DIGEST No. 101 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS 1966 This is one of a series of brief notes on labor conditions prepared in the Office of Foreign Labor and Trade of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for inclusion in the Directory o f Labor Organizations—Africa, jointly prepared and published in 1966 by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs and the Bureau of Labor Statistics* LABOR CONDITIONS IN THE REPUBLIC OF CONGO (BRAZZAVILLE) The Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) is located in west-central Africa, It has an area of 133,500 square miles and had a population estimated at 900,000 in 1964. Factors Affecting Labor Political. The country became independent of France in November 1960. Under the Constitution of 1963, the Government consists of the President, who is elected for a 5-year term, a Prime Minister and a Cabinet appointed by the President, and a 55-member National Assembly, elected for a 5-year term. The President (currently Alphonse Massamba-Debat) has extensive powers, both in his governmental capacity and as secretary general of the single political party, the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR), and as head of its Political Bureau. Economic. In 1963, agriculture, livestock, forestry, and fishing ac­ counted for 23 percent of the gross national product (GNP); manufacturing, elec­ tricity, mining, and construction, 17 percent; transportation, commerce, and other services, 34 percent; and Government services, 26 percent. The GNP per capita in 1963 was estimated at US$150. A majority of the population are engaged in subsistence farming and produce such foodstuffs as bananas, manioc, corn , pea­ nuts, rice, taros, and tropical fruits, almost all of which are for local con­ sumption. Primarily European enterprises grow tropical products , such as peanuts , tobacco, sugarcane, palm nuts, bananas, cocoa beans, and coffee. The most im­ portant economic activity is lumbering, and the leading industry is wood process­ ing. Tropical wood, mainly limba (of which the Congo is the world's largest producer) and okoume, is the most important Congolese export, accounting in 1964 for 44 percent of the total. Next in importance are diamonds (not mined in the Congo but coming from neighboring countries) , which accounted for over 42 percent of total exports in 1964. Tropical agricultural products, such as palm kernels, palm oil, and coffee, contributed 7 percent of the total. The industrial sector is not highly developed. Among the more important industrial enterprises are a sugar refinery, a cigarette factory, 2 fish processing plants, a veneer plant, about 15 sawmills, and 4 or 5 palm oil plants. Europeans living in the Congo own some of the smaller firms, but French companies headquartered in France generally control most of the larger enterprises. The most promising new economic activity in the Congo's future is the development of large and rich potash deposits near the port of Point Noire. Production is scheduled to commence in 1968. The Congo's 5-Year Development Plan (1964-69) emphasizes industrial development. Social. The population is composed of about 15 ethnic groups, comprising over 70 tribes. The Bacongo, the largest of the groups, accounted for almost 50 percent of the population in 1965; the Bat£k£, the next in importance, com­ prise about 20 percent of the total, and the M'Bochi, about 15 percent. The remaining 15 percent are Europeans, of whom a majority are French. About 49 per­ cent of the population are Christians, 50 percent are animists, and the remainder profess Islam. French is the official language and is taught in schools, but numerous African languages, mostly of the Bantu group, are spoken. The rate of literacy is estimated at about 25 percent. Manpower and Employment Employment and Unemployment. The estimated labor force in 1965 was about 40 percent of the population. About 60 percent were engaged in agriculture; 14 percent were self-employed, engaged in commerce and handicrafts; 18 percent were wage and salary earners; and 8 percent were unemployed. The total number of wage and salary earners in 1963 in both the public and private sectors, estimated at 67,500, included about 2,000 European salaried workers; about 5,500 of the remaining 65,500 Congolese, were employed as domestic servants and 15,500 by the Government and other public entities. The only information available on the distribution of wage and salary earners by industry is for 1960 when, out of a total of 48,700, 20 percent were engaged in agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting, 20 percent in public and private services, 16 percent in commerce and finance, 12 percent in manufacturing and electricity, 10 percent in transporta­ tion, 9 percent in construction, 7 percent in domestic service, and the remain­ ing 6 percent in other activities. As a consequence of the migration of unskilled workers to the cities, unemployment is a serious problem in urban areas. Underemployment is substan­ tial, particularly in rural areas. In 1965, the Government created a new move­ ment called the \"Action for Rural Renovation\" and at the same time dissolved the paramilitary Service Civique. The new program is designed to move the unemployed youth out of the cities into useful work in the country. The Ministry of Agri­ culture, the Secretary for Youth and Sports, and the Secretary of State for Na­ tional Defense are responsible for administering various aspects of the program. Productivity, Skills, and Training. Productivity is low, particularly in the nonwage sector. The expanding economy requires skills which are not cur­ rently available, due to the workers' lack of education and training. In 1963, the Congo had 32 vocational and secondary technical schools, 3 teacher-training institutes, and the University of Brazzaville, which had 181 students. Labor Standards Labor Legislation. The Labor Code of 1964 forbids compulsory labor and contains provisions relating to freedom of association, labor organizations, the 2 settlement of industrial disputes, contracts of apprenticeship, individual em­ ployment contracts, collective agreements, wages, paid leave, the health and safety of workers, and the employment of women and children. The Civil Service Code ( 1962) , among other things, regulates the recruitment, conditions of employ­ ment, and rates of pay of civil servants; it also deals with discipline and recognizes the right of civil servants to organize into trade unions. The Old Age and Survivors1 Insurance Law (1963) applies to all workers subject to the Labor Code and provides for retirement benefits, which begin at age 55. Persons who have worked at least 15 years in covered employment are guaranteed a minimum amount; larger pensions are paid, depending on length of service in covered em­ ployment and the amount contributed to the pension fund. Employers contribute 60 percent and workers 40 percent to the fund. The Directorate of Labor and Social Welfare administers labor legisla­ tion. The tripartite National Labor Advisory Board under the authority of the Minister of Labor and Social Welfare evaluates and makes recommendations with regard to problems and programs concerning labor, manpower, and social welfare. Family allowances, workmen's compensation, and the Old Age and Survivors 1 Insur­ ance Law are administered by the National Social Welfare Fund, under the juris­ diction of the Ministry of Labor. Wages, Hours, Prices, and Level of Living Representative hourly wages for adult wage and salary earners in October 1962 in Brazzaville were US$0.20 for bakers, US$0.33 for cabinetmakers, US$0.45 for garage mechanics, and US$0.31 for carpenters. Monthly rates were US$40.60 for retail clerks and US$117.00 for accounting machine operators. In addition to basic wages, some workers receive family allowances and other fringe bene­ fits, such as transportation to and from work. The statutory workweek is40hours. The retail price index for Europeans in Brazzaville (1956=100) was 145.2 in January 1962 and 163.0 in January 1963. A new index (January 1964=100) was 106.7 in December 1964. There is currently no cost-of-living index for Afri­ cans. Government measures to curb inflation have included credit restraints and wage controls. Employer Organizations There are Chambers of Commerce in Brazzaville in Point Noire has a branch in Dolisie. and Point Noire; the one Labor Organizations No information is available on the total trade union membership in the Congo. The single national trade union center, the Congolese Trade Union Con­ federation (Confederation Syndicale Congolais--CSC), was formed in 1964 by the merger of the Congolese Confederation of Free Trade Unions (Confederation Congolaise des Syndicats Libres--CCSL), the National Union of CGAT Trade Unions of the Congo (Union Nationale des Syndicats CGAT du Congo--CGAT-Congo), the Federation of Postal Workers (Federation Postale), and a public service union. The CCSL was an affiliate of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the CGAT-Congo was affiliated with the Communist World Federation qf Trade Unions (WFTU). The merger took place at the urging of the MNR, the 3 single political party. As a result, the CSC has a very close relationship with that party. It is an affiliate of the All-African Trade Union Federation (AATUF). The National Union of CATC Trade Unions of the Congo (Union Nationale des Syndicats CATC du Congo--CATC-Congo), an affiliate of the International Fed­ eration of Christian Trade Unions (Confederation International des Syndicats Chretiens--CISC), refused to participate in the formation of the CSC. Subse­ quently it was dissolved by the Government, and it is believed to have gone underground. Labor-Management Relations The Labor Code provides for referral to the employer, by staff repre­ sentatives, of individual or collective employee demands with respect to such matters as conditions of employment, wage rates, or the application of collec­ tive agreements. The code also provides for conciliation through services of the Inspectorate of Labor and Social Legislation and Labor Courts. 4 LABOR DIGEST No. 102 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS 1966 This is one of a series of brief notes on labor conditions prepared in the Office of Foreign Labor and Trade of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for inclusion in the Directory o f Labor Organizations—Africa, jointly prepared and published in 1966 by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs and the Bureau of Labor S tatistics. LABOR CONDITIONS,IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (KINSHASA) The Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa--f ormerly Leopoldville) is located in south-central Africa. Its area is about 905,000 square miles, and its popu­ lation was estimated to be between 14 and 15 million in 1965. Factors Affecting Labor Political. The country achieved independence from Belgium on June 30, 1960. On November 25, 1965, General Joseph Mobutu took over control of the Gov­ ernment by a bloodless coup d'etat. The Republic now has a parliamentary system of government, abicameral Legislature, aPresident, andaPrime Minister. Presi­ dent Mobutu is now ruling by decree. Economic. A majority of the native population engage in subsistence farming, hunting, and fishing; in 1964, a quarter of the population (34 per­ cent of the adult males) were employed in the modern (i.e., cash) economy, principally plantation agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. Prior to in­ dependence, agriculture contributed about one-third of the gross national prod­ uct (GNP) and 30 percent of exports. The main agricultural products are palm products, rubber, and coffee. Mining, including copper, diamonds, cobalt, zinc, gold, and uranium, contributed 50 to 67 percent of the value of exports and 15 to 20 percent of the GNP before independence. Most industrial activity is in mining and in secondary manufacturing, principally the processing of agri­ cultural products. Social. French is the official language of the Government and the common language in the schools. There are four common, or trade, languages: Lingala, Kikongo, Swahili, and Tshiluba. An estimated 5 million persons are Christians. There is a small Moslem minority; the remainder are animists. In 1960, it was estimated that 30 percent of the population had an elementary knowledge of read­ ing and writing; in some rural areas, about 10 percent were literate. M anpower and Employment Employment and Unemployment. In 1958, approximately 6.7 million people, or one-half of the estimated population at that time (13.5 million), were in the labor force. Only 1.1 million, or about 17 percent, worked in the cash economy; 83 percent worked as subsistence farmers and unpaid family workers in the traditional subsistence economy. In early 1965, it was estimated that approximately 20 percent of the labor force, estimated at over 7 million, were wage and salary earners. In 1959 (the most recent year for which data on the distribution of the labor force are avail­ able) , 279,742, or about 29 percent of the 961,068 wage and salary earners, were employed on plantations; 101,800, or 11 percent, in manufacturing; 87,234, or 9 percent, in construction; 78,732, or 8 percent, in mining; 71,400, or 7 percent, in transportation; 65,590, or 7 percent, in trade; 229,850, or 24 per­ cent, in services; and 46,720, or 5 percent, as office workers. Unemployment is difficult to measure because of the high rate of labor turnover, migration of laborers from rural to urban areas, and the absence of public employment offices. Productivity, Skills, and Training. Productivity is low in the tradi­ tional sector of agriculture. An estimated 20 percent of the labor force have some skills in such occupations as teaching and construction. In 1958, 376 vocational and agricultural schools had a total enrollment of 19,643, and 583 teacher-training schools, an enrollment of 43,906. There are two universities, a normal school, the National School for Law and Administration, and the Na­ tional Institute of Vocational Training, as well as other professional training institutions. Labor Standards Labor Legislation. Labor legislation, dating from before the country achieved independence, remains in effect until revoked or amended. Among the laws passed since independence are the Employment Contracts Law (1961), which covers individual labor contracts, and the Social Security Law (1961). A number of amendments to the Employment Contracts Law cover such subjects as working conditions, contracts, procedures for determining minimum wages, and housing. The Single Statute (1959) regulates employment in the civil service. A decree of 1957 gave African workers and employees the right to join labor organizations. The Ordinance-Law Concerning the Regulation of Labor Relations (1964) serves as a legal basis for the creation of national and regional labor-management rela­ tions advisory bodies; it provides protection for worker delegates against arbi­ trary dismissal, defines legal work stoppages, prohibits politically motivated strikes, and assures the right to work of nonstrikers. The Ordinance Relating to Worker Representation in Enterprises (1964) establishes a system of worker representation within individual enterprises. Administration and Practice. The Ministry of Labor is the main agency responsible for labor matters. Other ministries and semigovernmental bodies, such as the National Institute of Social Security, are charged with specific aspects of labor administration. The inadequate number of inspectors, together 2 with their limited technical knowledge, limits enforcement. The United Nations, the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), and the International La­ bor Organization (ILO) have assisted the Government in training administrators, labor inspectors, and other personnel for the Ministry of Labor and have pro­ vided teaching personnel in these fields. Wages, Hours, Prices, and Level of Living The country is divided into six wage districts. The daily legal minimum wage rate in Kinshasa, as decreed in 1963, was US$2.12 for ordinary labor,U S$2.36 for heavy work, and US$1.92 for light work. The law also requires payment of a housing allowance of US$0.22 and an allowance of US$0.14 for each child per day. The minimum wage rate varies from 40 to 80 percent of these figures in the other wage districts. (On May 1, 1966, the Government announced a 30-percent increase in the national legal minimum wage rate and a 100-percent increase in family allocations.) The workweek officially consists of 8 hours a day, 6 days a week. In practice, increases in minimum wage rates have been tied to increases in the cost of living; at the same time, the Government has acted to curb infla­ tion. The new index for Kinshasa markets (October-December 1964=100) was 110 in December 1965. The cost-of-living index in Katanga (1959=100) was 157.9 in 1964. Employer Organizations The most important management organization is the Federation of Enter­ prises of the Congo. Membership in this organization, as well as in national and regional chambers of commerce, is predominantly foreign. In an effort to encourage a Congolese employer group, the Government, in 1961, approved theformation of the Association of Middle Classes and of Independent African Workers, an association of small employers. In 1961, this organization had 272 members, mostly artisans, retailers, small manufacturers, contractors, and representa­ tives of service industries. Labor Organizations Total trade union membership in the Congo is estimated at about 152,000, or about 11 percent of the estimated 1.4 million wage and salary earners. Of the four national trade union centers in the country , by far the largest and best organized is the Union of Congolese Workers (Union des Travailleurs Congolais--UTC), which has an estimated membership of 92,500, or about 60 per­ cent of the total trade union membership. The UTC was formed in 1960 as a successor to the Confederation of Christian Syndicates of the Congo (Confedera­ tion des Syndicats Chretiens du Congo--CSCC), whose origin dates back to 1946. Since its founding, the UTC has maintained a close connection with the Belgian Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (Confederation des Syndicats Chretiens-CSC). It is an affiliate of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (Confederation Internationale des Syndicats Chretiens--CISC) and its African regional organization, the Pan-African Union of Believing Workers (Union Panafricaine des Travailleurs Croyants--UPTC). 3 The second largest national center is the Confederation of Free Trade Unions of the Congo (Confederation des Syndicats Libres du Congo--CSLC), with an estimated 50,000 members, or about one-third of the total trade union member­ ship. The CSLC was formed in 1961. The General Labor Federation of the Congo (Federation Generale du Travail du Kongo--FGTK), with an estimated 8,000 mem­ bers, is the third major center. Since its formation in 1951, the FGTK has had a close relationship with the Belgian General Federation of Labor (Federation General du Travail de Belgique--FGTB). The FGTK and the CSLC, respectively, affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in 1960 and 1961 and are members of its African Regional Organization (AFRO). The CSLC, FGTK, and UTC all participated in the formation of the African Trade Union Confederation (ATUC). The General Confederation of Congolese Workers (Confederation Gdn^rale des Travailleurs Congolais--CGTC), with an estimated membership of 300, is the smallest of the four centers. It is affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and has a close connection with the Communist General Confedera­ tion of Labor (Confederation Generale du Travail--CGT) in France. In addition to its WFTU affiliation, the CGTC is an affiliate of the All-African Trade Union Federation (AATUF). Seven International Trade Secretariats (ITS) have affiliates in the coun­ try: International Federation of Building and Woodworkers; International Federa­ tion of Commercial, Clerical, and Technical Employees; International Graphical Federation; International Federation of Journalists; Miners' International Fed­ eration; Postal, Telegraph, and Telephone International; and Public Services International. Labor-Management Relations Management is generally not organized to deal effectively on a collective bargaining basis with labor. Except in large enterprises, management handles industrial relations on an ad hoc basis. If conflicting parties in a dispute fail to reach agreement, the Ministry Qf Labor establishes a conciliation board. If its efforts are unsuccessful, voluntary arbitration is the next step. Legis­ lation requires employers and employees to exhaust all conciliation and arbitra­ tion procedures before calling a strike or lockout.

LABOR CONDITIONS IN THE REPUBLIC OF DAHOMEY The Republic of Dahomey is located in West Africa on the northern coast of the Gulf of Guinea. It has an area of 44,700 square miles and had a population estimated at 2.3 million in 1965. Factors Affecting Labor Political. Dahomey achieved independence from France in 1960. Several abrupt changes of government since 1960 reflect the deep-seated rivalries among the three main regions of the country. In the most recent change, the Army sus­ pended the Constitution of 1964 on December 22, 1965, and General Christophe Soglo assumed power. As President of the Republic, he has appointed a Cabinet, comprised mainly of civilians outside political circles, and has dissolved the National Assembly. Economic. The economy consists primarily of subsistence agriculture. The main food crops--corn, yams, millet and sorghum, rice, manioc, beans, and a variety of fruits--account for70percent of the total agricultural product. Palm products, peanuts, and coffee, the major cash crops, contribute over 90 percent of exports. Industry is small scale. An important new palm kernel factory, opened in early 1965, has the capacity to process 80 percent of the country's palm kernel production. About 55 percent of the gross national product in 1964 was estimated to come from agriculture, forestry, livestock, and fishing, 19 per­ cent from commerce, 9.2 percent from transport and communications, 7.6 percent from construction and public works, and 9.2 percent from other sectors. Per capita income was estimated in 1965 at US$65 to US$70. Social. The most important of the 12 major ethnic groups are the Fon (900,000) in the south and center of the country, the Yoruba and Mahi (150,000) in the southeast, andtheBariba (160,000), Somba (80,000), and Peul (70,000) in the north. About 2,000 Europeans are employed in commerce, industry, and administra­ tion. A majority of the population are animist or fetishist. The Christians, a smaller group, are in the south; the Moslems are more predominant in the north. The official language is French; the main native languages are Fon, Yoruba, Bariba, and Fulani. Literacy is estimated at 5 percent of the population over 15 years of age, varying from 20 percent in urban areas to 2 percent in rural areas. Manpower and Employment Employment and Unemployment. The labor force was estimated in 1965 to be 1.1 million (47.8 percent of the total population). Approximately 75 percent are employed in agriculture, fishing, and hunting, 15 percent in commerce, bank­ ing, and insurance, 5 percent in crafts and cottage industries, and 5 percent in other activities. Manufacturing and processing occupied about 4,000 persons in 1965. Of the estimated 26,000 wage and salary earners, about 12,000 were in the public sector and 2,000 in the semipublic sector. Under French colonial rule, relatively well-educated Dahomeans filled a large number of clerical and middle-level positions in countries throughout subSaharan Africa. After countries in that area achieved independence, most of them expelled the Dahomeans, often suddenly, and they had to return home. This influx aggravated the country's difficult economic situation and helps account for the serious urban unemployment problems which now exist. Underemployment characterizes the subsistence sector of the economy. Productivity, Skills, and Training. A high level of productivity and skills is occasionally found in the public sector. In general, however, low educa­ tional levels, the absence of skills in virtually all fields, and primitive pro­ duction methods contribute to low levels of productivity. In 1961, eight schools offered vocational training, three offered teacher training, and there was an apprenticeship training center at Parakou. The Gov­ ernment operates two agricultural training centers. Labor Standards Labor Legislation.* Labor legislation, patterned on the French Overseas Labor Code, provides for collective agreements between employers and employees, the fixing of minimum wages by the Government, paid annual leave, and children's allowances. The social security program provides for work injury benefits, for payment of maternity benefits for employed women, and for family allowances. Civil servants are covered by a pension system. Administration and Practice. The Ministry of Labor and Civil Service ad­ ministers labor legislation and the social security program. Enforcement is ham­ pered by a shortage of inspectors and the large number of very small enterprises. Wages, Hours, Prices, and Level of Living Minimum wage rates vary according to the location of the employment and the sector of the economy. In agriculture, the minimum hourly rate is about 13 percent less than that for other employees. A nonagricultural worker in the urban centers of Cotonou, Porto Novo, and Ouidah is guaranteed a minimum hourly wage of approximately US$0.16, which is the highest minimum wage rate specified. 2 The law establishes a maximum workweek of 40 hours. Time worked in excess of that limit is subject to premium pay. In 1962, the government of President Maga instituted a 10-percent cut in the salary of civil servants. Under pressure from the trade unions, this cut was reduced to 5 percent in 1964 by the Ahomadegbe regime. The salaries of offi­ cials were further reduced by 25 percent in 1965 as part of Ahomadegbe 1s austerity program. The present government of General Soglo has stated that it intends to maintain this program. Employer Organizations The principal employer organizations are the National Association of Dahomean Merchants (SYNCAD) and the African Merchants' Association of Dahomey (SYNACADA). There is also a Chamber of Commerce and the Interprofessional Association of Enterprises of Dahomey (GIDA). Labor Organizations The total trade union membership in Dahomey is roughly 21,000, or about 80 percent of the estimated 26,000 wage and salary earners. About 85 percent of the membership is concentrated in two of the four national centers: The General Union of Workers of Dahomey (Union Gdnerale des Travailleurs du Dahomey--UGTD), with an estimated 10,000 members, and the General Union of Dahomean Trade Unions (Union G£n£rale des Syndicats du Dahomey--UGSD), with an estimated 8,000 mem­ bers. The UGTD, which was formed in 1961, is affiliated with the All-African Trade Union Federation (AATUF). The UGSD was formed in 1964 as a successor to the General Confederation of Trade Unions of Dahomey (Confederation Generale des Syndicats du Dahomey--CGSD). The two smaller centers are the National Confederation of Free Labor Unions (Confederation Nationale des Syndicats Libres--CNSL), which claimed 2,258 mem­ bers in 1965 , and the Dahomean Confederation of Believing Workers (Confederation Dahomeenne des Travailleurs Croyants--CDTC), with an estimated 1,000 members. The CNSL was formed in 1964 as a successor to the African Confederation of Free Trade Unions-Workers' Force--Dahomey (Confederation Africaine des Syndicats Libres-Force Ouvriers--Dahomey--CASL-FO--Dahomey). The CDTC, which was formed inl952 as a local of theFrench Confederation of Christian Workers (Confederation Francaise des Travailleurs Chretiens--CFTC), is affiliated with the Interna­ tional Federation of Christian Trade Unions (Confederation International des Syndicats Chretiens--CISC) and its African regional organization, the Pan-Afri­ can Union of Believing Workers (Union Panafricaine des Travailleurs Croyants-UPTC). Both the CDTC and the CNSL are affiliates of the African Trade Union Confederation (ATUC). Labor-Management Relations Individual grievances are handled by labor inspectors. Usually, griev­ ances concern breaches of labor contracts involving wages, notice of discharge, separation pay, paid vacations, and overtime. Most collective disputes are settled through conciliation procedures. A small number are referred to the courts. 3 LABOR DIGEST No. 104 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS 1966 This is one of a series of brief notes on labor conditions prepared in the Office of Foreign Labor and Trade of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for inclusion in the Directory o f Labor Organizations—Africa, jointly prepared and published in 1966 by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs and the Bureau of Labor S ta tistics. LABOR CONDITIONS IN THE EMPIRE OF ETHIOPIA The Ethiopian Empire, situated in eastern Africa, has an area of approximately 457,000 square miles and had an estimated population of 27 million in early 1966. Factors Affecting Labor Political. Supreme political power in Ethiopia is vested in the Emperor, a hereditary monarch. The present Emperor is Hailie Selassie I. The 1955 Con­ stitution provides for a bicameral Parliament with an appointed upper house (Senate) and an elected lower house (Chamber of Deputies). An appointed Council of Ministers and advisory groups within the Palace assist the Emperor in adminis­ tering national affairs. There are no political parties. Economic. Ethiopia is predominantly an agricultural country; a majority of the population are subsistence farmers or nomadic herdsmen. The small sur­ pluses produced are usually traded in markets within the traditional economy. Most modern agricultural, industrial, and commercial firms have been established since World War II by foreigners; almost all are partly owned by the Emperor or the Government. In 1961, over two-thirds of Ethiopia's gross national product was contributed by the agricultural sector, less than one-tenth by industry, and the remainder by the governmental, commercial, and services sectors. Agri­ cultural products account for almost all exports; coffee is the largest single export, earning from 50 to 60 percent of Ethiopia's foreign exchange. The second 5-year plan (1963-67) provides for economic and social development, with emphasis on transportation, communications, education, and modernization of agriculture. Social. There are 11 main ethnic groups, speaking, in all, 70 languages and over 200 dialects. Politically and culturally, the most important ethnic groups are the Amharas, the Tigraians, and the Galla people. The first two pro­ fess the Coptic Christian faith; the Gallas are predominantly Moslem. Amharic, spoken by 40 to 50 percent of the people, is the official language; Gallinya and Tigrai-Tigrinya are the other most widely spoken languages. English is a second official language and is spoken by most civil servants and higher level employees in commerce and industry. The literacy rate is estimated at less than 10 percent. Manpower and Employment Employment and Unemployment. Estimates in 1965 placed the number in the labor force at 11.4 million, or 53 percent of the estimated total population in that year. Over 96 percent of the labor force were in agriculture, about 2 per­ cent in manufacturing, and 2 percent in commerce and services. Only small numbers of persons in these sectors work in modern enterprises; however, employ­ ment in modern manufacturing plants appears to be growing rapidly. An estimated 100,000 to 125,000 are wage and salary earners. No data on unemployment are available. The chief problem in rural areas is underemployment; in urban cen­ ters, an abundance of unemployed, unskilled labor exists side by side with a scarcity of persons to fill skilled and professional positions. Productivity, Skills, and Training. Prevalence of debilitating diseases, rigorous and frequent religious fasting, the high altitude or excessive heat, and lack of familiarity with modern practices contribute to a generally low level of productivity, which must be overcome by extensive on-the-job training. Too few graduate from the specialized courses at secondary and university levels and vocational and technical training (\"special\") schools to fill the demand. In 1962-63, the country’s 43 special schools had a total enrollment of 5,152. Labor Standards Labor Legislation. Separate labor laws, all of recent origin, govern individual work contracts , hours, overtime, employer liability for work-connected accidents and diseases, pensions, holidays, labor inspection, working condi­ tions, the formation and activities of employers' and workers' organizations, collective bargaining, disputes settlement, and strikes.
