        "text": "Abstract\n\nPIP: Focus in this discussion of Chad is on the following: geography; the people; history; government and political conditions; the economy; foreign relations; and relations between Chad and the US. In 1987 the population was estimate to be 4.5 million with an annual growth rate of 2.5%. Chad is the largest country of former French Equatorial Africa. There are more than 200 ethnic groups in Chad. Ancient Arab manuscripts and modern archeological investigations document that well-developed societies flourished around Lake Chad over 1000 years ago. The French first penetrated Chad in 1891, establishing their authority through military expeditions. In 1959, the territory of French Equatorial Africa was dissolved and 4 states -- Gabon, the Central African Republic, Congo (Brazzaville), and Chad -- became autonomous members of the French Community. In 1960, Chad became an independent nation under its 1st president, Francois Tombalbaye. The Chadian government, announced in October 1982, is organized according to the Fundamental Act proclaimed by the Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North (CCFAN). The act provides for a president and head of state, a Council of Ministers, and a 30-member National Consultative Council. President Habre has sought to bring about national reconciliation by winning the allegiance of Chad's disaffected groups. He has offered any opponents or exiles who want to rejoin the Chadian polity the opportunity to do so without fear of recrimination or punishment. The primary political vehicle for the Habre government, the National Union for Independence and Revolution (UNIR), was established in June 1984, and efforts are underway to enlist members into UNIR and establish committees from the village and block level through regional committees. Most of the population earns their living from subsistence agriculture, fishing, and stock raising, with past Chadian participation in these essentially subsistence activities reaching 96%. Cotton has traditionally been the country's most important export group, accounting for 80% of Chad's export earnings and producing on the average 60% of the government's revenues. Chad, officially nonaligned, has close relations with France, the former colonial power, and the other members of the Western community. Relations between the US and Chad are cordial, and the US contributed during fiscal years 1982-87, through its Agency for International Development, $61.2 million to economic development projects and another $91.6 million in drought emergency food aid."
