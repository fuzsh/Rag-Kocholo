        "text": "Rulers\n\nIndex Tj-Tz\n\nTjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer, Alidius Warmoldus Lambertus (b. March 7, 1888, Groningen, Netherlands - d. Aug. 16, 1978, Wassenaar, Netherlands), queen's commissioner of Groningen (1925-33) and governor-general of the Netherlands East Indies (1936-45); son of Edzard Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer. He was also Dutch minister to Belgium (1933-36) and ambassador to France (1946-48).\n\nTjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer, Edzard (b. Feb. 21, 1859, Maarseveen, Utrecht, Netherlands - d. Jan. 18, 1936, The Hague, Netherlands), queen's commissioner of Groningen (1917-25). He was also mayor of Groningen (1900-17).\n\nTjeenk Willink, Herman (Diederik) (b. Jan. 23, 1942, Amsterdam, Netherlands), Dutch politician. He was chairman of the First Chamber (1991-97).\n\nTjibaou, Jean-Marie (b. Jan. 30, 1936, Hienghène parish, eastern coast of New Caledonia - d. May 4, 1989, Wadrilla, New Caledonia), New Caledonian leader. He was ordained a priest in 1965. In 1970, feeling that the priesthood confined him to a \"mystico-religious ghetto,\" he left and devoted himself primarily to social work. In 1977 he was elected mayor of Hienghène and vice-president of the Union Calédonienne, the main independence party. He was elected vice-premier in the government of New Caledonia in 1982. A moderate, concerned chiefly with economic and social affairs, he emerged on Nov. 18, 1984, in Hienghène, as a deeply determined supporter of \"the active boycott policy adopted by the FLNKS\" (the Front de Libération Nationale Kanake et Socialiste, a militant independence movement of the Kanaks [Melanesians]). A few days later he was confirmed as the political leader of the independence movement. In 1984-85 there were violent confrontations between the Kanaks of the FLNKS and the caldoches, those of European descent. France decided to institute a \"transitional regime\" that would allow the groups concerned to express their views on the future of the country. Four regions were set up, and regional elections were held in September 1985. In October, as expected, Tjibaou, Léopold Jorédié, and Yeiwéné Yeiwéné, all three members of the Union Calédonienne, were elected premiers of the three regions where the independence movement had won the elections. Tjibaou stated that the division of the country into regions would allow the independence faction to \"organize independence at the grassroots.\" Tjibaou and Yeiwéné were assassinated by members of a Kanak splinter group who believed the FLNKS had sold out the idea of independence by signing the 1988 Matignon peace accord.\n\nTjiriange, (Ernest) Ngarikutuke (b.

At age 19, he was imprisoned by the French, but he escaped three years later. Fighting alongside Ho Chi Minh, To Huu, who began writing poetry at the age of 6, publicly proclaimed that \"I am both a revolutionary and a poet. For me, poems are a weapon for the revolution.\" One of his most famous poems, \"Since Then,\" described his awakening to Communism as the moment when the \"sun of truth shone on my heart.\" In postwar Vietnam, he held a number of senior government posts. He joined the Politburo in 1976 and was appointed deputy prime minister in 1980. He was ousted from the government in 1986 for mishandling the economy. His works continued to be taught in schools throughout Vietnam.\n\nTo Lam (b.

As member of the Liberal \"Rat Pack,\" along with Don Boudria, John Nunziata, and Sheila Copps, he was credited with keeping the spark alive in the Liberal Party. He prevented a bill imposing a user pay system in Atlantic Canada that would have hurt inshore fishermen - in 1987 he forced the debate to be postponed for the summer recess and the proposal was never revived. He imposed a series of moratoria on Atlantic groundfisheries - he successfully stood up to two U.S. trawlers off the East Coast and imposed a licencing fee on American vessels going through Canadian waters. In 1994, he announced at the United Nations that Canada would seize foreign fishing vessels outside the 200-mile-limit - in the following confrontation, a Spanish trawler was arrested and later threats to expand the campaign if European Union ships did not stop fishing for turbot led to a settlement with the EU. In 1996 he became premier of Newfoundland; he resigned that position to return to the federal cabinet as industry minister (2000-02).\n\nM.J. Tobin\n\nTobin, Maurice J(oseph) (b. May 22, 1901, Roxbury, Mass. - d. July 19, 1953, Boston, Mass.), U.S. politician. He served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives (1926-28), was mayor of Boston (1938-45), and governor of Massachusetts (1945-47). In 1948 Pres. Harry S. Truman appointed him secretary of labour. In 1949 and early 1950 Tobin led in campaigns to repeal the Taft-Hartley labour law, to raise unemployment benefits, and institute larger retirement benefits for labour. When a clothing union official, alarmed at unemployment, advocated in May 1950 a 35-hour week, Tobin called the idea impractical \"at present.\" Later Tobin was called upon to supervise the supply of labour for U.S. remobilization, and on September 29 he set up an office of defense manpower to develop \"plans, policies, and programs\" for assuring adequate labour supplies to war plants.\n\nTobolin, Ivan (Osipovich) (b. 1885 - d. 1941), chairman of the Communist Party (1918) and chairman of the Central Executive Committee (1918) of the Turkestan S.F.R.\n\nToby, Jean (François) (b.

June 28, 1964, Plougonvelin, Finistère), lieutenant governor of Niger (1942-54) and governor of Ivory Coast (1943) and of the French Settlements in Oceania/French Polynesia (1954-58).\n\nTocornal (Tocornal), Ismael (b. April 5, 1850, Santiago, Chile - d. Oct. 6, 1929, Santiago), interior minister of Chile (1901-02, 1909-10, 1912, 1917, 1921-22); son of Manuel Antonio Tocornal.

July 29, 1805, Verneuil, Eure, France - d. April 16, 1859, Cannes, Alpes-Maritimes, France), foreign minister of France (1849). He is mainly known as a writer and political philosopher. In 1831 he went to the U.S. to study the prison system. After a year he returned home, resigned his post as a judge, and composed De la Démocratie en Amérique (4 vols., 1835-40; Democracy in America), which, though technically a study of American democracy, was composed with an eye to conditions in France and Europe since 1789, arguing that modern society was led to sacrifice liberty to equality but that a properly organized society could hope to retain liberty. He lost his first bid for the Chamber of Deputies in 1837 but was elected in 1839 and sat as an independent until 1848. Contemptuous of socialists, he opposed the demands of the Parisian workers in June 1848, whose uprising was bloodily suppressed. After the revolution he was again elected, was a member of the assembly's constitutional committee and foreign minister for a few months. In 1851 he protested against the coup of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte and was imprisoned at Vincennes. After his release he composed in his enforced retirement the first volume of L'Ancien Régime et la Révolution (1856; The Old Regime and the Revolution) but died before he could complete the work. In it he asserted an essential continuity between the old regime and the revolution in their common effort to centralize French institutions.\n\nTod, David (b. Feb. 21, 1805, near Youngstown, Ohio - d. Nov. 13, 1868, Youngstown), governor of Ohio (1862-64). He was also U.S. minister to Brazil (1847-51).\n\nD.R. Todd\n\nTodd, Damian Roderic, byname Ric Todd (b. Aug. 29, 1959), governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands (2011-13). He was also British ambassador to Slovakia (2001-04) and Poland (2007-11) and high commissioner to Cyprus (2014-16).\n\nTodd, Sir (Reginald Stephen) Garfield (b. July 13, 1908, Invercargill, New Zealand - d. Oct. 13, 2002, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe), prime minister of Southern Rhodesia (1953-58). He came to Southern Rhodesia in 1934 as a missionary for the Church of Christ. A school he established 400 km southwest of the capital Harare produced many of the country's black political leaders, who studied and later taught there. He entered parliament for the governing white supremacist United Party in 1946. His rugged good looks, fluent oratory, and lucid memory smoothed his path to the premiership in 1953. He was also minister of labour (1954-58), native education (1955-57), and labour and social welfare (1958). He deployed white troops to crush striking black mineworkers and faced mounting unrest over unpopular land reforms. He claimed he was forced to resign after hardliners in his party opposed his plans to liberalize voting rights for blacks and to improve education services for the black majority, but colleagues said his autocratic unpredictability triggered his replacement by Sir Edgar Whitehead. Out of office, Todd joined African nationalist leaders in 1960 in a call for British troops to remove Whitehead by force. When Whitehead was himself replaced by Ian Smith, who declared unilateral independence from Britain in 1965, he was restricted to his ranch. He was detained by the Smith regime in 1972-76. Nominated a senator after Zimbabwe's 1980 independence, Todd at first strongly supported Robert Mugabe's policies but later accused him of allowing rampant corruption to destroy the hopes of a rising black generation. He became a bitter critic of President Mugabe and in 2002 was stripped of his passport and vote under new citizenship laws. He was knighted in 1986, with Mugabe's approval, at the behest of the New Zealand government.\n\nH. Todd\n\nTodd, Hugh (Hilton), foreign minister of Guyana (2020- ).\n\nTodd, John Rawling (b. Feb. 15, 1929 - d. July 18, 2002), administrator of the British Indian Ocean Territory (1967-75).\n\nR. Todd\n\nTodd, Ron(ald) (b. March 11, 1927, Walthamstow, East London, England - d. April 30, 2005, Romford, Essex, England), British union leader. His active trade union career began while working for Ford. He eventually became the chief negotiator for the company's huge labour force and from there graduated to become the head of the nation's biggest trade union, the Transport and General Workers' Union. His election to the general secretaryship in 1984 was disfigured by allegations of ballot-rigging; as a result a further election was called the following year. He was always a blunt public speaker who did not encode his speeches. The period of his leadership could be counted as one of the most difficult ones for the trade union movement in the 20th century. In fact since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher effectively shut out the trade unions from her domestic economic policies, most of Todd's negotiations, not always amicable, were with Labour leader Neil Kinnock. Sometimes he was at odds with Kinnock over Labour's plans to reform trade union legislation, but he was equally occasionally at odds with his own trade union colleagues. The ongoing row was generally over Labour's plans for \"selective\" reform of so-called union bashing legislation passed during the Thatcher years, while many trade unionists wanted the entirety of this legislation to be wiped from the statute book. In 1990, he found himself accused of double standards. At the Trades Union Congress he agreed that his union would support the Labour line while at the same time agreeing to back a motion which conflicted with it. It was also around this period that he mounted an attack on the moderates within his union who, he claimed, were trying to oust him from office before his retirement in 1992.\n\nTodd, William Frederic (b. May 2, 1854, St. Stephen, New Brunswick - d. March 16, 1935, St. Stephen), lieutenant governor of New Brunswick (1923-28).\n\nTodde, Alessandra (b. Feb. 6, 1969, Nuoro, Sardegna, Italy), president of Sardegna (2024- ).\n\nTodea, Alexandru (Gheorghe) Cardinal (b. June 5, 1912, Teleac village, Transylvania, Hungary [now in Romania] - d. May 21, 2002, Târgu Mures, Transylvania), archbishop of Fagaras and Alba Iulia, head of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church (1990-94). He studied theology in Rome and was ordained as a priest in 1939. He returned to Romania in 1940. Between 1946 and 1948 he was imprisoned several times. In 1948, as the Communist state took the official position that \"no religious community and none of its officials may have relations with religious communities abroad\" and that \"foreign religious cults may not exercise jurisdiction on Romanian territory,\" he was again arrested. He escaped from prison and remained in hiding for three years, during which he was secretly made a bishop at a meeting of church leaders. He was arrested again in 1951. After a trial in 1952, he was handed a life sentence to forced labour. He was released 12 years later, when Communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej amnestied all political prisoners. He then continued to fight for religious freedom, writing over 30 petitions to Communist authorities. At a secret meeting in 1986, the church's bishops elected Todea leader of the church, giving him the rank of metropolitan. After the collapse of the regime in 1989, the church was recognized by the state. In 1990, Pope John Paul II recognized Todea as leader of the Romanian Eastern Rite church. A year later the Vatican gave him the rank of cardinal. He retired from the executive leadership of the church in 1994 after suffering a paralyzing stroke.\n\nTodhunter, Sir Charles George (b. Feb. 16, 1869 - d. March 1, 1949), acting governor of Madras (1924); knighted 1921.\n\nTodorov, Nikolay (Todorov) (b. June 21, 1921, Varna, Bulgaria - d.

His party career took off after the Communists seized power in 1944. He was minister of agriculture (1952-57), chairman of the State Planning Commission (1959-62), and a deputy premier (1959-66) and became a member of the policy-setting Communist Party Politburo in 1961. He served as prime minister under Bulgaria's Communist strongman, Todor Zhivkov. In 1981-90 he was parliament chairman. As pressure mounted throughout Eastern Europe for change, Todorov was among a group of reform-minded top-level Communists who toppled Zhivkov in a Politburo coup in November 1989, opening the way for multiparty elections in 1990. Although he won a parliament seat, Todorov resigned later that year, citing health reasons, and withdrew from politics.\n\nTodorovic, Dragan (b.

He joined a revolutionary group of the Socialist Party, formed by Antonio Gramsci, and launched with him the weekly L'Ordine nuovo (\"New Order\") in 1919. The paper became the rallying point for the left wing that broke away from the Socialist Party in 1921 and formed the Communist Party. In 1924 he became a member of the party's Central Committee. When, in 1926, almost all the leaders of the party, banned by Benito Mussolini, were arrested, Togliatti, who had attended a plenum of the Comintern executive, remained in Moscow and became secretary-general of the party in exile. He organized clandestine party congresses at Lyon (1926) and Cologne (1931) and became a member of the Comintern secretariat (1935), using the name Ercoli. During World War II he broadcast from the U.S.S.R. to Italy, encouraging the resistance movement. He returned to Italy in March 1944 and joined the government of Pietro Badoglio in April as minister without portfolio. He later served as vice premier (1944-45) and justice minister (1945-46). When in May 1947 Alcide De Gasperi expelled the Communists from the government, Togliatti launched a series of general strikes in northern Italy. A revolutionary situation arose when he was gravely wounded by a young Fascist on July 14, 1948; workers rose on strike all over Italy and resisted troops in street fighting. Advocating an \"Italian road to socialism,\" he did not aim at the overthrow of the parliamentary system and rejected interference by any centralized international organization in the policy of national parties. He made the Italian Communist Party the most powerful in western Europe. In 1964 the Soviet Union renamed the city of Stavropol, in Kuybyshev (now Samara) oblast, in his honour (as Tolyatti).\n\nTogo\n\nTogo, Shigenori (b. December 1882, Kagoshima prefecture, Kyushu, Japan - d. July 23, 1950, Sugamo prison, Tokyo, Japan), Japanese politician.

Later he went to Washington, D.C., as first secretary of the embassy, and to Berlin as embassy councillor. He was named ambassador in 1937, serving in Berlin for a year, and then in Moscow until September 1940. On Oct. 18, 1941, he was named foreign minister in the government of Premier Hideki Tojo, and was in that post at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack.

Aug. 22, 1924, Omangundu, South West Africa [now Namibia] - d. June 9, 2017), Namibian political leader. In early 1950 he helped to form an organization to assist Ovambo contract workers in South Africa. In 1959 he helped to form the Ovambo People's Organization, the precursor to the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). When he tried to smuggle a tape to the UN Trusteeship Council listing the grievances of Ovambo workers, he was arrested and placed under restriction in Ovamboland. In 1966 the authorities discovered a training camp for SWAPO guerrillas at Ongulumbashe in Ovamboland. Toivo and his associates were arrested and put on trial for treason two years later. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was released in March 1984 after 16 years, nearly all of which were spent on Robben Island, where South Africa confined many of its political prisoners. Despite his long incarceration he tried to resist being released until all the other Namibian political prisoners were freed with him; he was literally compelled to leave his prison cell. He at once announced his determination to resume his struggle for Namibian independence, but though he was the veteran leader of SWAPO, he insisted that its younger president, Sam Nujoma, should continue as leader. Instead, Toivo was elected secretary-general. It was hoped that under his moderating influence SWAPO would be drawn into the South African-supported Multi-Party Conference, but Toivo quickly dispelled that illusion. Only in 1989 did he return from exile and became actively involved in preparing Namibia for independence, which was achieved in 1990. He was appointed a member of the Namibian Legislative Assembly and became minister of mines and energy (1990-99), labour (1999-2002), and prisons (2002-04).\n\nTojo\n\nTojo, Hideki, until 1941 called Eiki Tojo (b.

He graduated from the Imperial Military Academy in 1905 and from the Military Staff College in 1915. He served as a military attaché in Switzerland and Germany in 1919-22.

Following Japan's surrender, his arrest was ordered; he was saved when he shot himself in a suicide attempt (Sept. 11, 1945), but was indicted as a war criminal (April 29, 1946) and subsequently tried before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, found guilty (Nov. 12, 1948), and hanged.\n\nToka, Salchak (Kalbakkhorekovich) (b.

Tolbert was also Liberia's leading Baptist and the president (1965-70) of the Baptist World Alliance. When Tolbert came to power in 1971 he attempted to stamp out the corruption and inefficiency that had grown under Tubman, and to reinvigorate the economy.

March 28, 1946, Cabana, Áncash department [now region], Peru), president of Peru (2001-06). A former shoeshine boy, he benefited from scholarships and won a doctorate in economics from Stanford University (1976), then established himself as an economist working for major international organizations. In 1995 he first ran for president, finishing fourth. In 2000, incumbent Alberto Fujimori's smear tactics ultimately helped Toledo, who led the centrist Perú Posible party. Toledo dropped out of the runoff in protest and launched a series of popular demonstrations against Fujimori's claimed victory. After Fujimori resigned in November, Toledo led the pack of new candidates for the April 2001 elections and won 36.5% of the vote in the first round. His opponent, former president Alan García, exploited media allegations against Toledo of infidelity, immoral behaviour, and cocaine use. Toledo also fell out with campaign chief Álvaro Vargas Llosa (son of Mario Vargas Llosa, the novelist who lost the 1990 presidential race to Fujimori), who began to advocate blank ballots to protest the candidacies of both Toledo and García. On the other hand, Toledo was aided by his wife, Belgian-born American anthropologist Eliane Karp, who gave campaign speeches in Quechua (which Toledo himself did not speak). He won the June runoff with 53.1% of the ballots. Fewer than 3% of votes were blank. Toledo, called \"El Cholo\" (\"the Indian\"), became Peru's first democratically elected president of Quechua ethnicity. Held back by scandals and by his own dissolute handling of power, he never really connected to his people and walked a high wire as heads of state in neighbouring countries were brought down by popular resistance. Poverty and discontent persisted, although the economy grew about 5% a year. He ran for the presidency again in 2011, coming only fourth with 15.6% of the vote, and in 2016, faring even worse (1.3%). Facing corruption charges, he was arrested in the U.S. in 2019 on a Peruvian extradition request; he was extradited in 2023.\n\nToledo, Aníbal Benício de (b.

He held the Senate presidency from 1965 to 1966. A renowned authority on the constitution and a respected lawmaker, he authored or sponsored some 2,000 bills. A stalwart in the Nacionalista Party, Tolentino was a strong contender for the party's nomination as standard-bearer in the 1965 presidential election, but his presidential hopes faded when a disgruntled Ferdinand Marcos bolted the Liberal Party and joined the Nationalists. As foreign minister under President Marcos, he led the Philippine delegation to the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, where he pressed for the adoption of the archipelagic doctrine, which benefited the Philippines and other country archipelagoes. He was Marcos' running mate in the 1986 snap elections. Marcos and Tolentino were proclaimed the winners, and Tolentino took his oath on Feb. 16, 1986. Nine days later, Marcos was forced to flee to Hawaii by the \"people power\" revolt. In July 1986 Tolentino was proclaimed acting president by hundreds of Marcos loyalists, including soldiers, who had barricaded themselves at the Manila Hotel to install a rebel government. When the massive popular support the rebels were expecting failed to materialize, Tolentino agreed to disperse his followers. In 1992, he was reelected senator and served his term until 1995.\n\nJ.

He became a trade union organizer and helped found the Parti Progressiste Tchadien (PPT) in 1947. In 1952 he was elected to the territorial assembly, although the PPT was defeated. The PPT became the strongest party in the 1957 elections, however, and Chad was granted self-government in 1958. When PPT leader Gabriel Lisette was unable to form a coalition government, Tombalbaye replaced him as party leader. He became prime minister in 1959 and, on Chad's independence in 1960, head of state. He sponsored a new constitution and was elected president in 1962. All opposition parties were abolished. His regime was faced with numerous coup attempts and rebellions. Violence erupted in 1965 between the Sudanic Muslims of northern Chad and the Bantus of the south. The Chad National Liberation Front (FROLINAT) was founded in June 1966 to unite Muslim opposition to Tombalbaye's government. He received financial and military aid from France to fight a guerrilla war against the Muslim rebels. Despite an agreement with the rebels in 1971, fighting continued. He also faced opposition from elements of the military. Gen. Félix Malloum, the commander of the armed forces, was arrested on charges of conspiring against the government in 1973. As part of a policy of Africanization to expunge French influence, he changed his first name from François to N'Garta and that of the capital from Fort-Lamy to N'Djamena in 1973. Gen. Noël Odingar led a military revolt against the government in 1975, and Tombalbaye was killed when machine-gun and mortar fire was directed at his official residence in the capital.\n\nTombalbaye, Salomon Ngarbaye (b.

He was above U.S. suspicion of involvement in the drug business, and the U.S. reestablished diplomatic relations with Bolivia in early November 1981. Torrelio's actions in promising an increased role for foreign firms in the mining, metallurgical, and petroleum sectors, freedom from fears of nationalization, and acceptance of an International Monetary Fund presence in running the economy marked him as someone who rejected the nationalistic economic model in place in Bolivia since 1952.

Torrijos\n\nTorrijos (Espino), Martín (Erasto) (b. July 18, 1963, Panama City, Panama), president of Panama (2004-09). The son of former military strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera, he was sent by his father at the age of 15 to fight in Nicaragua's civil war. The younger Torrijos belonged to a Panamanian brigade fighting alongside the Sandinista rebel group. In 1992, he joined the campaign staff of Panamanian presidential candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares. He was made vice-minister of government and justice after the Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) won the election. He was chosen by the PRD as the candidate to replace Pérez Balladares in 1999. A shy public speaker with his father's good looks, Torrijos ran on an ambiguous \"populist-lite\" platform, which consisted of unspecified plans to ease economic reforms made by Pérez Balladares, while still maintaining a pro-business atmosphere in Panama. Critics say the PRD platform lacked substance, but many said a Torrijos victory could be a positive step in Panama's economic and social development. Once the far-and-away favourite to win the election, Torrijos watched his support slide, and finally lost to opposition candidate Mireya Moscoso. In 2004, however, his lead in the opinion polls held through the election. Economic growth averaged 8.6% in 2004-08 and in October 2006 Panamanian voters overwhelmingly supported in a national referendum his plan to expand the Panama Canal, one of the largest investment projects in Latin America; crime, however, went up. He was an unsuccessful candidate again in 2024, running for the Popular Party after having resigned from the PRD.\n\nO. Torrijos\n\nTorrijos Herrera, Omar (Efraín) (b. Feb. 13, 1929, Santiago de Veraguas, Panama - d. July 31, 1981, near Penonomé, western Panama), de facto ruler of Panama (1968-81). In 1952 he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the National Guard (the country's only military force), becoming lieutenant colonel in 1966 and colonel in 1968. He was named military aide to Pres. Arnulfo Arias in October 1968. Less than two weeks later Torrijos and Col. Boris Martínez led a coup that toppled Arias. The next year, he effectively took sole power by exiling Martínez and taking the title of brigadier general. A newly elected assembly in 1972 gave him full civil and military powers for a six-year term as Chief of Government and Supreme Leader of the Panamanian Revolution. He won agreement with U.S. president Jimmy Carter for the pact (signed Sept. 7, 1977) that would transfer sovereignty of the Panama Canal to Panama by the end of 1999. In 1978, he relinquished the post of chief of government, though he retained command of the National Guard. Torrijos, who once described himself as a \"dictator with a heart,\" represented no clear ideology. He visited Fidel Castro in Cuba and backed the Sandinista National Liberation Front's effort to overthrow Pres. Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua. On the other hand, he suppressed leftist labour agitators and students in Panama and allowed the deposed shah of Iran to reside on the Panamanian island of Contadora in December 1979. He was also responsible, together with the Vatican, for persuading the Argentine government to release former president Isabel Perón from house arrest and permit her exile to Spain. He died in an airplane crash in a jungle area while making a military inspection tour.\n\nTorshin, Aleksandr (Porfiryevich) (b.

Feb. 26, 1956, Ostrava, Czechoslovakia [now in Czech Republic]), governor of Moravskoslezský kraj (2000-08). He was also chairman of the Association of Czech Regions, established in 2001 to help solve common problems of regions and to serve as their platform for communication with central government offices.\n\nToshev, Andrey (Slavov) (b. April 4, 1867, Eski Zagra, Ottoman Empire [now Stara Zagora, Bulgaria] - d. Jan. 10, 1944, Sofia, Bulgaria), prime minister of Bulgaria (1935).

Sept. 28, 1950, Náchod, Czechoslovakia [now in Czech Republic]), prime minister of the Czech Republic (1997-98). In December 1989 he became chief of the Czechoslovak (from 1993, Czech) central bank. He often clashed over monetary policy with Premier Václav Klaus, an economist who was credited early on as the architect of the post-Communist transformation, but who saw his political fortunes collapse late in 1997. An inflation hawk who earned the 1995 \"Banker of the Year\" honour at the International Bankers' Forum, Tosovský reluctantly accepted Pres. Václav Havel's plea in December 1997 to guide the country to early polls in June 1998. He was picked by Havel as a compromise choice after Klaus's three-party centre-right administration fell apart over a funding scandal within Klaus's Civic Democratic Party. Tosovský insisted that his stint as premier should be short-term and come with assurances that his role in the central bank would be waiting for him.
