The Tribute book was so beautiful. That was my dad. He died in 2017 from cancer. From time to time I would look at his obituary and then one day I realized that all those sweet notes from other people might disappear. I decided to order the book at that moment. I can't wait to show it to my brother next month when I see him. Sadly, I might be ordering another one in the future. We also lost our little sister in December 2021 to cancer. Anyway, it makes me smile to look through it. I love it. Thank you."

I love the book…. And it’s such a beautiful way to keep all the important pictures, obituary and guests comments and pictures together in a safe, solid format readily available for display. By displaying the book, I feel like I’m keeping my sister nearby."

Thank you so much for making these wonderful memorable books for me. They are truly beautiful (more than I anticipated) and have brought back a lot of memories I had almost forgotten during that depressing time. I have them in my den so I can look at them often."
