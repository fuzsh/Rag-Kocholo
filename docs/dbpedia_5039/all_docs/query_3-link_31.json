        "text": "What Is a Debt Collection Agency?\n\nA debt collection agency is a company that attempts to collect delinquent debts from individuals or businesses, either on behalf of the original creditor or on its own. Debt collectors are subject to federal and state laws on what they are allowed to do and not do.\n\nHow Debt Collection Agencies Work\n\nDebt collection agencies can be hired by creditors to collect debts they are owed but have been unable to collect through their own efforts.\n\nThose debts can include credit card accounts, medical bills, various types of loans, and even unpaid utility bills. If the collection agency is successful, the creditor typically pays a percentage, often 25% to 50%, of the amount the agency recovered.\n\nFor difficult-to-collect debts, some collection agencies will negotiate settlements with borrowers for less than the amount owed. Debt collectors may also refer cases to lawyers who file lawsuits against debtors who have refused to pay.\n\nSome debt collection agencies work on their own behalf. They buy delinquent debt from the original creditor—usually for pennies on the dollar—and then attempt to recover as much of it as possible. Whatever they recoup is theirs to keep.\n\nWhat Do Debt Collectors Do?\n\nWhether they're working for another creditor or for themselves, debt collectors work in similar ways. They will attempt to contact delinquent borrowers through phone calls and letters and try to persuade them to pay what they owe. They can also conduct searches for a debtor's assets, such as bank and brokerage accounts, to determine their ability to repay.\n\nA debt collector has to rely on the debtor to pay and cannot seize a paycheck or reach into a bank account, even if the routing and account numbers are known—unless the debt collector has obtained a court judgment ordering the debtor to pay.\n\nTo accomplish that, the debt collector must sue the debtor before the statute of limitations runs out and win a judgment against them. (Different states have different statues of limitations on how old a debt can be before it becomes \"time-barred,\" freeing the debtor from responsibility to repay it.) A court judgment allows a collector to begin the process of garnishing wages and bank accounts, although the collector must still work through the debtor's employer or bank to obtain the money.\n\nDebt collectors may also contact delinquent borrowers who already have judgments against them. Even when a creditor wins a judgment, it can be challenging to collect the money. Along with placing levies on bank accounts or motor vehicles, debt collectors can try placing property liens or forcing the sale of an asset.\n\nLegal Restraints on Debt Collectors\n\nDebt collectors have a longstanding reputation for harassing consumers. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has said it receives more complaints about debt collection than any other single industry.\n\nThe federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act lays out rules for what debt collectors are and aren't allowed to do in their interactions with debtors and other parties. For example, debt collectors generally aren't allowed to call before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. They cannot harass the debtor with excessive phone calls or other communications, use obscene language, or make physical threats.\n\nDebt collectors are also required to provide certain information about the alleged debt—including the name of the original creditor, any account number, and the amount—and give the debtor an opportunity to dispute the information if they believe it to be in error.\n\nReputable debt collectors will follow these rules. But anyone who encounters a debt collector who doesn't can file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or their state attorney general's office. In addition, consumers have a legal right to sue for damages. As the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau explains, \"If you prove a violation occurred, you may be awarded $1,000 in damages, plus additional compensation for any actual harm they caused. If you win, the collector may also be responsible for paying your lawyer fees and costs.\"\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDebt collectors and collection agencies serve a legitimate purpose by helping creditors recover at least a portion of money they are owed. Debt collection practices are governed by both federal and state consumer protection laws, and legitimate debt collectors will abide by them."
