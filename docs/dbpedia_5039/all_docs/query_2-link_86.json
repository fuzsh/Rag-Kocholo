        "text": "What are work zone speed enforcement units?\n\nNYSDOT and NYSTA will employ automated speed enforcement units that detect unlawful speeding in a work zone at specified construction and maintenance work sites during specified hours of operation. Designed to comply with state and local laws, the technology also includes all hardware, software, and services required to compile the evidence package to submit to the courts.\n\nWhat is the goal of the Automated Work Zone Speed Enforcement Program?\n\nThe goal of the program is to reduce speeds, improve driver behavior, save worker and traveler lives in work zones, complement existing work zone enforcement by the New York State Police, and promote work zone safety.\n\nWhere are the enforcement zones?\n\nIn accordance with the state statute (1180-E(a)), enforcement may occur in any work zones located on a controlled access highway—or any roadway within the state designated for high-speed vehicular traffic.\n\nHow many locations will go live?\n\nThere will be 30 work zone speed units launching in April 2023 that will be moved around to work zones throughout the state.\n\nWill there be a warning period for each work zone speed enforcement unit deployed or each construction season?\n\nNo, the warning period for the entirety of the program began on April 17, 2023 and ended on May 16, 2023. There will be no additional warning periods moving forward.\n\nHow long does it take to receive a Notice of Liability in the mail?\n\nFor the vehicles registered in New York State, a Notice of Liability will be sent to the registered owner of the vehicle within 14 business days from the incident. For vehicles registered in a state other than New York State, Notices of Liability will be mailed within 45 business days from the incident.\n\nHow will I know I am in a work zone? Will signs be present?\n\nAppropriate and visible signage will be present at each work zone speed enforcement location.\n\nWill workers be present and/or signs posted indicating the speed was photo-enforced?\n\nYes, Vehicle and Traffic Law 1180-e requires workers to be present and a sign(s) to be posted that the photo speed violation monitoring system is being used. To meet this requirement, the Speed Enforcement Contractor has Standard Operating Procedures they must adhere to. Part of those procedures are to confirm the presence of workers on site and to deploy the “Work Zone Photo Enforced” signs.\n\nWhere are the enforcement units located and how are the sites selected?\n\nTo maximize the program's flexibility and impact, the enforcement units used in work zones are deployed in sport-utility vehicles referred to as “mobile units.” A mobile unit can be located within the limits of any work zone on interstates, parkways, and other controlled access highways. NYSDOT and NYSTA use a variety of factors to determine mobile unit deployment locations, including roadway and work zone characteristics, such as facility type, speed limit, temporary traffic control activities and whether traditional in-person enforcement is viable.\n\nWho reviews the Notice of Liability?\n\nAll violations will be reviewed and certified by NYS Certified Technicians from NYSDOT and NYSTA before a Notice of Liability will be issued.\n\nWhat is the fine amount for a work zone speed safety violation?\n\nThe first-time violation amount is $50. The second violation within an 18-month period will be $75. Three or more violations within an 18-month period will be $100. These violations are base penalties subject to additional late fees.\n\nHow do I pay a Notice of Liability?\n\nViolators will be able to log in to the violation processing website and enter their citation and PIN number to access their notice, view the images and video, and determine their options for payment. Additional options for fine payment include:\n\nPAY ONLINE: Payment can be made by credit or debit card at nysworkzone.photonotice.com using the notice number, license plate number and PIN provided. There is a convenience fee of $3.75 for credit and debit card payments.\n\nPAY BY PHONE: Call (toll free) 1-833-268-8120. You will need to provide the notice number, license plate number, and PIN provided. There is a convenience fee of $3.75 for credit and debit card payments by phone.\n\nPAY BY MAIL: Make your check or money order payable to the NYS Work Zone Speed Enforcement Program. Be sure to include the notice number, license plate number, and the state of registration on the face of your payment.\n\nWhat is the official address for me to mail my response/payment to?\n\nThe address to mail your response to is:\n\nNYS Work Zone Speed Enforcement Program\n\nPO Box 8418\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19101\n\nWhat is the process to dispute the Notice of Liability?\n\nTo dispute the Notice of Liability, there is a “Dispute Coupon” attached to the Notice which must be completed and mailed or the “Dispute the Notice of Liability” on the website must be completed. Proper documentation must be submitted to support the dispute option selected from the three choices. If the dispute is not related to one of the three choices, the coupon may be mailed with an explanation of the dispute or if disputing via the website such dispute explanation is noted on the electronic form.\n\nThe dispute will be reviewed and the Notice will either be dismissed provided acceptable documentation has been submitted, or denied with an option to pay the Notice or alternatively be referred to the appropriate court for a hearing.\n\nThe speed limit of the highway is posted, but there was not a specific speed limit for the work zone posted. What is the work zone speed?\n\nIf no specific work zone speed limit is posted, the speed limit is the same speed limit as the posted highway speed.\n\nWill points be assessed against my driver’s license?\n\nPoints will not be assessed against your driver’s license for any Automated Work Zone Speed Enforcement Violations. These penalties are civil in nature, with no criminal implications.\n\nWill this violation be sent to my insurance company?\n\nNo, Automated Work Zone Speed Enforcement violations will not be sent to insurance companies.\n\nWhat if I wasn’t driving my car at the time of the violation? Am I still responsible for paying the fine?\n\nThe registered owner of the vehicle referenced receives a Notice of Liability in the mail and is responsible for the imposed fine.\n\nHow is revenue from the fines used?\n\nFines collected as part of the program will cover expenditures related to the program. If all expenditures related to the program are covered, any excess revenue will be used for work zone safety initiatives.\n\nHow often are the speed enforcement systems checked for accuracy?\n\nThe Automated Work Zone Speed Enforcement systems are required, by law, to be recalibrated and recertified on an annual basis. The calibration and certification are valid for 365 days from the certification date. The system runs daily self-tests to ensure all aspects of the system are operating properly at the start and end of each enforcement period."
