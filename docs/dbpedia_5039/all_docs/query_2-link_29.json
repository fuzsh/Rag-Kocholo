        "text": "The Digital Photography of Foods Method: Measurement of food intake in cafeteria settings\n\nDescription of the Digital Photography of Foods Method\n\nThe Digital Photography of Foods Method allows researchers and clinicians to quickly and unobtrusively estimate food intake in cafeteria settings (Williamson et al., 2004, Williamson et al., 2003, Williamson et al., 2002). When using this method, digital video cameras in the dining location are used to capture images of peoples’ food selection, as well as any food that remains after the meal (leftovers). Images of precisely weighed standard portions of the foods served are also collected, and these food images are linked to the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 3.0 (2008), or a custom recipe, which allows energy and nutrient intake to be calculated. At a later date in the laboratory, trained raters use a custom-built computer program called the Food Photography Application© to simultaneously display images of the person’s food selection, leftovers, and the standard portion for each food consumed. The rater estimates the percent of the standard portion that the person selected, as well as the percent of the standard portion that remains on the plate (leftovers). The Food Photography Application© then automatically calculates the energy and nutrient content of food selection and leftovers (food intake is calculated as the difference between selection and leftovers). The Food Photography Application© calculates energy and nutrient content from reference values in the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 3.0 (2008), the manufacturer’s nutrient information, or a custom recipe (the Food Photography Application© utilizes updated nutrient databases as they are released). includes images of a participant’s food selection (Image A), leftovers (Image B), and the standard portion image (Image C). Data collection is unobtrusive and data analysis is efficient, allowing for the collection and analysis of large volumes of data.\n\nValidity of the Digital Photography of Foods Method\n\nThe Digital Photography of Foods Method has been used in a number of settings and its reliability and validity (accuracy) has been established in adults (Williamson et al., 2004, Williamson et al., 2003, Williamson et al., 2002) and children (Martin et al., 2007, Nicklas et al., in press). Portion size estimates for food intake correlate highly with weighed portion sizes (r = 0.92, p < 0.0001) (Williamson et al., 2003) and the mean difference between directly weighed total food intake and digital imaging estimates is 5.2 ± 0.95 g (mean ± SEM), with no systematic bias over levels of food intake (Williamson et al., 2003). Among categories of foods, the mean error from digital imaging varies; for example, digital imaging overestimates beverage intake by 7.6 ± 3.07 g (mean ± SEM) or 4.3%, though digital imaging overestimates condiment intake by 4.9 ± 1.63 g (mean ± SEM) or 16.6% (Williamson et al., 2003). Agreement is consistently high among the raters who evaluate the images. The intra-class correlation coefficient for energy intake was 0.92 (95% confidence intervals or CI: 0.79, 0.97, p < .0001) in Martin et al. (2009a) and 0.93 in Martin et al. (2007), indicating that multiple raters can use the method to estimate food intake and that estimates do not vary meaningfully between and among raters who evaluate images. This is important when the method is used to estimate the food intake of large study samples when multiple raters are necessary. In previous studies, raters included Registered Dietitians, research associates with college degrees, and student workers who were attending college. Hence, it appears that individuals with at least some college experience can be trained to accurately estimate food intake using the method.\n\nThe Digital Photography of Foods Method has proven effective at estimating the food intake of large numbers of people sampled from a variety of geographical areas. For example, the method has been used to estimate the food intake of: 1) Soldiers (N =139) during basic combat training (Williamson et al., 2002), 2) elementary school children (N = 670) in a 2-year study (Williamson et al., 2007), and 3) children (N = 2060) from more than 30 schools across the state of Louisiana in a 3-year study (Williamson et al., 2008). In the Williamson et al. 2007 2008 studies, food intake was estimated at lunch for 3 days on 3 separate occasions. The semi-automated Food Photography Application© streamlined data management and analysis, making the analysis of large numbers of food images efficient and feasible. Additionally, the method provides rich data on food selection, leftovers, and food intake. The utility of these data has been demonstrated in a study that examined the effects of second servings on food intake (Martin et al., 2007) and another study comparing children’s food selection and food intake to national dietary guidelines (Martin et al., 2010, Nicklas et al., submitted for publication-a, Nicklas et al., submitted for publication-b).\n\nThe Digital Photography of Foods Method has also been adapted and used to estimate the food intake of preschool-age children enrolled in Head Start using digital cameras. Specifically, the method was used to collect food intake data at lunch for preschool children (N = 796) on 3 separate occasions across 16 Head Start centers (Nicklas et al., submitted for publication-a). Similar procedures were used by study personnel in the homes of 231 preschool children to capture food intake data during dinner meals on two separate occasions (Nicklas et al., submitted for publication-b). In these settings, the method was found to be valid through comparison of the estimated gram weights of foods from the method to directly weighed foods (Nicklas et al., in press). The average correlation between estimated weights and actual weights was 0.96 (p < 0.0001). The average mean difference in weight between the estimated and actual amounts was 10.6 grams (mean ± SD for weighed food = 255.4 ± 29.9 g vs. 244.8 ± 28.9 g for estimates from digital images) and the difference in energy was 25 kilocalories. Dependent t-tests indicated that the estimated weights using digital images did not differ significantly from the actual weight and Bland and Altman (Bland and Altman, 1986) analysis indicted that no systematic or magnitude bias was present. The estimated mean weight of all foods was 5% less the actual mean weight. Across food categories, mean error ranged from −9.7% for entrees (mean ± SD for weighed food = 80.6 ± 19.6 g vs. 72.8 ± 16.8 g for estimates from digital images) to 6.2% for vegetables (mean ± SD for weighed food = 48.2 ± 17.3 g vs. 51.2 ± 21.2 g for estimates from digital images). The standard deviations were not consistently larger or smaller for either directly weighed foods or the estimates obtained from digital images.. These projects with a program such as Head Start further illustrate the adaptability of the method for use with different populations and environments, as well as the ability of researchers and clinicians to utilize the method independently or in collaboration with groups who have previous experience with the method.\n\nThe Remote Food Photography Method: Measurement of food intake in free-living conditions\n\nDescription of the Remote Food Photography Method\n\nThe Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM) estimates the food intake of people in free-living conditions by asking them to capture images of food selection and leftovers with a cell or Smartphone (Martin et al., 2012, Martin et al., 2009a). . Participants are trained to label images of foods that are not easily recognizable with a brief description (e.g., fried chicken). The images are then sent in near real-time through a wireless network to the Food Photography Application© where they are analyzed to estimate food intake using methods that have been previously described (Martin et al., 2012, Martin et al., 2009a, Williamson et al., 2004, Williamson et al., 2003). Similar to analysis of food images with the Digital Photography of Foods Method, images from participants’ phones are compared to images of foods with a known portion size to estimate food intake. In the case of the RFPM, images of foods with known portion sizes are stored in a searchable database called the “archive.” The archive consists of several thousand images of standard portions of foods and it provides the following information that is needed to estimate food intake based on participants’ food images: 1) a standard portion image for portion size estimation, and 2) a link to the nutrient information for each food, which is obtained from either the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 3.0 (2008), the manufacturer’s nutrient information, or a custom recipe.\n\nThe RFPM can be used easily by people to capture food intake information over long periods of time; therefore, semi-automated procedures were developed that rely on both human operators and computer automation to expedite data analysis. This semi-automated approach is adaptable, which allows new technology to be integrated into the procedures and the Food Photography Application© as the Food Photography Application© is further developed and updated. The Food Photography Application© remains the central location for data storage, management, and analysis; therefore, the semi-automated approach can be applied to data collected in both cafeteria settings with the Digital Photography of Foods Method and in free-living conditions with the RFPM. Descriptions of semi-automated techniques are described in more detail in (Gunturk, 2011, Martin et al., 2009b, Zhang and Gunturk, 2008a, Zhang and Gunturk, 2008b, Zhang and Gunturk, 2009). Briefly, when food images are captured a black and white reference card, which is the size of a credit card, is included in the image ( ). This card allows the computer application to correct and standardize images for color and perspective, allowing participants to eat food from any size plate. Computer imaging algorithms can also be employed to automatically identify foods and estimate portion size (Martin et al., 2009b). A Smartphone-based application (i.e., an “app”) has been developed that facilitates the automatic identification of foods via bar code scanning and PLU (Price Look Up) codes. The app also includes a voice message feature that allows participants to quickly use the Smartphone to record a description of the food. The app packages these data (e.g., the food image and the identity of the food from its barcode, PLU number, or the participant’s voice message) and transmits the data package to the Food Photography Application© for estimation of food selection and leftovers, with food intake being calculated as the difference between these two values, as described earlier.\n\nThe RFPM is an innovative approach to food intake assessment, but it is susceptible to certain weaknesses, including people forgetting to capture food images or losing the Smartphone. To address these concerns, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods (Stone, 1994) were integrated into the RFPM to reduce the occurrence of missing data and to foster data integrity. EMA methods utilize communication technology to measure behavioral phenomenon (e.g., tobacco use, binge eating) in real-time in natural settings, which results in ecologically valid data (Stone, 1994). The RFPM incorporated EMA methods by sending prompts (emails, text messages) to peoples’ Smartphones to remind them to capture food images. These prompts are scheduled for automatic delivery through the Food Photography Application© based on individual participant’s meal times, and the timing and frequency of the prompts can be modified. An example of a prompt is “Did you eat or drink anything today and forget to take a picture?”, and participants must reply to each prompt by answering “yes” or “no” with the push of a few buttons or they can type a detailed response. The Food Photography Application© tracks the delivery and response to each prompt and sends reports to the study team summarizing these data, as well as the number of food images received. The study team can easily detect missing data since data transfer occurs in near real-time. includes an illustration of the data collection and transfer process. If a participant is not able to capture images of his/her foods, a back-up method (e.g., food record) is used.\n\nThe RFPM also has inherent limitations that are a function of the available technology that is used to improve the efficiency of data collection and analysis. For example, although we developed computer imaging algorithms to automatically identify foods and estimate portion size (Martin et al., 2009b), these functions are not yet sufficiently advanced to allow for fully automated data analysis. Rather, the process remains semi-automated and a human operator oversees the data collection, management, and analysis process. As new technology is released, however, it can be readily incorporated into the RFPM procedures and a good example of this is use of bar code scanning and PLU (Price Look Up) codes to automatically identify foods.\n\nThe validity of the Remote Food Photography Method for measuring the food intake of adults\n\nThe reliability and validity of the RFPM was first examined in a sample of adults (N = 50) who used the method over 3 days in both laboratory and free-living conditions (Martin et al., 2009a). During this study, energy intake estimated with the RFPM was compared to the energy intake from directly weighed foods and beverages. Weighed intake was obtained in free-living conditions by providing a cooler to participants that contained pre-weighed foods for their evening meals. They returned the cooler the following morning and the post-weight was obtained. The RFPM produced reliable energy intake estimates over three days in both laboratory (intraclass correlation coefficient or ICC = 0.62, p < 0.0001) and free-living (ICC = 0.68, p < 0.0001) conditions, and these values were consistent with natural variation in energy intake. Weighed energy intake correlated highly with estimates from the RFPM in both laboratory (r = 0.93, p < 0.0001) and free-living (r = 0.95, p < 0.0001) conditions. In the laboratory at lunch meal, the RFPM non-significantly (p = .08) underestimated mean (± SEM) energy intake by 36 ± 19 kcal (mean ± SEM energy intake from weighed foods = 655 ± 50 kcal vs. 619 ± 53 kcals from digital image estimates), which corresponds to mean underestimation of 5.5%. In free-living conditions compared to doubly labeled water, the RFPM significantly (p = .02) underestimated energy intake by 97 ± 38 kcal (mean ± SEM energy intake from weighed foods = 1461 ± 105 kcal/day vs. 1364 ± 115 kcal/day from digital image estimates), which corresponds to mean underestimation of 6.6%. Although the RFPM significantly underestimated energy intake in free-living conditions, the underestimate was 97 kcal/day, which is relatively small compared to the error associated with other methods. Additionally, Bland and Altman analyses (Bland and Altman, 1986) indicated that the error from the RFPM did not differ over energy intake levels, and regression analyses indicated that error did not vary by body weight or body mass index (BMI) (Martin et al., 2009a).\n\nTwo additional studies that are reported in (Martin et al., 2012) examined the reliability and validity of the RFPM at measuring the energy intake of adults over six days in free-living conditions and provided a much more stringent test of the method. In the first study, the rigor of EMA methods on the RFPM’s validity was examined. Participants were assigned to one of two EMA groups. The first group received Standard EMA Prompts (n = 24), which consisted of 2 to 3 prompts/day that were sent to the Smartphone around generic meal times (e.g., noon). If data acquisition problems occurred, participants were contacted within 1 to 2 days by study personnel. In the Customized EMA Prompt group (n = 16), participants received 3 to 4 prompts/day that were delivered at individual participants’ meal times, and study personnel contacted participants quickly (i.e., within 24 hours) if data acquisition problems occurred. All participants used the RFPM for six full days in their natural environment and energy intake was simultaneously measured with the doubly labeled water method. When compared to the doubly labeled water method, the RFPM significantly underestimated energy intake when Standard (mean ± SD = −895 ± 770 kcal/day, p < .0001), but not Customized EMA Prompts (mean ± SD = −270 ± 748 kcal/day, p = .22) were used. Error (energy intake estimated with the RFPM minus that from doubly labeled water) was significantly smaller with Customized vs. Standard Prompts and did not vary over levels of energy intake in either group. The error of −270 kcal/day in the Customized group reflects mean participant error of −8.8 ± 29.8% (Martin et al., 2012).\n\nIn the second study, a larger sample of adults (N = 50) used the RFPM for six days in their natural environment while their energy intake was also measured with the doubly labeled water method (Martin et al., 2012). All participants received Customized EMA prompts, as these procedures were incorporated into the RFPM after the first study. Compared to doubly labeled water the RFPM did not significantly over- or underestimate energy intake. Mean (± SD) participant error was −152 ± 694 kcal/day (p = 0.16) or −3.7 ± 28.7%, with energy intake from the doubly labeled water method being 2,360 ± 626 kcal/day (mean ± SD) and estimated energy intake from the RFPM being 2,208 ± 665 kcal/day. During this study, participants also used the RFPM during two laboratory-based buffet meals. These test meals provided a test of the RFPM’s ability to accurately estimate nutrient intake, which cannot be obtained from the doubly labeled water method. During the laboratory-based buffet meals, the RFPM’s error was only −4 ± 73 kcal (mean ± SD) and the error for the three macronutrients and 5 other nutrients was non-significant, though the RFPM significantly (p < .01) overestimated vitamin A and cholesterol ( ). Bland and Altman (Bland and Altman, 1986) analyses were conducted for each nutrient and vitamin and none were significant. Importantly, the RFPM was not associated with undereating when used in free-living conditions, and in all comparisons Bland and Altman analyses indicated that the RFPM’s error did not differ significantly over levels of energy intake. illustrates the Bland and Altman for the comparison of the RFPM to energy intake measured with the doubly labeled water method in 50 adults where mean participant error was −152 ± 694 kcal/day, with no differences in error over levels of energy intake. Regression analyses also found that the RFPM’s error did not differ by age (Adj. R2 = 0.03, p = 0.29), or body weight (Adj. R2 = 0.03, p = 0.12) (Martin et al., 2012).\n\nThe validity of the Remote Food Photography Method at measuring the food intake of children\n\nThe validity of the RFPM at measuring the food intake of preschool-age children was evaluated during two collaborative pilot projects with Baylor College of Medicine and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. In addition to testing the RFPM’s validity, these studies demonstrated that the RFPM can be used in multi-site trials, during which data collection and analysis is managed from a single site. Data were collected in the Houston, Texas area and the images were transferred wirelessly and in near real-time to the Food Photography Application© in Baton Rouge, Louisiana where they were analyzed to estimate food intake. This effort was facilitated by the development of a web-based interface that allows EMA prompt management to occur remotely.\n\nDuring the first collaborative pilot validity study, 12 mothers in the Houston area were trained to use a Smartphone to capture images of foods consumed by their Head Start child in the home over a 24-hour period. Study personnel also used a Smartphone to capture images of the foods consumed by the same children at Head Start (HS) on the same day. Another team of study personnel weighed food selection and leftovers during the same 24-hour period at HS and children’s homes. Total 24-hour food intake estimated with the RFPM was compared to directly weighed food intake. As illustrated in , the RFPM significantly overestimated food intake by a mean of 13%, though this mean difference was very small (9.9 g). Examination of the data identified foods that were difficult to analyze in this pilot study, and elimination of these foods decreased the percent error by 45% to ~7%. The problematic foods included canned fruit and vegetables with liquid, condiments, mixed meals, layered foods, beverages, and foods with inedible portions. We have since adapted our procedures to better collect and analyze data from these problematic foods. Also, during this pilot study, there was a significant correlation of 0.95 between the mean g weight of foods from the RFPM and mean actual g weight. The mean amount of energy served to the preschool children (1,434 kcal) is similar to the amount of energy consumed by children 2 to 5 years from the 2007-2008 NHANES data, whereas the actual amount of energy consumed by preschool children in the pilot study was 840 ± 297 (mean ± SD) kcal (weighed intake) to 976 ± 338 kcal (RFPM) ( ). These data suggest that the parental recalls of young children’s intake in NHANES reflect what was served to the children and not what was actually consumed; thus, this assumption needs to be tested in future studies. These preliminary data are consistent with a previous study (Fisher et al., 2008) where parental 24-hour recalls significantly overestimated young children’s energy intake. Preliminary pilot data on the mean energy and macronutrient intake between the RFPM and weighed intake was very similar ( ).\n\nTable 1\n\nRFPM*meanSDCV%Weighed IntakeMeanSDCV%Energy (kcal)976.4338.334.7Energy (kcal)840.4296.935.3Protein (kcal)161.964.940.1Protein (kcal)138.253.238.5Carbohydrate\n\n(kcal)\n\n526.8\n\n190.2\n\n36.1Carbohydrate\n\n(kcal)\n\n451.1\n\n173.5\n\n38.5Fat (kcal)296.6135.945.8Fat (kcal)258.4119.746.3\n\nThere was no significant difference between study personnel and mothers in the mean amount of food consumed in the home based on the analysis of food images (the difference was 48 g) for the preschool children. There also was no significant difference between the weighed intake of foods consumed in the home and the amount estimated from the mothers’ food images (difference was 32 g). There was a 35 g difference in total food intake consumed in the home between weighed intake and intake generated from the RFPM.\n\nDuring the second collaborative pilot and feasibility study another set of 12 mothers used a Smartphone to capture images of foods consumed by their HS child in the home over a 24-hour period. During the same period, study personnel captured images of foods consumed in the HS center. Similar to the first pilot study, data were transmitted to, and analyzed at, the Pennington Center. After study completion, interviews were conducted with each mother to assess feasibility of the RFPM. There were no significant differences between mean 24-hour intake of these 12 children and the 12 children who participated in the pilot validity study. Results from the interviews with the mothers showed that none of the participants found the Smartphone difficult to utilize, with more than 80% reporting that the study was easy to very easy to complete. 92% reported they would not change anything about the procedures, the way in which they were trained to use the Smartphone, or the EMA prompts. All participants reported that it would not be difficult to capture food images with a Smartphone when eating out. 100% of the mothers reported they would definitely participate in the study again.\n\nThe two pilot studies demonstrated that the RFPM can be used to estimate the food intake of preschool-age children in HS and children’s homes. Further, the pilot studies demonstrated that the RFPM is adaptable to different environments and participants, and that data can be collected and transferred to a central server for analysis from remote locations.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMethods that rely on digital images have been found to reliably and accurately estimate food intake. In cafeteria settings, the Digital Photography of Foods Method accurately estimates the food intake of adults (Williamson et al., 2004, Williamson et al., 2003, Williamson et al., 2002) and children (Martin et al., 2007, Nicklas et al., in press). Digital photography was also found to be a feasible method for collecting intake data on lunch and dinner meals consumed by HS preschool children (Nicklas et al., in press), though there is currently no tests of the method against the doubly labeled water in free-living conditions . In people’s natural environments, the Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM) accurately estimates the food intake of adults (Martin et al., 2012, Martin et al., 2009a) and the results from two pilot studies reported herein indicate that the RFPM accurately estimates the food intake of preschool-age children in HS and home environments. Importantly, data from the RFPM’s validity studies indicate that the method accurately estimates food intake at both the group and individual level, as indicated by the Bland and Altman analysis depicted in . Finally, these methods provide objective data on food selection, leftovers, and food intake. Therefore, rich data are obtained about the energy and nutrient content of the foods selected, discarded, and consumed. Such data can be used to evaluate the effect of an intervention on multiple facets of eating behavior.\n\nApproaches that rely on digital images have many strengths, including reduced participant burden and elimination of the need for participants to estimate portion size. These factors could contribute to user-satisfaction with these methods. For example, satisfaction with the RFPM was favorable among adults who used the method (Martin et al., 2012, Martin et al., 2009a) and among mothers who used the method to estimate the food intake of their children. The RFPM was designed to minimize participant burden and new technology is being developed to further reduce participant burden and improve efficiency and affordability. For example, a Smartphone-based “app” has been developed that improves the user experience and incorporates bar code scanning and Price Look Up codes to automatically identify foods. Lastly, the RFPM is similar in cost or less costly than self-report methods to estimate food intake, namely, pen-and-paper food records and 24-h recall.\n\nThe utility of data from methods that rely on digital images has been clearly established. For example, the effect of interventions or second servings on the food intake of elementary school children in school cafeterias has been demonstrated in a number of studies that relied on the Digital Photography of Foods Method (Martin et al., 2007, Williamson et al., 2012, Williamson et al., 2007) and the method has been used to quantify the food intake behavior of preschool-age children in HS and their homes (Nicklas et al., submitted for publication-b). Further, this method has been used to objectively determine if food provision and intake in school cafeterias (Martin et al., 2010) and HS Centers (Nicklas et al., submitted for publication-a) meets national guidelines, and this information can be used to inform policy decisions. The RFPM data has also proven useful, particularly since Smartphones are used to collect and transfer data, and data can be analyzed in near real-time. These features allow clinicians to quickly review patients’ data and to send data-driven feedback that can be delivered directly to patients’ Smartphone. Hence, the RFPM provides a foundation for patients to quickly receive feedback about their eating behavior, as well as to receive recommendations to modify their food intake to meet a goal, such as losing weight or eating a healthy diet. Importantly, almost half of Americans (46%) already own a Smartphone (Smith, Accessed April 18, 2012.), indicating that many people already own the data collection device. Further, the RFPM Smartphone app that was recently developed can be downloaded onto participants’ own iPhone or Android smartphone, which we have found participants prefer compared to being loaned a smartphone during the data collection process since they need to only carry one device.\n\nDigital imaging methods are not without limitations, however. As noted earlier, people can forget to capture food images, lose the Smartphone, or experience technical problems that could impede collecting RFPM data. Participants are trained to use a back-up method, which is typically a food record, if they are not able to capture images of their foods, and a back-up method is utilized on 8.9% of days and makes up 9.7% of total energy intake estimates (Martin et al., 2012). This information highlights that the RFPM is an imperfect tool and that flexibility in its use, such as training participants to use a back-up method, can facilitate the collection of complete data. An additional limitation is the fact that current computer imaging algorithms are not sufficiently advanced to correctly identify foods and accurately estimate the amount of food in the images with 100% accuracy. Hence, the data analytic procedures remain semi-automated and a human operator supervises the process. The incorporation of bar code scanning and PLU (Price Look Up) codes to automatically identify foods has significantly improved the efficiently and user experience in identifying foods, however. Finally, certain types of foods, such as condiments, can be difficult to analyze with digital images, though these types of foods are typically difficult to estimate using other methods, as well.\n\nIn summary, methods that utilize digital images have proven effective at quantifying food intake in cafeteria settings and people’s natural environment. Approaches that rely on digital images have many advantages, including reduced participant burden and the ability to quantify food intake at the group and individual level. Work continues to further automate digital imaging approaches."
