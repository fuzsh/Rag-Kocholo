And we donât use data from Drive, Gmail and Photos for ads, either.\n\nYou can control what information is used to personalize ads and manage your ads preferences with My Ad Center.\n\nGoogle uses your information to show you ads that we think are relevant to your interests based on your activities or help you discover something new.\n\nFor example, if youâre researching new cars, itâs more useful to see ads featuring promotions from local car dealers than to see generic ads for balcony furniture or pet food.\n\nYou're always in control of your data with easy-to-use privacy tools, and it's always your choice to share information with Google and decide how it's used for advertising."
