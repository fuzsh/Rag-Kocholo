        "text": "Mobile workers in areas without a reliable data connection, or with no data connection, download map areas to their device to capture assets, record observations, and perform inspections. Once they finish collection, the changes appear only on their device. They must sync to make the changes available to other mobile workers as well as workers in the office. In some scenarios, mobile workers also need to get changes made by others onto their device to keep their map current. This is also done when the map area is synced.\n\nSync work\n\nSync allows you to send and receive updates for maps you've downloaded. Anytime you regain connectivity and want to check for updates or send updates to other people, sync the map either while editing it or from the list of maps. You can also enable automatic syncing so that your map syncs whenever it has a data connection.\n\nWhile working in the map, tap Sync ( if you have edits that aren't synced) to open the Sync panel. In the panel, review the edits you made, if any, and tap Sync.\n\nTip:\n\nEnable automatic sync if you want sync to begin when you have a data connection.\n\nIf Sync is not available in the panel, the map is configured to limit the data retrieved from the server and you don't have local edits.\n\nIn the list of maps, find the map area you want to sync. If it includes local edits, the number of local edits is shown. Tap the map's Overflow menu and tap Sync.\n\nEnable automatic sync\n\nMobile workers may have sporadic connectivity, or they may not always remember to sync their changes. Enabling automatic sync sends the mobile worker's edits and retrieves the latest changes when there is a data connection without the mobile worker needing to explicitly sync.\n\nYou can enable automatic sync either from the Field Maps settings or while working in a map. Whichever way it's enabled, the setting applies to all offline maps used in Field Maps. The active map area automatically syncs every 15 minutes if the device has a data connection and the app is on screen. The map area does not sync if the device doesn't detect an internet connection.\n\nAutomatic sync is enabled by default.\n\nEnable automatic sync in the app settings\n\nTo enable automatic sync in the app settings, complete the following steps:\n\nWhile viewing the Maps list, tap Profile .\n\nIn the General section of the profile, use the Auto-sync toggle button to turn on automatic sync.\n\nReturn to your profile, and return to the Maps list.\n\nEnable automatic sync while working with an offline map area\n\nTo enable automatic sync while working with an offline map area, complete the following steps:\n\nWhile working in an offline map area, tap Sync ( if you have edits that aren't synced) to open the Sync panel.\n\nIn the Sync panel, use the Auto-Sync toggle button to turn on automatic sync.\n\nSync over Wi-Fi only\n\nYou may not want your workers to sync using a device's data plan and instead want them to wait for a Wi-Fi connection. Complete the following steps to turn off syncing using cellular data.\n\nSyncing using cellular data is disabled by default.\n\nWhile viewing the Maps list, tap Profile .\n\nIn the General section of the profile, tap Cellular data.\n\nTurn off the Sync and update toggle button to restrict syncing using cellular data.\n\nReturn to your profile, and return to the Maps list."
