        "text": "In photos, there are a few albums that is automatically created by Apple where it save photos or video automatically. But the problem is, my Tiktok album that should be automatically separate all the tiktok videos that i have saved from the others stop responding. The album didn’t separate it automatically. What should i do to make this thing fix? I hope you guys can help me with this problem because i have been trying all the things to make things work but nothing ever happened. Thank you if u respond\n\nI’m having the same issue. I updated my phone late last year and now every time I save a tiktok, the video no longer files into a separate folder. It’s really frustrating because I have no way of separating my videos from the videos I save.\n\nI'm having the same issue. It's so annoying to have to move them from \"Recents\" into the TikTok folder that was automatically created before the update.\n\nPlus, if I try deleting from \"Recents\" the ones i moved manually into \"TikTok\" album, it deletes them from both albums entirely.\n\nI’m struggling with the same issue, is there anyone who solved this problem?\n\nThe other albums (WhatsApp, Instagram) are working but not the one for saved TikTok videos..."
