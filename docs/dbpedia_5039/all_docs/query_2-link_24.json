        "text": "Do you ever find yourself scrolling madly through your phone’s camera roll, looking for that one fabulous vacation shot you’re describing to a friend — and you can’t find it in the river of 4,000 photos? Or do you want to collect all the pictures of a child, scattered through the years, for a slide show but don’t have time to find them?\n\nHerding pictures into sensible albums on the phone can be tedious if you bother at all, but here’s the good news: If you’ve been using the current versions of Google Photos on your Android or Apple device or Apple’s Photos for iOS, there’s a good chance that the apps have been organizing your images for you.\n\nIt can be a little unnerving to see how these apps have analyzed your pictures. But the software can save you hours and is simple to use. Here are ways to use the programs — and how to tweak them to adjust to your needs.\n\nIf your phone’s location services setting was enabled when you took the pictures, the geographical coordinates were likely embedded into the image file; this is also called “geotagging.” Tap the Albums tab in Google Photos or Apple’s Photo app to see the Places album, with pictures labeled and grouped by location. Tap a thumbnail to see all the photos taken in that spot, regardless of the date.\n\nNo GPS information in the photo file? You can add locations manually in the desktop editions of Google Photos and Apple’s Photos. Open the photo you want to tag, click the Info icon — which looks like an encircled “i” — and choose the option in the information box to edit or assign a location.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
