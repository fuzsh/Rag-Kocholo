We have no idea how that happened, how to stop it and how to fix it?\n\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nThank you\n\nI get this guys picture no matter what the email address (gmail etc...) Does he happen to be the one showing up in your contacts too, because I'm beginning to think some back end IT put in a fun little easter egg.\n\nHi @KAldrich\n\nThank you for reaching out.\n\nThis is strange, the picture should come from the associated company as explained here. Could it be that someone manually added this picture to several contacts? If not, can you send me via DM 2 or 3 contacts who have this picture?\n\nThank you\n\nBest\n\nTiphaine\n\nSaviez vous que la Communauté est disponible en français?\n\nRejoignez les discussions francophones en changeant votre langue dans les paramètres !\n\nDid you know that the Community is available in other languages?\n\nJoin regional conversations by changing your language settings !\n\nHey @nweiteakmp this is a popular question and the answer is on our Knowledge Base:\n\nWhere does the contact image on a contact record come from?\n\nHow do I change the photo of my contact in their contact record?\n\nLet me know if you have any questions further to the details and instructions provided above.\n\nWe have had this issue as well where one clients photo has been applied to every other contact at the same business.\n\nIs there a way to bulk remove this image from everyones record?\n\nI found that there is a feature called Hubspot Insights that populates the company's information from some database and all my contacts that have the same domain got that image, which is the wrong one."
