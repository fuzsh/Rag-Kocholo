        "text": "Preserving memories has never been easier, thanks to Amazon Prime's hidden gem: Amazon Photos. Here's your guide on how to access and make the most of this invaluable Prime membership benefit.\n\nWhat is Amazon Photos?\n\nAmazon Photos provides safe and reliable online storage for your cherished photos and videos. Safekeeping your photos and videos in the cloud keeps them secure, even if your devices (and the pictures in them) are lost or destroyed.\n\nAs a Prime member, you receive 5 GB of video storage plus unlimited photo storage on Amazon Photos. You can use the service to securely backup your photos and videos, share your images with loved ones, and showcase special moments on your Amazon devices.\n\nNot a Prime member? No problem. All Amazon Photos customers get 5 GB of photo and video storage when they sign up—free of charge.\n\nReady to ensure your memories are securely backed up and reclaim valuable space on your phone? Keep reading to learn more about everything you can get with Amazon Photos.\n\nHow to get started with Amazon Photos\n\nIf you’re using Amazon Photos in the U.S., start by visiting Amazon Photos on Amazon.com. From there, sign in or click on “Apps” and follow instructions to install Amazon Photos on your iOS, Android, and other devices. Once you are prompted, sign in using your Amazon account.\n\nHow to upload files to the Amazon Photos app\n\nBacking up your photos and videos is quick and easy. Once you’re signed in, the app will take you through a few prompts to adjust your settings and grant access to your photos and videos.\n\nYou can enable the Auto Save feature to automatically sync your camera roll with your Amazon Photos account, or start manually selecting images to add.\n\nBe sure to enable notifications to monitor your storage usage and enjoy the complete Amazon Photos experience, including reminders of features like \"This Day.\"\n\nHow to Auto-Save your photos and videos to Amazon Photos\n\nBy enabling Auto Save within the Amazon Photos app, your photos and videos will automatically be saved to your Amazon Photos account from your device using the Amazon Photos app. Select the option to Auto-Save your device’s photos when you sign in to the app for the first time, or head to the home screen of the app and click the button that says “Automatically save from your device” to start syncing your files if you’ve already signed in.\n\nHow to get more storage in Amazon Photos\n\nPrime members get free, unlimited photo storage and 5 GB of storage for video. If you’d like to upgrade to get more video storage, here are a few of your options:\n\n100 GB for $1.99/month: Stores about 14 hours of 1080p HD video\n\n1 TB for $6.99/month: Stores about 140 hours of 1080p HD video\n\n2 TB for $11.99/month: Stores about 280 hours of 1080p HD video\n\nCheck out additional storage options\n\nIf you’re using Amazon Photos on your computer, find the menu on the left side of the screen and click “Storage” then “Manage storage” to update your preferences.\n\nIf you’re on the Amazon Photos mobile app, click the Amazon smile logo in the top left of your screen, then click “Photo storage” and scroll to the bottom of the page to adjust your video storage settings.\n\nHow to access photos or videos stored in Amazon Photos\n\nYou can access the photos and videos you’ve saved any time and from any device.

Invited customers will need to sign in with their Amazon account or create an Amazon Photos account before uploading photos.
