        "text": "Uploading images\n\nYou can use different types of images, such as your company logo, product images, slideshows, banners, and blog posts images. You can transform your images with crop and resize actions. You can customize your media settings in your theme to change the border or shadow on all media displayed on your store.\n\nTo display images in your online store exactly as you want them to, you need to use the correct image aspect ratio. Images are automatically optimized for your storefront with the Shopify CDN.\n\nUpload an image in the theme editor\n\nYou can add images to your theme in the theme editor. You can also upload images on the Files page of your Shopify admin. To learn more, refer to Uploading files to your website.\n\nSteps:\n\nFrom your Shopify admin, go to Online Store > Themes.\n\nClick Customize next to the theme that you want to customize.\n\nUse the drop-down menu to select the template that you want to edit.\n\nFrom the theme editor sidebar, click the section or block that you want to add an image to.\n\nClick Select Image, and then do one of the following:\n\nTo upload an image from your computer, click Upload.\n\nTo use a free stock image from Burst, click Explore free images.\n\nClick an image to see a preview of the image in your theme. After you find an image that you want to use, click Select.\n\nClick Save.\n\nAdd an image by using metafields\n\nIf you have metafields set up for your images, then you can use the dynamic source picker to add an image. For more information about metafields and supported image formats, refer to Metafield content types and values.\n\nImage banners\n\nYou can create image banners with the following elements:\n\none or two images\n\ntext\n\nan action button\n\nOn desktop computers, banner images are displayed side by side. Because this format isn't suited for mobile devices, you can stack your image banner pictures by selecting the Stack images on mobile option in the Image banner theme settings. For more information on image banners and slideshows, refer to Best practices for slideshow and image banners.\n\nSet a focal point on a theme image\n\nYou can use focal points to define the most important part of an image on your online store's theme. When you set a focal point on an image, you make it the area of focus. Focal points always appear in frame, even if you have a theme that crops your image to fit the layout. Focal points give you more control over the way your image is displayed when themes use different aspect ratios, and on varying screen sizes.\n\nYou can only have one focal point per image, but you can change it or remove it at any time.\n\nSetting a focal point is available on the following versions of free Shopify themes:\n\nCraft version 5.0.0 or higher\n\nCrave version 5.0.0 or higher\n\nColorblock version 3.0.0 or higher\n\nDawn version 7.0.0 or higher\n\nRefresh version 2.0.0 or higher\n\nRide version 3.0.0 or higher\n\nSense version 5.0.0 or higher\n\nStudio version 4.0.0 or higher\n\nTaste version 4.0.0 or higher\n\nIf you're using a third-party theme, then check your theme's documentation to see if your theme supports using focal points.\n\nAdd a focal point to an image\n\nYou can add a focal point to an image from your Files section, and from your theme editor. If you add a focal point on an image, and then use the image in multiple places, then they all use the same focal point.\n\nYou can only add a focal point to theme images. You can't add a focal point to product, blog or collection images.\n\nRemove a focal point\n\nImage formats\n\nShopify supports the following image formats:\n\nJPEG\n\nProgressive JPEG\n\nPNG\n\nGIF\n\nHEIC\n\nWebP\n\nWhen to use JPEG images\n\nJPEG images are ideal for photography and other still images with complex colors. The JPEG format has a palette with millions of colors. JPEG also has lossy compression, which can help to keep page loading times fast without a noticeable loss in image quality.\n\nUse the JPEG format for the following kinds of images:\n\nproducts\n\nbanners or slideshows\n\npages and blog posts\n\nWhen to use PNG images\n\nPNG images are ideal for graphics and icons with flat colors and without gradients. The PNG format is also able to support transparency.\n\nUse the PNG format for the following kinds of images:\n\nlogos\n\nicons\n\nborders and trims\n\nAutomatic image compression and format selection\n\nTo keep load times fast, Shopify automatically compresses images when they're displayed on your online store. Compressing an image means reducing the file size to allow for faster page loading.\n\nAdditionally, Shopify automatically determines the best possible file format to use when delivering your images. For example, when we detect that a customers web browser supports modern image formats such as WebP and AV1 Image File Format (AVIF), Shopify will deliver your image in those formats.\n\nTo improve performance by reducing the file size, GIFs are automatically converted to the animated WebP format.\n\nUpload limits\n\nImage uploads to Shopify have restrictions in terms of both megapixels and file size (measured in megabytes). Megapixels are used to indicate how many millions of pixels make up an image. Megabytes are used to indicate how many millions of bytes of memory or disk space an image takes up.\n\nImages uploaded to Shopify can't exceed either of the following limits:\n\n20 megapixels\n\n20 megabytes\n\nTo find your image's megapixels, you can use the following equation: (pixel width x pixel height)/1,000,000. For example, an image with a resolution of 4900x6930 would be 33.9 megapixels based on the equation: (4900x6930)/1,000,000 = 33.9 MP.\n\nColor profiles\n\nWhen you view an image on your online store, the colors in the image might look different from those in the original that you uploaded to Shopify. This can occur when an image has a color profile, which is a set of data stored in a file with a .ICC or .ICM extension. Color profiles are often embedded into images to help standardize the way that the colors appear on different devices. When images are displayed on your online store, their color profiles are removed.\n\nColor profiles are removed for a few reasons:\n\nNot all devices are able to read .ICC or .ICM color profiles, so keeping them intact can result in inconsistencies in image colors across devices.\n\nWhen an uploaded image doesn't include a color profile, sRGB (the most common color profile used to display images on the web) is assumed by the web browser. This ensures that your images look the same across all major web browsers and devices.\n\nColor profiles can take up large amounts of disk space, which can result in heavy loading times.\n\nRemove the color profile from an image\n\nYou can remove the color profile from your image by saving it without the color profile before you upload it to Shopify. This process varies depending on your image editing program.\n\nRemove a color profile using Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop\n\nTo remove a color profile using Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop:\n\nClick Edit > Assign Profile.\n\nSelect Donâ€™t Color Manage This Document.\n\nClick OK.\n\nRemove a color profile using Adobe InDesign\n\nTo remove a color profile using Adobe InDesign:\n\nClick Edit > Assign Profile.\n\nFor RGB Profile and CMYK Profile, select Discard (Use Current Working Space).\n\nClick OK.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can view the Adobe documentation on color profiles.\n\nBest practices for slideshows, image banners, and full-width images\n\nMany Shopify themes feature large images or slideshows that scale to the height of your browser or adapt to your screen size.\n\nIf you use one of these themes or have a large slideshow or background image, then it's important to understand what types of images will look best.\n\nBecause large images can't fit on all devices, Shopify sometimes displays only part of the image depending on the device you're using. If your image slideshow contains a lot of large images, then you might find that parts of the images aren't visible.\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo make sure that your images work well with your theme, here are some things to keep in mind:\n\nImages that you use for slideshows or backgrounds shouldn't have text in them. If the text is a part of the image itself, then it might get moved around, cropped, or adjusted based on your theme. Use the theme editor to add text and links to your slideshows.\n\nFor images that you use in slideshows or as backgrounds, choose simple images so that any overlying text is easy to read.\n\nWide images on tall screens\n\nWide images might be cropped on the left and right when the device used to view them has a tall screen (like a mobile phone or tablet). In the example below, if the people are the most important part of the image, then you can place a focal point on the right side of the image:\n\nTall images on wide screens"
