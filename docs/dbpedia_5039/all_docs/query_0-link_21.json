        "text": "For an image taken with a digital camera this information is stored and very easily accessible. What mode the camera was in such as Auto, Manual, Program, Aperture Priority, or Shutter Priority and more information can be found using the EXIF data that is stored along with the image. It is all included in the image file such as a .JPEG file in what we call metadata.\n\nWhat exactly is stored in the EXIF data is outlined well already here:\n\nWhat useful things can/can't you find out from exif tags?\n\nThe easiest way to view the EXIF data is actually an online tool: Jeffrey's Exif Viewer\n\nDownloadable software is also available in many forms to view EXIF data if you are going to be doing it more often, such as EXIF Tool, or essentially any quality photo editing software.\n\nMost digital cameras include the shooting mode, the metering mode, and even the focus mode in the EXIF information. The EXIF information can be viewed with most photo processing applications such as Adobe Lightroom or the software that came with the camera. Not all applications will display every field of the EXIF data, so you may need to try more than one. If you need a free application that can open a variety of file formats and displays a fairly comprehensive list of EXIF information, give Irfanview a try.\n\nHere's a screen grab from the EXIF information for a photo I recently took with a Canon 7D as viewed using Canon's Digital Photo Professional that is included with Canon DSLRs.\n\nBelow is the same information from the same photo when displayed using Irfanview. Notice that the focus information is in the 'Maker Note' section, which is a place for manufacturers to include non-standardized information in the EXIF info. This means it can and does vary from manufacturer to manufacturer how or even if the information is included. Adobe products tend to ignore most parts of the 'Maker Note' section of the EXIF data. Observe that Irfanview properly identified the focus mode as AI Focus, but failed to properly describe other fields in the 'Maker Note' section such as the sharpness setting indicated by Canon's code '-32769' or the ISO value indicated by a '32767' code. In the standardized section of the EXIF not visible in this screen grab, the ISO used is properly identified as ISO 2500.\n\nIf you are on macOS, there are two solutions. Both of them are free and there is no need to add anything to your device.\n\nA. You just want to check the shooting mode quickly:\n\nRight click on the image in Finder\n\nselect Get Info. Shortcut key is Command + I.\n\nThen you will be able to see info like Exposure program (shooting mode) and some other info that are not visible in Lightroom.\n\nB. You want to see all metadata information:\n\nOpen the image in Preview application, which comes with macOS by default, then\n\nselect the View menu > Show Inspector. Shortcut key here is Command + I as well.\n\nInside the presenting window, select Exif tab and you will get all metadata information."
