If you require the ability to create collections, then you need to upgrade to a higher plan such as Basic Shopify, Shopify, Advanced Shopify, or Shopify Plus. Learn more about the different plan features.\n\nIf you're on the Basic Shopify plan or higher, then you can group your products into collections to make it easier for customers to find them by category. Here are a few examples of collections that you might create:\n\nclothes for men, women, or children\n\nitems of a certain type, such as lamps, cushions, or rugs\n\nitems on sale\n\nitems in a certain size or color\n\nseasonal products, such as holiday cards and decorations\n\nYou can create two types of collections, an automated or manual collection. After you create a collection, it can be displayed on your online store as a webpage with a gallery of the products that are in the collection. Your customers can then click a product image on the collection page to visit a specific product's page. You can help customers find and view collections by adding links to the collections in a menu in your store's navigation.\n\nThe exact layout and appearance of collection pages depends on your theme.\n\nYou can view, create, and edit collections from the Collections page of your Shopify admin.\n\nIn this section"
