        "text": "Q: Thank you for the article on the cloud and photo storage. I have a couple of questions: Is Google photos an app? How do I move my photos to it? ~Charlyce Friday\n\nTech+ Glad you asked!\n\nGoogle Photos, formerly known as Picasa, is a feature built into a user’s Google/Gmail account. If you’re on your laptop and logged into Gmail, look for the nine tiny squares near the top right of your screen. Those are other Google features you have access to. If you don’t see “Photos,” which looks like a rainbow pin wheel, click the “More” until you see photos. It’s also available here: photos.google.com.\n\nYou can stash photos here while on your computer. Or add fresh photos using the mobile app, available for Android and iOS phones.\n\nAfter you download the app, the installation takes you through the process of linking to your Google account. When you open it for the first time, the app will ask permission to access your photos (say yes!), and whether it should back them up to your account (yes again). Say “no” to backing up via cellular connection (that will use up all your mobile data) so Google Photos limits backup when the phone is connected over Wi-Fi. Google also offers free unlimited storage if you opt for lower resolution photos.\n\nOnce backed up, photos on the phone can be accessed on a computer by going to the same Google Photos feature — or any device that you have signed in to Google.\n\nWatch me set up Google Photos on my iPhone in a new Tech+ video that will be posted at dpo.st/techplus on Monday.\n\nApple’s iCloud doesn’t offer an Android app, though there are third-party apps that will sync an Android phone with a user’s iCloud account. But if you use Apple’s Cloud storage, which offers the first 5 GB for free, you can set photos to automatically back up to the cloud by going to “Settings,” then “iCloud” and “Photos.” Users will see four options on how the phone should back up items to the cloud.\n\nIf you prefer an independent app not made by the company that makes your phone, there’s Dropbox (dropbox.com/mobile). To add automatic backup, go to “settings” and turn on “camera uploads.” Additional details at dpo.st/dbsave.\n\nAmazon — yes, the retailer — also offers cloud photo storage. The company has a huge web services division so its Amazon Cloud Drive shouldn’t be a surprise. Amazon Photos, available in Android and iOS, is free for Amazon Prime users and starts at $11.99 a year for everyone else. It can be set to automatically upload new photos to Amazon’s cloud.\n\nFor the most part, find the photo app’s settings and look for auto-save or backup.\n\nSee past Tech+ answers or ask your own tech question at dpo.st/mailbag.
