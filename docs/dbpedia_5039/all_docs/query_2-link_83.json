        "text": "Image Choice is a simple, closed-ended question type that lets people select one or more image answers from a defined list of image choices. SurveyMonkey auto-formats your uploaded images into consistent boxes with a maximum height of 170px (or maximum width of 225px).\n\nBefore you send your survey, preview your survey design to see what your survey will look like to people taking it.\n\nSurvey takers will see the images and captions with the survey question. By default people can choose one answer, but you can check the box to Allow more than one answer to this question (use checkboxes) to allow people to select more than one.\n\nImage Choice questions are easy to analyze since they are closed-ended. You can create Filter and Compare rules to break down your survey results, and every chart type is available for this question.\n\nImages don't display in the Analyze results page. Instead, if you added captions to the images, youâ€™ll see those displayed in the chart. Otherwise, answer choices will be labeled with a number based on the order they appear in the survey. For example, the first image will be labeled Image 1, and the second image will be labeled Image 2."
