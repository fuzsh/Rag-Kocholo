        "text": "Select the photos, go to the develop module and toggle the little switch of ‘Synchronize’ so it becomes ‘Auto Sync’.\n\nThank you for your response. When you say \"little switch\", you're not kidding. Never saw it there before. I was prepared to respond to your post to let you know that it did not work for me but figured out why just before posting my response.\n\nFor others that read this thread, once you have toggled the switch to \"Auto Sync\", you click on the \"Auto\" button just like you do when you are auto editing one photo. (I was clicking on the \"Auto Sync\" button and nothing was happening.)\n\nThanks again for pointing me in the right direction.\n\nAlso be aware that \"Auto Sync\" is the most dangerous tool in all of Lightroom.\n\nIt works fine but is at the root of a large number of disastors which are hard or impossible to undo. The problem is that it is way too easy to become distracted and forget to turn it off (even though the button changes to light gray from dark gray) and then hours, days or weeks go by with it still on and EVERY change you make in the Develop module is applied to EVERY selected image.\n\nI can't tell you how many times clients have accidentally left this on and inadvertantly changed hundreds or thousands of images without realizing it (after all you're only seeing the one image you actaully want to change in the workarea of the screen when this happens). Then weeks later after doing many other things they realize that some unknown number of images have been changed when they shouuldn't have been. And, there's really no way to even determine which images had been changed and which are still OK.\n\nUnfortunatly there is no Auto Tone check box on the \"sync\" menu or as a selection when creatng a preset so you can't use those techinques to propagate an \"auto tone\" from one image to several others. In addition the \"Previous\" button also does not propagate the \"auto tone\" command (rather it propogates the result of the original auto tone command). So you have the choice of clicking Auto Tone on each individual image one by one or using the dangerous Auto Sync.\n\nEven though I am very familiar with LrC and how it works, I too have forgotten to turn Auto Sync off and have wrecked hundreds of images. So, for everything except auto tone I opt for either the plain \"sync\" or \"previous\" buttons to copy develop setitngs from one image to a set of other images. I rarely use Auto Tone but if I did, I'd choose to do the images one by one rather than assum the risk that comes with Auto Tone."
