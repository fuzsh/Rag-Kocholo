        "text": "Manually updating your collections can be a real hassle—especially if you have a large number of products or frequently change your inventory. But what if there was a way to switch your manual collections to automated ones and save yourself a lot of time and effort?\n\nIn this article, we'll explain how to make the change from manual to automatic collections and share some tips for maximizing the benefits of this feature.\n\n» See how automated inventory management solutions can save time and boost efficiency\n\nWhat Is a Manual Collection in Shopify?\n\nThis can be beneficial if you want to create collections that showcase related products or make it easier for your customers to navigate and find specific items within your store.\n\n» Learn how to add products to Shopify collections\n\nWhat Is an Automated Collection Type in Shopify?\n\nShopify's automated collections let you organize your inventory based on a set of rules you define. You can use these collections to group products in various ways, such as by brand, color, size, or type.\n\nShopify provides sixty different conditions for you to choose from when creating automated collections. And once you set up the rules, Shopify automatically creates and updates the collections for you.\n\nIf the number of products in your Shopify collection has become too large to manage manually, switching to automated collections can save you time and keep your shop organized.\n\n» Streamline your Shopify operations with automated inventory management. Understand how automation can simplify your workflow and enhance accuracy\n\nCan You Change a Manual Collection to an Automated One in Shopify?\n\nNo, you can't directly change a manual collection into an automated one in Shopify. But you can create a new automated collection to replace your existing manual collection. Here's how:\n\nLog in to your Shopify admin and go to the Products page.\n\nUse the Search and filter feature to find all the products you want to add to your automated collection.\n\nClick the checkbox at the top left corner of the product list.\n\nSelect the three-dot menu at the top of the page.\n\nChoose Add tags from the dropdown menu.\n\nCreate a unique and descriptive tag (or multiple tags) for these products in the Add tags field. For example, \"summer-collection\" or \"best-sellers.\" You'll use these tags to set up the conditions for your new automated collection.\n\nClick Save to apply the tags to the selected products.\n\nGo to the Collections page using the left sidebar menu.\n\nClick on Create collection.\n\nEnter a name and description for your new automated collection.\n\nChoose the Automated option in the Collection type section.\n\nSet up the rules for your automated collection in the Conditions section.\n\nClick Add condition and select Product tag from the dropdown menu.\n\nType in the tag (or tags) you created earlier in the empty field.\n\nClick Save to create your new automated collection.\n\n» Organize your Shopify store like a pro! Find out how to add collections within collections and sort them effectively\n\nAutomatically Manage Your Collections With Apps\n\nIf you find that Shopify's preset conditions don't quite fit your needs or you want to take your collection management to the next level, third-party Shopify apps can help.\n\nApps like Bestsellers reSort come with many configuration options. You can organize your products in various ways—to fit each collection and the specific products you sell. Plus, you can sort by tags to create your own unique order. Just upload your CSV file once, and the app categorizes your products automatically.\n\n» Discover how to create custom sort rules for better customer engagement and sales\n\nLearn what other features Bestsellers reSort offers and how they can help you maintain complete control over sorting:\n\nEnhance Your Shopify Inventory Management\n\nAutomated collections and third-party apps can improve your Shopify inventory management process. They can save you time, reduce errors, and let you focus on growing your business. But while Shopify's built-in features are great, using additional software can open up even more possibilities.\n\nThe key is to find the right balance between automation and customization for your store. Don't be afraid to try out different settings and apps to see what works best. It might take some experimenting, but ensuring a smooth shopping experience for your customers is worth it."
