        "text": "We believe you should always know what data we collect from you, how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both. We want to empower users to make the best decisions about the information that they share with us. In fact, we made a short video for students and children that highlights the most important details in our Privacy Policy that they should know about. We offer a Student Data PrivacyAddendum, an agreement we enter into with schools or districts that further describes our duties, responsibilities, and commitments with respect to Student Data that we collect or receive.\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies solely to the ClassDojo Services (defined below) and does not apply to the informational website located at https://www.classdojo.com (the \"ClassDojo Website\"). The ClassDojo Website Privacy Policy is located here. Additionally, if you are using our Dojo Tutoring product, please find the Dojo Tutoring Privacy Policy located here.\n\nYou should read this policy in [full], but here are the highlights:\n\nPersonal Information We Collect : Please see this page where we detail the personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.\n\nWe also have Online Tracking Technologies Policy. You can also find more details below.\n\nHow We Use the Information We Collect : We use the personal information we collect from students (or about students from teachers and parents) to provide and improve the Service, for educational purposes, security, and safety purposes, or as allowed by law. We will not require children to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the Service. See here for more information on our use of information collected from students and children using the Service not connected to a school or classroom (\"Outside School Child User\"), including for educational and other learning activities at home through certain premium features that may be purchased, ( \" Premium Features\"). For additional information regarding our use of information collected from teachers, parents, and school leaders, see here.\n\nData Retention : We will not retain student personal information for any longer than is necessary for educational purposes and legal obligations, or to provide the Service for which we receive or collect the student personal information. We protect students with our industry-leading Student Data Protection Policy: we automatically delete their Feedback Points awarded in school after a year, and we delete Students' Accounts if they're inactive for more than twelve months. Some content within a student account utilized in school or for educational purposes connected to a school or classroom (\"Student Account\") will be kept after deletion of the account for school legal compliance reasons (e.g., maintenance of \"education records\" under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or \"Student Data\" under state student privacy laws or equivalent laws in international jurisdictions) and will not be deleted until we receive direction from the school. This can include content uploaded by a student, teacher, school leader, or parent.\n\nWe store non-student user personal information, including content uploaded by Outside School Child Users, for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Service to you and others. For non-student users (as well as Outside School Child Users), personal information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted or until we no longer need the data to provide the Service, whichever occurs first. Additionally, some data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time. For additional information on our retention periods, see here.\n\nWhat Children's Information is Shown Publicly? No Student's Account, or Outside School Child User's account(\"Outside School Child Account\"), profile, or Portfolio is made available or visible to the general public through ClassDojo. For a list of what logged in student users and Outside School Child User's information can be viewed by other logged-in ClassDojo users, please see our FAQ.\n\nWe Never Sell Personal Information : We will never sell or rent your personal information or non-personal information. We will only disclose personal information as set forth in the Privacy Policy, such as with a limited set of third-party service providers necessary to provide or develop our Services (such as database hosting) or as required by law, and we will be transparent about who these service providers are.\n\nWe will contractually require that these service providers process personal information in accordance with our instructions and consistent with this Privacy Policy. We ensure that these service providers employ reasonable and comprehensive data protection and security protocols. See here for more details.\n\nWe make clear commitments, consistent with our obligations under the Student Privacy Pledge, regarding how we handle student data in the event of a change to our organization (such as a merger) where personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred or acquired. Consistent with the Student Privacy Pledge and applicable state and federal laws, in connection with such a change to our organization, this Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this Privacy Policy (unless you give consent to a new policy). Please see here for more details.\n\nWe never use student or children's data for behaviorally targeted or third-party advertising : Information collected from students and Outside School Child Users (including personal information and information collected automatically) is never used or disclosed for third-party advertising. We also do not place any third-party advertisements in student or Outside School Child User logged-in areas of the Service. Additionally, personal information collected from students and Outside School Child Users is never used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students or Outside School Child Users by us or any third-party. We may present contextually relevant educational content (not using Student or Outside School Child User personal information) for either our own products (e.g., Premium Features) or third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to a student (e.g., our co-created content with Yale University on Mindfulness, and Heart of a Champion series) or an Outside School Child User.\n\nYou own your data : We don't own any content or information you provide or we receive - you (students, Outside School Child Users, parents, and/or schools) will own your content and information.\n\nSecurity and Privacy by Design and Default : We use security industry best practices to protect personal information, including using encryption and other security safeguards to protect personal information. We design products with security and privacy in mind from day one. See here for more information as well as our Security Whitepaper and Privacy Center.\n\nTransparency and Choice : We will be transparent about our practices so that you can make meaningful choices about how your personal information is used. If we make a material change, we will provide prominent notice by posting a notice on our Service or this website page and/or we will notify you by email (if you have provided an email address to us). See here for more information.\n\nRight to Access, Correction, and Deletion of Data : We support access to, correction, and deletion of children's personal information by the student or their parent or legal guardian, either by 1) assisting the school in meeting its requirements for access, correction, and deletion or by responding to requests we receive from schools, or 2) directly responding to requests from parents or legal guardians when the information is collected from an Outside School Child User, and ClassDojo obtains the consent directly from the parent or legal guardian. Where we are directly responding to requests from parents or legal guardians, the school would not be acting as the agent of the parent and consenting - such as when they are using our Premium Features or use ClassDojo not connected to a school.\n\nTeachers, parents, school leaders, and other users can contact us at privacy@classdojo.com from the email used to create your account or here once you are signed in to your account to access, correct, or update their personal information, or they can use the features in their account settings to do so. See here for more information on all user's rights, including about any additional rights you may have depending on the jurisdiction you reside in.\n\nWe collect two types of information about you: (1) information that you voluntarily provide us by using the Service (described below under \"Information You Provide to Us\") and (2) information collected automatically as result of your use of the Service (described below under \"InformationWe Collect Automatically\"). We may also receive information about you from third-party sources (as described below under \"Information Received from Third-Party Sources\"). The types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether you are signed up as a teacher, school leader, school admin, parent, student or Outside School Child User and how you use ClassDojo (e.g., if teachers join their school, we may need to collect school address information). We have also created this chart with the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we disclose personal information for a business purpose.\n\nBasically,\n\nClassDojo asks for some information directly from teachers, school leaders, parents, Outside School Child Users and students (such as account information), and also collects some information automatically (such as crash reports when errors occur) in order to provide you with the best possible ClassDojo experience. Please see this chart for the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we disclose personal information for a business purpose.\n\nInformation You Provide To Us\n\nWe ask for and collect the following personal information about you when you use the Service. When we act as a Controller, this information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, for our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service, and to allow us to comply with our legal obligations. Without it, we may not be able to provide you with all the requested services. Our use of the information set forth below is described in the section \"How Does ClassDojo Use the Information it Collects\"\n\nThere are currently six categories of users on our Service: teachers, school leaders, verified members of the school staff (\"school admins\") parents, students, and Outside School Child Users. Additionally, as a non-logged-in visitor to the ClassDojo Website, you may provide personal information to us as set forth in our separate ClassDojo Website Privacy Policy. We describe the information collected from students and Outside School Child Users in the \"How We Protect Children's Personal Information\" section above; for other users, we collect and store the following types of information from each type of user:\n\nAccount Sign-up and Profile Information: To create a ClassDojo account as a teacher, school leader, school admin or parent, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, password, relationship to a child (e.g parent, grandparent), and an optional profile photo. You may also choose to sign up through an Authentication Service. If a student's teacher is creating the Student Account on behalf of the student, they will provide the student's name, grade (unless the student was previously created at the school). This same information is also used to create the Student Account on the parent's behalf (the parent does not currently need to provide any additional personal information of their child if a parent is connected to the child with the unique parent code). If the parent is creating their child's account and is not connected to their child's school (e.g the Outside School Child Account), they may provide additional information about their child (such as first and last name). Teacher, school leader, school admin and parent profiles may be viewed by other teachers, school leaders and school admin in the same school as well as parents connected to the school or class; however, no parent, or student or Outside School Child Account profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service.\n\nSchool Information and Collaboration Features: If you are a teacher, school leader, or school admin, as part of the profile information you provide, you may choose to associate your account with an existing school or may enter a new school name and possibly your school's address if we do not have it already. If you are using the Service as a teacher, school leader, school admin or parent, we may ask you for permission to collect and store your precise geolocation information to help us identify schools located nearby for you, including to help connect your parent account to your child's school (e.g., our \"Find a Teacher\" feature). This location data is only temporarily captured and not stored beyond the initial search request for schools near the user and is not viewable by other users. By connecting you to your school and verifying your position, the Service may enable and provide additional collaboration features for teachers, school admin and School Leaders within the same school (and parents of children at that school) such as adding photos, videos, and text updates on Class Story or School Story for parents, students and other verified teachers in that school to see. Learn more about our current collaboration features and what information may be collected and shared from teachers, school leaders, school admins, students and parents and who can view these stories here.\n\nClass Information and School Directory: As a teacher, school leader or school admin, you enter the grade level and the first and last names of the students in your class or school and may optionally enter their parents' email addresses or phone numbers in order to invite parents. Alternatively, teachers, school admins or school leaders can also upload a document or spreadsheet to the Service with the students' first and last names or choose students from the School Directory if they are already in a class of a verified teacher within the school. When verified teachers add new students to their class, those students are automatically added to the School Directory. If a teacher or school leader invites the student's parents, and the parents create accounts and connect to their child, the parents' email addresses are shown in the School Directory next to the student. The School Directory can only be viewed by verified teachers, school leaders and school admins. If a parent would like to have their email removed from the School Directory, they should reach out to their child's school or disconnect from their child. If the parent creates an account and connects to their child, their name and their child's first name and last initial, as added by a verified teacher, may also appear in the list of individuals others (including parents) in the school can message. Parents can choose to block certain individuals or opt out of Family Messaging if they don't want to be visible to others in the school. If a teacher opts to share the classes they set up on ClassDojo with other teachers or school leaders in their school or outside their school, such as teachers they co-teach with, then those teachers can also see that class's information, excluding parent-teacher messages which remain private between one parent and one teacher. Teachers outside of the school will not have access to the School Directory or see individuals outside of the class. When teachers or school leaders graduate a class, all students (along with their connected parent and their contact information) in the class get moved to a \"Graduated Students\" section in the School Directory. Teachers or school leaders can choose to remove them from the school at this point, after which they will no longer be visible to anyone in the school.\n\nInviting Others: As a teacher, school leader, or school admin, you can invite your students' parents or other teachers to join the Service, for example by providing their email address or phone number (to invite them via SMS) within ClassDojo. When a teacher, school leader, or school admin joins the school via an invite, they can see all students in the school's first and last names, their parents' first and last name and email address, and when the parent last logged in. When a parent seeks to join the class through the \"proactive parent flow\" or through a class link shared by a teacher, they will be able to see the first name and last initial) of some students in that class to help them select the right student to connect to. A parent will not be connected to the child through the proactive parent flow or class link until a verified teacher has approved the parent's connection request. See the FAQ for more information. As a parent, you can also invite others to join the Service, including to allow for sharing of your purchased Premium Features (once the family member has joined ClassDojo). We will collect and store the email and phone numbers you provide with these requests and will also treat this as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also ask you for access to the contacts on your mobile device to prevent you from having to enter contact information for those invitations you send through our application and may store these contacts from your address book. If these individuals would like to request deletion of their information, they may contact us directly at privacy@classdojo.com.\n\nSharing Content: As a teacher, parent, school admin, or school leader, you can share certain content (e.g., as a parent within Premium Features, or a teacher sharing a Class Invite Link)) by utilizing your own native mobile application functionality through the ClassDojo App, for example, by email or SMS or integrating with other applications on your device (e.g. WhatsApp). As a teacher, you may also choose to share a celebration screen stating that your class has 100% of parents connected directly to third party applications (such as Twitter). Students or Outside School Child Users cannot share content through native applications on the device.\n\nMessaging: As a teacher, school admin, or school leader, you can privately message with individual parents that have signed up for the Service, send one-way announcements to all connected parents in your school, or send group messages to connected parents in your school (which parents can respond to) through ClassDojo Messaging. Additionally, as a teacher, you can send messages to other teachers, school admins, and school leaders (\"Staff Messaging\"). As a parent, you can also message with your child's teacher through ClassDojo Messaging.\n\nParents can also message other parents connected to their child's school through Family Messaging. When a parent sends a message through Family Messaging, this is not considered part of the Service that is offered to schools, and may contain messages and other content not related to the school (e.g. organizing play dates). Please see our FAQ for more details, including the controls available to parents such as opting out of Family Messaging. Please note that while it is a parent's choice to participate in Family Messaging, they are automatically added to the list of available individuals that may be contacted by other parents and users and will need to opt-out or choose other available options, such as \"blocking\" certain individuals.\n\nAs a teacher, school leader, school admin, or parent, your first and last name (or last initial only if you choose) and profile photo and your child's first name and last initial may be displayed to the people with whom you are messaging, including through ClassDojo Messaging and Family Messaging. If you are a teacher or school leader, you may receive a 'read receipt' showing which parents have read your message and in what language. Additionally, parents may elect to turn on a Premium Feature that allows them to know if a teacher has read their messages and may similarly receive a 'read receipt' telling them the teacher has read the message.\n\nWe will collect and store messages from ClassDojo Messaging, and Family Messaging, and any content sent with the messages (e.g., photos or videos), to provide the Service, and for ClassDojo Messaging, to help teachers, school admin, and school leaders keep a log of their communications with parents. For more information on how long these are retained, please see here.\n\nPlease be aware that by using ClassDojo Messaging or Family Messaging, any messages, photos, videos or other content shared can be viewed by all parents, and teachers and school leaders that are part of that message.\n\nIn the case that a photo or video is shared through ClassDojo Messaging showing a student who does not want photos taken of him/her (or whose parent does not want photos taken of him/her), or if any user needs to otherwise report any abuse or inappropriate content sent through ClassDojo Messaging that has not been addressed by the connected teacher or school, they may do so by using the reporting mechanism within the Service or emailing us at safety@classdojo.com. Please note that ClassDojo may not be able to remove certain content as the content may be deemed an \"education record\" under FERPA or any applicable law (including in international jurisdictions). If a photo or video is considered an \"education record\" you will need to first contact your child's school to request removal. For more information on when photos or videos are considered an \"education record\" please see the Department of Education's guidance here. In addition, if a user needs to report any abuse or inappropriate content sent through Family Messaging, they may do so using the reporting mechanism within the application directly, or by emailing us at safety@classdojo.com. Note that these reports within Family Messaging will not go to the school first.\n\nStories: As a teacher, school admin, or school leader, you can post text, photos, videos, or files to connected families in your class or school through Class Story or School Story. Parents can react to or comment on these posts. For a list of what students can do and what information we collect on a Class Story or School Story, please see our Children's Privacy Policy. Teachers, school admins, or school leaders will be able to see who has viewed these posts. Teachers', school admins', and school leaders' profile pictures and last name will be visible to others if they post or comment on Class or School Story. If parents comment or like a post, their profile pictures and child's first name and last initial will be visible to others who view Class Story or School Story posts. If students comment on a story post, their monster avatar, first name and last initial will be visible.We will collect and store the content from Class Stories and School Stories, including any photos or videos, to provide the Service, and to help teachers and school leaders keep a log of their communications with parents. For more information on how long these are retained, please see here.\n\nPlease be aware that by using Class Story or School Story, any posts, photos, videos, comments or other content shared can be viewed by all parents, students (whose parents have provided verifiable parental consent to ClassDojo or the student's teacher has represented they have provided any necessary parental consent), and teachers and school leaders that are members of that class or school, respectively. In the case that a photo or video is shared in a Class Story or School Story showing a student who does not want photos taken of him/her (or whose parent does not want photos taken of him/her), or if any user needs to otherwise report any abuse or inappropriate content on a Class Story or School Story that has not been addressed by the connected teacher or school, they may do so by emailing at safety@classdojo.com to request removal, subject to any photo or record being deemed an \"education record\" under FERPA or any applicable law. If a photo or video is considered an \"education record\" you will need to first contact your child's school to request removal. For more information on when photos or videos are considered an \"education record\" please see the Department of Education's guidance here.\n\nSchool Calendar and Events: Teachers, school admins, and School Leaders can create school or class events using the native ClassDojo calendar function which will capture information such as date, time, the name of the event and event details the teacher inputs as well as any photo or image used for the theme of the event. The calendar event will be shown to any School Leaders, teachers, school admins and parents connected to that teacher's class or school in their Class or School Story feeds. Teachers will be able to see a 'read receipt' telling them who has viewed the event. The teacher may also opt to send reminders to parents about the events.\n\nPortfolio Comments: Teachers can add Portfolio Comments to their students' portfolio content (including prior to any content being shown to the student's parent). Once the teacher has approved the student-uploaded Portfolio post, the Portfolio Comments will then be viewable to the child's parent (but may have been edited by the student or teacher prior to being shown to the parent). Prior to this approval, any Portfolio Comments between the teacher and the student can't be viewed by the student's parent, but any connected parent will receive a notice indicating that the Portfolio Comments feature is being utilized by their child's teacher and can discuss the use of Portfolio Comments with their child's teacher.\n\nUser Generated Content (photos, videos, photographs, documents or audio files): Teachers, school admin, school leaders and parents may upload photos, videos, and other content, including content that may contain personal information and can be viewed by others, on the Service, for example, on Class Story or School Story, through Class Dojo Messaging, Family Messaging, Portfolio Comments and Premium Features. Learn more about what information may be collected and shared from teachers, school leaders, students, and parents through Class Stories and School Stories and who can view these stories here. Additionally, teachers can post Activities on ClassDojo. Once a teacher publishes such Activities, they can be viewed by their students, other teachers connected to their class, and by other teachers that ClassDojo may share with pursuant to the Terms of Service (unless a teacher opts-out), but they will not be viewable by the general public. Parents can also download certain content from a Class Story or School Story or access advanced reporting and additional downloads, by purchasing our Premium Features, but must first confirm that they are giving us consent to use any content that might be deemed an \"education record\" or \"Student Data\" in this manner. Please see our FAQ for more information.\n\nPoints:\n\nFeedback Points â School\n\nAs a teacher, school admin, or school leader, you can customize a list of feedback types that you want to encourage or recognize using Feedback Points, such as persistence, teamwork, or leadership. These Feedback Points cannot be viewed by the general public through our Service. A student's Feedback Points and any notes the teacher adds about the point, can only be viewed on ClassDojo by that student, the teacher who awarded them, that student's connected parent account(s) (if the teacher has elected to show them to the parent), and other teachers or school leaders the class is shared with. If the teacher chooses to display totals to the class, other students in the class may be able to see each other's aggregated totals (but not individual Feedback Points). We may also present aggregate summaries (e.g. of total percentage) of Feedback Points awarded by the teacher along with any photos from a Class Story or School Story to parents. As an added privacy measure to protect students, the ClassDojo platform automatically sets limits on how long Feedback Points are retained. For all students, Feedback Points older than 12 months are automatically deleted on a rolling 12-month basis. For example, if a teacher sets up a class on ClassDojo on January 1, 2023, any Classroom Feedback Points given in that class on or before January 1, 2023, would be deleted by January 1, 2024 (and no longer viewable by any ClassDojo user). This means that Feedback Points cannot exist long-term. Teachers can also delete Feedback Points at any time.\n\nHome Points\n\nParents are given a limited number of Home Points for use at home but can also choose to customize and award additional Home Points to their children through the Premium Features functionality. The Home Points may be combined with the Feedback Points earned in school for a combined points total. These Home Points are only viewable by the connected parent account(s) and the child using their Outside School Child Account and are not viewable by the child's teacher or other students. Additionally, parents can give a Home Point when they see that the child has received a Feedback Point from school to celebrate them (\"Applause\").\n\nRewards and Skills: Within Premium Features, parents can create skills or edit the set of skills provided (\"Skills\"). Parents can give Home Points for a specific skill and award a reward (\"Rewards\") by redeeming the Home Points their child has earned. Parents can also create and edit the set of Rewards with Premium Features. Additionally, parents can set a \"Goal\" for a specific Skill and award Home Points to contribute towards that goal. Rewards and Skills given at home can only be accessed through the parent account or the child's Outside School Child Account; teachers and other students are not able to see these Rewards or Skills or to contribute points to them.\n\nSchoolwide Center: Teachers, school admin, and school leaders with a ClassDojo account and verified in a school can express interest in using ClassDojo schoolwide (e.g., by clicking the \"I'm interested\" button in the Schoolwide Center). Certain information may be provided to ClassDojo by the teacher, school admin, or school leader, such as the interest, name, and the number of teachers at their school. This information is also made available to other teachers, school admins, and school leaders verified in the school and is used by ClassDojo to provide extra services (such as early access to new products or swag), and support regarding the Services in product and through email.You can learn more here\n\nBilling and Payment Information : As a parent, when you purchase any Premium Features, you will first need to have your own parent account. You will then be required to use either your Apple ID, Google Account, or other payment method to purchase the Premium Features. Prior to allowing your child (or children) access to the Premium Features within their Outside School Child Account (or if any children's personal information, educational records or Student Data are utilized in the Premium Features that previously relied on \"school consent\"), we will also require parental consent. Please see our FAQ for more information. We do not collect any credit card information directly from parents to purchase Premium Features, however we may receive, from our payment processor, the last four digits of your credit card to search for specific transactions in case we want to issue a refund or other related customer support assistance. Please see here for a list of what information we receive from third-parties in connection with your payment method as well as what purchase events and analytics we track through our service providers in connection with your purchases. These purchase events and analytics are collected for internal analysis on product usage and purchase. We may also use it to track purchases that you did not make, and for sending push and email notifications to a parent's email or device to encourage them to take actions within the Service (such as finalizing a purchase). Parents may also share their Premium Features subscription with other parents through their account settings. Please see here for more information on sharing your Premium Features subscription.\n\nDojo Islands : Teachers may choose to allow their students through the use of their Student Account to access and play on their School Dojo Island. For more information on how teachers can turn their School Dojo Island or off, see here. Students can explore the School Island, build, and play certain games within the School Dojo Island. Additionally, children can play on their Home Dojo Island using their Outside School Child Account. Please see our Children's Privacy Policy for more information on what data is collected from students when using their Home or School Dojo Island. Please see our FAQfor what information is shared between the Home Dojo Island and a School Dojo Island. Teachers can also participate on the School Island.\n\nSurveys: Your responses to surveys that we or our service providers might ask you to complete for internal research purposes and product improvement. These surveys may also ask for your name and email as well as other free form and multiple-choice fields. We may also ask parents or teachers survey questions about their usage, opinions of or familiarity with ClassDojo features we are working on or considering as input into improving the product. We will not collect survey information of Student or Outside School Child Users under 13.\n\nTestimonials: We may collect certain personal information (such as your name, photo, and/or video) if you choose to give us a testimonial. We post testimonials on our Service which may contain this personal information in the testimonial. We obtain the individual's consent in advance to ensure we have permission to post this content publicly. To request the removal of your personal information from our testimonials, please contact us at privacy@classdojo.com.\n\nConduct and Safety Information: If a user reports another user on the Service (e.g. such as through a \"report abuse\" button) for conduct or safety issues, ClassDojo collects the information provided in the report (e.g. the username, the content being reported, the reason for reporting) to investigate the report.\n\nContact Information and Correspondence with ClassDojo: As a user of the Service, you may choose to provide us with your personal information, such as a name, email address, and telephone number. Some examples include when you send us an email asking a question, communicate with customer support, participate in a video testimonial about our Service, or choose to participate in any research efforts, including a customer feedback session with ClassDojo to improve the Service. We collect records and copies of your correspondence (including email address and messages) when contacting us for support. When you send us a message using the \"Contact Us\" page or via email, the email addresses and phone numbers collected are not further used to market to the individual beyond providing the services requested or responding to the requests.\n\nIf you are using the ClassDojo App, we may ask you for certain permissions â please see here for more detail about those permissions. We have also prepared this chart of the personal information we collect, how we use it, and where it is stored.\n\nBasically,\n\nWe ask you for different types of information based on who you are (i.e., teacher, school leader, parent, student, or Outside School Child User) and which ClassDojo features you use (e.g., sending a message between a teacher and a parent, or helping a teacher or parent join their school). We have also prepared this chart of the personal information we collect, how we use it, and where it is stored.\n\nInformation We Collect Automatically\n\nWhen you use the Service, we (or our service providers) may use various technologies that automatically record or collect certain information, including personal information, from your browser or your device about the services you use and how you use them. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, to enable us to comply with legal obligations and given our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service. For example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to ClassDojo (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show). If you use ClassDojo on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices. If we combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy.\n\nThe technologies and information we automatically collect include:\n\nCookies and other similar technologies: We (or our service providers) may use cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. We (or our service providers) may also use these technologies (never in Student or Outside School Child User logged in areas of our Service) in connection with advertising of our Service that may appear on other sites or in connection with advertising their products outside of our Service (e.g., if you view an embedded YouTube video player on our Service, YouTube may place cookies or similar technologies on your browser when you play the video off our site). We don't allow these third-parties to advertise directly on our Service (i.e. such as when an advertiser would bid to place an advertisement directly on a platform such as Facebook), but we may serve contextually relevant advertising for third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to you (e.g., our co-created content with Yale University on Mindfulness). Please read our Online Tracking Technologies Policy for more details, including how to modify your cookie settings and a list of the tracking technologies we use.\n\nLocal storage : We may also use, collect, and store information and preferences locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser-based web storage (including HTTP cookies and HTML5) and application data caches.\n\nLike many services, ClassDojo (or our service providers) uses both local storage and cookies and other similar technologies to analyze trends, gather demographic information about our users, understand your engagement with the Service, administer the Service, tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you -âfor example, by remembering your language preferences or other information so that you will not have to re-enter it during the next time you visit the Services. Please read our Online Tracking Technologies Policy for more details.\n\nDevice information: We collect device-specific information such as your device type, device brand, operating system, hardware version and settings, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers (including unique device IDs). We may also collect device event information such as crashes, system activity, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL. This helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve ClassDojo for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you've opted in to receive them.\n\nMobile application information: Certain mobile applications or \"apps\" include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to ClassDojo when you install or uninstall that application, such as when you install the ClassDojo App, when you open the application, or when that application periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. Additionally, we may receive application state and crash log information which will help us debug and improve the ClassDojo App.\n\nServer log information: Like most online services, when you use our Service we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs. Examples include things like:\n\nTelephone log information like your phone number and SMS routing information\n\nIP address\n\nDetails of how you used our Service, such as your activity on the Service (including product event data used to track progress or user activity), and the frequency and duration of your visits to the Service (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show)\n\nThis information helps us make decisions about what we should work on next -â for example, by showing which features are most (or least!) popular and to send notifications to a device (such as push notifications if the user opted in) to encourage the user to finish an activity or start the next activity. We may use your IP address and share it with third parties to help diagnose problems with our servers, for security purposes, to manage the Service, to enhance the Services based on usage pattern data and for analytics and for advertising. Third party sharing of IP address information for analytics and advertising is not allowed for student and Outside School Child Users. We automatically delete IP address tracked in server logs after six months.\n\nLocation information: When you use our Service, we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example, based on your IP address. We collect both coarse (i.e., city-level) location data and precise location data. If we request precise geolocation information (\"precise\" meaning sufficient to identify street name and name of city or town) from you (such as when a teacher or parent is searching for a school), we ask for your explicit opt-in permission. We never request precise geolocation data from students or Outside School Child Users. From all users, if they upload photos or videos from their computer, or from their phone camera roll directly, as opposed to choosing to use ClassDojo's own application camera, we collect what the device sends us. If the device sends us Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF data) (metadata contained within the image file -âe.g. camera model, lighting conditions, and location (if enabled)) this can contain location data (and may contain precise location data). We strip all EXIF data, including the location information, from the photo before it is viewed by other users (e.g., the person receiving a message). If a user accesses and uses our mobile camera within the application itself, the camera has been configured so as to not collect any EXIF data, therefore the EXIF information is not stored (as opposed to if you use your device's own camera roll).\n\nWe will not store or track your precise device location on an ongoing basis or without your permission. We do not share precise geolocation data with third-parties, other than our service providers as necessary to provide the Service. If you no longer wish to allow us to track your precise location information, you may opt-out at any time by turning it off at the device level.\n\nCross-device collection: To provide users with a seamless online experience, we may link your identifiers on different browsers and environments you are using, such as with our syncing technology, DojoCast. We may also work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.\n\nProduct events: As users interact with the product, we collect product events about how the product is being used (e.g., the number of points given, which reports are viewed, which features are used, which buttons are clicked, load time, etc.). These are collected to provide the Services, including for internal analysis on product usage and quality. We may also use it to track progress in the Service, and for sending push or email notifications to the parent's, teacher's, or student's device to encourage them to take certain actions in the ClassDojo Service. Our product event logs may also include unique device IDs and IP addresses. We automatically delete IP addresses tracked in product logs after six months.\n\nBasically,\n\nWe collect some information from you automatically (and additionally use cookies and other similar technologies to collect information) so that we know when things go wrong, or to help us understand what parts of ClassDojo need some improvement. If we need to request street-level (\"precise\") geolocation data from you as a teacher, school leader, or parent, we'll ask for your explicit, opt-in consent. We never request precise geolocation data from students.\n\nInformation Received from Third Party Sources\n\nWe may also obtain information, including personal information, from third-party sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically. This may include aggregated anonymous information or certain personal information that may be provided to us (e.g. survey information or information about the name of teachers and address of schools). If we receive personal information from third-parties, we will handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we directly combine information we receive from other third-parties with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information and handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Additionally, we may use any aggregated anonymous information received by third-parties as set forth below under the heading \"Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information\". Local law may require you to authorize the third-party to share your information with us before we can acquire it. We do not control, supervise, or respond to how third parties providing your information process your personal information, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed to such third-parties. Please see this chart with the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we disclose personal information for a business purpose.\n\nBasically,\n\nWe may collect some information from third-party sources, such as SurveyMonkey when we send questionnaires to teachers and parents. That information will be handled under this Privacy Policy. Please see this chart with the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we disclose personal information for a business purpose.\n\nWe try to be transparent about what information we collect so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used.
