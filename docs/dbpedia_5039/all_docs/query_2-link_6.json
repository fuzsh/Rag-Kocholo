Choose Keyword to search for photos that have a specific keyword associated with them. Or choose Title or Date to find photos with a specific title or that were taken on a specific date.\n\nChoose a defining relationship (or operator) for the condition: Choose an item from the condition’s second pop-up menu. For example, you can specify that a photo “is” or “is not” a selfie or video. Each category has its own modifiers that you can choose. For example, when you choose the Person category, you can specify that the photo “includes” or “doesn’t include” specific names, or that the person’s name “starts with” a specific set of characters, such as “Jo,” to find people named Jon, Jonathan, Jones, and so on.\n\nSet criteria for the condition: In the third pop-up menu or field, choose or enter the specific criteria you want the condition to use, such as a name or date. For example, choose “favorite” to search for photos you’ve marked as favorites.\n\nAdd or remove a condition: Click the Add button or the Remove button .\n\nSpecify whether items must meet any of the criteria or all of the criteria: If your search criteria include more than one condition, choose an item from the Match pop-up menu. To include items that match any one of the conditions, choose “any.” To include only items that match all of the conditions, choose “all.”"
