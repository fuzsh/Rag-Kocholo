        "text": "SunPass is Florida’s Prepaid Toll Program and is the preferred method of payment for tolls. When a vehicle equipped with an active, properly mounted SunPass or any other Florida accepted transponder goes through an electronic toll location, the transponder sends a signal to the tolling equipment, and the correct toll amount is then deducted from the customer’s prepaid account. SunPass customers always pay the lowest toll amount available on Florida’s toll roads and bridges.\n\nIf a vehicle that is not equipped with SunPass, or any other Florida accepted transponder, goes through an electronic toll location, the cameras take a photo of the vehicle’s license plate, and the transaction will be automatically converted to TOLL-BY-PLATE. A Toll Enforcement Invoice for the toll(s) is then mailed to the registered owner of the vehicle, including a $2.50 administrative charge.\n\nWhere is Electronic Toll Collection used?\n\nThe map below displays toll road and bridge locations in Florida. Electronic toll collection locations are shown in orange. A list of all locations can also be found beneath the map.\n\nThe following transponders are accepted in electronic toll collection lanes: SunPass, E-PASS, E-ZPass, LeeWay, Peach Pass and NC Quick Pass, PIKEPASS, K-TAG, and TollTag. Cash is not accepted at these locations. You will be billed by TOLL-BY-PLATE."
