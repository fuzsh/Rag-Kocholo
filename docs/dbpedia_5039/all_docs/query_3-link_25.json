If you think a debt collector failed to give you this information, you can submit a complaint with the CFPB.\n\nDisputing a debt\n\nOnce you receive the debt validation information, you have 30 days to dispute the debt in writing. Failing to request verification in writing or within this time period can affect your ability to assert your rights under the debt collection rule.\n\nAlso, if you send the debt collector the written verification request or request for information about the original creditor within this 30-day period, the debt collector must pause collecting the amount of the debt you are disputing until they’ve adequately responded to your request.\n\nIf you’re being contacted by a debt collector, you have rights and protections under federal law, and the rights and protections apply to how and when they can contact you. Learn more about your debt collection protections.\n\nLearn more about debt collection.\n\nStill having trouble with debt collection?\n\nCompanies can usually answer questions unique to your situation and more specific to the products and services they offer. If you have a complaint, tell us about your issue—we’ll forward your issue to the company, give you a tracking number, and keep you updated on the status of your complaint."
