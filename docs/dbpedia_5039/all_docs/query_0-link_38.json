        "text": "I recently upgraded my Dropbox to have the capacity to store all the photos that have been living on my iPhone. I connected to DropBox and have had 2 issues:\n\n1) Though my phone (which I got in 2017) has photos going all the way back to 2010, it only uploads photos going back to 2017. I think (but am not yet certain) that it's only syncing the photos that were taken on this phone.\n\n2) Every time I plug in the phone it uploads more photos - but all from the same 2017-2019 period. Each time I leave the phone plugged in until it quits uploading. So I'm not sure if the photos are i) re-uploading, ii) uploading in a different format (JPG vs. HEIC), iii) not uploading (i.e., the messages are false - which I think is unlikely), or iv) that some photos have been missed in the past upload.\n\nLet me know if you have any guidance... I tooled around the past questions but my Dropbox app (which I just downloaded onto my phone) is different than the one described in some of the older responses.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n/A\n\nNo, that won't be necessary @Aurelioaustria - just thanks for letting us know what did the trick for you after all!\n\nI'm happy to hear you managed to resolve your concern by toggling the Camera Uploads switch to off and on again.\n\nShould you ever come up with a Dropbox question or an issue, don't hesitate to let us know; we're always a post away\n\nHave a lovely day!\n\nWalter\n\nCommunity Moderator @ Dropbox\n\ndropbox.com/support\n\nDid this post help you?

You can find a link to update it if needed here:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/mobile?trigger=on\n\nShould the matter at hand persist, please try to clear the cache on your app and then sign out and back into your Dropbox account.\n\nOn iOS:\n\nTo clear your cache, please follow the steps listed below:\n\n1. Navigate to the “Personal” tab\n\n2. Tap the gear icon in the upper-left corner of the screen\n\n3. Select “Clear Cache”\n\nOn Android:\n\n1. Tap the menu icon in the upper-left corner of the screen\n\n2. Select \"Settings\"\n\n3. Select “Clear Cache”\n\nOnce this is done then please ensure you log out of the Dropbox application, then restart your device and log back in again.\n\nOn a last note, I removed your email address for your post for security purposes. If you'd like account specific assistance, you can go ahead and log a ticket with our team and they'll do their best to assist you: https://www.dropbox.com/support\n\nIn any case, please let me know what you find and we'll take it from there.\n\nWalter\n\nCommunity Moderator @ Dropbox\n\ndropbox.com/support\n\nDid this post help you?

There is some improvement on the speed, I now have my phone plugged into my PC and it keeps the App open and things seem to be happening. However, it isn't very fast. I thought perhaps by connecting my phone to the PC and downloading the Dropbox app to the PC there would be a quicker way to transfer files immediately, but seems not. So, i have the upload camera toggle on the App on my iPhone going and it is just cycling through and doing what it's doing. But it's uploading over wifi to the iPhone dropbox app, not via the PC connection. Not sure if there was somehow a better way to do this than one by one over wifi?\n\nThanks for the quick response @MeraaiKraai -most appreeciated!\n\nIf you're indeed using the desktop app to upload your photos from your iPhone, you should change your bandwidth settings according to your needs. You can do this following the steps outlined in the Help Center article below:\n\nhttps://help.dropbox.com/installs-integrations/sync-uploads/faster-sync\n\nAlso, can you send a screenshot of your iCloud Photo settings which you can find by opening the “Settings” app on your iPhone or iPad, then tapping “iCloud,” and then “Photos.”? (Note: These are settings for your device, not the Dropbox app.)\n\nIn addition, can you also send a screenshot of the Dropbox permissions settings? You can find this by opening the “Settings” app on your iPhone or iPad, and then tapping “Dropbox.” (Note: These are settings for your device, not the Dropbox app.)\n\nLast but not least, could you forward me the desktop app's exact status so I can have a better look into this?\n\nWalter\n\nCommunity Moderator @ Dropbox\n\ndropbox.com/support\n\nDid this post help you?
