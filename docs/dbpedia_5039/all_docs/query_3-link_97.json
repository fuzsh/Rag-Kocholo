        "text": "No bulk items will be collected unless the resident schedules collection online through 311 or calls (614) 645-3111.\n\nSome large items cannot be thrown away because they are too big to fit in your trash container. Residents should contact the City's 311 Customer Service Center to schedule bulk items by calling 311 or (614) 645-3111 , or online at our 311 page.\n\nBulk items include, but are not limited to:\n\nFurniture\n\nCarpet\n\nNon-refrigerant appliances\n\nMattresses\n\nDonate Items\n\nThe best option for disposing of large items in good condition is to give them to a friend or charitable organization. Franklin County's HandsOn Program (formerly FIRSTLINK) can provide referrals to organizations that will accept donations of old furniture, appliances or other items such as clothing and use them to help families in need. Many local churches will also take donated items and give them to needy families. Most central Ohio residents can reach HandsOn by dialing 211, others may call (614) 221-2255.\n\nArrange for Pickup\n\nUse the On-line Bulk-collection Scheduling Process\n\nThe City of Columbus will pick up many bulk items as a free service to its residents. The City can pick up furniture, mattresses, carpet, and appliances that do not have refrigerants in them, like dishwashers and washing machines. Bulk items should not be placed in your collection container.\n\nFollow these guidelines:\n\nTo schedule collection of bulk items, contact the City's 311 Service Center ((614) 645-3111) or 311.columbus.gov.\n\nIf your regular trash is picked up at the curb, place bulk items in front of your home away from obstructions on your specially scheduled collection day.\n\nIf your regular trash is picked up in an alley, place bulk items on the edge of your property at the alley line on your specially scheduled collection day.\n\nRoll carpet into a bundle 4 feet long by 2 feet in diameter and tie it with rope.\n\nLeave furniture assembled.\n\nGlass must be taped.\n\nResidents are responsible for cleaning up any glass residue that may remain on the ground in front of their home as a result of collection.\n\nBags, boxes, storage tubs, luggage and/or open containers of trash are not considered bulk. Bags and boxes of items must be placed inside your designated refuse container for collection. Plastic or metal trash cans/containers and storage tubs placed out with bulk collection must be empty and will be discarded.\n\nItems resulting from an eviction, set-out, or foreclosure will not be collected.\n\nUnacceptable Items\n\nSome items cannot be collected by the City of Columbus. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\nHazardous, flammable or explosive materials;\n\nAuto parts and tires;\n\nExcavating and building materials;\n\nRefrigerated appliances (refrigerators, freezers, dehumidifiers, heat pumps, water coolers and air conditioners);\n\nFurnaces, Pianos, Spas, Hot tubs or pool tables"
