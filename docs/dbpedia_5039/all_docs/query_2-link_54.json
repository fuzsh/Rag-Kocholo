If you communicate with others using direct messages, we collect the content of the message and the associated metadata (such as the time the message was sent, received and/or read, as well as the participants in the communication).

In submitting an objection request, please provide all relevant information, including the processing activity you are objecting to, why you want to object and how the processing activity affects you, and any additional information that you think will help us review your request. We will stop the particular processing if we don't have compelling legitimate grounds to continue that processing or donât need it for legal claims.\n\nRestrict the processing of your information. You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your information where (a) you are challenging the accuracy of the information, (b) the information has been unlawfully processed, but you are opposing the deletion of that information, (c) where you need the information to be retained for the pursuit or defence of a legal claim, or (d) you have objected to processing and you are awaiting the outcome of that objection request.\n\nTo exercise any of the above rights, please contact us through our webform. Before we can respond to a request to exercise one or more of the rights listed above, you may be required to verify your identity or your account details or provide additional information so that we can understand your request.\n\nWe encourage you to âContact usâ if you are not satisfied with how we have responded to any of your rights requests. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commission (TikTok Irelandâs lead supervisory authority) or with your local supervisory authority.\n\nIn addition to these rights, you can control privacy settings for your account. Click here for more information.\n\nData Security and Retention\n\nSecurity of your information is important to us. We maintain appropriate technical, administrative, and physical security measures that are designed to protect your information from unauthorised access, theft, disclosure, modification, or loss. We regularly review our security measures to consider available new technology and methods.\n\nWe retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Platform and for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We also retain information when necessary to comply with contractual and legal obligations, when we have a legitimate business interest to do so (such as improving and developing the Platform, and enhancing its safety, security and stability), and for the exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\nThe retention periods will be different depending on the type of information and the purposes for which we use the information. For example, when we process your information to provide you with the Platform, we keep this information for as long as you have an account. This information includes your Profile Information, User Content, and Direct Messages. If you violate our Guidelines or Terms, we may remove your Profile Information and/or User Content from public view immediately but keep your information as is necessary to process the violation.\n\nOur Global Operations and Data Transfers\n\nTo support our global operations:\n\nWe store the information described in the âWhat Information We Collectâ section in servers located in the United States, Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nCertain entities in our Corporate Group, located outside your country of residence (see here), are given limited remote access to this information so they can provide certain functions, as described in the Our Corporate Group section in âHow We Share Your Informationâ. This access is limited, secure and only granted where necessary under strict security controls and authorisation approval protocols.\n\nWe share âWhat Information We Collectâ with service providers, partners and other third party entities, as described in âHow We Share Your Informationâ. These third parties can be located outside your country of residence.\n\nThese entities commit to processing information in compliance with applicable privacy laws and to implementing appropriate security measures to protect your information.\n\nWhen we transfer your information outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:\n\nAdequacy decisions. These are decisions from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in âWhat Information We Collectâ to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed here; or\n\nStandard contractual clauses. The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in âWhat Information We Collectâ to certain entities in our Corporate Group (as described here) and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.\n\nFor a copy of these adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, please contact us via the details provided in the âContact usâ section below.\n\nYounger Users\n\nYou must be at least 13 years old to use the Platform. If you believe that there is a user who is below this minimum age, please contact us using this webform.\n\nTo provide users younger than 18 with an age-appropriate experience, certain features are not available. Further details are available in our Help Centre.\n\nIf you are the guardian of a teen, our Guardian's Guide contains information and resources to help you understand the Platform and the tools and controls you or your teen can use, including âFamily Pairingâ features.\n\nPrivacy Policy Updates\n\nWe may amend or update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes to this policy by a notice provided through the Platform or by other means. The âLast Updatedâ date at the top of this policy reflects the effective date of such policy changes.\n\nYou can contact us about this Privacy Policy through our webform. You can reach TikTok's Data Protection Officer here.\n\nYou can also contact us at the following postal address."
