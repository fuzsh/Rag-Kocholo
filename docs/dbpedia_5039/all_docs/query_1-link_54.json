        "text": "Do you live in California? Check out our California Privacy Statement, which supplements this Privacy Policy.\n\nResidents of Washington and Nevada, please see our Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy, which supplements this Privacy Policy.\n\n______\n\nHey there! Welcome to Hinge’s Privacy Policy.\n\nWe know reading a privacy policy might not be everyone’s idea of a good time, but hear us out. We put a lot of effort into making this policy as clear and engaging as possible, because we actually want you to read it! Think of us as your digital wingmate, here to guide you through the ins and outs of what data we collect, and why and how we use it. So get cozy, grab your beverage of choice, and let’s dive into the world of personal data together.\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies from July 1, 2024. The previous version, available here, applies until then.\n\nWho We Are\n\nWhere This Privacy Policy Applies\n\nData We Collect\n\nHow We Use Data\n\nHow We Share Data\n\nHow Match Group Companies Work Together\n\nCross-Border Data Transfers\n\nYour Rights\n\nHow Long We Retain Your Data\n\nChildren's Privacy\n\nPrivacy Policy Changes\n\nHow To Contact Us\n\n1. Who We Are\n\nIf you live in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom or Switzerland, the company responsible for your data (the “data controller”) is:\n\nMTCH Technology Services LimitedHinge\n\n1 Hatch Street Upper\n\nDublin 2\n\nDublin\n\nD02 PY28\n\nIreland\n\nIf you live outside the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the company responsible for your data is:\n\nHinge, Inc.\n\n809 Washington Street, Third Floor\n\nNew York, NY 10014\n\nUnited States\n\n2. Where This Privacy Policy Applies\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services we operate under the Hinge brand. Whether you're searching for your soulmate, joining us at one of our events, or using any of our other awesome services, this Policy has got you covered. For simplicity, we just refer to all of these as our “service” in this Privacy Policy.\n\nIf for some reason, one of our services requires its own separate privacy policy, then that policy will be made available to you and that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- will apply.\n\n3. Data We Collect\n\nIt goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without you providing some information about yourself, like basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. Using our service also generates some information, such as when you logged in and how you used the service. We may also collect data from third parties, like when you access the service through an account you have on another platform (e.g., Facebook, Google or Apple) or when you upload information from your account on another platform to complete your profile. If you're interested in all the details, be sure to check out the table below.\n\n4. Why and How We Use Your Data\n\nThe main reason we process your data is to provide our service to you and improve it over time. That includes connecting you with members who might make your heart skip a beat, personalizing your experience, and just helping you make the most of our service. We also process your data to keep you and all of our members safe and secure while using our service. We take this responsibility very seriously and we’re always working to improve our systems and processes to help protect you. And yes, we process your data to show relevant ads – you can control this in your settings. Read on for a more detailed explanation.\n\nFor information on how we process personal data through “profiling” and “automated decision-making”, please see our FAQ.\n\n5. How We Share Data\n\nSince our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, some of your information is of course visible to other members on the service. We also share data with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the service, with other Match Group companies for the reasons laid out below and, in some cases, for legal and related reasons. Read on for more details.\n\n6. How Match Group Companies Work Together\n\nHinge is part of the Match Group family of businesses.\n\nWe may share data about you with our Affiliates and they may share data about you with us, for the reasons laid out below:\n\nTo make all Match Group platforms safer, for instance by making sure that when a bad actor is found on one Match Group platform (for instance ours), they can be banned from all.\n\nTo assist each other in data processing operations, as service providers. This assistance may include processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, analytics, finance and accounting, legal support, payment processing, service improvement, data security and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud and other wrongdoings.\n\nTo improve your chances at building significant connections with others, we may make you visible on other Match Group services or allow you to benefit from cross-platform functionalities. We will of course comply with applicable law and, where relevant, notify you of any such opportunity and allow you to agree or to refuse.\n\nWhere and as allowed under applicable law, to better understand how people use Match Group services overall, to personalize your experience across Match Group services and to enhance marketing and advertising campaigns.\n\nFor other legitimate business purposes including corporate / consolidated audit, analysis and reporting.\n\nLearn more about how Match Group companies work together.\n\n7. Cross-Border Data Transfers\n\nBecause we operate a global service, the sharing of your data laid out in Section 5 involves cross-border data transfers to the United States of America and other countries that may have different laws about data processing. When we transfer personal data outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or other countries whose data protection laws have been deemed adequate by the European Commission or other competent governmental bodies, we typically rely on what are called standard contract clauses. These standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data. Contact us for a copy.\n\n8. Your Rights\n\nWe want you to be in control of your data, so we want to remind you of the following rights, options and tools available to you. Depending on where you live, you may not have the same rights or they may be named differently. If you have any questions on your rights and how to exercise them, please contact us here.\n\nFor your protection and the protection of all of our members, we may ask you for information to verify your identity or authority to act on behalf of a member before we can answer the above requests. We wouldn’t want someone else to get in control of your data!\n\nKeep in mind, we may reject requests, including if we are unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid, or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy or other rights of someone else. If you wish to receive information relating to another member, such as a copy of any messages you received from them, the other member will have to make a request themselves.\n\nIf you are a resident of Texas, Oregon, Montana, Virginia, Colorado, or Connecticut, USA, if we deny your privacy request, you may be able to appeal by contacting us, and explicitly referencing “Privacy Request Appeal.” If you have concerns about the result of your appeal, you may contact the attorney general for your state.\n\nIn certain countries, including in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal data. You can find information about your data protection regulator in the European Economic Area here, and in the United Kingdom here. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where an alleged infringement took place.\n\n9. How Long We Retain Your Data\n\nWe want the connections you make through our service to last forever, but we keep your personal data only as long as necessary for legitimate business reasons (as laid out in Section 4) and as permitted by applicable law.\n\nIf you decide to stop using our service, you can close your account and your profile will no longer be visible to other members. Note that we will close your account automatically if you are inactive for two years.\n\nFollowing account closure, we delete your data as laid out below:\n\nTo protect the safety and security of our members, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account closure or up to two years following an account ban. During this period, we keep your data to investigate unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of data during this safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims.\n\nWe maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data for 10 years to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements, credit card information for the duration the user may challenge the transaction, and “traffic data” / logs for one year to comply with legal data retention obligations. We also keep records of consents members give us for five years to comply and evidence our compliance with applicable law.\n\nWe maintain limited data on the basis of our legitimate interest: we keep customer care records and supporting data as well as imprecise location of download/purchase for five years in support of our safety efforts, to support our customer care decisions, enforce our rights and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim, profile data for one year in anticipation of potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and data necessary to prevent members who were banned from opening a new account for as long as necessary to ensure the safety and vital interests of our members.\n\nFinally, we maintain data on the basis of our legitimate interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep data, in particular if we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings.\n\nWhere and as legally permitted, we may maintain and use data that, by itself, cannot identify or be attributed specifically to you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to improve our service and create new features, technologies, and services and keep Match Group services safe.\n\n10. Children's Privacy\n\nOur service is restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit individuals under the age of 18 on our platform. If you suspect that a member is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available on the service.\n\n11. Privacy Policy Changes\n\nThis policy may change over time. We’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections and strive to make sure explanations of our data practices remain up-to-date. We will notify you before material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.\n\n12.
