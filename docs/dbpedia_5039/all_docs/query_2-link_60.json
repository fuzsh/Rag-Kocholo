Works in the public domain may be freely used without permission of the former copyright holder.\n\nOther third-party rights, such as trademarks, patents, or the rights of publicity or privacy, may apply to a work in the public domain.\n\nConsult the U.S. Copyright Office, Cornell University, and Creative Commons Zero (CC0) for additional information on copyright and public-domain terms and definitions.\n\nCopyright and other laws throughout the world automatically extend copyright protection to works of authorship, software, and database content. Creative Commons Zero (CC0) gives those who want to give up those rights a way to do so, to the fullest extent allowed by law.\n\nOnce the creator or a subsequent owner of a work applies the CC0 license to a work, the work is no longer his or hers in any restrictive sense under copyright law and is instead considered to be in the public domain. Anyone can use the work in any way and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, subject to other laws and the rights others may have in the work or how the work is used. Think of CC0 as a \"no rights reserved\" option.\n\nCC0 does not affect the patent or trademark rights of any person affected by CC0, or the rights that other persons may have in the work, such as publicity or privacy rights.\n\nTo request an image not available on The Met's website or a higher-resolution version of an existing image, please use the Image Request Form to contact the Museum's image-licensing partner, Art Resource. Art Resource acts as the Museum's primary partner for the worldwide fulfillment of licensing requests. As the Museum's agent, Art Resource will provide (when possible) digital images made by Museum staff. A fee will be charged depending on the nature and type of the proposed use and the availability of photography of the images requested.\n\nAll requests for new photography are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Upon approval, additional fees may apply. New photography will require a minimum of six weeks. Please note that the Museum reserves the right to deny any request at its sole discretion.\n\nInstructions are included on the form, which goes directly to Art Resource once submitted.\n\nImages on the Museum's website are made available in a range of sizes and resolutions, and represent the evolution of digital imaging standards. The Museum is continuously creating and adding new high-quality images to the website, and many of these new images will be designated as Open Access. Most Open Access images will be suitable for most types of publication. Users are responsible for making their own assessment, and are advised to do so immediately after downloading the image (especially for print publication). The following guidelines are provided to assist users in making their image assessments:\n\nWhen determining the suitability of a digital image for reproduction in a print publication, there are several key factors to consider: resolution, pixel dimensions, and the intended size of the printed output. The following table provides some typical output sizes and the recommended dimensions for a publication-ready image at 150 ppi and 300 ppi—the most common resolutions for images available from the Museum's website.\n\nThough some images available via Open Access may not meet the requirements above, this does not necessarily preclude them from publication at smaller sizes. A useful formula in determining the maximum print size of any digital image is as follows:\n\nNote that image resolution is only a factor in determining print output. For digital purposes, the pixel dimensions of an image are the only measurements that determine display size.\n\nOA does not require any attribution or credit, but as an educational institution, the Museum hopes that you will include a citation. All the information necessary for proper citation of a CC0 image is available on the Collection page for that object.\n\nA sample object credit line format is as follows: \"The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York,\" followed by the specific information identified as the \"Credit Line\" on the Collection page for each work of art. The citation could also include the URL www.metmuseum.org.\n\nYou may not suggest or imply the Museum's endorsement of your publication or project, nor use the Museum's trademarks without permission. Consult the Terms and Conditions page for additional information."
