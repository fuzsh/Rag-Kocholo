Whether you like to apply changes that affect your photo's quality, feel, and look—or you want to add information on top of your photos, the Photos app in Windows gives you all kinds of options for getting your photos and videos looking their best.\n\nFor more information, view how to edit photos and videos in Windows.\n\nPhotos app provides you the ability to connect to OneDrive and access all the media located in OneDrive from the Photos app. To enable this functionality, you must Sign In/connect to OneDrive account from the Photos app.\n\nConnect to OneDrive from the Photos app:\n\nOpen Photos app by typing Photos in the start menu.\n\nGo to OneDrive tab in the left navigation bar.\n\nSelect the Sign in button to sign in to your OneDrive account. Provide the app permissions to access your info.\n\nNote: You can control whether OneDrive is connected to the Photos app under the Photos app’s settings.\n\nUpload the photos and videos from mobile to OneDrive automatically:\n\nOne of the simplest ways to copy all your photos and videos to one place in the Photos app is to set up automatic upload to OneDrive of Photos from your mobile device.\n\nEnsure that you're connected to OneDrive on the Microsoft Photos app. This allows OneDrive content to sync to the Photos app.\n\nThen, on your iOS or Android device, install the OneDrive app. You can download the latest version from your phone's Android or iOS app store.\n\nFrom the OneDrive app on your iOS or Android device, turn on Camera Upload in the OneDrive app’s settings. The latest photos and videos that you take will automatically start uploading to OneDrive.\n\nOnce uploaded to OneDrive, those photos and videos will automatically appear in the Photos app on your PC if you have OneDrive connected to your Photos app. For more information, see Sync files with OneDrive in Windows.\n\nPhotos app allows you to copy, move, remove or duplicate photos and videos. Here's how:\n\nCopying photos and videos: If you copy a photo, video, or folder in the Photos app, the content remains in its original location and a duplicate is added to the newly specified location.\n\nMoving photos and videos: If you move a photo, video, or folder in the Photos app, the content location on your device will also be moved. For example, the folder will no longer exist at its original location.\n\nRemove photos and videos: If you no longer want a photo, video, or folder to appear in Photos, you can remove it by right clicking (or select and hold) the item name in the left navigation bar. Removing a folder from the Photos app does not delete that folder’s contents from your Windows machine—it will just no longer be viewable within the Photos app.\n\nImportant:\n\nWhen you try to delete the OneDrive media files, they are sent to your Window’s recycle bin from the folder they came from on your Windows device. Deleted files are also sent to your OneDrive's recycle bin from your OneDrive account.\n\nDeleting the files from your iCloud Photos synced folder will also delete the files in iCloud.\n\nTo learn more about OneDrive delete policies, see Restore deleted files or folders in OneDrive.\n\nIf you accidentally delete an iCloud file and want to recover it, you may be able to do so for a limited period of time based on iCloud’s policies. See Delete and recover photos and videos on iCloud from Apple for more information.\n\nThe Photos app allows users to view their photos and videos seamlessly.
