        "text": "Collections let you gather related movies, TV shows, and artists or albums for music together. For example, you might add all the James Bond movies together in a “Bond” collection.\n\nCreating a Manual Collection\n\nYou can manually create a collection by adding a Collections tag to an item. Add other items to a collection by giving them the same collection tag. You do this from the library item’s Edit Details screen. To do this:\n\nOpen the Edit details screen for the item\n\nNavigate to the Tags tab on the left\n\nClick the Collections box\n\nIf the collection already exists, choose it from the list\n\nIf not, type the name and hit enter\n\nSave the changes\n\nRelated Page:\n\nYou can also add individual items to a collection by selecting individual items, or a the results of a filter, then from the Add To menu select Add to Collection and choose an existing collection, or create a new one. The existing collection tag will be added to the items. If you create a new one the title you give it will be added as a Collection tag to the items.\n\nCreating a Smart Collection\n\nRequirements:\n\nPlex Media Server 1.22.3 or newer\n\nPlex Web 4.56.3 or newer\n\nCreating a “smart” collection is much like creating a smart playlist:\n\nCreate a filter/sort based on the criteria you wish\n\nFrom the Add To button or Save As menu choose Save as Smart Collection.\n\nRelated Page: Using the Library View\n\nAny future items that meet the filter criteria will automatically be included and things which no longer meet the criteria will no longer be shown in the collection.\n\nSmart collections will have a gear icon on the top right of its poster to indicate it is a smart collection.\n\nFinding the Collections Within a Library\n\nCollections can be discovered or viewed in four main ways:\n\nFilter by the collection\n\nItem details/preplay screen\n\nViewing the library “By Collection”\n\nAdd as a recommendation row to your library or home screen\n\nInline and collapsed with other items when browsing a library\n\nFilter by Collection\n\nFiltering by collection leaves out all other items in your media list except the items in the collection. Note this is different from the “details” screen described later.\n\nItem Details/Preplay Screen\n\nWhen viewing the details/preplay screen for a specific item that belongs to a collection, the entire collection may be shown as “related” information on the screen. This is only applicable for movie and TV libraries.\n\nViewing the Library by Collections\n\nVia the Collections tab\n\nAdd as a Recommendation Row\n\nAs of Plex Media Server 1.22.3 a server owner can set a collection to appear as a row on the Home or library Recommended screens.\n\nRelated Page:\n\nCollapsed inline with other items in library\n\nThis is a library display option described in more detail below. They will only appear when the library is filtered by ALL and sorted by Title/Name. For TV libraries, it applies only to viewing the library by shows (and not episodes or seasons). Opening a collection goes to the “collection details page” screen (see below).\n\nCollection Inline library display options\n\nIt’s possible to “collapse” collections for TV and movie (including “Other Videos”) libraries so that an entry for the collection appears inline with other items when browsing your library. This can be set or changed on the Advanced tab when creating or editing the corresponding library.\n\nSetting options:\n\nDisabled: Don’t display collections inline at all, show items. Regardless of individual collections settings, they will only be shown in the libraries collection tab.\n\nHide items which are in collections: If an item belongs to a collection, do not show the item in the main library when browsing. Entries for collections are shown inline.\n\nShow collections and their items: Entries for collections are shown inline and items belonging to a collection also still appear in the main library when browsing.\n\nWhen enabled, these “inline collections” will only appear when the library is filtered by ALL and sorted by Title/Name. For TV libraries, it applies only when viewing the library by shows (sorted by title) and not episodes or seasons.\n\nRelated Page:\n\nCollections Details Page\n\nThe collections details page contains all the items in that library that belong to the collection. It can also include items from other libraries that are in a collection with the exact same name. By adding items in different libraries to identically-named collections, you can relate them to each other. For instance, you can have Star Wars movies, TV shows, and music albums all in a “Star Wars” collection so they’re related to each other.\n\nCustomizing Collections\n\nAfter creating a collection you will notice the collapsed collection has a poster with up to 4 images from items in that collection. You can edit the collection’s own metadata to add a custom poster, a summary, a background image (fanart), and (for manual collections) choose the sort order for the collection.\n\nOpen the web app\n\nIf you do not have collections displayed inline then switch to view by collections\n\nSelect the edit icon on when hovering on a collection poster or on its preplay screen\n\nMake edits as you see fit\n\nCustom Collection Order\n\nThe content of regular “dumb” collections can be reordered in any arbitrary way the server admin chooses.\n\nThis requires Plex Web App v4.61.2 or newer.\n\nWhen on the collection details page, the posters of items in the collection will have a drag handle on the top center when hovering over them. Simply drag-and-drop the items to the desired order. This is not available for “smart” collections, which are always ordered by the sort chosen when creating or editing the filter for the smart collection.\n\nDeleting a Collection\n\nIf you do not have collections displayed inline then switch to view by collections\n\nDelete the collection by clicking on the … menu on the collection poster or preplay screen and choosing Delete.\n\nThis will not delete the items in the collection. For manual collections, it will remove the collection tag from the corresponding items. Also, like with other media items, only the admin of the server can delete a collection.\n\nRelated Page:\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhere did all these extra collections come from? I didn’t add them.\n\nThere are three ways “automatic” collections can be made.\n\nYou may have enabled the Use collection info from The Movie Database metadata agent setting (for legacy agents). When enabled (it is disabled by default), that will try to gather collection information from The Movie Database. This may cause many unwanted collections to be automatically created, particularly collections where you only have one item. You can disable that preference in the server metadata agent settings for the “Plex Movie (Legacy)” and “The Movie Database” metadata agents. This will only prevent collections from getting automatically added to items added to your library in the future. It will not remove collections from existing library items.\n\nWhen using the current “Plex Movie” scanner/agent combo, you’ve set the Minimum automatic collection size preference for a library. You can set it to Disabled if you do not want it to automatically create collections. Again, the change only applies to future added items or metadata refreshes.\n\nIf you have MP4s with an embedded “Album” tag, the Local Media Assets agent may pick it up as a collection. Note that the Local Media agent also picks up external subtitles, extras, and other embedded metadata in MP4s (and other files), so be aware of this if you choose to disable the agent source.\n\nRelated Page:\n\nRelated Page:\n\nWhy are there collections with zero items?\n\nYou will find after removing all the collection tags from items, the collapsed collection itself remains, but with zero items in it. These are kept because you might have made customizations to the collection (artwork, a description, etc.). We don’t want automatically remove the collection, in case you were only temporarily emptying it before you add other items to it.\n\nIf you want to get rid of an empty collection, delete the collection as described above.\n\nCan I make a photo or music collection?\n\nCollection tags cannot be added to photos.\n\nYou can add music artists or albums to a collection. You’ll be able to filter by the collection as normal, but there are no “collection details page” screens in music libraries, nor will they appear “collapsed” inline when browsing the music library.\n\nIf you add an artist or album to a collection with the same name as a collection in a movie or TV library, the artist or album collection can appear as a related item in that movie or TV library collection preplay, as described earlier."
