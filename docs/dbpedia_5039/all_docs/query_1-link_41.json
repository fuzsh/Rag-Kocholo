        "text": "When we conduct qualitative methods of research, need to explain changes in metrics or understand people's opinions, we always turn to qualitative data.\n\nQualitative data is typically generated through:\n\nInterview transcripts\n\nSurveys with open-ended questions\n\nContact center transcripts\n\nTexts and documents\n\nAudio and video recordings\n\nObservational notes\n\nCompared to quantitative data, which captures structured information, qualitative data is unstructured and has more depth. It can answer our questions, can help formulate hypotheses and build understanding.\n\nIt's important to understand the differences between quantitative data & qualitative data.\n\nBut unfortunately, analyzing qualitative data is difficult. While tools like Excel, Tableau and PowerBI crunch and visualize quantitative data with ease, there are a limited number of mainstream tools for analyzing qualitative data. The majority of qualitative data analysis still happens manually.\n\nThat said, there are two new trends that are changing this. First, there are advances in natural language processing (NLP) which is focused on understanding human language. Second, there is an explosion of user-friendly software designed for both researchers and businesses. Both help automate the qualitative data analysis process.\n\nIn this post we want to teach you how to conduct a successful qualitative data analysis. There are two primary qualitative data analysis methods; manual & automatic. We will teach you how to conduct the analysis manually, and also, automatically using software solutions powered by NLP.\n\nWe’ll guide you through the steps to conduct a manual analysis, and look at what is involved and the role technology can play in automating this process.\n\nMore businesses are switching to fully-automated analysis of qualitative customer data because it is cheaper, faster, and just as accurate. Primarily, businesses purchase subscriptions to feedback analytics platforms so that they can understand customer pain points and sentiment.\n\nWe’ll take you through 5 steps to conduct a successful qualitative data analysis. Within each step we will highlight the key difference between the manual, and automated approach of qualitative researchers. Here's an overview of the steps:\n\nThe 5 steps to doing qualitative data analysis\n\nGathering and collecting your qualitative data\n\nOrganizing and connecting into your qualitative data\n\nCoding your qualitative data\n\nAnalyzing the qualitative data for insights\n\nReporting on the insights derived from your analysis\n\nWhat is Qualitative Data Analysis?\n\nQualitative data analysis is a process of gathering, structuring and interpreting qualitative data to understand what it represents.\n\nQualitative data is non-numerical and unstructured. Qualitative data generally refers to text, such as open-ended responses to survey questions or user interviews, but also includes audio, photos and video.\n\nBusinesses often perform qualitative data analysis on customer feedback. And within this context, qualitative data generally refers to verbatim text data collected from sources such as reviews, complaints, chat messages, support centre interactions, customer interviews, case notes or social media comments.\n\nHow is qualitative data analysis different from quantitative data analysis?\n\nUnderstanding the differences between quantitative & qualitative data is important. When it comes to analyzing data, Qualitative Data Analysis serves a very different role to Quantitative Data Analysis. But what sets them apart?\n\nQualitative Data Analysis dives into the stories hidden in non-numerical data such as interviews, open-ended survey answers, or notes from observations. It uncovers the ‘whys’ and ‘hows’ giving a deep understanding of people’s experiences and emotions.\n\nQuantitative Data Analysis on the other hand deals with numerical data, using statistics to measure differences, identify preferred options, and pinpoint root causes of issues. It steps back to address questions like \"how many\" or \"what percentage\" to offer broad insights we can apply to larger groups.\n\nIn short, Qualitative Data Analysis is like a microscope, helping us understand specific detail. Quantitative Data Analysis is like the telescope, giving us a broader perspective. Both are important, working together to decode data for different objectives.\n\nQualitative Data Analysis methods\n\nOnce all the data has been captured, there are a variety of analysis techniques available and the choice is determined by your specific research objectives and the kind of data you’ve gathered. Common qualitative data analysis methods include:\n\nContent Analysis\n\nThis is a popular approach to qualitative data analysis. Other qualitative analysis techniques may fit within the broad scope of content analysis. Thematic analysis is a part of the content analysis. Content analysis is used to identify the patterns that emerge from text, by grouping content into words, concepts, and themes. Content analysis is useful to quantify the relationship between all of the grouped content. The Columbia School of Public Health has a detailed breakdown of content analysis.\n\nNarrative Analysis\n\nNarrative analysis focuses on the stories people tell and the language they use to make sense of them. It is particularly useful in qualitative research methods where customer stories are used to get a deep understanding of customers’ perspectives on a specific issue. A narrative analysis might enable us to summarize the outcomes of a focused case study.\n\nDiscourse Analysis\n\nDiscourse analysis is used to get a thorough understanding of the political, cultural and power dynamics that exist in specific situations. The focus of discourse analysis here is on the way people express themselves in different social contexts. Discourse analysis is commonly used by brand strategists who hope to understand why a group of people feel the way they do about a brand or product.\n\nThematic Analysis\n\nThematic analysis is used to deduce the meaning behind the words people use. This is accomplished by discovering repeating themes in text. These meaningful themes reveal key insights into data and can be quantified, particularly when paired with sentiment analysis. Often, the outcome of thematic analysis is a code frame that captures themes in terms of codes, also called categories. So the process of thematic analysis is also referred to as “coding”. A common use-case for thematic analysis in companies is analysis of customer feedback.\n\nGrounded Theory\n\nGrounded theory is a useful approach when little is known about a subject. Grounded theory starts by formulating a theory around a single data case. This means that the theory is “grounded”. Grounded theory analysis is based on actual data, and not entirely speculative. Then additional cases can be examined to see if they are relevant and can add to the original grounded theory.\n\nChallenges of Qualitative Data Analysis\n\nWhile Qualitative Data Analysis offers rich insights, it comes with its challenges. Each unique QDA method has its unique hurdles. Let’s take a look at the challenges researchers and analysts might face, depending on the chosen method.\n\nTime and Effort (Narrative Analysis): Narrative analysis, which focuses on personal stories, demands patience. Sifting through lengthy narratives to find meaningful insights can be time-consuming, requires dedicated effort.\n\nBeing Objective (Grounded Theory): Grounded theory, building theories from data, faces the challenges of personal biases. Staying objective while interpreting data is crucial, ensuring conclusions are rooted in the data itself.\n\nComplexity (Thematic Analysis): Thematic analysis involves identifying themes within data, a process that can be intricate. Categorizing and understanding themes can be complex, especially when each piece of data varies in context and structure. Thematic Analysis software can simplify this process.\n\nGeneralizing Findings (Narrative Analysis): Narrative analysis, dealing with individual stories, makes drawing broad challenging. Extending findings from a single narrative to a broader context requires careful consideration.\n\nManaging Data (Thematic Analysis): Thematic analysis involves organizing and managing vast amounts of unstructured data, like interview transcripts. Managing this can be a hefty task, requiring effective data management strategies.\n\nSkill Level (Grounded Theory): Grounded theory demands specific skills to build theories from the ground up. Finding or training analysts with these skills poses a challenge, requiring investment in building expertise.\n\nBenefits of qualitative data analysis\n\nQualitative Data Analysis (QDA) is like a versatile toolkit, offering a tailored approach to understanding your data. The benefits it offers are as diverse as the methods. Let’s explore why choosing the right method matters.\n\nTailored Methods for Specific Needs: QDA isn't one-size-fits-all. Depending on your research objectives and the type of data at hand, different methods offer unique benefits. If you want emotive customer stories, narrative analysis paints a strong picture. When you want to explain a score, thematic analysis reveals insightful patterns\n\nFlexibility with Thematic Analysis: thematic analysis is like a chameleon in the toolkit of QDA. It adapts well to different types of data and research objectives, making it a top choice for any qualitative analysis.\n\nDeeper Understanding, Better Products: QDA helps you dive into people's thoughts and feelings. This deep understanding helps you build products and services that truly matches what people want, ensuring satisfied customers\n\nFinding the Unexpected: Qualitative data often reveals surprises that we miss in quantitative data. QDA offers us new ideas and perspectives, for insights we might otherwise miss.\n\nBuilding Effective Strategies: Insights from QDA are like strategic guides. They help businesses in crafting plans that match people’s desires.\n\nCreating Genuine Connections: Understanding people’s experiences lets businesses connect on a real level. This genuine connection helps build trust and loyalty, priceless for any business.\n\nHow to do Qualitative Data Analysis: 5 steps\n\nNow we are going to show how you can do your own qualitative data analysis. We will guide you through this process step by step. As mentioned earlier, you will learn how to do qualitative data analysis manually, and also automatically using modern qualitative data and thematic analysis software.\n\nTo get best value from the analysis process and research process, it’s important to be super clear about the nature and scope of the question that’s being researched. This will help you select the research collection channels that are most likely to help you answer your question.\n\nDepending on if you are a business looking to understand customer sentiment, or an academic surveying a school, your approach to qualitative data analysis will be unique.\n\nOnce you’re clear, there’s a sequence to follow. And, though there are differences in the manual and automatic approaches, the process steps are mostly the same.\n\nThe use case for our step-by-step guide is a company looking to collect data (customer feedback data), and analyze the customer feedback - in order to improve customer experience. By analyzing the customer feedback the company derives insights about their business and their customers.\n\nYou can follow these same steps regardless of the nature of your research.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\nStep 1: Gather your qualitative data and conduct research (Conduct qualitative research)\n\nThe first step of qualitative research is to do data collection. Put simply, data collection is gathering all of your data for analysis. A common situation is when qualitative data is spread across various sources.\n\nClassic methods of gathering qualitative data\n\nMost companies use traditional methods for gathering qualitative data: conducting interviews with research participants, running surveys, and running focus groups. This data is typically stored in documents, CRMs, databases and knowledge bases. It’s important to examine which data is available and needs to be included in your research project, based on its scope.\n\nUsing your existing qualitative feedback\n\nAs it becomes easier for customers to engage across a range of different channels, companies are gathering increasingly large amounts of both solicited and unsolicited qualitative feedback.\n\nMost organizations have now invested in Voice of Customer programs, support ticketing systems, chatbot and support conversations, emails and even customer Slack chats.\n\nThese new channels provide companies with new ways of getting feedback, and also allow the collection of unstructured feedback data at scale.\n\nThe great thing about this data is that it contains a wealth of valubale insights and that it’s already there! When you have a new question about user behavior or your customers, you don’t need to create a new research study or set up a focus group. You can find most answers in the data you already have.\n\nTypically, this data is stored in third-party solutions or a central database, but there are ways to export it or connect to a feedback analysis solution through integrations or an API.\n\nUtilize untapped qualitative data channels\n\nThere are many online qualitative data sources you may not have considered. For example, you can find useful qualitative data in social media channels like Twitter or Facebook. Online forums, review sites, and online communities such as Discourse or Reddit also contain valuable data about your customers, or research questions.\n\nIf you are considering performing a qualitative benchmark analysis against competitors - the internet is your best friend, and review analysis is a great place to start. Gathering feedback in competitor reviews on sites like Trustpilot, G2, Capterra, Better Business Bureau or on app stores is a great way to perform a competitor benchmark analysis.\n\nCustomer feedback analysis software often has integrations into social media and review sites, or you could use a solution like DataMiner to scrape the reviews.\n\nStep 2: Connect & organize all your qualitative data\n\nNow you all have this qualitative data but there’s a problem, the data is unstructured. Before feedback can be analyzed and assigned any value, it needs to be organized in a single place. Why is this important? Consistency!\n\nIf all data is easily accessible in one place and analyzed in a consistent manner, you will have an easier time summarizing and making decisions based on this data.\n\nThe manual approach to organizing your data\n\nThe classic method of structuring qualitative data is to plot all the raw data you’ve gathered into a spreadsheet.\n\nTypically, research and support teams would share large Excel sheets and different business units would make sense of the qualitative feedback data on their own. Each team collects and organizes the data in a way that best suits them, which means the feedback tends to be kept in separate silos.\n\nAn alternative and a more robust solution is to store feedback in a central database, like Snowflake or Amazon Redshift.\n\nKeep in mind that when you organize your data in this way, you are often preparing it to be imported into another software. If you go the route of a database, you would need to use an API to push the feedback into a third-party software.\n\nComputer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS)\n\nTraditionally within the manual analysis approach (but not always), qualitative data is imported into CAQDAS software for coding.\n\nIn the early 2000s, CAQDAS software was popularised by developers such as ATLAS.ti, NVivo and MAXQDA and eagerly adopted by researchers to assist with the organizing and coding of data.\n\nThe benefits of using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software:\n\nAssists in the organizing of your data\n\nOpens you up to exploring different interpretations of your data analysis\n\nAllows you to share your dataset easier and allows group collaboration (allows for secondary analysis)\n\nHowever you still need to code the data, uncover the themes and do the analysis yourself. Therefore it is still a manual approach.\n\nOrganizing your qualitative data in a feedback repository\n\nAnother solution to organizing your qualitative data is to upload it into a feedback repository where it can be unified with your other data, and easily searchable and taggable. There are a number of software solutions that act as a central repository for your qualitative research data. Here are a couple solutions that you could investigate:\n\nDovetail: Dovetail is a research repository with a focus on video and audio transcriptions. You can tag your transcriptions within the platform for theme analysis. You can also upload your other qualitative data such as research reports, survey responses, support conversations (conversational analytics), and customer interviews. Dovetail acts as a single, searchable repository. And makes it easier to collaborate with other people around your qualitative research.\n\nEnjoyHQ: EnjoyHQ is another research repository with similar functionality to Dovetail. It boasts a more sophisticated search engine, but it has a higher starting subscription cost.\n\nOrganizing your qualitative data in a feedback analytics platform\n\nIf you have a lot of qualitative customer or employee feedback, from the likes of customer surveys or employee surveys, you will benefit from a feedback analytics platform. A feedback analytics platform is a software that automates the process of both sentiment analysis and thematic analysis.\n\nCompanies use the integrations offered by these platforms to directly tap into their qualitative data sources (review sites, social media, survey responses, etc.). The data collected is then organized and analyzed consistently within the platform.\n\nIf you have data prepared in a spreadsheet, it can also be imported into feedback analytics platforms.\n\nOnce all this rich data has been organized within the feedback analytics platform, it is ready to be coded and themed, within the same platform.\n\nThematic is a feedback analytics platform that offers one of the largest libraries of integrations with qualitative data sources.\n\nStep 3: Coding your qualitative data\n\nYour feedback data is now organized in one place. Either within your spreadsheet, CAQDAS, feedback repository or within your feedback analytics platform. The next step is to code your feedback data so we can extract meaningful insights in the next step.\n\nCoding is the process of labelling and organizing your data in such a way that you can then identify themes in the data, and the relationships between these themes.\n\nTo simplify the coding process, you will take small samples of your customer feedback data, come up with a set of codes, or categories capturing themes, and label each piece of feedback, systematically, for patterns and meaning. Then you will take a larger sample of data, revising and refining the codes for greater accuracy and consistency as you go.\n\nIf you choose to use a feedback analytics platform, much of this process will be automated and accomplished for you.\n\nThe terms to describe different categories of meaning (‘theme’, ‘code’, ‘tag’, ‘category’ etc) can be confusing as they are often used interchangeably. For clarity, this article will use the term ‘code’.\n\nTo code means to identify key words or phrases and assign them to a category of meaning. “I really hate the customer service of this computer software company” would be coded as “poor customer service”.\n\nHow to manually code your qualitative data\n\nDecide whether you will use deductive or inductive coding. Deductive coding is when you create a list of predefined codes, and then assign them to the qualitative data. Inductive coding is the opposite of this, you create codes based on the data itself. Codes arise directly from the data and you label them as you go. You need to weigh up the pros and cons of each coding method and select the most appropriate.\n\nRead through the feedback data to get a broad sense of what it reveals. Now it’s time to start assigning your first set of codes to statements and sections of text.\n\nKeep repeating step 2, adding new codes and revising the code description as often as necessary. Once it has all been coded, go through everything again, to be sure there are no inconsistencies and that nothing has been overlooked.\n\nCreate a code frame to group your codes. The coding frame is the organizational structure of all your codes. And there are two commonly used types of coding frames, flat, or hierarchical. A hierarchical code frame will make it easier for you to derive insights from your analysis.\n\nBased on the number of times a particular code occurs, you can now see the common themes in your feedback data. This is insightful! If ‘bad customer service’ is a common code, it’s time to take action.\n\nWe have a detailed guide dedicated to manually coding your qualitative data.\n\nUsing software to speed up manual coding of qualitative data\n\nAn Excel spreadsheet is still a popular method for coding. But various software solutions can help speed up this process. Here are some examples.\n\nCAQDAS / NVivo - CAQDAS software has built-in functionality that allows you to code text within their software. You may find the interface the software offers easier for managing codes than a spreadsheet.\n\nDovetail/EnjoyHQ - You can tag transcripts and other textual data within these solutions. As they are also repositories you may find it simpler to keep the coding in one platform.\n\nIBM SPSS - SPSS is a statistical analysis software that may make coding easier than in a spreadsheet.\n\nAscribe - Ascribe’s ‘Coder’ is a coding management system. Its user interface will make it easier for you to manage your codes.\n\nAutomating the qualitative coding process using thematic analysis software\n\nIn solutions which speed up the manual coding process, you still have to come up with valid codes and often apply codes manually to pieces of feedback. But there are also solutions that automate both the discovery and the application of codes.\n\nAdvances in machine learning have now made it possible to read, code and structure qualitative data automatically. This type of automated coding is offered by thematic analysis software.\n\nAutomation makes it far simpler and faster to code the feedback and group it into themes. By incorporating natural language processing (NLP) into the software, the AI looks across sentences and phrases to identify common themes meaningful statements.\n\nSome automated solutions detect repeating patterns and assign codes to them, others make you train the AI by providing examples. You could say that the AI learns the meaning of the feedback on its own.\n\nThematic automates the coding of qualitative feedback regardless of source. There’s no need to set up themes or categories in advance. Simply upload your data and wait a few minutes. You can also manually edit the codes to further refine their accuracy. Experiments conducted indicate that Thematic’s automated coding is just as accurate as manual coding.\n\nPaired with sentiment analysis and advanced text analytics - these automated solutions become powerful for deriving quality business or research insights.\n\nYou could also build your own, if you have the resources!\n\nThe key benefits of using an automated coding solution\n\nAutomated analysis can often be set up fast and there’s the potential to uncover things that would never have been revealed if you had given the software a prescribed list of themes to look for.\n\nBecause the model applies a consistent rule to the data, it captures phrases or statements that a human eye might have missed.\n\nComplete and consistent analysis of customer feedback enables more meaningful findings. Leading us into step 4.\n\nStep 4: Analyze your data: Find meaningful insights\n\nNow we are going to analyze our data to find insights. This is where we start to answer our research questions. Keep in mind that step 4 and step 5 (tell the story) have some overlap. This is because creating visualizations is both part of analysis process and reporting.\n\nThe task of uncovering insights is to scour through the codes that emerge from the data and draw meaningful correlations from them. It is also about making sure each insight is distinct and has enough data to support it.\n\nPart of the analysis is to establish how much each code relates to different demographics and customer profiles, and identify whether there’s any relationship between these data points.\n\nManually create sub-codes to improve the quality of insights\n\nIf your code frame only has one level, you may find that your codes are too broad to be able to extract meaningful insights. This is where it is valuable to create sub-codes to your primary codes. This process is sometimes referred to as meta coding.\n\nNote: If you take an inductive coding approach, you can create sub-codes as you are reading through your feedback data and coding it.\n\nWhile time-consuming, this exercise will improve the quality of your analysis. Here is an example of what sub-codes could look like.\n\nYou need to carefully read your qualitative data to create quality sub-codes. But as you can see, the depth of analysis is greatly improved. By calculating the frequency of these sub-codes you can get insight into which customer service problems you can immediately address.\n\nCorrelate the frequency of codes to customer segments\n\nMany businesses use customer segmentation. And you may have your own respondent segments that you can apply to your qualitative analysis. Segmentation is the practise of dividing customers or research respondents into subgroups.\n\nSegments can be based on:\n\nDemographic\n\nAge\n\nInterests\n\nBehavior\n\nAnd any other data type that you care to segment by\n\nIt is particularly useful to see the occurrence of codes within your segments. If one of your customer segments is considered unimportant to your business, but they are the cause of nearly all customer service complaints, it may be in your best interest to focus attention elsewhere. This is a useful insight!\n\nManually visualizing coded qualitative data\n\nThere are formulas you can use to visualize key insights in your data. The formulas we will suggest are imperative if you are measuring a score alongside your feedback.\n\nImpact\n\nIf you are collecting a metric alongside your qualitative data this is a key visualization. Impact answers the question: “What’s the impact of a code on my overall score?”.\n\nUsing Net Promoter Score (NPS) as an example, first you need to:\n\nCalculate overall NPS\n\nCalculate NPS in the subset of responses that do not contain that theme\n\nSubtract B from A\n\nThen you can use this simple formula to calculate code impact on NPS.\n\nYou can then visualize this data using a bar chart.\n\nYou can download our CX toolkit - it includes a template to recreate this.\n\nTrends over time\n\nThis analysis can help you answer questions like: “Which codes are linked to decreases or increases in my score over time?”\n\nWe need to compare two sequences of numbers: NPS over time and code frequency over time. Using Excel, calculate the correlation between the two sequences, which can be either positive (the more codes the higher the NPS, see picture below), or negative (the more codes the lower the NPS).\n\nNow you need to plot code frequency against the absolute value of code correlation with NPS.\n\nHere is the formula:\n\nThe visualization could look like this:\n\nThese are two examples, but there are more. For a third manual formula, and to learn why word clouds are not an insightful form of analysis, read our visualizations article.\n\nUsing a text analytics solution to automate analysis\n\nAutomated text analytics solutions enable codes and sub-codes to be pulled out of the data automatically. This makes it far faster and easier to identify what’s driving negative or positive results. And to pick up emerging trends and find all manner of rich insights in the data.\n\nAnother benefit of AI-driven text analytics software is its built-in capability for sentiment analysis, which provides the emotive context behind your feedback and other qualitative textual data therein.\n\nThematic provides text analytics that goes further by allowing users to apply their expertise on business context to edit or augment the AI-generated outputs.\n\nSince the move away from manual research is generally about reducing the human element, adding human input to the technology might sound counter-intuitive. However, this is mostly to make sure important business nuances in the feedback aren’t missed during coding. The result is a higher accuracy of analysis. This is sometimes referred to as augmented intelligence.\n\nStep 5: Report on your data: Tell the story\n\nThe last step of analyzing your qualitative data is to report on it, to tell the story. At this point, the codes are fully developed and the focus is on communicating the narrative to the audience.\n\nA coherent outline of the qualitative research, the findings and the insights is vital for stakeholders to discuss and debate before they can devise a meaningful course of action.\n\nCreating graphs and reporting in Powerpoint\n\nTypically, qualitative researchers take the tried and tested approach of distilling their report into a series of charts, tables and other visuals which are woven into a narrative for presentation in Powerpoint.\n\nUsing visualization software for reporting\n\nWith data transformation and APIs, the analyzed data can be shared with data visualisation software, such as Power BI or Tableau, Google Studio or Looker. Power BI and Tableau are among the most preferred options.\n\nVisualizing your insights inside a feedback analytics platform\n\nFeedback analytics platforms, like Thematic, incorporate visualisation tools that intuitively turn key data and insights into graphs. This removes the time consuming work of constructing charts to visually identify patterns and creates more time to focus on building a compelling narrative that highlights the insights, in bite-size chunks, for executive teams to review.\n\nUsing a feedback analytics platform with visualization tools means you don’t have to use a separate product for visualizations. You can export graphs into Powerpoints straight from the platforms.\n\nConclusion - Manual or Automated?\n\nThere are those who remain deeply invested in the manual approach - because it’s familiar, because they’re reluctant to spend money and time learning new software, or because they’ve been burned by the overpromises of AI.\n\nFor projects that involve small datasets, manual analysis makes sense. For example, if the objective is simply to quantify a simple question like “Do customers prefer X concepts to Y?”. If the findings are being extracted from a small set of focus groups and interviews, sometimes it’s easier to just read them\n\nHowever, as new generations come into the workplace, it’s technology-driven solutions that feel more comfortable and practical. And the merits are undeniable. Especially if the objective is to go deeper and understand the ‘why’ behind customers’ preference for X or Y. And even more especially if time and money are considerations.\n\nThe ability to collect a free flow of qualitative feedback data at the same time as the metric means AI can cost-effectively scan, crunch, score and analyze a ton of feedback from one system in one go. And time-intensive processes like focus groups, or coding, that used to take weeks, can now be completed in a matter of hours or days.\n\nBut aside from the ever-present business case to speed things up and keep costs down, there are also powerful research imperatives for automated analysis of qualitative data: namely, accuracy and consistency.\n\nFinding insights hidden in feedback requires consistency, especially in coding. Not to mention catching all the ‘unknown unknowns’ that can skew research findings and steering clear of cognitive bias.\n\nSome say without manual data analysis researchers won’t get an accurate “feel” for the insights. However, the larger data sets are, the harder it is to sort through the feedback and organize feedback that has been pulled from different places. And, the more difficult it is to stay on course, the greater the risk of drawing incorrect, or incomplete, conclusions grows.\n\nThough the process steps for qualitative data analysis have remained pretty much unchanged since psychologist Paul Felix Lazarsfeld paved the path a hundred years ago, the impact digital technology has had on types of qualitative feedback data and the approach to the analysis are profound."
