        "text": "White Balance\n\nQuickly change the mood of your image by making all the colors warmer or cooler, or use the machine learning-powered White Balance to automatically fix white balance in shots with unwanted color casts.\n\nBasic\n\nAdjust lightness, contrast, clarity and texture of an image using the Basic adjustment. Lift the shadows and pull in highlights to reveal hidden detail. Adjust Brightness to enhance photos that are a little too bright or too dark. Or use Clarity and Texture adjustments to enhance image details and make subjects in your shots stand out.\n\nSelective Clarity\n\nUse the Selective Clarity adjustment to subtly enhance fine details in specific areas of an image. Adjust shadows, midtones, or highlights individually, bringing the most important details into focus.\n\nHue & Saturation\n\nShift all the colors in your image along the color spectrum, make colors richer and more brilliant, or adjust their vibrancy. The Hue & Saturation adjustment also features an Auto button that lets you make photos more vivid and vibrant using the power of breakthrough machine learning.\n\nColor Balance\n\nChange the balance of all the colors in your photo by adjusting the intensity of red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, and yellow.\n\nSelective Color\n\nThe Selective Color adjustment lets you easily adjust precise color ranges in your image, like the blues, yellows, or greens, without affecting any of the others. It features 8 individual color ranges divided according to the color spectrum.\n\nLevels\n\nLevels is a great adjustment for almost any photo as it’s designed to be both versatile and easy to use. So you can quickly improve the most important aspects of a photo, like the brightness, contrast, and colors, all in one place.\n\nCurves\n\nThe Curves adjustment is one of the most powerful in all of image editing, letting you adjust almost every aspect of the lighting and colors in your shots with an incredible level of depth and precision.\n\nReplace Color\n\nUse the Replace Color adjustment to replace any color in your image with any other. You can pick both the color you want to replace and its replacement in any way like. For example, using the built-in Color Picker to pick a color directly from your image, or using the native Colors window.\n\nRemove Color\n\nRemove any color from an image or even video using the Remove Color adjustment. Use the color picker to pick a color and adjust its range, luminance, and intensity for more precision.\n\nFade\n\nWash out the contrasts in your photo to give it a faded look.\n\nBlack & White\n\nFeaturing a range of options that help bring out the contrasts, textures, lighting, and shadows in your black-and-whites, the Black & White adjustment lets you create beautiful black and white photography, even from your color photos.\n\nColor Monochrome\n\nUse the Color Monochrome effect to turn all the colors in your image into shades of a single color. You can also blend the new monochrome with your original image using Intensity.\n\nSepia\n\nInstantly give your photo an aged, vintage look by changing all the colors into shades of sepia.\n\nChannel Mixer\n\nMix the balance of the red, green, and blue color channels to create intense color effects in your images.\n\nInvert\n\nThe Invert adjustment instantly inverts all the colors in your image in their opposite colors.\n\nCustom LUT\n\nTransform the look of an image using a LUT file – a color preset created in Pixelmator Pro or another image editing, video, or graphics app.\n\nVignette\n\nAdd an artistic vignette around photos to create a retro look or draw attention to your subjects.\n\nSharpen\n\nThe Sharpen adjustment gives you a way to quickly make all the details in your photo clearer by increasing overall sharpness."
