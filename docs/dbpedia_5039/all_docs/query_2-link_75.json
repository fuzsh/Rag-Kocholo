        "text": "You can find key information, privacy, and security settings all in your Google Account. We have created easy-to-use tools like Dashboard and My Activity, which give you transparency over data collected from your activity across Google services. There are also powerful privacy controls like Activity Controls and My Ad Center, which allow you to switch the collection and use of data on or off to decide how all of Google can work better for you.\n\nYour Google Account is always easy to find in our most popular services like Search, Maps, YouTube, Gmail, and Assistant. Just tap on your profile picture and follow the link to your account.\n\nIn just a few minutes, you can choose what types of data are saved to your Google Account, update what you share with friends or make public, and adjust the types of ads you would like us to show you. You can change these settings as often as you want and even choose to have regular reminders sent.\n\nFirst launched in Chrome, Incognito mode has since become available in our most popular apps. In YouTube, Search on iOS, and Maps, just tap from your profile picture to easily turn it on or off. When you turn on Incognito mode in Maps and YouTube, your activity, like the places you search for or the videos you watch, won't be saved to your Google Account. Browsing history and cookies from your Incognito session are deleted from Chrome once you close all Incognito windows.\n\nWeâve made it easier for you to make decisions about your data directly within the Google services you use every day. For example, without ever leaving Search, you can review and delete your recent Search activity, get quick access to relevant privacy controls from your Google Account, and learn more about how Search works with your data. You can access these controls in Search, Maps, and Google Assistant."
