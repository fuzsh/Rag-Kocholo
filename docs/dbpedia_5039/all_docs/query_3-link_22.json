        "text": "A collection agency is a company used by lenders or creditors to recover funds that are past due or from accounts that are in default. Often, a creditor will hire a collection agency after it has made multiple failed attempts to collect its receivables. A lender may outsource the debt-collection activity to a collection agency, or it may have an internal department or a debt-collection subsidiary that would handle the job.\n\nHow a Collection Agency Works\n\nCreditors will often hire a collection agency after a borrower is 60–90 days or more past due with a debt. The delinquency typically will be reported to the three major credit bureaus—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Reputable collection agencies abide by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) when it comes to contacting you and trying to collect the debt.\n\nWhen a Borrower Pays\n\nIf the borrower pays the debt as a result of the collection agency's efforts, then the creditor pays the collection agency a percentage of the funds, or assets, that it recovers, depending on the terms of the agreement.\n\nWhen a Borrower Does Not Pay\n\nIf the borrower will not or cannot cover their arrearage, the collection agency can update the borrower’s credit report with a \"collection\" status, which leads to a drop in the individual’s credit score. A low credit score can affect a person's chances of obtaining a loan in the future, as an account in collections can remain on their credit report for seven years.\n\nCollection agencies deploy multiple strategies to try to retrieve funds, such as the following:\n\nCalling the debtor’s personal and office telephones\n\nMailing numerous late-payment notices to the debtor\n\nContacting a debtor’s family, friends, and neighbors to confirm the debtor’s contact information\n\nAppearing at the individual’s front door\n\nDebt Collection Agency Regulations\n\nThird-party collection agencies—but not creditors' in-house collection departments—are bound by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), of which some rules are cited below.\n\nA debt collector may not do the following:\n\nProceed to collect an old debt that has been charged off as \"uncollectible\"—the debtor has either filed for bankruptcy or cannot be located\n\nLegally seize assets from a debtor—unless the collection agency has won a lawsuit against a debtor\n\nPhysically harm or threaten to harm a debtor in an attempt to extract a payment\n\nContact an individual at work if they have explicitly stated that their employer doesn't approve of such calls\n\nContact you more than seven times during a seven-day period\n\nA debt collector may, however, do the following:\n\nAttempt to collect a debt on which the statute of limitations—usually between four and six years from the first day of default—has run out if you live in a state that allows this practice.\n\nCall an individual between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. only\n\nContact the debtor’s employer about overdue child support and alimony, federal student loans, or taxes\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCompanies sometimes will outsource collection efforts on past-due accounts. While this can be a cost-effective approach for creditors, being contacted by a collection agency can be stressful for those owing the debt. In most cases, it is best to pay the debt as quickly as possible if you are contacted and do, in fact, owe the debt. Failing to act quickly can damage your credit score further and possibly lead to a lawsuit. Keep in mind, though, that collection agencies are bound by the FDCPA, so it's also a good idea to familiarize yourself with the rights you're afforded when contacted by a collection agency."
