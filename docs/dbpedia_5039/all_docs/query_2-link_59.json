        "text": "Download using Google Takeout\n\nGo to https://www.google.com/settings/takeout and login using a desktop computer.\n\nClick \"Deselect all\" to deselect all Google services\n\nScroll down to \"Google photos\" and select it.\n\nThe button \"Multiple formats\" gives some info about what will be downloaded.\n\nClick \"All photo albums included\" to get the list of albums. All albums are selected by default.\n\nWhen you do not see that text right away, you may have to wait a few minutes.\n\nTo select specific albums, click \"Deselect all\" and select the albums you want to download.\n\nThere are year albums (\"Photos from 2020\" etc) and your own albums (if not shared!!). Downloading year albums and own albums all will result in duplicates between your albums and the year albums.\n\nTo find albums down the list you can use the Find function of the browser (Ctrl+F).\n\nClick \"OK\" to continue. That brings you back to https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout\n\nScroll to the bottom of the page and click \"Next step\"\n\nChoose how you want to get the data (\"Customize format\")\n\nChoose \"Delivery method\" (includes Email, Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, Box ... ). Select an option to get more info. Note that this will create a ZIP file in all cases, but not all services can UNZIP. Search for example \"Google Drive\" unzip to find how to unzip in Drive.\n\n\"Export type\" (One-time or scheduled every 2 months)\n\n\"File type\" - choose Zip format\n\n\"Archive size\"\n\nClick \"Create archive\" or \"Link account and create archive\" (depends on delivery format you selected)\n\nAfter awhile, you'll receive an email that says \"Your Google data archive is ready\"\n\nfor example your Zip file is ready to download. Download and unzip the file into a drive that has enough room to store it. The file size could be quite large depending on how many photos are in your collection.\n\nor where it is stored, for example \"View in OneDrive\". In OneDrive or the like you will find a ZIP file with the photos/videos. To my knowledge there is no UNZIP feature in OneDrive.\n\nNotes\n\nWhen a photo is edited in GP the ZIP folder includes both the original and the edited photos.\n\nIn takeout you find year albums and albums you created yourself. Photos that are in your own albums are also in the year albums. Thus when you download everything using Takeout there may be duplicates between the year albums and your own albums.\n\nPhotos added by others to a collaborative album will NOT be included in the downloaded album, even when they are added to your account, unless you replace them by your copies. But they are included in the year albums.\n\nThe ZIP folder also includes .json files with data (for example descriptions, locations) added in Google Photos. Google does not provide any tools to add them to the photos, but EXIFTool and others are able to do it.\n\nSee \"How to preserve Descriptions, Locations and Date/time added in Google Photos\" further below.\n\nThird party sofware\n\nNot tried. Use at your own risk.\n\nhttps://github.com/mattd/google-photos-downloader\n\nhttps://github.com/makingglitches/GooglePhotoDownload\n\nHow to get a real backup of your \"mobile photos\"\n\nPhotos from mobile devices can be synced with Google Photos, but that is not a safe backup:\n\nTwo-way syncing propagates erroneous deletions. Every week users ask to recover the photos they deleted from trash accidentally, or which they do not even find in trash.\n\nOnce you remove the device copy (to save storage) there is only one (working) copy left.\n\nSince the link between Google Photos and Google Drive stopped working in July 2019, the only automatic way offered by Google no longer does work. See https://blog.google/products/photos/simplifying-google-photos-and-google-drive/\n\nThere however are a few other methods:\n\nYou can manually download photos from Google Photos to your computer by one of the methods described above:\n\nYou can regularly download the recently added from the timeline or from https://photos.google.com/search/_tra_ (\"Recently added\", also available via the \"Explore\" tab in the web app)\n\nWhen you add photos to albums you can download new albums from Google Photos or via Takeout\n\nSome users suggested third party software (not checked):\n\nhttps://pypi.org/project/gphotos-sync\n\nhttps://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download\n\nIt is safer and easier to have an automatic backup\n\nYou can directly upload from a mobile device to a second cloud service like OneDrive, iCloud, Dropbox or others. You can use this as a temporary backup, and download to a computer (for example when storage gets full), or pay for more storage.\n\nYou can even use Google Photos:\n\nCreate a second Google account (if you don't already have one)\n\nShare your library with that account and accept the share.\n\nNote that you can share with only one other account.\n\nActivate the option to add (save) photos to the library of the second account.\n\nYour photos are now safe because deletions in account 1 do not sync to account 2\n\nNotes:\n\nOnly photos deleted in account 1 do count for storage in account 2.\n\nWhen account 1 stops sharing all photos will count for storage.\n\nYou can use third-party software like MultCloud to transfer to another cloud (and download from there).\n\nA user signaled https://pypi.org/project/gphotos-sync/ to automatically download to a computer.\n\nSee also\n\nGoogle Photos is NOT a \"Backup\" of Your Photos\n\nTransferring Pictures from Smartphone to Computer\n\nZIP files\n\nAfter downloading a .zip file using any of the methods above, your browser prompts you to save the .zip file. You can also rename the zip at this time\n\nUnzip the zip file\n\nIn Windows Explorer, right click the zip file, click \"Extract All\" then \"Extract\"\n\nWhen unzipping is finished, you may delete the zip file (but check before you delete)\n\nHow to preserve Descriptions, Locations and Date/time added in Google Photos\n\nIn Google Photos, \"Captions\" added before uploading are now shown as \"Other\" in the info of a photo. They always remain part of the photo.\n\n\"Descriptions\" added in Google Photos are lost when downloading from Google Photos, but transferred by other methods (Partner sharing, sharing albums).\n\nWhen using Google Takeout, a .json file in the downloaded ZIP file includes info about the added description, location, and changed date. There are tools able to merge .json and image:\n\nEXIFTool\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/42024255/bulk-join-json-with-jpg-from-google-takeoutTo add a description of the file, the appropriate placement for this would be IPTC:Caption-Abstract, XMP:Description, and EXIF:ImageDescription. You could copy these with:\n\n'-Caption-Abstract<Description', -Description, or '-ImageDescription<Description'\n\nhttps://github.com/mattwilson1024/google-photos-exif (2020)\n\nHow to merge image with his .json file (Google Photos takeout) - Exiftool forum\n\nMetadataFixer can fix EXIF Metadata in pictures and videos when exporting from Google Takeout. There is a demo version and a paid version: https://metadatafixer.com/.
