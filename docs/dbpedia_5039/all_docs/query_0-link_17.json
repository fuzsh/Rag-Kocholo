        "text": "Microsoft released a new version of the Photos app for Windows 11 in October 2022. This article relates to the previous legacy version of the Photos app on Windows 10 and some versions Windows 11, detailing the group photos by faces feature. The People tab and the ability to group photos and videos by similar faces (when turned on by you) is not available in the new Photos app.\n\nTo find out which version of the Photos app you are running:\n\nIn the search box on the taskbar, type photos and then select the Photos app from the results.\n\nSelect Settings , and under the About section, select About Photos.\n\nPhotos: says Updated in the About section of Settings. You are running the new version of the Photos app. This version includes features like iCloud integration in left hand navigation bar.\n\nPhotos legacy: does not say Updated in the About section of Settings. You are running the previous, or legacy version of the Photos app. The legacy version includes features like Video Editor, People tab, and Albums. Learn more about Photos legacy.\n\nIf your PC is running the new version of Photos and you'd like to revert to the Photos legacy version, open the Photos app, select Settings, and under the About section select Get Photos Legacy.\n\nWhen turned on by you, previous versions of the Photos app use facial grouping technologies to help you quickly and easily organize photos and videos of friends and family. Facial grouping distinguishes faces from other objects in an image and groups similar faces across multiple photos or videos based on information that you provide to the app about people in your collection."
