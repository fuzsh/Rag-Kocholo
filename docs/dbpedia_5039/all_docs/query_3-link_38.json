When items are out of stock, they will be automatically removed from the slideshow. We recommend a minimum of four items in your product group.\n\nSetup a slideshow for collections\n\nFrom your desktop, log in to your Pinterest business account\n\nClick the hamburger icon at the top-left of the page\n\nUnder Ads, click Create campaign\n\nClick Manual Campaign, then Get Started\n\nSelect the Catalog sales objective.

You do not need to add a hero image\n\nAdd a hero destination URL and tracking parameters\n\nFinalize your budget, targeting, and optimization details\n\nClick Publish\n\nPreview a collections ad\n\nYou can preview your collections ads through Pin preview when creating or editing a campaign in Ads Manager.\n\nIn Ads Manager, under Ads select your Pin and toggle to Selected. Then click Preview Pin.\n\nWhen previewing a collections ad generated using the catalog sales objective, the hero destination URL (if specified) will show in Pin preview. If a hero destination URL is not specified, the hero destination URL will default to the organic URL of the selected Pin.\n\nNote: Any secondary creatives that appear during Pin preview will likely differ from the secondary creative that appears in a live ad, since the products automatically update to show what’s relevant to each user.\n\nMore about collections ads\n\nLearn how people interact with collections ads, see how secondary creatives work, and get collections ads specific creative specs and metrics.\n\nCollections ads with video as a hero creative will appear in feed just like collections ads with static images as a hero creative.\n\nWhen people on Pinterest see the video in their feed, it will autoplay when it’s 50% in view or more (excluding the secondary creatives). If the awareness objective is selected, the video will loop continuously. If the conversion or consideration objectives are selected, the video will prompt people to “Watch again” once it has played once.\n\nIf someone on Pinterest taps a collections ad that has a video hero creative, the video will loop indefinitely in the closeup experience. Once in closeup, tapping on the video will open video controls, and does not drive to the destination URL.\n\nThe secondary creatives are manually or automatically tagged when the collections Pin is created. Secondary creatives can be set manually by selecting an existing Pin, entering a product ID from your catalog or entering a URL. Alternatively, secondary creatives can be set by selecting a product group from your catalog when using the catalog sales objective.\n\nProducts as secondary creatives\n\nWe support a maximum of 24 tagged products per collections ad. When a product Pin is selected as a secondary creative, the secondary creative will show pricing in the upper-left corner, followed by the title below.\n\nWhen using the collections ad format under the catalog sales objective, secondary creatives are selected and organized based on relevance to the person viewing the collections ad. If an insufficient number of secondary creatives are available, we’ll pull four additional products from your product group and order them based on the highest click through rate (CTR). If a product is out of stock, it will be removed from the product group.\n\nYou can learn more about how to add secondary creatives to your collections ad in the Create a collections ad section above.\n\nIn addition to the metrics available in Ads Manager, collections ads use two collections specific metrics:\n\nSecondary creative impressions: This metric is a total of the number of views that the secondary creatives receive\n\nSecondary creative clicks: This metric is a total of the number of Pin clicks that the secondary creatives receive\n\nHow collections ads reporting is calculated\n\nImpressions and Pin clicks are reported in aggregate for the secondary creatives that appear within a collections ad. We currently don’t provide individual reporting for secondary creatives. We recommend using tracking parameters to identify which individual products are converting. You can learn how to set these up in our Track a collections ad article.\n\nEngagement rate includes standard ads engagement metrics in addition to secondary creative saves, secondary creative and hero creative Pin clicks, and outbound clicks.\n\nEngagement-based conversion metrics include conversions that occur once someone has performed any of the engagement actions (above) and converts.\n\nClick-based conversion metrics include conversions that occur once someone has clicked on a collections ad in the feed. Secondary creative click-based conversions count towards total click-based conversions.\n\nVideo metrics are available in reporting when using video as a hero creative."
