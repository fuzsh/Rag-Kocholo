With this option we handle the appropriate sales taxes for orders, and then pay out any profits from the orders to you. More details below.\n\nAlternatively, you can choose to collect the payments yourself through your own payment gateway. At the time of writing, we support the payment gateways PayPal, Stripe, Square and Offline. With this option, when a customer places an order in your store the payment will be processed through your nominated payment gateway. You will receive the amount paid in full. Pic-Time will then collect any costs associated with the payment (production costs, shipping costs) from you before the order is pushed into production.
