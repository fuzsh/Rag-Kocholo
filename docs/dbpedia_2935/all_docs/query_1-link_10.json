An increasing number of schools, colleges and universities are also adopting film as an area of study. Numerous courses are devoted to the study of aspects of film and film history and many disciplines are also actively integrating the use of film, among them Media Studies, English, Historical Studies, American Studies and Cultural Studies, to name just a few. But do we need yet another book on Film Studies? While there are any number of academic texts covering many different areas of Film Studies, there are relatively few textbooks which explain basic concepts in a lucid manner suitable for students at the very beginning of their studies. For example, at the time of writing only a single textbook is available for British A level students. Studying Film provides an alternative core text for the new AS/A-Level specification in Film Studies. The text is also designed to provide a useful tool for undergraduate students both in Film Studies and cognate degree courses. It will also assist teachers of Film Studies and those with a general interest in film alike, providing additional information outside the syllabus's scope for those wishing to learn more.\n\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank the many people who in various ways have helped in the development and completion of this book.

Shouldn't films be enjoyed rather than studied? Doesn't studying films destroy their entertainment value? Arguably film was the major art form and entertainment of the twentieth century and shows no sign of giving up this status as we enter the twentyfirst. Most of us have been watching films since childhood and have consequently developed an informal literacy in the language, grammar and syntax of film. Studying film can help to formalize and deepen this informal cineliteracy, as well as broadening the medium's entertainment value. The increasing popularity of academic and specialist film journals, as well as of TV programmes and documentaries about the making of films, indicates this. Studying film can also develop an understanding of production techniques, how films communicate meaning, how we as audiences both respond to films and influence the types of films made, and how the industry functions in terms of ownership, control, finance, marketing and exhibition. How to study film? Film can be studied within three key but interrelated areas: industry, text and audiences. Films can be studied as cultural products, texts that carry particular values and beliefs which are open to a number of different interpretations. They can powerfully affect or influence us, their audience, while satisfying our desires. Films can also be regarded as an integral part of the global media industry and thus are central to the economic activities of an increasingly concentrated range of multinational conglomerates. The field of Film Studies is already large but is still growing in popularity. The GCE Advanced Level in the subject has already been running for several years and an increasing number of universities are also adopting film as an area of study. In many universities, a range of second and third year modules are devoted to the study of aspects of film and film history and many disciplines are also actively integrating the use of film, such as Media Studies, English, Historical Studies, American Studies and Cultural Studies, to name just a few. Studying Film is aimed at students taking such courses. It will also assist teachers and those with a general interest in film alike, providing additional information for those wishing to learn more. Studying Film aims to aid systematic study of cinema and film based on the key concepts, terms and issues that have informed Film Studies and film criticism. It focuses on how cinema functions as an institution for the production and distribution of social knowledge and entertainment, the very specific ways in which film images and sounds generate meaning, and the relationship between audiences and cinema as institution, as films, as texts. Although most attention will be paid to dominant forms of popular cinema - Hollywood alternative or less 'popular' cinemas will also be addressed. Consequently, Studying Film aims to cover a broad spectrum of topics within Film Studies from a range of perspectives;\n\nI n t r o d u c t i o n\n\n2\n\nhence the inclusion of other areas of cinema outside Hollywood, in particular British cinema. Although this coverage is neither comprehensive nor exhaustive of the huge range of film movements that exist, it will indicate some of the alternatives to mainstream Hollywood cinema. In doing all this, each chapter provides case studies, summaries, suggestions for further reading and exercises, some of which are questions for discussion but others of which may be suitable for essay work. A list of suggested websites, a glossary and an index are supplied. As a result, this textbook will provide an invaluable resource for the student and teacher alike. Studying Film aims to stimulate appreciation, enjoyment and understanding of a wide range of different types of film together with an awareness of the nature of cinema as a medium, art form, and social and economic institution. It aims to encourage an understanding of the nature of personal responses to film and to deploy the critical languages that have been developed to analyse the ways in which films and spectators construct meaning. It will provide a critical and informed sense of the contexts in which films are and have been produced, disseminated and consumed, within both mainstream and alternative cinema. It aims to instil a thorough knowledge of the critical and technical terms used in film production and practice. Finally, it will develop a critically informed sense of the history and development of film conventions, both mainstream and alternative.\n\nS T R U C T U R E\n\nOF\n\nTHE\n\nBOOK\n\nThe book is divided into four main sections covering Cinema as Institution, Film as Text, Critical Approaches to Film, and Film Movements and National Cinemas. Part 1 (Cinema as Institution) examines cinema in relation to the social context within which it operates, in particular the interaction between the cinema as an industry and the audience. It considers the determining factors behind film form, paying particular attention to the industrial and economic basis of commercial cinema, particularly its business and profit motives. Its principal focus is Hollywood, but not to the exclusion of other cinemas. Part 2 (Film as Text) provides an introduction to the basic terms of visual communication and perception as well as to the technical terms specific to cinema. In doing so, it begins to analyse how images and sounds produce and communicate meaning. Part 3 (Critical Approaches to Film) examines the major critical approaches towards understanding film and aims to discover the complex relationship between film as text, cinema as institution, and the audience. The chequered history of theories about how individual spectators 'read' films is also considered. Finally, Part 4 (Film Movements and National Cinemas) explores other forms of cinema outside Hollywood that have been vital to the development of film. It looks at the range of different cultural and institutional contexts for cinema and seeks to understand the different, sometimes explicitly oppositional forms of film associated with them. A note on one or two conventions and other choices about usage which we have adopted for this text. English language titles are given first (except where the meaning of the foreign title should be evident), as well as the original titles in most cases; directors and dates are\n\nI n t r o d u c t i o n\n\n3\n\ngiven for most films. We have decided to use the word 'film' to refer both to individual films and to the celluloid, the material of the original medium. The term 'movie' is used sparingly, principally in reference to particularly American contexts. The Glossary explains some key terms. The future for Film Studies? Although there is an emerging discipline, 'Screen Studies' the objects of which include TV, video, video games and whatever happens on a monitor screen as well as film itself - Film Studies will surely remain relevant and must surely inform the new Screen Studies. To be sure, rapid changes in production and projection technologies and viewing contexts are now evident, and these are addressed at a number of points in this volume.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nP\n\nAR T 1\n\nCinema as Institution\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nHollywood Cinema The studio system 7 Decline of the studio system 15 Hollywood from 1948 to the present 16 Independent American film 23 Conclusion 25 Summary 25\n\nn this opening chapter we shall focus on the American film industry which goes by the\n\nI\n\nname of Hollywood. The precursors to and origins of Hollywood are examined elsewhere,\n\nin Chapter 7 on Early Cinema and Film Form; here we shall be examining Hollywood from its heyday, the 'mature' Studio System between the years 1930 and 1949, through to what has variously been called post-1948 Hollywood, New Hollywood or contemporary Hollywood. While tracing the development of Hollywood, we shall also look at the growth of the 'independents' and their relationship to the major studios in terms of finance, distribution and exhibition. Histories of Hollywood have changed over time. Early histories were little more than firsthand accounts of the industry, written by individuals who were often part of the very system they claimed to analyse. This raises questions of the objectivity and usefulness of such accounts. From the 1970s onwards, however, a new academic form of Film History emerged from the university campuses which sought to revise the earlier, often uncritical, histories. In turn, these histories were themselves challenged in the late 1970s and 1980s and scrutinized by others who had adopted Marxist-materialist perspectives. Then by the mid-1980s, another mode of Film History, which focused upon institutions, began to emerge. Academic understanding of Hollywood, therefore, has developed as the writing of film history itself has changed. Our intention is simply to focus upon certain key periods; we acknowledge that the boundaries that mark different periods in Hollywood's history (and, indeed, what to call them) are still in dispute, but we shall not enter into that debate here.\n\nT H E\n\nS T U D I O\n\nS Y S T E M\n\nThe origins and early history of the motion picture industry in Hollywood will be discussed in other chapters; our emphasis here will be on the years between 1930 and 1949, which have been described as the 'Golden Age' or the 'Classical Era' of Hollywood film. To understand\n\nC i n e-rn a\n\n8\n\nas\n\nI n s t i t u t i o n\n\nwhy this is so, we need to examine the nature of Hollywood film production during this period, which Thomas Schatz (1998) has referred to as 'the genius of the system'. It is during this period that we see Hollywood trying to remove any element of surprise or unpredictability from the film-making process at every level from a film's conception to its exhibition. It must be pointed out here, however, that many of the techniques that were so effective during the heyday of the Studio System were being developed from 1909 onwards and were already firmly in place by 1930.\n\nOligopoly By 1930 eight studios dominated the Hollywood film industry in the form of an oligopoly: a situation where the market is completely dominated by a small number of companies, resulting in limited competition. These companies were divided into the 'Majors' or 'Big Five', which were Warner Brothers, Loew's-MGM, Fox, Paramount and Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) (see Figure 1.1), and the 'Minors' or 'Little Three': Columbia, Universal and United Artists (UA). The major studios were vertically integrated, which means they exercised control over production, distribution and exhibition, whereas the minors generally concentrated on production. Hollywood's position as the film capital of the world was made possible partly by the advent of the First World War in 1914. The war temporarily destroyed European competition, particularly in France and Italy. For the next four years Hollywood dominated the film world, establishing an impressive global distribution network. It has been estimated that in 1914 Hollywood produced 50 per cent of the world's films; by 1918 it produced nearly all of them. By 1925 foreign film rentals amounted to 50 per cent of total Hollywood revenues.\n\nImage Not Available\n\nFigure 1.1\n\nRKO: disbanded in 1957 (BFI Stills, Posters and Designs)\n\nH o l l y w o o d\n\nC i n e m a\n\n9\n\nVertical Integration Vertical integration meant that the major studios dominated film production, distribution and exhibition. They made, released and marketed their films, even owning the cinemas in which they were shown: exhibition was the most profitable sector of the film industry. In the days before television and VCRs, box-office sales were the source of income for recouping budgets spent on making films. The heads of the major studios wanted to ensure that there was a constant outlet for their product, and this led to a series of initiatives designed to dominate the industry. In 1916 Adolph Zukor developed a system of 'block booking' for film distribution. He forced theatre owners to rent Paramount's star vehicles along with groups or 'blocks' of other less desirable and less commercially viable films. Zukor thus ensured a steady outlet for his films regardless of their quality, meaning that money was made on everything Paramount produced. Within a year every major production company had adopted this practice. The studios already controlled production and block booking represented an attempt to control distribution and exhibition as well. This desire to dominate exhibition was extended by the studios' attempts to acquire as many cinemas as possible during the 1920s. By the 1930s the majors were pouring most of their investments into exhibition, and as a result between 1930 and 1949 they owned almost three-quarters of first-run US cinemas. The majors had divided the country into 30 markets and these were again subdivided into zones, in which the cinemas were classified as first-run, second run, and so on. First-run cinemas showed films as soon as they were released. They tended to have large numbers of seats, were situated in key locations in urban areas, and charged higher admission prices. Each film had to be shown for 14 to 42 days before it could move to the next zone, and this meant a maximum profit for the majors from each release. The majors' ownership of theatre chains, in particular first-run cinemas, together with block booking practices, ensured maximum exhibition of their films. As mentioned above, the studios had already established an impressive global distribution system by the 1920s, and a major factor in their success was an international market for their films. The major studios dominated this distribution network as a direct result of their control of exhibition. The minors had some involvement in distribution, most notably United Artists, which was set up in response to Zukor's block booking initiatives by Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin and D.W. Griffith in 1919 for the exclusive distribution of their films. However, they had to co-operate with the majors' system of distribution, and in practice this meant that the majors ensured that their own films received priority over those of the minors. It was these initiatives that increased cost-effectiveness and guaranteed profits and helped to account for the commercial success of the Hollywood Studio System after 1930.\n\nA s s e m b l y Line P r o d u c t i o n During the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood, the studios produced one film each per week per year. At its height, the studio system released 350 films in a single year. The studios were able to achieve such remarkable production figures through rationalization of working practices.\n\nC i n e m a\n\n10\n\nas\n\nI n s t i t u t i o n\n\nAdopting a 'scientific management' approach to film production, the studios began to model themselves on factories, employing assembly-line techniques, hierarchical structures, and a strict division of labour; the 1920s also witnessed hundreds of Model T Ford cars as well as an array of other consumer items rolling off assembly lines. In fact Thomas Ince had initiated such practices in the film industry as early as 1908 in the first Hollywood studio, Inceville. Each studio had its own back lot, wardrobe department, props and contract actors. At first, studio heads exercised almost total control over film production, holding responsibility for approving the original film concept and its budget, allocating the director and team of writers, approving the completed screenplay, supervising casting and hiring of other personnel, checking the film's progress, and overseeing the editing. In 1931,\n\nhowever, Columbia announced the introduction of a producer-unit system\n\nwhereby a head of production was responsible for running the studio; directly beneath him/her were several associate producers responsible for supervising a number of films and delivering them to the head of production. These methods were designed to save money since each associate producer could now monitor his/her own projects more closely than one central figure could. Often, the producer was the only person to see the film through from conception to completion. In addition to this, particular specialisms could be developed under particular associate producers, which led to more innovation, creativity, and ultimately better quality films. Altogether, these new working practices improved the efficiency and consistency of film production in the Hollywood Studio System. At Warner Brothers, for example, as many as 20 writers would work on a single script. The script was prepared to an extremely detailed standard and the writers were usually present on set. Once the producer had approved the completed screenplay, the stars/actors were cast and the director, art director, composer, camera operator and editors were appointed. During the studio era the director rarely had any say over any of these personnel; directors were salaried employees 'there to make sure the actors hit their marks while the camera was running' and who left production once shooting had been completed (Biskind, 1998, p.19). The film was then passed on to the editing department, which cut it according to a set of general specifications. Indeed, the style of each film owed more to the values of the studio as a whole than to those of any particular individual working on it. As the largest, most profitable and productive of the studios during the 1930s, MGM mainly produced melodramas, musicals and literary/theatrical adaptations notable for their high key lighting, rich production design and middle-class American values (The Wizard of Oz, 1939; Gone with the Wind, 1939). In contrast, Paramount had a definite 'European' feel since many of its directors, craftspersons and technicians had come from Germany. It made sophisticated and visually lavish films such as 'sex-and-violence' spectacles, musical comedies, and light operas (The Sign of the Cross, 1932; The Love Parade, 1930). Warner Brothers had a reputation as the studio of the working class and focused on low-life melodramas and musicals with a Depression setting (The Public Enemy, 1931; Wild Boys of the Road, 1933; Gold Diggers of 1933, 1933). Under Busby Berkeley, the musical flourished at Warner Brothers (the Gold Diggers series) while RKO became the home of the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical as well as of literary adaptations (Flying Down to Rio, 1933; The Hunchback\n\nH o l l y w o o d\n\nC i n e m a\n\n11\n\nof Notre Dame, 1938). 20th Century Fox films such as The Grapes of Wrath (1942) were characterized by their 'hard, glossy surfaces' (Cook, 1996, p.292). As for the minors, Universal produced low-budget features designed for the double bill, but did make a niche for itself in the horror-fantasy genre (Dracula, 1931). Columbia specialized in westerns, while UA became more a distributor for independent directors than a production company (City Lights, 1931; The Front Page, 1931).\n\nStyle It was during this period that the studios developed a set of film techniques known as the 'continuity system'. Films of the studio system were constructed in a particular way to ensure that everything was made clear to the viewer. Techniques included psychologically rounded characters with clear goals, character-driven action, the removal of 'dead time', a cause-and-effect, chronological linear narrative, a sense of closure, continuity editing and verisimilitude. This enabled the viewer to suspend disbelief while watching a smooth flowing narrative with a clear ending. These techniques became known as 'classical' film form and will be described in Chapters 6-8.\n\nGenre Another form of standardization that facilitated the use of factory production-line techniques during the studio era was the development of genre. Genre simply means a type or category of film (or book or other artwork; the term is not restricted to Film Studies). Genres provided the formulae for making films during the studio era, and, as noted above, each studio specialized in a particular genre or set of genres in an attempt to attract customer brand loyalty through product differentiation. Genres suited the nature of the studio system for two main and connected reasons. First, they offered a financial guarantee. They were formulaic, they contained conventions and they were repetitive (see Chapter 10). Consequently, they could easily be recycled over and over again, promising standardized consistency. Once a formula had been tried and tested, it was hoped that future success could be guaranteed. Why innovate when past experience based on a specific formula had been profitable? This allowed the studios to successfully target, select and predict audiences. Generic films could be pre-sold to an audience along with a particular star. Generic differences allowed the easy identification of audiences for which specific films could be made, which in turn facilitated standardized production. The audience would recognize the characteristics of that genre and the promise that its storyline would develop with a measure of predictability, thus providing the desired outcome and hence providing satisfaction and fulfilling desires. Second, genres provided a means for the studio to save money. With the establishment of a particular formula, the sets, props, equipment, techniques, storylines and stars could be re-used time after time and frequently were. For example, RKO producer Val Lewton (known as the 'Sultan of Shudders') outlined his recipe for horror: 'Our formula is very simple. A love story, three scenes of suggested terror, one scene of actual violence and it's all over in less than 70 minutes' (quoted in Burman, 1999, p. 9).\n\n12 j\n\nC i n e m a\n\nas\n\nI n s t i t u t i o n\n\nGenre, therefore, was one of the ways in which the studios sought to eliminate the unpredictability that is the nature of a creative medium like film. Principal examples of genre in the studio system were: western (Stagecoach, 1939); horror (Frankenstein, 1931); musical (42nd Street, 1933); gangster (Little Caesar, 1930) and film noir (The Maltese Falcon, 1941).\n\nThe Contract\n\nSystem\n\nAs mentioned above, the American film industry was rationalized and subject to scientific management techniques. This included a highly specialized division of labour designed to facilitate mass production of films. Accordingly, during the years 1930 to 1949 the studios employed all personnel, even their stars, on long-term or permanent contracts. The stars, directors and crew were contracted to a particular studio and even those who had established a reputation in the industry were employed on a contract basis. This meant that individuals could be assigned to their roles with ease, speed and minimal expense. Contracts tied stars to a particular studio, which helped to target and attract a big audience for the studio's films. If, however, a star refused to work on a particular film then s/he was not given an alternative and had to sit out for one and a half times the duration of that production while suffering loss of income. As a result many seven-year contracts were extended to twice that length. Often, however, stars were loaned out to other studios; Columbia regularly borrowed stars from its rivals. The contract system may have been a source of bitterness for many Hollywood stars during these years, but it contributed to the success of the studio system.\n\nNew Technologies During this period new technologies were developed which had a significant effect on promoting the success of the studio system. Of paramount importance were the introduction of sound technology from 1926 onwards, of cameras with greater mobility, depth of field photography and colour film. These are dealt with in more detail in Chapter 5 on Film Technology.\n\nContext What must not be ignored in explaining the success of the studio system is the context within which the films were made and consumed. It must be remembered that between the years 1929 and 1949 the United States underwent a series of traumas: the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Great Depression, and the Second World War. In 1929 the Stock Market crashed, plunging millions of Americans into poverty. Banks were closed, farms were ruined, and many lost their jobs in the subsequent depression, the likes of which had never been witnessed in American history. The Depression felt even worse because it came immediately after the prosperity and consumer boom of the 1920s, which many have labelled 'the Jazz Age'. During this time of despair and stress, the movies provided a means of escape from the harsh realities of American life and Hollywood films, with a few exceptions, tended to downplay the worst aspects of the Depression. In part, this was due to the strictures of\n\nH o l l y w o o d\n\n13\n\nC i n e m a\n\nthe Hays Office (see p. 57 below).\n\nWhat is more, under the New Deal, Franklin D.\n\nRoosevelt's series of initiatives designed to get America back on the road towards recovery, the restrictive practices of the film studios were tolerated. Similarly, during the Second World War, while other industries either nationalized or closed down (vacuum cleaners and motor cars, for example), Hollywood was not only left untouched, instead it flourished because the government deemed it an 'essential industry'. Not only did it provide a diversion from the war, but its help was also enlisted in fighting the war. Studios helped to sell war bonds, they made training and information films, and assisted in producing and disseminating propaganda co-ordinated by the Office of War Information's Bureau of Motion Pictures, such as Frank Capra's 'Why We Fight' series.\n\nCasablanca (Michael Curtiz 1942) (Warner Brothers) Casablanca has been described as one of the most typical products of the Hollywood studio system. Warners produced it for $953,000, Michael Curtiz directed it and it starred Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid and Claude Rains. The film was an instant success and became one of the biggest hits in studio history, winning Oscars for Best Picture (1942 and 1943), Director (1943) and Screenplay (1943); its producer, Hal B. Wallis, won the Thalberg Memorial Award. Plot: Casablanca is set in neutral French Morocco, North West Africa in late 1941, where refugees from Europe anxiously await exit visas to escape to Lisbon and from there to America. The action focuses around the Cafe Americain owned by Rick (Bogart). Victor Laszlo (Henreid) arrives in Casablanca with his wife lisa (Bergman), both trying to escape the Nazis. We learn that Rick had previously had an affair with lisa in Paris. The Nazis, as represented by Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), are desperate to prevent Laszlo from leaving Casablanca and the chief of police, Captain Renault (Claude Rains), is asked to assist (see Figure 1.2).\n\nImage Not Available\n\nCasablanca: the star system at work (BFI Stills, Posters and Designs)\n\nFigure 1.2\n\n14\n\nC i n e m a\n\nas\n\nI n s t i t u t i o n\n\nProduction: Warners' mode of production was highly centralized. As Executive in Charge of Production, Hal B. Wallis had first pick of story properties, directors, performers, and any other contract talent. The Head of the Studio, Jack Warner, also agreed to hire any additional talent that Wallis felt was fundamental to the production. Finally, Wallis had total control to edit the film. As producer, therefore, Wallis had a huge amount of control over the film. Furthermore, Warners' directors were adjusted to the assembly-line mode of production; they were expected to work on four to five films per year with little active participation in pre- and postproduction. They were excluded from story and script development as well as from editing. Their role was confined almost exclusively to intensive filming, and when most of a film had been completed they were assigned to another project. They had little creative freedom since they were subject to an inflexible studio organization and strict production schedules. This was the case even for Warners' 'star' directors like Curtiz, who had become the studio's top staff director by 1941 having made films such as Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), The Front Page (1935), Captain Blood (1935) and The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). Genre: Casablanca is a love/romantic story and a thrilling adventure/war story in the classical Hollywood style. It is simultaneously two films, allowing for dual readings and different levels of enjoyment for different audiences. Style: Casablanca exemplified the Warners' style which, more than that of any other studio in the 1940s, tended towards film noir. Warners had already made The Maltese Fa/con (1941), starring Bogart as a hard-boiled detective in an espionage thriller. Curtiz, who was appointed to direct Casablanca, developed a noirish style for the film which continued in his later films Passage to Marseilles (1944) and Mildred Pierce (1945). The no/rish style was based on expert camera movement, low key lighting, rapid pacing and shadows, including many night scenes. Such cinematography fitted in with Warners' strict budget policy and helped to disguise cheap sets, particularly during wartime when materials for set design were lacking and films had to be made in more austere conditions. Casablanca illustrates this well: location work was avoided and most of the shooting occurred in a studio. The action rarely leaves Rick's cafe and most scenes are either interior shots or set at night. The final sequence demonstrates the creativity of the set designers in creating the illusion of a fully operational airport. Filmed on a stage, the view from the hangar depicts a cardboard model plane in the distance. In order to achieve 'realism' and to maintain the perspective, midgets acted the roles of the mechanics. Script: The film was based on an unpublished play, Everybody Comes to Rick's by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It was then adapted for the screen by a series of writers before shooting began. Aeneas Mackenzie and Wally Kline began the initial treatment; they were later removed by Wallis and replaced by Casey Robinson, Warners' in-house expert on romantic melodrama. Finally, Warners' 'top script doctors' Julius and Philip Epstein were officially appointed and credited with the screenplay while Robinson received no official recognition for his work. During filming, Wallis appointed Howard Koch to rework the character of Rick, for which he received a credit. And when preview audiences expressed disappointment with the ending, Wallis himself is alleged to have added the last line of dialogue: 'Louis, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' Stars: Bogart was selected for the role of Rick and on 1 January 1942 he signed a sevenyear deal with Warners for $2,750 per week. Bogart was chosen because he was the Warners tough guy - cynical and self-reliant. Although he became a top star at Warners and won an Oscar nomination for his role, he was still tied to his seven-year contract and went on to make a series of war films. David 0. Selznick loaned Bergman to Warners for $15,000 per week and Paul Henreid was loaned out by RKO against his will.\n\nH o l l y w o o d C i n e m a\n\n15\n\nExercise 1.1 Take any film from the 'mature1 studio era (1930-49) and examine how it was produced under studio conditions. You may wish to consider the following elements: producer, script, genre, style, director, stars, set design and sound. How did these elements combine to form a successful film?\n\nD E C L I N E\n\nOF\n\nTHE\n\nSTUDIO\n\nSYSTEM\n\nIn 1949, the studio system began to decline as a result of a number of interrelated factors: â¢\n\nDivorcement in 1948 effectively ended vertical integration as the US courts required the 'Big Five' studios to divorce production and distribution from exhibition because the practice broke anti-trust laws; this brought to an end the oligopoly of the studio era. In the 1940s the studios had already agreed to end other restrictive practices such as block booking and blind selling.\n\nâ¢\n\nThe huge demand for films during the 1940s led to a rise in independent production, and in an attempt to reduce overheads the majors subcontracted production to such companies.\n\nâ¢\n\nStars began to seek greater independence from the studios. In 1943 Olivia de Havilland took Warner Brothers to court over her contract; this resulted in the development of fixed-term rather than unlimited contracts. Stars and crew now had greater freedom than ever before.\n\nâ¢\n\nCosts of production rose as a result of wage increases brought about by the growth of trade unions in the industry.\n\nâ¢\n\nImport tariffs were imposed on Hollywood films, as foreign countries wanted to prevent the export of dollars while audiences were growing more interested in European art cinema.\n\nâ¢\n\nDuring the 1950s many Americans moved to the newly established suburbs; this had an adverse effect on audience figures, as cinemas were mainly located in urban rather than suburban areas. Although drive-ins were introduced, this did not help to arrest the declining trends since such enterprises tended to favour independent films.\n\nâ¢\n\nTelevision competed with cinema after 1948 and attendances fell as TV became the focus for leisure activity.\n\nTogether, these seven factors combined to increase the costs of production while decreasing the revenues which films brought in. Audiences fell by half between 1946 and 1956, approximately 4,000 cinemas closed, and there were massive staff cuts. This led to the end of the 'factory' production-line system as the studios had no guaranteed outlet for their films. Facing competition from the independents, the studios discovered that their structure was too expensive to maintain. In 1957 RKO, for example, was disbanded. In place of the studio system a new structure for the film industry gradually emerged.\n\n16\n\nCinema\n\nH O L L Y W O O D\n\nF R O M\n\n1948\n\nTO\n\nas\n\nTHE\n\nInstitution\n\nP R E S E N T\n\nDivorcement and the newly established television networks led to increased competition and decreased integration in the film industry. As a result, film production became more and more fragmented as independent film production was boosted and new smaller companies began to supply low-budget films (see the section below on Independent American Film' for more detail). The majors increasingly subcontracted production and were eagerto lease studio space to these companies, which further exacerbated the fragmentation of Hollywood. During the 1950s the major studios also increasingly moved into producing TV programmes. Although structural changes in the mode of film-making from the 1950s onwards may have resulted, it can still be debated whether this actually constituted a decisive break with the traditions of the studio system. The term 'New Hollywood1 may be widely used to refer to post-1950s Hollywood, but there is a great deal of debate over what is actually 'new' compared with the earlier studio system. Labels and periodizations that seek to divide Hollywood into distinct periods are continuously in dispute and an academic consensus has not yet been reached.\n\nOligopoly Film production at the start of the twenty-first century is still dominated by seven major studios: Warners, Paramount, Disney, MCA/Universal, MGM/UA, 20th Century Fox and Columbia Tristar Together they produce 33 per cent of films in the USA, but receive 90 per cent of revenue. Furthermore, the majors have continued to control domestic and international distribution, and although the theatre chains had been split off in 1948 they still continued to dominate exhibition. Douglas Gomery has called this new arrangement a 'bi-lateral oligopoly', replacing the oligopoly of the period 1930-49.\n\nVertical\n\nIntegration\n\nThe anti-trust legislation of 1948 forced the majors to divorce their lucrative exhibition arms, resulting in a major loss of revenue. In 1985, however, this legislation was overturned, reflecting President Ronald Reagan's more tolerant attitude towards big business, once again allowing the major studios to buy profitable theatre chains. Thereafter Coca-Cola (the owners of Columbia) bought the Walter Reade chain; MCA/Universal bought a 49 per cent share in Cineplex Odeon; Columbia/Sony bought Loew's Theaters; and Paramount and TimeWarner Brothers both bought their own cinemas.\n\nThe Package\n\nUnit S y s t e m\n\nIn place of the studio system and its mass production of films, a new 'package unit system' developed in the 1950s whereby individual productions were wholly or partially financed by a studio. Under the studio system ideas were developed almost entirely within the studio, but now 'packages' were developed outside the major studios, which then became sources\n\nH o l l y w o o d\n\nC i n e m a\n\n17\n\nof labour and materials for film production. In the absence of mass production, major companies had to compete for projects initiated outside their studios. Independent producers assembled a package consisting of a script, director and stars on a one-time-only basis in order to acquire finance. The producer, rather than a mogul or studio executive, was now responsible for a film, overseeing its progress from conception to exhibition (see Chapter 2). Alfred Hitchcock, for example, had a contractual agreement with Universal to use their studio staff and equipment. Film-makers, however, were still reliant upon the majors for finance, production and distribution. Studio executives, with little experience of industry, gambled on bankable producers, directors, and stars with strong track records. This caused a shift in power away from the major studios towards new 'star' producers, directors and actors. Film-making is now increasingly dominated by 'the deal' negotiated between the producer and the studio. Nowadays the star may also receive a percentage of the profits. As control has shifted from the studios to the producers and directors, responsibility for the budgets has moved away as well, with the result that the influence of producers and directors has increased. Furthermore, many directors now enjoy more creative freedom to pursue their personal and artistic vision. The major studios have been willing to tolerate this trend towards expanding budgets. Since the early 1950s Hollywood has been increasingly hit-driven following the success of big-budget, star-studded blockbusters such as The Ten Commandments (1956) (Figure 1.3)\n\nImage Not Available\n\nThe Ten Commandments: an early blockbuster (BFI Stills, Posters and Designs)\n\nFigure 1.3\n\nCinema\n\n18\n\nas\n\nInstitution\n\nand The Sound of Music (1965). The budget for the former ($12m) broke the all-time record for a film at that time. From the 1960s onwards the major studios have followed a 'boom or bust' philosophy and this trend has become particularly marked since the 1970s as it was matched by increasing box-office figures. Thomas Schatz argues that not only has the blockbuster mentality significantly intensified among the major studios, but since the release of Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) (Figure 1.4), it has also been consolidated. According to Schatz, Jaws underlined the value of saturation booking and advertising and the increased importance of a film's box-office performance in the opening weeks of its release. It set new standards for popular cinema and convinced Hollywood that an expensively produced and highly publicized film will automatically turn into a blockbuster (Schatz 1993, pp. 17-25). Compare this to the tight budgets and schedules of the studio system era. Today the industry's success is based upon very few films. Approximately one film in 10 makes a profit on the first run, and so the majors release only 150 films per year between them in an attempt to minimize their financial risks. Compare this to the 350 films that were produced in one year at the height of the studio system. In planning new productions studios increasingly look for sequels, prequels, series and copies of other successful formulae to try to build upon an already proven formula.\n\nStyle In contrast to the 'classical' film form of the studio era, films that came out of post-1948 Hollywood did not always follow mainstream film techniques. While classical conventions\n\nImage Not Available\n\nFigure 1.4\n\nJaws: consolidated the blockbuster mentality (BFI Stills, Posters and Designs)\n\nH o l l y w o o d\n\nC i n e m a\n\n19\n\nwere and are still in evidence, greater individuality and creativity on the part of the director, together with an increased willingness to incorporate European art cinema, led to the appearance of more 'alternative' films (see Chapter 8 on Mainstream and Alternative Film Form). A new generation of directors was emerging whose styles had been shaped by influences very different from those of the studio system. Many of these new directors had been through film schools and had encountered alternatives to Hollywood. Directors such as Coppola, Scorsese, Lucas and Spielberg were labelled the 'movie brats' because of the way they challenged established Hollywood directors and film styles. However, this initial challenge soon came to be seen as Hollywood's saviour. A number of the 'movie brats' films of the 1960s (The Graduate, Bonnie and Clyde, Midnight Cowboy, Easy Rider) embodied alternative and 'art' techniques. These films were relatively low budget but were very popular with teenage audiences because of the issues covered, the styles used and the frequent use of contemporary music. The studio was no longer responsible for the style of a film. Whereas before the studio could be distinguished by a film's 'look', under the new conditions it was very difficult to discern a film made by a particular studio as there was no consistency.\n\nGenre Under the new Hollywood structure, the standardized conventions of genre were largely discarded. Instead of the formulaic genre mode of film production of the studio system, Hollywood has increasingly espoused innovation and hybridity. Despite the blockbuster mentality, the success of two relatively inexpensive and unconventional films, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and M*A*S*H (1969), caused Hollywood to begin changing direction. More innovation was introduced as a new generation of American-based directors including Robert Altman, Arthur Penn, Mike Nichols, Bob Rafelson, Stanley Kubrick and Roman Polanski emerged, influenced by the European art cinema of Bergman, Fellini, Truffaut and Antonioni, to join forces with the movie brats. Without the restrictive walls of genre, such directors were able to experiment with as well as challenge generic conventions. This has also taken on an economic dimension for the major studios since mixing genres could broaden the potential appeal of a film. As we have seen, Casablanca was an early example of this, blending a love story, a romantic thriller and an adventure-war story. More recent examples include Star Wars (1977), a mix of science fiction, western, action and war; Blade Runner (1982), science fiction, action/adventure, detective, film noir and horror; and Pulp Fiction (1994), gangster and comedy. Under New Hollywood, genres have become blurred and often hybrid, particularly since the emergence of postmodernism (for more detail see Chapters 10 and 12).\n\nFree Agents The ending of studio contracts for creative personnel in the early 1950s meant that important stars, directors, writers and other talent could now negotiate their own deals with the production companies. Increasingly, agents negotiated deals with studios on behalf of individuals, thus ending the restrictive contracts of the studio system. The most powerful talent\n\n20\n\nC i n e m a a s l n s t i t u t i o n\n\nagencies today are the Creative Artists Agency, the William Morris Agency, International Creative Management and MCA. The end of the contract system and the decline of the rigidly hierarchical studio mode of production combined to give more creative autonomy to the director. Freed from the restrictive directives, budgets and schedules of the studio moguls and executives, a director could impose a more personal imprint upon a film. S/he now had more input into pre- and postproduction, overseeing story and script development, casting and editing. This new power was validated by the emergence of auteurism (see Chapter 9 on Authorship). Similarly, it can also be argued that actors can now have more input into their roles, interpreting them with more individuality than was possible under the studio system. The power of star actors has also increased massively since the ending of the restrictive contract system. It has even been suggested, notably by John Boorman (Deliverance), that five or six key stars have usurped the studios in the Hollywood hierarchy. This power has translated into bigger fees, and many stars now have creative control over a film, including approving its final cut (see Chapter 11 on Stars). The overall effect has been a shift in power away from the studios and an increase in film budgets.\n\nNew Technologies Since the Studio System era, Hollywood has continued to see new technologies developed which played a significant part in the success of the industry. This happened in two ways. First, improvements in camera, sound, colour, viewing and computer/digital technologies have led to the creation of more technologically sophisticated films which have helped attract audiences back into the cinemas (see Chapter 5 on Film Technology). Second, the major studios sought to maximize the potential of the rapid growth of new media technologies, in particular cable, satellite and video technology. Cable and satellite stations were eager to pay large sums to screen Hollywood films and increasingly most films now recoup initial budgets on video sales and rentals. Altogether, the revenue from cable TV, satellite and video has begun to overtake that from theatrical release.\n\nContext As was the case during the days of the studio system, Hollywood films continued to be significantly determined by the context in which they were produced. The onset of the Cold War in 1947, the investigations of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee (HUAC) into Hollywood in 1947 and 1951, and the hysteria of the McCarthy years combined to produce a climate of fear and a blacklist in Hollywood. The result was a decline in socially conscious films and the rise of the anticommunist and science fiction feature. The ending of the blacklist by the end of the 1950s re-energized Hollywood film production. By the late 1960s antiestablishment and counter-cultural tendencies are clearly evident in American film, no doubt influenced by the assassination of JFK, by the Beatles, the pill, drugs, American involvement in Vietnam, and the high profile assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy. Furthermore, the Production Code had been liberalised since the early 1960s, and was\n\nH o l l y w o o d\n\nC i n e m a\n\n21\n\nformally dropped in 1968 (see p. 58). By this point the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s had become more militant and violent, transforming itself into Black Power, and this was matched by the students' and women's struggles. These issues spilt over into the 1970s, exacerbated by continued involvement in Vietnam. Watergate compounded America's troubles by revealing the presidency to be flawed and corrupt. In the 1980s, however, Reagan sought to restore confidence in the United States and its foreign policy, and this decade saw a renewed Hollywood interest in Vietnam and other conflicts. This was the period of 'high concept' film-making (see Wyatt, 1994). By the 1990s the end of the Cold War led Hollywood to seek new enemies both outside and within America.\n\nApocalypse Now (Francis Ford Coppola 1979) The production of /Apocalypse Now demonstrates the dramatic changes in film production following the decline of the studio system. United Artists produced it for more than $30m, Francis Ford Coppola directed it and it starred Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Martin Sheen (Figure 1.5). The film was a box office success, taking in over $37m, receiving favourable critical reviews and winning Oscars for Best Cinematography and Sound (1979). Plot: /Apocalypse Now can be read both as a physical journey, up a primitive river in the quest for a man whose discovery promises revelation, and as a metaphorical journey into the darkest recesses of the human mind. During the Vietnam War, Captain Willard (Sheen) is sent along a tributary of the Mekong into a tip of Cambodia to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Brando), once a promising young officer but now insane and surrounded by a gang of worshippers. Coppola's stated reason for making the film was to assist Americans in 'putting the Vietnam experience behind them'. It has since emerged as a provocative and influential film that closely approximates the horror as well as the emotional and physical upheaval of the American experience in Vietnam. Apocalypse Now demonstrates the combination of astute political comment with spectacular aesthetics.\n\nImage Not Available\n\nApocalypse Now: Coppola directs Brando (BFI Stills, Posters and Designs)\n\nFigure 1.5\n\n22\n\nC i n e m a\n\nas\n\nl n s t i t u t i o n\n\nProduction: Coppola was one of the 'movie brats': a film school educated director (in this case UCLA) influenced by European art cinema who had directed The Rain People (1969) and the first two parts of The Godfather (1972, 1974). In contrast to the tight production schedules of the studio system, preproduction began in mid-1975 and postproduction ended in 1979. The film was originally scheduled to be shot over six weeks and to open in 1977, but various setbacks, such as a typhoon that destroyed the sets, and financial overruns, plagued filming and shooting lasted 16 months instead. Overall, production lasted for four years. Similarly, the initial budget was $12m, far in excess of earlier studio budgets, and this rocketed to $31.5m. Genre: Although it can be classified as a war story, the film's philosophical implications, which examine the horror and madness of war, take it beyond the traditional war genre. Its controversial political comment, for example, widened the boundaries of the war genre, as Casablanca had done. It has also been described as a 'quest' film that moves through several other genres such as thriller, horror, adventure and even comedy. Style: In contrast to the studio influence on products of the 1930s and 1940s, UA was not responsible for the style of Apocalypse Now, The film owes its particular style to the vision of Coppola and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, combining art cinema with popular entertainment. It contains some spectacular set pieces, such as the opening dissolves and superimpositions of Sheen's face with a ceiling fan and a helicopter attack; the 'Ride of the Valkyries' battle sequence; and the napalm destruction of Kurtz's compound during the final credits of the film. In contrast to earlier productions that were almost entirely filmed on studio sets, /Apocalypse Now was filmed on location in the Philippines. Script: /Apocalypse Now was a loose adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness (1899) co-written by Coppola and John Milius (the latter went on to make militaristic films such as Red Dawn (1984)). Michael Herr, who had written Dispatches (1977) using his experiences as an army correspondent in Vietnam, provided additional material. As a result, the film displays a clear ambivalence in regard to its view of the Vietnam War, displaying both pro- and anti-war sentiments. Many scenes and cinematic techniques work to further a pro-military, pro-war interpretation of the conflict, but these are always balanced by anti-war, dove-like sentiments. These opinions are never wholly reconciled and lead to what can be described as a somewhat surreal and confusing ending that did not leave critics completely satisfied. Stars: Harvey Keitel was originally cast as Willard, but two weeks into production Sheen replaced him. In contrast to the studio contracts, Brando was paid $lm in advance to be in the film. He turned up on set late, overweight and allegedly drunk, having read neither the script nor the book on which the film was based, illustrating the new power held by key stars. The film also featured many young actors who would later become Hollywood stars, such as Dennis Hopper, Larry Fishburne and Harrison Ford.\n\nE x e r c i se 1. 2 Look at the production of a particular Hollywood film after the 1960s. What are the differences and similarities between films made under the new system and the studio system? How do differences in the structure of the film industry affect the film itself?\n\nHollywood\n\nCinema\n\nI N D E P E N D E N T\n\nA M E R I C A N\n\n23\n\nFILM\n\nIndependent American film is not a new phenomenon. It has existed since the early days of Hollywood; indeed, many of the major studios began life as independent production companies. During the height of the studio system independent film companies known as 'poverty row', such as Disney, Republic, Monogram and Tiffany, supplied B-features for double bills. Divorcement in 1948 boosted independent film production and companies like Allied Artists and American International Pictures began to supply low-budget films for the growing teenage market. In this period, the majors were eager to lease studio space to independent production companies and increasingly subcontracted production to them; this resulted in such films as Marty (1955) and The Bachelor Party (1957), which were produced by the Hecht-Lancaster company established in 1947. UA, which was the distribution company for such films, released several notable films including Kiss Me Deadly (1955), The Night of the Hunter (1955), The Sweet Smell of Success (1957) and Paths of Glory (1957). In the 1960s, the relaxing of the Production Code (see Chapter 3 on Cinema, Audiences and Society), together with the further decline of the majors, favoured the independents. In 1960, John Cassavetes made Shadows entirely outside the studio system and hence has been described as the 'father' of independent American film, drawing upon a long history of maverick film-making that was pioneered in Hollywood by Orson Welles and Citizen Kane (1941). During the 1970s, companies began to specialize in certain genres: martial arts, action, erotica, blaxploitation and horror. Many of today's independent film-makers cut their teeth on the low-budget films of the 1970s. Fuelled by the expansion in home video and cable, independent films have been ever more prominent since the 1980s, emerging from companies such as Circle Films, Hemdale, Island Pictures, New Line Cinema, Cinecom, Cannon, De Laurentis, New World and Miramax. Lowbudget productions could be financed entirely from presales to video, thus missing out the need for cinema release and going straight to video. Some of these companies attempted to work outside the sphere of the majors and accordingly fared badly. During the mid- to late 1980s, however, a new pedigree of 'neo-indies' emerged. Carolco, Morgan Creek, Castle Rock, Imagine Entertainment and Largo all possessed sufficient finance to produce their own films outside the major studios, but they worked very closely with them for distribution and exhibition. Independent film is very much alive in Hollywood today, enjoying both critical and box-office success.\n\nHow do we define I n d e p e n d e n t s ? Can independents be defined economically? A truly independent company, it is argued, can finance, produce and distribute its own films. It operates outside the control of the majors and competes directly with them for a share of the film market. However, even the large independents are not truly independent, as they are reliant on exhibitors, often the majors, for their films to be screened. In reality, independent film-makers choosing to work outside the constraints of the major studios, whose films are mostly low-budget in order to retain creative freedom, are closer to being fully independent as their films are often screened outside the exhibition chains owned by the majors.\n\n24\n\nC i n e m a\n\nas\n\nI n s t i t u t i o n\n\nHowever, independent production companies are often owned by a larger company; for example, much of Castle Rock's initial funding came from Coca-Cola, which used to own Columbia. Castle Rock is now a subsidiary of Warners. Furthermore, independents are reliant on the majors for distribution and exhibition (Castle Rock uses Columbia) and some may even receive studio backing, which surely militates against their total freedom. What is more, independent films are often planned in close co-operation with the majors for exhibition and distribution rights as well as finance. Although Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing (Figure 1.6) contains some alternative aesthetic and ideological elements and was produced by his own independent production company, 40 Acres and a Mule, it was made for MCA/Universal. Nor are all independent production companies small or low budget. Companies like Carolco, Morgan Creek, Castle Rock, Imagine and Largo were respectively responsible for these big-budget, star-studded blockbusters in 1991: Terminator 2, Robin Hood, City Slickers, Backdraft and Point Break. Most independent companies agree that the label 'independent' is somewhat misleading (see also Chapter 8). While it is agreed that an independent is defined by its capability to finance its own films, most do not operate outside the established studio system; instead they usually enjoy close ties. Today most independent film companies can be described as simply 'outgrowths' of the majors.\n\nExercise 1.3 Pick an independent film of your choice and assess how this may have shaped the values and content of the film. Does it have any unusual features or striking storylines that set it apart from mainstream Hollywood films? Consider how far any film can be truly independent.\n\nImage Not Available\n\nFigure 1.6\n\nDo the Right Thing: independent or major studio project?

The American film industry has developed from a highly structured, centralized, factory-style studio system to a more fragmented package unit system in which individual films are pitched by independent producers to competing studios. The result has been a shift from assembly-line production, with its formulaic use of genres, studio styles and stars, to a system in which directors, stars and others have more creative freedom to work outside the limitations of genre, studio style, budgets and other restrictions. Beneath the surface, however, there are some essential continuities and similarities between these two periods of American film history. Despite a short interlude, Hollywood today, like the old studio system, is still essentially a vertically integrated oligopoly. In addition, the studios both of the past and of today have utilized new technologies to maximize profits and to bring audiences into cinemas. Independent film has always existed in the United States but flourished particularly during and after the 1950s following the decline of the studio system. While it may now be hard to distinguish an independent from a major studio, independent films are still a key part of America's film output.\n\nS U M M A R Y Both the Studio System and post-1948 Hollywood can be described as 'oligopolies', dominating through vertical integration. The studio system was structured according to assembly-line production, leading to a high number of films each year. Post-1948 Hollywood is arranged around a 'package unit system', producing fewer films and more blockbusters. Each studio developed its own style and favoured particular genres, but today this is not so evident. The contract system which tied directors, crew and stars to the studio has now ended, leading to greater creative autonomy. Studios have maximized the potential of new technologies to benefit film production. Hollywood films have always benefited from the context in which they were made. Independent American film has existed since Hollywood's origins, but was boosted by 'divorcement' in 1948, the relaxing of the Production Code in the 1960s and the expansion of home video and cable. Economic independents finance, produce and distribute their own films, which are often but not always small and low-budget, operating outside the control of the majors. However, larger companies often own independents and the majors work very closely with them.\n\n26\n\nC i n e m a\n\nas\n\nI n s t i t u t i o n\n\nReferences\n\nJim Hillier, The New Hollywood (London: Studio\n\nPeter Biskind, Easy Rider, Raging Bulls: How the Sex 'n' Drugs 'n' Rock 'n' Roll Generation Saved\n\nAnnette Kuhn and Susannah Radstone (eds), The\n\nHollywood (London: Bloomsbury, 1998).

In this chapter we shall examine the\n\nH\n\nprocess of making and showing a film, from original idea to screening. We trace the\n\nlife of a film from its earliest stages of finance, preproduction, production and postproduction while explaining key roles in the film industry. The process by which films are distributed, classified, promoted and marketed to the audience will then be explored. Finally, we shall look at where and how films are exhibited as well as at reviewing and criticism. Although film production, distribution and exhibition are global phenomena, our focus here will be on the contemporary US and British situations. In particular, we shall be looking at the period from the end of the First World War to the present day and at those elements that are not covered in other chapters on Hollywood and Early Cinema and Film Form.\n\nP R O D U C T I O N This section will trace the process by which an idea is transformed into a celluloid reality. The process of production itself is subdivided into four further stages: finance, preproduction, production and postproduction.\n\nFinance Film is a blend of creativity and commercialism. It must always be remembered that most film production is an 'industry', a business designed to make money through entertainment. The profit motive of the industry cannot be stressed enough. America's film industry, for example, is the country's second largest source of export. At the same time film production is very expensive and involves high overhead costs. Finance, therefore, is essential to every\n\n28\n\nC i n e m a\n\nas\n\nI n s t i t u t i o n\n\nstage in the life of a commercial film and those who provide the money - investors, financiers, distributors and exhibitors - have great influence over the film itself.\n\nInvestors The types of investors for any one film can vary considerably. If a major studio such as Warner Brothers, Columbia TriStar or Dreamworks produces the film, it will already have enough capital to finance production through other previously successful and profitable films. On the whole, American studios finance their own development and production out of their cash flow and loans. Independent producers also usually have a contract with a studio. Extreme Measures (1996) and Mickey Blue Eyes (1999) were both made under a housekeeping deal between Liz Hurley and Hugh Grant's Simian Films and Castle Rock (a subsidiary of Warners). They developed the projects using Warners' finances, giving them first refusal on the film. On acceptance Warners fully financed the production. When seeking finance a film company will usually approach the executive producer of a studio or a production company. For independent film production, however, this capital is not guaranteed and thus it must be secured from a variety of sources such as banks, private investment companies, the government, self-financing wealthy individuals, foreign sales, distribution pre-sales, television rights and equity finance. Sid Sheinberg, ex-head of MCA/ Universal, described the difference between securing finance for a Hollywood studio and for an independent production as 'the difference between flying a 747 and one of those devices that people in the Middle Ages used to put wings on, flap and jump off cliffs' (quoted in Mcnab, 1999, p. 12). It is hard to pinpoint why exactly investors invest in a particular film, but the script, the producer, the director, the stars or any combination of these elements may appeal to them. They may have what is known as bankability, that is, it is felt that they can guarantee an audience, which will provide a good financial return on the original investment.\n\nINVESTMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM The Government In many European countries, and particularly in France, film-making is a state-funded activity with plenty of government subsidies for production, distribution and exhibition. Through a combination of taxes, tax incentives and government contributions the French film industry is the most vigorous in Europe. Although government funding for film-making in the UK is small, there has been increasing recognition of the need to finance the industry: direct funding rose from Â£14.9m in 1988 to Â£27.7m in 1994. Government money is provided through several sources: â¢\n\nThe Arts Council's National Lottery subsidies and film franchises have provided Â£67m since 1995 to those films that qualify as 'British' under the terms of the 1985 Films Act and which are intended for UK release, such as Wilde (1997) and Ratcatcher (1999).\n\nâ¢\n\nBritish Screen Finance Ltd is a film investment company backed by both the state and private sectors. Its contribution rarely exceeds Â£500,000 and is never more than 30 per cent of a film's budget. It has financed Fever Pitch (1996).\n\nP r o d u c t i o n ,\n\nâ¢\n\nD i s t r i b u t i o n\n\nand\n\nE x h i b i t i o n\n\n29\n\nThe British Film Institute co-financed films between 1951 and 1998, awarding grants to 'culturally significant projects', aiming to recover its investment through the films it financed,\n\nâ¢\n\nsuch as Beautiful People (1998). The European Co-Product/on Fund was set up in 1991 to promote collaboration between British and European Union producers. One of its projects was Louis Malle's Damage (1992).\n\nâ¢ â¢\n\nThe National Film and Television School is directly funded by the government. The British Film Commission was between 1991 and 1999 an independent organization funded by the government to market the British film industry to overseas film-makers and to provide support for the overall UK film infrastructure.\n\nâ¢\n\nThe Film Council, which was set up in April 2000, is a new strategic body for film funded by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. Headed by director Alan Parker (The Commitments, 1991; Evita, 1996), it absorbed the British Film Commission, BFI production, the Arts Council of England's Lottery Film Department and British Screen Finance.\n\nTelevision Companies Television companies are an important source of funding for films; as well as a financial return on their investment they receive the broadcast rights after the film has been released in cinemas. The arrival of pay TV (satellite, cable and digital) has led to an increased demand for films. Abroad, major players such as HBO (USA) and Canal + (France) have been financing film production for some time. In comparison to their foreign counterparts, however, TV investment in the UK is low. The major investors in the UK are the following: â¢\n\nChannel 4, through its feature subsidiary Film Four, is the biggest TV investor in Britain and has contributed to over half of all British films made since the 1980s. Approximately 10 per cent of its annual programming budget is spent on new British films and it aims to coproduce 15-20 feature films per year. Since its launch in 1982 it has made more than 300 films, including Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) and Brassed Off (1996).\n\nâ¢\n\nBSkyB has the pay TV rights to all British films that are theatrically released. It also agreed an arrangement with British Screen Finance (see above) to finance a few British productions in return for the broadcast rights, for example, for Tube Tales (1999).\n\nâ¢\n\nBBC F/7ms has a relatively small budget, but funds film-makers through its 10x10 initiative. Examples would include The Van (1996) and Billy Elliot (2000).\n\nâ¢\n\nITV Companies generally do not fund film production, but some noticed Film Four's critical success and began to invest. For example, Granada Television co-financed My Left Foot (1989).\n\nForeign Investment Often UK film-makers look abroad for foreign investment, most of which is provided by the major American studios. Foreign studios financed all the following 'British' films: Chariots of Fire (1981), A Fish Called Wanda (1988), Sense and Sensibility (1995), Emma (1996), Hamlet (1996) and The English Pat/ent(1996). Many countries offer finance or tax incentives if a significant proportion of the main photography is done there. Private Investment Private investment is another way of financing a film. This is uncommon since the high costs of producing a film are beyond the capacities of most private investors. Until 1993 the Business Expansion Scheme attracted many small-scale private investors by allowing significant tax relief\n\nCinema\n\n30\n\nas\n\nI n s t i t u t i o n\n\non investments of up to Â£40,000, leading to the production of low- to medium-budget films such as Henry V (1989). This scheme was replaced in 1994 by the Enterprise Investment Scheme - a tax-based investment programme. Using this scheme, Paradise Grove plc offered investors roles in the film as extras if they invested at least Â£1,000. Films that benefited from the Enterprise Investment Scheme were The Scarlet Tunic (1998) and An Ideal Husband (1999). Production companies can also meet production costs by negotiating special fees with crew members and equipment suppliers and by securing product placement deals. This provides a symbiotic relationship between film-maker and advertiser. While the latter gets valuable coverage of a product, the former does not have to pay for use of that product, although some do charge for placement. Recent examples include Tom Cruise swigging Red Stripe lager in The Firm (1993) and Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith wearing Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses in Men in Black (1997). Bond movies have long benefited from use of product placement (see Figure 2.1): Dom Perignon and Bellinger Champagnes, Stolichnaya and Smirnoff vodkas, Samsonite luggage and the BMW Z8.\n\nThe producer It is the job of the producer to secure finance for the film and then to supervise its expenditure. The producer is involved in every stage of a film's development from conception to exhibition and is engaged in the film longer than any other person; this continuity is essential for effective production. The producer deals with the idea, which may originate from a writer, director, producer, book or play, and must clear the screen rights for the material and then secure finance by assembling a package that includes an outline script (detailed storylines, possible stars, locations), proposed budget, a storyboard of several scenes, the director and any potential stars. The producer presents the package in such a way that it stands out from the competition in order to attract investment. This process of selling the package is known as the pitch. A successful package will not only appeal to financiers and investors; it will also reassure them that a return on their investment is possible. If the pitch is successful, a deal is struck between the producer and the investors.\n\nImage Not Available\n\nFigure 2.1\n\nBond films have typically relied on product placement to recoup production costs (Eon Productions, courtesy Kobal)\n\nP r o d u c t i o n ,\n\nD i s t r i b u t i o n\n\nand\n\nE x h i b i t i o n\n\n31\n\nExercise 2.1 Do you think the British government should fund film-making? What are the main sources of production finance for British film-makers or for film-makers outside the Hollywood system working on low or relatively low budget productions?\n\nP R E P R O D U C T I O N\n\nPreparation Once the funding has been secured, the film can enter the next stage of its life: preproduction. Research and planning for production can begin and development money is used to develop the outline script. The producer then assembles a complete package, overseeing and assisting in the hiring of the director and technical crew, in casting and in choosing locations. It is now the task of the producer to steer the film into production, and his/her role can be summarized as the conduit between the idea, the script and the marketplace. The producer has overall responsibility for production and mediates between the film and its financiers, yet beyond this the role is not precisely defined and can vary considerably. Some producers take a 'hands on' approach during production while others delegate to an associate producer who directly supervises the daily shooting. Sometimes there is a credit for an executive producer, usually the head of a studio or a production company, who will not be too closely involved as s/he will be supervising several films in various stages of production. The producer works closely with the director. A good working relationship between them is essential to the film's smooth progress, for where the producer is responsible for financial decisions the director is only concerned with artistic and technical ones. Since filmmaking is so expensive, a great deal of time and effort is spent meticulously planning and scheduling the shooting of the film in order to ensure that it runs as smoothly as possible. Planning covers all of the activities involved in preparing, editing and filming the script, including casting, finding locations, hiring technicians and other crew, organizing insurance, designers, accommodation and travel equipment. During preproduction the script will have been developed into a detailed screenplay, which is broken down into scenes and then storyboarded. This involves visualizing the script's narrative in a series of drawings that indicate the content of each shot and may also include audio information and camera instructions. A shooting schedule is then prepared, and before filming begins a production script is likely to be required. This not only gives script information but also provides written details on how the script is to be filmed, such as camera instructions, further audio information and guidance to actors. Once production has begun, a more precise budget than that proposed during the pitch will be finalized. Budgeting is divided further into above-the-line and below-the-line costs. Above-the-line costs include the salaries of the director, actors and crew whereas below-the-line costs refer to any other expenditure such as film stock, equipment hire, hotel costs, food, scenery and costumes.\n\n32\n\nC i n e m a a s l n s t i t u t i o n\n\nP R O D U C T I O N Production is the actual process of shooting the film. It is usually the most expensive stage in a film's life as it involves a large number of staff; hence the long credits at the end of a film! If the planning during preproduction has been carefully done, then the production should run smoothly and according to schedule. This is not always the case, however, and length of production varies from film to film. Kevin Costner's Waterworld (1995), for example, ran well over schedule and budget as it involved filming on the open sea subject to favourable weather conditions (see also Apocalypse Now, p. 22).\n\nKey Production Roles The following list is by no means comprehensive and does not cover all of the roles on a film. Some of the most important roles in production, however, are: â¢ â¢\n\nThe producer, see above. The line producer is responsible for the daily running of the production, in particular the day-to-day budget.\n\nâ¢\n\nThe scriptwriter develops the original script/screenplay. Some films may employ more than one writer as the script is written and rewritten even as the film is being shot (see the section on Casablanca, p. 14).\n\nâ¢\n\nThe director is the individual responsible for translating the script into a film. Arguably s/he is the most important individual on the set. S/he usually takes the artistic decisions regarding camera angles, type of shot, shot length, lighting, how the actors should interpret their roles, and editing. As with the producer, the role of the director varies according to each individual. Some may be described as metteurs en scene, basically skilled technicians, while others are referred to as auteurs - more like artists who attempt to stamp their own personal imprint upon the film (see Chapter 9 on Authorship).\n\nâ¢\n\nThe art director or production designer is responsible for set design (m/'se en scene) and graphics.\n\nâ¢\n\nThe cinematographer is also known as the director of photography or lighting cameraman and is responsible for the look' of a film, as s/he is in charge of camera technique. S/he translates the director's vision onto the screen, advising the director on camera lenses, angles, lighting and special effects.\n\nâ¢\n\nThe costume designer conceptualizes and supervises the characters' outfits and works closely with the art director.\n\nâ¢\n\nThe casting director selects and hires the support cast and negotiates fees with agents.\n\nâ¢\n\nThe camera operator physically operates the camera under the guidance of the cinematographer.\n\nâ¢\n\nThe assistant camera operator will help with camera movement, setting up the camera and operating controls, such as 'pulling focus'.\n\nâ¢\n\nThe assistant sound technician will often be involved in operating a boom microphone, which is directional, meaning that it only picks up sound from the area the operator is pointing it towards.\n\nP r o d u c t i o n ,\n\nD i s t r i b u t i o n\n\nand\n\nE x h i b i t i o n\n\n33\n\nImage Not Available\n\nDirector and camera operator at work on Apocalypse Now (Zoetrope/UA, courtesy Kobal)\n\nâ¢\n\nThe locations manager finds suitable locations for filming and negotiates their use.\n\nâ¢\n\nThe unit publicist promotes the film during production and collects useful publicity materials.\n\nâ¢\n\nThe sound technician is responsible for the complex process of recording sound. When recording 'live' sound during filming, recording levels have to be set low enough so as not to introduce distortion and high enough so that dialogue can be heard. Sound checks are carried out before recording.\n\nâ¢\n\nThe gaffer is responsible for the lighting under the direction of the cinematographer.\n\nâ¢\n\nThe best boy is the gaffer's assistant.\n\nâ¢\n\nThe key grip is in charge of all other stagehands, who are known as grips.\n\nP O S T P R O D U C T I O N The final part of the overall production process is postproduction. Once approved, the rushes (film shot that day) will be sent to the editor, who will begin to put together a rough cut of the film. Once filming is complete, the shots are selected and put together to form the completed film. All recorded material is logged; shot and take numbers are indicated with times, descriptions of each shot and appropriate comments on the quality of each take. The completion of the log sheet is followed by an edit decision list. This identifies the takes that have been selected for the final edited film, gives their order and includes any other information that is needed at the editing stage. Editing is the process of joining together the chosen takes in the appropriate order with the inclusion of any extra audio-visual material.\n\nFilm Editing The role of the editor is possibly the most important in imposing a narrative structure on the film. S/he supervises the splicing or cutting together of the many rolls of film shot during production into their final structure and will work closely with the director to ensure that\n\nFigure 2.2\n\n34\n\nC i n e m a\n\nas\n\nl n s t i t u t i o n\n\nhis/her vision is fulfilled. The editing process includes the selection, shaping, and arrangement of shots, scenes, sequences and special effects. The editor will assemble a rough cut from the daily rushes during production, and this will then be refined in postproduction to achieve the finished edit or fine cut.\n\nSound\n\nEditing\n\nThe dubbing mixer, much like the editor, assembles a single soundtrack from the multiple soundtracks recorded during production such as dialogue, music and sound effects (all sounds that are neither music nor dialogue). During film production sound is recorded separately from the film, and the two must then fit together so that the sounds match the images on screen. The soundtracks must also be mixed together at appropriate volumes. This may involve additional alterations to the tone of dialogue and frequently actors are recalled (sometimes months after production has finished) to re-record their lines. Sound effects are the responsibility of the foley team, who create appropriate noises for the images. The sound is then optically or digitally added to the film stock. The composer will work closely with the director to achieve the 'feel', atmosphere, mood, tension and emotion of the film. Frequently s/he will compose and often conduct an original score for the film in accordance with the director's wishes. Increasingly soundtracks are assembled from existing popular and classical music. The sound designer creates sounds for the film, many of which are specially created as they are not reality/earth-based (e.g. spaceships, extraterrestrial beings, etc.). The Special Effects Department creates a range of illusions to enhance the film that are unobtainable during production. These involve using optical effects such as front and rear projection, models, mechanical or physical effects such as fires, explosions, flying or falling objects, and increasingly computer-generated imagery. Graphic artists work on the titles and credits of the film.\n\nD I S T R I B U T I O N Once the director has approved the final cut, a preview screening is arranged for the distribution company. The distributor aims to exploit the film in order to profit from it or at the very least to recover the initial development and production costs. Effective distribution is fundamental to the film's success and many potentially prosperous films have failed at this point. In order to make a profit, a film must make roughly two and a half times its production costs at the box office. A distributor can acquire the distribution rights to a film by investing in it, by buying the rights after it has been made, or by being part of a larger company responsible for both production and distribution, such as a major Hollywood studio. Often the rights to distribute the video are acquired at the same time, which is a large source of revenue. A distribution company is subdivided into Publicity and Marketing (promotion), Film Sales (booking films into cinemas) and the Print Department (making copies of the film). The major distributors in the USA and the UK are UIP, Buena Vista, 20th Century Fox,\n\nP r o d u c t i o n ,\n\nD i s t r i b u t i o n\n\na n d\n\nE x h i b i t i o n\n\n35\n\nWarners and Columbia Tristar. Independent distributors include Entertainment, Polygram, Guild, Film Four, Rank, First Independent, Artificial Eye and Electric. Based on an estimation of what a film will make at the box office and through rentals, the print and advertising budget (referred to as the P & A budget) is created for marketing. This determines the amount the distributor is able to spend on promoting the film and getting it into cinemas. Again this is divided into above-the-line costs, such as advertising, and belowthe-line costs such as publicity, merchandise and flying in the stars. The distributor typically receives about 40 per cent of box office revenues, 30 per cent of which is spent on marketing, promotion, prints, certification and administration. Any money left over will then be paid to the producer, who will in turn pay the film's investors, artists, creditors and crew. The tasks of the distributor include: â¢ â¢\n\nacquiring a film; negotiating both the number and timing of the prints to be released to the exhibitors (distributors send hundreds and sometimes thousands of copies of each film to individual cinemas around the world, at approximately Â£1,000 per print This can cost more than Â£3m for a film on wide release);\n\nâ¢ â¢\n\narranging the distribution of these prints to the exhibitors; supplying the publicity material, advertising and trailers to the exhibitors in order to promote the film;\n\nâ¢\n\narranging promotional partnerships to tie in with the film (known as tie-ins);\n\nâ¢\n\ndubbing and subtitling foreign language films;\n\nâ¢\n\narranging and paying for a certificate;\n\nâ¢\n\nacquiring the rights to distribute the film on video.\n\nCertification/Classification Before a film can be screened to a paying audience in Britain it is a legal requirement that the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) classifies it. In the United States there is a similar rating system which, although not a legal requirement, makes it unlikely that a film will be screened without a certificate (for more on this process see the section on Regulation and Censorship below). Certification is important when targeting an audience since it will determine the age of the audience at which the marketing will need to be pitched. A distributor may want to maximize the potential audience and aim to achieve a particular classification, as lower categories are on the whole believed to be more commercially advantageous. Monty Python and the Holy Grail, for example, generated some amusing (and probably not untypical) correspondence about how much swearing to lose' (see Figure 2.3). The producers of the Bond films targeted the young teenage audience throughout the 1990s. In another instance, the distributors of The Mummy (1999) (Universal) wanted a '12' certificate for the film in the UK, but a hanging scene was deemed too graphic for such an audience. Universal were given a choice either to cut the offending scene or accept a higher classification. Since Universal wanted to maximize the potential audience, it cut 14 seconds from the scene and got its '12' classification. Similarly, Lethal Weapon 4 (1998) was\n\n36\n\nFigure 2.3\n\nC i n e m a\n\na s\n\nI n s t i t u t i o n\n\nMonty Python, swearing and certification\n\nvoluntarily re-edited at the request of the UK distributor in order to obtain a '15' certificate instead of the less profitable '18'. This was also because, in the words of the BBFC, 'the British audience preferred its entertainment with the blood-letting toned down' (BBFC, 1999 Report, p. 9). Voluntary cuts in trailers are often made to achieve a wider category in order to appeal to a broader audience. The BBFC has tried to encourage these commercial motives where they can be made to operate in the public interest. The standard cost to the distributor for the certification process is Â£837 (plus VAT) for a 90 minute English language feature film, which means that the per minute cost is about Â£9.\n\nMarketing Once a film is finished it becomes a product - something that needs to be sold. The aim of marketing is to raise awareness of the product. Audiences must be informed that a film exists, their interest in it must be aroused and they must be persuaded to go and see something they neither necessarily need nor want. This is the job of the distributor. Marketing a film often begins months before a film is released, creating anticipation in audiences that it is coming to a nearby cinema soon. The distributor devises a marketing strategy so that the film finds its audience, and needs to determine the prime target audience at which the film will be aimed. In order to do this the distributor conducts audience research. Preview screenings are set up whereby the\n\nP r o d u c t i o n ,\n\nD i s t r i b u t i o n\n\nand\n\nE x h i b i t i o n\n\n37\n\ndistributor can receive a range of opinions and reactions to the film, which can be a good indication of the prime target audience. The distributor will also turn to regular weekly research known as tracking undertaken by the National Research Group. The process of marketing can be divided into three areas. â¢ Advertising: the distributor devises an advertising campaign using trailers, posters and radio, newspaper and TV spots, all of which are carefully tested. Interviews are conducted to ascertain a response and TV and radio slots are scheduled in order to reach the target audience. The campaign must be consistent so that the audience receives a single message about the film. Usually this message is based around a film's unique selling point (USP) - that single thing that differentiates it from other films - which could be the director, the stars, the plot or the special effects"
