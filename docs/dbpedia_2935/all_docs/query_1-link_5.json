        "text": "Join a Discussion on Movies\n\neith Froelich's crude black-and-white film \"The Toilers and the Wayfarers\" takes a potentially incendiary theme -- closeted gay teen-agers in the Midwest, fleeing a repressive small town for the big city (Minneapolis) -- and fumbles it badly. New Ulm, the stuffy German-American community they leave, is a place where everyone from the high school gym teacher to the runaways' parents leaps at the chance to administer a spanking. The three teen-agers who join forces include a recent German immigrant named Udo (Ralf Schirg), whose loutish father (a former Nazi SS officer) is only too happy to ship him abroad to a maiden aunt, and his new American acquaintances, Dieter (Matt Klemp), with whom he converses in German, and Phillip (Andrew Woodhouse), an effeminate high school pariah.\n\nExcept for Schirg's sullen, dissipated Udo, who is mesmerized by American television and flashy cars, the performances are excruciatingly inept and self-conscious in the film. Although a lot happens to the boys (Phillip and Dieter resort to street prostitution to survive, and Dieter is arrested for soliciting), Froelich's meandering, dramatically flat screenplay fails to make these painful life experiences credible or compelling. Only the cinematography (by Jim Tittle) begins to suggest a grittiness that is undermined by the terrible acting."
