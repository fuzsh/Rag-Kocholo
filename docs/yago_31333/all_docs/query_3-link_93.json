        "text": "International society’s newest and most diverting couple are none other than Princess Firyal of Jordan, long the exotic love of the late Greek shipping giant Stavros Niarchos, and Muck Flick, whose vast fortune derives from the Mercedes-Benz empire. They are everywhere together in London, where Firyal has a magnificent house and adjoining park-like garden right in the middle of Mayfair, and Muck has an even more magnificent one, if you want to be tit-for-tatty about it. It was at Muck’s place that he and Firyal gave a recent party for his birthday, which brought out the whipped cream of social locals — make that local socials — and then some. Firyal is one fabulous firecracker who delights in stirring things up, and apparently she has stirred up Muck, who was looking rather dour of late after a nasty divorce from his wife, Donatella, and an even nastier hit on his wallet, a settlement involving millions and millions of pounds. So now it’s fun and games with Firyal and a trip together to New York to sing along with The Three Tenors at Giants Stadium on Saturday night. Sweet.\n\n*\n\nKenneth Branagh has just been set for the lead in “The Gingerbread Man” which will start shooting in October. John Grisham has written the screenplay, his first original screenplay, and it will be produced by Mark Burg for Island Pictures. Luis Mandoki (“When A Man Loves A Woman”) will direct, and everyone is hoping against hope to get Annette Bening for the female lead. In the movie, Branagh plays a small town southern lawyer — he’s so clever at accents — and the movie will probably be shot in Savannah just before Clint Eastwood begins filming “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil” there.\n\n*\n\nFollowers of Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy are convinced he has White House ambitions for the millennium; in Boston’s Back Bay circles, they buzz about it constantly. Kennedy is said to feel frustrated as a congressman ever since the Republicans became top dogs, weakening his political muscle. Also, even if the Democrats regain control of Congress, Joe K. will definitely run for governor of Massachusetts in 1998. Just now, his heart is on the economy of his home state rather than on Washington’s political charades. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n*\n\nSuch excitement in lofty circles about the world’s most advanced new private jet, the Gulfstream G-V, financier Teddy Forstmann’s newest baby. The price tag is $35 million — Unfurnished. Edgar Bronfman Jr., who runs things at Seagram’s and MCA/Universal, gets the first one off the assembly line this October. If you look closely, you can see the G-I, G-II, G-III and G-IV owners turn pea-green.\n\n*\n\nAn unauthorized paperback biography on Michael Douglas is said to be in the works, but if it arrives as described it is Diandra Douglas, Michael’s wife, who will bear the scandalous brunt of it. The writer has obtained copies of her Washington D.C. birth certificate, copies of her father, Robert Luker’s Norfolk, Virginia, birth certificate and other information relating to her upbringing and past, which claims it’s not as Diandra tells it at all in various interviews. True or false, the paperback will contend that it was Michael, not Diandra, who has wanted a divorce for years, not Michael pleading with Diandra to stay in the marriage as has been publicized. Whatever, Diandra filed for divorce in June, and is now seen everywhere with Santa Barbara landscape artist Ken Slaught, whom she once hired to design the gardens at the Douglas’ Montecito estate. (And have I ever cleaned this story up!) Reportedly, Michael has yet to answer Diandra’s divorce petition, but the lawyer representing him is Robert Kaufman of Beverly Hills. Dennis Wasser, Diandra’s lawyer, one hears, claims the divorce is on hold. This, of course, has been a terribly troubled marriage for years. The big mystery is how it lasted as long as it did.\n\n*\n\nAndie MacDowell, now in “Multiplicity,” will next be seen in “Michael” opposite John Travolta, wherein she plays a thrice-married dog trainer who warbles country-western on occasion. Did you evah? Oh, and Andie and Travolta have been talking about doing another movie together, a fantasy about redneck society types called “Dear Dierdre.” Andie says while they were making “Michael,” she and John played a sort of “game,” acting out mythical characters, i.e., society types speaking in redneck tones and accents. (When you find out what a redneck society type is, tell me.)\n\n*\n\nLauren Bacall, just one of the many celebs who were in Paris last week for the haute couture shows, flew back to New York on the Concorde along with a planeload of supers, including Kate Moss. The flight was not exactly heaven for Bacall, who was openly agitated about being held up on line at the customs area, plus being detained on the plane when her coat got stuck in the door on her way out of the lavatory. Shoot! Our heroine did break out in a smile though when she stopped to play with a little Maltese at the airport and inquired about its barking habits. Bacall told the dog’s owner that she is considering buying a Maltese or a Pekingese. Stop the presses.\n\n*\n\nMusic Notes From All Over: The latest upper-crusty musical group in London, Fin de Siecle, fronted by an Old Etonian guitarist, specializes in what they call drawing room rock, whatever that means. Their first single is all about a socialite (but not a redneck one), the recently married Cosima von Bulow, Claus’s daughter. Stop the presses.\n\n*\n\n“It’s important for someone traveling on the road to have two tiaras. You never know when you’re going to get invited to something really informal.” Advice from Princess Diana, who doesn’t know how to keep her trap shut? From Queen Elizabeth, a regal paragon? From RuPaul? Please. It’s the latest word from Elton John, who, for some silly reason, is not on the short-list to take over from Gianfranco FerrA at the House of Dior.\n\n*\n\nThe Newport season officially began with the big 4th of July dance at Bailey’s Beach where the elite go to eat and have fun Newport-style. Then there was Irene Aiken’s black-tie dinner at her lovely house, Champs Soleil on Bellevue Avenue, and Ruth Buchanan’s splendid lunch at her also-lovely house, Beaulieu, which is, of course, right on the ocean. But the BIG news is the arrival of the Prince of Wales in the resort on Thursday for a glamorous formal dinner dance at the New York Yacht Club to benefit the Mary Rose Trust, of which he is president. (The Mary Rose was King Henry VIII’s flagship, discovered in shallow water and salvaged. It is currently in dry dock in Portsmouth as a museum.) Naturally, there are American Friends of the Mary Rose Trust — there are American Friends of everything — and it is they who are giving the dinner honoring Prince Charles. Bob Hardwick and his band have been instructed to play NON-dance music while His Royal Highness is in attendance, so they are busily trying to find some. As for Prince Charles, he will be in New York this very night giving his very own private dinner at the Frick Museum for 80 or so hand-picked guests. But more of all this in Friday’s column."
