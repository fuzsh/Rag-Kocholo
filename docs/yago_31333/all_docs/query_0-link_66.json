        "text": "Christmas in Motion: Baking with the Bernadottes\n\nCrown Princess Victoria, Princess Estelle, and Prince Daniel celebrate Christmas 2013 (screencapture)\n\nTis the season for holiday cheer, magpies! Today, we’re giving the bling a bit of a rest to focus on something even more precious: adorable GIFs of Sweden’s crown princely family baking Christmas cookies a few years ago. Enjoy!\n\nThis footage was taken as a part of the family’s Christmas greetings in 2013\n\nBack then, Victoria and Daniel had been married for three and a half years, and they had one child: their daughter, Princess Estelle\n\nEstelle was almost two when this footage was taken; she became a big sister when Prince Oscar was born in 2016\n\nThe Bernadottes have a tradition of releasing footage of cozy family scenes in the kitchen; similar video of Crown Princess Victoria with her parents and siblings was released in the 1980s\n\nThe casual images show a different side of a family that includes two future monarchs of Sweden\n\nCrown Princess Victoria will one day become Sweden’s first female monarch in three centuries\n\nAnd baby Estelle, who already showed an adorable independent streak in this video, will become Sweden’s fifth queen regnant\n\nAppropriately, she already knew how to make a dramatic entrance and exit!\n\nThis Week in Royal Jewels: December 15-21\n\nDecember 15-21, 2017\n\nIt’s the last weekly jewel review of the year — we’re taking next week off for year-in-review posts — so I made sure it was an extra sparkly one! Don’t forget to vote for your favorites in the poll below!\n\nYANN COATSALIOU/AFP/Getty Images\n\n15.

Princess Firyal, the former wife of Prince Muhammad bin Talal of Jordan, sparkled in major earrings at the Berggruen Prize Gala at the New York Public Library on Friday; not sure whether the sparkle on her dress is a brooch or an embellishment, but I’m enjoying it either way.\n\nVictoria Jones – WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\n4. In the Wales/Cornwall Christmas card this year, the Duchess of Cornwall wears her diamond floral suite; the photograph was taken at her private 70th birthday dinner, held at Highgrove in July.\n\nJONAS EKSTROMER/AFP/Getty Images\n\n3.

My top vote of the week, no question, goes to the Hesse Diamond Jubilee Brooch, worn by the Duchess of Cornwall at the Olympia Horse Show on Friday.

Our bonus jewel of the week: another great view of Meghan Markle’s engagement ring, courtesy of the romantic engagement pictures released by Kensington Palace on Thursday. Love it!\n\nRoyal Blue Topazes\n\nAndreas Rentz/Getty Images\n\nIf you’re a December baby (like me!), one of your birthstones is the icy blue gem we’re celebrating today: the vibrant blue topaz. Today, I’ve got several examples of royal jewels set with this lovely blue gemstones for us to enjoy.\n\nMARTIN SYLVEST/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCrown Princess Mary of Denmark wears a pair of large statement earrings set with blue topazes and embellished with sapphires and diamonds. The earrings were made by Annikat, a jewelry firm that has featured more than once in Mary’s jewelry wardrobe. Above, she wears the blue topaz earrings for the 100th anniversary of Copenhagen Business School in March 2017.\n\nSean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge is a huge fan of blue topazes, and her jewelry collection includes several pieces set with the stone. For a visit to Berlin in July 2017, Kate wore earrings and a necklace set with blue topazes; the jewels come from one of her favorite brands, Kiki McDonough.\n\nIan Gavan/Getty Images\n\nKiki McDonough was also the creator of these striking hoop earrings, the “Lola” model, which are also set with blue topazes. The circle design of these earrings has made them very appropriate choices for events related to the Olympics. Above, Kate also wears them in July 2012 for a Creative Industries Reception at the Royal Academy of Arts.\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nThe Robinson Pelham Pagoda Earrings, also set with blue topazes, have been worn by more than one member of the Middleton family. Kate chose them for the premiere of Spectre in October 2015.\n\nAndreas Rentz/Getty Images\n\nI don’t have absolute confirmation, but I suspect that these statement earrings, favorites of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, are also set with blue topazes. Victoria has worn them for years, and recently she chose them for one of the events celebrating her 40th birthday in July 2017."
