        "text": "Mr Safadi said officials had tried to discourage the prince rather than take legal action against him, but that Prince Hamzah had “dealt with this request negatively”. He noted that dialogue was ongoing.\n\nRegional powers including Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia have voiced support for King Abdullah in the wake of the operation.\n\nThe United States, which is allied with Jordan in its campaign against the Islamic State (IS) group, described the monarch as a key partner who has its full support.\n\nTensions within the royal household had been visible for some time, Jordanian journalist Rana Sweis told the BBC.\n\n“The former crown prince is also seen as popular. He has a very candid resemblance to his father, King Hussein, and he is also very popular with the local tribes,” she said.\n\nAnother member of the royal family waded into the row on Twitter on Sunday night, hitting out at Queen Noor and suggesting it was a dispute over succession rights.\n\n“Grow up Boys,” posted Princess Firyal, the ex-wife of the brothers’ uncle, Prince Muhammad bin Talal.\n\nSource: BBC"
