In her note, the Queen said she was \"saddened to learn of the tragic loss of life.\" As of this afternoon, the death toll had reached 150.\n\nMeanwhile, via her popular Twitter account, Jordan's Queen Rania reached out to the typhoon-stricken Philippines, tweeting, \"My thoughts are with the traumatized children and their families.\"Spain's royal family isn't getting a pay raise this year: its annual budget was frozen by the Spanish government, perhaps in recognition of the country's recession, the worst it has experienced in decades. The royals' situation is not as dire as it might seem—the freeze just means that next year King Juan Carlos and his family will have to live on $15 million, as they do this year. Let's hope the stylish family's Princess Letizia doesn't mourn the loss of her increased allowance by following the goth look.\n\nDenmark's Prince Joachim and his wife, glowing and slender new mother Princess Marie, made a photogenic couple at their close friends' wedding. So close that the groom acted as godfather at this summer's christening of the royal couple's infant son, Prince Henrik.\n\nAnd in Manhattan, royal worlds collide at the New York Public Library: the institution's Lionel Pincus and Princess Firyal Map Division—named for the library patrons and Royal Watch regulars—houses an exhibition celebrating Netherlands–New York relations just in time for our exclusive interview with Dutch royals Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess Maxima.\n\nRoyals\n\nQueen Camilla: Everything to Know About the Queen of the UK\n\nCamilla Parker Bowles’s life—from her scandalous relationship with Charles to becoming queen—has long intrigued the public.\n\nTelevision\n\nBrian Jordan Alvarez’s English Teacher Has an Angle but Doesn’t Feel Like Homework\n\nIts creators hope this sharp, silly FX series can be “a microcosm of all the stupid arguments that everyone’s having with each other all the time.”\n\nBusiness\n\nRupert Murdoch’s Family Battle Proves He’s Losing Control\n\nThe media mogul is scrambling to protect Fox News from three of his politically moderate heirs. It’s a sign of Rupert’s waning influence. “Murdoch is no longer the pope,” one political vet says.\n\nCelebrity\n\nBlues Legend John Mayall Is Dead at 90\n\nA giant of the great British blues boom of the 1960s was a musical change-agent who revered and honored his forebears."
