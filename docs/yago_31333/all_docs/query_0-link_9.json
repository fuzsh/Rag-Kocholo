        "text": "Wedding of Crown Prince Kardam of Bulgaria and doña Miriam de Ungría y López in 1996\n\nThe Crown Princely couple with their first son Boris\n\nCrown Prince Kardam and Crown Princess Miriam with their sons\n\nOn 2 September 1963 at Madrid, Spain, Dowager Princess Miriam of Turnovo was born as Doña Miriam Ungría y López, the daughter of Don Bernardo Ungría y Goiburu and Doña María del Carmen López y Oleaga (d.2019). Miriam has a degree in history and geography, with a concentration in art history, from the Complutense University of Madrid. She later studied gemology, jewellery manufacturing, wax molding, gemstone setting, and jewellery design at the University of Oviedo's European Centre of Gemology and Jewellery. Miriam created her own fashion line under the name \"MdeU.\"\n\nOn 7 July 1996 at the Santos Andrés y Demetrio Orthodox Church in Madrid, Doña Miriam Ungría y López married Crown Prince Kardam of Bulgaria, Prince of Turnovo (b.Madrid 2 December 1962). Kardam was the eldest child of King Simeon II of Bulgaria (b.1937) and Queen Margarita (b.1935; née Gómez-Acebo y Cejuela). Prince Kardam and Princess Miriam had two sons, Prince Boris (b.1997) and Prince Beltran (b.1999), who were both christened in the Orthodox faith. On 15 August 2008, Kardam and Miriam were involved in a serious motor vehicle accident in Madrid: both the prince and princess sustained severe injuries. Miriam was able to recover from the incident; however, Kardam's condition and the traumatic brain injury from the accident had left him in a coma. Although she had remained a Roman Catholic when they married, Princess Miriam converted to the Orthodox faith as an expression of empathy to her husband and their family. Tragically, Crown Prince Kardam died on 7 April 2015 in Madrid; he had been in a coma for almost seven years. Kardam's death was an indescribable blow to his wife, their sons, and his parents and extended family.\n\nPrince Mohammad and Princess Firyal with their two sons, Prince Talal and Prince Ghazi.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and Prince Ghazi during a visit to Jordan of the British heir in 2013.\n\nPhoto (c) Getty Images / Chris Jackson.\n\nQueen Sonja and King Harald V of Norway with Prince Ghazi and Queen Rania of Jordan, 2021.\n\nPhoto (c) Getty Images / Khalil Mazraawi.\n\nOn 15 October 1966 at Amman, Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad was born as the son of Prince Muhammad bin Talal (1940–2021) and his first wife Princess Firyal (b.1945; née Irshaid). Prince Ghazi's uncle was the late King Hussein of Jordan, and the prince is a first cousin of Jordan's current king, Abdullah II. Prince Ghazi attended Harrow School in the United Kingdom. He went on to graduate with a bachelors degree in comparative literature from Princeton University in 1988. Prince Ghazi obtained a Ph.D. in Modern and Medieval Languages and Literatures from Trinity College, University of Cambridge. His thesis was entitled \"What is Falling in Love?: A Study of the Literary Archetype of Love.\" The prince holds the position of Chief Advisor to King Abdullah II for Religious and Cultural Affairs and Personal Envoy of King Abdullah II. Prince Ghazi has served as regent for the king in the past.\n\nFrom their marriage on 4 May 1997 until their divorce in 2021, Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad was married to Princess Areej Ghazi (née Zawawi). The couple had four children: Princess Tasneem (b.1999), Prince Abdullah (b.2001), Princess Jennah (b.2003), and Princess Salsabeel (b.2014). On 18 May 2021, the Royal Hashemite Court announced that Princess Areej Ghazi's title had changed to Princess Areej bint Omar Al Zawawi. These sorts of announcements are typically used by the court to indicate a divorce, which was indeed the case with Ghazi and Areej."
