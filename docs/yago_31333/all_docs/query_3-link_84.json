        "text": "Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, co-stars in the longest-running British entertainment since \"Upstairs Downstairs\" and now one that the children can finally be permitted to watch, began a week's visit to the United States in New York yesterday, their first official overseas tour since their marriage last April.\n\nBilled by the British government as an opportunity for the two countries to affirm their \"common bonds and shared tradition,\" the couple's visit began yesterday with a morning trip to ground zero. Later, with the prince wearing a poppy, the British symbol for Remembrance Day, in his lapel, the couple unveiled a cornerstone at what is to be the British Memorial Garden, in Hanover Square, and met privately with the families of some of the 67 Britons killed in the attacks of Sept. 11.\n\n\"It was terribly, terribly moving,\" the duchess said later that evening at a reception at the Museum of Modern Art. \"I think they're terribly glad to have the garden.\"\n\nDid she talk with them about their experience? \"Yes, I always get straight to the point, which I probably shouldn't.\"\n\nIs there a tabloid reporter alive who does not know the love story of the Prince of Wales and the woman known for a long time as Mrs. Parker Bowles, the world's most famous backstreet girl? He wore her gift of cufflinks on his honeymoon with Princess Diana, made vivid declarations of love over unsecured phone lines and admitted adultery on TV. When the prince and Mrs. Bowles married, the queen did not attend the civil ceremony, although she did have someone sketch them up a nice coat of arms.\n\nNow, those in-law troubles seem to be patched up: A week ago Elizabeth II lent Camilla a tiara to wear at a state banquet for the king and queen of Norway -- not one the queen is believed to have ever worn, mind you, but something made for Queen Mary in 1911, sort of the royal equivalent of your mother-in-law letting you wear her second-best mink.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
