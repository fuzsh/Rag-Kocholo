        "meta_description": "After a long illness, New York City financier and philanthropist Lionel Pincus passed away on Saturday at his Upper East Side residence. He was 78. Despite his death, it appears that Pincus's two sons will continue their vicious estate battle with his longtime girlfriend, Princess Firyal of Jordan. Initiated this summer, Matthew and Henry Pincus's lawsuit claims that the Princess, the first wife of Jordan's Prince Muhammad bin Talal (brother to the late King Hussein I), took advantage of their father's deteriorating mental and physical state by spending extravagant sums to decorate a $50 million, 14-room duplex in the city's Pierre Hotel. As loyal Royal Watchers know, the suit also alleges that the Princess had Lionel Pincus change his will—giving the royal his art collection, a lavish apartment, and $35 million in cash—when he was too sickly to understand the paperwork. The allegations seem to resemble the conditions surrounding the Brooke Astor trial, which last week resulted in a guilty verdict for Astor's son, Anthony Marshall.",

The two were snapped rushing out of London's Whiskey Mist toward a waiting car that sped them away with another couple. Earlier that evening, a V.I.P. section in the club had hosted Harry and his cousins Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice.\n\nRoyal sisters-in-law Princess Mary and Princess Marie stole the show at the opening of Danish parliament last week. Mary, wife of Prince Frederik, wore a long-sleeved black dress with beige heels and a coordinating wide-brimmed hat, while Prince Joachim's Marie wore a sweeping forest-green coat. An intricate updo and green beret with black feather detailing gave the latter Princess's outfit an intriguing edge.\n\nRoyals\n\nPrince Harry Says Meghan Markle Isn’t Safe in the UK: “All It Takes Is One Lone Actor”\n\nIn a recent interview about his ongoing legal battles against a handful of British tabloids, the prince said the danger is that it only takes “one person who reads this stuff to act on what they have read.”\n\nStyle\n\nInside Kensington Palace: Explore the Royal Family’s Storied Home\n\nKensington Palace may be smaller than nearby Buckingham Palace, but its history is far richer and much more scandalous.\n\nRoyals\n\nPrince William Just Made Bank In His First Year on a $30 Million Royal Salary\n\nThe head of the Duchy of Cornwall is a cushy gig if you can get it.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Dark Questions Netflix’s Lou Pearlman Doc Dirty Pop Doesn’t Answer\n\nThe new docuseries rehashes Pearlman’s audacious Ponzi scheme and impact on ’90s pop culture while glossing over the darker allegations that shadowed the late boy-band manager."
