        "text": "A Jordanian princess has been living like a queen thanks to the millions she’s received from her elderly, mentally incapacitated boyfriend, sensational court papers claim.\n\nJet-setting Princess Firyal allegedly has already burned through $62 million of legendary investor Lionel Pincus’ fortune — at one point blowing $5 million in just six months.\n\nFiryal spent tens of millions of dollars of Pincus’ money on necessities such as $45,000 wall sconces, a $66,000 mirror and $132,000 desk — and taken advantage of his failing health to ensure that she can live royally after the 78-year-old dies, the Manhattan court filings say.\n\n“Not satisfied with spending Mr. Pincus’ money during his lifetime, Princess Firyal — who is approximately 17 years younger than Mr. Pincus — set out to alter Mr. Pincus’ estate plan to benefit herself after his passing,” says the suit, which was filed on behalf of the investing legend’s two kids.\n\nIn the three years after the famed Warburg Pincus co-founder was diagnosed with cancer, the amounts of money and property he plans to leave his royal consort have skyrocketed, the filing says.\n\nWhile the princess originally would have had to make do with a $10 million lump payout and then $5 million a year after Pincus’ death, she now stands to get one $45 million payment, $55 million in property and then $8 million a year in payments — and millions more in art and furniture, the filings say.\n\nBut Pincus’ sons are fighting back.\n\nThey are seeking a court order allowing them to finally sell their father’s $50 million apartment in the Pierre Hotel.\n\nThe sons, Matthew and Henry Pincus, wouldn’t see a penny from the sale, the filing says. The proceeds would go back into a charitable trust that was established by their dad.\n\nThey’re just trying to keep it out of the princess’s clutches, the filing says.\n\nHer Royal Highness, who landed her title when she married the younger brother of Jordan’s late King Hussein, was not amused by the charges.\n\n“Princess Firyal has been the love of Lionel Pincus’ later life. Her every action has always been to care for him and preserve his well-being. She is shocked and pained by [the] public accusations,” said her spokesman, Jim McCarthy.\n\nThe Pincuses’ lawyer, William Zabel, had a different take.\n\n“This case is a classic example of an elderly, incapacitated person being taken advantage of by someone he trusted,” Zabel said.\n\nPincus and the princess became involved in the 1990s.\n\nThe suit says the royal divorcée “has a long history of dating wealthy men, including the billionaire Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos,” a relationship that began “when she was 31 and he was 67.”\n\nWhen the princess turned to Pincus, she eagerly began plowing through his money, spending over $4 million a year in 2002 and 2003, which started to annoy the elderly moneyman, the filings show.\n\nIn a September 2003 letter to the princess attached to the suit, Pincus wrote, “Here is your history of personal expenses. I find them to be unacceptable for clothes, etc. It seems unreasonable, and I think you have a problem, which in turn is a problem for me.”\n\nHe was diagnosed with cancer soon after, and as he was undergoing treatment and his health went downhill, the princess’s spending got wilder — she went through $7.7 million in 2004, $9 million in 2005 and over $5 million during a six-month period in 2006, the suit says.\n\nThe spending sputtered to a halt that fall, when a judge declared Pincus to be incapacitated and unable to tend to his own affairs. That led to another payday for the princess, the suit says, because she’d had him sign papers saying she would get $10 million if he was declared mentally unfit.\n\nAdditional reporting by Amber Sutherland"
