        "text": "This Week in Royal Jewels: December 15-21\n\nDecember 15-21, 2017\n\nIt’s the last weekly jewel review of the year — we’re taking next week off for year-in-review posts — so I made sure it was an extra sparkly one! Don’t forget to vote for your favorites in the poll below!\n\nYANN COATSALIOU/AFP/Getty Images\n\n15. Princess Charlene of Monaco wore teeny sparkling stud earrings for the annual Children’s Christmas event at the Palais de Princier on Wednesday.\n\nLISE AASERUD/AFP/Getty Images\n\n14. A golden necklace and a Christmas tree pin were Queen Sonja of Norway’s jewelry choices for Wednesday’s Christmas photo session at the palace in Oslo.\n\nCarlos Alvarez/Getty Images\n\n13. Infanta Margarita (an aunt of King Felipe VI of Spain) wore pearls and a lovely floral brooch for the Padre Arrupe Foundation Christmas charity concert on Tuesday in Madrid.\n\nBART MAAT/AFP/Getty Images\n\n12. Queen Maxima of the Netherlands wore sparkling stud earrings and a coordinating necklace for dinner with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in The Hague on Thursday.\n\nDANIEL MIHAILESCU/AFP/Getty Images\n\n11. In Bucharest, Queen Silvia of Sweden wore multicolored pearls and a golden brooch to mourn the late King Michael of Romania on Saturday.\n\nDANIEL MIHAILESCU/AFP/Getty Images\n\n10. Queen Sofia of Spain, who was King Michael’s first cousin, wore multicolored pearls and stacks of gold rings as she celebrated the late monarch’s life in Romania on Saturday.\n\nDANIEL MIHAILESCU/AFP/Getty Images\n\n9. Sofia wore pearls, golden earrings, and an interesting brooch on Friday at the former royal palace in Bucharest (now the National Arts Museum), where King Michael’s body lay in state.\n\nCarlos Alvarez/Getty Images\n\n8. Queen Letizia of Spain wore her bezel-set diamond and Australian pearl drop earrings on Monday for the Accion Magistral Awards in Madrid.\n\nDANIEL MIHAILESCU/AFP/Getty Images\n\n7. At King Michael’s state funeral in Romania on Saturday, Queen Anne-Marie of Greece wore diamond and pearl earrings, layered necklaces, and an interesting pearl clip brooch.\n\nDANIEL MIHAILESCU/AFP/Getty Images\n\n6. Also attending the funeral: Princess Astrid of Belgium, who wore glittering earrings and a sparkling ring, and Princess Muna of Jordan (mother of the present king) who wore pearls.\n\nNicholas Hunt/Getty Images for Berggruen Institute\n\n5. Princess Firyal, the former wife of Prince Muhammad bin Talal of Jordan, sparkled in major earrings at the Berggruen Prize Gala at the New York Public Library on Friday; not sure whether the sparkle on her dress is a brooch or an embellishment, but I’m enjoying it either way.\n\nVictoria Jones – WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\n4. In the Wales/Cornwall Christmas card this year, the Duchess of Cornwall wears her diamond floral suite; the photograph was taken at her private 70th birthday dinner, held at Highgrove in July.\n\nJONAS EKSTROMER/AFP/Getty Images\n\n3. On Wednesday, Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden wore the slim diamond earrings from the Brazilian Parure and one of the family’s diamond bow brooches for the annual meeting of the Swedish Academy in Stockholm.\n\nJONAS EKSTROMER/AFP/Getty Images\n\n2. For the Swedish academy meeting, Queen Silvia chose heirloom Bernadotte diamonds, including the Karl Johan earrings and one of the family’s lovely diamond brooches.\n\nSteve Parsons – WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\n1. My top vote of the week, no question, goes to the Hesse Diamond Jubilee Brooch, worn by the Duchess of Cornwall at the Olympia Horse Show on Friday. (Much more on this heirloom piece over here!)\n\nAlexi Lubomirski via Getty Images\n\n…but wait, there’s more! Our bonus jewel of the week: another great view of Meghan Markle’s engagement ring, courtesy of the romantic engagement pictures released by Kensington Palace on Thursday. Love it!\n\nQueen Rania Shines at Parliament\n\nKHALIL MAZRAAWI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nQueen Rania of Jordan was in the capital city of Amman on Sunday to attend the opening of the ordinary session of parliament. For the occasion, she combined businesswear with sparkling jewels.\n\nKHALIL MAZRAAWI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRania’s accessories for the day were a combination of modern, traditional, and functional.\n\nKHALIL MAZRAAWI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nShe wore multiple earrings on her right ear, including hoops and an ear climber. These are definitely edgier pieces than we often see on a queen, but they fit in with Rania’s general jewelry style.\n\nKHALIL MAZRAAWI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn her left wrist, she wore a smartwatch. This image also provides us with an excellent view of the unusual diamond ring on her left hand."
