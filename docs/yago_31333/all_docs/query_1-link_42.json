        "text": "AKA Lionel Irwin Pincus\n\nBorn: 2-Mar-1931\n\nBirthplace: Philadelphia, PA\n\nDied: 10-Oct-2009\n\nLocation of death: Manhattan, NY\n\nCause of death: unspecified\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Business\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Co-Founder, Warburg Pincus\n\nUpon graduation from college, Lionel Pincus eschewed the family garment business and instead obtained an MBA and joined 75-year-old investment banking firm Ladenburg Thalmann, becoming a partner in 1960. After four years he left to form his own firm, which soon merged with E. M. Warburg to become legendary takeover/LBO enterprise Warburg Pincus. Since its founding, Warburg Pincus has invested nearly $30B in over 600 companies. Pincus married an actress, Suzanne Storrs, with whom he had two sons. After her death he began a relationship with Princess Firyal of Jordan, described by some as a golddigger. They shared a $22M (perhaps now worth $50M) Manhattan apartment, and Firyal spent millions on furnishings, including $750,000 on a pair of Tang Dynasty pottery horses often noted in press stories. Pincus' will was rewritten to provide for Firyal by giving her a lump sum of $35M, the apartment and extensive art collection, though these arrangements are challenged by his sons, who assumed guardianship of their father in 2006 as his mental capacity diminished. Firyal contends that their relationship began when his mind was still acute, enjoyed many happy years, and that she cared for Pincus during his long bout with cancer as the sons were conspicuously absent. Both Henry and Matthew already have generous trust funds and stand to inherit their father's private island.\n\nFather: Henry Pincus (d. 1949)\n\nMother: Theresa Celia Levit (d. 1982)\n\nWife: Suzanne Storrs Poulton (actress, m. 1967, d. 1995, two sons)\n\nSon: Henry\n\nSon: Matthew\n\nGirlfriend: Princess Firyal of Jordan (cohabited since 1996/98)\n\nUniversity: BA English, University of Pennsylvania (1953)\n\nUniversity: MBA, Columbia University (1956)\n\nAdministrator: Trustee, School of American Ballet\n\nAdministrator: Trustee, Columbia University\n\nWarburg Pincus Partner (1966-2002)\n\nLionel I.
