He was an electrical engineer proud of his MIT degree, in his youth a passionate radio ham who never trusted Hugo Gernsback's magazines because some of the technology didn't work well. He did not often read fiction for pleasure until late in life. I got love of science and technology from him.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis part has not changed since last year. The existence of Locus and Tangents makes doing an annual anthology easier and I thank them both for their devotion to considering the short fiction published each year in the SF field. Secondly, I am grateful to the publishers of the SF magazines for continuing the uphill battle to stay in business and publish fiction in 1998.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlexander Jablokov\n\nMarket Report\n\nGregory Benford\n\nA Dance to Strange Musics\n\nNoman Spinrad\n\nThe Year of the Mouse\n\nMary Soom Lee\n\nThe Day Before They Came\n\nRob Chilson\n\nThis Side of Independence\n\nStephen Baxter\n\nThe Twelfth Album\n\nTed Chiang\n\nStory of Your Life\n\nRobert Reed\n\nWhiptail\n\nMary Rosenblum\n\nThe Eye of God\n\nMichael F.

Hartwell\n\nCredits\n\nCopyright\n\nAbout the Publisher\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt has been another exciting year in the SF field for short fiction. In my survey of the works published, more good original collections cropped up from England and Australia and Canada than in any previous year. And the fiction magazines each had a bunch of good stories. So I must make my usual disclaimer, with perhaps more force than usual: this selection of science fiction stories represents the best that was published during the year 1998. In my opinion I could perhaps have filled two or three more volumes this size and then claimed to have nearly all of the best—though not all the best novellas.\n\nRegular readers of this anthology will notice the absence of several familiar names, so let me point out that they have neither stopped writing nor is the quality of their work any less excellent than in other years. I believe that representing the best, while it is not physically possible to encompass it all in one even very large book, also implies presenting some substantial variety of excellences, and I left some writers out in order to include others in this limited space.\n\nNext, my general principle for selection: this book is full of science fiction—every story in the book is clearly that and not something else. I have a high regard for horror, fantasy, speculative fiction, and slipstream and postmodern literature. But here, I chose science fiction. It is the intention of this year's best series to focus entirely on science fiction, and to provide readers who are looking especially for science fiction an annual home base.\n\nAfter what I perceived as a mediocre year for novellas in 1997, 1998 was a strong year—there were fifteen or more good novellas—but '98 was at least as satisfying in all the shorter forms. SF Age had another strong year, as did Asimov's; they are unquestionably at the top of the field, and have quite similar tastes in the fiction they publish. There was less SF in F&SF and in Interzone, but some dynamite stuff in each, and some top-notch stories in the newly revived Amazing. Analog was uneven, publishing some of the best, and some of the worst stories. On Spec, form Canada, and Eidolon, form Australia, are generating some first-class writers with excellent stories, too, sometimes SF and sometimes horror or fantasy, as in Interzone.\n\nNotable SF original anthologies include Starlight 2, edited by Patrick Nielson Hayden (probably the single strongest fantasy and SF collection of the year); Bending the Landscape: Science Fiction, edited by Nicola Griffith and Stephen Pagel (another very strong collection, of stories billed as gay and lesbian writing); Dreaming Down Under, edited by Jack Dann and Janeen Webb (an impressive showcase of the best new Australian fantasy and SF writers, in time for this year's World SF convention in Melbourne); Arrowdreams, edited by JOhn Dupuis and Mark Shainblum (devoted to alternate history SF about Canada); the latest volume in the Mankzin Wars series edited by Larry Niven; and the latest volume in the Writers of the Future series.\n\nIn summary, it was another year in which there were more than sixty or seventy, perhaps over a hundred, really good SF stories published, certainly enough to fill several year's best volumes, providing me with a rich diversity of selection for this one. For more information, including extensive monthly discussion of many fine individual stories, you are refered to Mark Kelly's excellent short fiction review columns in Locus.\n\nSadly, Tangents, the other main venue for short fiction reviews and commentary, was late and irregular in 1998, though a new online site has recently been established for the magazine where reviews may begin to be posted in a timely way.\n\nI will make further observations on trends and themes in SF and remarks on the individual excellences of the contents of this book in the notes to the stories, that follow immediately. So here we go, into the best of the year. Follow me.\n\n—David G. Hartwell\n\nMarket Report\n\nALEXANDER JABLOKOV\n\nAlexander Jablokov published his first short story in 1985 and his first novel, Carve the Sky, in 1991. He is one of the most interesting SF writers to come to prominence in the 1990s. He has published five novels to date (his latest is Deepdrive, 1998), and occasional short stories. Some of his best work is collected in The Breath of Suspension (1994). He is part of the Boston-area SF writers workshop chaired by David Alexander Smith, the group that produced the collaborative original anthology, Future Boston (1994). The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction calls his work both rounded and exploratory, and…generates the sense that an important SF career has gotten well underway. This story appeared in Asimov's and is the first of several in this book from that magazine, which seemed to me to publish a slightly higher percentage of SF, as opposed to fantasy of various sorts, again this past year. It was a particularly strong year for Asimov's. This was Jablokov's only short fiction this year.\n\nI slid out of the rental car's AC, and the heat of the mid-western night wrapped itself around my face like a wet iguana. Lightning bugs blinked in the unmown grass of my parents' lawn, and cicadas rasped tenaciously at the subdivision's silence. Old Oak Orchard was so new it wasn't even on my most recent DeLorme map CD-ROM, and it had taken me a while to find the place.\n\nMy father pulled the door open before I could ring the bell.\n\nBert. He peered past me. Ah. And where is—\n\nStacy's not with me. I'd practiced what to say on the drive from the airport, but still hadn't come up with anything coherent. We…well, let's just say there have been problems.\n\nSo many marriages are ended in the passive voice. His voice was carefully neutral. Come along back, then. I'll set you up a tent.\n\nDad wore a pair of once-fashionable pleated linen shorts and a floppy T-shirt with the name of an Internet provider on it. His skin was all dark and leathery, the color of retirement. He looked like he'd just woken up.\n\nI told Mom when I was coming….\n\nSure. He grabbed my suitcase and wrestled it down the hall. She must have nailed the note to a tree, and I didn't see it.\n\nI didn't know why I always waited a moment for him to explain things. He never did. I was just supposed to catch on. I had spent my whole life trying to catch on.\n\nLulu! he called out the back slider. Bert's home.\n\nI winced as he dragged my leather suitcase over the sliding door tracks into the backyard. A glowing blue North Face tent sat on the grass. A Coleman lantern pooled yellow on a picnic table stolen from a roadside rest area. The snapped security chain dangled down underneath.\n\nLulu! he yelled, then managed a grin for me. She must be checking the garden. We get…you know…slugs. Eat the tomatoes.\n\nThe yard didn't end in a garden. Beyond the grass was a dense growth of trees. Now and then headlights from the highway beyond paled the undersides of the maple leaves, but they didn't let me see anything.\n\nSure. I sat down at the picnic table. So how are you, Dad?\n\nHe squinted at me, as if unsure whether I was joking. Me? Oh, I'm fine. Never better. Life out here agrees with me. Should have done it a long time ago.\n\nClichés were my father's front defensive line. He was fortifying quickly, building walls in front of questions I hadn't even asked yet.\n\nTrouble? I said. With Mom? Being subtle is a nonstarter in my family.\n\nAnd how is your fast-paced urban lifestyle? he asked.\n\nWe're working a few things out. A bit of a shake-down period, you might call it.\n\nMy parents' entire marriage had been a shakedown period. I was just an interim project that had somehow become permanent. I swear, all through my childhood, every morning they had been surprised to see me come downstairs to breakfast. Even now, my dad was looking at me as if he wasn't entirely sure who I was.\n\nWell, to start with, Dad, I guess the problems Stacy and I have been having stem from being in the same profession—\n\nYou know, Dad said, your mother still has the darkest blue eyes I have ever seen.\n\nShe does have lovely eyes.\n\nCornflower blue, I always thought. Her eyes are cornflower blue.\n\nStacy's eyes were brown, but I guessed my father wasn't interested in hearing about that. Cornflowers are not the flowers on corn. It had taken me years to figure that out.\n\nThat's right.\n\nSomeone once told me, I said, that you can hear corn growing at night. It grows so fast on hot summer nights. A night like tonight.\n\nYou need quiet to hear it, he said. You don't like quiet, do you, Bert? He was already looking for an argument. You can't market quiet.\n\nThat's where you're wrong, I said. There's an ambient recording you can buy of corn growing. Cells dividing. Leaves rustling. Bugs, I don't know, eating the leaves. That little juicy crunch. Call it a grace note.\n\nAnd so you play it over your Home Theater system. With subwoofer, side speakers, the works? Pour yourself a single-malt, sit back, relax?\n\n\"You don't listen to ambient, Dad. You let it wash over you. Through you. The whole point of modern life is never giving your full attention to any one thing. That gets boring. So you put the corn in the CD stack with the sound of windblown sand eroding the Sphinx, snow falling on the Ross Ice Shelf, the relaxing distant rattle of a horde of lemmings hitting the ocean, pop open your Powerbook to work some spreadsheets, and put a football game on the giant TV. You'll get the Oneness thing happening in no time.\"\n\nAre you getting it? he asked softly. It wasn't like his regular voice at all.\n\nWhat?\n\nThe Oneness. Whatever it is you're looking for.\n\nThere was a time when I was so close I could taste it….\n\nBertram! There you are! Had my mother just come out of the woods? She was knotting the sash of a fluffy white terrycloth robe, as if she'd just stepped from the bathroom. Her gray hair was cut close to her scalp. She looked great. She always had. Even rubbing sleep out of her eyes, her feet bare. She still painted her toe-nails, I noticed, and they weren't even chipped. Franklin, weren't you going to go get him a tent?\n\nI was, my dad said.\n\nShe hugged me, then tugged at the sleeve of my jacket. Isn't it a little hot for wool?\n\nIt's tropic weight, I said. Gabardine.\n\nThe tropics have nothing on Illinois in August. With that last shot, my dad disappeared into the garage.\n\nFranklin's right. Here. An antique steamer trunk stood on end next to where the house's air-conditioning unit poked out of the rhododendrons.\n\nThen my jacket was off, my tie was gone, and I was sitting at the picnic table with an iced glass of cranberry juice in my hand. Mothers do card tricks with comfort. All Dad had offered me was an argument—but then that was his way of letting me know I was home.\n\nDid the power go out, Mom? I said.\n\nShe laughed. Oh, no. How do you think I made the ice cubes? It's just the way we live now. Out here in the country.\n\nNow that I had a chance to relax, I could see that the other backyards visible had encampments in them too: tents, tables, meat smokers, greenhouses, even a Port-O-Let or two. I could hear people talking quietly, even at this hour, and smell the smoke of banked cook-fires. Something was wrong, seriously wrong, with this exclusive residential community. I should have known it as soon as my mom gave me the cranberry juice. Her comfort meant that something was not right.\n\nThere were times in my childhood when everything had been stable. For a couple of years, for example, my dad had worked in a regular pet store, selling neon tetras and spaniels to wide-eyed children who would lose interest in them as soon as they got them home. We'd lived in a suburban house with a yard, all that, and I'd been able to tell the other kids what my dad did for a living. The TV shows I watched seemed to be intended to be watched by people living the life I then lived.\n\nBut during that time my mother had barely paid attention to me. TV dinners had been the order of the day, and I remembered a lot of drive-thru eating. She thought I was safe, then, and could take care of myself.\n\nIt was times like when my dad tried to build a submerged house at the bottom of an abandoned water-filled quarry and stock the water with ornamental piranha that my mother would bake me apple cobbler and paint farm scenes with smiling cows on the riveted bulkhead in my room. She had always intervened to keep the panic in my memories on a perfectly even keel.\n\nI should have known, I said.\n\nIce cubes clinked in my empty glass and she refilled it. Known what, Bertram?\n\nThat you and Dad could turn the most wholesome of carefully planned and secure communities into something disturbing. And here I thought, while driving around, that you two had finally settled down, so that I could visit you without fear. Nice neighborhood, Old Oak Orchard.\n\nShe looked off at the glowing tents of the neighbors. It is a nice neighborhood. Do you smell roasting joints from oxen and goats hissing fat on ancient sacrificial stones? Hear the minor-key chants of the priests as they rip open the jugulars of bellowing kine with their bronze blades? Does that make you afraid?\n\nLulubelle. My father broke a branch on a forsythia as he wrestled a heavy bundle out of the garage. My mother winced. You're frightening the boy with all this pseudo-biblical ‘kine’ stuff. That's cows, Bert, if you don't know. Herefords, Black Anguses. Besides, Lulu, you know our whole concept's not really about…that sort of thing. That's not the point.\n\nI thought we had agreed to disagree on the point, Franklin. I noticed that my mother had scratches up and down her arms, and that one of her little fingers was in a splint. Both Dad and I heard the danger in her tone.\n\nHe held up the tent. It's canvas, Bert. White duck. Heavy as hell. You know, I saw some hunters out in the Gila with one of these once. They packed in on horses, and fried up a mess of potatoes in a cast-iron pan two feet across. My friend and I ate some kind of reconstituted gunk out of a plastic bowl. They were hunting elk with black-powder rifles. The things looked like cannon.\n\nHe'd told me the story before, but the actual physical tent was a new element. It was as if he now needed some real substance behind the memory. My father swore under his breath as he put the thing up. I knew better than to try and help him. It had all sorts of complicated ribs and locking joints. He pinched some skin and got real quiet. You could hear him breathing through his nostrils.\n\nOh, come on, Bertram. My mother chuckled. You won't see any animal-headed gods in the Lopezes' backyard, so quit staring. I was just…kidding.\n\nShe was really being hard on me. She'd noticed Stacy's absence, but wasn't going to ask about it. I was sure it pleased her, though.\n\nIt's late, Lu. My father looked hungrily at my mother. Men should not look at their own wives that way, and particularly not at the mothers of their sons.\n\nYes, she said. It's time for bed.\n\nIt was a peacemaking gesture of some sort. They'd been at war, but my arrival had brought them together. My mother smiled at me over her shoulder as she followed him into their dome tent. It was the same old story. My parents had always disappeared behind their locked bedroom door, sometimes in the middle of the day, sometimes when I was sitting down in the living room with uncomfortable shoes on, waiting to go to some relative's house, and I wasn't even allowed to turn the TV on.\n\nI woke up. I hadn't really slept. It was quiet. Still dark. I was thirsty. I walked across the lawn to the back door. The cut ends of the grass tickled my bare feet. It was a great feeling, a suburban feeling. The stars were weirdly bright. The Milky Way was something you wanted to wipe off with a sponge.\n\nThe sliding glass door to the kitchen wasn't locked. As a child, I'd always asked for kitchen water rather than bathroom water. My mother would go downstairs for me. The stairs creaked and I would hear her and know that she loved me. My father would go into the bathroom, make a lot of noise so I knew he hadn't gone anywhere, even flush the toilet, and then come back and tell me that it was the finest kitchen water there was. If I was thirsty enough, I would believe him.\n\nThe kitchen was dark. I felt the edge of a Corian countertop. I worked my way toward the sink. I saw the high faucet silhouetted against the window. Wet on my fingers. Something was soaking in the full sink. The water did not feel soapy. The glasses would be in this cabinet over here.\n\nSomething hissed at me. For a second I thought it was air-conditioning after all, despite how hot it was in the kitchen. Then I saw the eyes.\n\nWhat is that thing he's got in his mouth? my father said. He peered up above the cabinets, into the shadows cast by the lamp. A vole? Do we have voles? Or is that a star-nosed mole? Native or…recreated?\n\nFranklin, my mother said.\n\nFrom a cookie jar shaped like a squat Chrysler Building she gave me a Tollhouse cookie. It couldn't have been baked more than a couple of hours before, probably about the time I was landing at O'Hare. The chocolate chips were still a little liquid. They unfurled themselves across my tongue. I lay on the textured floor. I didn't want to get up.\n\nA magnet on the white dishwasher said CLEAN. The symbol for CLEAN was the smoking rubble of a city. I reached up and turned it over. DIRTY was that city whole, veiled in a haze of smog. A typical example of one of my father's deep ecology jokes. Smog is one of those antique sixties-type symbols he's always using as if they were arguments.\n\nThis time my father heard the warning in my mother's voice. He squatted down next to me. His knees cracked.\n\nSorry, Bert, he said. I guess I should have told you.\n\nTold me what? That you have animals in your sink?\n\nIt was a fisher.\n\nI caught glimpses of the creature as it snaked its way across the tops of the cabinets, some kind of rodent limp in its mouth. It looked like a big weasel. Its eyes gleamed down at me in the lantern light. Its eyes…\n\nA fisher? I didn't look at it. Frogs made a low thrumming noise in the sink. An owl hooted out in the living room. Things examined us from outside the circle of light. When I was little, and wouldn't go get a drink of water myself, this was what I had known it was really like out there.\n\nActually, it's an extinct species of mustelid, he said. This one vanished about the time the ice sheets left North America. It's part of a controlled breeding experiment, the reason we've moved here to Old Oak Orchard. We regress the DNA of animals that went extinct around the Pleistocene and implant it in related ova.\n\nOh, God, Dad. Remember that time you raised insulated sea turtles to give rides at that Aleutian beach resort?\n\nThe resort had been run as some government benefit for impoverished Aleuts. All I remembered of the experience was thick clouds, rocks, and giant lumbering shells covered with barnacles, all roughly the same shade of gray. I didn't remember the turtles having any heads. My only entertainment had been working on a seaweed collection. It had all climaxed in a riot by the disillusioned locals, who had invested heavily in beach front cabanas and glitzy casinos, and blamed my father for the fact that sea turtle rides through choppy ice water failed to draw more tourists. Most of the turtles had been stewed in their own shells on the rocky beach in a drunken feast. Sea lions had barked their approval somewhere out in the mist, which glowed orange with the burning cabanas as we pulled away in our fiberglass bidarka. My mother had made my very favorite chili mac while we were there, and tucked me into bed every night with a sweet lullaby in a foreign language.\n\nWe were undercapitalized, that's all. My dad was irritated at having it brought up. The failure wasn't biological.\n\nNo, they never are—\n\nYou're cranky, Bertram. My mother supported my shoulders, and I sat up. Not enough sleep.\n\nShe had an almost suntan lotion smell, even though it was still dark. Some kind of collagen replacement cream. It was a comfort, to realize that my mother wanted to stay young. It was something to hold on to. The extinct mustelid slunk into shadows and did not come back out.\n\nThe lighter and fluffier my mom's scrambled eggs, the worse things were—a classic rule. This morning, with the innocent light streaming in through the kitchen windows, they were like clouds. I had looked around the house, but most of its nocturnal dwellers seemed to have hidden themselves in the cupboards and cabinets.\n\nIs Dad driving you crazy? I asked. The orange juice was metallic, from concentrate, so maybe there was some hope.\n\nSince when hasn't he? She smiled. \"But this time I'm driving him crazy too. I came here under protest—who wants to move out to one of these bland compounds out in the middle of nowhere, even to raise extinct fauna? Really, that's no different than playing golf until you die, don't you think?\"\n\nI didn't tell her how happy I had been to see the place, to feel its stolid normality. Sodden, heavy scrambled eggs would have been a small price to pay to know that I was, at last, safe.\n\n\"But I've found things to do. I've found ways to enjoy this little place. And that, as you can guess, drives your dad bananas. I'm using it wrong, you see. I'm not enjoying it the proper way.\" She produced a day-labeled pillbox, and started filling it with red, yellow, and green pills. Sunday through Saturday. Her week was set up.\n\nAnd how are you enjoying it, Mother?\n\nShe held up a deep-green lozenge. Do you think my body used to produce this, and then stopped? What gland do you suppose made it? The pill had a particularly hard gleam, like a liquid-oxygen tank on a Pixar-generated spacecraft in an SF movie.\n\nI don't know.\n\nYou know how all these Pleisto-kooks got together? They all used to belong to the same Internet newsgroup. They'd trade breeding tips, give each other heads-up on available DNA sequencers and incubators. Then, a bunch of them decided to live together and work on a big project. They bought into Old Oak Orchard en masse. Some of these people were quite wealthy.\n\nIt's the latest thing, you know, I said. The transformation of virtual communities into real ones. One of those wonderful retrogressive steps that makes my job so much fun.\n\nShe sighed. I know mothers can never explain their children's jobs right nowadays, and it always drives the kids crazy. But if you'd only have normal jobs, like, I don't know, accountant, or wrestler, or weatherman, or something…\n\nWrestler?\n\n\"Then we could just say it, and people would know what we meant.\"\n\n\"I've told you what Stacy and I do. Call us experimental demographers. That's close enough.\"\n\nThere, I'd brought up the dread name. My mom pursed her lips, but maybe it was because she didn't like the OJ either. That's not really what you are, is it?\"\n\nNo, Mom. I knew she could hear the sadness in my voice. That's not really what I am. Not anymore.\n\nOh, Bertram. Her eyes filled with tears. I don't know who pushed whom, but she's gone, isn't she?\n\nAs gone as it gets. And my job along with her.\n\nShe meant so much to you…. She'd never liked Stacy, but she knew what hurt her son.\n\nThe last job we did… I said. Stacy soloed, I only advised. She was good, real good. I'd taught her how to spot potentially self-defined groups…she found a little community of interest among teenagers. A disaffected layer in a lot of high schools, all across the country. People think it's all mass marketing, but that's not where the real value-added stuff comes in, not any more. These kids didn't identify themselves as any sort of group, but I could—Stacy could tell from what they bought, the kind of magazines they read, the web sites they hit, and music they listened to, and the street drugs they took, that they were looking for something. Something they hadn't found yet. So she gave it to them.\n\nWhat? My mother was interested despite herself.\n\n\"The past. The real deep past. It just took a little marketing push, and they started mail-ordering flint blanks for spear points, birth-control dispensers in the shape of Paleolithic fertility figurines, ink-jet-sprayed wall paintings to conjure up mammoths. It was just this group, but they were really into it. Their rooms at home must have looked like Altamira or Lascaux. When the trend tanks you won't be able to give that Acheulean stuff away, but that's off in…the future.\"\n\nMy mother stood up and ran gnarled fingers through her short gray hair. She didn't look young. I wouldn't pretend that. She was old, she was my mother. But she had more light in her eyes than she'd had in years. She also had scratches on her hands, and calluses on her palms, like she'd been working hard somewhere outdoors for quite some time. My mother had never been a gardener and, in fact, there was no trace of any garden in the yard. I'd looked for it.\n\nYou think you're so smart, don't you? Her tone was bitter.\n\nMom, I—\n\nTalk to your dad. I mean, really talk to him. I think you still need a few lessons in what life is really like.\n\nShe walked out of the kitchen. A few minutes later I heard the door to the yard ease open. I craned my head out the kitchen window, but couldn't see where she went. I sat down to another cup of coffee. Something that looked a lot like a badger poked its head out from under the sink, saw me, and pulled back. The little door clicked back onto its magnet.\n\nDad, I said. I think you got some problems. Mom had gotten me thinking about the possible consequences of his new project. I felt like I was back on the job. It bugged me how much I liked that feeling.\n\nYou're telling me? He spent some time putting the ball on his tee. I thought your mother and I could work together on this. Instead, she made a bunch of new girlfriends and now spends her time hunting ungulates in the woods with spears. Is that anything a woman her age should be doing? He swung at the ball with his driver. It sliced viciously, off into the dark woods that bordered the course. In all our years together, this was the first time he'd ever taken me golfing. I already didn't like it.\n\nI…well, actually, you know, Dad, it's really about time. It's good for her to do something like that.\n\nGod, I knew you'd take her side.\n\nI'm not taking her side!\n\n\"Deer liver. I'm talking deer liver for supper, with forest mushrooms, fiddleheads, all sorts of sick hunter-gatherer crap. She just doesn't seem to get the post-technological nature of our enterprise. She's a woman who skulks with the foxes.\" He left the course and started hacking his way through the underbrush. I followed.\n\nDad, I said. Are we chasing after her? Bugging her?\n\nEh? I'd caught him. He scratched the back of his head. Not at all. A golf course is a good place to work out a few intellectual problems. That's all. Golf is the perfect combination of mathematics and frustration.\n\nLet her be, Dad. She has a right to do what she wants. Even if it was some up-market version of an old mid-teen trendlet. No wonder she'd gotten irritated with me. You're doing what you want, aren't you?\n\nI don't know. I don't know. I had a different idea when I came here…it doesn't work without Louise. He never called my mother Louise. Lulu, Lulubelle, Looly, all sorts of things. She never liked her given name. You know, she spends all night out sometimes. Getting nocturnal on me. Pretty soon, her eyes will grow a tapetum and reflect in the headlights. And I'll never see her again.\n\nDad, that's just not true, and you know it.\n\nI want you to help me talk to your mother. His voice was quiet now, matching the hush of the dense forest in which I was already completely lost. That's all.\n\nNot here, Dad, I pleaded. Don't try to talk to her here.\n\nI have to. I can't stand it anymore. Back me up, will you, son?\n\nThey created me as a ref. Both of them. I might as well have been born with a black-and-white striped shirt on and a whistle in my mouth. I was the go-between in all their arguments.\n\nDammit. He tripped over a thick tree root. Where do you suppose that thing's gone? It was a good one, Titleist.\n\nHe was maintaining the imposture, even though we'd now been wandering in this thick jungle for a quarter of an hour. He'd occasionally brush some wild sarsaparilla or poison ivy aside with his iron, but he never actually looked at the ground underneath for his ball.\n\nDad, I said. Do you remember when you used to take me camping?\n\nEh? That caught him by surprise. Sure, of course I do.\n\nWhy did you stop?\n\nStop?\n\nStop taking me!\n\nYou didn't like it.\n\nHow did you know that?\n\nKnow what?\n\nThat took a deep breath. That I didn't like it.\n\nYou just didn't that's all. It was hard, you got blisters, we got rained on, the food was always kind of grainy or lumpy. Don't you remember? Those trails, mud where they weren't trippy rocks, bugs, and nothing, nothing to do except walk and look at stuff.\n\nI didn't remember hating it. Oh, sure, I bet there were times when I had been a real pain in the butt, not wanting to poop in a trench, or unwilling to get out of a warm sleeping bag to greet the icy dawn, or whining over my blisters. But I remembered happiness when I would wake up in the middle of the night, moonlight streaming through the mosquito netting, trees rustling in the breeze, my father's heavy bulk snoring next to me. The mountains at sunrise had looked something like heaven.\n\nYou shouldn't have stopped taking me, Dad, I said. You love it. He still went every year, with his increasingly creaky friends he'd been going with since high school. It's something to share.\n\nYou can say that, but you didn't have to put up with you. All the questions, all the suggestions. Sometimes it was technical—ways of packing more efficiently, that sort of thing. But sometimes it was, I don't know, spiritual or something. How we could enjoy ourselves better. How we could be more ourselves. I tell you, Bert, that's a little hard to take when all you want to do is go on a hike.\n\nHe and his friends Bill and Frank had been the sort of limited demographic I later made my career out of satisfying. They weren't high-intensity rock-face-sleeping types. I did vaguely remember trying to figure out why they liked what they did, and how they could like it better. My dad's gear had even been pretty lame. For example, the waterproofing had come off the bottom of his tent and it always got a little wet.\n\nI was starting to remember now. A fight. Not even on the trail, but before. I'd hauled his tent out of the garage, where he'd packed it up wet, cleaned all the dirt and grass off of it, and re-waterproofed the bottom. It had taken me all afternoon, patiently coating every square inch with the goo. While I was at it, I sealed all the seams. My father never really understood that they sold you the tent with the seams unsealed, so rain had always run down the stitching. When I was done you could have used that tent as a boat. I stood back, hands on my hips, and admired it as it stood in the backyard.\n\nWhat are you doing? my father had said behind me, and I turned to explain.\n\nI didn't remember the anger itself. All I remembered was his car driving away, his friends Bill and Frank sitting in it instead of me, both of them incredibly embarrassed. I had solved a problem for him, and that was something he just couldn't stand. All of my mother's entreaties had been useless. I had to stay behind. I was too young, he said. Too much trouble to take along. Maybe when I was older…That had been the last time.\n\nMaybe we can just go for a hike sometime, I said.\n\nLet's count this as a start.\n\nFor a moment we moved in synch through the trees, as if we were together, heading for the same place.\n\nLet me take advantage of your expertise for a moment, Bert, he said. My dad had always known exactly what I did, though he had never approved of it. Could you find us? I mean, if you were back in your office. Without knowing anything about us, would we pop up when you searched for unusual patterns in purchases?\n\nSure. I'd already been thinking about it. This operation can't just bootstrap up from nothing. You had to have bought all sorts of things, gotten all sorts of technical information. All of that can be traced.\n\nBut that's not so bad, is it? All you'd want to do is sell us more things. My dinner of antelope and tree bark will be interrupted by a call from someone trying to offer me a zone electrophoresis setup or a subscription to an Embryo of the Month club. Free samples of restriction enzymes and mammoth kibble in the mail. Right?\n\nHe wanted me to reassure him. This was my territory.\n\nI couldn't do it.\n\nYou know, Dad, when I met Stacy, she was just a research assistant. Not mine, understand, just in the department. But she was eager to learn. She had a Ph.D. in sociology, but thought her whole life would be studying something like the distribution of ethnic first names in middle-class households. I showed her the ropes.\n\nShe seemed…I don't know, Bert. She never seemed like your type. Dumb word, I know. Not clear at all. But what upset your mother was that, when you visited, you never seemed…yourself. Now, that's natural when you're starting out, I guess….\n\n\"I worked it, Dad. I mean, I really worked it. You have no idea how far I went. I wanted her…at first it was just sort of ambition. She was beautiful, right? But that wasn't all. She was so sharp, so crisp. So focused. For a while she focused on me. I melted. I resisted, that wasn't my plan, but it happened before I knew it. I don't know…I don't know? if she ever did. There comes that moment, you know? Where the other person…melts. I always deluded myself into thinking it had happened. My game just wasn't good enough.\"\n\nYour mother, for example, was very resistant. Dad was reminiscent. Somehow, my line of nonsense didn't particularly charm her. Imagine that! But one day, we went out canoeing. There were a lot of toppled cottonwoods in the river, and several times we had to pull the canoe over them. It was hot, and there were a lot of bugs. It should have made us cranky with each other, but instead, each drag across made us more of a team. I fell in the mud, more than once. Your mother wore white shorts and a light blue blouse with a collar. I remember her staying completely clean, she remembers herself getting covered with drying mud. That was all fine, it was a step forward. Mosquito bites and all, it was something we'd shared. Then, just as we were getting ready to turn around and go home, a water moccasin swam slowly out to us. Now, I knew a thing or two about poisonous snakes at the time—I had a Pentecostalist friend who made a great living at county fairs—and I was able to…hypnotize it, I guess you'd say. It fell asleep on my paddle, eyes still open, and your mother stroked its head. She wasn't afraid. She trusted me. Then she looked at me and…I knew it had happened. Nothing would ever be the same again. After that—\n\nDad— He was pushing it.\n\n\"Oh, no details, no details. Not about the rest of that day, anyway. But after that, we got married and I started a viper ranch. I saw it as fate. Your mother helped raise the money to start it. After a year or two, it failed, and we had to let the snakes go. It still gives me a tear to remember the black mamba slithering across the parking lot toward the drainage"
