        "text": "\"Hugh's imaginative worlds and tales within them never fail to entertain!\"\n\n--Andy Weir, New York Times bestselling author of Project Hail Mary\n\nThe first original novel from author Hugh Howey in six years, Across the Sand takes us back to the world of Sand, to a far future many generations after a disaster has destroyed civilization as we know it, where four siblings struggle to build their futures amid the harsh wastes of endless desert\n\nThe old world is buried. A new one has been forged atop the shifting dunes, a land of howling wind and infernal sand.\n\nIn this barren home, siblings Conner, Rob, Palmer and Violet daily carve out a future. They live in the shadow of their father and oldest sister, Vic, two of the greatest sand divers ever to comb the desert's depths. But these branches of their family tree are long gone, disappeared into the wastes beyond, leaving the younger siblings scratching in the dust, hopeful for a better life.\n\nOn the other side of No Man's Land, Anya was born beside the abundant mines knowing her prospects would be to marry, have a family, and work in ore, in service to the Empire of the East. But when an atomic bomb delivered by a stranger destroys most of her town--murdering all her friends and community--she follows her father to a strange land of dunes to bring vengeance to their enemies.\n\nTwo families collide across the sand, and nothing for a thousand dunes will ever be the same.\n\nFrom the award-winning author of The Feral Detective and Motherless Brooklyn comes an utterly original post-collapse yarn about two siblings, the man that came between them, and a nuclear-powered super car.\n\nThe Arrest isn't post-apocalypse. It isn't a dystopia. It isn't a utopia. It's just what happens when much of what we take for granted--cars, guns, computers, and airplanes, for starters--quits working. . . .\n\nBefore the Arrest, Sandy Duplessis had a reasonably good life as a screenwriter in L.A. An old college friend and writing partner, the charismatic and malicious Peter Todbaum, had become one of the most powerful men in Hollywood. That didn't hurt.\n\nNow, post-Arrest, nothing is what it was. Sandy, who calls himself Journeyman, has landed in rural Maine. There he assists the butcher and delivers the food grown by his sister, Maddy, at her organic farm. But then Todbaum shows up in an extraordinary vehicle: a retrofitted tunnel-digger powered by a nuclear reactor. Todbaum has spent the Arrest smashing his way across a fragmented and phantasmagorical United States, trailing enmities all the way. Plopping back into the siblings' life with his usual odious panache, his motives are entirely unclear. Can it be that Todbaum wants to produce one more extravaganza? Whatever he's up to, it may fall to Journeyman to stop him.\n\nWritten with unrepentant joy and shot through with just the right amount of contemporary dread, The Arrest is speculative fiction at its absolute finest.\n\nThe shadow grows; the claws are out. It is the twenty-fourth century, and humanity has successfully breached beyond their limited solar system to colonize much of the known galaxy. Mostly located within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way, humanity has ventured into a prosperous and ever-expanding era of exploration and discovery, with several other new races joining one of powers in humanity's growing sphere of influence, either willingly or by force. However, mankind cannot escape the shadow of conflict that dared to follow them out beyond the stars. In the immediate aftermath of the Earthborn War between two galactic superpowers--the oppressive far-reaching-based Hagorian Alliance and the more egalitarian-minded and Earth-based Praetorian League--one young girl rises from the ashes of chaos to break the yoke of oppression that the tyrannical Alliance has leaned upon to enforce its rule over its section of the cosmos. While other nations exist, they are constantly and often caught in the crossfire between the Alliance and the League. The Alliance, based at the trailing ends of the Orion Arm, valued slavery, fear, and subjugation to control and rule its people. The League, while not ideal, was far more egalitarian if not apathetic. But for citizens of the Alliance, many had had enough.\n\nOne girl was chosen by fate to be the leader of these dissidents whom the Alliance would classify as militant rebels outright, viewing them as little more than vermin that need to be extinguished. From being an owned slave to a warrior and rebel leader, to empress and conqueror, this is part of the legacy that Ava'kra hopes to forge, but in the brutal maelstrom of seemingly unending war, can she? When facing betrayal at every turn, fighting outnumbered and outmaneuvered, can a young girl forge a new galactic nation free of oppression and live to tell the tale?"
