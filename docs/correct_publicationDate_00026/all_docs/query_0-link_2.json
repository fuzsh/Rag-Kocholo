        "text": "March 13, 2018\n\nPartial reread of this 1994 collection, of late 1980s and early 90s stories, all first published at Asimov's. Here's the TOC and publication details: http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?3...\n\nAnd here's PW's 1994 review, which is the one to read first: https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-...\n\nThe standout story, for me, is \"Living Will\" (1991), a story about an aging computer millionaire who's facing dementia, and has made, um, provisions to deal with it. The technical details haven't held up, but it's still a first-rate story. Killer ending. 4.5 stars, reprinted often: http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cg...\n\nI bounced off the title story, oddball religious gobbledegook, and partially reread \"A Deeper Sea,\" a long, moody story that's about learning to speak to dolphins, use them in warfare, and send them into space. 3 stars, maybe.\n\nI may (or may not) reread more of this collection, which mostly doesn't seem to have aged well.\n\nJanuary 28, 2018\n\nThis is another in the \"So good luke was willing to carry around a paper book to read it\" category. Way at the top end of the top quintile.\n\nI read \"a deeper sea\" a bit ago, and it was really interesting to see what the novel-length story was like when stripped down to it's bones; good stuff.\n\nPersonally, I like to recontextualize \"Beneath the shadow of her smile\" as a more intellectual re-telling of the \"Casca\" stories by Barry Sadler\n\nFebruary 7, 2022\n\nJablokov has a delightful style. Curious, intriguing stories. Some moments & characterization that reminded me of a darker Terry Pratchett.\n\n\"The Death Artist\" explores has some explorations of gender/body identity that, despite elements which are problematic, I enjoyed.\n\n\"The Ring of Memory\" used one of my favourite time-traveling tropes of an item that doesn't actually exist. While very different thematically & content-wise, there were elements that reminded me of the German show Dark.\n\n\"Many Mansions\" I wanted more of.\n\n\"Deathbinder\" I would love to see as like a Netflix series or something.\n\n\"At the Cross-Time Jaunters' Ball\" had a delightful twist ending.\n\n\"A Deeper Sea\" I kind of wish I hadn't read, due to material I found to be triggering for my specific set of traumas, and will be skipping in future reads.\n\nFor some trigger warnings (the ones that I remember) if you are needing them -->\n\n\"The Breath of Suspension\" includes questionable consent, racism, ableism.\n\n\"Living Will\" includes suicide (due to terminal illness) and gun violence.\n\n\"Beneath the Shadow of Her Smile\" includes graphic war violence; mention of rape.\n\n\"A Deeper Sea\" has a brief description of rape that, in my opinion, was not necessary to prove that dolphins are terrible. It was not good for my brain, personally.\n\nSeptember 29, 2012\n\nThis is a crazy, bizarre sci fi book. It's actually a compilation of different stories that he wrote for a sci fi magazine. I liked some, but mostly I just didn't understand a lot of it. I felt like he made up words and I had no clue what they meant."
