Ryan, David G. Hartwell, Jack Dann, Janeen Webb, Warren Lapine, Jan Berriends, Ed McFadden, Tom Piccirilli, Nicola Griffith, Lawrence Person, Dwight Brown, Darrell Schweitzer, Corin See, and special thanks to my own editor, Gordon Van Gelder. Thanks are also due to Charles N. Brown, whose magazine Locus (Locus Publications, P.O. Box 13305, Oakland, CA 94661, $43 for a one-year subscription [twelve issues] via second class; credit card orders [510] 339-9198) was used as a reference source throughout the Summation, and to Andrew Porter, whose magazine Science Fiction Chronicle (Science Fiction Chronicle, P.O. Box 022730, Brooklyn, NY 11202-0056, $35 for a one-year subscription [twelve issues]; $42 first class) was also used as a reference source throughout. summation: 1998 On the surface, 1998 was a relatively quiet year, although just below that surface, major changes swum like monstrous fish, changes that could affect the entire publishing world and make it a radically different place in 2008 than it is today. It was in general a prosperous year, with the major chain bookstores reporting record earnings, and the relatively new area of online bookselling proving itself to be a serious money-maker, with online services such as Amazon.com and barnesandnoble.com bringing in serious bucks, and a great potential for growth still ahead in those areas. A good solid percentage of the money earned this year was earned by science fiction books, which I think pretty much serves to dismiss fears, discussed here last year, that the Death of Science Fiction as a publishing category is imminent. At this point, momentum and inertia alone would carry SF publishing into the next century, even if not another SF book ever sold a copy again— and, indeed, schedules into the first and second year of the new century have already been announced. But all indications are that SF (even solid core SF, leaving the much dreaded media novels out of the equation altogether) is selling better than ever here at the brink of the new millennium. The big, dramatic, catastrophic recession/bust/slump that genre insiders have been predicting for more than a decade now did not happen in 1998; in fact, the overall totals for books published seemed to be on the rise again, after a couple of years of mild decline (although the ways in which SF books get published continue to change and evolve, with mass-market titles declining and the number of books that are published instead as hardcovers or trade paperbacks on the rise). There were some fairly hefty cutbacks in 1997, and some failing or faltering lines, but they were more than made up for this year in numbers of books released by the founding of major and ambitious new science fiction lines by Avon Eos and Simon & Schuster UK. The field seems to be in good shape artistically and creatively, too; yes, the majority of the stuff available on the bookstore shelves at any given time is crap, but this has always been true, whatever decade you're talking about, whether it's the '50s, the '60s, the '70s, the '80s, or the '90s. Look beyond the crap, and you'll find an enormous and enormously varied number of top authors (from several different generations, stretching all the way from Golden Age giants of the '30s and '40s to the kid who made his first sale yesterday) producing an amazingly varied spectrum of first-rate work, from High Fantasy to the hardest of Hard Science Fiction— including a lot of material that could not have been published at all twenty years ago. There are still people around, some of them quite vocal, who will complain at length about how nobody's writing anything good anymore in the field, not like they did in the old days, but look closely and you'll find that most of those same people don't read any new science fiction, and haven't for years. Those of us who do read lots of new science fiction know better. When people are looking\n\nback nostalgically to the Golden Age twenty years from now, this, the present, this period we're in right now, is what they'll be looking at. Like last year, there was little activity in the traditional game of Editorial Musical Chairs in 1998, with the only really significant change being that Shelley Shapiro was named Editorial Director of Del Rey Books, moving up from her former position as Executive Editor. Most of the other changes this year took place a lot farther up the food-chain, in the rarified corporate realms where the very top suits dwell. The giant German publishing conglomerate Bertelsmann, owner of Bantam Doubleday Dell, bought Random House, which includes under its corporate umbrella houses such as Del Rey, Ballantine, Knopf, and dozens of other imprints. Later in the year, Bertelsmann bought a 50 percent stake in barnesandnoble.com, the online arm of Barnes & Noble and direct head-to-head competitor with Amazon.com for the increasingly profitable online bookselling market. Viacom sold off all but the consumer division of Simon & Schuster to Pearson, the owner of Penguin and Putnam. In England, the Orion Publishing Group bought Cassell, which resulted in the merger of SF lines Gollancz and Millennium, with future SF books being published as Gollancz hardcovers and Millennium paperbacks; Jo Fletcher of Gollancz and Simon Spanton of Millennium will be the acquiring editors (with Caroline Oakley, in charge of Orion paperbacks, continuing to edit some authors)— they will report directly to Malcolm Edwards, himself a former SF editor (as is Anthony Cheetham, the head of Orion). And, late in the year, Barnes & Noble, the largest of the chain bookstores, bought Ingram, the largest book distributor. Since Ingram had been the major distributor for Amazon.com as well as for the remaining independent bookstores, news of the purchase sent shockwaves through the entire publishing industry, with the executive director of the Author's Guild, Paul Aiken, saying (as quoted in Locus), \"The Godzilla of publishing is wedding the King Kong of distribution ... If I were an independent bookseller, I would be scared to death by this.\" Other experts downplayed this implication, suggesting that business would carry on more or less as always despite the sale. It may take a while for the effects of these changes to surface, but some of them— especially those things concerned with the online bookselling market— may be affecting the industry well into the next century. And there are other potential changes just down the road, things that could radically alter the nature of the publishing world as we know it. The field of electronic books, e-books, is just now taking its first faltering baby steps, with Tor announcing this year that they plan to offer about 100 books as e-text for the Rocket eBook via direct downloading from barnesandnoble.com; Tor has already licensed electronic versions of new and reprint titles to digital publisher Peanut Press for the 3Com PalmPilot, which are downloadable from the net (Peanut Press has a Web store at www.peanutpress.com that offers versions of books from a number of publishers that can be downloaded into the 3Com PalmPilot). Other \"electronic book\" systems are in development, including Millennium Reader, EveryBook, and SoftBook. I have a feeling that this market may turn out to be very significant indeed before we're too many years into the new century— taken to an extreme, it could change the face of publishing itself. Another development that could change the face of publishing forever is print-on-demand technology. Working models of such a system were demonstrated at this year's ABA. If it works as well as it's said to work, you may soon be able to walk into a bookstore that has such a system installed, and ask for, say, a copy of The Sun Also Rises, or any other book the system has on file, and it will print one out for you on the spot, indistinguishable from a regular trade product. The implications of such a system are staggering— only one such implication is that it would solve at a stroke the problem of the vanishing backlist that has plagued SF publishing throughout the last several decades, since the old mail-order backlist system more or less disappeared at the end of the '70s: if you decide that you like Poul Anderson, and you want to read some of his old stuff, like The High Crusade or The Enemy Stars, instead of waiting years for a reissue or haunting used bookstores trying to find those titles, you just go to\n\nthe print-on-demand machine and have it whomp up some copies of them for you on the spot. (Other implications, already beginning to occur to some writers and agents, affect current understanding of out-of-print and rights reversions issues; if your book is always available on a print-on-demand system, how can it ever be said to have gone out of print? And how can you ever get the rights to that book reverted to you in order to be sold again? A supposed one-time sale of a book could become a de facto to the end of time sale, unless contractual limitations are applied to the situation somehow.) Print-on-demand, if it works as well as its promoters claim it will, would also change the face of publishing by eliminating the need for huge warehouses to store large numbers of physical copies of books, eliminate the need for fleets of trucks to ship the physical copies around, and, perhaps most significant, eliminate at another stroke a great deal of the waste and inefficiency built into today's system (including the returns system that has been a crushing Old-Man-of-the-Sea on the back of the publishing industry for most of the second half of the twentieth century), saving immense amounts in paper and production costs; you would print exactly as many copies of a book as customers wanted to buy, with no need to produce five copies to sell one. Postulate a print-on-demand system able to print books downloaded directly from the Internet, and the need for many of the world's bookstores disappears as well (I think there will always be some bookstores, places for people to browse and schmooze, although there probably wouldn't need to be as many of them in any given location). This all sounds like utopian, pie-in-the-sky daydreaming, but it may not be as far off as you think. Similar technologies are already in place in many CD stores, where you can create your own CDs, mixing and matching songs as you like. Along the same lines, someday you may be able to go into a bookstore with a print-on-demand system and create your own anthology, drawing on a database of the year's stories (perhaps many of them published electronically online), selecting whatever stories you'd like for it, making anthologists like me obsolete. I suppose it's inevitable to be thinking about the future, here at the end of the twentieth century, with a new century and a new millennium looming just ahead of us. (Yes, I know that the new millennium doesn't really start in 2000, starting instead in 2001, so don't bother to write letters to me indignantly pointing this out. That's a lost cause anyway, I'm afraid— for all except a handful of stubborn purists, the new millennium will start in 2000, which is when the vast majority of the population will celebrate the change ... and I must admit that even though I know better, I'll probably feel a certain emotional frisson the first time I write \"2000\" as the year date on a check, after having spent a lifetime writing 19__-something instead!) For most of my life, the year 2000 was THE FUTURE, the time when the majority of science fiction stories were set, unimaginably distant. Now THE FUTURE is suddenly just a few months away, sweeping relentlessly down on us. It's tempting to try to peek into the future, to predict what's to come, as I was just doing above, but I know better than that. Just as SF writers peering at 2000 from the 1950s could have no real understanding of what 2000 would really be like, just as people peering into the oncoming new century from the end of the nineteenth century couldn't possibly have imagined the horrors and wonders and vast social changes that awaited humanity in the twentieth century, so we ourselves, almost by definition, lack the imagination and the foresight to see the as-yet unimaginable changes that lie ahead of us in the twenty-first century and beyond, things that would seem just as bizarre and impossible to us as the atomic bomb or a laptop computer, or a microchip, or penicillin, or the death camp at Dachau, or organ-transplant surgery, or a female Senator, or racially mixed schools, or Hustler magazine, or the Space Shuttle, or the Internet, or the ability to see into our own bodies with fiber-optic cameras, or the ability to speak to someone on the other side of the world would have seemed to somebody back in 1898. The future is always fundamentally unpredictable and unknowable. And in that lies perhaps our greatest\n\nhope. *** It was another rocky year in the magazine market, although, for the first time in several years, there were a few upbeat notes, with Amazing Stories reborn and the circulation of a few of the magazines even beginning to creep up a bit for a change. Asimov's Science Fiction and Analog Science Fiction & Fact both changed their \"trim size\" in mid-1998, going to a new format that added a little over an inch in height and about a quarter-inch in width to each issue (leaving The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction as the only true digest-size magazine in the genre), and, as hoped, it seems to have helped with newsstand sales. Asimov's lost about 2,000 in subscriptions but more than doubled their newsstand sales, from 5,040 to 11,982, for an 11% gain in overall circulation. Analog gained about 383 in subscriptions and another 5,902 in newsstand sales, for an 11.8% gain in overall circulation; both magazines also improved their \"sell-through\" rate, from 29% to 52% for Asimov's, and from 32% to 51% for Analog. The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction lost about 4,393 in subscriptions and another 495 in newsstand sales, for a 12.3% loss in overall circulation. Science Fiction Age lost about 4,740 in subscriptions and about another 4,462 in newsstand sales, for a 21.3% loss in overall circulation. Realms of Fantasy gained about 517 in subscriptions and about another 209 in newsstand sales, for a 1.6% gain in overall circulation. The magazine business is a strange one, and some of these figures probably look worse than they actually are. The fact is that many of these magazines, even the ones with declining circulations, may have actually increased their profitability in the last couple of years by various strategies, including adjusting their \"draw\" (sending fewer issues to newsstands that habitually sell less, so that fewer issues overall need to be printed and distributed in order to sell one issue, increasing the magazine's efficiency, and thereby lowering costs— and so increasing profitability), instituting cost-saving procedures in printing and physical production, and working out better targeting of \"direct-mail\" outlets (bookstores— where SF magazines usually sell well) as opposed to scattershot mass markets (magazine racks in supermarkets— where SF magazines usually don't sell well). Also, a lot of the subscriptions that have been lost by various magazines in recent years are Publishers Clearing House-style cut-rate stamp-sheet subscriptions, lost when many of the stamp-sheet places dropped most genre magazines awhile back; stamp-sheet subscriptions can swell your circulation rate, and make it look as though you're doing great, but since they cost more to fulfill than they actually bring in in revenue, they can be dangerous— they're part of the reason the print Omni went under, despite an annual circulation of 700,000— and an argument can be made that the genre magazines are better off without them. Although the magazine field did suffer a postage increase in early 1999, it also got a break in that paper costs, projected to rise, not only held steady but actually declined somewhat in 1998. And, of course, one of the traditional advantages that has always helped the digest magazines to survive is that they're so cheap to produce in the first place that you don't have to sell very many of them to make a profit (this is still true of the now slightly larger Asimov's and Analog, where, owing to changes in production methods and the economies that result from the parent company, Penny Press, having lots of other magazines— mostly crossword magazines— that print at the same size, the larger trim size is not significantly more expensive to produce than the old digest-size editions were). So, my cautious prediction— knock wood— is that it looks like most of the genre magazines will survive into the next century.\n\nAt the same time, it would be prudent not to underestimate the problems facing the magazine market. The dramatic contraction of the domestic distribution network that has been taking place in the last few years, with bigger distributors abruptly swallowing up the small independent distributors (one of the major reasons for precipitous circulation drops in almost all magazines, not just genre ones) continues— in 1996, there were 300 wholesale distributors; in 1999 that total is down to five, and the odds are good that it will be down to four before the year is over. There are so few distributors left that it's a buyer's market, and the surviving distributors often charge much higher fees for carrying titles or ask for greatly increased \"discounts\" and \"cash incentives\" for carrying them— because they can, basically. All of this makes it hard for low-circulation magazines without a company with deep pockets behind them (most SF magazines, basically) to get out on the newsstands effectively, and eats ever more deeply into their profit margin even when they can. Some distributors also set \"subscription caps,\" refusing even to handle magazines with a circulation below a certain set figure, usually a higher circulation figure than that of most genre magazines. With so few distributors, fewer and fewer \"sales-points\" (individual newsstands) get serviced, because distributors now have such large areas to cover that they don't find it worthwhile to send trucks a long way to service a sales-point that may sell only a few magazines per month, so newsstands may not be able to get copies of genre magazines even if they want them; the loss of those one or two magazine sales per month may be negligible to big-circulation magazines like Cosmo or Playboy, but they can add up vitally for a science fiction magazine. Many newsstand managers have also become much more selective about which magazines they'll display, reducing the numbers of titles they'll put on their shelves, in some cases by as much as half; newsstands now will sometimes refuse to display magazines that fall below a certain circulation figure— again, a figure usually higher than that of most genre magazines. The net result of all this is that it's a lot harder for genre magazines to get out on as many newsstands as they used to, and— with distributors demanding ever more— a lot harder to make a profit than it used to be, even if you do get out there. As I said above, the magazine field has evolved strategies for coping with this situation, and profitability actually seems to be up at many of the magazines, even those with declining circulations, but it's not difficult to envision a hardening economic situation that would drive genre magazines off the newsstands altogether, or at least make it so expensive for them to be there that it's not worth it. This scenario is why I think it's important for the genre magazines to try to find ways to get around the potential newsstand bottleneck, to find ways to attract new subscribers even without a strong presence on the newsstand. Most SF magazines have always been subscription-driven, anyway. Being frozen out of the newsstands would hurt magazines the most by cutting them off from attracting new readers, casual newsstand browsers who might, with luck, eventually become new subscribers; without a constant flow of new suscribers, a magazine's circulation will continually dwindle as natural attrition eliminates a certain percentage of the old subscribers. Which brings us to one of the other hopeful notes struck in the magazine market in 1998: the use of the Internet as a method to do an end-run around traditional distribution channels, potentially enabling the magazines to avoid the newsstand bottleneck and attract the attention of potential new subscribers to their product even without much traditional newsstand display. Early in 1998, Internet Web sites went up for both Asimov's and Analog (Asimov's site is at http://www.asimovs.com, and Analog's is at http://www.analogsf.com, both sites sponsored by SF Site) and, after a full year of operation, the results are encouraging— not only is a small but steady flow of new subscriptions coming through these Web sites every month, but, even more significant, many of them are from heretofore untapped new audiences, particularly from other parts of the world, where interested readers have formerly found it difficult to subscribe because of the difficulty of obtaining American currency and because of other logistical problems (Asimov's, for instance, has already picked up new subscribers from Australia, Great Britain,\n\nRussia, France, Ireland, Italy, and even the United Arab Emirites, and Analog has attracted subscribers from a similar range of countries); the availability of subscribing electronically online, with just the click of a few buttons required rather than a trip to the post office or at least a mailbox, is also proving attractive to domestic customers as well. The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction now has a working Internet Web site as well (http://www.sfsite.com/fsf/), as do magazines such as Absolute Magnitude and Weird Tales (see below for more information), and it is to be hoped that this is an area that will continue to grow, helping the beleaguered genre magazines to survive into the next century. One of the year's other big stories in the professional magazine market was the rebirth of Amazing Stories, reported to have died back in 1994. As it has done several times in its seventy-year-plus existence, Amazing Stories rose from the grave one more time in 1998, after memorial services had been read for it and the mourners were already home from the wake. This time, Amazing Stories was resurrected in a full-size, full-color format by Wizards of the Coast Inc., who recently bought TSR Inc., Amazing's former owner; the editor is Kim Mohan, who was the editor of Amazing Stories in its last incarnation. The new version features media fiction as well as more traditional science fiction; the first issue, debuted at the 1998 Worldcon, had a painting of the Starship Enterprise on the cover, and in its first three issues to date, the magazine has featured several Star Trek stories, a Babylon 5 story, a Star*Drive™ story, and other media-and-gaming related stuff, including nonfiction media and gaming columns. On the other hand, the magazine has also featured some good to excellent non-media-oriented core science fiction by Ursula K. Le Guin, Kristine Kathryn Rusch, Eliot Fintushel, Uncle River, Orson Scott Card, and others, and has featured science columns by people such as Ben Bova and Gregory Benford, as well as book reviews. All of this gives the new Amazing Stories a curiously schizophrenic nature, split down the middle between two different kinds of beasts, fish on this side of the line, fowl on the other, and I wonder how the audience is going to react to this— how either of the potential audiences are going to react to this. Are the media fans who pick up the magazine looking for a good Star Trek story going to like the mainline science fiction stories that make up much of the magazine's contents? Is the media stuff going to appeal to the regular SF fans, or turn them off and drive them away from the magazine? Clearly the idea is that Amazing Stories will draw support from both audiences, but I can't help wondering if the magazine can long survive being half one thing and half another, if one kind of thing must not eventually drive the other kind of thing out of the magazine. Which audience might drive out the other will ultimately be determined by which sort of fans are actually buying the magazine. (And since Wizards of the Coast clearly thinks that it's the media fans who are going to end up paying the bills, would it be unreasonable to wonder if the media fans won't end up demanding that they get rid of all the other crap and replace it with more media fiction instead?) This is an experiment well worth keeping an eye on; if it works the way the Powers That Be behind the magazine obviously hope it will, then the new Amazing Stories may help print science fiction tap into whole new and largely untouched audiences. At the very worst, ignoring the whole media-fiction controversy, Amazing Stories will be very welcome as a new high-end market in a genre that needs all the markets it can get, and signs are that it may well prove to be a respectable player in the short-fiction market in the years to come. Most of the news about Asimov's and Analog was covered above. The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction completed its second full year under new editor Gordon Van Gelder, and although the game of \"guess which stories were bought by Gordon and which were inventory left behind by former editor Kristine Kathryn Rusch\" still goes on, the Rusch inventory must surely be growing rather thin by now, and chances are from here on in that something that appears in the magazine was bought by Gordon. Although the magazine's circulation declined to a record low, F&SF is a magazine blessed with a very low operating overhead (basically, it's run out of the living rooms of people such as Ed Ferman and Gordon, with no office rents to pay and only minimum staff costs), and it's a pretty good bet that F&SF is still quite profitable even at its present circulation. New science columnists Pat Murphy and Paul Doherty have come in to supplement Gregory Benford, and the book reviews seem to rotate on an\n\nirregular basis between Robert K.J. Killheffer, Michelle West, Elizabeth Hand, and Douglas E. Winter, with a review column by Charles De Lint also in most issues, and occasionally a review column by Gordon himself. Paul Di Fillipo's occasional \"Plumage From Pegasus\" column is a hoot, often at least as inventive and imaginative as the stories themselves (my favorite this year was the slyly amusing \"Next Big Thing\" column). As mentioned above, F&SF has a new Internet Web site (http: www.sfsite.com/fsf/), one of a cluster of genre-magazine sites on the SF Site's new page, Fictionhome (see below). The British magazine Interzone completed its eighth full year as a monthly publication. Circulation remained more or less steady this year, as it has for several years now, with a subscriber base of about 2,000 and newsstand/bookstore sales of another 2,000. Every year, year in and year out, Interzone publishes some of the best fiction to be found in the entire magazine market, and really deserves to be read much more widely than it is. The magazine has been almost impossible to find on newsstands in the United States, even in SF specialty bookstores, but it has recently been redesigned to a slightly smaller format that brings it more in line with other U.S. magazines such as Science Fiction Age and Realms of Fantasy, and has engaged a new U.S. distributor. Maybe those changes, with luck, will mean that this excellent magazine will be easier to find on this side of the Atlantic in 1999. Interzone does have a Web site (http://www.riviera.demon.co.uk/interzon.htm), although there's not a lot of content there— you can subscribe to the magazine there, though, which is what counts. Science Fiction Age successfully completed its sixth full year of publication. Although the overall circulation of Science Fiction Age dropped again in 1998, following drops in 1997 and 1996, the magazine has several things going for it to offset these losses— for one thing, they attract a lot of paid advertisements, far more than any other magazine in the field (with the possible exception of their sister magazine, Realms of Fantasy); for another, as part of a parent company, Sovereign Media, that also runs four other magazines, with a fifth on the way, they can take advantage of \"economy of scale\" savings in printing and publishing costs, and the large number of magazines gives them all a bigger \"footprint\" on the newsstand (i.e., the amount of rack space devoted to all of the Sovereign Media magazines helps to insure that there's a place there for Science Fiction Age). Despite record low circulation figures, Science Fiction Age's publisher states that 1998 was the magazine's most profitable year yet. Artistically, Science Fiction Age had another strong year; for the last couple of years, in fact, Science Fiction Age has been one of the most reliable sources for good fiction, particularly for good solid core science fiction, in the entire magazine market. Oddly, Science Fiction Age does not have a Web site, although you'd think that their connections with the media world, particularly the Sci-Fi Channel (which has an extensive Web site of its own) would make that a natural. Realms of Fantasy is a companion magazine to Science Fiction Age, very similar to it in format (a slick, large-size, full-color magazine with lots of ads), except devoted to fantasy rather than science fiction. They completed their fourth full year of publication in 1998. In the last few years, under the editorship of veteran magazine editor Shawna McCarthy, Realms of Fantasy has established itself as by far the best of the all-fantasy magazines, with the best of the stories from it only rivaled for sophistication and eclecticism by the best of the fantasy stories published by The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction and Asimov's Science Fiction. (The other two fantasy magazines, the much longer established Marion Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy Magazine— in its tenth year of publication in 1998— and Weird Tales are much more erratic and undependable in literary quality and consistency.) Realms of Fantasy also does not have a Web site. As usual, short SF and fantasy also appeared in many magazines outside genre boundaries, from The New Yorker to Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine to Playboy. (Subscription addresses follow for those magazines hardest to find on the newsstands: The Magazine of\n\nFantasy & Science Fiction, Mercury Press, Inc., 143 Cream Hill Road, West Cornwall, CT, 06796, annual subscription— $33.97 in U.S.; Asimov's Science Fiction, Dell Magazines, P.O. Box 54033, Boulder, CO 80322-4033— $33.97 for annual subscription in U.S.; Analog, Dell Magazines, P.O. Box 54625, Boulder, CO 80323— $33.97 for annual subscription in U.S.; Interzone, 217 Preston Drove, Brighton BN1 6FL, United Kingdom, $60.00 for an airmail one year— twelve issues— subscription. Note that many of these magazines can also be subscribed to electronically online, at their various Web sites.) With all of the problems— especially rising production costs— threatening the magazine market (and perhaps ultimately all of publishing in general), many cyber-geeks have been insisting for the last few years that the future of fiction publishing, especially short-fiction publishing, lies in the online world, where \"online electronic magazines\" can be \"published\" without having to worry about escalating paper and production costs, and can be \"delivered\" right into the homes of the consumers without having to use outdated physical distribution systems as middlemen. What nobody has yet figured out is how you can reliably make money doing this, and therein lies the rub. To date, although the promise of \"online electronic publication\" remains large, it also largely remains a promise that is as yet unfulfilled. So far, in fact, the track record for such \"electronic magazines\" or \"e-zines\" is not very good. In the last few years, magazines such as Omni and Tomorrow have fled the troubled print magazine world for the supposed refuge of electronic publishing, but, in those cases, the refuge proved to be illusionary. Omni abandoned their print edition and instead established the Omni Online Internet Web site, but that died early in 1998 after a couple of years of operation (although it's hard to say whether it died because it wasn't bringing in enough money or, as some of the people involved with running the site insist, because the top brass at General Media lost interest in supporting it after the death of publisher Kathy Keeton, who had been the real driving force behind Omni's migration into the online world). Tomorrow magazine also abandoned its print edition and reinvented itself as an Internet e-zine called Tomorrow SF. Last year, I reported that Tomorrow SF was in the process of carrying out an interesting experiment, where, after \"publishing\" the first three online issues of Tomorrow SF for free, they had begun charging a \"subscription fee\" for access to the Web site, hoping that the audience would have been hooked enough by the free samples that they would continue to want the stuff enough to actually pay for it. Unfortunately, this experiment seems to have been a failure, which may raise doubts about the viability of the whole \"e-zine\" concept, since Tomorrow SF abruptly gave up its e-zine format in mid-1998. The Tomorrow SF site still exists (http://www.tomorrowsf.com), but it has switched over to being an archive site for reprint stories by editor Algis Budrys, rather than an ongoing \"magazine\" that publishes new stories by other hands. The blunt fact is that there are not really that many good, professional-level science fiction stories being published online at the moment (at least original stories, stories that are making their initial \"appearance\" online; there are a fairly large number of good reprint stories archived here and there around the Internet, on one site or another). Cyber-optimists insist that this will soon change dramatically— and they may even be right. At the moment, though, most publishers seem to be using their Web sites for pushing a physical product, selling subscriptions to print magazines and advertising forthcoming books, rather than using them as places to print original fiction online in electronic format. There are exceptions, though. When the plug was pulled on Omni Online, the indomitable Ellen Datlow, fiction editor of Omni Online and, before that, longtime fiction editor of the print Omni, got together with Robert K. J. Killheffer, former editor of Century magazine, and a few other people, and launched a new Internet Web site and\n\ne-zine, Event Horizon (http://www.eventhorizon.com/eventhorizon), which started operation in mid-1998, and which has already become, as was Omni Online before it, perhaps your best bet for finding good professional-quality original science fiction, fantasy, and horror stories published in electronic format on the Internet. Since going up, Event Horizon has published good work by Howard Waldrop (a story which is reprinted in this anthology for the first time ever in print format, having \"appeared\" before that only as phosphor dots on a screen), Terry Dowling, Kelly Link, K. W. Jeter, Michaela Roessner, and others, reprints by Robert Silverberg, Carter Scholz, and Pat Cadigan, and \"round-robin\" stories (written by four authors in collaboration, each writing a section in term) by authors such as Gwyneth Jones, Susan Casper, Scott Baker, Garry Kilworth, and others. Event Horizon also features reviews and other nonfiction pieces, regular columns by Barry N. Malzberg and Lucius Shepard, and hosts regularly scheduled live interactive interviews or \"chats\" with various prominent authors every Thursday night. Another interesting experiment, with the jury still out on this one, is taking place at Mind's Eye Fiction (http://tale.com/genres.htm), where you can read the first half of a story for free, but if you want to read the second half of the story, you have to pay for the privilege, which you can do by setting up an electronic account online and then clicking a few buttons; the fees are small, less than fifty cents per story in most cases. I think that this concept actually has a chance of working, although it would probably work better if they had some Bigger Name authors involved with the project, the kind of authors with lots of intensely loyal fans who might be willing and eager to pay a few cents to get an advance look at a story by their favorite author. This is another experiment that's worth keeping a close eye on, and one whose success or failure could have large implications for the future of SF-oriented e-zines on the Internet. A promising new SF-oriented e-zine is Dark Planet (http://www.sfsite.com/darkplanet/), which, in addition to reviews and other features, has published some professional-level work by Kelly Link, Gary A. Braunbeck, Ardath Mayhar, and others. Longer-established sites that are worth watching, although the quality of the fiction can be uneven and they are often not SF-oriented, include InterText (http://www.intertext.com/), and E-Scape (http://www.interink.com/escape.html). If none of these sites has satisfied your lust for e-zines, you can find lots of other genre \"electronic magazines\" by accessing http://dir.yahoo.com/Arts/Humanities/literature/genres/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy/Magazines/, but be warned— much of the stuff you'll find on these sites is awful, no better than slush-pile quality (there's an unbelievable amount of it out there, too; you could wade through these sites for a solid year and still have oceans of it left to go by the time you gave up). Links to e-magazines and related sites of interest can also be found at sites such as Locus Online, SF Site, Science Fiction Weekly, and SFF.NET (see below). After this point, original science fiction stories of professional quality become harder to find, rather scarce on the ground, in fact. Many of the remaining SF-oriented sites are associated with existent print magazines— Eidolon: SF Online (http://www.eidolon.net/); Aurealis (http://www.aurealis.hl.net/) Asimov's Science Fiction (http://www.asimovs.com/); Analog Science Fiction and Fact (http://www.analogsf.com/); The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction (http:www.sfsite.com/fsf/); Interzone (http://www.riviera.demon.co.uk/interzon.htm); Transversions (http://www.salmar.com/transversions/); Terra Incognita (http://www. voicenet.com/~incognit/); On Spec (http://www.icomm.ca/onspec/); Talebones (http://www.nventure.com/talebones/)— and although many of them have extensive archives of material, both fiction and nonfiction, previously published by the print versions of the magazines, few of them publish original online-only fiction with any regularity; most don't publish it at all, in fact. Magazines like Asimov's, Analog, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, and others, regularly run teaser excerpts from stories coming up in forthcoming issues, and occasionally a chunk from an upcoming novel will appear somewhere, but complete original stories are rarer (I've run one online original, by Michael Swanwick and Sean Swanwick, on the Asimov's site, and would like to do more of this, but finding the money to finance it is not easy). Eidolon Online published a\n\ngood original story last year, which appeared in our Fifteenth Annual Collection, but don't seem to have done much along those lines since. Talebones seems to have published some original stories online (it's sometimes hard to tell, as attribution is often nonexistent) by Terry McGarry, Mary Soon Lee, Uncle River, Darell Schweitzer, and others. A good general site where you can be pretty sure of finding something of quality to read is the British Infinity Plus (http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/iplus/), which features a very extensive selection of reprint stories, most by British authors, as well as extensive biographical and bibliographical information, book reviews, critical essays, and so forth— as far as I can tell, though, there are few if any original online-only stories published here, although they do publish novel extracts from upcoming novels. Fiction is not the only SF-oriented stuff of interest to check out on the Internet, however. Some of the most prominent SF-related sites on the Internet, and some of the sites that I visit the most frequently, are the general-interest sites that, while they don't publish fiction, do publish lots of reviews, critical articles, and genre-oriented news of various kinds. One of the most substantial of these sites is SF Site (www.sfsite.com/), which over the last year has turned itself into one of the most important genre-related sites on the whole Web. Their home page features an extensive selection of reviews of books, games, and magazines, interviews, critical retrospective articles, letters, and so forth, plus a huge archive of past reviews; in addition, starting with Asimov's and Analog early in 1998, they've become the host site for the Web pages of a significant percentage of all the SF/fantasy print magazines in existence, including The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, and the recently assembled DNA Publishing group (see below) of Absolute Magnitude, Pirate Writings, Weird Tales, Aboriginal SF, and Dreams of Decadence (which can be accessed directly at http://www.sfsite.com/dnaweb/home.htm). In early 1999, they also instituted a section called Fictionhome (http://www.sfsite.com/fiction/fichome.htm), where reviews of and links to all of the above magazines can be found, and which also plays host to the electronic version of Tangent called Tangent Online, one of the few places online where you can read regularly scheduled reviews of short fiction, and to the online version of Science Fiction Chronicle. Another general-interest site that's one of my most frequent destinations while netsurfing is Locus Online (http://www.locusmag.com), the online version of the newsmagazine Locus; Locus Online is a great source for fast-breaking genre-related news, where it sometimes shows up weeks before it even makes it into the print Locus, but I must admit that to a large extent I read the site for the online version of Mark Kelly's short fiction-review column, the other place on the net where you can find regularly appearing reviews of SF and fantasy short fiction; there are also book reviews, critical lists, database archives, links to other sites of interest, and the like here. Another valuable general-interest site, one that's been around long enough to be almost venerable by the mayfly standards of the Internet, is Science Fiction Weekly (http://www.scifiweekly.com), which is somewhat more media-and-gaming oriented than SF Site or Locus Online, but which does feature book reviews every issue, of both new releases and classic reprints, and also features an erudite, opinionated, and occasionally fiercely controversial column by John Clute, perhaps SF's premiere critic. A new entry in this category is SFRevu (http: www.sfrevv.com//members.aol.com/sfrevu/), another site full of book and media reviews, and other genre-related information. SFF NET (http//www.sff.net) is a huge site that functions as a home away from home for many writers, featuring dozens of home pages for SF writers, genre-oriented \"live chats,\" and, among other lists of data, the Locus Magazine Index 1984-1996, which is an extremely valuable research tool; you can also link to the Science Fiction Writers of America page from here, where valuable research data and reading lists are to be found as well, or you can link directly to the SFFWA Web Page at http://www.sfwa.org/. Live online interviews with prominent genre writers are now offered on a regular basis on many sites, including interviews sponsored by Asimov's and Analog and conducted by Gardner Dozois on the Sci-Fi Channel (http://www.scifi.com/chat/— there's also an enormous amount of SF-media-related stuff available here) every other Tuesday night at 9:00 P.M. EST, interviews conducted by Ellen Datlow every Thursday night at 9:00 P.M. EST on the Event Horizon site (http://www.eventhorizon.com/eventhorizon/), regular scheduled interviews on the Cybling site\n\n(http://www.cybling.com/), and occasional interviews on the Talk City site (http://www.talkcity.com/). Many Bulletin Board Services, such as GEnie, Delphi (which also now has a Web site, http://www0.delphi.com/sflit/), Compuserve, and AOL, have large online communities of SF writers and fans (with GEnie having perhaps the largest and most active such community). Most of these services also feature regularly scheduled live interactive real-time \"chats\" or conferences, in which anyone interested in SF is welcome to participate, as does SFF NET— the SF-oriented chat on Delphi, the one with which I'm most familiar, and one which gives you the opportunity to schmooze with well-known professional SF writers in a relaxed and informal atmosphere, starts every Wednesday at about 10:00 P.M. EST. Many of the criticalzines also have Web sites, including The New York Review of Science Fiction (http://www.sfsite.com/isfdb/nyrsf.html), Nova Express (http://www.delphi.com/sflit/novaexpress/index.html), Speculations (http://www.speculations.com/), and SF Eye (http://www.empathy.com/eyeball/sfeye.html), although most of these sites are not particularly active ones. And for a funny and often iconoclastic slant on genre-oriented news, from multiple Hugo-winner David Langford, check out the online version of his fanzine Ansible (http://www. dcs.gla.ac.uk/Ansible/). There may not be a lot of original SF being published on the Net as yet, but the whole SF community on the Web is growing so fast, and is not only becoming larger but, perhaps more importantly, becoming more intensely interconnected, with links being forged from site to site, that it's an area well worth keeping an eye on. I suspect that it's an area that will become more and more important as we penetrate ever deeper into the new century ahead. *** It was a year of big changes in the semiprozine market, some of them potentially quite positive, others, alas, not so positive. The big story in the semiprozine market for 1998 was the consolidation of several struggling fiction semiprozines under the same roof. Warren Lapine's DNA Publications (previously the publisher of Absolute Magnitude) bought up several competing magazines this year, ending up with six of them: Absolute Magnitude, The Magazine of Science Fiction Adventures; Pirate Writings, Tales of Fantasy, Mystery & Science Fiction; Aboriginal Science Fiction; Weird Tales (back to its old title again after several issues in exile as Worlds of Fantasy and Horror); the all-vampire-fiction magazine Dreams of Decadence; and the new Australian magazine Altair (see below)— Warren became owner of all of these but Aboriginal Science Fiction, which he is managing; the current editors of all the magazines continue to provide the editorial content for a fee or a percentage, and DNA Publications handles the production, circulation, and the business end. The hope is that this move will enable DNA Publications to take advantage of the economies of scale and an increased \"footprint\" on the newsstand— the same strategy employed by Sovereign Media— as well as generating savings by streamlining the whole operation and making it more efficient. This could well work, as long as Warren hasn't bitten off more than he can chew and becomes overextended and swamped— if he can handle the workload, this could be a big boost to all of the above magazines, some of which have been struggling in the marketplace and could frankly use a boost. So this could turn out to be one of the most positive developments in the semiprozine market in some years. (Warren's other challenge will be to stabilize publication schedules, if he can— most of the above magazines only produced two issues apiece this year instead of following their announced publication schedules, a chronic problem throughout all of the\n\nsemiprozine market— and to try to produce a more reliable level of quality in the fiction published by those magazines; at the moment, quality is all over the place, from very good to at-best mediocre.) As mentioned above, the Web site for all of the DNA Publications magazines is http://www.sfsite.com/dnaweb/home.htm. Much of the rest of the news in this market is not so positive— some of it is downright bad, in fact. The eccentric and eclectic fiction semiprozine Crank! officially died this year, after publishing one last issue, as editor Bryan Cholfin announced that he was giving up the magazine so that he could concentrate on his publishing career; Cholfin is now working for Gordon Van Gelder at St. Martin's Press. With the death of Century— and, with no new issue in more than three years, I do consider it to be dead, in spite of occasional protests to the contrary, especially as editor Robert K. J. Killheffer has moved on to other projects— both of the most ambitious and literarily sophisticated American fiction semiprozines of the '90s are gone, a dispiriting track record for such magazines. With Crank! and Century dead, the most ambitious of the remaining American fiction semiprozines, and the one which is probably producing the highest percentage of high-end professional-level work, is newcomer Terra Incognita, which this year published an excellent story by Liz Williams, as well as good work by Kandis Elliot, John C. Waugh, Judy Klass, and others— the only problem is, they only managed to publish one out of their scheduled four issues this year, just like last year; they'll have to work hard on their reliability if they want to be the Contender that they potentially could be in this market; otherwise, they chance following Century into oblivion down the same old drain. The longer-established Tales of the Unanticipated, although not quite up to the same level of accomplishment, did publish some intriguing stuff this year by Eleanor Arnason, Lyda Morehouse, Sue Isle, Martha A. Hood, and others. Talebones, Fiction on the Dark Edge, although officially a horror semiprozine, seems to be adding a lot more science fiction and fantasy to its editorial mix these days (making it more attractive to me, anyway), and remains a lively and promising little magazine, definitely one to watch. Space & Time has been more uneven, but seems to be getting national distribution on some newsstands these days, and so may become more of a player in this market. If there were any issues of Non-Stop, Xizquil, Argonaut Science Fiction, Next Phase, Plot Magazine, or The Thirteenth Moon Magazine out this year, I didn't see them; I suspect at least some of these magazines are dead. A new SF fiction semiprozine called Age of Wonder published its first issue in early 1998 and died before the middle of the year, perhaps a new record even in the semiprozine market, where magazines often come and go with the speed of mayflies. The lead story from that first (and only) issue, by Gregory Benford, appeared later in the year under a different title in Science Fiction Age. Turning to our neighbor to the north, there are two Canadian fiction semiprozines, the long-established On Spec, one of the longest-running of all the fiction semiprozines, and a promising newcomer called TransVersions. On Spec has seemed a bit sunk in the doldrums for the last few years, with most of the fiction in it gray, oversolemn, and not particularly entertaining, publishing little good core science fiction, except for near-future dystopias (the magazine in general seems to take itself too seriously, as witness its annoying new slogan \"more than just science fiction\"— to which I must admit my immediate grumpy reaction was \"some science fiction every once in a while would be nice, though\"). Still, On Spec is one of the most reliably published of all the fiction semiprozines, and has published a lot of worthwhile stuff over the years, so we shouldn't give up on it; the magazine is set to go to a single editor instead of the \"collective\" that has been editing it (I don't believe that a committee is any better at selecting fiction than it is at any other task), which may perhaps perk up the fiction. TransVersions is also uneven, with some stuff at a decent professional level, and some not, but it seems to have more of a sense of fun about it than On Spec has had recently, and is livelier and less pretentious.\n\nTurning our eyes overseas, two of the three longest-established fiction semiprozines (the other one is On Spec) are published in Australia: Aurealis and Eidolon. Although both magazines had their usual difficulty sticking to their quarterly publication schedule, they also published a fair amount of good professional-level fiction, by writers such as Terry Dowling, Simon Brown, Russell Blackford, and others in Aurealis (the Double Issue of Aurealis, Aurealis 20/21, also functions as an Alternate History anthology, about possible alternate futures of Australia), and writers such as William Dowding, Leanne Frahm, Sean Williams, and Simon Brown, and others in Eidolon; Eidolon is also home to perhaps the most technically difficult and formidable science column in the industry, likely over the head of even most Analog readers, by Greg Egan (the sort of column where the text says, \"Therefore, we can see that\" and then goes on to a solid page or two of equations) as well as a less-demanding new column by Howard Waldrop. Perhaps because of the \"boom\" that seems to be taking place in the Australian science fiction world, the Australian stuff seems to be more vigorous and substantial than a lot of the other material available elsewhere in the semiprozine market. Another new magazine joined the roster of Australian semiprozines this year, the promising newcomer Altair, which published two digest-size issues (the same format as Aurealis and Eidolon) this year out of a scheduled four, and which is soon going to be available in a full-size semiannual \"American edition\" from DNA Publications. The fiction in Altair is also uneven, as it is in most semiprozines, but they did feature some good professional-level work by Stephen Dedman, Ian Watson, Ben Jeapes, and others; they also publish a fair amount of nonfiction, but I think they could lose most of it without losing anything of real value (especially the beginner-level How to Write articles) and have more room for fiction. (Altair has a Web site at http://www.sfsite.com/altair/, and I suspect they'll soon be accessible at the DNA Publications site as well.) Another promising newcomer, a full-size, full-color British magazine called Odyssey, published five issues this year, and seemed to be struggling to establish an identity for itself; torn between being a science fiction magazine, a horror/fantasy magazine, and a media/gaming-oriented magazine, it managed to be sort of all and none of the above at the same time. The fiction was wildly uneven, ranging from ameuter-level stuff to good professional-level work by Ian Watson, Peter T. Garratt, Charles Stross, Ben Jeapes, Constance Ash, Mary Gentle, and others. My advice would be to concentrate more on the fiction, especially good solid core science fiction, and let some of the other stuff go. The covers here were often quite attractive, among the most striking in the industry, but the interior layout is often of the \"hip\" sort that makes it difficult to read the text, and something has to be done about that— this problem actually seemed to be getting worse rather than better in later issues, culminating in issue 6, where printing stories like Charles Stross's \"Extracts from the Club Diary\" in light type over gray pages already printed with an illustration made large parts of the story almost impossible to read. A little less coolness and a little more legibility, please! Despite such problems, this is a promising magazine, and could be very good indeed if it manages to shape itself up. Most of the other British fiction semiprozines lean heavily toward \"slipstream\" and literary surrealism of various sorts; the most prominent of these at the moment seem to be The Third Alternative and the long-established Back Brain Recluse. I think there might have been an issue of Irish semiprozine Albedo 1 this year, but, if so, I missed it. I don't follow the horror semiprozine market much any more, but there the most prominent magazines seem to be the highly respected Cemetery Dance, and perhaps Talebones. Turning to the critical magazines, as always, Charles N. Brown's Locus and Andy Porter's SF Chronicle , remain your best bets among that subclass of semiprozines known as \"newszines,\" and are your best resources if you're looking for publishing news or an overview of what's happening in the genre. The New York Review of Science Fiction, edited by David G. Hartwell, completed its tenth full year of publication, once again not only publishing its scheduled twelve issues but publishing them all on time— in the entire semiprozine market, fiction and non-fiction, this is a trick that only Locus and The New York Review of Science Fiction seem to know how to do; most other magazines count themselves lucky if\n\nthey can manage to bring out half their scheduled issues. As always, the magazine was full of tasty and informative stuff, articles and reviews that ran the gamut from fascinating to infuriating (sometimes both at once), and eclectic little gems such as \"Read This\" lists by various well-known authors. Other intriguing critical stuff can be found in Steve Brown's Science Fiction Eye and in Lawrence Person's Nova Express— when you can find them; actually, this was a red-letter year for Nova Express, which managed two issues in the same year, something of a record. There were big changes in the offing this year for David A. Truesdale's Tangent, which for several years now has performed an invaluable service by providing a place where interested readers can find reviews of most of the year's short fiction, something that can be found almost nowhere else in the field, except for Mark Kelly's short fiction review column in Locus. In late 1997 and early 1998, however, there were signs that Tangent was becoming bogged down, and they began delaying and missing issues (my own feeling was that Truesdale was making the magazine too complicated, taking on too many new columns and features, more every issue, it seemed; the basic task they had to do— covering the year's short fiction— was huge and complex enough by itself without having to deal with all of that other stuff as well). Only one issue of Tangent came out in 1998, a \"Special Double Collector's Issue\" released in time for the Baltimore Worldcon, and it was immediately evident that most of the reviews in the issue were of stuff from the previous year; clearly, Tangent was falling behind, and rumors began to circulate that the magazine would soon disappear and be heard from no more. Instead, I'm very pleased to say, it metamorphosed rather than died, and can now be found in a new form as Tangent Online (http://www.sfsite.com/tangent/index.htm), part of SF Site's short-fiction-oriented new site, Fictionhome , and where, liberated from the constraints of printing, production, and distribution, it has already \"published\" four issues in electronic online format, with a return to something like its old vigor (although there are still too many columns and features, in my opinion, even in the online version; the other stuff we can get elsewhere— Tangent should stick to reviewing stories). Since the loss of Tangent would be a major blow to the field, we should all breathe a sigh of relief. An as-yet unanswered question is, What will be the fate of the print version of Tangent? Supposedly it will continue, as a semiannual supplement to the online version— but it wouldn't entirely surprise me to see the print version fade and Tangent Online become the \"real\" version instead. Speculations, which features writing-advice articles as well as extensive sections of market reports and market news, remains a useful resource for young or would-be authors.

Starlight 2 (Tor), edited by Patrick Nielsen Hayden, was probably the best original science fiction anthology published this year in the United States, but the competition it had to overcome to claim the title this year was even weaker than the competition the original Starlight 1 had to overcome back in 1996. Starlight 2 is still a superior anthology, containing two of the year's best stories, by Robert Charles Wilson and Ted Chiang, and good, quirky, ambitious work by several other authors, but it is by no means as strong overall as Starlight 1 was, and doesn't seem to be generating the same kind of critical buzz, either. As mentioned, my favorites in Starlight 2 were Ted Chiang's complex and subtle novella \"Story of Your Life\" and Robert Charles Wilson's clever metaphysical reductio ad absurdum \"Divided by Infinity.\" A step below those was Ellen Kushner's \"The Death of the Duke,\" an elegant fantasy story strongly reminiscent in mood of later-period Le Guin (a high compliment as far as I'm concerned), Geoffrey A. Landis's bitter \"Snow,\" David Langford's somewhat less bitter but more complicated take on similar territory, \"A Game of Consequences,\" and Esther M. Friesner's unflinchingly brutal \"Brown Dust,\" definitely not an example of Friesner in her more characteristic Funny Stuff or Sentimental modes (considered in light of Roger Zelazny's well-known dictum that a short story should be the last chapter of a novel you don't actually write, it struck me as interesting that Friesner's \"Brown Dust\" reads more like the first chapter of a novel she didn't actually write; it wouldn't be hard for her to go on from here and actually write such a novel either, in spite of what happens to her protagonist in the course of the story). A step below these were several stories I didn't have a strong reaction to one way or the other, competent but not (to me, anyway) exciting, including Susanna Clarke's kidnapped-by-faeries fantasy, \"Mrs Mabb,\" Martha Soukup's better-watch-out-what-you-wish-for story on the borderline of science fiction, \"The House of Expectations,\" and M. Shayne Bell's entertaining but somewhat unlikely time-travel story (I can't really believe that the minor change he posits would have the wide-sweeping effect he claims it would have), \"Lock Down.\" Everything else in the book struck me as flawed to one degree or another. Raphael Carter's \"Congenital Agenesis of Gender Ideation\" has some very intriguing ideas, but, as fiction presented in the form of an academic paper, it is also as dry as the form it is mimicking. Carter Scholz's surrealistic \"The Amount to Carry\" is vividly and lyrically written, but probably a good deal too long; toward the end, it began to seem dull rather than nightmarish, and I doubt I would have finished it if I hadn't been paid to do so; it also breaks no new ground for Scholz, being the sort of territory he's\n\ncovered several times in the past. Angélica Gorodischer's \"The End of a Dynasty,\" elegantly translated by Ursula K. Le Guin, has some amusing touches, but again seems ultimately uninvolving and overly stylized to me. I responded least well to Jonathan Lethem's \"Access Fantasy,\" which in spite of its pose of hip modernism comes across (to me, anyway) as recycled Galaxy-era satire, starting out in a traffic jam on the highway that's been locked in place so long that whole families have been living in their cars for decades, raising their children there, and going on to become a killer satire of the advertising industry. Overall, a fair number of the stories here seem dry and abstract to me; not only is there not much color, action, or (with a few significant exceptions) sense-of-wonder stuff here, but there's really not a lot of genuine emotion of any sort generated by most of the stories. Highly intelligent, but cool and somewhat remote. I suppose that \"dry\" is as good an overall characterizing adjective as any for this volume. The Chiang novella and the Robert Charles Wilson story, though, are among the best stories of the year, and, along with the Friesner, the Landis, the Kushner, and a few others, definitely make this anthology worth the price of admission, even as an expensive hardcover, even if it's not as memorable overall as the original Starlight 1 had been. With these two volumes, Starlight has firmly established itself as one of the most important anthology series of recent years, and it is to be hoped that it will continue for many years to come. A worthwhile follow-up candidate for the title of best original SF anthology of the year, behind Starlight 2, is harder to find, although I guess I would have to vote for Lord of the Fantastic (Avon Eos), edited by Martin H. Greenberg, the Roger Zelazny tribute anthology, even though it contains almost as much fantasy as it does science fiction, and some of the best stories in it are reprints, having appeared previously in Science Fiction Age and Asimov's Science Fiction. The contents of the anthology break down roughly into two parts: those stories that really have nothing in particular to do with Roger Zelazny or his work, and that could have appeared with equal justification in any other market (several of these authors claim \"inspiration\" by Zelazny as a rationale for their inclusion here, but that inspiration often doesn't show up on the page to any noticeable degree), and those that either use Zelazny characters and settings or attempt to do a pastiche or homage to his characteristic and highly individual writing style, even when, as in Walter Jon Williams's \"Lethe,\" they don't use any actual thematic material from Zelazny's published work (as a subset of this category, there are also several stories that use the author himself as a character, embroiling him with time-travelers or aliens, a type of story familiar from the earlier Jack Williamson and Ray Bradbury tribute anthologies, and from the Isaac Asimov memorial anthology; the most ingenious story of this type is Robert Silverberg's \"Call Me Titan,\" which also does a moderately good job of pastiching Zelazny's exuberant style); both categories can then be broken down further into successful and less successful stories, with good and bad stuff in both. It's an uneven anthology, with a lot of weak material in it— although only one story, Jennifer Roberson's \"Mad Jack,\" was bad enough to make me throw the book across the room in disgust— but also with good to excellent work by William Browning Spencer, William Sanders, John Varley, and Neil Gaiman, solid entertaining work by Nina Kiriki Hoffman, Jack Williamson, Pati Nagle, Steven Brust, John J. Miller, Jane Lindskold, Jack C. Haldeman II, and others, plus the above-mentioned reprints by Robert Silverberg, Walter Jon Williams, and Gregory Benford, all of high quality, and all of which will still count toward the strength of the volume as far as the average reader is concerned. It was interesting to me that so many of the authors who did use characters or settings from Zelazny's work chose fantasy rather than science fiction, and that much of their inspiration was drawn from Zelazny's later work rather than from his earlier, more famous stuff— there is nothing here that draws on Lord of Light or the Amber novels, for instance, but there are several stories that seem to have been\n\ninspired by Zelazny's late fantasy A Night in the Lonesome October, and at least one that draws its inspiration from Zelazny's Flying Dutchman fantasy, And Only I Am Escaped to Tell Thee, although that produces one of the book's strongest stories, the Varley (which is, however, a story that doesn't really seem to owe that much stylistically or conceptually to Zelazny, once given the basic theme, and could have appeared anywhere without the Zelazny connection being particularly noticeable). Steven Brust does draw on the background of an alien-dominated Earth from This Immortal, a background rich enough to support a dozen more stories, and I can see that this one might even have been a story Zelazny himself might have chosen to tell (although if he did, certainly he would have found a way to tell it that didn't bog the story down in technical poker terms to such a degree that the narrator has to call a halt to the narration to explain them every couple of paragraphs!), and Nina Kiriki Hoffman draws on Isle of the Dead, but I would like to have seen more such use made of Zelazny's colorful worlds and characters, especially the science fictional ones; with such material to draw on, it seems a shame to settle for standard bland contemporary-fantasy backgrounds, as several authors do. Some authors reflect Zelazny's fondness for playing mix-and-match with elements from different mythological systems, although only Silverberg and William Sanders really do this well, and only Sanders succeeds at catching a bit of the flavor of caustic humor and deliberate playful anachronism that usually characterized Zelazny's own ventures into this area. Of all the book's authors, only William Browning Spencer and Neil Gaiman come close to catching the flavor of high-spirited, rapid-fire, pyrotechnic outrageousness that characterized early Zelazny at his best, and only Neil Gaiman really plays with the language in anything like the exuberant, freewheeling, risk-taking way that Zelazny played with it in his prime. At a rather modest (by today's standards) cover price of $14.00, Lord of the Fantastic is a fairly good reading bargain, and will certainly be worth the money to most readers. Another of 1998's few worthwhile anthologies was Bending the Landscape: Science Fiction, Original Gay and Lesbian Writing (Overlook), edited by Nicola Griffith and Stephen Pagel, although this was not as strong an anthology overall as 1997's Bending the Landscape: Fantasy. The anthology contains a lot of minor material, and even most of the good stories here provide either a strong SF element or a strong gay element, but rarely integrate both elements in a balanced way in a single story. In some of the stories, such as Keith Hartman's \"Sex, Guns, and Baptists,\" both elements are superficial and arbitrary, since there's no intrinsic reason why the story (a familiar one about a private investigator spying on an illicit couple in a hotel-room tryst, and the consequences that arise when his emotionally unstable client finds out what's going on inside) needed to be told about a gay couple in the first place, and the very minimal SF elements present, like the PI's \"fiber-optic snake,\" are window-dressing, so that there was no compelling reason for this story to be either about gay people or a science fiction story. To show that SF and gay themes can be combined in such a way that each is dependent on the other, and the synthesis gives the author a way to say something about society that otherwise could not easily be said, one only needs to point to Greg Egan's \"Cocoon\" (only the first such example to come to mind), but there is little here that successfully integrates the anthology's two elements in an organic way. There are excellent stories here by Ellen Klages (the most successful of the book's authors in providing a story where both the SF element and the gay element are integral to the plot) and Jim Grimsley (whose story is the most emotionally powerful in the book— but also has so little to do with homosexuality that the gay element is almost subliminal), as well as good work by Rebecca Ore, Nancy Kress, Mark W. Tiedemann, L. Timmel Duchamp, Charles Sheffield, and others— but at $26.95, it's rather steeply priced for what you get, and some readers may be disappointed. (The Overlook Press, Peter Mayer Publishers, Inc., Lewis Hollow Road, Woodstock, New York 12498— $26.95 for Bending the Landscape: Science Fiction .) Also interesting, if not quite in the same weight class as the anthologies above, is the mixed original-and-reprint anthology More Amazing Stories (Tor), edited by Kim Mohan. As I read this book,\n\nI found myself wondering how best to describe the flavor of the \"typical Amazing story\"; there is such a flavor, I think, but articulating it precisely is difficult. The typical Amazing story is less rigorous than an Analog story, less literarily intense than an Asimov's story ... which ought to make it roughly the same as an F&SF story, but that's not quite it either; there are noticeable differences in flavor between the usual Amazing story and the usual F&SF story as well, although the stuff in Amazing is perhaps somewhat closer to F&SF material in feel than it is to either Analog or Asimov's. About the closest I can come to it is that many of the stories in Amazing mix science fiction and fantasy in the same story, producing stories that can either be looked at as hybrids of SF and fantasy (if you're feeling charitable) or nonrigorous SF that doesn't concern itself much with scientific plausibility or social consistency (if you're not). The best story by a good margin in the anthology, for instance, Ursula K. Le Guin's reprint story \"Unchosen Love,\" is a ghost story that takes place in a science fiction milieu. The best of the original stories here, Eleanor Arnason's \"The Gauze Banner,\" is a \"translation\" into English of a consciously crafted bit of mythology, featuring gods with vast supernatural powers, created by an alien living in another science fiction milieu (and who probably doesn't believe in the actual existence of the gods he's describing either). SF, or fantasy? Or a bit of both? The life-transforming \"miracles\" for sale in Nancy Springer's \"The Time of Her Life\" are couched superficially in terms of technology, and yet that technology is never really explained or rationalized and makes little real sense either in itself or as part of a society, and the shopkeepers who proffer it are called \"angels.\" Along the same lines, not even a token scientific double-talk explanation of the machine that keeps a mother's baby in some sort of suspension, waking it for an hour every few years, is ever offered in Marti McKenna's \"Perchance to Dream,\" and little time is wasted wondering about what the overall effect on society such technology would be; it's merely an enabling device to allow the mother to grow old while her baby stays forever young, and a magic spell would have done the job just as effectively, if not more so. And so it goes with story after story here, many of which are presented as science fiction, and couched in SF's terminology, but where the fantastic element is so unexamined and unexplained, and exists in such isolation from the rest of the society, that the story might just as well be fantasy. It strikes me that the closest relative to \"the typical Amazing story,\" with its SF furniture and fantasy aesthetic, is probably not to be found in print literature at all, but rather in television— it's very close to the mix used in television's The Twilight Zone, where the premises could shock or amuse, but very rarely stood up under any sort of closer examination. Like The Twilight Zone, sometimes the results are very entertaining; sometimes they're just annoying. The original stories here are, for the most part, solid and entertaining but not particularly memorable or first-rate; the best of the lot is the Arnason, with good work also being done by S. N. Dyer, L. A. Taylor, Don Webb, and others, but the anthology as a whole is strengthened by the presence of some good reprint work, including the above-mentioned Le Guin story and reprint stories by Howard Waldrop, Gregory Benford, James Alan Gardner, and Philip K. Dick, and is further bolstered by an interesting article about the work of Philip K. Dick by Robert Silverberg, so the package as a whole does deliver value for your money, although at a somewhat steep cover price of $24.95, it's probably a marginal buy; it would be a better deal if it was being offered as a cheaper trade paperback or mass-market. An unusual item is Dreaming Down-Under, edited by Jack Dann and Janeen Webb, a huge mixed anthology of Australian science fiction, fantasy, horror, and \"magic realism\" (by which the editors seem to mean literary surrealism of various sorts), which may well be the best overall anthology of the year, pound for pound, although few American readers will have seen it, and it's so inclusive across so many genre lines that it's hard to know where to categorize it. In the United States, the different genres represented in Dreaming Down-Under are to a large extent kept discrete; you may see a couple of\n\nthem represented in the same magazine or anthology, but rarely all of them. This mixing of different genres in one literary package seems to be characteristic of Australia, though— the new Australian Best of the Year anthology series edited by Jonathan Strahan and Jeremy G. Byrne is set up that way, and you'll find a similar mix of genres in most issues of Australian semiprozines such as Eidelon and Aurealis. (For what it's worth, the cover copy here refers to this mix as \"wild-side fiction,\" listing its elements as \"fantasy, horror, magic realism, cyberpunk and science fiction\"; interesting that those last two seem to be considered to be separate subgenres!) For someone accustomed to American practice, it may seem as though there are really several different books here in one package, and, in fact, it would be easy enough to carve Dreaming Down-Under up into separate volumes of science fiction, fantasy, and horror (which would still leave a few literary \"unclassifiables\" left over!) ... and I wonder if indeed this won't be its fate when the American publishing industry finally comes to grips with the problem of an American edition (or editions). Still, having so many different genres represented in one volume does give you a one-stop overview across the entire spectrum of the booming Australian publishing scene, and the anthology is worthwhile for that alone, as well as serving as an introduction to a great many writers of whom most of the American audience will not have heard before. For me, the most effective stories here were usually the ones that had the most local color, the ones that, if science fiction, dealt the most centrally with the special problems and characteristics of Australian society and culture, or, if fantasy, the ones that centered around aboriginal mythology or the (sometimes hybrid) folkways developed by the Europeans after settlement; the further away from Australian settings, themes, and concerns the stories got, the weaker they became generally. There is a fair amount of weak material here: there's too much second-generation cyberpunk, which is beginning to feel a bit tired fifteen years after Neuromancer, the horror is mild by contemporary American standards, and some of the stories are minor enough that it seems likely that they were used only because of a (perhaps misplaced) desire to be as inclusive as possible across the wide spectrum of currently active Australian writers (although, in this context, the absence of Greg Egan, probably Australia's hottest genre writer of the '90s, may be remarked upon by some)— but the book is so huge that a strong still-larger-than-normal-size anthology could still be put together out of what's left. Dreaming Down-Under contains excellent science fiction by Chris Lawson, Cherry Wilder, Damien Broderick, Terry Dowling, David J. Lake, Sean Williams, Dirk Strasser, and others, good fantasy by Stephen Dedman, Lucy Sussex, Simon Brown, Jane Routley, Rosaleen Love, Sean McMullen, Kelly Greenwood, and others, and good horror by Wynne Whiteford, Sara Douglas, Ian Nichols, Paul Brandon, and others. The most frustrating item here is part of a science fiction novella by the late George Turner, left unfinished when he died; what there is of it here is first-rate work (if the rest of the story lived up to the promise of what's on the page here, it probably would have been the best story in the book, and one of the best of the year). It's a tragedy that Turner was unable to complete it, but I wonder if it was really a good idea to include an unfinished novella in the anthology, although no doubt Turner completists will be glad to have it; the casual reader, though, is likely to find it just frustrating. On the whole, then, this is an anthology that's well worth the money, both in itself and as a window on a whole fascinating world of science fiction and fantasy that's developed in parallel to but distinct from American genre work and even British genre work, a world produced by convergent evolution, in some ways familiar, and yet also various and strange. Alternate Generals (Baen), edited by Harry Turtledove, is both more substantial and less flamboyant than most of the long string of Alternate History anthologies edited in recent years by Mike Resnick, for both better and worse; there are no really first-rate stories here, as occasionally did crop up as the high points of the Resnick Alternate anthologies (Maureen McHugh's \"The Lincoln Train,\" for instance, or Pat Cadigan's \"Dispatches from the Revolution\"), but if the highs are not as high, the lows are not as low, either. You get far fewer of the kind of stories that postulate the wildly improbable if not impossible (and\n\noften downright silly) scenarios (\"Suppose Mother Teresa formed an outlaw gang during the Depression with Einstein and Albert Schweitzer!\", \"Suppose Buddy Holly became president of the United States!\") that often filled the Resnick anthologies, stories that, in the more extreme cases, strike me as being just fantasy stories with all-star celebrity casts rather than valid science fiction at all (the same way I feel about Kim Newman and Eugene Byrne's \"Alternate History\" stories that have been running for years in Interzone). Not surprisingly, considering that Harry Turtledove is the editor, the stories here are less frothy and \"playful\" and more stick-to-your-ribs substantial, with less emphasis on the self-consciously \"outrageous\" juxtaposition of wild and crazy images and much more emphasis on historical scenarios that, although often unlikely, actually could happen— which, in my opinion, is where the interest of most good Alternate History stories lies: seeing how radical a change in subsequent history you can produce by altering only one or two historical parameters, things that might actually have happened but which (in this universe) did not. The trick is to do that without spinning away into anything-can-happen-What-if-Napoleon-had-a-B-52-at-Waterloo? fantasies, which for serious Alternate History writers is the equivalent of the hard science writers's famous complaint about \"playing with the net down.\" The authors here do a pretty good job of pulling off that trick, on the whole, walking the line between \"imaginative\" and \"impossible.\" The overall mood of the anthology is serious, if not somber (in a few cases, almost a bit stodgy), and many of the alternate history scenarios are ingenious, and elegantly minimalist, producing substantial ultimate changes from small changes in initial conditions. \"Substantial,\" in fact, is a good overall word to describe this particular book. It helps to be a history buff if you're really going to appreciate Alternate Generals— and, in fact, it helps to be a military history buff; if you're not, you may have difficulty here and there figuring out how and why things have changed from the actual history of our world; you may not even know what the actual events were in the first place, which diminishes the impact of seeing them cleverly changed, always a fundamental problem for Alternate History; without hitting the reference books, for instance, I find that I have no idea what the \"real history\" events are that are being altered in a story such as Elizabeth Moon's otherwise-rousing chase-and-battle-at-sea story \"Tradition,\" and I doubt that many other readers will, either. There are a few other stories that suffer from this syndrome as well. The best stories here are William Sanders's vivid \"Billy Mitchell's Overt Act\" and Lois Tilton's ingenious \"The Craft of War,\" but the book also features, yes, substantial work by Esther M. Friesner, David Weber, R. M. Meluch, Lillian Stewart Carl, S. M. Stirling, Turtledove himself, and others. At a cover price of $5.99, it's a solid reading value. Interestingly, perhaps out of a fear that there aren't that many military history buffs out there after all, the publisher has done its best with its packaging and its cover copy to make this look like one of the Resnick-style wild-and-crazy juxta-positions kind of anthologies, instead of what it actually is. The cover painting, for instance, features a Roman soldier riding in a World War II-style tank, and the back-cover copy burbles \"At Gaugemela the Macedonians had Alexander and the Persians had— Darius.... But what if the Persians had— Erwin Rommel. Or what if George S. Patton had commanded Southern forces at Bull Run, and Lincoln had become a Confederate prisoner?\"— all scenarios which, as far as I can tell, do not occur in any of the stories in the book. I'm not sure of the wisdom of trying to fool the reading public into thinking they're buying one kind of thing when actually they're getting quite a different kind of thing altogether (if Baen wanted a Resnick-style alternate history anthology, why didn't they hire Resnick to do one for them in the first place?), as though consumers who thought they were buying chocolate ice cream won't notice they're been given strawberry instead, but that's pretty much what the packaging here attempts to do. Strange. There was also an Alternate-History-of-Canada anthology this year, Arrow-Dreams: An Anthology of Alternate Canadas (Nuage Editions), edited by Mark Shainblum and John Dupuis, most of the contents of which were earnest but rather dull, although there is interesting work here by Eric Choi, Derryl\n\nMurphy, Glenn Grant, and others. (Nuage Editions, P.O. Box 206, RPO Corydon, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3M 3S7— CDN $19.95 for ArrowDreams: An Anthology of Alternate Canadas.) (We somehow missed another original anthology of Canadian fiction, Tesseracts6 [Tesseract], edited by Robert J. Sawyer and Carolyn Clink, which we'll have to save for next year.) The double issue of the Australian semiprozine Aurealis, Aurealis 20/21, also functions as an Alternate History anthology about the possible futures ahead for Australia, and is somewhat livelier and more entertaining than its Canadian counterpart, with good work by Simon Brown, Terry Dowling, Sue Isle, Russell Blackford, and others, although most of the scenarios here are not terribly likely either. An even more specialized Alternate History item is Alternate Skiffy (Wildside Press), edited by Mike Resnick and Patrick Nielsen Hayden, which I missed when it appeared late last year. As the title indicates, this anthology makes no bones about being frivolous, even unabashedly silly; in effect, it's a sequence of in-jokes about science fiction fandom and prodom, with almost no chance of being appreciated by anyone who isn't seriously involved in those worlds: fan fiction, in other words, although sometimes superior examples of same. The best stories here are David Langford's droll and satirical \"The Spear of the Sun\" (which originally appeared in Interzone, and was reprinted in Asimov's a few years back, while this anthology presumably languished on the shelf) and Frederik Pohl's sly and ingenious \"The Golden Years of Astounding,\" which makes a surprisingly plausible case for what science fiction would have been like if John W. Campbell had been fired early on and Donald Wollheim put in charge of Astounding instead (although I doubt if even the formidable Wollheim would really have been capable of talking J. R. R. Tolkien into writing his magnum opus as a space opera, The Lord of Saturn's Rings, rather than as a fantasy— it's a good joke, though, the best in the book). There's other good work here from Barry N. Malzberg, Gregory Feeley, Anthony R. Lewis, Greg Cox, and others. If you're a science fiction fan (particularly a convention-attending fan) or professional, or at least are moderately familiar with the history of the genre, you may well get a few chuckles, and even a belly laugh or two, out of this material. If you're not, I suspect that most of the stories might as well be written in Sanskrit, for all you're going to be able to get out of them. (The Wildside Press, 522 Park Avenue, Berkeley Heights, NJ 07922— $9 for Alternate Skiffy.) There was also a reprint anthology of Alternate History stories, Roads Not Taken (Del Rey), edited by Gardner Dozois and Stanley Schmidt.
