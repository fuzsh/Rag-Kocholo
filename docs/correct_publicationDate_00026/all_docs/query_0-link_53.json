        "text": "I've been racking my brain for awhile now, trying to remember a name or author for a short story I read some years ago.\n\nA man is diagnosed with Alzheimer's at an early stage, but they can't do anything about it. So he buys a desk with an AI built in, and starts telling this AI his entire life story, all the anecdotes, thoughts, everything, turning the AI into a duplicate of himself. As the man's mind deteriorates, the AI watches and tries to help. One day, the AI has the man send his wife out to get some dinner, and a drawer in the desk unlocks. The AI guides the man to lay out a tarp, take a gun, and shoot himself. After, the AI calls one of the man's friends over to help deal with the body and console the wife when she returns home. As a final act, the AI has the friend type in the commands to delete itself.\n\nIf anyone here remembers the story, and has any idea who wrote it, what it was called, where it appeared, anything, I would be most appreciative.\n\nEspecially as a first post, I apologize for the necro of a necro, but this very story has been poking around in the back of my head for awhile (a family member brought up the story not a month ago, and I just read an article about whether or not you'd want to know if Alzheimers was in your genes, and the one person in the article would not (I would, and for just the same reason as the narrator of this story in question)) but it ended up making me go down the rabbit hole of trying to 100% for sure find it.\n\nAlso, this post was one of googles top results for the phrase \"Sci fi short story of a man with alzheimers\" which is how I found the post\n\nYou were dead on, KatG, it's exactly that story. I knew for sure that it appeared in the same collection that I had that had the original novella form of Nancy Kress' \"Beggars in Spain,\" which is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Year's_Best_Science_Fiction:_Ninth_Annual_Collection and I remember distinctly that the short-story in question was around the same point in the collection as this story in question: and according to Wikipedia the very next story in the contents is Jablokov's \"Living Will.\"\n\nBoth the combination of my age at the time of reading this (somewhere in my mid to early teens) as well as just the haunting nature of it has made this story stick with me for the past 30 years. So, thanks for also reminding me of what the actual title is (which also reminds me I still have that collection, somewhere, in one of these boxes *vague gesture at plastic crates everywhere in three different rooms*)"
