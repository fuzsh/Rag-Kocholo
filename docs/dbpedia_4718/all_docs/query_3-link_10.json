        "text": "If you need English for everyday communication, there is a big chance you will want to use it in your travels. The easiest way to prepare is to learn English with films.\n\nIt takes some time to get used to the fast speech of native English speakers – so be selective: you can watch the whole film for the story but learn useful phrases and words from so-called transactional dialogues (how people book a trip, buy tickets, board the plane, go sightseeing or shopping etc.).\n\nHow you will improve your English with films\n\nincrease confidence in listening understanding;\n\nexpand vocabulary and knowledge of collocations;\n\ndevelop communication skills.\n\nYou can watch films in English (with or without English subtitles) on Amazon Prime, Netflix, or ororo.tv.\n\nSome learning tips:\n\nchoose the scene that could be useful to you (i.e. it has some phrases you could use in real life);\n\nwatch this dialogue with English subtitles one or two times;\n\npick the phrases you want to remember;\n\ncheck the unknown words or expressions in the dictionary;\n\nwatch the dialogue again concentrating on the pronunciation of the phrases you’re learning, try saying them out loud and remember their correct pronunciation;\n\nlisten to this dialogue one more time without English subtitles making sure you hear all the phrases clearly.\n\nHere are some well-known films which will help you expand your travel vocabulary and improve your communication skills:\n\nThe Terminal (2004)\n\nAccent: American\n\nGenre: comedy, drama, romance\n\nType of Travel: by plane\n\nSkills to learn: at the airport, customs, shopping, meeting people, at the taxi\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIt’s a great film but also a useful resource for English learners – you can learn everyday phrases like the hero does throughout the film.\n\nIt is a story of a man who gets stuck in a New York airport because of the revolution in his own country. He can barely speak English and, because he can’t go back home, he needs to learn the language and find his way around this strange situation.\n\nEver feel like you’re living in an airport?\n\nEat, Pray, Love (2010)\n\nAccent: American, European\n\nGenre: drama, romance\n\nTypes of Travel: by car, by plane\n\nSkills to learn: restaurant, small talk\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIf you are interested in self-development, you have probably heard of Liz Gilbert. The book which this film is based on has inspired many people around the world.\n\nYou can easily use this film for improving your English: the dialogues are great as well as Julia Roberts’s professional acting and pronunciation.\n\nSometimes to lose balance for love is part of living a balanced life.\n\nBack to the Future – Trilogy (1985, 1989, 1990)\n\nAccent: American\n\nGenre: sci-fi\n\nTypes of Travel: time travel, by car\n\nSkills to learn: packing, driving, cafes\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThis may seem like not an obvious choice for a travel film, but if you like science fiction and time travel, why not use it for learning English?\n\nThe hero travels to different times in the past and people speak a bit clearer there than in the 1980s, so the dialogues will be easier to understand for an English learner. Give it a try!\n\nRoads? Where we’re going, we don’t need roads.\n\nBefore Sunrise (1995)/ Before Sunset (2004)/ Before Midnight (2013) – Trilogy\n\nAccent: American, European\n\nGenre: drama, romance\n\nTypes of Travel: by train\n\nSkills to learn: sightseeing, on the train\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThis is the story of two young people who meet on the train somewhere in Europe and decide to get off in Vienna to spend a little life together. This ends up in a life-long romance.\n\nIt is a beautiful story which will be not too hard to understand if you are still learning English. If you like love stories, of course…\n\nI wish I’d meet you earlier. I really like talking to you.\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)\n\nAccent: British, American, European\n\nGenre: adventure, comedy\n\nTypes of Travel: by car, by train\n\nSkills to learn: at the hotel\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nA quirky dark comedy for those who love non-mainstream films. Some dialogues may seem a bit difficult, but the pace, on the whole, is not too fast and easy to adapt too.\n\nDid he just throw my cat out of the window?\n\nGreen Book (2018)\n\nAccent: American\n\nGenre: biography, comedy, drama, music\n\nTypes of Travel: by car\n\nSkills to learn: at the hotel, at the restaurant, cultural events\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nRoad trips are great for dialogues and non-speedy story telling. This one – about an unlikely friendship of two men travelling together to the American south in the 1960s – is inspiring and heart-warming. If you like clever films and want to see one in English.\n\nThe world’s full of lonely people afraid to make the first move.\n\nThe Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011)\n\nAccent: British, Indian\n\nGenre: comedy, drama, romance\n\nTypes of Travel: by plane, by car, by motorcycle\n\nSkills to learn: booking, at the hotel, small talk\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nI didn’t expect anything special when I saw the title of this film. But there are so many things to like in it: from a personality-rich cast including so many classy British actors and actresses (meaning PERFECT British accent!) to elegant humour and warmth of the story.\n\nThis film is not so hard to understand – the heroes do not speak fast and they communicate with foreigners a lot. It also has a lot of useful phrases for everyday life and travels. And it’s fun to watch!\n\nEverything will be all right in the end… if it’s not all right then it’s not yet the end.\n\nUp in the Air (2009)\n\nAccent: American\n\nGenre: drama, romance\n\nTypes of Travel: by plane\n\nSkills to learn: packing, at the airport, business travel\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nTotally recommended for those who are learning English for work and business. You will learn a lot of set expressions and useful vocabulary. Need to improve your small talk skills? This is a great resource for you!\n\nLast year I spent 322 days on the road, which means I had to spend 43 miserable days at home.\n\nFrench Kiss (1995)\n\nAccent: American, European\n\nGenre: comedy, drama, romance\n\nTypes of Travel: by plane, by train, by car\n\nSkills to learn: on the plane, on the train, sightseeing, at the restaurant\n\nBuy DVD on Amazon\n\nOne of my most favourite movies of all times. A funny yet charming story about a girl who goes to France from Canada to get her fiance back and falls in love with somebody else, in the end. Brilliant humour, cultural diversity in action, adventures and romance – this film will make you smile!\n\nAlso, it is great for learning English – the dialogues are not too hard and there is a lot of communication with non-native speakers. Good for us, right?\n\nDo you believe in love? The kind that lasts forever?\n\nMurder on the Orient Express (1974)\n\nAccent: British, European\n\nGenre: crime, drama, mystery\n\nTypes of Travel: by train\n\nSkills to learn: on the train, at the restaurant, small talk\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nDo you like classic detective stories? If the answer is yes, this film is a real treasure for you. Based on a famous Agatha Christie’s novel, it tells a story of an unusual murder on the famous Orient Express train. But for us, there is even more.\n\nAgain, we see outstanding British actors and actresses speaking ‘perfect’ English, but not just that. The cast is an international crowd – which is extremely useful for practising listening. Most of the dialogues are a linguistic masterpiece!\n\nBy the way, as much as I love this film, I totally hated the 2017 re-make. The actors are amazing, but the dialogues and the interpretation are not that great. So, I recommend the classic version.\n\nThe murderer is with us now!\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine (2006)\n\nAccent: American\n\nGenre: comedy, drama\n\nTypes of Travel: road trip, car travel\n\nSkills to learn: planning a trip, on the road, at the restaurant\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nI can’t say for sure if it’s a ‘travel’ movie or not – for me, it’s a story about dreams, establishing self-identity, looking for your place in life and so much more. A family goes on a trip across the United States to a beauty pageant their little daughter wants to be a part of. Will she win? No. But they will learn a little bit more about themselves and each other on this trip. This is a clever, non-mainstream piece of work.\n\nIf you are interested in improving your understanding of American English – give it a try. It’s quite fast and not too easy, but my students usually love it.\n\nOh my God, I’m getting pulled over. Everyone, just… pretend to be normal.\n\nInterstate 60\n\nAccent: American, British\n\nGenre: adventure, comedy, drama\n\nTypes of Travel: by car\n\nSkills to learn: small talk\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThis film is not as classy as so others on this list, but I couldn’t leave out this witty comedy in the popular ‘road trip’ genre. Only try it if you are Upper-Intermediate level or higher – it has a lot of American slang and black humour (which is not always easy to catch if you are still learning English).\n\nA young guy gets lost and finds himself on a non-existent Interstate 60 in search of ‘an answer and his dream girl’. He gets some help from a mysterious stranger played by hilarious Gary Oldman. You will hear both British and American accents and, hopefully, will learn a lot of new vocabulary.\n\nI’m just a guy that likes to mess with people’s heads.\n\nOther films to watch\n\nOther good movies telling about different types of travels are Elizabethtown, The Bucket List, Catch me if you can, Around the world in 80 days, or Eurotrip. They could be a bit more difficult to understand (faster speech, more complex dialogues) but they all are totally worth some learning!\n\nI hope you have found something interesting on this list. Learning English with films is an easy and practical way to improve your listening skills and vocabulary. Travel movies are particularly useful because they help you learn about the culture and teach you real-life communication skills.\n\nDo you learn English using films and TV shows?
