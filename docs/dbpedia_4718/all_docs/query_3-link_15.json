        "text": "In an ever-globalising movie world, the Cannes film festival is cinema’s equivalent of a national park: a sanctuary for the endangered breed of foreign cinema, fortified against the omnivorous depredations of Hollywood. That’s the theory, anyway. But looking at this year’s official selection, an Anglophone virus appears to be on the rampage. Of the 20 films in competition at Cannes, only three are made by native English-speakers: Gus van Sant and Todd Haynes from the US, and Australia’s Justin Kurzel. Yet more than half of them are partially or entirely in the English language. Many of them are by formerly dependable auteurs, crossing over into English for the first time, and many of them feature high-profile American and British actors.\n\nTake Greece’s Yorgos Lanthimos, purveyor of strange, unsettling, parallel-world tales such as Dogtooth and Alps. His latest work, The Lobster, looks of a piece with its predecessors, in that it’s about people being turned into animals if they fail to find a mate. Except Lanthimos filmed it in Dublin, in English, with a cast led by Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz and John C Reilly. It’s a similar story with Matteo Garrone. He won the Cannes Grand Jury prize in 2008 with his mafiosi exposé Gomorrah – as Italian a movie as you could wish for. His latest, The Tale of Tales, looks to be a twisted, grownup fairytale involving mythical beasts and the devouring of internal organs. The cast includes Salma Hayek, Vincent Cassel, Toby Jones and, again, Reilly.\n\nGarrone’s compatriot Paolo Sorrentino has also forsaken Italian. Sorrentino won the best foreign film Oscar in 2014 with The Great Beauty, a gorgeously world-weary survey of Rome infused with the spirit of Fellini and Italian cinema’s golden age. By contrast, his latest, Youth, is led by Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel and was partly filmed in London. It goes on. Norway’s Joachim Trier, Mexico’s Michel Franco and even France’s Guillaume Nicloux are all in Cannes competition this year with English-language films set in the US.\n\n“Each year we refuse an incalculable number of movies made in foreign countries in English,” Cannes director Thierry Frémaux revealingly told the press when questioned about this year’s selection. “Sorrentino and Garrone don’t do that to please the Anglo-Saxon market. They have their stories to tell.” In other words, it could be even worse if Cannes really opened the floodgates.\n\nThis is nothing new, of course. English is less the native tongue of cinema than its universal second language. Hollywood history was largely written by European emigres: FW Murnau, Ernst Lubitsch, Fritz Lang, Billy Wilder, William Wyler, Frank Capra – the list goes on. But when film-makers from France and Italy start to make movies in English, you begin to worry.\n\nIn most developed countries, national cinema is supported by the state, a mark of its importance in preserving indigenous culture and language. If those film-makers, nurtured by public funds, start jumping ship into international waters at the first opportunity, something’s not working. As well as recognising and anointing the world’s foremost film-makers, could it be that Cannes and other festivals also position these auteurs for creaming off by Anglophone cinema? In this light, Cannes looks less of a haven for world cinema.\n\nTake Sorrentino. Youth is not the first film he has made in English. Before The Great Beauty, he made This Must Be the Place, in which Sean Penn played a slightly whiny rock star on a trans-American road trip. Like Sorrentino’s three previous films, This Must Be the Place was selected for competition at Cannes. It even won a prize, but it was probably the worst-received film of his career. It just didn’t feel like a Sorrentino film. Perhaps his foreign senses didn’t perceive how irritating and mannered Penn’s Robert Smith impersonation was. Or that the Holocaust/paternal reconciliation plot was rather mushy. Or that the David Byrne cameo felt like a fanboy tribute. Or that the whole thing could have been a good half-hour shorter.\n\nHow did This Must Be the Place come about? Via the Cannes film festival, it turns out. Penn was president of the jury that gave Il Divo its prize in 2008. Sorrentino and Penn met on the closing night and were mutually starstruck, it appears. “He [Penn] expressed some really flattering opinions of my film,” Sorrentino explained. “I found this sufficiently remarkable to entertain the fantasy of making a film with him. Unexpectedly, like a true American dream, the fantasy became a reality.”\n\nThis Must Be the Place fell into the familiar foreigner’s trap of rediscovering America – the America most filmgoers had already discovered many times before, in American films. It happened to Wong Kar-wai, whose Hong Kong cool deserted him when he made My Blueberry Nights. And Bruno Dumont, whose erotic snorefest Twentynine Palms made one long for a long tracking shot of foggy northern France. Bollywood hitmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra recently had a go, but his quasi-western Broken Horses was largely ignored on its release last month, despite lavish praise from James Cameron and Alfonso Cuarón. Cuarón, incidentally, was expelled from film school in Mexico for making a student film in English rather than Spanish. Clearly, he knew he was right.\n\nEvery time a global film-making hotspot flares up – most recently Mexico, South Korea, Denmark, Brazil – its talents are tempted away from their homelands, but it’s always been a hit-and-miss affair. Often outsiders have a better angle on our culture than we do. As an untested Taiwanese film-maker, Ang Lee seemed like a bizarre choice for Emma Thompson’s Sense and Sensibility but, as he noted at the time: “In some ways I probably know that 19th-century world better than English people today, because I grew up with one foot still in that feudal society.” Chen Kaige, on the other hand, floundered hopelessly with his laughable British erotic thriller Killing Me Softly. Fernando Meirelles struck gold after City of God with The Constant Gardener, but then went on to make clunkers such as Blindness and 360. The Danes doubtlessly have a better ear for the English language, judging by the work of Lars von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg (currently on screen with Far from the Madding Crowd) and Lone Scherfig (An Education). Then again, Scherfig had a deaf spot when it came to Anne Hathaway’s “Yorkshire” accent in One Day, which sank the entire movie.\n\nIt’s not a question of tempting foreign film-makers away, says veteran producer Jeremy Thomas, “They’re desperate to make films in English,” he says. Thomas has been behind some of the great Anglophone successes of world cinema, such as Bernardo Bertolucci’s The Last Emperor and Nagisa Oshima’s Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence. “Bernardo wanted to film in English, and continued to, because he wanted to work with the actors,” Thomas says. “The English language has very good actors in it, which a single nation doesn’t have, and stars from many of those nations are harder to get.” He’s not surprised at the high English content of this year’s Cannes: “They want to reach a larger audience. They want to say: ‘Is there anybody out there?’ And they want to hear back: ‘Yeah!’” Thomas is currently in discussion with three of the best known foreign-language film-makers in the world about making films in English, he reveals: “But I’m not going to tell you who.”\n\nAs it happens, Thomas had a hand in one of this year’s Cannes surprises: he co-produced Garrone’s The Tale Of Tales. In what he confesses is his first ever English interview, Garrone explains that his film is based on the stories of Giambattista Basile, the earliest known collector of European fairytales. “Basile is practically unknown by the world. So I thought to make the movie in English could help to reach the largest possible audience. We shouldn’t forget, in Italy we already read the tales of Basile in translation, because he wrote in 17th-century Neapolitan dialect. But also, something about Basile is Shakespearean in a way, so I thought it could be made in English without losing anything.”\n\nHe had an on-set interpreter to make sure the dialogue was “in tune”, he says, but otherwise, it felt no different. “I was afraid at the beginning I wouldn’t be able to hear if they were going out of tune or not, but in the end I don’t think it was a problem. The actors helped me a lot.”\n\nGarrone doesn’t feel he is betraying Italian cinema. After the international success of Gomorrah, he received countless, potentially lucrative offers to make similar movies in the US, he says. He turned them all down. This time, he’s bringing foreign actors to Italy, rather than deserting his own culture. “The most important thing is the quality of the movie,” says Garrone. “If you make a movie in Italian, it can sell in every part of the world, like Gomorrah did. You can make a movie in English but if it’s no good, you won’t make 20 bucks.”\n\nIf Garrone and Sorrentino are betraying Italian cinema in any way, they’re in good company, looking back at compatriots such as Bertolucci, or Michaelangelo Antonioni, whose outsider’s eye gave us two of the greatest films about 1960s London and America, in Blow-Up and Zabriskie Point. Or what about Sergio Leone? Rather than deserting Italian cinema, Leone reinvented American cinema, and spawned a very productive spaghetti western industry at home.\n\nThe audience for foreign-language films has been in decline since the 1960s. Whereas the likes of Antonioni or Godard or Truffaut found audiences and respect in their own language (give or take the odd foray into English language for curiosity’s sake), now they make up 5% of UK box office in a good year. But despite the perceived threat of Hollywood, national cinema is actually on the rise in most countries. In other words, non-English countries are watching more of their own movies than they used to. Local industries are recovering and the box-office share of home-produced cinema is increasing.\n\nThe national cinema that’s really threatened by these developments, Thomas points out, is Britain’s. We’ve got the opposite problem, he says: English-language film is overpopulated. “The US, Australia, South Africa and all the other English-speaking places, plus all the other foreign directors we’ve been talking about, they all want to make films in English so we’ve got gigantic competition.” The point is underlined by the absence of British films in competition at Cannes this year. For the time being, our own industry punches well above its weight in terms of production and acting talent and scale of industry activity, thankfully. There’s a British element to almost all the English-language films at Cannes this year: The Tale of Tales, Sorrentino’s Youth, Lanthimos’s The Lobster, Justin Kurzel’s Macbeth, Todd Haynes’s Carol. If any of them wins a prize, can we hail it as a victory for British film? It’s a sign that the nationality of films is increasingly difficult to isolate, and therefore could possibly be redundant. If so, we’ve got Cannes to thank."
