        "text": "Looking for a comprehensive list of film techniques and a breakdown of how they create meaning? Well, this is it. In this searchable guide, you’ll find all the important film techniques you need to discuss in your essays.\n\nAll about the Ultimate Film Techniques List\n\nFilms take us on journeys; we become immersed in worlds beyond our own. The best films lead us to ask questions about our world as well as ourselves. However, sometimes it can be difficult to translate our reactions to film into meaningful English analysis.\n\nWe’ve put this list together to help you make sense of these choices and analyse films more effectively.\n\nWhen filmmakers construct their films, they combine multiple techniques together to develop meaning. Film combines visual elements with auditory elements to develop meaning. To understand how the various techniques combine to create meaning, watch the following video we have put together that lists the techniques employed in various film scenes.\n\nFilm Techniques Toolkit from Matrix Education on Vimeo\n\nThe list below provides some of the key film techniques for writing about cinematic texts.\n\nUltimate Film Techniques List\n\nGo to technique:\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nThere are a huge number of techniques that are used in films to convey meaning. Below are some of the must-know techniques that are included in the glossaries of Matrix English Theory Books.\n\n1. Angles\n\nCamera angles refer to the tilt of the camera in relation to the scene and the characters. Unusual camera angles can emphasise an action sequence, disorientate the audience, and suggest the relationship between characters.\n\nThe main angles are:\n\nLow – Establishes the power of the character or object\n\nEye-Level – Allows the audience to get personal with the character(s)\n\nHigh – Presents the subject as vulnerable or lacking in power\n\nWorm’s Eye – Presents the figure as very large and/or powerful\n\nCanted (also known as a Dutch Angle)- Develops psychological unease or tension.\n\nBird’s Eye – Often used to establish a shot and characters’ relationship to it\n\n2. Bridging Shot\n\nA shot that marks the passage of time in a film. This is sometimes a series of newspaper headlines, a calendar, tress going through seasonal changes, or the hands turning on a clock.\n\nThis bridging shot marks the passing of evening. Note the fast turning of the clock hands and rapid melting of the candle.\n\n3. Colour\n\nColour, especially the choice of colour palette or scheme, can reflect the mood of the piece. Colour in a scene can also be enhanced through lighting.\n\nFor example, in The Great Gatsby (2013), the use of a vibrant colour scheme reflects the opulent lifestyle of New York elites in the 1920s.\n\nYou can learn more about colour symbolism at Studio Binder.\n\n4. Cucoloris\n\nCucoloris is a lighting technique where an object is placed between the light source and the subject in order to create a patterned shadow. A staple of film noir.\n\n5. Cross-Cutting\n\nCross-cutting is an editing technique where actions are established as occurring at the same time. The camera will cut away from one action to another action elsewhere to suggest these things are occurring at the same moment.\n\nCross cutting is used in Christopher Nolan’s Inception (2010) to build tension in a crucial action scene.\n\n6. Dialogue\n\nA conversation between two characters is called dialogue. Written by scriptwriters to convey the film’s plot, dialogue is also useful in conveying character.\n\n7. Dissolve\n\nA transition that moves between one shot and another by overlaying one shot and fading the first image out while strengthening the second shot. This can denote daydreams, memories, the passing of time, or signify phone conversations and long-distance communication.\n\nConsider this example from Paul Thomas Anderson’s Inherent Vice (2014):\n\nIn this dissolve, we are taken to one of Larry “Doc” Sportello’s memories that are triggered during a phone call.\n\n8. Dolly Shot\n\nA dolly is a wheeled cart that the camera and operator are seated on. A dolly shot is a shot where the dolly is pushed along to move with the action. This is similar to a tracking shot, but without the tracks so that the camera can have a broader range of motion.\n\nThe video below discusses the difference between dolly shots and zooms and how they can be used (or even combined) to create effects and meaning.\n\n9. Editing Sequence\n\nThe order of each shot and how they have been put together to create a scene. This is usually based upon the storyboard used by the director.\n\nHowever, some directors such as Werner Herzog refused to use storyboards, and shoot many scenes which they edit together by trial and error.\n\n10. Editing Wipes\n\nIn editing, wipes are used to transition between scenes in a variety of ways rather than just cutting. Types of wipes include:\n\nHorizontal wipe – the wipe moves horizontally across the screen\n\nVertical wipe – The wipe moves vertically across the screen\n\nDiagonal wipe – The wipe moves diagonally across the screen\n\nStar wipe – The wipe is the shape of an expanding star to demonstrate something special happening\n\nHeart Wipe – The wipe takes the shape of a heart expanding or contracting to illustrate romance or friendship\n\nClock Wipe – The wipe is a circular motion like a clock arm to illustrate the passage of time\n\nMatrix wipe – a patterned transition between scenes\n\nIn this scene of Mark Waters’ Mean Girls (2004), we see a horizontal wipe being used to draw emphasis to Karen’s appalled facial expression.\n\n11. Establishing Shot\n\nA type of extreme long-shot that establish the context – time and setting – of a scene or film. Often establishing shots use famous landmarks or places, like the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\n12. Eyeline Match\n\nA type of cut where the shot of a character looking at something cuts to a shot of the thing they were looking at the same level. This type of cut is used to show the audience what they were looking at.\n\nIt’s used in Stephen Daldry’s The Hours (2003) to capture Clarissa’s fearful expression as she watches Richard perched on the window sill.\n\n13. Fade In/Out\n\nAn editing technique where the shot fades out from one shot going to black before fading into a new shot.\n\nThis scene from Mark Waters’ Mean Girls (2004) fades out, as Cady processes how Regina was just hit by a bus.\n\n14. Flashback\n\nImages that refer to previous events in the characters` lives. Flashbacks can be used to foreshadow future events.\n\n15. Intertitle\n\nText which is printed on a background and placed between filmed scenes through editing. In silent films, intertitles can convey dialogue and exposition.\n\n16. Iris\n\nSimilar to other editing wipes, this is a type of transition where the screen irises closed around a particular thing on screen. These can be used to signify daydreams, provide a dramatic transition, or signify the end of a scene.\n\n17. Jump Cut\n\nA cut that moves fractionally forward in time. These shots focus on the same subject but either use a different angle or have the subject in a different position to illustrate that time has moved forward in time. Jump cuts are usually used to show time passing forward.\n\nBelow is an instance of jump cuts in Frank Oz’s Little Shop of Horrors (1987).\n\n18. Lighting\n\nLighting contributes to the mood of a film and suggests interpretations of a character. Are they good? Are they nefarious?\n\nLow key lighting emphasises the shadows in a shot, while lighting from above or below can suggest that a character possesses sinister qualities.\n\n19. Long Take\n\nAlso called a sequence shot (and occasionally referred to as a one-shot)\n\n20. Match Cut\n\nJumps from one shot to another similar shot that matches the composition of the first shot.\n\nHere’s an example of a match cut in the opening of Taylor Swift’s Style music video.\n\n21. Mise en scène\n\nMise en scène translates as ‘what is put into a scene’. This French expression refers to the composition of a scene, including placement of characters, costume, make–up and setting.\n\n22. Montage\n\nA montage is a type of editing sequence where a series of shots play rapidly to create a narrative. Often a montage will be accompanied by a unifying piece of music to convey the dominant mood connected with the sequence.\n\nAnimated GIF: A montage from Fritz Lang’s Metropolis (1927)\n\n23. Mood\n\nMood refers to the feelings suggested by the combination of all the elements on the screen and the accompanying sound. Another way to refer to the mood is to discuss atmosphere.\n\n24. Music\n\nMusic can convey the theme, mood and atmosphere. There are different types of music in films.\n\nThe score is extra-diegetic music composed for the film, designed to evoke the film’s desired mood for the audience.\n\nMusic heard by the characters in the film is called diegetic music.\n\n25. Over the Shoulder (OTS)\n\nA type of sequence shot or tracking shot where the camera follows a character by following them and shooting over their shoulder. Like a Point of View shot, an over the shoulder shot focalises (that is, focuses in on) on the characters experience.\n\nStephen Daldry’s The Hours (2003) utilises an over the shoulder shot of Virginia frustratedly speaking to Leonard.\n\n26. One-Shot\n\nAlso referred to as a Long Take or Sequence Shot. A one-shot is actually a type of long-take or sequence shot where the effect of being one shot is created through editing. For example, Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s 2014 film, Birdman uses careful editing to give the appearance of a single take.\n\nIn some cases, a one-shot is used to refer to whole films made in one take, such as the 2015 film German film, Victoria.\n\n27. Panning Shot\n\nA shot where the camera swivels horizontally around a fixed point to follow the subject.\n\nA panning shot is used in Amy Heckerling’s Clueless (1995) to show Cher chasing her father around the kitchen to give him a glass of orange juice.\n\n28. Point Of View Shot (POV)\n\nA shot that is taken from a character’s point of view, like a first-person video game. Point of View shots focalise (that is, focus in on) a character’s experience.\n\n29. Rack Shot\n\nA shot where the camera shifts the focus while holding the same shot to bring another object into focus. Rack shots change the depth of the shot.\n\nThe example below is from the TV series Sherlock. In it, the focus shifts from Sherlock to Watson.\n\nAnimated GIF: In this rack shot, the focus shifts from Sherlock in the foreground to Watson in the background.\n\n30. Scene\n\nA unit of narrative used to divide up a dramatic text or film. A scene usually takes place in a single location and focuses on a single action in one moment of varying length.\n\n31. Setting\n\nThe place where the action of the film occurs.\n\n32. Sequence Shot\n\nA sequence shot is a single long take shows a series of actions happening one after another within the same shot. Sequence shots are occasionally called long takes and one-shots. Sequence shots are very hard to do and can develop quite a lot of meaning.\n\nA famous example is Martin Scorses’s Copacabana shot from his 1990 film, Goodfellas.\n\nThis shot illustrates the Henry Hills’ wealth and connections while he shows off to his date. This take combines over the shoulder and point of view perspectives.\n\n33. Shot Type\n\nShot types indicate how close or far the camera is from the characters. Shot types range from Extreme Long Shot (XLS), where the characters may be very small and embedded in a landscape, to Extreme Close Up (XCU), where part of the character’s face makes up the whole shot.\n\nThe shots are:\n\nExtreme Long Shot (XLS)\n\nLong Shot (LS)\n\nMedium Long Shot (MLS)\n\nMedium Shot (MS)\n\nMedium Close Up (MCU)\n\nClose Up (CU)\n\nSuper Close Up (SCU)\n\nExtreme Close Up (XCU)\n\nImage: Examples of various shot types\n\n34. Sound\n\nThe sound of a film helps to create atmosphere – this can include:\n\nSound effects\n\nDialogue\n\nMusic (see above)\n\nSilences\n\nVoice-overs\n\nLike music, sound can be divided into:\n\nDiegetic: occurring in the world of the film\n\nExtra-diegetic (occurring outside the world of the film)\n\n35. Symbolism\n\nAn object used to suggest ideas in addition to, or beyond, their literal sense. For example, the glass slipper in Cinderella symbolises the opportunity that Cinderella has to live a different life. Watch films carefully to spot symbols and their potential meaning to the plot. If a symbol recurs throughout the film it is a motif.\n\nAnimated GIF: This GIF is from Sam Mendes’ American Beauty (1999). The dancing plastic bag symbolises how beauty is found in things that are often discarded. The bag is rubbish to many, but its dance in the wind is beautiful.\n\n36. Steady Cam\n\nA type of camera that is used in action sequences. A steady cam rig allows the camera to be worn by the operator so they can follow an action sequence without the shot become overly jerky.\n\nThis video shows examples of shots taken with the steady cam, explained from the perspective of a steady cam operator.\n\n37. Transitions\n\nA way to transition between shots. Transitions involve cuts, fades, and wipes (see above for specific definitions).\n\nThis is a good video that explains these various techniques.\n\n38. Tilt\n\nWhen the camera tilts in shot to show the subject away from the horizontal axis.\n\nExample: A tilt shot of Captain America\n\n39. Title Card\n\nSee intertitle\n\n40. Tracking Shot\n\nA shot that follows a subject as they move.\n\nIn Jane Campion’s Bright Star (2009), a tracking shot of Brawne is used to capture her grieving reaction to Keats’ death.\n\n41. Two Shot\n\nA shot that features two characters and is used to establish or develop their relationship.\n\n42. Zoom\n\nThe camera zooms in or out to focus on an object or to show how far away it is. Zooms can be used for dramatic effect or can be used to show objects in relation to each other for scale.\n\nSee Dolly Shot above for a video discussing the difference between Zooms and Dolly shots.\n\nThanks for reading the Ultimate Film Techniques List\n\nWe hope you found this ultimate film techniques list useful. Don’t forget to check the individual articles to broaden your knowledge of film like Matrix students do."
