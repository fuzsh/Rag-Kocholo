        "text": "The Best Movies of 2019\n\nEvery year a symphony of cinematic stories unfolds on the big screen, showcasing the creative prowess of filmmakers who continue to redefine the art of storytelling. The belief in cinema as a potent medium is as strong as ever, despite the evolution of how we access these stories. Here are the best films from 2019, alongside several commendable, honorable mentions, each showcasing the diverse potential of the medium at its finest.\n\nParasite\n\nParasite is a skillful black comedy thriller by Korean director Bong Joon Ho. The film uncovers the resentments festering between the haves and the have-nots as an impoverished family schemes their way into an upper-class household. Remarkably, both the schemers and the schemed against elicit sympathy, underscoring the universal complexities of human behavior.\n\nPain & Glory\n\nPain & Glory by Pedro Almódovar's most emotive and vibrant film to date. Antonio Banderas delivers a stellar performance as Salvador Mallo, a filmmaker wrestling with physical pain and existential dread. The narrative's powerful interweaving of past and present creates a visually stunning exploration of memory, creativity, and endurance.\n\nMarriage Story\n\nIn Marriage Story, director Noah Baumbach presents a heart-wrenching narrative of a couple (Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) navigating a tumultuous divorce. The film explores the dark corners of relationships, revealing how seemingly amicable situations can quickly escalate and transform into something monstrous.\n\nHustlers\n\nHustlers is an impactful narrative directed by Lorene Scafaria. The film portrays the struggle and resilience of two exotic dancers (Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez) who devise a scheme to defraud unsuspecting Wall Street tycoons following the 2008 economic crash. This spirited narrative demonstrates the lengths to which people will go when driven by necessity, revealing the stark reality faced by those hardest hit by economic collapse.\n\nKnives Out\n\nNext on our list is Knives Out, a masterfully composed whodunit from writer-director Rian Johnson. The film delves into the intrigues of a family fighting over an eccentric mystery writer's will, with a standout performance by Ana de Armas. Johnson's narrative beautifully interweaves the fun of a layered mystery with sharp social commentary, making for an engrossing viewing experience.\n\nThe Irishman\n\nMartin Scorsese's epic saga The Irishman reinvigorates the gangster genre, detailing the life of low-level mobster Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro). The film, which also stars Al Pacino as Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, evolves from an entertaining mob narrative into a reflective and melancholy examination of crime and regret.\n\nA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\n\nThis film, crafted by Marielle Heller, offers a refreshing perspective on the legacy of beloved children's TV host Fred Rogers. With Tom Hanks portraying Rogers, it tells the tale of an unexpected friendship that unfolds between Rogers and a cynical journalist (Matthew Rhys), reminding us of the value of kindness and emotional acceptance.\n\nLittle Women\n\nGreta Gerwig's vibrant adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's timeless novel, Little Women, stars Saoirse Ronan as the passionate and driven Jo March. The film successfully encapsulates the spirit of the novel, showing why Alcott's themes continue to resonate after 150 years.\n\nDolemite Is My Name\n\nThis flick recounts the real-life story of Rudy Ray Moore (Eddie Murphy), an entertainer who defied the odds to produce and star in a low-budget 1975 film featuring a flamboyant hustler named Dolemite. Dolemite Is My Name, directed by Craig Brewer, is a celebration of ambition and joy in the face of adversity.\n\nOnce Upon a Time…in Hollywood\n\nThis offering from Quentin Tarantino reimagines the tragic tale of Sharon Tate, envisioning a more joyous fate for the actor tragically slain by Manson family members in 1969. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Tate brings a spark of optimism to Tarantino's nostalgia-soaked tribute to a bygone era of Hollywood.\n\nOther Must Mentions\n\nIt's crucial to note that these are only the few mentioned standout films from a year rich in cinematic offerings. Other notable releases include Céline Sciamma's Portrait of a Lady on Fire, James Gray's Ad Astra, and Olivia Wilde's Booksmart, among others. These films, along with the ones listed above, reflect the multitude of voices, stories, and perspectives that make cinema an ever-evolving and vital medium. The year 2019, much like any other, was indeed a great year for movies.\n\n2019 Movies & Industry Highlights\n\nThe film industry experienced a profound revolution in 2019, not just in terms of record-breaking numbers and an impressive array of releases but also in the way it responded to various crises of our era.\n\nA Remarkable Year in Cinema\n\n2019 was lauded as a year of \"apocalyptic cinema of the highest order\" by renowned critic Richard Brody of The New Yorker. According to Brody, three of our finest filmmakers responded to significant crises, including threats to American democracy, global warming, and ethnic prejudices, with great ambition and creativity. However, the disparities between wide releases and limited releases were more pronounced than ever before, leading to fundamental questions about the accessibility and recognition of cinema.\n\nBox Office Titans of 2019\n\nThe top-ten highest-grossing films of 2019 were noteworthy, both for their cinematic merit and their significant financial achievements. The superhero epic, \"Avengers: Endgame,\" distributed by Disney, grossed an unprecedented $2,799,439,100, making it not only the highest-grossing film of 2019 but also the highest-grossing film of all time. Other films such as \"The Lion King,\" \"Frozen II,\" \"Spider-Man: Far From Home,\" \"Captain Marvel,\" \"Joker,\" \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,\" \"Toy Story 4\", and \"Aladdin\" all crossed the $1 billion mark. The year 2019 was especially noteworthy for \"Joker,\" which, by grossing over $1 billion, became the first R-rated film in history to achieve this feat.\n\nBox Office Records of 2019\n\nSeveral franchises and films achieved impressive box office records in 2019. The Marvel Cinematic Universe became the first film franchise to gross over $22 billion, thanks to the releases of \"Captain Marvel,\" \"Avengers: Endgame,\" and \"Spider-Man: Far From Home.\" The Star Wars franchise also crossed the $10 billion mark with the release of \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.\"\n\nNotably, China set a new global one-month record in February 2019, grossing ¥11.09 billion RMB ($1.63 billion) as a result of the Chinese New Year season.\n\nStudio Achievements\n\nThe year also saw major milestones for various film studios. Walt Disney Studios became the first ever to surpass $10 billion in worldwide box office grosses in a single year. Sony Pictures saw \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" become its highest-grossing film. Pixar, with \"Toy Story 4\", became the first animation studio to have four animated films, each surpassing $1 billion at the worldwide box office.\n\nFilm Records and Events\n\nSeveral films set records in 2019. For instance, \"Avengers: Endgame\" became the highest-grossing film of all time. \"Aladdin\" became the highest-grossing release of all time in the Middle East and the highest-grossing Disney film ever in South Korea (excluding Marvel Cinematic Universe films). \"Joker\" became the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time.\n\nApart from records, notable events marked the industry as well. March saw the Walt Disney Company completing its acquisition of 21st Century Fox's assets. In April, \"Avengers: Endgame\" was released worldwide, breaking multiple box office records."
