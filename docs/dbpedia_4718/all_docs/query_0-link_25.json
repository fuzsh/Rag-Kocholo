After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.\n\n==============================\n\nTwo reviewers have commented on the text and found it almost ready for publication.\n\nPlease make sure to follow their suggestions.\n\nIn addition although I also find the text generally satisfactory, it could need a careful edit to remove excess words and improve language, and I suggest that a proper proof is performed before resubmission of the manuscript.\n\nThe legends are extremly short and more information about how to read graphs and tables is needed. Kindly go through each legend and add text so that each figure becomes self explanatory in the final paper.\n\nAnd on a minor note, I suggest you move the legends and place them together at the manuscript; that will provide a better overview of the manuscript text and its flow.\n\nI find that alll the figures have quite low resolution, and the font size appears far to small. This should be taken care of in the updated version of the manuscript.\n\n==============================\n\nPlease submit your revised manuscript by Oct 13 2023 11:59PM.

The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository.

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)\n\nReviewer #1: Traditionally, aspen has received undeservedly little attention in both forestry and nature conservation. This paper fills this knowledge gap and demonstrates the importance of aspen for sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation. The paper is based on accurate and extensive quantitative research. The authors used modern methods of data analysis appropriate to the task. The reliability of the conclusions is therefore beyond doubt. The paper makes a significant contribution to forest ecology and will be of interest to a wide range of readers with an interest in sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation.\n\nIn my opinion, this paper is of a high scientific standard and is fully appropriate for PLOS ONE. I have no serious comments on the substance of the study, the presentation of the results and their visualisation.\n\nReviewer #2: Authors analysis the measured data and describe the ecological characteristics and geographical distribution of Eurasian aspen in the Czech Republic, as well as reveals the reasons for its low prevalence in Central Europe and elucidates the importance of the species in forest restoration. The manuscript has fluent language, reasonable structure, and a solid data foundation, which is a very interesting paper. I have just some minor suggestion:\n\n(1) Many paragraphs in the results section. It is recommended to classifiy them and write under subtitles.\n\n(2) What does the value in Figure 2 and Figure 3 mean? please explain them.\n\n(3) It is recommended to retain 2-3 decimal places for the F and P values in the title of Figure 5.\n\n**********\n\n6.

I have no further comments.\n\nReviewer #2: Thank you to the authors for their interesting manuscript. It seems that there are several areas that need improvement. Here are some suggestions:\n\nAbstract: The abstract should be concise and clearly state the purpose, significance, methods, results, and conclusions of the study. The abstract is still a bit long in the current version.\n\nIntroduction: The objectives in the introduction section should be clearly defined. It would be helpful to separate the objectives into distinct sections with clear boundaries and clear meanings. The current version is hard to understand.\n\nMethods: The methods section is currently lengthy and lacks hierarchy. It would be beneficial to divide this section into more subsections to clearly separate and describe the different content. Each subsection should have a clear objective that aligns with the research purpose.\n\nResults: The subheadings in the results section should be more aligned with the research objectives stated in the introduction. Currently, it is difficult to see a correlation between the subheadings and the objectives. Additionally, the results should be presented in a way that clearly explains the significance and contribution of the findings. This will help readers understand the true importance of the numbers, analysis results, and charts.\n\nDiscussion: The subheadings in the discussion section should also be clearer. There should be less overlap and repetition within the sections. The discussion should focus on outlining the key findings, explaining their biological or ecological mechanisms, speculating on possible reasons, and addressing the study's limitations and future research directions.\n\nThe language of the manuscript is still a bit difficult for me, who is not a native English speaker. These suggestions are only personal in nature and do not negate the value of the manuscript. I hope these suggestions help improve the clarity and structure of the manuscript.\n\n**********\n\n7.
