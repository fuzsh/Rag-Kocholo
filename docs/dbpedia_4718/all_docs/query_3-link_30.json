        "text": "New York, April 23, 2024 – This summer, cinephiles won’t need to go further than their local park to experience the excitement and drama of sports with a French flair, thanks to Films on the Green, Villa Albertine’s free outdoor French film festival. This year’s selection of films is curated around the theme ‘Sports in Film,’ and kicks off Friday, May 31, with a screening of Gilles Lellouche’s Sink or Swim in Central Park.\n\nRunning through Friday September 6, Films on the Green will show 11 English-subtitled features in eight Manhattan and Brooklyn parks. Screenings begin at sundown.\n\n“This summer, sports will be a source of international connection, where different cultures come together to celebrate human achievement. We hope that Films on the Green will help spark a similar energy in our local communities and bring people together around a shared love of cinema, cultural exchange, and the outdoors” said Mohamed Bouabdallah, Cultural Counselor of France in the United States and Director of Villa Albertine.\n\nAudiences will experience contemporary gems, beloved classics, and a variety of genres and directorial voices. From intimate portraits of real-life legends—Jacques Cousteau, Salif Keïta Traoré, Marinette Pichon—to thrilling stories of kidnap, romance, and stardom, and even a US premiere (Les Cinq Tulipes Rouges) the lineup proves that sports films, a stereotypically American genre, are very much alive and thriving in French cinema. Find the full schedule below, and read more about each film, including the cast and partners, here.\n\nFilms on the Green started over 15 years ago as a small film series in local New York City community gardens. Since then, it has blossomed into a beloved summer tradition, hotly anticipated by film buffs and casual viewers alike. This summer the festival will take place in five American cities, a new record and a testament to the ongoing enthusiasm for diverse and accessible outdoor film experiences.\n\nVilla Albertine and Albertine Foundation would like to thank Films on the Green’s 2024 official sponsors: BNP Paribas, JCDecaux, The Louis Roederer Foundation, and TV5MONDE.\n\nExplore the full program at villa-albertine.org/events/filmsonthegreen2024. #FilmsOnTheGreen\n\nFILMS ON THE GREEN 2024 LINEUP\n\nMay 31 – Central Park: Sink or Swim by Gilles Lellouche\n\nJune 7 – Washington Square Park: Final Set by Quentin Reynaud\n\nJune 14 – Washington Square Park: The Odyssey by Jérôme Salle\n\nJune 21 – Transmitter Park, Brooklyn: My Donkey, My Lover & I by Caroline Vignal\n\nJune 28 – J.
