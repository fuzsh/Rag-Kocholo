        "text": "Apollo is the home of blockbusters, and is also one of the few places in the cinema where you can catch films in 3D. They occasionally show the films in their original version (most of the time with subtitles) so this is a good option if you’re looking to catch a English-language film in 3D. Just be sure to check the program for the OV stamp, which will mean you’re good to go!\n\nFun fact: the Apollo cinema hosts 2.160 seats, which makes it one of the biggest cinemas in Austria\n\nShowtimes: see here\n\nThe Top Kino is not only a cinema, but also a good-looking and funky bar. It’s also one of our favourite indie cinemas in the city. This combination makes it a great location to spend your whole night – pre-movie drinks, film, after-movie drinks. Mostly screening European movies and documentaries in their original versions with subtitles, it also hosts the annual human rights film festival, This Human World, at the end of November (most films that are included in this festival are in English, or screened with English subtitles).\n\nFun fact: every Sunday at 8:15pm, you can watch the German crime series “Tatort” at the Top Kino (and the Schikaneder), for free!\n\nShowtimes: see, here.\n\nThe Artis International is a beloved classic amongst locals who like their films in English. As part of the Cineplexx company, it mainly shows the people-pleasing Hollywood blockbusters, or kids’ films. It is an intimate and and cosy cinema, with smaller screens. Located in the heart of the first district, it’s the ideal alternative if you’re looking to pull off a dinner and movie combo night. Artis exclusively shows films in English, without subtitles.\n\nGood to know: the candy bar serves up both fresh salty and sweet popcorn there!\n\nShowtimes: see, here\n\nThis one is known and quoted as THE English-language film cinema amongst most internationals in the city. The English Cinema Haydn has been showing exclusively English versions (without subtitles) since 1995. On Haydn’s big screen are mostly Hollywood blockbusters, but they also screen on occassions older classics and live performances of operas, theatres, and ballets out of the UK. The candy bar is well stocked and there’s fresh salty popcorn to complete the whole experience. Their screens are not big, but they’re not small either – they’re juuuust right.\n\nFun fact: this is one of the oldest family-run cinemas in Vienna, and used to be a theatre (and was used as an air-raid shelter during WW2) before it was reborn as a cinema\n\nGood to know: your voice counts! On their website you can vote for which film they should screen in the next two weeks. Cool, right?\n\nShowtimes: see here\n\nWe adore this cinema and it’s old-school charm. Entering the Filmcasino, you’re thrown back into the 50s or 60s. The entire interior, from the facade of the ticket counter and bar, to the lighting and the furniture – everything is a big throwback to the good old movie theatres we’ve never been to, but know from the movies. Filmcasino takes care of the film buffs craving art-house, indie, or international cinema that is hard-to-find in other cinemas in Vienna. European and Asian documentaries, short films, and independent productions are all common in the programme, in their original versions and mostly with subtitles (with most international films screened with English subtitles). It’s also where the Latin American film festival is hosted every year.\n\nFun fact: twice a year the Filmcasino hosts the /Slash film-festival, which celebrates international B-grade horror movies, or fantastic films. Perfect for all the lovers of gore, or quirky cinema that stretches the imagination!\n\nShowtimes: see, here.\n\nRun by the same crowd as those that run the Top Kino, this is another little indie cinema setup that is integral to Vienna’s film scene. All sorts are screened here. The run-down Beisl (Austrian for bar) attached to it is full of the kind of people that frequent the films shown here – students, creatives, individuals sharing heated discussions about the latest social trend or quirk, or the current political issue. Don’t expect a huge cinema, yet rather a small, grungy, living room affair. Actually, Schikaneder is more like your local Beisl, with a movie hall attached to it. Fitting to the interior and the whole atmosphere, you won’t find any blockbusters up on the screen here, but instead, indie cinema is shown here, usually in its original version, or with subtitles. It also screens many of the films from the human rights film festival, This Human World.\n\nGood to know: you can easily rent the Schikaneder to premiere your own movie masterpiece.\n\nShowtimes: see here\n\nBoth Votivkino & Cinema De France are run by the same crowd, and both favour European movies in their programs, while they’re known for showing alternative films that are popular amongst the people that like films that make them think. The Votivkino screens the original versions of the films religiously, with German subtitles, while De France screens the original version, but sometimes without German subtitles. Both cinemas have a unique indie cinema feeling to them, and are rather small.\n\nGood to know: the Votivkino hosts a “Sunday movie breakfast“ where you can enjoy a breakfast and watch a movie afterwards\n\nShowtimes: see, here\n\nThe Gartenbaukino is an institution amid Vienna”s cinema scene. It’s retro foyer possesses it’s own aura (which is why it’s often rented out as a party venue) and its got one of the biggest screens, and seating capacities in the city. If a showing film is showing at the Gartenbaukino, than it’s a big deal, or it’s part of some special screening series that the passionate people behind it are running. It was founded in 1960 and only has one cinema hall, so the screenings are limited, but they are mostly damn good films showing. It’s also the headquarters for the Viennale Film Festival that is held every year in Vienna. Another popular annual fixed event in the calendar is when they screen the Oscars live on the big screen.\n\nFun fact: people don’t only go there to watch movies, but other events such as hip flea markets draw people to the Gartenbaukino. So watch out for all the other fun events happening there!\n\nShowtimes: see, here\n\nFounded in 1912, the Burg Kino is one of the oldest cinemas in Europe. In the 50s, it was the only cinema in Austria screening movies in their original language. Today, you can catch a great variety of genres on the screen, from blockbusters to documentaries, and classics in their original version (some with German subtitles). The vintage flair and the great atmosphere inside the foyer, and the comfy red velvet seats are what we especially love about this cinema. You’ll even notice how old this cinema is before even walking through the doors! (check out the old signs above the entrance doors!)\n\nFun fact: part of the regular program showing at Burg Kino is the legend of a classic film, The Third Man, which was famously shot in Vienna. It’s screened about three times per week.\n\nThe film-loving crowd from the beautiful Filmcasino cinema opened this funky new home of arthouse cinema at the end of 2017, and it’s become a favourite amongst junkies of the big screen ever since. Much of the program here, you won’t find in the mainstream cinemas, as that’s what it’s all about at the Filmhaus – showing indie and less-known arthouse cinema films beyond the blockbusters. You’ll often even spot Anime films in its diverse program.
