        "text": "Looking for the best cinemas in Paris? Going to the cinema in Paris is always an experience. Now that it gets dark a little earlier in the evenings in Paris, nothing is as cozy as watching a good film in the cinema. With its 88 cinemas and 420 screens, Paris is a movie buff’s paradise. Parisians are also true cinema buffs. A box of popcorn, a bottle of cola and great company, that’s all you need to make it a fun movie night in the movie theatre in Paris.\n\nThere are many different cinemas in Paris, each with its own atmosphere and style. From the large, commercial cinemas to the smaller, more independent theatres, there is something for everyone. Many just released English and American movies in Paris are in English with French subtitles. Look out for the movie program ‘V.O.’ what means original language (version originale). Let’s ignore the commercial movie theaters for a while, because there are gems among the alternative cinemas in Paris that take you back in time. Here are a number of movie theaters in Paris (sometimes also in English language) that you must visit.\n\n• Fun to do: Tickets Paris Hop On Hop Off Bus + Cruise on the Seine (1h) →\n\n2. Studio 28: perhaps the most beautiful cinema (18th)\n\nIn the heart of Montmartre, we find one of the most beautiful cinemas in Paris: Studio 28. The cinema of Amélie Poulain! It is here that Amélie likes to go to the cinema on Friday evenings. This cinema offers the public the best feature films (also in English) from every era with a nice bar and small garden. If we had to remember just one movie theater in Paris, it would be Studio 28. “The cinema of masterpieces. The masterpiece of cinemas,” said Jean Cocteau, godfather and director Abel Gance.\n\n10 Rue Tholozé, 75018 Paris | Cinema-studio28.fr →\n\n4. Le Champo: a movie theatre gem in the Latin Quarter (5th)\n\nMovie theatre Le Champo in Paris is located in the Latin Quarter and a gem. In the two rooms, under a starry ceiling or under blue projectors, you can enjoy the greatest classics of French and foreign cinema. With a varied film offer that can appeal to both young and old and at very democratic prices. In 1999, the owner of cinema Le Champo wanted to sell the building through renovation projects. But thanks to the support of many film fans and film professionals, the building was fortunately saved.\n\n51 Rue des Écoles, 75005 Paris | Cinema-lechampo.com →"
