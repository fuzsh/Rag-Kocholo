        "text": "When watching a TV series, have you ever thought about how the dialogue is translated into another language? Dubbing and subtitling are probably the first things that immediately come to mind. There's good reason, as watching dubbed or subtitled films is the norm in many countries. Yet these are just two approaches that make up the incredibly vast field of audiovisual translation.\n\nMore videos are being produced than ever before. As such, there is increasing demand for audiovisual translation to keep up with this rapid growth in content. But what components make up this specialised branch of translation? And what future developments lie ahead for translated audiovisual content?\n\nOur comprehensive audiovisual translation guide provides the inside line on everything you need to know...\n\nFirst of all, what is audiovisual content?\n\nAudiovisual works and products are all around us. These include:\n\nfilms\n\ntelevision shows\n\nmarketing videos\n\neLearning content\n\nplays\n\nadvertisements\n\nwebsites\n\nmobile communications\n\nvideo games\n\nWhy is audiovisual content so important?\n\nStudies show that people respond much better to audio and video than text.\n\nThe human brain processes images six to 600 times faster than text, while 90% of information transmitted to the brain is visual.\n\nAudiovisual content primarily concerns video, which has experienced a boom in the past decade, especially online.\n\nBy 2022, 82% of internet traffic will be video content. Looking at YouTube alone, 30,000 hours of footage are uploaded onto the platform every hour.\n\nWith more video content comes the need for more audiovisual translation.\n\nWhat is audiovisual translation?\n\nAudiovisual translation is the process of transferring verbal components of audio or video footage from one language into an other.\n\nIt is also known as multimedia translation.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, audiovisual translation is interlingual, involving a source and target language. This means translating content from one language into another.\n\nAn example of intralingual translation, i.e. translating content within one language, would be rewriting complex text or speech in plain language.\n\nWhat methods are there for translating audiovisual works and products?\n\nDubbing and subtitling have previously been mentioned, but there is more to audiovisual translation than meets the eye.\n\nApproaches to audiovisual translation vary according to the type of content. These are known as the modes of translation.\n\nWhat are the modes of audiovisual translation?\n\nDubbing\n\nDubbing is a popular option for translating films in a number of European countries (see figure below).\n\nThe process involves adding a new voice track to a production in another language.\n\nDubbing requires a dialogue writer to make sure the translation sounds natural in the target language. Voice artists then read out the new script.\n\nDuring recording, the dialogue writer is on hand to check whether the translation is matching the on-screen actors' lip movements.\n\nFinally, the dubbing track needs to be mixed with the original soundtrack and mastered.\n\nThe dubbing process is expensive, which is why it is largely limited to feature film production.\n\nSubtitles\n\nAnother widely used mode of audiovisual translation is subtitling.\n\nSubtitling shows a target language version of the original dialogue at the bottom of the screen. Written text in the production (such as newspaper headlines) is also translated and shown in the subtitles.\n\nSubtitling allows the audience to hear the original dialogue. If the audience has some knowledge of the source language though, there can sometimes be frustration at the subtitle translator's interpretation of the original dialogue.\n\nSubtitles can also be created automatically using speech-to-text technology.\n\nSurtitles\n\nThis technique is commonly used for translating and transcribing lyrics or dialogue from opera and theatre productions.\n\nSurtitles are typically projected above the stage during the performance. If audience members are unfamiliar with the language or have hearing impairments, surtitles may help them follow the show more easily.\n\nSubtitles for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (SDH)\n\nSDH is for people who have trouble following the dialogue in a film or TV show.\n\nThis type of subtitling helps the viewers \"see\" the sounds by providing additional information.\n\nThis includes:\n\nSound effects: ringing phones, animal noises, weather, etc.\n\nSpeaker identification: symbols or names identifying speakers\n\nMusic: lyrics, mood, and musical identifiers for the soundtrack\n\nVoice over\n\nVoice over involves broadcasting the original soundtrack and the translation simultaneously.\n\nAt the start of the production, only the original soundtrack can be heard. When the dialogue begins, the volume of the original is then lowered so the audience can hear the translation.\n\nThis mode of audiovisual translation creates a realistic effect, making it a popular choice for documentaries, news, and interviews.\n\nIn addition, voice over is a considerably less expensive alternative to dubbing and subtitling.\n\nOverlaid voices\n\nWith overlaid voices, the viewer can hear a small snippet of the speaker talking in the original language before and after the translation comes in.\n\nWhen the narrator providing the translation is speaking, the volume of the original audio is lowered.\n\nOverlaid voices can be used to introduce the viewer to a different culture or the theme of the program.\n\nThat's why this mode of translation is particularly popular for documentaries, news items, and reality shows.\n\nAudio description\n\nThe audio description is a narration spoken during quieter moments in a film or TV show.\n\nThe audio description provides additional information that would otherwise not be clear from the dialogue.\n\nThis often includes descriptions of the location, characters' facial expressions or the type of scene.\n\nThis mode of translation is important for ensuring audiovisual content is accessible for the visually impaired.\n\nLocalization\n\nLocalization involves translating and adapting all elements of audiovisual content for a target market.\n\nThe aim of audiovisual localization is to provide consumers in the target market with a cultural narrative and context.\n\nIn the original version of Pixar's Inside Out, Riley's father is feeding her broccoli, while the localized version for Japan shows her eating green peppers, which are much more common in the country.\n\nWhy should we care about audiovisual translation?\n\nPeople want to be able to understand the content they're watching or listening to.\n\nFor example, disabled people often encounter accessibility barriers if a production doesn't have subtitles or an audio description.\n\nAnother hurdle is language. While English is often regarded as a lingua franca, only 17% of world's population can speak it. Even so, a mere 5% of YouTube channels post content in multiple languages including English.\n\nWhen looking at English alone, this means most channels are missing out on expanding their potential viewership.\n\nThe same logic applies to all languages. 67% of videos are posted in languages other than English, many of which could benefit from being translated into widely-spoken languages such as English, Spanish or Chinese.\n\nWith the above in mind, audiovisual translation also plays a vital role for businesses.\n\nWhy is audiovisual translation important for businesses?\n\nTranslated audiovisual content can help businesses tap into new markets and gain an edge over competitors.\n\nAccording to the CSA's \"Can't Read, Won't Buy\" report, 72% of consumers will only purchase products sold in their preferred language.\n\nThe business world is already embracing video, with 4 out of 5 companies using this medium as part of their marketing strategy.\n\nHowever, the majority of this content remains untranslated.\n\nWhy isn't more video content being translated?\n\nCosts are a primary factor.\n\nDubbing requires specialist staff at each production stage, making it an expensive process.\n\nSubtitles are a more cost-efficient option, but don't always achieve the desired results in terms of quality.\n\nTime is another important consideration, with tight production deadlines often making translation unviable.\n\nHow can we translate more video content?\n\nTranslation with voice over is generally the best way to save time and money.\n\nAs opposed to dubbing, overlaid voices also retain the charm from the original production.\n\nFurther costs can be saved when using the right tools.\n\nWhich tools work best for translating video content in a cost-effective way?\n\nFrazier, VIDEO TO VOICE's Production Suite, helps to save costs on several fronts:\n\nneural machine translation technology converts the transcript of the audio into the target language\n\nnatural-sounding synthetic voices read out the translation after post-editing\n\nthe audio file is automatically mixed and mastered in post-production to the required broadcasting standards\n\nFrazier uses the latest AI-based technologies to ensure the highest quality standards are maintained.\n\nSummary - what have we learnt?\n\nThere are a number of different approaches towards translating audiovisual content and making it accessible. Even so, due to time and costs, nowhere near enough video content is being translated. While dubbing works well for larger-scale productions, voice over is a more appropriate option for smaller budgets. To lower costs further, it only makes sense to take advantage of AI-based technologies such as those available on Frazier."
