Sound: Sound* films are indicated by the abbreviation \"sd\"; silent by \"si\". Stock: For the 35mm films inflammable is indicated by the abbreviation \"f\" and safety stock by \"nf\". Since all 16mm films are on safety stock these abbreviations have been omitted in the descriptions of these films. Price: Both sales and rental prices have been given in so far as possible. Omission of rental price in the main entry indicates that producer does not rent the film. \"Loan\" instead of price is indicative of a film sent free except for transportation charges. \"Apply\" instead of price has been used when rates and conditions vary and it is necessary to apply to producer for prices. Date: The copyright date is given when it was obtainable but in some cases the re- lease date is given instead. Producer: The producer or authorized distributor given is the one now owning or having access to the negative of the film. A list of producers and distributors is given at the end of this supplement. Distributor: The italic line following some of the entries tells where films may also be rented, giving information obtainable at time of going to press. Symbols are used for distributors' names, a key to which with full information on rates will be found at the end of this supplement. Guide: \"Guide\" is used to indicate the guide for the teacher with which many films prepared for educational purposes are accompanied. INDEX The first part of the Catalog is arranged alphabetically.

COOK AND EVA RAHBEK-SMITH NEW YORK THE H. W. WILSON COMPANY 1940 Published October 1940 Printed in the United States of America PREFACE This is the first annual Supplement to the second edition of the Educational Film Catalog. It is a cumulated number containing all of the material of the January, April and July 1940 quarterly Supplements and some new material. For a complete up-to-date file you now need only the second edition, published in 1939, and this volume. All others may be discarded. Necessary corrections in prices, etc. have been made and films with- drawn from circulation by producers have been withdrawn from this catalog also. Although most of the films here listed have been viewed in our projection room, continuing with our practice of viewing all films which we began for the July Supplement, only a few of the notes used in the January and April Supplements have been changed because of the expense of making such changes. If the note used seemed inaccurate or inadequate, however, it was changed or augmented. Eighty-six books on films, photography, sound recording and related subjects are listed in the Book review section, page vii. The compilers and the H. W. Wilson Company again thank the col- laborators who have helped with advice and film reviewing. A list of those who checked the lists and helped in many ways is given on the following page. Thanks are also due to the producers and distributors who have been most cooperative in sending their films to us for our reviewing purposes and in keeping us well informed of their film activities. The clerical work has been capably done by Romaine Schneeloch and Ellen M. Mullen. October, 1940 Eva Rahbek-Smith Dorothy E.

It is the plan of the Motion Picture Project to combine the results of preview and class- room evaluation into an encyclopedia of films for general education. This encyclopedia will contain case histories of films found effective in cooperating centers. Section I of the bulletin contains preview guides made by the staff in Washington. Criteria for evaluation have been clearly and soundly formulated. Section II ap-* plies these criteria to two specific films, namely the Eastman film 'One-celled Animals', and the Erpi film, 'The Wheat Farmer.' Section III gives, in addition to the recommendations of the Washington staff, the experiences of teach- ers and students in the Santa Barbara City Schools.

Modern methods and materials for teaching science. 351p il $2.50 1940 Macmillan \"This is a valuable publication to be added to all bibliographies in visual education. These science teachers or rather teachers of science teachers — have provided an analysis of the place of mechanical aids to instruction, the psychological justification, basic principles of use, a simple, clear-cut description of projec- tion machines and what makes them work, and an evaluated list of sources of all types of science visual aids. The first section of the book expounds the philosophy of science edu- cation held by the authors, and draws upon other points of view currently held. . . Of extreme importance to visual educationists, however, are Sections 2 and 3. 'Materials and Devices for Teaching Science — Visual and Other Sensory Aids,' includes first a discussion of the psychology of learning by the use of visual aids, and then proceeds to a discussion of the school journey; flat pictures and stere- ographs; photography; objects, specimens and models; designed materials (creative expres- sion); the microscope, telescope; projection ma- chines. For each topic abundant anecdotal and photographic illustrations are provided. The last section 'Sources of Materials for Teaching Science' indicates the same effort of the authors as shown in previous sections at being practical. They have gone further than a discussion of the types and value of visual aids, and have compiled a fully-annotated and evaluated listing of science aids, such as flat pictures, models and specimens, charts and posters, 16mm films, and a bibliography of periodicals and books for students and teachers. Teachers of science are indeed for- tunate in that this long-felt need has at last been met. . .

Study of war propaganda conducted thru moving pictures \"This purports to be a factual study of the relation of motion pictures to war propaganda in the World War of 1914 and in the one now current. Much in the booklet is actual fact, but more of it seems to follow this line of argument: The leading motion picture com- panies are financed and therefore controlled by Wall Street bankers; these bankers wanted the war in 1914 and deliberately used motion pic- tures to stir up the people to hate Germany and demand America's participation on the side of the Allies. Today, so the argument runs, Wall Street bankers are repeating this process; they have already used the movies to glorify war as the only solution of the international conflict. They are now ready for the final step: to bring forth a bunch of pictures designed to show Germany or bolshevism or both as the great villain whom the American people must defeat on the battlefield in order to save civil- ization. We have no brief either for the Wall Street bankers or the motion picture trust, but this argument seems considerably oversimplified and unconvincing.\" Christian century KELIHER, ALICE VIRGINIA, ed.

Some of the primary contentions of this book are that the main objective of education should be the development of human resources along the line of mutual interests and knowl- edge and understanding; that our chief social ills of today . . . can be traced back to the undeveloped state of the mass of people in the different nations, rather than to the inherent evil and predominate selfishness of human nature; that as the vast undevoleped resources of interest and knowledge and understanding are developed, most of our present-day social problems and ills will vanish into thin air. This book holds that for the development of these human resources the young must grow up in a world environment, and it gives a . . . description of the means by which this can be made possible. This book also makes definite suggestions as to such changes in Elementary Science or Nature Study, in Human Science or Psychiatry, in Geography, Literature and His- tory, as would make human nature and the humanity of today the chief subject of study in our schools.\" Publisher's note \"In considering the sort of means that might provide this world range of sight ex- periences for children and people, it is wise to recognise at once that the only practicable means of supplying this primary mental need for people everywhere, is pictures — that as a matter of scientific fact people may gain, by the use of the better pictures at least, ade- quately real experiences of seeing whatever is thus represented; moreover that pictures can be produced in such quantities and at such a small cost as would make it possible to satisfy sufficiently the need of people everywhere for such experiences.\" Introduction 1 OUTERBRIDGE, PAUL.
