        "text": "Updated September 2022.\n\nHow to understand English movies without subtitles – if you’re asking yourself the question, then congratulations!\n\nYou don’t need to feel bad if you’re watching movies or TV series with subtitles.\n\nIt’s already fantastic that you’re watching them in English.\n\nTV is a way for many of us to relax, not study. So congratulate yourself: you’re doing something that you love and improving your English at the same time.\n\nNow you’re feeling a bit better, what can you do to start transitioning away from subtitles? And how can you get rid of them completely?\n\nIt’s not you, it’s them\n\nHave you heard the expression it’s not you it’s me? It’s one of those cowardly lines people say when they want to dump their partner.\n\nWhat’s this got to do with not using subtitles when you watch TV or films in English?\n\nThink about it for a second – could it be that it’s not you, it’s them?\n\n4 Reasons Why You Don’t Need To Feel Guilty About Needing Subtitles\n\n1.Excuse me?\n\nAre you watching TV series or films that are too complex for you? Not too long ago I watched Robocop. I missed a lot of the dialogue in the opening scenes because it was fast and mumbly. I had to really concentrate to pick it up. And I’m a native English speaker!\n\n2. I don’t get it\n\nThink about the types of TV programme people like to watch. Sitcoms are tricky because they’re full of one-liners, wisecrack jokes and other witticisms. Some of these can include plays on words, which are tricky to understand, even with the subtitles.\n\nAnd if you’ve ever watched sitcoms with the subtitles in your native language, you’ll know that translators don’t always get the joke. I’ve seen that many a time with the fan subtitling (fans of the show create the subtitles) of How I Met Your Mother.\n\n3. Whooooooooo?\n\n2 words: Gilmore Girls. I know you know them – it’s one of the best TV series of all time! (if you don’t know what I’m talking about, don’t worry, there’s a video coming up!\n\nThe girls, both called Lorelei, speak at a million miles per hour (must be all that coffee they drink). And they’re constantly referring to politicians, musicians and old American movies. Confession: as a British person, I don’t understand all the references!\n\nIn one episode they decide to get a dog. Dog’s name: Paul Anka. Yes, the dog has a first and last name. The first time I heard what I now know to be the name ‘Paul Anka’, I was like – they called the dog what? Polanker? Paul Anchor? What on earth are they talking about?\n\nIf you’re reading this then English is probably not your native language. You have to catch the person’s name in fast speech. And, even if you do, you might not have the cultural knowledge to understand the reference.\n\nOnce again, it’s not your fault!\n\nBy the way, a quick Google search reveals that Paul Anka is a Canadian-American singer-songwriter. But you’re not going to interrupt a show to check Google are you?\n\nStep 1: Choose a series that deserves you\n\nYour ultimate aim should be enjoyment. Watching films and TV series is one of the most fun things you can do!\n\nNarrow it down. Which series do you really want to understand? Concentrate on this one to start off.\n\none TV show\n\none season\n\none episode at a time\n\nIt takes time to get used to someone’s voice. This probably explains why TV series are more manageable than films. You watch the same characters week in, week out.\n\nA tip for choosing TV series: choose one where there aren’t too many characters or the characters don’t get killed off every episode. I would avoid “The Walking Dead” for instance or even “The Americans”, where many new characters are introduced, only to be killed-off shortly afterwards!\n\nIf you’re more of a film buff, you could look for films by the same director or with the same actors. The same actors generally appear in Wes Anderson’s films.\n\nStill too much? If so, maybe start with another type of TV programme. Instead of a sitcom filled with one-liners, word play and obscure references, go for a reality TV show. You could even try a series intended for kids. Or maybe something more intellectual like a documentary.\n\nAnother great option is Soap Operas. Why? Because they film episodes constantly, week in, week out. Some TV series, like Game of Thrones, only have ten episodes. And each episode is 45-50 minutes long. Unless you wait and binge-watch several seasons in one go of course, which could be amazing, but completely overwhelming.\n\nThe Internet is becoming more and more video based. 20-minute sitcom episodes or 45-minute drama episodes are not the only way to watch in English. My colleague, Cecilia Nobre, wrote a post for teachers on how to use video in the classroom. She gave examples such as:\n\nVideo section of Facebook fanpages – she recommends BBC Culture, Entrepreneur or CNN.\n\nFacebook live videos\n\nYouTube vlogs\n\nStep 2: Use the subtitles, the right way\n\nSo, you’ve chosen 1 series or film director you’re going to concentrate on. Or simply a shorter video.\n\nNow, how do you start getting rid of those annoying subtitles?\n\nUse them, but after the fact.\n\nStart by choosing a scene – just one scene. Not the whole episode and certainly not the whole film. Listen and try to write down what you hear, what you think is going on. You can repeat this several times.\n\nI know this is not quite how you envisaged relaxing in front of Netflicks of an evening, but stick with it, it’ll be worth it.\n\nAfter, go back in and listen with the subtitles on and figure out what you missed. You’ll get some feedback on your problems this way.\n\nDid you misunderstand a word?\n\nWere there problems due to connected speech?\n\nWere there too many new words and expressions?\n\nWas there some kind of cultural reference you didn’t understand?\n\nAs you do this, you’ll start to build up a picture of your difficulties.\n\nIf you’re watching Game of Thrones in English, maybe some of the vocabulary to do with warfare and weaponry is causing you problems.\n\nIf you have a preference for sitcoms, then some of the jokes may contain cultural references you’re not aware of.\n\nMaybe your problem is catching all of the little details like pronouns, articles, or auxiliary verbs.\n\nIf you want to understand a reality TV show, maybe some of the real life vocab, slang and phrasal verbs is proving problematic.\n\nYou can’t understand where your difficulties are coming from until you diagnose them.\n\nSome of these problems may resolve themselves as you watch the show more and you become familiar with the vocabulary.\n\nSome may require some more focused listening work.\n\nIn some cases, you may need to take your listening down a notch and find a series that’s less tricky for you.\n\nAt the very least, you’ll have a plan of attack moving forward.\n\n3. A question you need to ask yourself\n\nHow much is enough?\n\nIf you can understand 80-90% of the series, do you really need to push through to 100%? That’s already a high level of understanding.\n\nTV series have the visual element to accompany them and perhaps that will be enough to push your understanding through. Maybe you won’t have to turn those subtitles back on again.\n\nOnce you’ve gone through a few cycles of choosing shows and then analysing them to figure out where your comprehension difficulties are, you can start turning the subtitles off.\n\nYou can do this gradually. You could start by watching the show in your language and then re-watch it in English with and then without subtitles.\n\nYou can make this process more complex, gradually removing the steps.\n\nFor example, go straight into the English version with English subtitles, rather than watching dubbed into your language or with subtitles in your language. As you gradually remove these elements, you’ll get closer to being able to watch from the first viewing 100% in English.\n\nBut you have to accept that it’s a process. You can’t expect to watch everything without subtitles in the beginning, but you can get there.\n\nHow To Understand English Movies Without Subtitles: A Summary\n\nChoose the right type of film or show. Accept that you may have to come down a level (shorter videos, videos with just one speaker) before you can watch what you really want to watch without subtitles.\n\nFocus on just one show, one episode, one scene.\n\nUse subtitles after the fact, as a way to check your understanding.\n\nTransition gradually away from subtitles in your language, to subtitles in English to watching with and without subtitles and so on.\n\nAre you trying to watch shows and films in English without subtitles?
