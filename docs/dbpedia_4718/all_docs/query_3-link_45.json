With the help of subtitles I can understand the context of the movie well.\n\nBut When my purpose is to imitate the dialogue of the characters, I believe subtitles are not solving the purpose.\n\nAre there any videos / movies available with subtitles based on exact pronunciation (even it's informal English) of the characters speak?\n\nPlease help me - Thanks in Advance."
