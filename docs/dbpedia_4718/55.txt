Whenever I watch movie with subtitles, I've a feeling of I'm hearing something and reading something else. With the help of subtitles I can understand the context of the movie well.

But When my purpose is to imitate the dialogue of the characters, I believe subtitles are not solving the purpose.

Are there any videos / movies available with subtitles based on exact pronunciation (even it's informal English) of the characters speak?

Please help me - Thanks in Advance.
