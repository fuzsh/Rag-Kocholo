1

My faith has found a resting place,

Not in device nor creed;

I trust the Ever-living One,

His wounds for me shall plead. I need no other argument,

I need no other plea;

It is enough that Jesus died,

And that He died for me.

2

Enough for me that Jesus saves,

This ends my fear and doubt;

A sinful soul I come to Him,

He’ll never cast me out. I need no other argument,

I need no other plea;

It is enough that Jesus died,

And that He died for me.

3

My heart is leaning on the Word,

The written Word of God,

Salvation by my Savior’s name,

Salvation through His blood. I need no other argument,

I need no other plea;

It is enough that Jesus died,

And that He died for me.
