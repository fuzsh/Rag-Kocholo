He says his home is on Rabb’s Prairie, Fayette county. The facts as developed at the inquest held over the body of Mr. Kocurek, by W. H. Perry, Esp., are as follows: Some time since the father-in-law of Mr. Kocurek lost a horse supposed to have been stolen. About ten days ago the horse returned., Saturday Mr. Kocurek was at the village of Ammannsville, this negro rode up making inquiry of a horse of the discription[sic] of the one above mentioned. Mr. Kocurek told the negro that a horse of that character was in his neighborhood; and the negro bargained with Mr. Kocurek to give him $2.50 to deliver the horse. Mr. Kocurek then to make sure of the negro’s capture, got a friend, and both armed with Winchester rifles, went to the pasture where the horse was and took him out. The negro claimed the horse, paid Mr. Kocurek the reward, and started off leading the animal. He was ordered to halt as the horse was claimed by other parties. This frightened the negro who began to run, Mr. Kocurek pursued him on horseback, and in trying to shoot to scare him a cartridge hung in the gun in such a manner that it could not be discharged He then ran up beside the negro and pulled him off his horse. Both parties came to the ground together, and in the scuffle the gun was dropped. The negro picked it up and before Mr. Kocurek could gain his feet the negro clubbed him to death with it, mashed his head to a jelly. The murderer was then captured by Will Ratliff with others, who happened to see the difficulty. The officers were immediately notified and arrived as soon as horse flesh could take them to the scene of the murder, by which time crowds of the murdered man’s neighbors began to gather, and it was with considerable bluff and persuasion that the officers could prevent the murderer from being mobbed. Mr. Kocurek was respected in the neighborhood, was a man of considerable means, about 35 years old. The negro was a young fellow, about 23 or 24 years old. He is now safe in the La Grange jail, and in due time will have justice meted out to him.

Saturday by August Beken, who had stopped in to visit him. His clothing had burned off and he was severely burned about the head and face.\n\nJustice of the Peace H W. Haase Sr,. ruled it “accidental death by fire,: but it was not determined whether Mr. Koehler died of heart failure, shock,or possibly from inhaling the flames and smoke. He had had a malignancy removed from his throat sometime ago, and inhalation of dust or smoke was a constant danger.\n\nMr. Koehler was last seen alive about 11 a.m. Saturday by Johnnie Barton, who went every day to feed his livestock.

Neither that floor nor the one in the other room was burned.\n\nRev. Frank H.

The silver cord of life was loosed and the golden bowl of her daily tasks was broken. The enveloping mists of earth for her have drifted away before the sunlight of Heaven. She has entered through the hidden portals and has gained the vision in that summer land of the soul where morning becomes noon and the curtain of night is never hung.\n\nMrs. Koenig was born and reared in Colorado County near the little town of Frelsburg. She was born February 20th, 1862 and lived her whole life in this county. She was a member of the Frelsburg Lutheran c\\church. She was married to the helpmate she leaves behind in the church of her childhood, March 7th, 1895 at Frelsburg.\n\nShe is survived by the following relatives and children: Alice, now Mrs. E. A. Reitz, and Leole, now Mrs. Burt Cox and Simon Koenig, and also by two sisters, Mrs. Annie George of Garwood and Ida Weishuhn of the same place.\n\nShe passed away in the gathering of the cold evening shadows on February 21st, surrounded by the weeping loved ones and was laid to eternal rest in beautiful Odd Fellows Rest at 10 o’clock Feby [sic] 22nd, 1929. She lived for those who loved her, a quiet useful Christian life, and to them out of the days to follow when they go about the tasks of their daily lives will come the healing balm of the consciousness that all is well with her and that someday we know not when, and someplace we know not where, the shall be re-united.\n\nWhen the blasts of winter come, if our Father in His all-wise and omnipotent power shelters the willow and the rosebud and the palm in nature’s protecting robe, and holds forth the promise of returning summers, He will not withhold the promise of the life to the still soul waiting in the grave. We are told not to listen for some message from the misty beyond. “That never morn wears to evening but some hearts do break” for man is born to die. God’s promise to the faithful is that death is nothing more than a rebirth upon some Elysian shore.\n\nSafe in the arms of Jesus at last!\n\nWe weep but are comforted.\n\n“Life is a beautiful shell.\n\nThrown up by eternity’s flow.\n\nOn Time’s bank of quicksand to dwell\n\nAnd a moment of lovliness [sic] show\n\nGone back to its clement grand\n\nIs the billow that brought it ashore.\n\nSee! Another is washing the Strand\n\nAnd the beautiful is no more.”\n\nColorado County Citizen, March 21, 1929\n\nTranscribed by Judy Talkington\n\nKoenig, Bertha (Kobersky)\n\nLast Rites for Mrs. F.

Koenig Killed in Automobile Accident.\n\nA thrill of horror pervaded the hearts of our people Friday afternoon when the wires flashed the news that Jos. Koenig, a former well known citizen of this place, but later traveling as a drummer for a New Orleans house, had been killed in an automobile accident near Richmond. The remains were brought to this city Saturday afternoon and interred in the Masonic cemetery. From particulars as learned by the Mercury,it seems that Mr. Koenig and a fellow drummer were in an automobile, coming from Houston to Richmond, a negro man acting as driver of the car. The west-bound passenger train came along when they were a few miles out of Richmond, and the negro endeavored to race with the train. This he did for several miles, but when nearing Richmond he had to make a swift and sudden turn, and in doing so his car skidded and turned over, with the result that Mr. Koenig was caught under the seat of the car and killed, and the negro seriously crippled. The other passenger was thrown clear of the car, and aside from a few bruises was not hurt. Mr. Koenig's body was taken to Houston and prepared for burial. Mr. Koenig was for years a merchant of this city, being senior member of the firm of Koenig & Klimicek, and was one of the most popular men who ever lived in this section, being well acquainted, pleasant of manner, upright and honorable, hence his tragic death has caused much sadness throughout the community. A few years ago he was united in marriage to Miss Dona Townsend, one of our most popular and best girls, and she and a little son survive. Mr. Koenig was a member of Oesterreich lodge, 0. D. H. S., and also of the Weimar Fire Department, and his burial took place under the auspices of these two organizations.

On February 2nd, 1885, Mr. Kohleffel died leaving her with her small children and the place to finish paying for, although lots of people would have given up in dispair, [sic] for the responsibilities of caring for her small children and paying for her place rested heavily upon her, and the fact that she raised them all to be grown men and women and payed [sic] for the place is evidence that she succeeded in her efforts. Mutter Kohleffel was a good woman. She has suffered hardships and disappointments and trials beyond the capacity of many women to endure. Under it all she had a cheerful disposition and had many friends who will deeply regret her untimely death.\n\nShe leaves to mourn her sad departure, four sons; Theo.
