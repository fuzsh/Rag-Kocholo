        "text": "Marie Laveau died on June 15, 1881. The New York Times, on June 23, 1881, published a lengthy obituary regarding her “as a dealer in the black arts and a person to be dreaded and avoided” (2). However, the obituary also highlights Laveau’s “healing knowledge” and where “her advice was oft-times really valuable and her penetration remarkable” along with “the gift of great beauty…[that] no wonder that she possessed large influence in her youth and attracted the attention of Louisiana’s men and most distinguished visitors”(2). The obituary paints a contradicting picture. The obituary also touches on the rest of Marie Laveau’s life, concluding with her burial in St. Louis #1 cemetery. The New York Times states:\n\nThe secrets of her life, however, could only be obtained from the old lady herself, but she would never tell the smallest part of what she knew, and now her lips are closed forever, and as she could neither read nor write, not a scrap of evidence is left to chronicle her exciting life (2).\n\nIn “Marie Laveau: A Nineteenth-Century Voudou Priestess,” Carolyn Long attempted to try and gather what was published on the legendary woman to make a cohesive tale. She notes that opinions on Laveau were divided and included rejections of the idea she was a real voodoo priestess despite her contributions to the community. At the same time, other sources cited her as having “‘drunken orgies on the bayou’” with her followers (264). Even after her death, she still captured people’s imaginations in today’s pop culture. An example of this is how the icon of the voodoo priestess became a black archetype. Another example of Maire Laveau capturing people’s interests is seeing reimagined characters reappear in season three of American Horror Story in New Orleans.\n\nWhile it is recorded that Marie Laveau is buried in St. Louis Cemetery no. 1, New Orleans’s oldest cemetery, there are some challenges to this accepted notion. Long notes that through the efforts of the Louisiana Writers Project, some of the older residents of New Orleans that they interviewed recorded that Laveau was buried in St. Louis Cemetery #2 instead (287). St. Louis no. 1 cemetery is the oldest cemetery located in the city and characterized by raised tombs and is known collectively as one of the “Cities of the Dead.” St. Louis no. 2 Cemetery also has raised tombs and is home to many famous blues and jazz musicians. However, St. Louis no. 2 Cemetery also contains the “‘Wishing Vault’…[and today] both gravesites are visited by devotees who draw cross marks on the marble and slabs and leave offerings” (Long “Marie Laveau” 288). The purpose of drawing x’s in voodoo symbolizes wish making and giving. It has become commonplace by visitors in the past to mark the recorded gravesite of Marie Laveau with three x’s. However, this is considered vandalism, and there is an etiquette to follow when visiting cemeteries. As a result, St. Louis no. 1 banned tourists after repeated vandalism of the crypts. Today, one solo company offers tours to New Orleans’s oldest cemetery. In addition to Maire Laveau’s resting place in St. Louis Cemetery no. 1, there are still rumors that she may also be buried (at one time or another in St. Louis Cemetery no. 2), at a location known as the “Wishing Valut.” In the lecture “The Tomb of Marie Laveau in St. Louis Cemetery no.1,” the writer notes that there is evidence from a map from 1937 with three wall tombs along with an Iberville wall labeled “Maire Laveau” or “daughter” (Long “The Tomb” 12). This is one piece of “proof,” however, this resting place doesn’t belong to Maire Laveau. This fascination doesn’t stop people from visiting and occasionally putting offerings, prayers, and even marking the tombs with x’s.\n\nBut why would people continue to visit and mark up Marie Laveau’s tomb? What is it that captures people’s imaginations? While the actual funeral was held in St. Louis no. 1, other testimonies suggest she is buried elsewhere. The Louisiana Writers’ Project uncovered this during the 1940s through interviews. However, one thing that is commonly overlooked is who is actually buried in the tomb. Due to the sensationalism of Laveau’s life after her death and the mystery surrounding voodoo, there has been a lot of speculation over the decades. In truth, more than 84 people are interred in Maire Laveau’s St. Louis no. 1 tomb (Bruno). In a lecture titled “The Tomb of Marie Laveau in St. Louis Cemetery no.1,” Caryoln Morrow Long observes that in addition to being a voodoo priestess, Laeveu’s Catholic faith was also important to her character. Marie Laveau embodies one specific aspect of the Catholic Church, which was, “Corporal Works of Mercy, in which the faithful are instructed to “feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, shelter the homeless, visit the sick, visit the imprisoned, and bury the dead” (Long “The Tomb” 2). Her charitable giving also continued to help others in death. It wasn’t uncommon for multiple people to be buried in familial tombs, and this was no exception for Laveau and her tomb. Of the 84 that call Laveau’s tomb their final resting place, 25 family members (including children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren), 7 family members, and 6 neighbors (Bruno). It wasn’t uncommon for multiple people to be buried in a single tomb which became part of the characteristics of how the city buried their dead, which defined New Orleans’s “Cities of the Dead.” However, who were these people? Why are they buried there? Stephanie Bruno concludes that this was an extension of Maire Laveau’s generous nature. After Laveau died in 1881, the media cast her as a mysterious voodoo figure from the Louisiana bayous. In truth, contrasting the accounts, Maire lived her life in service to her community. Laveau “ministered to the sick…comforted prisoners on death row…[and even] sponsored an orphan” (Bruno). This service extended into death, where “when someone died, she was all too willing to lease space in her family tomb (likely built in the 1830s) or lend a spot to someone awaiting placement somewhere else” (Bruno). Marie Laveau’s tomb was an extension of her giving and charitable personality instead of a shrine to some mysterious ritual.\n\nMarie Laveau captured people’s imaginations after her death in 1881. Even today, people continue to visit her tomb. There is more, though, to Marie Laveau. Her tomb houses more than just her in death, but multiple people. She was more than a voodoo priestess. Her tomb stands as a final testament to her generous and charitable nature to people and the city of New Orleans."
