        "text": "What’s going on in Pittsburgh this weekend, Aug. 8-11? Find out here. Know of a cool event? Email us.\n\nThursday, Aug. 8-Sunday, Aug. 11: Paw-lympics Adoption Event at Humane Animal Rescue of Pittsburgh\n\nVarious times\n\nNow that we’re done cheering on Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky and the “Pommel Horse Guy,” it’s time to make this week a gold medal victory for adorable, adoptable dogs. There’s never been a better time to find your furry new BFF because HARP is waiving adoption fees for dogs aged 6 months and older through Aug. 11. Coinciding with the last week of the Summer Olympics in Paris, the initiative reduces financial barriers to adoption. The Paw-lympic Adoption Games happen at HARP’s East Side and North Side facilities. Information.\n\nFriday, Aug. 9: “Echoes to Omega” Opening Reception at the Mattress Factory\n\n6-8 p.m.\n\nBe among the first to experience Azza El Siddique’s new multimedia exhibition at the North Side museum. Meet the artist, join an exclusive exhibition preview and enjoy light refreshments. Selected through the museum’s International Open Call, Siddique created the installation to investigate “an archeological anomaly, ancient burial practices and the hidden narratives that shape our understanding of time.” “Echoes to Omega” features ceramic figures, steel architecture, video, water and even scents. Register.\n\nSaturday, Aug. 10: Steel City Mods vs Rockers at Paradise Island Bowl & Beach\n\n12-5 p.m.\n\nThe Burgh might be landlocked, but we’ve got three rivers and a slew of islands. Cruise down to Neville Island for beach bar fun when the region pays tribute to rockabilly culture and vintage vehicles. It’s a one-day mecca for retro motorcycles, sleek scooters and rad racers. Dust off that old-school classic, join the bike contest and shop for goods, gear and gifts in the vendor market. This year’s featured band, Labretta Suede and the Motel 6, is coming from New Zealand. Information.\n\nSaturday, Aug. 10: Hilltop County Fair in Allentown\n\n1-9 p.m.\n\nThe Big Butler Fair may be over for the summer, but the big top fun continues on the Hilltop. Step right up for Enjoy Wrestling’s Human Demolition Derby, the Miss Bottlerocket Pageant and country musician Dale Hollow. Revelers can play pinball, watch pie-eating contests and shop for records, books and gifts in the Showcase Row vendor area. The second-annual fair includes a charity dunk tank, yard games and food purveyors. Free to all ages, the daylong festival takes place at the RE360 warehouse (100 Asteroid Way) and Bottlerocket Social Hall. Information.\n\nSaturday, Aug. 10: Rock, Reggae & Relief at Stage AE\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nAfter rocking Downtown for six years, one of Pittsburgh’s signature summer music festivals is taking the show to the North Shore. The goodwill, good vibes and good music will flow when this celebration brings national acts and acclaimed locals together for a great cause. Fusing reggae, ska, funk and rock, the all-ages event benefits Pittsburgh Scholar House. The sizzling lineup features the Dirty Heads, The Movement, The Elovaters, Third World and Roots of Creation, along with Pittsburgh’s own Fubar and DJ TJ Harris. New this year are colorful festival blankets and autographed band photographs for sale. The fest also features tastings hosted by Maggie’s Farm Rum, custom art by Wavy Wednesday and an after-party at Shorty’s Pins x Pints. Pregame at the free kickoff party on Aug. 9 at Revel. Tickets.\n\nSaturday, Aug. 10: Millvale Music Summer Picnic at Millvale Riverfront Park\n\n4-10 p.m.\n\nMillvale Music Festival rocked the borough in May, and now the homegrown music festival is hosting a more chill vibe along the Allegheny River. It’s an afternoon of al fresco bands, bites and brews paired with sunshine in the park. Enjoy free performances by local musicians, fuel up with mobile food purveyors and sip suds from area beer makers. Information.\n\nSunday, Aug. 11: Morning Dog Paddle at North Park Lake\n\n8-10 a.m.\n\nIf your four-legged friend loves a good glide, don’t miss this doggie-and-me paddle hosted by Venture Outdoors. Connect with other paddlers and pets during this peaceful Sunday morning kayak. The slow-paced, 2-mile trip will include basic instructions before the group heads out onto the water. Tickets.\n\nSunday, Aug. 11: Neighborhood Flea at SouthSide Works\n\n10 a.m.-3 p.m.\n\nThe dog days of summer are ideal for strolls through Pittsburgh’s fave flea market. The Neighborhood Flea has been celebrating its milestone 10th anniversary with a new HQ on the South Side. Lining South 27th and Sidney streets with 100 vendors, the juried market showcases a selection of goods from local sellers, makers, boutiques, collectors and small businesses. The event includes live music, hands-on workshops and free parking. Information.\n\nEven more things to do this weekend …\n\nFans of comics, pop culture and cult cinema will flock to Steel City Con at the Monroeville Convention Center from Aug. 9 to 11. On Saturday, Aug. 10, Barrel & Flow comes to The Stacks at 3 Crossings. The premier showcase of Black beer makers, chefs, artists and musicians has expanded to include events running all week at multiple locations, from Aug.6-11. Ready to make your eating habits more healthy and sustainable? Make a beeline for Pittsburgh VegFest at Allegheny Commons Park on Saturday, Aug. 10, for a celebration of cuisine, animal welfare and advocacy."
