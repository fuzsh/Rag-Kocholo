Nathan.\n\nDeep sorrow was spread over the entire city when on last Saturday afternoon at a quarter to four o'clock, the soul of Louis Nathaniel Nathan, who for a long time has been in ill health, passed into the Great Beyond, where heart-aches and sorrows are unknown.\n\nLouis Nathan was 32 years of age. He was the eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. J. Nathan of this city and junior member of the firm of J. Nathan & Son. He was a most excellent young man and every one in this whole community liked him.\n\nThe remains were taken to Hallettsville on Sunday's train and were met at the station by a large number of friends of the deceased and members of the Masonic fraternity, who conveyed them to the home of his sister, Mrs. M. M. Landa. Just before the funeral procession left the home of his sister, services were held by Rabbi Warsaw of Waco, who delivered a beautiful tribute to the memory of the departed one. The funeral procession was one of the largest ever seen in Hallettsville, showing the very high esteem in which Louis was held there, as well as in his home town and wherever he was known. At the grave Dr. Warsaw again officiated, after which the members of the Masonic lodges of Hallettsville and Eagle Lake took charge of the remains and performed the last sad rites in accordance with the ritual of that order.\n\nIn the death of Louis Nathan, a young man beloved by all who knew him, has gone to his last reward.

Ida was a member of 50 years with SPJST Lodge 4 of Hallettsville, and a member of St. Peter Lutheran Church of Hallettsville. She was a resident of Stevens Nursing & Rehabilitation Center for the last four years. Ida worked as a waitress and cook in her earlier years, and she was a homemaker. After the grandkids were born, she decided to stay at home and take care of them, and they were her pride and joy. Ida loved playing bingo, dominoes, and her cats and dogs when she was at home. She was very happy to have had her 90th birthday in 2006. Ida remembered having to walk and riding a donkey to school. She picked cotton and worked in the fields. She baked kolaches, bread, and pies from scratch. Her most prized possession was her old pedal sewing machine, which she took to Stevens and sewed quilt tops and quilted quilts on it. She sewed clothes for many years, never using a pattern. She would not hear of getting an electric sewing machine. Ida will be missed by her family and dear friends. We thank everyone who shared in her life. Our sincere thanks to the staff of Stevens and Hospice for the great love and care that they gave her.

His young wife is almost distracted at his terrible death.\n\nIt is a curious fact that there are always two innocent persons killed for one burglar by these spring guns and other burglar killing devices, and it would seem that people would learn to quit setting these deadly traps.
