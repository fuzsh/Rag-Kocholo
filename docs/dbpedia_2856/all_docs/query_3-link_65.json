A trusting woman with many friends and no known enemies, she had left her doors and windows unlocked, as was her custom; yet there was no evidence that anyone had entered the house.\n\nInvestigating officers found her two purses with money in them and small amounts of money hidden in various places around the home. An old-age pension receiver, she was known to have little money.\n\nFrom the position of her body, clad in a nightgown, officers deduced she had been sitting on the edge of the bed, preparing to retire for the night, when she was shot.\n\nDr. C. T. Dufner, who examined the body, said the shot was almost instantly fatal. It entered her back toward the right side, went through the upper part of her body, and lodged in the upper part of her left arm.\n\nPaul Boethel, newly elected district attorney, who with Sheriff Theo Long has been leading the investigation, said Wednesday that the .22 long rifle slug recovered is not too damaged for a ballistics test.\n\nCARTRIDGE FOUND\n\nThe nearest thing to a clue in the case was the empty .22 long rifle cartridge the officers found Wednesday of this week. They said it could be the one that held the fatal bullet. A badly corroded, unfired cartridge of the same caliber was found near another window, but because of its condition it was not considered to have any connection with the case.\n\nACCIDENT RULED OUT\n\nPossibility of a âstrayâ shot by a night hunter was ruled out because of the angle at which the bullet entered the house and the body. The hole in the screen showed that it went straight through, and that side of the house is so situated against rising ground that that a shot from any distance would have to enter at a downward angle.\n\nIt was not believed to have been a richochet shot, either, because of the way it penetrated the womanâs body, even after striking a rib.\n\nFUNERAL MONDAY\n\nFuneral services were held at Hallettsville Monday morning, with burial in the Moravia Catholic Cemetery.\n\nSurvivors include two sons, Julius of Hallettsville and Jim of Richmond; seven daughters, Mrs. Ad.

Deputy sheriff Burkett, Squire Tampke, Dr. J. D. Gray and eeveral [sic] other at once repaired to the scene.\n\nOn entering the door the first object seen was the 15 months old baby, with its glassy eyes turned up and a fearful wound in its abdomen, from which the intestines protruded. A few feet away lay the body of its mother, with both breasts nearly shot away and partly burned and charred as, her dress had been set on fire by the powder. The same shots that tore away the womanâs breasts also killed the baby, which she had evidently been holding on her arm when the murderous assault was committed.\n\nThere were evidences of a terrible struggle. The room was covered with blood and brains. Stefkeâs gun, which had laid near the bodies with three empty shells on the floor and two in the gun, did the bloody work of the murderer. As the woman was not killed with those terrible wounds, the murderer, after a scuffle with the woman, who in trying to save her life had evidently caught hold of the gun, as shown by the bloody finger marks upon the barrel, but it was jerked away from her and the muzzle placed to her head and nearly the whole top of her head shot away, scattering blood and brains all over the ceiling and walls, making one of the most sickening sights to behold. The weapon used was a double barrel shot gun, the property of Stefka, and five shots were fired, as there were three empty bloody shells on the floorand [sic] two empty shells in the gun, which were inserted with bloody fingers, as the bloody finger marks thereon show.\n\nThis is the most terrible tragedy ever enacted in the neighborhood of Shiner, and almost in the county. Joe Stefka the husband and a brother-in-law of his, Joe Motl, have both been placed under arrest, and were both carried to Halletsville last Thursday for safe keeping, pending their examining trial, which will take place Monday here at Shiner.\n\nStefka denies any knowledge as to who did the killing. He claims that he was in the field at work during the morning, and returned to his home about 10 oâclock to shuck some corn for his horses, and there he went to the house and discovered the dead body of his wife and child. He states that he heard no guns fired nor any disturbance whatever. The officers discovered blood spots on Stefkaâs clothes and boots, but he claims that this came from killing a hog the day previous.\n\nThe theory advanced by Stefka and his friends is that it was a case of suicide.\n\nThe officers have been diligent in working up the case. Sheriff Nobles and County Attorney Bagley came over last Thursday and made a thorough investigation of the case. Sheriff Noble was also in town last Friday and Saturday looking up evidence.\n\nShiner Gazette, 22 Feb 1905\n\nJustice Court.\n\nThe examining trial of Joe Stefka, charged with killing his wife and baby, came before this court last Monday.

Otto was just entering man hood and was a strong, well built young man. The stronger a person is the sooner he succumbs to this terrible disease. A sad feature of case was that his father had been absent at Corpus Christi during the week and was all unaware of the serious illness of his son. He was slightly ill Wednesday, the day of the excursion, but it was thought to be a mild case of slow fever. When Mr. Stephan arrived at home Saturday he found his son dying. Otto was an exceedingly studious and industrious young man and was his fatherâs right hand man in his mill and gin works.\n\nThe funeral took Sunday eve at 4 oâclock from the family residence and the remains were interred in the O D H S cemetery.
