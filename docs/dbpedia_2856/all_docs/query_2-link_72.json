        "meta_description": "Benefits of batsBats are highly beneficial to people, and the advantages of having them around far outweigh any problems you might have with them. As predators of night-flying insects (including mosquitoes!), bats play a role in preserving the natural balance of your property or neighborhood.Although swallows and other bird species consume large numbers of flying insects, they generally feed only in daylight. When night falls, bats take over: a nursing female little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) may consume her body weight in insects each night during the summer.",

        "text": "For some people bats don't present a problem. For others, bats can be a worry, especially when they become unwanted guests in an attic, inside a wall of a home, or inside the home itself.\n\nUnlike rodents, bats only have small teeth for eating insects, so they do not gnaw holes in walls, shred material for nests, chew electrical wiring, or cause structural damage to buildings. Damage caused by bats is usually minimal, but they can be noisy and alarming, and the smell of bats and their droppings can be offensive. It is possible to learn to coexist with bats, and to benefit from their presence.​\n\nRemoving bats from your home\n\nIn spring and fall, migrating bats may temporarily roost outside on window screens, fence posts, piles of lumber, and other unlikely places. If a bat is seen roosting outside during daylight hours, leave it alone. It will probably be gone the following morning.\n\nIf a bat flies into your home it's probably a juvenile learning to fly, a solitary male following prey, or an adult that has been excluded from its roost . Bats often enter through an open door or window, or by coming down a chimney into an unused fireplace.\n\nAt nightfall (if you are sure the bat has not been in contact with humans or pets), turn off any lights in the room where the bat is confined, open all doors and windows that lead outside, and stand in the corner. This allows you to watch the bat while staying out of its way. (If you must move around the room, stay as near to the wall as possible.) Be prepared to watch the bat for up to 20 minutes. Normally, the bat will fly around the room to orient itself, and then leave.\n\nIf the bat seems to have disappeared but you didn't see it leave, it may be perched somewhere, such as behind a curtain, in hanging clothes, or in a houseplant. The bat will generally choose a high place to roost. Moving these things around with a broomstick may arouse the bat.\n\nIf the bat doesn't leave, it can be caught and released outdoors away from people and pets. Approach the bat slowly and place a container (small box, large glass, Tupperware container, coffee can) over it. Next, gently slide a piece of cereal box paper or cardboard underneath the bat (be gentle—bats are fragile animals). Using the paper as a cover, take the bat outside. The ideal release procedure is to place the container against a tree, slowly slide the paper away, and then remove the container. Releasing the bat against a tree allows the bat to rest safe from potential predators—like the neighbor's cat.\n\nWatch this video from Idaho Fish and Game for tips on how to safely remove a bat from your home.\n\nNote: State wildlife offices do not provide bat removal services, but you can find the names of individuals or companies that do under Nuisance Wildlife Control Operators or you can look up \"Animal Control,\" \"Wildlife Control,\" or \"Pest Control\" in you phone directory.\n\nExcluding bats from buildings\n\nThe best way to get rid of bats is also the safest—both for the bats and the humans involved. This is to humanely exclude them. However, because old buildings offer many points of entry it may be impossible to completely exclude bats from them, or from those with shake or cedar shingle roofs that have no underlayment.\n\nA wildlife damage control company experienced in excluding bats can be hired, or you can do the exclusion work yourself. In attics and areas where large numbers of bats have been roosting for years, it is safer for you to hire a professional to do the work, including the cleanup of accumulated droppings.\n\nNote: Never trap flightless young or adult bats inside a structure; this is needlessly cruel to the bats inside and can create a serious odor problem.\n\nTrapping and relocating bats is not recommended. Traps can be fatal to bats if left unattended and can quickly become overcrowded. In addition, bats have excellent homing instincts and, when released, they may simply return to the capture area. Yuma myotis bats released 240 miles from their roost have found their way back.\n\nCommon entry points used by bats:\n\nDown chimneys and where chimneys and other masonry meet the side of a house.\n\nJoints between window frames and house siding.\n\nJoints around large exterior beams.\n\nAt building corners.\n\nWhere pipes or wires penetrate the ceiling or walls in attics.\n\nBetween porches or other additions and the main house.\n\nAt roof edges, ridge caps, soffits, and fascia boards.\n\nWhere walls meet the eaves at the gable of an attic.\n\nPrior to excluding bats, consider partitioning bats off from the area where they are in conflict with humans, and allowing them to roost elsewhere in the structure. An effective partition can be made from construction grade plastic sheeting and wooden battens. Another consideration is to provide an alternate roost site, such as a properly designed and installed bat house mounted close to one of their exits. Install the bat house before excluding the bats as described below.\n\nThe following will work to exclude bats from most structures:\n\nOption A – Build bats out: From mid-October to mid-March, when bats should still be hibernating, or after you have made sure no bats are roosting in the attic or other area, seal all potential entry holes (Fig. 5). Entering the attic during the day may reveal light shining through otherwise unnoticed cracks and holes. Insert pieces of fiberglass insulation or bits of stick in these holes to mark them for repair from the outside.\n\nThe advantage of caulk over foam is that it comes in a variety of colors and it is easier to apply. Before purchasing, check the label to make sure the caulk can be painted.\n\nInsulation blown into wall spaces may be an effective barrier, but it must be done when bats are absent to avoid trapping them in the fill.\n\nIf bats are present, holes can also be blocked over a period of days early in the evening after the bats have left the structure to feed. Do this only from mid-August to mid-October (after the young bats have learned to fly and before cold weather arrives). Another window of opportunity occurs in early spring, before the birthing period in May.\n\nFor several days, bat counts should be made as holes are closed, leaving the main exit open. On the night of the final count after the bats have left, the main hole should be plugged to prevent their reentry (Fig. 6). The following evening, the plugging should be removed to allow any remaining bats to leave before the exit is sealed.\n\nOption B – Harassment: If bats are present and have to be excluded, persuade them to move to one of their alternate roost sites by creating an undesirable atmosphere. The time to do this is from mid-August to mid-October, after the young bats have learned to fly and before cold weather arrives. Another window of opportunity occurs in early spring, before the birthing period in May.\n\nBats don't like to roost under bright, windy, or noisy conditions. Therefore, locate the area where bats are roosting and light the area with a bright light, such as a mechanic's drop-light or trouble light, located away from burnable objects. (Use a fluorescent light to save on electricity and keep the heat level down.) In addition, aim a fan and a loud radio at the bats. Begin the harassment process shortly before dark and keep it in place day and night.\n\nBecause bats may move to a dark, protected area, you may need to move the lights and other equipment, or install them in various areas. Putting up sheets of plastic to separate the bats from the rest of the area can be effective, but make sure you don't block the bats' exit or exits.\n\nCommercially available ultrasonic devices may be effective if they are placed in a small, confined area with the roosting bats. Since bats can hear high frequency sounds, these devices, inaudible to humans, supposedly bombard the bat's range with jackhammer-like noise.\n\nNaphthalene flakes or mothballs should not be used to exclude bats. These contain chemicals that can be toxic to humans and other life forms; poisoned bats may fall to the ground where they die slowly and are more likely to come into contact with children or pets.\n\nOption C – Install exclusion devices: Again, from mid-August to mid-October (after the young bats have learned to fly and before cold weather arrives), or in early spring (before the birthing period in May), identify the exit(s) bats are using. Have friends or family members stationed at the corners of the structure after sunset on a warm calm night. They need to be far enough away to see as much of the structure as possible without having to turn their heads; it takes only a second for a bat to exit and take flight. Note which side of the structure bats are seen from. On subsequent nights, focus your attention there to locate the exit hole. Remember this hole can be as small as ½-inch.\n\nBats often defecate when exiting and reentering a building, so look closely for rice-sized black droppings clinging to the side of the structure. If droppings are observed, the exit hole will be directly above it. (To make sure droppings are new, remove the existing droppings or lay down newspaper over them to see if more droppings appear.) Bat body oils may also discolor a well-used opening.\n\nSeal all entry holes but one using the methods described in Option A.\n\nExclude bats by covering the one existing entry hole with a device that allows bats to exit the structure, but prevents them from reentering. Install the exclusion devices during the day and leave them in place for five to seven days (longer during particularly cool or rainy weather).\n\nWhen bats are using multiple openings to exit and enter, exclusion devices should be placed on each opening, unless you can be sure that all roosting areas used by the bats are connected. If all the roosting areas are connected, all but one or two exit holes can be sealed as described below. Place exclusion devices over the one or two remaining exit holes.\n\nHowever, if the colony contains a hundred bats or more, which is common, leaving only one exit point can create a \"bat log jam.\" In these cases, some bats might start looking for alternative ways out of the roost area, leading to bats finding their way into human-occupied areas. So, always watch to make sure bats are able to exit freely. If they do not appear to be exiting, or appear to be having trouble doing so, open additional exits.\n\nIf the exclusion process was successful, immediately seal up the exits to prevent bats from reentering. If necessary, install a chimney cover, available from home improvement centers, or make your own.\n\nBats roosting above porches and other areas\n\nBats temporarily roost above porches or under overhangs at night to eat large prey, digest, rest, and socialize. In such cases, they may frighten humans, or their droppings may accumulate. Nontoxic aerosol sprays, designed to repel dogs and cats, can prevent bats from night-roosting in these areas.\n\nThe spray is applied by day when bats are not present, and is reported to be effective for several months. However, aerosol repellents are not an adequate substitute for excluding bats that are using the area as a day roost, and should never be applied when bats are in a roost.\n\nMylar balloons or strips of aluminum foil hung from the porch ceiling and allowed to move in the breeze may also discourage bats from roosting in that area.\n\nPublic health concerns\n\nLarge accumulations of bat droppings may harbor histoplasmosis fungi spores, which when inhaled can result in a lung infection referred to as \"histo.\" No histo cases have been reported in Washington, but precautions should be followed when cleaning or removing large accumulations of bat droppings. Call your local health department for recommendations.\n\nRabies\n\nPeople are more often concerned about bats because of rabies, a virus that affects the nervous system of all mammals, including humans.\n\nRabies is spread when the saliva of an infected animal enters another body through a bite or scratch, or makes contact with their eyes, nose, mouth, or a break in the skin. There is little risk of contracting rabies from a bat as long as you exercise caution. People cannot get rabies from touching bat droppings, blood or urine, or fur.\n\nFive to 10% of sick, injured, or dead bats tested by the Washington State Department of Health (WDH) have rabies; however, WDH estimates that probably less than 1% of the native wild bat population has rabies.\n\nIf a bat does contract rabies, it is unlikely to be a threat to humans as long as simple precautions are followed. Most bats infected with rabies become paralyzed and fall to the ground. (Note: Young bats also fall to the ground when learning to fly. They may also have hit a window and been stunned, or simply be cold and unable to fly.) This means a person may contract rabies from a bat only if they pick up a sick bat, which then bites the person in self-defense. Thus, if you do not handle bats, your odds of contracting rabies are extremely small.\n\nIf you think you have been bitten, scratched, or exposed to rabies via a bat:\n\nWash any wound or other area that came into contact with the bat thoroughly with soap and water.\n\nCapture or isolate the bat, if you can, without risking further contact. The captured bat will be sent to a laboratory for rabies testing.\n\nCall your doctor or local health department. An evaluation of the potential of rabies exposure and the need for follow-up treatment will be done. Arrangements to have the bat tested for rabies, if necessary, will also be made.\n\nPeople usually know when a bat has bitten them. However, because bats have small teeth and claws, the marks may be difficult to see. Contact your local health department or your doctor in the following situations, even in the absence of an obvious bite or scratch. In such cases, the bat should be captured for testing:\n\nA bat is found in a room with a sleeping person.\n\nA bat is found in a room with an unattended child.\n\nA bat is found near a child outside.\n\nA bat is found in a room with a person under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or who has another sensory or mental impairment.\n\nRabies and your pets\n\nOnce dogs presented the major domestic risk of rabies, but now cats do. Routine rabies vaccination is not as widely practiced with our domestic cats as with dogs. Yet cats often play or hunt in natural areas.\n\nAll cats should be vaccinated for rabies, even indoor cats. The National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians publishes the Compendium of Animal Rabies Control yearly. These guidelines are clear: An unvaccinated animal that comes in contact with a potentially rabid animal (bats in Washington) that cannot be tested should (1) be euthanized; or (2) be held in strict quarantine for six months. Few people are willing to do either.\n\nThe message for everyone is: vaccinate your pets! Dogs require vaccination against several diseases. Puppies begin their series of vaccinations at six to eight weeks of age, and annual boosters are necessary to maintain immunity.\n\nLegal status\n\nMany Washington bats are currently being studied and may be recommended for protection under the Endangered Species Act. For current legal status and other information, contact your local wildlife office."
