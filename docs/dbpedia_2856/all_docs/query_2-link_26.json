        "text": "Here’s what to expect when a student resident tests positive for COVID-19 while living in on-campus housing.\n\nResources, Expectations, and Protocol\n\nSince the initial shelter-in-place directives of 2020, with the partnership of several strategic campus teams, Housing Services has remained open continually and successfully maintained a COVID-19 response program that kept positivity rates low while providing a quality housing program for students living on campus.\n\nCurrently, student residents who test positive for COVID-19 should isolate in their campus housing room or, of course, they can choose to return home for the necessary quarantine period. It is important to keep in mind that campus housing residents who become sick with other illnesses, such as the flu or a cold, usually remain in shared rooms with their roommate(s) while recovering.\n\nCOVID-19 mitigation measures include:\n\nWearing a high-quality face covering at all times when around others (i.e. double layer surgical, N95, KN95, or KF94). This includes while in room if others are present, in hallways, stairwells, and in the bathroom.\n\nGetting meals to-go from the residential restaurants or a third party food delivery service, and not eating inside with other students.\n\nNot attending classes, labs, work, or other events or activities.\n\nRoommates at high risk of severe disease (per CDC criteria) can speak with a Housing Services representative about relocating to a temporary space until the infectious period of their roommate is over.\n\nHousing Services continues to provide appropriate cleaning/sanitizing practices in our communities, as well as access to sanitizing wipes, hand sanitizer, and high quality face coverings.\n\nIf you have questions about our isolation program, please do not hesitate to email us.\n\nEmail Us\n\nWhat Do I Do If I Test Positive?\n\nAll students who test positive must report their result to the University.\n\nIf you test positive using an at-home antigen test, please report your result in the COVID Screening Check.\n\nIf you receive a positive result through a campus-administered test, the result will be automatically reported.\n\nA campus representative will reach out by email within 24 hours with further details about isolation protocol.\n\nIsolate-in-place by staying in your room unless you need to go to the bathroom, get food, or evacuate for a building emergency.\n\nWear a high quality face covering (i.e. double surgical mask, N95, KN95, or KF94) at all times when you must leave your room or be around others.\n\nGuests are not permitted in your room. Only roommates may be in a room with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nYou are strongly encouraged to share the news with your roommate(s) and other close contacts, so that everyone can take appropriate precautions.\n\nA close contact is anyone who was in the same room (indoors) or vehicle with you for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period during your infectious period. The infectious period for COVID-19 starts two days before your symptoms appear (or two days before your positive test if you did not have symptoms) and continues until the end of your isolation.\n\nHow Do I Get Help?\n\nStudents who have severe symptoms (e.g. shortness of breath, chest pain, fainting, or a fever lasting more than three days) should seek help immediately by calling 911.\n\nFor milder symptoms, please stay home and rest. Students who are unvaccinated, or at high risk of severe disease, may benefit from a prompt prescription of Paxlovid or other medication, but a clinical visit is not required.\n\nStudents with COVID-19 who have questions or concerns about their health, and/or think they qualify for Paxlovid, can contact the Student Health Services Nurse Line 24/7 at (877) 351-3457. Students can also log into their patient portal or call (951) 827-3031 to schedule a telehealth appointment. If the clinician feels you need to come in for care, they will facilitate an in-person appointment for you.\n\nHow Do I Isolate-in-Place?\n\nDistance yourself from others as much as possible. When you are in your room, keep the windows open if outdoor conditions allow, and keep the room door closed.\n\nYou must wear a face covering if leaving your room or the building. If leaving the building, it is preferable to take the stairs.\n\nYou are permitted to briefly leave your room for the following reasons:\n\nTo use the bathroom. If possible, avoid high-traffic times and wash your hands as you enter and exit. Always keep your mask on unless you are brushing your teeth or taking a brief shower.\n\nTo pick up food. You must be masked at all times. You may request a to-go/sick meal for pick-up at a residential restaurant or may pick up a food delivery outside of your community after food is delivered by an off-campus restaurant or delivery service. You may eat your meal outside or in your room, but not inside any dining locations, indoor public space, or another student's room. If others eat outside with you, you should maintain physical distance. Do not eat in high traffic areas.\n\nTo use laundry facilities. Use the laundry facilities in your building only when absolutely necessary, and try to avoid peak times.\n\nTo attend a medical appointment.\n\nTo go outside for fresh air or a walk. Please wear a mask. Sit outside, away from others to get fresh air. Go for a walk alone.\n\nIf there is a building emergency.\n\nThe following are not permitted while you isolate-in-place:\n\nIf you are found doing any of the following activities during your isolation period, it will likely constitute a violation of the residential Conduct Policy and the UCR Code of Student Conduct.\n\nGo to in-person classes, labs, or workplaces\n\nEnter any campus building (excluding your residence hall, apartment building, or Student Health Services for timely or essential care)\n\nBe with others in groups.\n\nAttend group events such as religious services, outdoor concerts, or other gatherings that bring people together.\n\nUtilize any common areas in your residential building, including, but not limited to, fitness rooms, recreation facilities, lounges, kitchens, or study areas.\n\nUse public transport/rideshare services.\n\nHow Long Must I Isolate and When Can I Officially End Isolation?\n\nYou may end isolation and return to \"learning\" after five days following a positive test if you feel well, have improving symptoms, and have been fever free for 24 hours. However, you must still wear a mask until day 10.\n\nWear a high-quality, well-fitting mask at all times for the entire infectious period. Your mask should be on at all times in your room, unless you do not have a roommate. Ask a friend to obtain KN95/N95/KF94 masks for you at your Resident Services Office (RSO), if necessary.\n\nKeep your door to your room closed and windows open as much as possible.\n\nWhat Do I Do If My Roommate Tests Positive?\n\nIndoor masking is no longer required, but it is highly encouraged if your roommate tests positive.\n\nYou must monitor for symptoms and strictly adhere to campus COVID-19 precautions for 10 days from your last exposure.\n\nIf you are asymptomatic, you do not need to quarantine, regardless of your vaccination status. Instead, get tested 3-5 days after exposure, monitor your symptoms, and wear a face covering to help protect yourself and others.\n\nIf you develop symptoms, schedule a symptomatic testing appointment with Student Health Services.\n\nIf you are at high risk of severe disease, you may request a temporary move to an alternative housing location for the duration of your roommate’s infectious period.\n\nIf you witness a violation of the isolation protocols or the residential Conduct Policy, you are encouraged to either report this information to your RA or send an email to housinginfo@ucr.edu with identifying information. Residential Life staff will then submit a conduct report on your behalf. Reporting what you witness will help protect your fellow students and our community. After all, we are all in this together.\n\nHow Do I Get Food While in Isolation?\n\nIf you have a Dining Plan:\n\nRequest a to-go/sick meal online for any scheduled meal period.\n\nYou will be allowed to leave your room to retrieve a pre-requested to-go meal at the Lothian Residential Restaurant.\n\nYou are required to wear a mask when entering the residential restaurant.\n\nTell the cashier that you requested the to-go/sick meal option online.\n\nSwipe in as you normally would.\n\nYou may not dine within the facility.\n\nYou may eat outside or return to your room.\n\nIf you do not have a Dining Plan:\n\nYou may wear a mask and pick up a food delivery outside of your community after food is delivered by an off-campus restaurant or delivery service.\n\nUtilize the usual food storage and prep areas of your apartment.\n\nPartner with your apartment-mate(s) to create staggered meal times.\n\nWear a mask while in the kitchen area.\n\nEat your meal outside or go back to your room. Do not eat inside any dining locations, indoor public space, or another student's room. If others eat outside with you, you should maintain physical distance. Do not eat in high traffic areas."
