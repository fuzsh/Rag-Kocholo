        "text": "\"Frieda (nee Olp) and Emil Krupp Family Album\"\n\nFor optimum results, save image to hard drive, viewing through your graphics software of choice.\n\nUngroup for uncropped, individual pictures.\n\nEmil Karl Krupp\n\nBorn: 7-14-1906\n\nDied: 3-27-1995\n\nMarried: Frieda Olp on 12-23-1936 in Owatonna, MN.\n\nChurch: First St. John's Evangelical Lutheran (LCMS) now Redeemer Lutheran.\n\nWitnesses: Herman and Edna (Olp) Ballenthin\n\nFrieda Emelia Helena Olp (see below)\n\nBorn: 7-3-1904\n\nDied: 9-3-1993\n\nBoth are buried in Maple Lawn Cemetery, Faribault, Minnesota.\n\nChild: Shirley\n\nBorn: 8-01-1937\n\nDied: 6-11-2018\n\nGrandchildren: Julie, Steven, Lisa, Amy\n\nGreat-grandchildren: Hillary, Molly, Benjamin, Noah, Harlie, Houston, Emmy\n\nSources: Frieda Olp Krupp anniversary and funeral folders, as well as family remembrances.\n\nFrieda was born 7-14-1906 to Otto and Minnie (Zeise) Olp, the fourth of six daughters. The most mild mannered and soft spoken (despite her red hair) of her sisters, she was until her death, the closest to the fifth daughter, Edna. They literally travelled through life together. They left the home farm together, worked together, met and married German immigrants together, became godmothers to each others children (both having one child, girls). Their families vacationed together. When Edna lost her husband in her 40s, Frieda and Emil steadied life for Edna with her MS and teenage, godchild Sandy. As senior citizens, they comforted/encouraged/reassured each other. And they shared that their steadfast, dedicated faith would help them survive and enjoy anything in God's life plan.\n\nBefore her marriage in 1936, she was employed at the Pillsbury Academy in Owatonna, MN and then joined Edna working in the dining room at St. Mary's Hall School in Faribault, MN. Primarily Frieda was a homemaker - and proud of it. Her embroidered and handsewen gifts were anticipated each holiday and birthday. It was her calm voice and soft demeanor we cherished most. Her devotion and loyalty as a family member and friend were unparalleled.\n\nSister Dorothy's death 1975 at 73 yrs., 9 mos. from complications with her diabetes, made the Olp sisters grasp their mortalities. Ella's death in 1986 at 89 yrs., 4 mos., 9 days of a stroke, left Frieda and Edna the remaining sisters at Trinity, Faribault and living near each other. Frieda never learned to drive, nor did Ella; this did not keep them from connecting.\n\nShe lived a very full life. In 1986, Frieda and Emil celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary at Trinity Lutheran Church, Faribault, surrounded by family and friends. Daughter Shirley had three children, surrounding them with grandchildren. She and Emil travelled to Germany, visiting Emil's birth place, laying the groundwork for more visits and interaction between the Krupp descendants on two continents. She collected salt and pepper shakers from everywhere. They lived their entire married life in the same Faribault home at 1129 NW 3rd St., sharing their garden produce, active in their neighborhood.\n\nDuring her last years of failing health, the living sisters (Emma, Edna, Frieda, Alvera) closed ranks on their sisterhood. They spoke weekly, if not daily. The summer and fall of 1993 saw drastic decline in Emma and Frieda. Emma died July 16, 1993 at 94 yrs., 6 mos., 5 days; Frieda died Sept. 3rd at 89 yrs., 2 mos. The loss affect on Edna and Alvera was significant. As they listened to Rev. Steven Kuehne's sermon, \"The Prayer Of Faith\", they reflected on the faith walk and example of their mother, Emma Minna (Minnie) who had been baptized and confirmed at Trinity in 1872 and 1887 respectively. Rev. Kuehne spoke from James 5: 14-15, opening with these words......\n\n\"Today we will lay to rest in the ground the physical body of a faithful member of our congregation - a lady of faith. This is her Bible and she has written inside the front cover: \"From My Father.\" It was a special gift and a good gift, too, for it helped oour sister in Christ to grow in her faith, and as her eyesight dimmed, it gave her faith a special focus during the months of her suffering.\n\nThe Bible opens to one place with a worn blue paper to mark it and in Frieda's handwriting, this verse is noted: James 5: 14-15. We will use it as a word of reminder and encouragement for you today. This is how it reads: Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.\n\nOf course Frieda no longer needs the reminder or the encouragement of these words. Her soul has been ushered into that place with the Lord where there is no more sickness or crying or pain. But the words are instructive for us! And the same four things which the sick or ailing believer is encouraged to bear in mind in his suffering, we can well apply to those who are suffering from the pain of separation and grief caused by the death of our loved one.\"\n\nRev. Kuehne continued to offer encouragement and guidance to all those left to go on without our loving mother, grandmother, wife, aunt and friend.\n\nLovingly and respectfully,\n\nSandra Ballenthin Van Erp, godchild\n\n1972 cir. picture of Olp sisters"
