        "text": "H. C. FRIEDRICH BAASS\n\nHallettsville Herald\n\n14 Nov 1889, page 4\n\nAnother old land-mark gone. Frederick Bahs [sic.], an old and highly respected citizen of Lavaca county, died at his home near the Pagel settlement yesterday. Mr. Bahs was in the 60th year of his age and many years ago did all the surveying for this county. He leaves a wife and a large family of children. He was the first settler in the community known as the Pagel settlement.\n\nFriedrich Baass, 9 Dec 1821-13 Nov 1889, is buried in the Baass Cemetery. Contributed by Rox Ann Johnson.\n\nALOISIA BACA\n\nShiner Gazette, 23 Jun 1897\n\nSENSATIONAL SUICIDE.\n\nLouise Baca Kills Herself.\n\nA few minutes after 7 oâclock last Wednesday morning, George Baca rode furiously into town and reining up in front of Hahnke & Eschenburgâs store announced in grief stricken tones that his sister, Louise, had just killed herself by shooting herself in the forehead with a 32-calibre pistol. In a very few minutes the news had spread over town and friends of the family left at once for the scene of the tragedy. At the Baca home a heart rending scene presented itself. The other members of the family were gathering around the dead girl screaming and wailing. A tiny hole in the forehead just above the left eye showed where the fatal bullet had entered. The lips of the dead girl were parted and her face wore a peaceful expression as though she was sleeping. In life a beautiful girl â in the pallor of death she was fairer yet.\n\nJustice Blohm soon arrived on the scene and proceeded to hold an inquest of the body. A letter which Miss Baca had written a few minutes before her death was found. It was written in Bohemian, and left directions for her burial and stated that she wanted her share of the property divided among the other children. She said she wished to be dressed in white and buried in the family burying ground. She was twenty years old the day before her death.\n\nIt would be best if the GAZETTE could stop here and not speak of the causes that led up to this sad act, but it is due the dead that wrong impressions and reports be corrected. A paper in this county in speaking of the suicide last week stated that the cause was âUnrequitted [sic] Love.â This was not true. Tuesday night, June 15, the Baca family was terrorized by the threats of a rejected suitor for Miss Louiseâs hand, and at daylight she sought relief in death. This is the truth. On arising Wednesday morning Miss Baca had formed her fatal determination. Hastily writing the letter she laid it where it would be found, picked up the pistol, cocked it and seating herself on the side of the bed, placed the muzzle to her brow and pulled the trigger. At the report she fell back with the pistol clutched in her hand and never moved or spoke. The other members of the family had just seated themselves at the breakfast table when the shot was fired, and George ran in and caught up the pistol and threw it under the house.\n\nIqnaz [Ignaz] Baca died last fall, and Mrs. Baca, the mother, died several years ago. Since then the children have been running the farm. Amelia is the eldest, and the second daughter is Mrs. John Kaspar. Louisa was the third daughter. There is one still young, Ella. The boys are George, grown, and August and Henry, both young.\n\nThe funeral took place Thursday evening at the old family burying ground [Baca Cemetery].\n\nWeimar Mercury, 19 Jun 1897, page 8\n\nShiner, Texas, June 16.âMiss Louisa Baca, a beautiful young lady, 18 years of age, living one mile west of here, committed suicide by shooting herself through the head with a pistol at 6:30 this morning.\n\nShe left a note requesting to be buried near her father and mother at the family burying ground. She also stated what disposition to make of her share of the estate, but assigned no cause for her rash act.\n\nShe was a niece of Judge Haidusek of LaGrange.\n\nContributed by Matt Cross\n\nIGNAC BACA\n\nMoulton News, 25 Nov 1896\n\nPassed Away.\n\nIgnaz Baca died at his home a few miles from Shiner Wednesday evening at 3 oâclock of consumption. He had been in poor health for a long time and his death was not unexpected. His wife died two years ago. The deceased left seven children; three boys and four girls. His eldest daughter is Mrs. John Kaspar. Mr. Baca was 48 years of age. He moved to this country in 1866 and settled in Fayette county. From there he moved here about eight years ago and bought one hundred acres of land. This he improved until now it is a valuable place.\n\nMr. Baca was a man of thorough integrity and he was highly respected by all who knew him.\n\nShiner Gazette, 20 Jan 1897, page 1\n\nJudge Haidusek was here from LaGrange last week probating the will of his deceased brother-in-law, Mr. Baca, of Shiner vicinity.\n\nIgnac Baca is buried in the Baca Cemetery.

The interment will take place today on Mr. Bacaâs farm. Deceased was in her forty-fourth year and leaves a husband and several children.\n\nMrs. Baca was buried in the Baca Cemetery. Contributed by Matt Cross\n\nFRIEDRICH BAEDECKER\n\nShiner Gazette, 27 Jul 1893\n\nSuicide of Fritz Baedicker.\n\nThe towns of Moulton and Shiner were shocked Thursday, morning, to hear the Fritz Baedicker an industrious young farmer, living a couple of miles from Moulton; had committed suicide. The editor of the GAZETTE is indebted to Coroner T. F. Jackson of Moulton for assistance in gaining the details of the sad affair. Mr. Baedicker was in Shiner Tuesday and Wednesday and bought a heavy bill of lumber of the new lumber firm, Flato and Green. He intended building a house upon his land southeast of Shiner and was busy, Wednesday, hauling the lumber. Wednesday, eve he returned home and complained of feeling unwell and was unable to eat any supper. Thursday morning he still complained of feeling very unwell and Mrs. Baedicker with difficulty induced him to drink a little coffee. While out at the barn milking, she was started [sic] by the report of a gun and her little girl came running out crying, âO! Mamma,â Papa has killed himself.â On hastening to the house Mrs. Baediker was horrified to find her husband laying across the cot dead, with the walls and ceiling of the room splashed and spotted with his blood. He had placed the muzzel [sic] of a short gun, just under his ear and, forced the trigger with his foot, literally blowing the whole top of his head off. The room presented a dreadful spectacle, blood and brains were scattered every where and Mr. Baedickerâs features were so disfigured as to be unrecognizable. Coroner Jackson held an inquest, Thursday morning and the jury returned a verdict in accordance with the above facts. Mr. Baedicker was held in light-esteen [sic] where ever he was known and his friends are unable to assign any reasonable cause for his rash act. They are inclined that he was laboring under a temporary abevration [sic] of mind at the time, caused by ill health and long continued exposure to the sun on Tuesday and Wednesday. Mr. Baedicker was about thirty years old and leaves a wife and four small children.\n\nFriedrich BÃ¤decker, 8 Mai 1864 â 20 Jul 1893, was buried in the Witting Cemetery.

The remains were taken to Yoakum Saturday for interment. Mrs. Bagby is in a critical condition and we hope for her a speedy recovery.\n\nThe Bagby infant daughter, 8 Sep 1905 â 8 Sep 1905, was buried in the Oak Grove Cemetery.

Bagby, aged one year and ten months.âHerald.\n\nMrs. A. P. BAGBY\n\nWeimar Mercury, 10 Nov 1916\n\nWife of Prominent Texan Is Dead\n\nHalletsville, Tex., Nov. 5. â After an illness of several weeks, Mrs. A. P. Bagby, wife of General A. P. Bagby, died at her home here last night. She was 76 years of age and had been a resident of this place for many years. She is survived by her husband, two sons, W. T. Bagby, representative to the legislature from this county, and A. P. Bagby, Jr., state tax commissioner, and five daughters, Mrs. S. L. Bennett and Misses Mattie and Sallie Bagby of this place; Mrs. Dr. Gillette of Cuero, and Mrs. J. M. Cummings of Seymour. Interment took place this afternoon in the city cemetery.\n\nContributed by Matt Cross\n\nW. T. BAGBY\n\nEagle Lake Headlight, 3 May 1930\n\nW. T. BAGBY FUNERAL HELD AT HALLETTSVILLE\n\nThe body of W. T. Bagby, prominent for many years in courtrooms and on the political forum of South Texas, was brought to his home at Hallettsville on Thursday of last week for burial. Mr. Bagby died at Houston Wednesday night. Although he was only 55 years of age, Mr. Bagby had been in poor health for several years.\n\nBill Bagby as he had been know [sic] to two generations of State officials, who saw him first as a man of 30 with a voice that was full of music and deep-toned, stand on the floor of the House of Representatives and in the vigor of debate win the sobriquet, âthe Lion of Lavaca.â Mr. Bagby was a member of the Thirty-Second House of Representatives and continued in the Legislature through the Thirty-Fifth, when James E. Ferguson was impeached while Governor. He was one of the leaders among those friendly to the Governor and took a principalâs role in the debate.\n\nWhile Mr. Bagby was in the Legislature the 9:30 oâclock closing law was enacted and he was in a defending role against ultraprohibitionists, who would have made it more drastic. Although Governor O. B. Colquitt was an antiprohibitionist, he had agreed to the enactment of an early closing law and his supporters, including Mr. Bagby, were favorable to it.\n\nIn the Thirty-Third Legislature, which elected United States Senator Morris Sheppard for both the long term and a few-month tenure from which Joseph Weldon Bailey had resigned, Mr. Bagby was among those who made a spectacular and losing fight for election of Col. R. M. Johnston of Houston, who had been appointed to the place by Governor Colquitt.\n\nIn the last decade Mr. Bagby had served as member of the State Democratic executive committee sometimes as proxy, but always there was a demand for a debate that would bring his eloquence to play and his foes were great admirers of his powers of speech, as were his colleagues. The debates between Dwight Lewelling of Dallas and Mr. Bagby over questions involving prohibition were outstanding features of the Thirty-Third Legislature.\n\nAmong the survivors are his wife and a daughter, Mrs. Sam Duvall of Hallettsville; a brother, A. P. Bagby, of Austin, and a niece, Mrs. Fred J. Proctor of Dallas.\n\nContributed by Matt Cross\n\nKATHERINE ANN NESRSTA RIVERA BAILEY\n\nVictoria Advocate, 18 Sep 1969, page 12A\n\nMrs. Bailey\n\nHALLETTSVILLE â Mrs. Katherine Ann Bailey, 52 of Corpus Christi died at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday in a Houston hospital following a long illness.

C. Baird died here this morning from diptheria. His home has now been quarantined and every effort will be made to prevent the spreading of the disease.\n\nMuch uneasiness is felt, however, on account of the fact that other children of his yesterday were permitted to attend Sunday school.\n\nFor some time an occasional case of diphtheria has been developing in the Witting neighborhood, ten miles above here, but this is the first case here in nearly two years.\n\nWeimar Mercury, 17 Sep 1898, page 7\n\nAs soon as it became known there was a case of diptheria in town County health Physician Newbury went to work with a vim to prevent its spread, and he will no doubt succeed. The Baird premises have been thoroughly quarantined.\n\nJudge Paulus appointed Dr. A. A. Ledbetter special health officer to take charge of the case, he having already been called in consultation, and he is handling the matter satisfactorily. All the physicians of the city agree that the case that proved fatal was genuine dipththera. Since writing the above Dr. Baird's baby has been attacked with diphtheria and Dr. Ledbetter says it is a genuine case. We are assured, however, that there need be no alarm, as there is little chance for the disease to go any further.âHalletsville Herald.\n\nMRS.

Ballard, formerly of Sublime, at the depot with the corpse of his baby girl. Mr. Ballard moved from Sublime sometime last September with an invalid wife and several children to San Antonio, in hope of regaining health for his wife, but of no avail. She grew worse and died in May. He was then left alone in a great city without friends and very little money with two boys and two girls, all too young to be any assistance to him and it was hard to make ends meet, when a few days ago he was stricken with another blow by his youngest girl taking sick and although all was done that could have been done she died. He determined to return to his his home in Sublime and brought the reamins of his daughter with him. Mr. B. secured a hack and left with the corpse and his three chidlren and will bury the deceased near Sublime and will make that place his future home.\n\nALICE BALLARD\n\nShiner Gazette, 3 Aug 1904\n\nDeath of Mrs. Alice Ballard.\n\nMrs. Alice Ballard, wife of Judge James Ballard, of Halletsville, died on Sunday July 24th, after a few weeksâ illness. Mrs. Ballard was 60 years old and has been living in Texas since 1852.

BALLARD\n\nWeimar Mercury\n\n27 Aug 1898\n\nHallettsville, Tex., Aug. 23âCounty Judge Paulus was yesterday telephoned from Oakland that a man by the name of Ballard, who resided near Oakland, but in Lavaca county, was suffering from hydrophobia and needed attention. He at once sent Deputy Sheriff Rees to attend him, but was later telephoned that Ballard had died in great agony, and that the county would have to bury him.\n\nSeveral week since Ballard, who farmed on the place of B. Miller, had a terrible fight with a dog, which attacked and severely bit him before he could kill it with an axe. he then said he was afraid he would go mad and requested to be killed as soon as hydorphobia developed. After he became sick, people in the neighborhood were afraid of him, and yesterday requested the county authorities to take charge of him.\n\nSince Ballard was bitten several other people, including four small children, in almost the same neighborhood, were bitten, and although a madstone was procured and used by them, much uneasiness is now felt on their account.\n\nOAKLAND NEWS\n\nJohn W. Ballard, a workman on Ben Miller's farm two miles south of here, in Lavaca county, died from hydrophobia Monday night. He was bitten by a mad dog six weeks ago, and suffered intense agonies during his last few hours.\n\nWeimar Mercury, 3 Sep 1898, page 6\n\nBALLARD'S DEATH\n\nHalletsville, Texas, August 25. John W. Ballard, the man who died from hydrophobia in the upper part of this country, was a stranger and nothing of his previous life is known. He was woring on the farm of B. Miller as a day-laborer and lived in a cabin on the place, cooking for himself. He was about 37 years of age and a big, healthy man; he had tattooed on his left arm a Texas star with saber struck through a heart and on his right arm a United States flag, ship and anchor.\n\nAmong his effects was found a certificate showing that he had joined the Woodmen of the World order in Yoakum last January.\n\nWhile cooking his breakfast in the yard nine weeks ago he was attacked and severely bitten by a strange dog, which he caught and held until a neighbor came and killed it.\n\nLast Thursday he began to complain, but said he had chills and fever. A physician was called to see him and he was up and about his cabin until Monday, when he began to have spasms. A negro woman, who was waiting on him was told by him to leave the place, but she waited until he in a spasm grabbed her and tore fom her most of her clothes. Several people went near the house, but feared to go to him. He in his spasm broke up and threw out of the house most of its contents in the last spasm he fell out of the house and rolled some hundred yards into an ant-bed, where he died. Just before having the last spasm he wrote a note, which he waved at the parties who were watching near the house. The note said: \"Goodbye, darling Mollie; meet me in heaven.\"\n\nsame issue on page 7:\n\nHorrible Hydrophobia.\n\nJohn Ballard was an industrious farmer of the County Line or Wellersburg neighborhood. One day about two months ago while he was working in a field a stray dog came by and attacked him, biting him severely. Ballard caught the savage dog and held it, and the animal lacerated on of his hands fearfully. A man near by heard Ballard's cry for help and he killed the dog with an ax. The dog was promptly killed (a grave mistake) and Ballard's wounds healed rapidly. No evil results were apprehended, and the man resumed his work. Monday afternoon Ballard was picking cotton in the old Miller place north of Sublime, when suddenly those near him noticed he was acting strangely. He looked vicious and gave utterance to a sound that was like the growl of a dog. Without saying a word he started on a run across the field, and after running several hundred yards he fell dead, his features showing all horrible convulsions of hydrophgobia. The dog belonged to Will Dillard. Gus Miller killed the animal. This is another solemn warning to those who persist in having a lot of worthless dogs on their premises. âHalletsville Herald.\n\non same page:\n\nHallettsville, Texas, Aug. 24.\n\n. . . Ballard, the man who died from hydrophobia, was yesterday buried by the county. No one knows anything about him or his relatives.

H. BEAUMIER\n\nShiner Gazette, 9 Jan 1908\n\nEditor Beaumier Killed.\n\nShot By His Wife in Front of Herald Office.\n\nA terrible tragedy took place in Halletsville about 1 oâclock p. m. last Thursday, when Editor Beaumier of the Halletsville Herald was shot down without warning by his wife on the sidewalk in front of the Herald Office.\n\nThe tragedy has terribly shocked the people of Halletsville. Editor Beaumier has been in the employ of Mr. C. F. Lehmann, proprietor of the Herald, for the past six years as editor and manager of the publication. His administration has been marked by unusual success for the paper and popularity for himself. Mrs. Beaumier has at all times had a prominent part in the social life of the city, and with her husband attended an entertainment the night before the tragedy. It has long been surmised by the intimates of the couple that some shadow rested across their domestic life.\n\nOn the afternoon of the tragedy Mr. Beaumier, who had met the train, returned to the office. As he stepped to the sidewalk in front of the Herald building two shots rang out from an upper window of the building, and Beaumier fell dead, blood and brains spattering the sidewalk. Mrs. Beaumier descended the stairs with a long barreled pistol of 38-calibre in her hand, and remarked to Mr. Lehman: âThere he is, take care of him.â She walked unsupported to her residence a short distance away where a number of friends soon gathered and where bond for her appearance at an examining trial was arranged.\n\nMr. and Mr. Beaumier were married in Temple about 10 years ago. Three children, the youngest an infant, survive the union.\n\nHALLETSVILLE, Texas, Jan. 3. â There were no new developments today in the matter of the death of W. R. Beaumier. His brother, Lewis Beaumier, arrived here last night on the westbound âDavy Crockettâ and left again on the eastbound train about an hour later with the remains, which he took to Brenham for burial.\n\nMrs. Beaumier was placed under a $2000 bond pending examining trial set for next Tuesday and bond was signed by a number of business men. She is being tenderly cared for by friends.\n\nJ. W. and J. D. Leake of Navasota, her relatives, arrived last night, and today, Mrs. Duncan, a sister, who resides in Bartlett, also reached here.\n\nMrs. Beaumier has said very little, except that her husband had informed her âthat he had ceased to love her, and she could not give him up.â Her situation is a most pitiable one and the heartfelt sympathy of every one goes out to her and her three little now fatherless children.\n\nMr. Beaumier was well and favorably known as a newspaper man, had been engaged in that line of work in Brenham, Temple, Hempstead prior to coming here some six years since. While residing in Temple in 1898 he was married to Miss Nannie Thomas, who yesterday took his life. A more deplorable tragedy was never enacted, and it has cast a shadow over the entire community.\n\nShiner Gazette, 9 Jan 1908\n\nMrs. Beaumierâs Bond Fixed.\n\nOnly One Witness Testified, the Owner of the Halletsville Herald.\n\nHalletsville, Texas, Jan. 4. â Mrs. W. R. Beaumier was given an examining trial this afternoon and was placed under $2000 bail to await the action of the grand jury, which convenes on March 16. The only material witness placed on the stand was Mr. C. F. Lehman, proprietor of the Herald, of which Mr. Beaumier was editor and manager. Mr. Lehman stated that he was in the office when Mrs. Beaumier entered. He paid no attention to her, however, as it was not unusual for her to come there where her husband was employed and use the telephone. Mrs. Beaumier went upstairs, and soon after Mr. Lehman heard somebody remove the window sashes. He paid no attention to this, being engaged at his desk on the first floor. Some time afterward he saw Mr. Beaumier coming toward the office, and he soon heard the report of a shot. Thinking it was a firecracker, he merely looked through the glass door of the office when he saw Mr. Beaumier look up. He heard another shot instantly and Beaumier fell to the ground. He immediately ran out of the office to the sidewalk where Mr. Beaumier lay to see from where the shot came, when Mrs. Beaumier walked out with pistol in hand and told him to take charge of her husband. Mrs. Beaumier then walked to her home on the next block.\n\nThe examing [sic] trial was originally set for next Tuesday, but was changed to this afternoon. Mrs. Beaumier was represented by Gen. A. P. Bagby. She will leave this afternoon with her uncle, Mr. Leak, for Navasota, the home of Mr. Leak.\n\nWeimar Mercury, 11 Jan 1908, page 1\n\nThe deplorable tragedy at Hallettsville Thursday afternoon of last week, in which Editor W. R. Beaumier of the Hallettsville Herald was shot and killed by his wife, was a shock to the Mercury editor and to this community where the deceased visited recently on a prospecting trip. The cause of the tragedy is alleged to have been insane jealousy on the part of the wife. She was arrested, admitted the killing (particulars of which are given on another page of this issue), and at her examining trial was released under $2000 bond to await the action of the grand jury. Editor Beaumier was a genial, wholesouled man, a versatile business man and a natural friend-maker.Â His tragic death is deeply deplored. Considerable sympathy is felt at Hallettsville for Mrs. Beaumier, so we understand, many people feeling that her action was not without cause.\n\nShiner Gazette, 26 Mar 1908, page 1\n\nMrs. Beaumier Goes Free\n\nThe grand jury last Wednesday failed to find a bill against Mrs. Nannie Beaumier, charged in the murder of her husband.\n\nMrs. Beaumier came in from Navasota last week with her uncles, Messrs. Pipkin and J. W. LeaKe [sic], and is at the home of Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Miller. While it had previously been her earnest wish that a bill might be found so the cause could be settled once and for all, yet she expressed her gratitude at the grand juryâs action, believing that it was on the whole for the best. Mrs. Beaumier is not in the best of health, being quite nervous. She has decided to make her home in Navasota and will return there tomorrow. â Halletsville New Era.\n\nGazette articles contributed by Matt Cross.
