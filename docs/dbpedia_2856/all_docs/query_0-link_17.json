        "text": "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has made $175 million available through first-of-its-kind funding for new construction, acquisition, or rehabilitation of permanent supportive housing. Through one-time awards under the Continuum of Care (CoC) program, the CoCBuilds Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will enable communities to develop new units of rental housing with supportive services for people experiencing homelessness. Applications are due November 21, 2024.\n\nThe Best Starts for Kids Capacity Building Small Grant 2024 Request for Applications (RFA) is now open! This funding opportunity closes on Friday, August 16 at 2PM.\n\n*Important Note: This RFA is only open to currently-funded Best Starts providers.\n\nTo support the strength and sustainability of community-based organizations (CBOs), Best Starts Capacity Building program offers resources our partners identify they need to build organizational capacity. This RFA seeks to support the infrastructure needed to enhance CBOs’ capacity to provide services and programming. This includes systems, resources, and processes that sustain the key functions of an organization.\n\nGame On-Community Places to Play is an initiative of The DICK’s Sporting Goods Foundation and LISC. The initiative provides funding and technical assistance to community-rooted organizations working to create and renovate multi-use youth sport spaces for youth ages 6-24 years old in under-resourced communities across the country. Special consideration will be given to proposals that demonstrate how their capital projects will support youth development programming. Apply by Sept. 5.\n\nSometimes it can be challenging for partners who work in direct service to take a step back, reflect on their work, take a moment to rest, and reignite their passion for why they do the work they do. Having an intentional opportunity to connect with others can make all the difference when it's built into the workday.\n\nSixteen people representing 8 of our funded Place Based and Cultural Community partners got that opportunity when they attended the Community of Practice gathering April 16. They came away feeling connected, informed, and refreshed.\n\nIn its second year, the 2024 NextCycle WA Accelerator Academy is a capacity building opportunity for entrepreneurs committed to shifting supply chains, processes and business models to reduce waste, improve recycling, or find ways to reuse or remanufacture materials typically discarded as waste or trash. To create the conditions that support a just, sustained and strong shift towards a circular and generative economy and away from our current extractive systems, we need intention, collaboration, innovation and significant resources."
