        "text": "Reasonably priced . . .\n\nReasonably priced with a great breakfast and pleasant staff\n\nI stayed at the Marine Memorial Club and Hotel because it was most convenient to a work function. For a queen bed, I paid $250/night which I thought was very reasonable. It also came with complimentary breakfast each morning and a happy hour (full bar) each evening. The rooms were spacious for being downtown in a large city. I had a huge closet too. The bed was comfortable and the linens were great. There was a flat screen tv, coffee maker, a carafe to fill up with water (water filling station on each floor), a microwave and refrigerator. The room and bathroom were spotless. I did not make use of many of the amenities, but I did enjoy the happy hour each night and the breakfast. The breakfast was great. There was wait staff and it was definitely better than most hotel complimentary breakfasts. You actually get a choice of items from a menu. I had bacon, eggs, toast and hash browns the first day and the second day there was an extensive buffet. Juice and coffee came with it.\n\nThe location was great. I definitely felt save there. A few blocks away you started to see the impact of the drug epidemic, but it was not evident in the immediate area of the club. The recommended parking was next door at the Olympic club. There were also several restaurants right near by and shops within walking distance.\n\nThe staff were also very pleasant and helpful. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but it ended up being a great choice.\n\n– Kim R (Massachussetts)\n\n“I mean, WOW!”\n\nI mean, WOW! The service is unforgettable in this hotel. This might be a 3-star hotel but the service makes it feel like a 5-star. When you walk in you’re greeted by staff immediately after walking into their grand foyer. The place is packed with memorabilia and facts about our servicemen and women. They have upgraded some feature such as the elevator that will take you directly to your floor, no need to stop on different floors for other people to catch the elevator.\n\nThe rooms are nice. We had a corner room that gave us views on two sides of the room. The room also comes with robes that you can use during your visit. While the bathroom sinks seem to be newer, the showers could use an upgrade but they’re not bad. Room service comes everyday or when you request it and they do an excellent job.\n\nThere’s free breakfast which is not your typical continental breakfast, this was the real deal! Some days you order and are served and some days they have a buffet. Breakfast is served from 730-930 am. They have a daily happy hour from 4-6pm with very strong drinks! You can order just about anything.\n\nThis hotel is our go-to while staying in SF because we know that we’ll be treated kindly and have a nice clean place to rest. It’s also located in the middle of everything in Union Square and at the bottom of Nob Hill. If you’re up to it, you could walk the city from this location. – Jasmine W. (via Yelp)\n\nExcellent value near Union Square\n\nExcellent value, service and location. Convenient, secure parking nearby. Free hot buffet breakfast in a rooftop lounge (great city views) adds to the value, convenience and pleasure. No-brainer to stay here if attending an event in the Marines Memorial Theatre, which we did.\n\nMy wife and I had tickets to an event in the theatre, so staying at the hotel seemed like a good idea. The hotel recommends parking at the Olympic Club Garage, a half block away. It’s valet parking, but secure and convenient. I made an online reservation and was glad I did, because the parking was “full” when we arrived, but we could park with our reservation info (I printed it out, which aided check-in). The parking is a bit old school, with attendants running around to get cars. Olympic Club members also use the garage. It can get busy. Make sure your garage reservation times are what you need.\n\nOur clean and basic hotel room was perfectly good. Comfy king bed. Everything worked fine. The bathroom is tight and the shower a bit dated, but worked fine. Hotel staff was very nice. After the theatre event, we we able to fine late-night dining about 2 blocks away at the lively, excellent Japanese-sushi restaurant, Ryoko, on Taylor Street.\n\nNext morning, we loved the self-serve complimentary breakfast buffet: eggs, potatoes, burritos, grilled veggies, sausage, bacon, pasties, pancakes, yogurt, cereal, coffee, tea, etc. My GF wife was delighted to see yummy GF pastries and hot foods labeled GF. Lots of staff were around to check on tables, buffet, etc. A bonus was the outstanding 12th floor city view. A mix of old and new architecture.\n\nAfter breakfast (closes at 9:30 am), we appreciated the later noon check-out because it gave us ample time to walk around nearby Union Square and dip a little into Chinatown. We walked about a 6×6 block area, enjoying the holiday decorations and vibe.\n\nI’m a 60-year-old native of the Bay Area, visit SF frequently, and have stayed in 20+ SF hotels. This was one of the best hotel experiences I’ve had. Definitely will be back.\n\nHands down one of the best venues and hotels in the city!\n\nPosted on Yelp – My wife and I held our wedding reception, and had nothing but the most attentive and detail oriented service from Lisa Jimenez and Kiirsti Heon. Both were extremely flexible, communicated often and made this a stressful day for both the bride and groom. The Commandants Room is very spacious and daunting, but the MMC did amazing job setting a romantic atmosphere for our guest. The food? Devine. We choose the buffet to give our guest options, and each one of the sides and entrees were flavorful, fresh and perfectly seasoned. The staff working that night were responsive and extremely efficient. We stayed 3 nights at the hotel and were spoiled with fantastic amenities, attentive hotel staff and were minutes away from shops, restaurants and site-seeing locations in the city. Due to the height of surround buildings, there’s not much of a view from the room, but the hotel is decorated with pictures and monuments celebrating the service of Americans finest. Book your wedding here. It will not disappoint! ~ Marc G.\n\nBrilliant hotel\n\nWe’ve just had a 3 night stay at the Marines Memorial Club and Hotel and were very impressed. The hotel is in a great location to explore the city with public transport links close by. We stayed in room 512, they were spacious and clean rooms with everything you need including a safety deposit box. The bathroom was quite basic and could maybe do with a refurb. The beds are huge and incredibly comfortable. What was an added bonus was the daily happy hour from 4 until 6pm, where hotel guests can have complimentary beer, and selected wine and spirits. We took advantage of this throughout our stay. The breakfast has a good variety and it all tasted good, it was a buffet but they also provide table service. There is a good daily maid service and the WiFi speed worked well also. The staff on front desk were really friendly and on a couple of occasions gave us some smaller currency notes which was so handy. We paid £525 for 3 nights which I feel was very reasonably priced. I really don’t have anything bad to say about this hotel!\n\n– Laura (London, UK)\n\nOne of San Francisco’s Best Hidden Gems!\n\n10/18/2018 – I’m not ever sure where to begin with this review. My HUSBAND (still going to take some time to get used to saying that!) and I tied the knot at the Marine Memorial Club in the Commandant’s Ballroom on Saturday, October 13, 2018. The staff completely blew our vision and the entire event out of the water, and everyone was SO on top of it from the very beginning of the pre-planning to the final execution of the very last moment of the night– and even into the next morning when it was time to gather up everything to head out! It was perfect, to be honest. And coming from me, a total OCD, perfectionist Project Manager for a large commercial real estate firm– I definitely don’t use these words loosely! Our wedding was, without a doubt, the very best day of our lives. It was unbelievable. The entire team was so on point. Once the big day began, all my stressors that had built up over months and months of ironing out every single detail melted away. And they made it all seem so effortless.\n\nI couldn’t be happier that we picked the MMC as our wedding venue. We also love that it is such a beautiful hotel; we can’t wait to come stay again and reminisce. We’re going to try to stay for a couple nights for our one-year anniversary in October of 2019! So many of our guests voiced that it was “the best wedding they had ever been to”. I will be raving about the wedding and the MMC for years to come.\n\nI also want to personally recognize Lisa Jimenez and Kiirsti Heon, and pass along my sincere thanks and gratitude for all their help over the past year. I couldn’t have done it without them. They not only got things done quickly and efficiently, but with a smile and wonderfully positive attitude.\n\nThe MMC is one of San Francisco’s best hidden gems in my opinion, and I’ve lived here my entire life. I will most definitely be back to the Leatherneck Steakhouse for a nice dinner with my new husband, and can’t wait for our next stay in the hotel suite. THANK YOU ALL FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR LITTLE MARRIED HEARTS! 🙂 – Marisa + Johnny\n\nGreat Stay in SF\n\nI mean, WOW! The service is unforgettable in this hotel.

I got tested for COVID and was unfortunately positive, so had to isolate in my hotel room for 5 full days. The MMC staff was amazing in taking care of me:\n\n-They were so accommodating when I had to extend my stay.\n\n-They don’t do normally room service, but they brought me breakfast every morning from Chesty’s right on the time I scheduled with them.\n\n-They brought me extra waters and coffee everyday.\n\n-They were very supportive and emphatic with my situation, and told me repeatedly that they wanted to help as much as they could, and to just let them know if I need anything.\n\n-I had ordered Door Dash for most Lunches and Dinners, and the dasher couldn’t navigate to my room most of the time despite me putting my room number on the order. The MMC staff always stepped in and helped the dasher get the food to my room.\n\nThank you so much to the MMC staff for taking care of me during my isolation there. I really appreciate it!\n\n– Robert H"
