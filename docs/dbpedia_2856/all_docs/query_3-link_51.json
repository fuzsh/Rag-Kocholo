        "text": "TRENTON, N.J. -- A state appeals court refused Monday to grant a new trial to John Emil List, the quiet accountant convicted of killing his wife, children and mother after nearly 18 years as a fugitive.\n\nA three-judge panel also upheld the five consecutive life sentences imposed in 1990. List, now 67, is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison.\n\nList, a devout Lutheran and former Sunday school teacher, vanished for 17 years after shooting his family in 1971. He left the bodies of his wife and three teenagers laid out in the ballroom of his Victorian mansion, while his mother's body was in her third-floor apartment.\n\nHe had stopped deliveries of mail and milk and told people the family was going away to visit a sick relative.\n\nPolice, who entered the home after the family had been missing for a month, found a five-page letter to List's pastor, admitting the killings and saying he wanted to keep his children close to God.\n\nList's lawyers argued that the house was searched illegally without a warrant and that the letter was also protected by the priest-penitent relationship. But the appeals court disagreed, upholding the trial judge's ruling that List had abandoned his home.\n\n'The letter to the Rev. (Eugene) Rehwinkel, left for anyone to find and read, cannot be considered to have been made with a reasonable expectation of confidentiality,' the court said.\n\nList was arrested in 1989 in Richmond, Va., after the television show 'America's Most Wanted' ran a segment on the case. He had lived in Denver for many years under an assumed name, returning to his old profession and marrying a woman he met at a church picnic.\n\nHe was using the name Robert Clark, the name of a former classmate, when he was arrested.\n\nDuring the trial, List's lawyer argued that he was insane at the time of the killings, driven over the edge by financial problems, by the discovery that his wife had suffered from syphilis throughout their marriage and by his children's turning away from his strict religious beliefs.\n\nThe case inspired the horror movie 'The Stepfather,' made while List was still missing. A recent television movie on the case starred Robert Blake as List."
