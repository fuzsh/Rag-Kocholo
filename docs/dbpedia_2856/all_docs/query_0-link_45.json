        "text": "Parkway Tree Information\n\nAccording to Section 5.051 of the Code of General Ordinances, it is the duty of every property owner to improve and maintain the lawn park area abutting their property in conformance with the ordinance. This includes making sure that grass, trees and plantings are in a healthy condition and are trimmed so as to not constitute a public or private nuisance. Minimum clearances must be maintained; 8.5 feet over the sidewalk and 13.5 feet over the street are required. When trimming parkway trees, the Park Division allows homeowners to remove small limbs (1.5” in diameter or less) without a permit. Larger limbs require a forestry permit, issued at no cost by the City Forester (see link below).\n\nTree planting along streets in the parkway is regulated by the City of Kenosha Forestry Ordinance, Chapter 34. Property owners must request a forestry permit from the Park Division for tree planting (see link below). The City Forester may issue the permit and provide information on the number of trees possible, size requirements, spacing and species selection. Permits are free and come with pruning guidelines to assist property owners with proper techniques.\n\nClick here for a Forestry permit\n\nClick here for Forestry Fees and Charges\n\nClick here to view the City-Approved Parkway Tree List\n\nClick here to view Tree Pruning Guidelines\n\nClick here to view Tree Care Instructions\n\nWood Mulch\n\nWood mulch is available to City residents and property owners. Click here for more information.\n\nEmerald Ash Borer (EAB) Update\n\nOn August 10th, 2009, the Emerald Ash Borer was found in the City of Kenosha. Since then, the insect has been found in all sections of the City. The City of Kenosha has beenremoving all of the affected ash trees in lawn parks and on City property.\n\nKenosha has experimented with treating ash trees with chemicals to slow down the spread of this infestation. Whitecaps subdivision and a few other sections of the City with high percentages of young ash trees were targeted for this treatment. This treatment was intended to extend the window to fight this infestation by prolonging the time in which the City had to remove the affected trees. The City experienced mixed results with this treatment and decided that the results did not justify the cost.\n\nCurrently, the City is in the process of removing all of the 5,660 ash trees in City parks and right-of-ways. The following table illustrates the exponential spread of the EAB.\n\nYearTrees Removed 2009 20 2010 30 2011 50 2012 60 2013 180 2014 420 2015 550 2016 Estimate 700\n\nThe City is utilizing the wood from these ash trees to create commercial grade wood chips for our park playgrounds. Additionally, the City has begun the process of reforestation for Kenosha residents.\n\nHoliday Tree Information\n\nHoliday Tree Disposal\n\nHoliday trees may be dropped off inside the green snow-fenced enclosures at the locations listed below until January 31. Collected trees will be chipped and used as mulch in City parks. To prevent damage to chipping equipment, please remove all tree bags, ornaments, tree stands, nails and other metal objects and place in trash receptacles provided at each bin. Other holiday greenery (wreaths, garlands, etc.) must be placed with your normal residential trash collection.\n\nHoliday tree disposal locations: Click here for interactive map.\n\nCJ Clausen Park (6501 87th Avenue)\n\nColumbus Park (2003 54th Street)\n\nEndee Park (4401 47th Street)\n\nForest Park (4803 61st Street)\n\nHorizon Park (6598 112th Avenue)\n\nLincoln Park (6900 18th Avenue)\n\nNash Elementary School (6801 99th Avenue)\n\nPetretti Park (1903 16th Avenue)\n\nRoosevelt Park (6801 34th Avenue)\n\nSouthwest Library (7909 38th Avenue)\n\nStrawberry Creek (147th Avenue and 72nd Street, east of the golf clubhouse)\n\nSunnyside Park (8216 26th Avenue)\n\nSunrise Park (2829 50th Avenue)\n\nWashington Park (1901 Washington Road)\n\nWolfenbüttel Park (5901 3rd Avenue)\n\nCity Holiday Tree Donation\n\nEach year the City accepts a donated tree to be decorated and put on display near the Public Museum.
