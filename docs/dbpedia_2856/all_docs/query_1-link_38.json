If you are still subject to a mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine or isolation after those days are used, you may be eligible for a combination of Paid Family Leave and disability COVID-19 quarantine leave benefits.\n\nIf you work for an employer with between 11-99 employees as of January 1, 2020: Your employer is required to provide you with 5 days of paid COVID-19 sick leave.

The definition of “wages” in Article 6 of the Labor Law applies to the amount the employee must be paid. Employees who work a fixed schedule or are paid a salary should simply continue to receive pay for the applicable period. For hourly, part-time, commission-based salespeople, and other employees who are not paid a fixed wage, employers should determine the employee’s pay by looking at a representative period of time to set the employee’s average daily pay rate.\n\nHow many days of leave are part-time employees required to be paid for?\n\nPart-time employees should be paid for the number of days or work shifts during the period of quarantine that they would have otherwise been paid for, up to 5 or 14 days of paid time, depending on the size and income of the employer.\n\nIs the number of paid days work or calendar days?\n\nThe number of paid days are calendar days, and the pay required should represent the amount of money that the employee would have otherwise received during the period of quarantine, up to 5 or 14 days of paid time, depending on the size and income of the employer.\n\nWhen is payment required to be made to employees eligible to receive paid COVID-19 sick leave?\n\nThe paid COVID-19 sick leave payments are subject to the frequency of pay requirements of Section 191 of the Labor Law, and leave payments should be made in the paycheck for the applicable pay period for the leave.\n\nWill I have to repay the benefits I receive during COVID-19 quarantine leave?\n\nNo, you are not required to repay any benefits.\n\nIs there a waiting period before I will receive combined Paid Family Leave and disability COVID-19 quarantine leave benefits?\n\nNo, there is no waiting period for benefits claimed as a result of a mandatory or precautionary quarantine or order of isolation.\n\nCan my employer require me to use my existing sick leave accruals or other accruals (paid time off) before my COVID-19 quarantine leave?\n\nNo. Employers required to provide paid COVID-19 sick leave must provide that leave separate from any accruals.\n\nIs my job protected during COVID-19 quarantine leave?\n\nYes. Your employer cannot fire you or take action against you because you took leave, and you are entitled to be restored to the position you held prior to taking leave. Any COVID-19 quarantine leave should not be counted as an absence that may lead to or result in discipline, discharge, demotion, suspension, or any other adverse action.\n\nIf you feel you have been retaliated against due to your use of COVID-19 sick leave you may file a complaint with the Department of Labor at: https://forms.ny.gov/s3/Department-of-Labor-COVID-19-Complaint\n\nI am eligible to take COVID-19 quarantine leave for myself and COVID-19 quarantine leave for my minor dependent child.

You should complete the form package Request for COVID-19 Quarantine DB/PFL - Self (Forms PFL-1 & SCOVID19) to apply for the combined Paid Family Leave and disability COVID-19 quarantine leave benefits.\n\nIn January 2022, the Department of Health released updated guidance allowing individuals who have been exposed to COVID-19 to end their quarantine after 5 days if they are asymptomatic and subsequently test negative, or if it is not possible to get a test and they have had no COVID-19 symptoms. How does this affect NY’s COVID-19 quarantine leave benefits?\n\nNY’s COVID-19 quarantine leave benefits are only available during the order of quarantine or isolation. Once an individual is no longer subject to an order of quarantine or isolation, they are no longer eligible for NY’s COVID-19 quarantine leave benefits. See the Department of Health’s webpage New York State’s Approach to Isolation and Quarantine for the latest guidance.\n\nWhat if I independently decide to quarantine - can I take COVID-19 quarantine leave?\n\nThis new law provides benefits in cases where an individual is under an order of quarantine – either mandatory or precautionary. Entities that may issue an “order” include the State of New York, New York State Department of Health, local Board of Health or any government entity authorized to issue such order.\n\nMy child’s school is closed due to COVID-19. Can I take COVID-19 quarantine leave to stay home with them?\n\nSchool closures are not a qualifying reason for NY’s COVID-19 quarantine leave, as these benefits are only available when you or your minor dependent child are subject to a mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine or isolation issued by the State, department of health, local board of health, or government entity.\n\nI have been quarantined due to COVID-19. Do I have combined Paid Family Leave and disability COVID-19 quarantine leave benefits available?\n\nIf you are under a mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine or isolation issued by the State, department of health, local board of health, or government entity, you may be eligible to take combined Paid Family Leave and disability COVID-19 quarantine leave benefits for yourself unless you are not showing symptoms and are physically able to work through remote access or similar means. You must first use all available paid COVID-19 sick leave, then you can apply for the combined Paid Family Leave and disability benefits for the remainder of your quarantine.\n\nI’m able to work from home but I’m under a mandatory or precautionary quarantine. Am I eligible for COVID-19 quarantine leave?\n\nNo, if you are not showing symptoms and are physically able to work through remote access or similar means, you are not eligible for COVID-19 quarantine leave.\n\nDoes my citizenship or immigration status affect my eligibility for Paid Family Leave COVID-19 quarantine leave benefits?\n\nNo, citizenship or immigration status is not a factor in eligibility.\n\nWhat if my employer temporarily closes or goes out of business because of COVID-19?\n\nYou may be eligible for Unemployment Insurance. For more information or to apply online, visit the NYS Department of Labor website.\n\nAm I eligible for COVID-19 quarantine leave if my employer mandates I remain out of work due to exposure or potential exposure to COVID-19 but I am not under an order of quarantine or isolation?\n\nIf an employer mandates that an employee who is not otherwise subject to a mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine or isolation remain out of work due to exposure or potential exposure to COVID-19, regardless of whether the exposure was in the workplace, the employer must continue to pay the employee at the employee’s regular rate of pay until the employer permits the employee to return to work or the employee becomes subject to a mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine or isolation, at which time the employee shall receive COVID-19 quarantine leave as required by NY’s COVID-19 legislation, in accordance with the Department of Labor guidance, for the period of time the employee is subject to such mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine or isolation.\n\nIs there a limit to the number of times that an employee is eligible for COVID-19 sick leave?\n\nIn no event shall an employee qualify for sick leave under New York’s COVID-19 sick leave law for more than three orders of quarantine or isolation. The second and third orders must be based on a positive COVID-19 test and the employee must submit documentation from a licensed medical provider or testing facility attesting that the employee has tested positive for COVID-19. The employee does not need to submit documentation of a positive result if the employee’s employer gave the employee the test for COVID-19 that showed the positive result.\n\nAre health care workers exempt from COVID-19 quarantine leave?\n\nNo. Under New York’s COVID-19 quarantine leave law there is no exemption for health care workers. However, health care workers are subject to rules, regulations and guidance issued by the New York State Department of Health.
