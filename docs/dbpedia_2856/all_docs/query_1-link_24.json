HECK\n\nWeimar Mercury, Friday, July 6, 1951\n\nPreparing for Weimar Visit\n\nElectric Shock Kills Adamcik Son-in-Law\n\nA tragic accident at Houston last Friday morning turned what was to have been a happy weekend into one of shock and saddness for the Wm. Adamcik family of Dubina. Their son-in-law, Paul J. Heck, 43, of Houston, was getting the family car ready to come to Weimar when a shorted electric buffer electrocuted him.\n\nMr. Heck, a West University Place, a boiler engineer, was using the electric buffer to polish his car at his home at 3003 Tennyson Street. It was the first day of his vacation from his job with the American Rice Growers Association. His vacation was to last until July 16, and he and his family planned to begin it by attending the Dubina church feast and visiting the Adamciks. From here they had planned to go to Corpus Christi.\n\nHe washed his car on the grass in his front yard before starting to polish it.\n\nWest University Chief of Police Harold E. Skipp said Mr. Heck was barefooted and on wet grass, and the buffer apparently shorted. Mr. Heck screamed and attracted neighbors, who called the police and the fire department.\n\nThe fire department's emergency squad found Mr. Heck on his back beside his car, still holding the buffer, when it arrived. Chief Shipp said Capt. John D. Allstett of the emergency squad unplugged the buffer cord and received a shock in doing so. The emergency squad tried to revive Mr. Heck for about 20 minutes.\n\nThe body was taken to the Pat H. Foley & Co. Funeral Home, and later brought here. Funeral services were held Monday from Hubbard Funeral Home here and the Catholic Church at Dubina, with interment in the Dubina cemetery.\n\nMr. Heck's survivors include his widow and two daughters, Patsy Heck, 16, and Miss Betty Heck, 19, none of whom were at home when the accident occurred.\n\nSubmitted by Rosemary Ermis\n\nHEIMANN INFANT\n\nWeimar Mercury, September 23, 1893\n\nLaGrange Journal: Died, at the family residence, near Swiss Alp, September 20, 1893, the infant daughter of Prof. and Mrs. E.

Contributed by Kathy Carter\n\nAUGUST HEINTZE, Sr.\n\nLa Grange Journal, July 5, 1923\n\nWhen friends of the family were advised Saturday morning that August Heintze had been claimed by death, they could not give credence thereto, because of the fact that Mr. Heintze had entertained several the morning previous and had maintained his usual jolly disposition with them. It is true, acting under advice of his physician, he had not sought to become active in the affairs of the business with which he was so long connected, or to be associated, actively with some of the movements that had for their aim, the general advancement of the community of La Grange. Yet there was an interest manifested, and his counsel was not sought without results. The announcement of his departure was, however, only too true; he became ill suddenly at eleven o’clock on Friday night, and at three-thirty Saturday morning, the struggle ended, he passed to his reward, maintaining consciousness until the last breath was from out of his nostrils. Another good citizen, one whom all La Grange had loved, had entered upon the last journey.\n\nSaturday, all forenoon and afternoon, and on Sunday, there came to his bier, besides his relatives, friends from every part of the city and of the county. He had sent greetings to the friends in other parts, in the neighboring sections, as the messengers departed for Shiner Friday, and these greeting had been received with pleasure; the next morning the same friends had been advised that August Heintze had departed. As the friends looked with dim eyes and saddened hearts upon the quiet, calm face of one who had befriended them, they proclaimed his fidelity to the little city in which he had made his home and to them, in the course of their career. Of August Heintze it can be said that the greatest pleasure he derived, in addition to that of being with his family, was to have his friends with him, and this especially applied to those who had passed through the years when the struggles of life seemed the greatest. As the editor recalls, while this is being written, August Heintze was a man with wonderful disposition [illegible] sympathy with the afflicted, and after the manner born, a man who ever had at his command, the moment when he could have social intercourse with his fellow man.\n\nMr. Heintze had a hobbyâif it can be so calledâand that hobby was to collect curios and museum relics. He began this manner of collecting interesting relics; such relics as were connected with the history of this country, and of the foreign countries, when still a boy. His collections grew to such proportions that it was soon known as the Heintze Museum. It was referred to by intelligent men in every section of Texas, and in other states, and he [illegible] from a distance, believed that a visit to La Grange was complete without having visited the founder and his magnificent collection. His being of a philanthropic nature, Mr. Heintze essayed to create interest among some of the educational institutions of Texas, to induce them to take over this museum, but the worth of this vast collection was either not recognized or the public was insufficiently interested. Only recently, when the school bond election, called for the purpose of determining whether the people of this district desired a new school building, he was one of the most enthusiastic supporters, but, because of his enfeebled condition, could not take active work in the campaign. He encouraged the hope, however, that in some manner his collection would become part of the school’s interior holdings.\n\nAs a friend, we bid him rest in [illegible] sod press lightly upon his pulse less breast, and may the journey he has entered upon, end happily, and he reach the destination that all honorable men are seeking and eventually find. There he can await the coming of those who will someday follow; he leaves a widow, one son, A.J. Heintze, a sister in Germany, many family relatives to mourn his going. With these grieve many friends in La Grange and elsewhere.\n\nAugust Heintze was born in Kappeln, Schleswig, Germany, and was educated by a private tutor. He received his commercial training in Flensburg and Hamburg in large manufacturing establishments. He remained in Germany until after the Franco-Prussian war, of which he was a veteran, and emigrated to America in the year 1873. After a brief business career on the Rio Grande border he came to Fayette County and engaged in business at Warrenton. In 1878, he was united in marriage with Miss Johanna Speckels, a daughter of John Speckels, Sr. of the Warrenton section, and to them was born the son who now survives him. In the year 1883 he removed to La Grange and engaged in the mercantile business, and since that date has been identified with business interests in La Grange. One of the greatest pleasures to him was to regularly arrange for the annual Fourth of July celebration out at his former home, and whenever a celebration of a like nature occurred here, the name of August Heintze was associated with the movement and evidence given by some entry of a complementary nature. Could his friends’ wish have been granted at this time, he would have been with us today and have witnessed the celebration now in progress. “Man proposes and God disposes.”\n\nSunday afternoon they carried his remains out to the new cemetery and placed them in the earthen couch. The attendance was very large and sympathetic tears were mingled with those tears of grief on the part of his [illegible] decked with a profusion of beautiful flowers. Rev. R. Heise, pastor of the St. Paul Lutheran church, officiated at the home and the grave. He was 79 years of age.\n\nAugust Heintze, Sr. was born 30 Dec 1850 and died 30 Jun 1923.

J. von Rosenberg, died at the La Grange Hospital early Tuesday morning.Â Just one week prior to her departure, Mrs. Hellmuth submitted to a serious surgical operation and gave every indication that she would soon be restored to good health, and enabled to go back to the home she had left at Waco, to be near her relatives.Â All went well; suddenly intestinal flu developed and with all constant and good attention, she drifted into the last sleep.\n\nThe funeral was held Wednesday afternoon at three oâclock, with interment at the new cemetery.Â Attesting the high esteem in which the deceased and her family were held, was the presence of many friends from here and elsewhere.\n\nMrs. Hellmuth was reared to womanhood here in La Grange; it seems as Fate decreed that she should come here to end her journey.Â Giving every indication of good health, barring the affliction that necessitated the surgical operation, she submitted with smiling willingness.Â It is also another chapter of Fateâs decree, that she should not be granted her wish for a speedy recovery.Â She leaves a husband, one grown daughter, her parents, two sisters, and other relatives.\n\nOur sympathy is offered to the husband and the other relatives; words thus expressed give the assurance that they do not grieve alone, but they do not remove that pang which only Time alleviates.Â We realize the loss that has come to them, and grieve with them.Â And with the extending of our sympathy refer to her death as being the going of a good and noble woman.Â Peace be with her!\n\nContributed by Rob Brown.

She had not a thought that was not a gentle one, not one that did nor [sic] hold all the world in the arms of its kindliness. She was sorely needed here. She was the light of the eyes of a great company of relatives and friends, and the light has now gone out. To them she was what the sunshine is to the world, and this eclipse to them brings both darkness and chill.\n\nHer funeral will be pathetic beyond expression, for not one, as the last good-byes shall be said, but will feel that a total loss has been sustained for which there is no compensation.\n\nMay time bring its resignation, and may the shores of eternity that receives her soul, surround it with everlasting sunshine and flowers.\n\nVainly groping after the Infinite meanings we cry: Why should so precious, so necessary a life be taken?

This young lady, daughter of Mrs. Alwine Herder of that city, was 18 years old in December last. She was taken ill some nine weeks ago, and although everything possible was done for her, the skill of the best physicians was baffled. An operation was performed Saturday last in the hopes of prolonging the life of this estimable and lovable young lady, but it proved unavailing. Her death occurred at 3 o’clock Wednesday morning and the funeral will take place at High Hill cemetery this (Thursday) a[t] 3 o’clock. It was our good fortune to know this young lady, who visited our city often in days gone by, the guest of her aunt, Mrs. F. J. Nitschmann, and we esteemed her highly for her friendly disposition, ladylike deportment, and general worth. Few girls possessed such a lovable character as did this girl, and wherever she went she always drew around her a large circle of friends. She was to have been married last month to a most worthy young man of Schulenburg, but on account of her illness the ceremony was deferred. To the bereaved mother, grandparents, relatives and friends the heartfelt sympathy of the writer who recently passed through just such bereavement, is extended. God comfort and console them, is our heartfelt prayer.\n\nSchulenburg Sticker, 3 June 1909\n\nMISS ADELE HERDER LAID TO REST.\n\nA large concourse of grife striken [sic] relatives and sorrowing friends followed all that was mortal of Miss Adele Herder to the last resting place in the High Hill cemetery Thursday afternoon last to pay their last sad respects to the beloved dead.\n\nThe funeral services were conducted in the German language by Rev. Kern of Swiss Alp.\n\nBeautiful songs were rendered at the grave by members of the Sunday schools and the Liederkranz.\n\nThe floral offerings entirely covered the grave and was most beautiful. Twelve of her young men friends acted as pall bearers.\n\nMiss Adele’s illness was of a peculiar nature, baffling the skill of the best doctors. She fought for life for nine long weeks, but He Who doeth all things well called her to Him.\n\nNone but those who have sat in the shadow of a great bereavement can justly weigh such sorrow as this. Those who have gone down in the valley of suffering and stood for months by the side of a loved one, as hope after hope dropped away as the petals fall from a faded flower, know that such anguish can not find solace in the tenderest words. Yet the loved ones left behind can be comforted by the assurance that their granddaughter, daughter, sister and sweetheart is in that land where there is no sorrow nor pain.\n\nDeceased is survived by her grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Hahnke, mother, Mrs. Alwine Herder, two sisters, Mrs. Hester Streitch of Halletsville and Miss Minnie and three brothers, Henry, Gus and Albert to whom our sincerest sympathy is extended.\n\nContributed by Matt Cross\n\nALBERT HERDER\n\nSchulenburg Sticker, 6 Jan 1922, page 1\n\nAlbert Herder Dies Very Suddenly At Sugar Land\n\nThe remains of Albert Herder, a former citizen of this city whose death occured [sic] in Sugar Land Saturday morning at four o’clock arrived here last Sunday afternoon on the 3:30 p. m. train, and were conveyed to the Adolph Hahnke home.\n\nNews of the death of Albert Herder, after a very brief illness, reached his relatives and a host of friends in Schulenburg early Saturday with a staggering shock.

EDMUND HERZIK.\n\nMr. Edmund Herzik died at his home in Engle on Tuesday, July 12th, 1904 at 4 p. m. The deceased was born at High Hill, Fayette county, Texas, on November 3rd, 1876. He was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Herzik, sr. At the age of 18 he attended the St. Louis College at San Antonio, and at the age of 19 he began teaching the Dubina school at Dubina, where he taught for three terms. In the year of 1899 he and his brother, Alfonse, started a lumber business. In 1900 he was elected as teacher and principal of the Engle school which he held for three terms, and in the meantime was connected as partner in the lumber business, which he purchased from his brother this year, and during this short time he conducted a successful lumber business up to his death.\n\nMr. Edmund Herzik was married to Miss Minnie Herder of Weimar, Texas, on November 19th, 1901, and he is survived by a wife and one little girl, nine brothers and two sisters, to whom the hearts of our people go out to in sympathy. His death was caused by heart failure and was very sudden. His remains were laid to rest in the city cemetery at Schulenburg under the auspices of the local lodges, Fruatisek [sic] Polacky No. 21, S. P. J. S. T., and Engle Woodmen of the World, both of which he was a valued and worthy member. He was also a member of the Asveta Theatre Company, of which he was one of the first organizers. The club loses an honorable and respectable member and actor. The entire community has been stricken with grief. All day Tuesday and Wednesday, until the coffin lid hid forever from earthly sight the earnest face of the dead man, men, women and children in all the walks of life filed into the room where lay his remains, to look for the last time upon the face they knew as a child and loved and honored as a man.\n\nThe funeral, which took place Wednesday afternoon, was one of the largest ever before witnessed in our little city. The services were conducted under the auspices of the S. P. J. S. T. and Engle Woodmen and Rev. Baumfalk of Freyburg. The floral decorations were numerous being offerings from loving friends in all walks of life. As the closing remarks of Rev. Baumfalk were made and the heart boken [sic] widow’s eyes were moistened with tears, friends and relatives gazed on the grave as it was covered with the choicest flowers of the season.\n\nThe writer loses a bosom friend and schoolmate, and his family and friends a warm hearted and lovable companion, one whose place cannot be easily filled, for he possessed a genial disposition and a kindness of heart that shed a halo of sunshine upon all around him. The effect of such a loss is better imagined than described for the pangs of sorrow are great. The writer sympathizes deeply with the young widow, but is somewhat consoled in the belief that he is now in that sweet sleep where trouble comes to no one, and where trouble his spirit will dwell in happiness.
