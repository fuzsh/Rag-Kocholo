I need no other argument,\n\nI need no other plea;\n\nIt is enough that Jesus died,\n\nAnd that He died for me.\n\n2\n\nEnough for me that Jesus saves,\n\nThis ends my fear and doubt;\n\nA sinful soul I come to Him,\n\nHe’ll never cast me out. I need no other argument,\n\nI need no other plea;\n\nIt is enough that Jesus died,\n\nAnd that He died for me.\n\n3\n\nMy heart is leaning on the Word,\n\nThe written Word of God,\n\nSalvation by my Savior’s name,\n\nSalvation through His blood. I need no other argument,\n\nI need no other plea;\n\nIt is enough that Jesus died,\n\nAnd that He died for me."
