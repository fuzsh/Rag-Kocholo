        "text": "Employers must provide each employee earned sick leave. Employees must accrue no less than one (1) hour of earned sick leave for every thirty (30) hours worked within the geographic boundaries of the City; employers may cap the total accrual of sick leave at eighty (80) hours. Any unused accrued earned sick leave must be carried forward to the following benefit year.\n\nEmployers may satisfy the accrual and carry over requirements if no less than forty (40) hours of earned sick leave are awarded to an employee at the beginning of each benefit year. Employers may limit an employee's use of earned sick leave to forty (40) hours in a benefit year. Employees may use earned sick leave for all the reasons described in Section 39.0106(a), which includes, but is not limited to, time for their own medical care or for the medical care of a family member.\n\nIf an employer provides, through a contract, collective bargaining agreement, employment benefit plan or other agreement, greater paid time off than the employee would have otherwise received under the provisions of the Ordinance, that employer may utilize an alternative methodology for calculation, payment and use of earned sick leave or paid time off.\n\nImportant Notice Regarding Senate Bill 616\n\nEmployers must post in a conspicuous place at any workplace or job site where any employee works, the notices published each year by the City. Additionally, every employer must also provide each employee, at the time of hire or by Oct. 1, 2016, whichever is later, written notice of the employer's legal name, any fictitious business name, address, telephone number, the employer's requirements under the Ordinance, information on how the employer satisfies these requirements including the employer's method of earned sick leave accrual. This notice may be provided through an accessible electronic communication in lieu of a paper notice. To satisfy this requirement, employers may use the City prepared Employer to Employee Notice Template.\n\nMinimum Wage NoticeEnglishSpanishChineseVietnameseTagalogEarned Sick\n\nLeave NoticeEnglishSpanishChineseVietnameseTagalogEmployer to Employee\n\nNotice TemplateEnglishSpanishChineseVietnameseTagalog\n\nInvestigations may be initiated based off complaints, including formal complaints, tips or anonymous information received and from the Program’s Directed Investigation annual workplan.\n\nComplaint-based Investigations\n\nIf an employee believes their rights under the Earned Sick Leave and Minimum Wage Ordinance have been violated, a complaint can be filed with the City of San Diego Minimum Wage Program by completing a Complaint Declaration Form or by clicking here. The form is available below in various languages. Employees can also contact the Minimum Wage Program to obtain a hard copy of the Complaint Declaration Form.\n\nComplaint Declaration FormEnglishSpanishChineseVietnameseTagalog\n\nIf additional information is needed, the employee/complainant will be contacted prior to any investigation. Anonymous complaints, tips or other information regarding potential violations of the Ordinance can also be submitted.\n\nIn accordance with the Earned Sick Leave and Minimum Wage Ordinance section 39.0113(a), the Enforcement Office has promulgated and issued the following regulation(s):\n\nCDC Rule for Earned Sick Leave\n\nNote: Employees have the right to bring a cause of action against their employer in court or file a claim with the California Labor Commissioner’s Office for violations of the City of San Diego Ordinance minimum wage and retaliation requirements. Other California Labor law violations, including overtime and meal/rest breaks, can also be filed with the California Labor Commissioner’s Office. Information regarding these processes and how to file claims can be found at the state of California Department of Industrial Relations webpage.\n\nDirected Investigations\n\nDirected investigations are intended to assist vulnerable, low income employees working in industries where data shows violations are likely to occur, and the workforce is unlikely to file complaints. Even though a complaint was not received, businesses selected for a directed investigation are still required to abide by the Ordinance pertaining to their requirements during the enforcement process.\n\nFor more information regarding the investigations process, employers can review the Guide to the Investigation Process or contact the Investigator assigned."
