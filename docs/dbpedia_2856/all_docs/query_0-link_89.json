        "text": "Influenza viruses cause flu. The viruses spread from person to person when infected people cough, sneeze or touch objects. Flu can be mild or severe and can even cause death. Older people, children under 5 (especially children under 2), pregnant women and people with certain health conditions are at a higher risk for serious complications from the flu.\n\nFlu season usually begins in December and lasts until April or May in the U.S.\n\nDuring the 2022–2023 flu season, at least 106 children died from flu and flu-associated illness in the U.S. Most of these children had not received a flu vaccination. Thousands more children were hospitalized.\n\nWhat is the best way to prevent the flu?\n\nFlu vaccination is the best way to prevent flu infection. All people 6 months and older should get the flu vaccine each year. Healthy children over 2 may get either the shot or the nasal spray vaccine. Your child’s doctor can help you choose the best option for your child.\n\nIt’s especially important to get the flu vaccine this season so the healthcare system isn’t overloaded if there are more surges of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID-19.\n\nFor most people, it's best to get the flu vaccine in September or October, but it’s never too late to get the vaccine at any point in the season.\n\nWhere can my family get a flu shot?\n\nCall your doctor, nurse, or clinic.\n\nCheck the Flu Vaccine Finder.\n\nContact your local health department.\n\nCall the Help Me Grow Washington Hotline at 800-322-2588.\n\nVisit Flu Vaccination for Seattle Children’s Patients and Families to learn who can get flu vaccine at Seattle Children’s.\n\nHow many doses of vaccine will my child need for the 2023–2024 flu season?\n\nChildren 6 months through 8 years of age should receive two doses if this is the first time they’re getting a flu vaccine. The doses are given four weeks apart. If your child needs two doses, get the first dose as soon as it’s available.\n\nChildren 9 and older, and children who have received two or more doses in the past only need one dose this flu season.\n\nAsk your child’s healthcare provider if you have any questions.\n\nHow else can I prevent the spread of flu?\n\nWash your own and your child’s hands often with soap and warm water. Children should sing their ABCs twice in a row while washing their hands to ensure the proper length of time. Use alcohol-based hand cleansers when soap and water are not available. Learn more about handwashing.\n\nThe social distancing and masking efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 also help reduce spread of the flu. You may choose to wear a mask when in public and when around people you don’t live with.\n\nAvoid people who are sick.\n\nPeople with the flu should stay home from work or school. They should stay home while they are sick and for at least one day after they no longer have a fever, without the use of fever-reducing medicines. Learn more about flu symptoms and care advice.\n\nCover noses and mouths when coughing or sneezing: use tissue or the crook of your elbow when you cough or sneeze and throw the tissue away in a covered trash bin.\n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Remind children to keep their hands away from their face to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth.\n\nClean surfaces often, including toys, doorknobs, phone receivers, keyboards and tables.\n\nAvoid sharing personal items such as forks, spoons, toothbrushes and towels.\n\nThe single best way to prevent the flu is to get the vaccine every flu season.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of the flu?\n\nFlu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Some people also have diarrhea and vomiting. Flu symptoms can last as little as one day or longer than a week. It varies from child to child.\n\nFor help deciding if your child has the flu, visit:\n\nFlu Symptoms and Care Advice\n\nThe Sick Day Guessing Game: Cold or Flu?\n\nSimilarities and Differences Between Flu and COVID-19 from the CDC (Spanish)\n\nWhen should I take my child to the doctor or go to the hospital?\n\nMost people with the flu do not require medical care.\n\nVisit flu symptoms and care advice to learn more about when to call 911, when to call your doctor and when to treat the flu at home.\n\nIf your child has flu symptoms, especially if they are under 5 years, you can call their doctor to help decide whether or not they need to be seen in the clinic or hospital.\n\nWhat if my child has a chronic health condition and the flu?\n\nChildren with chronic health conditions, like heart or lung disease, diabetes, asthma, a neurodevelopmental condition or a neuromuscular disorder can get very sick from the flu. If your child has a chronic health condition and has flu symptoms, call your child's doctor. Your child may need to be tested and treated for the flu. Your child should also get the seasonal flu vaccine. Learn more about flu and children with chronic health conditions.\n\nHow do I treat my child's flu at home?\n\nMake sure that your child drinks plenty of fluids.\n\nHave your child rest and do quiet activities. Check Activities for Children Sick at Home for ideas.\n\nIf your child is uncomfortable because of a fever, you can give acetaminophen (Tylenol) if your child is over 3 months old. Or, you can give ibuprofen (Motrin) if your child is over 6 months old. Make sure to give the correct dose, based on your child's weight, using the measuring tool that came with the medicine.\n\nNever give your child aspirin.\n\nDo not give multiple-symptom cough and cold medicine to children under 6 years.\n\nEncourage everyone at home to clean their hands often.\n\nKeep your child home while they are sick and for at least one day after they no longer have a fever without the use of fever-reducing medicines. Check with your doctor if your child has the flu and close contacts at home are pregnant, are young infants, are elderly, have a suppressed immune system or have a chronic medical condition.\n\nMore About the Flu\n\nPrevent Seasonal Flu from the CDC (Spanish)\n\nInformation for the 2023-2024 Flu Season from the CDC (Spanish)\n\nSeasonal Flu Vaccines from the CDC (Spanish)\n\nMisconceptions about Seasonal Flu and Flu Vaccines from the CDC (Spanish)\n\nWho Needs a Flu Vaccine from the CDC (Spanish)\n\nWhich Flu Vaccine Should Children Get from the American Academy of Pediatrics (Spanish)\n\nKey Facts about Seasonal Flu Vaccine from the CDC (Spanish)\n\nDr. Livewell: You Versus the Flu (Comic for Kids) (PDF)\n\nFamilies Fighting Flu: The Story of Joseph Marotta (Video)\n\nFlu News and Spotlights from CDC (Spanish)\n\nQuestions and Answers about Flu from the Washington State Department of Health (Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Vietnamese)\n\nInfluenza from Public Health – Seattle & King County (Chinese, Korean, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Vietnamese)\n\nInformation updated: September 20, 2023"
