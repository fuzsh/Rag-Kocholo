        "text": "About the Species\n\nYoung Hawaiian monk seal underwater in Pearl and Hermes Reef in Hawaii. Credit: NOAA Fisheries Hawaiian monk seal research program.\n\nThe Hawaiian monk seal is one of the most endangered seal species in the world. The population overall had been declining for six decades and current numbers, though increasing, are only about one-third of historic population levels. Importantly, however, the current upward trend is in part due to NOAA Fisheries recovery efforts.\n\nHawaiian monk seals are found in the Hawaiian archipelago which includes both the main and Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and rarely at Johnston Atoll which lies nearly 1,000 miles southwest of Hawai'i. These monk seals are endemic to these islands, occurring nowhere else in the world. Hawaiian monk seals are protected under the Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and State of Hawai'i law.\n\nThe Hawaiian monk seal is one of NOAA Fisheries' Species in the Spotlight.\n\nGet monk seal updates and \"pupdates\"\n\nPopulation Status\n\nThe population is estimated to be around 1,600 seals—nearly 1,200 seals in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and 400 seals in the main Hawaiian Islands.\n\nA prolonged decline of the Hawaiian monk seal population in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands occurred after the late 1950s, lasting until very recently. While individual subpopulations increased or decreased during that time, the total number of seals in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands declined. Although this decline means that a full recovery of the species is a long way off, there are relatively recent, encouraging developments, including:\n\nVisible recolonization and significant growth of the main Hawaiian Islands monk seal subpopulation from low numbers to approximately 400 over the past 2 decades or more\n\nOverall species population growth of 2 percent each year between 2013 to 2022—2021, marked the first time their population exceeded 1,570 in more than 2 decades\n\nPromising advances in juvenile seal survival enhancement research, such as evaluating how translocation affects survival and continued efforts to improve medical treatments\n\nThe decline that occurred in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands was attributed to a number of factors at various regions and time periods. However, low juvenile survival, likely related to limited food availability, was the primary driver of the decline during the past 25 years.\n\nAppearance\n\nNewborn monk seal pups are born black, while weaned pups and older seals are dark gray to brown on their back and light gray to yellowish brown on their belly.\n\nMonk seals undergo a \"catastrophic molt\" about once per year, where they shed the top layer of their skin and fur (similar to elephant seals). Seals that spend a long time at sea foraging can grow algae on their fur. Those that look green haven't molted recently and may be getting ready to shed into a new silvery coat.\n\nMost Hawaiian monk seals have unique natural markings, such as scars or natural bleach marks (white spots), on their fur which help identify them. Personnel authorized by NOAA Fisheries often apply identification tags to their rear flippers. Tagging and tracking used in combination with identification of unique markings enable long-term monitoring of individuals.\n\nMale and female monk seals are similar in size. The only way to confirm whether a seal is female or male is by looking at its belly.\n\nBehavior and Diet\n\nHawaiian monk seals are \"generalist\" feeders, which means they eat a wide variety of foods depending on what's available. They eat many types of common fishes, squids, octopuses, eels, and crustaceans (crabs, shrimps, and lobsters). Diet studies indicate that they forage at or near the seafloor and prefer prey that hide in the sand or under rocks. They do not target most of the locally popular gamefish species such as ulua (giant trevally), pāpio (baby ulua), and ‘ō‘io (bonefish).\n\nHawaiian monk seals can hold their breath for up to 20 minutes and dive more than 1,800 feet; however, they usually dive an average of 6 minutes to depths of less than 200 feet to forage at the seafloor.\n\nHawaiian monk seals are mostly solitary and don't live in colonies like sea lions or other seals. But they do sometimes lie near each other—usually not close enough to make physical contact—in small groups. They usually sleep on beaches, sometimes for days at a time. They also occasionally sleep in small underwater caves.\n\nMonk seals do not migrate seasonally, but some seals have traveled hundreds of miles in the open ocean. Individual seals often frequent the same beaches over and over, but they do not defend territories.\n\nWhere They Live\n\nHawaiian monk seals are found throughout the entire Hawaiian archipelago, a distance of 1,500 miles from Kure Atoll (Hōlanikū) in the northwest to Hawaiʻi Island in the southeast. The majority of Hawaiian monk seals (about 1,200 individuals) live in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, and a much smaller number (about 400) live in the main Hawaiian Islands. There have also been rare sightings of Hawaiian monk seals, as well as a single birth, at Johnston Atoll, the closest atoll southwest of the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nMonk seals live in warm, subtropical waters and spend two-thirds of their time at sea. They use the waters surrounding atolls and islands and areas farther offshore on reefs and submerged banks; they also use deepwater coral beds as foraging habitat. When on land, monk seals haul-out to rest, molt, give birth and nurse on sand, coral rubble, and volcanic rock shorelines. They generally prefer sandy, protected beaches surrounded by shallow waters for pupping.\n\nLifespan & Reproduction\n\nMonk seals can live to over 30 years of age, but few live that long. Monk seals mate in the water. The youngest documented female to give birth was 4 years old, but typically females begin reproducing at age 5 to 6 in the main Hawaiian Islands and age 7 to 10 in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.\n\nLearn more about Hawaiian monk seal mothers and pups\n\nThreats\n\nFood Limitation\n\nLimited food intake by juvenile seals was a major factor driving the population decline in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands for many years. However, improved survival of young seals in recent years seems to be driving the positive abundance trends. In the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, seals must compete for food with large populations of other apex predators, such as large jacks (carangids) and sharks. Shifts in ecosystem productivity, caused by global climate change and/or cyclical changes, may also contribute to food limitation.\n\nShark Predation\n\nSince the late 1990s, predation by Galapagos sharks on pre-weaned and recently weaned seal pups has been a chronic and significant cause of injury and mortality specific to French Frigate Shoals (Lalo) in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. This is a unique type of seal mortality that appears to result from atypical behavior of a limited number of Galapagos sharks that prey on pups in nearshore waters, often in just a few feet of water. Learn more about our monk seal pup protection efforts at French Frigate Shoals (Lalo).\n\nEntanglement\n\nHawaiian monk seals have one of the highest documented entanglement rates of any pinniped species, and pups and juveniles are the most often entangled. Marine debris and derelict fishing gear are chronic forms of pollution affecting monk seal habitat, particularly in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The number of monk seals found entangled each year has generally remained unchanged. Undertaken by various agencies within NOAA, the U.S. Coast Guard, and other partners, marine debris removal efforts have extracted over 800 metric tons of debris in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands since 1996, but accumulation rates of marine debris appear to remain constant. Learn more about our Marine Debris Research and Removal in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.\n\nMale Seal Aggression\n\nA significant cause of female and juvenile monk seal mortality—and overall population decline—during the 1980s and early 1990s was by aggression from multiple male seals (especially at Laysan (Kamole) and Lisianski (Kapou) Islands). In other instances, single males have aggressively attacked and lethally injured recently weaned pups at French Frigate Shoals (Lalo) and Kure Atoll (Hōlanikū). NOAA Fisheries found that removal of specific aggressive males appears to be an effective method to address this threat. Other interventions include hazing of the aggressor, translocating young seals away from areas with the aggressive males, and treating injured seals as appropriate. Male aggression continues to be a concern, even though it tends to be episodic, geographically limited, and largely manageable provided necessary resources are available.\n\nHabitat Loss\n\nThe loss of terrestrial habitat is a significant issue in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, which has mostly low-lying atolls (many islands less than 6.5 feet above sea level) subject to beach loss from storm erosion and sea level rise. Some significant habitat loss—such as the disappearance of Whale-Skate and Trig Islands at French Frigate Shoals (Lalo) which were previously primary pupping sites—has already occurred, and sea level rise over the longer term may threaten a large portion of the resting and pupping habitat in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.\n\nFishery Interactions\n\nSince 1990, fishery management measures have eliminated interactions with monk seals in U.S.-managed commercial fisheries in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. But interactions in nearshore recreational and subsistence fisheries have occurred in the main Hawaiian Islands. Between 1976 and 2018, there have been up to180 documented hookings and entanglements in gill nets, which resulted in 19 monk seal deaths. However, deaths from hookings would be higher were it not for stranding response and other interventions by NOAA Fisheries. Expert fishermen, together with state and federal wildlife managers developed best practice guidance for fishermen that participate in the three main Hawaiian Islands nearshore fisheries that may interact with monk seals: spearfishing, shorecasting, and gillnet fishing.\n\nDisease and Contaminants\n\nOne of the primary diseases of concern to Hawaiian monk seals is toxoplasmosis, a leading cause of seal death in the main Hawaiian Islands. The first case of toxoplasmosis in a Hawaiian monk seal was identified in 2004, and in sum there have been at least 13 known deaths of Hawaiian monk seals caused directly by this parasite, with two clusters of cases detected in 2018 and 2020. Seals with toxoplasmosis are usually found dead and not all carcasses are found, so it is likely that more seals have been affected than are reported. There are more cases of toxoplasmosis in females than males, which means that this disease has direct impacts on the species' reproductive potential and population growth. Unlike toxoplasmosis, which is a clear and present disease threat, morbillivirus (such as the phocine distemper virus) and West Nile Virus are of particular interest despite the fact that neither have been detected in wild Hawaiian monk seals to-date. Because Hawaiian monk seals do not have antibodies to morbilliviruses or West Nile Virus, their introduction could have a substantial effect on the population. The focus is therefore in early detection and prevention, and Hawaiian monk seals have been routinely vaccinated against morbillivirus since 2016. Other infections that are sometimes detected in Hawaiian monk seals include Brucella, herpesvirus, and Leptospira, and their significance varies but is generally not thought to have population level impacts. Persistent organic pollutants and other contaminants in Hawaiian monk seals are below the levels that have been identified as causing health effects in other marine mammal species.\n\nHuman-Seal Interactions\n\nIntentional feeding, disturbance of sleeping or resting seals (including dog attacks), boat or vehicle strikes, and other direct human interactions, such as swimming with juvenile seals, has become a serious concern for the main Hawaiian Islands population. Beaches that are popular for human recreation are increasingly used by monk seals for \"hauling out\" (resting) and molting, and some female monk seals are also pupping on popular recreational beaches. During these pupping events, mother-pup pairs remain on the beach to nurse for up to 7 weeks, at which time they're particularly vulnerable to human disturbance. This also presents a serious human safety concern, as mother seals are protective and aggressive. Human-seal interactions pose both a threat to human and seal safety and have necessitated the relocation of \"conditioned\" seals to remote locations in some cases.\n\nIntentional Killing\n\nIntentional killing of seals is an extreme example of negative human impacts in the main Hawaiian Islands. As of 2018, at least four seals have died from apparent gunshots (including one pregnant female) and eight from blunt force trauma. These events are ongoing and of serious concern.\n\nScientific Classification\n\nKingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Carnivora Family Phocidae Genus Neomonachus Species schauinslandi\n\nHawaiian Monk Seal\n\nThe Hawaiian monk seal is one of NOAA Fisheries' Species in the Spotlight. This initiative is a concerted, agency-wide effort launched in 2015 to spotlight and save the most highly at-risk marine species.\n\nImage\n\nThe Hawaiian monk seal is the last surviving species in its genus, and is endemic to the 1,500-mile long Hawaiian Islands archipelago, from Hawai'i Island to Kure Atoll (Hōlanikū).\n\nOnly about 1,570 Hawaiian monk seals are left in the world and their population is about one-third of historic levels. With numbers that small, the life of every seal can be measured in its impact on the population growth or decline. Focused efforts and heightened partnerships are essential to stabilizing and preventing the extinction of the Hawaiian monk seal. There are inherent challenges to conserving and recovering the Hawaiian monk seal across such an expansive and remote area, especially with a range of ecological and anthropogenic threats affecting the population. Even so, NOAA Fisheries is better poised than ever to save Hawaiian monk seals from extinction and advance recovery.\n\nThreats\n\nIn the main Hawaiian Islands, the primary threats Hawaiian monk seals face are fisheries interactions, intentional harm by humans, and disease, particularly toxoplasmosis, which is now a leading cause of Hawaiian monk seal mortality and a growing concern in the populated main Hawaiian Islands. Toxoplasmosis is a disease caused by a parasite that enters the environment via cat feces and can be transmitted to seals via contaminated water or prey.\n\nIn the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Hawaiian monk seals face different primary threats, including food limitation for juveniles and sub-adults, entanglement in marine debris or fishing gear, and shark predation.\n\nOther threats to Hawaiian monk seals include loss of haul-out and pupping beaches due to erosion in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, disease outbreaks, male aggression towards females, and low genetic diversity.\n\nHawaiian monk seals face threats that include food limitations in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, especially for juveniles and sub-adults, shark predation, entanglement in marine debris, and human interactions, especially in the main Hawaiian Islands. These human interactions include bycatch in fishing gear, mother-pup disturbance on beaches, and exposure to disease. Other threats to Hawaiian monk seals include loss of haul-out and pupping beaches due to erosion in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, disease outbreaks, and male aggression towards females.\n\nSpecies Recovery\n\nAlthough much more work remains before the species is recovered, NOAA Fisheries and our partners have made significant headway in reducing extinction risks thus far. With more than 30 years of research and management experience with Hawaiian monk seals, NOAA Fisheries is currently working across the archipelago to address the population decline, and recovery actions are making a measurable difference—up to 30 percent of the monk seals in the population today are alive as a result of direct recovery interventions to save individual seals and allow them to have future offspring. Over this time period, the rate of monk seal population decline has been cut in half.\n\nSaving this species starts with individual seals. Because of their value to the population growth potential, many monk seal recovery efforts focus on young and reproductive females. One example that highlights the success and impacts of these actions is R5AY, fondly known locally as \"Honey Girl.\" This seal had seven pups, six of which were also female, by the time she was 15 years old. In 2012, she was found extremely emaciated with hook-and-line entanglement damage so extensive that NOAA Fisheries needed to intervene. Through this life-saving intervention, this story has a happy ending—Honey Girl survived and went on to successfully birth two more (female) pups to date. Without the efforts of NOAA Fisheries and our partners, Honey Girl, and other seals like her, would have died and the population trend would be much worse.\n\nNOAA Fisheries is prepared with the plans, permits, and key stakeholder support in place to execute a new recovery initiative that is expected to reverse the species decline within 5 years. In 2014, NOAA Fisheries received a new ESA-MMPA permit to implement these new and expanded recovery actions. We also have reorganized the Monk Seal Recovery Team to assist with implementation and, with their help, released a Main Hawaiian Islands Hawaiian Monk Seal Management Plan (PDF, 72 pages) in 2016.\n\nWe will continue to work with our partners to implement priority recovery actions to accelerate monk seal recovery:\n\nHuman Dimensions of Monk Seal Recovery Implementation and Community Empowerment including working with communities and stakeholders to recover the species, institute grant programs, and integrate Native Hawaiian traditional resource management values and practices into the efforts.\n\nNorthwestern Hawaiian Island Research and Recovery Initiatives including maintaining Northwestern Hawaiian Island Recovery Camps at optimal levels to maximize the number of seals benefiting from interventions and ensuring robust data collection, while expanding recovery activities, and initiating critical research on the effects of climate change on monk seals.\n\nHealth Assessment, Monitoring, and Emerging Disease Research and Prevention including increased disease monitoring and health assessments, research on diseases and mitigation strategies, implementation of a vaccination plan to prevent disease outbreaks, and establishing a network of partners to prevent and manage the threats of disease.\n\nResearch, Management, and Mitigation of Human-Seal Interactions by developing a consortium of partners to mitigate seal-fisheries interactions, developing tools and strategies to address concerning behaviors in monk seals, and implementing targeted engagement strategies to effectively promote coexistence around monk seals.\n\nHawaiian Monk Seal Recovery Program Infrastructure including hiring additional staff, equipment, tools, and consumables to fully implement recovery initiatives.\n\nNOAA Fisheries is at a crucial juncture where continued commitment and investment in new monk seal recovery efforts will yield significant benefits for both monk seals and our stakeholders, including local fisheries and communities. We are developing a 5-year plan of action for this species that builds on the recovery plan and details the focused efforts that are needed over the next 5 years. Through continued commitment and dedication, we can reverse population trends and increase the chances that this rare seal will survive, and future generations can enjoy and co-exist with monk seals for years to come.\n\nSpecies in the Spotlight Priority Actions\n\nWe developed a Species in the Spotlight 2021–2025 Priority Action Plan for Hawaiian monk seals that builds on the 2007 Hawaiian Monk Seal Recovery Plan and the 2016–2020 Priority Action Plan and details the focused efforts that are needed over the next five years. The plan lists key actions for NOAA Fisheries and its partners to help recover the species. These actions include:\n\nImproving survival of juvenile and adult females in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.\n\nManaging and mitigating human interactions to ensure natural population growth and minimize conflict.\n\nAddressing diseases with population level impacts.\n\nIn the first 5 years of the Species in the Spotlight initiative, we took important steps that contributed to stabilizing this species and preventing its further decline. These steps have included:\n\nLaunching the first-ever effort to vaccinate a wild population for morbillivirus and vaccinating over 700 monk seals.\n\nDe-hooking, disentangling, and rehabilitating 154 seals to improve survival.\n\nIncreasing community awareness, with more than 9,000 sightings of monk seals called into public hotlines in a single year.\n\nThrough continued commitment and dedication, we can support the recent positive population trends and increase the chances that this rare seal will survive, so future generations can enjoy and co-exist with monk seals for years to come.\n\n2017 Species in the Spotlight Hero Award\n\nSince opening in 2014, The Marine Mammal Center's Ke Kai Ola facility has played a critical role in Hawaiian monk seal recovery. The hospital is unique in that it is entirely dedicated to rehabilitating Hawaii's endemic and endangered seal. The Marine Mammal Center has been a valuable partner for many years, with decades of experience rehabilitating pinnipeds in California. With the opening of the Hawaii Island facility, rehabilitation became an option for many more seals. The facility helped open a new chapter in Hawaiian monk seal conservation and recovery.\n\nLearn more about the Ke Kai Ola facility's work\n\n2019 Partner in the Spotlight Award\n\nImage\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has partnered with the Pacific Islands Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program since 2008, and responded to more than 50 requests to transport seals between islands between 2008 and 2019. These efforts translate into an excess of $450,000 in dedicated operational and staff support, and have made an enormous difference for the survival of Hawaiian monk seals.\n\nLearn more about the U.S. Coast Guard's monk seal work\n\n2021 Partner in the Spotlight Award\n\nDiane Pike has volunteered countless hours to the conservation of Hawaiian monk seals since 2008. She filled the role of marine mammal response coordinator on Molokai for over a decade, and in 2019, she stepped in to assist at Kalaupapa National Historical Park during a period of staff transition, helping to bring new staff up to speed and assisting with monitoring and tagging a large cohort of pups born in the Park that year. Diane’s recent “retirement” from monk seal recovery work marks the end of an era, and she is leaving things far better than she found them.\n\nLearn more about Diane’s work\n\n2023 Partner in the Spotlight Award\n\nHawaiʻi Marine Animal Response (HMAR) operates on the islands of Oʻahu and Molokaʻi. Since partnering with NOAA in 2016, their 80+ volunteers, interns, and staff have spent countless hours conducting field responses for Hawaiian monk seals. HMAR has responded to stranded seals, newborn pups, monitored injured and compromised individuals, helped to collect important health and stranding response data, and developed unique education projects for community members. The dedication of HMAR’s staff and volunteers is an inspiration, and they have played a big role in the significant increase in public awareness and support for Hawaiian monk seal conservation.\n\nLearn more about HMAR’s work\n\nManagement Overview\n\nHawaiian monk seals are protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), and Hawai'i state law. They have been listed as endangered under the ESA since 1976. The Hawaiian monk seal is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands archipelago and Johnston Atoll, meaning they are native and exist nowhere else on Earth. NOAA Fisheries is working to protect this species in many ways, with the goal that its population will increase.\n\nRecovery Planning and Implementation\n\nRecovery Action\n\nUnder the ESA, NOAA Fisheries is required to develop and implement recovery plans for the conservation and survival of listed species. The ultimate goal of the Recovery Plan for the Hawaiian Monk Seal is to recover the species, with an interim goal of down-listing its status from endangered to threatened.\n\nThe major actions in the recovery plan are:\n\nInvestigate and mitigate factors affecting food limitation\n\nPrevent entanglement of monk seals\n\nReduce shark predation on monk seals\n\nConserve Hawaiian monk seal habitat\n\nReduce Hawaiian monk seal interaction with fisheries\n\nReduce male aggression toward pups/immature seals and adult females\n\nReduce the likelihood of human disturbance\n\nInvestigate and develop response to biotoxin impacts\n\nReduce impacts from compromised and grounded vessels\n\nReduce the impact of contaminants\n\nContinue population monitoring and research\n\nCreate a Main Hawaiian Islands Hawaiian Monk Seal Management Plan (PDF, 72 pages)\n\nImplement the Recovery Program for the Hawaiian monk seal\n\nHawaiian monk seal resting on the beach at French Frigate Shoals (Lalo) in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.\n\nImplementation\n\nNOAA Fisheries is committed to implementing the Hawaiian Monk Seal Recovery Plan, focusing on the overarching recovery strategies listed above. Actions being undertaken to implement the plan:\n\nCoordination of NOAA, non-governmental organizations, and other federal, state, and local agencies to facilitate monk seal recovery.\n\nReduction of mortality factors, including shark predation, male aggression, and risk of exposure to infectious diseases.\n\nConservation of monk seal habitat.\n\nDevelopment of comprehensive outreach and education programs focused on minimizing human disturbance and other adverse impacts and maximizing public support for monk seal conservation.\n\nCoordination of volunteer groups in the main Hawaiian Islands to facilitate monitoring and response for Hawaiian monk seal pupping events and haul-outs.\n\nIn recent years, NOAA Fisheries has developed additional strategic implementation plans that focus on partnerships and collaboration, and on issues affecting the main Hawaiian Islands monk seal population:\n\nSpecies in the Spotlight Priority Actions: 2021-2025\n\nSpecies in the Spotlight Priority Actions: 2016-2020\n\nMain Hawaiian Islands Monk Seal Management Plan (PDF, 72 pages)\n\nManagement Plan Planning Approach and Background Materials for Main Hawaiian Islands Plan (PDF, 90 pages)\n\nHawaiian Monk Seal 5-Year Review: Summary and Evaluation\n\nCritical Habitat\n\nOnce a species is listed under the ESA, NOAA Fisheries evaluates and identifies whether any areas meet the definition of critical habitat. Those areas may be designated as critical habitat through a rulemaking process.\n\nThe designation of an area as critical habitat does not create a closed area, marine protected area, refuge, wilderness reserve, preservation, or other conservation area; nor does the designation affect land ownership. Federal agencies that undertake, fund, or permit activities that may affect these designated critical habitat areas are required to consult with NOAA Fisheries to ensure that their actions do not adversely modify or destroy designated critical habitat.\n\nIn 2008, NOAA Fisheries received a petition to revise critical habitat for the Hawaiian monk seal—the terrestrial and marine areas the mammal needs to survive and recover—requesting the 1988 designation be extended in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and include new areas in the main Hawaiian Islands. Since the original critical habitat designation, new information became available regarding monk seal habitat use revealing that monk seals forage at greater depths than previously thought and that they successfully utilize habitat in the main Hawaiian Islands.\n\nNOAA Fisheries revised the Hawaiian monk seal critical habitat to further describe habitat features and areas that support Hawaiian monk seal conservation. Specific areas designated include 16 occupied areas within the range of the Hawaiian monk seal. These areas contain one or more features essential to Hawaiian monk seal conservation, including:\n\nPreferred pupping and nursing areas\n\nSignificant haul-out areas\n\nMarine foraging areas out to 200 meters in depth\n\nIn 2015, NOAA Fisheries issued the final rule to revise the Hawaiian monk seal critical habitat, expanding the previous designation in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and identifying new key beach areas and marine-foraging areas in the main Hawaiian Islands.\n\nAreas Included in the Final Critical Habitat Designation\n\nNORTHWESTERN HAWAIIAN ISLANDS (Hawaiian names in parenthesis)\n\nCritical habitat in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands includes all beach areas, sand spits, and islets, including all beach crest vegetation to its deepest extent inland as well as the seafloor and marine habitat 10 meters in height above the seafloor from the shoreline out to the 200-meter depth contour around:\n\nKure Atoll (Hōlanikū)\n\nMidway Atoll (Kuaihelani)\n\nPearl and Hermes Reef (Manawai)\n\nLisianski Island (Kapou)\n\nLaysan Island (Kamole)\n\nMaro Reef (Kamokuokamohoali‘i)\n\nGardner Pinnacles (‘Ōnūnui)\n\nFrench Frigate Shoals (Lalo)\n\nNecker Island (Mokumanamana)\n\nNihoa Island\n\nMAIN HAWAIIAN ISLANDS\n\nCritical habitat in the main Hawaiian Islands includes the seafloor and marine habitat to 10 meters above the seafloor from the 200-meter depth contour through the shoreline and extending into terrestrial habitat 5 meters inland from the shoreline between identified boundary points around the following islands:\n\nKaula Island (includes marine habitat only)\n\nNiʻihau (includes marine habitat from 10 to 200 meters in depth)\n\nKauaʻi\n\nOʻahu\n\nMaui Nui (including Kahoʻolawe, Lānaʻi, Maui, and Molokaʻi)\n\nHawaiʻi Island\n\nConservation Efforts\n\nFor each threat identified as a source of negative impacts to monk seals (see the Threats section on Overview), NOAA Fisheries, with assistance from our partners, has developed and implemented targeted conservation and recovery efforts to address each threat. We have also developed broader management and outreach strategies that seek to engage the general public as an active part of monk seal recovery.\n\nOverseeing Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response\n\nWe work with volunteer networks in all coastal states to respond to marine mammal strandings including all pinnipeds. When stranded animals are found alive, NOAA Fisheries and our partners assess the animal’s health and determine the best course of action. When stranded animals are found dead, our scientists work to understand and investigate the cause of death. Although the cause often remains unknown, scientists can sometimes attribute strandings to disease, harmful algal blooms, vessel strikes, fishing gear entanglements, pollution exposure, and underwater noise. Some strandings can serve as indicators of ocean health, giving insight into larger environmental issues that may also have implications for human health and welfare.\n\nLearn more about the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program\n\nMarine Mammal Unusual Mortality Events\n\nHawaiian Monk Seals have been part of a declared unusual mortality event in the past. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, an unusual mortality event is defined as \"a stranding that is unexpected; involves a significant die-off of any marine mammal population; and demands immediate response.\" To understand the health of marine mammal populations, scientists study unusual mortality events.\n\nGet information on active and past UMEs\n\nGet an overview of marine mammal UMEs\n\nResponding to Strandings and Haul-Outs\n\nThe Pacific Islands Marine Mammal Response Network responds to strandings and haul-outs of all marine mammals, including monk seals. NOAA Fisheries manages the Network in partnership with several government agencies, including the Hawaiʻi Department of Land and Natural Resources, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the National Park Service. Network volunteers, managed directly by NOAA Fisheries and/or our partners, donate thousands of hours to public education and day-to-day human-seal management in the main Hawaiian Islands.\n\nVolunteers assist with the following:\n\nResponding to seals that haul out to rest by setting up \"seal resting areas\" and using them as a platform to educate the public about monk seal biology, conservation, and responsible wildlife viewing practices, which helps to deter potential disturbance.\n\nMonitoring monk seal pupping and molting events.\n\nReporting seals in distress (due to fish hook injury, entanglement, or otherwise) and standing by until arrival of certified NOAA assistance.\n\nSearching for and long-term monitoring of seals of concern (seals reported with injuries, hookings, entanglements, behavioral concerns, etc.) and providing NOAA with observation data on these animals.\n\nVisiting schools, festivals, local businesses, and other venues to provide public education and outreach regarding the ecology and conservation of Hawaiian monk seals.\n\nImplementing Targeted Conservation Strategies\n\nFood Limitation\n\nOur work includes:\n\nTranslocation of seals to other islands or atolls with improved foraging conditions.\n\nCaptive rehabilitation of malnourished animals.\n\nOf note, NOAA’s partnership with Ke Kai Ola, a facility built by The Marine Mammal Center in Kona, Hawai'i in 2014, has opened up a new world of rehabilitation possibilities for monk seals. In 2017, Ke Kai Ola was recognized as a NOAA Species in the Spotlight Hero for their contributions to monk seal conservation and recovery.\n\nShark Predation\n\nOur work includes:\n\nTranslocation of newly weaned pups to areas with low shark predation risk.\n\nLimited lethal removal of Galapagos sharks from nearshore pupping habitat.\n\nEntanglement in Marine Debris\n\nOur work includes:\n\nDisentangling seals and removal of marine debris from beaches and marine habitat.\n\nAdult Male Aggression\n\nOur work includes:\n\nTreating injured seals when appropriate.\n\nHazing of identified aggressors.\n\nTranslocating pups from areas where aggressive males frequent.\n\nRemoving the aggressive males.\n\nHabitat Loss\n\nOur work includes:\n\nContinued monitoring to assist in planning mitigation strategies necessary, particularly for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.\n\nHuman-Seal Interactions (Including Fisheries)\n\nOur work includes:\n\nEducation and outreach to prevent/minimize human-seal interactions.\n\nApplying behavioral conditioning, translocating, or bringing into captivity seals that pose a human safety risk.\n\nDehooking seals.\n\nEncouraging fishermen to use barbless hooks and to avoid fishing when a seal is in the area.\n\nNOAA Fisheries partners with the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources' Division of Aquatic Resources to increase fishermen's awareness and promote seal-friendly fishing practices through a joint effort called the Barbless Circle Hook Project. This work is funded in part via an ESA Section 6 Program grant. Efforts by the Hawaiʻi Department of Land and Natural Resources have focused on response support and community outreach and education, especially outreach to fishermen and other local ocean users.\n\nDisease\n\nOur work includes:\n\nMonitoring health, including disease, parasitic infection, and toxin screening.\n\nProviding appropriate medical treatment (including deworming).\n\nContinuing vaccination research and response planning.\n\nCoordinating Volunteer Participation\n\nWe coordinate volunteer groups in the main Hawaiian Islands to assist with monitoring and response for monk seal pupping events and haul-outs. Volunteers help put up signs near hauled-out monk seals to help alert the public to their presence and help prevent disturbance. They also educate beachgoers about monk seal natural history and responsible viewing of this endangered species.\n\nVolunteers also assist NOAA’s monk seal researchers to assess the population of this endangered species by counting seals on beaches across all of the main Hawaiian Islands.\n\nFor more information or to apply to be a volunteer, contact your island's Marine Mammal Response Coordinator.\n\nEvaluating the Environmental, Social, and Economic Effects of the Monk Seal Recovery Program\n\nIn compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, NOAA Fisheries prepared and published a programmatic environmental impact statement in 2014. This comprehensive review of the monk seal recovery program describes and analyzes a suite of research and enhancement (management) actions proposed by NOAA Fisheries to promote recovery of endangered Hawaiian monk seals.\n\nEducation and Outreach\n\nVolunteers help put up signs near hauled-out monk seals to help protect them from disturbance and educate beachgoers about monk seal natural history and responsible viewing of this endangered species.\n\nFor more information or to apply to be a volunteer, contact your island's Monk Seal Volunteer Response Program\n\nWatch our video about monk seal rehabilitation and the Ke Kai Ola Marine Mammal Center and hospital."
