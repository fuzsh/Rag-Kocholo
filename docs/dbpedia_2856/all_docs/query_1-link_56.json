Predictable schedules are an important component of healthy lives.\n\nThe ordinance puts into place fair scheduling practices, including 2 weeks’ notice of work schedules and predictability pay for last-minute scheduling changes, allows employees to decline back-to-back shifts without adequate rest, and requires employers to offer any additional hours that become available to existing part-time employees.\n\nThe ordinance will become operational for all covered employers and employees on January 12, 2024.\n\nThrough early 2024, City of Berkeley staff will be supporting employers and employees to understand and implement the Fair Workweek Ordinance. Upcoming events will be listed at the bottom of this page.\n\nOfficial Fair Workweek Notice to Employers and Employees (English)\n\nOfficial Fair Workweek Notice to Employers and Employees (Simplified Chinese)\n\nOfficial Fair Workweek Notice to Employers and Employees (Spanish)\n\nRead the Full Text of the Fair Workweek Ordinance\n\nFair Workweek Training Module for Employers\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\nMinimum Wage Ordinance\n\nEmployers must pay all staff who work in Berkeley at least two hours per week the minimum wage standard set by the City.

Employees must have worked at least three months and must work at least eight hours per week on a regular basis to be covered by the ordinance.\n\nAn employer may revoke or modify a flexible or predictable working schedule for business reasons, with reasonable notice to the employee.
