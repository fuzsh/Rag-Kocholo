        "text": "You can download this article as a PDF (English, Spanish).\n\nBeyond TV, Video Games, Apps and the Internet\n\nWhen you have a child who is sick at home, it can be tough to find things for them to do. Of course there’s always TV, video games, apps and the Internet, but it’s better to fill most of the day with other activities. We hope you find some ideas here. But first, there are a few things to remember:\n\nAvoid choosing activities that might frustrate your child. Choose things they can do with ease when feeling well. Familiar toys and play items give a child comfort and security. When choosing new projects or toys, select ones that are geared to a slightly younger age.\n\nKnow that your child’s attention span will be shorter than normal. Plan activities that can be finished in short periods of time or can be stopped and started again easily. If your child needs to stay in bed, place a table by the bedside. Provide a large, firm surface to work on. A lid from a large cardboard box can help keep track of pieces or supplies.\n\nTry to set regular times throughout the day to spend with your child so you can still go about your daily tasks. If your child is young, they will need your attention more often, but for shorter periods of time. If your child is older, they can manage being with you less often, but will enjoy having you stay long enough to play a game or do something together.\n\nHelp your child get started on an activity, check on progress and help with clean up. This kind of structure encourages a child to continue on their own.\n\nTry not to insist on neatness. For messy activities, an old vinyl tablecloth can help protect your child’s bed or play area. (Do not use thin plastic bags or sheets with children under three years due to suffocation hazard.)\n\nActivity Suggestions\n\nUnder 3 years\n\nCuddling and tender loving care\n\nReading/looking at books\n\nColoring\n\nSorting/matching toys and activities\n\nMusic\n\nPlay-Doh\n\nEasy-to-handle building sets (Duplo)\n\nDolls/stuffed toys\n\nActivity sets or centers (such as Fisher Price Farm or Garage)\n\n3 to 5 years\n\nAll of the activities listed above, plus:\n\nPuzzles (5–25 large pieces)\n\nPuppets (make your own out of paper lunch sacks!)\n\nPainting\n\nCutting and pasting\n\nDramatic/imaginative play ( “Let’s pretend…”)\n\nBubbles\n\n5 to 7 years\n\nSimple games (Candyland, Chutes & Ladders, checkers, cards)\n\nPuzzles (up to 60 large pieces)\n\nSimple crafts, using: safety scissors, glue, crayons, non-toxic felt markers, tape, scrap material/yarn, paper/cardboard, egg cartons, paper towel tubes, ribbon, wrapping paper, etc.\n\nConstruction/put-together sets with more pieces (Lego)\n\nSorting/matching/counting activities (pictures, colors, objects)\n\nReading/stories\n\nMusic\n\nPlay-Doh\n\n“Practice” academic skill\n\nCollections\n\n7 to 9 years\n\nPaper and pencil games (word search, mazes, matching, crosswords)\n\nBoard games\n\nPuzzles (100 pieces)\n\nCrafts (can add more steps, materials)\n\nBeginning sewing activities\n\nMagnets and science-like activities\n\nReading\n\n“Helping” activities\n\nCollections\n\nMusic\n\n9 to 11 years\n\nActivities from above group, but make them harder or more complex.
