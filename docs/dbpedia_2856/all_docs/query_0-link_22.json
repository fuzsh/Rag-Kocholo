        "text": "KD is grateful to have her mother-in-law living in her home but says care-related expenses can take a toll.\n\nThe last thing you want people thinking about in their golden years is money. WA Cares is a really unique program – to know that as you get older, you’re still cared for and you’re still valuable.\n\nIf KD’s mother-in-law had WA Cares, she could use her benefit for:\n\nPaid family caregiver\n\nHome safety evaluation\n\nCare respite services\n\nImage\n\nAt 30, Dani experienced a complication during a routine medical procedure that left her with a spinal cord injury.\n\nI’d never really seen anyone my age need long-term care until it happened to me. Life happens to all of us. At any point in time, you could experience a serious illness or an injury or a traumatic event.\n\nIf Dani had WA Cares, she could use her benefit for:\n\nIn-home care\n\nWheelchair\n\nTransportation\n\nImage\n\nSisters Sun-Hee and Yunhee stepped back from their nursing careers to provide daily care for their mom.\n\nWe want her to be safe, happy and content. But we haven’t been working during this time, so we have zero income. A resource like WA Cares would be so helpful in easing that financial aspect.\n\nIf Sun-Hee & Yunhee’s mom had WA Cares, she could use her benefit for:\n\nPaid family caregiver\n\nMeal preparation\n\nMedication reminder device\n\nImage\n\nAbout the WA Cares Fund\n\nWA Cares Fund is the result of years of research on how to make care accessible for all workers in Washington. As a public long-term care insurance program, WA Cares guarantees coverage for all workers regardless of pre-existing conditions. Washington is the first state in the nation to create an affordable way for the broad middle class to access long-term care without having to spend down their life savings.\n\nWA Cares Fund is managed by Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, in collaboration with Washington State Health Care Authority and the Employment Security Department.\n\nLearn more about the history and structure of the WA Cares Fund."
