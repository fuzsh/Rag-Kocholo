        "text": "After a long illness, died on Sunday, November 12, 2023, at the age of 88 with family at her side. Pat was the daughter of the late John P. and Katharine M. Nickodemus. She was born March 12, 1935, and was a resident of Saginaw most of her life.\n\nOn August 23, 1958, she married the love of her life, Thomas E. Tessin. He predeceased her in 1981, as did their sons, Thomas E. Tessin, Jr. in 1986 and Emil A. Tessin III in 2020.\n\nPat had many accomplishments throughout her long life. She was a dedicated homemaker and talented seamstress who designed and created her own wedding dress later making clothes and needlework gifts for family and friends. She graduated with a B.S. degree from Marygrove College and then taught school at St. Mary School in Dexter, MI and in the Saginaw Public School System. After the death of her husband, Pat went back to school for her Licensed Practical Nursing Certificate, eventually retiring from Covenant Healthcare in 1999 where she was also a Licensed Apprentice Substance Abuse Counselor and had begun work on her Masters Degree in Healthcare Administration.\n\nPat believed in the importance of giving back to her community through service. She was a member of St. Stephen (St. Dominic) Catholic Church, where she served on the Parish Council and was the founder and manager of the Used Book Sale at the High School. She was a founder and secretary of the Tri-County Diabetic Association. She was a member of the Junior League of Saginaw, served on their Board of Directors, participated in many volunteer projects and was recognized in 2013 as a Gold Rose recipient. Pat also volunteered for the Covenant Hospital Auxiliary in the Harrison Gift shop for many years, was a member of the Saginaw Art Museum, the Childrenâ€™s Free Ward Association, Garden Club V, and a former member of the Saginaw Country Club. Pat also volunteered for many years at the East Side Soup Kitchen.\n\nPat had a strong faith and was guided by the corporal works of mercy especially feeding the hungry and tending the sick. She believed in the civic obligation of being an educated voter.\n\nShe is survived by her son, Peter N. Tessin, S.C. daughter, Katharine Q. Tessin, Saginaw, her daughter-in-law Cynthia M. Tessin and her grandsons, Thomas R. Tessin and John M. Tessin, all of CA. She was predeceased by her siblings John Nickodemus, Ann David, Rosemary Curtin and her husband Michael Curtin, and Jane Williams. Surviving are her brother Thomas Nickodemus (Kathy), sister Mary Hemmer Rappuhn, and sister-in-law Rose Marie Nickodemus. Also surviving are many nieces and nephews including her niece and goddaughter Lucy Galus who played an essential role in her care these past many months.\n\nThe family would like to thank the staff at HealthSource Saginaw for their care."
