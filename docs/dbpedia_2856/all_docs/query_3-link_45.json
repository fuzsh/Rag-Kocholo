The funeral was held the next morning from the family residence and the remains were interred in the Jewish Cemetery east of town.\n\nAlbert was born at Giddings, Texas, and in his tender youth became afflicted, but with the most admirable fortitude, bore his misfortune and ever remained cheerful and pleasant to all, never burdening others, but ever willing, to the best of his ability, to do someone a good turn. As the dark cloud of Death was approaching, he still extended his palm and wished others happiness, and with the smile of an infant, unconscious of any wrong he passed into that blessed sleep which brings comfort to the soul and the body.\n\nTo the bereaved mother and family relatives, we offer our sincere sympathy in this sad hour.

Sam Alexander, and well known as Company âAâ of the Confederate States Army.Â Memories of that patriotic gathering underneath our historic oak flit through oneâs consciousness along with others no less treasured, of this tiny Miss, elevated on a goods-box, as she made the presentation speech to our brave boys in gray.\n\nContributed by Rob Brown\n\nFRED SASSIN\n\nWeimar Mercury, Friday, May 14, 1948\n\nFRED SASSIN, 77, BURIED AT DUBINA\n\nBurial of Fred Sassin, 77, of Dubina was held there April 28.\n\nMr. Sassin, a retired farmer, suffered a stroke, April 26 and died almost immediately.

From what we have been able to learn, the supposition that she fell from the passenger train has been abandoned, and that Miss Saunders undoubtedly met with foul play.\n\nFrom the Smithville Times, whose editors secured the information from relatives of the unfortunate young woman living there, we have the following: \"Miss Saunders was returning from Halletsville where she had gone to see about her school and was returning home. She had bought a ticket to West Point where presumably she got off to walk along the right of way to a short route home, between West Point and Winchester. Her lifeless body found by a train crew near the railway trestle that spans the Colorado river between the two towns, and was brought by them to Winchester where it was turned over to citizens who immediately notified Mr. Saunders. Authentic reports reaching the Times office Wednesday about noon are in the effect that the unfortunate girl's throat was severed and that a leg was broken.\"\n\nWith the foregoing given as authentic, it is apparent that the young woman was murdered. [Notwithstanding] the fact that the country thereabouts has been thoroughly searched nothing further has developed and no arrests have been made. Miss Lucille was the daughter of Edward Saunders who lived near Winchester.âLaGrange Journal.\n\nMATTIE TAYLOR SAUNDERS\n\nWeimar Mercury, 31 Jan 1913, page 8\n\nF. W.

(âBossâ) Schaefer ceased to struggle and journeyed hence, leaving his immediate family and innumberable relatives and friends to mourn his loss.Â His death came after an illness that had extended over many months, during which time his now mourning widow and children, and medical knowledge did all that mortals could do to keep him.Â He passed to his reward after having openly acknowledged his faith in the redeemer and having received his last communion.Â He died the earthly death and sought the rest that is promised to those who believe in Him.Â And the departure of Mr. Schaefer means the going of one who had a valuable heritage to leave to his children â the knowledge of having been a good citizen, a good husband and father.\n\nMr. Schaefer was born in Germany November 9, 1839, and when but seven years of age his parents emigrated to America and came to Fayette County shortly after landing at Galveston.Â His entire boyhood days, and his years after acquiring his majority were spent on the farm.Â The family lived at Bluff and in that neighborhood, January 8, 1868 he was united in marriage with Miss Louise Helmcamp, to whom were born seven children all living with the exception of one daughter who died in infancy.Â His living children are: Mrs. Elise Prilop; Geo. C. Schaefer and Mrs. Marie Bollmeyer, La Grange; Mrs. Lula Eck, Bluff; Mrs. Alvena Luedemann, Schulenburg; Chas. Schaefer, Bartlett.Â Eighteen grandchildren and three great grandchildren are included in his family relatives.\n\nWhen the war between the states necessitated the volunteer enlistment of young men, C. H. Schaefer came forward, a young man of twenty-two years, and enlisted as a private in Greenâs Brigade, a band of as brave men as history has ever been able to furnish, and of whom only a few now survive.Â Throughout the four years of that awful struggle he served, and when the musket and saber were laid aside, he returned to Fayette County to rebuild and retrieve.Â When the Bluff Schuetzen Verein was organized in 1875, he, together with Aug. Mensing, Chas. Schwartz, Wendling Peschke, Anton Hinke, Paul Nordhausen and Ed. Wildner were the sponsors.Â Through their efforts â the mad seven â this rifle club succeeded in becoming one of the most famous clubs of the state, and it still exists today.Â Mr. Schaefer was the sixth of the seven to go, Edward Wildner alone remaining.\n\nMonday afternoon, a very large concourse of relatives and friends following, the remains were taken to the new cemetery and there, with the religious ceremonies conducted by Rev. Heise, the last rest was tendered him.Â Being a member of Bismark Lodge, Sons of Herman, that membership attended in a body.Â Their ritual ceremony was read at the open grave.Â The widow, his children and grand and great grandchildren have the sympathy of the entire community in this hour.\n\nContributed by Rob Brown\n\nCHARLES E. SCHAEFER\n\nThe La Grange Journal, Thursday, July 4, 1929\n\nDied At Houston\n\nChas. E. Schaefer, born at the farm home on the Bluff near La Grange, near to forty-one years ago, died at his home at Houston early last Friday morning, death coming unexpectedly and very suddenly.Â Ten days prior to his death Chas. had submitted to an operation for the removal of his tonsils, and was, apparently recovering rapidly.Â During the early morning hours he visited the bath room and without warning sank to the floor and died before medical aid could be secured.Â Shock, so the Journal learns, is attributed to his sudden demise.\n\nChas. Schaefer was the youngest child of Mr. and Mrs. Chas. (Boss) Schaefer, one of the pioneer families of the Bluff section, and when a mere lad his parents removed to the city, the old family home still standing on South Jefferson street, and occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Louis Bollmeyer, and the widow of the elder Schaefer.Â Deceased received his education at the public schools of La Grange, and after reaching his majority became interested in buying cotton, associating himself with the Wilson Cotton Company, being located at Bartlett, and other cities in central Texas, and later at Houston.Â He took readily to the cotton business, and was recognized as a man well informed and practical in the business of his choice.\n\nHad he lived until the first of August he would have completed his forty-first year; on December 31, 1912, he was united in marriage with Miss Louise Weber of La Grange, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. A. F. Weber, Sr., who, with one son, Chas., survives.Â Four sisters, Mesdames Ernst Prilop of Cedar, Louis Eck of Bluff, Louis Bollmeyer of La Grange and W. O.

R. Heise in charge of the religious services.\n\nThe passing of this aged woman, recalls that within the past year the toll has been heavy; along that section of the city and down to the eastern part, and thence to the northeastern part of La Grange, the grim reaper has traveled; in many homes there is a vacant chair, inÂ many homes there has been created a vacancy by the death of father or mother, and even though it be so decreed, there is still the sad reflection that the heart dictates.Â Families have been robbed of that parent who has been such an inspiration to them.Â At the age of 84 years and 2 months, Mrs. Schaefer gave up the struggle.\n\nMrs. Schaefer, whose maiden name was Helmcamp, and a member of a prominent family that settled in Fayette county in the fifties, was born in Germany, and was only a child when brought to the land of promise â America.Â Her mother died within a short time after emigrating to this country, leaving her father to rear 10 children.Â This, when it is told that the early pioneers had to struggle against growing adversities, may be understood to mean a severe blow, but the emigrants bore their afflictions with strong fortitude and managed to accumulate both home and means to carry on.Â She was united in marriage with Chas. Schaefer, January 8, 1868, the then young couple beginning their new life on a farm southwest from La Grange.Â Until 1895 they remained on the farm, and then removed to La Grange; seven children blessed this union, of whom one son and one daughter preceded her in death.\n\nWidowed thirteen years ago, her companion of many years taken, she was not without the tender affections of her married children, yet her body afflictions were such as to cause much suffering, and despite her advancing age, a few years ago, she had to submit to a serious surgical operation.Â Her faith was remarkable, she craved and received that peace which passeth all understanding, her pastor, Rev. R. Heise, praised her for her unswerving devotion and her strong leaning to the teachings of her Savior.Â It may be said death had no terrors for her, she looked forward to a reunion in another world.\n\nMrs. Schaefer is survived by one son, Geo. Schaefer of La Grange; four daughters: Mrs. Elise Prilop and Mrs. W. O. (Alwine) Luedermann of Schulenburg; Mrs. Louis (Marie) Bollmeyer, La Grange, and Mrs. Louise Eck, Bluff; there are 19 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren, two brothers, Geo.

Her remains were committed to rest in the Odd Fellows' cemetery Saturday morning at 10 o'clock. At this time of this burial, Mrs. Marie Schawe [of Weimar], the mother of Dr. Otto Schawe, and grandmother of little Adeline, was very ill, and although every effort was made by physicians, relatives and friends to stay the hand of Death, it availed naught and at 3 p. m. the tired soul was wafted to its maker. Mrs. Schawe was a lady of many excellent traits, and the possessor of many friends where ever known. She was the wife of Mr. Henry Schawe and the mother of Mrs. E. Potthast, Mrs. Ch.

Friends gathered with relatives, and interment was made at the New La Grange Cemetery. Rev. R. Heise officiated at the church and at the cemetery. Miss Anna Margreta Scherrer died Wednesday, 21 Feb 1935 at Park. Her remains were brought to the church the next morning. She had been ill several months.\n\nDeceased was born to Mr. & Mrs. Bernard Scherrer at the pleasant old Scherrer home at Biegel 20 July 1851. Here she spent all her childhood days with her two brothers and four sisters, and friends. She lived in the old home until the death of her mother on 3 December 1904 at the age of 77 years. Miss Scherrer was always fond of flowers, animals and farm life. At the time of her demise, she was 83 years and 7 months of age.\n\nHer father, Bernard Scherrer, one of the pioneer settlers of Biegel, Fayette county, was born at St. Gallen, Switzerland 6 March 1806. He came to America in 1829 and sailed from New York to Quebec, Canada and thence up the St. Lawrence River from Buffalo and thence by stage to St. Louis, Missouri. He went from St. Louis to New Orleans by boat down the Mississippi River. He then went by boat from New Orleans to Galveston Island where, later, the City of Galveston was built. From Galveston Island he came overland over the flower covered Texas prairies to Industry, Austin County arriving there in April 1833 and soon thereafter moved to Biegel, Fayette County where he died 15 November 1892.\n\nMr. Scherrer, when reminiscing, would relate of his trip down the Mississippi River; how the colonial plantation homes with their picturesque settings could be seen from aboard the boat on which he was travelling. On 6 February 1845, he married Miss Eliza Margaret Koch at Industry, Austin County, taking his bride horseback to Biegel, Fayette County. Of his life experiences, which he rarely recounted in his later years, were his school and college years in beautiful St. Gallen, later Texas as part of Mexico, then Texas as a Republic, and Texas as a State of the union, the War with Mexico, the Civil War, Indian raids and Reconstruction days, all woven in to make a life with many lovely, romantic, as well as dangerous and sad incidents, woven into his life experiences.\n\nMiss Scherrer is survived by one sister, Mrs. Mary Knolle of San Antonio and nieces and nephews as follows: Dr. B. E. Knolle of Industry, W. B. Gehrels of Alice, B. H. Meinert of Columbus, J. A. Gehrels of Cibolo, Ms. Anne Scott of La Grange, Mrs. Ella Herzog of Goose Creek, L. Meinert of Hallettsville, A. H.

Gehrels and wife, John Gehrels and wife, Mrs. Anna Scott and Mrs. Ella Herzog lovingly administered to all her wants. She was at the home of Mrs. Ella Scott where she lived since before the death of her sister, Mrs. Emelia Gehrels.\n\nTranscribed by Norman C.

After Schneider expressed indigantion and making a few suspicious and threatening motions, Spiegel seized his pistol and fired upon Mr. Schneider, the bullet entering his breast. Schneider ran out of the saloon immediately after he was shot toward the lumber yard, when he fell and exclaimed to some friends who were coming that way, \"I am shot.\" They picked him up and carried him back to the saloon, and provided a bed, where he received medical treatment, but in vain; he breathed his last about 11 o'clock same night.
