Instead, you must stay home and rest so the pain doesn’t worsen.\n\nYou can’t live like this.\n\nYou don’t want to be held back.\n\nInstead, your plans are put on hold while your knee makes decisions for you every day.\n\nCan't you still work out as hard as you'd like?\n\nDoes your knee keep you up at night and make it hard to sleep?\n\nAre your workouts going on even when you're not there?\n\nYou feel like you’re missing out on life while dealing with knee pain.\n\nYour self-confidence is fading by the second.\n\nYou want to get back out there, but this time you’ll be more vital than ever.\n\nWe can help with that.\n\nAt CoActiv Physical Therapy, we help you get back to doing the things you love to do without pain.\n\nWe help you reach your goals, get rid of pain, and get better at what you do.\n\nWould you like to know more?\n\nAsk about our hours and prices!\n\nHere's the thing: if your knee hurts, you can try many different things to make it feel better.

Sometimes I need guidance in helping me to achieve my goals. It is such a blessing to have quality therapists so conveniently located. Knowledgeable AND nice! Over the years of my various competitive sports I have needed good people to help my body perform at it’s peak. Yna & Sabino are GOOD! Willing and able to work WITH me and my competitive goals. Thank you both for your efforts to get me to peak performance. It’s Competitive Ballroom Dance, but the benefits spill out to the rest of life!”\n\n- Destiny Carnes\n\n★★★★★ 5/5\n\n“Had an amazing session and honestly couldn’t believe the results. I’ve had chronic lower back pain for years. After reviewing how my body functions I was given a few exercises to do that would help with the pain and my overall body goals. I was then given a massage to work on my pain. It was different than any one I’ve experienced before as it truly targeted the pain. I figured it might help temporarily but I can say happily that my pain has went away. Total surprise that their technique would work so well. I can say my back has never felt better. The staff here was awesome. They will get you where you want to be and they are so nice. Give them a try and you won’t be disappointed.”"
