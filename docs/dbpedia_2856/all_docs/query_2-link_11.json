It provides an ideal stopover for migratory birds. More than 15,000 sandhill cranes stop during fall migration. Learn more about the fall sandhill crane migration at Jasper-Pulaski FWA.\n\nAcquisition of the land for Jasper-Pulaski began in 1929. During the 1930s, Jasper-Pulaski was designated as a game farm and preserve. Hunting started at the property in 1958, and in 1965 the area was designated as a fish and game area. In 1972 the name was changed to fish & wildlife area.\n\nMost revenues used in land acquisition, development, operation, and maintenance of Jasper-Pulaski FWA are derived from the sale of hunting, fishing, and trapping licenses. Funds are also received from the federal Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson programs to aid fish and wildlife restoration. These funds are from taxes on sport hunting, shooting, and fishing equipment. Indiana hunters and anglers are proud to provide this property for the enjoyment of all people.\n\nAmenities\n\nPublic restrooms:\n\nHQ area restrooms are open 24 hours and have flushing toilets.
