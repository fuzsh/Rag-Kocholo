Your light will always shine brightly in the U.P. Love you. Trudy Elmquist\"\n\n-TRUDY L ELMQUIST\n\n\"Our dear Lord has called you home to rest. You are truly missed. Thank you for sharing all your love with so many in the Escanaba area and beyond. Your light will always shine brightly in the U.P. Love you. Trudy Elmquist\"\n\n-TRUDY L ELMQUIST\n\n\"It was an honor to work with You, Fr. Norden. Your presence, wisdom and wit were blessings in difficult situations. Thank you for your life-long dedication to service to God and country. May your reunion with family and friends be beyond your faith-filled expectations.\"\n\n-Linda Lanasa, PA-C, Retired\n\n\"Thank you dear Fr. Emmett for sharing your life and love to us specially at the Bishop Noa Home. You were always available to celebrate the Eucharist and to minister the Sacrament of the Sick at any given time. You showed the face of God to many people you encountered when you were with us. You enjoy Godâ€™s peace. Till we meet again. Please pray for us. \"\n\n-Sr. Eden Orlino, SPC\n\n\"To the family of Father Emmett Norden: Please know how we will miss Father Emmett and his friendship to our family for so many years. He recently stepped in to say my Mom's funeral mass in January of this year. He braved an ice storm to get to the church and told me how honored he was to be asked to do it. He is a blessing to so many and to our communities in the Upper Peninsula. Rest in peace, Father Emmett. What a life well lived.\"\n\n-Sally A Johnson\n\n\"Dear Fr Norden, I learned of your passing almost right away, but couldn't find your obituary until today, 07nov2020. You were an awesome servant to many, including us Kidds and Dahns. You have earned your rest. We will be paying our respects to you, kind Sir, very soon. Rest In Eternal Peace, until we meet again. ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹ â¤ðŸ’™\"\n\n-John & Jan (Kidd) Dahn\n\n\"Saddened to hear of Fatherâ€™s death. I worked with him for many, many years and frequently called on him for his assistance and he never let me, or the family I was assisting, down. He was a credit to his calling and I bet he will continue to be !\"\n\n-Tom Zerbel\n\n\"So sad to learn of Fr. Emmett's passing. He was a kind, wonderful of a man and priest. Father was my Dad's cousin, a true jewel, a gentle soul, with a wicked sense of humor. He will be truly missed by my family. May his light shine in eternity.\"\n\n-Patty Young\n\n\"I just learned last evening that Fr. Norden had passed away. I was saddened to hear of this as I was just about ready to send him my Christmas Letter and family photo. When he was at the Assumption Parish in Iron River, my (now deceased) husband Daniel and I, credit him with helping to save our marriage thru having us both attend a Cursillo Retreat in 1975. We were married for 45 years. My husband also sang at Fr. Norden's Assumption Christmas Masses, of which he had broadcast via WIKB and recorded on tape. I was able to copy them to audio CD's for him. I so enjoyed his annual Christmas Letter and the note he added on each one. I will surely miss hearing from him. Condolences, Prayers & Blessings, Sandra Vignali Appleton, WI\"\n\n-Sandra L Vignali\n\n\"To my Uncle Emmitt, you were a compassionate and gentle soul who provided spiritual guidance to all you encountered. May the Lord protect you, as you did all who knew you. You will be dearly missed, thank you for your great sense of humor and your contagious smile, they will always be forever in my heart.\"\n\n-Martin Norden"
