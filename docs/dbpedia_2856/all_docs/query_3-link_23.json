W. James, formerly of Ohio, but for many years a good citizen of our town. Brother James was a consistent member of the Methodist church, and only a few days before his death said to his pastor, Rev. S. H. Morgan, that the way was clear and that he was ready for the Masters call He died as he had lived--quietly, peaceably and with the whole armor on. He married the beautiful Miss Annie Strunk of Oakland on the 20th day of December, 1892, and would have been 27 years old on the 30th day of September, 1894. He was a worthy member of the Masonic lodge at Oakland, and was buried in the Odd Fellows Rest [Masonic Cemetery] at Weimar on Sunday evening with Masonic honors. A large concourse of friends followed his remains to his last resting place. Brother James was a prominent merchant of our town and his dealings were characteristic of his life--fair and honest. He leaves a heart-broken wife and a sweet baby boy 10 months old, and a host of sorrowing friends to mourn his death. Although our hearts are bereft, yet we rejoice that our loved ones are safe in the Masters fold, and at the last day we may claim our own. To the bereaved ones we would say look up to the source from whence comes all our blessings. Though the trial seems hard, yet the Lord tempers the wind to the shorn lamb. May the grace of God comfort the widow, nourish and sustain the orphan, and console the bereaved, is the prayer of one of Joes best friends.

T. Hancock and insisted upon being locked up in jail to prevent his doing violence, saying that he was subject to attacks of insanity, and when in that condition was inclined to do violence to his family; that he had a good wife and good children and wished to be imprisoned so that he could do them no damage; also that he desired to be treated and cured of his insanity.\n\nThe justice knew that there was awful truth in the unfortunate man’s statement as he had exhibited insane violence a short time ago, but had apparently recovered and seemed at that time to be still entirely sane. After much embarrassment and consideration the justice concluded that it would be the best to have him locked up and sent to the county authorities at Columbus.\n\nYesterday evening about 3 o’clock, when Constable Insall went to the city jail to get the volunteer prisoner to take him to Columbus, he found the man cold in death, hanging to an iron bar, with his knees almost touching the floor, his position showing that he had drawn his legs back to keep his feet from touching the floor and preventing him from choking to death.\n\nThe coroner’s verdict was in accordance with the foregoing statement.\n\nThe unfortunate man was well educated in Bohemian and German; was once a passenger conductor on a railroad in Bohemia; lost his position when his mind became unbalanced; came to this country several years ago and commenced farming, with the hope that the change would bring about his recovery. He was about fifty years old. He leaves a wife and nine children.  San Antonio Express.
