        "text": "The best way to prevent the spread of a COVID-19 infection is to avoid exposure to others, especially if your child is showing symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nKeep your child home if he shows the following symptoms:\n\nFever that is not responsive to fever-reducing medications\n\nSore throat\n\nShortness of breath from continued coughing\n\nNew loss of taste or smell\n\nNew onset of severe headache, especially with a fever\n\nDiarrhea, vomiting or abdominal pain\n\nCongestion\n\nBehavior that is not normal for your child\n\nIf your child has tested positive for COVID-19, visit the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website for the most-up-to-date isolation guidance.\n\nLearn More\n\n“Fevers are often a sign that your child is fighting off a viral or bacterial infection that could get other kids sick,”explained Deirdre Stewart, MD, an area practice director for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta Urgent Care. “Many schools require children to be fever-free without the use of medicine for at least 24 hours before returning to school.”\n\nKeep your child home if he:\n\nHas a temperature higher than 100.4°F.\n\nIs vomiting or has diarrhea.\n\nIsn’t acting like himself.\n\nHas other flu-like symptoms, such as chills or body aches.\n\nCall your child's pediatrician immediately if the fever is accompanied by:\n\nHeadache\n\nRash\n\nStiff neck\n\n“A sore throat is a common symptom of many different types of illness and can be contagious if it is due to strep throat or a virus. Your child should rest at home if persistent sore throat and see a pediatrician to determine if they need treatment with antibiotics for strep throat or recover from the virus with time and rest,\" warned Dr. Stewart.\n\nKeep your child home if:\n\nThe sore throat is accompanied by fever, headache, chills or a stomachache.\n\nHis throat and tonsils are bright red or have white spots on them.\n\nLice are an unfortunate, but common, problem for many kids. Lice are also contagious and spread through direct contact with other children. Notify your child’s school if you suspect that your child has lice.\n\n“Many schools require that students stay home until all live lice are gone,” said Dr. Stewart. “However, new recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics state that students can return to school as soon as they have been treated. Speak directly with your child’s school if you’re unclear on what they recommend.”\n\nKeep your child home if:\n\nYou notice visible signs of live lice, including yellow, tan, brown spots called nits, which can also resemble dandruff and would appear close to the scalp or on strands of hair.\n\nA fever of 100.4°F or higher is present.\n\nAt the end of the day, you know your child best. If he isn’t acting like himself, or it doesn’t seem like he could participate in school activities, trust your instincts and keep your child at home. Often, a quick call to the pediatrician can help put your mind at ease, even if your child doesn’t need to be seen.\n\nDeirdre Stewart, MD, is an area practice director for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta Urgent Care. She has been working in Urgent Care at Children’s since November 1999. Dr. Stewart maintains an undergraduate degree from Emory University, Medical School at Medical College of Georgia, and pediatric residency at Emory. She is board certified in PediAttica and a member of the AAP and Society for Pediatric Urgent Care.\n\nThis content is general information and is not specific medical advice.
