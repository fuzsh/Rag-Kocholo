        "text": "How do I know if I have raccoons?\n\nSometimes raccoons are blamed for damage they don’t do. Here are signs you have a raccoon in residence:\n\nHand-shaped tracks on light surfaces or where the ground is soft enough for their paws to leave an impression. Like bears, raccoons walk on their entire paws, not just the toes.\n\nScat about 3/4” in diameter and 2-3” long with segmenting and blunt ends. Raccoon scats vary widely in size, depending upon the raccoon’s age and in content—which is often quite evident, depending on what has been eaten.\n\nScat stations where one animal has repeatedly left scat or multiple animals have done so. Unfortunately, these are sometimes established on roofs and in attics. If feces have accumulated, follow the Centers for Disease Control’s removal recommendations or hire cleanup professionals to safely clean the latrine area.\n\nWhat should I do if I raccoon got into my house? How can I get raccoons out of my house, attic or chimney?\n\nOccasionally, a raccoon may accidentally enter your home through a pet door or other entryway with no intention of staying.\n\nNever try to catch or directly handle a raccoon. A scared raccoon may bite. The raccoon is going to be mainly concerned about getting back outside, which is helpful—you just need to show them the way!\n\nRaccoons in your home by accident\n\nNever try to catch or directly handle a raccoon. A panicked and scared raccoon may bite. The raccoon is going to be mainly concerned about getting back outside, which is helpful—you just need to show them the way!\n\nStay calm. A panicked raccoon may run further inside your house and may cause damage.\n\nContain pets in rooms away from the raccoon and close doors to other parts of the house.\n\nOpen doors and windows near the raccoon that lead outside. (A chair under a window will help the raccoon jump up.)\n\nMove quietly and slowly and try to nudge them back out by walking behind them with a vacuum cleaner or broom.\n\nIf that doesn’t work, leave the room and wait quietly for the raccoon to escape. Make a trail of marshmallows, cheese bits or fig bars leading out an open door. Sprinkle a band of flour in front of openings so you can see exiting footprints if they leave.\n\nIf the raccoon doesn’t leave after you’ve tried for several hours, call your local animal control officer for assistance.\n\nOnce the raccoon has left your home, think about how you can prevent raccoons from entering your home again. For example, if the raccoon entered through a pet door, replace the pet door with a locking or microchip-activated pet door. You can also implement our raccoon prevention techniques.\n\nRaccoons in your attic, crawl space, etc.\n\nRaccoons mate in late winter and use a wide range of natural and manmade den and resting sites that may include unprotected attics and crawlspaces.\n\nRaccoons often find their way into attics at entry points where different building materials join; this might be where dormer junctions occur, where unpainted trim board creates structural defects, or where the building material itself is pliant, such as where vinyl soffits have been used.\n\nIf raccoons are in your attic, the most humane solution is to wait until the cubs are old enough to leave the attic with mom (generally around 10 weeks old), and then seal up any entry points after you have ensured that all the raccoons have left. To determine if the raccoons have left:\n\nBlock possible entry points loosely with wadded newspaper. Leave in place for two to three days.\n\nIf the newspaper goes undisturbed, and the weather has not been particularly cold or stormy, no one is using it as an entryway. You may now seal up the entry point. Cover the entry point with 16-gauge wire mesh or metal flashing to prevent future wildlife from moving in.\n\nIf the newspaper is pushed out of place, someone has moved in, and it is not safe to seal up entry points at this time.\n\nIf waiting for the raccoons to leave on their own is not an option, you can encourage the mother to move the young on her own by creating a multi-sensory deterrent approach.\n\nJust before dusk, turn all lights on in the attic.\n\nPlace a loud radio and a bowl of cider vinegar in or around the attic.\n\nGive the mother raccoons a few days to move her cubs.\n\nAfter a few days, ensure that raccoons have left.\n\nSeal available entry points with 16-gauge wire mesh or metal flashing to prevent future wildlife from moving in.\n\nIf raccoons have occupied the space for a long time and feces have accumulated, follow the Centers for Disease Control’s removal recommendations or hire cleanup professionals to safely clean the latrine area.\n\nSome people use a “one-way door” to get raccoons out of attics or crawl spaces. Once the animals have left, they're unable to get back inside. Use of these doors is best left to humane wildlife professionals, who can make sure that mothers are not isolated from their kits. The young must be old and mobile enough to exit through the one-way door with their mother, and this can be very hard to assess.\n\nRaccoons in your chimney\n\nWhen a mother raccoon sees an uncapped chimney, she sees the perfect nursery. It’s a safe and sheltered place to give birth to and raise her young until they can get around on their own.\n\nNever use smoke or fire to try to drive animals out of chimneys! Young raccoons won't be able to climb out, and mom will stay with them. They will become trapped and die, making your removal problem far worse. The easiest and most humane approach is to wait until after they move out on their own, which they will, after which you can install a chimney cap to prevent future issues. Always ensure that all animals have vacated the chimney before installing a chimney cap.\n\nIf waiting isn't an option, you can use humane and multisensory harassment techniques to encourage the mother raccoon to move her young elsewhere:\n\nKeep the damper closed and put a loud radio (tuned to a rock or rap station) in the fireplace.\n\nPut a bowl of vinegar on a footstool near the damper.\n\nApply these deterrents just before dusk; mother raccoons may not want to move cubs in daylight. Be patient—it may take a few days for the mother to move her young.\n\nOnce the raccoons are gone, call a chimney sweep to clean the flue and install a National Fire Protection Association-approved expanded metal chimney cap so the situation doesn’t happen again.\n\nIf one is available in your area, you may also enlist the help of a humane wildlife professional who will commit to keeping the raccoon family intact and releasing within their home range by using an eviction, exclusion and reunion strategy. As soon as the raccoons are gone, call a certified chimney sweep to clean your chimney of all nesting debris, and install a chimney cap.\n\nback to top\n\nDo raccoons have rabies or other diseases?\n\nRabies\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only one human has ever died from the raccoon strain of rabies. A rabid raccoon is usually dead within 1-3 days of becoming infectious, and if you're bitten by a rabid raccoon, effective post-exposure treatment is available.\n\nIf you see a raccoon in your yard during the day, don’t panic—they’re not necessarily sick or dangerous. It's perfectly normal for raccoons to be active throughout the day. They may merely be foraging longer hours to support their young, visiting a garden while the dogs are indoors or moving to a new location.\n\nObserve the behavior of the raccoon before calling for assistance. Look for:\n\nPartial paralysis or inability to use their limbs well\n\nCircling or staggering as if drunk\n\nRepeated high-pitched vocalization\n\nSelf-mutilation\n\nActing aggressively for no reason\n\nA raccoon showing these signs may be rabid or infected with canine distemper or feline parvovirus. Call your local animal control or police department. If you made contact, seek medical attention immediately.\n\nRoundworm\n\nRoundworm (Baylisascaris) found in raccoon feces can infect humans and pets. Prevention is the key. Keep raccoons out of attics and crawl spaces, and supervise young children and pets outdoors to make sure they don’t come into contact with raccoon feces.\n\nLeptospirosis\n\nLeptospirosis is caused by a bacteria that can infect raccoons, skunks, opossums, Norway rats, mice and white-tailed deer. Humans may be exposed if they come into contact with infected urine or contaminated soil and water. Avoid touching wild animals. If contact is necessary to get a raccoon out of your house, call in a professional.\n\nback to top"
