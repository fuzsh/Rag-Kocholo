We provide an inviting resting place for families that need to stay overnight, as well as the Ronald McDonald Family Room on the 14th floor of Carilion Children's Hospital for those who need a break without leaving the hospital.\n\nWho Can Stay\n\nWays You Can Help\n\nWe can't do it without you, and we would love for you to get involved. There are many ways for you to join us in our mission to care for children by housing and caring for their families. Youâ€™ll get a great feeling helping families of sick and injured children stay close together. Check out the many ways you can help to keep families close when it matters the most."
