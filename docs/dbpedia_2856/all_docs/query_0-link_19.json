The City of Kirkland typically follows the lead of the Lake Washington School District when determining cancellations during the school year. Outside of the school year, City staff will evaluate conditions and make the appropriate decision to cancel, reschedule, or modify programs.\n\nTo evaluate air quality, we use the Environmental Protection Agency's website www.airnow.gov, along with their interactive map and smoke map to factor in local sensor data. When air quality index (AQI) reaches unhealthy levels, outdoor classes and programs will typically be canceled, rescheduled, or moved indoors. The Peter Kirk Pool will be closed, and beaches will not be staffed by lifeguards. Refunds will be considered on an individual program basis but are not guaranteed.\n\nOur Inclement Weather Hotline is: 425-587-3335\n\nKirkland’s policy is to fully comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by prohibiting discrimination against any person on the basis of race, color, national origin or sex in the provision of benefits and services resulting from its programs and activities. Any person who believes his/her Title VI protection has been violated, may file a complaint with the City. To request an alternate format, file a complaint or for questions about Kirkland’s Title VI Program, contact the Title VI Coordinator at 425-587-3011 or titlevicoordinator@kirklandwa.gov."
