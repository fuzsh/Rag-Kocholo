        "text": "American Presidents traditionally choose to be buried in their home towns, often in sight of a library built in their honor. If Donald J. Trump were to win the election, that might change. Although five of his relatives are interred in the Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery, in Middle Village, Queens, Trump has been making plans to spend eternity behind the first tee of one of the courses at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. “Wouldn’t you want to be buried here?” he told the Wall Street Journal, in 2015.\n\nIt is likely that Trump has no idea that the landscape architect of the club, whose members reportedly pay an initiation fee of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars, was a real-life version of Chance, the gardener—a twenty-four-year-old local named Andy Sick, who had no prior horticultural experience.\n\nLast week, Sick, now thirty-six and a civil-litigation lawyer and app developer who lives in Brooklyn, was sitting at a table at the Tewksbury Inn, a golfer-friendly joint down the street from the club. “It was supposed to be just this summer job before I headed off to law school. It paid seven-fifty an hour,” Sick, who has a red beard, said. “I was just a tree-cutter-downer.”\n\nThings went smoothly for three weeks, until Trump suddenly fired the golf course’s superintendent, Sick’s boss. Trump had bought the property in 2002, from investors who’d bought it from the automaker John DeLorean in a bankruptcy sale. But two years and millions of dollars later, there was still no golf course.\n\nA few days after the boss was fired, one of Trump’s golf-course architects, Tom Fazio, Jr., spotted Sick planting petunias. “He asked me if I was the landscape architect,” Sick said. “I told him yeah. My only gardening experience was mowing my parents’ lawn.”\n\nFazio told Sick to get to work, so he went home that night and Googled “French formal gardens.” “I knew Trump liked ostentatious stuff, so the gardens of Versailles were a perfect fit. I wasn’t even looking at other golf courses. I was just looking at grandiosity.” Sick ordered boxwoods and topiaries from a local nursery to frame Bedminster’s main clubhouse, DeLorean’s old Georgian-style home. He pulled up a recent photograph of the house on his cell phone. “Except for the annuals, this is all my stuff,” he said.\n\nEarly on in Sick’s planting, Trump paid a surprise visit. He loved what he saw. “Once that happened, I was given an unlimited budget,” Sick said. His ambitions quickly outgrew the local nurseries’ capacities, so he ordered tractor-trailers filled with trees from the West Coast. “Trump once spoke to one of my co-workers. He said, ‘Really good job, really good job.’ ”\n\nAfter spending between two and three hundred thousand dollars of Trump’s money, Sick got nervous. “I was worried the plants were going to die,” he said, so he e-mailed a high-school friend who had studied landscape architecture for guidance.\n\nA few months went by, and Sick, who was still earning seven-fifty an hour, decided to ask for a raise. “The new boss asked me how much I was making. I told him it didn’t matter—I wanted seventy-five to a hundred dollars an hour. He agreed to a hundred.” At the end of the summer, Sick had to quit to start his first year of law school, at Syracuse.\n\nTrump ended up liking the golf club so much that, in 2007, he filed plans with Somerset County to build a family mausoleum there, decorated with nineteen-foot-tall stone obelisks. Local authorities were skeptical, and Bedminster’s mayor, Robert Holtaway, argued before the city council that a Trump grave could attract the wrong sort of people, comparing it to a place “in Austria where a Nazi war criminal was buried” that “became a tourist attraction.”\n\nIn 2009, as the mausoleum debate raged, Ivanka Trump married Jared Kushner at the Bedminster club, surrounded by Sick’s Versailles-inspired boxwoods. More recently, the club has served as Trump’s debate-prep war room, where Kushner, Rudy Giuliani, Roger Ailes, and Kellyanne Conway coached him to take on Clinton. Last summer, with the permits finally secured, Trump broke ground on the tomb. When the work began, Fox News reported on the development with a headline that would be hard for any editor to resist: “Trump Is Digging His Own Grave.” ♦"
