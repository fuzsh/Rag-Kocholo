He's famous for his bodybuilding, but his fans are definitely not limited to the bodybuilding industry. Schwarzenegger is arguably the most influential bodybuilder in the bodybuilding world. Schwarzenegger is a pioneer and a leader for the ages. He broke the mold and changed the criteria for bodybuilding competitions. After all, bodybuilding was a niche sport in the 1960s, when bodybuilders learned their lessons in mountain roads and respected the statues of ancient Greece. Schwarzenegger's appearance seemed to tell the judges at that time: I come from the future, my body is the future of bodybuilding trend. Not many people know much about bodybuilding, but when it comes to Schwarzenegger, almost everyone does. No wonder many people say he is the god of bodybuilding. Schwarzenegger is a seven-time Olympia champion in bodybuilding. Although Ronnie and Sith have achieved the same results as Schwarzenegger and even surpassed him in muscle size, they still can't match his impact. Schwarzenegger rose to fame as a bodybuilder, riding his fame into film, as a businessman, and as a governor. It is because of his multi-faceted development, he can make a greater contribution to the sport of bodybuilding. Because, if you're just working out, people might not know. But people who have seen Schwarzenegger's movies may know a thing or two about bodybuilding, and the publicity effect on bodybuilding will be greater. Schwarzenegger is a promoter of the bodybuilding industry. Arnold's birth (no accident, of course) sparked a global fitness craze. After winning several Olympic titles, Schwarzenegger went to Hollywood. Because of Hollywood, Schwarzenegger successfully jumped out of the fitness and bodybuilding industry pattern, more people around the world know Schwarzenegger, indirectly promote the bodybuilding movement.\n\n\"Level\" is no longer the word. After all, in the 1970s and 1980s, there was no such a complete training system, far behind the 21st century. And science and technology complement each other, drugs are widely used and abused. Schwarzenegger also acknowledged that in those days, all medications were taken in milligrams a week. Now those bodybuilders, come on, are dozens of times as many as before, by the day, there are also special medicine men desperately trying to get bigger. The most obvious is that the frog's belly (Orsay's belly) is large. Arnold Schwarzenegger (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the legend, the youngest teacher in the history of the universe, the 7th Olympia bodybuilding teacher competition champion. He changed the standard of judging, ushering in a new era, an epochal figure! Irreplaceable, great influence, promote the development of bodybuilding! Even influenced a generation! I have been engaged in fitness, politics, business, acting all my life, have done very well! Q: How many people can do that in a row? The influence of the Terminator portrayed on the movie screen will never be forgotten.\n\nIt can be said that keeping a constant fitness routine is Arnold's rule of thumb to maintain a perfect figure ~! Arnold was born in Austria on July 30, 1947, and became an American citizen in 1983. In 1962, when he was 15 years old, his height had reached 1.88m, his weight was 75kg, his upper arm was 30cm, his chest was 94cm, his waist was 76cm, his thigh was 51cm and his calf was 38cm. At first, lacking expert guidance, he collected and read a large number of bodybuilding magazines to learn training methods and nutritional guidance. Arnold first entered the National bodybuilding competition in Graz, Austria, in 1963 at the age of 16. In 1966, at the age of 19, Arnold won the title \"Teacher of Europe\" at the European Bodybuilding Championships in Germany. In the same year, he participated in the international bodybuilding competition and won the title of \"Master of the Universe\" for the first time. He was nicknamed the Austrian Oak. After 1968, Benved discovered that Arnold was a gifted bodybuilder and brought him back from Austria to the United States for intensive mentoring and scientific training. In 1969, he competed in the Olympia Teacher competition for the first time and lost to Sergio Oliva of Cuba due to a lack of proper training and nutrition. In 1970, he defeated Oliva by an absolute margin and won the Olympia Teacher title. After that, in 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1980, he was awarded the \"Olympia\" teacher title seven times in a row, known as the \"king of Kings\" in the bodybuilding community. At that time, his body was already at its peak, weighing 104.5kg, with an upper arm circumference of 57cm, a chest circumference of 144cm, a waist circumference of 81cm, a thigh circumference of 71cm and a calf circumference of 46cm. Arnold Schwarzenegger is now an American billionaire. He made his first appearance in a film shot in Hollywood since 1970. His acting talent, unmatched muscles and strong physique made him an instant hit. When Schwarzenegger was young, his father wanted him to play soccer, but he fell in love with weightlifting and bodybuilding. He was so committed that his parents limited his gym visits to three times a week for fear of overdoing it, but he converted an unheated room into a gym to continue working out. He said, 'I have a strict training schedule, diet and game plan, and I always write it out. 'I don't see any slack in the mirror, and I can't go against my plan. 'Worked tirelessly to make Schwarzenegger the most famous bodybuilder. Prior to the film he had received eight Olympic Teacher awards and five Global Bodybuilding Teacher awards."
