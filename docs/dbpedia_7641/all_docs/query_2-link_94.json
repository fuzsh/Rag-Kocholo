        "text": "The following post comes from the immensely talented Erny Peibst of jackednatural.com. If you’re looking for advice on the best natural supplements to take or simply a review of the latest training trends, I highly recommend it.\n\nGuys who’ve just hopped on the bodybuilding bandwagon might have heard of legendary names such as Ronnie Colemanand Dorian Yates whispered from the shadows in their local gyms…\n\nBut how good really were these guys?\n\nAnd more importantly…who was the best bodybuilder ever?\n\nIf you’ve decided to become a bodybuilder, you owe it to yourself to know who the king of this sport was.\n\nBut the answer to this question all depends on how you define the ‘best bodybuilder ever’.\n\nHere’s a few ways to judge who the best bodybuilder of all time is:\n\nWho won the most Mr Olympia titles\n\nWho’s made the most impact on the sport\n\nThe most aesthetic guy\n\nThe biggest and most shredded guy of all\n\nThe most Mr Olympia titles – Lee Haney and Ronnie Coleman (8x)\n\nWho had the biggest impact on bodybuilding – Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was the star in Pumping Iron. If you haven’t already seen it, order it off amazon…like straight after you finish reading this article, it’s amazing.\n\nThe most aesthetic Mr Olympia – Arnold, Franco Columbo, Frank Zane or Lee Haney.\n\nThe biggest & most shredded: Ronnie Coleman or Phil Heath.\n\nSo it depends how you interpret the question ‘who is the best bodybuilder ever’.\n\nHowever, Arnold Schwarzenegger is regarded by many as the greatest ever.\n\nWhy?\n\nHe won 7 Sandow trophies\n\nHe changed the world’s opinion on bodybuilding; from being disgusted to intrigued.\n\nHe built one of the greatest physiques of all time. Huge mass with a tiny waist – a look that’s still highly coveted by gym rats to this day (50 years later).\n\nArnie sounds like a worthy choice to me.\n\nHowever, for entertainment purposes I’m going to select the top 5 bodybuilders of all time, and put them on stage against each other.\n\n…So you can decide for yourself!\n\nThe Best vs Each Other\n\nThe 5 bodybuilders I’ve picked are: Lee Haney, Ronnie Coleman, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Phil Heath and Dorian Yates. These are the top 5 most successful bodybuilders of all time; winning the most titles.\n\nNote: It’s a little unfair to compare each champion on stage as they’re all from different era’s.\n\nAs you know, bodybuilding has evolved over the years in terms of knowledge on nutrition, training and supplements. Also new steroids have been invented, such as human growth hormone. Synthetic HGH has only been available in the last 30 years.\n\nSo the guys today do have somewhat of an advantage.\n\nDespite it not being a level playing field, I’ll judge the 5 bodybuilders on each of the 7 compulsory poses:\n\nFront Double Biceps\n\nFront Lat Spread\n\nSide Chest\n\nBack Double Biceps\n\nBack Lat Spread\n\nSide Triceps\n\nFront Abdominal-Thigh\n\nThen I’ll give a placing of 1-5 of who I think’s the best and worst.\n\n1st place = 5 points.\n\n2nd = 3 points\n\n3rd = 2 points.\n\nThe highest points total wins.\n\nI’ll take into account their size and conditioning. Another thing I’ll observe is aesthetics; which judges don’t take score on today.\n\nSo if I see Ronnie’s steroid gut in any pictures then marks will be deducted.\n\n…The same goes for you Dorian.\n\nEqually if a bodybuilder is seen displaying a tiny waist or performing a vacuum, they’ll be marked generously.\n\n…That moment when Frank Zane realises he didn’t make the top 5.\n\nLet the battles commence! Who will come out on top as the best bodybuilder ever?\n\nFront Double Biceps\n\nArnold – 5pts\n\nLee Haney – 3pts\n\nPhil Heath – 2pts\n\nRonnie Coleman\n\nDorian Yates\n\nArnold’s huge biceps and slightly better conditioning over Lee Haney gives him top spot.\n\nLee Haney’s excellent conditioning and vacuum earns him second spot.\n\nPhil Heath’s superior conditioning to Ronnie Coleman earns him third, despite Ronnie being considerably bigger. Ronnie is seen with a bit of bloat in this pose too.\n\nNot a great pose for Dorian who lacks detail in his arms and mid-section.\n\nFront Lat Spread\n\nLee Haney – 5pts\n\nRonnie Coleman – 3pts\n\nDorian Yates – 2pts\n\nPhil Heath\n\nArnold\n\nLee Haney just, and I mean just, beats Ronnie Coleman due to slightly better conditioning and the fact that he’s doing a vacuum and Ronnie’s gut is still visible. However Ronnie does have considerably more size so it was super close.\n\nDorian Yates just edges out Phil Heath due to better lat development, even though Phil has better conditioning.\n\nAnd Arnold is 5th, where he has the weakest back development.\n\nSide Chest\n\nArnold – 5pts\n\nPhil Heath – 3pts\n\nRonnie Coleman – 2pts\n\nDorian Yates\n\nLee Haney\n\nThis is a controversial one between Arnold and Phil, where Phil can feel hard-done by. Phil is better conditioned, but Arnold’s huge mass in his pecs just edges it.\n\nPhil is simply more shredded than Ronnie in this pose, with better detail especially in his delts and hamstrings.\n\nDorian beats Haney in the mass department, although Haney appears leaner.\n\nBack Double Biceps\n\nPhil Heath – 5pts\n\nLee Haney – 3pts\n\nRonnie Coleman — 2pts\n\nArnold\n\nDorian Yates\n\nThis was quite an easy win for Phil. Disregarding the shadows and the lighting, his back has the best conditioning, coupled with good size.\n\nHaney comes second, beating Ronnie on definition and Arnold on mass in the lats.\n\nRonnie just beats Arnold through sheer size.\n\nAnd Arnold’s shredded back is preferred over Dorian’s huge mass, which lacks detail.\n\n*Apologies for not showing the hamstrings in this comparison pic, some of the images only displayed their torso’s.\n\nBack Lat Spread\n\nPhil Heath – 5pts\n\nRonnie Coleman – 3pts\n\nDorian Yates – 2pts\n\nLee Haney\n\nArnold\n\nPhil edges out Ronnie to win 1st place, with Phil having better conditioning once again.\n\nRonnie’s monster size wins him second place.\n\nDorian has better detail than Lee Haney, as well as more hamstring definition giving him 3rd.\n\nHaney has more width than Arnold, giving him 4th spot.\n\nSide Triceps\n\nLee Haney – 5pts\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger – 3pts\n\nDorian Yates – 2pts\n\nRonnie Coleman\n\nPhil Heath\n\nLee Haney wins this one, as he has the best detail in his triceps, whilst displaying a very narrow waist.\n\nArnold has less definition compared to Haney, but beats Dorian to second spot as he’s performing a vacuum and Dorian is bloated.\n\nDorian’s excellent detail in his triceps beats Ronnie and Phil to third place. This can be attributed to his perfect horse-shoe detail, which is more visible because he has straightened his arm out more (compared to Phil), giving a better contraction.\n\nRonnie outmuscles Phil to take 4th spot.\n\nThis is a particularly strong pose for all of these bodybuilders, where the lower placed guys are still looking extremely good\n\nFront Abdominal-Thigh\n\nArnold – 5pts\n\nLee Haney – 3pts\n\nPhil Heath – 2pts\n\nDorian Yates\n\nRonnie Coleman\n\nI couldn’t get any images of Arnold or Lee doing the ab-thigh poses, so I’m looking at their abdominal/thigh definition in these photos and judging as if they were tensing both of these muscles.\n\nArnold’s slightly better conditioning wins him top spot over Lee Haney. Also I’ve seen Lee Haney when he’s not doing a vacuum, where he’s tensing his abs instead and they aren’t as defined as Arnold’s.\n\nLee’s superior abdominal conditioning earns him second ahead of Phil.\n\nPhil just clinches 3rd place due to phenomenal thigh detail. Although Dorian’s abs are more ripped than Phil’s, the definition in his legs lets him down.\n\nAlthough Ronnie had superb definition in his thighs, the fact he looks pregnant almost guarantees him a last place for this pose. Not to mention you can only just see his abs.\n\nTotal Points\n\nLee Haney – 19pts\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger – 18pts\n\nPhil Heath – 17pts\n\nRonnie Coleman – 10pts\n\nDorian Yates – 6pts\n\nIt’s a shock! Lee Haney is victorious, beating Arnold to 1st place by a single point.\n\nArnold won 3 of the pose-rounds, while Haney won just 2.\n\nHowever, Arnold placed outside the top 3 in the back poses which was a weak muscle group for him.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s very surprising (to me) that old-school bodybuilding greats, such as Lee and Arnold, who graced the stage 30/40 years ago; could kick it against the best modern day bodybuilders…and come out on top.\n\nThey were able to do this due to their superior muscle definition, compared to their rivals.\n\nHow were they able to be more defined?\n\nI believe that because the old-school bodybuilders were on lower doses of steroids, which meant they didn’t retain as much water as modern day pros.\n\nNote: I did mark on aesthetics, taking into account steroid guts/tiny waists, which modern day judges don’t do. If I didn’t do this, it probably would’ve been a different outcome. Ronnie would’ve placed higher and Arnold/Lee Haney would’ve placed a little lower.\n\nSo, Who is the Best Bodybuilder Ever?\n\nAs previously stated, it depends on how you choose to answer this question. For some, the best bodybuilder ever is the guy who wins the most titles. In which case, it’s a quantifiable answer…a numbers game.\n\nFor me, the best bodybuilder ever is the one who had the greatest body.\n\nAnd at the same time conquered his era by becoming a great champion.\n\nSo IMO Arnold is the greatest bodybuilder of all time because he had the most definition, huge mass and a tiny waist.\n\nThe difference between Haney and Arnold, for me, is that Arnold had slightly more definition. Also the Austrian Oak had better proportions.\n\nFor example, Arnold had the greatest arms in bodybuilding history. Lee didn’t.\n\nAnd having huge arms will make you look more aesthetic.\n\nAesthetic as fua*k = spaghetti arms.\n\n…Said no one ever.\n\nDo you think I scored each pose-round accurately?
