        "text": "4.     Schwarzenegger is an actor, politician, business man, investor, and a former professional bodybuilder Began weight training at the age of fifteen. Won his first Mr. Olympia title at age twenty and went on to win the Mr. Olympia contest seven times Elected on 12-7-2003 as Governor of California and served two terms\n\n5.    Born in Thal, Austria to Gustav Schwarzenegger and Aurelia Jadrny on July 30, 1947. His father was the local police chief and later served Germany in World War II until he was discharged with malaria. Both of his parents were very strict and Arnold suffered a good deal of abuse from his father who also blatantly favored his older brother, Meinhard, in his youth.\n\n6.    As a boy, Arnold was very active in athletics. He chose to pursue bodybuilding at age 14 over soccer. He began training with Dan Farmer and doing Olympic weight lifting at this time. He also studied psychology during this time to gain a competitive edge. His competitive career began shortly thereafter when he was 17.\n\n7.    Schwarzenegger briefly served in the Austrian Army in 1965 and did a week in military prison for going AWOL to attend a bodybuilding competition In 1966 he flew for the first time to London where he came in second in the Mr. Universe competition Through access to better coaching, he won the competition in 1967, becoming the youngest Mr. Universe ever at age 20\n\n8.   He went on to win the Mr. Universe competition a further three times To accomplish this feat, he trained four to six hours a day while attending business school and working\n\n9.    Schwarzenneger’s dream of living in the United States became a reality paved by bodybuilding in September 1968 He met many important people as he affiliated himself with Gold’s Gym and Joe Weider as he improved his English In 1970 at age 23, Arnold won the Mr. Olympia contest for the first time. A prize he would claim a total of seven times.\n\n10.   In 1977, Arnold’s autobiography and weight training guide titled Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder was published and became successful alongside the film that really boosted his profile Pumping Iron. In 1979, Arnold mastered the English language and completed a BA in international marketing of fitness and business administration from the University of Wisconsin-Superior\n\n11.   As an actor, Arnold netted millions of dollars and became an international star. He won a Golden Globe in 1977 for Stay Hungry and won the MTV award for Best Male Performance in 1992 for Terminator 2: Judgment Day which was also that year’s highest grossing film His first political appointment was in 1990 as the chairman of President Bush’s President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. He later went on to be a two term Governor of California from 2003 to 2011\n\n12.  Arnold has dabbled in operating several businesses, real estate investing, and even invested in Planet Hollywood at its inception. All of these ventures combined with his aforementioned feats have garnered him a reported net worth of up to 800 million dollars\n\n13. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s success story is not typical. His uncanny success was spring boarded by hard work and determination that he forged through fitness. As such, I think he is the highest example of the fortitude that can be tempered by developing a strong mind and body. As such, in any conversation regarding the history of fitness and famous names that come to mind within the subject, it is my opinion that Arnold should be discussed in great detail and with great acclaim"
