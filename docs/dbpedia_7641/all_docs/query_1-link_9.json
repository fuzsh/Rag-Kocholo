        "text": "BRITISH BODYBUILDERS, STRONGMEN, trainers, and all other manner of fitness enthusiasts descending on Birmingham in England this weekend for the 2024 Arnold Sports Festival UK. Event founder Arnold Schwarzenegger himself is in attendance and will be congratulating the winners of the physique shows—but in between events, he's trying out some of the exhibitors' gym equipment for himself.\n\nAnd in a new TikTok video that he reshared to Instagram Reels, Schwarzenegger found the perfect workout buddy for the festival: legendary competitive bodybuilder Phil Heath, who joined him in pumping iron on the convention center floor.\n\nSchwarzenegger captioned the post \"When 14 Mr. Olympias walk into the @arnoldexpouk,\" referring to his and Heath's 14 shared Mr. Olympia titles. They both won the competition—widely considered the most prestigious event and highest honor in the world of professional bodybuilding—seven times each, tying in second place for most wins, after eight-time winners Ronnie Coleman and Lee Haney.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Arnold Schwarzenegger (@schwarzenegger)\n\nSchwarzenegger, now 76, dominated the Mr. Olympia competition during his bodybuilding heyday, winning six years in a row from 1970 to 1975 before retiring from the sport and focusing on building his burgeoning acting career. For context, all of this was before Heath was even born. Schwarzenegger's seventh and final Mr. Olympia win came during his brief bodybuilding comeback in 1980, when Heath was just one year old.\n\n44-year-old Heath's seven wins obviously came much later; he held the title every year from 2011 to 2017, and last competed in the event in 2020, where he placed third."
