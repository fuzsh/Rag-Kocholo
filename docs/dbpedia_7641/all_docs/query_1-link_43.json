        "text": "Why do people consider Arnold Schwarzenegger to be the greatest bodybuilder ever when modern day bodybuilding champs are much bigger and more muscular than him?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is one of the most iconic figures in bodybuilding history. He has boosted the profile of professional bodybuilding more than any other winner of Mr. Olympia. He has a total of 7 Olympia titles, after only Ronnie Coleman and Lee Haney at 8.\n\nIn his time of bodybuilding that we nor know as golden era of bodybuilding\n\nThere were no modern machines, suppliments,and steroids and all.\n\nHis body is the result of pure hard work that he put into the metals.\n\nHe forged his body by himself without any help.\n\nIn my opinion here are some more reasons why he's the greatest of all time:\n\n1. As a bodybuilder - No. The man has 7 Olympias to his name and it can be argued he's the one who pushed bodybuilding to center stage. He inspired and continues to inspire millions. There hasn't been another one like him since, although much better bodybuilders have been crowned Olympia since IMO.\n\n2. As an actor - well he's not a very good actor. And everyone knows it. I don't think there's any misalignment here.\n\n3. As a Governor - I wouldn't know enough to comment here as my knowledge of American politics is superficial. But again, I really haven't heard anyone marvel at his political or administrative acumen.\n\n4. As an inspiring figure - this is deserved, I think. To see his humble origins and how he worked his ass off to get to where he is, there's no doubt he's the real deal."
