        "text": "How Tracking Your Nutrition Relates to Business and Personal Development\n\nIt’s no secret that bodybuilders like Arnold Schwarzenegger have become incredibly successful in a variety of other fields. Maybe it’s partly because of the lessons they learned while pumping iron and training for the stage.\n\nWe know that bodybuilders, powerlifters, fitness models and other athletes usually keep track of their nutrition every day, planning and recording the exact amount of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates that they consume.\n\nWait- how does this relate to personal success?\n\nWell, these athletes construct, and then implement, a delicate nutritional balance that fits their goals, whether they want increased strength, size, endurance, or performance on the playing field.\n\nWhat does this have to do with business and life? A lot, actually. If you’re not dividing your available time into the different aspects of your goal, and then tracking it, you could be losing out on productivity.\n\n1. Partitioning Your Work Like You Partition Your Calories\n\nImagine you’re starting a business, and you need to decide how to effectively spend your time. Much like a bodybuilder on his or her first bulking season, you’re looking to gain clients, partners, and investors, and increase your visibility, profits, and brand equity.\n\nProduct development is your protein; unless you have it, you won’t gain muscle, fat is your customer service; you may not need to devote much time to it, but your business will grow without it, and carbs are your sales and marketing; you need a ton of it to grow, especially at first, but eventually, you can maintain your business with somewhat less, depending on the conditions.\n\n2. Partitioning Your Personal Life to Feed Your Body, Mind, and Social Life\n\nYour business, much like a human body, is a living organism, and needs the proper nutrition to sustain itself. However, the nutrition analogy can also be applied to personal time management as well.\n\nIn this situation, perhaps working on important personal or career goals is your protein, as you need it to grow and develop as an individual, fat is getting enough sleep; you may not need too much, but you’ll die without it, and carbs is your time spent developing new relationships; at first you will need to work to surround yourself with a variety of supportive people in your life, but once you have a good amount, you may not need to spend as much time meeting and attracting new people to your inner circle.\n\n3. Increasing Business Efficiency: Shedding the Excess Fat\n\nIf starting a new business for the first time is like a bodybuilder’s first bulking season, what is a bodybuilder’s cutting phase? When bodybuilders or physique competitors prepare for a contest, they eat less food, and usually cut down on the amount of carbs and fats they consume in order to lose weight.\n\nEmbracing minimalism would probably be the most effective comparison here. Perhaps you want to sell or downsize your business; in that case you might consider applying the 80/20 rule and cutting down on the clients that cause you the most time but give you the most business, your least effective marketing campaigns, and the products or services on which you make the lowest profit margin.\n\nSure, you’ll make less profit, but you’ll also work less, your margins will improve, and you’ll be able to better focus on the products, services, and clients that give you the most value.\n\nIn terms of personal development, a cutting phase can also work wonders. Perhaps you are focusing on too many goals, and you want to focus on just one or two. Or, you might be investing your time networking with a lot of people, only a few of which you actually enjoy spending time with."
