        "text": "Some people have wondered what Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing at a high quality business seminar. He is well-known for being a great bodybuilder and movie star but has he really something to tell for business audience as well?\n\nThe answer is: Yes, he surely has. If you haven’t read his book Total Recall, I strongly recommend you to do so. His life story is one of an extraordinary achievement. The most amazing part for me is that Arnold has achieved unbelievable things in totally different and separate fields: acting, bodybuilding, politics, business, investing and philanthropy. You name it. And the most intriguing about his achievements is that he has always gone to the very top of each field by using his own success rules. This man is the professional of achievement.\n\nOne thing Arnold has always had is his intense drive to win. He says: ”There are some people that just like to kick back and coast through life and others want to be very intense and want to be number one and want to be successful. And that’s like me.” He continues: ”I always wanted to be very intense, I always wanted to be number one.”\n\nI always wanted to be very intense, I always wanted to be number one. – Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nThis certainly means a lot of hard work. And Arnold has definitely worked hard. His statement about the beginning of his bodybuilding career tells a lot: ”It would make me sick to miss a workout… I knew I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn’t do it.” One of Arnold´s success rules is: work your butt off. He didn’t want ever to lose because he hadn’t worked hard enough. ”Just remember, you can’t climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets”, as Arnold says.\n\nAnother rule for this legend is that you should give back. Arnold believes in doing good and sees that helping people will bring you more satisfaction than anything else you have ever done. He has once said that ”I can tell you, playing a game of chess with an eight-year-old kid in an inner city school is far more exciting for me than walking down another red carpet or a movie premiere.” He also puts his action where his mouth is. For example, he has been involved in Special Olympics for many years. He is the founder of ICG which provides cultural, educational and community enrichment programming to youth. ICG serves over 250,000 children in the USA.\n\nSo Arnold has a story to tell, a real life story. He has used certain principles which have guided his way to the top, time after time. If you don´t know anything yet about his accomplishments, you should read the introduction we’ve made about him. ."
