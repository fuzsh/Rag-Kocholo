        "text": "I don`t think this man needs any introduction. He single-handedly brought bodybuilding to the world that never liked 'muscular freaks'. He converted the haters into lovers. Whether you are from India or any part of the world, you know who Arnold Schwarzenegger is. His name, his physique, his attitude, his persona made bodybuilding the sport that it is today. Bodybuilding didn't make Arnold, Arnold made bodybuilding. From the dungeon like underground gyms to gyms so fancy that they will make your jaw drop, had Arnold not been there in the first place, we'd all probably just be fat. The thing is, Arnold never was only a bodybuilder. He was more than that, much more.\n\nA few facts about the legend\n\n1. Served two terms as The Governor of California.\n\n2. Has starred over 30 Hollywood movies as a lead actor.\n\n3. Youngest ever Mr.Olympia at the age of 23 in 1970. This is a record which he still holds in 2017.\n\n4. He won Mr Olympia 7 times in total- from 1970-75. With a desire to win Mr Olympia one last time, he made a comeback in 1980 and was successful.\n\nNot many know that he was also a powerlifter in his younger days. His best lifts were\n\nSquat – 545 lb (247 kg)\n\nBench Press– 520 lb (240 kg)\n\nDeadlift– 710 lb (320 kg)\n\nA Legendary Documentary That Will Never Fade Away\n\nAnother thing that made Arnold a household name was the great Bodybuilding documentary released in 1977 called 'Pumping Iron'. It was shot during the 100 days leading up to the 1975 Mr. Olympia and Mr. Universe. The film basically revolves around Arnold Schwarzenegger and his toughest rival in 1975 Mr. Olympia title-'Lou Ferrigno'. Lou Ferrigno is the same guy who played 'The Hulk' in American television series 'The Incredible Hulk'.\n\nThe film explored the then very niche cult of bodybuilding. Nobody thought that it would go on to become the legendary cult film it is today. Right from the competitors' personal lives to their training philosophies, 'Pumping Iron' showed everything that led up to the 1975 Mr. Olympia, where Arnold reigned supreme. Arnold secured the first position while his closest competitor Lou Ferrigno was placed 3rd. The film was released two years after the 1975 Mr. Olympia because of lack of funds needed for post production. The movie was a huge box office success making Arnold famous worldwide and the makers, rich. Not just Arnold, this movie proved to be a boon to the sport of bodybuilding on a whole. It popularized the culture of bodybuilding and what followed was a rapid increase in the number of commercial gyms in US and rest of the world alike.\n\nArnold's Take On Anabolic Steroids\n\nArnold was honest enough to admit that he was using Performance Enhancing Drugs (when they were legal) unlike many fake natural fitness models and bodybuilders nowadays.\n\nIn Arnold`s own words -\n\n\"I will not speak for my colleagues but I will write about my experience with tissue-building drugs. Yes, I have used them, but no, they didn't make me what I am. Anabolic steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest”. (Source-Dope: A History of Performance Enhancement in Sports from the Nineteenth Century to Today)\n\nWhen A Bodybuilder Picks up A Pen\n\nBodybuilding, acting and a veteran politician were not the only things he proved himself at. He has also written more than 5 books on bodybuilding with 'The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding' being the most famous. Arnold talked about exercise, nutrition, supplements, psychology, training methods, injury and recovery in this book, in detail. It is one of the highest selling books on the subject of bodybuilding. His autobiography 'Total Recall' was released in 2012. In this book, he talks exclusively about three major chapters of his life– as a bodybuilder, actor and governor.\n\nSome Of His Quotes That Are Etched In Stone\n\n\"Stay hungry, stay healthy, be a gentleman, believe strongly in yourself and go beyond limitations.\"\n\n\"I do the same exercises I did 50 years ago and they still work. I eat the same food I ate 50 years ago and it still works.\"\n\n\"It's simple, if it jiggles, it is fat.\"\n\n“Milk is for babies. When you grow up you have to drink beer.”\n\n\"The greatest feeling you can get in a gym or the most satisfying feeling you can get in the gym is the pump. It's as satisfying to me as cumming is” (from the movie”Pumping iron”)."
