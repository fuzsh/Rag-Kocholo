        "text": "In his latest book, \"Be Useful,\" Arnold Schwarzenegger brings up a crucial point that resonated with me. He emphasizes, both in his interviews and his Netflix documentary, that he is not a self-made man. This acknowledgment struck a chord with me because it highlights the undeniable truth that people need other people to achieve greatness. Schwarzenegger, known for his achievements in bodybuilding, acting, and politics, acknowledges that although the work is on him, he cannot achieve greatness without the support and guidance of others. Take bodybuilding, for example. To become a successful bodybuilder, one needs trainers, mentors, and competitions to showcase their skills. Similarly, Schwarzenegger's success as an action hero in Hollywood required the collaboration of directors, producers, and various other professionals to hone his acting skills. Even in his successful political career, Schwarzenegger acknowledges that he couldn't have achieved his goals without the support of the people. This awareness of the contributions of others is a valuable reminder that success is not a solitary journey. As we enter the season of giving, it is the perfect time to express our gratitude to those who have helped us along the way. These are the individuals who have stood up for us, opened doors, provided feedback, reassurance, and guidance when we needed it the most. Reach out to these people and let them know how grateful you are for their camaraderie, guidance, and love. This season is an opportunity to reflect on the wonderful person you have become, thanks to the support of others. So, as we embrace the spirit of giving, let us remember that we are not self-made. Our successes are the result of the collective efforts of those who have been there for us. Take a moment to express your gratitude and show appreciation to the people who have played a significant role in your journey. Remember, success isn't just about your individual efforts. It's about the connections we create, the support we receive, and the appreciation we show along the way. #beuseful #arnoldschwarzenegger #terminator #GoverNator #Ubuntu #ManifestYourGreatness #lifteachotherup #gratitute #ittakesavillage\n\n\"Be Useful\" Arnold Schwarzenegger's latest book offers invaluable lessons for success. 📚 I recently enjoyed listening to Arnold narrate his book and a couple of pieces of advice really resonated with me: 🔄 Learn from your mistakes and then say: 'I'll be back!' Arnold discusses 'Amor Fati' and 'Negativity Bias.' While I understand that making the best of every situation can be challenging, I agree that dwelling on negativity is a waste of time. Shifting our perspective to find the positive in every circumstance can make a significant difference. I'm particularly inspired when he emphasizes, \"I don't just want to survive; I want to thrive… And I want you to thrive too!\" 🌱 Life isn't zero-sum. We can all grow together. Arnold's understanding of not being a self-made individual, despite his hard work, discipline, dedication, and motivation, is truly remarkable. His gratitude for those who inspired him or supported him in achieving his goals is a testament to the power of collaboration. His call to honor those who came before us and to be useful by helping and guiding others is genuinely inspiring. We can all find success in our unique ways and timeframes, and I'm excited to rise by lifting others! 💪🚀 #Success #Inspiration #Growth #GiveBack #BeUseful #LiftingOthers\n\n🎭The Power of Purpose: What Will Your Verse Be? 📜 In the film “Dead Poets Society,” there’s a powerful moment when Robin Williams’ character, Mr. Keating, challenges his students with the question: “What will your verse be?” It’s a reminder that each of us has the power to shape our own destiny and leave a meaningful mark on the world. As professionals, we’re all part of the larger narrative of our industries, companies, and communities. But beyond the roles we play, there lies a deeper inquiry: Why? Why do we show up every day? Why do we strive for excellence? Why do we contribute? In a world filled with uncertainty and challenges, it’s easy to feel like a small voice in a vast sea of noise. But remember, every action, every decision, every word we speak has the potential to make a difference – to inspire, to motivate, to create change. The “why” is our compass. 🧭When we understand our “why,” our path becomes clearer. It’s not just about what we do; it’s about why we do it. Purpose fuels our journey. ❓Mr. Keating’s question isn’t merely about writing verses; it’s about leaving an indelible mark. What legacy do we want to create? 〰️Purposeful actions ripple outward. When we align with our “why,” our contributions resonate beyond ourselves. 🌊Think of your verse as a ripple in a pond. Will it be a gentle whisper or a powerful wave? 🌈Our “why” inspires others. It motivates colleagues, team members, and future generations. Imagine a workplace where everyone knows their verse – a symphony of purpose. So, as we navigate the twists and turns of our careers, let’s pause to reflect on the legacy we want to leave behind. What verse will we be remembered for? Let’s strive to make it one of passion, purpose, and impact. “No matter what anyone tells you words and ideas can change the world. The powerful play must go on and we may contribute but a verse.” What will your verse be? 📜 🎭 #WhatWillYourVerseBe #Inspiration #Leadership #thepowerofwhy\n\n#LifeLesson Charlie Chaplin, one of the most iconic figures in the history of cinema, once remarked, \"Nothing is permanent in this world, not even our troubles.\" This profound statement encapsulates a powerful and universally applicable philosophy that can inspire and motivate us in our daily lives. At its core, Chaplin's message speaks to the transient nature of human experience and the importance of resilience and perspective in the face of adversity. 📌The Nature of Impermanence Impermanence is a fundamental aspect of existence. Everything in life, from our greatest joys to our deepest sorrows, is subject to change. This concept is not just a philosophical idea but a practical reality that we encounter every day. Seasons change, relationships evolve, and circumstances shift. Understanding and accepting this can help us navigate the ups and downs of life more gracefully. 📌Coping with Troubles Chaplin’s quote specifically highlights that even our troubles are not permanent. This is a crucial reminder, especially during times of hardship. When we are in the midst of difficulties, it can often feel like they will last forever. However, history and personal experiences show that most challenges are temporary and can be overcome with time and effort. 📌The Power of Perspective Adopting the perspective that nothing is permanent can fundamentally change how we approach life. It fosters a mindset of flexibility and adaptability, crucial traits in a constantly changing world. This perspective helps us to not cling too tightly to our successes or failures but to view them as parts of a larger, ever-changing narrative. 📍Conclusion Charlie Chaplin’s insight that \"nothing is permanent in this world, not even our troubles\" is a timeless reminder of the impermanence of all things. It encourages us to appreciate the present, remain resilient in the face of adversity, and maintain a balanced perspective on life's fluctuations. Embracing this wisdom can lead to a more fulfilling, less anxious life, where we learn to ride the waves of change with grace and optimism.\n\nDo You Know Where You Are Going? Are you part of the 70% of the population that hates your Corporate job? Do you watch the clock as it moves from 4:50 to 5:00 p.m., and it feels like it takes a year? Would you sometimes rather be hospitalized instead of staying on this career path? If your goal is to jump off Society’s Path, the first step is to have at least a general direction of where you are going. Arnold Schwarzenegger published his new book, Be Useful – Seven Tools for Life, this week – and it’s an excellent read. Listen below as Arnold explains why having a vision for your life is essential if you hope to succeed. https://lnkd.in/eY3WDd8s So many people get lost in life. They don’t know where they’re going with their lives. Having a vision, a picture of what you want your life to look like, is CRITICAL! It doesn't have to be perfect to start. It can be a broad vision and slowly get more specific. Arnold's vision started very broad. He wanted to move to America. He had no idea how that would ever happen to him, but unexpected doors opened everywhere, as it often happens once you have a vision for your life. For Arnold, it was seeing a muscle magazine with Reg Park on the cover. Reg was like Arnold, who came from a poor area in Europe but, through bodybuilding, had created an incredible life for himself. Arnold became obsessed with following Reg Park's steps, and the rest is history. Arnold's broad initial vision of moving to America became more specific. It started with bodybuilding and winning multiple Mr Olympia titles, becoming one the most famous actors of all time, and becoming the governor of California. It all started with his vision of moving to America. My vision of leaving the rat race of a Corporate 9 to 5 started when I read The Adventure of Leadership by Hap Klopp, the founder of The North Face. My initial broad vision was simple; I wanted to own my own business so I could treat my employees the way they should be treated, not how big companies treated them. So I left my Corporate 9 to 5 with my friend, the Chief Cost Accountant, and we started our own consulting company, doing exactly what we were successfully doing in our 9 to 5’s. After helping a couple of small manufacturing companies significantly improve their operational efficiencies, I realized that what I wanted to own was a gym. I had been an athlete and exercise enthusiast through High School and College, and going back to the gym after quitting my 9 to 5 enabled me to improve my health significantly, so my new and more specific vision was to help other people do the same while being able to treat my employees the way I would have wanted to be treated. Let me end this week’s post with a snippet from Jordan Peterson explaining the need for a personal vision. https://lnkd.in/eedA4JKB What’s the vision you have for your life? Let me know in the comments below.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger's Empowering Speech on Overcoming Adversity In a recent motivational speech, Arnold Schwarzenegger delivered a powerful message about resilience and perseverance in the face of challenges. The iconic actor and former governor emphasized the importance of not letting setbacks define one's identity. Schwarzenegger, known for his legendary career in bodybuilding, Hollywood, and politics, shared personal anecdotes of his own journey to success, highlighting the numerous obstacles he encountered along the way. He spoke passionately about the mindset required to overcome adversity, emphasizing that failure is not permanent unless one allows it to be. Addressing the audience, Schwarzenegger proclaimed, \"People who heat their jobs are LOSERS. Stay down — WINNERS get up.\" His words resonated with listeners as he urged them not to be discouraged by temporary setbacks but to instead rise stronger and more determined than ever before. Drawing from his own experiences, Schwarzenegger emphasized the importance of hard work, discipline, and self-belief in achieving one's goals. He encouraged individuals to embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and to never lose sight of their dreams, no matter how daunting the journey may seem. In conclusion, Schwarzenegger's speech served as a reminder that success is not determined by the absence of obstacles but by one's ability to overcome them. With unwavering determination and a refusal to stay down, anyone can rise to greatness and achieve their fullest potential.
