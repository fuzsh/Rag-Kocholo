        "text": "The recently released Netflix documentary about Arnold Schwarzenegger — simply titled “Arnold” — is in three parts.\n\nThe middle installment is named “Actor” and centers around his time making iconic films such as “The Terminator,” “Predator” and “Twins.”\n\nThe last is titled “American,” which focuses on Schwarzenegger’s political campaign and rise to winning a recall election as governor of California in 2003.\n\nThe title of the first part of the doc might be a bit of a surprise for some. It’s named “Athlete” — which could be confusing for those who don’t consider bodybuilding a sport.\n\nThat’s up for debate but for those who do consider bodybuilding a sport — and this corner definitely does – there’s no doubt Schwarzenegger is the greatest of the all time (or the GOAT, the common sports phrase these days).\n\nThe “Arnold” doc runs more than three hours, and for any fan of the iconic former bodybuilder — who’s now 75 but still enjoys pumping iron — it’s a fascinating must-watch.\n\nSchwarzenegger was born in Austria before moving to America and becoming a United States citizen in 1983. He began lifting weights at age 15, and won his first Mr. Universe title at 20. By the time he retired from bodybuilding and became an actor and later a politician, Schwarzenegger won seven Mr. Olympia titles — aka the best bodybuilder in the world.\n\nThe man was driven from within but credits help from others along the way. There was another form of help as well.\n\nIn the documentary, Schwarzenegger admits to steroid use, so his physique during his bodybuilding heyday of the 1970s was not 100 percent natural. That’s not a surprise, considering the proportions of a serious bodybuilder are anything but normal. Nonetheless, Schwarzenegger’s body build during his heyday of the 1970s — and even into the 1980s — was jaw-dropping. It was as if it was sculpted from clay.\n\nSchwarzenegger addressed that analogy in the 1977 film, “Pumping Iron,” by saying: “Good bodybuilders have the same mind when it comes to sculpting that a sculptor has. If you look in the mirror and I need a little more deltoids, a little more shoulders to get the proportions right … so what you do is exercise and put these deltoids on, whereas an artist would just slap on some clay … that’s the easier way. We go through the harder way.”\n\nIn 1977, “Pumping Iron” — a documentary about the world of bodybuilding — did for it what “Star Wars” did for sci-fi movies. It took bodybuilding to an entirely different stratosphere. Lou Ferigno — best known for the playing the lead role in the 1970s CBS TV show “The Incredible Hulk” — was also in “Pumping Iron” but Schwarzenegger was undoubtedly the star and stole the show.\n\nHe took that charisma into Hollywood and (along with Sylvester Stallone) became the preeminent mega action star of the 1980s. But bodybuilding never left Schwarzenegger, who for years has run the Arnold Sports Festival in Columbus.\n\nEvery year at the Festival, competitors are up against each other for big prize money, but it’s all subjective. Similar to gymnastics and ice skating, judges determine first, second, third place and so on. In most bodybuilding events, judges score in categories such as muscle mass, definition and symmetry.\n\nRegardless, bodybuilding and other sports lose some credibility because its results are based solely on judging.\n\nSome might argue bodybuilding is no different than beauty pageants or talent shows. The difference with bodybuilding is the physical demands involved. Any questions? Watch Part 1 of “Arnold” or “Pumping Iron.”\n\nIt’s grueling work, and not easy. If it was easy, everyone might do it. Bodybuilders train hard to get stronger, build mass and muscle memory. For many sports, those are staples of being an athlete.\n\nBut it’s difficult. Very difficult.\n\nSimilar to many sports out there today."
