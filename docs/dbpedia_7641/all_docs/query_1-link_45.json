        "text": "There’s a reason that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a bodybuilding legend. The 7-time Mr. Olympia champion has been widely considered the benchmark for achieving fitness goals. With rippling muscles and a dynamic metabolism to match, Schwarzenegger has been one of Hollywood’s biggest action stars spanning many decades and has cemented his place in the big leagues with iconic films like Terminator, Predator, Commando, and many more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly though, Schwarzenegger who is considered the last word in bodybuilding and fitness, has reportedly never been able to develop one of the key physical features of a bodybuilder namely the famous six-pack abs that every fitness freak craves to have. A few scientific studies on the internet have detailed the various reasons for this.\n\nAlso Read: “We really want to build this story”: Forget I Am Legend 2, Michael B. Jordan Wants a Movie Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Rival Completely Abandoned\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy Arnold Schwarzenegger Can Never Have A Six-Pack\n\nFor any fitness enthusiast who wishes to develop his or her body, the ultimate aim is to have the classic washboard abs which is a sign of supreme fitness. While it is assumed that a celebrity like Arnold Schwarzenegger is the kind of role model to be followed, studies have shown that the True Lies star in fact possesses only four-pack abs and not six-pack abs."
