        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ‘Golden Six’ Routine\n\nWhen I first started getting into bodybuilding in my teens, my only sources of information were a copy of a bodypart split routine which Arnold Schwarzenegger had used in the mid-70s and the advice of a peer who claimed he could bench press 200kg with one hand.\n\nUnsurprisingly, both of these sources were useless.\n\nMy friend couldn’t bench press a salami, let alone 200kg with one hand, and Arnold’s zillion-sets-per-session routine, while no doubt effective for someone juiced to the hilt and possessing above-average genetics, was not the ideal workout for a 15-year-old boy who’s diet primarily comprised Dairylea Dunkers and Jaffa Cakes.\n\nLike many, during my first gym sessions I made the mistake of trying to replicate the high volume routines used by the pros, thinking this would transform me into a cigar chomping, uzi-lubing, truck-lifting monster.\n\nHowever, this was NOT how Schwarzenegger started out in the gym, nor how he made most of his gains.\n\nAlthough Arnold is famous for the high-volume body part split routines he outlined in the various Weider publications, when he first ventured into a gym he emulated the training philosophy of his hero and future mentor, Reg Park:\n\nI found out everything I could about Reg Park.\n\nI bought all the magazines that published his programs.\n\nI learned how he started training, what he ate, how he lived, and how he did his workouts.\n\nI became obsessed…\n\nIndeed, the Austrian Oak built his impressive foundation on full-body workouts such as Park’s 5×5 routine and his own ‘Golden Six’ routine which we are going to look at today.\n\nBy the 1970s, when Arnold started experimenting with anabolic steroids and had escalated the volume and intensity of his workouts, he had already built an imposing physique on the back of these basic full-body routines.\n\nThe Golden Six routine\n\nThe ‘Golden Six’ was a programme based around six key exercises that Arnold followed when he started training at a gym in Munich, and, according to the man himself, it was one he made “remarkable” gains on.\n\nThis was also the routine which Arnold prescribed for his personal training clients who were looking to “get big”.\n\nArnold also claimed that Welsh bodybuilder and former Mr World Paul Grant used this exact routine to gain more than 65 pounds of muscle in less than a year!\n\nAll he did was gradually increase the number of sets on the first five exercises, moving up to four sets after three months and then six sets after six months\n\nBear in mind, however, that this is the same Arnold who, in an attempt to land his first movie role, convinced movie producers that he had “done Shakespeare” back in Germany, so take everything he says with a grain of salt.\n\nExercise Sets Reps Barbell squat 4 10 Wide grip barbell bench press 3 10 Chin ups 3 Max Behind the neck press 4 10 Barbell curl 3 10 Bent knee sit up 3-4 Max\n\nNotes\n\nCycle\n\nArnold recommended performing this routine three times per week on alternating days for a three month cycle.\n\nProgression\n\nOnce you can do two to three reps above the recommended amount increase the weight.\n\nStrive to progress wherever possible.\n\nRest\n\nRest for two minutes between sets of squats and no more than 90 seconds for the other exercises.\n\nExercise advice\n\nFor Arnold’s comments on each exercise, have a read of this article.\n\nThoughts\n\nThis classic 1950s-1960s style full-body workout is an ideal routine for beginners and ectomorphs looking to bulk up and gain strength.\n\nThese kinds of routines – in the vein of Reg Park, John McCallum, Peary Rader etc – are massively under-appreciated these days, which is a shame, because although they’re not fashionable or mainstream any more, they are the perfect way to lay the foundation for a well balanced, muscular physique.\n\nGet in, blitz everything, get out, eat, rest, repeat.\n\nIt’s as simple as that.\n\nWith regards to exercise selection in this particular routine, I would make a few adjustments, such as adding in some rows or deadlifts (there’s a slight imbalance between push and pull movements here) and replacing the behind-the-neck press with a standard press.\n\nNot only does the former rely on a more unnatural plane of movement which places undue stress on your rotator cuffs, but it is a much harder lift to progress on than the standard press, and adding weight to the bar is the name of the game here\n\nI would also replace the sit-ups with a more efficient ab exercise such as hanging leg raises.\n\nVerdict\n\nIf you’re new to the gym and looking for a productive routine to build muscle and size, ditch the dense bodypart splits, isolation exercises and bullshit, and give Arnie’s Golden Six workout a go.\n\nIn fact, whatever level of training you’re at, a cycle of this routine will no doubt be extremely productive – provided you’re eating and resting adequately, of course.\n\nIt’s simple, enjoyable, effective – and comes with Conan the Barbarian’s seal of approval.\n\nWhat more could you want?\n\nOver to you\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the Golden Six routine?\n\nAlready tried it or thinking of giving it a go?\n\nHave any questions?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you in the comments below!"
