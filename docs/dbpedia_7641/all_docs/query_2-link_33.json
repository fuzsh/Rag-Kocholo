        "text": "Synopsis\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger believes the ability to absorb information and ask questions, especially “how” and “why” is one of the best skills that can make one successful in any field.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger has always had cult fans who have loved to see him progress from a small-town bodybuilder to an action icon of Hollywood. With success on his side at all his efforts, the actor throws some light on what he thinks is one of the most crucial skills.\n\nAccording to the “Terminator” actor, one of the most crucial skills for achieving success is curiosity and the ability to be a good listener. These qualities aren't meant to be wielded manipulatively, but rather, practically, as they empower you to leverage your relationships with others to reach your goals.\n\nAll About The Right Questions!\n\nSchwarzenegger highlights the concept that people themselves are valuable resources, and the key to making the most of these resources lies in your ability to absorb the knowledge and insights they offer. It’s about asking the right questions, specifically “how” and “why,” to truly tap into the wealth of information that others can provide. This approach serves both personal and collective interests.\n\nFor Schwarzenegger, this philosophy extends beyond his illustrious acting and bodybuilding career and into his gym experiences. He recalls how he adopted this approach when he saw legendary bodybuilder Vince Gironda using a seemingly unconventional exercise called the side-lying triceps extension.\n\nRather than dismiss it outright, Schwarzenegger asked questions: How did Gironda come up with this exercise? Why does it work better than other similar movements? How should it be incorporated into a workout? His curiosity and willingness to learn led him to discover its effectiveness and its impact on his physique.\n\nSchwarzenegger emphasizes that asking these types of “how” and “why” questions serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it helps in solving doubts or concerns by seeking and receiving clear answers. Secondly, it demonstrates humility, establishing you as an ally to those you’re engaging with. Lastly, it enhances your own learning process by ensuring that the information you gain is more likely to stick in your memory and connect with related knowledge, making it more useful when applied to serve others.\n\nMaking use of the wealth of information\n\nThe actor turned governor reveals that his time as California's governor was the most fulfilling period of his career because it allowed him to immerse himself in learning and understanding the intricacies of how society functions. His position empowered him to absorb a wealth of information and use that knowledge to benefit millions of people. Schwarzenegger underscores that the more he learned and the more questions he asked, the better he became as a leader.\n\nHowever, he acknowledges that not everyone has the privilege of holding such a position. Many individuals are left to navigate life’s complexities without the power to compel others to explain the world to them. This, Schwarzenegger believes, is one of the reasons why many people feel stuck in their lives. They grapple with a world they don’t fully understand, facing circumstances they believe they can’t change.\n\nSchwarzenegger’s message is clear – curiosity and the willingness to be a sponge for knowledge can empower individuals to craft a vision for themselves and break free from the feeling of being stuck. According to him, success is not just about where you start but how you navigate the journey, continually learning and asking the right questions along the way.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhich movie made Arnold Schwarzenegger the most famous?\n\nHe became an international star with The Terminator (1984) and over the next 20 years appeared in two sequels (1991 and 2003). His other films during this time included Predator (1987), Kindergarten Cop (1990), Total Recall (1990), True Lies (1994), and The 6th Day (2000).\n\nDid Arnold Schwarzenegger do bodybuilding?\n\nSchwarzenegger began lifting weights at age 15 and won the Mr. Universe title aged 20, and subsequently the Mr. Olympia title seven times. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
