There is a lot of conflicting information on Arnold’s style and workouts, but we’ve done our research to deliver the most accurate representation of how he trained.\n\nRead on to learn more about Arnold’s workouts and his philosophy to decide if his workout style is one you’re brave enough to try.\n\nWho is Arnold Schwarzenegger?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was born in a small village in Austria on July 30, 1947. His father, a former German soldier and police officer raised Arnold and his brother with a firm hand, teaching the young boys about the importance of hard work.\n\nSchwarzenegger became interested in lifting weights at 14 and quickly fell in love with the sport. He won the Junior Mr. Europe title in 1965, showing tremendous talent and potential. Arnold also won several powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting competitions.\n\nThe pivotal moment in Arnold’s life came in October of 1968 when he moved to the US. He spoke little English then but saw bodybuilding as his way of making it to the States.\n\nWasting no time, Arnold came second in the 1969 Mr. Olympia and then won six consecutive titles from 1970 to 1975. He returned five years later to win the controversial 1980 Mr. Olympia before retiring from the sport.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Arnold got his nickname the Austrian Oak as a reference to his impeccable physique.\n\nThroughout his bodybuilding career, Arnold tweaked his approach many times, and there are likely more than one Arnold Schwarzenegger splits. Still, one thing never changed: his incredible work ethic and drive to win.\n\nThe average Arnold workout included lots of exercises, plenty of workout sets, and countless instances of training to failure.\n\nAs we dive into the Arnold split, remember that hard work and consistency play a massive role in how effective his methods will be for you.\n\nTry the Hevy app to stay consistent and on track with the Arnold split.\n\nWhat is the Arnold Split?\n\nThe Arnold split is the training system Schwarzenegger used to build his physique and win countless bodybuilding competitions. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s workout routine consisted of six weekly workouts, several exercises for each muscle group, and plenty of training sets.\n\nSchwarzenegger was a huge believer in high-volume training for optimal muscle growth, and the Arnold split reflects that (1). He routinely trained for several hours daily, often splitting his workouts and training twice a day.\n\nThe Arnold workout split allows lifters to train all muscle groups the recommended two times per week (2). Aside from promoting muscle growth, a twice-a-week frequency is recommended for superior strength gains (3).\n\nArnold Split Workout Schedule\n\nThe 6-day workout split Arnold used is a bit of a mystery, but that doesn’t matter. Arnold likely tweaked his training methods countless times, given his long training history, and his philosophy is more important than the precise combination of exercises he did.\n\nLet’s first take a look at his weekly schedule. Then we’ll discuss each workout in depth:\n\nAs you can see, the Arnold split routine schedule isn’t anything special. It resembles a six-day upper/lower or push/pull/legs split, but there are some differences.\n\nOne notable contrast is that he paired agonist-antagonist (opposing) muscle groups frequently (e.g., chest and back) to take advantage of supersets. For instance, Arnold would do a set of incline barbell presses and immediately jump into an exhausting set of chin-ups.\n\nDepending on his schedule and what other things he had to do, Arnold would do his workouts in one go or split them up into two daily sessions. The former is more practical, but the latter is beneficial because it allows him to recover a bit and do all of his sets in a fresh state.\n\nSome of Arnold’s favorite exercises included the barbell bench press, incline bench press, bent-over rows, leg curls, close-grip bench press, dumbbell press, and lat pulldowns.\n\nAside from eating as much as a small army, we can’t deny that Arnold took advantage of steroids. He’s been open about his steroid use, and we must remember that PEDs were legal in the US until February 27, 1991 (4).\n\nStill, regardless of that, Arnold trained incredibly hard for many years. Claiming that steroids were the primary reason for his success would be an insult to him, his work ethic, and the sport of bodybuilding.\n\nThe Arnold Split: An In-Depth Look At His Workouts\n\nAs shown in a previous point, the Arnold Schwarzenegger workout split consisted of three unique workouts where he trained two or more muscle groups.\n\nEach session would repeat twice per week, allowing him to accumulate more volume for growth, especially in the upper body.\n\nArnold Split Chest Workout\n\nClick here to find this workout on the Hevy app.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was a huge fan of the flat barbell bench press as one of his primary pec-building exercises. He and Franco did the exercise together, pyramiding the weight up, often doing heavy sets with 400 pounds. The pair would then gradually strip the weight from the barbell until they ended up with an empty bar.\n\nThe Austrian Oak also loved the incline barbell press to develop the upper portion of his chest and build balanced pecs. Doing the incline barbell bench press was also great for developing his shoulders.\n\nSchwarzenegger was a huge fan of the dumbbell fly and pullover. He supersetted the two exercises to induce overload and expand his ribcage, leading to a more pronounced upper body.\n\nUnlike most people who pick light dumbbells for the fly and pullover, Arnold reasoned it was necessary to use heavier weights. In his words, “How will you add size using 25-pound dumbbells?”\n\nTo finish his already demanding chest session, Arnold did four sets of bodyweight dips to failure. He enjoyed the exercise and believed it was necessary for targeting the lower portion of the chest and creating real separation between the pectoralis major and abs.\n\nArnold enjoyed pairing his chest and back training into one.\n\nArnold Split Back Workout\n\nClick here to find this workout on the Hevy app.\n\nArnold tackled back training from three sides. He did movements for back thickness, performed exercises to emphasize width, and finished his training with hip hinge activities to bring out the definition in his lower back.\n\nFirst, Arnold leveraged the wide-grip pull-up to emphasize his lats and focus on broadening his back (5). He did five sets, each consisting of as many reps as possible.\n\nHe then supersetted bent-over rows with lat pulldowns to further train his back for width and create thickness and a 3D appearance.\n\nEach back workout ended with straight leg deadlifts. Arnold performed the exercise to focus on his lower back and bring out striations.\n\nTo understand how impressive Arnold’s workouts used to be, consider that he would start his back sessions with up to 15 pull-ups per set before proceeding to row 300+ pounds. He did rows and pulldowns back to back and finished his sessions with five sets of stiff-leg deadlifts.\n\nArnold Split Shoulders Workout\n\nClick here to find this workout on the Hevy app.\n\nArnold considered the clean and press a staple in his shoulder workout routine and enjoyed going heavy, following the 5×5 principles. He also did plenty of supersets to save time and shock his muscles.\n\nFor instance, one superset Arnold enjoyed doing was a dumbbell press with front raise. Doing so allowed him to train the mid and front shoulders evenly (6).\n\nAnother superset Arnold enjoyed was lateral raises with upright rows. Both exercises emphasize the middle portion of the deltoids, and doing the two back-to-back is a great way to exhaust the shoulder muscle group and promote growth, Arnold believed.\n\nUnlike most people, Arnold did dumbbell raises by lifting the weights above his head. His logic was that doing so allowed him to train his shoulders through a full range of motion and promote better activation, resulting in more growth.\n\nThe final exercise Arnold usually did for his shoulder training was a regular reverse fly with dumbbells. He was also known to do shoulder isolation exercises on cable machines for the constant tension they provided.\n\nAccording to the Austrian Oak, one mistake trainees make with the dumbbell press, and similar exercises is to lock out their elbows at the top of overhead presses.\n\nHe says that doing so takes the tension away from the shoulders and instead forces the triceps to work extra hard, defeating the purpose of the exercise.\n\nArnold Split Bicep Workout\n\nClick here to find this workout on the Hevy app.\n\nThe barbell curl was another foundational exercise Arnold did back in the day, and given how impressive his biceps were, it’s safe to say that it was effective. Like with many other exercises he did, Arnold enjoyed pyramiding up on barbell curls.\n\nHe would start with a lighter weight for up to 20 reps to force blood into the muscle group and improve activation. Then, he would add load to the bar and do fewer reps with each passing set until his last.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s workouts for the biceps included a superset, usually consisting of a seated dumbbell curl and a close-grip chin-up. The bench angle for the incline curls would be set at a 30-degree angle.\n\nWhen doing the close-grip chin-up, Arnold squeezed his biceps extra hard at the top position and did each set to failure.\n\nTry a few of his methods if you ever struggle to grow your biceps. You’ll probably experience the most significant muscle soreness in your life, and the muscle group will have no choice but to grow.\n\nArnold Split Tricep Workout\n\nClick here to find this workout on the Hevy app.\n\nJust as Arnold and his training partners did heavy work for their biceps, they used the close-grip bench press to overload their triceps through a good range of motion. Arnie would again start with a lighter set for more reps to force blood into the muscle group before going heavy.\n\nThe typical triceps superset included barbell skull crushers and one-arm overhead extension. It wasn’t anything fancy, but going hard and overloading the muscles with heavy weights allowed Arnold to build some of the most impressive triceps in bodybuilding (7).\n\nArnold Split Forearm Workout\n\nClick here to find this workout on the Hevy app.\n\nThere isn’t much to say about Arnold’s forearm training. He didn’t put too much emphasis on that area of his body, probably because it received enough stimulation from the many back and biceps exercises he did.\n\nStill, a good superset consisting of wrist and reverse curls will exhaust your forearms and bring a burning sensation like none you’ve experienced before.\n\nArnold Split Lower Body Workout\n\nClick here to find this workout on the Hevy app.\n\nDid you know that Arnold’s legs were a weak point for him? Here’s a quote from him: “Building up my legs was hard for me because I have long legs and long muscles.”\n\nStill, Arnold trained hard to develop a pair of legs that matched his impressive upper body.\n\nThe primary movement Arnold did for his legs was the barbell squat. It wasn’t anything fancy, but it got the job done because he went extra hard. He also included the leg press from time to time.\n\nArnold would do sets of 8 to 12 reps with 300 to 400 pounds on the bar.\n\nGiven that his best squat was 545 pounds, those weren’t incredibly heavy sets for him. He rested less between sets to shock his muscles and promote metabolic stress.\n\nHis leg workouts also included deadlifts and good mornings. Both movements emphasized the posterior chain and allowed Arnie to develop his legs evenly (8, 9).\n\nAs with most other Arnold workouts, his leg sessions included at least one superset. He enjoyed pairing leg extensions and curls because the two are isolation exercises that train the opposing quadriceps and hamstrings.\n\nDoing the two movements back-to-back allowed Arnold to burn his legs out and put the finishing touches.\n\nArnie’s go-to exercise for the calves is the standing machine calf raises, but he also enjoyed doing donkey calf raises to mix things up and have fun with his training partners.\n\nArnold Split Ab Workout\n\nClick here to find this workout on the Hevy app.\n\nLike his forearm training, Arnold didn’t do many exercises for his abs. He bet on the basics and trained the area twice per week, just like all the other muscle groups.\n\nArnold didn’t emphasize his ab training much simply because the area received a lot of stimulation from the many compound movements he did.\n\nArnold’s Training Intensity Tactics For Shocking His Muscles\n\nArnold was no stranger to hard work. He routinely punished his body and tested his limits with the help of Franco Columbu and other partners.\n\nMost of the time, Arnold and his bodybuilding friends did their workouts as outlined. But, from time to time, they leveraged intensity techniques to switch things up, shock their muscle groups, and renew their growth.\n\nArnold used three primary tactics to force progress: max effort reps, 1 to 10 reps, and the stripping method.\n\nMax Effort Reps\n\nArnold used the max effort reps method to determine his one-repetition maximum for the day. He did so by gradually increasing the load on the bar until he couldn’t get more than a single rep:\n\nSet 1 – 20 reps\n\nSet 2 – 15 reps\n\nSet 3 – 10 reps\n\nSet 4 – 8 reps\n\nSet 5 – 5 reps\n\nSet 6 – 3 reps\n\nSet 7 – 1 rep\n\nOnce Arnold reached that point, he increased the weight to the point where he could barely do even one rep:\n\nSet 8 – 1 rep\n\nSet 9 – 1 rep\n\n1 to 10 Reps\n\nArnold used the 1 to 10 reps method to exhaust his muscles thoroughly. He would start with\n\na weight with which he could only do a single rep and have two training partners remove plates after each set. Each time they removed some weight, he would do reps until he got to 10.\n\nFor example:\n\n405 pounds – 1 rep\n\n365 pounds – 2 reps\n\n325 pounds – 3 reps\n\n285 pounds – 4 reps\n\n255 pounds – 5 reps\n\n235 pounds – 6 reps\n\n215 pounds – 7 reps\n\n195 pounds – 8 reps\n\n175 pounds – 9 reps\n\n155 pounds – 10 reps\n\nThe load might seem light for Arnie but keep in mind that he would do these sets back-to-back with almost no rest.\n\nThe Stripping Method\n\nAfter doing a top set with a heavy load, Arnold would have two partners gradually remove weight off the bar. With each removal, he would do five reps. The process continued until Arnold was training with an empty bar. He would do 20 reps and take a break.\n\nThe method is similar to the 1 to 10 reps tactic and works to shock the muscles and force new growth. Here is how it might look after a top set with 365 pounds on the barbell bench press:\n\nSet 1 (335 pounds) – 5 reps\n\nSet 2 (295 pounds) – 5 reps\n\nSet 3 (245 pounds) – 5 reps\n\nSet 4 (205 pounds) – 5 reps\n\nSet 5 (165 pounds) – 5 reps\n\nSet 6 (125 pounds) – 5 reps\n\nSet 7 (85 pounds) – 5 reps\n\nSet 8 (45 pounds; just the empty bar) – 20 reps\n\nUsing a workout tracker can help you keep track of these tactics and see what ones works best for you.\n\nArnold Split: Progression And How to Get Started\n\nThe Arnold split is incredibly demanding and not for the faint of heart. It features six workouts per week, a ton of sets, plenty of compound exercises, and supersets that will leave you gasping for air.\n\nWe recommend starting the split with an introductory week or two. In other words, you should not begin the split as we’ve outlined but progress the volume and intensity gradually over some time.\n\nDoing so is necessary to get used to the workout routine, keep muscle soreness at bay, and reduce the risk of overtraining.\n\nJumping into workout routines might seem the obvious way to start making progress immediately, but the approach doesn’t work well for Arnold’s training program.\n\nFor example, you can start by doing fewer sets per session and using a weight you can handle comfortably for at least ten reps. If the plan calls for six sets of an exercise, do four. If you have to do heavy sets of five reps, do lighter sets of ten reps instead.\n\nAdditionally, leave some reps in the tank and avoid training to failure initially. Pushing yourself to your limits is necessary for building muscle mass in the long run, but you don’t have to work as hard initially.\n\nThe training program is difficult enough, and there is no real need to overtrain yourself.\n\nProgressive Overload On The Arnold Split\n\nIncreasing the weight you’re lifting is also necessary for long-term progress. Still, you have to be intelligent about it because increasing the load too quickly can lead to technique breakdown, cause you to miss reps, and increase the injury risk.\n\nOnly add more weight to exercises when you can complete all of the prescribed repetitions with good form.\n\nFor instance, Arnold’s legs workout calls for 8 to 12 reps on the incline bench. You should only increase the weight when you can press a specific load for 12 reps on all six sets.\n\nIn any case, the original Arnold split program isn’t suited for a large percentage of trainees. Don’t be afraid to tweak the program and find ways to make it fit your goals, preferences, and ability to recover.\n\nTips And Tricks For The Arnold Split Workouts\n\n1. Use a Variety of Machines and Free Weights\n\nArnold was a huge fan of variety in his training. He believed that doing the same thing repeatedly or only sticking to a specific type of exercise would impede his progress.\n\nBarbell movements made up a large percentage of the average Arnold split workout, but he also used dumbbells, cable machines, and more.\n\nFor instance, Arnie was a fan of cable exercises for his shoulders because they provided constant tension and led to excellent muscle activation.\n\nMachines were another favorite type of equipment as Arnold often used such movements in\n\na superset fashion. A notable example is how he paired leg curls with leg extensions.\n\n2. Don’t Be Afraid to Try New Things\n\nExercise physiology and sports nutrition research has come a long way since the peak of Arnold’s career. Studies show us how things work and provide insight on how we should do certain things for optimal results.\n\nStill, if you’re going to learn one thing from Arnold, it should be to try new things in your training.\n\nArnold didn’t read studies to find the optimal number of sets or the best rep range for muscle growth. He subscribed to the idea of hard work and shocking his muscles with numerous techniques. It clearly worked for him.\n\nOther splits to consider:\n\n6 Day Split Workout – The Complete Guide\n\n7 Day Split Workout – The Complete Guide\n\n8 Day Split Workout – The Complete Guide\n\nGuide to the Greek God Physique Workout Program\n\n3. Do More Work\n\nThe simplest and most reliable way to make better progress with your training is to do more work: sets, exercises, weekly sessions, etc.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of Arnold’s training is that he always outworked everyone around him and pushed himself to his limits.\n\nOf course, for more work to bring better results, it should move hand-in-hand with good recovery. Arnie cared for his body by fueling himself with high-quality food, getting enough protein, and sleeping (10, 11).\n\n4. Surround Yourself With Hardworking People\n\nArnold never trained alone. He always had Franco Columbu, Dave Draper, and other notable bodybuilders by his side.\n\nSurrounding himself with like-minded and hardworking individuals undoubtedly played a role in Arnie’s commitment and motivation to push himself beyond his limits.\n\nRegardless of your workout plan, surrounding yourself with committed and hardworking training partners will always lead to better results. Accountability and motivation are powerful forces that drive progress.\n\nCan Beginners Do The Arnold Split (Who Should Avoid It)?\n\nBeginners should not consider the Arnold split for a couple of reasons. First, they can make optimal progress with far less training. Second, such a demanding workout approach will increase the risk of getting injured or overtrained.\n\nLikewise, people who’ve taken a long break from training and are just returning to the gym should avoid the Arnold workout split. You might have years of training experience, but you will need to ease into your training and gradually increase the volume and intensity.\n\nThe third group of people who should avoid the Arnold split is those dieting to shed fat. Being in a calorie deficit means you cannot do as much training and recover positively, so an easier training plan with fewer workout days will be your best option for fat loss training.\n\nArnold Split vs. PPL (Push/Pull/Legs): Pros And Cons Of Both Approaches\n\nAs discussed earlier, the Arnold split resembles a 6-day push/pull/legs split in some ways. Both approaches are designed for more advanced trainees and have you rest for only one day per week.\n\nA notable difference between Arnie’s training and a PPL split relates to the structure of each session. Arnold was a big fan of pairing chest and back and shoulders with arms.\n\nIn contrast, a PPL split has you pair ‘push’ and ‘pull’ muscles for the individual sessions. The leg sessions on both splits are identical: train every muscle below the waist.\n\nAn example of a push workout would be one where you train your chest, shoulders, and triceps. Similarly, a pull workout would train the muscles you use for pulling: the back, biceps, and forearms.\n\nIt’s important to note that neither split is necessarily better than the other. Both approaches offer benefits and drawbacks, and what matters most is that you apply yourself and stay consistent with your workouts.\n\nOne benefit of a PPL split is that workouts tend to be more manageable. You train muscles that enjoy working together, which allows you to provide a good stimulus with fewer sets and exercises.\n\nFinal Words\n\nThe Arnold split is an advanced training approach for building muscle mass and strength. It features a variety of exercises and lots of workout sets. Another notable characteristic is that Arnold was a big fan of variety and constantly looked for ways to shock his muscles into growing.\n\nSome of Arnold’s methods might seem unnecessary or ineffective in the face of today’s research, but few people have achieved as much as him and have the right to argue.\n\nArnold’s workout split is certainly not for everyone. It is a grueling and incredibly demanding approach that will overtrain most people. But, given the right tweaks, good nutrition, and proper recovery, it can work.\n\nEven if you don’t follow his split down to a T, there is a lot to learn from the Austrian Oak about effective training."
