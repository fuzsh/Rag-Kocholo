        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the most iconic figures in bodybuilding history. He has boosted the profile of professional bodybuilding more than any other winner of Mr. Olympia. He has a total of 7 Olympia titles, after only Ronnie Coleman and Lee Haney at 8.\n\nAccording to ‘the greatest’ Ronnie Coleman, with the right technology and nutritionist, Schwarzenegger would have been unbeatable.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nColeman on Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nRonnie Coleman is the winner of 26 IFBB professional titles, the most ever, and he often credits the success to his nutritionist, Chad Nicholls. In a sit-down with Patrick Bet-David, he shared his views on his fellow bodybuilder, Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nWhen comparing pictures of Coleman and Schwarzenegger in their prime, he commented on the latter’s greater shape. Subsequently, he asked Coleman what Schwarzenegger could have been if he was paired with the iconic nutritionist Chad Nicholls. To this, he claimed with no hesitation, “Arnold would have been by far the best bodybuilder ever.” He added, “Look at that shape, look at that chest. Nobody got that, even today.”\n\nREAD MORE: $400 Million Worth Now, Arnold Schwarzenegger Couldn’t Even Afford a Banana During Childhood – “Asked Him if I Could Have His Peel”\n\nColeman is convinced that with the right nutritionist and technology, no one would have been able to touch Schwarzenegger. Not even Lee Haney or Coleman himself. “I look like a little boy standing next to him,” he said. With the biggest chest ever, Schwarzenegger has Coleman more than impressed.\n\nSchwarzenegger’s prowess as a bodybuilder\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nIn Arnold Schwarzenegger’s first attempt at the Mr. Olympia title, he lost to Sergio Oliva, placing second. However, he came back to win in 1970 and continued to win until 1975. After that, he announced his retirement, content with his 6 consecutive titles. The subsequent documentary ‘Pumping Iron’, starring him, launched bodybuilding into the mainstream.\n\nIn 1980, Schwarzenegger was training for his role in the movie ‘Conan the Barbarian’. He got in such good shape that he decided to go for the Olympia title one last time. Though a controversial win (perceived lack of muscle mass), Schwarzenegger secured his seventh and final Mr. Olympia title. His record stood until 1991 when Lee Haney claimed his 8th title.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nDIVE DEEPER: Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Biggest Rival Wanted to “Strangle Him” After His Legendary Accomplishments\n\nAt 6′ 2″, 235 lbs in peak shape, Schwarzenegger’s ’70s physique still compares well with many of the greats of today. His legacy is commemorated in the IFBB Arnold Classic bodybuilding competition. After 1980, Arnold Schwarzenegger fully dived into his film career. But he remained relevant to bodybuilding, owning several gyms and fitness magazines."
