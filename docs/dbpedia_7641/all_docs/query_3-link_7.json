        "text": "Q\n\nHow Did Your Bodybuilding Journey Begin?\n\nWhen I was 12 years old, Jean-Claude van Damme was my idol. I admired his ripped body and his martial arts techniques. I started lifting at my home gym and training at a karate club and 2-3-hour training sessions became part of my daily routine.\n\nAt age 18, I became a member of the Austrian Karate National Team. I had a great time, trained religiously, and never quit lifitng. As a result, my body became ripped with little mass. At age 21, I stopped competing in karate and decided to put my full effort into fitness. That was the turning point. Fitness combined with a healthy lifestyle was my new passion.\n\nWhy Do You Love Bodybuilding?\n\nThe feeling when I finish my workout is the best. I love the pump and vascularity in my body when I lift weights. It's nice to see my body grow throughout the years and receive positive feedback. I love challenging myself every day in the gym and setting new goals. Fitness and sports turned me into the man I am today.\n\nWhat Motivates You to Follow a Healthy Lifestyle?\n\nI love to eat clean and healthy. Without a good diet, it's impossible to improve your body. It's important for everyone who wants to get perfect proportions.\n\nWhat Made You Want to Achieve Your Goals?\n\nWhen I was younger, my goal was to become a member of the Austrian Karate National Team and look like my idol, Jean-Claude van Damme. Many people said I would never reach my goal, but I never stopped believing in myself and reached it. My attitude hasn't changed. It's motivating to inspire and motivate others.\n\nWhat Are Your Future Bodybuilding Plans?\n\nMy dream is to be a fitness cover model and enter physique competitions.\n\nWhat One Tip Would You Give Other Bodybuilders?\n\nWhen you wake up in the morning, think about your goals first. Train hard and stay natural.\n\nWho Are Your Favourite Bodybuilders?\n\nMy fellow Austrian Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nHow Did Bodybuilding.com Help You Reach Your Goals?\n\nI love using my BodySpace to interact with other users and to track my progress. I read many articles on the site and use their advice to enhance my training and diet. The motivation on this site is amazing.\n\nMario's Top 5 Gym Tracks"
