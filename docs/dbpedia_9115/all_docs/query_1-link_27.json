        "text": "Argentina implemented the Fifth revised edition of UN Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS5) under Resolution No. 801/2015 published by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security. This resolution was later amended by Resolution SRT 3359/205 of the Superintendency of Occupational Risks (SRT). GHS5 became mandatory for substances on 1 January 2017, and for mixtures from 1 June 2017. In Argentina, the GHS is complemented by standards from the Argentine Institute of Standardization and Certification (IRAM). The Argentinian standards IRAM 41400 and IRAM 41401 regulate Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) and Labelling of Hazardous Chemicals respectively.\n\nThe GHS in Argentina has compliance deadlines with regard to chemicals listed in the following norms: Substances and Cancerogenic Substances (Resolution 310/03), Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) (Resolution 497/03), and Major Industrials Accidents (Resolution 743/03).\n\nLocal Adaptation of GHS\n\nThe following GHS building blocks are not implemented in Argentina:\n\nChemicals under Pressure, all categories\n\nFlammable Gas, Category 1A\n\nFlammable Gas, Category 1B\n\nCategory 1A (Pyrophoric gases)\n\nGHS Labelling Requirements\n\nLike many other countries, Argentina also has its own GHS labelling requirements. The requirements are set by the Standard IRAM 41401. The standard contains information on how pictograms, symbols, warning words, hazard statements, and precautionary statements should be presented. The label of a hazardous chemical must as a minimum contain the following information in Spanish:\n\nIdentification of the chemical product (chemical name and trade name)\n\nSupplier’s data and emergency telephone number. The emergency number must guarantee 24-hour care in the event of any emergency.\n\nChemical composition\n\nHazard pictograms. Minimum size 10 mm x 10 mm except for small-sized containers.\n\nWarning words\n\nHazard statements – the text of the hazards statement on a label must not be replaced by the code.\n\nPrecautionary statements – the text of the precautionary statement should not be replaced by the code.\n\nThe size of the label and in turn the pictogram are dependent on the size of the container that contains the chemical product. The recommended dimensions for the label and pictogram are presented in Table below.\n\nSafety Data Sheet\n\nThe Standard IRAM 41400 governs the Safety Data Sheets (SDS) under GHS in Argentina. The SDS must contain the standard 16 sections, and the information must be written in Spanish. In Argentina, the SDS may be used in the workplace, to warn about hazards to the environment, as well as for national and international trade.\n\nGHS in Work-Environment\n\nGHS in the workplace was implemented in 2015 with the approval of Resolution No. 801/2015 of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security. The Resolution was amended by Resolution SRT 3359/205 of the Superintendency of Occupational Risks (SRT). The amended Resolution established entry into force of the GHS from 1 January 2017 for substances and from 1 June 2017 for mixtures.\n\nGHS in Transportation\n\nThe transport of dangerous goods in Argentina needs to be understood under the context of agreements established for regional transport in the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) member states (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay). At the national level in Argentina, land transport of dangerous goods is regulated by Decree 779/95 (Annex S) and Resolution 195/97, based on the seventh revised edition of the UN Model Regulations.\n\nSummary of GHS implementation:"
