Argentina and the United States often vote together in the United Nations and other multilateral fora. Argentina has participated in many multilateral force deployments mandated by the United Nations Security Council, including recent missions to Haiti and the former Yugoslavia. Reflecting the growing partnership that marks ties between the two countries, on December 5, 1996, President Clinton and Argentine President Menem announced the establishment of a special consultative process to address important issues in the bilateral relationship.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION"
