        "text": "Since the mid-19th century, Argentina has faced repeated economic crises and cyclic military coups that interrupted democratic rule. The last military dictatorship (1975-1983) was characterised by gross and widespread human rights violations including enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. After the return to democracy in 1983, and due to the strong push of human rights organizations, the country sought justice and accountability through the creation of a truth commission, criminal proceedings, and strengthened civilian oversight of the armed forces.\n\nDivisions in politics have traditionally fallen between supporters of Peronism, a political movement rooted in former President Juan Peron’s pro-union and pro working-class policies, and members of the Radical Civic Movement (UCR) a center-right liberal party. Over the years, endemic corruption, low levels of public trust, political polarization and hyper-presidentialism, have led to increasingly weak institutions and a general fatigue with the political establishment. Furthermore, the strict handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the inability of traditional parties to address longstanding economic instability, including record-high inflation, allowed new right-wing and far-right parties, such as the ruling Liberty Advances (La Libertad Avanza, LLA), to gain prominence and support amidst public demands for change. Following the LLA's victory in the 2023 presidential elections, an economic program focused on drastically cutting state expenses, reducing the size and functions of the state, cutting down on public welfare and pushing for economic liberalism. During its initial months, the new government has pursued radical policy changes through “Necessity and Urgency Decrees” that give the executive the ability to legislate under extraordinary circumstances. The cuts in public spending in key areas have sparked significant criticism, leading to hundreds of thousands of protesters taking to the streets to protest against the government. These protests have been met with repression. Additionally, over the past years, the country has seen a surge in organized crime, with some political actors proposing the militarization of security in the country.\n\nThe origin myth of the nation as white and European has traditionally excluded Indigenous communities and other minorities like Afro-descendants from the concept of national identity. Racial discrimination exists at a structural level, and unequal access to social rights and opportunities is common. Regarding gender parity, women hold 42.5% of seats in parliament. Argentina has pioneered progressive legislation on gender equality, including same-sex marriage (2010), the gender identity law (2012), and legal abortion (2021). However, recent setbacks threaten future progress in gender mainstreaming. Violence against women remains endemic, with rising rates of femicides.\n\nIn the coming years, it will be important to monitor how the new government's cuts in areas such as education, public health, pensions and social welfare will impact Basic Welfare. Additionally, it will be crucial to observe Gender Equality considering cuts in state funding for this issue. Furthermore, it will be important to consider how the growing narrative of dictatorship denialism and the government's cuts on funding to essential Memory, Truth and Justice policies will impact ongoing trials for crimes against humanity, and its effect on Access to Justice."
