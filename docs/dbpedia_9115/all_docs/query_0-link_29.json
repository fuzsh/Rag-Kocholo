        "text": "ENACOM Type Approval in Argentina\n\nENACOM (Ente Nacional de Comunicaciones), formerly known as AFTIC and CNC, is the telecommunications regulatory agency in Argentina since 2015. Products that using technologies such as radio frequency, cellular, or satellite require ENACOM type approval and certification to be commercialized in Argentina.\n\nMost products require testing in Argentina, and typically one to three samples are needed depending on the device. Modular and system approval may be possible depending on the characteristics of the equipment.\n\nArgentina requires local representation for ENACOM certification. LARCG can provide certification holder services if you don’t have a presence in Argentina.\n\nArgentina has a few restricted frequency bands such as the 800MHz band and some ultra-wide band frequencies.\n\nAll products must operate with an IRAM 2074-approved Class I or II plug and IRAM 2073-approved external power supply. Power supplies must operate at 220V 50Hz in Argentina\n\nContact us to start the approval process\n\nProducts requiring ENACOM approval:\n\nWiFi, Bluetooth devices\n\nCellular equipment\n\nRFID modules\n\nPortable transceivers\n\nWireless gateways\n\nLabeling requirements may apply depending on equipment type.\n\nKey ENACOM resolutions\n\nNOTACNCANEH 7-2013: Defines test requirements for equipment that have at least one Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) interface operating in the bands of 902-928 MHz, 2400-2483,5 MHz and 5725-5850MHz, allocated in accordance to Res. SC 302/1998\n\nNOTACNCANEH 14-2013: Defines test requirements for equipment destined for private use that operate in the bands of 902-928 MHz, 2400-2483,5 MHz, 5150-5250 MHz, 5250-5350 MHz, 5470-5600 MHz, 5650-5725 MHz, 5725-5850 MHz\n\nRESOLUTION 82-2015: Defines labeling requirements for products approved in Argentina\n\nRESOLUTION 404-2015: Defines rules and procedures regarding safety certification and entities involved in the process\n\nRESOLUTION 171-2016: Updates requirements defined by Res 508/2015 for certification of low power products in Argentina\n\nFor products that do not require ENACOM approval, the agency will provide a No Homologation letter to avoid issues with customs.\n\nSafety\n\nManufacturing, importation and commercialization of certain products in Argentina require safety approval and certification. Depending on the electrical characteristics of your product, the following safety requirements may apply:\n\nFormula C Certification (S-Mark)\n\nFormula B Certification (high specialized equipment)\n\nIRAM Certification (Instituto Argentino de Normalización y Certificación)\n\nProducts that need the S-Mark certificate:\n\nExternal power supply\n\nEquipment with internal power supplies over 50V\n\nHome appliances\n\nSwitches, sockets and outlets\n\nLamps and related elements\n\nLabeling requirements may apply and in-country sample testing may be required.\n\nType I plugs can be found in Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and China. The AS/NZS 3112, or type I plug operates at 10 Amps on AC current at 220 – 240 Volts. Type I plugs feature two flat 1.6 mm thick blades, which are vertically offset by thirty degrees. Their centers are spaced 13.7 mm apart and both prongs measure 17.3 mm in length and 6.3 mm in width. The flat grounded blade measures 6.3 by 1.6 mm, and is 20 mm long. The distance between the center of the grounding pin and the middle of the plug is 10.3 mm. A non-grounded version of the type I plug exists; it features two flat V-shaped prongs like its grounded counterpart. Each version of the Type I plug is insulated.\n\nType C plugs were used in Argentina prior to 1998, and are not permitted anymore."
