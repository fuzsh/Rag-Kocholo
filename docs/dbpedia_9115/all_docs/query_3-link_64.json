        "text": "Superior Circuit\n\nThis circuit allows you to have a panoramic view of Iguazu Falls from the upper walkways (does not include the Devil’s Throat). From here you can also see a bit of the lower circuit.\n\nThrough approximately 1.75 kilometers, you will have a view from above of the Dos Hermanas, Chico, Ramirez, Bosetti, Adan and Eva, Mendez, and finally Mbiguá waterfalls.\n\nArriving at the end, you will have an impressive panoramic view of both the Argentine and Brazilian national park, being able to see, for example, the Meliá Iguazu Hotel or the Hotel Belmond Das Cataratas, San Martin Island, the lower circuit and more.\n\nAt the end of the road, you will return to the Cataratas train station, which allows you to go to the devil’s throat or the visitor center.\n\nDistance: 1750 meters.\n\nDifficulty: None, without stairs.\n\nEstimated time: 2 hours approximately.\n\nLower Circuit\n\nThis circuit allows you to enter the jungle through various stairs and walkways, where you will see flora and fauna characteristic of the area. As you move forward you will see a beautiful panoramic view of the falls.\n\nAt the same time as you visit this place, in the distance you will be able to see little by little the Devil’s Throat, along with San Martin Island and Bossetti Falls.\n\nIf you follow the path, you will find some stairs that will take you to the Dos Hermanas waterfall, where there is a small place with seats to rest. If you follow the path, you will come out at the entry point, just keep in mind that the turn is a steep path and can be quite tiring for some people.\n\nDistance: 1700 meters.\n\nDifficulty: Medium-High, especially on some stairs and the steep path around the corner.\n\nEstimated time: 2 hours approximately.\n\nDevil's Throat\n\nThe Devil’s Throat is one of the main attractions of Iguazu Falls. If you saw photos of the destination, surely many of the shots will have been of this attraction.\n\nThe Devil’s Throat allows you to be meters away from the most impressive fall and see it from above. Below you will have all the mist generated by this and the sound that catch your attention during the circuit as you get here. It is undoubtedly the highlight of this park. A unique and unrepeatable experience.\n\nTo get to the devil’s throat, it is necessary to take the Ecological Train of the Jungle, which takes all its visitors through the park. It is available all day and has a frequency of approximately 1 every 15 minutes. If you want, you can also walk near the road to the Garganta Station, but keep in mind that it is a long route (approximately 2000 meters).\n\nAt the Garganta Station you can take the path that takes you directly to the Devil’s Throat. From here you can take the “Ecological Ride” tour if you want.\n\nThis path is approximately 2,200 meters and has several stops with seats in the middle to rest (even in some trees you can see native birds such as toucans).\n\nTowards the end, there is the platform where you can see where the devil’s throat itself, with a strong current of water that sends a large flow of water that then turns into mist. The best time to take photos!\n\nKeep in mind that there are usually quite a few people in this place, so have some patience. If you have the possibility of being at the Melia Iguazu, we recommend you take the first train that leaves there to be the first and see how to enjoy this attraction with a lot less of visitors around.\n\nIn this circuit the full moon walk is also taken, which occurs only during some days of each month. If you can, we recommend you come on this date!\n\nDistance: 2200 meters.\n\nDifficulty: Low, the distance is a bit large but the path is flat and has several seats to rest.\n\nEstimated time: 2 hours approximately.\n\nMacuco Trail\n\nThe Macuco trail is a path of approximately 7.7 kilometers (round trip) that allows you to get to know a place with no human intervention. The trail has no construction or anything similar, just a clear path for visitors to walk on.\n\nThanks to this, you can see a variety of fauna and flora that you will not see anywhere else in the national park. And with a bit of luck, in the trees, there will be groups of monkeys caí around the area. It is recommended, for safety reasons, not to try to approach or feed them.\n\nAlong the way, you can also find some signposts that will give some interesting information about the place, which complement the path taken.\n\nAt the end of the trail, you will find the Arrechea waterfall, a small waterfall 20 meters high that completes the visit.\n\nNote the restrooms are only available at the beginning of the trail. So, remember to use them before entering because after more than 3 hours there will be nothing similar.\n\nDistance: 3600 meters approximately.\n\nDifficulty: Medium, the first 3 kilometers is quiet and effortless, but the remaining distance is a little more difficult to do.\n\nEstimated time: 3 hours approximately.\n\nThe trail is only open from 8:00 am to 3:00 pm.\n\nRainforest Ecological Train\n\nThis train was designed to transport people throughout the park and, at the same time, maintain the integrity of the jungle and not damage it on the road.\n\nThis train uses a special fuel that does not emit smoke or solid waste, being very friendly to the environment. Not does it generate noise that could affect the animals of the place.\n\nThe train has a capacity for 250 people, and since it is not closed you can enjoy the surrounding air and vegetation.\n\nThis train has three stations: one is in the visitor center, the other is in the middle of the park, near the lighthouse, and finally the last station is approximately 2000 meters from the devil’s throat.\n\nThe train has a frequency of approximately 15 to 20 minutes depending on the flow of people in the place.\n\nGreen Trail\n\nThis trail is a small 600-meter flat, stairless path that connects the visitor center to the Cataratas train station.\n\nIt is a pleasant path, where you can appreciate the nature of the place and even some animals such as birds or coatis.\n\nIn addition, this path also connects with the lower or upper circuit.\n\nDistance: 655 meters.\n\nDifficulty: None, it is a short path without stairs.\n\nEstimated time: approximately 30 minutes."
