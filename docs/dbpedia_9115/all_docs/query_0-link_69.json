        "text": "To the Editor,\n\nRecently, you published a position paper from multiple health and scientific organizations that recommended governments require warning labels on packages of salt.1 In the position paper, we stated “To our knowledge, no country has required actual packages and containers of sodium chloride (salt) to have warning labels.” This is important as few countries have the political will to be the first to introduce a substantive new policy. Hence, we are pleased to report that Argentina enacted Law 26905 in 2013, which requires salt packages and salt containers to warn about the risk of excess salt consumption and to contain a similar warning when marketing salt commercially."
