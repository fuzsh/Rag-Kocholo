        "text": "Approved case-by-case\n\nGene-edited crops that do not contain DNA from another species are regulated as conventional plants, so they don’t face the tighter restrictions of transgenic GMOs.\n\nArgentina has been a global leader in advancing genetic engineering in the agricultural sectors. The first GE crop was approved in 1996. With more than 26 million hectares planted with GE soybean, corn, and cotton crops, it is one of the three leading countries in the use of GE crops.\n\nIn 2015, Argentina became the first country in the world to develop regulatory criteria for gene editing and other new breeding techniques (NBTs). Now known globally as the “Argentina model,” the country only regulates genome-edited plants with permanent insertion of foreign DNA. A dossier needs to be submitted to determine if they are exempt. All gene-edited products must be submitted on a case-to-case basis to the Argentine Biosafety Commission (CONABIA) or are otherwise considered and regulated as a GMO. There is no legally mandated label for genetically engineered food, GMOs or gene-edited foods.\n\nCONABIA must respond within 60 days whether a new product will be subject to GMO regulations. CONABIA considers: a) the techniques used in the process; b) the genetic change in the final product; and c) the absence of a transgene in the end product. Even if a crop is exempt from GMO regulations, if it possesses characteristics that present the probability of significant risk it can result in further monitoring by authorities.\n\nIn 2020 Argentina updated its regulation framework, linking it more closely to the Cartagena Protocol. It specifically updated the stacked GM crops assessment, which at present applies to transgenic crops. Previously, each stacked GM event in crops needs to be assessed independently. This is still the case, but the process is simplified and unimportant information of every independent event can be skipped in the final assessment. Stacked traits are treated on the same case-by-case basis for each new event.\n\nWith 80 “events” approved already, Argentina sets to approve more foods, with crops in various stages of greenhouse experimentation, field trial, and commercial availability.\n\nProducts/Research\n\nApproved Non-browning potatoes, 2018: The Institute of Agricultural Technology of Argentina (INTA) used CRISPR to develop potatoes that don’t turn brown. The genes of the sugars responsible for the browning process were turned off. Field trials began in 2020.\n\nResearch Boll Weevil-resistant Cotton, 2019: Using gene silencing, INTA developed cotton that blocks an essential gene for weevil functionality.\n\nResearch Higher quality alfalfa, 2019: INTA is using CRISPR to develop more productive and higher quality alfalfa.\n\nRegulatory Timeline\n\n2020: Multiple updates to the Regulatory framework done, based on the Cartagena Protocol.\n\n2019: Ministry of Production and Work – Directorate of Biotechnology establishes the “Form for the presentation of Instances of Prior Consultation for plants, animals, and microorganisms obtained through New Improvement Techniques”, which streamlines CONABIA’s process to decide if new animals, microorganisms and crops obtained by gene editing will be considered a GMO or not.\n\n2018: Argentina and 12 other nations, including Canada, Australia, Brazil and the US, issue a joint statement supporting agricultural applications of precision biotechnology, stating that governments should “avoid arbitrary and unjustifiable distinctions between end products (crop traits) derived from precision biotechnology and similar end products, obtained through other production methods.”\n\n2018: Ministries of Agriculture of the South Agricultural Council (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay) publish declaration stating they would avoid arbitrary and unjustifiable distinctions between agricultural products obtained by gene editing and those obtained through other methods, share information about the development of products and regulatory frameworks, explore opportunities for regional and international harmonization, and work together including with other countries to avoid obstacles.\n\n2015: Resolution 173/2015 establishes a case-by-case consultation process to determine if a gene edited product is within the scope of GMO legislation.\n\n2011: Provisions No. 701 defines a Genetically Modified Organism as any living plant organism that possesses a combination of genetic material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology.\n\n2004: Resolution 46/2004 requires GMO seeds to be registered in a specific National Registry of Operators of Genetically Modified Plant Organisms. Registration is a prerequisite to request authorization for the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for testing and to obtain authorization for import or export of GM plants.\n\nNGO Reaction\n\nEnvironmental advocacy groups, including Argentina sin Tansgenicos (Argentina without transgenics), take the stance that gene editing is just the newest version of transgenic modification, arguing that gene editing has not been tested enough for safety and could lead to unintended side effects, so should be regulated as GMOs.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nUSDA Agricultural Biotechnology Annual 2022: Argentina\n\nRegulatory framework for gene editing and other new breeding techniques (NBTs) in Argentina\n\nThe regulatory current status of plant breeding technologies in some Latin American and the Caribbean countries\n\nRegulation of Genome Editing in Plant Biotechnology\n\nGene Editing Regulation and Innovation Economics\n\nBiosafety Clearing-House: Argentina\n\nBiotec-LATAM: Argentina\n\nUpdated: 01/31/2023\n\nHuman / Health\n\nGene Drives\n\nAgriculture\n\nClick on a country (eg.

This type of gene editing is the most controversial because changes are inherited and because it could theoretically be used to create “designer babies”. A Chinese scientist announced in 2018 that he had successfully edited twins that were brought to term. International backlash from the announcement has resulted in China and other countries working to clarify regulations on germline gene editing.\n\nRating by Country / Region\n\nClick each column header and arrow to sort the countries / regions\n\nSwipe right/left if all columns aren't visible\n\nClick on a country (eg.

Scientists are interested in using this technology to help eradicate disease-carrying insects and control invasive species, but questions about how gene drives will be directed and controlled are still being fleshed out.\n\nRating by Country / Region\n\nClick each column header and arrow to sort the countries / regions\n\nSwipe right/left if all columns aren't visible\n\nRegulations of gene editing and new breeding techniques (NBTs) worldwide are quickly evolving.

Regulations across 34 countries where transgenic or gene edited crops and animals are commercially allowed (as of 12/19) are guided in part by two factors:\n\nWhether the country has ratified the international agreement that took effect in 2003 that aims to ensure the safe handling, transport and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting from biotechnology that may impact biological diversity, also taking into account potential risks to human health. It entered into force for those nations that signed it in 2003. It applies the ‘precautionary approach as contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. The US, Canada, Australia and Chile and the Russian Federation have not signed the treaty.\n\nWhether regulations are based on the genetic process used to create the trait (conventional, mutagenesis, transgenesis, gene editing, etc.) or the final product.Transgenic crops and animals (aka GMOs) are product regulated in many countries including the US and Canada, while the EU, India, China and others regulate based on how the product is made. There is almost an equal number of countries with product- and process-based regulations. It’s not clear how much this distinction matters. It’s somewhat true that countries with product-based regulation have more crops approved and the approval process is more streamlined, but there are contradictions. For example, Brazil and Argentina have emerged as GMO super powers using different regulatory concepts, while there is no GMO commercial cultivation in Japan, North Korea, and the Russian Federation, which employ product-based regulations. How this will effect gene editing regulations is also unclear. For example, Japan, which has no commercialized GMOs, is emerging as a leader in the introduction of gene edited crops."
