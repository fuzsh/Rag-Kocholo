They have mandated that certain products that consume energy be labeled with an efficiency level. Level A is most efficient. We provide direct energy efficiency label certification services for products that consume electricity and are to be sold in Argentina, whether they are manufactured locally or imported. TÜV Rheinland is recognized by the Argentine government and accredited by the Argentine Accreditation Body (OAA) to certify the energy efficiency level of products that consume electricity.
