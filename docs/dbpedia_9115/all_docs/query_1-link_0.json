        "text": "Labeling requirements include safety information, voltage, fire safety, and child safety information. Since March 2022, black octagon labels are required on product packaging of processed foods and non-alcoholic beverages for nutritional purposes. Identification of manufacturer/importer, and manufacturing/expiration dates are also necessary. Pharmaceuticals must indicate the name of the responsible technical director of the pharmaceutical laboratory, as well as the ingredients by weight/volume.\n\nManufacturers and importers of the products affected by requirements (electric apparatus over 50 volts, toys, personal protection equipment, elevators, steel, lighters, and bicycles) can choose among three certification criteria (steel products can only be certified by mark or batch). Products certified by type or lot must bear a seal that includes the certification number. The latter must also consign batch number information.\n\nIRAM is the Argentine Institute for Standardization and Certification. It is a non-profit civil association, which was founded in 1935 by representatives of the various sectors of the economy, the government, and scientific-technical institutions. IRAM provides certification services for products, processes, people, services, and management systems, both nationally and internationally. The IRAM certificates have national and international (MERCOSUR) validity and are the gateway to other markets. For information on Argentine and MERCOSUR standards, contact:\n\nIRAM, Instituto Argentino de Normalización\n\niram-iso@iram.org.ar\n\nMERCOSUR Standards Association\n\nAMN, Asociación MERCOSUR de Normalización"
