        "text": "Argentina, with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) criteria, has just passed a new Law establishing the incorporation of warnings on the front-of-package of containers and regulating the marketing, promotion, sponsorship, and the offer of products with excess sugars, fats, and sodium in schools.\n\nWhat are the main changes in labeling?\n\nThe new standard establishes the inclusion of black octagons with white borders and letters that provide warnings about excess sugars, total fats, saturated fats, sodium, and calories. In addition, two legends are included:\n\n- \"contains sweeteners not recommended for children\"\n\n- \"contains caffeine, avoid in children.\"\n\nFront-of-package warning labeling has now been adopted, by 6 countries (Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay).\n\nWould you like to know more about the new labeling requirements in Argentina?"
