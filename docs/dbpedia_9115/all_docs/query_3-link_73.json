        "text": "PUMA Argentina has its central offices in Pilar, a city located on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. This is an excellent location, since we’re not directly in the bustle, but close by and it's perfect as a work area. It offers the best quality of life with the least amount of traffic (you don't have to drive into downtown).\n\nThe offices lay in a very quiet area with easy access for everyone coming from Buenos Aires city or even those employees coming from the north of the province. The traffic is a lot less compared to the distances to downtown, because it usually goes into the opposite direction. For those reliant on public transportation, PUMA offers the benefit of a charter service to bring and take you to and from your work; jointly with other benefits such as lunch in the office and its policy of Flexible Fridays and flextime.\n\nThere are 850 employees that work in the Footwear factory in the province of La Rioja, located in northwestern Argentina.\n\nThe connection between PUMA and football is undeniable. In Argentina, the passion for football and PUMA is fueled by the Independent Athletic Club and more than 30 players who change the game from main and historical Argentinian football teams.\n\nBut it's not all about football in Argentina. Athletics, training, rugby and hockey also play a very important and relevant role in the country, where we have sponsorship actions and partnerships with some of these athletes. We also play hard in the fashion world with our collaborations in the world of music, art and culture; for instance through our active participation in the Lollapalooza festival."
