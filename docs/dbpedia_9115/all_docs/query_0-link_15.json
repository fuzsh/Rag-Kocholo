        "text": "LETTER FROM BUENOS AIRES\n\nA large black and white octagon-shaped emblem catches the eye right away. Succinct messages on the front of the packaging allow consumers to identify at a glance the nutritional flaws of processed foods: \"excess sodium,\" \"excess calories,\" \"excess sugar.\" Soon, the appearance of the overwhelming majority of items sold in Argentinian supermarkets will change with a law known as the healthy food promotion bill. The legislation was enacted in November 2021 and regulations for its implementation were announced on Wednesday, March 23. For the civil advocacy groups and international organizations demanding this change, it's a big step forward in terms of public health.\n\nHowever, the text's legislative path was strewn with pitfalls. Approved in October 2020 by the Senate, the law then failed in the lower chamber. At the beginning of October 2021, it faced another roadblock: with too few MPs present, the law could not be debated. \"The corporate lobby, concentrated in the food industry, has once again won a battle,\" said the Union of Land Workers (UTT), an organization of small producers and farmers. A long investigation published on May 2021 by the news website Eldiario.ar points out the food industry's schemes to try to slow down or modify the law. At the same time, civil society is also applying pressure: On Twitter, the hashtag \"excessive lobbying\" was trending, amid calls for the parliamentary treatment of the text, which finally materialized. The text was then approved at the end of October 2021.\n\nWorld leader in soda consumption\n\nAccording to the government, this law \"empowers the population in the choice of food products.\" In addition, it provides for food education in schools \"to contribute to the development of healthy eating habits and prevent the potential harmful effects of unhealthy eating.\" Mara Garcia, a member of the Argentine Federation of Nutrition Graduates, said in an interview with the newspaper Pagina 12 that \"When we see that the supermarket cart has 80% of its products with this logo, we will become aware of the trash we're eating. And we'll see it on many foods that people do not perceive as bad: yogurt, some juices, oatmeal and cereal cakes â€“ products considered healthy.\"\n\nArgentina's health indicators are alarming. According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Argentina has one of the region's highest and increasing rates of being overweight and obese. Four out of 10 children and adolescents are impacted and seven out of 10 adults. According to PAHO, the three factors most associated with mortality in the country are hypertension, hyperglycemia and excess weight/obesity. \"In recent years, the way we eat has changed from home-cooked meals made with fresh foods to processed or highly processed products that are excessively high in critical nutrients such as added sugars, saturated fats and sodium,\" PAHO said."
