From now, the RAMATEL logo must be used instead of CNC one. For the already approved devices that now bear CNC logo, these requirements must be implemented by August 2022.\n\nMain points of the Resolution:\n\n1. Identification label with the following information must be affixed on the approved telecommunication equipment:\n\n– Standardized RAMATEL isotype and\n\n– Registration number granted by ENACOM for RAMATEL\n\nThe label must be legibly, clearly visible, and indelible on the equipment. It is necessary to choose such shape and size of the logo that will fit the device. The RAMATEL registration number must be placed below the logo. The only case, when it is possible to place it at the right, when there is a horizontal isotype for labeling the product used.\n\n2. If the dimensions do not allow to affix the label on the product, it must be printed on the user’s manual and/or at the corresponding packaging.\n\n3. Modular units must be labeled with their own RAMATEL registration number. If such units are embedded into the device, it will be necessary to indicate that the device contains approved modular units. On the external part of the device itself, the word “CONTAIN” with the RAMATEL identification data of the approved modular unit must be affixed as below:\n\n4. For telecommunication equipment installed on vehicles, the RAMATEL logo and registration number of the approved equipment may appear in the accompanying documents to the vehicles.\n\n5. E-labeling can be used. In this case, the label must be displayed on the device’s own screen. Information on the e-label should be included in the user manual and instructions on how to get access to the information on the e-label must be attached.
