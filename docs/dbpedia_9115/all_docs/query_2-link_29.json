        "text": "Geography\n\nArgentina is a country in the southern half of South America and borders the Atlantic Ocean in the south-east with a total coastline of 4,989 km. Bolivia and Paraguay lie to the north, Brazil and Uruguay to the northeast and Chile to the west. With a total area of around 2.78 million square kilometers, Argentina is the eighth largest country in the world and has a population of 46.65 million people. The north-south extension is over 3,600 km. The area is around 4 times that of Texas.\n\nThe geography is highly diverse and includes the Andes in the west, home to South America's highest mountain, Aconcagua (6,959 m), and the fertile pampas in the center of the country. The Gran Chaco and the wetlands of the Iberá run to the north, while the Patagonian Desert can be found in the south. The semi-desert of Monte on the edge of the Puna in the west is also striking.\n\nMost important cities\n\nArgentina's population density averages 16.8 inhabitants per square kilometer, with most people living in cities. With a strikingly high proportion of 92.3 percent, the vast majority of inhabitants belong to the urban population. The capital Buenos Aires and the cities of Córdoba and Rosario have the highest population figures. The population of the Buenos Aires metropolitan area alone is estimated to be just under 15 million, or around a third of all Argentinians.\n\nAway from the cities, especially in the north and south of the country, the population density is considerably lower. The coastal regions and the pampas in the center of the country are the most densely populated. The country is divided into 23 provinces, each with its own government and constitution, which in turn are subdivided into departments. The exception is the city of Buenos Aires, which is considered autonomous and has a special role as the capital.\n\nCityRegionPopulationBuenos Aires / CapitalBuenos Aires2,570,000CórdobaCenter1,583,000RosarioCenter1,194,000MendozaNuevo Cuyo937,000La PlataBuenos Aires768,000MorónBuenos Aires644,000Santa Fe de la Vera CruzCenter572,000SaltaNorte Grande535,000Mar del PlataBuenos Aires513,000QuilmesBuenos Aires511,000San Miguel de TucumánNorte Grande471,000Libertador General San MartínNorte Grande407,000NeuquénPatagonia378,000AvellanedaCenter344,000CorrientesNorte Grande322,000La RiojaNuevo Cuyo316,000San Salvador de JujuyNorte Grande306,000ResistenciaNorte Grande291,000PosadasNorte Grande276,000Santiago del EsteroNorte Grande252,000ParanáCenter248,000FormosaNorte Grande222,000San LuisNuevo Cuyo170,000San Fernando del Valle de CatamarcaNorte Grande159,000UshuaiaTierra del Fuego58,000\n\nThe difference between the urban area and the city proper alone can be considerable. San Juan, for example, has an urban population of 545,000. However, the actual proper city is much smaller with only 109,000 inhabitants. The difference to metropolitan regions, i.e. conurbations with several cities, is even greater.\n\nPolitical indicators\n\nPolitical stability:\n\n◈\n\nRule of law:\n\n◈\n\nEffectivity:\n\n◈\n\nRegulatory quality:\n\n◈\n\nVoice accountability:\n\n◈\n\nDemocratic values:\n\n◈\n\nDeath penalty:abolished in 2008\n\nExisting trade agreements\n\nCAN - Andean Community of Nations\n\nMercosur - Mercado Común del Sur\n\nAlliances\n\nCELAC - Community of Latin American and Caribbean States\n\nG20 - Developing Nations\n\nG20 - Group of Twenty\n\nOAS - Organization of American States\n\nUN - United Nations\n\nUNESCO\n\nWTO - World Trade Organization"
