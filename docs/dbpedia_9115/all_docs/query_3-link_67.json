        "text": "Nestled between Chile to the west and Uruguay to the east, Argentina occupies much of the Southern Cone of South America.\n\nMap of Argentina (Political)\n\nArgentinaâ€™s neighboring countries are Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil, and Uruguay. Argentina has a long coastline facing the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe map of Argentina above shows the locations of nine major cities, including:\n\nBuenos Aires\n\nCÃ³rdoba\n\nLa Plata\n\nMar del Plata\n\nSan Miguel de TucumÃ¡n\n\nSalta\n\nSanta Fe de la Vera Cruz\n\nVicente LÃ³pez\n\nCorrientes\n\nThe capital city of Argentina is Buenos Aires.\n\nThe population of Argentina in 2021 is around 45.8 million.\n\nArgentina is a Federal Republic with two legislative houses.\n\nWith a total area of 2,780,400 km2, it is the biggest Spanish-speaking country, the second-largest country in South America, and the eighth-largest country globally.\n\nThe official language is Spanish, but the country also recognizes several regional languages:\n\nGuarani\n\nQuechua\n\nQom\n\nMokovi\n\nWichi\n\nWelsh\n\nArgentina is still considered a developing nation with an emerging market, despite having the second-largest economy in South America, after Brazil.\n\nIt produces the most grain of all Latin American nations, comes second in cattle raising, after Brazil, and second in tourism, after Mexico.\n\nThe Argentinian people boast a 99% literacy rate and have access to free higher education through public schools.\n\nArgentina is currently home to eleven UNESCO World Heritage sites:\n\nCueva de las Manos, RÃ­o Pinturas\n\nJesuit Block and Estancias of Cordoba\n\nJesuit Missions of the Guarani\n\nQhapaq Nan Andean Road System\n\nQuebrada de Humahuaca\n\nArchitectural works of Le Corbusier\n\nIguazu National Park\n\nTalampaya Natural Parks\n\nLos Alerces National Park\n\nLos Glaciares National Park\n\nPeninsula Valdes\n\nThere are an additional ten properties on the tentative list. The most recent addition, made in 2019, is the Sanmatinian Routes.\n\nRegions of Argentina Map\n\nAs the above Argentina political map shows, the country can be grouped into three key regional zones: the Northern Regions, the Cuyo, or Central Regions, and Patagonia.\n\nThe Andes cut through all three down the western border that separates Argentina and Chile.\n\nNorthern Regions\n\nThe Northern Regions of Argentina consist of three main divisions.\n\nNorthwest\n\nThe provinces of Catamarca, Jujuy, La Rioja, Salta, Santiago del Estero, and Tucuman form the Argentine Northwest region.\n\nDue to extreme changes in elevation across the region, the climate ranges from cold and dry to warm and wet. Due to these conditions, residents of the region mainly settle along the fertile river valleys.\n\nGran Chaco\n\nThe Chaco, CÃ³rdoba, Formosa, Salta, Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero, and Tucuman provinces are all part of the Gran Chaco region.\n\nThis area is largely subtropical, with many lush forests, savannahs, and marshes. It covers 725,000 km2, spanning parts of Bolivia and Paraguay.\n\nMesopotamia\n\nThe provinces of Misiones, Entre Rios, and Corrientes makeup the Mesopotamia region of Argentina.\n\nThese areas of Argentina are hot and humid, with abundant rainfall reaching up to 2,032 mm per year in the province of Misiones.\n\nIt is also home to the Iguazu Falls and Ibera Wetlands, two of South Americaâ€™s most popular tourist attractions\n\nCuyo (Central Regions)\n\nThe Central Regions of Argentina include:\n\nCuyo\n\nThe extremely mountainous Cuyo region comprises San Juan, San Luis, Mendoza, and La Rioja. The highest mountain of the Andes, Aconcagua, is in Cuyo.\n\nThe mountains put Cuyo in a rainshadow, creating the ideal low humidity conditions for vineyards to thrive. Winemaking accounts for more than 80% of Argentinaâ€™s national production.\n\nLa Pampas\n\nLa Pampas is a massive 1,200,000 km2 region that includes Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Santa Fe, Entre Rios, and Cordoba.\n\nThe flat plains land and well-dispersed rainfall have created ideal conditions for both crops and cattle to thrive, which is why much of the 42,000,000 population works in agriculture or husbandry.\n\nPatagonia\n\nThe southern tip of South America is the Patagonia region, which includes Tierra del Fuego, an archipelago in the Southern Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe provinces of La Pampa, Neuquen, Rio Negro, Chubut, and Santa Cruz are in the Patagonian region.\n\nPatagonia is a thriving tourist destination, especially for backpackers. The Perito Moreno Glacier, located in Santa Cruz, is part of the worldâ€™s third-largest freshwater supply.\n\nConnections with Antarctica\n\nThe Argentine Antarctic Institute, founded in 1951, establishes Argentinian bases in Antarctica, where scientists from the South American nation study a range of fields, including biology, chemistry, and oceanography.\n\nCurrently, Argentina claims rights to a majority of the Antarctic Peninsula, from 25Â° W to 74Â° W, then back to 60Â° S, at the South Pole.\n\nThey have a total of 13 bases, seven of which are closed during the winter and six available for year-round staffing.\n\nProvinces of Argentina\n\nThis Argentina map shows the borders between the 24 provinces.\n\nEach of Argentinaâ€™s provinces has its own constitution, but the nation as a whole is a federal system with overarching laws that override individual province laws.\n\nThe provinces also host their own justice system, police force, and congress. Apart from the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, which is split into partidos and localidades, the provinces are divided further into departments and municipalities.\n\nAutonomous City of Buenos Aires\n\nLocated on the southeastern coast of Argentina, Buenos Aires is the capital and largest city, with an estimated population of 17,196,396.\n\nIt is the most-visited city in South America.\n\nBuenos Aires\n\nBuenos Aires province is separate from the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe capital is La Plata.\n\nIt is the largest and most populous province, at 307,571 km2, with a population of 15,625,084.\n\nCatamarca\n\nCatamarca is a northwestern province with an area of 102,602 km2 and a population of 367,828.\n\nThe capital city is San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca.\n\nChaco\n\nChaco is a northeastern province with an area of 99,633 km2 and a population of 1,055,259.\n\nThe capital city is Resistencia.\n\nChubut\n\nChubut is a southern province with an area of 224,686 km2 and a population of 509,108.\n\nThe capital city is Rawson.\n\nCordoba\n\nCordoba is a central province with an area of 165,321 km2 and a population of 3,308,876.\n\nThe capital city is Cordoba.\n\nCorrientes\n\nCorrientes is a northeastern province with an area of 88,199 km2 and a population of 992,595.\n\nThe capital city is Corrientes.\n\nEntre Rios\n\nEntre Rios is a northeastern province with an area of 99,633 km2 and a population of 1,055,259.\n\nThe capital city is ParanÃ¡.\n\nFormosa\n\nFormosa is a northeastern province with an area of 72,066 km2 and a population of 530,162.\n\nThe capital city is Formosa.\n\nJujuy\n\nJujuy is a northwestern province with an area of 52,219 km2 and a population of 673,307.\n\nThe capital city is San Salvador de Jujuy.\n\nLa Pampa\n\nLa Pampa is a central province with an area of 143,440 km2 and a population of 535,184.\n\nThe capital city is Santa Rosa.\n\nLa Rioja\n\nLa Rioja is a province with an area of 89,680 km2 and a population of 333,642.\n\nThe capital city is La Rioja.\n\nMendoza\n\nMendoza is a western-central province with an area of 148,827 km2 and a population of 1,738,929.\n\nThe capital city is Mendoza.\n\nMisiones\n\nMisiones is a northeastern province with an area of 29,801 km2 and a population of 1,101,593.\n\nThe capital city is Posadas.\n\nNeuquen\n\nNeuquen is a western province with an area of 94,078 km2 and a population of 551,226.\n\nThe capital city is Neuquen.\n\nRio Negro\n\nRio Negro is a central province with an area of 203,013 km2 and a population of 638,645.\n\nThe capital city is Viedma.\n\nSalta\n\nSalta is a northwest province with an area of 155,488 km2 and a population of 1,214,441.\n\nThe capital city is Salta.\n\nSan Juan\n\nSan Juan is a western province with an area of 89,651 km2 and a population of 681,055.\n\nThe capital city is San Juan.\n\nSan Luis\n\nSan Luis is a northeastern province with an area of 76,748 km2 and a population of 432,310.\n\nThe capital city is San Luis.\n\nSanta Cruz\n\nSanta Cruz is a northern province with an area of 243,964 km2 and a population of 273,964.\n\nThe capital city is Rio Gallegos.\n\nSanta Fe\n\nSanta Fe is a central province with an area of 133,007 km2 and a population of 3,194,537.\n\nThe capital city is Santa De de la Vera Cruz.\n\nSantiago del Estero\n\nSantiago del Estero is a northern province with an area of 136,351 km2 and a population of 874,006.\n\nThe capital city is Santiago del Estero.\n\nTierra del Fuego, AntÃ¡rtida, e Islas del AtlÃ¡ntico Sur\n\nTierra del Fuego, Antartida, e Islas del Atlantico Sur is a southern province with an area of 21,263 km2 and a population of 127,205.\n\nThe capital city is Ushuaia.\n\nTucuman\n\nChaco is a northwestern province with an area of 22,524 km2 and a population of 1,448,188.\n\nThe capital city is San Miguel de Tucuman."
