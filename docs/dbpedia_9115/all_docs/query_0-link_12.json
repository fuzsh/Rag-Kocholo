        "text": "The Ente Nacional de Comunicaciones (ENACOM), the authority for granting radio telecommunications manufacturers access to the Argentinian market, published a new resolution in the Official Bulletin of Argentina in August of 2020, introducing a new label for telecommunications equipment approvals.\n\nAfter a two year transition period for the implementation of the new labeling requirements, this mandatory Resolution No. 854/2020 will officially go into effect this year, as of August 12, 2022.\n\nImportant Changes to Note\n\nThe main changes included in Resolution No. 854/2020 are:\n\nThe original labeling identifier will be changed from the CNC ID and logo to a new Registro de Actividades y Materiales de Telecomunicaciones (RAMATEL) registration number and seal logo.\n\nThis identification label with a standardized RAMATEL logo and registration number must be clearly affixed in a visible area on the approved telecommunications equipment.\n\nAny telecommunication equipment that has been installed in a vehicle must include the RAMATEL logo and restoration number on any accompanying documentation for the vehicle.\n\nID numbers remain the same if the renewal application is submitted before the certificate expires.\n\nE-labelling is an option as per the Resolutionâ€™s instructions.\n\nAll radio and telecommunication equipment are required to adhere to this labeling scheme in order to enter the Argentinian market. Manufacturers who fail to adhere to these requirements will not be successful in submitting their products to market. Work with your local Nemko office to make sure your organization is ready for this upcoming change in August."
