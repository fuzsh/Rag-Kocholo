        "text": "Here’s a miscellany of food things that have caught my eye in Argentina.\n\nNifty Product: José tea bags\n\n4 packets each of yerba mate, yerba mate with ginger, black tea with rosehip, black tea with cinnamon and clove, perpermint with melissa, corinader, and lemon verbena. Delicious.\n\nOver-enthusiastic labeling?Do I really want to know the dairy vaccination schedule and the variation in bacteria count in the milk over the course of a week? Seems a bit at odds with this “most serene” milk.\n\nCrackers\n\nArgentina is prime cream cracker land. Testimony to its position as part of the informal British empire for much of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. I wonder why Argentine cream crackers come in at half the size of British Jacobs cream crackers? Indeed I wonder when the British lost control of this market (assuming they did)? I notice Criollitas were founded in 1943. Perhaps previously it was British cream crackers and they lost the market during World War II.\n\nDulce de leche\n\nArgentina is famous for its taste for this sweet boiled down milk. It crops up in all kinds of foods. I was particularly tickled to see it as an alternative to white cream in American oreos. The wonders of globalization.\n\nRelated"
