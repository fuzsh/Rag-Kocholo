        "text": "SG 109/24\n\nThe Argentine Ministry of Economy has issued Resolution 49/2024 to streamline labelling requirements for imported textiles, garments and footwear. Specifically, it repeals Resolution No. 404/16 of the Ministry of Commerce and modifies articles in Resolutions No. 26/96 and No. 850/96.\n\nArgentina has recently updated its labeling requirements for imported textiles, garments and footwear products. The revisions repeal and replace specific articles in previous regulations concerning labeling requirements. These changes are aimed at simplifying labeling practices and enhancing trade efficiency for these products in Argentina.\n\nHere are the key updates:\n\nRepeal and replacement\n\nLabels or text shall present the corresponding information in Spanish\n\nThe identification of the exporter on the labels or text shall be optional\n\nUnique Tax Identification Code (CUIT):\n\nThe name of the importer on labels for imported goods can be replaced with the corresponding Unique Tax Identification Code (CUIT)\n\nMercosur-wide requirements:\n\nTextile products sold across Mercosur countries (Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil) must carry labels with specific information as required by the Mercosur Technical Regulation on textile product labeling. This includes fiber composition, country of origin, care instructions, and details of the domestic producer or importer\n\nAdditionally, with the repeal of Resolution No. 404/16, the new resolution removes the requirement to submit a Declaration of Composition of Products (DJCP) as a prerequisite for commercialization. This resolution takes effect the day after its publication in the Official Gazette.\n\nReference:\n\nLegislación y Avisos Oficiales\n\nProyecto de resolución IF-2024-14901848-APN-DGDMDP#MEC\n\nSGS Global Softlines has an extensive network of over 40 laboratories worldwide, with a strong team of committed professionals from multi-disciplinary backgrounds.
