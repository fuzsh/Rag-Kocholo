        "text": "Duty and tax will be charged only on imports into Argentina where the total CIF value of the import exceeds Argentina’s minimum value threshold (de minimis). Argentina does not have a de minimis for courier shipments, which means duty and tax fees are charged on all courier imports. The only time goods are exempt from duty and tax on a courier shipment is when they receive preferential treatment through trade agreements.\n\nFor postal shipments, however, the duty and tax de minimis is 50 USD and any import exceeding this value will be subject to duty and tax. Once a sender has exceeded the twelve-shipment de minimis threshold, the 50 USD de minimis goes away.\n\nDuty and tax de minimis\n\nPostal shipments\n\nTax de minimis: 50 USD\n\nDuty De minimis: 50 USD\n\nThe de minimis for postal shipments is only valid for 12 shipments per year.\n\nCourier shipments\n\nTax de minimis: 0 USD\n\nDuty de minimis: 0 USD\n\nApplied to the CIF value of the order\n\nDuty range\n\n0-35%\n\nApplied to the CIF value of the order\n\nSome products have specific duty rates, meaning their duty is based on the quantity of the goods in the shipment, e.g. 0.7 cents per kilogram.\n\nPostal shipments\n\nDuty fees should not be paid as long as the postal value limit of 12 shipments with a total of 50 USD per shipment annually or 600 USD annually is not surpassed.\n\nDo not pay duty on postal shipment…\n\nIf the value of your postal shipment does not exceed 50 USD.\n\nRequired to pay duty on postal shipments…\n\nIf the value of your postal shipment exceeds 50 USD, you will pay a 50% duty fee on the surplus.\n\nFor example: If your postal shipment has a value of 80 USD, it exceeds the 50 USD de minimis by 30 USD. You will pay a 50% import duty fee on that surplus of 30 USD. In this case, the duty fee is 15 USD (50% of 30 USD).\n\nIf you exceed 12 personal shipments in a year or ship over 600 USD worth of postal shipments, then you will pay a 50% duty fee on the total value of your shipment.\n\nFor example: If your postal shipment has a value of 80 USD, then you will pay a 50% duty fee on that shipment. In this case, the duty fee is 40 USD (50% of 80 USD).\n\nIf it is your first time surpassing the 12 postal shipments with a 50 USD value or the 600 USD limit, then a 50 USD franchise dollars can be discounted, and then a 50% duty fee is charged on the rest of the value.\n\nFor example: If a product is purchased for 550 USD, taxes must be paid for 250 USD (550 USD-50 USD=500 USD) and (50% of 500 USD=250 USD).\n\nThis discount will not be applied to subsequent purchases.\n\nArgentina is part of at least 20 trade agreements that offer a zero or highly discounted duty rate for goods manufactured in participating countries.\n\nRegional trade agreements\n\nPreferential trade agreements\n\nArgentina is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\nAs a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Argentina must abide by the most-favored-nation (MFN) clause, which requires a country to provide any concessions, privileges, or immunities granted to one nation in a trade agreement to all other WTO member countries. For example, if one country reduces duties by 10% for a particular WTO country, the MFN clause states that all WTO members will receive the same 10% reduction."
