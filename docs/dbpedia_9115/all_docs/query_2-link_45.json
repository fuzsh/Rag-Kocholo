        "text": "Argentina doesn’t usually make it onto the top ten lists of popular travel destinations, but it should. Just because it’s not as well known as Hawaii or Paris, doesn’t mean that it’s not as incredible. Between the rugged Andes Mountains and the vast plains of Patagonia, it’s a land of unparalleled beauty. Add in some amazing food, wine, and culture and you have an experience that rivals even the most famous cities in the world. Find out what makes Argentina so special and why you should add it to your top ten countries to visit.\n\nWorld Famous Argentine Wine\n\nLove wine? Then a visit to Mendoza in the heart of Argentina’s wine country is a must! With over 1,200 wineries set against the breath-taking backdrop of the Andes Mountains, Mendoza is a world unto itself. Nearly two-thirds of all Argentinian wine is produced here including a wide variety of full-bodied Malbecs.¹ Take a tour to learn about the wine-making process and enjoy a few samples of the best that Argentina has to offer.\n\nAsado—Argentine BBQ\n\nWhat pairs well with red wine? Quality beef! Argentina has long been one of the world’s largest exporters of beef. The Pampas, a region of fertile lowland plains in southern Argentina, is the perfect spot for raising large herds of grass-fed cattle. It’s also the birthplace of Argentina’s national dish—Asado. Asado is commonly referred to as Argentinian BBQ, but it’s more than just a meal: it’s a cultural tradition. Friends and family gather to slow roast meat over an open coal grill called the parrilla. Pair it with a glass of Malbec wine, a fresh salad, and a baguette and you have the quintessential Argentinian meal.\n\nThe History and Culture of Patagonia\n\nThe Pampas region in Argentina gave rise to more than just the cattle industry. The wild, vast plains helped create a culture of nomadic, freedom-loving cowboys called gauchos. Often seen as both outlaws and folk heroes, the gauchos are expert horse riders and masters of the land. Unfortunately, like the cowboys of North America, modernization has caused their numbers to decline. But you can still see them in action by booking a visit to an estancia (an Argentine ranch). Here, gauchos take visitors on trail rides and regal them with traditional stories and music. When not entertaining tourists, they still work the land, riding horses and herding cattle across the pampas.\n\nArgentine’s Glacier National Park\n\nWhen you picture South America, you probably imagine tropical forests and beaches, not giant sheets of ice. So you might be surprised to find out that Argentina is the home Los Glaciares National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With 47 major glaciers covering over 1,600 square miles, it is a true wonder of the natural world. The crown jewel of Los Glaciares park is the Perito Moreno glacier. It’s one of the few glaciers left in the world that is still growing, despite climate change. Currently, it towers nearly 196 feet above the waters of Lake Argentina. ²\n\nThe Iguazu Falls\n\nFew places inspire more awe than Iguazu Falls. Nestled between the border of Brazil and Argentina, it’s one of the world’s largest waterfall systems. Every second, enough water flows through it during the rainy season to fill up five Olympic-sized swimming pools. In comparison, Niagara Falls is only half as tall and one third as wide.³ Visitors can get up-close to the falls by walking along a series for footbridges or opting for a boat or helicopter tour.\n\nThe Unique Wildlife of Argentina\n\nArgentina is the perfect destination for animal lovers! From the adorable capybaras (giant guinea pigs) to the fierce and elusive jaguar, you can find animals here that are uniquely suited to the vast wilderness of Argentina. It’s one of the only countries in the world where you can see both flamingos and penguins in the wild. Not to mention it’s home to South America’s famous camel/llama, the guanaco.\n\nThe End of The World\n\nHave you ever wondered what it would be like to visit the end of the world? Then take a trip to the world’s southernmost city, Ushuaia, on the Tierra del Fuego archipelago. While it’s mostly known as the gateway to Antarctica, it’s more than just the berth of Antarctic cruise ships. There are glaciers to hike, slopes to ski, restaurants to enjoy, and incredible scenery to view. It might be the end of the world, but for many, it’s just the beginning of a grand adventure!\n\nInterested in learning more about Argentina? Check out our Patagonia & Mendoza Adventure tour!
