        "text": "Geography\n\nArgentina exhibits an enormous contrast between the immense eastern plains and the impressive Andes mountain range in the west, which is also the border with Chile, and boasts the highest peak in the Western hemisphere: the 6,959 m high Aconcagua.\n\nFrom Jujuy to Tierra del Fuego, the Andes ranges show marvelous contrasts: the Northwest plateaus, the lake region, the forests and glaciers in the Patagonia.\n\nIn the north, Chaco is a forested area linked to rivers Bermejo, Salado and Pilcomayo.\n\nLocated between the Paraná and Uruguay rivers, the Argentine Mesopotamia (provinces of Entre Ríos, Corrientes and Misiones) is formed by low hills, where pools and marshlands evidence the ancient courses of these great rivers. In some places within the subtropical rain forest, there are fissures which provide spectacular phenomena such as the Iguazú Falls.\n\nThe Pampas, in the center of Argentina, is the largest and best-known area of plains. Agricultural and livestock activities are performed in this area, which includes the province of Buenos Aires, the northeast of La Pampa, the south of Córdoba and south of Santa Fe. To the south, the plains give way to small hills in Tandil and de la Ventana, and to the west, to the Córdoba hills.\n\nTowards the south, from the Andes to the sea, we find the sterile and stony plateaus of Patagonia, swept by the wind during most of the year. The Atlantic coast, lined with high cliffs, forms massive indentations like the Peninsula Valdés, with its spectacular and unique colonies of sea animals.\n\nArgentina’s official tourism website contains tons of information about the country and places to visit. Buenos Aires has flights to the main attractions in the country. There are daily flights to Iguazu Falls, Salta, Jujuy, Mendoza, Bariloche, Puerto Madryn, or Ushuaia, as well as other attractive places in countries in the region, such as Santiago, Montevideo, Rio de Janeiro, etc.\n\nClimate\n\nThe country’s territory offers a wide variety of climates: subtropical in the north, sub- Antarctic in the southern Patagonia, and mild and humid in the Pampas plains. Media temperature from November to March is 23° C, and 12° C from June to September.\n\nPopulation\n\nArgentina’s current population is more than 38 million inhabitants, almost half of which live in the city and the province of Buenos Aires. Population density calculated on a national basis is 14 inhabitants per square kilometer.\n\nLanguage\n\nSpanish is the official language of the Argentine Republic. In Buenos Aires, some “lunfardo” expressions -city slang - are used.\n\nElectricity\n\nElectric power in Argentina is 220 volt, 50-cycle alternating current. Power outlets have 2 cylindrical holes or 2 flat holes with ground connection. It is convenient to bring an adaptor for these outlets to use your electric devices without problems\n\nSanitary Information\n\nVaccination is neither obligatory nor necessary to visit Buenos Aires since the city is safe from the sanitary viewpoint. The public water supply is reliable.\n\nPublic hospitals (available for tourists) offer a 24-hour emergency service, without charge. Argentine physicians are considered excellent professionals worldwide. The ambulance emergency service (SAME) is also for free."
