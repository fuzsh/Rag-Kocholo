        "text": "This blog is to help you learn about where Argentina is located, discover places to visit while you travel in Argentina and view an Argentina map of our suggestions. This is a comprehensive article for anyone thinking about doing tourism in Argentina.\n\nWhere is Argentina? That may sound like crazy question for many people, but according to Google, \"Where is Argentina?\" is one of the most searched for Argentina terms in the USA. I am not judging anyone here. Many Americans are geographically challenged and this is not because we (yes, we) are stupid. I prefer to use the word \"sheltered\", yes, we are very sheltered from the world. What do I mean by this? Well, many people may not know where is Argentina because they simply lack exposure.\n\nOne geography class 20 years ago was not enough, the local news doesn't often mention the \"world\", local newspapers are lucky to have an extensive international section even national papers lack on the \"foreign news\" front. My point is that Americans can literally live their whole lives not knowing where Argentina is, let alone the rest of the countries of the world.\n\nSo where is Argentina? Argentina is located where the map ends, on the southernmost tip of the planet, at the end of South America. It is a large country, the second largest in South America dominating the major part of the continent. However, compared with the US, Argentina is a bit less than three-tenths the size with a total area of 2,766,890 km² (1,068,302 mi²). Argentina is 3,650 km (2,268 mi) long from North to South and 1,430 km (889 mi) across from east to west.\n\nOn the north, Argentina is bounded by Bolivia, to the northeast by Paraguay, to the east by Brazil, Uruguay and the Atlantic Ocean, and to both the south and west by the long nation of Chile. In total, Argentina has over 9,665 km (6,000 mi) of border.\n\nNow that we know the answer to \"where is Argentina,\" we can take a look at this vast and beautiful country filled with adventures, mighty waterfalls, high mountains, vast plains, impressive ice glaciers, unique cities, tango, natural charms, amazing food and nice people.\n\nIf you are planning on traveling to Argentina or traveling through Argentina, it is a good idea to get familiarized with the country so that you can plan your trip accordingly.\n\nThe following is a map of Argentina with the top 10 places to visit while you are traveling around Argentina. This Argentina map is available online and is interactive.\n\n1- Buenos Aires is known to be a very European feeling cosmopolitan city. The population descends mainly from Italians and Spaniards giving the city a rich cultural heritage and unique architecture. Don't miss a good tango class, the bohemian San Telmo neighborhood, the famous Recoleta cemetery where Eva Perón is buried. Study with don Quijote's partner school in Buenos Aires, marked on the Argentina map with a special symbol, to really discover the unique Argentine accent and culture.\n\n2- The \"pampas\" are not marked on our Argentina map because the Argentine pampas are great plains located around the capital city of Buenos Aires. Famous Argentine \"gauchos\", or cowboys, can be found working the land that is also spotted with many lovely 19th century homes. This beautiful area is open for tourism.\n\n3- Peninsula Valdes is home to some of the world's best wildlife reserves in Argentina. Tourists traveling to Argentina often head to this area to watch whales breeding off shore. Sea lions, elephant seals, Orca whales and penguins are also common sights.\n\n4- Ushuaia, as you can see on the map of Argentina, is located at the very tip of South America in Tierra del Fuego (Land of Fire) and is the southernmost town in the world. From this point in the world, you can board an excursion to Antartica!\n\n5- Patagonia glaciers & Mount Fitz Roy: Some of the world's largest advancing glaciers are located in the Patagonia region of Argentina. If you are traveling through Argentina, make sure to stay a night in one of the several towns located in the area to cater to visitors who come to see the Perito Moreno glacier and the Upsala glacier. The Patagonia region is marked on the Argentina map below. Mount Fitz Roy is located about 130 miles to the north of the famous Patagonia glaciers.
