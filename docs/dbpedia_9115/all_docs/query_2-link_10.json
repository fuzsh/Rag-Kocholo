        "text": "Overview\n\nArgentina’s internet environment remained free during the coverage period, as users generally experienced unfettered access to online content and were able to engage freely on social media. The Supreme Court of Justice ruled that the “right to be forgotten” does not apply to content in the public interest, setting a strong legal precedent in favor of freedom of expression in some cases of intermediary liability. Argentines also continued to use online platforms to engage on political issues, including women’s rights and economic concerns, and call for offline mobilization. Despite these positive developments, the attempted assassination of Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner by an alleged right-wing extremist in September 2022 sparked controversy around the role of social media in fueling gender-based violence and hate speech more broadly in the country."
