        "text": "Selema\n\nSelema has more than 40 years of experience in the furniture business, time that has been well spent traveling the world in search of ideas, textures, and materials while exchanging knowledge with international designers. Many of their products, however, feature something found a bit closer to home: local Patagonian Lenga wood, a material with a fine and even texture.\n\n“We feel that our furniture is part of the most intimate and special moments of each of our clients,” the brand shares, “that is why they deserve all this love that we put into what we do.”\n\nBerry Design\n\nInterior Designer Carolina Ball launched Berry Design with a line of wallpapers after several years of working as a designer and decorator. Today, those wallpapers are being designed and produced along with woven and vinyl rugs, blankets, and a collection of fabrics. Made to order, the products on offer can be customized and produced across the entire line of papers, fabrics, and wovens.\n\ntheStampa\n\nThe brand was founded to create functional, durable products that can be integrated into any space in the house through prints and textiles offered in neutral tones. All products are designed and carefully stamped by specialized artisan hands in the brand’s Buenos Aires workshop, using only Argentine raw materials, such as heavy weight cotton canvas that provides rigidity and durability to the products."
