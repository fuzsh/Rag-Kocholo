        "text": "Argentina boasts 18 ecoregions that make up a complex territory, including a subtropical zone, the Antarctic, high mountains, and some of the deepest parts of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAccording to the National Biodiversity Strategy, Argentina is home to over a thousand bird species and hundreds of reptiles, mammals, and amphibians. Unfortunately, 25% of them are under the threat of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\nLike many countries in the region, Argentina faces significant challenges related to the constant expansion of agriculture and livestock farming. The growing global demand for food means that cultivated areas continue to increase. Furthermore, deforestation and land-use change have become significant environmental challenges; thousands of Argentinians across the country suffer from droughts and floods annually.\n\nSolutions require systemic thinking, focusing on sustainable models to ensure regeneration and, thus, a successful long-term transition for Argentina, the region, and the world.\n\nTNC works with a collaborative and systemic approach, connecting people with nature through science, smart networks, and shared learning. Involving producers in efforts to maintain the natural foundation of productive lands demonstrates that nature and development can not only coexist but also drive the conservation of forests, grasslands, wetlands, and other ecosystems across the productive landscape, generating positive (scalable and sustainable over time) impacts on the economic, environmental, and social levels."
