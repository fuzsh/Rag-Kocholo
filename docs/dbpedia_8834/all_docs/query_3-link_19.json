        "text": "Exeter boss Matt Taylor says he was left struggling for words following Jay Stansfield's debut for the club.\n\nThe 19-year-old Fulham loanee came off the bench in Saturday's League One victory over MK Dons.\n\nHe wore the number nine shirt, once worn by his father and Grecians favourite Adam, who died aged just 31, external in 2010 from bowel cancer.\n\n\"I'm never an emotional person but that was one where you start choking up a little bit,\" Taylor said.\n\nEngland Under-20s striker Stansfield was born in Exeter at a time when his dad was a player at St James Park.\n\nHe played more than 140 games for the Devon club across four seasons, scoring 37 goals.\n\nHis son progressed through the Grecians academy before moving to Fulham in August 2019. He joined the League One club on a season-long loan on Friday, having made his Premier League debut last month.\n\nStansfield got a standing ovation as he came off the bench to replace Sam Nombe in the 79th minute."
