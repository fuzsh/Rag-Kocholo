        "text": "Jay Stansfield has signed a new contract with Fulham until the summer of 2024.\n\nThe 19-year-old striker had six months remaining on his previous deal and had been tracked by Premier League sides.\n\nHe has now committed to stay at Craven Cottage for at least another two seasons, with Fulham holding the option of extending his contract by a further year.\n\nStansfield has stepped into the first-team picture this season and has been training full time with the squad since the appointment of Marco Silva last summer.\n\nHe has made an impression on the Portuguese coach and has also featured in eight match-day squads this season, despite suffering a knee injury that required surgery in November.\n\nHe made his first full start against Birmingham City in the Carabao Cup in August and marked the occasion by scoring his first senior goal, a long-range strike from distance.\n\nStansfield, who has been capped for England at under-18 and under-20 levels, joined Fulham from Exeter City in August 2019 and immediately found prolific form, scoring 22 goals in 14 under-18 appearances. His form saw earnt him the academy player of the year award in 2020, and he made his debut under Scott Parker in January of that year in the FA Cup.\n\nAlthough an ankle injury kept him sidelined for four months during the 2020-21 season, he returned to form last year and helped Steve Wigley’s under-18 side retain their Premier League South title.\n\nHe has scored four goals in six Premier League 2 appearances this season, in addition to his two first-team appearances.\n\n(Photo: Charlotte Tattersall/Getty Images)\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nHow the death of footballer Adam Stansfield inspired his family to change lives\n\nIs this significant for Fulham?\n\nStansfield has long been earmarked as a talent for the future and Fulham will be both delighted and relieved that he has put pen to paper.\n\nThe club have not always found it easy to tie down some of their best young talents in recent years, as reflected by the ongoing contract situation surrounding Fabio Carvalho this season, but in Stansfield, they have another bright prospect whose potential is high, and one that will be here to stay for a while longer.\n\nWhat does Stansfield need to do to break into the first team?\n\nStansfield has become Fulham’s third-choice striker this season behind in-form Aleksandar Mitrovic and summer signing Rodrigo Muniz.\n\nHe has shown though that he can play in a deeper role in attack and is a more dynamic player, which offers variation in the Fulham front line.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether he explores a loan option at some point, particularly if Fulham are promoted to the Premier League this year."
