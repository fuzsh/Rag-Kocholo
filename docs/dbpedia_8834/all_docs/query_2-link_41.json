        "text": "“I’ve been better,” Matt Taylor, the Exeter City manager, says with more than a touch of understatement. “You’ve got to rub yourself down and get on with it, I’m afraid. It’s brutal at times. Absolutely brutal.”\n\nIt is Tuesday evening, less than 24 hours after Exeter’s hopes of winning promotion to League Two were shattered in a play-off final that turned into an ordeal for Taylor and his players as Northampton totally overpowered them.\n\nTaylor could have been forgiven for closing his eyes and hoping it was all a bad dream on the long journey back to Exeter but he did nothing of the sort. “I actually watched the game on the way back, I wanted to watch it straight away, just to assess it in a bit more detail. But it wasn’t rocket science, we weren’t able to cope,” he says.\n\nEmpty, eerie and cavernous, Wembley felt like a desperately lonely place for a manager to watch his team get heavily beaten. All the more so after they were forced to play the final half an hour with 10 men against a side who were already 2-0 up. “Seeing some of those players go through that was difficult,” Taylor admits.\n\nOn Saturday night, at Exeter’s stadium, he stood in front of his squad before training and delivered a five-minute talk on the importance of “emotional control” in big games. “Unfortunately, we didn’t see that in the heat of the moment,” Taylor adds, ruefully.\n\nThe message got lost by one of his most experienced players. Dean Moxey’s red card for a reckless lunge compounded a miserable night for Exeter, who have now lost three of the last four League Two play-off finals and must be close to reaching the stage where they hate the sight of Wembley. Afterwards, Taylor talked about “hidden demons” in the minds of some of his players. He also spoke about feeling “powerless” as Northampton, like a boxer fighting at the wrong weight, pummelled Exeter.\n\nIt was a chastening end to a season that had promised so much for Exeter and, from a personal perspective, a disappointing way to sign off an enjoyable and fascinating fortnight spent following the fortunes of a League Two club in the play-offs during lockdown.\n\nOne team-talk started with a rollercoaster underneath the stand. Another finished alongside cardboard cut-outs. A goalkeeper had a meltdown and turned on his coach, while the defender who scored past him ended up being released the next day. There were short trips to the seaside and long throws into the area. It was fish and chips for lunch followed by a swab down the throat.\n\nGareth Law, Exeter’s physiotherapist, was running towards the practice pitch holding his thumbs up. It was shortly after 11am and the news had just come through, via the club doctor, that Pierce Sweeney’s coronavirus test had come back negative. Sweeney’s girlfriend’s mother had been taken ill at the start of the week and Exeter feared that the defender could be carrying the virus, leaving Taylor with little option but to make him train away from the rest of the group on the eve of the play-offs.\n\n“I was sweating on that test because he plays right side of a back three and that’s the one position which we’ve not got cover for,” Taylor says. “So yesterday and today we were doing a little bit as a back three and a little bit as a back four — if he wasn’t available I was going to change the whole formation. He (Sweeney) did a jog on the astro, away from everyone, then we got the results and literally called him across just in time for set pieces to finish with. That was his first interaction with the team for two days.”\n\nTalking the day before Exeter’s play-off semi-final first leg against Colchester, Taylor shakes his head and smiles as he reflects on a strange few weeks. His players, who were all furloughed across April and May, are about to take part in two play-off matches in the space of five days after less than a fortnight of contact training. They have not played a competitive match for more than three months and were unable to even squeeze in a friendly before facing Colchester.\n\n“We had all these offers from Cardiff, Bristol City, Swansea and Reading, but they all wanted to play the weekend of the 13th-14th, which was basically four or five days away from the first leg. And we couldn’t afford the risk of an injury,” Taylor explains.\n\nExeter’s squad is already stretched. Three players have tested positive for coronavirus — two on the day they came back and one after training resumed. Taylor says it would be impossible to think about starting any of that trio against Colchester given they were forced to self-isolate for 11 days while the rest of the players were training together and building fitness.\n\nOn top of that, eight players are out of contract at the end of the month and all of them were informed before they reported back for the play-offs that the club would be unable to offer them a deal for next season because of the financial fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. “It’s not my decision,” Taylor says. “But obviously I was part of those conversations and it’s the right decision, because it’s an uncertain market we’re going into.\n\n“So those eight players all knew the circumstances. Two decided not to come back — they didn’t want to risk their family’s health and their own health in terms of an injury, and we said ‘no problem whatsoever’. There was no pressure from myself or the club. Thankfully six have come back.”\n\nAlthough it has clearly been a tricky time at Exeter, Taylor is certainly not complaining or looking for any sympathy. He quickly makes the point that Colchester, Northampton and Cheltenham — the other three clubs in the League Two play-offs — will have been experiencing exactly the same problems, so much so that nobody will have any idea what sort of team their opponents will put out.\n\n“It’s incredible,” Taylor says. “Because we’re a young coaching group, we go into such detail on the opposition. Detail, detail, detail. But I could not second-guess Colchester’s team. And I’m sure he’s the same with me.”\n\nUltimately, Taylor is grateful that Exeter’s season is still alive and that a club that “has been in the top three for something stupid, like 95 per cent of the season” remain in with a chance of winning promotion.\n\n“Points per game is horrible but you have to accept it,” says Taylor, whose team had their worst spell of the season — two points from four games — just prior to lockdown. “The fact that we’ve got an opportunity — Cheltenham, in theory, could have gone up as the fourth team because they’re in that position — gives the players something.”\n\nIt doesn’t take long in Taylor’s company to realise why Exeter saw him as the obvious choice to take over from Paul Tisdale, whose 12-year reign at St James Park ended in the summer of 2018, when he turned down a new contract on the back of a second successive play-off final defeat and amid signs that his relationship with some inside the club had been deteriorating for a while.\n\nAged 38, Taylor made more than 150 appearances under Tisdale for Exeter and also worked with him as a coach. In other words, he knew the league, the strengths and weaknesses of the squad and, most significantly of all, understood the DNA of the club, which is graffitied across the front of the academy changing rooms, a stone’s throw from where we are talking.\n\nThe images of Ethan Ampadu, Ollie Watkins, Jordon Moore-Taylor, Christy Pym and Moxey, who has returned to the club for a second spell, provide a permanent reminder of the players Exeter have produced. Taylor points to another sign — the all-weather 4G pitch. “That’s is a prime example of how the club is run,” he says. “When Matt Grimes went to Swansea, they invested £1 million into this, basically saying it will provide for our academy for the next 20 years.”\n\nExeter continue to reap the rewards, with Archie Collins and Jack Sparkes among the academy graduates who are currently on a coach to Colchester. Taylor, who will travel up later, thought that the players would have to make the 250-mile trip on the day of the game. “Then, all of a sudden, this Holiday Inn opened up and I said, ‘Book it!’” he says, smiling. “I still had people at the club saying, ‘We need to know the cost’. I said, ‘That’s non-negotiable. If we get the opportunity to stay at a hotel, we have to pay that’.”\n\nWith the changing rooms out of bounds at Colchester, Taylor plans to deliver his team-talk at the hotel — and he won’t be overcomplicating anything. “Their heads will be a frying pan of expectation and anticipation. Anything I say will be going in one ear and out the other. So I’ll speak to them briefly and that won’t be tactically,” he says. “It will basically be a thank you for how they’ve adapted to what we’ve done for the last few weeks in terms of their effort. ‘You’ve shown you’re good people, now go and show you’re good footballers, and this is your opportunity’.”\n\nJake Taylor is leaning over an advertisement hoarding with a towel around his waist, talking to his manager while queuing up for a shower after getting undressed in the bowels of the stadium. It is a strange image that sums up a strange day. “A surreal experience,” says Exeter’s captain. “You’re getting changed underneath the stand where the supporters would be queuing up for their beers and their pies.”\n\nThe first leg is over, although in many ways it never got started. There were only two shots on target, both from Cohen Bramall, the Colchester left-back, and both free kicks. The first was tipped over the bar and the second, 10 minutes from time, beat Lewis Ward at his near post to give Colchester a slender but important lead.\n\nExeter and Colchester looked what they were: two teams who have had nowhere near long enough to prepare. In truth, it was more of a pre-season friendly than a play-off semi-final. “Tired bodies and tired minds at the end,” says Taylor, the Exeter manager.\n\nThe whole experience seemed odd, from the sight of 14 cardboard cut-out Exeter fans in one of the stands to the sound of a play-off game taking place to the backdrop of traffic going past on the nearby A12. To cap it all, around 20 Colchester supporters are waiting in the stadium car park afterwards, holding aloft flags, banging a drum and singing “We shall not be moved”.\n\nThe Exeter team coach gets back at 2am. “There were loads of road closures and I think we went past a junction we should have dropped someone off at, so we had to go back,” Jake Taylor adds. “But we’ve done these bus journeys so many times now, so everyone is pretty used to being on the bus until ridiculous o’clock. If you can’t get used to long journeys, it’s probably not the right club for you.”\n\n“I’m not getting in,” Randell Williams says.\n\nWayne Carlisle, Exeter’s assistant manager, looks over at Jake Taylor. “Skipper, you’ve got to have a word with him. Are we going to carry him in?”\n\n“Come on, Rands!” Taylor says, smiling.\n\nIt’s Friday afternoon, 24 hours after Exeter lost 1-0 at Colchester, and the starting XI are on the beach, preparing to get into the sea for a bit of team bonding.\n\nThe sun is nowhere to be seen. There are grey skies above as a handful of children, wrapped up in jumpers and coats, tip-toe around in rock-pools. Some teenagers are huddled under a blanket in a bus shelter, looking out on beach that is largely deserted. There are more dogs than people in the sea. But that’s about to change.\n\n“Look at Nige — he’s right in!” says Carlisle, pointing at Nigel Atangana, the Exeter midfielder, who has hitched up his shorts and is jumping over a few waves. Jack Sparkes is not far behind and brave enough to take his shirt off. Wearing a baseball cap, training top and a pair of white slips, Pierce Sweeney follows.\n\nWilliams shakes his head. “Look at Sweens, he’s instantly regretting it,” the winger says.\n\n“Come on, Rands, you’re separating yourself from the herd,” Carlisle adds. “Don’t be that guy!”\n\nWilliams, who is tipped to go onto bigger and better things at the end of this season after impressing since joining from Watford, eventually accepts he has little choice. “In up to your knees!” Carlisle says, laughing.\n\nCarlisle says that he got home from Colchester at 1am — some of the staff travelled separately from the team because of social distancing — and, with the kit manager still on furlough, he had a fair bit of washing to do before he put some food in the microwave and watched a re-run of the game. “That’s the club we are,” he says, smiling. “And, actually, washing the kit builds a little bit of a common purpose.”\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, I walk back to the car park with Williams, who sounds a little subdued as we reflect on the first leg. He talks about the need for the team to be “better in the final third” and admits that the whole occasion at Colchester felt odd. “It was weird,” he says. “It’s the first play-off experience for myself, so not having a crowd there’s not great.”\n\nEverybody on the beach returns to the training ground for a meeting with the rest of the players, who had a session for around an hour on the grass. Matt Taylor calls them together in the marquee for a brief talk.\n\n“We’ve got such a big couple of days,” the manager says. “We will recover better than Colchester. We were getting stronger as that game went on. You are fitter than them. We will be in better shape and we will be in a better position on Monday night. I believe that. All the staff believe that. Do not get affected by anything externally. Get yourselves physically right for Monday night. It’s big.”\n\nTaylor breaks off for a chat afterwards, the two of us wearing masks as we sit outside and go back over everything that happened the day before. He needs no telling that the first leg wasn’t much of a spectacle.\n\n“The disappointment I’ve got is that it wasn’t a great reflection of those players on the pitch — they didn’t seem to be able to do themselves justice,” he says. “A lot of people were saying it was a poor standard game. It probably looked like that. But the last bit to come is the actual quality, and if they’re not in the rhythm, and they’ve not got it physically, that’s a really difficult thing to ask from them.”\n\nTaylor mentions the GPS data to illustrate his point. “It was probably 10-15 per cent down on a normal league encounter, in terms of distance covered, sprints, high-speed running. For that to be like that in a play-off game tells you everything, because usually in a play-off game it would probably be 5-10 per cent higher than normal. So that’s quite an important stat. And it would have been the same for both teams.”\n\nTaylor’s natural disposition is to be positive and upbeat. He has no time for excuses and doesn’t want to give the players any when it comes to the circumstances. At the same time, it is clear that he found his first experience of behind-closed-doors football extremely difficult.\n\n“It’s strange. I must admit — and I’ll probably digest it when it’s all over — you couldn’t enjoy it because there was no feeling to it. No one didn’t give 100 per cent. But it felt like a drab affair. And even if the scoreline had been different — and maybe on Monday night it will be — there will still be no feeling in the game because basically the fans are the ones who create that feeling.\n\n“They create the atmosphere, they can create the intensity, they can create the pressure on yourselves, the opposition or the referee. They live and breathe the game and they are all around you. It’s coming in from every angle as opposed to what it was last night, which was just silence. Even when Colchester scored what looks like a winner in the 80th minute, there was just a bit of noise and the game restarted again.”\n\nTaylor sighs. “I must admit, it makes you think about next season — people wouldn’t watch lower league football on TV with no fans. So I’m not sure how it could… not survive, but how the revenue could be generated. They’re talking about making it (the footage) available. No disrespect to anyone but when there’s no atmosphere, no one wants to watch those games. I worry that people will find other things to do, go and play golf or something.”\n\nI never thought I’d miss you\n\nHalf as much as I do\n\nAnd I never thought I’d feel this way\n\nThe way I feel…\n\nIt is seven minutes past five on Monday evening and the lyrics to that Madness song neatly capture the mood as it is played over the tannoy at St James Park shortly before the teams come out.\n\nJulian Tagg, Exeter’s chairman, is sitting about 40 yards away and, as I look around at the empty stands and at the cardboard cut-outs on the opposite side of the stadium, my mind goes back to a conversation that we had a few days earlier.\n\n“The opportunity to advertise during these play-off games, and to have hospitality, just goes through the roof. It’s like in excess of five or six games because the whole place is sold out,” Tagg said. “Everything is maxed out — every table, every inch of the place. And not to mention the atmosphere — the last one, Lincoln at home (in 2018), oh my God, the place went crazy.\n\n“Never mind the income, which of course is about survival, football brings something special when it comes to these moments. We scored in something like the 89th minute (against Lincoln) and the place went bananas. So that’s the bit that’s missing. And for the fans, they wait all year long for something to happen, we’ve managed to get there and, bugger me, we haven’t got the special bit that they really want.”\n\nAll you can hear for the first five minutes of the game is the sound of players’ voices mixed in with the odd seagull. Then comes a chant that nobody had been expecting. “Come on, City!” yell a handful of Exeter supporters, leaning out of a top floor window in one of the houses on St James Road, behind the goal and above the stadium scoreboard.\n\nFive minutes later those Exeter fans have something to celebrate. After Alex Fisher’s shot is saved and another effort blocked, Aaron Martin is in the right place to fire home a bouncing ball from about 14 yards. It is the perfect start for Exeter, who look the better team for much of the first half and twice come close to scoring again through Randall Williams. The winger’s second attempt, on the stroke of half-time, leads to an extraordinary public row.\n\nDean Gerken, Colchester’s goalkeeper, is absolutely furious with Steve Ball, the club’s assistant coach, for allowing so many players to go forward for a set piece so close to the interval. After diving to his right to try and get to Williams’ shot, Gerken climbs to his feet, marches out of his goal and yells a mouthful of abuse at Ball, who is stood the best part of 50 yards away. It would be quite a scene at any time, but in an empty stadium, where you can hear a pin drop, Gerken’s effing and blinding sounds and looks so much worse. The disagreement is still going on as he leaves the pitch at half-time.\n\nThat episode wasn’t shown by the television cameras, but it was still being talked about at Exeter days later, partly because of what happened next. With the second half less than 15 minutes old, Jayden Richardson, who is on loan from Nottingham Forest, hit a weak left-footed shot that Gerken, diving over the ball, somehow allowed to squirm under his body.\n\nThe Colchester players look broken but, to their credit, level things up on aggregate when Courtney Senior converts with a little over 10 minutes remaining. The game has now become stretched and Colchester have a wonderful chance to win the tie in the 89th minute when Kwame Poku, their teenage striker, races through one-on-one. “Go on, Pokes! Go on, Pokes!” urges a voice from the Colchester dugout.\n\nTime seems to stand still for a moment and you wonder whether Jonny Maxted has left it too late to come off his line. It turns out that the Exeter goalkeeper’s decision-making is spot on. Maxted waits for Poku to take a final touch before shooting and, after stepping out and spreading himself, blocks the striker’s effort with his left leg.\n\nAlthough Exeter were hanging on a bit in the final 10 minutes, it is a different story in extra-time. That speech that Taylor gave in the marquee about Exeter being fitter rings true as the home team take control of the game. They get their reward in the 111th minute when Archie Collins drives forward and sets Ryan Bowman free. Running into the inside left channel, the striker expertly steers a low shot into the far corner to put Exeter into the play-off final. Except it doesn’t quite feel that way with next to nobody in the ground.\n\nAfter the final whistle, Taylor walks the players over to the far side of the stadium, where they take their seats alongside the cardboard cut-outs. With Wembley in mind, the Exeter manager delivers a “one more to go” message to everybody. But this isn’t a moment to talk purely about what happens next. It is also about what just happened. And, in many ways, what didn’t happen.\n\nLooking at players who have given him everything, some of them playing 210 minutes of football across five days, after not taking part in a match for more than three months, Taylor feels a mixture of pride and disappointment. A play-off semi-final victory at home should end with a pitch invasion and that, he tells them, is exactly what would have happened at St James Park in normal circumstances.\n\n“The fans would have carried them off,” he says. “Literally carried them off. So I just feel it was a shame because for that performance to have been in front of our fans would have been brilliant.”\n\nLater, when his press duties are done — all via Zoom and on a laptop that is passed to him as he walks up the steps in the stand and along the deserted corridors — Taylor steps back onto the pitch and phones Sarah, his girlfriend, and his parents. “I’m not an emotional person,” he says. “But that was a big moment.’”\n\nIt is the morning after the night before and Aaron Martin has received a letter from the club confirming that his contract, which expires at the end of the month, will not be renewed. Although Martin was fully expecting the news after being told last month that the club had frozen the budget for next season, it still feels strange because of the timing.\n\nExeter were obliged to inform all out-of-contract players in writing on June 23 whether they would be offered new terms or not, and that just so happened to be the day after the play-off semi-final second leg. In Martin’s case, it is also the day after he scored and won the man-of-the-match award.\n\nMatt Taylor was on the phone to Martin first thing, and also spoke to each of the other seven Exeter players who are in the same position, just to gently remind them “you know what day it is, you know this has been coming, it’s an official letter from the club”.\n\nMartin appreciated the call and, at the age of 30, he has been around long enough to understand the impact that coronavirus will have on football and to recognise that these are exceptional times for everybody. In fact, he can’t help but laugh at the absurdity of his own situation.\n\n“It’s just the weirdest scenario,” Martin says, smiling. “I’ve played in both legs, I’ve played nearly every game this season, get man of the match, score a goal and you get released the next day. It’s like… ‘Thanks for all your work’, and then you’ve got to go and play in a play-off final. ‘You couldn’t just get us promoted, could you?’”\n\nMartin chuckles as he makes those comments. “I do feel for the club and for Matty as well, because it’s difficult for him, because everything is so uncertain at the moment. But it isn’t a nice feeling to do everything that you’ve done, and have the season that you’ve had, and then get released. But I’ve been in football a long time and you just have to get on with it.”\n\nMartin could have been forgiven for deciding to stay at home rather than report back for the play-offs and run the risk of picking up an injury that would hamper his chances of getting a contract elsewhere, especially given everything that he has going on at home.\n\n“It’s been tough mentally,” he says. “I’ve just had a baby boy, I’ve got a stepdaughter, we’ve got other stuff that we do — businesses and everything else — so to go this long without knowing your future and not having another deal secured, it has been mentally tough. But, for me, I felt like I’ve had a really good season, so I didn’t want it just to end like that. And it’s a personal goal for me as well because I’ve been promoted out of League One and the Championship, so I want the League Two one as well.”\n\n“It’ll be a one-v-one tight, (another) one-v-one tight, a little set and I’ll play it through the gate, and how quickly can you get to the ball. Your last one, Tom Parkes. I want to see your hips.”\n\nIt is 10am on Wednesday, 48 hours after Exeter beat Colchester, and Matt Taylor is out on the training ground working with a handful of players, focusing on one-on-one-defending and trying to build sharpness. Parkes, who came on as a substitute in both legs, has been playing catch up after testing positive for coronavirus at the start of the month, forcing him to miss 11 days of training.\n\nWearing a mask and gloves in glorious sunshine, Taylor keeps encouraging the central defender. “Brilliant, you, brilliant, brilliant,” he shouts as Parkes quickly adjusts his feet while the attacker shifts the ball from side to side. After about six or seven seconds, the ball is laid back to a second attacker and now Parkes has to close him down and get sideways on again. “Make up the ground,” urges Taylor, clapping his hands.\n\nAfter the ball is eventually passed back to Taylor, he slides it down the side of Parkes. “Go on then,” Taylor says as Parkes is forced to turn and retrieve the ball. “Brilliant,” the manager says. “And relax, Tom Parkes.”\n\nOnce training is over, we are back at Exmouth beach, only this time with the whole squad.\n\n“Are you a football team?” asks an elderly man as Taylor walks behind the players along Marine Drive, close to the seafront.\n\n“Yeah, Exeter City,” Taylor replies.\n\n“Oh, well done. When is the Wembley final?”\n\n“On Monday, 7.30.”\n\n“Oh, fantastic. Good luck anyway!”\n\n“Thanks very much,” says Taylor.\n\nWith not a cloud in the sky, the plan is for everybody to get in the sea for 20 minutes or so and then return to the training ground to have a traditional British seaside lunch.\n\n“We’ve had a four-week block where it’s been constant. Absolutely constant,” Taylor explains. “You saw the day when a small group came down the beach. It’s just a mental release, and hopefully the fish and chips will be OK when we get back. It’s just to take the mind away from putting their boots on on the training pitch. And it’s also a bit of recovery for them as well.”\n\nAlthough the sight of the players walking onto the beach turns a few heads, nobody bothers them.\n\n“Fish, what factor have you got on?” Taylor asks Alex Fisher.\n\n“Fifty,” replies the Exeter striker, smiling.\n\nThere is some laughter as Jack Sparkes briefly contemplates going into the water wearing his boxer shorts. “You can’t let him walk in like that!” Dan Green, the first-team coach, says, laughing.\n\nAs some of the players throw tennis balls around in the sea, others are happy to chat among themselves. “Hopefully they’re talking about things other than football,” says Taylor, who later joins them. “The pressure will continue to mount as we get towards Monday, and the players will feel that. And less will be more in terms of what we put into them this week. They know what’s coming, they know about the opposition — they know what Keith Curle teams are like. People disrespect Northampton. But they’ve got some outstanding players.”\n\nBack at the training ground an hour or so later, the players pull up a chair on the grass outside of the main building, below, and tuck into some fish and chips, all sitting at least two metres apart in a big circle. Even though social distancing has become the norm, it still feels like a peculiar scene.\n\nAs it is also testing day, half a dozen of the squad are sitting in the shade on a wooden bench, waiting to be called into a Portakabin for a swab to be put down the back of their throat and up their nose for 10 seconds.\n\nIt is an experience that Jonny Maxted no longer needs to go through after testing positive at the outset. “I had no symptoms,” he says. “I came in for the test on the first day back in training and I felt fine. Then I get a call that night saying you’ve got coronavirus and you’ve got to self-isolate. It came as a big shock. I didn’t really know what to do, especially as I was missing such an important first week back in training — your head is all over the place.”\n\nAs a goalkeeper, that exacerbated what had already been a difficult time for Maxted, below. “We’re used to catching balls, and ours is a different fitness — hitting the ground and getting back up,” he explains. “In lockdown I had no-one to do any serves. So I was coming from 12 weeks of lockdown to coming in training and I’d not even caught a ball, so you can imagine then getting told you’ve got coronavirus — that’s another (11 days) where I can’t get my eye in and just get back into the swing of things.”\n\nThere was nothing wrong with his judgment on Monday night, though, when he made that crucial save. “One-on-ones are always difficult. You put the striker as favourite,” Maxted says. “As soon as the ball was being played over, it was one of those where I was thinking: ‘Do I stay or do I go?’ He took that heavy touch and that was the trigger point for me just to get down his throat and say, ‘I’m here’. So I made myself as big as possible and tried to just get something on it. Things like that, you’re thinking, ‘I could be a hero here’. Luckily it hit me and I made the save.”\n\n“Supporter ownership is one thing, but if you look across the spectrum of clubs during this lockdown period, where all supporters of every club have been doing as much as they can to help, (you should) tap into that,” Nick Hawker, the Exeter City Supporters Trust chairman, says. “People love their clubs, the communities love them. Start listening to them and start giving them something. Whether they’ve got a share certificate saying they own the club or not doesn’t matter, they still feel that ownership.”\n\nExeter have been a fan-owned club since 2003. The Supporters Trust has more than 3,000 members and every one of them has a say in the way that their club is run. As well as that, four Trust members are elected to sit on the Exeter board.\n\n“Some people will be appointed to the club board who have professional skills that we can’t do without — it could be a lawyer, or an accountant, or marketing individual. But for every board member who is appointed directly by the club, the Trust also appoints a director — it has to be equal,” explains Hawker, who has supported Exeter since 1969.\n\nFor Hawker, as with many others at Exeter, working for the club is a labour of love. He talks about the way that supporters paint the gates at the stadium and tidy the ground after a game, but he’s especially proud that Exeter “can actually stand up and say this ownership model works”.\n\nSome would argue that it has its limitations too. “I wouldn’t disagree,” Hawker replies. “I think it is very hard for me to imagine how you progress from League One. Now whether that’s down to a lack of my personal experience, I don’t know. But the sums of money that you need to be successful in League One, let alone be promoted out of League One, are incredible. There are still things you can do. So I don’t think that means that the Trust model wouldn’t work, but I think it would need to have a look at itself and think how can we reinvent the model to make it more attractive to investors and still allow for that supporter involvement.”\n\nWhat is clear is that there is a real sense of community spirit at Exeter. As of June 22, when Exeter played the second leg of the play-off semi-final, the club had received £47,498 in season ticket refunds from their supporters and another £4,500 in advance ticket purchases — enough to cover a player’s salary at League Two level for a year.\n\nThe big question is when those fans will be allowed inside stadiums again. Hawker, who says that Exeter have been budgeting for so many different scenarios when it comes to crowds returning, makes a good point when I say that football isn’t the same without supporters. “I think as much as anything else we need the broadcasters to see that, as well as the football clubs — that’s the key,” he adds.\n\n“I watched our semi-final with a Chinese takeaway on my lap in the lounge, and as great as it was to see the team play well and win, the emptiness… the sound of the ball being kicked felt really odd. I think football, certainly the higher up the leagues you go, has lost that sense of how important supporters are.”\n\nSt James Park, Saturday evening.\n\nThe Exeter squad gather in the concourse in the Adam Stansfield Stand, where photographs of some of the club’s most celebrated players hang from the ceiling. The area has been turned into the combination of a makeshift gym and a changing room, with rucksacks, drink bottles and fitness mats strewn across the floor. Now it’s a meeting room.\n\nMatt Taylor stands at the front. “It’s certainly not a time for big speeches,” he says. “The main point I want to make and discuss with you guys now is emotional control. Being in control of yourself. Being in control of your team.”\n\n“What was a huge moment on Monday?”\n\nThe players sit quietly.\n\n“What was the first moment I sensed when they lost their control and focus?”\n\nSeveral mention the incident with the Colchester goalkeeper just before half-time.\n\nTaylor nods. “Did that influence that goalkeeper’s performance in the second half? Had he lost his focus? Had the team lost some sort of control in what they wanted to do?\n\n“The pressure is going to be there (at Wembley). You can’t ignore the pressure, chaps. But you’ve got to use it in your favour.”\n\nTaylor looks around the room. “Who’s been on a rollercoaster? Anyone been on the big one at Blackpool? I’ve been on it once and I’m an absolute coward when it comes to heights. I held on with my eyes closed. I got off and I missed all the beautiful views. I didn’t enjoy the ride in any way. I hadn’t taken part in it. I might as well not have been there.\n\n“All I want you to do (on Monday) is keep your eyes open, breathe and stay in control, no matter what is in front of you — it could be the referee, it could be a mistake in the first minute. Charlton (League One play-off final) last year — what happened?\n\n“Own goal. Played back to the keeper and he missed the ball,” says one of the players.\n\n“Yeah, Dillon Phillips. First minute of the game. Simple backpass, it rolled under his foot and went in. They won 2-1 and he played really well after that. He immediately got his focus back on the game.\n\n“No matter what the circumstances, no matter what is going on, we stay in control. Take a deep breath, think of something that makes you happy, something that makes you smile. There are a lot worse things in life, chaps. We stay in control and that is absolutely key. That’s the main point I took out of the two legs.”\n\nTaylor turns to his staff and asks if they have anything to add. Wayne Carlisle, the assistant manager, talks about the importance of playing with control but also energy and tempo. “And that starts tonight,” he says.\n\n“We had real clarity going into that second leg, only because we were 1-0 down,” Taylor adds. “We knew exactly what we needed to do. It’s no different on Monday. Capable? Yes. Fit? Yes. Confident? Yes.\n\n“Like Wayne said, ‘We are a better team with speed in our game, and I want to see a little bit of speed tonight. That’s why we’re training here on this surface, so that we accelerate into Monday. OK. Smiles on your faces, deep breaths. Enjoy it, chaps. See you out there at seven.”\n\nThe players train for about an hour and a half, starting with a rondo and finishing with a penalty shootout, below. In between, they play a 10-minute 11-a-side game on a smaller than normal pitch and then split into groups to run through some unopposed shadow play.\n\nMindful that Northampton are the most dangerous team in League Two from dead balls, Taylor also practises defending set pieces, in particular dealing with long throw-ins. Alex Hartridge, one of Exeter’s young professionals, launches the ball into the area, Rory Delap-style. Taylor urges his players not to retreat too deep as they clear a succession of balls.\n\nAt the end, he calls the players together before practising the dreaded penalty shootout scenario. “I know the goalkeepers might think they know your set up,” he says. “But take the penalties that you’re going to take and commit to your process.”\n\nTwo groups of 11 stand in the centre circle and make the long walk to place the ball on the spot. Carlisle and Dan Green, the first-team coach, act as referees at either end of the pitch. It is gone 8pm now and St James Park is silent apart from the sound of a whistle before each kick.\n\nEverything that could go wrong did go wrong. “Second best. Physically dominated throughout and I have absolutely no complaints. All credit to Northampton in terms of the way they went about it, but I really did not like the effect it had on the personality of my team tonight,” Taylor tells the media afterwards. “We needed to be a team of men tonight. Unfortunately, we started off as men, but quickly turned into boys.”\n\nNorthampton bullied Exeter from the first minute to the last. It was no exaggeration to say that they looked like scoring every time the ball was pumped into the Exeter penalty area. And it was pumped into the Exeter penalty area an awful lot. It could have been four-nil by half-time. It was by full-time. Moxey’s red card, just before the hour mark, summed up Exeter’s evening.\n\nTaylor looks shocked. “The team lacked any physical presence, you could see that. But the personality which it turned us into, I really didn’t like that. A few of those players have got a few hidden demons from Wembley a couple of years ago and they were apparent from the off as soon as we were on the back foot. You’ve got to show a bit more personality.”\n\nIf anything, the absence of supporters made the experience seem even worse for Exeter. There was nothing to drown out the noise of the Northampton players’ celebrations and songs as Taylor and his players, scattered across the Wembley turf, in a way that makes it look like they’ve been asked to social distance one more time, watch their opponents dance around before lifting the trophy. Taylor, who is magnanimous in defeat, stands and applauds the Northampton team.\n\n“We backed ourselves over the course of the play-offs but, unfortunately, we let ourselves down in the final,” he says, reflecting on the defeat 24 hours later. “Full credit to Northampton, they played their style and we just couldn’t handle it. Every time the ball was in the box, we outnumbered their players, but we never once got to the ball first, so it’s almost irrelevant who’s on the pitch. It’s actually the capability of the players on there. And, unfortunately, we were short. I’ve not had to say that too much this season because it’s been relatively successful. But that’s the moment that everyone will remember, I’m afraid.”\n\nThere is no time for self-pity. By the end of the week, Taylor plans to have spoken to every player individually and his coaching staff. Then there will be a short break before it starts all over again. “It comes around pretty quickly,” the Exeter manager says, smiling, and already sounding like a man who has turned his thoughts to trying all over again next season."
