Now is a moment for him to come back and be one of the players in our attack line.\"Silva suggested that Stansfield would be a good option either as a No 9, or as a wide player for Fulham.\"He can play in both positions,\" he said. \"Of course, he would be a slightly different wide player to the ones we normally use. \"But his main position is through the middle. He's stronger with two strikers than just alone, but this season he played many games alone as a No 9. He did it well.\"",

Now is a moment for him to come back and be one of the players in our attack line.\"\n\nSilva suggested that Stansfield would be a good option either as a No 9, or as a wide player for Fulham.\n\n\"He can play in both positions,\" he said. \"Of course, he would be a slightly different wide player to the ones we normally use.\n\n\"But his main position is through the middle. He's stronger with two strikers than just alone, but this season he played many games alone as a No 9. He did it well.\"\n\nFulham head coach Marco Silva has insisted that his side \"will do their maximum\" to defeat Manchester City on Saturday and dismissed any idea that his side would lack motivation for the game.\n\nFulham have already secured their top flight status this season and are not fighting for anything more than league position in their remaining two games. Manchester City, meanwhile, are still fighting for the title.\n\nTheir title rivals, Arsenal, require Manchester City to drop points in at least one of their remaining three games if they are to claim the Premier League crown.\n\n“We are going to do our job like we have done this season, that's it,\" said Silva. \"We will prepare ourselves for the match and we are going to do our maximum to get points for us and not do favours for others.\"\n\nFulham have a poor record against Manchester City. The west London club have lost their last 15 league meetings with the champions, and defeat on Saturday would mark a new English Football League record for the most consecutive defeats against one side.\n\nHowever, while they suffered a 5-1 defeat at the Etihad earlier this season, they did reduce City to just seven shots, City's joint third lowest return this season. Fulham's defensive record has also improved, and only Arsenal or City have conceded fewer goals in 2024 than Fulham.\n\nA video published on Instagram this week showed Fulham players flying a kite at the club's training ground, leading to some on social media to question their motivation.\n\nBut Silva dismissed any questions about the kites, insisting it was a noise created on social media, and said his team will be ready for City.\n\n\"I have been motivating our players every single week,\" he said. \"We achieved 39 points around the international break, the questions I faced then were about motivation and the English expression about if the players would be 'on the beach'. It's not the case, and it's not something I need to spend time talking about with my players.\n\n\"They know the demands every day. If they are relaxed, I'm the first one to put pressure on them. That's the way we've worked for three years. That won't be different now because of where we are in the table.\"\n\nFulham will be without Sasa Lukic for Saturday's early kick off, as he will miss out as a precaution following a small calf issue.\n\nDavid Moyes says it was \"the right decision\" to leave West Ham United, and he believes the club is in a better place compared to when he rejoined.\n\nIt was announced earlier this month that Moyes would leave at the end of the season having started a second stint as manager in December 2019.\n\n\"To finish in the top ten would be excellent for us. I'm not the type of person (to get emotional) but I'm looking forward to the game. There's a lot of things in football which can be done better, but I'm really comfortable with the situation and the board. It's football.\n\n\"It's the right decision for both parties. We'll go our separate ways having had a good four and a half years. I'd like to stay in management but first it would be good to have a break. I'd like to be remembered for someone who did the job well. We became a European team and now West Ham are expected to remain a European team. There's a lot of stability at the club now.\"\n\nThe 61-year-old led West Ham to victory in the Europa Conference League last season, the club's first trophy in more than 40 years. He was also in charge at the east London club from 2017-2018.\n\nHis last home game as manager is against Luton Town on Saturday with the final game of the season being away at Manchester City on May 19.\n\nWest Ham are ninth in the Premier League table.\n\nAnge Postecoglou says he has “loved and enjoyed every single second” of his first season as Tottenham Hotspur’s head coach.\n\nSpurs appointed Postecoglou last June after he won a domestic treble with Scottish side Celtic. Spurs started the season in great form as they won eight of their first 10 games under the Australian and, even though they have lost four matches in a row, they still have an outside chance of finishing fourth and qualifying for the Champions League.\n\nSpeaking to the media ahead of their game against Burnley on Saturday, Postecoglou was initially asked if he had learned anything about himself this season.\n\n“Nothing too spectacular,” he said “I am who I am. I have resisted the notion to try and change the kind of person I am. It’s not easy in the Premier League with all the attention and scrutiny and everything you say and do is kind of measured and it’s very easy to sort of get distracted by that. But nothing I learned about myself earlier this year that I didn’t already know. It’s that I’m not a perfect human being and I keep moving on.”\n\nPostecoglou was then asked if he had experienced any difficult moments during his first year in charge.\n\n“No, I’m sorry to disappoint (you). If you want me to crumble I can pretend but I’m fine. I’m all good. I have loved and enjoyed every single second of it. It’s all been brilliant. I’m in a really good space.”\n\nFollowing the clash against Burnley this weekend, Spurs face Manchester City next Tuesday evening.\n\nTop scorer Joao Pedro is doubtful for Brighton's final away game of the season at Newcastle United on Saturday after sustaining an ankle injury in training on Friday.\n\nHead coach Roberto De Zerbi said: \"Joao Pedro has an ankle problem. It's sad news for us. Today it happened and I don't know if he can play tomorrow.\"\n\nJoao Pedro headed his 20th goal of the season from the rebound in last Sunday's 1-0 home win against Aston Villa after the Brazilian's penalty was initially saved by Robin Olsen.\n\nDefender Tariq Lamptey could return to the squad at Newcastle as a substitute for the first time in a month.\n\nDe Zerbi said: \"He can't start, tomorrow we will see if he can come on the bench or not.\"\n\nAdam Lallana is also back in squad contention after missing the Villa victory with a knock.\n\nA draw or defeat will give Brighton a maximum of 18 away points, their lowest away tally since the club's first two seasons in the Premier League between 2017 and 2019.\n\nLeeds United will be without Patrick Bamford for both of their Championship play-off semi final ties against Norwich City.\n\nBamford, 30, picked up a knee injury in Leeds' 4-3 win over Middlesbrough last month and subsequently missed the 4-0 defeat by Queens Park Rangers and 2-1 loss at fellow play-off contenders Southampton.\n\nUnited head coach Daniel Farke has now confirmed that the striker will be out for up to two weeks with the issue.\n\nHe said: “He’ll miss both legs. He’s seen a different knee consultant and there’s a new diagnosis of trauma in the patella tendon. We weren’t aware of this. The initial diagnosis was a bruise. He needs a couple of weeks to recover.”\n\nBamford's absence will come as a blow to Leeds. He has scored nine goals in 36 appearances this season.\n\nDaniel James, meanwhile, is close to a return, having \"joined in with parts of team training\".\n\nFarke, meanwhile, is confident his team can deliver in the play-offs, having shown they can handle the pressure of big games.\n\nHe added: “In spotlight games (big games) this team is spot on. The players have my backing and you don’t expect we’ll do something strange or something we haven’t done before. We want to be ourselves.”\n\nCarlo Ancelotti has confirmed that Thibaut Courtois will play in Real Madrid's clash against Granada on Saturday.\n\nThe goalkeeper played his first game of the season last Saturday, starting in the 3-0 home win against Cadiz that helped Madrid clinch a record-extending 36th La Liga title.\n\nThe Belgian had been out for 335 days with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury he suffered just before the season even started and then a meniscus tear in his other knee he picked up during the final stages of his recovery.\n\nIn Courtois' absence, Andriy Lunin has featured in goal for Madrid in the Champions League and Ancelotti remained coy on who will start in the final against Borussia Dortmund.\n\nHe said: \"Courtois is going to play (against Granada), he needs minutes. I have to keep Kepa in mind as well, he deserves to play a game. Lunin has to be ready to play. I have to evaluate him.\n\n\"I respect what Iker Casillas says (that Lunin has to play) and I'm very fond of him. I don't want to get into this debate because I have almost a month to think about it.\"\n\nJurgen Klopp believes Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott has “everything you need” to be a big asset to England at this summer’s European Championship in Germany.\n\nThe 21-year-old attacking midfielder has yet to be capped at senior international level but has strengthened his claims to be part of Gareth Southgate’s squad with some fine performances for his club.\n\nElliott capped a man of the match display with a stunning goal in Liverpool’s 4-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur last weekend.\n\n“If whatever I said would help Harvey, I would say it,” Klopp said.\n\n“But it starts a discussion in public and then people say ‘what does he want to do at the Euros?’\n\n“Harvey did nothing wrong but some people will find a reason and say ‘why should Harvey Elliott be there?’ Maybe the boy reads it and feels bad.\n\n“Harvey is in a great moment. If someone wants to pick him, he has everything you need. He could pack a suitcase in an instant, not a problem.”\n\nManchester United assistant coach Steve McClaren has spoken of the need to restore standards at the club, adding that INEOS want \"to succeed\".\n\nThe Old Trafford club have been inconsistent throughout this season despite reaching their second successive FA Cup final.\n\nUnited have slipped to eighth in the Premier League and following a 4-0 defeat by Crystal Palace, pressure has increased on manager Erik ten Hag.\n\nMcClaren, a former United assistant manager under Sir Alex Ferguson, was brought in under Ten Hag and despite this season's struggles, he is hoping the new minority investment under Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS will move the club in the right direction.\n\nHe said to BBC Sport: \"Arsenal are back after being down and Manchester United will do the same.\n\n\"We have had many storms. I see tremendous plusses from INEOS coming in and what they are trying to do. It is identifying the standards and getting back to them.\n\n\"At certain times since I have come back over the last two years, we have had those standards. We have also had standards that have not been Manchester United.\n\n\"Speaking to Sir Jim Ratcliffe, speaking to Sir Dave Brailsford, they are getting the best people in. They want this to succeed. They have done that in their other sports and businesses. I am positive they will do it again with Manchester United.\"\n\nNewcastle United head coach Eddie Howe has delivered a positive fitness update ahead of Saturday's match at home to Brighton with Kieran Trippier in contention to return to action after two months out.\n\nTrippier has made 36 appearances for Newcastle across all competitions this season but has not played since the win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on March 2 after sustaining a calf injury.\n\n\"He's getting closer; he's trained this week for the first time with the group,\" Howe said of Trippier's return. \"It's been brilliant. Some key figures back. He trained well, it's been a big week for him, I'll make a decision today as to whether he is involved tomorrow.\"\n\nFabian Schar missed last week's win over Burnley with a hamstring injury, and Howe said of his availability: \"I don't think he'll figure but let's see about next week. He's certainly improving.\"\n\nMiguel Almiron and Joelinton both came on as substitutes against Burnley, with Howe saying of their returns: \"They've trained well, it's been a good week for them, getting some good work into their bodies. They're still building their robustness because they need the load behind them. They're key players.\"\n\nAfter Saturday's home game against Brighton, Newcastle will conclude their Premier League campaign with visits to Manchester United and Brentford respectively."
