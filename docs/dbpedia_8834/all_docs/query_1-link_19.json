        "text": "Among English football's adventures of father and son, it is the most beautiful tale of them all.\n\nNothing could be a more compelling tribute to tragic Exeter City striker Adam Stansfield, who died from bowel cancer 12 years ago, than his son Jay accepting the torch and bringing his dad's No.9 shirt out of retirement at St James Park.\n\nSo far, Jay's loan move from Fulham has yielded four goals and his three assists, including a pair of sumptuous passes in the rollicking Devon derby defeat at Plymouth.\n\nEverything about the way Exeter have honoured Stansfield's memory has been tasteful and judicious. But the boy who came home to provide his own eulogy on the pitch is a story for all of football to celebrate from here to paternity.\n\nWhen news broke of Stansfield's loan deal on deadline day, bringing him back to the club where he was in the academy at under-eight level when his father passed away, the excitement went viral. “I'm not going to lie – I did hesitate,” admitted Jay, who turns 20 later this month. “Going out on loan was more about my development than what this club's about.\n\n“Obviously the name has been here before, the fans were still singing about him every game and it would have been easy to let my heart rule my head. But when I came on for my debut (against MK Dons), it was a special moment for everyone connected with the club – especially the supporters and my family – and my heart was beating 20 to the dozen. I'll never forget it.\n\n“For people who used to watch my dad every week, to see the No.9 shirt back on the pitch was a big thing. And it goes without saying it was special for me to wear his old shirt, look up and see a stand named after him.\n\n“At first it was quite a weird feeling, but deep down I just wanted to keep sharing my love for the club after everything they have done to honour his name – and what they have done for me personally. That was a key motivation in deciding to come back here, knowing he's still revered around the club, so I resolved to make the move and show what I'm about as well.\n\n“Wearing the No.9 shirt, and bringing it out of retirement, was also a consideration and it was in the back of my mind when I got the call. But I wanted to come down here and be myself and not live in his shadow. Wherever I go, and whatever the shirt number, I'm always going to have 'Stansfield' on my back so there was always going to be pressure following in his footsteps.\n\n“To take the No.9 was a privilege, not a burden. And I can't describe the feeling when I scored my first goals, away at Barnsley. I had been trying to adapt to the physical demands of League One football, and things hadn't been going my way for the first two or three games, so those gave me a lot of confidence.\n\n“The pain of losing your father at eight years old never leaves you. Living in his footsteps I miss being around him, his advice if I've done something wrong in training, someone to mentor me. That's one aspect I do miss a lot, yeah.”\n\nFrom Monday, the EFL celebrate their Youth Development Week, a showcase for home-grown talent where too many clubs higher up the food chain shop abroad. Last season, 209 players were handed their debuts by clubs where they came through the academy and 81 per cent of players on teamsheets were home-grown.\n\nExeter City do it better than most. Ollie Watkins and Ethan Ampadu began their careers down the M5, and there are plenty more where they came from. Stansfield's return to Exeter – he was snapped up by Fulham at 16 – is a timely reminder that talent begins at home. For added authenticity, he has even adopted some of his old man's traits, like ham and cheese omelette as a pre-match meal.\n\n“That's something my mum used to cook for him before home games,” said Stansfield. “I've carried on the tradition, if you like, and it's worked well for me so far.”\n\nAs the rain intensified, club captain Matt Jay popped into the analysis room at the Grecians' Cliff Hill training ground to deliver his own verdict on the prodigal son's return.\n\n“It's a true love story,” said Jay. “The players here always talked about Jay coming back one day. He has been one of our shining lights and to see him come through the door on deadline day lifted everyone's spirits. Hopefully he will showcase what he can do at this level and go back to Fulham ready to take the next steps on his journey in their first team.”\n\nIn a corridor at the training ground, there is a tasteful – there it is again, that word tasteful – shrine to Adam Stansfield. Three shirts - Yeovil, Hereford and Exeter, the clubs he represented – hang on the wall as a reminder that respect is often most beautiful when it's simple.\n\nJay said: “I've got my own collection of his shirts at home – in what they call a games room now, don't they? - along with a couple of his England (semi-professional) caps as a reminder of what he did.\n\n“It's not just the family who continue to honour his memory. There are people from the general public who are stepping up and trying to raise as much for the (charitable) foundation as possible. Two brothers, Tom and Jack Vickery, have been a credit to themselves and have done us proud – often with simple things, like auctioning signed shirts and boots, and others have gone the extra mile, too.\n\n“The way the club handles itself and deals with things is first-class. I was in the academy at under-eight level when my dad died, and for them to take me under their wing the way they did was a big factor in me being where I am now. Yes, I hesitated when the call came. But coming back just felt right.”"
