The tally currently stands at 982 league goals, including play-offs.\n\nToday we go back just over a decade to goal number 366 under The Trust, in yet another play-off final; though this one will live longer in the memory of Grecians fans than the one we shared with you yesterday.\n\nIt's 22 minutes into City's second Wembley appearance in as many years. Academy graduate Dean Moxey is standing over the ball, ready to deliver an inswinging corner from the right.\n\nHis cross is barely touched by the head of now manager Matt Taylor, but it's enough to deflect it into the path of the onrushing Rob Edwards who, left unmarked by the Cambridge United defence, heads through the legs of Courtney Pitt to give the Grecians the lead.\n\nCambridge came at City in the second half but were denied by Taylor on the line, while Magno Viera's curling shot wizzed just past Paul Jones' upright; as City held on to record their first ever win at Wembley and just their fourth promotion in their history.\n\nPictured above is Rob Edwards celebrating his Wembley winner with the late Adam Stansfield to his left.
