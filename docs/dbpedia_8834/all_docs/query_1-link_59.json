        "text": "Exeter City fans always bring a touch of colour for the big matches and tonight will be no exception when they host Lincoln City in the League Two play-off semi-final second leg.\n\nThe match is evenly poised after Saturday’s goalless first leg, so whoever wins tonight at St James’ Park can look forward to the play-off final at Wembley Stadium on Monday, May 28, where they will take on either Coventry City or Notts County.\n\nSt James’ Park is sold out for tonight’s game, although the redevelopment of two sides of St James’ Park means a reduced crowd as only two stands are in operation. But with the largest terrace in English football sure to be packed and in good voice, it promises to be quite an atmosphere nonetheless.\n\nAnd we can confirm that the popular Adam Stansfield surfer flag will be out this evening, but NOT to be held high above the heads of 4,000 supporters packed into the Big Bank behind one goal. Instead, it will be displayed in the new stand being built on the site of the Old Grandstand at the Park.\n\n“Justin Quick has organised it and kindly got the construction guys at GL Events to approve us being able to pop up there, so the ground staff are going to pop into the stand for five minutes,” operations manager Andy Gillard said.\n\n“It isn’t going to be anything permanent incase it blows away or something silly like that, so it will be there to coincide with the players coming onto the pitch and the cameras will hopefully be focused on it and show a good reminder of our friend Stanno.”\n\nThe flag came into being when Stansfield passed away in August 2010 and was part-funded by long-term club sponsors FlyBe.\n\nStansfield was just 31 when he died from bowel cancer whilst a player at Exeter and the fact his name is still sung shows just popular he was for the Grecians, who retired his number nine shirt for nine seasons following his tragic and untimely death.\n\n“At the time everyone pulled together in a difficult time, we all miss Stanno dreadfully still, but we do things continually so that we don’t ever forget him and it has been visible at most big occasions that we have been involved in since he passed away,” Gillard added.\n\nHowever, the ‘Stanno’ flag will not be the only one on display tonight with the Red Legion promising a show of their own on the Big Bank, which includes a new flag of their own.\n\n“The Red Legion are planning something as well for the Big Bank,” Gillard said. “They have a new crowd surfer, so that will add to a cracking atmosphere. It is set up nicely, all to play for and similar to last year.”\n\nBack then, Exeter played out a thrilling 3-2 draw with Carlisle United in the first leg before winning an equally thrilling second leg 3-2, courtesy of an injury-time winner from jack Stacey. Ollie Watkins had given Exeter a two-goal lead before the Cumbrians struck twice in the last ten minutes to level things up, only for Stacey to seal the most dramatic of wins with a 25-yard screamer."
