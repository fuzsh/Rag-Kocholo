        "text": "FPL is back baby!! The Game we all love and hate at various points of the season has launched and now is the time to start tinkering with our Drafts and harbor an ambition of winning the Entire Thing. Until Gameweek 1 Starts & most of us realize that dream will have to wait for yet another season. This series of Articles will help you to make a strong start in your bid to have a Fantastic Season and who knows – Maybe just accomplish the Holy Grail of winning FPL.\n\nWe will be starting by exploring the Best FPL Budget Forwards in the (4.5 – 5.5 Million price range). Don’t scoff at these guys. Remember this is the Category from which Harry Kane started his FPL Career (5.0 Million, 191 pts, 14/15 season) and we all know what he went on to do in the following years.\n\nConsidering the prices this season & if you guys want to build a draft with Haaland, Salah/Palmer/Saka, Isak/Watkins, a Premium Defender chances are you will need 1 Forward from this Category. There are currently 42 FPL Budget Forwards classified under this category and most of them will not even get to play a single minute this season. Identifying the correct ones is the real challenge. That’s why we are here to help. Read on to find out who are the viable options below.\n\nAll stats used in this Article have been taken from the Members Area of Fantasy Football Hub.\n\nLink to all our 2024/25 Pre-Season articles including all team pre-season friendly updates, team previews, fixture analysis, position-wise analysis, differentials, players to target, budget enablers and more. Completely free to access as well!\n\nBest 5.5 Million FPL Budget Forwards\n\nWe have 16 Players who are priced at 5.5 million and most of them are expected to get minutes for their teams. Choosing 1 as your 3rd Forward and alternating between them at various points of the season will enable you all to build a Premium Heavy Draft. Let’s look at the best options at this price point.\n\nThe Brighton Quartet (Pedro, Ferguson, Undav, and Welbeck) –\n\nJoao Pedro\n\nPros: On Penalties and hopefully prone to less rotation now that De Zerbi has gone. Pedro could be a major pricing mistake by FPL Towers this season (good for us) if he can keep on starting.\n\nCons: A bit injury prone, not going to be part of the traveling squad to Japan for some of Brighton’s pre-season friendlies and Brighton’s tough fixtures in the 1st 8 Gameweeks (5 of Last Season’s Top 8).\n\nPlayed – 31 Games (12 Subs) and 2045 Minutes\n\nGoals – 9 from an xG of 12.01\n\nAssists – 3 from an xA of 4.64\n\nFPL Points – 104\n\nEvan Ferguson is currently injured and not expected to be back until October. Very Injury-prone player but a Big Talent who will be playing as the Center Forward when fit. He got 6 Goals and 1 Assist from 15 starts last season.\n\nPre-Season Update:\n\nJoao Pedro – ⚽\n\nJoao Pedro made his return to Brighton’s 11 and played 45 mins in the last friendly and picked up a goal. (Further Read: Pre-Season Summary of All 20 Premier League Teams)\n\nDeniz Undav – Had a brilliant season for Stuttgart where he got 18 Goals and 9 Assists in 30 Games. Rumored to be going back to them on a permanent move this season. If not, keep an eye out for him, as he could start as the No. 9 for Brighton at the start of the season.\n\nDanny Welbeck – The Elder Statesman of the Team who got 5 Goals and 4 Assists from 21 Starts last season but is more of a Link-up man now compared to a Lethal Finisher. Wait and watch on Welbeck.\n\nOur Ranking for the Brighton FPL Budget Forwards: Pedro > Ferguson > Undav > Welbeck\n\nFurther Read: Best £4.5 Million FPL Defenders For The 2024/25 FPL Season\n\nAdam Armstrong (Southampton)\n\nPros:\n\nAnother Penalty Taking Forward who got 24 Goals and 13 Assists in 49 Games in the Championship last season. Has multiple routes to points with both Double Digits for both Goals and Assists. Brilliant home fixtures to begin with and only 3 Games against the Top 8 Teams of Last Season.\n\nCons: Has not proven himself in the Premier League yet, with only 4 Goals and 4 Assists across 2 seasons for Southampton previously. Can he make it 3rd Time Lucky?\n\nDid well in pre-season already to get the FPL juices flowing.\n\nPre-Season updates:\n\nArmstrong⚽⚽⚽\n\nPlayed the full pre-season with minutes played across the 5 games reading as- 45, 28, 45, 69, 80\n\nFurther Read: Best FPL Budget Enablers For The 2024-25 FPL Season\n\nThe Ipswich Lads Up Top (George Hirst/ Liam Delap) –\n\nGeorge Hirst was the Primary striker for Ipswich last season and got 7 Goals and 6 Assists in 26 Games.\n\nProbably the man who will be replacing him up top is Liam Delap who had a decent season at Hull and has signed on a permanent basis for Ipswich. He got 8 Goals and 2 Assists in 31 Games.\n\nKnowing the Gung Ho approach Ipswich play with and their brilliant fixture run from Gameweeks 3 to 8, take the plunge after knowing who between these 2 will be their Main striker.\n\nPre-Season updates:\n\nBoth Hirst and Delap did not have any goal contributions in pre-season.\n\nMinutes played in pre-season:\n\nHirst- 60, 45\n\nDelap- 30, 45, 62, 63\n\nFurther Read: Best FPL Budget Enablers For The 2024-25 FPL Season\n\nJamie Vardy (Leicester)\n\nCan the Vardy Party continue for yet another season?\n\nAt 37 Years of age, Vardy is coming close to retirement but he still managed 18 Goals and 2 Assists in 35 Games for Leicester last season in the Championship. He will probably be leading the line for Leicester even if they sign someone else because of his experience of playing in the Premier League (136 Goals and 64 Assists)\n\nWe are used to seeing Vardy in the Premium Range of Forwards, so can he do a job for us as a 3rd Forward this season?\n\nLeicester also start off with a Decent 8 Gameweeks where they face only 3 of Last Season’s Top 8 Teams.\n\nPre-season updates:\n\nVardy⚽\n\nVardy played 60 minutes in the first game of pre-season and was not involved after that. Daka(5.0) played the majority of pre-season with minutes played reading as 60, 45, 79, 79, 37\n\nThe Backup Forwards\n\n(Enes Unal, Odsonne Edouard, Raul Jimenez, Iliman Ndiaye, Michail Antonio and Jorgen Strand Larsen)\n\nAll of them can do a job when given the opportunities but we don’t see them starting over their more nailed Center Forwards counterparts at their respective clubs.\n\nAntonio and Jimenez were once great FPL assets but sadly their best days are behind them.\n\nEdouard, Unal, and Strand Larsen could be interesting picks if they get good Gametime, so keep an eye out for them.\n\nNdiaye could be the best pick from this lot as he can easily play on the Wing or as a Support Striker and had a brilliant season in the Championship in 2022-23.\n\nComplete Avoids for now (Armando Broja and David Datro Fofana) – Failed loan moves at Fulham and Burnley last season and we do not see them getting anywhere near Chelsea’s 1st Team this season. Another loan move or a permanent move away from the Premier League beckons for these two FPL options.\n\nFurther Read: Best £4.5 Million FPL Defenders For The 2024/25 FPL Season\n\nBEST 5.0 Million FPL Budget Forwards\n\nWe have 17 Players who are priced at 5 million and most in this category are Backup options to the Main strikers on their teams or are unlikely to even get significant minutes to stake a claim for your FPL Teams. One thing to keep in mind is to avoid selecting a Highly owned 5 Million Budget Forward (if they are not starting) to make sure you don’t lose any major value on them due to price changes.\n\nWe are classifying them below –\n\nCameron Archer (Aston Villa) – The Best Option in this Price Range but likely to be a backup to both Duran & Watkins for Villa. He played for perhaps the worst team to ever play in the Premier League – Sheffield United and will surely be hoping to make the most of his chances for Villa (especially if Villa decides to rotate during the UCL Group stage matches). We all know his talent but can he take it up a notch this season?\n\nPlayed – 30 Games (9 Subs) and 1839 Minutes\n\nGoals – 4 from an xG of 5.28\n\nAssists – 3 from an xA of 1.39\n\nFPL Points – 82\n\nPre- season update: Archer – ⚽⚽⚽. If Duran leaves the club, Archer could get some minutes as a back up for Watkins especially during the weeks with European fixtures.\n\nFurther Read: 2024/25 FPL Season – Teams & Players to Target | Fixture Analysis\n\nThe Everton Backup Boys (Beto, Maupay, and Chermiti) – They will pretty much be Impact subs for Everton unless they get a move to another team searching for a Striker.\n\nBeto got 3 Goals in 30 Appearances, while Maupay had a better season on loan at Brentford where he got 6 Goals and 3 Assists while Chermiti only managed a single start last season. An avoidable bunch in our opinion.\n\nThe Chelsea Young Guns (Deivid and Marc Guiu) – Deivid will be a footnote for now but keep an eye out for La Masia product Marc Guiu who could get some minutes this season. Loans look more likely for both with Chelsea’s overflowing attacking depth.\n\nThe Fulham Backups (Stansfield and Vinicius) – 4th and 3rd choice Forwards respectively for Fulham behind main man Muniz and Jimenez. Pick at your own peril.\n\nThe Wolves Outcasts (Fabio Silva and Kalajdzic) – Both are likely to leave the club this season with Cunha, and Strand Larsen the favored strikers for the club going forward.\n\nThe Promoted Team Backups (Al-Hamadi, Daka, Mara, and Onuachu) – 4 Goals in 14 Games for Ali Al-Hamadi, 7 Goals and 6 Assists in 20 Games for Daka, 3 Goals and 2 Assists in 29 Games for Mara and a loan move for Paul Onuachu suggest that they will mostly be ignored by their clubs (except maybe Daka) for the upcoming League season.\n\nThe Others (Dennis, Ings, and Veliz) – 1 Goal and 2 Assists for Ings who is a Good player without injury and when given regular Game time (something he has not gotten at West Ham since his move), a loan move to Watford last season for Dennis and only 44 minutes of action for young Alejo Veliz at Spurs proves these guys will not be in our thinking when making our FPL squads at the start of the season.\n\nFurther Read: Best FPL Budget Enablers For The 2024-25 FPL Season\n\nBEST 4.5 Million FPL Budget Forwards\n\nWe have 9 Players who are priced at 4.5 million and most will be used as a Dead 3rd Bench Spot for your teams unless they spark into goalscoring form during pre-season. One thing to keep in mind is to avoid selecting a Highly owned 4.5 Budget Forward (if they are not starting) to make sure you don’t lose any major value on them due to price changes.\n\nThe best 2 Options according to our preference are listed below –\n\nTom Cannon (Leicester) – Was involved in 13 Games for Championship winners Leicester last season and got 2 Goals and 1 Assist. The 21-year-old could become the future of Leicester in a couple of seasons with Vardy nearing retirement, Daka used sparingly and Iheanacho leaving the club. Watch out for him in Pre-season especially if Leicester does not buy a Forward.\n\nRoss Stewart (Southampton) – With Che Adams almost certain to leave Southampton, and neither Mara nor Onuachu impressing much, Southampton will need another forward to play with Adam Armstrong in Russel Martin’s preferred system. Stewart had a very good season for Sunderland in 2022-23 where he got 10 Goals and 3 Assists in only 13 Games. However, he spent most of last season injured (a common theme with Stewart) and could only play a part in 3 Games.\n\nSimilar to Danny Ings, when fit Stewart is a solid Striker option for any team. Keep an eye out for him in the Pre-season. Update: With the signing of Brereton Diaz, it does not help with the expected minutes of Stewart.\n\nThe rest are mostly Under 21 players like Scarlett (Spurs), Chiwome and Fraser (Wolves), Jebbison (Bournemouth), Mark O’Mahony (Brighton) or players who have crossed 30 like Ladapo (Ipswich), and Hwang Ui-Jo (Forest) who are unlikely to see too many minutes this season in the Premier league. Keep an eye out for Jebbison in particular who could now be starter for Bournemouth with Solanke leaving to Spurs. There are chances that Semenyo could start up top with Jebbison operating from the bench, but keep him on your watchlist.\n\nFurther Read: Best £4.0 Million FPL Defenders for the 2024/25 FPL Season\n\nMy Top 3 Ranking FPL Budget Forwards (£4.5 – £5.5 Million)\n\nJoao Pedro\n\nAdam Armstrong\n\nJamie Vardy\n\nWe will be back with the Mid Range Forward Category very soon.\n\nFurther reads from ALLABOUTFPL ahead of FPL GW1 of the 2024/25 FPL Season\n\nFPL Gameweek 1 Articles:\n\nTop FPL GW1 Differential Picks(<10% TSB) To Target Ahead Of GW1 Deadline\n\nFPL GW1 Scout Selection- Top Picks for GW1 with Stats and Analysis\n\nBest FPL Drafts with Salah + Haaland with Pros/Cons and Key Notes\n\nAllAboutFPL FPL GW1 Team Reveal with Key Notes\n\nTop FPL Gameweek 1 Captain Picks Based on Analysis & Metrics\n\nFPL Team Structure Analysis with Drafts and Ratings\n\nFPL GW1 Tips- Best Formations & Structure, Haaland + Mo?, More\n\nMust Read articles:\n\nPremier League Penalty & Set Piece Takers | 2024/25 PL Season\n\n2024/25 Pre-Season Summary of All 20 Premier League Teams\n\nBest FPL Rotational Pairs and Combinations for 2024/25 FPL Season\n\nBest FPL Budget Enablers For The 2024-25 FPL Season\n\nList of Free to Join Prize FPL Mini Leagues Ahead of 24/25 Season\n\nList of Creative FPL Team Names for the 2024/25 FPL Season\n\nBest £6.5m FPL Midfielders Comparison For 2024/25 FPL Season\n\nTeam wise Best FPL Differentials(<10% TSB) for the 2024/25 Season\n\nBest Liverpool FPL Assets to Target for FPL GW1\n\n2024/25 FPL Season – Teams & Players to Target | Fixture Analysis\n\nBest FPL Picks Outside Top 6 Teams | 2024/25 FPL Season\n\n2024/25 FPL Season- New Rules & Changes | What’s New in FPL?\n\nPlayers to Avoid in FPL GW1 Drafts\n\nUnderpriced FPL Assets from Traditional Big 6 Teams\n\nUltimate 2024/25 FPL Pre-Season Guide: Tips, Preview & More\n\nGW1 Drafts and Analysis:\n\nAllAboutFPL FPL GW1 Team Reveal with Key Notes\n\n204/25 Season FPL Team Structure Guide with Drafts & Ratings\n\nBest FPL Drafts with Salah + Haaland with Pros/Cons and Key Notes\n\nInitial FPL GW1 Drafts for the 24/25 FPL Season with Pros & Cons\n\nPosition-Wise Analysis:\n\nDefenders and Goal Keepers series:\n\nBest FPL Goalkeepers to Target For The 2024/25 FPL Season\n\nBest £4.0 Million FPL Defenders For The 2024/25 FPL Season\n\nBest £4.5 Million FPL Defenders for the 2024/25 FPL Season\n\nBest £5-5.5 Million FPL Defenders for the 2024/25 FPL Season\n\nBest Premium FPL Defenders for the 2024/25 FPL Season(>=6.0 million)\n\nMidfielders Series:Best Premium FPL Midfielders (£8.0 – £12.5 Million) | 24/25 Season\n\nBest Mid-Priced FPL Midfielders (£6.5 -£7.5 Million) | 24/25 Season\n\n£4.5 Million FPL Midfielders Watchlist for the 2024/25 FPL Season\n\nBest Budget FPL Midfielders (£5.0 -£6.0 Million) | 24/25 Season\n\nForwards Series:\n\nBest Premium FPL Forwards Analysis Ahead Of 2024/25 Season\n\nBest FPL Budget Forwards (£4.5 – £5.5 Million) | 24/25 FPL Season\n\nBest FPL Mid Priced Forwards (£6 – £7 Million) | 24-25 Season\n\nBest FPL Mid Priced Forwards (£7.5 – £8 Million) | 24-25 Season\n\nIf you’re new to FPL, here is a link to all our FPL Beginners Guide including FPL Beginner’s Guide- How to play?, Bench boost, Team value, Triple captain, Effective ownership, Price Changes, Free Hit, Bonus Points, and more.\n\nLink to all our 2024/25 Pre-Season articles including all position-wise analysis, team previews, fixture analysis, position-wise analysis, and more.
