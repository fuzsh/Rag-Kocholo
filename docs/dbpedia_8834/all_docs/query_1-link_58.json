        "text": "AUTHOR and Yeovil Town fan Brendon Owen has today (Saturday, December 7, 2013) handed over a £1,000 donation to a charity set-up in memory of a former Huish Park hero who died from cancer at the age of just 31.\n\nBrendon’s third book based on the goings-on with the Glovers entitled Little Old Yeovil chronicled the period just before Gary Johnson returned to Huish Park for a second spell as manager right up to that golden day out at Wembley Stadium in May this year and the League One Play-Off Final success over Brentford.\n\nThe book has been a big hit with Yeovil fans and Brendon has donated a proportion of the proceeds to the Adam Stansfield Foundation.\n\nPHOTO - ABOVE: Little Old Yeovil author Brendon Owen during the book's launch this summer at Waterstone's bookstore in Middle Street, Yeovil.\n\nThe ASF was created in memory of former Yeovil Town, Hereford United and Exeter City striker Stanno who died in August 2010.\n\nThe charity aims to help give young people the unique opportunity to develop life skills through the power of football and to assist them in their goals of living the dream.\n\nPHOTO - RIGHT: Yeovil Town manager Gary Johnson (centre) with Brendon Owen (left) and Mark Kelly.\n\nToday’s presentation was made in the marquee at Huish Park ahead of Yeovil’s Sky Bet Championship match with Charlton Athletic by Brendon to well-known Yeovil fan Mark Kelly who was representing the ASF. They were joined for the presentation by Yeovil manager Gary Johnson – the man who gave Stanno his first big break in football by bringing him to Huish Park from Western League outfit Elmore in November 2000.\n\nJohnson said: “I am very happy to be associated with this donation to the Adam Stansfield Foundation. Adam was a lovely lad and he is often in my thoughts.\n\n“I would recommend Little Old Yeovil as a Christmas present. I have read it and it is a very good read.\n\n“It brought back many good memories – in fact it gave me a tingle down my spine.”\n\nAnd he joked: “I think it was the book – it may have been my wife, no it was definitely the book!”\n\nThe Yeovil boss got a massive cheer when he walked through the doors of the marquee bar where a large crowd had gathered ahead of today’s game between Yeovil and Charlton.\n\nPHOTO - RIGHT: The tribute to Adam Stansfield in the garden of remembrance at Huish Park.\n\nBrendon briefly explained to the audience that he was presenting a cheque for £1,000 to the ASF and wanted to thank all those who had bought the book and had therefore contributed to the donation.\n\n“I would just like to add my thanks to Gary Johnson for sparing the time to come to lend his support to the donation and see and speak to the supporters at such a busy time for him before the Charlton game,” said Brendon.\n\nLittle Old Yeovil is still available to buy from Ebay, Waterstones, WH Smith, the club shop at Huish Park, the Away Travel Club or the Green & Whites.\n\nAdam Stansfield made 67 appearances and scored 22 goals for Yeovil Town – most notably eight goals in the FA Trophy campaign of the 2001-02 season which saw Yeovil beat Stevenage Borough in the final at Villa Park - before going on to enjoy successful spells at Hereford United and Exeter City.\n\nFor more details about the Adam Stansfield Foundation – please click on http://adamstansfieldfoundation.com/ .\n\nPHOTO - ABOVE: The Adam Stansfield Foundation was created after Stanno died in August 2010 from cancer aged just 31.\n\nPHOTO - ABOVE: Little Old Yeovil could be a perfect companion for any fan away enjoying a relaxing holiday sat by the pool."
