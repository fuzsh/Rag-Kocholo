        "text": "Piers has established a reputation as a “formidable advocate” and a “superb fighter” in the many trials that he has conducted. His advocacy is engaging and persuasive, and he is a tenacious cross-examiner. His written work is described as “first class”.\n\nPiers has wide experience of construction, engineering, energy, professional negligence, shipbuilding and IT disputes. He has an “excellent grasp of complex technical issues” including engineering, delay analysis and forensic accountancy. He is known for his meticulous preparation and the clear and attractive presentation of his client’s case to the tribunal. He is described as having “the ear of the Court” and providing “the ideal balance between technical knowledge and effective advocacy”.\n\nSince taking silk, Piers has continued to be instructed to appear in substantial and hard-fought TCC trials. These include a high-profile dispute concerning the Athletes’ Village for the London 2012 Olympics. He represented the Claimant in a termination case involving a petrochemical plant (SABIC UK Petrochemicals v Punj Lloyd), and the Claimant building owner in a multiparty dispute concerning defects in a large residential development (Greenwich Millennium Village v Essex Services Group and Others). In both these cases, his clients were successful. Piers has also appeared before both domestic and international arbitral tribunals in high-value shipbuilding and construction disputes.\n\nPiers also has an extensive advisory practice and is known for his “keen legal acumen and commercial insight”. From 2021, Piers is a joint editor of Keating on Construction Contracts."
