I think this is the best place for me to do that.”\n\nPreston boss Ryan Lowe said: “We’ve followed Kaine for a couple of years now. He’s that tricky wing-back that we’ve wanted to add to the team.\n\n“He’s a ball carrier who can get fans off their seats. He’s exciting and once we knew we could get a deal done with Aston Villa, we thought let’s get this done as soon as possible.\n\n“He’s been on our radar for a while now. He’s a fantastic lad and a fantastic player, who we’re excited to have with us for the upcoming season.”\n\nWhat do you make of the move? Tell us here"
