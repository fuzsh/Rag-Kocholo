        "text": "The football season may be over for fans of Exeter City while for Yeovil Town supporters, there is Sunday’s trip to Altrincham before the curtain officially falls on their National League campaign. But there is one match that both sets of supporters will not want to miss kicking off at 2pm on Saturday.\n\nAfter being cancelled back in 2020, due to the outbreak of Covid, former players of both the Glovers and the Grecians will run out at Yeovil’s Huish Park in a charity match to celebrate the life of former striker Adam Stansfield and raise funds for the charity that was set up in his name.\n\n‘Stanno’ made his name at Yeovil after joining the club from non-league Elmore and after trials at numerous Football League clubs had not materialised in a move. His hard working approach and knack of scoring crucial goals soon endeared him to the Huish Park faithful where he earnt a place in club folklore by scoring the second goal in Yeovil’s 2002 FA Trophy success against Stevenage.\n\nRead More - Thank you to everyone who has supported Exeter City this season\n\nA broken leg stalled his progress with Yeovil and when he returned to action, the club had been promoted to the Football League. It is largely that class of 2002/03 that will form one of the two teams on show this weekend.\n\nThe other is a South West XI made up largely of players Stanno played with during the final years of his career at Exeter City, where he was at before his tragic bowel cancer diagnoses and subsequent passing in August 2010. The match has being organised by Stansfield’s former Yeovil team-mate, Kevin Gall, and former Yeovil employee, Abby Carter.\n\n“It was the ten-year anniversary of the death of Stanno and that was the initial reason we decided to organise the game; we wanted to do something for Stanno and to raise money for the Foundation,” Gall said on why he wanted to arrange such a game.\n\n“Secondly, with the mess that the club is in right now the way things have been going, I hoped this game would have been a bit of a springboard to try and get across the togetherness that we had as a group of players and the whole community, really. We were all very much in it together, the whole town, so I wanted to bring some of that back to the club because I think it has lost it.\n\n“I still speak to Darren Way, Skivo (Terry Skiverton) and a lot of the boys that were there and they understand a lot of the frustrations of the fans and the way that it went from the time they were in the Championship, but these things often happen when you are a little club like Yeovil and get to a certain level on a tiny budget.\n\n“Sadly, the club have been on a downward spiral ever since then and I think that togetherness has been lost. Darren Sarll really tried and did a good job with the group that he had and the budget he had and with what happened to Lee Collins, it was really trying circumstances and it will be nice to see Darren back on Saturday.”\n\nGall is referring to the tragic suicide of the then Yeovil captain Collins in March 2021 at the age of 31, while Sarll, who left as manager to take up a role with Woking six weeks ago, is returning to take charge of the South West XI. It is a team that has plenty of representation from Exeter with the likes of first team manager Matt Taylor, Rob Edwards, Craig Woodman, Steve Tully, Ryan Harley, Dean Moxey and Jon Challinor down to play. The Yeovil team, managed by their legendary former boss – and now Torquay United manager – Gary Johnson, is every bit as impressive with virtually all of their Conference winning team of 2003 involved.\n\n“Everyone is looking forward to it, but it has been a hell of a lot of work and it has taken a hell of a lot of time,” said Gall, who joined the Glovers from Bristol Rovers in February 2003 before firing Yeovil to promotion with 13 goals in 11 games. “But we wouldn’t change it, it is here and now and it will be well worth it to see everybody there on Saturday.\n\n“Getting the players was the easy part. Speaking to the lads and messaging them, every single one of them said yes straight away – it was only Chris Weale, who said he wasn’t sure as he was supposed to be teaching, so I had to get permission from his headmaster!\n\n“But he had no problem with it and even the South West lads – all the former Exeter players and Bristol City lads – they all said no problem straight away, but I think that’s testament to the person Stanno was and how well liked he was more than anything else. Getting all the lads on board was the easy part.”\n\nWith so many illustrious names from the recent history of both clubs, it sure makes for one of the most attractive charity games seen in the area for many years. And with so many natural born winners on show, then don’t be surprised that the players are taking it seriously.\n\n“Absolutely! Nobody wants to lose!” Gall said. “It’s funny, Joe Burnell is playing for the South West team and I have known Joe a long time from when he was at Bristol City and I was at Rovers. I sent him our list of players and he said to me: “Is this going to be a competitive game, Kev?” So it’s started from there really!\n\n“But when you have people like Skivo, Colin Miles, Darren Way and Lee Johnson in your team, there is no game you can let go without wanting to win because that is exactly how they are! Fitness-wise, we are doing good. To be honest, all the lads have tried to take it seriously but I don’t think there was any coming back for some of the lads - there was no chance some of them were going to get fit to be honest! But they have all been trying, bless them. “When I had to order the kits, I did have to order a few more XLs than back in the day!”\n\nUltimately though, it is all in the name of a fantastic charity that continues to do such great work throughout the South West and the name of Adam Stansfield. Fewer players touched the hearts of Yeovil and Exeter fans quite like Stanno, who will always be the bond between two clubs close in distance but the friendliest of rivals.\n\nGall has his own memories of Stansfield, even if he was perhaps the man brought in to replace him when Stansfield was out for so long with that nasty injury. “Stanno was injured when I first came to Yeovil,” Gall said. “He had done so well to come out of non-league and Elmore, but he got himself on the pitch and scored goals, like the winner in the FA Trophy final before he broke his leg.\n\n“Being at Bristol Rovers, I knew a little bit about the lads and Stanno and it wasn’t until we played Carlisle the following season that I actually got to play with him. But he was so hard working on the pitch, he would leave everything on the pitch and even when he was injured, he used to come in all the time to do his rehab, so I soon saw that hard working side to his character.\n\n“He was an unassuming and quiet, but he was very much part of the group of lads that we had together and even on away trips, Stanno would travel to every single one. But everyone remembers him for the hard working attitude he had and covering every blade of grass.\n\n“He often kept himself to himself and loved his dogs, but he was also very much one of the boys and would do absolutely anything for you. I have really fond memories of him and of doing things with all the lads really and I think that’s why we were so close.”\n\nThe Yeovil Town v South West Legends game is an all-ticket game and tickets can be purchased through the official Yeovil Town website.
