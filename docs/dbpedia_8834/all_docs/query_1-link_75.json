        "text": "Hull City remain an attractive proposition in the Championship for prospective new arrivals, despite a difficult summer off the pitch, according to one leading second-tier observer.\n\nCity have struggled to get players in over the summer having seen a host of key men leave along with manager Liam Rosenior, but with the new Championship season set to kick off this weekend, George Elek from the Not The Top 20 podcast believes City fans should have faith, based on the club's work 12 months ago.\n\nThe broadcaster also urged the Tigers to take advantage of West Brom's financial plight and snare a deal for highly-rated winger Tom Fellows.\n\nREAD MORE: Hull City lodge transfer bid for wantaway Bristol City forward but face Championship competition\n\nAlbion are set to be forced to work under a business plan imposed by the EFL over concerns they're set to breach financial rules, which will limit their activity in the transfer market.\n\nBoss Carlos Corberan admitted on Saturday it was the most difficult spell in his coaching career, having seen the likes of Okay Yokuslu and Brandon Thomas-Asante leave. And Elek, speaking on the 1904 Club podcast, says the Tigers should be looking to exploit their plight and snap up 21-year-old winger Fellows who was a regular for the Baggies last term.\n\n\"Given what's going on at West Brom, I do wonder if Tom Fellows might become available. He's a wide player who burst on the scene having had a loan at Crawley the season before in League Two,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a wide player who fits in exactly to the players we've been talking about; (Jaden) Philogene from last season and (Liam) Millar this season, (Jesurun) Rak-Sakyi - those wide players who look to be really direct and positive on the ball every time they get it, happy to take on their players over and over again and a goal threat as well.\n\n\"If West Brom are in some financial difficulty and do need to raise funds, if Tom Fellows is going on the cheap like we saw with Brandon Thomas-Asante last week, I'm sure he's someone a lot of Championship clubs will be looking at and seeing if he becomes available.\"\n\nYou can listen to the latest episode of the 1904 Club via the links below or further up this article...\n\nApple\n\nAudible\n\nSpotify\n\nTunein"
