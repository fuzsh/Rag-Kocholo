        "text": "Our Saturday Downs Syndrome session were joined by a special guest this past weekend, as Exeter City Men’s Forward Jay Stansfield visited Wonford to lend his support to the group.\n\nThe group meet biweekly on Saturday mornings and the growth of the sessions has been on the increase since its return to the Community Trust programme in September. Led by our 2022 ‘Coach of the Year’ Dan Hewitt, the sessions are designated for those under the age of eighteen and are completely FREE to attend, with thanks to the support of the Adam Stansfield Foundation who have helped fund the programme. The fun football sessions are a great way for children to get active and meet new friends.\n\nCity forward Jay was delighted to support the foundation, of which was set up in memory of his father Adam, and get to see the participants enjoying their football. “It’s a real privilege to help and support the session today, its great to see the children kicking a ball around and having fun.”\n\nJay was the guest goalkeeper for the shooting drill, although Jamal Blackman can feel confident in retaining his place based on the morning’s effort! The participants were treated to a goody bag from the Foundation at the end of the session and were able to collect autographs and pictures with the City Number Nine. To round off the perfect Saturday, Jay scored in front of a packed Big Bank in the Men’s 5-0 victory over Accrington Stanley at St James Park in the afternoon.\n\nWe would like to pass on our gratitude to the Adam Stansfield Foundation for their continued support and we were honoured for Gig, Roger and Jay to be able to see the difference the Foundation makes in our Community."
