Adam attended the ceremony at the Bolham Road campus to present the Adam Stansfield Players’ Player Shield to second year Petroc sport student and former Tiverton High School pupil Adam Carey, 18.

Second year Petroc student Joe Wren, 18, received the Chris Vinnicombe Cup after being named player of the year and first year student Ethan Pavey, from Cullompton, received the Golden Boot Award as the top goal scorer from football academy manager Ben Broyd.

Ben said: “Exeter City player Adam Stansfield has had a long association with the area and he’s a great role model as a footballer. “His current battle with illness has reflected some of his on field qualities.

“It was great for our players to meet ‘Stanno’ and to give up his personal time particularly while he is recuperating from ill health just shows the measure of the man.”

He also praised the work of coach Chris Vinnicombe’s efforts at Petroc over the past four years after he was named new manager of Tiverton Town.
