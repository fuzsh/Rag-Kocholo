Following the General Election in 2006 it was noted, in a statement made by the Speaker of the House of Keys,[10] that a technical issue with the interpretation of the Council of Ministers Act 1990[11] and the Interpretation Act 1976[12] had arisen and a Deputy Speaker, once elected to that position, would automatically vacate their departmental office.

The Presiding Officers Act 2008, which received Royal Assent on 11th March 2008, allowed for the appointment of an Acting/Deputy Speaker to be a member of a Department and/or Statutory Board.
