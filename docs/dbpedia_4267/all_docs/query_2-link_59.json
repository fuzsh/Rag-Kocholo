The social impact of these historical changes affected libraries and their users, for example in the damage caused to libraries in the Civil War and the formation of a ‘mass reading public’. Two important themes are the establishment of libraries ‘for the people’ (for example, circulating libraries, and Sunday school and parish libraries) as well as for the privileged (for example, proprietary subscription libraries and gentlemen’s clubs) and the consolidation of national reference collections for the academic community, such as the British Museum. The volume also pays attention to British libraries abroad, to serve British settlers, garrisons and merchants. The period saw great changes in the size and uses of libraries, with many private libraries being incorporated into public and academic collections, and this volume provides the most comprehensive overview available of the riches of early modern library history up to the 1850 Libraries Act. G i l e s M a n d e l b rot e is Curator of British Collections 1501–1800 at the British Library. K . A .

Their history illuminates that culture and many of its facets – the spread of literacy, the growth of scholarship, changes in educational practices – as well as reflecting changing social and political philosophies and practices. As a result, they have often developed in ways which could not have been foreseen by their founders. The fundamental principle, of collecting for immediate and future use and enjoyment, has usually been combined with a social aim, the sharing of books and information among a wider group, which has become one of the characteristics of libraries today. This is one reason why libraries cannot simply be seen as a discrete phenomenon: throughout their history they must be considered part of the society they serve. This context includes the whole reading environment, the vital connection of libraries with social or cultural development, and the political framework which has become increasingly important in the past hundred years; economic and commercial aspects have also become more significant, as they have for the history of the book. The profession of librarianship has matured, especially in the last century, and has in turn affected the development of libraries: indeed it is the interaction of librarians and users that has provided much of the dynamic for that development. Changing methodologies of scholarship and the vicissitudes of private reading, too, affect the way libraries have developed. Libraries vary enormously in form, in size and in purpose, and their nature has inevitably changed over the fifteen centuries encompassed in these volumes. In consequence the three volumes have different emphases and reflect different approaches to the historical record, but they share a common theme. This has inspired the project since its first inception on the initiative of Professor Robin Alston (whose library history database has been invaluable to many contributors), and under the aegis of the then Library History Group of the Library Association and its former Honorary Secretary Graham Jefcoate. Notwithstanding these differences in approach, the history of libraries is a continuum, and the divisions between the three volumes of what is essentially a single work are less precise than the volume titles may indicate. Developments for some years around the mid-seventeenth century may be treated in both Volume I and Volume II, though often in different contexts; and a similar overlap for the mid-nineteenth century exists between Volume II and Volume III. Readers concerned with these periods should be sure to consult both volumes. The Cambridge History of Libraries in Britain and Ireland does not set out to be an exhaustive history of individual libraries: it is, rather, a general history charting the various trends and patterns of development, which studies different types of libraries and individual libraries as part of that broader view. In this way it aims to illuminate not only libraries and their users but also the wider history of the British Isles. Only in understanding their purpose and their context can the role of libraries be properly comprehended.\n\nTHE CAMBRIDGE H I S TO RY O F\n\nL I B R A R I E S I N B R I TA I N AND IRELAND * VO LU M E I I\n\n1640–1850 * Edited by\n\nGILES MANDELBROTE and K.

Rather than introduce a congestion charge, Mr Punch proposed a novel (in more ways than one) expediency: the construction of a large omnibus, two or three storeys high, in which commuters could pass the time spent in traffic jams usefully. There would be compartments for letter-writing, hair-cutting, shaving (during dead stops, of course), and: There will be a refreshment-room in connection with the boot, and a circulating library near the top, so that a passenger on entering may subscribe either for the whole or a portion of his journey.1\n\nThe variety of library facilities available to the man (and woman) on the Clapham omnibus of the mid-nineteenth century was becoming bewilderingly diffuse. Libraries existed to cater for all tastes and communities, from common circulating libraries to London clubs, from parish lending library to cathedral library, from local literary society to university. All classes read, whether for amusement or instruction, and at all possible opportunities. Punch’s plan for an omnibus library was really very sensible. One hundred and twenty years earlier, in 1728, Revd Robert Wodrow (himself a former librarian of Glasgow University) had vigorously deplored the social implications of the foundation of Britain’s first circulating library by the elder Allan Ramsay: profannes is come to a great hight, all the villanous profane and obscene books and playes printed at London by Curle and others, are gote doun from London by Allan Ramsey [sic], and lent out, for an easy price, to young boyes, servant weemen of the better sort, and gentlemen, and vice and obscenity dreadfully propagated.2 1 Punch 11 (1846), 73. 2 R. Wodrow, Analecta, Maitland Club 60 (Edinburgh, 1843), vol. 3, 515–16.\n\n1\n\nLibraries in Britain and Ireland 1640–1850\n\nThis portrayal of library-based depravity contrasts with a more therapeutic initiative of half a century earlier. In 1684 Dr Thomas Tenison, vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, set up a public library explicitly to tempt young curates and chaplains out of the taverns and coffee-houses where he had found them wasting their time and substance.3 (A similar motivation, though not directed at young clergymen, was found again in the public library movement of the later nineteenth century.) Libraries have, indeed, been seen more often as beneficial than as a malign influence, but Wodrow’s outburst reminds us that their history is not one of unsullied sweetness and light, nor of steady progress towards a utopian goal. Thus the world of libraries changed dramatically during the two centuries covered by this volume, with the focus moving from ecclesiastical and academic cloister to public arena (such as the British Museum) as well as cottage hearth. By 1850 any person could borrow any kind of literature and read it in his (or indeed her) own domestic space, or use an institutional library and socialise with like-minded people. The scholar enjoyed far better facilities than ever before. In 1849 Benjamin Disraeli, in a memoir attached to a new edition of Isaac D’Israeli’s Curiosities of literature, recalled how in the 1820s his father had been denied access to the State Paper Office for research. No longer, proclaimed the book’s reviewer in The Times: The difficulties interposed in the way of Mr Disraeli when he commenced his operations, nearly 60 years ago, are inconceivable to the student of to-day, to whom the libraries of the world fly open, and who, so far from imploring admittance to the shrine of knowledge, is now earnestly invited to enter and freely to choose of the wealth before him . . . The reading-room of the British Museum, in which diggers and miners now congregate with a zeal and numerical strength rivalled only by the better rewarded groups assembling about Californian rocks and rivers, was, 60 years since, the peaceful and unknown retreat of some half-dozen pious souls, unwilling that the memorable deeds and fruitful lives of generations dead and gone should pass away from the earth unregistered and unbeloved.4\n\nThe present volume charts the story of how libraries developed between two revolutionary periods, by way of two centuries of profound change – from the Civil War to the time of the Chartist riots, by way of the religious controversies of the 1680s and the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and, a century later, the French Revolution and its philosophies. All these events had a social 3 J. Evelyn, Diary, ed. E. S. de Beer (Oxford, 1955), vol. 4, 367. 4 The Times, 9 January 1849.\n\n2\n\nIntroduction: the changing world of libraries\n\nimpact which directly affected libraries and the people who used them – for example, the damage caused to cathedral and college libraries in the Civil War, the rise of a readership for the radical and revolutionary writings of the 1790s (which inspired George III to demand registration of the printing press), and the formation of a reading public who wanted access to the latest publications about the events of the day as well as the provision of books for leisure, but who could not necessarily afford (or did not desire) to buy books themselves. In Scotland, the violent religious conflict of the 1690s had its effects on libraries (where library promoters such as James Kirkwood and Andrew Cranston were forced to flee to England), as did the florescence of the Scottish Enlightenment over the next hundred years and the Disruption in the Church of Scotland in the 1840s. And in Ireland sectarian and political divisions were felt, as so often, across the whole spectrum of library provision, even extending to the execution for high treason of the librarian of the Linen Hall Library, Thomas Russell, in 1803.5 The eighteenth century saw many advances in library services, with a widening of access, a growth in collections and the development of new models of library provision – not to mention some spectacular examples of library architecture. By the early nineteenth century, two key themes are first the increasing establishment of libraries ‘for the people’ (for example penny circulating libraries, Sunday school and parish libraries, mechanics’ institutes) as well as libraries for the privileged (for example proprietary subscription libraries, in which members bought shares, and gentlemen’s clubs), and secondly the consolidation of national reference collections for scholars, such as the Bodleian Library (only half a century old at the beginning of this volume) and the library of the British Museum, founded at about our mid-point. And British libraries spread abroad, principally to serve settlers in the colonies but also for the benefit of British merchants, soldiers and sailors (and convicts). The period of this volume also saw a marked shift in the history of personal libraries, in terms of the extension of personal book ownership at many levels of society, the growth of formally organised sales of libraries, with printed catalogues, and the fashionable development of book-collecting. Other significant private collections were to become components of the British Museum and other academic libraries. Many smaller collections were being built up for future transformation into publicly available assets, while burgeoning country houses contained libraries increasingly intended for social rather than purely intellectual purposes. 5 J. Killen, A history of the Linen Hall Library 1 788–1 988 (Belfast, 1990), 45–6.\n\n3\n\nLibraries in Britain and Ireland 1640–1850\n\nA division has been made within the volume at the year 1750. In many respects this is an artificial break, chosen partly because the development of particular kinds of libraries over two centuries, e.g. in universities, cannot easily be related in a single chapter. But the 1750s was a significant decade, witnessing the first appearance of proprietary subscription libraries (a significant milestone in the spread of general libraries outside London) and most notably the coincidental foundation of the British Museum in 1753. Although the latter’s influence was not to be visible for several decades, this event was an important step in inaugurating a national library service. It would, though, be an exaggeration to suggest that the founders of the British Museum were specifically planning a national library, since the provision of books was an integral part of the larger objective of housing a collection of diverse curiosities. Many of its earliest librarians and keepers were scientists; in a parallel development, this period saw the foundation of many scientific and medical libraries within learned colleges and societies. Although the crucial privilege of legal deposit – without which no truly national library could prosper – was deemed to have passed to the Museum with the arrival of the Royal Library in 1757, this was not codified in law until 1842. Only then did the British Museum begin to regard itself as having an imperial role befitting the country’s status as a colonial power. This led to a long period of impressive growth in the library until its policies changed as Britain’s place in the world changed, and by the end of the twentieth century its successor, the British Library, settled down to a more limited role which had become relatively much closer to that of other European national libraries. The real pioneers of a national library were the individuals responsible for the original collections in the decades before the foundation of the British Museum – Cotton, Harley and Sloane. By the mid-nineteenth century the prime force in the library’s progress was Antonio Panizzi, and his energetic involvement in library matters is an object lesson in another theme of this volume – that the history of libraries is not primarily about institutions, but about the individuals behind them. Four walls and a few bookshelves do not make a library, only a repository; a library has to be exploited to serve any kind of purpose, but its accessibility and usefulness depend entirely on the people responsible for its existence and maintenance – and particularly the often unsung compilers of catalogues! Similarly all kinds of libraries – such as parish and school libraries, and even the Inns of Court libraries – often owed their growth to individual benefactors, men like Humphrey Chetham, Narcissus Marsh, Daniel Williams or the Marquess of Dorchester. 4\n\nIntroduction: the changing world of libraries\n\n‘Public’ libraries, as we know them today, did not exist before 1850. Like the influence of the British Museum, the effects of the Public Libraries Act of 1850 (where this volume leaves off ) only became obvious to later generations. The present volume traces the rise of different kinds of libraries which were to culminate in that overwhelming pressure for Parliament to legislate to enable everyone to have free access to a municipal library. All played their part in creating a need for ‘popular’ local libraries as well as influencing the demand for ‘free’ education which was not realised through legislation until two decades after the first Public Libraries Act. This volume is not a dictionary, not a gazetteer and not an encyclopedia. It does not aspire to provide a history of every library which ever existed during two hundred years; many libraries, particularly circulating libraries, began with a flourish but are never heard of again. Rather, the aim is to produce a ‘social’ history of a vital movement in British cultural history, in particular how libraries – essentially ‘private’ when the volume opens – moved inevitably and inexorably into the truly public domain. At the beginning of the period, ordinary persons read, and read voraciously, the products of the press, whether pamphlets, broadsheets or newsletters. But they did not borrow books, except amongst themselves. Libraries were the preserve of the e´ lite and were seen as institutions for the preservation and consultation of books. At the Bodleian, both King Charles I and Oliver Cromwell were refused permission to borrow volumes. The librarian, Thomas Barlow, explained the rule: The Library is a magazine which the pious founder hath fix’d in a publick place for a publick use; and though his charity to private persons is such that he will hinder none (who is justly qualify’d and worthy) to come to it, yet his charity to the publick is such that he would not have it ambulatory, to goe to any private person. And sure ’tis more rational that Mahomet should go to the mountaine, than that the mountaine should come to Mahomet.6\n\nBodley’s ideal of the institutional library as a reference library for serious study is one of the main strands of this volume because it was a model for others. But there were other patterns too. Two hundred years later, libraries of one type or another were in every town and village, and the need for home-lending libraries had become an equally important and vibrant strand in library history. An imposing library building might make a strong impression, but libraries are more than specimens of architecture; their strength and importance does not just lie within their physical environment. Many subscription libraries were 6 W. D.

What was important was the literary treasure contained on their shelves and the community which made this accessible. This volume attempts to explain the spread of such treasure-houses of knowledge.\n\n6\n\np a r t on e *\n\nT H E E X PA N S I O N OF BOOK COLLECTIONS 1640–1750\n\n2\n\nAncients and moderns: cross-currents in early modern intellectual life j o s e ph m . l e v i n e When Jonathan Swift decided to take stock of the intellectual culture of his time, he did so by taking sides in the great quarrel between the ancients and the moderns that had been gradually coming to a head for more than a century. It was natural for him to adopt the cause of his patron, Sir William Temple, and see what could be done to defend the allegiance to antiquity that Temple had argued in a brief but provocative essay that started the argument in 1690. What Temple had done there was to assert that every great cultural achievement lay in the past and that the best hope of the moderns was simply to acknowledge and imitate them. This was an old argument but it was especially provocative after a tumultuous century of modern accomplishment and Temple was answered at once, particularly by William Wotton and the defenders of the new science in the Royal Society. Thus began the battle of the books which Swift described and resumed in his own little work – and which he set appropriately enough in a library.1 To make sense of that noisy quarrel, one must look past its more frivolous moments to discover its foundation in a clash of cultural ideals, deeply rooted in European history. In particular, there were reflected in it two different attitudes that had come into conflict almost from the beginning of ancient times and which were often to be resumed in later generations. On the one hand, there was a philosophical/theological ideal that taught that the highest end of culture was to understand the unchanging principles of the natural and supernatural worlds. On the other hand, there was a more mundane notion that all that was necessary was to discover and teach only what was immediately 1 Swift’s little work, The battle of the books, was added as an appendix to A tale of a tub (London, 1704), in which he had already satirised the learning of the moderns; the text has been edited with a full apparatus by A. C. Guthkelch and D. Nichol Smith, 2nd edn (Oxford, 1958). Temple’s essay appeared first in his Miscellanea, part 2 (London, 1690), and was answered by Wotton in his Reflections upon ancient and modern learning (London, 1694): J. M. Levine, The battle of the books: history and literature in the Augustan age (Ithaca, NY, 1991).\n\n9\n\nThe expansion of book collections 1640–1750\n\nuseful in human affairs. The first was a contemplative ideal that exalted reason; the second an active one that required eloquence. Both proponents organised schools to transmit these rival notions of paideia; both set out their competing views in compendious treatises that described and defended their practice; and both exemplified their teaching in works of philosophy and science in the one instance, and in the rhetorical arts – oratory, literature and history – in the other.2 Plato, above all, had represented this argument in many of his dialogues, in which he exalted the culture of dialectic and set Socrates deliberately against the sophists and their rhetoric; while the sophists, led by Isocrates, retorted with their own educational schemes and schools, which were elaborated later for the Romans by Cicero and Quintilian among others.3 In this way, classical culture was transmitted to later times, not as one consistent whole, but rather in two parts and in rivalry. For early modern England it was only after the Renaissance and the Reformation that this ancient antithesis was fully resumed. The middle ages had known some ancient philosophy, especially Aristotle, and used it to advantage in the universities for the philosophical/theological culture of scholasticism. The period had also known something of classical rhetoric, although it had confined its interest largely to peripheral matters. During the ‘twelfthcentury renaissance’ there had been some modest resumption of the age-old rivalry between the logical and rhetorical arts; but it was only with the revival of civic life and learning, first in Italy, then in the rest of Europe, that the two cultures of antiquity were fully restored.4 As far as philosophy is concerned, despite the immediate hostility of the Reformation, medieval scholasticism did not die, and the Aristotelian corpus was resumed in the universities for its use to a reformed theology – although it was now an Aristotle freshly studied in Greek and extended to include\n\n2 See, above all, W.

That there was a medieval humanism is now well agreed, but in the words of one its advocates, ‘There was no time for artistic representation or literary elegance’: R. W. Southern, Medieval humanism and other studies (New York, 1970), 48. Charles Homer Haskins’s view that ‘ancient rhetoric was chiefly concerned with oratory, medieval rhetoric with letter-writing’ may have to be extended (to preaching, for example), but still embodies a basic distinction. Cicero’s rule-book, the De inventione and the spurious Ad herennium, were thus preferred to his De oratore, which was hardly known: Haskins, Renaissance of the twelfth century (Cambridge, 1937), 128, and various works by J. J. Murphy, including Rhetoric in the middle ages (Berkeley, CA, 1974).\n\n10\n\nAncients and moderns\n\nhis commentators.5 At the same time, the rest of ancient philosophy (largely forgotten in the middle ages) was also recovered. Above all, Plato was retrieved and a fresh neo-platonism invented and revivified. In England this culminated in the seventeenth century in a formidable group of theologians at Cambridge University led by Henry More and Ralph Cudworth, who included among their pupils the young William Temple.6 Eventually, even the ancient sceptics and those dangerous materialists, Lucretius and the Epicurians, also began to circulate. It was Thomas Stanley’s History of philosophy (1655–62) that was the first to tell this whole tale in England – and incidentally help to invent a new genre.7 But while the philosophers were renewing and extending their ancient rivalries with one another, for the most part they still continued to nourish their ancient contempt for sophistry, resisting as far as they could any reinstatement of the humanities in the universities and insisting on the primacy of logic over rhetoric. So the Chancellor Sir Thomas More at the very beginning of the period had had to intervene in a battle between ‘Greeks’ and ‘Trojans’ at Oxford, and try to enforce an uneasy truce between the two sides that was to linger perilously for many years.8 And the age-old controversy between the life of contemplation and the vita activa that had been set out memorably in Cicero’s De officiis and resumed by the Italians – where it could be read in English in Castiglione’s popular Courtier – was still being argued in England late in the seventeenth century, as in the polite exchange between John Evelyn and George Mackenzie.9 Meanwhile the ‘new’ philosophers were no more hospitable to poetry and oratory and the faculty of imagination than the old.\n\n5 C.

Costello, The scholastic curriculum at seventeenth-century Cambridge (Cambridge, MA, 1958). 6 The best overview remains: E. Cassirer, The Platonic renaissance in England, trans. J. P. Pettegrove (Edinburgh, 1953). The most impressive work of the platonists was R. Cudworth, The true intellectual system of the universe (London, 1678). 7 For the historiography of philosophy at this period, see C. B. Schmitt and others (eds.), The Cambridge history of Renaissance philosophy (Cambridge, 1988). 8 The two sides were the traditional scholastic theologians and the new humanist exponents of the Greek language and letters. The latter, More points out, involves the study of the ancient poets, orators and historians and was invaluable among other things for teaching prudence in human affairs. See volume 15 of the Yale edition of the Complete works of St. Thomas More, ed. D. Kinney (New Haven, CT, 1986), 139. 9 The exchange occurred in 1665–6 and is reproduced in B.

Levine, Between the ancients and the moderns: baroque culture in Restoration England (New Haven, CT, 1999), 8–10. For the Courtier in English, there was an early and popular translation by Thomas Hoby (London, 1561), and another by Robert Samber in 1724.\n\n11\n\nThe expansion of book collections 1640–1750\n\nSo John Locke, it was remembered later, typically ‘effected to despise poetry and depreciate the ancients’.10 Still it was the Italian humanists, not the philosophers, who brought about the most complete and deliberate revival of antiquity and refashioned the grammar schools of the literate classes. By the sixteenth century, they had, with their northern followers, captured the education of the courts and cities throughout Europe and refashioned the curriculum for their aristocratic and civic patrons. They brought back into circulation as models for practical use all the ancient classics of rhetoric, poetry and history that had once comprised Cicero’s studia humanitatis. For the humanists, it was the art of speech that once again became the capstone of secular education, and they insisted that their young students be brought up on an exclusive diet of the ancient Greek and Latin works in the original languages. Tudor educators like Erasmus and Roger Ascham, whose works were still being read in the eighteenth century, laid out the purposes and strategies of the new curriculum, while the grammar schools put them into practical use, where they lasted undisturbed until recent times.11 Their express aim was always to prepare the aspiring young oratorstatesman for public life – for which neither formal philosophy nor theology seemed of much use.12 As a result, logic was either downplayed or reformed under the influence of rhetoric (as in the influential works of Peter Ramus), while the rest of the philosophical curriculum, with the exception of moral philosophy, was pretty much ignored, except by those who continued to aim at a career in religion.13 Yet even as this revival of the classics was occurring, it was accompanied in England by another deliberate resumption of antiquity: by the Protestant Reformation. Whatever disagreements the reformers may have had among themselves, they were all agreed that the best models and dearest wisdom of Christianity lay in the Bible and/or the early church, and that the ‘modern’ ideas and practices of Catholicism had been corrupted over time.

It was soon perceived that all the ancient works needed to be discovered, edited, explicated and printed, before they could be usefully employed. In short all the disciplines of modern scholarship, or what were then called philology and antiquities, had to be created and elaborated, including palaeography, diplomatics and epigraphy, numismatics and archaeology.16 By the end of the seventeenth century, after many generations, the libraries were full of ponderous tomes in Latin displaying this new learning, as well as vernacular digests that were meant for schoolboys and popular consumption. One grand series of works, begun in the late seventeenth century by the Dutchmen Graevius and Gronovius, was extended eventually to fill some thirty-nine volumes in folio; while another by a single author, the Frenchman Montfaucon, took fifteen more.17 And of course the classics themselves had to be reissued again and again with an ever more cumbersome surrounding of explanatory notes and commentaries. The ancient works were old, but the scholarship was new – collaborative, cumulative and progressive – thus furnishing (like natural science, which in this way it resembled) an unexpected ground for the claims of modernity. Now, it was in the face of all this anciennet´e that the moderns began to assert their many claims, and it was the philosophers, especially those who were concerned with nature, who led the way. The ‘scientific revolution’ was aimed in the first place against Aristotle and ancient science – the science of Ptolemy, 14 The Calvinists preferred the Bible; the Anglicans, the Fathers; and this furnished one of the grounds for controversy between the Puritans and the Arminians that began under Charles I and continued for the rest of the century. Nevertheless both sides agreed to dispute the ‘modern’ inventions of Roman Catholicism for what they insisted was an older and better authority. 15 Milton is still defending pagan books against Christian censors in the Areopagitica (London, 1644). 16 A good introduction to the subject is L.

Anthony Grafton has done much in recent years to illuminate the whole subject; besides his magisterial study of Joseph Scaliger, see his Defenders of the text: the traditions of scholarship in an age of science (Cambridge, MA, 1991).

It was almost immediately turned into English.\n\n13\n\nThe expansion of book collections 1640–1750\n\nGalen and Pliny the Elder – which was found to be increasingly inadequate.18 In England it was Francis Bacon who led the way, challenging most of the ancient works as misguided and proposing a new experimental method for the advancement of learning. Eventually, and after much skirmishing, the Royal Society adopted this essentially Baconian posture and designed a deliberate programme of scientific progress that could only provoke the defenders of antiquity into combat. But while its early publicists, such as Sprat and Glanvill, were making the Baconian case for modernity, it was probably the actual works of discovery by Hooke, Harvey, Boyle and their many colleagues, and most emphatically by Isaac Newton, that did most to win the cause.19 In 1690, however, the case was still in doubt. Temple, who had been educated at Cambridge (though he did not pay a lot of attention), remembered that according to his neo-platonic teachers almost everything that was valuable in contemplative knowledge had been transmitted already from the earliest times through an ancient wisdom or prisca theologia long before Aristotle and the Greeks. According to them it was such pre-classical philosophers as the Egyptian Hermes Trismegistus and the Persian Zoroaster, not to say the Chaldeans, Brahmans and Hebrew Kabbalists, who had anticipated the most basic principles of human knowledge, which they transmitted only later to Pythagoras and Plato and their modern followers.20 At the same time, there were many who continued to believe that Adam and Moses had preceded even those early sages as the ultimate sources of wisdom.21 Such new-fangled theorists as Hobbes and Descartes shocked the world with their pretensions to modernity but did not easily persuade the world of their value, while Locke’s great essay was only just about to appear. Furthermore, it was not yet clear just how much of a practical payoff the new science could claim, whatever its 18 For a survey of recent literature, see M.

Temple was thus not really naive when in his little essay he insisted on the ancient claims to all philosophical and theological knowledge. Nevertheless, it was with the humanities that Temple felt most secure in his anciennet´e. Was there anyone in 1690 who would defend modern literature against the ancient poets, orators and historians? As a writer, politician and man of the world, Temple had no doubt about the superiority of the ancients in that regard, and of his own competence to judge. Even some of the members of the Royal Society were inclined to allow something to Temple on that point. The ancients, they admitted, had excelled in almost all of literature and the fine arts, although they remained steadfast in their defence of the moderns in science and philosophy. Thus upon reading Temple, the great naturalist John Ray wrote immediately to a friend in the Royal Society and grudgingly allowed that the ancients had indeed excelled the moderns in ‘acuteness of wit and elegancy of language in all their writings, in their poetry and their oratory’. He believed that that was simply the result of devoting all their energies to cultivating them while neglecting all the natural history and experimental philosophy that Ray preferred and which the moderns had so far developed. The arts of language, he asserted flatly, ‘are by wise men censured as inferior to the study of things. words being but the picture of things; and to be wholly occupied about them, is to fall in love with the picture, and neglect the life’. In the case of oratory, which he recognised as the best of the humanistic arts, Ray was altogether contemptuous; it was ‘but a kind of voluptuary one, like cookery, which sophisticates meats and cheats the palate, spoiling wholesome viands and helping unwholesome’.22 Meanwhile, for the contemporary poets and orators, it is perhaps enough to say that they went on about their business pretty much in disregard of modern philosophy and science and the strictures of such as Ray; and they were, if anything, even more devoted to ancient literature than before. Augustan writers, like Alexander Pope and his friends (including Swift), had few qualms about advocating the ancient superiority and continued to draw on classical authority for inspiration, whatever doubts Dryden and others may have occasionally expressed in an earlier generation.23 It was the eighteenth century, 22 John Ray to Tancred Robinson, 15 December 1690: E. Lankester (ed.), Correspondence of John Ray (London, 1848), 229. Ray also believed that the moderns could vie with the ancients in geometry, arithmetic and history, and surpass them in astronomy, geography and chronology. More controversially, he was willing to contest ancient superiority in the fine arts, as well as politics and morality. For Ray, see C. E. Raven, John Ray, naturalist, 2nd edn, 2 vols. (Cambridge, 1950). 23 For Dryden’s ambivalence, see Levine, Between the ancients and the moderns, 33–109. The classic text is Dryden’s Essay on dramatic poesie (London, 1667), where the issue is debated.\n\n15\n\nThe expansion of book collections 1640–1750\n\nafter all, that saw the triumph of neo-classicism. And it is no coincidence that the golden age of English oratory – of Pitt, Burke, Fox and the rest – should occur coincidentally with the triumph of the ancient arts and architecture, and that English politicians should imagine themselves re-enacting in their own senate the unrivalled performances of Cicero and Demosthenes.24 Yet it would be too easy simply to divide the field and leave it at that. Even though there were doubtless two distinct cultures in early modern times, with different origins and appeals, not everyone was satisfied with this bifurcation, and the two forms of classical paideia were not ever watertight compartments. Curiously it was Francis Bacon, who had inspired so much modernity, who probably made the most influential attempt to bridge the two cultures. Bacon had encountered both humanists and scholastics in combat during his own education at Cambridge, and he responded by trying to reform contemporary philosophy and bring it down to earth from its high contemplative ideal, making it inductive and practical.25 He borrowed from the rhetorical arts the notion that historical examples could be collected and assembled and generalised to provide the rules for life and conduct, and he advocated their practical use in the world. A new philosophy was thus both possible and desirable, but it must be a philosophy whose chief task would be to unlock the secrets of nature and put them to work, and it must be collaborative and progressive. In thus transforming philosophy into a practical matter he hoped to make it acceptable, along with letters, to the man of affairs. In canvassing the arts and sciences of his time, Bacon continued to look generally backward for inspiration in the humanities, but decidedly forward to the progress of natural science. It was this alternative, somewhere between the two poles of ancients and moderns, that appealed so much to those moderate ‘moderns’ like William Wotton, and which allowed them to grant the humanities to the ancients, while rejecting Aristotle for the new philosophy.26 To some extent the men of affairs responded affirmatively. Natural philosophy required means and leisure, and the advancement of learning needed the activity and patronage of the upper classes. Bacon himself had set the example as both philosopher and lord chancellor, and it was sometimes recalled that he 24 J. M. Levine, ‘Why neoclassicism?

Levine, ‘Natural history and the new philosophy: Bacon, Harvey, and the two cultures’, in Levine, Humanism and history, 123–54. 26 It is thus no accident that it was just when the authority of Aristotle as a scientist and metaphysician was coming under attack that the humanist Aristotle of the Rhetoric and the Poetics came into his own.\n\n16\n\nAncients and moderns\n\nhad given his life to investigating a frozen chicken by catching pneumonia and prematurely dying as a martyr to science. When later the aristocratic Robert Boyle dedicated his career to propagating the experimental science in word and deed, he provided an example of enormous importance.27 Throughout Europe a vast ‘republic of letters’ developed to expedite exchange among the proponents of science. Correspondence, periodicals and learned societies were some of its prominent new institutions.28 Yet it still seemed preposterous to many like Swift and the author of the Transactioneer (who made so much fun of the activities described in the official Transactions of the Royal Society) to find, at the end of the seventeenth century, a savant on hands and knees collecting rocks and studying worms.29 Even so, it was not only secular learning that became a battleground between ancients and moderns. Bacon, it is true, had tried to separate natural science from religion, but for many of his followers (for Boyle and Newton for example) knowledge of nature could be used to reinforce or prove the truths of theology. Increasingly, however, in the seventeenth century, it was to history that religious polemic turned. Before long nearly every Christian text and every Christian heresy was resumed by one party or another in the internecine religious controversies that marked the era. The whole of Christian history was recalled for polemical purposes and the early church Fathers underwent something of the same revival as their classical secular counterparts.30 Even the text of the Bible was newly edited, translated and explicated.31 And once again, the modern disciplines of classical philology were called upon to restore the ancient sources of Christian belief. No wonder perhaps that varieties of 27 S. Shapin, ‘Who was Robert Boyle?

Fox, John Mill and Richard Bentley: a study of the textual criticism of the New Testament 1 675 –1 729 (Oxford, 1954).\n\n17\n\nThe expansion of book collections 1640–1750\n\nscepticism should also begin to recur and that deists and socinians should turn up later in the century to help provoke that remarkable apologetical literature which for a time seems to have dwarfed almost every other form of publication. Strangely enough it was the orthodox Anglicans (Wotton among them) who first glimpsed the notion that the progress of knowledge could be extended to theology as well as to secular learning and that the moderns would show some advance over antiquity there too.32 But how was it possible to assimilate all this learning, both ancient and modern, literary and scientific? Few tried, put off (as Pepys complained apologetically) by the more pressing business of ordinary life.33 But for someone like John Evelyn, who was blessed with health, long life and sufficient means, it seemed necessary to sort out the possibilities, although the difficulty of the project was growing more obvious with every passing year. The seventeenth century admired those hearty spirits who tried to take all knowledge for their province, and called them virtuosi, although, to be sure, they also suffered much satire.34 Thus Evelyn was early compared to that consummate continental virtuoso Peiresc, whose life was presented to the world by the philosopher Gassendi as The mirrour of true nobility and gentility and translated into English in 1657. Peiresc, according to his translator (who dedicated his book to Evelyn), had ‘a sprightful curiosity [which] left nothing unreacht into in the vast all-comprehending Dominions of Nature and Art’. From him, the English gentleman could learn ‘that knowledge, which is the highest perfection of Man, by which he differs from the Beasts, must needs be the principal accomplishment of a Gentleman; and that the compleatly knowing man, must be Janus-like, double-fac’d, to take the cognizance of Times past, as well as the late-past, or present times, wherein he lives’.35 Evelyn gave it a try, devoting himself first to literature, which however he gradually abandoned, and then to all the practical arts and sciences, from etching to gardening, architecture to numismatics, making many useful contributions, some of which appeared first 32 R.

Nor was he by any means indifferent to the worldly need for ancient rhetoric, for the need for ‘a more ornate and graceful manner of speaking’. A proper education in the classical authors, he wrote, ‘would not only grace and furnish the bar with excellent lawyers, but the nation with able persons fit for any honourable employment, to serve and speak in Parliaments and councils; give us good magistrates and justices for reference at home in the country; able ambassadours and orators abroad, in a word qualified patriots and pillars of state’.37 He saw the importance of sound new editions of the classics and even proposed a scheme for publishing them to his old friend, the earl of Clarendon.38 As a consequence, Evelyn bought everything he could of both ancient and modern learning and was consumed by the problem of organising and utilising his remarkable library. He translated Gabriel Naud´e’s Instructions concerning erecting of a library (1661) and left a catalogue of his books with a ‘Method for a Librarie According to the Intellectual Powers’: i.e. memory (which included philology, history and works of the imagination) and judgement (which included mathematics, philosophy and theology), setting out locations for all the shelves and presses.39 He also wrote another unfinished piece about collecting and using manuscripts.40 And he proffered endless advice about bibliography to those who needed help, like his friend Pepys, who was writing a history of navigation, and William Nicolson, who was putting together his English historical library (1696–99) as a guide to all the sources of\n\n36 G.

Bray (London, 1902), vol. 3, 378–9. He had also once written a small tract to show the utility of the modern languages, which he had hoped to publish but which somehow got lost. ‘There is in it’, he told Pepys, ‘a usefull rescention of good authors, and a method of reading them to advantage’: 6 December 1681, in J. R. Tanner (ed.), Private correspondence . . . of Samuel Pepys (London, 1926), vol. 1, 16–17. 38 Evelyn to Clarendon, 27 Nov. 1666, in his Diary and correspondence, ed. H. B.

W. Bray, 2 vols. (London, 1818), 333–48. One should not, he remarks there of the search, ‘disclaime the rummaging sometimes of the most neglected corners of Shops, and other obscure places, however cover’d with dust and cobwebs’. As Geoffrey Keynes (who shared the passion) remarks, ‘this breathes the true spirit of the game’ (John Evelyn, 7).\n\n19\n\nThe expansion of book collections 1640–1750\n\nBritish history.41 Yet even he sometimes found himself in despair at the increase of learning which already threatened to overwhelm even the most indefatigable of the virtuosi with the problem of too much knowledge. Nor did he find an easy way to reconcile the two ancient forms of paideia. Late in life he wrote to his friend Pepys, imploring that someone might bring order out of chaos and select only such books as were most necessary. What a benefactor were he that were able and willing to give us a catalogue of authors as were only, and absolutely, and fully effectual to the ascertaining of such a competency of practical, usefull, and speculative knowledge too, as one might hope to benefit by within the ordinarie circles of one’s life, without being bewildered . . . I am still persuaded that this were not impossible, and that lesse than a hundred authors, studied in proper method, would go a great way towards this end. I do not meane by excluding any of the Classics, which in a very few yeares may all be read, together with the Greeke and Latine Historians, from Herodotus downwards. But I speake of the subsidiarie arts and other faculties, as far as to accomplish one that did not intend a profession.\n\nEvelyn even proposed a candidate for the job in his new young friend William Wotton.42 Indeed there was probably no one who was better equipped in his generation to take on the task. Wotton had received an extraordinary education in the classics from his father, who had taught him the languages and read him the works of Greece and Rome and ancient Israel, while still a child. Less obviously, he had become interested in the new world of natural science, and soon entered the Royal Society as its youngest member. To Evelyn and his friends there was no one who was better prepared to take on the superficial essay of Temple and provide a proper measure of contemporary learning. When the Reflections on ancient and modern learning appeared, Pepys praised it at once for its learning, ‘through all the dimensions of it, length, breadth, and depth’.43 Wotton had taken each of the disciplines one by one and judiciously and patiently assessed their present state. He accepted the traditional division of the field and generally rewarded the ancients for their achievements in literature and the arts and the moderns in science and philosophy. And although this did not immediately conclude the battle, this was the view that was generally accepted in the eighteenth century. 41 These were corrected and enlarged in 1714, and brought together with a Scottish (1702) and an Irish part (1724) in 1736: J. M. Levine, ‘William Nicolson, virtuoso’, in C. Jones and G. Holmes, London diaries of William Nicolson (Oxford, 1985), 11–17; Levine, Battle of the books, 288–90. 42 Evelyn to Pepys, 2 September 1694, in Howarth, Letters, 248–50. 43 Pepys to Evelyn, 10 August 1694, in Howarth, Letters, 246–8.\n\n20\n\nAncients and moderns\n\nFor the moment, however, Temple and his party were not convinced. They had little to say about natural science, in which they were frankly not interested, and preferred to make fun of it. Their preferred weapon was satire, and, like the brilliant rhetoricians that they were, they tried ably to distract their readers from the substantive issues. On one point alone were they specially concerned. Among other modern achievements, Wotton had claimed philology and had set aside a whole chapter in the Reflections to praise the many advances in scholarship which he believed allowed the moderns to know more about the past than even the ancients themselves. He was able to back up this claim in the second edition of his work by including a whole new contribution from his friend and fellow modern, the great philologist Richard Bentley. Bentley showed there how the allegedly ancient Epistles of Phalaris, which had been praised by Temple as an example of ancient superiority in prose writing, was actually a late and clumsy fraud. This was disturbing and fraught with consequences for a proper appreciation of ancient letters. What was true about Phalaris might easily be extended to Homer – and perhaps even to the Bible! Temple and his friends responded in a fury by deriding Bentley’s methods and conclusions, claiming their own special competence to judge as practising authors and men of the world. Their satire was effective enough to postpone a reckoning for a time, even though Bentley enlarged his arguments pretty conclusively in a masterful separate work that both disposed of Phalaris as a classic and showed the full possibilities of the new scholarship for reading and understanding the ancient writings.44 In short, it seemed to the proponents of anciennet´e that the moderns wished to take away just what they most desired: the immediate practical value of the classics to polite society. By requiring an intimate knowledge of the ancient languages with all the arcane disciplines that might contribute to their meaning, they were putting the classics beyond the range of ordinary people, who needed to get on with their lives and had not the skills and leisure for scholarship. By insisting on the necessity of learning, the moderns were (however inadvertently) distancing the ancients from contemporary life and making them less immediately accessible. ‘It is a pretty poem’, Bentley is supposed to have said to Alexander Pope on his translation of the Iliad, ‘but it is not Homer’. But that was just the version that Swift and the eighteenth century really wanted – a Homer, bereft of the massive erudition that (for example) 44 Wotton’s second edition with Bentley’s appendix was published in 1697; it was answered by a collaborative satirical work attributed to Charles Boyle and known popularly as ‘Boyle against Bentley’ (1698); and then by Bentley in his Dissertations on the letters of Phalaris (London, 1699).\n\n21\n\nThe expansion of book collections 1640–1750\n\nsurrounded Barnes’s edition of the Greek (1711) in two volumes and nearly 2,000 pages, one that simply reflected their own eighteenth-century values, rather than the primitive values of early Greece.45 So Swift had no hesitation in the Battle of the books in giving a resounding victory to the ancients over the moderns, to Temple and his friends over Wotton and Bentley, both of whom were thoroughly disgraced and defeated in the mock struggle at the end of his little work. Nevertheless, the quarrel went merrily on for a long time unresolved, and Swift did not gain the simple victory that he envisaged. For the most part, the defenders of antiquity continued to exert their authority in the ensuing neo-classical age in literature and the arts, while the moderns, just as Wotton had forecast, reaffirmed and extended their victory in modern science and technology. Nevertheless, when at last the quarrel subsided, it left at least one legacy in the continuing question about the relationship of past literature to modern life and the rˆole of modern scholarship in serving or obstructing the practical value of the classics. For the book-collector and librarian, then as now, it remained an open question just how much of all this learning, how many of these books about books and books about things, was necessarily to be encouraged and absorbed within the practical confines of bulging shelves, narrow budgets and straitened time. 45 J. M.

Over the previous century, the library had shed its Renaissance image of a store-house of books and treasurechest of knowledge to become regarded as an institution equal in status to the learned societies and academies, colleges and universities, museums and laboratories which dotted the contemporary intellectual landscape. Its purpose was not only to serve as an archive of learning, but also to assist in the active dissemination of knowledge. The library had come to have rules, protocols and a cultural ethos all of its own. It was a place of social interaction, polite conversation and intellectual exchange. Libraries, even humble ones, were frequently hodgepodge collections not only of printed books but also of pamphlets, printed ephemera and manuscripts of all kinds; of sketches, woodcuts, engravings and paintings; of natural, ‘artificial’ and historical rarities. Books and objects were expensive, and a well-stocked library meant deep pockets on the part of institutions and patrons. Consequently the libraries of wealthy collectors and well-funded institutions could be ornate and even pompous affairs, meant to dazzle the beholder. But so too, libraries were hard-working tools of learning. Carefully catalogued and indexed, working libraries served contingents of scholars from a variety of intellectual backgrounds. What intellectual and cultural roles did the library play in the century preceding the foundation of the British Museum? How did libraries reflect and shape the world of learning of which they were part? Between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment the library was called upon to interact with a diffuse manuscript legacy, a print culture which frequently threatened to drown its 1 F. Bacon, ‘Proposition . . . touching the compiling an amendment of the Laws of England’, in J. Spedding (ed.), Works of Francis Bacon, vol. 13 (London, 1857), 67.\n\n23\n\nThe expansion of book collections 1640–1750\n\naudience, and a host of noisily competing intellectual communities.2 No wonder, then, that if anything unified discussion of the library in seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Britain, it was a loose appropriation of the greatest of early modern chameleons, Francis Bacon. Early modern observers of the library scene offered extended excursuses on the role of the library as an instrument of ‘the advancement of learning’. Three principal Baconian themes guided discussion of the relationship of libraries, books and learning: the importance of institutional support for the new programme of learning; the necessity of collaboration and communication between members of an intellectual community; and the need to catalogue and evaluate the fruits of learning both past and present. Ironically, libraries had found little favour with Bacon himself. Bacon looked agreeably enough upon texts as evidence of the ingenuity of the human mind. None the less in the Novum organum (1620) he remarked that, though the great variety of books in a library might be widely admired, eventually admiration would turn to astonishment at the poverty of subjects to which the human mind had been directed.3 Elsewhere Bacon opined that books found in a library ‘containeth (for the far greater part) nothing but iterations, varied sometimes in form, but not new in substance’. The devastating result was that ‘opinion of store was a cause of want’.4 The library in Bacon’s view symbolised the stagnant learning of the universities, the compilatory nature of Renaissance culture, and an intellectual ethos which privileged authority and admiration over impartiality and critical judgement. None the less, subsequent generations repeatedly looked to the library as a new Solomon’s House. Bacon himself had greeted the foundation of the Bodleian Library as ‘an Ark to save learning from deluge’.5 So too, one of the chief functions of the ‘Merchants of Light’ described in Bacon’s New 2 There is a sparse literature on the subject of library economy for the British Isles.

Bacon had demanded that the history of learning ‘recover out of the records what doctrines and arts flourished in which regions and ages of the world . . . The most distinguished authors and outstanding books should be noted, schools, successions, academies, societies, colleges, the orders, and finally everything else which bears upon the condition of learning.’7 Eventually, library catalogues, bibliographies, sale catalogues and periodicals all claimed to take part in this collaborative ‘history of learning’. Bacon’s iconic status as the founder of a new intellectual programme meant that discussion of books and libraries would evoke this Baconian ethos well into the eighteenth century. Disparate intellectual communities within British society repeatedly looked to the library as Bacon had not – as an institution for the advancement of learning and a centre of intellectual collaboration and exchange. The library’s most dramatic break with its Renaissance past came amidst the political tumult and intellectual sea change of the 1640s and 1650s. The period witnessed a number of projects and proposals for educational institutions and research colleges along Baconian lines. Several proposals for libraries were produced within the circle around Samuel Hartlib, a self-appointed ‘intelligencer’ or facilitator and promoter of knowledge.8 These schemes voice many of the usually unspoken assumptions about the role of the library. Hartlib himself was an avid collector of modern manuscripts of all sorts – he hotly pursued the remaining papers of Francis Bacon, for example.9 One plan by the young inventor William Petty is typical. Petty outlined a scheme for a college intended to address some of the lacunae in contemporary intellectual institutions which 6 F. Bacon, New Atlantis, in Works, vol. 1, 164. 7 Bacon’s account of historia litterarum is much longer and more detailed in the De augmentis scientiarum than it is in the Advancement. Cf. Bacon, Advancement, in Works, vol. 3, 330; De augmentis scientiarum, in Works, vol. 1, 503. 8 See in general C. Webster, The great instauration: science, medicine and reform 1 626–1 660 (London, 1975); G. H. Turnbull, Hartlib, Dury and Comenius: gleanings from Hartlib’s papers (London, 1947); M. Greengrass and others (eds.), Samuel Hartlib and universal reformation: studies in intellectual communication (Cambridge, 1994). 9 S. Clucas, ‘Samuel Hartlib’s Ephemerides, 1635–59, and the pursuit of scientific and philosophical manuscripts: the religious ethos of an intelligencer’, The Seventeenth Century 6 (1991), 33–55.\n\n25\n\nThe expansion of book collections 1640–1750\n\nBacon had noted in the Advancement of learning. Petty’s college included a Nosocomium Academicum, or scholarly hospice, which in turn embodied several other institutions, notably a botanical theatre, facilities for housing animals, birds and fish, a museum or ‘repository’ for natural and ancient rarities and mechanical curiosities, an anatomy theatre, an observatory and a chemical laboratory. The goal was to furnish an ‘Epitome or Abstract of the whole World’. Not surprisingly, a library was an essential part of the plan. Indeed, the entire plan was dependent upon a preliminary textual survey of the state of learning as a whole, redolent of Bacon’s plan for a ‘history of learning’. The idea was to shore up foundations for future knowledge by ascertaining ‘what is well and sufficiently done already’, and by ‘exploding whatsoever is nice, contentious, and merely fantastical; all which must in some Measure be suppressed’. Clear ‘Directions’ for reading would establish a common method. All books would be read separately by two readers in order to prevent mistakes and deviation from the ‘Directions’. ‘Real or Experimental Learning’ would be excerpted, and notes made on mechanical inventions. From this process one single book ‘or great Work’ was to be made. The final product would consist of several volumes, furnished with indices, tables and other finding aids – nothing short, in other words, of a fully digested library of human achievement.10 The communication of knowledge was as crucial as its accumulation. The library occupied a central place within Hartlib’s plan for an ‘Office of Address for Communication’, sketched in collaboration with John Dury. It envisaged a Warden ‘authorized to have and keep . . . all manner of Registers, Inventaries, Catalogues and Lists containing the Peculiar Objects wherof he should furnish Information for addresse to such as shall desire it’.11 The idea, plainly of Baconian inspiration, was to create a clearing-house for all kinds of practical and speculative knowledge for the general advancement of learning: the ‘Office of Communication should be made a Center and Meeting-place of Advices, of Proposalls, of Treaties and of all Manner of Intellectuall Rarities freely to bee given and received’. Among others, the Warden of the Office of Communication was to correspond ‘with the Chiefe Library-keepers of all 10 W. Petty, The advice of W. P. to Mr Samuel Hartlib, for the advancement of some particular parts of learning (London, 1648), reprinted in Harleian miscellany, vol. 6 (London, 1745), 1–13 (here, 3–5). On the general excerpting and epitomising tendencies of the period, see S. Clucas, ‘In search of “The true logick”: methodological eclecticism among the “Baconian reformers”’, in Greengrass, Samuel Hartlib, especially 64–8. In their institutional nature these excerpting programmes differ from those described by A. Moss, Printed commonplace-books and the structuring of renaissance thought (Oxford, 1996). 11 A brief discourse concerning the accomplishment of our Reformation (1647), in C. Webster (ed.), Samuel Hartlib and the advancement of learning (Cambridge, 1970), 131.\n\n26\n\nFrom Bacon to the Enlightenment\n\nplaces, whose proper employments should bee to Trade for the Advantages of Learning and Learned Men in Bookes, and M.S’.12 And what better location for the Office than Oxford? The main attraction was the Bodleian: its book resources, its status as a magnet for scholars, and the participation of its Keeper made it an ideal hub for the undertaking.13 It is no surprise, then, that when the position of Bodleian Librarian became vacant in 1652 Hartlib was urged to apply for the post.14 Hartlib’s aide-de-camp, John Dury, was keeper of books and medals of the Royal Library at St James’s Palace from 1650 to 1652. In 1650, Hartlib printed a memorandum by Dury on the role of the library as a centre of ‘intelligence’ – described by Hartlib as among ‘the fruits of som of my Solicitations and Negotiations for the advancement of Learning’. Dury’s methodological treatise, the Reformed librarie-keeper, embodies his lifelong ambition to bring about a general reformation of learning under a pan-Protestant banner. Librarians, Dury argued, should properly become ‘Agents for the advancement of universal Learning’. It was only thus that a library could be transformed from ‘a dead Bodie’ and become ‘animated with a publick Spirit . . . and ordered . . . for publick service’.15 Thus, the true end of a librarian ‘is to keep the publick stock of Learning, which is in Books and Manuscripts, to increas it, and to propose it to others in the waie which may bee most useful unto all’. One of the chief tasks of Dury’s librarian would be to enter into correspondence with ‘those that are eminent in everie Science’. It was thus that the ‘private stock of knowledge’ would be brought into the public domain. The library would become an entrepˆot for the traffic in knowledge: the librarian ‘should Trade with those that are at home and abroad’ in order ‘to multiplie the publick stock’ of learning, of which the librarian ‘is a Treasurer and Factor’.16 Once a year the librarian should be made to render an account ‘of his Trading and of his Profit in his Trade’ to a university committee comprised of leading scholars from each faculty.17 Dury’s target in all of this was of course the Bodleian, the most ‘considerable for the advancement of Learning, if rightly improved and Traded withal for the good of Scholars at home and abroad’.18 In England at mid-century, the library was envisaged as an active site of intellectual engagement. It occupied its rightful place alongside zoos and experimental farms, laboratories and museums. Indeed, the library could 12 Ibid., 132–3. 13 Ibid., 136. 14 Turnbull, Hartlib, Dury, 30; Webster, Great instauration, 205. 15 J.

Proposals for libraries and new institutions of learning were not restricted to the radical vanguard of the mid-seventeenth century.19 Just before the Restoration, the virtuoso John Evelyn had proposed a ‘college’ scheme for a research institution to Robert Boyle, which along with a laboratory, gardens, and a ‘repository for rarities and things of nature’ would also contain a library.20 Two years later, Abraham Cowley’s proposal for a ‘Philosophical Colledge’, long considered a possible blueprint for the Royal Society itself, described a ‘Librarie-keeper’ who also served as ‘Apothecary, Druggist, and keeper of Instruments, Engines, etc.’. Cowley’s library would be joined with a gallery of paintings or statues of ‘all the Inventors of any thing useful to Humane Life’.21 At Oxford, John Aubrey proposed a not dissimilar plan.22 Perhaps most akin to the pre-Restoration schemes, however, was an anonymous 1674 proposal for the reformation of the Royal Society which argued for the appointment of a ‘Curator for Books; whose business should be, to make a diligent search & particular collection, of all that is, or may hereafter be published, of the History of Nature or Art, by any person, at any time, in any Country of Language whatsoever’.23 Yet if ever England had a grand theorist of the library, it was John Evelyn.24 Evelyn had experienced the great libraries of Paris and Rome at first hand during his Grand Tour in the 1640s and those of Paris again during an extended stay in Paris from 1648 to 1652. The cultivation of learning and the cultured accumulation of books and other objects of study formed part of a distinct seventeenth-century ethos of nobility. More than any other figure of the second half of the seventeenth century, Evelyn most fully embodied the figure of 19 In general, see Webster, Great instauration, passim; P. Wood and M.

In 1661 he published an English translation of one of the most influential continental treatises on libraries and librarianship, the Advis pour dresser une biblioth`eque (1627) of Gabriel Naud´e. In the Advis, Naud´e had championed the idea of a universal library open to all, representing all disciplines of learning in all languages. Evelyn prefaced the Instructions with a dedication to Lord Clarendon, patron of the recently established Royal Society, in which he praised the Baconian principles of the new ‘philosophic assembly’. Though at first glance misdirected, Evelyn’s evocation of the Royal Society in a treatise on libraries was by no means inappropriate. Naud´e was an indefatigable supporter of the novatores in natural philosophy, and in the Instructions he repeatedly quoted Bacon in support of modern learning. Naud´e’s Baconianism is more than evident in Evelyn’s translation. Thus, any collector of books ‘who has not a design to devote and consecrate them to the publick use, or denies to communicate them to the least, who may reap any benefit thereby’ largely defeats the purpose of a library in the first place.25 And it was Naud´e who first considered the library the institution most suitable to undertake ‘what has been so long wished for’, Bacon’s history of learning. In the Instructions, Naud´e claimed that it was only a well-organised library which could furnish materials for ‘An ample and particular History, both of Letters and of Books; the Judgement and Censure of Authors, the Names of the best and most necessary in each Faculty; the Scourge of Plagiaries, the Progresse of the Sciences, the Diversity of Sects, the Revolutions of Arts and Disciplines’. Such a critical catalogue of intellectual endeavour could only be founded upon the sceptical principle of ‘the ignorance of all men’.26 Evelyn’s involvement with the early Royal Society was extensive. In 1667 Evelyn persuaded Henry Howard to donate the famous Arundel collection of books and manuscripts to the Royal Society when the Society temporarily moved into Arundel House following the Great Fire.27 It was in fact Evelyn in the Instructions who christened the Royal Society. Hitherto it had been called by its members simply a philosophic ‘club’ or ‘assembly’.28 Perhaps 25 G. Naud´e, Instructions concerning erecting of a library, trans. J. Evelyn (London, 1661), 87. On Naud´e’s appropriation of Bacon, see P. Nelles, ‘The library as an instrument of discovery: Gabriel Naud´e and the uses of history’, in D. R. Kelley (ed.), History and the disciplines: the reclassification of knowledge in early modern Europe (Rochester, NY, 1997), 41–57. 26 Naud´e, Instructions, 93–4. 27 M. B. Hall, The library and archives of the Royal Society 1 660–1 990 (London, 1992), 2–9; L. L. Peck, ‘Uncovering the Arundel Library at the Royal Society: changing meanings of science and the fate of the Norfolk donation’, Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London 52 (1998), 3–24. 28 Hunter, Establishing the new science, 16–17.\n\n29\n\nThe expansion of book collections 1640–1750\n\nmost significantly, it was from the Instructions that the Royal Society claimed its motto of ‘Nullius in verba’. The reference is to the Horatian epithet of intellectual independence quoted by Naud´e: ‘Nullius addictus jurare in verba Magistri/I am not bound to the dictates of any master.’ This too was unpacked amidst fine Baconian sentiments. The properly stocked library, when ‘received in[to] a spirit that is docile, universal, and disingag’d from all interests’, would render the individual able to ‘speak to the purpose upon all subjects’ and ‘cure the admiration which is a perfect signe of our weaknesse’.29 Evelyn’s translation of Naud´e’s treatise no doubt aimed to establish a working library for the Society. And Evelyn may have viewed the Society as an appropriate vehicle for installing a major public library in London on the continental model. It can hardly be doubted that Evelyn did not privately envisage the Royal Society’s design, ‘in no way beneath that of . . . Solomons House’, as containing a library, perhaps funded by the Society’s patron, Clarendon himself: ‘as your Lordship has design’d the Instruments (and may in time, the Materials)’.30 A library must have seemed essential for such an undertaking. From its inception the Society’s ‘Repository’ had included books together with natural curiosities and artefacts. None the less, historians have only recently begun to allocate books a significant role within the intellectual life of the early Society.31 Evelyn furnishes solid evidence that for many within the Society a functioning library was crucial. The same year Evelyn published his Instructions he drafted a subject classification scheme for the Society’s library, apparently at the request of its President, Robert Moray. A specialised plan intended to meet the scientific needs of the Society, Evelyn’s ‘Designe for a Library’ begins with dictionaries and reference works, moves on to natural philosophy (divided into physics and medicine, each further subdivided), the ‘Arts Liberall’ of arithmetic, geometry, optics and music, and then to the ‘Arts Illiberall and purely Mechanick’. The scheme concludes with ‘bookes treating of the universe’, books on household and rural economy, physical exercise, military techniques, pneumatics and magic. Even bearing in mind the Royal Society’s scientific remit, the absence of theology is striking. None the less, Evelyn’s scheme remains thoroughly hierarchical: the natural world has pride of place after propaedeutic works, and is subdivided according to ‘Men, Birds, 29 Naud´e, Instructions, 29. On Evelyn’s role in choosing a motto for the Royal Society, see Hunter, Establishing the new science, 17, 41–2; A. Johns, The nature of the book: print and knowledge in the making (Chicago, 1998), 478. 30 Evelyn, dedication to Clarendon, in Naud´e, Instructions, sig. a3r–a4v. 31 M. Hunter, ‘Between cabinet of curiosities and research collection: the history of the Royal Society’s “Repository”’, in his Establishing the new science, 123–55; cf. Johns, Nature of the book.\n\n30\n\nFrom Bacon to the Enlightenment\n\nBeasts, Fishes, Insects, Monsters, Stones, metalls Water Earth &c’.32 The plan vividly reflects the Society’s early preoccupation with practical knowledge and technical improvement. Not even treatises on magic were to be excluded, fully in keeping with the Instructions, where Naud´e had advocated collecting occult works of all kinds for whatever bits of useful knowledge they might contain.33 Evelyn’s scheme for the library of the Royal Society also reflects the widespread interest in Bacon’s proposal for a ‘History of Trades’. Evelyn himself had worked sporadically on such a compendium of technical knowledge since the early 1650s. In January 1661 he finally presented his ‘Circle of Mechanical Trades’ to a meeting of the Society.34 The theme is amply represented in his classification scheme for the library of the Royal Society. The library described in the Instructions had a broad mandate – it held collections not only of books, but also of globes and maps, prints and drawings, natural rarities and antiquities.35 In a postscript to Bodley’s Librarian, Thomas Barlow, Evelyn expressed the hope that the text would incite ‘the Gentleman of our Nation . . . to imitate those gallant and renon’d Genius’s’ such as Bodley, Cotton and others in England and Henri de Mesmes, Jacques-Auguste de Thou and the Dupuy brothers in Paris.36 For Evelyn, the ideal of the gentlemancollector was not restricted to books alone. This becomes more than evident when the Instructions is placed alongside Evelyn’s other publications of the period, notably his 1662 Sculptura, a history of engraving, and his translations of two works by the French author Roland Fr´eart, which appeared as A parallel of theancientarchitecturewiththemodern (1664) and Anideaoftheperfectionofpainting demonstrated (1668). Evelyn thus attempted to give expression to a programme of taste, judgement and knowledge which described the world of the collector and connoisseur of books, fine art and artefacts. When more than twenty years later Evelyn began to contemplate a second edition of the Instructions, he drafted two appendices of his own to render the work more complete – one on manuscripts and one on medals. ‘On manuscripts’ is undated, but was 32 Keynes, John Evelyn, 17–18; the plan is at Royal Society, CP, xvii, i. What appears to be an earlier version of the ‘Designe’ can be found among Evelyn’s papers in BL MS Add. 78344(4) d. 33 Naud´e, Instructions, 30; cf. Nelles, ‘The library as an instrument of discovery’, 50–1. 34 Hunter, ‘John Evelyn’, 74–84; cf. Keynes, John Evelyn, 116. See further K. Odis, ‘The Royal Society of London’s history of trades programme: an early episode in applied science’, Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London 39 (1985), 129–58. 35 On the nature and purpose of such collections, see P. Findlen, Possessing nature: museums, collecting, and scientific culture in early modern Italy (Berkeley, CA, 1994); O. Impey and A. MacGregor (eds.), The origins of museums: the cabinet of curiosities in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe (Oxford, 1985). 36 Naud´e, Instructions, 96.\n\n31\n\nThe expansion of book collections 1640–1750\n\nwritten at least after 1681: Jean Mabillon’s great palaeographical manual, De re diplomatica, which Evelyn recommends, was first printed in that year. Naud´e had stated in the Instructions that ‘it is the very Essence of a Library to have a great number of Manuscripts; because they are at present in most esteem, and less vulgar’.37 Evelyn hoped that his supplement to ‘what the learned Naudeus has publish’d’ on the topic ‘might neither be unacceptable or unwellcom to the Curious, and such as would inrich and addorne their Libraries with that which has ever been esteemed the most valuable and precious furniture’.38 Evelyn’s treatise on metals directly targeted ‘Gentlemen who are lovers of Books and Antiquities’.39 It eventually assumed a life of its own, and was published in 1694 as Numismata: a discourse of medals. Similarly, in his long letter of 1689 to Samuel Pepys, in which he surveys contemporary London libraries, Evelyn discusses books along with paintings, prints, medals, statues and inscriptions. Thus, a library was considered part of a wider collection of related objects. When Evelyn explained to Pepys that ‘men curious of books and antiquities have ever had medals in such estimation, and rendered them a most necessary furniture to their libraries’, he was clearly voicing a commonplace.40 The social exclusivity of the library type described by Evelyn might mask the aspirations of Evelyn and others for the library as a critical institution of the Republic of Letters. Evelyn remarked to Pepys that Paris alone had more libraries than existed in ‘all the three nations of Greate Britaine’, and complained bitterly that London ‘has scarce one library furnish’d and indow’d for the publiq’. This led Evelyn to propose establishing a public library ‘more communicative and better furnish’d with good books’ at St Paul’s. The library would house an academy devoted to the ‘Art and Improvement of speaking and writing well’, based on continental models such as the Accademia della Crusca in Florence and the Acad´emie Franc¸aise in Paris. Its aim was to promote the ‘noble and usefull conversation of learned gentlemen’.41 It is no wonder, then, that Evelyn was among the more avid supporters of Richard Bentley’s 1697 plan for a public library in London. More than a decade before he was attacked in Swift’s Battle of the books, Bentley had proposed a radical transformation of the Royal Library into a great public institution of learning on the continental model. As with Evelyn’s proposal for St Paul’s, it too would 37 Ibid., 53. 38 J. Evelyn, ‘On manuscripts’, in W. Bray (ed.), Memoirs, 2nd edn (London, 1819), vol. 2, 323. 39 Ibid., vol. 2, 324. Here and in several letters Evelyn mentions his work on medals as being a supplement to the Instructions; see Evelyn to Godolphin, 8 February 1697/8, in Diary and correspondence, vol. 4, 16. 40 Evelyn to Pepys, 12 August 1689, Diary and correspondence, vol. 3, 448–9. 41 Evelyn to Pepys, 12 August 1689, Diary and correspondence, vol. 3, 449, 454.\n\n32\n\nFrom Bacon to the Enlightenment\n\nserve as a meeting place for learned societies. ‘The Royal Society is a noble Instance in one Branch of Knowledge; what Advantage and Glory may accrue to the Nation, by such Assemblies not confined to one Subject, but free to all parts of good Learning.’42 Medals, inscriptions, antiquities and the like were thus essential for Bentley’s revamped Royal Library. It was clear to all that the library would most completely fulfil its purpose when it assumed its role within the public life of the Republic of Letters. The Enlightenment in Britain was a loose construction of social practices, institutional initiatives, and the description, analysis and communication of ideas and physical objects of all sorts. The question of how the library is implicated within the general configuration of Enlightenment culture deserves detailed study. The ideals of critical judgement and a unified system of knowledge acquired through vast reading were as recognisable intellectual ideals as the sen"
