He then travelled to Norway, hoping for recognition as King of the Isles. This attempt was unsuccessful. By 1255, King Henry III, King of England had secured a deal for Eóghan whereby he regained Lorne and came into full Scottish allegiance.\"\n\nIndependent kingdom (1333–1399)\n\nOn 9 August 1333 Edward III renounced all English claims over the Isle of Man, and recognised it as an independent kingdom under its then King, William Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury.\n\nRenunciation of claim to Mann by Edward III, 1333\n\nWilliam le Scrope was the last King of Mann in this line, claiming descent from the House of Godred Crovan, the earlier Norse Rulers.\n\nWilliam le Scrope was executed for treason for his support of Richard II in his struggle with Henry Bolingbroke, who defeated Richard and became Henry IV. Le Scrope's possessions, including the Isle of Man, passed to the Crown.\n\nWilliam I de Montacute (1333–1344)\n\nWilliam II de Montacute (1344–1392)\n\nWilliam le Scrope (1392–1399)\n\nEnglish suzerainty (1399–1504)\n\nAs Henry's predecessor, Edward III, had recognised Mann as an independent kingdom, Henry IV did not directly claim the Manx throne, but instead proclaimed that he had acquired the island by right of conquest, which in international legal theory at that time erased any existing constitutional arrangements. He then on 19 October 1399 granted the Island, as a fiefdom under the English Crown, to Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland together with wide-ranging powers of government and associated regalities, together with the style of 'Lord of Man', in a position of feudality and thus without sovereignty. Despite this, Percy styled himself as 'King of Mann'.\n\nHenry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland (1399–1405)\n\nJohn I Stanley (1405–1414)\n\nJohn II Stanley (1414–1437)\n\nThomas Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley (1437–1459)\n\nThomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby (1459–1504)\n\nLord of Mann (1504–present)\n\nThe son of Thomas Stanley, 2nd Earl of Derby, did not take the style 'King', and he and his successors were generally known instead as 'Lord of Mann'. However, the Latin style Rex Manniae et Insularum (King of Mann and the Isles) continued to be occasionally used in official documents until at least the 17th century.\n\nLords of Mann led as absentees for much if not most of their tenure.\n\nIn 1765 the title was revested in the Crown of the United Kingdom; thus today the title 'Lord of Mann' is used by Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nList of wives and consorts of the sovereign rulers of the Isle of Man.\n\nMost of these women used other titles that their husband held rather than Queen or Lady of Mann.

The High Bailiff is the head stipendiary magistrate.\n\nThe current High Bailiff is His Worship John Needham, who is not Manx nor qualified in the jurisdiction, who took office on 30 January 2010 on the retirement of Mr Michael Moyle. Mr Needham was previously Clerk to the Justices. The current Deputy High Bailiff is Her Worship Jayne Hughes.\n\nThe High Bailiff and his deputy are appointed by the Council of Ministers. The High Bailiff and Deputy High Bailiff are ex officio Judicial Officers of the High Court of Justice of the Isle of Man and Coroners of Inquests.\n\nOriginally there was a High Bailiff of each of the four towns of the Island, Castletown, Ramsey, Peel and Douglas. In 1911 the offices of High Bailiff of Castletown and Douglas, and the offices of High Bailiff of Peel and Ramsey, were merged. Those offices were merged in turn in 1933 to form a single office of High Bailiff of the Isle of Man.\n\nHigh Bailiffs of Castletown\n\nWilliam Callow, 1777-?\n\nRobert Kelly, 1811-?\n\nJohn Kelly, 1832–1854\n\nJames Gell, 1854–1866\n\nJohn Moore Jeffcott, 1866–1892\n\nSir James Gell, 1892–1911\n\nHigh Bailiffs of Douglas\n\nJohn Cosnahan, 1777–1808\n\nNorris Moore, 1808–1816\n\nJohn McHutchin, 1816–1819\n\nJames Quirk, 1820–1841\n\nJohn Courtney Bluett, ?-1855\n\nSenhouse Wilson, 1855–1864\n\nSamuel Harris, 1864–1905\n\nSir James Gell, 1905–1911\n\nHigh Bailiffs of Peel\n\nRobert Farrant, 1777–1794\n\nCaptain George Savage, 1794–1802\n\nThomas Clark, 1802–1807\n\nHugh Clucas, 1808–1817\n\nJames Quirk, 1817–1820\n\nJohn Llewellyn, 1820–1840\n\nRichard Harrison, 1840–1853\n\nRobert John Moore, 1853–1884\n\nA.N.
