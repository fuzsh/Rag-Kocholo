Brother Paulines, I commend to your charity this my eflfort to perpetuate the records of our School. In the year 1878 the present High Master suggested to me that it was desirable that the records of St. Paul's School should be published. After some consideration and with much diffidence I undertook to collect some materials for such a work, trusting that if our School could not again produce a Lcland, a Camden, or a Strype, there might yet be found a Gale, a Knight, or a Fosbrooke to whose antiquarian zeal and learned leisure I might commit my collections. It was thought however that the approaching crisis in our School's history would justify the publication of its records, and so I venture to intrust to your kindness the results of my work, undertaken in the leisure of a Schoolmaster. I am sensible that another ten years* labour would still have left the work imperfect, but I hope that the interest of the present juncture will excuse its production. Originally it was only intended to publish the Captains' Kegisters (1806 â€” 1876) preserved in the School Library : to these after some consideration I resolved to prefix the Register of Names, dating from 1751, collected by Dr. Kynaston from the Presentations ; together wdth viii PREFACE. the names of such earlier Paulines as were found in Knight's lAfe of Colet and other works. The work was almost completed in this fonn when, by the kindness of the Mercers' Company, I obtained access to the Kecords of Admissions preserved in com- pleteness at their Hall from 1748. This obliged me to rewrite the work from 1748 to 1806, and shortly after- wards I received information from other books in their possession, from which I collected the greater part of the facts which fill the first eighty pages of this book : my previous notes therefore on early Paulines had to be fitted in to this new matter. Let this rewriting be pleaded as an excuse for any inconsistencies which may be discovered between the earlier and later portions of the work. In compiUng the notes I have asked for help far and wide, and I beg to tender my thanks to all who have kindly furnished me with information. Above all, my thanks are due to the Court of the Mercers' Company, not only for their permission to use their Kecords, but also for the generosity which enabled me to send the book to the press, and which embellished it with its frontispiece. My thanks are also due to the present High Master for the interest which he has taken in the work, and the encouragement which he has given me to persevere in it ; to the Rev. J. H. Lupton, Surmaster, not only for contributing one of the Appendices from his store of Coletine learning, but also for his kindness in reading proofs and suggesting sources of information ; to John Watney, Esq., Clerk to the Mercers^ Company, for assisting me in one of the Appendices, and for his unfailing readiness to help me in all matters of detail ; to the authorities of the British Museum, to whose care PREFACE. ix I was committed by J. Winter Jones, Esq. (O.P.), late principal Librarian, especially Edward Scott, Esq., Dorset EccLES, Esq. (O.P.), and Freeman Donoghue, Esq. ; to the Bursars and Librarians of the Colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, who have been most kind in furnishing in- formation, especially W. Aldis Wright, Esq., Bursar of Trinity College, Cambridge, to whose labours I owe the list of Perry Exhibitioners; to Sir Albert Woods, Garter King-at-Arms ; to J. E. Gardner, Esq., and Rev. C. J. Robinson, the Editor of the Merchant Taylors' Registers. To these I must add the names of R. Harris, Esq., whose drawing of the exterior of the School is here re- produced ; Samuel A. Walker, Esq. (O.P.), who presented his photographs to the work; and John B. Chubb, Esq., who assisted me in the plans upon which the Appendix on the Site and Buildings is based ; the printing and publication of the work have also been kindly under- taken by Old Paulines. To conclude, while I regret the scantiness of our early records, I hope that I have collected sufl&cient to show how Colet's scholars have endeavoured to fulfil their daily prayer \" ut bene pieque eruditi Ecclesiae et Rei- publicsB tandem utiles evadamus,\" and venture to express my belief that the generation of Paulines among whom this work is published will find in it a reason for strenuous effort to maintain the glory of their School, and while cheerfully accepting in the true spirit of their Founder such changes as are demanded in a course of nearly four centuries, will take care that there shall be no break in its career of producing \"men qualified to serve God in Church and State.\" ROBERT B. GARDINER. St. Paul's School, Jpril, 1884. PLAN OF THE WOKK. After the Introduction and the Fasti, the work is divided into Sections, according to thie reign of each High Master. The name of the High Master is followed by that of his Surmasters and other Assistants : then come the names of his reputed scholars. These are arranged as far as possible in chronological order, their position being determined more or less conjecturally from the date of birth or of admission to the University. Thus up to the year 1748 each High Master is credited with the boys who left the School under his Mastership, but from the commencement of the Registers he is credited with the boys whom he admitted. Several times it has been necessary to insert lists of the names of those who are known to have been at the School before a certain period, but as to whose exact date it has been impossible to obtain a clue. The names also of pupils who are known to have been at the School under a certain High Master, but whose relative date is uncertain, will be found at the end of his reign. Note that curious instances of mis-spelling have been generally preserved, such as Bayliall (Balliol), Woodham (Wadham), Polls (Paul's), but ordinary errors have been corrected without notice. I desire to call particular attention to the use which I have made of two MSS. at the British Museum. (1) Additional 5885. A tran- script of the list of all the Bachelors of Arts graduated at Cambridge from A.D. 1500 to A.D. 1716, in the collection of Mr. Cole. (2) Ad- ditional 19209 and 19210.

The School Arms are blazoned â€” sable, on a chevron between three hinds trippant argent as many annulets of the first, for Colet â€” whence the School colours, sable and argent or black and white.

About the close of the reign of Henry VII., John Colet, Dean of St Paul's, son of Sir Henry Colet, citizen and mercer, twice Lord Mayor of London, commenced the work of educational reform in England by establishing a school in London, which, although originally founded in honour of \" Christ Jesu in puerida, and of his blessyd Mother Mary,\" soon became known (probably from the situation of its buildings) as St. Paul's School. Colet, during his travels abroad, had perceived the importance of the Revival of Learning, and desired to equip the children of his own country to take their place by the side of the learned men of other nations. He declared in his Statutes (see Appendix B.) that he founded the School \" for the children of all nacions and countres indiflferently,\" and that his intent was \"to increase knowledge and worshipping of God and our Lorde Crist Jesu, and good Cristen lyfe and manors,\" a purpose which he hoped to effect by encouraging the study of Greek (up to his time not taught in England), and of clean and chaste Latin, in contrast to the depraved Latin of the Schoolmen. \" All the educational designs of the Reformers of Learning were carried out in the new institution. The old methods of instruction were superseded by fresh grammars composed by Erasmus and other scholars for its use. Lily, an Oxford student, who had studied Greek in the East, was placed at its head. Not only did the study of Greek creep gradually into the schools which existed, but the example of Colet was followed by a crowd of imitators. More grammar schools, it has been said, were founded in the latter years of Henry VIII. than in the three centuries before. The grammar schools of Edward VI. and of Elizabeth, in a word, the system of middle class education, which by the close of the century had changed the very face of England, were the direct results of Colet's foundation of St. Paul's.\"^ 4- * Green's Stuyiii History of the English Patjiile. INTRODUCTION. THE BUILDINGS. He placed his school on the site apparently of an older school at the east end of St. Paul's Cathedral. In those days the Cathedral, a magnificent structure in the Gothic style, stood within a walled and gated inclosure : the busy traffic which now circles round the Churchyard, passed through Old Change on the east. Carter Lane on the south, Pater Noster Row on the north, and Creed Lane and Ave Maria Lane on the west. We know but little of Colet's BuildiDg, which was finished in 1510, except that Strype, who was educated in the first and lived to see the second building, tells us, that after the Fire the School \" was built up again much after the same manner and proportion it was before, together with the library and an house on the south end thereof for the Second Master, whose dwelling before and from the first founding of the School was in the Old Change adjoining to the said School.\" The original building consisted of four pai-ts (as described by Erasmus), the first or porch for catechumens ; a great schoolroom divided by a curtain ; and a little chapel for divine service, together with chambers for the High Master and Surmaster. This building perished in the Fire of London (1666), and was shortly replaced by another, which stood within the memory of living Paulines. It consisted of a large schoolroom with a flat roof, and at the end was a room (described as small and dark) which served as a library. There was also a house at each end, that on the north for the High Master, that on the south for the Surmaster, while the Chaplain (or Usher) was provided with a house in Old Change. The rearrangement of thoroughfares, which brought the stream of traffic from east to west down Cheapside through the Churchyard to Ludgate Hill, materially interfered with the quiet and seclusion of the School. The building of 1670, in spite of various repairs, was found to be in a dangerous condition in 1814; and on the occasion of the visit of the Allied Sovereigns U> the city, its roof was supported with shores which were not subse- quently removed till about 1823, when the Mercers* Company, having acquired some additional ground to the North, proceeded to pull down the old buildings and set up the present ones, con- sisting of a large schoolroom over a cloister with two houses at either end, whereby the Fourth Master, who had been added to the teaching staff some twenty years before, and had hitherto had INTRODUCTION. an allowance for a house, acquired an official residence. The whole School continued to be taught in one room till 1854, when Dr. Kynaston, the High Master, who had long ceased to take boarders, gave up to the School the boarding-rooms of his house, whereby the size of the Library was doubled, so that it could be used as the High Master's Class Boom, and the Upper Class Room was brought into use for the Fifth and Sixth Classes, then taught by the Surmaster; subsequently also the Lower Class Room was occupied by the Third Master, THE GOVERNORS. Colet wisely intrusted the management of his new foundation to the Mercers' Company, of which his father had been a member : and under their care his school survived the storm of the Reformation, which swept away so many endowments. For more than three centuries and a half, under their careful and judicious government, the School continued to fulfil the purpose of its founder, supplying men, as this work I hope will prove, qualified to serve God in Church and State. By the careful management of its property its income \\yas raised to Â£10,000 a year. In accordance with the Founder's Statutes the Mercers appointed annually two Surveyors â€” the Surveyor Accountant (who of late years was usually the outgoing Master of the Company) and the Surveyor Assistant (the Master of the Company for the year) â€” to manage the affairs of the School But on the 24th of March, 1876, a new scheme, made by the Endowed Schools Commissioners (1869), received her Majesty's sanction, whereby although the management of the estates remains with the Mercers the government of the School is transfen-ed to a body of twenty- two Governors, of whom the Mercers appoint nine, together with their Master and three Wardens for the year, and the remaining nine are appointed equally by the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and London, This arrangement seems to carry out Colet's wish expressed in the statutes that \" the Wardens and assistences of the felowshipp of the Mercers may adde and diminish into his boke and supply in it every defaute with suych other counsel as they shall call unto theme, good litterid and lemyd menne\" (see Appendix B.). u 2 INTRODUCTION. THE MASTERS. Colet provided that his scholars should be taught by two masters, the High Master and the Surmaster: he also desired that they should employ the assistance of the Chaplain, if he were found qualified. This arrangement appears to have held good for nearly three hundred years, the High Master teaching the Upper Classes while the Surmaster, assisted by the Chaplain (or Usher), took charge of the younger boys. In the time of Thicknesse and the early part of Roberts' High Mastership, about one half of the School was under the Chaplain in the First and Second Classes; another quarter under the Surmaster in the Third and Fourth; while the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Classes, under the High Master, were barely a quarter of the School. At length, however, under Dr. Roberts, a more even distribution was made, and he obtained the services of an Assistant or Fourth Master, who relieved him of the Fifth and Sixth Classes. This arrangement lasted till 1854, when, on the death of Mr. Roberts the Fourth Master, Mr. Carver, the then Surmaster, took over the Fifth and Sixth, the new Fourth Master, Mr. Hudson, taking the Third and Fourth : and when, on the resignation of Mr. Cooper, Mr. Hudson became Third Master (Chaplain or Usher), he retained charge of his Classes, the new Fourth Master taking the First and Second Classes. THE STUDIES. Colet founded his School to give instruction in Latin and Greek; and except that Writing and Arithmetic appear to have been taught to some selected boys during the eighteenth century, nothing beyond Latin, Greek, and Hebrew was taught in the School for over three hundred years. Soon after the appointment of Dr. Kynaston (1838) an Arithmetic and Mathematical Master was for the first time added to the Staff, and about 1853 French was introduced as a subject of study. Hebrew was taught in the School by Langley (1640-57) ; and Strype, writing after the Fire, speaks of the boys as then instructed in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and sometimes other Oriental languages. Pepys heard the \" head Forms posed in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew\" in 1662; and in 1710 Hebrew was among the subjects offered at the Apposition by the Seventh and Eighth Classes. INTRODUCTION. THE SCHOLARS. Colet offered his scholars a higher education than any which existed in his day; no child was to be admitted who could not read and write ; and none were to be retained in the School but such as were likely to make progress. It seems, then, that Colet, while welcoming the poor scholar to his school, expected his foundation to be used by the upper class of citizens. By the children of these the School was mainly occupied till men ceased to reside in the neighbourhood of the School. There have at times been non- foundationers admitted, and the reputation of some of the High Masters, notably Gale (1672-1697), attracted boarders other than the sons of citizens. In 1748,' when the Registers begin, the School appears to have been going down under the High Mastership of Dr. Charles (1737-1748), for Mr. Thicknesse (in whose first year of office it rapidly filled again), reports that only thirty-eight boys were on the foundation a few months after his appointment. This may have been owing to some financial cVfficulties under which the Mercers' Company (and with them the School) appear to have been suffering at that time, which are described at large in the Report of the Commissioners of Endowed Charities (1820). The head boy in each class was called the Captain; the head of the Eighth Class was the Captain of the School; â€” this post was usually held for a year, and the subjoined list of Captains will be found a roll of not undistinguished names (see Appendix D.). From the earliest times (1564) boys who reached the top of the School were sent to the Universities by the liberality of the Governors, and after a time in addition to these (who are called Pauline Exhibitioners in the following pages) others were sent to Trinity College, Cambridge, by the liberality of Viscount Campden, whose benefaction, dating in 1629, now produces Â£1,000 a year. These latter are called Campden Exhibitioners; the suc- cessive phases in the management of this endowment will be found in Appendix E. 2. Other exhibitions were subsequently founded in Cambridge, at Trinity and Corpus Christi Colleges, which will also be found described in the Appendix (E. 4, 6, 7). The present century witnessed the institution of the prizes for Composition known as Governors* Prizes, to which several endowments have been added in the last thirty years. INTRODUCTION. THE RECOEDS. It only remains to explain the authorities from whence this book is drawn. The early part is simply a compilation from various sources, such as the Accounts of the School and the Acts of Court preserved among the archives of the Mercers' Company, and the lists of exhibitioners (Campden, Perry, Sykes, &c.), to which has been added information collected from works in which St. Pauls School is alluded to or described. The lists from 1748 to 1806 are printed from the Registers of the Admissions of Scholars, which are preserved at Mercers' Hall and have been kindly placed at my disposal by the Court. From 1806 to 187& a record of admissions was kept by the Captain in the School Library : and from this my lists are printed; the Christian names of the parents which the Captain did not record, being added from the Mercers' Hall Registers. There does exist in the School Library a very imperfect record of admissions from 1751 to 1806, but it was made by the late Dr. Eynaston from the volumes of presentations which exist in the library, and is of no independent authority. It is much to be regretted that the registers mentioned in the Fasti under dates 1524 and 1712 have not been discovered. FASTI OF ST. PAUL'S SCHOOL. >} Â» if 91 >t Â» 1508.

The \" articles \" or terms on which the Exhibitions were to be held, drawn up by the Bishop of London (Edmund Grindall), were laid before the Court of the Company, July 26th, 1564. The first Exhibitioner was elected on September 26th. The Exhibitions were fixed, to be of the value of Â£5 per annum, January 9th, 1565 (Appendix F. 1). 1572. The Company obtained judgment (which was entered in the Exchequer in Trinity Term, Anno. EUz. 15) against Mr. Knevet who had laid an information against them for \"concealed chauntery lands\" (i.e. Colet's endowment for a chaplain), but who failed in his \" profes \" : nevertheless by the mediation of Sir Walter Mildmay and others, \" out of their meere liberalitye,\" they gave Mr. Knevet 10 FASTI OF ST.

In 1579â€”80, the Company again entered an appearance in the Exchequer on the same complaint ; and in 1580, a fine of Â£300 was recorded against the Company for the same matter; but it does not appear to have been paid out of St. Paul's School funds, though there are further entries on the same subject in 1582-83 (a.). 1573.

It was agreed between the De?in and Chapter of St. Paul's and Jesus College, Cambridge, that two of the Scholars on the foundation of Dr. Reston should be nominated by the Dean and Chapter, the Candidates to be chosen from St. Paul's School, or, in defect, from any other School. 1575. Oct. 29 â€” The morrow after Simon and Jude, Mr. Malym's Scholar made an oration on a ^'skaffolde\" set up at Paul's School, when Mr. Ambrose Nicholas, then Lord Mayor, returned from Westminster (a.). 1575-6. A grant is made to John Meeke, chief bellringer of PawlesÂ» towards his paines in bringing to light an old \" pervy of easement\" {ie. privy) \"that some time longede to the Children of Pawles Scheie,* and also for the easement of all inhabitants thereabouts.\" From subsequent entries it seems that Meeke became involved in a lawsuit with Abraham Vele,^ bookbinder, who had taken the said \" pervy\" into his shop, and in 1577-8 Meeke received a further grant, but it does not appear whether he was successful in his suit. 1578. William Malym delivers an oration (in Latin) to Duke John Casimir. 1579.

(CJhurton's Life of Nowel, page 190), 1585-6. The copy of the Statutes,^ now preserved at Mercers' Hall, was rebound, as appears by these entries : â€” â€ž Paid \"for a cover of vellom for Mr. CoUette's book of ordenaunce wherein his own handwriting is : the said Mr. CoUette's picture is now newly made on the outside, and for stringe of silk and for binding the same, 6Â«.\" â€ž Paid to Segar '* for drawing the picture of Mr. Dr. CoUette upon the cover of vellom of the book of ordenance very fair in cullers, 40s.\" 1588-9. \"The tenement at the end of Poules Church (see under 1572-3) has now been converted into a house for the Under Usher ^ in the following year this house was beaten down with the fall of a stone (\" a pynnakell \") from Poull's Church by the great wynd (A.).^ 1592.

In the accounts of 1666-7 a quarter or half-year's Exhibition only is paid to each Exhibitioner, and all Exhibitions cease till Lady Day, 1678-9. 1666-70.

LIST OF MASTERS AND SCHOLARS. 1512â€”1622 Master* WILLIAM LILT. Bom at OdyhaiD, Hants, circa 1466 ; Demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, 1486, B. A. ; visited Jerusalem and made some stay in Rhodes where he acquired the Greek tongue, thence visited Home ; returned to England and settled in London where he taught Grammar, Poetry, and Rhetoiic ; selected by Colet as first High Master ; died 1522. He was the joint author of a Latin Grammar {Brevissima InstUutio) which remained the basis of all Latin grammars in use till the present generation. He is probably identical with William Lily, Vicar of Holcote, Northampton, 1492-95. Surmaster 1512 Thomas Percy, otherwise Persy. Sumiaster 1515 Maurice Birchinshaw. Called Master Morris in the \"Accounts.\" \"In 1511 (December 11th) M. B., a scholar of the faculty of Rhetoric, was admitted (at Oxford) to inform in the faculty of Grammar. He taught in the School adjoining Magdalen College great gate. In 1515, July 2, M. B. the celebrated grammarian was admitted B.C.L. He was afterwards Prebendary of Wells\" (A.O.). Possibly he was Mauritius to whom Constable addresses the following epigram : â€” Nunc scio, Maurici, placuit tibi culta vetustas Quod delegisti fertile gymnasium. Nempe virum expectat te clara Britannia talem QualiB erat RomsB Tullius ipse suee. Sumiaster 1517 John Bitwise. Subsequently High Master 1522â€”1532 (which see). Chaplain. There is no record of any payment to a chaplain till 1528-24. Probably these dutiss were supplied under the immediate direction of the Founder up to that time. * A complete list of the High Masters and Sub (Sur) Masters, from 1512 tol637, is found appended to one of the copies of Colet's statutes preserved at Mercers Hall. Whenever a change in the tenant of either oÂ£Bc8 occurs, the name of the tenant of the other is usually repeated. ThuÂ»â€” 1512. WiUm Lilie, high Mr. placed by yÂ« Founder.

Possibly this is the copy of the Statutes for writing which Mulcaster was paid Ss, Ad. in 1598-99. As I have discovered no notice at Mercers* Hall of the appointment of Masters for the School before 1522, I am inclined to think that the first three Sur- masters were appointed by the Founder. 18 SCHOLARS OF ST. PAUL'S SCHOOL. [1512-22 SCHOLARS. Thomas Lupset, Son of William Liipsei, goldsmith of London ; bom about 1495 ; said to bare been supported by Colet (bo whom he is said to have acted as amanuensis) at PembroKe Hall, Cambridge ; accompanied Kichard Paice on his embassy to Venice, 1515 ; took his B.A. at Paris ; and returning to England, 1519, settled at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he read the Rhetoric and Humanity lecture founded by Wolsey. In 1621 he was admitted M.A. of Oxford, and read Wolsey's Greek lecture. In 1523 he was admitted to the Chapel of St. Nicholas, in the parish of Stanford-le-hope, Essex. The same year he was at Padua with Pole (afterwards Cardinal), whose acquaintance he had made in 1515. Rector of Great Mongeham, Kent, 1526, and also of St. Martin, Ludgate ; Rector of Cheriton, Hants, 1530 ; and Prebendary of Ruscombe (Sarum). He died of consumption in 1580, and was buried at St. Alphege, London Wall. He was the author of EpistoloB varicB, Basle, 1520 ; A trecUise of ChariUf London, 1529. Two works of his were posthumously printed, An exhortation to yonge Tnen, perswavdynge them to toalk in the pcUhe vxiy that leadeth to honestye and goodnes, written to a frende of his, by Thomas Lupaete, Londoner, London, 1530, and A compendious and a very fnUeful treatise tectehing the way of Dyeing well, London, 1534. Edward North, Bom in 1496 ; son of Roger, citizen and mercer of London ; proceeded to Peter* house, Cambridge, but did not graduate ; studied the law and became one of the King's Seijeants in 1537. Henceforth till the accession of Elizabeth, he plays an important part in the history of England. He was summoned to Parliament as Baron North of Kirtling, in 1554 ; died 1564. He is reckoned as a Benefactor by the University of Cambridge and by Peterhouse. He was ancestor of the present Baroness North and the Earl of Guilford. Anthony Denny, Bom 1500-1 ; entered St. John's College, Cambridge ; became a gentleman of the V-edchamber to Henir YIII. and finally King's Remembrancer and Groom of the Stole ; was knighted before 1546 ; was one of the executors of the king's will ; died 1550. He was a great benefactor of the School of Sedbergh, York. William Paget, Son of a Serieant-at-Mace in London ; said to have gone to Trinity Hall, but apparently did not graduate ; entered the household of Gardiner, afterwards Bishop of Winchester ; went thence to the University of Paris. In 1 532 he entered the service of king Henry VIII., under whom he held various offices and was appointed one of the executors of the king's will. During the reign of Edward VI. he attached himself first to the side of Somerset, and on his fall to that of Northumberland. He was made K.G. in 1546-47, and called to the House of Lords as Baron Paget of Beaudesert in 1551. He was on the Priv^- Council of Queen Jane, but was one of the first to welcome Queen Mary's accession. He retired from public life on the accession of Queen Elizabeth, and died in 1563. His monument was erected in Lichfield Cathedral. He was High Steward of the University of Cambridge in 1546 and again in 1554. He filled one of the foremost places in the history of Â£ngland for nearly twenty years : his descendant is now Marquess of Anglesey. John Leland, otherwise Leyland, Bom in London about 1506 ; graduated B.A. (Lelond) at Christ's CoIleg(e, Cambridge, 1522, whence he removed to All Souls' College, Oxford; was sent to Paris with an exhibition by Henry VIII. where he acquired the friendship of Budsus and other famous men of the time. In 1530 he was admitted Rector of Poppeling in the Marches of Calais, but serving the King as Librarian had licence for non-residence. In 1533 he was appointed King's Antiquarian. For six years he travelled over England pursuing ms researches, and in 1546 presented the King with a scheme of ms great work under the title of a New Year's gift. In 1542 he became Rector of Haseley, Oxon. ; and in 1543 he was made a Canon of King's College, Oxford, (now Christ Church) ; he was also Prebendary of Sarum, an appointment which he perhaps received in exchange for his Canoniy. In 1550 he lost his reason, and djring in 1552 was buried in the church of St. Michael le Quern. His works were not published in his lifetime, but his MSS. are mostly preserved at Oxford. His Commentarii de Scriptoribus Britannicis was edited in 1709 by Anthony Hall ; his Itinerary in 1710, &c., by Thomas Heame ; his Collectanea de rebus Britannicis in 1715 by Heame. 1512-22] SCHOLARS OF ST. PAUL'S SCHOOL. 19 John Clement, He was taken from St. Paul's School by Sir Thomas More. He read Wolsey's Rhetoric Lecture at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, 1519 ; and also his Greek Lecture, \" being singularly seen in the Greek tongue.\" He became tutor to Margaret More (Koper). Being opposed to the Keformation, he retired abroad during the reign of Edward VI., and though he returned to England in the reign of Mary, he exiled himself again after the accession of Elizabeth, and died at Mechlin, in Brabant, 1572. He was a member of the College of Physicians : see his character in More's Epistle to Peter Giles in the Utopia. Robert Pursglove, Alias Sylvester, a native of Tideswell, in Derbyshire, was maintained by his uncle, William Bradshaw, at St. Paul's School for nine years ; from thence he went to St. Mary Overies and subsequently to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he remained fourteen years ; thence he became Prior of Guisborough, York, which post he resigned on the dissolution of the monasteries in 1540. He was subsequently Suffragan Bishop of Hull and died in 1579, being buried at Tideswell, where his epitaph exists on a brass. He founded in 1560 a free grammar school at Tideswell ; and at Guisborough he founded the Jesus School and also almshouses for six men and six women in 1561. Richardus Vernamus, Pauline Schols alumnus. Author of an epigram printed at the end of Rudimenta QraimTuUices â€” Quisquis adest Latiam cupiens contexere linguam Nostraque dulciloquis verba referre modis Hunc emat, hunc tenero perstringat corde libellum Pollice queui facili Lilius ediderat.

George Frauncs, It appears from the Privy Purse Expenses of Henry VI II. that in 1681 and 1532 payments were made to the School Master of Powles for G. F. the King's Scholar, and in July of 1532 \" for the Exhibucion of G. F.\" Nicholas Frauncs, Also in September and December of 1532 payments were made for N. F. ^ It is from this entry that I proceed to infer that the similar payments made in 1531 and 1532 to the \"School Master of Powles,\" were made for boys at Colet's School, rather than at the Cathedral School, the very existence of which as a place of good education at this date 8i>ems to require further demonstravion. And if it be granted that Colet's Foundation is meant by ** Powles School\" in 1531, (as it certainly was in 1527,) I venture to claim as Paulines, Harrison's \"Children of Pawles School\" (1544), Stow's \"Children of S. Pauls School\" (1554), and Nowel's \"Scholars of Poiill's Scholle\" (1569 and 1573). Â« The title of \"Sir\" (Dominus) was commonly given to the clergy (possibly especially to Chantry Priests) before the Keformalion.

In going through the Accounts I found it stated in two instances at least that the Exhibitioner had been educated at Mercers' Chapel School ; two more had been educated at Horsham School, which was also under the govern- ment of the Mercers. 1 was at firat inclined to assume that where no school was stated they came from St. Paul's School, but several of them are claimed by Merchant Taylors' School, as will be noticed hereafter (see 1596 and 1597).
