My greatest debt is to V. A. C. Gatrell, who supervised the thesis on which this book is based, and whose inspired teaching first awakened my interest in the history of legal matters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. I have greatly enjoyed his good will and intellectual companionship since my undergraduate days. I have also benefited greatly from the comments of several other people who read parts of the work, and supplied me with useful comment and criticism. In particular, Nigel Simmonds’ generous and incisive criticism encouraged me to think about many jurisprudential arguments in new light. David Sugarman also read parts of the original thesis, and provided me with very valuable advice and ideas not only on particular points, but on the approach to writing legal history as a whole. Tim Hochstrasser’s comments and conversation, over a number of years, have always been enlightening and insightful and I have learned much from his perspectives. I am grateful also to my examiners, Professors J. H. Burns and Peter Stein, who made a number of helpful suggestions and encouraged me to develop the arguments in the thesis, and to Professor Brian Simpson for his comments on the manuscript and for alerting me to numerous errors. While I have been saved from many follies by these people, and others, it is perhaps too much for me to hope, in as wide-ranging a study as this, that I have expunged them\n\nall; and\n\nfor the errors\n\nthat remain\n\nI must\n\nclaim\n\nfull and\n\nexclusive responsibility. This book has been written at a time when there has been a flourishing interest in the history of law and society, and in particular the intellectual history of law. It will be apparent to the reader how much I have benefited from much of the scholarship that has grown out of much of this recent work. In particular, I have gained a great deal from the scholarship and ideas of David\n\nvi\n\nPreface\n\nLieberman and Gerald Postema, both of whom have mapped out new areas for exploration in the history of jurisprudence. It is my hope to add to this scholarship by concentrating more on the drier, pettifogging aspects of law; an approach which has its risks, but also, I hope, its rewards. Much of this work would not have been possible without the efforts of the Bentham Project at University College, London, and the scholars associated with them, who have,\n\nover a number of years, made Bentham seem a much more complex and sophisticated thinker than his early published works suggested and who have widened the access to this Bentham by making sense of his often cryptic manuscripts. Material contained in Chapter 2 of this book appeared in an article on ‘Blackstone and the Science of Law’ in the Historical Journal in\n\n1987 and I am grateful to the editors for permitting me to reproduce the material here. I have been fortunate in being able to work on this project in the most congenial of environments, first as a graduate student at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and latterly at St John’s College, Oxford. I am particularly grateful to the President and Fellows of St John’s for electing me to a junior research fellowship which has enabled me to complete the work. I have benefited from the assistance of helpful and efficient librarians at the Cambridge University Library and the Squire Law Library, the Bodleian Library, the British Library, and the D. M. S. Watson Library of University College, London. Finally, I am delighted to record my gratitude for the constant support and intellectual stimulation, in other equally congenial environments, of my parents and the rest of my family. I would like to dedicate this book to them, and to the memory of my grandmother, who did not live to see its completion, but whose patient encouragement helped make it possible. ML.

It seeks to address the question of what the common law was about, and how theorists and practitioners conceived it, in such a way as to make historians more sensitive to the legal framework. This is not therefore a history of any particular doctrine or area of law, but a discussion of the legal framework. When historians discuss the common law, they tend to portray it as a body of principles and rules that can be distinctly articulated and defined. The standard view of the eighteenth-century common law is perhaps that one taken by Morton Horwitz, which describes the preindustrial common law as being a fixed body of doctrine, based on natural law and inflexible rules, which sought to provide fair solutions.’ Similarly, P. S. Atiyah has written that ‘[t]he law, to most people of the eighteenth century, including the lawyers, had, in its essentials, a sanctity and an unchangeability’.2 The common law is thus widely understood to have been seen as inflexible and unchanging, the guarantor of fairness and justice, its perfect reason guaranteed in its immemoriality. Flexibility, at least in theory, was to be found in equity, which abated the rigours of the fixed common law; yet by the 1770s, equity itself had largely hardened into a precedent-based system, and precedent-minded common lawyers were seeking to restrict equitable conceptions of the common law.? If the law moved and grew, it was in a Burkean way, adding on to a sturdy and solid ancient structure. At any rate, the common law was ! Morton J. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law (London, 1977), ch. 1. 2 The Rise and Fall of Freedom of Contract (Oxford, 1979), 97. He adds, ‘Law could not\n\njust be manipulated, and made out of nothing, as it were, to suit the passing fancies of a political party, a King or even a Parliament; it was “there,” it had an objective\n\nexistence of some sort; in its essentials it was unchanged and binding on everyone.’ 3 David Lieberman, The Province of Legislation Determined: Legal Theory in Eighteenth Century Britain (Cambridge, 1989), 122-43.\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nnot a tool of policy, nor a system to promote any short-term goal: for\n\nit was based on natural law, with judges finding the single correct solution to legal problems. It is not surprising that historians have so characterized the law, as a source-based system of positive rules, for by the eighteenth century, most jurists discussing the nature of law discussed it in this way. First of all, they described the common law as a set of rules and guides to conduct. ‘A Law’, wrote Thomas Rutherforth, ‘is a rule to which men are obliged to make their moral actions conformable.” Law was seen increasingly as a distinct entity, but one issuing guides to conduct. Ephraim Chambers’s Cyclopaedia defined law as ‘a command, or precept, coming from some superior authority, which an inferior is obliged to obey’.° This view stressed the legislative nature of law above its adjudicative side. ‘[T]he power of all law is from the express, and that of customs from the supposed, will of the\n\nlegislator,’ wrote John Taylor in 1755.° This view had a pedigree, for Hale had written of some customs which were now taken as being immemorial, but which had originally been acts of parliament.’ His editor, Charles Runnington, could add, more positively, that common law and statutes came originally from the legislature, common law being ‘nothing else but statutes, anciently written, but which have been worn out by time’.* Similarly, Chief Justice Vaughan had observed in 1672 that ‘most of the Common Law cannot be conceived to be Law otherwise than by Acts of Parliament, or Power equivalent to them’.’ Eighteenth-century writers who sought to make definitions of the law could hence describe it in terms of rules and in terms of bodies. Blackstone, describing what the common law was, called it the law of custom,’ which he divided into three types: general customs, particular customs, and particular local laws.!! For Blackstone, there were certain positive tests to see whether the * Institutes of Natural Law, 3rd edn. (London, 1754), 1.\n\n> E.

This view of law as a tangible thing owed much to Coke’s polemic against the crown, where he had argued for an ancient immemorial and unchanging common law. For if there was such a body, then it could be traced, so that even in the later eighteenth century, both Blackstone and Francis Sullivan were attempting to trace back the ‘pure’ feudal rules corrupted by the\n\nNorman conquest.” The publication of Hale’s History of the Common Law was a landmark in the establishment of a view of the law as a body based on a unified principle.* Hale’s work sought to reconcile the political and historical polemics with a legal theory of the nature of the common law that was more sophisticated than Blackstone’s static view. Given the recent historiography, which had shown how the law after the Conquest had differed from the pre-Norman law,’ Hale reconciled the immemoriality of the common law with its flexibility by putting forward a Burkean view: the common law was a body, which grew and adapted itself to the people’s needs, ever approaching perfection. Thus, ‘by Use, Practice, Commerce, Study and Improvement of the English People, [the laws] arrived in Henry 2d’s\n\nTime to a greater Improvement,’”* he said, while under Edward I, the ‘English Justinian’, the law ‘obtained a very great Perfection’.” According to Hale, the law was more or less settled by this time. For Hale, then, the law did change, but it was still a body, ‘as Titius is the same Man he was 40 Years since, tho’ Physicians tell us, That in a Tract of seven Years, the Body has scarce any of the same Material Substance it had before’.'® The antiquity of the common law, which had always been a strand in English legal thought, now became a dominant one, and the notion that one could not tell the origin of laws—and hence their reason—became a central idea in justifying 2 1 Comm. 77-8. 3 2 Comm. 52 and F.

From Hale through Blackstone to Burke,” the idea took root that the law was shaped by the collective reason of society, and was not to be scrutinized in the light of its intrinsic reason. Hale’s view of law was one which stressed that there were right answers to be found in the law. This can be seen in his response to Hobbes’s Dialogue between a Philosopher and a Student of the Common Laws of England. Hobbes, discussing Coke’s comment that nothing was law which was not reason, dismissed this idea, saying that since all men had reason, any man might disobey any law he felt unreasonable, which was plainly absurd. From this, he argued that “[ilt is not Wisdom,\n\nbut Authority that makes a Law’.”! Hobbes’s\n\nphilosopher argued that reason could not be the arbiter of law, since all disagreed on reason, so that law must be seen to come from the sovereign.?? Hale’s response was to argue that the reason of law was not the reason of every man, but, as in many other complex sciences, needed learning and application.” Hale could thus rehabilitate an idea of the artificial reason of the law, but he was still left with a rulebased concept. For Hale argued that the natural reason Hobbes had attacked led to an arbitrariness not found in the common law. ‘[T]hat\n\nLaw is best framed’, he said, ‘that at once hath Certainty, and yett induceth as few particular mischiefs as may be.’ Since moral actions were infinitely complex and varied, it was not natural reason but the reason of time which produced solutions: ‘Long Experience makes more discoveries touching conveniences or Inconveniences of Laws then is possible for the wisest Councill of Men att first to foresee.» This was a Burkean response to Hobbes’s positivism, ® See J. G. A. Pocock, ‘Burke and the Ancient Constitution’, in his Politics, Language and Time: Essays on Political Thought and History (London, 1972), 202-32. 2!

Cropsey (Chicago and London, 1971), 55. 2 Hence, Hobbes’s positivist definition: ‘A Law is the Command of him, or them that have the Soveraign Power, given to those that be his or their Subjects, declaring Publickly, and plainly what every of them may do, and what they must forbear to do.’ Ibid. 71.\n\n= ‘[T]ho’ two, or more, men of ye Same perfection of the reasoning Facultie that have yett variously Exercised and applyed that Comon Facultie to their Severall objects, they are not Equally to Expect an equall aptitude and perfection in each othrs\n\n|sic] Science or art.’ Reflections by the Lrd.

By the eighteenth century, Blackstone saw this artificial reason as being embodied in custom and the law of nature. However, this view of defined sources of law, and of positive rules that could be related to them, was relatively new. This is evident in earlier approaches to the law of nature. Lawyers like Fortescue did not consider that there was one universal system of natural law, but felt that the law grew from a number of sources. The common law was seen to conform to a natural law, but this natural law was no deductive or complete structure: rather, it was an innate rationality, to be seen and tested by the use of logic. Fortescue took his definition of law—\"it is an holy sanction, commanding whatever is honest, and forbidding the contrary’?*—from the civil law, but his method for discovering the reason of the laws was Aristotelian.”” Fortescue saw no unitary system, but a multiplicity of good laws. ‘If ... under these three distinctions of the Law of Nature, Customs and Statutes, the fountains and originals of all laws, I shall prove the Law of England eminently to excel,’ he wrote, ‘then I shall have evinced it to be good and effectual for the government of that kingdom.’ He added, The laws of England, as far as they agree with, and are deduced from the Law of nature, are neither better nor worse in their decisions than the laws of all other states or kingdoms in similar cases. For, as the philosopher says, in the fifth of his Ethics, ‘The Law of Nature is the same, and has the same force all\n\nthe world over.’” This view could be interpreted, as it was by Selden, to see natural\n\nlaw as a base on which the body of the civil laws could grow.” It could equally be seen to use the law of nature as an external test of rationality, in a way which would give it a greater function in the practical reasoning of lawyers. If the law of nature did not provide positive rules, and if common lawyers were suspicious of a Hobbesian sovereign, then their artificial reason implied a lawyerly craft which was inductive, drawing from what law existed, and analysing in an Aristotelian way. The result was that in the sixteenth and early seventeenth * De Laudibus Legum Angliac, 8. 2 Ibid. 20. % See Tuck,\n\nNatural Rights\n\nLegislation Determined, 44-5.\n\n2% Ibid. 47. Theories, 83-4. See\n\nalso\n\nLieberman,\n\n# Ibid. 48. The Province of\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\ncenturies, common-law theoreticians did not turn to the law of nature to provide a methodological framework, but, like John Dodderidge,*! outlined the Aristotelian method as the necessary tool for anyone wishing to understand those sciences which were founded on reason. For Dodderidge, while all law might derive from the law of nature, the reason of the law had to be discovered by\n\nexamining each rule through the rules of logic.” This view of law as being derived from a form of reasoning was one shared by Coke, who had an essentially different conception of law from that held by those seeking to define all the law. For Coke had viewed the common law as being beyond definition, with an infinity of sources and guises. It was no coincidence that Coke never wrote a systematic treatise of the common law, but left his thoughts embedded in a chaotic commentary on Littleton and in his Reports; for to set down a complete defining treatise would have contradicted\n\nhis idea of what the common law was about.”” When Coke said what the common law was, he defined not one source, but twenty. More importantly, these sources were not sources of rules or guides, but were forms of reasoning. Coke’s sources included the maxims and principles of the common law, books of authority, the original writs in the Register,\n\ncorrect entries of judgments\n\nand\n\napproved\n\npre-\n\ncedents, as well as such purely abstract ideas of the nature of reasoning as arguments from convenience, from the impossible, from greater to lesser conclusions and vice versa, from common presumptions, and from the opinions of learned men.* This definition of the common law was not a substantive one, seeing law 3!

Terrill, ‘Humanism and Rhetoric in Legal Education: The Contribution of Sir John Dodderidge 30-44.\n\n(1555-1628)’, Journal of Legal History, ii (1981),\n\n” Coke’s Institutes stand clearly in the common\n\nlaw tradition of unstructured\n\ndescriptions of the law, for he made no attempt to reduce the law to a coherent, selfcontained whole. Instead, the first book was a commentary on Littleton, being an unstructured presentation of a lifetime’s learning, in which Littleton’s structure was\n\nused to pass on a variety of facts and ideas in Coke’s opinion central to the common law. For that reason, many of Coke’s important comments bore little relation to the point being discussed in Littleton’s text. Thus, his famous ideas on the embodiment of reason in the law were included in a commentary on Frankalmoigne. See The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England; Or, a Commentary on Littleton, 17th edn., ed. F. Hargrave and C. Butler, 2 vols. (London, 1817), 97b (henceforth as Coke upon Littleton\n\n97b). The second book of the Institutes was a chronological description of statute, the\n\nthird an alphabetical treatise on pleas of the crown, and the fourth an analysis of the courts.\n\n# Coke upon Littleton 11a.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nas a set of clear rules or as a system which contained in itself the answer to legal problems: it was rather a view of the law as a system of reasoning, where most of the ‘sources’ of law were modes of thinking. Coke’s most famous definition of the law was that it was based on reason: ‘Nihil quod est contra rationem est licitum; for reason is the life of the law, nay the common law itselfe is nothing else but reason; which is to be understood of an artificiall perfection of reason, gotten by long study, observation, and experience, and not of every man’s naturall reason.’ This definition cannot be taken as meaning that the common law was based on the reason of natural law, and that one judged the rules of the common law by a rational test: it meant that the common law was a system of reasoning, that the source of law lay in the way that judges thought about legal problems. Common lawyers in Coke’s era shared this view: for them, the law was not a set of rules from above, but a system of remedies responding to wrongs in society. Law was to be found not in rules, but in maxims, eruditions, and principles. As Plowden said, _ Maxims are the Foundations of the Law and the Conclusions of Reason, and therefore they ought not to be impugned, but always to be admitted; yet these Maxims may by the Help of Reason, be compared together, and set one against another, (although they do not vary) where it may be distinguished by a Reason that a Thing is nearer to one Maxim than to another, or placed between two Maxims, nevertheless they ought never to be impeached or impugned, but always be observed and held as firm Principles and Authorities of themselves.**\n\nLaw was drawn from life. Not only did it have as many sources as life, but they interacted in a flexible way. John Dodderidge wrote, [A]ll Grounds or Rules of the Law of England in respect they doe concerne, are either such as are not restrained peculiar title of the Law, but as occasion serueth, are part, title or tractate of the law ... All which, being\n\nof their matter which to any one proper or applicable into euery either conclusions of\n\nNaturall reason, or drawne and deriued from the same, do not onely serue as\n\ndirections and Principles of the Law, but are likewise as Positions and Axiomes to be obserued throughout all mans life and conuersation; hauing their originall from those Arts that are necessary and behoofull for maintenance of humane societie.” * Coke upon Littleton 97b. %\n\nThe Commentaries or Reports of Edmund Plowden\n\n% The Lawyer’s Light, 7.\n\n(London, 1779), 27.\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nAccording to Dodderidge, the grounds of law included natural and moral philosophy, custom, civil and canon law. All these sources of law were multifarious and could not ‘bee properly reduced . . . vnder any one peculiar title of the Law extant in any abridgement, table or dictionarie’.* To understand the law, the lawyer had to apply logic. This would reveal both the primary conclusions of reason, which were imprinted on the minds of all men, and the secondary principles ‘which are not so well knowne by the light of nature, as by other meanes’,®” and which could be seen by speculation to be true, even though the manifest truth of them were unknown. Dodderidge explained that legal rules came from two forms of reasoning, the one being manifestly true—the reason evident to all— and the other being a ‘contingent veritie’. Contingent propositions,\n\nthough framed on the observation of nature, were not equally manifest to all people, for reason was imperfect. ‘Therefore,’ he said, ‘are those Grounds not vniuersally true, but subiect to many and manifould Exceptions: And yet never the lesse true in all such Cases as are not comprehended under these Restraints or Exceptions.’® There were instances where the rule could not cover all cases. Hence, the law was best left to each circumstance: [I]t is more conuenient and profitable to the state of the common wealth to\n\nframe Law vpon deliberation and debate of reason, by men skilfull and learned in that facultie, when present occasion is offered to vse the same, by a case then falling out and requiring ludiciall determination: for then it is likely, with much more care, industrie and diligence to be looked vnto; and much more time of deliberation is there taken for the mature decision thereof, then otherwise upon the establishing of any positiue Law, might be imported concerning the same.*!\n\nJustice and law hence came from reasoning on the case. New cases did not have anterior authority, but had to be decided by inference and application. The law was thus about deriving rules of reasoning, building the law from cases and circumstances, but not subsuming all under single rules. This conception of the common law as a system of reasoning was one that remained the practising lawyer’s view. It will be seen that despite the rise of a jurisprudential view of the nature of the common law which stressed that it was built * The Lawyer's Light, 15.\n\n* Ibid. 45.\n\n* Ibid. 58.\n\n#1 Jbid. 90.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\naround single principles, a conception remained of it as a system of remedies that could be flexible and adaptive.” At the beginning of the eighteenth century, most common lawyers did not seek to put their law into a rational form. Because they saw the law as a form of reasoning working within a set of remedies, most legal texts were written not in a systematic way, but as lists. The literature of the common law built from the bottom up, describing what law existed and assuming that it had an internal logic. The common law was seen to be based on the procedure of writs and actions as opposed to substantive laws or rights, so that the law was not seen as a self-contained whole, but developed in response to problems arising in society. Works outlining the various forms of writs were therefore a very important part of common law literature, the classic work still being Fitzherbert’s Natura Brevium .* This form of literature remained popular in the eighteenth century, when William Bohun’s English Lawyer, itself a summary of writs, explained that principle was to be discovered in the writs: It is very justly observed by my Lord Coke\" and others, That Original Writs are the Foundation on which the Common Law depends: And certainly a careful Perusal of, and attending to the various Forms of the Writs laid down in the Register, and in the Natura Breviums, will discover not only much of the Practice and Methods of Proceeding, but also in ma[n]y Cases, the very rationale and fundamental Principles upon which our Common Law is Built.*°\n\nEarly eighteenth-century legal literature was dominated by the practitioners’ books which displayed precedents of pleas. Such \"2 See S. F. C. Milsom, ‘Reason in the Development of the Common\n\nLaw’, Law\n\nQuarterly Review, Ixxxi (1965), 496-517.\n\n* The New Natura Brevium of the most reverend Judge Mr. Anthony Fitzherbert, ed. William Rastall (London,\n\n1652). The preface to this book illustrates how\n\nwrits were\n\nseen to be the base of the common law: ‘In every Art and Science, there are certain Rules and Foundations, to which a Man ought for to give credit, and which he cannot deny. In like manner there are divers Maxims and Fundamentals in the knowledge of the Common Laws of the Land, which a Man ought for to believe very necessary for\n\nthose who will understand the same Law, especially at the beginning of their studies; for upon those Fundamentals the whole Law doth depend. For which purpose, in time past there was composed by a Learned Man, a very profitable book, cald, The Register, which doth contain\n\nsundry\n\nPrincipals,\n\nby which\n\nhe would\n\nbe well instructed who\n\nwould study the Law. And also for that purpose was there composed by a Learned\n\nMan, a Book called natura Brevium, which Book doth declare and set forth the Diversities and natures of many Original Writs with their Process.’ This book aimed to\n\nmodernize the previous two. 4 Coke upon Littleton 73b. * William Bohun, The English Lawyer (London, 1732), 3-4.\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nbooks did not attempt to describe legal rules for the practitioner—for ‘rules’ followed cases, not vice versa—but neither did they attempt to analyse procedural rules. Instead, they merely showed the correct means with which to present a legal case, recording the pleas and the record of the averments in various cases without looking at all at the legal rules involved, the verdicts given, or the arguments of counsel. They were merely guides on how to draw up a good plea, for if the plea was correctly drawn, the case would be won. Among such works were Richard Aston’s Placita Latine Rediviva, published in 1661, which was an alphabetical treatise listing various types of plea under each form of action. Thus, under the heading Action sur le case was listed ‘Brief versus Tailer per deceit’, ‘Pre fauxment inditer de felony sans Clergy’, and ‘Versus Common carryer pur perder des Biens’. This type of book was extremely common.* For the practitioner, pleading was the entry to the reason of the law and legal texts focused on the forms of plea and presentation.” However, for the most part, there was no discussion of rationale in the textbooks.** The other forms which the literature of the common law took equally reflected the idea that it grew from below, for the tendency was merely to describe the law as it was, with little systematic * Others of the same ilk included Simon Theloall’s Le Digest des Briefs et des Choses concernant eux (London, 1687); Henry Clift’s A New Book of Declarations, Pleadings, Verdicts, etc. (London, 1719); and Robert Gardiner’s Instructor Clericalis (London, 1693).\n\nSee also Gardiner’s The Doctrine of Demurrers, setting the variety of precedents of Demurrers in all sorts of Actions and in all the several parts of Pleading (London, 1706); The English Pleader (London, 1734); and the countless versions of the Young Clerk’s Tutor. ” Thus Giles Jacob wrote in 1725 that the English laws were the most rational in the world, and that he had found ‘the Fundamental Principles on which their great and\n\nNoble structure is built’: yet the book he wrote was an alphabetical list of terms and procedures.\n\nThe Student’s\n\nCompanion\n\n(London,\n\n1725),\n\niv. Jacob\n\nwas\n\nthe author\n\nof\n\nnumerous texts on law, which reflected the common lawyers’ method. One such was A Law Grammar; or Rudiments of the Law, which began by quoting Fortescue saying that ‘as etymology, orthography, prosody, and syntax, are the springs and foundations of\n\ngrammatical learning, so the principles, causes and elements, are the foundations of learning in the law’. This book was typical of its genre in its layout, being divided in six sections, covering definitions, the grounds and principles of law, maxims, moot points of practice, legal terms, and fictions. The fact that it reached a sixth edition in 1817 shows the tenacity of the thinking that lay behind it. * For instance, William Bohun’s Institutio Legalis (London, 1724) was divided into\n\nfour parts: the first described terms and writs and the authority of the courts; the second covered crown informations, fines, the process of outlawry, and official writs; the third showed mixed and personal actions; and the fourth examined various pleas. Yet in all this, there was no discussion of the reason behind the system.\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\norganization.“ One such type of work was the abridgement of statutes, such as John Cay’s, written in 1739, which stood in a long tradition of abridgements, whose major methodological tool was the alphabet.” Another type of work was the specific study of one aspect of the law, such as William Nelson’s Lex Maneriorum, which collected all its information from case reports on copyholds, but arranged\n\neverything alphabetically.’ A third form of legal literature which remained popular was the law dictionary and Nelson himself brought out an edition of Blount’s dictionary.” Common law literature thus assumed that the law was not imposed, but grew out of society, and that therefore it could not be defined, but only described. The problem with this view of the law was that it did little to explain the law’s practical functioning. Law remained a mystery. ‘{The] knowledge of the law is like a deepe well,’ Coke wrote, ‘out of which each man draweth according to the strength of his understanding. He that reacheth deepest, he seeth the amiable and admirable secrets of the law, wherein, I assure you, the sages of the\n\nlaw in former times... have had the deepest, reach.’*’ The difficulty was that legal literature in the early eighteenth century did not inform the student how to achieve this, particularly since the demise of the early sixteenth-century works on method and logic.° Timothy Cunningham explained the problem of the modern approach: ‘English law writers frequently begin their definitions with the words is when, which is erroneous,’ he said, giving an example: ‘“Abatement,” says Sir Edward Coke, is when a man died seised of an estate of inheritance, and between the heir and an estranger doth interpose\n\nhimself and abate.’ The mere listing of large numbers of remedies * For a survey of a typical selection of common law literature, see Louis A.

This took several forms. At one level, the early eighteenth century, taking up this desire to define what the law was about, saw a growing interest in histories of doctrines and areas of the law, which sought to define the law. These treatises sought to analyse the law in terms of principle, showing the principle through history.* At another, it took the form of seeking to put the common law into a systematic framework, to show that it had rationality and comprehensiveness. This attempt, taken up by Blackstone, involved putting the law into a Roman structure, and showing that it could be related to a series of source-based rights, which could be derived from a natural law base. English lawyers had always seen the civil law as a source of principles and jurisprudence,” but they had not sought to reconcile their system with its forms. Blackstone sought to unite jurisprudence and common law practice into one framework, in order to show that the common law could be seen to fit a deductive system of reasoning from natural law principles, which were essential and epistemologically correct. This law saw the law as unfolding, as a matter of principle, in a deductive way from above, to produce a coherent and systematic structure which held within itself all the legal answers society might require. This was a new way of defining the common law, distinct from Hale’s concept of a growing law.* This view, stressing the holistic nature and unity of law, was one shared by Bentham. Blackstone and Bentham are usually seen as * Thomas Madox, in the preface to his History and Antiquities of the Exchequer, 2nd edn. (London, 1769), said it was useful to look at ancient law along with modern, so that ‘by comparing them together, and by enquiring into the Causes of such Alteration\n\nas was afterwards superinduced, and the Manner in which it was brought about, he may comprehend the Subject-Matter in its full extent’.

This view is challenged, however, by Christopher Brooks and Kevin Sharpe in ‘History, English Law and the Renaissance‘,\n\nPast and Present, Ixxii (1976),\n\n133-42, where they argue that English lawyers did not claim immemoriality of the common law before Coke, but were aware of, civilian jurisprudence. * Hale had written, ‘it is not possible for men to come to the evidence and Demonstration touching [laws] as may be expected Sciences’.

However, it will be seen here that Bentham’s Pannomion was a natural successor to Blackstone, and that the conceptions of law as a unity that both men held stood outside the common law view. For it was only when the work of Blackstone, attempting to show that it was an ideal holistic code, failed to make the content of the common law fit the structure and the theory, that Bentham saw that, in order to achieve the ideal rulebased code resting on coherent first principles deducing into a whole system of law, one had to abandon the common law framework, and define anew. It will be seen that the Blackstonian and Benthamic views of law—those essentially taken up by historians as the mainstream discussions of what the law was about—were in fact outside the mainstream of what lawyers thought the law was about. It will be seen also that in both men’s attempts to redefine law, they were less unequivocal about the traditional method than has been supposed. At the same time that Blackstone was. seeking to create a rightsbased structure of the common law, other lawyers were seeking a rationalization of law by organizing and ordering the notions of legal remedies they had. At the end of the eighteenth century, there was therefore a growth in interest in the science of pleading, as the heart of the law. This involved rationalizing and refining the intricacies of the rules of practice to create a framework where a theory of law based on logical forms of reasoning and a multiplicity of sources could be revived. The articulation of a theory of law as a system of remedies allowed the common lawyers to reject the Blackstonian and Benthamic visions, and is therefore a vital context for explaining the survival of a haphazard common law system into the nineteenth century, in the face of attempts to codify the law. This is a study of the conception of law; but in order to understand developments in that conception, and the impact of legal ideas, it is necessary to understand how the law worked in practice. For the latter view of law we have discussed was a practitioner’s view, which created a theory out of a view of how the law in fact worked. It is an aim of this study, then, to examine the interaction of legal theory and practice, to show how they influenced each other. It will be seen that we cannot look at law through the theoretical lenses of Blackstone and Bentham, and that historians cannot understand the\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\ncommon law of the period unless they come to terms with its intrinsic nature as a system of remedies, and see the importance of the practitioners’ view. It will be seen that this theory of law, of its growth from below through the presentation of cases, had in the end to be accommodated by jurisprudence, and that the jurisprudence of men like Austin retreated importantly from the reformist view of law put forward by Bentham. It will be seen that the essential theory of the common law, and the one to survive into the nineteenth century, was the one which stressed that the law was a system of remedies, where the law did not contain within itself all the answers to legal problems, but drew on a multiplicity of sources to arrive at its solutions. By examining the view of the common law as a series of remedies, it can also be seen how the law reflected opinion, and turned to politics, morals, and abstract notions of justice for solutions to cases. The law, it will be seen, did not define right and wrong, but sought to follow the needs and dictates of society, as interpreted by the judges. Perhaps the most useful analysis of jurisprudence was provided neither by Blackstone nor Bentham, but by Adam Smith’s idea of the impartial spectator. For Smith, rights did not derive from imposition (whether by God, nature, or a sovereign) but from the recognition an impartial spectator would give them. Thus, ‘we may conceive an injury was done when an impartial spectator would be of opinion [that the sufferer] was injured, [and] would join with him in his concern and go along with him when he defended the subject in his possession against any violent attack’. The right was proved by the sympathy of the impartial spectator. Thus, in the case of theft, ‘[t]he cause of this sympathy or concurrence betwixt the spectator and the possessor is, that he enters into his thoughts and concurs in his opinion that he may form a reasonable expectation of using ...\n\nwhatever it is in the manner he pleases’.”’ By this view, the law had to find the appropriate remedy for the injured party from an impartial point of view, thereby solving the case in a just way, but bearing in mind moral questions which went beyond the case. This was the substantive aim of the common law: not to apply eternal rules, nor to regulate society from above, but to provide #\n\nLectures on Jurisprudence, ed. R. Meek,\n\nD. D. Raphael, and P. G. Stein (Oxford,\n\n1978), 17. Smith elaborated this when discussing crimes: ‘in all cases the measure of the punishment to be inflicted on the delinquents is the concurrence of the impartial spectator with the resentment of the injured.’ Ibid. 104.\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nuseful, just, and flexible solutions to individual cases. This was not\n\ndone in a vacuum of arbitration, however, and there were strict rules on tase presentation. Before the court could make substantive decisions based on justice or fairness, the parties had to fulfil the\n\nstrict requiréments\n\nof procedure and the technicalities of case\n\npresentation. Once a dispute was formally set, the court looked to a range of sources for a resolution of the case: but their range of solutions was itself limited and constricted by the forms in which they were presented. Legal solutions could thus be an odd mixture of notions of policy and justice, and technical arguments where substantive decisions were shaped by the form of action. The discussion of legal reasoning in the courts will focus almost wholly on internal legal debates and considerations of legal doctrines without looking closely at social influences and political considerations outside the courts which influenced the development of law. This, it may be argued, is to make the study too narrow, and imply that the history of law can be written wholly from within, as if legal doctrine has its own logic blissfully impervious to the petty considerations of daily life. However, there are reasons why, in this case, the approach is justified. First, while law is a social phenomenon, it works in an artificial forum with its own form of argument and its own language. As Ronald Dworkin has written, ‘{e]very actor in the practice understands that what it permits or requires depends on the truth of certain propositions that are given sense only by and within the practice; the practice consists in large part in deploying and arguing about these propositions’.*’ Law has a relative äutönomy; and those who suggest that the law is wholly or mostly shaped by social considerations outside the legal forum would do well to remember that, in practice, legal constructs formulated and imposed in the artificial forum of the court often determine and shape those social identities and forces said to control\n\nthe law. Second, it will be seen that the law was not cut off from society, but that it was accepted that the law drew its rules from society and changed in response to social needs. As will be seen, this ™ See especially the important introductory essay to G. R. Rubin and D. Sugarman,\n\nLaw, Economy and Society, 1750-1914: Essays in the History of English Law (Abingdon, 1984), for an approach which relates law to society. *' Law’s Empire (London, 1986), 13. * This is why Critical Legal Scholars, seeking to delegitimize the law, focus almost wholly on doctrine.

Law was more than an instrument of policy: but policy was part of law. Social and policy considerations remained central: but the peculiarity of the legal context in which, and how, these ideas were discussed means that we must first have a full understanding of that legal context before we can assess the importance of those external considerations. The view of law shown here will therefore differ from most views of the common law of our period. It will be seen that the law was not based on any concept of the law of nature or any other single standard. Such standards imply that there is a single right answer to be found for legal problems and that there are clear standards of morals or justice which can be used to find those answers. This idea was bound to fail, for it proved impossible to find such solutions. In practice, courts could only find the best answer, answers which only had validity so long as they succeeded in their aims and were useful. Law had to reflect society and its needs: and just as there were no single answers in daily life, so there were none in law. It was this fact which most undermined the static constructs of Blackstone and Bentham. Law remained in essence procedural, not rule based. Within this series of forms, judges sought the best answers to problems, which could best benefit the community, which served the interests of justice—however they defined that—and which satisfied the litigants. Each case was set by the litigants, each dispute was new; and because judges were solving each case as presented to them by drawing on a multiplicity of sources, the legal answers they produced were a reflection of the haphazard morality of the society, shaped in the artificial forum.\n\n2\n\nThe Common Law and the Commentaries WHEN Blackstone sought to devise a course of lectures to give young gentlemen ‘some acquaintance with the laws of the land’,’ he faced the problem not only of creating an adequate overall map of the hitherto unfathomable and chaotic nature of the law, but also of explaining the underlying principles of law that led to particular judgments in particular cases. For the Vinerian professor, the lawyer trained only in practice, uninstructed in the first principles on which the practice was based, would be bewildered if he encountered any case departing from precedent: ‘ita lex scripta est is the utmost his knowledge will arrive at,’ Blackstone wrote; ‘he must never aspire to form, and seldom expect to comprehend, any arguments drawn a priori, from the spirit of the laws and the natural foundations of justice’.? Blackstone faced a double dilemma: not only was it difficult to extract principles, but there were very few written rules to draw on, for the common law was, as he put it, ‘only handed down by tradition, use, and experience’.” In an era where statutes were perceived as secondary additions and modifications of the common law, which were piecemeal and fragmented rather than unified and general, and where law reporting was rudimentary, case adjudications rested on two often unfathomable institutions. On the one hand lay the twelve judges of the Courts of Westminster Hall, who could discuss legal matters among themselves and develop their legal ideas in an ‘unwritten’ manner. Much early eighteenth-century law was hence part of an oral culture, or the custom of judges in their practice. On the other hand lay the jury, making decisions which 1 1 Comm. 6.\n\n2 1 Comm. 32.\n\n3 1 Comm. 17.\n\n* See A. W. B. Simpson, ‘The Common Law and Legal Theory’, in Simpson (ed.), Oxford Essays in Jurisprudence, 2nd series (Oxford, 1973). This may be seen in the fact,\n\nfor example, that in the 32 years when Lord Mansfield presided in the King’s Bench,\n\n18\n\nThe Common Law and the Commentaries\n\nfailed to distinguish matters of law and fact, but mingled them in a single verdict. In addressing these two tasks, Blackstone’s Commentaries achieved both success and failure. His overall map of the law, its arrangement and categorizations, gave the common law a coherence and unity not seen before; he was widely praised for this, and as a result his work became the staple diet for the law student for over a\n\ncentury.° His methodology was similarly important, for in putting the law into an order and a method, and in seeking to analyse it as a system of rules, he allowed lawyers to treat specific areas of law as sciences capable of analysis, and not merely as terms of art to be followed. He was less successful, however, in explaining the functioning of law at case level, as Bentham was quick to expose in his critique.’ In fact, the Commentaries were not a treatise on legal reasoning, but a summary of the law; and when it came to a discussion of how the courts functioned, Blackstone relied more on a theory of customs and maxims than on positive rules. Hence, a gap remained between Blackstone’s traditional view of judges, and his quest for principle. He attempted to fill this gap by using the law of nature, but his careless and casual use of the concept reveals his lack of success.* A view of the common law as based on natural law there were only 20 cases where dissenting opinions were expressed, and only 6 cases were reversed on appeal. See C. H. S. Fifoot, Lord Mansfield (Oxford, 1936), 47 and Edmund Heward,\n\nLord Mansfield (Chichester and London, 1979), 57-8.\n\n* Lord Mansfield contrasted Blackstone’s ‘analytical reasoning’ with the ‘uncouth crabbed’ nature of Coke’s Commentary on Littleton. See John Holliday, The Life of William late Earl of Mansfield (London, 1797), 89. Jeremy Bentham praised him as the\n\nfirst accessible institutional writer: A Comment on the Commentaries and a Fragment on Government, ed. J. H. Burns and H. L. A. Hart (London, 1977).

Finnis, ‘Blackstone’s Theoretical Intentions’, Natural Law Forum, xii (1967), 163-83 which both point to areas of logical\n\nconsistency but reveal the irrelevance of much of Blackstone’s theorizing to his substantive text; and H.-J. Rinck, ‘Blackstone and the Law of Nature’, Ratio, ii (1960),\n\n162-80, which points to its logical flaws. Daniel J. Boorstin’s The Mysterious Science of the Law (Cambridge, Mass., 1941) argues that Blackstone was both a rationalist and an anti-rationalist and that he identified all aspects of English law with the law of nature,\n\nThe Common Law and the Commentaries\n\n19\n\nprinciples entailed a fundamentally different view of law from a theory of custom. What made them sit together in the Commentaries was Blackstone’s use of an Institutional framework in which to locate a customary and remedies-based system of law.’ The Institutional structure not only assisted his categorizations of the law, but also enabled Blackstone to use a theory of law based on rules with rational and determinate sources, in order to show that the common law was not a haphazard collection of customs and maxims, but a coherent whole. In borrowing the Institutional structure for the Commentaries, Blackstone had to borrow the natural law epistemology as an organizing concept to give it coherence; but since he did not seek to relate natural law to legal reasoning at case level, it could play no part in explaining the law. Blackstone’s theorizing on natural law was cursory and derivative.” Instead of natural law being a positive source, it ended at best with reason being a curb on custom, so that unreasonable customs were prevented from being seen as\n\nlaw.\" Yet this was not particularly informative, for an unreasonable custom was little more than a custom which was not recognized as a legally binding one. This required an explanation of how and when courts first recognized customs as legally binding; something Blackstone failed adequately to cover.\n\nThe Institutional Structure\n\nGiven the absence of a systematized English law and the decline of theoretical analyses of the common law, there was a growing interest but also avoided all logical and empirical difficulties by casting a veil of mystery over the law. Ernest Barker’s Traditions of Civility (Cambridge, 1948), 309-19 argued that natural law played no part in the common law and that it was paradoxical -for Black-\n\nstone to include it. However, David Lieberman's The Province of Legislation Determined, 36-55 restates the importance of natural law for Blackstone by reconciling it with his\n\nhistory. ?

Roman jurisprudence was considered to be a science of principles, to be referred to when the common law was silent, and it was therefore praised by the English judges. Holt, for instance, said ‘{i}nasmuch as the laws of all nations are doubtless raised out of the ruins of the civil law, as al] governments are sprung out of the Roman Empire, it must be assumed that the principles of our law are borrowed from the civil law, and therefore grounded upon the same reason in many things’.\"‘ Hale said that the reasons of the law were so well grounded in the civil law that the best way to learn law as a science was to read the Digest.’> For principle, one looked to Roman jurisprudence. ‘It is’, wrote Samuel Hallifax, admirably calculated to furnish the minds of youth with universal and leading notions . . . the student, who confines himself to the institutions of his own country, without joining to them any acquaintance with those of Imperial Rome, will never arrive at any considerable skill in the grounds and theory of his profession: though he may perhaps attain to a certain mechanical readiness in the forms and practical parts of the law, he will not be able to comprehend that enlarged and general idea of it, by which it is connected with the great system of Universal Jurisprudence.’\n\nThe Roman structure was a deductive one, moreover, and writers like Thomas Bever described the law in the context of a chain of principles in the universe, where all was interdependent, and where the destruction of one part would damage the whole.” This structure, he said, was best found in the corpus juris. 2 Roman law was still derided as tyrannical and foreign, but since the decline of the Inns of Court by the 1700s, the only abstract analysis of law available was the civilian one.

The Institutes sought to relate the principles of law to the law of nature. Justinian’s Institutes had been divided into\n\nfour books, but only the first two titles of the first book were devoted to justice and natural law. Yet these raw materials of jurisprudence— the maxims justitia est constans et perpetua voluntas jus suum cuique\n\ntribuendi and jurisprudentia est divinarum atque humanarum rerum notitia, justi atque injusti scientia*—were the foundations of more developed deductions in later works. Eighteenth-century Institutists always prefaced their works with a chapter on laws in general, which stood as introductory pieces to guide the reader through the three subsequent books. This introduction stood as a theory of justice, as derived from God or the law of nature. This pattern was followed by the most scholarly and complete English Institute of the eighteenth century, John Ayliffe’s A New Pandect of Roman Civil Law, published in 1734. Ayliffe began by asserting that justice existed before positive law, and that justice—the giving each man his due— was the basis of all laws. From here, the structure divided human and divine laws, and divided human law into universal and particular laws, and so on. But all worked up to one definition of law: The Law is an Art directing us to the Knowledge of Justice, or (in other Terms) Ars Boni et aequi, that is to say, a collection of Precepts, teaching us, what is just and what is unjust, what is equitable and what savours of Iniquity. For the word Ars here signifies a system of certain propositions,\n\nviz. which are known to us by Practice and which lead Men profitable End of Life.\"\n\nto some\n\nAyliffe’s idea of legal education was the antithesis of the common law one: ‘Persons ought not immediately in the beginning to commit themselves rashly to that vast Ocean, but to set out in their Searches 1766),\n\n2-3:\n\n‘Nothing\n\nis more\n\ncertain,\n\nthan\n\nthat a series of subordinate connexions\n\nestablished, by the great Lord and Father of All, between every part of the moral, as\n\nwell of the material, world. The dependence is so necessary, that the interruption of any of the springs, whereby either is moved, will endanger the very being of the whole machine. In the one, the fabric of the universe would be dissolved: in the other, mankind would be totally disunited, and reduced to what is usually, though improperly, called a state of nature. The office therefore of jurisprudence is to frame such laws as are correspondent to the nature of man; to make THEM the perpetual standards of human actions; and by enforcing an uniform and consistent obedience, to\n\nprevent so fatal a dissipation.’ * D. Justiniani Institutionum, ed. George Harris, 2nd edn.

The common lawyer looking at civilian jurisprudence was therefore faced with two things, a coherent science of principles serving as a source for legal arguments and jurisprudence, and also a structured body of law which could serve as an excellent model for the arrangement of substantive rules. As common lawyers sought to give an overall map of their system, it was obvious to follow a Romanist structure. However, the Roman structure was based on rules and principles which involved a distinct concept of law which often differed from the common lawyers’ one. The price of the Institutional model was the jettisoning of a common law view of the sources of law. The alternative was merely using the Institutional model as an aide-mémoire which failed to explain the workings of the law. It was this dilemma that was fully taken on only in the Commentaries. While there had been attempts before to put the common law into a Roman framework?! they had used the Institutes only as a structure, without adopting its view of the workings of law. Sir Henry Finch had sought to reduce the common law to a rational whole in Nomotechnia, published in 1613, and in Law, or a Discourse thereof, published in 1627, he had been influenced primarily, as Prest has shown, by Ramist methodology.” The influence of this work on\n\nBlackstone\n\nhas long been\n\nrecognized,?? and indeed\n\nBlackstone\n\npraised Finch’s Law as the most methodical text yet written, its main flaw being that it was out of date since the abolition of feudal tenures.” Finch argued that ‘he that will take before him the whole Body of the Law, and proceed therein with Profoundness and ® Ayliffe, 3. 1 See, e.g., John Cowell,\n\nInstitutiones iuris Anglicani ad Methodum et seriem Insti-\n\ntutionum Imperialum compositae et digestae (London, 1605).\n\n22 See W. Prest, ‘The Dialectical Origins of Finch’s Law’, Cambridge Law Journal,\n\nxxxvi (1977), 326-52. The first book of Nomotechnia, translated in 1759 as A Description\n\nof the Common Law of England, was virtually identical to the first book of Law. The translator’s preface (at v) called this work ‘the first general Institute of the laws of England’.\n\n23 See W. S. Holdsworth, History of English Law, v. 399-401 and xii. 418. 4 An Analysis of the Laws of England, 3rd edn. (Oxford, 1758), vi. Hallifax made a similar objection to Finch’s work: Analysis, iii. Feudal tenures had been abolished in 1660.\n\nThe Common Law and the Commentaries\n\n23\n\nJudgment, will not lay the Foundation of his Edifice upon Estates, Tenures, the Nature of Writs and such like, but upon the current and sound Principles, of which our books are full’. Yet it was a very different work from the one Blackstone aimed to write. Finch drew\n\nnot on a single source of law, but instead posited a theoretical schema with a multiplicity of sources of law and reason, so that he did not seek to deduce the law from first principles. ‘Rules of reason’, he wrote, ‘are of two sorts; some taken from foreign learning, as well\n\ndivine as human; the rest proper to the law itself.’ His principles therefore included theology, grammar, logic, natural philosophy, physics, politics, economics, and ethics. Finch’s method in his long third chapter in which he examined the rules of reason taken from outside the law was simply to list maxims which could be covered by these headings, and then to describe rules in English law which confirmed these maxims. The largest category was logic, and to prove the logic of the law, Finch used the following method: he first proposed a logical maxim—Accessorum Sequitur Principale—and then illustrated it with an English rule: ‘A Servant procures a Stranger to kill his Master, this is not Petit Treason in the Servant, because it is only Felony in the Principal.’ Moving on to discuss law constructions, fictions, and positive laws, he wrote, ‘[t]he foregoing Rules were such as were derived but out of other sciences. These that\n\nfollow are peculiar to ourselves, and are called Law-constructions.’”” Finch therefore sought to explain the law by the application of method and logic, not by the application of clear rules. Finch’s work was seen as a pioneering attempt to methodize the law, and by the start of the eighteenth century, Thomas Wood was praising its Romanist structure, rather than its Ramist logic. Divided into parts on persons at common law, on rights and possessions, on offences, and on courts of judicature, ‘it almost follows the Method of Justinian’s Institutes,’ Wood declared,” adding that if Finch were modernized, the problems of common law education would be solved. Wood criticized the obsession of the universities with the civil law, and urged greater practicality on them, accusing them of\n\nscholastic nitpicking and fruitless discussion of useless practice.”” He said that it was a misconception to assume that there was a single 5 Finch, Common Law, 5. # Ibid. 17.\n\n7 Ibid. 41.\n\n# Some Thoughts concerning the Study of the Laws of England, 43.\n\n# Ibid. 16-17.\n\n24\n\nThe Common Law and the Commentaries\n\nsystem of civil law: instead, it had changed and adapted in all countries practising it. He contended that the English had borrowed what they wanted from the civil law, and that the common law was\n\n‘infinitely of more use’ than the abstract civil law.” The common lawyers, he said, were ‘willing to be tried by those [Roman] Texts, and to enter into a Comparison’. Wood did this, for he wrote both A New Institute of the Imperial or Civil Laws and An Institute of the Laws of England. The body of the former was divided into three books, covering Persons, Things, and Actions, and a fourth book covering proceedings in courts. The latter also had four books, covering Persons, Estates, Pleas of the Crown, and Courts of Justice. Wood’s English Institute was a reformist work, favouring the consolidation of the statute laws which were ‘monstrously overgrown’, and a simplification of the complex rules of pleading. He similarly felt that in the construction of conveyances, more regard should be had to the intention of the parties making the conveyance than the strictness of the expressions used.” Nevertheless, Wood still thought of the common law in the old terms, and in his advice to students, he recommended that the student should first read Littleton and Coke, as well as law dictionaries, abridgements, and collections of writs, and that he should always ‘keep Finch’s\n\nmethod\n\nin his Mind’.%\n\nThe\n\ncommon\n\nlaw\n\nfor Wood\n\nhad\n\nsix\n\nfoundations: the law of nature, the revealed law of God, general customs, principles and maxims, particular customs, and statutes. Wood listed a number of rules, taken from Coke, which illustrated the common law, including the idea that nothing which was against reason was law and that law respected the order of nature. This was not a set of sources for positive rules. The notion of common law was in effect defined by the first four foundations mentioned. Therefore, ‘when we say It is so by Common Law, it is as much as to say, By Common Right, or of Common Justice,’ Wood wrote, adding, ‘[i]ndeed\n\nit is many times very difficult to know what Cases are grounded upon the Law of Reason, and what upon the Custom of the Kingdom; yet we must endeavour to understand this, to know the perfect Reason of the Law’.* Statutes had a relatively minor stature, to be construed according to that common law. Hence any statute that was against reason was void. For Wood, maxims were ‘of the same ®” Wood, 14.\n\n3 Jbid. 57.\n\n32 An Institute of the Laws of England, 2 vols. (London, 1720), iii-v.\n\n3 Ibid. 45.\n\n4 Ibid. 6.\n\nThe Common Law and the Commentaries\n\n25\n\nstrength as Acts of Parliament when once the judges have determined what is a Maxim’. As a result, Blackstone saw Wood's work as a failure, dismissing it as ‘being little more than FINCH’s discourse enlarged and so thoroughly modernised, as to leave us frequently in the Dark, with regard to the Reason and Original of many still subsisting laws, which are founded in remote antiquity’.* Wood’s view of the foundations of the common law was wholly different from his civilian jurisprudence. He prefixed to his civilian work a translation of Domat’s Treatise of Laws to stand for the theoretical, introductory section. This had formed the preliminary book of Domat’s The Civil Law in its Natural Order,* which attempted to put modern French law into the Institutional structure. The introductory section related the body of the laws to a set of rational first principles and rules through an epistemological analysis which sought to resolve and explain the ends of laws. No man, he argued, could be ignorant of natural Jaw without being ignorant of himself, for the first principles of the law had an epistemological foundation in the will and the understanding. Man’s first law, which derived from these points, was to love God, since that was his end in life. His second law, derived from the first, was to love his fellow man.” These two essential laws governed all the rest, which derived from them. This analysis allowed Domat to explain the division of immutable and indifferent laws, for the validity of any law was tested by the two fundamental laws, and not by their intrinsic merit. Indifferent laws had no essential justice, but were only useful in certain places and at certain times as need dictated, and were known by promulgation rather than by intrinsic reason.* Even immutable laws were governed by the two fundamental laws: Laws have their Justice and Authority, only because of the relation which\n\nthey bear to the Order of Society, and to the Spirit of the two Fundamental Laws; So that if it happen, that the Order of Society and the Spirit of those Fundamental Laws, require that some of the Immutable Laws be restrained either by Exceptions or by Dispensations, they admit of those Mitigations.”\n\nIn Institutional works, natural law was not one source of many in the process of reasoning, but the central source of law.

Those who had hitherto sought to use the Institutional structure had only used it as a method of organization, not as a method of analysis, for they still saw the law as having a multiplicity of sources. No writer before Blackstone had therefore sought to use the Roman law on its own terms. He therefore wanted to mark out a Plan of the laws of ENGLAND, so comprehensive, as that every Title might be reduced under some one of its general Heads, which the student might afterwards pursue to any Degree of Minuteness; and at the\n\nsame time so contracted, that the Gentleman might Application contemplate and understand the Whole.”\n\nwith\n\ntolerable\n\nWriters on Blackstone have suggested that he wanted to systematize\n\nEnglish law in order to prove that it worked, in the face of critics who attacked the common law from a rationalist standpoint.*? However, given the genesis of the Commentaries in the 1750s, it seems unlikely that his intentions were quite so conservative. The problem of the chaos of English legal analysis was an old one, which had induced others to make similar systematizations. The fact that he was attempting to systematize English law in Roman terms did not make Blackstone innovatory: what was unusual was the sophistication and the rigour of the attempt, and the fact that he used the Institutional structure as more than a set of labels with which to describe existing law, But, as shall be evident, he found the task impossible.\n\n# Analysis, iv. * See Duncan Kennedy, ‘The Structure of Blackstone’s Commentaries’, Buffalo Law Review,\n\nxxviii\n\n(1979),\n\n205-382\n\nand\n\nBoorstin,\n\nThe Mysterious\n\nScience.\n\nSee\n\nalso\n\nR.\n\nWillman, ‘Blackstone and the Theoretical Perfection of English Law in the Reign of Charles\n\nII.’ Historical Journal, xxvi (1983), 39-70\n\nand P.

To see Blackstone as a conservative fending off liberal attacks is perhaps to translate later attacks on the common law back to the era of Blackstone. A major critique of the common law at Blackstone’s time was that it was unfathomable: the very act of defining it in terms of rules was hence a reformist measure. In addition, on matters of doctrine, Blackstone was not averse to challenging accepted orthodoxies, as his view of criminal law and his ideas on the course of descents at 2 Comm. 238 show.\n\nThe Common Law and the Commentaries\n\n27\n\nBlackstone’s Theoretical Foundations\n\nTo write a successful Institute of the type that Blackstone aimed to do, it was essential to sort out the theoretical structure, and to relate it to the first principles. Blackstone had great difficulty in making the common law fit into the structure for two reasons. First, his key sources of law were in effect marginalized, and played little part in explaining the substantive law. Second, his structure, which sought to relate all law to rights, failed to make sense of law in terms of rights. Blackstone was clearly impressed with the civilian method, which he described as ‘a collection of written reason’. He recognized the rivalry between English and Roman methods, and himself urged that it was more useful to know English law.“ However, he urged the study of English law in an ‘academical’ way, noting that the English law could be ‘a science, which distinguishes the criterions of right and wrong’: it was not necessarily antitheoretical. The thrust of the chapter in the Commentaries on the study of laws was that it had to be done academically. If the student can reason with precision, and separate argument from fallacy, by the clear simple rules of pure unsophisticated logic; if he can fix his attention, and steadily pursue truth through any the most intricate deduction, by the use of mathematical demonstrations;\n\nif he has enlarged his conceptions of nature\n\nand art, by a view of the several branches of genuine, experimental, philosophy; if he has impressed on his mind the sound maxims of the law of nature, the best and most authentic foundation of human laws; if, lastly, he has contemplated those maxims reduced to a practical system in the laws of imperial Rome . . . a student thus qualified may enter upon the study of law with incredible advantage and reputation.*\n\nIt is significant that Blackstone was attempting this reconciliation of the analytical method and the common law content, for he was thereby asserting that it was not enough to see the English law as reasonable, to have a collection of rules which could be rationalized in the light of some external test: instead, he was trying to show that reason was embodied in the English law. For that reason, the Roman structure was essential.\n\nThe fact that Blackstone was following an Institutional structure 3 1 Comm.\n\n5.\n\n4 1 Comm. 27.\n\n# 1 Comm. 5-6.\n\n* 1 Comm. 33.\n\n28\n\nThe Common Law and the Commentaries\n\nexplains his introductory section on law in general and his use of the law of nature, something that has created comment since Bentham’s famous attack. If it is borne in mind that he was using this format, the position of natural law becomes clearer, for it was the custom to begin such works with a discourse on natural law, and to relate the structure to it. Blackstone was following convention in putting it forward as the key to the law: his problems came in making the structure fit the theory. Unlike Domat, Blackstone had not resolved the ends of law, nor did he define what he meant by the law of nature. Instead, he borrowed ideas from other writers he hoped could resolve the problem: in the section on the nature of laws, he relied heavily on Burlamaqui, who had used Pufendorf’s view of natural law.” This created a problem for Blackstone in that it threw up a view of law which he sought to marginalize. For Pufendorf, all law was the command of a superior, with the result that where there was no Divine or Human law, there could be no wrong act—all would be indifferent. Human society and sovereignty was based on consent, not force, according to Pufendorf, but in conferring power to the sovereign, the subjects obliged themselves to non-resistance and to obedience.‘” Furthermore, in as much as the Law of Nature cannot, amongst a great multitude, be conveniently exercis’d without the Assistance of Civil Government, ‘tis manifest that God, who imposed the said Law on the Human Race, did command likewise the establishing of Civil Societies, so far as they serve for Instruments and Means of improving and enforcing the Law of Nature.”\n\nAs a consequence of the sovereign being a means to the furthering of natural law in civil society, it was supreme and above human laws. The sovereign’s laws concerned matters to be observed by the subjects for the public good of the state: to bring Divine Laws into the question against these was ‘no less absurd than impious’.*! In this way, Pufendorf could reconcile a strong positive law with ” See P. Lucas, ‘Ex parte Sir William Blackstone’. Opinions on Blackstone’s intellectual debts focus on his debts to European natural lawyers. Sir Henry Maine said that Blackstone had followed Burlamaqui (Ancient Law (London, 1861), 114); Holdsworth felt Blackstone had followed Grotius via Burlamaqui (History of English Law, xii, 733); while Joseph W. McKnight said that Blackstone borrowed, but did not\n\nplagiarize Burlamaqui. ‘Blackstone, Quasi-Jurisprudent’, Southwestern Law Journal, xiii (1959), 399-411. # S.

For Pufendorf, while the laws of nature were of universal obligation, ‘it is the Civil Power that gives them the force of Laws in the Civil Court’.> Blackstone’s theorizing echoed this view in his view of society in a confused way. In a state of nature, Blackstone wrote, there would be only natural law, ‘for a law always supposes some superior who is to\n\nmake it’ which in the natural state could only be God.” However, men were incapable of living in this fragmented way, and hence they needed societies and states. This helps explain Blackstone’s view of municipal law: it either declared (and was subordinate to) the law of nature or legislated for indifferent matters.°* Municipal law was defined as ‘a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state, commanding what is right and prohibiting what is wrong’. Blackstone’s editor, Edward Christian, pointed to the flaws in this definition: either it meant that all that the law commanded was ipso facto right—in which case ‘commanding right’ was tautologous—or it meant that right and wrong could be referred to the law of nature. Christian felt that the latter idea was absurd, since the law often forbade what was morally justifiable,° and he therefore inferred that municipal law was whatever was commanded, and that morals did not enter into the question. For Blackstone, sovereignty and the legislature were convertible terms, but they were not to be equated with the people as a whole. His view of the sovereign had Hobbesian premisses. Arguing that man’s weakness drove him into society, he contended that government merited total obedience, if men were to avoid a return to the state of nature.” Whatever was ordered by the sovereign legislature had to be obeyed, or else the constitution would be at an end—which was for Blackstone the worst eventuality. The boundaries of right and wrong were therefore set by law: even when it came to declaring natural law, this was down to ‘the will and wisdom of the legislature’ rather than to an autonomous law of nature itself. Immutable laws had no validity unless they were confirmed by the sovereign. Therefore, absolute rights derived from what was allowed by law: ‘The absolute rights of every Englishman *2 Ibid. VIIL.i.1, p. 1. = 1 Comm. 42. * 1 Comm. (1803 edn.) 44n. ” 1 Comm. 48.\n\n81 Comm. 43. 1 Comm. 44. ® 1 Comm. 53.\n\n30\n\nThe Common Law and the Commentaries\n\n... as they are founded on nature and reason, so they are coeval with our form of government, though subject at times to fluctuate and change: their establishment (excellent as it is) being still human.” Blackstone’s sovereign was therefore supreme. There was no fixed form of government, and the legislature could put the execution of the laws into new hands: ‘obedience to superiors is the doctrine of revealed as well as of natural religion: but who those superiors shall be, and in what circumstances . . . is the province of human laws to determine’.” Whatever constitution was established, he said, ‘there is and must be in all of them a supreme, irresistible, absolute, uncontrolled authority, in which the jura summi imperii, or the rights of sovereignty, reside’.*' In England, this gave parliament absolute despotic powers, with uncontrollable authority to alter every facet of law and the constitution. For Blackstone, parliament ‘can, in short, do every thing that is not naturally impossible . .. what they do, no authority upon earth can undo’.°? Even if parliament decreed something against the law of nature, it would still have to be obeyed.*? This positivist concept of law contrasted with his initial arguments that the source of human laws was a more direct law of nature, to be derived from reason, the pursuit of happiness, and revelation.™ His initial definition was potentially compatible with a customary view of society, but Blackstone preferred a contractarian vision of the relationship of individuals to the sovereign. However, he remained very uncomfortable with the notion of the contract, and therefore minimized the natural right to rebel. Although he acknowledged the right in theory, he denied it in practice and in law, for he argued that just as the sovereign was legally without limit, so the law could not acknowledge the possibility of its own end, as would occur in a revolution. While the constitution subsisted, the"
