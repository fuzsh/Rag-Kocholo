The introduction outlines how the late H. R. Tedder, longtime secretary and librarian of the Athenaeum Club, began work on a history of the club based on minutes and reports but passed away in 1924 before completing it. The current writer was then tasked with finishing Tedder's work, rearranging and rewriting the material he left behind. The result is a history of the Athenaeum Club from 1824 to 1925 told through extracts from records and brief biographical notes on early committee members, intended to increase the human interest and recall those who first organized the club, now long forgotten.",
