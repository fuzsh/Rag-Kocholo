It is hardly necessary to state that the Compiler of an Annotated Register of Rugby School does not pretend to entire accuracy or completeness. His object has been to place upon record the doings of Old Rugbeians, with a notice of the principal distinctions gained by them, and, although delay in the present publication would have insured greater accuracy and completeness, the Com- piler has thought it desirable that, as the work has been called for by many Old Rugbeians, it should appear in its present form, leaving imperfections to be corrected and omissions supplied in a future Edition. The Compiler has availed himself of the published researches of the late Rev. Thomas Lawrence Bloxam, which will be found acknowledged by the initial of that staunch supporter of the School; and he desires to record his recognition of the assistance of many Old Rugbeians. The present Register is a transcript of the Headmaster's Book, in which the names of all new boys are entered,— with the exception that discovered errors have been corrected. IV PREFACE. Old Rugbeians and friends of the School will greatly oblige by notifying to Mr. Lawrence, Bookseller, Rugby, any inaccuracies or omissions in the present Volume. They are also requested to forward to him any statements worthy of record with regard to Old Rugbeians who have entered the School since the commencement of Dr. Goulburn's Headmastership in April, 1850, with a view to insertion in the Second Volume, which it is proposed to complete to the current date.

His first publication was a defence of King Charles I. from the charge of being privy to the Irish massacre. At the accession of George I. he refused the Oaths. He was afterwards secretary to Bishop Atterbury, and when that prelate was committed to the Tower, a reward of ^1000 was offered for apprehending Mr. Carte, who escaped to France, where he remained till Queen Caroline obtained permission for him to return to England. He next published a History of England, in 3 vols, folio. In 1736 appeared his life of James, Duke of Ormond, in 3 vols, folio. The 4th, which ends with 1654, appeared after his death. His accuracy was such that he has been called \" the Historian of Facts,\" and Hume borrowed largely from the work. Besides the above he published a collection of original letters and papers relating to the affairs of England, in 2 vols. 8vo., a History of the Revolutions of Portugal, and some other pieces. His manuscripts are in the Bodleian Library. Carte died in the year 1754, and was buried in a vault in the chancel of Yattenden Church, Berkshire.

He died May 31, 1780. * John Mansel in early life joined the Regiment of the Third Dragoon Guards, and rose to the rank of Major-General. He had the command of a brigade of heavy cavalry in the Duke of York's campaign in 1794. Being impatient on one occasion of an un- deserved imputation on his zeal, the General, when the French attacked the Duke of York's army, on the 26th of April, devoted himself to death, and his troops animated by his example performed prodigies of valour. He came up with the enemy in the village of Cawdry, charged, and completely defeated them. He then rushed at the head of his brigade against a battery of fourteen pieces of cannon, placed on an eminence behind a deep ravine, into which many of the front rank fell. He passed the ravine with a considerable body of men, and charged the cannon with inconceivable intrepidity and complete success. This event is said to have decided the day : but at the mouth of this battery the brave and worthy General, after having three horses killed under him in the course of the day, received his death wound ; one grape shot entered his chin, fracturing the spine and coming out between the shoulders, and another broke his arm to splinters. His son and aide-de-camp, Major John Christopher Mansel (also a Rugbeian, see year 1781), anxious to save his father's life, darted forwards, but was wounded and taken prisoner. On the 29th, the General was buried in a redoubt at the head of the camp. Six Generals supported the pall, and the Duke of York, the Stadtholder, the hereditary Prince of Orange, and all the officers of the army attended the funeral. — B. 34 1745—47. Bruce Hon.

Died, 1783. ^ William Bray was born at Shere, in Surrey, on the 7th of November, 1 736. He was descended from Sir Nicolas Bray, the faithful minister of Henry the Seventh, and in the tenth year of his age was placed at Rugby School. Whilst at school he found some difficulty in gratifying his passion for reading, there being in his days no regular bookseller in Rugby. An itinerant bookseller from Daventry was however accustomed to open a stall at Rugby on market days, to whom the boys resorted. A number of the Rambler, which was then in the course of publication, having fallen into Bray's hands, he ordered the same from the Daventry bookseller, who mistaking his commission procured all the numbers which had then appeared : these, amounting to the sum of nine shillings, completely exhausted Bray's purse, and, as he in after-life was wont to declare, nearly ruined him. On his leaving school he was articled to an attorney, and at the termination of his clerkship he obtained a situation in the Board of Green Cloth, which he continued to hold for near fifty years. In 1801, on the death of Mr. Manning, who had commenced a History of Surrey, Mr. Bray undertook to complete the same, and composed the whole of the second and third volumes of that work, the latter of which was published in the year 1814. In 1803 he was elected Treasurer to the Antiquarian Society. Several of his papers are published in the Archaeologia. For many years before his death he was the oldest Rugbeian living, and until he was obliged to desist through age, was a con- stant attendant at the Rugby School meetings in London, and always retained an affectionate regard for his own School. He closed a life actively and usefully engaged at the age of ninety-seven, on the 21st December, 1832, at Shere. A mural monument is erected to his memory in the church of Shere. — B. 1748—49. 35 Entrances iti 1748. Chambers Thomas, son of Chambers, Esq.

Dunchurch, Warwickshire '^ Sir Ralph Abercromby was born in the year 1738. He was descended from an ancient family in the county of Banff. When ten years old he was placed at Rugby. While there, ** Duke William \" of Cumberland, the hero of CuUoden, was on one occasion passing through Hillmorton and Dunchurch in his carriage-and-six, a circumstance which old inhabitants of Rugby used to speak of as one of the most memorable events of their lives; and it is recorded that all the boys in the School ran over to see him with the exception of Abercromby. On leaving Rugby he obtained his first commission as a Cornet in the Guards, and a Lieutenancy in 1760. In 1762 he became Captain in the 3rd Regiment of Horse, in which corps he rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in 1773. Major-General in 1787, and given the command of the 7th Regiment of Dragoons in the following year. He was employed on the Continent under the Duke of York in 1796. He commanded the advance guard in the action of Cateau, for which he was honourably mentioned in the Duke of York's despatches. Wounded at Nemeguen, and conducted the retreat of the troops out of Holland in the winter of 1796. The next year he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in the West Indies, where he took possession of several French and Dutch settlements. On returning to Europe he was rewarded with the Order of the Bath, and made Governor of Fort George and Fort Augustus, and Lieutenant-General in 1797. He was next fixed on to take the command of the troops in Ireland, where he exerted himself with great ability in suppressing the rebellion. He was lastly called upon to take the command of an army to dispossess the French of Egypt. Here he landed with the troops March 8, 1801, and defeated the French at Aboukir after a bloody action. On the 2 1st of the same month was fought near Alexandria a memorable battle, in which the English were again victorious, but with the loss of their gallant general, who died the 28th, on board the ship which was conveying him to Malta, in the great church of which island he was buried with military honours. A marble slab with an inscription denotes the place of his interment. A public monument was voted to his memory, and a peerage and pension bestowed upon his family. In 1774 Sir Ralph represented the County of Kinross in Parliament, and continued in that capacity till the general election in 1780. He was father to the Speaker of the House of Commons. Such was the affection Sir Ralph entertained for the place of his education, that he was actually on the point of setting out to pay a long contemplated visit to his old school, when he was stopped by a notification of his appointment to the command of the troops embarking for Egypt, where his life was so gloriously closed. — {Vide Memoir published by his grandson.

The Duke's only sister. Lady Jane Douglas, married at the age of forty-seven Colonel Stewart, afterwards Sir John Stewart, Bart., by whom, at Paris, in 1748, she had twin sons, Archibald and Sholto, the latter of whom died an infant. But the family of Hamilton, who were the next collateral heirs male, suspected the truth of this birth under such extraordinary cir- cumstances, and infused their suspicions into the mind of the aged Duke that the children were suppositious. But at length his Grace seems to have been finally satisfied. He made proper enquiries concerning the birth of Archibald, and saw and conversed with the woman servant that went over to France with his sister, and who was said to have been present at her delivery. It was about this time that an old Scotch servant, probably sent by the Duke of Douglas, came to Rugby. The boys were assembled together in the School by Mr. Burrough, and this servant, who had never yet seen young Douglas, was introduced amongst them. In a short time he was enabled to identify Archibald, and select him from the other boys from his likeness to the Douglas family. At length the Duke was convinced of his sister's honour, of the legitimacy of her child, and made an entail of his estates accordingly. After the Duke's death, in 1761, an action was commenced in behalf of the Duke of Hamilton, a minor, against Archibald, in which it w"
