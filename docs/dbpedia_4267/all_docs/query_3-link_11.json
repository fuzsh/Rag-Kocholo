Dec. 29, 1917, Calvert, Texas - d. Sept. 29, 1998, Los Angeles, Calif.), U.S. politician. He won a City Council seat in Los Angeles in 1963 and ran for mayor six years later, losing a bitter election tinged with racist rhetoric to Sam Yorty; the scars of the 1965 Watts riots were still fresh. In 1973, Bradley ran again and this time beat Yorty with 56% of the vote, becoming the first black mayor of Los Angeles. In 1981, Bradley, running as a Democrat, lost the governor's race to Republican George Deukmejian by less than 1 percentage point. He lost a second bid for governor in 1986. The five-term mayor (1973-93) was credited with opening city government to minorities and women, expanding social services to the urban poor, and spurring economic growth. Under his administration, Los Angeles surpassed San Francisco as the West Coast's economic power in Pacific Rim trading, symbolized by the downtown skyline that grew during his administration. The successful 1984 Olympic Games stood out as his crowning achievement. The economic ruin and traffic gridlock many feared never materialized. The low point was in 1992, when riots broke out after four white LAPD officers were acquitted in the beating of black motorist Rodney King. Bradley appealed for calm, but some said his angry denunciation of the verdicts may have provoked violence. He would later describe the violence that left 55 people dead as \"the most painful experience of my life.\" He governed quietly, by building coalitions instead of using the bully pulpit. Beginning in 1989, Bradley became embroiled in a political scandal involving his acceptance of a fee for serving as an adviser for a bank doing business with the city. At 75, he announced his retirement, avoiding an election he probably could not have won.\n\nBradley, William O('Connell) (b. March 18, 1847, near Lancaster, Garrard county, Ky. - d. May 23, 1914, Washington, D.C.), governor of Kentucky (1895-99). He was also a U.S. senator from Kentucky (1909-14).\n\nBradshaw\n\nBradshaw, Robert L(lewellyn) (b. Sept. 16, 1916, St. Paul's, St. Kitts - d. May 23, 1978, St. Kitts), West Indian politician. In 1940 he founded St. Kitts's trade and labour union and Labour Party. He became a member of the Legislative Council in 1946 and sat in the West Indies Federal Parliament as federal minister of finance (1958-62). When the federation dissolved, he returned to St. Kitts as minister without portfolio until 1966. After briefly serving as chief minister (1966-67), he became premier of St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla in 1967, when the three islands became an independent state in association with the U.K. He died in office. In 1998 he was posthumously awarded the Order of National Hero, giving him the title The Right Excellent Sir Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw, Knight Grand Commander of the Order of National Hero (K.G.N.H.).\n\nBrady, James H(enry) (b. June 12, 1862, Indiana county, Pa. - d. Jan. 13, 1918, Washington, D.C.), governor of Idaho (1909-11). He was also a U.S. senator from Idaho (1913-18).\n\nBrady, John G(reen) (b. May 25, 1848, New York City - d. Dec. 17, 1918, Sitka, Alaska), governor of Alaska (1897-1906).\n\nBrady, Nicholas F(rederick) (b. April 11, 1930, New York City), U.S. treasury secretary (1988-93).\n\nBrady, Vincent (b. March 14, 1936, Dublin, Ireland - d. Oct. 6, 2020, Dublin), defence minister of Ireland (1991-92).\n\nBrady Roche, Herman (Julio) (b. Feb. 10, 1921, Santiago, Chile - d. May 16, 2011, Santiago), defense minister of Chile (1975-78).

Brandt\n\nBrandt, Willy, original name Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm (b. Dec. 18, 1913, Lübeck, Germany - d. Oct. 8, 1992, Unkel, near Bonn, Germany), chancellor of West Germany (1969-74). When the Nazis came to power, his activities as a young Social Democrat brought him into conflict with the Gestapo, and he had to flee the country to escape arrest. He went to Norway (where he assumed the name Willy Brandt), and when the Germans occupied Norway he escaped to Sweden, where he remained for the duration of World War II. After the war he returned to Germany as a Norwegian citizen. Pressed to return to politics, he applied to renew his German citizenship in 1947 and was elected to the federal parliament in 1949. Later he became governing mayor of West Berlin (1957-66). He became chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 1964 and campaigned for the office of chancellor three times (1961, 1965, 1969). When the grand coalition of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats was formed in 1966, Brandt became foreign minister and vice-chancellor. In 1969 his party formed a coalition with the small Free Democratic Party. The year following his election as chancellor, he concentrated on foreign affairs and particularly sought to improve relations with East Germany, other Communist nations in eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union, formulating a policy known as Ostpolitik (\"eastern policy\"). Although fortified by a great SPD victory in 1972, he resigned in May 1974 after his close aide Günter Guillaume was unmasked as an East German spy. He remained SPD chairman until 1987 and was also head of the Socialist International from 1976 to 1992. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971 for his continuing work toward reconciliation between West Germany and the Soviet bloc.\n\nBrandt, Yoka, byname of Johanna Marie Geertrui Brandt (b. Jan. 30, 1958), Dutch diplomat. She has been ambassador to Eritrea (2000-04) and Uganda (2004-07) and permanent representative to the United Nations (2020- ).\n\nBrañes Farmer, Raúl (b.

Dec. 28, 1962, Visegrad [now in Republika Srpska], Bosnia and Herzegovina), prime minister of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (2007-09).\n\nBrann, Louis J(efferson) (b. July 6, 1876, Madison, Maine - d. Feb. 3, 1948, Falmouth, Maine), governor of Maine (1933-37).\n\nBrannan\n\nBrannan, Charles F(ranklin) (b. Aug. 23, 1903, Denver, Colo. - d. July 2, 1992, Denver), U.S. secretary of agriculture (1948-53). In 1935 he became assistant regional attorney of the Resettlement Administration, and later regional attorney in the Department of Agriculture's office of the solicitor. From November 1941 to April 1944 he was regional director of the Farm Security Administration for Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. He was named assistant secretary of agriculture in June 1944 and secretary of agriculture in June 1948. In 1949 Brannan put forward the \"Brannan plan\" for farm price supports to be based on a minimum farm purchasing power, which would be subsidized by government payments. This legislative proposal was not enacted by Congress, although Brannan and other administration leaders continued to press for it during 1950. He charged that failure to enact his plan was the cause of such occurrences as dumping millions of dollars of surplus agricultural products which had been purchased by the government. On Aug. 22, 1950, Brannan declared that the government had huge surpluses of dairy foods and dried eggs, in danger of spoiling if not given away. Under Pres. Harry S. Truman's defense mobilization plan announced Sept. 9, 1950, Brannan was given cognizance over food, farm equipment, and commercial fertilizer.\n\nBranstad\n\nBranstad, Terry E(dward) (b. Nov. 17, 1946, Leland, Iowa), governor of Iowa (1983-99, 2011-17). A Republican, he served in the Iowa House of Representatives (1973-79) and was lieutenant governor (1979-83). Benefiting from opponents' weaknesses, he won the governor's race with 53% in 1982 because his opponent had legally avoided paying her state taxes, with 52% in 1986 when his opponent backed a $400 million bond issue to be paid back from a lottery, and with 61% in 1990 against a weak winner of a multi-candidate primary. In 1994, he had primary opposition from Fred Grandy, familiar to TV viewers as Gopher in The Love Boat, but to Iowans as a hard-working, close-to-home congressman from the 5th District. Grandy called for a tax cut and attacked Branstad for \"a pattern of abuse and mismanagement.\" Branstad won by only 52%-48%. In the general, Branstad never had a secure lead in polls over Attorney General Bonnie Campbell, who attacked her own party's platform as too liberal; Grandy was openly hostile, saying of Branstad, \"I'll hold my nose and vote for the guy.\" But in the fall, with crime an issue, Branstad attacked Campbell for her opposition to the death penalty. And the strong Iowa economy evidently worked for the incumbent. Branstad won 58%-42%, carrying all but four counties. Des Moines, the most vibrantly growing part of the state, which voted against Branstad in 1982 and 1986, voted for him this time. Branstad, who had the strength to win when Iowa seemed mostly Democratic, now had the opportunity to lead when it was trending Republican. Incidentally, Branstad endorsed Bob Dole for president in 1996 - the first time he publicly endorsed a presidential candidate. In March 1997 he said he would not seek a fifth term. After a 12-year pause, however, he did so and defeated incumbent Democrat Chet Culver 53%-43% in 2010. In December 2015 he became the longest-serving governor in U.S. history, surpassing the tenure of almost 21 years of New York's George Clinton (1777-95, 1801-04). In 2017-20 he was ambassador to China.\n\nBranting, Karl Hjalmar (b. Nov. 23, 1860, Stockholm, Sweden - d. Feb. 24, 1925, Stockholm), finance minister (1917-18), prime minister (1920, 1921-23, 1924-25), and foreign minister (1921-23) of Sweden. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1921 (jointly with Christian Lous Lange of Norway).\n\nBrantley\n\nBrantley, Mark (Anthony Graham) (b. Jan. 11, 1969, Gingerland, Nevis), foreign minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis (2015-22) and premier of Nevis (2017- ).\n\nBrantsen van de Zijp, Derk Willem Gerhard Johan Hendrik baron (b. March 26, 1801, Rotterdam, Netherlands - d. ...), acting governor of Gelderland (1846-47).\n\nBrar, (Sardar) Harcharan Singh (b. Jan. 22, 1922, Sarai Naga village, Punjab, India - d. Sept. 6, 2009, Sarai Naga), governor of Orissa (1977) and Haryana (1977-79) and chief minister of Punjab (1995-96).\n\nBrasey, Louis Antoine Marie (b. May 31, 1891 - d. 19...), resident-superior of Laos (1941-45).\n\nBrash\n\nBrash, Don(ald Thomas) (b. Sept. 24, 1940, Wanganui, N.Z.), New Zealand politician. He was governor of the Reserve Bank (1988-2002) before entering parliament. In October 2003 he toppled Bill English as leader of the National Party. He was never a strong performer in the House and, although his apolitical image might initially have seemed an asset, doubts emerged about his political instincts. To the surprise of many observers, and indeed Brash himself, his Orewa speech in late January 2004 on race relations and separatism resonated strongly with the public. And he showed he had a ruthless streak in demoting the party's spokeswomen for Maori affairs (Georgina Te Heuheu) and welfare (Katherine Rich). But his political awkwardness persisted, as in his unconvincing denial of accusations in 2004 that he told United States officials that the nuclear propulsion ban would be \"gone by lunchtime.\" In the elections of September 2005, on the back of an aggressive tax-cut policy, National gained 39% of the party vote, not enough to have a realistic chance of forming a government but a huge improvement on its miserable 21% return in the 2002 election. Just before the election Brash was placed on the back foot over alleged meetings between himself and the secretive Exclusive Brethren sect. His clumsy efforts to explain what he had or had not known about Brethren campaign pamphlets reawakened doubts about his political judgment and credibility. His gaffes became all too regular, the final straw being his handling of emails which he claimed were stolen from his computer and which were used by Nicky Hager in his book The Hollow Men. He resigned as leader and as MP in November 2006. In April 2011 he became leader of the ACT New Zealand party, but he stepped down after a poor result (1 seat) in the November 2011 elections.\n\nBrasil, Ptolomeu de Assis (b.

June 2, 1821, Pitesti, Walachia [now in Romania] - d. May 16, 1891, Florica, Romania), prime minister (1868, 1876-81, 1881-88) and acting foreign minister (1885) of Romania; brother of Dimitrie C. Bratianu. He took part in the revolution of 1848 and became one of the four secretaries of the provisional government. He was one of the leaders of the party that rejected the Russian protectorate and the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire, aspiring instead to make of Romania an independent democratic state. Having been proscribed for his activity in the revolutionary cause, Bratianu withdrew to Paris, where he continued to work for the union and autonomy of the principalities of Moldavia and Walachia. He returned home in 1856. With the principalities subsequently united as Romania under Prince Alexandru Ioan, Bratianu founded the Romanian Liberal Party with his brother Dimitrie and in 1866 figured prominently in the deposing of Alexandru and the election as prince of Romania of Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, later (1881) King Carol I. He was finance minister (1866, 1867-68, 1876-77, 1877, 1880, 1880-81, 1881), interior minister (1867, 1867-68, 1877-78, 1878-79, 1880, 1882, 1887-88), war minister (1868, 1877-78, 1878-79, 1881-82, 1882-84, 1887-88), and president of the Chamber of Deputies (1868-69). As finance minister, he played an important role in designing the Romanian constitution of 1866. He was arrested following an abortive anti-dynastic coup in 1870 but was soon released. Aided by his longtime political ally C.A. Rosetti, Bratianu formed a Liberal government in 1876 and remained prime minister until 1888, except for a brief interval in 1881 when his brother took over the post. His autocratic, corrupt administration, which was redeemed somewhat by constitutional and land reforms and by his own personal character, was also marked by Romania's alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary (1883). He was compelled to resign in 1888 after a riotous outbreak in Bucharest, which was only suppressed after bloodshed.\n\nI.I.C. Bratianu\n\nV.

He was secretary (1934-40) and chairman (1945-46) of the party's youth section and edited its magazine. He remained in Norway after the German invasion (1940), joining the Resistance, but he was arrested in 1942 and spent the remainder of World War II in various concentration camps in Germany. After the war he became vice-chairman of the Labour Party (1945-65). He was elected to the Storting (parliament) in 1950 and under the premiership of Einar Gerhardsen served as finance minister (1951-55, 1956-60) and minister of transport and communications (1960-64). Bratteli succeeded as party leader in 1965, forming a minority government in March 1971. An advocate of Norwegian accession to the European Communities (EC), he resigned (October 1972) following the referendum by which EC membership was rejected. He returned to power a year later at the head of a coalition of the Labour and Socialist Alliance parties, but his defeat over the EC continued to cast a cloud over his political life, and eventually undermined his position. He resigned as chairman of the Labour Party (1975) and as prime minister (January 1976). He remained a member of parliament until 1981.\n\nBrattested, Merete Fjeld (b.

Sept. 22, 1932, Rokiskis, Lithuania - d. June 26, 2010, Vilnius, Lithuania), president (1992-98) and prime minister (2001-06) of Lithuania. He was minister of the building materials industry (1965-66), first secretary of the Communist Party (1988-89) and of the Independent Communist Party (1989-90), and chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (1990) of the Lithuanian S.S.R. In 1990 he transformed his party into the Lithuanian Democratic Labour Party (LDDP). Helping lead the country towards independence, he became acting president after the LDDP won a majority of seats in the general election for the new parliament in 1992, then in 1993 he became the first elected president. He did not stand for reelection in 1998 and returned to parliament to lead the LDDP. He united the political left behind the A. Brazauskas Social Democratic Coalition, which went on to electoral success in October 2000. Although his claims to the right to try and form a government were overlooked by Pres. Valdas Adamkus, the subsequently-formed right-wing coalition collapsed in June 2001. Brazauskas, now chairman of the new Lithuanian Social Democratic Party (formed by the merger in January of his LDDP with the existing LSDP), was called upon to form a government. Like before as president, he promoted Lithuania's economic freedom and eventual membership in the EU and NATO. He resigned in 2006 amid accusations of economic corruption, and the next year he retired as leader of the LSDP. Brazauskas was awarded Russia's Order of Honour in 2010 for his diplomatic role in strengthening cooperation and relations between Russia and Lithuania.\n\nBraze, Baiba (b.

He became a naturalized French citizen on Aug. 12, 1874, adopting the French spelling of his name.\n\nBreathitt, Edward T(hompson, Jr.), byname Ned Breathitt (b. Nov. 26, 1924, Hopkinsville, Ky. - d. Oct. 14, 2003, Lexington, Ky.), governor of Kentucky (1963-67). He was elected to the Kentucky House in 1951, serving from 1952 to 1958. He worked for Democratic presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson in 1952 and was on the campaign staff that returned former vice president Alben Barkley to the U.S. Senate in 1954. Racial harmony was a theme of Breathitt's inaugural speech as governor on Dec. 10, 1963. But Congress was debating a civil rights bill at the time, and state lawmakers were unwilling to take the lead in enacting a state civil rights law. The Breathitt administration's bill was later killed in committee. Finally, in 1966, Kentucky became the first southern state to enact a civil rights law, which went farther than the federal law in prohibiting racial discrimination in hiring. \"This is only a beginning,\" Breathitt said at the bill-signing ceremony. \"Only in the human heart can justice win the final victory.\" Later governors appointed Breathitt to the Council on Higher Education and the governing boards of Morehead State University, Kentucky State University, and the University of Kentucky, where he spent seven more years as trustees chairman. He became the Southern Railway System's general counsel after leaving the governorship, moved to Washington, D.C., as a vice president in 1972 and was the company's top lobbyist for 20 years.\n\nBreathitt, John (b. Sept. 9, 1786, Henry county, Va. - d. Feb. 21, 1834, Frankfort, Ky.), governor of Kentucky (1832-34).\n\nBrechalov\n\nBrechalov, Aleksandr (Vladimirovich) (b. Nov. 18, 1973, Tlustenkhabl, Adygey autonomous oblast, Russian S.F.S.R.), head of the republic of Udmurtia (2017- ).\n\nBreckinridge, John (b. Dec. 2, 1760, near Staunton, Virginia - d.

Jan. 21, 1821, near Lexington, Ky. - d. May 17, 1875, Lexington), U.S. vice president (1857-61); grandson of John Breckinridge. He began his political career in 1849 as a member of the Kentucky legislature. In 1851 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. During this troubled antebellum period, he established his reputation as a faithful Democrat, and when his party nominated James Buchanan of Pennsylvania for president in 1856, Breckinridge was a natural choice to \"balance the ticket\" between North and South. Once in office, however, Buchanan and Breckinridge were unable to fend off the sectional conflict. Challenged by the newly formed Republican Party, which resisted extension of slavery into the territories, the Democrats broke apart at their national convention in the summer of 1860. The Northern wing nominated Stephen A. Douglas on a platform favouring popular sovereignty (local option), while the Southerners chose Breckinridge on a separate ticket demanding federal intervention in behalf of slave property in the territories. Defeated in the November election by Republican Abraham Lincoln, Breckinridge succeeded John J. Crittenden as U.S. senator from Kentucky in March 1861, but he resigned later that year. He never ceased working for accommodation and compromise, but after the firing on Ft. Sumter, S.C. (April 12), he maintained that the Union no longer existed. He was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in November. After the Battle of Shiloh (April 6-7, 1862), in which he commanded the reserve, he was promoted to the rank of major general and thereafter took part in many campaigns. In the final months of the war, Breckinridge served as Confederate secretary of war.\n\nBredal, Johan Olaf (b.

Sept. 30, 1941, Hartford, Conn.), head of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq (2003-04). He joined the U.S. diplomatic corps in 1967, serving at the embassies in Afghanistan, Malawi, and Norway, and as a special assistant to Henry Kissinger in 1972-76 and to Alexander Haig in the early 1980s. He was named ambassador to the Netherlands by Pres. Ronald Reagan in 1983, and ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism in 1986. On retiring from the foreign service in 1989, he became a managing director of the Kissinger Group, a consultancy on international issues, until 2000. He was appointed chair of the National Commission on Terrorism in 1999. In May 2003 he replaced Lt.Gen. Jay Garner as the top civilian administrator of occupied Iraq. Reporting to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Bremer's role was to oversee the U.S.-led occupation until such time as the transition could be made to Iraqi self-rule. He was empowered to issue decrees and oversee reconstruction efforts and the creation of new institutions and governing structures. The first orders he issued were to ban members of the Ba`th Party from holding public office, and to disband the Iraqi army; these decisions have been widely criticized as major causes of the insurgency in the course of which over 100,000 people were killed. In July 2003 he appointed an Iraqi interim governing council, but had veto powers over its proposals. He faced major challenges in restoring law and order and power supplies, and in dealing with insurgents. He remained in charge until the formal return of sovereignty to the interim Iraqi government on June 28, 2004.\n\nBremner, Claude Edward Urquhart (b. Aug. 30, 1891, India - d.

He served as a chief petty officer during World War II in a submarine in the Pacific, but when he returned to civilian life he quickly became more involved in union activities. In 1957, Brennan was elected president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, an umbrella organization of unions with 250,000 members at the time. He was also president of the council's New York State counterpart and served as vice president of the state AFL-CIO. Brennan rose to national prominence in 1970 when he organized 100,000 construction workers to rally for Pres. Richard Nixon's policies on the Vietnam War. A counterdemonstration by Vietnam War opponents led to a clash with the workers, and many antiwar protesters were beaten. Nixon thanked Brennan for the support by inviting him to the White House and presenting him with a white hard hat stamped with an American flag and the title \"Commander in Chief.\" The links that Nixon formed with the rank and file of traditionally Democratic unions contributed to his landslide re-election in 1972. Nixon nominated Brennan as secretary of labor not long after the election, and Brennan held the post from Feb. 2, 1973, until Pres. Gerald Ford replaced him in 1975. During his tenure, he was credited with helping strengthen pension plan safeguards and worker safety enforcement. But he clashed with AFL-CIO President George Meany on minimum wage policy. Ford offered Brennan the post of ambassador to Ireland, but Brennan declined and returned to New York, where he resumed the presidency of the construction trades council.\n\nBrenner, Ernst (b.

By 1939 he had become a secretary of the party committee of Dnepropetrovsk oblast. During World War II he served as a political commissar in the Red Army. He was first secretary of the party committees of Zaporozhye (1946-47) and Dnepropetrovsk (1947-50) oblasti. In 1950 he was sent to Moldavia as first secretary of the Moldavian Communist Party. In 1952 he became a member of the Central Committee of the CPSU and a candidate member of the Politburo, but he lost those posts after Stalin's death (March 1953). In 1955 he became first secretary of the Kazakhstan Communist Party, and in 1956 he was reelected to his posts on the CPSU Central Committee and the Politburo. A year later, Brezhnev was made a full member of the Politburo, and in 1960 he became chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (titular head of state). In July 1964 he resigned that post to become Nikita Khrushchev's assistant as second secretary of the Central Committee, by which time he was considered Khrushchev's heir apparent as party leader. Three months later, however, he helped lead the coalition that forced Khrushchev from power, and became (Oct. 15, 1964) first secretary of the CPSU (after 1966, general secretary). During the 1970s he attempted to normalize relations between West Germany and the Warsaw Pact and to ease tensions with the United States through the policy known as détente. He was elected chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in June 1977, thus becoming the first person in Soviet history to hold both the leadership of the party and of the state.

In 1894 he succeeded in getting the sharply divided French trade unionists to adopt the general strike as a political tactic at a workers' congress at Nantes. After three unsuccessful attempts (1889, 1893, and 1898) to be elected to the Chamber of Deputies, Briand became secretary-general of the Socialist Party in 1901. In 1902 he finally won election as a deputy from the Loire département and remained a member of the chamber until his death. Briand's first great success in government came with his work on the commission that drafted a law of separation of church and state in 1905. This achievement led to his appointment as minister of public instruction and fine arts (1906-08) and worship (1906-11), but his acceptance of a post in a bourgeois cabinet widened his break with Jean Jaurès and other Socialists. He also held the portfolios of justice (1908-09, 1912-13, 1914-15), interior (1909-11, 1913), and defense (interim, 1911). In 1909 he became premier for the first time. His successes were the Pact of Locarno (1925), in which he, Gustav Stresemann of Germany, and Austen Chamberlain of Britain sought to normalize relations between Germany and its former enemies; and the Kellogg-Briand Pact (Aug. 27, 1928), in which 60 nations agreed to outlaw war as an instrument of national policy. His efforts for international cooperation, the League of Nations, and world peace brought him the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1926, which he shared with Stresemann. In December 1930 Briand publicly, and boldly for the times, advocated a federal union of Europe. He finally retired in January 1932, after an unsuccessful campaign for the French presidency in 1931.\n\nBriare, Bill, byname of William H. Briare (b. July 13, 1930, Long Beach, Calif. - d.

Jan. 21, 2015, London), British politician. After two unsuccessful attempts to enter Parliament he became member for the Yorkshire constituency of Cleveland and Whitby in 1974. He was appointed minister of state at the Home Office when the Conservatives won power in 1979. Two years later he joined the cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury. He was the youngest member of the cabinet formed after the June 1983 election. Appointed home secretary at the age of 43, he was the youngest to hold that office since Winston Churchill in 1910-11. He found himself somewhat uneasily poised between the reformist tradition of the old Conservative Party and the monetarists of the new right. In economics he was a convinced monetarist; as home secretary his instincts were for humane and rational reforms, which set him apart from the simplistic prejudices of some of the Tory right wing. Nevertheless, when the Commons debated (and rejected) restoration of capital punishment, favoured by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher among other Conservatives, his equivocal stance disappointed abolitionists. In 1985 he was appointed secretary of state for trade and industry. After four months, however, he was forced to resign. He was engaged in a battle with Michael Heseltine, the defense secretary, over a small, ailing helicopter company, Westland PLC. The issue was trivial but was inflated into a row that at one point threatened Thatcher's government. Heseltine was forced to resign in January 1986 - followed later that month by Brittan's resignation. On Thatcher's nomination he was knighted (1989) and became a member (for competition 1989-93, trade 1993-99, and external relations with North America and certain Pacific Rim countries 1995-99) and a vice president (1989-93, 1995-99) of the European Commission. In 2000 he was created a life peer.\n\nBritto, Antônio, Filho (b. July 1, 1952, Santana do Livramento, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), governor of Rio Grande do Sul (1995-99).

In 1947 he won a seat in the Rio Grande do Sul state legislature for the Brazilian Labor Party, which he had joined two years earlier. He rose quickly through the party ranks and in 1954 was elected to the federal congress. One year later he was elected mayor of Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul. In 1958 he won the state's gubernatorial race and during his four-year tenure expropriated - without compensation - U.S.-owned utility companies. In 1962 he was again elected to the lower house Chamber of Deputies, this time for the state of Guanabara (now part of Rio de Janeiro). In 1964, the armed forces overthrew leftist president Goulart; he and Brizola went into exile. Brizola, one of Brazil's most skilled public speakers, was widely viewed as Goulart's successor in the presidential elections scheduled for 1965, and some observers said he was the real target of the coup, which ushered in a military dictatorship that lasted 21 years. Brizola organized the so-called \"Groups of 11,\" armed cells designed to resist the dictatorship. After living in Uruguay, the U.S., and Portugal, he returned to Brazil in 1979, when Pres. João Figueiredo signed an amnesty law. He quickly returned to politics, founding the Democratic Labor Party and getting elected as governor of Rio de Janeiro in 1982 and 1990. He ran for president in 1989, but was narrowly edged out from the runoff by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Brizola took another stab at the presidency in 1994 and lost and in 1998 was Lula's running mate in an election won by Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He ran for mayor of Rio de Janeiro in 2000 but got just 9% of the vote.\n\nBrizuela (Boillat) de Ávila, María Eugenia (de Ávila by marriage), byname Mayu Brizuela (b.

In 1894 he entered the diplomatic service and in 1909 he was appointed consul-general at Budapest. As German minister in Copenhagen (1912-18), he supported the Danish policy of neutrality during World War I and was able to maintain German-Danish trade. In the later stages of the war he was widely regarded as the coming leader of German foreign policy, but his services were not called upon until, after the collapse, he was appointed foreign minister in the revolutionary government in December 1918, a post in which he was confirmed when, after the meeting of the National Assembly at Weimar in February 1919, the first republican government emerged. At the Paris peace conference he argued in vain for better conditions of peace for Germany. Unable to dissuade his government from ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, he resigned his post as foreign minister in June 1919. In 1922 he became the first German ambassador to the Soviet Union, where he and Soviet statesman Georgy Chicherin worked to consolidate the German-Soviet rapprochement inaugurated by the Treaty of Rapallo.

He lost his seat in 1945 but was later adopted as candidate for Hampstead, returned to the House of Commons in 1950, and remained there until 1966, when he was made a life peer. Brooke's first ministerial appointment was in 1954, when he became financial secretary to the Treasury, and three years later he joined the cabinet as minister of housing and local government. There he was responsible for carrying through his predecessor's Rent Bill which was strongly criticized as being biased against tenants and in favour of landlords. In 1961 Brooke assumed the newly created post of chief secretary to the Treasury and a year later became home secretary (1962-64). A hardliner, he was a controversial figure who had to face strong opposition in Parliament, where his debating skills were not always effective. His decision to deport Chief Anthony Enahoro to face a treason charge in Nigeria, and his attitude on immigration made him the target of attack by liberals. Defeated in the 1966 general election, he later took an active role in the House of Lords. He was made a privy councillor in 1955 and a Companion of Honour in 1964.\n\nBrooke of Sutton Mandeville, Peter (Leonard) Brooke, Baron (b. March 3, 1934, London, England - d.
