It has been made possible thus far only through the wonderfully dedicated and devoted efforts of many choice and gracious souls far too numerous to acknowledge here, whose willing responsiveness has truly been a thing of beauty to behold. Only through the repeated redoubling of such efforts now and in the future can it ever become, as hoped and projected, a record worthy of all acceptation. Much has been done; much more remains to be done, even much more than has been heretofore.\n\nThe primary reasons for releasing copies of this material, such as it is, at this stage, are principally twofold - firstly to satiate in some part or measure the honest, eager and enthusiastic appetites of so many who have waited so patiently for so long, by showing as much as we now know; and, secondly, to serve as a sort of mammoth questionnaire, by showing also just how very much we do not now know. The latter is most crucial, and we must now again appeal for help in general as never before in improving the nature and quality of the data here presented. May the enclosed work serve as a catalyst which will stir an added impetus and incentive in impelling all of us ever onward toward that grand and noble objective.\n\nPermission is hereby willingly and gladly granted and the invitation openly extended for any and all interested parties anywhere to freely reproduce, copy or distribute at will at any time, by any means, in whole or in part, whatever information may be desired from the contents hereof. Indeed we strongly urge and encourage the continued dissemination of this material from one to another on a scale as wide as practicable and possible. In return we only at this time ask, prevail upon and implore each and every individual obtaining access to it to very diligently pore over it and most thoroughly peruse to his or her satisfaction those portions of which he or she may possess some degree of personal knowledge and awareness, ascertaining all the while the particular extent of completeness and correctness of the facts there represented. We simultaneously beseech each and every person to specifically seek out and assess as many errors or omissions as may come to light, and to carefully note also any and all recollections or clues, however vague or obscure, which might conceivably have a bearing or influence in any way at all upon the course of future research for further relevant items now missing from the collection. Finally, we beg each and every party who can possibly do so in any way, to ensure that as many discrepancies or needed improvements as can be found by them upon such examination will be communicated to us or brought to our attention for consideration and action, regardless of how minor or insignificant a given point may at the moment seem. It cannot be overstated or overstressed that nothing is ever too small or too unimportant.\n\nAfter much consideration as to efficiency and effectiveness, the present loose-leaf format has been developed and adopted for this work for reasons stated in the \"Explanatory Notes\" section of the larger, expanded version which was previously made available to a very few members on an experimental basis. Owing to the reactions and responses received, that rather heavy, bulky format has now been relegated only to the official Master Copy, and the enclosed records are here presented in a much more compact, consolidated, yet still complete, fashion. The entries herein contained precisely and exactly parallel the larger Group Sheets earlier employed, and every item of information included therein is also identically reproduced here, with the exception that the blank lines and empty spaces have been eliminated or replaced by question marks in the interest of reducing and conserving space, and the text has also been more solidly condensed into this smaller, more compressed arrangement for the sake of convenience and according to the requirements expressed and requested. The general principle of the Group Sheet method itself has in recent years become so universally well-recognised that it seems no longer necessary to reprint in this abridgement the many pages of instructions previously designated \"Explanatory Notes\", and they have thus been omitted, likewise for the sake of fewer pages and more manageability. They are, however, obtainable should anyone desire to insert them hereafter.\n\nThere are a variety of other reasons also for finally settling upon retention of the loose-leaf method upon which the former procedure was based. As before, the entire compilation is thus safeguarded against obsolescence. For our own part, whenever even the slightest detail by way either of correction or update is submitted to us, we shall accordingly, as speedily as may reasonably be in the circumstances, endeavour to prepare a revision of the page or pages affected, and proceed to forward a replacement to all persons known to possess copies. Thus all volumes in individual hands will hopefully still be kept entirely parallel and identical in every way both to each other and to the Master Copy itself, insofar as available facts permit. Accordingly we highly recommend that all those obtaining or having possession of a copy of this compilation or any part of it should be certain to register same with us, simply because this is the only means by which we can possibly know to whom updates and revisions ought to regularly be sent as we are ourselves apprised of such changes and new facts. Inasmuch as the special \"Book of Remembrance\" album cover or binder prepared for the larger Group Sheets will not properly fit this reduced format, it is further recommended that this work be placed in a standard ring binder or prong folder of such type, style and quality as the individual may select in accordance with his or her own preferences and personal tastes.\n\nLastly of all, in closing we wish each and every one of you, in all sincerity, the utmost success and happiness in all your endeavours, genealogical and otherwise, and we shall certainly very deeply and gratefully appreciate hearing at any time from anyone whose desire it is to write. Your comments, opinions, observations, suggestions and corrections will also all be most eagerly anticipated indeed.\n\nLINKING AND ARRANGEMENT OF ENTRIES\n\n(Abbreviated Summary)\n\n(It has been deemed expedient, advisable and desirable to extract, insert and include in abridged and amended form herein, as points of information for general distribution, only the following reduced versions of two items of explanation from our former more expanded and voluminous Explanatory Notes previously published and issued on limited scale. The remainder, owing to their bulk, and being for the most part largely if not principally merely matters of organisational policy and procedural guidelines, have now been fully reconsidered and found primarily redundant and unnecessary to this manuscript, inasmuch as the greater applicability of their design in fact tends moreover toward the larger, more formal or official Group Sheet style or format in any case. Consequently they have therefore accordingly been otherwise wholly omitted from this compilation and will not be reprinted at this time, except by virtue of being made available by special and specific request. Although further queries are always cheerfully received and welcomed as to methods for dealing with various situations or circumstances which may from time to time or on occasion arise, as well as reasons or logic for arbitrarily implementing certain decisions and standards herein, it is regardless meanwhile thought, felt, supposed and presumed that many of the appropriate solutions and answers will in all probability also in most cases become quite readily clear, apparent and obvious upon, through, in the course of, or after even superficial examination and study of these records entirely without inclusion of the more complex and detailed rules and regulations formerly established solely for the Compiler's own instruction and guidance in maintaining conformity throughout.)\n\nPROCEDURE FOR FOLLOWING LINEAGE BACKWARD\n\nIn order to deduce the specific lineage of any person, persons or branch herein contained backward toward the earliest extant record or first recorded progenitor on the ascending pedigree, one need simply select the relevant parent atop the entry in question whose data as shown includes the identities of his own parents in turn followed by the parenthetical phrase \"(to whom refer)\"; then proceed alphabetically to the entry for the couple to whom so referred, indexed always for the sake of consistency and clarity under the masculine surname, and again repeat the process.\n\nPROCEDURE FOR FOLLOWING LINEAGE FORWARD\n\nIn order to deduce the specific lineage of any person, persons or branch herein contained forward toward the latest generation of recorded posterity on the descending pedigree, one need simply examine the list of offspring presented in the entry in question and select from amongst same the child or children whose issue it is desired to further trace. If the child thus selected be male, one merely notes the name of his wife, then refers alphabetically in turn to the entry for such couple, indexed always for the sake of consistency and clarity under the masculine surname, and the process is then again repeated. If, conversely, the selected child be female, it is necessary only that one instead note the name of her husband, then refer to that couple's own entry likewise alphabetically under his surname rather than hers, and proceed as before adumbrated.\n\nORDER OF INSERTION OF ENTRIES\n\nThe Individual Nuclear Family Group Entries are simply listed alphabetically by Husband's surname, and within a surname by Husband's given names. Where the Husband's complete name is identical to more than one individual, such persons are indexed according to order of birth. Information contained within each such entry is arranged internally according to a complex prearranged and standardised formula. Unmarried persons appear only within their parents' entries and require no additional entry for themselves, inasmuch as such would be repetitious, redundant and unnecessarily self-defeating of its purpose, namely the addition of further otherwise unrecorded data for spouse and offspring.\n\nGENERAL CONTENT AND FORMAT\n\nWhilst perfection is neither expected nor in every instance possible, the ideal concept and goal toward which is being striven in this work would of course be for each and every entry throughout this record to ultimately be expanded to contain as much as is now humanly recoverable concerning even the minutest details of each and every life. Inconsequential as some of this data may appear at present, this may well one day prove to be the only such record remaining upon the face of the whole earth wherein certain of these facts, of inestimable interest to countless future descendants in generations yet unborn, may be found preserved. All readers are therefore most earnestly solicited to contribute any such information as now remains at their disposal or accessible to them, for further incorporation into this work.\n\nIn addition it is anticipated that as detailed a narrative biography as can be compiled pertaining to each life, whether Husband, Wife or child, should eventually be appended to each individual entry, including every bit as much as can be reconstructed of each person's activities, adventures and personality, as well as any and all surviving anecdotes surrounding same. Such material may be submitted either in the form of rough jottings or a final draft; all necessary adjustments will be accordingly made for publication, with all due care being taken to retain intact the integrity of the account itself. In the case of a personal autobiography the same may also be couched in the first person if so desired.\n\nFinally it is further intended that pictorial sheets may also in due course be reproduced and inserted throughout the text as additional pages, illustrating and depicting each individual at various stages and periods of life, together with those places, objects, buildings, scenes, landmarks or events which may have been familiar to the person or which may have played a role, however great or small, in shaping any aspect of his mortal existence. Where no authentic likeness of the actual person is presently known to exist for possible reproduction purposes there remains still nothing to preclude inclusion of these other relevant items connected with his life or times which may help restore his story to life once more; indeed in such cases, and especially in absence of anything more personal, such other additional visual aids necessarily become to a greater or lesser extent even all the more desirable and useful from the standpoint of placing the bare facts within more suitable and appropriate context and better, more human, perspective.\n\nReaders are wholeheartedly invited to scrutinise the entries contained herein, and to forward any of the following data which may be missing, even though it be but a single item at a time if no more is available. Whilst the format for each entry follows a very rigidly structured and meticulous pattern of arrangement, readers are encouraged simply to contribute data without in any way or sense personally concerning themselves overly much with the integral mechanics of organisation in its final form.\n\nSome of the details thus requested, required and desired would ideally include the following or any part or portion thereof.\n\nNAME\n\n1.

Finally, it need only be clarified that throughout this work the specific terminology in reference to place-names follows insofar as possible the usage current in each instance at time of event. Consequently changes in designation, jurisdiction or status for a given locality over a period of time may be reflected either from one entry to another, or even within a given entry. It will therefore not be at all uncommon to find an entire change of name for a community, or alteration in type or order of local government units, as well as various other combinations or permutations which may from time to time appear at first to the uninitiated as possible errors, inconsistencies or omissions; however, every care has been taken to enter such changes consistent with the historically proper style of the moment.\n\nBARRINGTON\n\nBackground, Origins and Early Development\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nGeneral Introduction\n\nAccording to tradition handed down in the family of the Irish Barringtons, and long diffused and preserved throughout the Limerick and other branches, the first of our ancestors known on English soil was one Eudo, Udo or Odo du Barentin or Barentone, variously described as either a Norman follower or Saxon supporter of the Conqueror, by whom he was rewarded with a grant of the Custodianship of The King's Forest of Hatfield. In reality the Barringtons were Anglo-Saxon and they extend back much further still. Although the surname may have originated with Udo and he may have been the first whose forename has been preserved without a subsequent gap in the record, he and his forebears had in fact been Hereditary Woodwards of Hatfield Forest, at Hatfield Broad Oak, near Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire even as early as and probably well before the Conquest. Udo's grant may therefore have been more in the nature of a regrant or confirmation, perhaps with a broadening, extension or other alteration of its scope, terms or conditions as well.\n\nThere is also in circulation a rather charming English family legend concerning a remote paternal antecedent named Adam who was converted to Christianity by St. Augustine, the first Archbishop of Canterbury, allegedly in the year 597. From this event is said to have been derived the friar's head crest atop the basic Arms, Argent three chevronels gules a label azure, - (in which case the monk in question almost certainly would have had to have been Benedictine rather than Capuchin as apparently since supposed by many branches of the name).\n\nAt any rate Udo's son Eustachius (or Eustace), surnamed \"de Barentona\", was confirmed in the Custody of this Royal Forest by King Henry I., from whom also he received a considerable additional grant of lands in nearby Essex, which became the hereditary seat of his successors. He died during the reign of King Stephen, by whom the family was greatly further enriched by receipt of Lord Montfichet's former holdings.\n\nThe 14th in direct descent from Udo, John Barrington, a contemporary of Henry VIII., further enhanced his heritage and fortunes by marriage into the great family of Bonham, which alliance brought a share of the blood of the Lords Marney as well. John's son Thomas did better still, by marrying, firstly, Alice, daughter to Henry Parker, Lord Morley, and, secondly, Winifred, daughter and co-heiress to Henry Pole, Lord Montagu and widow of Thomas Hastings. This lady's grandfather, Sir Richard Pole, a Knight of the Garter, was married to the cruelly-executed Margaret, Countess of Salisbury, whose father in turn was the also-murdered George, Duke of Clarence, brother to King Edward IV. and King Richard III., (the latter of whom fell before the Tudor onslaught at Bosworth Field, having, it was perhaps unjustly alleged, previously disposed of his two young nephews in the Tower); and thus Thomas' wife brought into the family by right of her great-grandfather, the blood of the Royal House of England.\n\nAccording to some of the most respected authorities, Thomas and Winifred produced a daughter Catherine who married into the noble and illustrious family of Bourchier, and also two sons, Francis and John, the former becoming a great man in England and the latter in Ireland. But in this assumption the experts are found in error. The younger son was Henry, not John, and the John in question, who settled in Ireland, was instead son to a George, stated by their kinsman Sir Henry Sidney to have been another scion of the original Essex family, branching off the main line of Barrington Hall at some unspecified earlier date.\n\nThe elder son of Thomas, Sir Francis, who succeeded his father in the ancestral seat of Barrington Hall, Essex and became Custodian of Hatfield Forest, was created a Baronet of England by King James on 29 June 1611 following institution of that new honour the same year. He served as Member of Parliament during the last years of Elizabeth, throughout the entire reign of James, and even the first three years of Charles I. His wife was aunt to that archfiend and chief regicide Oliver Cromwell, the odious usurper and self-styled \"Lord Protector\" of the Realm. At Sir Francis' death in 1628 he was succeeded by his eldest son Sir Thomas, second Baronet, who, dying in 1654, was in turn succeeded as third Baronet by his own son Sir John.\n\nThis Sir John Barrington of Barrington Hall followed in his grandfather's footsteps as a Member of Parliament and was at first a henchman of his cousin Cromwell. However, shocked and horrified by the despicable excesses which the Parliamentarians proposed, he thought better of the enterprise and withdrew his support; and, when appointed to the blatantly illegal and wholly unconstitutional \"kangaroo\" tribunal imposed to \"try\" King Charles, he flatly refused to sit, and likewise indignantly spurned the invitation to join the regicides in signing the spurious death warrant which ended the life of the Martyr King. Thenceforth shunning public life, he dwelt in quietude thereafter and throughout the reign of the restored King Charles II., son to Charles the Martyr, dying 24 March 1682, more than three decades after the Royal Martyr himself, for whose downfall he seems to have felt at least partially personally responsible and guilty. His son Thomas who predeceased him left by his wife Lady Anne Rich, daughter and co-heiress to Robert Rich, fifth Earl of Warwick, an elder son who succeeded him as Sir John, fourth Baronet; but the latter died unmarried in consequence of smallpox in 1691 and the title passed to his brother Sir Charles as fifth Baronet.\n\nSir Charles, also a Member of Parliament, despite two marriages left no issue. His first cousin Sir John, sixth Baronet, succeeded him and died in 1717. Sir John's eldest son, another Sir John, seventh Baronet, also served in Parliament but died without issue 4 May 1776, being succeeded by his brother Sir Fitzwilliam as eighth Baronet. The latter's two sons succeeded in turn, the elder, Sir John, ninth Baronet, dying unmarried 5 August 1818; and with the demise of the younger, Sir Fitzwilliam, 10th Baronet, on 26 September 1833 in his 79th year, this branch failed in the male line and the English Baronetcy accordingly became extinct, though the daughters married well.\n\nDespite the expiration of his own heirs-male, however, other kinsfolk of Sir Francis, first Baronet, also descending from Udo, have gained great influence and achieved positions of honour, distinction and eminence in English affairs. One of these, Drogo or Drew, served twice as Lord Mayor of London, just before and again shortly after the beginning of the 1400s.\n\nIt should perhaps be noted at this juncture that the old Irish Peerage title of Viscount Barrington belongs to a family having nothing whatever to do with the original stock, their founder, whose name was formerly Shute, having merely assumed the surname of his own volition without any blood ties of any sort with the historic family of whom we treat. This he did in consequence of the fact that his first cousin Elizabeth was married to Francis Barrington, a junior grandson to the second Baronet; which Francis and Elizabeth, being childless, bequeathed him their personal property. Of this line arguably the most famous has been the great 20th Century diplomat and man of literature, Patrick, 11th Viscount.\n\nInasmuch as the Kings of England had been sending troops and settlers into Ireland for centuries before the two Crowns of Scotland and England were united and the \"plantations\" of Scots settlements also began in earnest, English suzerainty over Ireland has had a very long history, far predating the influx of the Scots-Irish. In fact the ultimate outcome was that in later years the already-settled English finally were relegated primarily to the south of Ireland where they continued Anglicanism in the form of the Established Church of Ireland as their predominant religious affiliation, whereas most of the newly-arriving Scots planters eventually took over the several counties collectively known as Ulster and proceeded to institute Presbyterianism as the common denomination therein.\n\nThus it was with the Barringtons. In due course, as might be expected, the original Essex family split into various branches and, as with so many other English families of the time, a part or portion of them accompanied the Royal forces into Ireland. This crossing mainly took place during the reigns of the first Mary and Elizabeth, the latter of whom bestowed in 1558, the first year of her reign, a vast and imposing land grant in Queen's County, (now County Leix), including the estate of Cullenagh or Cullinagh, (afterward the site of a modern-day wind farm), upon their leaders George the father and John the son, abovementioned. This was done at the behest of Sir Henry Sidney, Vice Treasurer and afterward Lord Deputy of Ireland, who also bore Barrington blood, and whose Arms as a Knight of the Garter in 1564 included a version of the Armorial Bearings above described. From this colony of Barringtons sprang a branch so large and so powerful that they came to be reckoned one of the so-called \"Seven Tribes\" of Anglo-Irish occupiers of that County, and were enumerated amongst the principal gentlemen of Leix in 1598. Of course the native Irish family dispossessed of their ancient patrimony in order to accommodate them, the ï¿½ Mores (or ï¿½ Moores), being less than pleased with the new arrangement, continued to dispute the claim and waged occasional skirmishes against them for many years, but always the Barringtons, who commanded superior force, held firm. Finally, in 1608, after having averaged an uprising almost every second year for nearly half a century, the remaining ï¿½ Mores were officially \"deported\" to County Kerry, where they were little heard of more.\n\nThis John Barrington of Cullenagh, who died in 1593, had a descendant John some two centuries later who left several sons, the fourth and eldest surviving of whom being perhaps the most famous and noteworthy of all his race, namely the celebrated jurist, statesman and writer Sir Jonah Barrington, at one time a Member of Parliament and a Judge in Admiralty, who vigourously opposed the Union of Ireland with Great Britain to form The United Kingdom in 1801, and of whom so much has been written across the years.\n\nMeanwhile, however, another scion of this ancient family, Samuel Barrington, whose father had been a definite Cromwellian, had settled at Limerick in or about 1691, and his posterity, seated at Glenstal, (famed latterly as the site of the great Benedictine Abbey and secondary school), attained considerable prominence there, his son and grandson, both named Benjamin, each serving in turn as Sheriff of the County of Limerick, in 1714 and 1729 respectively. The latter's second son Matthew died in 1765, leaving a son Joseph, who, with his sons, became the founder of the renowned Barrington Hospital and Infirmary at Limerick. This Sir Joseph was created a Baronet of The United Kingdom 30 September 1831.\n\nNumerous descendants of this Limerick family have achieved distinction in public affairs and as military officers, having been decorated for their actions in almost every major conflict from that day to this, several having actually laid down their lives on Active Service. Sir Joseph's United Kingdom Baronetcy still survives, two elderly brothers, successively the sixth and seventh Baronets, having been most helpful in imparting much knowledge of the history of their venerable family and its branches. The former was in his time an eminent horticulturist, specialising in the propagation of orchids and carnations; the latter a decorated war hero and ex-Prisoner of War, before distinguishing himself in a series of corporate directorships. At this writing, close to the 300th anniversary of their connexion with Limerick, their kinsman, the current heir to the title, was residing at Calgary, Alberta.\n\nOf the four or five Barrington officers in Cromwell's army, (one of whom being Samuel's father abovementioned), only two had their reward in County Wexford: Major Thomas with grants in the Baronies of Forth and Bantry, and Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander in the Barony of Scarawalsh. The bulk of the Wexford Barringtons descend from the former, a Cavalry Captain and later Major from the Cullenagh branch, who was ascribed the distasteful sobriquet \"Kill-All\" for his especial degree of barbarism and cruelty, unsurpassed even by his fellow Roundheads, equally toward unarmed men, women and babes of the general Irish population. Principal amongst his lands in Forth was the estate and Castle of Ballymacane, granted in 1656 or 1657. From him descended two other substantial Wexford branches, those of Ballycogly and of Lambstown, as well as numerous other families from other sons.\n\nThe Barringtons of Ballycogly (or Ballycogley), including Ballycogly Castle and Tower House, both near Tacumshin (or Tacumshane) Lake, sprang from Major Nicholas, younger son to Thomas \"Kill-All\", and himself three times Mayor of Wexford. Those of Lambstown originated with his nephew, another Nicholas, fourth son to Thomas, eldest son and successor to \"Kill-All\". Curiously, this latter Thomas was sympathetic to, and several of his children and their issue turned to, embraced and joined the \"Society of Friends\" or \"Quaker\" faith, - one is tempted to suggest as some sort of penance for the misdeeds of their progenitor.\n\nVarious other Barringtons, in the nearly four and one-half centuries since their arrival in Ireland, have spread far and wide throughout that land from their original settlement or colony in Queen's County, particularly southward all the way to Cork and Wexford; and, just as naturally, countless Barringtons from both England and Ireland (as well as a scant handful who ventured into Scotland for a few generations) have found their way beyond the seas, including the rebel American possessions both before and after the rebellion, and are now numerous throughout the nethermost regions of our far-flung Empire upon which the sun never sets.\n\nAmy Barrington's masterful The Barringtons: A Family History, penned in 1917, as well as other excellent works since that time have done so much to elucidate the rise of this illustrious family both in England and in Ireland as well as abroad that it would seem futile and redundant to try to further reproduce their contents herein; the reader is accordingly referred and commended for further research and enlightenment to those definitive sources.\n\n(The brief overview of the original mutual ancestry of all branches of the family,\n\ncontained in the foregoing General Introduction,\n\nwill be continued in greater detail for each specific branch\n\nin the respective Branch Introductions preceding each separate Part\n\nof this total work.\n\nThe Compiler's own determinate branch will be found in Part I.,\n\nand other distinct branches will be likewise fully shown and covered\n\nin further additional subsequent Parts as may be duly and individually\n\nindicated and designated thereafter)\n\nPART I.\n\nThe Determinate Branch of the Compiler\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nBranch Introduction\n\nThe Barringtons of Eastern Ontario and Western Quï¿½bec, as well as a goodly part of North America, at least theoretically derive from three or four close family members, supposedly brothers and cousins, residing in County Wexford, Ireland toward the close of the 1700s and long thought to have been descended of the House of Ballycogly, - although circumstantial evidence has now recently brought the Raheenlusk branch to the fore, in strong prominence and contention as their possible root and source instead.\n\nOf these individuals, one, whose name has apparently long been lost to history, but which, it now appears, may well have been John, allegedly perished as a martyr, together with his wife, in defence of the reformed religion and Protestant faith, specifically in the form of the Established Church of Ireland, most probably during the Wexford Rising of 1798; two others, James and George, eventually found their way to Canada, as did four sons of the martyred couple. Precisely how long their forebears had been domiciled on Irish soil, or, more particularly, in County Wexford, has never been clearly defined, but certainly the Wexford Barringtons were part of a much larger and older Anglo-Irish family of the name who were already widespread and well established in the Emerald Isle.\n\nIndeed there exists a letter penned from Dublin and bearing date 31 May 1798 which makes reference and contains allusion to just such an act of barbarism as that above cited, a few days earlier at a place implied to have been somewhere in the Wicklow Mountains very near the point at which the County boundaries of Counties Wexford, Wicklow and Carlow mutually come together, in these terms following: \"In an attempt on Newtown Mount Kennedy, the rebels were defeated with the loss of 40. The Rector of Kyle and his whole family, infants and all, have been butchered by the rebels. The families of Mr. Bookey, Mr. Barrington and others have shared the same fate. The insurgent camp at Blackmoor Hill has been taken possession of by government . . .\". This incident may pertain to immediate relatives if not the actual parents of the four emigrant brothers, and may well have inspired the nucleus of the tale, despite the obviously erroneous suggestion that none of the children survived or escaped. Moreover the writer skips to and fro all over Ireland in describing the latest atrocities, and, whilst Kyle Parish was in County Tipperary, the events listed directly before and after, including the Barrington murders, he evidently thought and believed to have taken place along the Wexford/Wicklow border.\n\nThat the anonymous and unknown correspondent relied heavily upon hastily conveyed snatches of conversation from persons who had themselves witnessed and escaped these outrages, or even upon second or third-hand information, and that even these bits of hearsay were not always accurately understood, becomes clear when truth is decanted from fiction. In reality the clergyman who perished was undoubtedly the Reverend Robert Burrowes (or Burroughs), who was actually Rector of Kilmuckridge Parish on the Wexford seacoast very near the southernmost tip of the mountain range, but whose residence was called Kyle Glebe, where he was cut down on Whitsunday morning, 28 May 1798. Contrary to the report, his family did not accompany him in death, but indeed fled instead to prominent relatives some distance further afield. And if the Burrowes family survived, then equally well so too may the family of the martyred Barrington(s) have made their escape to eventually leave Ireland behind for the New World.\n\nFor many decades and generations after cessation of these overt hostilities, members of the dominant Anglo-Saxon Protestant ruling class who still felt threatened by the seething resentment of those who opposed them and wished them harm, continued in no small numbers to quit Ireland when and as they could. James Barrington Sr., abovementioned, either a brother or a cousin to the slain hero, was claimed as the earliest generation, but not necessarily the first member of the family, in Leeds County, Upper Canada. Tradition holds that his father had been a prominent official of the nature of a Judge or Sheriff in the legal establishment of either County Cork or County Wexford. James and his wife set sail from Wexford on 10 May 1817 on the brig General Moore, (Captain R. Hoare, master, and 96 settlers aboard), arriving on 19 August (not on 8 August or on any of various other dates as erroneously suggested, indicated or recorded in some documents and sources) at the Port of Quï¿½bec, together with an impressive array of personal effects, agricultural implements and equipment and livestock, as part of the organised emigration scheme known as the Rideau Military Settlement.\n\nJames was at first assigned, on 21 October 1817, a tract of about 100 acres in the remote and largely inaccessible North Half of Lot 2, Concession 8, Lansdowne Township, but later, on 29 July 1818, retroactively under the original date, at his own request, owing to poor and entirely unsuitable soil quality and topographical conditions on one of the most horrible pieces of land ever drawn by any settler anywhere, transferred to the Perth Military Settlement Plan, receiving instead an equivalent allocation in the North Half of Lot 13, Concession 6 in the Township of Yonge, about three miles south-east of Farmersville (present-day Athens), which area came to be known as the Dobbs Settlement, for the family on the adjacent farm into which Alice (or Allis) \"Allie\" Barrington, daughter to John and Deborah, later married. This land was confirmed a few years later, about 1822, and finally granted by Letters Patent from The Crown bearing date 23 June 1828. Traditions vary as to whether he had two, three or even four sons resident in Canada, one legend simply ascribing to him \"many sons\". He was said to have been buried at or near Tincap in Elizabethtown Township along with a number of these alleged sons.\n\nBe that as it may, two of his sons, James and John, with their wives and John's little daughter Mary, emigrated the following year, 1818, and spent some time at Montrï¿½al before also proceeding westward to Leeds a few years later. Under the succession laws then in force in Upper Canada, James Jr., (known as \"Jemmy\"), as the eldest son, inherited his father's property outright and simply continued thereon without even so much as bothering about a change in the title deed, and John accordingly took up in due course a homestead on which he erected a log dwelling a few rods west of Unionville, now known as Forthton Corners, in Elizabethtown Township, on the south side of the old Perth Road, (afterward Highway 29), about nine miles from Brockville.\n\nThis traditional story and account, however, may well be subject to some redefinition, it remaining equally plausible that James Sr. lived and died near Tincap where he was supposedly buried, and that it was his son James Jr., commonly called \"Jemmy\", and wife Alice (or Allis), otherwise better known as \"Allie\", who led the way, coming in 1817 with the \"military settlers\", rather than with John in 1818, and finally settling in Yonge as above described.\n\nJames Jr.'s wife Alice (or Allis) is remembered across the years as \"Big Aunt Allie\", a most meticulous housekeeper who insisted that even the feather beds be aired out and shaken each and every day. John's wife Deborah Harper, a \"good and beautiful woman\", is said to have been a close relative to Allie. One account states that she was a sister to the four Harper Brothers, founders of the publishing empire, but this is patently untrue, and another version, which asserts that they were cousins, seems more probable or credible, the premise being that there had been two brothers, one of whom in earlier years had removed either from Ireland to England or vice versa, - the publishers' own grandfather having thus emigrated to North America from Ipswich, Suffolk. (In reality the former seems the more likely scenario, inasmuch as the Harpers or Harpurs had been settled at Harperstown Castle in the Townland of Harperstown in southern Wexford since about the time of the Anglo invasion and occupation by their patron Richard de Clare, Earl of Pembroke, otherwise known as \"Strongbow\", in the name of King Henry II., during the 12th Century of the Christian Era.) James \"Jemmy\" and Alice \"Allie\" had no family, although legend decrees and history has it that other Barrington children (thought and believed to be offspring of an otherwise unknown fifth brother earlier deceased) lived with them across the years, and at their deaths the original property passed by bequest to their nephew Bennett \"Ben\" Barrington, son to John, and thence to several generations of his descendants.\n\nJemmy and Allie were buried at picturesque Oak Leaf Cemetery where their inscriptions were still visible and quite legible toward the end of the 20th Century. The final resting-places of Jemmy's brother John and the latter's wife Deborah remain uncertain, and if ever there were markers erected to their memory these are no longer extant anywhere. However, sometime in the late 1970s or early 1980s a smallish tablet, slightly broken and partially embedded in the earth, was observed by a descendant, the late Harcourt Templeton Johnston, in very close proximity to the tombstones of Jemmy and Allie. The three letters \"DEB\" were still clearly discernible above ground level, and this was taken upon circumstantial evidence by family members to indicate a clue as to the burial site of Deborah Harper Barrington, together with the extended or parallel hypothesis that therefore John must also lie alongside her there.\n\nJohn, a devout Orangeman and a staunch supporter of the notorious Ogle Robert Gowan, is stated to have come to Forthton from Montrï¿½al when his eldest daughter Mary was nine years old, which would seem to place the date roughly about 1825 or 1826, and in any case the family were at this location by the time little William and Mary Doolan came trudging up the old Perth Road from Brockville in search of lodgings in the late summer of probably 1826 or 1827, William subsequently becoming Mary Barrington's husband as narrated in the colourful Doolan history. This Barrington property became the refuge for Mary, then in the last stages of pregnancy with her daughter Deborah, during the dark days of November 1838 at the time of the Battle of the Windmill, whilst William was away defending the riverfront against the invaders, and the back country was safer than the front; thus, here, at her parental home, Mary gave birth to Deborah later the same month.\n\nWhether Eliza, John's second child, was born in Ireland or Canada, or in transit on the high seas, remains a point still disputed by sources, but in any case she was born the very year of her parents' emigration and christened later that autumn at Montrï¿½al. However, she died the following year, and later generations of the family confused her with a much younger child of the same name, who they remembered, and who had been born after removal to Upper Canada. This latter Eliza never married, but resided many years with the Forth family who kept the inn at Forthton, and in her lattermost years with her niece Alice Doolan at the old Doolan homestead. According to Sarah Alice \"Sadie\" Bryan Chipman, writing in January 1959, her Aunt Eliza much preferred little boys to little girls, a pet phrase being \"a bit of a boy\". Her life ended suddenly one early spring day, at not such a very advanced age as had been imagined by the younger relatives, upon her having walked across the field to the home of her nephew Will Doolan Jr.\n\nThe Barringtons of Dundas County result from an accidental or chance occurrence, Thomas, another son to John, having gone to that vicinity in consequence of a harvest excursion, and, upon meeting a special girl there, having decided to marry her and remain nearby. This Thomas was supposedly born aboard ship, probably on the St. Lawrence, in the summer of 1826, perhaps at the time the family was preparing to remove westward, although he was christened at Montrï¿½al, possibly indicative of the fact that they retained commerce back and forth for a time. It may also be that he was born during a return journey to visit relatives at Montrï¿½al or wind up affairs there, after their having already completed the removal; or possibly the express purpose may have been to have him born amongst better conditions and more civilised medical care than the frontier could offer, his birth unfortunately coming before their destination could be reached. Finally, the truth also remains that many more Irish settlers than is usually supposed actually made return visits to the homeland, and, if this were so of John and Deborah, it is quite conceivable that Thomas may have been born on the high seas during the voyage back to Canada.\n\nWith Thomas in Dundas and Bennett or \"Ben\" being bequeathed his uncle Jemmy's property near Athens, the Forthton property devolved upon John's son James, by whose family it was retained for many years thereafter. The other brother, William James, resided just across the line in Kitley Township where he and his wife Eliza Davis, so the story goes, one day \"found a baby boy abandoned on their doorstep\", and adopted him, naming him Wilson Simpson Barrington. Actually it has been always more generally understood that he was in reality the biological son to a member of the Barrington family, whose identity had not been transmitted across the years or passed down to us until quite recently revealed as hereafter noted; consequently he and his issue must be considered Barrington descendants as well.\n\nThe story behind the story is that one day, returning home to his farm from Easton's Corners, the above William James Barrington stopped to refresh himself about at the midway point, near a locality called Crystal, where resided two Wilson sisters. One thing led to another, and possibly William felt a bit too refreshed, with the result that a few months later the infant was surreptitiously delivered to and deposited at his door, together with a note requesting that he should be christened \"Wilson\".\n\nOf course the possibilty cannot be overlooked, ruled out or dismissed that this may actually have been a clandestinely arranged \"ruse\" staged in order to enable the childless couple to honourably and respectably extend their bloodline, with the young woman acting essentially as a surrogate.\n\nOn 4 May 1820 an older William Barrington landed in Canada from County Wexford, subsequently relocating to Elizabethtown Township and settling near Lamb's Pond, (now New Dublin), where he remained, and where his tombstone may still be viewed in the Anglican Churchyard, very near old St. John's Church itself.\n\nJoseph Barrington Sr. is an obscure figure in history, but apparently had arrived in Canada by at least 1826 when his son Joseph Jr. was born. He is known to have died at Quï¿½bec City, where he had been engaged in the construction of large sea-going vessels, in early 1828, a very young man, but whether he left any other children is unclear and presumed doubtful. It is quite possible that this family had previously been in Upper Canada, and indeed following his death his widow and infant son then left Montrï¿½al and joined their closest relatives in Leeds County, where little Joseph Jr. was christened the following year.\n\nWilliam and Joseph Sr. are generally thought to have been almost certainly other sons to James Sr., and therefore also brothers. Although this may be the same William who witnessed Joseph Jr.'s first marriage in 1848, and likely therefore his uncle, this witness may alternatively have been a cousin William. There exists no certain trace of any definite siblings for the younger Joseph, and none are presumed. That William's or Joseph Sr.'s father may have been another brother in Ireland apparently has traditionally never been accepted or considered part of the equation. It is now fully accepted that James, John, William and Joseph Sr. were all brothers, and that likewise they had a sister Ann who was married to John Kavanagh and left substantial progeny in and throughout Leeds County as well.\n\nAnother William, John, Thomas and James Barrington, brothers, were sons of the martyrs, and also settled in Lower Canada, around Montrï¿½al and later southward. Their date of emigration is given as anywhere from 1810 by some family sources, to the 1820s. Evidence suggests the earlier date to be less likely, at least for some of them; however, there is no valid reason to suppose that all came at the same time. John's family of three sons and six daughters are said to have \"gone west\" very early on, and California is rumoured as a destination for at least two of them, whilst two others are known to have settled around Leavenworth, Kansas and one near Lakeview, Oregon. John's brother James never married. William and, to a lesser extent, Thomas have thus become the progenitors of the bulk of the Barringtons still resident throughout western and south-western Quï¿½bec to this day, where a community now yet bears the name.\n\nThe precise connexion of George Barrington in Montrï¿½al, who was also mentioned as a relative, remains uncertain, as does his family or fate. He appears to have been parallel with the sons of the first settlers, and, if so, may have been one of the unaccounted-for sons whose existence has been so vigourously and vehemently asserted and attested to by so many legends and so much tradition across a very long and extended period of history.\n\n(Further details concerning many of the persons and events\n\nlightly touched upon in the brief overview\n\ncontained in the preceding Branch Introduction,\n\nas well as other additional factual information\n\nnot otherwise specifically mentioned or included herein,\n\nand similar data pertaining to all known lineal descendants\n\nof these people,\n\nmay be found in the individual personal histories and biographies\n\nlocated in their respective positions throughout this Part\n\nof the major work)\n\nA\n\nABBOTT, ABIJAH JUDSON / BARRINGTON, RUTH TOWNSEND\n\nAbijah Judson Abbott (Superintendent of Schools for Glenwood School Board, Iowa and later a Judicial District Judge in Kansas, etc.) was born 14 August 1842 at or near West Milton, Union Township, Miami County, Ohio, son to Samuel M.
