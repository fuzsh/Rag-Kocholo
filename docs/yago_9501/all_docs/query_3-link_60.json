        "text": "SINGAPORE, Mar 16, 2010 - (ACN Newswire) - The rapid growth of the new media landscape, with its explosion of delivery fronts on the latest consumer technology, has opened limitless market opportunities in content production and distribution. This inclusive media ecosystem supports the entry of smaller new players as it is now possible for development of good, innovative content that appeals to wide audiences on modest budgets.\n\nBroadcastAsia2010's new Creative Content Production Conference will provide production companies in Asia with the insights and know-how to carve their niche in this effervescent media entertainment arena. The conference will cover a wide array of topical issues from financing and pre-production planning and cost effective content production to efficient post-production techniques and creating hybrid content for multiple platforms. The conference will be held from 16 to 17 June 2010 at the BroadcastAsia2010 International Conference - Asia's leading broadcast and media conference.\n\nNew business opportunities through multiple-channel distribution\n\nWith a compound annual growth rate of 10%, the digital content creation market is predicted to reach US$4.9 billion by 2012. As the expansion of platforms impact on the ways broadcast contents are being delivered, content owners have to abandon traditional business models and actively seek to monetise their content on different modes of delivery - from books to animation; games to movies; and television/broadcast to handhelds. Industry veterans at the Creative Content Production Conference will shed light on how businesses can enhance their strategies to take advantage of new distribution and delivery platforms.\n\n\"The market has seen the proliferation of multiple platforms and online content distribution. Huge opportunities for media content producers are emerging as we see gradual clarity in the business and exploitation models. Asian players are well-positioned to flourish in this growing market and I believe firmly that channel distribution will be the next big thing,\" said conference speaker Mr Tony Chow, Managing Director of Off the Fence Productions.\n\nOther renowned speakers from the industry include Riaz Mehta, President and Founder, Imagine Group (for the Contender Asia and The Biggest Loser Asia); Nicholas Chee, Executive Director, Sinema Academy of Motion Pictures; Tzang Merwyn Tong, Director, INRI Studio; Wellington Fung, Assistant Head of Create HK and Secretary General of Film Development Council; Fotini Paraskakis, Head of Content, Fremantle Productions Asia; Rick Mulia, Executive Producer, MSN Southeast Asia; and Joanne Teoh, Director, Sapphire Studios.\n\nPotential for independent films in Asia\n\nEuropean film festivals have seen more independent Asian films being selected and awarded in recent years, in particular those from Japan, China, Korea and Thailand. However, Asian independent film makers often grapple with the need for breakthrough with creative content while managing budgetary concerns. Given the niche nature of independent films, film makers need new digital filmmaking techniques to enable translation of their unique perspectives onto film, realising bold, provocative and experimental cinema beyond the mainstream, which in turn, guarantee diverse and exciting contents.\n\nThe case study topic of \"Capturing the Essence of Making Independent Films in Asia\" will be conducted by founder and director of INRI studio Tzang Merwyn Tong. The session will touch on tapping the market for independent films in Asia, generating ideas for content creation, and meeting the financial challenges of producing and marketing on a minimal budget.\n\n\"The world is increasingly looking to the Asia for its quirky and creative content. What does that mean to the indie film-maker? What are the opportunities and challenges? The case study provides a platform for artists and dreamers to explore the infinite possibilities.\" said Mr Tong.\n\nThe Creative Content Production Conference is a must-attend event targeted at industry professionals from CEOs, MDs, heads of production and content, and content acquisition, to independent film writers, creative directors, programming officers and investors.
