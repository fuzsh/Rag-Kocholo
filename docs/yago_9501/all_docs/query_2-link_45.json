        "text": "Australian director Martin Wilson, known for “Great White” and “Pieces,” has joined forces with producers Pravesh Sahni (“Extraction“), Ozz Borges (“A Nanny’s World”) and John Fragomeni (“Children of the Corn”) for international sports film “Wicked Wickets.”\n\nThe original story, penned by Borges and Jerry Starling (“A Nanny’s World”), follows Puerto Rican baseball star Randy Montero as he grapples with fame and personal demons. An unexpected twist lands him in India, blending the worlds of sports, culture and family. Set in both India and the U.S., the film will feature a blend of Latino, Indian and Western cultures. It boasts a culturally diverse production team, featuring Indian, Cuban, Korean and Australian influences.\n\nThe project was unveiled during the ongoing cricket T20 World Cup, which is taking place across the U.S. and Caribbean.\n\nSahni, whose credits also include “The White Tiger” and “Shantaram,” said: “This film is so much more than sports. It’s a universal life story about success, loss, and redemption and the characters are complex, endearing, relatable… with global appeal. South Asia is cricket-crazed, and India alone has 1.4 billion passionate fans and that’s a great starting point for a worldwide audience reception.”\n\nNegotiations are underway for a star-studded ensemble cast, with production slated to begin in Q4 2024.\n\nWilson said: “’Wicked Wickets’ is an exciting story that mirrors India itself, where life proceeds at its own pace, taking on unpredictable paths. It can be thrilling and fun. Confronting and lonely, then on a toss of a coin, simmering with vibrant life surging with drama and twists. Wickets is funny, heartbreaking, exhilarating, and inspiring at the same time. At its heart and soul, is a rich and satisfying character study that I will imbue with authentic, moving performances that explore fractured human frailties with honest sensitivity and humor. This depth of performance will stay with you long after the film has ended.”\n\nThe producers are in talks with several major brands to partner with on the film. Fragomeni said: “Brands pay millions for a 30 second TV commercial on a Super Bowl day. There is a new era evolving in marketing, and the brands we are talking with are loving the proposition of being part of a positive, uplifting sports story that crosses cultural boundaries and puts their name in front of the entire world.”\n\nBorges added: “This film transcends typical entertainment; it’s a movement. It will resonate with audiences through our storyline and on-screen diversity. Featuring a black Latino protagonist who plays baseball we connect with the Western audience, while the love for cricket element speaks to the rest of the globe, reaching north of three billion fans. A huge audience potential for an original Indie film, but most importantly, with so much unrest and political discord, this is a much needed story of hope and redemption. A feel good movie, is what the world needs right now.”"
