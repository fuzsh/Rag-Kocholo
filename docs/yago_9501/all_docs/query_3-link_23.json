Not only does it allow them to communicate directly with their audience, it also enables them to promote their music whenever and however they wish. Frankly speaking, you don’t need to have a label to be a…\n\nWhen is a Zombie not a Zombie: “The Retaliators” Review\n\nA word to the wise, never show characters watching a seminal film that is far better than the one they are in (here the film is Romero’s classic The Night of the Living Dead). A pastor, Bishop (Michael Lombardi), loses his eldest daughter as a result of a drug exchange that goes wrong and must decide…\n\n79th Venice International Film Festival – “Burning Hearts” Review\n\nDeep in the Apulian countryside, resides two powerful families with a venomous hatred of each other – the Malatestas and the Camporeales.

All until the young Malatesta heir Andrea (Francesco Patanè)…\n\n79th Venice International Film Festival – “World War III” Review\n\n“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” Houman Seyedi’s World War III starts with this quote oft-attributed to Mark Twain.

There are many reasons: ingenious approach to music videos, sophisticated choreography, the charming personalities of idols, and catchy songs. Although lyrics might not always be relatable, the melody itself can be enough to hook listeners. But what about vocal abilities? While I am strict in my judgement when…\n\nA Night to Remember – JUNNY Shows off His Vocal Talent at The Garage in London\n\nThe Garage is one of the most iconic music venues in London. Although average in its capacity, the artists who have passed through its doors over the years include Green Day, Muse, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, My Chemical Romance, and Oasis. On August 28th, JUNNY, a Korean-Canadian R&B singer came to The Garage to perform…\n\n“Laundromat on the Corner” Review\n\nThe Laundromat on the Corner is a 17-minute short film and the directorial debut of Japanese producer and writer, Tetsuki Ijichi. While it takes the form of a traditional “Asian” ghost story, it uses this form to relate an intercultural love story, which crosses not only cultures but also the boundary between life and death….\n\n“A Wicked Tale” Review\n\nA Wicked Tale is an experimental film that reworks the cautionary story of Little Red Riding Hood. With a running time of just over 44 minutes, Singaporean director Tzang Merwyn Tong’s debut feature premiered at the 34th Rotterdam International Film Festival in 2005. While there are numerous versions of Little Red Riding Hood across cultures,…\n\nLet the Music Play! Let SUNMI Sing! – SUNMI Brings Refreshing Energy to London’s Troxy\n\nTroxy, London. The clock strikes 8 pm, the lights fade away, and music begins to play. SUNMI, to the piercing cheers of her fans, appears on stage alongside her dancers.
