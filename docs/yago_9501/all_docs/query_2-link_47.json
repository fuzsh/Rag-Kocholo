        "text": "One of Netflix’s top movies in the U.S. is the British comedy/mystery film Wicked Little Letters, starring Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley. As you watch the film, you might wonder if it’s based on a true story and if the 1920s libel scandal actually happened in real life.\n\nDirected by Thea Sharrock and written by Jonny Sweet, the film follows Edith, an English woman who starts receiving a series of anonymous obscenity-filled letters. She suspects they’re from her rowdy Irish neighbor, Rose, but Rose denies involvement, claiming that her outspoken nature would make such letters unnecessary.\n\nThe scandal escalates in the town, and Rose is put on trial, as Edith’s nosy friends and the town’s only female police officer set out to uncover the identity of the real sender. The film takes place in Littlehampton, Sussex, England, and stars Oscar-winning actress Olivia Colman and Oscar nominee Jessie Buckley as the feuding neighbors. BAFTA nominee Anjana Vasan, Timothy Spall, Gemma Jones, Hugh Skinner, Paul Chahidi, Joanna Scanlan, Lolly Adefope, and others also star.\n\nIs Wicked Little Letters Based On A True Story?\n\nWicked Little Letters is based on the real-life hate mail scandal, also known as the “Littlehampton letters,” which involved four court cases and three prison sentences over almost three years. Edith Swan and Rose Gooding were neighbors living in Littlehampton, a seaside town in West Sussex, in the early 1920s.\n\nRose lived with her husband Bill and her sister Ruth, while Edith shared the home with her father, mother and two brothers, according to the West Sussex Records Office. The neighbors’ friendship went downhill after Edith reported to the NSPCC that she was receiving libelous letters. Edith believed it was Rose, especially since some letters were signed “R.G.”\n\nBecause there was little evidence tying Rose to the letters, Edith sought help from a solicitor to prosecute Rose. Rose was held in Portsmouth prison while the case was awaiting court. The West Sussex Records Office notes that although no “expert evidence was being submitted to prove the handwriting belonged to her,” Rose was found guilty. She was sentenced to two weeks after already spending two months in prison.\n\nForbesOlivia Colman And Jessie Buckley On 'Wicked Little Letters': 'It Was The Best Job'\n\nAt the end of December, letters started being sent again, and Edith reported them to the police in early January, leading many in the town to believe that it was Rose. Rose was brought back to court, where the jury requested to see Edith’s handwriting, but it was denied. The jury found Rose guilty again and sentenced her to 12 months in prison with hard labor.\n\nHow Did Police Discover Rose Was Innocent?\n\nWhile Rose was still in prison, her letters kept circulating. But they would only have been able to get past the prison walls if they were checked. Edith started to look suspicious to the police. They found a notebook filled with obscene language directed toward Edith in Littlehampton. A search of Edith’s home also found blotting papers, “and the police were able to single out certain words and could determine that they were in Edith’s hand,” according to the West Essex Record Office.\n\nThe Court of Criminal Appeal ultimately overturned Rose’s conviction. She was also awarded £250 in compensation. When Rose was released, new letters began to target new neighbors, including Violet and P.C. George May. Suspiciously, Edith started to befriend Violet and wanted to talk gossip about the letters. Violet suspected that Edith was writing the scathing letters and kept an eye on her.\n\nWho Was PC Gladys Moss?\n\nPC Gladys Moss was the first female police officer in Sussex, appointed in 1919. She was sent to observe the Gooding and Swan families. During one of her watches, she saw Edith throw a piece of paper at the back of the police cottage. Violet was instructed to retrieve the piece of paper addressed to her, which made offensive comments about her husband. Gladys confronted Edith about the letter, but she needed more evidence to convict her.\n\nThe police arrested Edith on October 21, 1921, for one count of criminal libel against Violet May. When Edith went to trial, a jury shockingly found her not guilty. Authorities continued to gather evidence and worked closely with the General Post Office (GPO). The GPO sent two Special Investigation Branch clerks to set a trap for Edith. Stamps were marked with invisible ink, and the Beach Town sub-post office was instructed to sell them to Edith.\n\nForbesOlivia Colman Reflects On Her Beloved Career: 'I Have Been Very Lucky'\n\nHow Did Police Finally Catch Edith?\n\nOne of the clerks saw Edith post two letters. When they retrieved them, one of the letters was addressed to Littlehampton’s new sanitary inspector. The letter included inappropriate words, and it contained an invisible stamp that was planted beforehand by the clerks. Edith denied any wrongdoing.\n\nEdith was charged on the fourth of July. She was finally found guilty after her second trial and was sentenced to 12 months in prison with hard labor.\n\nWicked Little Letters is streaming on Netflix. Watch the official trailer below."
