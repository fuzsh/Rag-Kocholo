        "text": "\"Don't be afraid.\" \"I\"m not afraid.\" Magic is in the air! Discover a whole new world with Glinda & Elphaba. Universal Pictures has revealed the full-length official trailer for Jon M. Chu's Wicked movie, arriving in theaters everywhere in November later this year. After two decades as one of the most beloved and enduring musicals on the stage, Wicked makes its long-awaited journey to the big screen as a spectacular, generation-defining cinematic event this holiday season. Directed by filmmaker Jon M. Chu (of Crazy Rich Asians, In the Heights), Wicked is the first chapter of a two-part immersive, cultural celebration. Cynthia Erivo stars as Elphaba Thropp, a young woman with green skin who eventually becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Ariana Grande co-stars as Glinda, with Michelle Yeoh, Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Marissa Bode, Bowen Yang, Bronwyn James, Keala Settle, plus Jeff Goldblum as the legendary Wizard of Oz. The first teaser trailer from a few months ago actually looked pretty good, but this trailer is even better. Massive real sets, vivid colors everywhere, passionate performances galore! This should be worth the wait as it looks like it might live up to great expectations as a proper cinematic version of the beloved Wicked story.\n\nHere's the full official trailer (+ poster) for Jon M. Chu's Wicked movie, from Universal's YouTube:\n\nYou can rewatch the teaser trailer for Chu's Wicked movie right here, and the \"passion\" featurette here.\n\nWicked, the untold story of the witches of Oz, stars Emmy, Grammy, Tony winning powerhouse Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, a young woman, misunderstood because of her unusual green skin, who has yet to discover her true power, and Grammy-winning, multi-platinum recording artist and global superstar Ariana Grande as Glinda, a popular young woman, gilded by privilege and ambition, who has yet to discover her true heart. The two meet as students at Shiz University in the fantastical Land of Oz and forge an unlikely but profound friendship. Following an encounter with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths. Glinda's unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power, while Elphaba's determination to remain true to herself, and those around her, will have unexpected & shocking consequences on her future. Their extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good... and the Wicked Witch of the West."
