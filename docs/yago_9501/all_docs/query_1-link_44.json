        "text": "“It is not uncommon to hear of art inspired by Zen philosophy, from calligraphy to archery to architecture to gardening, but filmmaking is a complex process that is highly conditional and dependent on external factors.\n\nHow do you make a film with a Zen-mind? What will it look like?\"\n\nFor most art forms, the process of making is as important (and enjoyable) as what is made. While filmmakers enjoy making films, the end justifies the means.\n\n‘You are only as good as your last film’, they say.\n\nThe making itself often brings more pain than joy to the filmmaker because of numerous conditions attached to the process. From funding, to marketing and distribution, every aspect of the production weighs heavily on the shoulders of all independent filmmakers. Ironically, enjoying the process is the last thing that comes to mind.\n\nThis is probably why ‘Zen-Mind Filmmaking’, conceived by Singaporean filmmaker-educator, Tzang Merwyn Tong - currently a lecturer at Republic Polytechnic teaching Visual Storytelling and Film Appreciation - sparked my interest. As the name suggests, it is an approach inspired by Zen Buddhism to free filmmakers from the conditions attached to filmmaking and focus on the “now” – the making. As an avid yoga practitioner and actress myself, I am inherently aligned with the ‘Zen’ philosophy but I know filmmaking is anything but Zen.\n\n\"The Zen-Mind filmmaking methodology employs the use of minimalism, non-attachment to make films in the here and now. The purpose is to free the filmmaker from entanglements associated with filmmaking. Too often entanglements like funding, seeking resources and hustling for support takes priority over the act of making films itself.\"\n\nOn 10 January 2023, I attended as a representative of the Singapore Film Society for the first ever sharing of Zen-Mind Filmmaking Experiment. Other invitees to the closed-door session included filmmakers, artists, musicians, researchers, film educators, zen-masters and meditation practitioners. Tzang mentioned that he wanted this sharing session to be interrogative to see if it holds water from both a Zen or filmmaking perspective.\n\nDuring the event held at Lasalle Campus on 10 January 2023, Tzang started with a one-minute mindful practice. Much like how I begin a yoga class, we breathe. And… do nothing. He wanted us to be in the “now” before sharing more about his approach and addressing some questions from the floor during the Q&A session, which was moderated by Lasalle lecturer and filmmaker Wesley Leon Aroozoo.\n\n“Zen is about coming back to the center. The center of filmmaking is storytelling with the moving image.\"\n\nAs part of his research, he experimented with Zen-Mind Filmmaking with four local independent filmmakers. He outlined a ‘Zen-Mind’ manifesto that guided the filmmakers to be minimalistic in planning (e.g. rehearsals, scripting, shotlist etc.) and non-attached to hiccups (e.g. weather conditions, sound interference etc.) that occurred. The end result was four distinct short films that carried a vein of the filmmaker’s unique thought process and storytelling style, spreading across genres of drama, dark comedy and experimental thriller.\n\nA ‘Zen-Mind’ short film does not have to leave the audience feeling Zen.\n\n(From left) The Verge, by Darshan Kunasagran; The Cell, by Zach RS Ho; The Rehearsal, by Mattheaus Choo; Useless, by Syafiq Fadzelli\n\n[Zen-Mind films \"The Cell\" by Zach RS Ho and \"The Verge\" by Darshan Kunasagran made its World Premiere in the Philippines at the Bakunawa Fantastic Film Festival in December 2022 to intrigue and acclaim. \"The Verge\" was voted the 6th most-watched short film in the online telecast.]\n\nAs I sat through the post-screening dialogue session with the filmmakers, I felt their sense of liberation when talking about their films. It was less about how good the film turned out, but about how much it resonated with them. As a member of the audience, I appreciated the art in their self-actualisation, even more than the films themselves. More than a methodology, Zen-Mind Filmmaking has a wellness dimension to help filmmakers look inwards during the process of actualising their films.\n\nWe often say, trust the process. Growing up in a culture that emphasizes precision and efficiency, how feasible is it then for a filmmaker to relinquish control and trust the process, I wonder…\n\nHaving watched the four Zen-Mind films, I am curious to see more of such films being made to offer a different cinematic experience. I am also hopeful to see how the Zen-Mind approach can help foster a more collaborative relationship between the director and actor, one that creates space for spontaneity.\n\nZen-Mind Filmmaking may have started out as an experiment but it has the potential to grow into a film movement born out of Singapore. While Dogma95, the Romanian New Wave and the No Wave Cinema movement of the New York Underground inspired Tzang, the Zen-Mind Filmmaking movement is philosophically very different from all of them.\n\nMost of all, I look forward to seeing how much of the film industry this movement will wash over.\n\nAdditional resources:\n\nIf what you have just read interests you, check out our short video excerpts from 10 January’s Zen-Mind Filmmaking session on our TikTok and Instagram @singaporefilmsociety.\n\nCheck out the full length recording of Zen-Mind Filmmaking by Tzang on Youtube: https://youtu.be/jkqtpf9SnOM\n\nFor more information on the 4 experimental films, check out Tzang’s thoughts: https://linktr.ee/tzangm\n\nAbout the founder of Zen-Mind Filmmaking, Tzang Merwyn Tong (@tzang_m)\n\nTzang is an award-winning Singapore independent filmmaker and educator best known for his independent films often set in surreal alternate realities and made under tight constraints.
