        "text": "Every time it seems that external circumstances are pulling the emergency brake on the development of Ukrainian cinema, Ukrainian artists, against all odds, find the strength and means to keep moving the train forward. Neither COVID-19 nor the large-scale war has stopped Ukrainian art, whose \"time has come.\" This was once again demonstrated by the 15th Odesa International Film Festival which became not just a significant film event, but a declaration, a symbol of our people's resilience and perseverance. The executive producer of SPACE Production, Kateryna Laskari noted that this year at the Odesa International Film Festival, the significance of the Ukrainian retrospective in the festival program was particularly striking. In her opinion, this indicates that we all have a demand not only for the development of contemporary cinema but also for active self-identification through art: \"An absolute blossoming of love for domestic cinema and the study of its history! One might think that Oleksandr Dovzhenko, Kira Muratova, and Serhiy Parajanov would be thrilled. It is very painful that our process of identification and its sharp activation are partly due to the terrible war that consumes so many of our best people, including film artists. This harsh reality is depriving our cinematic tradition of many talented and promising individuals right before our eyes. At the same time, it forces us to value every story, every frame created today by our filmmakers, filled with pain, love, and a desire for a better future.\" No matter how difficult each new day is, Space Production gladly welcomes all events that indicate this movement and continues uninterrupted filming both in Ukraine and abroad. #SPACEproduction #filmproduction\n\nAs the world anticipates the global release of the much-talked-about film \"Oppenheimer,\" a noteworthy exception has been Japan‚Äîa country with a deeply historical connection to the film's subject matter. The Christopher Nolan production is set for a delayed debut in Japanese cinemas in 2024, stirring conversations around the cultural sensitivities linked to Japan's experience in World War II. The film's release has sparked a wider debate on representations of historical events in popular culture, with tactics such as the 'Barbenheimer' trend raising questions about appropriateness and context. Polish audiences, meanwhile, enjoy unhampered access to \"Oppenheimer\" through selected VOD services and physical copies‚Äîalthough the latter will soon be a relic with Universal's withdrawal from physical media distribution in Poland post-January 1, 2024, pivoting the market towards streaming. For a deeper understanding of this complex narrative and the implications of film distribution, read our latest blog post. Discover how historical narratives and modern-day media consumptions intersect in this compelling case study at https://ift.tt/USfX9Hi.\n\n‚ÄúIn the 20th century, overcoming competition and getting into the University of Tokyo was a very big deal for Japanese people. Japan used to compete with the whole world. They worked so hard and were super competitive in order to survive and secure their jobs. I guess South Korea today is showing similar behavior.‚Äù The Japan Times: https://lnkd.in/gfyxtFyQ I was invited last month to attend the 27th annual Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival (BIFAN) in South Korea. BIFAN is Asia's largest genre film festival. It's an extraordinary event, showcasing 262 films from 51 countries before 67,274 attendees, up 18.2% since 2022. Aria Aster (\"Midsommar\") Choi-min Sik (\"Oldboy\") and Makoto Tezuka were just some of the many VIPs on hand. What stunned me most was the high level of quality, intensity and commitment of the Korean works I saw. By comparison, many of the contemporary Japanese films and series I‚Äôve recently seen ‚Äî including those featured at this year‚Äôs BiFan, where Japanese genre works were spotlighted ‚Äî feel listless and adrift, self-conscious portraits of Japan filtered through a soft-focus, navel-gazing nostalgia. #cinema #culture #media #asia #korea #japan #softpower\n\n#Nigeria: Funke Akindele's A TRIBE CALLED JUDAH‚Äîthe highest-grossing Nigerian film ever‚Äîcontinues its historic run, set to premiere in nine Francophone African countries on Friday, January 19, 2024. Managed by Canal Olympia Showtimes Cinemas, the film will open theatrically in 13 regions across nine French-speaking African countries. See the graphic below. Why might this expansion be significant? The exchange of films between Anglophone and Francophone African countries, specifically theatrical distribution, isn't a common practice and has been a challenge due to cultural differences, language barriers, and market dynamics. However, in recent years, there has been an increasing interest in cross-cultural distribution as African film industries grow and diversify. The rise of digital platforms and streaming services has also played a role in facilitating wider distribution and access to films across linguistic boundaries. Still, intra-continent distribution systems face challenges. It makes A TRIBE CALLED JUDAH's expansion into Francophone African territories notable. Coincidentally, I discussed this issue broadly in a post early this week (see my profile page).\n\nFor those who‚Äôve taken the time to read some of my posts on here, you may know that one aspect of what I do is bring Asian films to theaters in North America. üôå I‚Äôve been doing it for a few years now, and although some aspects of it has gotten easier, for the most part, every international/independent film comes with its own set of challenges. Probably one of the biggest struggles is getting our Asian community to understand that every time we bring an Asian film into mainstream theaters, we‚Äôre competing head-to-head with Hollywood films for screens. So as you can imagine, if theaters are given a choice to play a Hollywood film or an independent/Asian film, I think you can guess the outcome. üòÄ I‚Äôm very motivated to support our international and independent creative voices and 3388 Films and I consistently take lots of risks to try to make this happen on a frequent basis for our communities. But I need your help. We can bring Asian films to North America theaters, but need people to come out and watch them in theaters. As most everything, it‚Äôs a numbers game. If theaters don‚Äôt see the numbers, there‚Äôs really no reason for them to continue to play Asian films. What we have coming to theaters tomorrow, Friday Dec 8, is The Last Wife, directed by Victor Vu, widely considered the most prolific modern-day director in Vietnam. This film is a period drama and is an exquisite ode to the beauty of 19th century Vietnam and the strength of Vietnamese women. The Last Wife will play in over 50 theaters across the U.S and Canada starting tomorrow, Friday Dec 8. I always ask myself: if we don‚Äôt support our communities, who will? I hope to have your support and look forward to seeing you in theaters this opening weekend (Dec 8 - 10) for The Last Wife. ü§û #TheLastWife #NguoiVoCuoiCung #NowPlaying #Distributor #3388Films"
