        "text": "Tyrion Lannister is heading to the Wonderful World of Oz. Peter Dinklage has been cast in the upcoming Broadway musical adaptation “Wicked: Part One,” it was announced Wednesday.\n\nJim Orr, Universal Pictures President of Domestic Theatrical Distribution, announced the news on Wednesday, during the company’s CinemaCon presentation in Las Vegas. Dinklage will voice Dr. Dillamond, a goat professor at Shiz University and a mentor to the musical’s protagonist Elphaba (played in the film by Cynthia Erivo). William Youmans originated the part on Broadway in 2003.\n\nDinklage is best known for his acclaimed performance as Tyrion in HBO drama “Game of Thrones.” For his part as the scheming political manipulator, the actor won the Primetime Emmy Award for Oustanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series a record four times across the show’s eight seasons. Outside of “Game of Thrones,” Dinklage broke through with the 2003 indie film “The Station Agent,” and his other credits include “X-Men: Days of Future Past,” “Death at a Funeral,” “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” “Avengers: Infinity War,” “I Care A Lot,” “Cyrano,” “She Came to Me,” and last year’s “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.” He will next appear in Netflix film “Unfrosted: The Pop Tart Story,” and will star in the comedy “Brothers” opposite Josh Brolin and the Western “The Thicket” with Juliette Lewis.\n\nThe “Wicked” film adaptation is based on the popular Broadway musical of the same name, which is itself based on the 1995 novel by Gregory Maguire, which in turn is based on the iconic 1900 L. Frank Baum novel “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.” Both the musical and the Maguire novel tell the story of the Wicked Witch of the West from the original Baum book, imagining her coming-of-age and friendship with Glinda the Good Witch. The stage musical, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and a book by Winnie Holzman, was immediately successful upon its 2003 Broadway premiere, and won three Tony Awards. It has run continuously at the Gershwin Theatre in the 20 years since, and is currently the fourth longest-running production on Broadway."
