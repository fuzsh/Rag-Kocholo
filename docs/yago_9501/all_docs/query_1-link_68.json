        "text": "Hold on to your little red hats, there are a lot of Red Riding Hood films. I don’t usually include all the cartoons, but there seem to be SO MANY that I thought I would, just to show how many there are.\n\nThis one seems really popular among filmmakers in the early part of cinematic history and I wonder if it’s because it’s a good one for drama and tension but also has a moral to it that fits with the social mores of the time. “Good Girls don’t talk to Strange Men or Bad Things happen to them” is the easiest moral to draw from the tale, and has been the one emphasised by many storytellers since [at least] Charles Perrault, but as we have seen in the previous post – it’s not the only one. It’s not just about watching Bad Girls get their comeuppance, though. Méliès did not have a tragic end in his 1901 short film, but instead a victorious ending for Red Riding Hood, who is rescued in the nick of time and then shown at the end in the pose of St Michael Fighting the Dragon, skewering the wolf from her position on a pedestal of enormous galettes and butter pots, surrounded by cooking implements.1\n\nI guess it appeals for the ‘damsel in distress’ trope in silent films being rescued from the lecherous cad antagonist by the hero, and also has scope for a bit of feisty heroine action, and can be as titillating as censorship allowed, so it’s a very simple winning formula whether animated or live action. You don’t need many cast members, the set is pretty easy to throw up in a pinch, and it’s not a complicated series of scenes to shoot. So all in all, it’s a winner? Since multiple versions came out almost every single bloody year, it would certainly seem so!\n\nWoefully lacking in the cannibalism department here, though. Tragically underrepresented.\n\nWhat I do think is interesting here is how the retellings start to diverge – while Western Europe and the USA seem to be predominantly hung up on sexual interpretations, Soviet and Eastern European animations for children/families seem to use this tale as a political allegory, either warning about the ideologies that can devour innocents, or turn it into a narrative of cooperation and coexistence, domesticating the wolf and reducing its capacity for harm. I’m including some of the descriptions here because it’s really interesting to see!\n\nThis list is not comprehensive, but here it is:\n\n1900-1920\n\nLe Petit Chaperon Rouge/Red Riding Hood (1901) dir.

Certainly not the ramshackle troupe of travelling actors who roll into a town in the middle of nowhere one day to perform their take on the story. Nothing seems to be going right for them, but they have no idea just how bad things are about to get.\n\n2016-2022\n\nLon Po Po: A Red-Riding Hood Story from China (2016) dirs.

Artyom Aksenenko, Aleksandr Barshak, Lina Arifulina – modern Russian fantasy retelling: Saving her city from the wolves, Little Red Riding Hood will have to solve the mystery of the disappearance of her father Wolfboy, face her fears in the eyes and find her destiny.\n\nMore Retellings/Reimaginings\n\nI find the shifts towards ecological allegory, saving/domesticating/coexisting with the wolf really interesting, especially where they pick up steam from the 1990s on. Equally, I like the films with Red Riding Hood vibes, where she’s the one who turns out to be the wolf – very Angela Carter. Speaking of whom, I have not forgotten her, I’ve put The Company of Wolves (1984) down below, in the list of films that aren’t exactly direct adaptations of the films. I don’t think Ginger Snaps really counts, as not all werewolf films are Little Red Riding Hood. Dog Soldiers 100% is though, and I won’t change my mind. Plus – there are so many! So many possibilities.\n\nPunahilkka (1968) dir.

Cecelia Condit – 12mins short film. A musical horror story about two young women who are stalked through a shopping mall by the cannibal named Arthur. He follows them home, and here the victims become the aggressors.\n\nWatch on YouTube.\n\nThe Company of Wolves (1984) dir. Neil Jordan – An adaptation of Angela Carter’s fairy tales. Young Rosaleen dreams of a village in the dark woods, where Granny tells her cautionary tales in which innocent maidens are tempted by wolves who are hairy on the inside. As Rosaleen grows into womanhood, will the wolves come for her too?\n\nBye Bye, Chaperon Rouge/Bye Bye, Red Riding Hood (1989) dir. Márta Mészáros – Fanny lives in the forest with her meteorologist mother.

Meanwhile, the police advises that a serial killer is raping and killing young women in the woods around that area. During the night, the group feels trapped and threatened in the castle, guessing who is and where might be the killer.\n\nDog Soldiers (2002) dir. Neil Marshall – Not every werewolf film is Red Riding Hood, but there’s a wood, wolves, and a cottage in this one, so it counts. Plus, it’s my favourite werewolf film – Howl is also up there, but I can’t claim that as a RRH movie I don’t think. Although it’s strangers on a train in a forest. So… maybe.\n\nA squad of British soldiers on training in the lonesome Scottish wilderness find a wounded Special Forces captain and the remains of his team. As they encounter zoologist Megan, it turns out that werewolves are active in the region. They have to prepare for some action as the there will be a full moon tonight…\n\nRed Riding Hood (2003) dir.
