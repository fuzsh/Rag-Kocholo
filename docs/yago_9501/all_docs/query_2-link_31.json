        "text": "Wicked (also known as Wicked: Part One) is an upcoming epic musical fantasy film directed by Jon M. Chu and adapted to the screen by Winnie Holzman and Stephen Schwartz from their 2003 stage musical of the same name, which is in turn based on the 1995 novel of the same name by Gregory Maguire. The film stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, with Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Jeff Goldblum and Michelle Yeoh in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is scheduled for release on November 22, 2024, while the second film, simply titled Wicked: Part Two will be released the following year.\n\nSynopsis\n\nAfter two decades as one of the most beloved and enduring musicals on the stage, Wicked makes its long-awaited journey to the big screen as a spectacular, generation-defining cinematic event this holiday season.\n\nDirected by acclaimed filmmaker Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, In the Heights), Wicked is the first chapter of a two-part immersive, cultural celebration. Wicked Part Two is scheduled to arrive in theaters on November 26, 2025.\n\nWicked, the untold story of the witches of Oz, stars Emmy, Grammy and Tony winning powerhouse Cynthia Erivo (Harriet, Broadway's The Color Purple) as Elphaba, a young woman, misunderstood because of her unusual green skin, who has yet to discover her true power, and Grammy-winning, multi-platinum recording artist and global superstar Ariana Grande as Glinda, a popular young woman, gilded by privilege and ambition, who has yet to discover her true heart.\n\nThe two meet as students at Shiz University in the fantastical Land of Oz and forge an unlikely but profound friendship. Following an encounter with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths. Glinda's unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power, while Elphaba's determination to remain true to herself, and to those around her, will have unexpected and shocking consequences on her future. Their extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West.\n\nThe film also stars Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh as Shiz University's regal headmistress Madame Morrible; Jonathan Bailey (Bridgerton, Fellow Travelers) as Fiyero, a roguish and carefree prince; Tony nominee Ethan Slater (Broadway’s Spongebob Squarepants, Fosse/Verdon) as Boq, an altruistic Munchkin student; Marissa Bode in her feature-film debut as Nessarose, Elphaba's favored sister; and pop culture icon Jeff Goldblum as the legendary Wizard of Oz.\n\nThe cast of characters includes Pfannee and ShenShen, two conniving compatriots of Glinda played by Emmy nominee Bowen Yang (Saturday Night Live) and Bronwyn James (Harlots); a new character created for the film, Miss Coddle, played by Tony nominee Keala Settle (The Greatest Showman) and four-time Emmy winner Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones) as the voice of Dr. Dillamond.\n\nWicked is produced by Marc Platt (La La Land, The Little Mermaid), whose films, television shows and stage productions have earned a combined 46 Oscar nominations, 58 Emmy nominations and 36 Tony nominations, and by multiple Tony winner David Stone (Kimberly Akimbo, Next to Normal), with whom Platt produced the blockbuster Wicked stage musical. The executive producers are David Nicksay, Stephen Schwartz and Jared LeBoff.\n\nBased on the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire, Wicked is adapted for the screen by the stage production’s book writer Winnie Holzman and by legendary Grammy and Oscar winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz. The Broadway stage musical is produced by Universal Stage Productions, Marc Platt, the Araca Group, Jon B. Platt and David Stone.[1]\n\nCast\n\nCynthia Erivo as Elphaba[1]\n\nAriana Grande as Glinda[1]\n\nMichelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible[1]\n\nJeff Goldblum as The Wizard[1]\n\nJonathan Bailey as Fiyero[1]\n\nEthan Slater as Boq[1]\n\nMarissa Bode as Nessarose[1]\n\nBowen Yang as Pfannee[1]\n\nBronwyn James as ShenShen[1]\n\nKeala Settle as Miss Coddle[1]\n\nPeter Dinklage as the voice of Doctor Dillamond[1]\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nIn 2003, the Gregory Maguire novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West was adapted as the Broadway musical Wicked. The musical was produced by Universal Pictures' stage division and directed by Joe Mantello, with musical staging by Wayne Cilento. The Broadway production has inspired long-run productions in Chicago, London's West End, San Francisco, and Los Angeles in the United States, as well as Germany and Japan. It was nominated for ten Tony Awards, winning three, and is the 6th longest-running Broadway show in history, with over 6,100 performances. The original Broadway production starred Idina Menzel as Elphaba and Kristin Chenoweth as Glinda.\n\nIn a 2009 interview, Maguire stated that he had sold the rights to ABC to make an independent non-musical TV adaptation of Wicked. It would not be based on Winnie Holzman's script. On January 9, 2011, it was reported by Entertainment Weekly that ABC would be teaming up with Salma Hayek and her production company to create a TV miniseries of Wicked based solely on Maguire's novel. No further information, such as casting, had been revealed yet.\n\nOriginal Broadway cast members Kristin Chenoweth as Glinda and Idina Menzel as Elphaba were mentioned as possible film leads. Lea Michele and Amy Adams were also rumored to be potential leads. Potential writers included Winnie Holzman and Stephen Schwartz, while J. J. Abrams, Rob Marshall and Ryan Murphy were mentioned as possible candidates for director. In December 2012, following the success of Les Misérables, Marc Platt, also a producer of the stage version, announced the film was going ahead, later confirming the film was aiming for a 2016 release. After a long development, Universal announced in 2017 that the film would be released in theaters on December 20, 2019, with Stephen Daldry directing.\n\nPre-production\n\nIn May 2017, Schwartz stated that the film would feature \"at least two\" new songs. On August 31, 2018, Universal put the film on hold, due to production scheduling, and gave the film adaptation of Cats the release date formerly held by the film. On February 8, 2019, Universal announced a new release date of December 22, 2021, for the Wicked film. On April 1, 2020, Universal put the film on hold once again due to Universal shifting release dates amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and gave Sing 2 the 2021 release date. On October 20, 2020, it was announced that Daldry had left the production due to scheduling conflicts. On February 2, 2021, it was announced that Jon M. Chu will take over as director. In August, Alice Brooks was confirmed as the film's cinematographer, after working with Chu before on the film version of In the Heights. In November, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo were cast to portray Glinda and Elphaba, respectively. In June 2022, Chu confirmed the hiring of Nathan Crowley as production designer. On September 21, 2022, it was reported that Jonathan Bailey has joined the cast as Fiyero. In October 2022, it was announced that Jeff Goldblum was in final talks to star as the Wizard. Goldblum remained in talks by December, when Ethan Slater, Michelle Yeoh, Marissa Bode, Bowen Yang, Bronwyn James, Keala Settle, Aaron Teoh and Colin Michael Carmichael were added to the cast.\n\nAbout preparing for the role of Elphaba, Erivo said to Variety, while expressing her desire to see the stage version on Broadway again before filming: \"I'm relearning everything ... I want to go and see it again. ... When I get to New York at some point I'll pop in and see the show again, that'll be my fifth time.\" She also said at that time that discussions were underway on what the film will look like, particularly its production design and visual style, while confirming the hiring of Paul Tazewell as costume designer. Her request to him for Elphaba's costume when she becomes the Wicked Witch of the West involved \"a Jean Paul Gaultier collection with a 'new world, kind of gilded age' feeling.\"\n\nFilming\n\nPrincipal photography was set to commence in June 2022 at the Sky Studios Elstree facilities in the United Kingdom. In July 2021, Stephen Schwartz indicated there were plans to film in Atlanta in 2021. On April 26, 2022, Chu announced the adaptation will be filmed in two parts, saying:\n\nAs we prepared the production over the last year, it became impossible to wrestle the story of 'Wicked' into a single film without doing some real damage to it ... As we tried to cut songs or trim characters, those decisions began to feel like fatal compromises to the source material that has entertained us all for so many years. We decided to give ourselves a bigger canvas and make not just one 'Wicked' movie but two! With more space, we can tell the story of 'Wicked' as it was meant to be told while bringing even more depth and surprise to the journeys for these beloved characters.\n\nIn June, Stephen Schwartz added, while confirming that a new song will be written for one of the two films:\n\nWe found it very difficult to get past 'Defying Gravity' without a break ... That song is written specifically to bring a curtain down, and whatever scene to follow it without a break just seemed hugely anti-climactic ... Even as a very long single movie, it required us cutting or omitting things that we wanted to include and that we think fans of the show and the story will appreciate. What we have discussed is that changes need to be 'additive,' to use (producer) Marc Platt's term. They need to add something to the story or the characters. They can't just be changes to do something different. I feel confident that by the time the movie is made, if we all continue to have the same degree of input, I could have a conversation with anyone who has a question about any of the changes made from the stage show and justify why I think it's better for the movie.\n\nOn July 18, it was revealed that with the filming process settled at the newly-built Sky Studios in Elstree, England, rehearsals would begin in August with principal photography beginning in November. On December 9, 2022, Chu confirmed on Twitter that filming had begun.\n\nOn September 23, Planning Statement, in support of a planning application submitted on behalf of Western Sky Limited, indicated that outdoor filming would occur at a site being developed at Ivinghoe Turf in Ivinghoe, Buckinghamshire, UK. The original planned shooting dates were between April 6, 2023 and July 14, 2023, with principal photography set to wrap on July 25, 2023, before filming was suspended on July 13, 2023 due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Filming resumed on January 24, 2024 and concluded on January 26, with Chu then revealing that the vocals of the actors during the musical numbers were recorded live on set. Academy Award-winning production sound mixer Simon Hayes collaborated with Chu on the recordings of the actors' vocals, using a variation of the same recording techniques that were implemented on Les Misérables.\n\nPost-production and visual effects\n\nOn February 6, 2024, it was confirmed on Twitter that Industrial Light & Magic will provide the film's visual effects with Pablo Helman serving as visual effects supervisor, and that post-production work was in progress, with Chu working remotely with editor Myron Kerstein via communication through the newly-released Apple Vision Pro.\n\nMusic\n\nThe soundtrack albums for both this film and Wicked Part Two will be released by Republic Records/Verve Label Group, Grande's record label.\n\nMarketing\n\nOn April 16, 2023, first-look pictures of the film were released through social media, featuring Erivo's Elphaba and Grande's Glinda. Exclusive work-in-progress footage from the film, featuring first listens to Grande and Erivo's respective renditions of \"Popular\" and \"Defying Gravity\", was then presented at CinemaCon on April 26, 2023, introduced on stage by Universal Pictures chairwoman Donna Langley. The first trailer for the film premiered during Super Bowl LVIII on February 11, 2024. The film returned to CinemaCon on April 10, 2024 to present new footage and marked the first time the cast and crew appeared together in public to promote the film. Costumes and props were also on display in the lobby of the venue during this event. A featurette featuring behind-the-scenes footage, and interviews with Chu, Erivo and Grande on how much Wicked and Wicked Part Two mean to them as a cinematic passion project, debuted at the 2024 NBCUniversal Upfront event at Radio City Music Hall on May 13, 2024 and was released online shortly after. The official 3-minute theatrical trailer for the film was released on May 15, 2024. A behind-the-scenes television special, Defying Gravity: The Curtain Rises on Wicked, is currently slated to air on November 25, 2024 on NBC to promote the film. However, it is not yet known if this release date may change, as this would now place the special after the film's release date, as opposed to two days before with the original release date of November 27. The network will also host a promotional tie-in for the film during its coverage of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris throughout the summer.\n\nRelease\n\nOriginally announced as one film, Wicked was split into two films in April 2022. The first half, titled simply Wicked, is scheduled to be released theatrically, with engagements in IMAX and Dolby Cinema, on November 22, 2024, by Universal Pictures. It was scheduled to be released theatrically on December 25, 2024, but on March 14, 2023, it was announced that it would be moved up to a release date of November 27 to avoid competition with Avatar 3 and Sonic the Hedgehog 3, the former of which was later delayed to 2025 after Thunderbolts, and later Mufasa: The Lion King took its date. On April 16, 2023 director Jon M. Chu revealed the first look at Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba and Ariana Grande as Glinda. On July 1, 2024, it was reported that the film would be further moved up to a release date of November 22, which now places the film in direct competition with Gladiator II. The move has drawn comparison to the simultaneous release of the films Barbie and Oppenheimer in 2023, known colloquially as \"Barbenheimer.\"[2]\n\nSequel\n\nMain article: Wicked Part Two The direct sequel, Wicked Part Two, is scheduled to be released on November 26, 2025, after previously being set for a December 25, 2025 release.\n\nTrivia\n\nA non-musical film adaptation of Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West was in development during the 1990s. A week after the novel was published, author Gregory Maguire received movie offers from notable figures in Hollywood, the likes of which included Whoopi Goldberg. However, the rights were ultimately optioned by Demi Moore and her then-production company with Universal Pictures attached. Marc Platt was president of production at the studio during this time, and spent about three years developing a screenplay to no avail.[3]\n\nAn early draft of the film was reportedly more faithful to Maguire's novel, but Platt felt that it was too dense and did not explore the relationship between Elphaba and Galinda in depth. Moreover, Platt believed that an accurate adaptation of the novel would require inner dialogue that would be challenging to depict cinematically.[3]\n\nWhile a second draft of the screenplay was being written, composer Stephen Schwartz met with Platt in 1997 and suggested the idea of redeveloping the film as a musical theatre production instead. He had previously discussed it with writer Winnie Holzman, and after presenting it to Platt, the latter saw potential in the musical aspect. Platt narrowed down three key factors that made a musical more fitting for a Wicked adaptation: aligning it with 1939's The Wizard of Oz, music as a way of emphasizing the heightened nature of a fantasy world, and having the characters literally turn to the audience to sing their emotions.[4]\n\nIt took about a year before the final decision was made to adapt Wicked as a musical theatre production, with Schwartz and Holtman attached as the creative team.[4]\n\nGallery\n\nPosters\n\nPromotional Photos\n\nVideos"
