        "text": "Extraordinary Women, Part 2\n\nMy mother, Helen Isabella Estes Seltzer, died Dec. 28, 2010, at the age of 90. She had a life-long interest in family history. In her memory, I compiled profiles of powerful and strong-willed women among her ancestors, thinking those women might inspire her descendants. These brief biographies are grouped according the lines of descent, which are shown afterwards, leading down to the present.\n\nThe number of our ancestors doubles with each generation (two parents, four grandparents, etc.) So mathematically we each should have over 36 quadrillion ancestors in the generation 55 generations ago about 400 AD, when there were only about 200 million people in the entire world. The discrepancy comes from cousins marrying one another, usually with no idea that they were cousins. Everyone of European descent alive today has ancestors in common. Whoever you are, even if you don’t know who your great-grandmother was, some part of my family tree is your family tree. We’re all one family.\n\nGenealogy is not an exact science. Because we don’t have DNA evidence, it’s possible that in some generations the purported father was not the biological father or that in some cases the documentary record is faulty. But an exposition like this shows how, over many generations, an ancestral line can twist and turn, connecting us to cultures and historical events we never imagined. It shows how we are all connected not just to one another but also to the history of western civilization. At least that’s my aim — not to say that a few of us are special, but rather that everyone is special, that this is a template for the ancestry of all of us.\n\nBasina — the Woman Who Knew What She Wanted and Got It\n\nBasina was a queen. She was married to the King of Thuringia. But her husband was neither powerful nor ambitious, and their little kingdom was insignificant. Nothing important ever happened there.\n\nShe wasn’t happy, and she wasn’t going to settle for the life she saw ahead of her. So one day, she just left.\n\nReportedly she said, “I want to have the most powerful man in the world, even if I have to cross the ocean for him.”\n\nThis was around 450 AD, in the days when the Roman Empire was crumbling. The greatest man of the day was Childeric I, King of the Franks, who had recently invaded the Roman Empire and conquered much of Gaul. So she went to Gaul. She asked him to marry her. And he accepted.\n\nShe is now best remembered as the mother of Clovis, who succeeded his father as King of the Franks and is credited as the founder of modern France. Contrary to the tradition of that time and place, she, not her husband, gave their son his name.\n\nBy the way, her name in Low Franconian means “female boss”.\n\nClotilde — the Vengeful Saint Who Converted France to Christianity\n\ndaughter-in-law of Basina\n\nClotilde’s grandfather, King Gondioc, ruled a kingdom that extended from Lyon to Vienna to Geneva. When King Gondiocdied, his three sons — Gundobad, Godesgisel, and Chilperic (Clotilde’s father) — divided the realm among them. Chilperic became Duke of Burgundy. But soon thereafter, Gundobad murdered both of Clotilde’s parents, took control of Burgundy, and exiled Clotilde.\n\nIn exile, Clotilde married Clovis, King of the Franks, who, had just conquered northern Gaul.\n\nAt the instigation of Clotilde, Clovis converted to Christianity and forced his entire kingdom to do likewise. That’s what earned Clotilde her sainthood.\n\nClovis went down in history as the founder of modern France. And in the novel “The Da Vinci Code” he is named as a descendant of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene\n\nEventually, Clotilde took revenge for the murder of her parents, inciting her sons against her cousin King Sigismund of Burgundy, the son of Gundobad. That was the cause of the Burgundian War, which led to Sigismund’s deposition, imprisonment, and assassination.\n\nThe poetry of that time portrayed her as “a type of a savage fury.”\n\nLine of Descent for the above\n\n1) Basina, Queen of Thuringia (md.
