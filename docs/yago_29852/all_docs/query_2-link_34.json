Her mother was Agnes of Rochlitz.She is called Marie by some of the French chroniclers.\n\nIn June 1196 Agnes married Philip II of France, who had repudiated hissecond wife Ingeborg of Denmark in 1193. Pope Innocent III espoused thecause of Ingeborg; but Philip did not submit until 1200, when, ninemonths after interdict had been added to excommunication, he consented toa separation from Agnes. She died broken-hearted in July of the nextyear, at the castle of Poissy, and was buried in the Convent of StCorentin, near Nantes. Her two children by Philip, Philip I, Count ofBoulogne and Mary, were legitimized by the Pope in 1201 at the request ofthe King. Little is known of the personality of Agnes, beyond theremarkable influence which she seems to have exercised over Philip.\n\nShe has been made the heroine of a tragedy by François Ponsard, Agnès deMéranie, and of an opera by Vincenzo Bellini, La straniera.\n\nJUL 1201 - Death - ; Poissy\n\n1196 - Reign - Queen consort ; France\n\nPARENT (M) Berthold, Duke of MeraniaBirthDeathMarriageto Agnes of Rochlitz FatherBerthold I of IstriaMotherHedwig of WittelsbachPARENT (F) Agnes of RochlitzBirthDeathMarriageto Berthold, Duke of Merania FatherDedi III, Margrave of LusatiaMotherMatilda of HeinsburgCHILDRENFGertrude of MeraniaBirthDeathMarriageto Andrew II of Hungary FAgnes of MeraniaBirthDeathPoissyMarriageto Philip II of France\n\nPARENT (M) Philip II of FranceBirthDeathMarriageto Isabelle of Hainaut Marriageto Agnes of Merania FatherLouis VII of FranceMotherAdèle of ChampagnePARENT (F) Agnes of MeraniaBirthDeathPoissyMarriageto Philip II of France FatherBerthold, Duke of MeraniaMotherAgnes of RochlitzCHILDREN\n\n1 Agnes of Merania d: JUL 1201"
