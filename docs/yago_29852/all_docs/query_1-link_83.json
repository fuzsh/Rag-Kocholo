        "text": "The Teutonic Knights are mostly known for their exploits in the Baltics where they formed their own state and had a lasting impact on the history of the region. They were a monastic military order formed during the Crusades in the Holy Land in late 12th century and eventually ended up going to Prussia in 1226 where they would establish themselves as a permanent presence for centuries, playing a crucial role in the ongoing Baltic Crusades and beyond. However they also took part in a largely forgotten expedition of which Iâ€™m going to write about in this article. From 1211 to 1225, the Teutonic Knights were present in Transylvania at the request of the King of Hungary Andrew II to fight against the nomadic pagan Cuman tribes there. This topic also provides a good opportunity to explore the origins of this monastic order and help us understand why the Teutonic Order developed in the way that it did.\n\nA reconstruction of Teutonic Knights fighting against pagan Cumans as part of the their expedition in Transylvania. From: David Nicolle, Teutonic Knight 1190-1561 (Osprey, 2007), page 33."
