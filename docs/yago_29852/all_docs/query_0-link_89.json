        "text": "St. Elizabeth of Hungary (born 1207, probably Pressburg, Hungary [now Bratislava, Slovakia]—died November 17, 1231, Marburg, Thuringia [now Hesse, Germany]; canonized 1235; feast day November 17) was a princess of Hungary whose devotion to the poor (for whom she relinquished her wealth) made her an enduring symbol of Christian charity, of which she is a patron saint.\n\nThe daughter of King Andrew II of Hungary, she was betrothed in infancy to Louis IV, son of Hermann I, landgrave of Thuringia, at whose court she was brought up. The marriage, which occurred when Louis succeeded his father in 1221, proved to be ideal but brief. Louis died in 1227 of plague at Otranto, Italy, en route to the Sixth Crusade. When his brother Henry assumed the regency, Elizabeth left and took refuge with her uncle, Bishop Eckbert of Bamberg. No longer caring for position or wealth, she joined the Third Order of St. Francis, a lay Franciscan group. At Marburg she built a hospice for the poor and sick, to whose service she devoted the rest of her life. She put herself under the spiritual direction of Konrad von Marburg, an ascetic of incredible harshness and severity, who belonged to no specific order. She died before her 24th birthday in 1231 and was canonized just four years later."
