        "text": "Hedvika (Hedwig) was born into a family of dukes from Diessen-Andechs some time between 1170 and 1178 (the most frequently given date is 1174). She was the daughter of Berthold VI (†1204), one of the most important members of the dynasty. As the Duke of Merania, Berthold was one of Bavaria’s most influential men. Hedvika’s mother was Agnes of Wettin (Rochlitz) (†1195), the daughter of Dedi V, the margrave of Lower Lusatia, a province bordering on Silesia.\n\nAs was the custom at the time, Hedvika’s upbringing was entrusted to the Benedictine nuns of Lutzingen when she was five years old. She received a very thorough education. She was originally to be betrothed to Toljen, the son of the Serbian king Miroslav, but this plan came to nothing and instead she was engaged to Henry the Bearded, the Piast Duke of Silesia, whom she married at some time between 1186 and 1190. Hedvika had become used to convent life, fervently reading the Holy Bible, and now she had to live in a land where a Slavic language was spoken. Although she had to carry out family duties, she also accompanied her husband on his journeys and court appearances, and soon gained a reputation – even among the local Polish population – as a generous ally. She cared for the poor and sick, whom she saw as similar to the crucified Christ, regardless of their nationality.\n\nSoon, however, fate turned against her. Pfalzgrave Otto von Wittelsbach asked for her daughter’s hand in marriage. The king of Germany, Philip of Swabia, warned Henry and Hedvika that Otto had a violent nature. When Otto found out, he had the king murdered, and was excommunicated by the Holy Roman Emperor. Among his supporters were Hedvika’s brothers Egbert and Henry. All were executed, and the castle of Andechs was razed to the ground. Hedvika’s sister, Gertrude of Merania, married the Hungarian king Andrew II and was murdered in 1214. Her sons Henry and Konrad became embroiled in a fratricidal war; Konrad was defeated and later died after falling from his horse. Hedvika’s husband, Henry the Bearded, died in 1238 as a result of military conflicts among factions in Poland, and her favourite son Henry II the Pious fell in battle against the Tartars (1241)."
