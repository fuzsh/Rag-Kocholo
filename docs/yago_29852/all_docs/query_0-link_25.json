She was the daughter of King Andrew II of Hungary and Gertrude of Merania.\n\nElizabeth was married at the age of 14, and widowed at 20. She then became one of the first members of the newly founded Third Order of St. Francis, relinquished her wealth to the poor, and built hospitals, where she herself served the sick. She became a symbol of Christian charity in Germany and elsewhere after her death at the age of 24."
