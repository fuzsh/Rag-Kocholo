A pupil of the painters Jean Bouillon and Michel de Bordeaux (from 1621), he trained together with Jacques Fouquières and Nicolas Poussin, to whom he always remained close from deep friendship. He had as a pupil his nephew Jean-Baptiste de Champaigne, who joined him in Paris from Brussels in 1643 and worked with him on the decorations of various royal apartments.\n\nAlready in the early years of his career he abandoned both the first baroque trends, the result of his early artistic education, and the influences of Rubens, to orient himself towards a more measured https://www.anticswiss.com/en/antique-dealer-profile/5\">Villa Stampanoni Manfredini Fiaschi\n\nExcellent and large oil painting on canvas depicting the portrait of a Knight in armor belonging to the Royal Order of Saint Louis, France early 1700s, extraordinarily realistic of an amazing quality, painting attributed to François Jouvenet 1664-1749 called Jouvenet the Younger.\n\nThe work is framed by a beautiful carved and gilded oak wood frame called \"à la Berain, original chassis with fixed couplings.\n\nOn a night of battle under a dark and foggy sky, the artillery returns to roar its last cannon shots, the lord is its commander, the architect of the next victory, a valiant noble, a knight of the Royal Order of San Luigi.\n\nThe pose of our lord is royal, canonical to all officers of rank, portrayed standing at three quarters and with his gaze fully towards the viewer, illuminated by the glare of war, and posed.\n\nA powdered and combed face of a large léonine wig, in the fashion of the kingdom, lets long reddish curls fall on a shimmering armor, while a fluffy red velvet cloak surrounds it and highlights its figure in the dark of the night, a knotted white jabot at the neck in the French manner of the time, it marks the noble belonging, accompanied by a showy medal of the Royal and Military Order of St. Louis, pinned on the cuirass and ending with a fluttering purple red velvet bow.

It is considered the ancestor of the legion of honor, with the same functions. The King of France was the Grand Master of the Order and the Dauphin was automatically a member from birth.\n\nThe Order was made up of three classes:\n\n- Knight of the Grand Cross\n\n- Commander\n\n- Knight\n\nThe entire order included a maximum of 8 Grand Crosses, 28 Commanders and a variable number of Knights and, in addition to the Grand Master, it also admitted the offices of Treasurer, Recorder and Gentleman Usher.

Towards 1650 the dresses will become more and more low-cut, arriving at a décolleté that will allow a glimpse of the shoulders, the back and the junction of the breast, the neckline will become increasingly wider. The rich, large and starched back-hanging collars will disappear and will give way to wide shawl and lacy collars.\n\nAs well as the long constricting bodices, will give way to \"bustier\", less rigid and shorter, in linen, which they will put away the waist in its natural position. A series of petticoats will support and inflate the woman in a more natural way, the first dresses in black silk will pass to more flamboyant colors. The hair is more and more constantly collected, with long locks on the side of the face, curled with hot irons and let fall on the shoulders, while the rest of the hair will be collected in a large chignon; this fashion was nicknamed Hurluberlu from the French (crazy-bizarre), born from the disheveled and natural hair of the goddess Nell Gwynne, lover of the royal ruler of England. Hats and caps are no longer mandatory, and ladies of rank can have themselves portrayed even in public places and outdoors.\n\nTo bring out the whitish whiteness of the skin, mercury-based cosmetics and lead-based powders were used.

She is dressed in a beautiful black silk dress, with voluminous sleeves and a wide shawl neckline, ending and joined at the front by the typical black velvet lace bow, accompanied by a four-diamond brooch and pear-shaped pearl pendant; as well as the parure composed of earrings and pearl necklace \"unions d'excellence\" illuminates a complexion of a bright and shining powdered face, the girl's eyes are clear, illuminated, alive, and the smile is hinted at just enough.\n\nLong, casual, out-of-bun curls fall naturally over the shoulders, while others, smaller ones surround and adorn the face like drooping laces.\n\nThe pose is the natural one, the model seems happy to pose, graceful on the edge of a hinted and velvety armchair, observes the viewer, aware of her social level, showing all her beauty.\n\nThe master portrays her, making it a masterpiece, with skilful gentle and precise brush strokes he will capture the sensuality of the model, combining the attributes which will show us the message of love, a message that will remain in our hearts forever.\n\nThe certificate of origin and authenticity is available and will accompany the work, guaranteeing its objective authenticity.\n\nMr Sergio Schina\n\nVilla Stampanoni Antiques\n\nWhats' App +39 3386233246\n\nWith pleasure, we present to lovers of Samurai culture, this wonderful armor dating from the early 18th century of the Edo period. This particular armor or Yoroi possesses an exuberant five-plate Kabuto, having the Maedate depicting some leaves and flowers of Paulownia.\n\nThe kamon in symbolism and in this case takes the name of kiri-mon; since ancient times the Paulownia tree has been highly regarded as a favorite place of the Chinese phoenix. This Paulownia leaf and flower symbol was used by the Japanese imperial court in the Kamamura period.\n\nThere are several variants with different arrangements of the leaves and flowers, arranged differently depending on the historical period and the clan they belong to; ours in particular was granted to the Toyotomi clan and consequently also to the most deserving servants, so many families of Samurai warriors, came from all over Japan to lend their militancy in the Toyotomi clan in the ancient province of Owari in Japan.\n\nThe kiri-mon today is used as the official symbol of the Prime Minister of Japan and is still the symbol of status and high government office. At the upper end a thick Hokkaido (Japanese Wolf) fur covers the top of the kabuto making the armor unique in its kind. Our face mask forged in iron and called Mempo, comes with a sort of horsehair mustache accompanied by the Nodowa that part of protection that went to defend the throat, the most precious mempos have smiles, grins and grimaces, all poses taken from the characters of the Japanese theater, their purpose as well as protection was also to scare the opponent, a small hole sometimes appears at the base of the Mempo, for the escape of sweat.\n\nThe rest of the armor is well preserved and original from the Edo period, including the bamboo container case with hinges and hand forged iron closure. Recall that the Warlord delegated the most skilled gunsmiths in the construction of his own armor, and the blacksmith who performed this work was certainly, in the Edo period, a master gunsmith perhaps elevated to the rank of Bakufu, the highest rank for an armourer of Japanese armor, an honor for him and for all the descendants of the family.\n\nA valid Certificate of Authenticity will be issued to the buyer.\n\nSergio Schina\n\nAntique dealer at Villa Stampanoni\n\nExtraordinary samurai warrior armor, from the Meiji period (1852 - 1912) coming from a private collection in Kanagawa prefecture in Japan.\n\nThe armor is in excellent condition, sturdy and very heavy, beautiful in the combinations, immediately you are struck by its special workmanship and meticulous attention to detail, the laces in silk and sand-colored cotton join the relative plates, while the parts in leather and golden damask finishes complete the creation of the builder gunsmith.\n\nThe helmet of the type (Koboshi Kuro Bachi) consists of 12 (ken) iron plates, riveted with 48 large protruding nails and arranged in rows of 6.\n\nThe (Maedate) has two long stylized brass buffalo horns ( kuwagata) placed on the visor of the kabuto, in the center a sculpture in gilded and stylized wood with a dragon motif stands out on the helmet, this symbol derives from the Shinto culture, linked to the adoration of divinities and natural spirits.\n\nThe mask (Mempo) protects the face in its entirety, in embossed iron of the type (ryubu men), with a sweet and serene expression, deriving from the Japanese theatrical culture.\n\nThe (Agemaki) come in yellow cotton rope, and fall into 7 tassels on the armor.\n\nThe sleeves (Kote) are presented with long rods joined with an iron coat and finished in the golden damask attachment, as well as the leg protectors (Suneate) with his (Tateage) are also in golden damask.\n\nThe shoulder pads (Sode) are large in size embellished with long ropes and golden tassels, covered inside with a raw black fabric.\n\nThe central structure or cuirass of the type (D? - maru) is presented instead in brown deerskin, divided into 17 sections or plates, joined with silk and cotton laces both on the back and on the front of the armor.

This position is one of the 100 most important positions, as it represents the moment when Siddhartha Gautama, the founding master of Buddhism, later called Buddha, was sitting waiting for Nirvana, that's right, sitting under a large fig tree called Bodhi.\n\nRecall that the Bodhi tree, also called sacred fig, was located within the area where the Mahabodhi Temple now stands, in the Indian state of Bihar. According to tradition, Siddhartha Gautama meditating under the fig tree finds the strength and commitment to free himself from the darkness that was invading him in anticipation of the light. With the fingers of the right hand the Siddhartha touches the earth, and she goes to their aid by making the demon Mara flee. The Bodhi tree therefore indicates awakening, spiritual enlightenment, having been enlightened means seeing everyday life with clarity of truth, thus unhinging any form of ignorance or illusion.\n\nObserving the Buddha, you can see the semi-precious stones of different colors that sublime adorn the sacred sculpture, the gold reflects its heat, everything exudes positivity and inner beauty, this positivity is also perceived simply by looking at the photos. It is said that in China during the nineteenth century the Buddhist monks elected to the forge of sacred sculptures, before starting the work, considered it appropriate to seek deep meditation through prayer, even remaining without food and water for long days.\n\nA Certificate of Origin and Historical Authenticity will be attached to the sculpture.\n\nThis document certifies that the article is totally original and from the first half of the 19th century.\n\nMr Sergio Schina\n\nVilla Stampanoni Antiques\n\nAntique Paintings / Samurai Art\n\nWhats' App +39.338.6233246"
