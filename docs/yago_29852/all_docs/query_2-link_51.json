        "text": "As we gather this Holy Thursday, we remember once again the example that Christ gives us to live in the services of others (John 13:1-15). We can only do this because of the love He has already generously given us, by being His beloved sons and daughters. The word ‘Maundy’ is derived from the Latin word, mandatum which reminds us that our call to imitate Him in loving service is not merely a suggestion or optional extra, but an order or command. The washing of the feet is symbolic of how we are called to give to those who will not give us anything back in return (Acts 20:35). Our first receiving from Christ enables us to give to others. This causes us to reflect on ways in which we might be able to respond the question of Jesus as he asks, ‘do you understand what I have done to you?’ The literal washing of His disciples’ feet extends to us today spiritually as we participate in the sacraments and receive the good things that God continues to give us. How then might we wash one another’s feet? How can we actively answer the call of our Lord and Master? For many, this may be in small ways this Easter. For others, bigger gestures are possible. In light of this, there still remains a high number of men, women, and children seeking to flee Ukraine as war rages in its third year. The SJOG Homes for Ukraine scheme seeks sponsors who may have a spare bedroom in their home or empty property that could accommodate an individual or family for 6 months, to help those that are fleeing the terrible war settle into life in the UK. So far, the Catholic community in England and Wales have responded very generously, with many Ukrainian people now living here, miles away from the war zone. As of March 2024, our project has successfully matched 139 guests, and this shortly set to rise with the approval of more visas in the next few weeks. We have also indirectly supported more than 300 people through webinars and offline events. However, the need is still great. The number of families still waiting to find a home is over 2000. Hosting displaced people is a great way to learn about different cultures and build new friendships. To read about just one family that have benefitted enormously from their UK hosts’ generosity, head to our Do Justice website and read Anna’s story at www.dojustice.co.uk. If there is any possibility that you may be able to offer an empty room in your home, please get in contact with us at homesforukraine@SJOG.org.uk or visit the project website at https://lnkd.in/eYbeYUkb.\n\nThe Baptists invest money in India.

The author wrote an essential book for Christians, as many may not be aware of what goes on in the churches that they attend and how ministers, bishops, and pastors run their places of worship. In this book, Rondinone includes biblical references, how to worship, and what to look out for in a pastor and a church. While some people may find this book a bit controversial, the author’s aim is to improve Christian worship and the growth of churches worldwide. I appreciate how Rondinone is raw and writes about the good, bad, and ugly sides of what’s often concealed in places of worship. His intentions are clear in that he aims to guide individuals to find a church with high leadership standards and scriptural ideas. It’s essential and vital to ask questions before joining a church, and the author offers a comprehensive checklist with features often skipped or forgotten. Rondinone provides an in-depth look at the importance of joining a place of worship with programs for various groups, such as men, women, youth, children, and ample accommodations for weddings, social gatherings, and community involvement. He also invites readers to review a church’s principles concerning being a charitable ministry, how well leadership supports members, and other elements that contribute to being an excellent place to worship. The author also covers the ability of a church to closely follow the doctrines of the Christian faith, if the leadership is qualified, and how they ordain pastors and ministers. The book thoroughly delves into all aspects of practicing one’s faith and finding the right church for worship and community. The Church of God or Church of Man by James Rondinone is a respectful, insightful look at churches and a guide for Christians and those unfamiliar with organizational structures and scriptural ideas. It’s a compelling read, and I recommend it as it brings positive changes and guidance in finding the right path for worship while promoting well-organized churches and supportive ordained leaders.

Did he Teach “Prosperity Gospel” or “Charity Doctrine” or both? CHRIST Taught the same that CONTEXT for we CANNOT SERVE GOD and MONEY (must CHOOSE one) is CHARITY DOCTRINE by RELATIVE MEASURE in the same CHAPTER when DISCUSSING this VERSE in Luke 16:9 – 13 as shown in next SLIDE 288 [From Page 581/662 onward of the #ChiliasmBook]. So not getting in right in doctrine of money can lead to hell (Let God Decide) and they way a pastor/priest preaches about money part, I usually can make my mind about their level of truth or understanding or mostly honesty even in light of these Bible Verses. Peace to you. 1) The MONEY in CHRIST’s PARABLES refers to CHARITY DOCTRINE ACTS done with literal money and/or with the TEACHINGS including NEW TESTAMENT TRADITIONS of the CHURCH shared for FREE as much as possible “… 1. Since therefore we have such proofs, it is not necessary to seek the truth among others which it is easy to obtain from the Church; since the apostles, like a rich man [depositing his money] in a bank, lodged in her hands most copiously all things pertaining to the truth: so that every man, whosoever will, can draw from her the water of life. Revelation 22:17 For she is the entrance to life; all others are thieves and robbers. … For how should it be if the apostles themselves had not left us writings? Would it not be necessary, [in that case,] to follow the course of the tradition which they handed down to those to whom they did commit the Churches? …” – Blessed St. Irenaeous of Lyons, a Hearer of Blessed St. Polycarp, First Doctor of the Church in order of time, Father of Catholic Theology, CHILIASM Church Father (c. 130 AD - c. 202 AD, ‘Against Heresies’, (Book 3(III), Chapter 4), Point 1) Roman Catholic Source: https://lnkd.in/gieR5q-D 2) Note Luke 16:9 – 13 applies in CONTEXT of ETERNAL HOME for EVERY CHRISTIAN and NOT for some Christian only to do CHARITY DOCTRINE (by Relative Measure unless no money understood as those receiving it, right?) , can you see it here in BIBLE VERSES by CHRIST? \"... 9Here’s the lesson: USE YOUR WORLDLY RESOURCES to BENEFIT OTHERS AND MAKE FRIENDS. Then, when your possessions are gone, they will welcome you to an ETERNAL HOME. 10“If you are faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones. But if you are dishonest in little things, you won’t be honest with greater responsibilities. 11And IF YOU ARE UNTRUSTWORTHY ABOUT WORLDLY WEALTH, who will trust you with the TRUE RICHES OF HEAVEN? 12And if you are not faithful with other people’s things, why should you be trusted with things of your own? 13“No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and be enslaved to money.” …” – The KING, Most Blessed Lord Jesus Christ (Luke 16:9 – 13, NLT) TQ\n\nThe Baptists invest money in India.
