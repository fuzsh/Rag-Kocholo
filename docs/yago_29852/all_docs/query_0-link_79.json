        "text": "(L-R) Dr. Tamás Sulyok, Dr. János Martonyi, Dr. E. Sylvester Vizi, Dr. László Trócsányi, István Fodor\n\nIt is our pleasure to inform you that the proceedings of the Golden Bull Conference entitled Decretum of our Hungarianness – Our Civilisational Heritage organised by the Friends of Hungary Foundation are available.\n\nAs Prof. Dr. E. Sylvester Vizi, Chair of the Friends of Hungary Foundation said nation, sovereignty, Christian faith and freedom are among our most important values, their preservation serves and ensures the further growth of the Hungarian nation. It is in the spirit of these thoughts that the Friends of Hungary Foundation’s bilingual volume Decretum of our Hungarianness – 800 Years of the Golden Bull 1022-2022 was born. Its celebratory book launch in the framework of the Conference was held on 24 April 2023, the Memorial Day of the Golden Bull. The venue was the Károlyi-Csekonics Palace. The volume available in English: https://friendsofhungary.hu/Media/Default/dokumentumok/Magyarsagunk%20Decretuma_teljes_konyv.pdf\n\nDistinguished and eminent Speakers shared their valuable reflections in the Conference, on the future of Europe, about the nation states and national constitutions in the European Union, highlighting the civilizational legacy of the Golden Bull and its impact to this day. Keynote speaker was Prof. Dr. Tamás Sulyok, President of the Constitutional Court of Hungary. Further speakers were Prof. Dr. E. Sylvester Vizi, Chair of the Friends of Hungary Foundation, former President of the Hungarian Academy of Science; Prof. Dr. János Martonyi, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and Member of the Board of Trustees of the Friends of Hungary Foundation; Prof. Dr. László Trócsányi, Member of the European Parliament, Rector of the Károli Gáspár University of the Reformed Church in Hungary; Mr. István Fodor, Member of the Board of Trustees of the Friends of Hungary Foundation and former Chairman of Ericsson Hungary.\n\nA celebratory moment of the Conference was the welcome given to the internationally famous opera singer Ms. Éva Marton, whom the Friends of Hungary Foundation honours as one of its Founding Members. During her unique career, she was the most noted performer of all time in the role of Gertrude of Merania, the wife of King Andrew II, in Ferenc Erkel's opera Bánk bán. It was a pleasure for conference participants to see Éva Marton's majestic Queen's entrance from the film and to greet the artist in person.\n\nAmong the objectives of the Conference was to strengthen the Hungarian government’s objective to ensure that Hungary's historic constitution takes its rightful place in the European constitutional, political, cultural and civilizational heritage. Please welcome the publication in which you can read about the details of the Conference, completed with related materials."
