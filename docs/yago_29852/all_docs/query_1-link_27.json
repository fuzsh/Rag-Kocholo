        "text": "After the death of Louis I of Hungary (and Poland), his eldest living daugher, Mary was crowned King of Hungary. Her reign however proved to be rather unpopular. It was Mother-Queen Elisabeth and a clique led by Palatine Nicholas Garai who actually governed the country, and their inept policies soon turned a good deal of the nobility against them. The question of whom should Mary marry became the centerpoint of clashes. The Mother-Queen's faction supported a match with the younger brother of Charles VI of France, Louis, while another faction supported a match with Sigismund of Luxemburg. The French match was extremely unpopular due to the ongoing Western Schism (where Hungary and France were oppositiely aligned), however not every wanted to see Sigismund on the throne either. As a result, soon emerged a new faction led by the Horvátis, who invited Charles III of Naples to the Hungarian throne.\n\nCharles accepted the invitiation, set sail towards Hungary and landed at Zengg in late October(1385). His immense popularity in the country (he grew up in King Louis' court) helped him gain the upper hand, which resulted first the French match being broken, then Sigismund fleeing the country. Not so long after, Mary was also forced to abdicate. Charles was crowned King of Hungary on 1385 December 35th. Despite Mary's abdication, Charles actively involved her in the governance in the country, treating her almost like a co-ruler. On the other hand, the Mother-Queen and Garai got sidelined. As a result, the two instigated the murder of the king. Charles was attacked on the 7th of February 1386 by Balázs Forgách (master of the cupbearers) and died after more than two weeks of suffering. He ruled the country for mere 56 days.\n\nBut what if things turned out different? Let's say Forgách fails to injure the king and gets himself captured instead. Following his interrogation, Garai and the Mother-Queen's involvement becomes evident and Charles imprisons both of them. After this affair, Charles slowly begins to consolidate his power. Mary gets engaged to Charles' son, Ladislaus, and the two of them actually marry some years later.\n\nLet's say Charles rules Hungary and Naples for about another 15-20 years. Following his death, Ladislaus (who has already been crowned by this point) succeeds him in both his realms without problem. Ladislaus and Mary have children, and their line continues on for centuries (maybe even to modern day?).\n\nNow, what kind of consequences could all this have? First, how could Charles II/III's reign look like? Would he be any better at checking the Turkish advance than Sigismund? Could something akin to OTL's Crusade of Nicopolis still takes place? If yes, could the participation of Neapolitan forces or the difference in leadership tip the balance? What other notable events could change ITTL? What do you think?\n\nCharles accepted the invitiation, set sail towards Hungary and landed at Zengg in late October(1385).

So I think at least first 4-5 years of Charles's continued rule would be marked by conflict with Sigismund.\n\nNow, what kind of consequences could all this have?

If yes, could the participation of Neapolitan forces or the difference in leadership tip the balance? What other notable events could change ITTL? What do you think?\n\nWell, Charles was more militarily capable than Sigismund, he'd have Neapolitan forces also on his side and as far as I know had also capable subordinates (military-wise) and considering his main base of support was Croatian nobility (Croatians continued to fight for his son even beyond his death and Sigismund spent a lot of time on pacifying them) he'd be willing to dedicate his time and resources to the front, however, he'd be also more diplomatically isolated than Sigismund, he also didn't have good relationship with Urban VI when he died (he got excommunicated) and turning to Avignon would be no-go option because French interests directly contradicted Charles's reign in Naples, also I imagine surviving Charles (especially after Forgach and co. got exposed) would favour Croatian nobility as they were most loyal towards him, also considering Charles would need to deal with both Turks and Neapolitan affairs, he could move main royal residence to somewhere in Croatia as that would be best location to keep both Balkan and Italian affairs in check (probably not Zagreb, maybe some large city in Dalmatia, because most probably he'd manage to keep it).\n\nLet's say Charles rules Hungary and Naples for about another 15-20 years.

So I think at least first 4-5 years of Charles's continued rule would be marked by conflict with Sigismund.\n\nThat's a good point. I suppose this would force Charles to declare his son of age rather early (14-15?). Still, a long conflict with Sigismund would certainly be a strain. Could the threat posed by Bohemia be counterbalanced somehow? A Habsburg alliance?\n\nWell, Charles was more militarily capable than Sigismund, he'd have Neapolitan forces also on his side and as far as I know had also capable subordinates (military-wise) and considering his main base of support was Croatian nobility (Croatians continued to fight for his son even beyond his death and Sigismund spent a lot of time on pacifying them) he'd be willing to dedicate his time and resources to the front, however, he'd be also more diplomatically isolated than Sigismund, he also didn't have good relationship with Urban VI when he died (he got excommunicated) and turning to Avignon would be no-go option because French interests directly contradicted Charles's reign in Naples, also I imagine surviving Charles (especially after Forgach and co. got exposed) would favour Croatian nobility as they were most loyal towards him, also considering Charles would need to deal with both Turks and Neapolitan affairs, he could move main royal residence to somewhere in Croatia as that would be best location to keep both Balkan and Italian affairs in check (probably not Zagreb, maybe some large city in Dalmatia, because most probably he'd manage to keep it).\n\nThe Horvátis were certainly extremely loyal to his family, but Charles himself could also count on the support of Stephen II Lackfi, so it's not like he would be lacking in support outside of Croatia and Slavonia. Still, if he would set up his court in Croatia, then I guess the most likely place for that would be either Zengg or Zara. As long as Sigismund poses a threat though, I think it would be more likely that Charles remains in Hungary Proper for the time being. His possible residences could be: Buda, Visegrád or Fehérvár.\n\nUrban VI would still die in 1389 (most likely), so that part won't be problem for too long. Admittedly, this and the issue with Sigismund would certainly keep Charles' hold on power rather shaky in the first few years.\n\nAnother interesting topic is the Balkans. IOTL both King Tvrtko and Prince Lazar fought against Sigismund, but I'm not sure how they would act ITTL. Maybe Lazar could side with Charles and Tvrtko with Sigismund. Considering the strength of Charles' powerbase in Croatia and Slavonia, a campaign against Bosnia might not be out of the question. A succesfull campaign could force Tvrtko to accept Charles as his suzerain and to return whatever lands he recently took over (most notably Kotor). In a more extreme case, Usora and Soli could also be taken from the Bosnian king. As banates, those lands could serve well to placate Charles' followers.\n\nA consequence of this little episode could be that Tvrtko wouldn't be in a position to send support to Lazar agaisnt the Turks, but Charles might be. OTL's Battle of Kosovo had very specific circumstances and results, so any kind of alteration to it could unleash tons of butterflies. IOTL both Lazar and Murad died and the battle was inconclusive, but this time around? Who knows...\n\nUnder the rules of that site it could continue as long as you want to, but if they had more than one son it'd be more probable + second one would be probably pushed forward as heir of Mary's claim to Poland, as Hedwig would still bear no children, the best option would be to marry that second son to https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadwiga_Jagiellonka_(1408–1431).\n\nHedwig would only be 16 when OTL's Władisław III is born. How likely would she already be married to Ladislaus and Mary's second son? Wouldn't Jogaila try to break the match to ensure the succession of his son? Either way, a war of Polish succession seems likely in this scenario.\n\n(Btw, any name ideas for Ladislaus and Mary's children?)\n\nThat's a good point.

Either way, a war of Polish succession seems likely in this scenario.\n\n(Btw, any name ideas for Ladislaus and Mary's children?)\n\nI thought about Jogaila just giving up his marriage to Sophia and trying for a son, since he would know that he wouldn't win the war, so it's better to secure inheritance for his grandson than wage pointless war. Wasn't Lackfi family pretty strongly connected to Croatia? Stephen I Lackfi held the title of Ban of Croatia, bulk of Stephan II estates was near Medimurje in Croatia, and there exists also Croatian version of their surname, Lačkovič, Stephen II was killed during session of Croatian parliament, the progenitor of their family, Lack was described in Latin as \"Ladislaus comes Syculorum\" , so using latinized Slavic word, not latinized Hungarian word (would be \"Lasclo\" or something, tho I don't know if they even used that form in Latin or just used only Ladislaus). Campaign against Bosnia is likely and between Zadar and Senj, I think Charles would choose Senj as main royal residence after chasing out Sigismund for good. Ladislaus and Mary's children would be probably Ladislaus Jr, Charles Jr, Louis, Mary Jr, Elizabeth, Stephen, Margaret, Robert, maybe some Croatian name to appease Croatians.\n\nI thought about Jogaila just giving up his marriage to Sophia and trying for a son, since he would know that he wouldn't win the war, so it's better to secure inheritance for his grandson than wage pointless war.\n\nIn that case, what would be the fate of Lithuania? Would Sigismund (if he even wins against Švitrigaila in the first place) be willing to accept Hedwig and her husband as his overlords? If not, could Hedwig and her husband take over Lithuania by force? I personally think that Švitrigaila would probably be able to retain power in Lithuania (so the union with Poland would be broken), but he would lose some Western regions to the Polish (all of Volhynia, Podolia). What do you think?\n\nWasn't Lackfi family pretty strongly connected to Croatia?

The family was a branch of the Hermanns, a German genus (supposedly hailing from the vicinity of Nuremberg) that arrived in Hungary alongside with Gertrude of Merania (Andrew II's notorious wife). Before the Anjous reign, the Lackfi family's possessions were mainly found in Transylvania and the Eastern part of the kingdom. It was under the Anjous, when the family started to accumulate lands in Transdanubia, chiefly in Zala and Tolna counties. (Btw, Medimurje was in Zala county, not Croatia. Furthermore, Medimurje was adjacent to Slavonia, not Croatia, since Croatia at the time only referred to the area past the Kapela mountain ranges. (Sorry for being pedantic.))\n\nThe Lackfis held titles all over the kingdom, (Count of Székelys, Voivode of Transylvania, Ban of Macho, Slavonia, Croatia, Ispán of Bereg, Zemplén, Vas, etc.) A few of them holding the title of Ban of Croatia doesn't necessary mean they had huge estates in the region (they might have had a few though, idk). Around this time, there were still significant amount of lands directly in royal and ban possession in the banates of the country, so it wasn't yet necessary for the appointed ban to already have lots of possessions in the region to be able to effectively govern it.\n\nCampaign against Bosnia is likely\n\nTvrtko was rather ambitious, but he remained loyal to Louis until his death. After being humbled, would Tvrtko become and stay loyal to King Charles too? Or could he be expected to remain unruly until his death? If so, how viable is his eventual forced removal?\n\nbetween Zadar and Senj, I think Charles would choose Senj as main royal residence after chasing out Sigismund for good.\n\nSenj/Zengg as the seat of royal power certainly sounds fascinating. Could the town take advantage of its new position and develop into a rivalling the Dalmatian cities?\n\nLadislaus and Mary's children would be probably Ladislaus Jr, Charles Jr, Louis, Mary Jr, Elizabeth, Stephen, Margaret, Robert, maybe some Croatian name to appease Croatians.\n\nThanks.\n\nEdit: Messed up some county names, fixed it.\n\nIn that case, what would be the fate of Lithuania?

What do you think?\n\nIOTL Lithuanians also swore fealty to Hedwig and Frederick of Hohenzollern, so assuming any Polish overlord isn't distracted by trying to take Hungarian throne, Svitrigaila could retain power, but if he was more willing to negotiate with Poles, he could retain power as vassal, losing all of Volhynia, Podolia and probably Kiev (trying to hold it without Volhynia and Podolia would be logistical nightmare, also Kievan nobles in 1420s-1430s already vouched for being incorporated to Poland), so more or less borders of OTL Poland post Union of Lublin with the difference that GDL would become a vassal (a lot depends on whether Ladislaus attacks Poland a'la Sigismund IOTL or not, because TTL's survival of Teutonic Order past 1410 depends on it).\n\nThe Lackfis held titles all over the kingdom, (Count of Székelys, Voivode of Transylvania, Ban of Macho, Slavonia, Croatia, Ispán of Bereg, Zemplén, Vas, etc.) A few of them holding the title of Ban of Croatia doesn't necessary mean they had huge estates in the region (they might have had a few though, idk). Around this time, there were still significant amount of lands directly in royal and ban possession in the banates of the country, so it wasn't yet necessary for the appointed ban to already have lots of possessions in the region to be able to effectively govern it.\n\nOk, fair point regarding Lackfis.\n\nAfter a quick look, I couldn't find anything about the Lackfis having strong connections to Croatia.

Furthermore, Medimurje was adjacent to Slavonia, not Croatia, since Croatia at the time only referred to the area past the Kapela mountain ranges. (Sorry for being pedantic.))\n\nWhat I meant was that Medimurje lies in what now belongs to Croatia, I inorrectly assumed it translated to being part of medieval Kingdom of Croatia.\n\nSenj/Zengg as the seat of royal power certainly sounds fascinating. Could the town take advantage of its new position and develop into a rivalling the Dalmatian cities?\n\nWell, lots of cities developed because king X and Y made it a seat of their royal power (for example Warsaw if not requirement to convene Sejm there and later Sigismund III's decision to make it capital would stay small town), so why not Senj?\n\nTvrtko was rather ambitious, but he remained loyal to Louis until his death. After being humbled, would Tvrtko become and stay loyal to King Charles too? Or could he be expected to remain unruly until his death? If so, how viable is his eventual forced removal?\n\nI think Tvrtko would not rebel against Charles as long as it seems he is winning and as long Tvrtko doesn't have strong allies against him.\n\nIOTL Lithuanians also swore fealty to Hedwig and Frederick of Hohenzollern\n\nSo that means the pro-Polish faction (led by Sigismund) could still come out on top IOTL too, I suppose.\n\nSvitrigaila could retain power, but if he was more willing to negotiate with Poles, he could retain power as vassal, losing all of Volhynia, Podolia and probably Kiev\n\nWasn't Švitrigaila's rule completely contrary to Polish wishes though? He became Grand Duke without Polish approval, after all. AFAIK he was popular in Kiev however, so maybe he could retain his position as Prince of Kiev (in a vassal capacity, maybe subordinated directly to Poland instead of Lithuania).\n\n(a lot depends on whether Ladislaus attacks Poland a'la Sigismund IOTL or not, because TTL's survival of Teutonic Order past 1410 depends on it).\n\nIf his son and Hedwig are set to inherit Poland, then Ladislaus would hardly have a reason to attack Poland or to aid the Order in any capacity, IMO. I'm uncertain wether the TO would lose more ITTL compared to OTL though. Samogitia might be permanently relinquished by the Order, but that's it (especially considering that Sigismund and/or Wenceslaus might still intervene).\n\nI think Tvrtko would not rebel against Charles as long as it seems he is winning and as long Tvrtko doesn't have strong allies against him.\n\nThat could potentially mean Bosnian AND Hungaro-Neapolitan participation in the Battle of Kosovo. What could be the consequences of a victory there?\n\nAlso, what about the Hussite Wars? Could Sigismund deal with the rebels?\n\nSo that means the pro-Polish faction (led by Sigismund) could still come out on top IOTL too, I suppose.\n\nWasn't Švitrigaila's rule completely contrary to Polish wishes though?

Could Sigismund deal with the rebels?\n\nSvitrigaila was offered like two times to become Grand Duke as Polish vassal in exchange for Poland legitmizing his rule, he refused. Well, if the part of Polish forces which was sent to protect the border with Hungary IOTL and fought at Bardiow was with main forces, Heinrich von Plauen, man who singlehandedly saved Marienburg from Poles could remain captured (IOTL he was, but was freed in some little skirmish) and without him, Marienburg wouldn't be even able to put up a fight and probably Prussian cities will continue to surrender like they did before Marienburg held on. Sigismund would probably buy back Brandenburg so it's hard to say Hussite Wars would even happen, he might not be King of Romans at the time of Council of Constance. As far as victory at Kosovo is concerned, Serbian state led by Hrebejanović would probably survive, but I doubt Charles will show up to that battle, Sigismund would probably still distract his attention at the time of that battle.\n\nSvitrigaila was offered like two times to become Grand Duke as Polish vassal in exchange for Poland legitmizing his rule, he refused.\n\nI see, then that's something to consider.\n\nWell, if the part of Polish forces which was sent to protect the border with Hungary IOTL and fought at Bardiow was with main forces, Heinrich von Plauen, man who singlehandedly saved Marienburg from Poles could remain captured (IOTL he was, but was freed in some little skirmish) and without him, Marienburg wouldn't be even able to put up a fight and probably Prussian cities will continue to surrender like they did before Marienburg held on.\n\nNow that's something I had no idea about.

IOTL he had Hungary, but ITTL he would make himself landless.\n\nit's hard to say Hussite Wars would even happen, he might not be King of Romans at the time of Council of Constance.\n\nWho else could be though? As rightful Elector of Brandenburg (and without his OTL Hungarian entanglement), I think he would even stand a better chance at being elected in 1410 than IOTL. Sure, Jobst could still get elected regardless of him not possessing Brandenburg, but then him suddenly dying like IOTL cannot be ruled out either.\n\nOn another note, there's no garantuee the result would have been any different even if someone else was King of the Romans at the time.\n\nAs far as victory at Kosovo is concerned, Serbian state led by Hrebejanović would probably survive, but I doubt Charles will show up to that battle, Sigismund would probably still distract his attention at the time of that battle.\n\nOf course, I didn't think Charles himself would participate. Rather, he would just send a force of a few thousands led by some notable (like a Ban or the Voivode of Transylvania). Forces from Naples might not even participate.\n\nAs for Serbia, Prince Lazar supposedly aknowledged Tvrtko as King of the Serbs, although he did style himself in a manner (autocrator, Stefan) that suggested he didn't wish to actually subordinate himself to him. After Tvrtko's death, I wouldn't be surprised if Lazar tried to officially assume the royal title.\n\nNow that's something I had no idea about.

IOTL he had Hungary, but ITTL he would make himself landless.\n\nFair point, I thought he pawned Brandeburg prior to Charles of Durazzo's death, but he did it in 1388, so probably Sigismund would stay elector of Brandenburg.\n\nWho else could be though?

After Tvrtko's death, I wouldn't be surprised if Lazar tried to officially assume the royal title.\n\nWell, Lazar would still face significant opposition from Serbian nobility, rather unwilling to raise one of them to royal dignity and Tvrtko is still nominally Catholic at least and that's an obstacle to his reign in Serbia.\n\nAndrzej Nadolski, \"Grunwald 1410\".\n\nCouldn't find free online version, but I found this:\n\nIf this is what you were talking about, then I think this is way too early in the war to be influenced by any kind of troop redeployment. (Of course, it could be reasoned, that our 1380s POD probably already introduced enough changes to butterfly the whole affair. Going by that logic would make it impossible to speculate further though...)\n\nLouis III Wittelsbach was candidate to kingship, so he might be elected to the post of King of the Romans, not any Luxembourg.\n\nDidn't he IOTL refuse to \"run\" for the kingship? He fully endorsed Sigismund, who in exchange appointed him Vicar of the Empire. On a related note, wasn't Louis personally responsible for the burning of Jan Hus, meaning the Hussite rebellion would break out anyway?\n\nWell, Lazar would still face significant opposition from Serbian nobility, rather unwilling to raise one of them to royal dignity and Tvrtko is still nominally Catholic at least and that's an obstacle to his reign in Serbia.\n\nAs Tvrtko couldn't, Lazar wouldn't be able to project his authority too much beyond his own domains' borders either. However, he might still be able to squeeze out nominal recognition from atleast a few Serbian lords, especially those most threatened by the Ottomans. The prestige gained from winning battles against the Turks and his strong influence over the Serbian Church would surely come in handy for that.\n\nIf this is what you were talking about, then I think this is way too early in the war to be influenced by any kind of troop redeployment.

Going by that logic would make it impossible to speculate further though...)\n\nI don't really know (yes, this is what I was talking about), if there are more troops to begin with, that castle might be held by Poles and so would Plauen which would butterfly him helping. On that site, there were certainly TLs with totally unconnected changes justified by butterfly effect.\n\nDidn't he IOTL refuse to \"run\" for the kingship? He fully endorsed Sigismund, who in exchange appointed him Vicar of the Empire. On a related note, wasn't Louis personally responsible for the burning of Jan Hus, meaning the Hussite rebellion would break out anyway?\n\nIOTL he did, but if Luxembourgs are weaker he might be not incensed to do so. If it's Louis, not Sigismund who is responsible for burning Hus, why Bohemians would rebel? Louis isn't king of Bohemia nor he does have chances to become king of Bohemia, if Sigismund isn't allied to him, he should be accepted as Vaclav's succesor.\n\nAs Tvrtko couldn't, Lazar wouldn't be able to project his authority too much beyond his own domains' borders either. However, he might still be able to squeeze out nominal recognition from atleast a few Serbian lords, especially those most threatened by the Ottomans. The prestige gained from winning battles against the Turks and his strong influence over the Serbian Church would surely come in handy for that.\n\nWell, Lazar is at least Orthodox, while Tvrtko is Catholic, Tvrtko despite what he claimed would have even more hard time to enforce his rule than Lazar (slightly unrelated, but I'd seriously read Tvrtko-wank when he really gains rule over Serbia and creates medieval Yugoslavia).\n\nIf it's Louis, not Sigismund who is responsible for burning Hus, why Bohemians would rebel? Louis isn't king of Bohemia nor he does have chances to become king of Bohemia, if Sigismund isn't allied to him, he should be accepted as Vaclav's succesor.\n\nDidn't the rebellion already begin under Wenceslaus though? Also, we need to consider Sigismund's personal stance on Hussitism. Even if he personally could not be linked to Hus' burning, if he ascends the throne and begins to suppress the Hussite movement, then we would still have a war on our hand.\n\nWell, Lazar is at least Orthodox, while Tvrtko is Catholic, Tvrtko despite what he claimed would have even more hard time to enforce his rule than Lazar\n\nThe question is, what would be the fate of Tvrtko's Serbian possessions (Podrinje, Trebinje, Hum) after his death? would Lazar try to conquer them to eliminate Dabiša (Tvrtko's successor) as rival claimant to the Serb crown? Which side could hope to receive Charles' support in such conflict? Dabiša as a Catholic would probably be at advantage, but I'm not sure.\n\n(slightly unrelated, but I'd seriously read Tvrtko-wank when he really gains rule over Serbia and creates medieval Yugoslavia).\n\nHad he lived a decade or so longer, he might have been able to enforce his rule, but his conflict with Sigismund and his adherence to Catholicism would always have been huge obstacles.\n\nAlso, about Sigismund, who would he marry (once he's forced to give up on Mary)?"
