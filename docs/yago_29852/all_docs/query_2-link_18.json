        "text": "Saint Adelaide\n\n(Written by Blessed Is She) : Not only was Saint Adelaide a princess, but she is also now the patron Saint of princesses! Her life was filled with the drama of royal politics. She was married to the king of Italy at 15. Three years later, the king was poisoned by his successor, who then insisted that Adelaide marry his son. She refused and fled but was caught and thrown in prison. About four months later, she escaped to Northern Italy and implored Otto of Germany for help. He, in turn, conquered Italy and then asked for her hand in marriage.\n\nOtto and Adelaide reined for 20 years before he passed away. Within a few years, her daughter-in-law tried to turn her son, the new king, against Adelaide, and she was driven from court. Back in her home country of Burgundy, where she went to live with her brother, she dedicated herself to founding and restoring religious houses and evangelizing to the Slavic people.\n\nShe ultimately reconciled with her son, and after his death, she returned to Italy as regent until her grandson came of age.\n\nThroughout her fascinating life, Adelaide remained close to God. Even though she was the most powerful woman in the world as Empress of the Roman Empire, she remained humble and dedicated to the service of Christ."
