Her first teacher was her father, Claude De La Guerre. As a teenager her education was taught by Madame Francoise De Montespan in the King’s Palace. Elizabeth played the Harpsichordist, the violin, and organ. Elizabeth was also a singer. Her parents and two Uncles were very musical too.\n\nShe lived in her half-brother Edward's household. However, she still lived much like the daughter of a king. She had people who took good care of her and tutors who helped her with her studies. She was very bright and learned to read and write in many different languages. She also learned how to sew and play a piano-like musical instrument called the virginal. (Biography queen elizabeth 1)\n\nSaint Elizabeth Ann Seton roll in the Catholic Church was a sister. She became a sister after her husband died. When she was a sister she created Sisters of Charity. Sisters of Charity is for girls to help serve the poor. She created the Sisters of Charity in 1858 in Maryland. She also created an all girls Catholic school. She created the first American Catholic school, St. Joseph Academy. ¨Afterward a group of buildings, embracing a residence for the Sisters, a novitiate, a boarding-school for young girls, a school for poor children, and an orphan asylum, was erected (http://www.elizabethannseton.org ).¨ She created many things that helped people. Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton did not have any miracles. Although she did many great things, Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton was the patron saint of dead children and parents, people who work on the ocean, and widows. Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton was crucial in the Catholic Church because of her decision to go into the church and what she contributed and how she helped the poor and how she relates to life\n\nElizabeth’s legitimacy was questioned heavily and many uprisings were attempted against her, but Elizabeth was extremely resilient and worked tremendously hard to rectify the problems of her country. She was a moderate protestant, so she was able to work to bring about an end to the religious tensions of England in a way there her sister never could. Just as Mary had been pressured to marry and have children to continue the line of succession, Elizabeth was pressed to as well; however, Elizabeth did not share their same concerns. Having seen the disasters that marriage had wrought on her family, Elizabeth took a different stance and vowed never to marry, nor have any children. Turmoil after turmoil plagued the country, such as when the Spanish armada attempted to invade or when the countryside was threatened with starvation, but Elizabeth took these challenges in stride and came out on top every single time. She was extremely skilled in law legislation and passed many laws that benefitted the people, raising England up and establishing it as a country of strength equitable to world powers at the time. She gave England the stone to stand on, and even though her government begged her to marry and bear children, she never gave in and when she finally died, so did the Tudor\n\nSt. Margaret was canonized a saint in 1250 by Pope Innocent IV in recognition of her “personal holiness, fidelity to the Church, work for religious reform, and charity.” On June 19th, 1250, her remains were taken to a chapel in Dunfermline Abbey where she was buried before the high altar. Today, we celebrate her feast day on November 16th (the day of her death.) She is patron of Scotland and known as “The Pearl of Scotland.” There are hundreds of schools named after St. Margaret that remember her reformation of the church and help to the poor.\n\nSt. Elizabeth was known for helping the poor and sick and started Catholic schools and orphanages. After 16 years of being a Catholic, she died of tuberculosis on January 4, 1821. She was canonized on September 14, 1975; she was also the first native-born American to be canonized. St. Elizabeth Ann Seton is the patron saint of in laws, abortions, widows, the death of parents, and opposition of the church authority. This is the wonderful life of Saint Elizabeth Ann\n\nMy saint is saint cecilia of Rome. Saint cecilia is the patroness of musicians. At her wedding musicians were there playing while she was there singing her heart to the lord. Her feast day is celebrated in the Latin Catholic church, Eastern Catholic church, Anglican church, and Eastern Orthodox churches on November 22. Saint Cecilia's full name is Saint Cecilia of Rome. In the fourth century a Greek romance on the Loves of Cecilia and Valerian was written in glory of virginal life with the purpose of taking the place of back then romances. Until better evidence is produced, we did not know about saint Cecilia until about the time when Pope Gelasius introduced her name into his Sacramentary. They said there was a church dedicated to St. Cecilia\n\nElizabeth had inspired many people, even her own sister Emily Blackwell, she even became the third woman to do so. Elizabeth's presence in her school made many people study even more around her especially the men. Even though Elizabeth was a very successful doctor she also wanted to become a surgeon, but never did because of an accident while treating a baby's eyes she accidentally sprayed medicine into her left eye and making her blind, there for not being able to becoming a\n\nThroughout history people have made a name for themselves by their actions. From Napoleon to Amelia Earhart, individuals have been recognized through their accomplishments. The faithful Joan of Arc has done the same. Joan broke through the boundaries for women of her time and, consequently, is one of the most famous young women in history. This statement is profoundly accurate because she was such a young girl with an extremely powerful devotion to God. But just how did Joan’s intense dedication to God influence her brief life?\n\nQueen Elizabeth was born in 1533 in Greenwich. Her parents, Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, were not satisfied with her birth because they could not have male heirs. Since Henry suspected his wife for committing adulteries and blamed her for not giving him a boy, he decapitated her. Although Elizabeth did not grow up with the background of a loving family, she never stopped studying, but endeavored to develop her disposition to become a monarch.
