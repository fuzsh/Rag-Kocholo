He was a member of the Texas Outlaw Comics with Bill Hicks.\n\nBefore Fame\n\nPrior to becoming a comedian, he wished to follow his father's footsteps in becoming a preacher. He preached from the age of 17 to 24 in Tulsa, Oklahoma before beginning his comedy career in Houston, Texas.\n\nTrivia\n\nHe recorded a novelty version of The Troggs' \"Wild Thing,\" which appeared on his album Have You Seen Me Lately? and the video, a hit on MTV, featured cameos from Rodney Dangerfield, Steven Tyler, Billy Idol, and Tommy Lee, as well as a raunchy 'roll on the mat' dance with Jessica Hahn.\n\nFamily Life\n\nHe was married and divorced twice before marrying Malika Kinison in 1992, six days before he died. She later sued his brother Bill for defaming her in his book Brother Sam: The Short Spectacular Life of Sam Kinison.\n\nAssociated With"
