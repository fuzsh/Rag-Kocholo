        "text": "What Up Yo.\n\nSam Kinison.\n\nThe genesis of this article, this post, is pretty simple.\n\nI got pissed off yesterday.\n\nI wanted to scream.\n\nSo I did.\n\nThen I thought of Sam Kinison.\n\nA smile came across my face immediately and I thought to myself:\n\n“I need to put Sam Kinison on Voices ASAP.”\n\nI enjoy watching people yell and scream.\n\nWatching people flip the fuck out.\n\nJust do.\n\nI identify with it.\n\nEspecially if it’s a performer.\n\nActor. Comedian.\n\nFarley,\n\nDaniel-Day Lewis.\n\nDeNiro.\n\n“Serrano’s Got The Discs!!! Serrano’s Got The Discs!!!!!”\n\nDon’t matter to me. I love it. I eat it up.\n\nBut Sam Kinison…\n\nHow many comedians are as instantly recognizable…from their screams?\n\nI used to be able to imitate it pretty well.\n\nThe first part is like a stutter.\n\n“OW!!”\n\nReal quick. As soon as it starts it ends,\n\nBut it’s just the sound of the levee breaking from the pressure building behind it.\n\nThe second part, is the flood.\n\n“AAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\n\nIt sounded so damn good.\n\nHe was like this 1980’s Rock Star/Comedian/televangelist preacher hybrid mutant.\n\nThere was this unabashed honesty in his performance.\n\nOffensive, no one was spared, on point.\n\nHe spoke from his heart and he made no apologies.\n\nHe had a strong foundation of faith in his life, a deep relationship with God.\n\nAnd when he got onstage he told it like it was.\n\nThat’s refreshing for a lot of us.\n\nWhen someone stands there and has the balls to strip the bullshit away from the world and to say the shit we were taught never to say.\n\nKinison would say the shit we’ve been taught not to think.\n\nAnd he wouldn’t just say it, he would rage.\n\nHe would go on a tear and he would get fucking angry.\n\nThat was why we would double over with laughter.\n\nI’m no headshrinker, but there’s something comforting in watching a man step up, pick apart the mundane, and rage at convention every once in a while.\n\nPeople started to pay a lot of money to see Kinison get pissed off.\n\n“Dying is easy. Comedy is hard.”\n\nI think the best comedians get you to laugh at either the subjects you’re not supposed to laugh at, or the common issues we all face daily and aren’t able to confront.\n\nThat’s not an easy thing to do. Morally or intelligently.\n\nHow to know what lines to cross and which not to.\n\nThat was the intelligence and bravery of Sam Kinison, the genius in his comedy and the reason he is still revered.\n\nYou don’t walk that fine line of comedy and truth by accident.\n\nKinison earned his perspective, he didn’t mimic other comedians, he stood on stage and told you what was on his mind.\n\nRight or wrong.\n\n“In another time and place he would have been called prophet.”\n\nA few videos of Sam’s brilliant and unforgettable rage below.\n\nR.I.P. Sam Kinison."
