But according to Wikipedia, he went to L.A. to work at a comedy club called The Comedy Store. Wonder if this event helped precipitate his moving out of Houston and toward California. Certainly so if he was permanently banned, but it was only for two weeks...makes me wonder if he did something else that got him banned permanently.\n\nI used to be a fan of Kinison back in the '80's. I have never heard of this before. Couldn't find any pics or much about it at all on the web."
