If all I have to do is go make people laugh, that's nothing. Let me tell you what a tough crowd is. A tough crowd is going to a morning service and you got six people there and you gotta pay your house payment. That's a tough crowd.\n\nEvery generation has someone who steps outside the norm and offers a voice for the unspeakable attitudes of that time. I represent everything that's supposed to be wrong, everything that's forbidden.\"\n\nMr.L: I Am Sam Kinison\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN_KFjNcqJI\n\nFYI LTC Orlando Illi CPT Jack Durish CMSgt (Join to see) MSG Andrew White Sgt Albert Castro SSgt Boyd Herrst] SSG Ray Adkins SGT Charles H.
