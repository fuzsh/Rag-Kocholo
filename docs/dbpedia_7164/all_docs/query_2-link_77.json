        "text": "UPSC NCERT Notes – Modern History – The advent of Europeans in India\n\nThe advent of Europeans in India marks a pivotal chapter in the annals of history, heralding a profound transformation that would shape the destiny of the subcontinent. Through the lens of colonial expansion, the narrative of India’s past unfolds with a tapestry woven by the encounters between indigenous civilizations and the enterprising voyagers from distant shores. From the early ventures of Portuguese traders to the establishment of vast colonial empires by the British, French, Dutch, and others, the landscape of India was irrevocably altered. This period witnessed not only economic exchanges but also cultural amalgamation, political upheavals, and societal restructuring. The dynamics of power and influence shifted, leaving an indelible imprint on the fabric of Indian society. Delving into the nuances of this epoch, one finds a saga of exploration, exploitation, resistance, and resilience, echoing through the corridors of time, shaping the contours of modern India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nThe arrival of Europeans in India\n\nThe traditional trade routes between the East and the West fell under Turkish dominance following the Ottoman conquest of Asia Minor and the capture of Constantinople in AD 1453.\n\nMerchants from Venice and Genoa, who had monopolized these routes, denied West European states, including Spain and Portugal, any participation in trade through the old routes.\n\nSeeking to break the Arab and Venetian trade monopolies and circumvent Turkish hostilities, West European states and merchants began searching for new and safer sea routes to India and Indonesia.\n\nThe advancements in ship-building and navigation science in the 15th century enabled these states to discover sea routes.\n\nPortugal and Spain took the initial steps, with their seamen, sponsored and controlled by the governments, initiating a significant era of geographical exploration.\n\nTimeline of Europeans in India\n\nThe Portuguese\n\nEncouraged by Prince Henry of Portugal, Bartholomeu Dias, the first Portuguese sailor, reached the Cape of Good Hope in AD 1498 in search of sea routes to India.\n\nVasco da Gama\n\nHailing from Lisbon, Vasco da Gama, a colonial explorer, discovered a new sea route from Europe to Asia via the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nHe received assistance from the Gujarati navigator Ibn Majid and landed at Calicut on May 21, 1498. Calicut, then under the Zamorin, was prosperous.\n\nVasco da Gama returned to Portugal in AD 1499 and revisited India in AD 1501.\n\nPedro Alvares Cabral\n\nIn AD 1500, Pedro Alvares Cabral led the second European expedition to reach India via the sea route around the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nHe strengthened the factories at Cochin and Cannanore, leaving a squadron to supervise the Malabar coast and thwart any Arab vessels arriving from the Red Sea.\n\nThe Portuguese maritime empire came to be known as Estado da India, aiming to monopolize the spice and pepper trade in the East.\n\nTreaty of Tordesillas\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas signed in AD 1494 between Spain and Portugal, aimed to divide the world between them along an imaginary line down the center of the Atlantic Ocean. This agreement served as an amendment to the papal bulls issued by Pope Alexander VI in AD 1493.\n\nImportant Portuguese Governors\n\nHere are some significant Portuguese Governors and events during their rule:\n\nFrancisco de Almeida (AD 1505-1509)\n\nFrancisco de Almeida, the first Governor of Portuguese territory, fortified Fort Manuel in Cochin and erected a fort at Anjediva.\n\nBlue Water Policy\n\nThe Blue Water Policy, introduced by Governor Francisco de Almeida, emphasized maintaining Portuguese dominance as the sole trade power in the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.\n\nThis policy advocated for Portuguese naval strength rather than building fortifications on the Indian mainland.\n\nAlmeida led a systematic assault on the Muslim (mainly Arab) monopoly of trade in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea.\n\nIn a naval battle near Chaul, the combined Muslim fleet achieved victory over the Portuguese fleet under Almeida’s son, who lost his life in the battle (January 1508).\n\nA year later, Almeida successfully defeated the combined Muslim fleet in a naval battle near Diu (February 1509).\n\nAlfonso de Albuquerque (AD 1509-1515)\n\nAlbuquerque’s first major achievement was the conquest of Goa from the Adil Shahi Sultan of Bijapur in February AD 1510. Although the city was quickly recaptured by the Sultan of Bijapur, Albuquerque undertook a second expedition.\n\nHe captured Bhatkal from Sri Krishna Deva Raya (1510) of Vijayanagara and initiated a policy of intermarriage with the natives of India. Albuquerque also banned the practice of sati in his area of influence.\n\nAlbuquerque’s successors went on to establish Portuguese settlements on the West coast at Daman, Salsette, and Bombay, while also extending their presence on the East coast with settlements at Santhome (near Madras) and Hooghly (Bengal).\n\nCartaz System The Cartaz System, a naval trade license or pass, was implemented by the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean during the 16th century under the dominion of the Portuguese Empire.\n\nBattle of Goa (1510)\n\nIn the Battle of Goa (1510), Alfonso de Albuquerque, with the assistance of Hindu chieftain Timoji, successfully captured Goa. Although the Portuguese initially faced defeat, the reinforcement led by Albuquerque turned the tide, resulting in the defeat of Adil Shahi’s forces and the occupation of the city by Timoji.\n\nRecognizing the strategic significance of Goa, Portuguese Viceroy Alfonso de Albuquerque saw it as an ideal permanent base for Portugal’s navy and commerce in the Indian Ocean.\n\nNino da Cunha (AD 1529-1538)\n\nNino da Cunha continued the expansion of Portuguese influence by establishing settlements at Santhome near Madras and at Hooghly in Bengal, thus fostering commerce on the Eastern coast.\n\nIn AD 1534, the Portuguese obtained permission from the Sultan of Bengal to build factories at Satgaon and Chittagong.\n\nCochin served as the early capital of the Portuguese in India, later transferred to Goa by Nino da Cunha.\n\nIn AD 1535, Cunha acquired Diu and Bassein from Bahadur Shah of Gujarat.\n\nOver time, most of their territories were lost to the Marathas (Salsette and Bassein in AD 1739), Dutch, and English. Only Goa, Diu, and Daman remained under Portuguese control until AD 1961.\n\nBy AD 1571, the Asiatic Empire had divided into three distinct commands:\n\nA Governorship overseeing settlements on the African coast, with Mozambique under its control.\n\nA Viceroyalty located at Goa, responsible for the territories of India and Persia.\n\nA Governorship situated at Malacca, tasked with regulating the trade of Java and the spice archipelago.\n\nOther Notable Governors:\n\nAfonso de Souza: During his Governorship (1542-45), the first Jesuit priest, Francisco Xavier, arrived in India.\n\nMonserrate and Acquaviva: In response to Akbar’s request in September 1579, Jesuit fathers Rodolfo Aquaviva and Antonio Monserrate reached Fatehpur Sikri on 28th February 1580.\n\nThey made a second visit in AD 15 with Fathers Jerome Xavier and Emmanuel Pinhei. In AD 1595, the third Portuguese mission requested by Akbar arrived at Lahore. Their letters from the court served as a valuable source for the later part of Akbar’s reign.\n\nContributions of the Portuguese in India:\n\nThe Portuguese had a significant social, economic, and cultural influence in India, particularly along the Western coasts.\n\nThey enriched Indian vocabulary and made advancements in medicine. Garda da Orta, a Portuguese scholar, wrote the first treatise on the medical plants of India. The first scientific work on Indian medicinal plants by a European writer was printed at Goa in AD 1563.\n\nThey opened up the global market for Indian goods like spices and muslin.\n\nThe Portuguese played a vital role in expanding trade with coastal Indian regions, contributing to unprecedented growth.\n\nAssisted by the Portuguese, India witnessed the influx of various imported goods from European countries and China.\n\nThe Portuguese are also acknowledged for introducing tobacco cultivation in India.\n\nAdditional contributions of the Portuguese include:\n\nNaval Contribution: The arrival of the Portuguese not only marked the onset of the European age but also the rise of maritime power. Equipping their ships with cannons, the Portuguese took the initial steps to establish a commerce monopoly by employing threats or force.\n\nMilitary Contribution: On land, the Portuguese made a significant military contribution by implementing a system of drilling infantry groups, modeled after the Spanish approach. This system was introduced in the 1630s in response to pressure from the Dutch.\n\nMaritime Technologies: The Portuguese were adept in advanced maritime tactics. Their robust multi-decked ships were designed to withstand Atlantic gales rather than sail ahead of the regular monsoons, enabling them to carry more weapons.\n\nArchitectural Contribution: The Portuguese had a profound influence on Indian architecture, particularly in ecclesiastical architecture, known as Gothic architecture in Western and South India.\n\nThey also propagated the style of Manueline architecture, also referred to as Late Gothic, along the Western coast.\n\nTimeline of Portuguese India\n\nDecline of Portuguese Rule\n\nSome of the major factors for the decline of Portuguese rule in India were as follows:\n\nWeak Successors\n\nThe successors of Albuquerque were weak and could not maintain their prosperity, unlike their previous ones.\n\nThey were unable to increase Portuguese control over India and on the other hand, the rise of powerful regional powers like Marathas and Nizams Doc created huge trouble for them.\n\nAggressive Religious Policies\n\nThe Portuguese’s religious policies were a crucial factor and negative element in their defeat in India.\n\nEngaging in forced conversions to Christianity and participating in human trafficking for trade in the Western world were common practices among the Portuguese.\n\nThe Portuguese not only engaged in such activities but also destroyed and desecrated Hindu shrines in India.\n\nFall of the Vijayanagara Empire\n\nAfter the Battle of Talikota in AD 1565 led to the downfall of the Vijayanagara Kingdom, the influence of the Portuguese in India waned alongside the demise of the powerful state.\n\nVijayanagara had served as a pivotal trade center for European goods and articles.\n\nThe Impact of the West\n\nFollowing the discovery of Brazil, Portugal shifted its colonization focus more towards the West.\n\nOvercoming Portuguese opposition, these new entrants successfully captured Portuguese possessions in India.\n\nCorrupted Trade Policy and Moral Degeneration\n\nThe Portuguese sought to establish trade monopoly by any means necessary.\n\nThe abuse of naval power led to the robbery of other ships on the beach, harassment of civilians, and attacks on other ships at sea. Consequently, other merchants ceased to trade with Portugal.\n\nExpansion of the Mughal Empire in the South\n\nThe expansion of the Mughal Empire in the South weakened the position of the Portuguese. Punished by Shah Jahan, they lost control of Hooghly in West Bengal.\n\nConcurrently, the ascendancy of Maratha power impeded Portuguese expansion along the West coast.\n\nThe Dutch\n\nThe Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC), popularly known as the Dutch United East India Company, was established in AD 1602.\n\nThey successfully overcame Portuguese influence and gained control over spice cultivation centers.\n\nThey established trade posts in Gujarat, Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. The company’s effective administrative system and strong national support enabled it to monopolize the spice trade in Europe.\n\nDutch Settlements in India\n\nThe Dutch East India Company’s settlements and trading posts on the Indian subcontinent include:\n\nOn the Malabar Coast:\n\nTheir sole port on this side was Vengurla, located to the North of Goa. After a protracted power struggle, the Dutch were ultimately defeated by the English in the Battle of Bedara in AD 1759.\n\nOn the Coromandel Coast:\n\nFollowing an earlier unsuccessful attempt to initiate trade at Surat and on the Malabar coast, Admiral Van der Hagen established trade with the Coromandel coast, setting up a permanent factory at Masulipatnam in early 1605.\n\nAnother factory was soon founded at Devanampatnam (Tegnapatnam) or Fort St David. In AD 1610, after negotiations with the king of Chandragiri, the Dutch established another factory at Pulicat, named Fort Geldria.\n\nDutch East India Factories in India\n\nTrade During the Dutch Period\n\nExports: The primary export from the Coromandel coast during the Dutch period consisted of textiles, specifically woven clothes with distinctive patterns.\n\nAdditionally, the Dutch engaged in exporting Indigo and Saltpetre. Opium, a crucial export, found consumption in Java and China, yielding significant profits. The Dutch primarily traded spices, indigo, raw silk, rice, and opium, playing a pivotal role in making India a center for textile exports.\n\nPulicat served as their main center from AD 1616, but Nagapattinam later replaced it. The Dutch trading system operated on the Cartel system, and the company paid an impressive dividend of 18% to its shareholders, marking a record in the history of commerce.\n\nImports: In terms of imports, aside from spices, key items brought to the Coromandel included sandalwood and pepper from the Archipelago, copper from Japan, and textiles from China.\n\nTrade from Bengal: In Bengal, the Dutch initially established a factory at Pipli but soon abandoned it for Balasore.\n\nEventually, they secured a firm footing at Chinsurah on the Hooghly in AD 1653, leading to the construction of Fort Gustavus in AD 1742. Subsequently, they expanded their presence with factories at Cossimbazar and Patna.\n\nThe decline of the Dutch\n\nIn the Battle of Colachel (AD 1741), the forces of the Dutch East India Company suffered defeat at the hands of the King of Travancore, Marthanda Verma. Subsequently, they faced a decisive defeat in the Battle of Bedara (AD 1759), led by Robert Clive of the British.\n\nThe decline of the Dutch can be attributed to factors such as a deteriorating economic condition, excessive centralization, a focus on the spice trade, and a comparatively weaker navy than the British.\n\nAnglo-Dutch Rivalry\n\nDuring this period, the English began to emerge as significant players in Eastern trade, posing a serious threat to Dutch economic interests. The escalating commercial competition eventually led to hostilities.\n\nAfter prolonged conflicts, both parties reached an agreement in AD 1667. In this accord, the British committed to relinquish all claims to Indonesia, while the Dutch agreed to withdraw from India to concentrate on their more successful commerce in Indonesia.\n\nThe English\n\nBefore the establishment of the East India Company’s trade in India, English merchant John Mildenhall arrived in India via the land route for trade with Indian merchants in AD 1599.\n\nThe charter granted by Queen Elizabeth I on December 31, 1600, under the title of ‘The Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies,’ marked the formation of the East India Company.\n\nInitially focused on acquiring spices and pepper from the Eastern Archipelago, the company’s first two voyages (AD 1601-1606) were directed towards Aching (in Sumatra), Bantam (in Java), and the Malaccas.\n\nIt was only with the third voyage in AD 1608 that the English initiated the company’s trade with India, and Captain William Hawkins, with experience in such ventures and proficiency in Turkish, was provided with a letter from King James I to Akbar.\n\nTimeline of the English East India Company\n\nFounded on December 31, 1600, the East India Company aimed to establish trade relations with the East Indies.\n\nEstablished by a group of over 200 English merchants, Queen Elizabeth I, the reigning Queen of England, was a shareholder.\n\nIn AD 1608, the East India Company gained its initial foothold at Surat in Gujarat.\n\nIn November 1612, English Commander Captain Thomas Best sailed to India from the ship Dragon and a small ship Osiander. The Battle of Swally (1612) saw the successful defeat of a Portuguese ship, earning admiration from Mughal Emperor Jahangir.\n\nThe company established its first Indian factory in Surat in AD 1613 and a second factory in Masulipatnam, Andhra Pradesh, in AD 1616.\n\nIn AD 1615, King James I instructed Sir Thomas Roe to visit Mughal Emperor Jahangir to arrange a commercial treaty for residing and establishing factories in Surat and other areas.\n\nIn AD 1668, the English East India Company acquired Bombay from Charles II, then King of England, becoming the headquarters on the West coast of India.\n\nTrading posts were established in Surat (AD 1613), Madras (AD 1639), Bombay (AD 1668), and Calcutta (AD 1690).\n\nIn AD 1717, Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar completely waived customs duties for the English in Bengal. By then, the company’s mainstay businesses included cotton, silk, indigo dye, saltpeter, and tea.\n\nEnglish Settlements on the Western Coast\n\nIn AD 1609, William arrived at Jahangir’s court but failed to secure permission to erect a factory at Surat. However, the English, under Captain Best, achieved victory over the Portuguese fleet at Swally (near Surat) in AD 1612, breaking the tradition of Portuguese supremacy. Consequently, Jahangir issued a Farman permitting the English to establish a factory at Surat in AD 1613.\n\nSir Thomas Roe, the royal ambassador from James I to the Mughal emperor, succeeded in obtaining two farms by 1618—one from Mughal Emperor Jahangir and the other from Prince Khurram—granting permission to trade and erect factories in different parts of the empire.\n\nSurat emerged as a significant center of maritime trade. The English extended their inland trading operations from Surat and, by AD 1616, had established subordinate factories at Ahmedabad, Baroda, Broach, and Agra. Finally, Bombay was declared the headquarters of the company on the West coast in AD 1687.\n\nGerald Aungier\n\nGerald Aungier, the first Governor of Bombay (AD 1669 to 1677), played a crucial role. Under Aungier’s leadership, Bombay became a haven for all merchants and manufacturers. He established vigorous and strict discipline overall inhabitants of the city, allowing every community to enjoy the free exercise of its religion.\n\nEnglish Settlements on the Eastern Coast\n\nThe English were granted permission to trade in Masulipatnam in AD 1611 and, in AD 1630, secured the Golden Farman from the Sultan of Golconda (AD 1632), ensuring the safety and prosperity of their trade.\n\nIn AD 1639, Francis Day obtained the site of Madras from the Raja of Chandragiri, with permission to build a fortified factory named Fort Saint George. The foundation of Madras in AD 1639 marked the English arrival at Hooghly in AD 1650, establishing a factory.\n\nThe English foothold on the Eastern coast grew both strong and permanent. Madras quickly replaced Masulipatnam as the headquarters of the English East India Company, encompassing the Coromandel settlements along the coast.\n\nBy AD 1641, all territories in Eastern India (Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa) and the Coromandel region were placed under the control of the President and Council of Fort Saint George.\n\nEnglish Settlements in Bengal\n\nIn AD 1633, the Mughal Governor of Orissa granted the English merchants factories at Hariharapur (near the mouth of Mahanadi), Balasore, and Pipli. The English also succeeded in establishing a factory at Hooghly in AD 1651, followed by ones at Patna, Dacca, and Cossimbazar.\n\nIn AD 1667, Aurangzeb issued a farman granting the English East India Company permission to trade in Bengal. Five years later, in AD 1672, the Mughal Governor, Shaista Khan, confirmed all the privileges acquired by the English East India Company.\n\nThe rebellion led by Sobha Singh, a Zamindar in the district of Burdwan, provided an opportunity for the English to fortify their settlement at Sutanuti in AD 1696. Azim-ush-Shah, the Governor of Bengal, permitted the English to purchase the Zamindari of the three villages of Sutanuti, Kalikata, and Govindpur, paying 1200 to the old proprietors.\n\nIn AD 1700, the directors designated Bengal as a separate Presidency independent of Madras and appointed Sir Charles Eyre as its first President and Governor of Fort William in Bengal. Following Aurangzeb’s death in AD 1707, the English received confirmation of their privileges from the new Emperor Shah Alam and the de facto ruler of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan.\n\nA significant event during this period was the diplomatic mission led by John Surman in AD 1715 to the court of the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar.\n\nThe Mughal Emperor issued farms to the company outlining the following privileges:\n\nBengal: The company’s imports and exports in Bengal were exempted from additional customs duties, except an annual payment of 3000, as previously settled. The company was also granted permission to lease additional lands around Calcutta.\n\nHyderabad: The company retained its old privileges in Hyderabad, enjoying freedom from trade dues and paying only the existing rent for Madras.\n\nSurat: The company at Surat was exempted from all duties on its exports and imports. In return, it made an annual payment of 10000. Furthermore, the coins minted at Bombay were given currency throughout the Mughal Empire.\n\nThe Danes:\n\nThe Danish East India Company arrived in India in AD 1616, establishing settlements at Tranquebar (Tamil Nadu) in AD 1620, Serampore (Bengal) in AD 1676, and Nicobar Island.\n\nSerampore served as their headquarters, but they were compelled to sell their settlements to the British in AD 1854.\n\nThe initiative for Danish involvement came from Marcelis de Boshouwer, a Dutch explorer, who sought military assistance against the Portuguese in exchange for a trade monopoly. King Christian IV of Denmark-Norway granted the Danish East India Company a charter in 1616 AD, conferring a twelve-year monopoly on trade between Denmark and Asia.\n\nThe Serampore Mission Press was established by Danish missionaries in AD 1799. However, the Danes eventually sold all their Indian settlements to the British in AD 1845.\n\nThe French\n\nThe French East India Company, officially known as Compagnie des Indes Orientales, was established under state patronage by Colbert in AD 1664.\n\nIn July 1672, a French squadron under De la Haye occupied San Thome near Madras. The following year, in AD 1673, Francois Martin, the director of the Masulipatnam factory, obtained a site for another factory from Sher Khan Lodi, Governor of Valikondapuram. This factory later evolved into Pondicherry, with Francois Martin serving as its first Governor.\n\nIn Bengal, the French established the renowned settlement of Chandranagar in AD 1690, granted by Shaista Khan. Additionally, French factories were set up at Balasore, Mahe, Qarim Bazar, and Karaikal.\n\nA reconstituted company, named the United Compagnie des Indes, was formed by royal edict, consolidating control over the entire French colonial trade.\n\nTreaty of Ryswick\n\nThe Treaty of Ryswick, concluded in July 1697, marked the end of the Nine Years War, involving Louis XIV’s France against a grand coalition of England, the Dutch, and Spain. Louis XIV agreed to return most of his territorial acquisitions made since Nijmegen, retaining only the important fortress town of Strasbourg.\n\nIn India, Pondicherry was restored to the French by the Dutch. Despite the challenging negotiations, the treaty lasted only four years before the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession.\n\nThe Battle of Condore was fought in the year 1758 between the English and the French nez Masulipatam.\n\nLord Clive sent Colonel Forde to the province of Madras, and Forde defeated Hubert De Brienne (French Commander).\n\nThe arrival of Dupleix as French India in AD 1724 saw the beginning of the Anglo-French conflict (Carnatic wars) resulting in their final defeat in India.\n\nDupleix captured Madras in AD 1746. He was the first to initiate the policy of intervening in quarrels of Indian princes.\n\nImportant Personalities\n\nPrelim Facts\n\nWho were the first Europeans to set up Sea trade Centre in India? – Portuguese |UKPSC (Pre) 2004]\n\nWhich factory in Bengal was established by the Portuguese? – Hooghly [UPPSC (Pre) 2004}\n\nHooghly was used as a bare for Piracy in the Bay of Bengal by – Portuguese [IAS (Pre) 1995]\n\nWhich Portuguese Viceroy is connected with (Bhre Water Policy)? – Francisco de Almeida [UKPSC (Pre) 2016]\n\nWho is considered as the founder of Calcutta city? – Job Charnok [UPPSC (Mains) 2004]\n\nThe first to start a Joint Stock Company to trade with India were …….• – Dutch [IAS (Pre) 1994]\n\nDutch East India Company established its factory at Patna in which year? – 1632 [BPSC (Pre) 2019]\n\nWhich British company got the first Charter permitting them to trade in India? – Levant Company [UPPSC (Pre) 2014]\n\nWho was the emperor of India when the British East India Company was formed in London? – Akbar [UPPSC (Pre) 2012]\n\nDuring the time of which Mughal Emperor did the English East India Company established its first factory in India ? – Jahangir [IAS (Pre) 2008, 2009]\n\nWhere in India did Britishers set up their first factory in 1613? – Surat [BPSC (Pre) 1994]\n\nIn the first quarter of 17th century, in which region did the factories of the East India Company was located? – Broach [IAS (Pre) 2021]\n\nThe first factory of the East India Company was established at Surat [UPPSC (Pre) 1990]\n\nWhich British official defeated the Portuguese at Sowlley? – Thomas Best [BPSC (Pre) 2000)\n\nWho was the first European to imitate the policy of taking part in the quarrels of Indian Princess with a view to acquire territories ? – Dupleix IIAS (Pre) 1996]\n\nThe French India Company was constituted during the reign of – Louis XIV [UPPSC (Mains) 2014]\n\nWho is considered as the founder of French Company in India? – Colbert [UPPSC (Mains) 2003]\n\nFrom which region did the Europeans got best Shara (Saltpeter) and opium? – Bihar BPSC (Pre) 2005]\n\nWho was the last to came to pre-Independence India as traders? – French [IAS (Pre) 2007]\n\nWho remarked about the East India Company that the company is an anomaly, but it is a part of the system where everything is inconsistent? – TB Macaulay [UPPSC (Pre) 2012]\n\nWhich English Governor of East India Company in India was expelled by Aurangzeb? – Sir John Child IMPPSC (Pre) 2008]\n\nThe famous war of Wandiwash of AD 1760 was fought by the British against whom? – French [BPSC (Pre) 2020]\n\nName the French General, who was defeated in the battle of Wandiwash. – Comte De Lally [UKPSC (Pre) 2016]\n\nUPSC NCERT Practice Questions\n\n1.
