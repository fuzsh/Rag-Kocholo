        "text": "Let's begin with a lesser known historical fact. Contrary to popular knowledge, the British weren't the only colonisers to call Bengal a home away from home. Upstream along the quiet banks of the Hooghly river, not very far from the bustle of Kolkata, lie a string of dusty towns where much of Europe came to roost. And if you want to sample this slice of mothballed European heritage, a day trip out of Kolkata to Bengal's proverbial 'Little Europe' is all you need. Travelling about 40 km north from the city along the Old Grand Trunk Road, the first port of call is the town of Serampore, founded in 1755 by the Danish Asiatic Company as a trading outpost.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSerampore\n\nTeeming with relics, Serampore was once known by its Danish moniker Fredericksnagore--in honour of the King Frederick V of Denmark--is home to the magnificent Serampore College (with its awesome library), the Danish Cemetery and Henry Martin's Pagoda.\n\nChinsurah\n\nYour next stop is Chinsurah, where the Dutch settled in the early 17th century to deal in muslin, salt, spices and opium. You can admire the Chinsurah Court--formerly the Dutch Governor's residence and wander within the crumbling cemetery to sense the settlement's chequered past.\n\nBandel\n\nContinue up the road to Bandel, where the Portuguese set up a colony as early as in 1635. Once a thriving Portuguese stronghold, Bandel eventually fell to the spoils of time, but the imposing Bandel Basilica--where many a seafaring captain once paid obeisance still embodies the essence and grandeur of the former colony.\n\nHooghly\n\nMove on to the Hooghly Imambara, a behemoth of a structure built in the 1860s as a mosque and a centre for Islamic education. Climb up to the clock tower looming high above the ramparts of the building for superb vistas of the Hooghly river.\n\nThe inner courtyard of the Hooghly Imambara. Picture courtesy: Wikimedia/Amartyabas/Creative Commons\n\nChandernagore\n\nThe final--yet perhaps the most charming stop--is Chandernagore (within shouting distance from Bandel). The most recent of all European colonies in Bengal, Chandernagore, was governed by the French until 1951, after which it was finally ceded to the newly formed Indian Union. A lovely town by the Hooghly, it is worth a visit if you want to stroll along the picturesque Strand by the riverside, admiring the French Church and the former mansion of the French governor general, now a museum. Walk through the old town, and you will chance upon bakeries serving croissants and French loaves, and might even hear a few elderly Bengali folk conversing in French!\n\nGood to know\n\nStay: Try the basic, state-operated Rabindra Bhavan in Chandernagore."
