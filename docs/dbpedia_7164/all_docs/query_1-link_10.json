        "text": "On a recent visit to Chinsurah, a small town in the Hooghly district of West Bengal, I was truly taken aback by the rich history of the area. The Portuguese founded the town of Hooghly-Chinsurah on the banks of the Hooghly river in 1579 after obtaining permission from then Mughal emperor Akbar. The town prospered as a port and trading settlement with the Portuguese even building a church at Bandel. However, the famous Bandel Church was burnt down by the Mughals during the siege of Hooghly in 1632. The story goes that a priest from the church and a few thousand Christians were taken to Agra and condemned to death by ferocious elephants at the command of emperor Shah Jahan.\n\nHowever, one elephant refused to attack the priest and the emperor took this as a sign and pardoned the prisoners. They were sent back to Bandel and even given money to reconstruct the church. The Bandel Church today receives pilgrims from all across Bengal and has been designated as a minor basilica by the Vatican.\n\nAfter the Portuguese, the Dutch established a factory at Chinsurah in 1656. This was during the time of the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch even built a fort named Gustava in the town. In fact, the Dutch held their sway over Chinsurah from 1615 to 1825 after which they ceded the town to the British. The latter too left their mark on the town through their architecture – the Edwardian Clock Tower and the district court building, which was built with the demolished remains of the Dutch fort, are classic examples.\n\nTaken together, the Hooghly river region is dotted with townships like Chinsurah that share a rich colonial history. The Portuguese, Dutch, French, Danes and British all had their trading settlements here. And monuments from that era can still be found in the region. Alas, the area has never been seriously promoted for tourism. In fact, such is the deplorable state of affairs today that many locals in Chinsurah have little or no knowledge about the town’s history. There is no organised tourist circuit and places of interest are hardly advertised.\n\nEven the Bandel Church – the one historical monument that does get a significant number of visitors – isn’t tourism friendly. Information about the history of the church is sparse. Nor could I find any guides to give us a proper tour of the grounds. This is unfortunate since the Bandel Church is the oldest church in Bengal. Hence, despite sitting on a veritable tourism goldmine, the Hooghly river region suffers from apathy and historical ignorance.\n\nContrast this with the historical city of Melaka in Malaysia which I happened to visit over the summer. Interestingly, the colonial history of Melaka mirrors that of Hooghly-Chinsurah. The Portuguese conquered Melaka in 1511. They in turn were displaced by the Dutch in 1641 before the British finally took over 1825 as per the Anglo-Dutch Treaty.\n\nBut unlike Hooghly-Chinsurah, the Malaysian government has really preserved and promoted Melaka. The latter is a Unesco world heritage site and stands as a symbol of confluence of cultures – an idea that is particularly helpful for Malaysia given its diverse ethnicities. Tourists to Melaka have access to fantastic museums, well-preserved colonial buildings, historical monuments and other attractions. Needless to say that all of this ensures that tourism revenues from Melaka are significant.\n\nMy point is, why can’t we do the same thing with Hooghly-Chinsurah? The latter can be advertised as the Europe of Bengal. And with a little bit of imagination and focussed development, Hooghly-Chinsurah can become a major tourism hub for Bengal. This will no doubt have a huge positive impact on the local economy as tourism provides the maximum returns for every rupee invested. With this in mind, the Bengal government must draw up a comprehensive blueprint for developing tourism in the Hooghly-Chinsurah region. The latter is already well-connected by road and railway. What it needs is a revival of a sense of history to attract a large number of tourists. Other necessities such as hotels, lodges and restaurants will follow. Hopefully, someone in the Bengal government is listening."
