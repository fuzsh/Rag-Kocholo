        "text": "At the core of this contribution lies the paperwork produced in the eighteenth-century offices of the zamindar saheb fiscaal in Chinsurah, Bengal and the disāva in Jaffna, Sri Lanka (Ceylon). Although the vernacular titles might suggest that we would be dealing here with Bengali and Tamil or Sinhalese bureaucracies, the officials holding these offices were actually Dutchmen. These Dutchmen held the rank of (junior) merchants within the organization of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). Certainly when looked at from the present day, these offices are sites that confuse: in the early modern imperial contexts, people, offices, and functions were not what they appeared to be at first sight; in other words: a Dutchman, sent out as koopman (merchant) could in practice be zamindar and rule as a village chief and magistrate or if he was a disāva, he would act as a judge, police magistrate, and tax-collector at once.\n\nOffices like those of the zamindar fiscaal and the disāva form perfect spaces to rethink what constituted empire in the early modern world. These offices were essentially bilingual spaces, where scribes produced and translated paper and palm-leaf documents in different languages. Land grants, title deeds, verdicts, registers of corvée services were the types of paperwork that mattered to people locally, whether they were local peasants, merchants, or Dutch officials. When visiting the offices of the zamindar fiscaal or the disāva, local men and women entered the world of the VOC, an empire that encompassed distant places such as Amsterdam, Cape Town, Batavia (Jakarta), and Deshima in Japan. Yet the language they used in these offices, when addressing empire, was, more often than not, the local vernacular. In the early-modern Dutch empire things were not what they appeared to be at first sight.\n\nIn this article, we analyze the ways in which the tentacles of the Dutch empire penetrated village life in South Asia, in particular the villages surrounding Chinsurah and Jaffnapatnam. We call these spaces the “fringes of empire,” because even if colonial activity and interaction there was intense, it was peripheral to the initial central aims of the Dutch empire. While the core business of the VOC was trade in spices and textile, their personnel was often engaged in all sorts of more mundane imperial business. In the villages of Jaffna and Chinsurah, we witness the initial transformation of the VOC from a trading corporation to a land-based empire, along lines similar to those of the English East India Company (EIC). The difference is of course that with the bankruptcy of the VOC in 1799, the Dutch empire crumbled and eventually disappeared from the South Asian stage. Yet prior to the dismantling of the VOC, the Dutch became entrenched in bureaucracies of land management, a process that was not peripheral or incidental, but rather symptomatic of a broader transition from commercial to land-based empires.\n\nAnd therefore, during the century prior to its bankruptcy, Dutch merchants, disguised as landlords, police magistrates, and tax-collectors, were holding an empire together that was otherwise fragmented, and in their operation they relied heavily on pre-existing bureaucratic practices. In their offices, the zamindar fiscaal and the disāva produced the type of paperwork that generally remained invisible to the central officers who steered the VOC, primarily the directors in Amsterdam and the High Government of Batavia. This part of the Dutch overseas presence has been subsequently overlooked by the historians of the Dutch empire.\n\nIt is only recently that historians have seriously undertaken the task of studying the Dutch empire as a historical entity. In a recent article, Catía Antunes provides us with a historiographic explanation of the late “discovery” of the Dutch empire among historians. The Dutch Companies, the VOC (and West India Company or WIC for the Atlantic) were generally studied from the perspective of business history. At the same time, the local processes of contact, economic extraction, warfare, and colonialism were mainly viewed from the perspective of the national histories of the respective regions where the Dutch left a lasting imprint, such as Indonesia, South Africa, and Surinam. Cátia Antunes' call for an all-encompassing understanding of the Dutch empire goes hand in hand with questions about Dutch imperial ideologies and characteristics. Antunes, along with Arthur Weststeijn and others, conceive of the Dutch empire as being driven by a company-state. They base their analysis on legal strategies and debates in the Dutch Republic at the time, as well as on the global performance of the Dutch companies.Footnote 1\n\nIn contrast, Piet Emmer and Jos Gommans recently presented a very different approach to the Dutch empire. They criticize the new emphasis on the empire as being driven by general Dutch imperial strategies. Instead, they argue that the Dutch empire should be understood as a “rather fluid conglomerate of overseas activities based on an amalgam of very different rights and privileges managed by a relatively small circle of Dutch regent families.”Footnote 2 They emphasize once more the mercantile essence of the Dutch empire. As a consequence, they view the imperial relations that were forged in the process and the emerging forms of colonialism as a mere byproduct of the company's commercial aims and subsequent local entanglements. In contrast to scholars like Antunes and Weststeijn, they reject the notion of the company-state.Footnote 3\n\nThe local bureaucracies we present as case studies in this article do not neatly fit either side of this debate. On the one hand, they do represent localized forms of rule that might fit better with the observation of Emmer and Gommans that the Dutch empire was a “fluid conglomerate.” At the same time, these bureaucracies very clearly represent the state-like character of the company, which is manifested in its daily operation overseas rather than at its center in the Dutch Republic. The company as a “fluid conglomerate” absorbed local bureaucracies and law throughout its empire, but it did so in very diverse manners. The case studies of Chinsurah and Jaffna illustrate precisely this slippery character of the Dutch empire that makes it so difficult to be grasped through a single model. Perhaps the Dutch empire can best be characterized as a chameleonic entity: it had the outlook of a commercial empire, but usurped governmental duties and rights; at times its adaptive and reactive capacities on the ground gave the empire a highly localized character, but when looked at up close, its performance was never just local.\n\nOver the past years, local bureaucracies in South Asia have been a subject of study among historians of the Mughal and British empires. The work of Bhavani Raman and Miles Ogborn on the role that local scribes in company's service had in the shaping of law and bureaucracy has been highly influential. Nandini Chatterjee's work on Persianate record-keeping traditions in both the Mughal and British spheres has helped in understanding how cultures of bureaucracy persist over time and can carry trans-imperial characteristics.Footnote 4 Our analysis of the local entrenchment and of Dutch imperial bureaucratic practice draws from their sensitivity to vernacular practices of rule.\n\nFurthermore, our focus on the production and the daily use of Dutch imperial paperwork speaks to broader questions about the workings of global empires. In the words of historians Crooks and Parsons: “bureaucracy played a role in providing empires with a means of articulating social power and marshalling resources in regions remote from the imperial core.” What they propose is a view of empire from the inside that brings to life “the ‘lived experience’ of imperial bureaucratic rule, the identity of bureaucrats, the role of bureaucracy in shaping historical memory and creating a shared imperial space, and the social and ideological impact of bureaucracy on subject peoples.”Footnote 5 Such an approach helps in understanding the workings of Dutch imperial bureaucracy from its daily operation in South Asia.\n\nOur analysis of the paperwork in Chinsurah and Jaffna then seeks to understand the more mundane meaning of paperwork within the context of the Dutch empire. We will first map out and compare the record-keeping traditions in the two regions. This will particularly focus on two themes: first, the character of land administration in both areas through an analysis of the bilingual pattas from Bengal and olas and land-thombos of Jaffna. Second, we will look at the process of doing bureaucracy in the village: who was involved, what languages were used, and what ritual practices encompassed the bureaucratic administration. In both cases we will underline the importance of lineage in the shaping of imperial bureaucracies. At the same time, the comparison reveals substantial differences in forms and degrees of bureaucratic blending that took place in both places.\n\nIn the third section, we will address the performance of village bureaucracy in both regions through an analysis of civil cases and disputes that were brought before the village tribunals called the katcheri and landraad. The cases show that while some villagers used the colonial bureaucracy to their advantage, the same institutions became a hotbed of abuse of power by individual Dutchmen and local powerholders. Use and abuse are two integrative forces that were intrinsically bound up in these layered histories of South Asian village bureaucracies and expanding colonialism. And as such they contributed to the shaping of the Dutch empire."
