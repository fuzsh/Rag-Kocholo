        "text": "This painting from 1665 depicts the Dutch East India Company (VOC) trading fort at Hugly, on the banks of the Ganges River branch of the same name in the Indian province of Bengal. As they did elsewhere along the rim of the rich and populous Indian Ocean basin, the Dutch sought to establish exclusive control over specific commodities, usually after driving out the Portuguese. In Bengal, the main export items were fine cotton print fabrics, which, along with a variety of products already circulating in the region, they traded mostly for Spanish-American silver. The VOC would eventually be displaced by the English East India Company. (Courtesy of Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.)\n\nGovernor of the East India Company’s fort at Madras. He quickly learned to exploit his post to export cloth, pepper, saltpeter, opium, and diamonds. Upon his return to England in 1699, Yale was the contemporary equivalent of a multimillionaire. Although he never visited New Haven, his philanthropic capital, skimmed from East India Company profits, was piously invested in colonial higher education.\n\nAt about the same time, England’s Admiralty, under pressure from EIC investors, commissioned a Scottish-born but New York City-based privateer named William Kidd to search for English pirates interfering with Company-protected trade in the Indian Ocean, especially in the Red Sea. Instead, Kidd foolishly attacked and plundered a Mughal-sponsored merchantman off the southwest coast of India. Now a pirate himself, Kidd fled to Madagascar in the stolen vessel, then across the Atlantic to the Caribbean. Eventually, Kidd tried to contact his wife in New York, but he was captured and sent in chains to Boston, then London. At the urging of East India Company officials, whose friendship with Emperor Aurangzeb had been severely strained by the renegade pirate hunter’s actions, Kidd was hanged in 1701. The company’s interests in distant seas were, it seems, increasingly the government’s.\n\nWhy was the tiny sultanate of Aceh able to hold out against European interlopers in early modern times?\n\nIslamic Identity"
