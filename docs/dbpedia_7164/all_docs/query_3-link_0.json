        "text": "In 1947 the partition of Bengal between newly independent India and Pakistan constituted a serious setback for Calcutta, which became the capital of West Bengal only, losing the trade of a part of its former hinterland. At the same time, millions of refugees from the eastern portion of Bengal—which had become East Pakistan (now Bangladesh)—flocked to Calcutta, aggravating social problems and increasing overcrowding, which had already assumed serious proportions. Economic stagnation in the mid-1960s further increased the instability of the city’s social and political life and fueled a flight of capital from the city. The management of many companies was assumed by the state government.\n\nIn the 1980s, large-scale public works programs and centralized regional planning contributed to the improvement of economic and social conditions in the city. Beginning in the 1990s, large-scale manufacturing companies were mostly replaced with small-scale assembly, commercial, and other service-sector business firms. However, militant trade unions slowed the introduction of new technology and deterred entrepreneurial activity and investment. In addition, despite the construction of a subway system—a welcome addition to the existing mass transit system—a rapid increase in the number of privately owned vehicles produced severe traffic congestion. The city was dealt a major blow in September 2000, when parts of it were inundated by floodwaters. The flooding left hundreds of people dead and tens of thousands homeless.\n\nIn 2001 the city’s name was officially changed from Calcutta to Kolkata. Although Kolkata is not as economically dynamic as some of the other major Indian cities, it continues to be a cultural, artistic, literary, and intellectual centre.\n\nN.K.
