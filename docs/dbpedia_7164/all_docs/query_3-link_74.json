        "text": "French Colonial Town of Chandernagore, West Bengal\n\nChandernagore is an erstwhile French Settlement, until Independence in 1951, situated 40kms north of Calcutta in West Bengal and is now part of the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. Characterised by its beautifully laid out Strand and promenade as well as garden houses of the French and rich Bengali merchants, Chandernagore is an example of a once flourishing trading town. It is now suffering from unplanned and piecemeal development which threatens its very sense of place.\n\nThis project an initiative of ATA, was conceptualised to bring focus on Chandernagore which had since independence slipped into dereliction while Pondicherry rose as the iconic image of the French in India. The project involved the preparation of a conservation area appraisal to firstly define what is important about its character and appearance and to identify its important characteristics and buildings of heritage value. It identified the area's special features and changing needs through a process which includes researching its historical development, carrying out a detailed townscape analysis and preparing a character assessment. It analysed the issues affecting the area as well as provided recommendations for its conservation and further sustainable development.\n\nThis project became the inspiration for the photo exhibition France Remains which was conducted as part of the Bonjour India Festival in 2013."
