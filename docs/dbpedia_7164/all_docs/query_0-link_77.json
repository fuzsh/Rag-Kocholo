        "text": "A region as geographical units is a historical construction whose boundary is defined and redefined by the contemporary political and culture condition. Our delineation of region depends on our perspective on the history. It is to be noted that, during the seventeenth and first half of the eighteenth century, we know that the geographical limits of subha was often the exceeded area now presently covered by East Bengal or Bengladesh and the Indian state West Bengal. And also we noted that, during the contemporary time period, a flourishing textile industry, urbanization and trade with the western Gangetic plains, and also IndaEuropean maritime trade. We see that seventeenth and first half of the eighteenth century, Company established trade relations with Bengal only after it had been operating elsewhere in the subcontinent for a period of nearly three decades. But once a beginning had been made, the growth of the Company &#39;s trade in the region was remarkable rapid. During the la...\n\nThe Dutch East India Company or the Veerenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC) was founded in 1602 in the Dutch Republic for carrying on trade and territorial expansion in the Indian Ocean region. Among other places in Asia, it operated in Mughal India as well throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries until its dissolution, when the English East India Company (EIC) took over political power. The base of the EIC was Bengal, which also witnessed a considerable Dutch presence in the previous years. The arrival of the VOC in Bengal was first registered around Pipli in 1615. 1 At this time, the Dutch Company had already set up its bases in other places like Surat, the coast of Coromandel and Mal abar. However, in Bengal, the VOC was yet to make its mark. By the end of the seventeenth century, the number of Dutch factories in this region had multiplied with the VOC trying to consolidate its position. A lot has been written about the EIC's activities in Bengal in this century. Rila Mukherjee points out how the English discourse in these years began producing a stereotypical image of Bengal. Prompted by the English ambassador, Thomas Bowrey's narratives, an image of 'Brand Bengal' was born. 2 While this was, indeed, a significant phenomenon, the Dutch presence in Bengal was probably as important in the beginning as its English counter part's. Despite this, very little scholarly attention has been given to studying the VOC in this region and not much research has been done on Dutch visions of seventeenth-century Bengal.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company (VOC) shared a history of two hundred years of coexistence with the locals in Bengal. And yet their official reports had little to say about this relation, except frequent complaints against the locals and the accompanying, inherent distrust. There has been, however, a significant amount of historiography that has developed in the recent decades on Indo-Dutch contacts based on the information available in the sources. This article aims to add more nuances to these dynamics, by showing how the Company and its officials were seen by the locals in Bengal. It argues that the local–Dutch relation had not just been about static characterisations of 'partnership', 'cooperation' or 'conflict', but was rather dependant on personal networks and profit motives backed by diverse social positions. The Dutch in the perception of the locals had different meanings, images and implications. Through the study of three objects—local texts, a Dutch painting and a legal case—this article aims to capture precisely these very perceptions in contributing towards the complex of Indo-Dutch interactions in seventeenth century Bengal. I had a book in my hands to while away the time, and it occurred to me that in a way a landscape is not unlike a book—a compilation of pages that overlap without any two ever being the same. People open the book according to their taste and training, their memories and desires: for a geologist the compilation opens at one page, for a boatman at another, and still\n\nThe history of European trade in Asia pre-date the discovery of the Cape route by the Portuguese, but undoubtedly this new route gave the thrust in extensive and bulk trading, especially when two north Atlantic powers joined the Portuguese, namely the Dutch and English East India companies. On the other hand, Bengal as a Mughal' subah' already had a rich and prosperous mercantile culture where Bengali traders were engaged with Sumatra, Malay, Java, Arab, Persia and China. Bengal also had a rich geographical and environmental advantage in the form of numerous navigable water channels and conducive weather for agriculture, which made agricultural produce surplus and other job options possible, thus creating a large body of artisans, weavers, bankers, merchants etc. With the Portuguese involved in the trade of the Bay of Bengal, its products reached Europe and over the years, there was a market-ready in Europe for certain kinds of products from Bengal, namely textiles and silk. This vast European market with meagre supply made Dutch and English enthused to enter the Asian market, and their vigorous and disciplined way of functions, very different from Portuguese unruly, powerdriven and disruptive nature, made them successful in small time. Slowly, the composition of goods exported from Bengal changed based on the heightened demand of Europe. With an already established local banking and financial system, this gave Bengal its most prosperous two hundred years, when European import reached its peak in return for bullion and gold. This is a collection of review papers based on secondary sources where we inquire into the world of economy, trade, communication, and industrialization-European as well as indigenous, the interconnection and interdependence between different political and economic forces in Bengal in the period under review.\n\nFrom the mid-seventeenth century onwards, Kasimbazar emerged as the English East India Company's (EIC) primary market for silk and its textiles. The region surrounding Kasimbazar was prolific in producing silk goods destined for export. Attracted by Bengal silk's substantial profitability, EIC's directors in London envisaged an expansion to regions with existing infrastructure capable of delivering high-quality raw silk and textiles. Subsequently, Mr. Streynsham Master was dispatched to Bengal as a special envoy to strategize this expansion. The establishment of the EIC's sixth factory at Malda directly resulted from this mission. However, the nascent years of the Malda settlement were fraught with challenges, leading company officials to perceive Malda as a subordinate to Hooghly and Kasimbazar with uncertain business potential. But, within two decades, consistent profits began to reshape this perception. Up until the key shifts in 1898 and 1899-EIC acquiring zamindary rights in Calcutta, establishing Fort William as the English headquarters, and the subsequent relocation of the subah capital from Dhaka to Murshidabad in 1706-interactions with local provincial rulers were mired in extortion and bribery. Nonetheless, the handsome profit margins painted a promising outlook for the EIC's future in the region. This paper delves into the initial 25 years after the Malda factory's inception. It evaluates the hurdles faced; the resolutions reached-whether through diplomacy or through petitions to distant Dhaka-the appointment of dadani merchants, the inclusion of pykers, and most notably, the trajectory of business growth and profits during this period."
