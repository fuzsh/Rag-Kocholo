        "text": "Experience Ganges\n\n3 day & 2 night bus and cruise tour along Hooghly River\n\nRivers always played an important role in shaping civilizations. The Hooghly River, a distributory of the Ganga (or Ganges), is no exception. The river have played an important role in shaping the history of colonial India.\n\nCalcutta (now Kolkata), the first capital of British India and the second city of the empire was also established on the Bank of the River Hooghly. It was not only British but other European power also had there presence along the river. This included Bandel (Portuguese), Chinsurah (Dutch), Chandannagar (French) and Serampore (Danish).\n\nMore on:\n\n`\n\nThese former colonial settlements along with the local culture forms an interesting mix and can be an ideal weekend tour destination from Kolkata.\n\nA combination of bus and ferry tour is the best way of exploring these shared heritage.\n\nRecently the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC) has come up with a 3 day & 2 night bus and ferry package of exploring the heritage along the Hooghly River.\n\nIt included two night halts at Mangaldhara Tourism Property (formerly Malancha Tourist Lodge) in Barrackpur (or Barrackpore). I was specially invited to be part of their inaugural tour.\n\nDay I:\n\nThe tour started at 9 am from the WBTDCL head office in BBD Bag, Kolkata. It was a bus ride up to Barrackpur (or Barrackpore).\n\nPacked breakfast was served in the bus and we reached Barrackpur in about one and half hours.\n\nBarrackpur is the first British barracks of the country and hence the name, but the town also has its share of local heritage.\n\nOur first stop was the towering Annapurna Temple, which has remarkable resemblance with the famous Dakshineswar Temple. The similarity is expected as it was constructed by Jagadamba, youngest daughter of Rani Rashmoni, who built the Dakshineswar Temple .\n\nThe complex is approached by a gateway topped with a lion. The temple with nine pinnacles (naba ratna) stands at the centre of the complex.\n\nThe complex also houses a natmandir, 6 Shiva temples and two domed guard houses.\n\nNext stop was the Mangal Pandey Udyan, named after a sepoy of the 34th Bengal Native Infantry who rose in rebellion against the British to mark the start of the Great Revolt of 1857.\n\nToday Mangal Pandey Udyan is a landscaped park on the banks of the Hooghly River and houses a bust of the great martyr. An old cannon is on display and there is a tomb like structure but nothing is mentioned about their history.\n\nJust outside the Mangal Pandy Udyan is a towering tower. It was once part of a communication system that connected Kolkata with Barrackpur.\n\nKnown as Semaphore, it was a pre telegraphy optically coded communication system.\n\nInitiated in early 19th century in India it once spanned across northern India and several of the semaphore towers still stands.\n\nSadly the semaphore tower of Barrackpur was located inside the Flag Staff House compound, which is under the supervision of Indian army, and was not part of the tour.\n\nMore on:\n\n`\n\nThe former British barrack, Barrackpur still holds on to its colonial legacy. Large parts of Barrackpur are still under the control of Indian army and another large section operates as a police training school under West Bengal Police and is known as Swami Vivekananda State Police Academy (SVSPA).\n\nAlthough the areas of the Indian Army were excluded from the tour but the heritage structures inside the police training school were included.\n\nThe entry is through the Lady Hardinge Bridge a beautiful bridge dating back to 1911.\n\nThe first stop was the Aviary Pond. The Aviary was the brain child of Lord Auckland (Governor General 1835 – 42). It was located next to a pond which exist to this day.\n\nIn 2018 the pond and surrounding area was restored. Next to the pond is a recreated barrack which houses a World War II gallery complete with a time line and large cutouts of newspaper reports.\n\nBeing a British cantonment Barrackpur has its share of colonial architecture. The Governor House which once served as a weekend retreat for the viceroys and governor generals has been beautifully restored and converted into a museum. The house dates back to 1801 and has been extended and modified several times.\n\nThe museum provides an insight into the colonial history of Barrackpur and a small documentary on the settlement is screened for visitors. The museum also houses an arms gallery and two other rooms are laid out with a grand piano and colonial furniture.\n\nThe garden is also beautifully laid out with fountains and a sun dial. Behind the compound is a huge banyan tree with numerous hanging roots. It is believed that Mangal Pandey was hanged to death from this tree.\n\nNext stop was the Tomb of Lady Canning. Charlotte Canning or Lady canning was the wife of Lord Canning the last governor general and first viceroy of India. She died in 1861 and was buried in Barrackpore. A beautiful tomb was built in her honor.\n\nLater the tomb was removed to the compound of St. John’s Church in Kolkata and a similar, but less elaborate, tomb was rebuild over her grave. Overlooking the grave stands the horse mounted statue of Lord Canning.\n\nFinally it was time to Mangaldhara Tourism Property (formerly Malancha Tourist Lodge) in Barrackpur. After a short rest and lunch it was time to hit the road again.\n\nThe first stop was the Belur Mathand it was followed by a ferry ride on MV Sumangal along the Hooghly River to the Dakshineswar Temple. It was followed by a road trip back to the tourism property of Barrackpur.\n\nBaul Performance at Mangaldhara Tourism Property, Barrackpur\n\nBack at the tourism property the evening was well spent with beautiful baul music from local artist. It was a beautiful performance with several of the guest participating in the singing and dancing. The day ended with a tasty dinner.\n\nDay 2:\n\nIt was a early morning start on day 2 in MV Sumangal and we headed north along the Hooghly River.\n\nThe river cruise started with a beautiful sunrise as we sailed past the Henry Martin Pagoda and Danish Tavern with the the spire of St. Olave Church towering in the distant horizon.\n\nHooghly is a tidal river and it was low tide the ferry sailed against the current and thus reducing the speed of the boat.\n\nIt was a relaxing journey and munching on our packed breakfast we sailed past the Palta Water Works, which dates back to 1866 and also past the Ichapur Rifle Factory.\n\nBoats and Ferries on Hooghly River\n\nFinally we made it to Rani Ghat, Chandannagar. The journey took over three and half hours and it was simply amazing.\n\nNow it was again time to again hit the road with several destination on our schedule. The first stop was the spectacular Tomb of Susana Anna Maria.\n\nSusana Anna Maria was a Dutch lady had according to legend she married seven times but historical record suggests she married only twice.\n\nNothing much is known about her. She died in 1809 and lies in eternal rest beneath a beautiful domed octagonal tomb, with the epitaph written along the drum of the dome. The tomb is presently located near Khadina More of Chinsurah (or Chuchura).\n\nMore on:\n\n`\n\nNext stop was Imambara. Imambara literally translates into house of Imam. It is built in memory of the great philanthropist Hazi Muhammad Mohsin and was completed in 1861. The building is centred around a rectangular courtyard, decorated with fountains and pools. But the prime attraction of the Imambara are it two 85 feet high towers, which offers great views of the river with the two bridges spanning across it.\n\nBidding farewell to Imambara we headed for the Bandel Church. Built in 1599 the Bandel Church is the oldest Christian church in Bengal. Sadly the church has been reconstructed and given a modern look.\n\nA stairs leads to the top balcony where devotees light candles in front of the “Our Lady of the Happy Voyage,” where candles are lit by devotees.\n\nMore on:\n\n`\n\nIt was a short stop at the Bandel Church and it was again time to hit the road for the Birth Place of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay\n\nIt was a long detour and the place was nothing impressive. Apart from a statue and a handfull of photographs of the author there was nothing on display.\n\nNext and final stop before lunch was Bansberia famous for Hangeshwari Temple and Anata Basudev Temple. The two contrasting temples create an unique blend of Bengal temple architecture.\n\nThe ek-ratna (single pinnacled) temple dates back to 1679 and contains elaborate terracotta ornamentation. Next to the Ananta Basudev Temple is the towering Hangeshwari Temple one of the most unique temple of Bengal. The 13 pinnacled temples with lotus bud shaped pinnacles represent more of a Russian Church than a Hindu temple.\n\nMore on:\n\n`\n\nFinally it was time for lunch. The lunch was hosted at Jaloshree Floating Restaurant, an initiative of WBTDCL. The luxury boat has seating arrangement at both the floors and also extended into the adjoining jetty.\n\nThe elaborate thali consisted of luchi, polau, and rice coupled with sabzi dal, jhuri alu bhaja, beguni, mochar chop and chicken chop.\n\nAlso included were mixed veg, dim kosha and chicken curry. The mean ended with papad, chutney and payesh.\n\nThe lunch was followed by a walking tour of the Chandannagar Strand. Probably there was no better way to digest the monstrous lunch.\n\nThe walk went past Chandannagar Court (officially known as Chandernagore Court), Clock Tower, Durga Charan Rakshit Ghat, Sacred Heart Church and Patal Bari.\n\nChandannagat, Strand\n\nFinally it was time to call it a day and we made our way via the Hooghly River back to the Mangaldhara Tourism Property in Barrackpur. The day ended with light snacks over a small cultural programme followed by dinner and night stay.\n\nMore on:\n\n`\n\nDay 3:\n\nThis was the final day of the tour starting with a breakfast at about 7 am. Next at 8 am it was a bus trip back home.\n\nNote: I was part of this tour on an invitation of West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC)\n\nPackage Cost: Package with deluxe river facing rooms cost ₹ 8599 (book online) and with non-river facing standard rooms cost ₹ 7899 (book online)\n\nSpecial Thanks:"
