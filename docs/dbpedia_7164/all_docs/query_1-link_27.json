        "text": "The early period\n\nThe name Kalikata was mentioned in the rent-roll of the Mughal emperor Akbar (reigned 1556–1605) and also in the Manasa-mangal of the Bengali poet Bipradas (1495). The history of Kolkata as a British settlement, known to the British as Calcutta, dates from the establishment of a trading post there by Job Charnock, an agent of the English East India Company, in 1690.\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 17, 2024, 2:49 AM ET (The Hindu)\n\nKolkata doctor rape-murder case: Mamata Banerjee failed to handle situation, says Nirbhaya’s mother\n\nAug. 17, 2024, 12:49 AM ET (The Hindu)\n\nKolkata doctor rape-murder: Junior doctors stage dharna in HIMS in Karnataka’s Hassan\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 9:49 PM ET (The Hindu)\n\nIn Kolkata, rape, murder, and rampage\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 9:51 AM ET (The Hindu)\n\nKolkata doctor rape and murder: Chennai doctors wear black badges at work\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 7:36 AM ET (The Hindu)\n\nKolkata doctor rape-murder case highlights: Indian Medical Association calls for nationwide strike, demands central law for safety of doctors\n\nCharnock had previously had disputes with officials of the Mughal Empire at the river port of Hugli (Hooghly) and had been obliged to leave, after which he attempted unsuccessfully to establish himself at other places down the river. When the Mughal officials, not wishing to lose what they had gained from the English company’s commerce, permitted Charnock to return once more, he chose Calcutta as the seat of his operations. The site was apparently carefully selected, being protected by the Hugli (Hooghly) River on the west, a creek to the north, and salt lakes to the east. Rival Dutch, French, and other European settlements were higher up the river on the west bank, so that access from the sea was not threatened, as it was at the port of Hugli. The river at this point was also wide and deep; the only disadvantage was that the marshes to the east and swamps within the area made the spot unhealthy. Moreover, before the coming of the English, three local villages—Sutanati, Kalikata, and Gobindapore, which were later to become parts of Calcutta—had been chosen as places to settle by Indian merchants who had migrated from the silted-up port of Satgaon, farther upstream. The presence of these merchants may have been to some extent responsible for Charnock’s choice of the site.\n\nBy 1696, when a rebellion broke out in the nearby district of Burdwan, the Mughal provincial administration had become friendly to the growing settlement. The servants of the company, who asked for permission to fortify their trading post, or factory, were given permission in general terms to defend themselves. The rebels were easily crushed by the Mughal government, but the settlers’ defensive structure of brick and mud remained and came to be known as Fort William. In 1698 the English obtained letters patent that granted them the privilege of purchasing the zamindari right (the right of revenue collection; in effect, the ownership) of the three villages. This area around Fort William—Calcutta—became the seat of the British province known as the Bengal Presidency.\n\nGrowth of the city\n\nIn 1717 the Mughal emperor Farrukh-Siyar granted the East India Company freedom of trade in return for a yearly payment of 3,000 rupees; this arrangement gave a great impetus to the growth of Calcutta. A large number of Indian merchants flocked to the city. The servants of the company, under the company’s flag, carried on a duty-free private trade. When the Marathas from the southwest began incursions against the Mughals in the western districts of Bengal in 1742, the English obtained permission from ʿAlī Vardī Khan, the nawab (ruler) of Bengal, to dig an entrenchment in the northern and eastern part of the town to form a moat on the land side. This came to be known as the Maratha Ditch. Although it was not completed to the southern end of the settlement, it marked the city’s eastern boundary.\n\nIn 1756 the nawab’s successor, Sirāj al-Dawlah, captured the fort and sacked the town. A number of Europeans were imprisoned in a small lockup popularly known as the Black Hole of Calcutta, and many died. Calcutta was recaptured in January 1757 by Robert Clive, one of the founders of British power in India, and by the British admiral Charles Watson. The nawab was defeated shortly afterward at Plassey (June 1757), after which British rule in Bengal was assured. Gobindapore was cleared of its forests, and the new Fort William was built on its present site, overlooking the Hugli at Calcutta, where it became the symbol of British military ascendancy."
