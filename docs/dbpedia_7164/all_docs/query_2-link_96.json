Very little is known of Hooghly* before the Portuguese came to settle in it. In fact, *>t had no separate independent existence as a city; it was a lowly outlying village, and bore almost the same relation to Satgaon,f which was then in its glory, as, by a painful irony of fate, Satgaon now bears to Hooghly. But, though it formed a most insignificant part of Satgaon, still it had a name of its own, and that name it is which it has continued to bear, through good report and evil report, down to the present time. It is commonly believed that Hooghly is a corruption of Golin, the name by which it was known to the Portuguese ; but this is only reversing the natural order of events, the fact being that Golin was a corruption of Hooghly, and not Hooghly a corruption of Golin. The name Hooghly was derived * This spelling has been accepted by Government, as being fixed by historical and literary usage. Dr. Hunter, however, has adopted “ Hughli,” which seems to be the more correct spelling. t Satgaon is the Saptagrama of the Pauranik writers, so Called from “ the seven villages ” composing it having been inhabited by seven princely Rishis of old. It was the royal emporium of Bi'ngal HOOGHLY PAST AND PRESENT. <SL from hogla* * reeds, with which the place was for the most part covered ; and as hogla easily slides into go/a in pronunciation, the Portuguese, finding it difficult to pronounce the native name correctly, changed it to Golin. In the Ain-i-Akbari, which, as is well known, was written in 1596 A.D., Abul Fazl calls the place Hughli, whereas in Faria Souza’sf Asia Portuguese, which was written some years and was known to the early Romans as GangJ Regia. Some, how¬ ever, identify the Gang/}. Regia of Ptolemy with Gaur, the ancient capital of Bengal. In the fourteenth century it was taken by the Mahomedans and was the seat of a satrapy, Izzuddin being its first Governor. Distant as Satgaon was from the Imperial Capital, it is no wonder that its governors often kicked against authority. Even in Akbar’s time it had the nickname of “ Bulghak-Khanah,” or “ House of Revolt.” Satgaon was also a place of great trade. The Venetian traveller, Caisar Frederick, who visited it about 1570, states that in it “the inerchints gather themselves together for their trade.” This exactly tallies with the account given in the well-known poem of Chandiy written about the same time, seventeenth century its trade was on gradual silting up of the river Saraswati. the author of India Vera described it as De Laet had seen it with his own eyes But with the dawn of the the decline, owing to the True it is that, id 1630, “ a beautiful town but if his description would have •been otherwise. The Padishahnamah says that in 1682 ^Satgaon was “decayed but though in a state of decay, it still continued to be a place of trade for the Portuguese for some years to come. (See Admiral Warwick’s Account , as quoted in Rev. Long’s article, On the hanks of the Bhagirathi , in the Calcutta Review for 1845). In Van Brouche’s Map (1660 A.D.) it is called “a village,” and when Blochmann visited it in 1870, he found the name applied to a collec¬ tion of eleven huts. I saw it only the other day. It looks like a “deserted village,” a faf more wretched place than Goldsmith’s “ Sweet Auburn.” * Elephant grass, or “ reed mace,” as the genus is called in English Botany.

In the Dutch memoir of Brouche.f which was written in 1660, the name appears us Oegli or Hoegli, which approaches nearer to the native name than the Golin of the Portuguese. All these circumstances plainly show that the name is not an exotic, but a plant indigenous to the soil. But though Hooghly does not owe its name to the Portuguese, any more than Calcutta^ does to the English, still it owes its fame to them. Indeed, its rise as a city dates from their settlement. The precise date of this settlement, however, it is not easy to determine. All that we can do is to try to fix a probable date. In 1497, the famous Portuguese navigator, Vasco-de-Gama, sailed round the Cape of Good Hope§ and landed at Calicut, 1 [ a city on the * In De Laet’s India Vera , However, it is called Ugeli . t Van Brouche was Chief of the Dutch Coromandel Agency from 165$ 1664.

The Portuguese, finding the trade profitable, sent out ship after ship, and at length obtained land and built forts. With the increase of trade there was also increase of dominion : Goa,* * * § Ceylon,f Malacca* and Ormuz'l were taken in succession. All these conquests were made by Alphonso Albuquerque|! who might be called the Clive of Portuguese India. Albuquerque proved himself a very popular ruler, so that, when he died at Goa, on 1 ( 5 th December, 15 ^ 5 >• he was bemoaned not more by his countrymen than by the natives. It is said that a Portuguese named Samprayo, or rather Sampayo, entered the Ganges with nine vessels in 1537 A.D., and that he built the fort at Hooghly, the vestiges of which are still * Goa was taken in 1516.

Indeed, the scene of his action was •Goa., where, by force of arms, he had usurped* the office of Chief Governor. Ilis rule/ however, was of a very short duration. The Home Government soon appointed Nunio to supersede him, and the result was that he was sent home a close prisoner to Lisbon. In 1545 , Hon Juan deCastrof was appointed Viceroy. His administration was a brilliant success, as that of his predecessor, the infamous Souza,+ had been a sad failure. During his rule the Portuguese Settle¬ ments in India <% touched the highest point of all * The injustice done to the “ Great Mascarine,” and the usurpation of his Government by Lopez Vas de Sampayo, afford one of the most interesting periods of the history of the Portuguese in India. Mas- carine ruled from October 1529 for nearly ten years, during which he gained some notable victories. Hence the great Portuguese poet says : — “ Thou seest and weepest thy country’s blotted name, The generous sorrow thine but not the shame. Nor long the Lusian ensigns stain'd remain, Great Nunio comes and razes every stain.” t Me was the fourth Viceroy of Portuguese India, and, though his rule lasted barely four years, established a high reputation and made the Portuguese name dreaded on all the coasts of India.

If his glowing description were taken to be literally true,, it would follow that the Portuguese India of his time covered a very large area, including the whole of the Gangetic valley. But history gives the lie direct to such an inference. India was then ruled over by the great Akbar, whose empire extended from Attock on the one side to Cuttack on the other. In point of fact, the Portuguese possessions lay principally along the coast; and this is all that appears from Souza’s account, who, in an ecstasy of patriotic zeal * Shakespeare’s Henry VIII, Act III, Sc. 2, Wolsey’s words. t Camoens came to India in 1553. He composed the Lusiad at Macao, whither he had been banished for having written a satire on his countrymen in India when Francis Barreto was the Viceroy. The satire which is named Disparates net India , gives a faithful picture of the state of morality during his rule. The poet was after¬ wards recalled from exile and returned to Lisbon in 1560. His grand Epic, for which he has got the cognomen of “ the Lusitanian Homer, was dedicated to King Sevastian, and appeared in 1572. , It has been rendered into English by both Sir R. Fanshawe and William Julius. Meikle. The poet died in 1579. The quotation is from the loth Book.

In 1569, three Portuguese missionaries, of whom Acjuaviva, Padri Radaf of Abul Fazl, was one, arrived at Akbar’s Court, the Great Mogul having expressed a desire to learn something of the Chistian religion. As yet Hooghly had not risen from obscurity. In the well-known Ghandi , which, as its colophon shows, was completed in 1499,* Saka era, corresponding to 1577 A.D., the poet, Kabikankana does not make mention of it, though he notices Ilalishahar and Gorifa (Gouripur), which are situated opposite to it, on the other side of the river. As for Satgaon, he makes too much of it, and the sacred Tribenif also comes in for its due share; but even the name of Hooghly is not to be found in the whole poem. If the Portuguese had at that time had their settlement at the place, the poet would not have left the matter unnoticed, more especially when he vents his spleen * The couplet referred to runs thus :— » ’‘ftt’F to <*<f 1 fa* fail ’ifal 11 t Raghunandana in his Prayaschitwa Tatwa calls Tribeni iC South Prayaga,” inasmuch as the bathing at that place secure*, in a Hindu point of view, the same sanctity as the bathing at Prayaga, properly so called, the Allahabad, or rather Ilalabassu of the Mahometans, does.

The author of the Ain states that the Feringis* (meaning of course the Portuguese) were in possession of Hooghly and Satgaon, and that the latter alone paid the revenue: The well-known traveller, Ralph Fitch, who visited Hooghly in 1585, described it as the “ chief keep of the Portuguese.” It would also appear that the great Military Revolt of 1580 found them in power at Hooghly. Mir Nazat, who was attached to the Imperial cause, on being defeated by the Afghan chief, Qutlu Khan, near Salimabad, a town oh the left bank of the river Damoodar, south-east of Burdwan, fled to the Portuguese Governor of that settlement,f whom the MSS of the Akbarnamah called Bartab Bar Feringi , or Partab Feringi. This hybrid name shows that the officer was either a * The word Firingi comes from the French ‘Franc,’ through the Arabs and the Persians, who pronounced it Ferang. When the Spaniards and the Portuguese first came to India, they were called Firang, and the error was never after rectified. It is now used to indicate the mixed descendants of Europeans. In the Vidyasundara of Bharat Chandra, Firingi stands for the Portuguese and Farash for the French. (Dr. Rajendra Lala’s Indo-Aryans , Vol. II, p. 203, Note). In the present clay the Hindus call the English Ingrej , the French Far ash the Portuguese Portukes , the Danes Dinamar , the Dutch Qlandaj , the Germans Ellamar t &c.

In view of all these facts and c ire urn- stances, it would not be wide of the mark to place the Portuguese settlement in Hooghly in the eighth •decade of the sixteenth century at the latest. The Portuguese had come out to India as traders ; but it was not long before they found the necessity for making territorial acquisitions. Fortunately tor. them, the celebrated Albuquerque was at the head of their Indian affairs. He was a remarkable man, and united in himself the valour of a solclief with the wisdom of a statesman. He conquered place after place, and laid the foundations of that Empire, the fame of which attracted other European nations to the Far East. Goa was established as the seat of the Viceroy, and from Goa, as the base of operations, other conquests were made. While their affairs were thus looking up, the Portuguese entered Bengal and made their settlement at Hooghlv. This was done with the permission of the Mogul Governor who then ruled the Province. A factory was built, and an agent was placed in cha’rge of it. Satgaon had not yet fallen, but was on its decline, though it was still the centre of commerce. The Portuguese of Hooghly tried to divert its trade to their own settlement, and in this they succeeded to a considerable extent, more especially as river com- * munication with Satgaon was becoming difficult, owing to the gradual silting-up of the river Sara&vati. This successful attempt on their part excited the jealousy of the Mogul officers at Satgaon, who b<ggao to throw obstacles in their way. But the Portuguese were not slow in taking steps to ensure their safety. They built a fort, and strongly fortified the place. It does not appear who the first Portuguese Governor of Hooghly was; but, whoever he was, he derived his authority directly from the Government at Goa.. In fact, he bore almost the same relation to the latter Government as the Governor of French Chan- dernagore* does to the Government at Pondicherry. Hooghly went on prospering, and large numbers came botli from the mother country and Goa. As yet the place had no regular Church to pray in. This was felt to be a desideratum, but the want did not remain a want long. Before the closef of the six¬ teenth century a splendid Church, with a beautifu Convent attached to it, had been built. The Church was blown up in the siege of 1632; but it was rebuilt in 1660. The inscription on its keystone gives the date* of the first and original building. In¬ course of time the Portuguese became very powerful * Properly Chanda?inagore y so called from the place having once abounded in sandal-wood.

Though nominally subject to the Great Mogul of Delhi, they were really the lords of the land. They used to pay some revenue, it is true ; but the payment was not regular. Now and then the Provincial Governor raised an outcry against them ; but he was soon bribed into silence. Many converts were made to the Roman Catholic religion, not so much by persuasion as by force , but after they had been so converted, they were, it would appear, tiot left in the lurch. Great pains were taken to improve their condition, and it is in evidence that some of them filled important posts. Nay, there was one who rose so high as to have become the Chief of the Settlement. As long as Akbar was on the throne of Delhi, the Portuguese fared well at Hooghly. A wise ruler as he was, he did not deem it prudent to harass them as the country had benefited much by their trade. In fact, the turbulent Afghans had kept him so very busy that he hardly found time to look to other- matters. Certain it is that, with the fall of Daud, in 1575, the Afghan supremacy in Bengal had come to an end ; but the storm had not yet subsided : it continued blowing on til! some time after the close of the sixteenth century, when it died away. In 1599, they sustained a signal defeat at the hands of the Ambar Chief, Raja Man Sing, who crippled then- powers and resources. Akbar died in 1605 and was succeeded by his on,.

The Portuguese of Ifooghly, how¬ ever, kept themselves quite aloof from this struggle ; they did not take part with the one side or the other. Their main object was trade, and to trade they principally directed their attention, not taking much thought of the questionable doings of their country¬ men in East Bengal. * He was one of the Bara Bhuiyas of Bengal, t The conquest of Jessore (Jasohara) by Man Sing has bee ( n graphically described by Bharat Chandra in a well-known poem which beats*the name of the victor.

The next Governor, Ibrahim Khan, however, was a different man altogether. He was not only a first-rate soldier, but also a first-rate administrator. Through the benignant influence of his rule, the country smiled with peace and prosperity. But soon a change came over it, which, however, was owing to a cause over which he had no control. Jehangir was undeniably a good man, but his goodness degenerated into a fault. As Sir Thomas Roe* says of him, “ he is of so good a disposition that he suffers all then to govern, which is worse than being ill.” But, in the matter of governing him, none approached his favourite wife, the far-famed Nur Jehan : In fact, he was a mere puppet in her hands. Among the sons of the Emperor, Khurrum (afterwards Slvah Jehan) was undoubtedly the fittest ; but. notwithstanding his superior worth and ability, he was not liked by Nur Jehan. The latter favoured the fourth son, Shahryar, to whom her only daughter * Roe visited India in 1615-16 A. D.

The consequence was that Khurrum raised the standard of revolt in 1621. He marched against Delhi, but was soon defeated by the Imperial army. Gn being pursued, he fled into Bengal and stationed himself at Burdwan. While at this place, he was waited upon by the Portuguese Governor of Hooghly, Michael Rodriguez, whom he received with the great¬ est kindness. The Prince promised him rich reward, if he would help him with some pieces of artillery and a detachment of European soldiers. But the Governor declined the offer, lest, by accepting it, he should incur the displeasure of his father, the Em¬ peror. The Prince’s feelings were sorely wounded, and it is very probable that lie secretly vowed ven¬ geance. But, though he did not get any assistance from the Portuguese, he, with the means and resources at his command, engaged the Mogul governor on the banks of the Ganges, who after having performed many feats of valour, fell fighting on the field of battle. Victory smiled on the Prince, and he became the Lord of Bengal in 1622. But, after lie had held it for two years, fortune again frowned upon him. Pie was defeated by the Imperialists, and, on his asking pardon from his father, was forgiven. Tehangir died in 1627, and was succeeded by Shah Jefian.

The principal event during his viceroy¬ alty was the siege and capture of Hooghly. The Portuguese might have forgotten all about the offence which their Governor, Michael Rodriguez, had given to Shah Jehan in 1621 ; but Shah Jehan himself, it would seem, had not let the matter pass out of his mind, and, now that he was in a position to make them feel the weight of his displeasure, was on the look-out for an opportunity to take action against Khan to them. Accordingly, he directed Kasim keep a sharp eye upon them, and to inform him of their doings, if they acted arbitrarily or unjustly. For two full years, the wary Viceroy watched them with the greatest attention, and, having obtained sufficient- information in the matter, preferred a complaint against them to the Emperor. The principal charges were, that they had converted many natives to Chris¬ tianity by force, and fortified their Settlement without permission. There were also some minor counts, as, for instance, their having levied tolls on the boats which passed by their factory, and drawn off all the trade from Satgaon. Shah Jehan, who was only seek¬ ing for a specious plea to give vent to his displeasure, ordered Kasim Khan at once to turn the Portuguese out of Bengal. But the Governor knew very well that the order could not be carried out with the same promptitude with which it had been given. Hooghly was strongly fortified, and the garrison which defetid- w* • oc -<-,X IIOOGHLY PAST AND PRESENT. ed it, was pretty considerable. The place* could not be attacked from the side of the river, as there,were- many well-equipped vessels always ready to serve as a strong bulwark to it. The fort, besides being well- founded, was surrounded by a deep moat which never became dry. Great preparations had, therefore, to be made before such a place could be attacked with any chance of success. But Kasim was equal to the occasion, and he had a worthy co-adjutor in his brave son, Enayet Ullah, whose soldierly qualities were of a very high order.! A large corps was sent from Dacca, under Enayet, with Allah Yar Khan as the- second in command, while a small detachment was despatched, under Khwajah Shere, from another quarter. On the nth June, 1632, the Mogul army besieged) ITooghly. The Portuguese had written to the Govern¬ ment at Goa for reinforcements ; but as yet none had arrived. In fact, no succour ever came, though the siege lasted for a pretty long time. The Portuguese, in their despair, endeavoured to escape by means of boats down the river; but all their efforts in that direction were baffled by Khwajah Shere, who * William Bruton, quarter-master of the Hopewell East India- man, who wrote an account of his party, describes Ilooghly (in 1632)* as “an island, made by the Ganges, having several thousand Portu¬ guese Christians in it.” A writer, in Stewart’s Descriptive Catalogue, represents ITooghly as-“ protected on one side by a river, and on the other three, by a deep ditch which was filled by the tide.” t Mnsum Khan, grandson of “the rich zamindar Isa” of Khijdrpur, was also in command of a detachment, at this important siege.

The besieged held out for three entire months,* when the Mogul soldiers succeeded in laying dry the ditch in front of the Church, dug a mine, and blew up a portion of the town. Hooghly was taken on the ioth September. The loss on the side of the Portuguese was immense : out of 64 large vessels. 57 grabs, and 200 sloops which were anchored opposite the town, only one grab and two sloops made their escape. The captain of the largest vessel, on which were embarked 2,000 men, women and children, with all their goods and valuables, rather than yield to the Musalmans, set fire to the magazine and blew them up; and many other vessels followed his.desperate example. Ten thousand Portuguese are said to have perished during the siege, and 4,400 were taken prisoners. About 10,000 natives, whom the Portuguese had in their power, were liberated. A thousand Musalmans died as martyrs for their religion.f Thus fell Hooghly* * In the Badshahnamak of Abdul Hamid Lahori, it is stated that the siege lasted for three and half months. But in the Taurikk- i-Khafi Khan , or Kafi Khan’s Annals (a later work,) the period is given as three months only. (See Elliot’s ‘History of India as told by its own Historians,’ Vol. VII.)

Three days after the fall, the Governor, Kasim Khan, who had brought it about, departed this world. Hooghly, having thus fallen into the hands of the Moguls, was made the Royal Port in Bengal. All the offices and records were removed thither from Satgaon, which soon sank into insignificance. A Fouzdar was appointed from Court, who had considerable powers given him. He, it would appear, was the head of the Police, and also exercised jurisdiction in criminal cases.* The Fouzdar at first held his office subject to the Governor of the province, but in process of time he was made in¬ dependent of him. It was the Nawab Murshid Kuli Khan who, again, reduced him to his sub¬ ordinate position. The pay of the Fouzdar was at one time very high, but it was afterwards cut down to Rs. 32,000 a year.

The year following^ is memorable for the first set.tlement§ trmde by the English in India. Hawkins was followed by Sir Thomas Roe,(| who landed at Surat in 1615.

All this took place during the Viceroyalty of Ajim Khan, who had succeeded Kasim Khan, and who ruled Bengal till 1637.

Mir Jumla was succeeded by Shaista Khan, who was the nephew of the celebrated Nur Jehan. Shaista Khan’s administration was.long, for, barring a break of about three years, he governed Bengal from 1663 to 1689. During the first period* of his rule, Euro¬ pean commerce made great progress. In the year of his accession to the government, the English East India Company placed their factories in Bengal under the control of Madrast and established out-factories at Baleswar and Kasim-Bazar. Their first manager was Marshall, probably the first Sanscrit scholar among Englishmen. It has been already stated that the English, though they had been allowed to build a factory at Hooghly, were not permitted to approach it with their ships.

This was no small grievance, for on every such occasion they were obliged to pay a large douceur to the Mogul officers. When Shaista Khan left Bengal, the Chief of the English factory sent an envoy with him to the Emperor Aurungzebe to solicit a perpetual firman, precluding the necessity of periodical renewal. The order was at last obtained, but not without difficulty, and chiefly through the aid and influence of Shaista Khan. The well-known French physician, Bernier, was present at the Court •of the Great Mogul at this time ; and had it not been for the fact that his countrymen had only recently made their settlement in Bengal, lie would have tried to obtain some such order for them, Shaista Khan was re-appointed to Bengal in the latter part of 1679. This time he proved the very Teverse of what he had been before he resigned his office in 1677. But this, change in his policy was not owing to any change in his character. The fact was 'that he could not disobey the unjust and arbitrary orders of a bigoted monarch, who ran counter to the wise policy of his illustrious ancestor, Akbarthe Great- •described it as “a handsome place, kept beautifully clean, and looking more like an European town than Calcutta, or any of its neighbouring cantonments.” At that time Colonel Jacob Krefting (1805-1828) wes the Danish Governor of Serampore. _ ^ ^ loUod HOOGHLY PAST AND PRESENT. so far from endeavouring to weld his Musalman- and non-Musalman subjects into one harmonious- whole, greatly widened the gulf between them.

But it was not the Hindoos aidne who were harassed by this odious tax. At Hooghly, the Nabob’s officers demanded the same payment from the Europeans, but they got off by a rich present to the Viceroy.

The Company’s trade proving very lucrative, many private merchants intruded into it, though, by the terms of the Charter which had been granted by Queen Elizabeth, the right was restricted to the Company’s Agents.* Many efforts were made to put down these “interlopers,” as they were called,, but all to no purpose. The Court of Directors at length found that the only way to prevent their trading in Bengal, was to prevent their entering the river. Accordingly, they desired the Chief at Hooghly to solicit the permission of the Nabob to- erect a fort at the mouths of the Ganges, or on its banks, that they might more effectually intercept the vessels of the interlopers. But Shaista Khan, rightly thinking that this would give the English the command of the whole river, refused their peti¬ tion. There had also been about this time some disturbances in Bihar; and the Company’s Agent at Patna, having been charged with complicity, was placed in confinement.» The heart of the Nabob was, in fact, quite alienated from the: English, and he issued orders confiscating all their factories in Bengal.

It was about this time that they began to fortify their settlement at Chinsura. The fort,* however, was not finished until 1687.

But, while negotiations were going on, an incident happened which gave a fatal turn to the whole affair. On the 28th October, 1686, three English soldiers, strolling in the market-place in Hooghly, quarrelled with some of the Nabob’s people and were severely beaten by the latter. This little row soon assuming a formidable shape, troops were turned out on both sides, and a regular engagement ensued. Many men were kflled, and more were wounded. During the engagement Ad¬ miral Nicholson opened fire on the town, and upwards of five hundred houses were destroyed, including the Company’s godown, in which property worth thirty lacs of rupees was lost. The Fouzdar taking alarm, begged that hostilities might cease, to which the English agreed, on his assisting to convey their saltpetre on board their ships. Not only was this done, but their trade was allowed to continue until orders could be received from the Emperor. As soon as the Nabcfb heard of these events, he directed all the out-factories at Patna, Malda, Dacca and Kasim-bazar to be seized, and sent both infan¬ try and cavalry to Hooghly with the view of expelling the English from the country.

This favourable turn in their affairs was owing to the determination of the Court of Directors to carry every¬ thing by force. When the troubles in Bengal com¬ menced, the Court sent peremptory orders to their •Governor at Surat to close the Company’s factory, and to seize on every Mogul ship of war that could be found at sea, Now, Surat was the port whence pious Musalmans embarked on their pilgrimage to Mecca, and the chief business of the war-vessels was to protect the pilgrims during the voyage. As the English now guarded the harbour and commanded the sea, the way to Mecca was virtually closed ; and it was with a view to re-opening, it that the haughty Emperor condescended to accomodate matters with the English. Accordingly, on the 16th August 1687, a treaty was concluded, by which the English were permitted to set up factories in different parts of the Empire, and Uluberia* was given them, for magazine and docking purposes, while Mr. Charnock, on his part, engaged to return all the Mogul ships he had captured.

The Nabob, however, soon renewed his oppres¬ sions. He ordered the English to return to Hooghlyj and not to build either with stone or brick at Suta¬ nuti, at the same time allowing his soldiers to plunder them, and also demanding a large amount from Charnock, who had neither army to oppose his men nor rrioney to satisfy his demand. He, therefore, sent two of the members of his Council to Dacca, in the hope of conciliating the Nabob and obtaining leave- to continue at Sutanuti. After much difficulty these officers had just succeeded in their endeavours when the affairs of the English were again involved in still darker clouds. The Court of Directors, having heard of the engagement at Hooghly and the retreat of the troops to Hijli, had, with great promptitude, sent out re-inforcements under Captain Heath, with orders to take all their servants in Bengal and proceed to Madras, in case they failed to obtain what they desired, namely, a fort and a mint.* Heath was a hot-headed, inexperienced soldier, governed more by passion than by “ the pauser, reason.”f He arrived in Bengal in October, 1688, and ordered all the Company’s servants to embark with all the public * See Brace’s Annuls, vol.

When he had reached the Baleswar Roads, the Mahomedan officer of the town seized the Company’s factors there, and held them as pledges. But, though the two chief officials of the factory were now prisoners, and the two deputies were still in the power of the Nabob at Dacca, Ileath landed his troops at Baleswar on the 29th November, and, after plundering it of all “ goods and chattels/’ burnt it to ashes. Having thus ravaged the place, he sailed direct to Chittagong, but, failing to capture it, moved his fleet down towards Arracan. On his arrival there, he sent words to the King, offering to join him in attacking the Moguls, if he would permit the English to settle in his dominions. Not having received any reply for a fortninght, he became very impatient, and sailed towards Madras with the whole fleet, consisting of fifteen sail, on which were embarked the Governor, the Council, the Company’s servants and all their merchandise. Thus were the English settlements in Bengal wholly aban¬ doned about fifty years after their first establishment. As Bombay and Madras were well fortified, they were not touched ; but the Emperor ordered all the other factories of the English to be destroyed, and their goods to be seized throughout his Empire; and Shaista Khan was obliged to comply. He, accordingly, sequestered all the Company’s property in Bengal, and placed their two agents at Dacca in irons. c MINlSfy, <SL CHAPTER III Shova Singh’s Rebellion and the Marhatta Raids.

The English.had all along longed for a fort and a mint, but the jealousy of the Mogul officers had hitherto stood in the way of the fulfilment of their wish. In 1696, however, an event happened which enabled them to effect their purpose, at least to a certain extent.

After this horrible deed had been done by Krishna Ram, Shova Singh, with his army, entered the city, and, in the battle which ensued, defeated and killed him. Thus, his power extended over the whole of Burdwan. A beautiful maiden daughter of Krishna Ram, who, by a pure accident, had escaped from the slaughter committed by her father, fell into the hands of the victor, who, smitten with her personal charms, kept her as his mistress, little thinking that she was destined erelong to prove his murderer.

After Sliova Singh’s death, his son, or younger brother, Himmat Singh—for the accounts vary on this point—came up to Burdwau with a considerable army, and began to behave as unjustly as the deceased had done. As Ram Krishna had given shelter to the Burdwan Prince, Jagat Ram, Himmat sent a detachment of soldiers against him ; but they were repulsed with heavy loss. As long as Sliova Singh was alive, the Afghan, Rohim Khan, had acted as his deputy; but after his death the troops under his command elected him as their Chief, and he, to give dignity and importance to the office,, assumed the pompous name of Rohim Shah. The rebels daily extended the range of their depredations, and by March 1697 they had become very powerful, both in purse and possessions. In fact, by March 1697, their chief, Rohim Shah, had made himself master of all Bengal west of the Ganges, except the European Forts. The Governor, Ibrahim■ Khan, having failed to quell the rebellion, the Emperor’s grandson,* Azim Ushan, was appointed to succeed him on the Viceregal throne, and his own son, Zubburdast Khan, to take the military command.

The valiant exploits of Zubburdast Khan having excited the jealousy of the new Viceroy, the latter, who feared that there would be nothing left for him to do, ordered the victorious general not to risk another battle. Zubburdast plainly saw through the motive of Azim Ushan, and, accordingly, asked leave to resign the service, which was readily granted. He took away with him eight thousand soldiers, who were the flower of the Bengal army; and, when they departed, the province might have been considered as almost without defence. Azim Ushan came down to Burdwan, where he held his Court in right royal fashion, and received the congratulations* of the Rajahs and Zemindars. Rohim Shah despised this silken prince as much as he dreaded the iron Khan. He readily assembled his men, plundered Hooghly and Nadia, and approached within a few miles of Burdwan itself.

The rebels, seeing their Chief fall, dispersed in all directions. Azim Ushan continued some time at Burdwan. While staying at this historic city, he •caused to be constructed, at some distance to the north of Iiooghly, a Bazar to which lie gave the ■name of Shahgunge.* He likewise regulated the customs of the port of Hooghly at two-and-half per cent, for Mahomedans, five per cent, for Hindus, and three-and-half per cent, for Christians. The English, however, were exempted from this tax, as, according* to the Imperial firman of 1691, they had only to make an annual payment of Rs. 3000 in the lump. He was said also to have established the sayer, or internal duties, on articles passing from one place to another. In iyoof he formally transferred^ to the English the zemindari rights of the villages of Sutanuti, Calcutta and Govindapur.

Accord¬ ingly, a great many wealthy Hindus removed to Calcutta, where the English had made their new settlement. This naturally excited the jealousy of the Fouzdar, who threatened to place a Kazif in Calcutta, to administer justice according to the Mahomedan law. But the English made a hand¬ some present to Azim Ushan, and the Fouzdar was told to leave them alone. It was about this time that a rival East India ‘ Company, called the English Company, in contra¬ distinction to the old London Company, was established in England. The new Company sent agents all over India, and, among other places, to was Rs. 200 per mensem, and that of the latter Rs.30 only, which was eventually raised to Rs. 50.

When Mr. Hdwell was placed in charge of the Company’s Zemindari in 1762, Govindia Ram was compelled to retire.

But fresh difficulties were in store .for them, and it was not long before they presented themselves.

X Hamilton having, on being desired by the Emperor to name his reward, preferred the Company's interests to his own, the English in 1717 obtained the royal license for the purchase of thirty- eight villages in the vicinity of Calcutta. But this license they could not carry into effect, owing to the machinations of Murshid' Kuli Khan, who secret ly instigated the Zemindars of those villages not to sell them to the Company. Thus, for mofe than half a century, the three villages of Sutanuf.i, Calcutta ahd Govindpur continued to be the whole of the Company’s possessions in Bengal.

Shujah’s rule was one of peace and prosperity.

He also highly oppressed the Europeans settled in these parts ; yer, notwithstanding his very mal-administration, he had the address to obtain the Government of Behar and Orissa united with that of Bengal in his person, which ever before had been distinct and separate Nababships.” : J Mr Bolt, who is well known for his Considerations , was a Judge of the Mayor's Court at Calcutta. This Court, which consisted of a Mayor and nine Aldermen and in which the Governor presided, was superseded by the Supreme Court, with Sir Elijah Impey as its first Chief Justice. $ Some annoyance and jealousy was excited by the establishment of a Company, called the u Ostend East India Company,” who settkd themselves at Batiky-Bazar, a little below Chundernagore, but were finally driven out of the province in 1733.

The office of Fouzdar of Hooghly falling vacant, he gave it to his old domestic, Shu j,ah KuLi, in 1727. This officer having seized a boat laden with silk belonging to the English, the latter sent up a file of soldiers and released it ; and this being represented to the Nabob as a great affront, he issued an order forbidding the natives to supply Calcutta or the other factories with grain. In view of the inconvenience caused by this order, the English averted his displeasure with a large present. Their trade was greatly augmented during Shujah’s rule, but it was ill-managed, the Agents of the Company being too deeply engaged in trade on their own, account to pay sufficient attention to the interests of their masters. Shujah-uddin was succeeded, in 1739, by his son S.urferaz Khan ; but it was not long before the latter was defeated and slain at the battle of Gheriah,* by Aliverdi Khan, who, accordingly, ascended the throne.

Some time after, Zynuddin met Mustapha in battle, slew him, and dispersed his followers. The Nabob, on his part, fought several engagements with Raghuji with success. After tiie last battle, which took place at Kutwa, the latter fled to his own country. But the Marhattas, though repeatedly defeated, did not cease •to make incursions ; and the province of Orissa was still in their hands. The Nabob again gave them battle, and, beating them, returned to Murshidabad before the rains of 1748. A few days after, Zynuddin was murdered by the Afghans, Shumshere Khan and Sirdar Khan who had revolted from the Nabob. Haji Ahmed, the father of the murdered Governor, also shared the same fate. Again, the Marhattas invaded Bengal, but, again, they were repulsed. Siraj-ud-daula, son •of Zynuddin, was given his father’s place in Bihar, while Syed Ahmed, second son of Haji Ahmed, was appointed Fouzdar of Purneah. Sokut Jung, who •figured afterwards as a rival of Siraj-ud-daula, was the son of Syed Ahmed. IIOOGHIA PAST AND PRESENT. During the.

The moat is still in existence, though in a state of disrepair. Nabob Aliverdi concluded a treaty with the Marhattas in 1751. Thereafter they never appeared in his dominions, as they were quite satisfied with its terms. The cession of the large province of Orissaj was certainly a big sop. The Province had suffered much from their ravages, and the few remaining years of his life were spent by the old Nabob in repairing the damages. He died on the 9th April 1756. * More properly ‘ Bangshabati. ’ t This word seems to be another form of the Arabic word oagi, which means an insurgent, a rebel, a mutineer.

Finding a contest inevitable, that brave soldier determined to take the initiative, and, accordingly, marched to attack the enemy’s entrenchments. An engagement ensued in which the Nabob’s army was worsted, and he consented to a treaty which restored to the English all their privileges, and gave them ample compensation for their losses.* But this peace was only short-lived, and, as- matters stood, it could not have been otherwise. Siraj-ud-daula was at heart an enemy of the English* and, though his anger was stifled for a time, it was not altogether quenched, and an occasion now presented itself which stirred the hidden fire into a blaze. War having been declared between England and France, Clive rightly thought that Calcutta could not be safe while the French kept a large garrison at Chandernagore. Accordingly, in March, he attacked their settlement, and captured it after a nine days’ siege.f This proceeding incensed the * This treaty of oth February 1757 was signed by Admiral* Watson and Colonel Clive on the part of the English. t The English would have found great difficulty in capturing the place, had not Monsieur Terranueau, a French officer, owing to some injury, real or imaginary, received from Monsieur Renault, the Governor, gone over to Colonel Clive, and pointed out to the Admiral the narrow passage that had been left between the sunken vessels. Nanda Kumar, Fouzdar of Hooghly, had also been bought over by the English ; and he not only did not assist the French himself though repeatedly ordered by the Nabob to do so, but also dissuaded Rajah Doorlub Ram, who had been especially sent by the Nabob for the purpose, from doing it.

On the 5th day he reached Kutwa, and immediately captured the fort.
