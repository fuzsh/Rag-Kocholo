        "text": "Audio-Visual Room and Renaissance Resource Centre, Department of English, Jadavpur University\n\n14.00 – 16.30\n\n27.8.2013\n\nThe August session of the Reading Group Seminar was held in the Audio-Visual Room, Department of English, Jadavpur University on 27 August 2013, between 2 pm and 4 pm. Among the attendees were Professor Supriya Chaudhuri, Professor Sukanta Chaudhuri, Professor Swapan Chakravorty, Professor Monideep Chatterjee, Professor Subhrajit Das, Professor Neeta Das, Dr. Abhijit Gupta, Dr. Nilanjana Deb, Sarbajit Mitra, Somak Mukherjee, Rudrani Gangopadhyay, Ankita Chakrabarti, Sujaan Mukherjee, Arshdeep Singh Brar, and Pramantha Mohun Tagore. The meeting had been thrown open to the general student body as the first segment – lectures on the history, planning, archival resources, and spaces – would have been of interest to most students and researchers, irrespective of their direct engagement with the project.\n\nProfessor Supriya Chaudhuri opened the session with a brief introduction of the project for the benefit of those who were attending the RGS for the first time or aren’t involved in the project.\n\nProfessor Monideep Chatterjee had been asked to speak on the planning of the city of Calcutta. Professor Chatterjee began at the beginning, so to speak, and raised several questions about the origin of the city: what prompted Job Charnock to settle in the place that would grow into Calcutta; whether we can accept 24 August 1690 as the city’s birthday; which other towns in the vicinity could have risen to eminence instead of Calcutta. He mentioned the importance of cities like Saptagram that had come under Portuguese occupation in the sixteenth century, Chuchura (occupied by the Dutch in 1625), Chandannagar (French settlement in 1688), Srirampur (Danes, 1755), and Baranagar (Dutch factory established in 1658). Chandannagar, for instance, would perhaps have risen to greater importance had Napoleon been successful in the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nProfessor Chatterjee gave us a brief history of the establishment of the earliest institutions by the British in the area covered by the villages of Sutanuti, Gobindapur and Kalikata. The Old Fort William, where the General Post Office stands today, was built in 1696 by the English East India Company. It was after Siraj-ud-Daulah’s siege in 1756 that the British decided to build the new Fort William (where we see it today) and shift base to the Maidan. The area, Professor Chatterjee pointed out, comprised little more than three villages with a few creeks (commemorated in the name of the street, “Creek Row”), which connected them to the Salt Lakes. He referred to the earliest maps: Foresti and Ollifres, 1742 (“plan of Calcutta and the adjacent country, by Foresti and Ollifres”), William Wells, 1753 (“plan of Fort William, and part of the city of Calcutta, with a project for the fortifying the Fort, surveyed and drawn by William Wells, Lieutenant of the Artillery Company in Bengal, in the year 1753”)[i], which serve as an interesting series from which we can get a visual impression of the development of the city-space. The early visualizations reveal only one axis, the Pilgrim’s Road, going through Chitpur to Kalighat. The East-West axis is marked by “the Avenue”, which is now Bow Bazar Street. He referred also to the construction of the Maratha Ditch, which would later be filled in to form Upper and Lower Circular Road (now A.J.C. Bose Road and A.P.C. Roy Road).\n\nProfessor Chatterjee argued that the British resorted to Classical architecture for all of their centres of administration in Calcutta because they saw it as a display of power and grandeur. The GPO has Corinthian pillars, the Senate Hall Ionic, and the Governor’s House Doric. The Marble Palace (1835) of Raja Rajendra Mullick was an answer to this tradition, although the Palace itself takes attributes from Greek architecture while retaining the Indian facade of rooms on the four sides of a (sometimes there would be more than one) central courtyard. He also pointed out the importance of looking at diseases as factors influencing urban development, beginning with the mid-nineteenth century Fever Hospital Committee Reports, the establishment of the Calcutta Improvement Trust, right down to 1962 when WHO decided to establish a Cholera Research Centre in Calcutta – and the preparation of a development plan in 1966 by the Calcutta Metropolitan Planning Organization. He briefly touched upon the work of the Lottery Committee in building the C.R. Avenue, which served as another North-South axis, of the drastic demographic changes occurring with the Partition of Bengal, and the hopes of marking Calcutta in terms of urban region, similar to the National Capital Region which centres around New Delhi.\n\nProfessor Sukanta Chaudhuri opened with a warning against focusing so narrowly on our respective research interests that we forget the macro levels of urban development, and pointed out the importance of contextualizing events. Taking off from where Sri Monideep Chatterjee had left, he spoke about the port areas and their development, touching upon the rise of Garden Reach, originally a site for luxurious British villas, and Khidderpur, which is now a depressed port. He also noted the fallacy of equating physical growth and economic growth, and the possibility of an economic situation where a stoppage in physical growth can lead to better financial condition.\n\nProfessor Chaudhuri went on to speak on the unplanned development of Calcutta, and about the creation of roads such as B.K. Pal Avenue and Vivekananda Road, by the CIT, without which North Calcutta would have been choked by traffic. These efforts were rendered largely irrelevant as a result of the partition – by far the largest mass migration in recorded modern history. Prior to the partition the structure of the city comprised a ‘Black Town’ in the North and a ‘White Town’ in the Southern part, housing the centres of administration. Burrabazar served as the principal business centre. Comparing maps of the city before and after partition, Professor Chaudhuri demonstrated the expansion of the Calcutta Metropolitan area and the settlements that were formed along the river and on the outer fringes of the city. He observed the lack of communication mechanisms between the city of Calcutta and the municipalities that have grown, over time, along the river. Between the 1970s and ’90s several ‘secondary urban centres’ developed, creating new job opportunities around Calcutta. Professor Chaudhuri pointed out the failure to connect these centres by way of railway lines, and the virtual non-existence of an efficient network of roads.\n\nProfessor Subhrajit Das, who had been requested to speak on spaces in the city, commented on the inconsistencies that he finds, as an architect, in the urban development of the city: the arbitrariness of buildings, of footpath or park railings, of semi-permanent sheds. According to Professor Das, these add to the vibrancy of the city by not allowing a certain sterility that can be a result of extremely sanitized and planned city growth. He spoke of the various methods of creating space within the city, such as the umbrellas we use while walking, or the plastic sheds (or garden umbrellas) that mark the territory of hawkers on the pavements and streets, or the mosquito nets used by street-dwellers. Professor Das contested the claim that the city of Kolkata rarely opens on to the Hooghly river, by pointing out a number of ghats that allow one to do just that. He argued that one could find a similar feature in cities like Benares, where the view and physical traversal of space do not coincide, by which he meant that one might often have to take a meandering route to reach a point that is visually directly accessible. This, for him, is also directly connected with the ways of walking a city like Kolkata, where movement can rarely be in straight lines.\n\nThe availability of resources on urban history was the subject of Professor Swapan Chakravorty’s talk. He pointed out that we would be dealing with five or six kinds of documents, such as the printed books, maps, state records, manuscripts, photographs. He offered guidance on using the National Library and on how to access its various departments like the Maps and Prints Division and the Indian Official Documents section. The State Archives, he informed us, contain valuable resources on Armenians and Baghdadi Jews; and some of these reports may not be in English, Bengali or Hindi, and may require the services of a translator. Professor Chakravorty referred to two key publications celebrating the tercentenary of Calcutta – Calcutta: The Living City, in two volumes (ed. Sukanta Chaudhuri), and Calcutta Tercentenary Bibliography (ed. P. T. Nair), which is being brought out in revised form by the National Library of India (Kolkata) in two volumes, as Kolkata Heritage Bibliography. He gave us a list of key maps of the city of Calcutta, from the late 1700s to the early decades of the 20th century, including (among several others) the first Surveyor General’s map, the early 19th century road maps, 3 maps of the ports, and the map showing the earliest drainage plans. He informed us of the very useful catalogue of photographs of Kolkata available at the National Library, titled Index of Pictures on Calcutta (recently published by the National Library Employee’s Association), of the archives of the Victoria Memorial Hall, the Asiatic Society library, and the Calcutta Commercial Library.\n\nFollowing a brief question-answer session, the discussion was moved into the Renaissance Resource Centre, Department of English. Students working on the project spoke of directions their research are taking. Dr Neeta Das, who was present through out, offered some valuable insights into what goes on behind the restoration of old buildings. She has worked on a number of prestigious projects herself and continues to do so. She offered her help in our understanding of colonial architecture. Professor Subhrajit Das suggested that he could ask some of his students to accompany students working on the project to help them understand ground plans and draw them, if necessary. Dr Neeta Das also suggested possible ways of accessing and studying the work of Patrick Geddes, especially with relation to the Burrabazar area.\n\nProfessor Supriya Chaudhuri suggested that we decide on the areas we will be focusing on at the moment. The areas chosen for now are the bazars of Calcutta, the port area, the Chitpur road stretch, the Portuguese Church area, the College Street book-market and Cornwallis Street, and the Maidan. In the light of the talks delivered earlier, the methodology to be followed was briefly revised. Students have been asked to submit or present progress reports at the next RGS, which is in October. A fairly large body of essays and texts has also been circulated via Dropbox among the group-members, and a few maps ranging between the mid-1700s and 1900 have been uploaded as well.\n\n[i] Catalogue of the Manuscript Maps, Charts, and Plans, and of the Topographical Drawings in the British Museum, Vol. III (London: The Trustees of the British Museum, 1962), 359. The National Library of India, Calcutta, has several eighteenth and nineteenth century maps in its ‘Maps and Prints Division’.\n\nFriday 13th September 2013\n\nThe ETIC research group at University of Liverpool was thrilled to be a part of Centre for Port and Maritime History Annual Conference on ‘The “Otherness” of Port Cities’. Held at Blackburne House, a former shipowner’s mansion, the group comprising Dr Ian Magedera, Professor Nandini Das, Dr Iain Jackson and Cleo Roberts, held a roundtable discussion from 10.45am-12.15pm. The focus of the roundtable was ‘Envisioning the Indian Port City as a Space for Colonial Encounter’. The session showcased the cities of Goa, Pondicherry and Kolkata.\n\nHosted by the Centre for Port and Maritime History, the day commenced with a welcome address from Professor Andrew Popp. The Thursday 12th September had been a fruitful day with an array of papers given by Paul van de Laar, Sheryllynne Haggerty and Derek Janes amongst others. The presentations had created interesting exchanges, which were to be continued throughout day two.\n\nDr Kirsty Hooper (University of Warwick) opened with her paper, ‘Otherness on Display: Traces of Hispanic Presence in Liverpool’s Museums’. The work analysed the Global City gallery in the Museum of Liverpool and its role in presentations of otherness. Framed by the notion of ‘global’, Hooper explored the artefacts as having a duplicity of locations: coded as being both Hispanic and global. The paper scrutinised the role of the museum and curatorial prerogative. Dr Hooper questioned how the different stakeholders involved, such as Barclay’s Wealth, affect curatorial agency? Which objects get privileged and how do these weave a narrative of imperialism? The paper concluded that the Museum articulated a binary conception of the Hispanic presence in Liverpool, providing no space for the entangled histories to become apparent.\n\nDr Guadalupe Garcia, (Tulane University) presented on the port city of Havana, ‘Havana in the Early Spanish Empire’. Her paper discussed the changing nature of walls in the city and their relationship to the production of urban space. Given the porous nature of ports rendering them pervious to colonial attack, Dr Garcia spoke of walls as structures of fear. Built to fortify the city against the dangers of the port, the presence of these physical boundaries was symbolic of anxiety in the pre-colonial era. Their subsequent decimation by the Spanish in 1863 was read as a metaphor for the colonial project.\n\nDr John Schofield (University of York) detailed his research on Strait Street (‘The Gut’) in Malta. His photographs and collected stories from the site intended to showcase the rich heritage of this isolated street that remains omitted from tourist maps and literature. The discomfort associated with its past excesses has created a dead space without flow, a stasis of peeling paint and faded signage. Dr Schofield spoke of his recent publication and the desire to excavate the memories and rejuvenate the headiness and exuberant past life.\n\nA buoyant Q&A followed. Questions of responsible curation and preservation were amongst the topics discussed. The critique of display by museums moved into discussions about their purpose. Attention was drawn to pragmatic considerations involved in presenting objects and interpretations for a diverse demographic.\n\nThe ETIC roundtable was met with considerable enthusiasm and interest. Professor Popp introduced the project and expressed thanks for being included in the inaugural Liverpool reading group. Dr Ian Magedera (University of Liverpool) introduced the speakers and spoke of the joint nature of the work with Jadavpur University across the four cities.\n\nProfessor Nandini Das (University of Liverpool) presented her research on Portuguese Goa in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. She introduced her work by speaking of the arrival and subsequent arresting of a group of Englishmen in Goa in 1583. Their bail by Padre Estavam and Jan van Linschoten allowed for the start of formal contact between England and India. This research demonstrated the transitional nature of loyalties in these fluid port cities making them a unique urban space and site of great interest for the ETIC project.\n\nThrough a series of projected slides, Professor Das introduced a number of images charting the fortification of Goa’s identity as Portuguese. The visual representations of Goa and administrative policies aligned the city with Portuguese counterparts such as Lisbon and Malacca. She emphasised that her research was making evident the memories of elsewhere that become embedded in the port-city. Reading an extract from Italo Calvino’s ‘Invisible Cities’ (1972), she concluded that tracking networks of memories combined with flows of global traffic might provide an entry point to the ‘otherness’ of the port city.\n\nDr Iain Jackson (University of Liverpool) presented his work on ‘Calcutta: The growth of an Indian Port City as depicted by British visitors from 18th-20th century’. Using the collections of the British Library and British Museum, Dr Jackson demonstrated a particular envisioning of the port city. Presenting a slideshow, he spoke about UK perceptions of Calcutta mitigated through engravings, lithograph and photography.\n\nDr Jackson drew attention to the dismissal of the ports, river and docks in early visual sources hypothesising these would have been deemed too vulgar and commonplace for the imagined city the East India Company wished to export. He spoke of the gradual emergence of the river in paintings and etchings towards the end of the 18th century. Introducing engravings by James Moffat, he commented on the stylisation of the river as a sleepy backwater lapping at the banks of mansions and palaces.\n\nThe lack of local presence in these images prior to 1840 was notable. Dr Jackson went on to show a painting by Charles D’Oyly (1848) depicting the Hooghly river as an activated space. He commented on the customs house replacing the Fort as the principle threshold and the flows of people and goods represented below the overexpansive skies. Other renderings of the time enforce the conception of the city growing out of the river. Dr Jackson concluded with a series of future research themes including cultural and artisitic timelags in the city’s representation and exploring the different genres of image making.\n\nDr Ian Magedera spoke on ‘’Portless’ Pondicherry 1899, a Contrarian Approach to the Port City in India’. Excerpts from Pierre Loti’s, ‘L’Inde (sans les Anglais)’ (1899-1901) were utilised to discuss the city’s isolation due to the absence of a port. Dr Magedera commented on Loti’s characteristation of the city as, ‘An old little town which lasts on account of tradition’. The discussion of the rich text focused on the contrasts built between the French colony and British India. Loti’s representation was said to situate Pondicherry as a slow, antiquated city; a chasm of melancholic nostalgia against the fast optimism of British India. The absence of sailing ships juxtaposed the statuesque steamships in the Calcutta Dock images from Dr Jackson. Dr Magedera spoke of the extended metaphor of ships to describe the columns of the Statue de Dupleix and the city overall as an old sailing ship. He discerned that this sense of slowness remains citing the current Tourist Office slogan, ‘Pondicherry. Give time a break’.\n\nCleo Roberts concluded with her work on ‘Waterscapes and Urbanism: visual representations of blue gold in Indian cities’. Approaching the city from the perspective of the water she spoke about the power relations that texture and are textured by this body as discussed by Professor Erik Swyngedouw (2004). Showcasing her initial research, Roberts used three images featuring waterscapes created by European males to discuss the recording of the port city of Calcutta.\n\nThe array of images were said to be revealing of a cultural attitude. Presenting an extract and photograph from Eric Newby’s ‘Slowly Down the Ganges’ (1966) against an image and instruction text from William Sallis’s Dioramic Game of the Overland Route to India (1852-1863), Roberts commented on the continuity of representation of Calcutta through the flows of water. The apotheosis of the East India Company in the painting, ‘The East offering its riches to Britannia’ (1778), was of interest for the lack of geographical marker. Roberts spoke about the duplicity of water flowing from the urn of Father Thames and sitting thickly between the figures.\n\nFollowing the presentation there was interest in the subject of flows of information between the Indian and Liverpool research teams. It was noted that over the course of the conference there had been little emphasis placed on port cities from the perspective of water. The audience were keen to hear about the progress of the project and the collaboration across the network.\n\nHousing in Chandigarh\n\nNostalgia – (coined in 1668 by Johannes Hefer), from Greek algos, “pain, grief, distress + nostos, homecoming\n\nPart I\n\nPhoto 1. The Red Brick House, Sector 9.\n\nLet me welcome you to gaze/or intrusively look into a house in Sector 9, one of the first original sectors of Chandigarh’s master plan. Its design consists of stark horizontal lines, flat, single story roof, the entrance protected from the sun by a white cover. The red paint or brick is marked by black water dribble marks at the end. Two small windows are visible and a narrow entrance door seems hidden in the shadows. The gate sags at the hinges. The low red brick wall exposes the house to the gaze of passers by like me on the road. Typically, a few distinct shrubs frame the driveway, while we can also catch a shadow of a small palm tree. Unpretentious, simple lines, a bare bones aesthetic concept of a house with windows and a door, this is the spirit of the early decades of Chandigarh. The house could be dated to the 1970s, possibly a bit earlier, not likely after the early1980s, which marked a watershed in the emergence of ‘new money’ in the city.\n\nSector 9 has been the home of our extended family since the mid 1960s when my grandparents built a similar 1-story, utilitarian house, as we anecdotally hear, depending more on the contractors, who had the house built than on an architect with a distinct aesthetic vision. The house, on which a second unit was added in the 1970s, included a room created out of a front porch and an extra room added on the ground floor. Some of these additions were made by my parents for their family in the mid 1970s. The house is still drafty and cold in winter, with pinched, narrow windows that make it somewhat stifling in summer. At some point it will be demolished and sold, as part of the family will. In its place will arise a new, grandiose structure, since Sector 9 is one of the most affluent areas.\n\nPhoto 2. Family Home, Sector 9 Front garden\n\nWhat is stunning however in our somewhat faded family house, and typical of all of the Chandigarh aesthetic, especially in the old, original sectors, is the garden in any season, with profusions of potted flowers, a small vegetable garden, with bougainvillea on the ledges, though the fruit trees, lychees, lemons, mangoes seem to have had their day. See photo 2 of front lawn of the house. Other houses in sector 9 of the same vintage (roughly) depict a similar aesthetic, straight lines, some second story rooms, an open terrace upstairs (called kotha) where through the 1970s families may have slept out doors in an era when air conditioning was not commonplace. See photo 3.\n\nPhoto 3. Another house -probably 1970s (sector-9)\n\nPhoto 4. Same vintage, with the 2nd floor probably an add-on\n\nAesthetic effects, or refreshing vistas were found in the greenery, shrubs, trees, and flowers that graced the whole sector 9. A common practice that persists even today is to plant flowers or greenery outside the boundary wall of your house. See photos 5 and 6. Petunias, sweet peas straggling along the wall and a bougainvillea drooping from the other side. Another feature that continues as a part of the original plan is a green space between inner streets. Here is a lovely long space with a bench close to our family home (photo 5). Sometimes kids play cricket here or people sit on benches. In the pre-television era (or shall I say pre-cable era till the mid 1980s) one saw more kids out doors; all of India draws kids to TV and other electronic screens now.\n\nPhoto 5.

Facing another house 1970s\n\nPhoto 6 A classic Chandigarh garden aesthetic,especially in the older sectors, some floral landscaping outside the house wall (all homes have clearly demarcated walls) here petunias, sweet peas, with bougainvillea flowing over the hedge\n\nWhy am I praising these somewhat non-descript functional houses that dot Sector 9? Starkly simple, utilitarian, undecorated homes dominated this sector until the mid 1980s at least. Is it because these old houses and the childhood world I recall, evokes in me a nostalgia, even somewhat forced, not for some idyll, but for the stark simplicity of Chandigarh life in the original sectors. Nostalgia implies a combined feeling of homecoming and loss and perhaps that is what Sector 9 stirs in me, especially as given the trend, the older vintage (1970s and before) of homes will be gone completely in a few years. As prices are determined by the location of the land, older homes are inevitably demolished as new owners take them over. However, ironically many of the new elaborately decorated and stylized houses commodify a nostalgia for cultural images of the past, often opulent, randomly evoked from coats of arms or haveli style balconies. A vivid example of one such house in Chandigarh Sector 9 is the “House of Lions” or as all the Punjabi denizens call it, “Sheran Wala Ghar.”\n\nII\n\nThe House of Lions\n\nPhoto 7. The House of Lions: New Housing in Chandigarh\n\nPhoto 8. The House of Lions: New Housing in Chandigarh\n\nPhoto 9. The House of Lions, boundary wall.\n\nThis house is difficult to miss (see photos)! It has an ornate black gate with a golden coat of arms emblem on each gate, the color palette is black on the gate and boundary wall, and a nice cornflower yellow colours the walls of the house. On the gateposts two concrete statues of Lions strike a bold note. The name of the owner is followed by the word, “Niwas,” which means habitation and evokes a class-inflected dignity. It is not simply a house, “ghar.” The house itself behind the self-aggrandizing gate certainly has a kind of elegance, one rounded balcony reminiscent of similar facades old “havelis” and nice symmetry of rounded arches, one in mottled black marble, and matching angular roofs, a range of varied lines, angles, textures, and materials that make up this house. If you walk around, small concrete peacocks are perched on the side walls. Overall though, the house is not garish or overwrought like many other “Punjabi Baroque” styles in the newly moneyed sections of Chandigarh. However, one can’t help think of the usage of self-minted family “arms” on the gate as a kind of commodified nostalgia for some aristocratic antecedents.\n\nOn asking around among other old families of the neighborhood (all the old families of sector 9 know each other) no one seems to know the owners of the Lion House, though from the last name they could assume some Punjabi landowning family, and otherwise possibly NRI money made in Canada or UK. (Wealthy Punjabi immigrants from these two countries have come back home all over Punjab and invested in fancy homes). That sense of anonymity or mystery seems to be typical of most of the homeowners of the houses built in the past two decades; some of them seem to be absentee denizens of Sector 9. See other Punjabi baroque houses photos 10-11 similar circular balconies (“jharoka style of the old havelis) shut high gates, palm trees, and decorative trim, evoking some kind of emblem or arms.\n\nPhoto 10. Recent Balcony evokes “Jharoka” from India Haveli style\n\nPhoto 11. Recent housing — another Balcony, Gold trim, “Punjabi Baroque”\n\nPhoto 12. Housing in Chandigarh from 1990s\n\nOne house (photo 12) of more recent years is quite striking, red brick, straight lines, reminiscent of the Corbusier aesthetic, with a modernist brick motif (in the style of the Chandigarh logo of the hand). What is also noticeable in this photo are the number of expensive looking cars parked in the drive-way. It is also a signal of new money, but with some restrained individualistic taste.\n\nCars proliferate in Sector 9 in all the houses, it seems, but what seems to distinguish the old and new are the high gates, walls, and sense of closed-in space, surrounded by high trees, and often security guards (excluded in the photos). So what may seem like signs of affluence and progress that are breathing new vitality into Sector 9 –and into the whole of Chandigarh with its growth into the Tri-City, new hotels, restaurants, a big shopping Malls, colleges, etc. also mark the end of a culture prior to consumerist-driven lifestyles of today. The world of the 1970s through the 1980s was caught up in India’s controlled, earlier pseudo-socialist economy, where a dependence on State funding was central to our lives. So in that era Chandigarh was a city of civil servants, educators, a few businesses, restricted access to consumer goods, even for the wealthy, and few “choices” in consumption of any kind. Bicycles proliferated as even the upper class kids biked everywhere. Few restaurant options were available, but there was a decent public library in Sector 9, with a wonderful Children’s section. The Rose Garden was the big attraction for city dwellers, and blooming gardens in the leisure valley and the University Campus were topics of conversation. The three movie theatres offered crude comforts, very weak air-conditioning if any, sometimes damaged film stock, inexpert screenings, and a selection of latest and re-run Bombay films (as they were called then). On weekends, we went to see the Hollywood offerings, often few years old.\n\nPhoto 13. Masterplan of Chandigarh is cast into the manhole covers\n\nSomehow despite familiar critiques of the Corbusier plan’s divisions into class-based sectors and on the bureaucratic atmosphere of the Chandigarh, what I remember are the associations between a stark, pragmatic architectural style, both of the Corbusier master plan and of the red house with a sagging gate in Sector 9. (See photo of the Corbusier Master plan cast onto the manhole covers in photo 13.) We never felt the “presence” of money until houses like the one with Lions appeared! Our consciousness as citizens and subjects of India was somewhat nationalistic but cynical about a government that did not seem to be moving India progressively ahead. However, what I value most of my years in Chandigarh is remembering a city of clean lines, gardens, trees, outdoor life on bicycles and walks, or motorbike rides, and little aspiration that endless wealth and consumer goods would make lives happier…\n\nPhoto 14. A Lovely Lady of Sector 9 with her garden as a backdrop in one of the older houses — “the trees are now quite a jungle” she observes\n\nProfessor Jyotsna G. Singh, Department of English\n\nMichigan State University\n\njsingh@msu.edu\n\nAudio-Visual Room, Department of English, Jadavpur University\n\n14.00 -16.00\n\n26.6.2013\n\nJadavpur University, Department of English, hosted the June session of the Reading Group Seminar for the “Envisioning the Indian City” project. It was held on the 27th of June, 2013, 2 pm onwards in the departmental Audio-Visual Room. Among those attending were Professor Supriya Chaudhuri, Professor Amlan Das Gupta, Professor Shubhrajit Das, Dr Abhijit Gupta, Sohini Banerjee, Sarbajaya Bhattacharya, Arshdeep Singh Brar, Pramantha Mohun Tagore, and Ankita Chakrabarti.\n\nThe meeting began with a brief recapitulation of the proceedings of the previous Reading Group Seminars. The work that has been accomplished thus far by the outgoing Post-Graduate research group, in conjunction with their Post-Colonial Studies course, was discussed. Newcomers to the group were given updates on the strands of research that have been considered, and on the basic aims of the project in the long run.\n\nThe Reading Group discussions were initiated by Professor Supriya Chaudhuri who introduced Rev. James Long’s book, Calcutta in the Olden Times: Its Localities and its Peoples. Dr Abhijit Gupta led the discussion. Divided into two long chapters, the book serves not just as an interesting record of, as the subtitle suggests, the places, spaces, and localities within the city and the various coexisting social groups of the time, but also as a record of Long’s unique research methodology and ethnography. Interestingly, the essay published originally in the Calcutta Review, Vol. XVIII in 1852, strikes a nostalgic note, as if the author makes it his goal to record for future generations an already disappearing view of the city. Long’s method of urban-reading seems to be one based on comparisons with European cities: he sees the city-scape changing, as it were, from resembling St Petersburg to resembling London. It cites several older publications that are now relatively more difficult to access, and often explains in footnotes to the ‘non-native’ reader anecdotes and ethnographic details that may appear incredible. A digital copy of the book has subsequently been made available online, for sharing among the group members.\n\nSarbajaya Bhattacharya and Sohini Banerjee screened the documentaries they had put together with brief introductions. Sarbajaya has been interested in indoor games within the city in literature from the 19th-20th century period and beyond. Her work so far has focused mainly on the games played by women, and how in literature and, later, in films depicting the period, they have been seen as a site of colonial encounter. While akharas (wrestling rings) were proliferating in the city and nationalist discourse was tied up with masculinity, the andarmahal (inner quarters of a house) and its activities serve as sites of resistance. In her documentary Sarbajaya turns to the streets of Kolkata where we find games being played in small huddles all through the city. Many of them belong to sports clubs that were formed in the city around the 1950s by the inhabitants of refugee colonies, who had been displaced from Bangladesh, and were looking to solidify their identities. The card games played are mostly of foreign origin, the Indian indigenous games all but forgotten. Besides card-games, members also use the facilities available at these clubs for physical exercise. Her work promises to extend itself to a comparative study of colonial and, so to speak, post-colonial club cultures: the Calcutta Club or the Dalhousie Institute on the one hand, and the Bengal Club or the smaller post-independence clubs like the ones she addresses in her documentary and paper.\n\nSohini Banerjee’s documentary, “The Cultural Production of Urban Space”, was a look at Sir Stuart Hogg’s New Market as a space of colonial encounter. Designed and built in the 1870s, the market was intended exclusively for the English. Interviews with people who have been associated with the market through generations revealed changes that had (or had not) come about with time. Opinions differed among the persons interviewed on various topics, ranging from comfort in trading matters to changes in clientele. Negotiations with the architecture of the market also differed from trader to trader. Sohini’s documentary focused, for instance, on difficulties faced by meat-market merchants in terms of sanitation and disintegrating walls and roofs. The silver-merchant, Mr V. Gulab commented on the aspects of natural lighting within the market building and the use of electric or backlit shop signs, as opposed to the old-fashioned beveled or relief sign-boards. Much of the footage Sohini had captured could not however be fitted within the scope of the documentary.\n\nThe screenings were followed by an interactive session, in which their work was discussed at length both in terms of their cinematic quality and contents. Professor Amlan Das Gupta suggested that we could profitably look other markets as well, which may or may not have been constructed by the British. He also suggested that we look at architecture of these markets as possible sites of colonial encounter – and extend that to studies of the architecture of public buildings. He also spoke about the architecture of the Calcutta High Court, which shows Gothic influences and has a remarkable history.\n\nThe final presentation for the day was a “photo-essay” by Pramantha M. Tagore (presently in PG I), who has been working on patrons of classical music among the families of North Calcutta, centering especially on the Pathuriaghata area. His presentation titled “Centers of Patronage” covered the career of Bhupendra Krishna Ghosh, who had remained an influential patron of the arts between the 1890s and the 1930s. Among other things, he was also responsible for the inauguration of the All Bengal Music Conference in 1934, a project which did its bit to democratize classical music in the city. It was revived five years back on its 75th anniversary.\n\nArshdeep Singh Brar spoke on his area of interest, that is, the Barabazar area. Professor Supriya Chaudhuri suggested that we follow up on the work of Patrick Geddes, whose plan for the improvement of Barabazar, drawn in 1919, had contributed significantly to the area’s development. Arshdeep’s research interest lies in the exploration of the changing market scenario with new constructions coming up. Ankita Chakrabarti also pitched her idea of working on a history of the schools that were set up by the English for English education in Calcutta.\n\n(This report was compiled from notes made by Arshdeep Singh Brar)"
