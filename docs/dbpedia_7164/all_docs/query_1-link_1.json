        "text": "Hugli, city, central West Bengal state, northeastern India. The city lies just west of the Hugli (Hooghly) River and is a major road and rail connection. Rice milling and rubber-goods manufacture are the chief industries.\n\nHooghly (now Hugli) was founded by the Portuguese in 1537 following the decline of Satgaon, the mercantile capital of Lower Bengal. Mughal armies expelled the Portuguese from Hooghly in 1632. Hooghly was also the first English settlement (1651) in Lower Bengal; it was abandoned in 1690 for Calcutta (now Kolkata).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nExplore India Quiz\n\nChinsurah was an important 17th-century settlement of the Dutch, who built a factory (trading station) there in 1656. In 1825 Chinsurah and other Dutch settlements were ceded to the British in exchange for holdings in Sumatra (Indonesia). Important historical buildings include a Muslim imām-baṛah (meeting place), a Portuguese church (1660), and the Sandeshwar temple."
