        "text": "A large number of anonymous oils on religious and mythological themes began to emerge in Bengal in the late eighteenth–early nineteenth century from the French colony of Chandernagore and the Dutch colony of Chinsurah.\n\nVariously called French or Dutch Bengal oils, they also came from other areas like Chitpur and Garanhata localities of Calcutta and thus came to be known as Early Bengal Oils.\n\nPainted in indigenous styles on religious themes of the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Krishna legend, other gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon, or popular myths and legends, these were unsigned and undated paintings. Following an indigenous painting idiom, the choice of iconography and colour palette was local—often considered strong or garish—but borrowed the Western technique of applying rich oils.\n\nThe artists evolved their own solutions to issues of perspective and volume, and incorporated other elements of European salon art of the time, such as drapery and backdrop of studio settings, also revealing the influence of contemporary Calcutta art schools.\n\nPatronised by the urban elite, the genre began to suffer a decline by the late nineteenth–early twentieth century with the availability of cheaper and easily available lithographs and woodcuts on the same themes, oleographs from the newly established presses, and the increasing popularity of academic realist oils."
