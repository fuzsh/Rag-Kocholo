Together they form a uniquely rich heritage corridor which is only now sporadically becoming the focus of national and individual international heritage initiatives. When it ends in 2021, across all five cities, heritage activists will be upskilled to international standards in the documentation and promotion of both tangible and intangible heritage.\n\nThe 30-strong group of Team members and their associates collaborate with citizens in the region to co-create a diverse toolkit of cultural documentation including a substantive Heritage Management Strategy, an hour-long documentary film, architectural drawings, a postcard book, a photographic exhibition, recorded eyewitness testimony, an augmented reality App, all underpinned by academic research and directed at securing funds for preservation and access based on mutual consent and for the benefit the greatest number of sectors in civil society. For example, this allows project heritage activists and owner-custodians of the grand houses of Hugli to ‘talk heritage’ with nationally and internationally accredited documentation and visuals in the local Bengali language (and in English and French) to private sector interests and to the local and national government. The same applies to educators from a wide range of schools in the region as well as those involved in creative industries such as artists and filmmakers.\n\nThe Hugli is a branch of the Ganges and a major navigable river flowing from the foothills of the Himalayas into the Bay of Bengal. On its lower reaches lies the megacity of Kolkata. This project focuses on five rapidly changing hinterland cities, southwards downstream towards Kolkata: Bandel, Chinsurah, Chandannagar, Serampore, and Barrackpore.\n\nThe two-year Hugli Rivers of Culture project responds to a heritage emergency in a corridor of five towns upriver from the 14m-strong megacity of Kolkata. The public spaces and buildings of these towns have traces of the presence of Danish, Dutch, Portuguese, British and French trade and martial control since the Portuguese settlement in the early 1600s, but the project aims to help burgeoning grassroots volunteer groups better understand and promote C20 Indian-European hybrid domestic architecture, contemporary cultural practices, and memory now at extreme risk due to India’s rapid urbanisation. The goal is not to preserve these in aspic, but to work with the people in these places to adapt and use them for their own purposes. The twelve project outputs include a heritage management strategy (with colleagues in Architecture) and a Hugli Heritage Day (with colleagues at the Ironbridge International Institute for Cultural Heritage, Birmingham, and in Architecture and Geography at the University of Liverpool). The project is funded by the Newton Fund/GCRF and administered by the AHRC.\n\nThe focus of this project is the five former trading posts and garrison settlements up the Hugli River from the megacity of Kolkata. From upriver in the North towards Kolkata in the South they are: Bandel established by the Portuguese in the 1660s, Chinsurah developed by the Dutch in 1650s, Chandannagar founded by the French in the 1670s, Serampore urbanised by the Danes in the 1750s and Barrackpore developed by the British in the 1770s. Together they form a uniquely rich heritage corridor which is only now sporadically becoming the focus of national and individual international heritage initiatives.\n\nOwner-custodians of major domestic heritage buildings will have their properties documented as will the citizens participating in the annual festivals. A focused Heritage Management Strategy will be disseminated. Thus there will be a careful combination of resource enhancement and the building of human capital by knowledge exchange across the 5 riverside Hugli cities. Just as the Research Assistants and heritage activists have a proven track record in volunteering, the resources enhanced have been visited by the UK PI Magedera and CI Jackson and the area was the birthplace of the CI Banyopadhyay. The project team thus document sociologically and architecturally for the first time both the hybrid European-Indian style of the riverside mansions in the region such as those in Gondalpara. Further, it will use boat-borne exhibitions and symposia on the river to revitalise the Hugli as a connective conduit to empower owner-custodians and heritage activists from Bandel in the North to Barrackpore in the South. Building trust with owner-custodians via an informal network over the project’s three-year life span from 2018, the team members would collaboratively produce a diverse toolkit of cultural documentation including a substantive Heritage Management Strategy, an hour-long documentary film, architectural drawings, a postcard book, a photographic exhibition, recorded eyewitness testimony, an augmented reality App, all underpinned by academic research. This will allow the Hugli heritage activists and owner-custodians to ‘talk heritage’ with nationally and internationally accredited documentation and visuals in the local Bengali language (and in English and French) to private sector interests and to the local and national government. This confidence will be centred around two new annual Hugli Heritage Days – ‘Huglir Oitijhyo Dibos’. The first two heritage days will be supported within the lifetime of the project. The impact of the second heritage day involving all five threshold towns will be maximized by the sharing with Indian activists and researchers of the project team’s documentation of the role of the mobile architecture of the ‘floats’ and their immersion in the river at the climax of the festival as well as their analysis of Jagadhatri Puja, a two-week-long devotional festival in Hugli involving hundreds of thousands of people (similar in regional impact to the Rio Carnival, but not internationally known), which is tied to the river via the immersion of huge mobile as it shifts the cultural centre of gravity from the core in metropolitan Kolkata to the periphery of the Hugli corridor every year in October/November.\n\nPlanned Impact\n\nThe Hugli River of Cultures Pilot Project is constructed with a series of internal feedback loops and ongoing self-documentation. The loops are marked by the milestones of the meetings in February and March 2018, the land-based exhibition in April and the river-borne meetings and exhibition in May and June 2018, and the river-borne meeting in July 2018. They ensure that the project has assessed the heritage needs, not only of the heritage activists and the owner custodians but also of a wide range of interested citizens, with whom the former will have engaged during the public outreach events such as the land-based exhibition. Their aim of this is to integrate the civil society users of the research (the owner-custodians, heritage activists third sector organisations such as The Friends of Chandanagor [sic] Heritage based at the Rash Behari Research Institute and led by Kalyan Chakrabortti into the project outcomes on an ongoing basis). Aided by the members of the UK and India project team, the Hugli civil society participants will benefit by taking part in an experiential project which allows them up-skill and to view the mansions and their city and the wider riverside region in a new way, appreciating its unique built and event-based heritage as their plan and execute a new heritage event of their own supported by the Indian and UK project team members. Furthermore, the Chandannagar members are facilitated from May 2018 to cooperate with their counterparts in the other cities, these counterparts have been identified but they are currently working sporadically or alone or both. A key feature of this project is, therefore, to change this via the non-academic project outputs to impactful co-ordinated working which will represent a gain via cultural heritage for all interested citizens across the five cities. Apart from fishermen and the occasional tourist boats, the Indian public does not generally venture out onto the river and the A to B ferries take the shortest and most direct route across. The change in perspective of seeing their cities from the river is a watershed moment which re-establishes a participative connection with the sacred that is part of the way that many heritage activists and owner-custodians view the Hugli which is part of the Ganga (Ganges), but which is not yet linked to heritage.\n\nPeople\n\nIan Magedera (Principal Investigator)\n\nAndrew Davies (Co-Investigator)\n\nSoumyen Bandyopadhyay (Co-Investigator)\n\nHelle Jorgensen (Co-Investigator)\n\nIain Jackson (Co-Investigator)\n\nWe have:\n\nidentified key heritage precincts and cultural landscapes with buildings and streetscapes and river frontage for each of the five cities\n\nstarted to document these\n\nincreased public awareness in term of elected politicians, teachers, students, owner custodians\n\nupskilled heritage activists\n\npublished a 256-page bilingual book on heritage and distributed it free to 150+ school and college students and their teachers\n\nheld photographic exhibitions to the general public to demonstrate the value of heritage\n\nengaged with the regional level city and town planners to canvas their opinions on the feasibility of a Hugli Heritage Management Strategy\n\ndeveloped and launched the Hugli River AR App\n\norganised two Hugli Heritage Days in a Heritage Properties\n\nengaged with the French Consul for Calcutta\n\nfilmed seven hours of footage for a docudrama on intangible cultural heritage in the region\n\nexceeded our original objectives because of the engagement of 25 locally based academic project volunteers. Local buy-in needs to be proven before impact heavy awards\n\ncommunities and Social Services/Policy, Creative Economy, Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software), Education, Environment, Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism, Government, Democracy and Justice, Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections\n\nCollaborations\n\nThe project has collaborated closely with one of the most active heritage preservations in India, the Pondicherry Chapter of the Indian National Trust for Arts and Cultural Heritage (INTACH). Their Co-convenor and senior architect have been able to give practical advice to owner-custodians of grand houses, many of which are domestic heritage in danger.\n\nThe project has also benefitted greatly from the expertise of local NGOs such as Chandernagor Heritage and leading conservation architectural practices such as Aishwarya Tipnis Architects, New Delhi.\n\nRecent activities\n\nThe project has delivered a series of impact activities for different constituencies such as owner-custodian meetings, a public photographic exhibition, a planners’ round table at the British Council in Kolkata, and a river symposium for NGOs and local activists.\n\nThe project is also proud to have provided the resources, documentation and training to its young heritage activists to allow them to deliver heritage walks. The recent project HeritageFest, consisting of quizzes, drawing competitions, interactive lectures and debates for students and their teachers, saw a project book distributed free-of-charge to all participants. The event was extensively covered in the local and regional press in both Bengali and English.\n\nFunding\n\nWork on this project first started on 14 February 2018 with an AHRC/Newton/GCRF Major Award and is being taken further thanks to a GCRF Global Impact Accelerator grant awarded in November 2018 and Follow-On funding from January 2020\n\nPublications\n\nAntara Mukherjee (ed) Chandernagore mon amour: the Citadel of the Moon (Liverpool: Liverpool University, 2018), 259 pp.\n\nThis bilingual English/Bengali collection of essays by project members and invited specialists provides new interpretations of Chandernagore’s tangible built heritage, and its intangible cultural heritage from pre-colonial, through colonial and onto post-colonial times. The book is richly illustrated with original colour and black & white photographs and contains a timeline and links to digital resources such as photostories.\n\nOur Principles\n\nFollow-on Funding: Implementation Action Team (IAT)\n\nFollow-on Funding in 2019, the project team and the Principal Investigator were successful in a competition open to all previous GCRF and Newton Grant holders in the UK to gain Follow-On Funding that enables them to continue to apply for a whole additional year, the project’s research in a practical manner for the good of the citizens in the region. The name of organization that will deliver this is the Implementation Action Team. Put simply, it will seek to implement in the most practical way possible the most promising initiatives proposed in the project’s Hugli Heritage Management Strategy. The IAT harnesses cultural heritage to promote quality of urban life and sustainable development in the at-risk urban periphery of the megacity of Kolkata. The new funding will allow the project team to carry forward seven new sub-projects (including drone-supported environmental assessment led by colleagues in Environmental Science at the University of Liverpool and a sensory garden masterplan developed by colleagues in Architecture). The aim is to create a scalable toolkit that we hope willing Indian authorities will adopt after the end of the project to safeguard the unique hybrid grand houses of Hugli, to create wealth through heritage and to include even larger numbers of people in the safeguarding of cultural and built heritage in a region affected by both rapid urbanisation and climate change."
