        "text": "Mughal’s power declined in the first part of the 18th century. Aurangzeb’s reign (1658-1707) marked the start of the end of Mughal rule in India. Due to succession wars and weak rulers, Aurangzeb’s faulty policies harmed the state’s stability, and the fall accelerated after his death. The Mughal fortune vanished when Muhammad shah was governing the empire for 29 years. The new realms of Hyderabad, Bengal, Awadh, and Punjab were formed, and the Marathas began to vie for the imperial throne. East India Company started to control Bengal after it got Diwani Rights of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa in 1765 from Shah Alam II in the treaty of Allahabad. A year back ago, before the passing of Regulating act, in 1772 complete control on Bengal was taken over by the EIC. During this time Lord Hasting set up Board of revenue in Calcutta and Patna and took over revenue collection directly.\n\nBackground of Bengal:\n\nMurshid Quli Khan was the founder of Bengal. Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan, Sarfaraz Khan, and Alivardi Khan were the other kings. Siraj-ud-Daula rose to the throne in 1756 but was defeated and slain in the Battle of Plassey by the East India Company. After 1630, the growth of company authority in the North-East began. Trading houses were built in Hariharpur and Balasore, both in Odisha, at the mouth of the Mahanadi, around 1633. Brijman established a Kothi in Hooghly in 1651. All of Bengal’s, Orissa’s, and Coromandel’s coastlines were incorporated under Fort St. George in 1658.\n\nDevelopment of British power in Bengal:\n\nGabriel Bantan play a major role in getting the first commercial exemption in Bengal as he was working as a court physician in the regime of Bengal’s Subedar Shahshuja. So, in 1651, he was able to get a license for the company to trade. In exchange for 3000 rupees annual fee, the corporation was allowed to trade freely in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.\n\nA second ‘mark’ was issued in 1656, allowing the British to trade without an additional reaffirmation, although Shahshuja’s successors did not regard this ‘mark’ to be compulsory. In 1680, the corporation received a decree prohibiting anybody from harassing or interfering with the company’s men for the sake of octroi.\n\nIn 1687 AD, the British were granted permission to return to Sutanuti. In August 1690, Job Charnock established The English Kothi in Sutanuti. In February 1691, Ibrahim Khan, the successor of the Subedar of Bengal, Shaista Khan, issued an edict exempting the British from paying tax in exchange for a Rs. 3000 annual levy. Following the insurrection of Sobha Singh, a zamindar from the Burdwan district, the British were granted permission to garrison their new Kothi in 1696 AD. In 1698 AD, Subedar Azim-ush-shan of Bengal granted the British the title of three villages, Sutanuti, Kalikata, and Govindpur, in exchange for 1200 rupees paid to the owners of the villages. Fort William was named after the Emperor of England, and Sir Charles Eyre served as its first president. It was proclaimed the first presidential city in 1700 AD, and it served as the capital of British India from 1774 to 1911 AD.\n\nEstablishment of British factories in Bengal:\n\nIn 1651 AD, Shahshuja, the Subedar of Bengal, issued a decree granting the British the privilege of trade in Bengal in exchange for a Rs 3000 annual fee. Under the supervision of Bridgeman, the first British factory was constructed in 1651 AD in Hoogly, Bengal. The British and Aurangzeb faced off in 1686 AD. The Mughal monarch had accused the British of plundering the Hoogly district, so they were expelled. After being beaten in battle, the British were forced to flee Hoogly.\n\nAurangzeb granted license and freedom of trade once more in exchange for Rs 1,50,000 in reparations to the Britishers. In 1698 AD, Bengal’s subedar, Azim-ush-Shan, gave the Britishers the zamindari (landlords) of Sutanuti, Kalikata, and Govindpur. Ibrahim Khan was the landlord of Sutanuti, Kolkata, and Govindpur at that time. Job Charnock laid the foundation for a new Calcutta metropolis by uniting Sutanuti, Kalikata, and Govindpur. As a result, Job Charnock is regarded as “Calcutta’s Father.” In 1700 AD, Fort William was built in Calcutta. The first governor of Fort William was Charles Eyre (Kolkata). In 1700 AD, Calcutta was designated as the first presidential city.\n\nImportant Timeline:\n\n1765- English East India company acquires Diwani of Bengal.\n\n1773- Regulating act passed by the British parliament to regulate the activities of the East India Company.\n\n1793- Permanent settlement in Bengal.\n\n1800- Santhals begin to come to the Rajmahal hills and settle there\n\n1818- First revenue settlement in Bombay, Deccan.\n\nImportant Questions:\n\nQ1: Who was the founder of Bengal?\n\n1.
