A striking feature of the monument is a giant clock on the main entrance, right between the twin towers. The clock has two dials and three bells. The smaller bells ring at an interval of 15 minutes while the bigger ones ring at an interval of one hour. Two people wind the clock for half an hour each week. The twin towers are approximately 150 ft. in height and have about 150 steps.\n\n8. Hooghly Jail\n\nThe imprisonment of legendary poet, writer and musician Kazi Nazrul Islam made the Hooghly Jail a famous location. During the 1920s, Kazi Nazrul was charged with sedition by the British government. He was then shifted from the Alipore Jail to the Hooghly Jail, where he went on a month-long fast as a sign of protest against the mistreatment of prisoners by the British superintendent. He was eventually released from the Hooghly Jail in December 1924.\n\n9.
