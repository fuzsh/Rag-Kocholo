Hugli, city, central West Bengal state, northeastern India. The city lies just west of the Hugli (Hooghly) River and is a major road and rail connection. Rice milling and rubber-goods manufacture are the chief industries.

Hooghly (now Hugli) was founded by the Portuguese in 1537 following the decline of Satgaon, the mercantile capital of Lower Bengal. Mughal armies expelled the Portuguese from Hooghly in 1632. Hooghly was also the first English settlement (1651) in Lower Bengal; it was abandoned in 1690 for Calcutta (now Kolkata).
