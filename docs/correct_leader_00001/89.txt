Francisco Franco, and the modernization of Spain

Francisco Franco Bahamonde, known as Franco, was the Spanish political and military leader who ruled Spain from the end of the Civil War in 1939 until his death in 1975. During his tenure, Franco modernized the country and established a stable economy.

In the economic field, Franco carried out a series of reforms and policies that allowed the country to recover from the Civil War and establish a solid foundation for its economic growth in the following decades. This included the establishment of the National Institute of Industry (INI) to modernize and expand Spanish industry, as well as the creation of Social Security and agrarian reform.

Regarding the modernization of the country, Franco carried out a series of public works that improved the country's infrastructure, including the construction of roads, railways, dams and other infrastructure. He also promoted education and culture, founding the National Library of Spain and the Higher Council for Scientific Research, among other institutions.

Despite these negative aspects, many Spaniards have positive memories of Franco due to his role in defending Spain during the Civil War and in modernizing the country. He is also remembered for his "non-alignment" policy during the Cold War, which allowed Spain to maintain a neutral position in the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union.
