        "text": "In October 2019, Spain transferred Francisco Franco's coffin from his mausoleum in the Valle de los Caídos (\"Valley of the Fallen\"), a huge basilica built to his glory by thousands of political prisoners and containing the bones of more than 33,000 victims from both sides of the Civil War, to a small municipal cemetery.\n\n\"The public tribute to the dictator was more than an anachronism or an anomaly, it was an affront to Spanish democracy,\" said Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez at the time, determined to heal the country's wounds inherited from 40 years of dictatorship. Not content with that, three years later the Spanish government is continuing its policy of commemorating the victims of the Civil War (1936-1939) and the dictatorship.\n\nAfter a close vote on Thursday 14 July – 166 votes in favor, 153 against and 14 abstentions – marked by lively debate, the Spanish Parliament's lower house passed the new \"democratic memory\" bill, creating a new law with tougher condemnation of Francoism. Once passed by the Senate, this will replace the Law of Historical Memory, passed in 2007 by the Socialist government of José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and will fill in some gaps.\n\nWhile the 2007 law declared Franco's courts \"illegitimate,\" the new bill proclaims Franco's regime \"illegal\" and annuls all sentences handed down by his courts for political offences or crimes of conscience. Making the central government responsible for the search for, identification and exhumation of the remains of those who disappeared during the Civil War and the dictatorship, it will create a database of victims, a national map of mass graves and a centralized DNA bank, and the development of multi-year plans to speed up the opening of the mass graves.\n\nFar from a consensus\n\nThe law publicly recognizes the role of women in the fight against Franco's regime, the \"repression\" of the Catalan, Basque and Galician regional languages and the \"right to truth\" of the republican victims. It eliminates 33 titles of nobility that the dictator conferred on some of his closest collaborators between 1948 and 1978, starting with the \"Duchy of Franco;\" penalizes glorification of Franco's regime, and modifies the Official Secrets Act to guarantee access to the state archives. It also requires school curricula to include the study of Francoist repression.\n\n\"This is an important day,\" the minister Félix Bolaños said. \"It's a matter of turning the page om the darkest period in the history of our country. Spain in the 21st century needs to go further in terms of truth, reparations and preventing this from happening again.\""
