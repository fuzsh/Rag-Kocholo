        "text": "A chronology of key events:\n\n1492 - The Christian Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon conquer the Emirate of Granada, ending nearly 800 years of Muslim rule in the south and founding modern Spain as a united state.\n\nChristopher Columbus arrives in the Americas, heralding the conquest of much of South and Central America. Jews and later Muslims are expelled from Spain during the Inquisition.\n\n16th-17th Centuries - Spanish Empire at its height, with Spain the predominant European power. The rise of Protestant states in northern Europe and the Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean begin the country's gradual decline.\n\n18th Century - The War of the Spanish Succession loses Spain its European possessions outside the Iberian Peninsula. Bourbon dynasty, originally from France, centralises the Spanish state, shutting down many regional autonomous assemblies and modernising government and the military.\n\n1807-1814 - Napoleon's France occupies Spain, which has been a French satellite since 1795. Fierce nationalist resistance and British intervention in the Peninsular War gradually forces French troops out.\n\n19th Century - Napoleonic legacy of political division and economic dislocation leaves Spain weak and unstable, with frequent changes of government and a low-level insurgency by Carlist supporters of a rival branch of the royal family.\n\nAll Latin American colonies win their independence, with Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines in Asia lost during a disastrous war with the United States in 1898.\n\n1931 - The return of democratic government leads to an electoral backlash against the monarchy and its allies, and a republic is declared. Radical policies of land reform, labour rights, educational expansion and anti-Church legislation deepen the political divide.\n\n1936 - After two years of right-wing government, a Popular Front coalition of left-wing and liberal parties narrowly wins parliamentary elections and seeks to reintroduce the radical policies of 1931.\n\n1936-39 - Spanish Civil War: A coup by right-wing military leaders captures only part of the country, leading to three years of bitter civil war. More than 350,000 Spaniards die in the fighting. Italy and Nazi Germany intervene on the side of the Nationalists. The USSR aids the Republicans.\n\n1939 - General Francisco Franco leads the Nationalists to victory, and then purges the country of all remaining Republicans.\n\nSpain remains neutral throughout World War Two, although the government is sympathetic to the Axis powers.\n\n1946-50 - Francoist Spain is ostracised by United Nations and many countries sever diplomatic relations.\n\n1950s - As the Cold War deepens the US gradually improves relations with Spain, extending loans in return for military bases.\n\nSpain is admitted to the UN in 1955 and the World Bank in 1958, and other European countries open up to the Franco government.\n\nEl Milagro EspaÃ±ol - the economic miracle of the late 1950s - sees Spain's manufacturing and tourism industries take off through liberalisation of state controls.\n\n1959 - The Eta armed separatist group is founded with the aim of fighting for an independent homeland in the Basque region of Spain and France. Its violent campaign begins with an attempt to derail a train carrying politicians in 1961.\n\n1968 - West African colony of Spanish Guinea gains independence as Equatorial Guinea.\n\n1973 December - Eta kills Prime Minister Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco in retaliation for the government's execution of Basque fighters. Subsequent attempts to liberalise the Franco government founder on internal divisions.\n\n1975 November - Franco dies, and is succeeded as head of state Spain profile by King Juan Carlos. Spain makes transition from dictatorship to democracy, and withdraws from the Spanish Sahara, ending its colonial empire.\n\n1977 June - First free elections in four decades. Ex-Francoist Adolfo SuÃ¡rez's Union of the Democratic Centre manages a relatively smooth transition to stable democracy.\n\n1980 - 118 people are killed in one of Eta's bloodiest years.\n\n1981 February - Right-wing coup attempt fails after King Juan Carlos makes a televised address demanding the plotters surrender.\n\n1982 - Socialists under Felipe GonzÃ¡lez win elections and govern until 1996. Free education, an expanded welfare state and liberalisation of abortion laws are key policies. Spain joins Nato.\n\n1986 - Spain joins the European Economic Community, later to become the European Union.\n\n1996 March - Conservative JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar becomes prime minister.\n\n1997 July - Eta kills Basque councillor Miguel Ãngel Blanco, sparking national outrage and bringing an estimated six million people onto the streets in protest.\n\n1997 December - 23 leaders of Eta's political wing Herri Batasuna are jailed for seven years for collaborating with Eta - the first time any members of the party are jailed as a result of Eta links.\n\n1998 April - Crops destroyed and wildlife wiped out when an iron pyrite mine reservoir belonging to a Canadian-Swedish company bursts its banks causing toxic waste spillage. Waterways feeding Europe's largest wildlife reserve, the Donana national park, are severely contaminated.\n\n1998 September - Eta announces its first indefinite ceasefire since its campaign of violence began.\n\n2000 March - Aznar's Popular Party (PP) wins landslide in general elections.\n\n2002 January - Spain adopts the euro.\n\n2002 November - North-west coastline suffers ecological disaster after oil tanker Prestige breaks up and sinks about 210km out to sea.\n\n2004 March - A total of 191 people are killed in explosions on packed rush-hour trains in Madrid in near-simultaneous pre-election attacks by an Islamic group with links to al-Qaeda.\n\nWith Spain still in mourning, the Socialists under JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero defy earlier opinion polls and win a general election.\n\n2004 April - Prime Minister Zapatero orders Spanish troops withdrawn from Iraq in May.\n\n2005 June - Parliament defies Roman Catholic Church by legalising gay marriage and granting homosexual couples same adoption and inheritance rights as heterosexual ones.\n\n2005 September-October - At least 11 die and many more are injured in a series of mass attempts by African migrants to enter the enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta from Morocco in a bid to reach Spain.\n\n2006 January - Lt Gen Jose Mena Aguado sacked as head of army ground forces after suggesting that the military might take action in Catalonia if the region gains too much autonomy.\n\n2006 June - Voters in Catalonia back proposals to give the region greater autonomy as well as the status of a nation within Spain.\n\n2007 October - Twenty-one people, mainly North Africans, are found guilty and given long jail sentences for the Madrid train bombings in 2004.\n\n2007 November - Parliament passes a bill formally denouncing General Franco's rule and ordering the removal of all Franco-era statues and symbols from streets and buildings.\n\n2008 March - The Socialists win re-election with an increased margin, but falls short of an absolute majority.\n\n2015 December - Popular Party government loses majority in general election that sees populist anti-austerity movement Podemos and new liberal Cuidadanos movement perform well.\n\n2016 October - Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy forms minority government and ends 10 months of political deadlock after repeat elections in June.\n\n2017 August - Two Islamic State terror attacks kill 16 people in Barcelona and the nearby resort of Cambrils.\n\n2017 October - Madrid imposes direct rule in Catalonia after voters in a referendum back separation from Spain.\n\n2018 May - Basque separatist former armed group Eta announces it is ceasing all political activities.\n\n2018 June - Mariano Rajoy loses a vote of confidence.
