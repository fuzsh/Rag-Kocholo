        "text": "(male narrator) August 2017.\n\nIn Valladolid, Spain.\n\nA mass grave is revealed.\n\nIt is just one of more than 2000 mass burial sites across the nation.\n\n(Guy Hedgecoe) According to Amnesty International, Spain has the highest number of mass graves in the world after Cambodia.\n\n(narrator) This is the legacy of General Francisco Franco, victor of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nAfter taking control of the country in 1939, he secures his hold on the nation by unleashing a wave of violence against his countrymen.\n\n(Paul Preston) There were probably 20,000 people executed after the civil war, after the end of hostilities.\n\nIt's a regime of terror.\n\n(narrator) Within 6 years, Adolf Hitler will take his own life.\n\nBenito Mussolini will be swinging from his heels.\n\nBut Franco will rule Spain with ruthless efficiency for almost 40 years.\n\n(Paul Preston) Franco was someone who never lost a minute's sleep over the crimes that were committed in his name.\n\n(narrator) What drove this general to wage war on his people, destroy his country's new democracy, and establish Europe's longest dictatorship?\n\n[loud cheering] (woman) Dictatorships have had an incredible impact in the past century.\n\nThese dictators ended up learning from one another.\n\n(man) They're all different, but many use the same tactics.\n\n(woman) The use of terror.\n\n(man) Propaganda.\n\n(woman) Control the elites.\n\nCreate an enemy.\n\nCult of personality.\n\n(man) Use violence-- These are tools that dictators use to stay in power.\n\n[loud cheering] (narrator) The roots of Francisco Franco's dictatorship lie within deep divisions in the Spanish nation and within his own family.\n\nBorn in 1892, Franco is the 7th generation of a naval dynasty.\n\nFor almost 2 centuries, his family has sailed for the legendary Spanish fleet.\n\nFrancisco dreams of joining them.\n\nBut it's not to be.\n\nIn 1898, when Franco is 6, Spain goes to war with the United States over control of Cuba.\n\nSpain's navy is devastated.\n\nWhen the Spanish-American war ends, the country has lost Cuba, Puerto Rico, and almost all of its empire.\n\nIt is a wrenching and humiliating amputation.\n\nThere was an identity crisis if you didn't have an empire.\n\nit was a cultural political trauma for families related to the military, for the military and the political elites, for the government.\n\n(narrator) As Spain's empire falls to pieces, so does Franco's homelife.\n\nHis father, Nicolas Franco is a naval officer, and a notorious man about town, known for his womanizing and drinking.\n\n(Paul Preston) I think a lot of Franco's problems derived, of course, from the family dynamic.\n\nHis father despised him, he had two brothers, and his father massively preferred the other two.\n\nFranco's mother was a very strict Catholic.\n\nFranco was the mommy's boy.\n\nThese two things I think created a sense of vulnerability, but also a sense that he had to prove himself.\n\n(narrator) Franco will adopt his mother's deeply conservative vision of Spain and devote his life to making it a reality.\n\nYet he also wants to please his father, and that means a career in the military.\n\n(Antonio Cazorla-Sanchez) The problem with Franco was that he really wanted to be in the navy.\n\nThe Naval Academy was closed because Spain has lost most of its fleet in the war so he has to settle for infantry, which was far less prestigious.\n\n(narrator) 1907... Franco enters the Toledo military academy determined to be an officer.\n\nSmall for his age and conspicuous for a high-pitched voice, he endures severe bullying.\n\n(Paul Preston) Well, Franco was a very small person and one of the ways in which he coped with being in the army was by creating a series of myths, and throughout his whole life, Franco was a bit like the Wizard of Oz, he was somebody who hid behind a series of masks.\n\n(narrator) When Franco graduates in 1910 his ambitions define him as much as his uniform.\n\nSpain's military class is obsessed with restoring the nation's prestige.\n\nFor a young officer, the best place to start is in one of Spain's remaining colonial outposts, Morocco.\n\nin Spain, in the peninsula, if you were an army officer, promotion was incredibly slow.\n\nIt was dead man's shoes.\n\nFranco chose to go to Africa because it was the best place to get quick promotion.\n\n[machine-gun fire] (narrator) 1912... Moroccan rebels have launched a violent campaign to force the Spanish out.\n\nLieutenant Franco is assigned to Spain's Army of Africa, a battalion of native Moroccans used for the fiercest fighting.\n\n(Antonio Cazorla-Sanchez) Going to Africa, he was lucky.\n\nIf he didn't get killed, meant the possibility of rapid promotion.\n\nThis is what Franco and many other officers did-- they became high-ranking officers within a few years... if they survived.\n\n(narrator) The Army of Africa has a name for young officers like Franco... \"the Betrothed of Death.\"\n\nOf the first 42 officers assigned to the unit in 1912, only 7 are alive in 1915.\n\nAnd one of them is Franco.\n\nWhile fighting with the Army of Africa, he employs a tactic that will come to define his dictatorship.\n\nTerror is the indiscriminate and arbitrary use of force that can incite fear in the hearts of people.\n\nThese acts of terror are public.\n\nThey're meant to be public; they're meant to seen.\n\nThe experience in Morocco, the experience of colonial war, which is war without limits, completely wild war against civilians where torture and mass killings are allowed, these definitely shaped his character.\n\n(narrator) His unit becomes infamous for its bloodthirsty tactics.\n\nThey cut the ears and the noses of the Moroccan rebels, and they take pictures of themselves with these trophies.\n\nThis is a brutal war, and this is where this man is finding his personality, who he is.\n\n(Paul Preston) Obviously it would be impossible to know that Franco arrived as a young soldier in Africa determined that one day he would be the dictator of Spain.\n\nIt wasn't like that.\n\nBut very soon we can see lots and lots of pieces of evidence of just how calculating he was.\n\n(narrator) Franco learns that fear can be useful with subordinates as well as enemies.\n\n(Guy Hedgecoe) One of his soldiers refused to eat his lunch one day and threw it back in the face of one of the officers.\n\nFranco had that soldier shot, and he forced the rest of the battalion to parade past the corpse of this dead soldier to remind them of the need for discipline.\n\n(narrator) Terror is his tactic, and the Army of Africa is his tool.\n\nOne day he will use both to seize ultimate power in Spain.\n\nBut in 1916, he is a young officer testing his limits and building a reputation for bravery.\n\nTo be courageous, you need to know fear.\n\nYou need to have the imagination to know what you're letting yourself in for, and Franco, in my view, was empty inside.\n\nHe had, seems to have had little or no emotion, so when it's said, \"Franco is a man who knew no fear,\" I believe that, I believe he knew no fear, and that to me, for what it's worth, is not courage.\n\n(narrator) In June, Franco's unit makes a frontal assault on insurgents trenches.\n\n(Antonio Cazorla-Sanchez) This is very dangerous.\n\nAnd the sharpshooters, of the rebels target officers.\n\n(narrator) Leading from the front, Franco takes a bullet.\n\nHis unit loses 56 of its 133 men.\n\nAnd Franco is very nearly one of them.\n\nAt the time, an abdominal wound is often a death sentence.\n\nAgainst all odds, he makes a full recovery and is promoted to major.\n\nTo his Moroccan troops, Franco's survival is a sign.\n\n(Antonio Cazorla-Sanchez) They started to say that he had \"baraca\"-- like a sort of blessing, good luck.\n\nSo they follow him blindly.\n\n(narrator) For Franco, it's confirmation that his life has a purpose.\n\n(Guy Hedgecoe) That adulation persuaded him that he was someone special, that he'd been chosen perhaps by providence, perhaps by God, to help Spain.\n\n(Paul Preston) In a very famous interview he said, \"Without Africa, I do not know how to understand myself.\"\n\n(narrator) Franco's African experience is also an opportunity to enhance his reputation.\n\nIn Morocco you have this group of embedded journalists who are quite pro war, who are there to promote, to make popular the cause of the war among the Spanish public.\n\nThey have been sent by the newspapers from Madrid, from Barcelona, from the provinces, and they are looking for heroes.\n\n(Paul Preston) Very early on, he began to cultivate journalists, say from about 1916 onwards, there are more and more articles about him.\n\n(Antonio Cazorla-Sanchez) He became very political as well.\n\nBecause there is, one thing is the officer in combat and then the officer who tells the story of the combat.\n\nAnd something that Franco learned very early is how to please the press with the right stories.\n\n(Paul Preston) The national right-wing newspaper starts to refer to him as \"el ace de la legion,\" the ace of the legion.\n\n(narrator) In 1926, Franco is promoted to brigadier general.\n\nAt 33, he is the youngest general in all of Europe.\n\nThe bullied little cadet is a certified war hero.\n\nAfrica has given him the respect he craves, and the tactics that will mark his rise to power.\n\nBut now, at the peak of his career, a tide of political change could destroy his dreams for Spain.\n\n[loud explosions] The convulsions of the First World War and the Russian revolution of 1917 have transformed European society.\n\nBy contrast with its enduring monarchy, Spain seems tradition bound.\n\nThe population is largely rural, and the Catholic church a powerful force, but even here, change is brewing.\n\n(Antonio Cazorla-Sanchez) The country was industrializing.\n\nThe country was becoming more urban.\n\nThere were huge pockets of poverty.\n\nVery strong social inequalities, and the political system was problematic.\n\n(narrator) The gap between rich and poor is a faultline that divides Spanish society.\n\nThose who have knew what they had, and they knew how to go about keeping it, whereas all those who wanted to change things all had very different ideas.\n\n(narrator) Inspired by Russia's Communist Revolution, many turn to socialism, which is sweeping countries like France and Germany.\n\nOthers look to the Fascism of Benito Mussolini's Italy.\n\nSome blame the Catholic Church for complicity in maintaining an oppressive status quo.\n\n(Paul Preston) You go into Spanish churches, and they have, you know, gold altars and so on.\n\nIn places where the people were starving, this created huge hatred.\n\n(narrator) Anarchists want to tear down the existing power structure.\n\nSo all of this is happening and for people like Franco and traditionalists, those kind of related to the military, this is really absolutely beyond the pale, this is not what they want, they are looking back to an imperial Spain of centuries gone where there was hierarchy, where people knew their place.\n\n(narrator) April 1931.\n\nSupport for the monarchy is plummeting.\n\nFacing a possible insurrection, the Spanish King agrees to step down.\n\n(Antonio Cazorla-Sanchez) King Alfonso XIII steps down in 1931 because the country rejects him.\n\n(Helen Graham) He didn't have the support of sufficient numbers of old Spain.\n\nThere was an awful lot of animus against Alfonso the 13th not against the monarchy so much but against him personally.\n\nSo there's a sense of new constituencies knocking on the door of an old system and wanting some kind of representation.\n\n(narrator) Within months a new republic is formed and a left-leaning government established.\n\nA new constitution guarantees a free press and regular elections.\n\nEvery Spanish adult, man or woman, can vote.\n\nBut not everyone is celebrating this tide of change (Paul Preston) Franco has an idea of the authentic Spain.\n\nIt's Catholic, it protected property, it protected the sanctity of marriage, all of these things were challenged by the left.\n\n(narrator) The left threatens his vision of Spain.\n\nSoon he'll have the opportunity to strike back.\n\nNovember, 1933.\n\nSpain swings to the right as a coalition of conservative parties wins the next election.\n\nFranco, the hero of Africa, is promoted to major general.\n\nBut almost a year later, socialists and anarchists stage a massive strike in the coal-rich region of Asturias in the Northwest.\n\nThe right-wing government turns to Franco, who welcomes the chance to restore order.\n\n(Guy Hedgecoe) Communists and socialists offended him in a way, automatically.\n\nHe was very religious, very Catholic.\n\nHe saw people on the left as atheists, who did not believe in God.\n\n(narrator) To warn the left against further acts of rebellion, he turns to a tactic used by other would-be strongmen.\n\n(Dan Slater) So for Franco, terror is a form of communication.\n\nYou don't have to attack every single person who belongs to these organizations-- if you used terror against some of them, it sends the signal that anyone whose loyalty goes to these leftist movements is going to be in trouble.\n\n[loud gunshot] (Antonio Cazorla-Sanchez) He ordered troops from the Army of Africa to go to Asturias.\n\nBy doing that, he knows that it's going to take there troops that are ruthless, very violent.\n\n(narrator) Franco's troops round up more than 3000 Spaniards and gun them down.\n\n(Paul Preston) That was a symbol of his ruthlessness.\n\nHe had the coast bombarded by the Spanish Navy, he had the mining villages bombed by the Spanish Air Force.\n\n(narrator) 30,000 prisoners are transported to colonial territories outside Spain to serve their sentences.\n\nHe did what he had been doing in Africa.\n\nIt was mass repression.\n\nIt was colonial war basically.\n\nBut for the first time it was colonial war that was applied in the metropolis.\n\nIt was not longer war against the Moroccans, it was war against the Spaniards.\n\n(Guy Hedgecoe) It was not just an opportunity to prove himself militarily, there was also an element of politics in that.\n\nSo it was kind of his first taste of politics-- a chance for him to prove himself in a sphere that was beyond the purely military.\n\n(Paul Preston) It also gave him the conviction that he was the man that could save Spain from all these challenges from the left.\n\n(narrator) Franco suppresses the uprising.\n\nBut his tactics trigger a political explosion.\n\nLeft-wing parties are appalled by his brutality.\n\nThey band together into a coalition called the Popular Front.\n\nOn February 16, 1936, Spaniards go to the polls once again.\n\nThe pendulum swings, and the right-wing government is ejected.\n\nThe Popular Front emerges with a majority in parliament.\n\nIt's a disaster for Franco, but the worst is yet to come.\n\nWorried about a military coup, the Popular Front sidelines key right-wing generals.\n\nFranco himself is banished to one of Spain's last colonial possessions-- the Canary Islands, 100 kilometers off the coast of Africa, and 2000 kilometers from Madrid.\n\nThe minister of war decides that to keep these guys out of trouble, they will be posted far away where they can do the least damage.\n\n(narrator) In exile, the generals watch as Spain's new leaders steer the nation to the left.\n\nEven worse, they learn that left-wing extremists have been torching churches and executing priests.\n\nTo save Spain, the exiled generals plot a coup and they ask Franco to take a leading role.\n\nBut a military coup is the ultimate gamble.\n\n(Guy Hedgecoe) He was cautious about getting involved in this uprising.\n\nHe'd seen other similar attempts at military rebellions fail.\n\nHe was worried that that would happen again.\n\n(narrator) If the coup fails, Franco will be executed as a traitor.\n\nFor days, he deliberates.\n\nHe has a wife, he has a child.\n\nHe has a career.\n\nBut circumstances will force his hand.\n\nOn July 13, 1936, José Calvo Sotelo, a leading right-wing politician, is assassinated in Madrid.\n\n(Paul Preston) What clinched it for Franco, what made the difference was the murder of José Calvo Sotelo.\n\n(Helen Graham) He is murdered whilst in the custody of republican police.\n\nThe funeral for Calvo Sotelo is turned into a kind of show of strength; in a sense, it is the trigger.\n\n(narrator) For Spaniards on the right, the assassination is an outrage.\n\nFor Franco and the generals, it's the final straw.\n\nJuly 18, 1936.\n\nWearing civilian clothes, Franco secretly boards a plane that will carry him to Africa.\n\nThe coup is on.\n\nFranco was given the responsibility for Morocco because of his track record as a major player in the colonial history of Spain.\n\n(narrator) His mission-- lead the Army of Africa into Spain.\n\nit's the beginning of a bloody struggle between bitter enemies-- the right-wing nationalists against the left-wing republicans.\n\nFranco gets the Army of Africa to support the coup.\n\nNow he has to get them to Spain.\n\nBut transporting thousands of men and their equipment across the Strait of Gibraltar would be a massive undertaking... even in peacetime.\n\nAnd for Franco, there's an added complication.\n\nThe Spanish Navy has refused to join the coup, and its ships are patrolling the strait.\n\n(Helen Graham) The army of Africa is basically trapped in North African territory.\n\nSo the Strait's very effectively blocked; speed is of the essence.\n\n(narrator) Franco needs planes to jump the Strait and join the fight.\n\nAudaciously, he turns to a pair of strongmen-- Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.\n\nThey leap at the chance to use Spain as a testing ground for new weapons and tactics.\n\nMaking some 800 flights, German and Italian air force planes take 14,000 men across the Mediterranean into Spain.\n\n(Antonio Cazorla-Sanchez) So without the help of the fascist powers, the army of Africa would have had a very tough time.\n\n(Helen Graham) This is seen as the first major airlift in modern history, and absolutely crucial to the coup on mainland Spain.\n\n(narrator) Franco's airlift astonishes his Republican enemies and advances his status among his coconspirators.\n\nWhile other generals fight across Spain, he begins a merciless advance north towards Madrid.\n\n(Helen Graham) The Army of Africa's a killing machine, and it's up against a civilian population in the south of Spain.\n\nThere is no army.\n\nIt was basically meeting peasants with farm implements.\n\nEvery time they arrive at a destination, or indeed just en route, they just massacre people.\n\nFranco's forces soon reach the city of Badajoz, near the Portuguese border.\n\n(Guy Hedgecoe) He encouraged his officers to be extremely brutal, often savage, when they were waging their campaigns.\n\nWhen they took a town in the Civil War, a few hours after the taking of that town there would be absolute carnage.\n\n(Paul Preston) Basically the left wingers who were captured were rounded up and then they were machine-gunned.\n\n(narrator) In the Badajoz Massacre some 4000 suspected leftists are murdered.\n\nAnd it's not an isolated event.\n\nIn retaliation, some republican extremists turn on the church.\n\nPriests and other clergy are executed for siding with the nationalists.\n\nThere is this kind of mass attack on anyone who is symbolically representative of the church.\n\nBecause the ecclesiastical hierarchy backs the coup.\n\n(narrator) Spain is split.\n\nThe coup has ignited a battle for the soul of the nation.\n\nFranco believed that he should do whatever was possible, whatever was at his disposal, to eliminate the left and their ideology.\n\n(narrator) His ruthlessness is not limited to his enemies.\n\nOfficers who failed to support the coup are executed, including his own cousin and childhood playmate.\n\nTo show mercy is to show weakness.\n\nThe future dictator is preparing his path to power.\n\n(Paul Preston) At the very beginning while the other generals were mainly concerned with how they went about winning the war, Franco would set up a press office whose main purpose was to project Franco in the world's press as the leader of the military coup, which at that stage he wasn't.\n\n[speaking Spanish] (narrator) To claim the leadership, he calls for a meeting of the top brass.\n\nSeptember 21, 1936.\n\nFranco's fellow generals fly in from every sector of Nationalist Spain to a temporary airstrip near Salamanca.\n\n(Paul Preston) The really big thing on Franco's side, in the quest for power, was the fact that he was the commander of the African Army.\n\nFranco had been instrumental in securing the help of Hitler and Mussolini.\n\n(Helen Graham) So they basically saw him as somebody who could unite them all and keep them together for the duration of the war.\n\n(narrator) The other generals vote to make Franco the commander in chief of the armed forces.\n\nAlthough he is ranked 23rd in seniority, no one else has the combination of combat experience, political savvy, and connections.\n\nFranco is now the generalissimo, the first among generals, a major step on his road to power.\n\nThe cunning with which he got to be dictator, the cunning with which he rose to the top is very evident.\n\n(narrator) But for now Franco only controls parts of Spain.\n\nTo rule it all he will need the support of the pillars of Spanish society.\n\nAnd to earn it, he will use a key tactic from the dictator's playbook.\n\nThe Achilles heel of any dictatorship is the elites and whether or not they support them.\n\nAnd that's why dictators, so early on, want to get control over their elites.\n\nThey want to ensure that they're completely loyal to them.\n\n(Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal) There were 2 or 3 sectors whose consent was crucial for his survival.\n\nThis was the church, it was the military, and it was the higher classes: the aristocracy and the industrialists.\n\n(narrator) With the support of the military assured, Franco sets his sights on the pillar of traditional Spanish society... the Catholic Church.\n\n[loud explosion] September, 1936.\n\nRather than advance on the republican stronghold of Madrid, Franco pivots to Toledo.\n\n[loud explosions] There, a small group of nationalist soldiers is besieged in the city's ancient fortress, the Alcázar.\n\nAlthough Toledo has no strategic value, it has something more important.\n\nIt is the historic center of Spanish Catholicism.\n\nFranco decides to detour to relieve the siege of the military fortress.\n\nIt is particularly seen as a symbol of imperial Christian Spain.\n\n(narrator) Franco's forces crush the Republican Army in Toledo and take the town.\n\nFranco personally wasn't there when Toledo was relieved, however, he was there the next day.\n\nThe newsreel cameras were there to see Franco arrive in order to be able to project to the world this view that Franco was the hero who had saved Toledo.\n\n[male newsreel announcer] Franco greeted as the savior of 1900 men, women, and children who held out in this shattered fortress and in caverns underneath.\n\n(Paul Preston) He projected himself as a major world figure.\n\n(Helen Graham) He has an ambition and is clearly looking beyond the war to a political phase, to a phase of being in control of Spain beyond the war.\n\n(narrator) When the coup began, Franco was just one of many generals.\n\nNow, he has established his reputation as a military mastermind and the savior of Spanish Catholicism.\n\nJust imagine, mid-July 1936, you are a general semi-isolated from your colleagues.\n\nTwo months afterwards, you are the head of the main army of the rebels with no rival for powers and about to take Madrid.\n\nHe cannot believe his luck.\n\nMust be God!\n\nWhat other explanation?\n\n(narrator) October 1936 Nationalist forces control the western half of Spain.\n\nBut much of the nation remains under the control of the Republican Popular Front.\n\nTo rule the country, Franco must take its political, financial, and administrative center.\n\nTo convince all Spaniards, and to convince the rest of the world that he had won, he needed to take Madrid.\n\n(narrator) For weeks, Franco throws everything at the capitol-- artillery... aerial bombardment... frontal attacks.\n\n[machine-gun fire] The city won't fall.\n\nThe republic basically concentrates its forces in Madrid, and as long as it can prevent Madrid being encircled, it can survive.\n\n(narrator) Soon Franco's drive to take Madrid gets even harder, as his enemies gain a powerful new ally.\n\nThe Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin has agreed to arm the republic and its left-wing government.\n\n(Helen Graham) When it's clear that Franco began to be able to take Madrid, the Soviet Union offers to support the republic.\n\n(narrator) What was meant to be a quick coup d'etat is now a full-blown civil war.\n\n[speaking Spanish] (narrator) He has conquered large swaths of Spanish territory but Franco's domination is far from complete.\n\nIn many of the regions he now controls, half of his fellow citizens are against him.\n\nHe is determined to vanquish them all.\n\nWhile the Nationalist Army continues its battles, Franco sets out to eliminate civilian opposition in the land he has seized.\n\nTo do this, he employs another tactic of dictatorship.\n\n(Guy Hedgecoe) Franco wanted to defeat the Left, but he also wanted to eliminate them.\n\nHe wanted to make sure that there was no vestige left of that ideology.\n\n(narrator) Franco creates the Supreme Court of Military Justice-- a vast bureaucracy dedicated to prosecuting those who oppose him.\n\nAnd you were open to prosecution if you had any connections with republican politics or sympathies.\n\nSo people can be brought before military courts for activities that go back to 1934.\n\nThey apply the military code to their enemies by accusing those who defended the republic of the crime of rebellion which is what the Francoists have committed.\n\n(Helen Graham) There must be a social cleansing of all the elements in society who have allowed the republic to exist and who are now our enemies.\n\nSilvia Navarro's grandfather was one of those enemies.\n\n[speaking Spanish] (narrator) Jose Antonio Marco Viedma was a prominent businessman in the city of Calatayud... and a republican.\n\n(Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal) All dictators use violence against their people.\n\nIn the case of Spain the scale of intersocial violence is unique.\n\nMost victims, like 99%, were Spaniards, and this is interesting because Franco was actually perceiving at least half of Spain as not properly Spanish.\n\nSo you can inflict this terrible violence to your own people, if you consider they are not actually your own people, that they are, in a way, foreigners.\n\n(narrator) City by city, town by town, Franco's forces arrest not just Popular Front leaders and party faithful, but anyone with republican sympathies.\n\n(Helen Graham) it's not just a tactic for a military campaign, it's a form of political readjustment, removing the kind of people that made the republic possible, this would be never possible again.\n\nIt's a form of social engineering, (narrator) As the war progresses, Franco intensifies his attacks on civilians.\n\nHis allies in the German and Italian air forces begin to obliterate towns and villages.\n\nGuernica, Durango, Barcelona, Madrid.\n\n(Helen Graham) The idea was that you would terrorize and demoralize a civilian population and this would be a crucial instrument of war.\n\nIt's the war against civilians, waged with the new technology.\n\n(narrator) 1939.\n\nAs Spain tears itself apart, Europe braces for war.\n\n[crowd cheering] Conserving its resources for the coming conflict, the Soviet Union withdraws its support of the Republic.\n\nBy February, what's left of the Popular Front's army collapses.\n\n[loud cheering] (narrator) March 27.\n\nFranco's forces parade through Madrid.\n\nAfter the loss of half a million lives, the civil war is over.\n\nThree years after crossing the Strait of Gibraltar, Francisco Franco is the dictator of all Spain.\n\nIn the nationalist regions, victory celebrations echo into the dawn.\n\nIn what were once republican regions, people are fleeing for their lives.\n\n(Paul Preston) Large numbers of people had fled Madrid.\n\nI mean, thousands upon thousands of people fled to the coast hoping to be able to get away.\n\nVictory gives Franco the opportunity to complete his transformation of Spanish society.\n\n(Helen Graham) The war is not really ending with the end of the battlefield phase, but becoming basically a war against the defeated.\n\n(narrator) He launches another wave of targeted arrests and killings of anyone with connections to the old government.\n\n(Dan Slater) It's very much to send a signal to anyone who opposed the church, anyone who was a socialist, anyone who joined the organizations of the political left.\n\n(narrator) Beyond Spain's borders, the Second World War burns across Europe.\n\nTo the outside world, Spain is officially neutral.\n\nBut within, the dictator's war against his people is just getting started.\n\nIn the course of 3 years, nearly one quarter of a million people are imprisoned... 28,000 are executed.\n\n(Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal) This was essential in Franco's strategy because he had to completely exterminate all opposition to his regime so that he could rule for the next 40 years.\n\nAs he transforms Spanish society, he turns to another tactic of dictatorships.\n\nIndoctrination is largely a process of preventing people from hearing alternative narratives.\n\nIt's a way of giving substance to fear and reminding people of the risks of life without the regime that is currently in power.\n\nPeople were obliged to think what the regime wanted them to think.\n\nThere was total control of the education system, there was total control of the media.\n\n(Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal) Indoctrination in the Franco regime is quite unique in that it systematically used the procedures of Catholic indoctrination.\n\nSo there was even a catechism that was used to tell very young children about Franco, about the regime, about how good this was.\n\n(narrator) For Franco, indoctrination cannot begin soon enough.\n\nIn prison, if a republican woman is pregnant, she is allowed to carry her baby to term.\n\nThen the child is taken and placed in a properly Spanish family.\n\n(Emilio Silva) They went to the prisons and they kidnapped the babies from the republican woman, because they say the woman can provoke the transmission of the democracy for the children.\n\nAnd then take the children and put the children in Catholic institutions or Catholic families.\n\n(Antonio Cazorla-Sanchez) They say that Franco is the man chosen by God, and that he's there doing God's will.\n\nThe children at the time in religious and lay schools are being taught that Franco's life is like the life of Christ.\n\nCatholicism was key to the entire ideology of the regime.\n\nThe idea was, we are going to torture you, we are going to kill you, but we are doing that because you are evil, and we are doing this because we need to redeem you, that it is for your own good, because we want you to go to heaven, and for that you have to be punished, you have to suffer.\n\nSo there were these ideas of sin and redemption that was so Catholic, and that were so Spanish.\n\n(narrator) 1945.\n\nHitler commits suicide.\n\nMussolini is executed.\n\nThe Second World War is over.\n\nBut Spain's dictator remains.\n\nFranco's fortunes are helped by a shift in the political winds.\n\nAs the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union begins, Franco's extreme anti-communism makes him an ally of the West.\n\n(Helen Graham) By the 1950s, Eisenhower visits Spain, and Franco presents himself as the kind of sentinel of the west, this anti-communist warrior who can keep the continent safe.\n\nFranco has free rein to continue his state of terror.\n\nThere were hundreds of thousands of Republicans that were in jail.\n\n(narrator) But there are pockets of resistance.\n\nUniversity student Nicolas Sanchez is one of the resistors.\n\nAfter taking part in a peaceful demonstration, he is arrested and sentenced to 6 years in prison.\n\nTo deal with prisoners like Nicolas Sanchez, Franco uses a classic dictator's tool.\n\n(Fathali Moghaddam) Well, there's 2 functions of gulags.\n\nOne is creating fear.\n\nA second function of these gulags is that they want certain people out of the way and they want to use them as examples of what could happen to you if you step out of line.\n\n(Nicolas Sanchez) There were also concentration camps that were used to build fortifications, railroads, dams-- that was heavy work.\n\n(narrator) Franco uses slave labor to build a massive monument to the victory of his regime.\n\nHe calls it the Valley of the Fallen.\n\n(Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal) Most of the people who worked in the Valley of the Fallen were political prisoners.\n\nFor each year they worked in the Valley of the Fallen, they did not have to spend 5 years in prison.\n\nThey were given the choice, but it is not that they liked to be there, it is that the other option was much worse.\n\n(narrator) In 1959, after almost 20 years of hard labor, the dictator's tribute to himself is finished.\n\nThe monumental scale is an indication of their overweening desire to control the societies that they rule.\n\nBut it is a reflection of an aspiration to some kind of eternal influence in the future of their own countries.\n\n(narrator) Not only is the monument complete, so is Franco's domination of Spanish politics and society.\n\nTo hold a political opinion is to commit a crime.\n\n(Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal) That prevented people from entering politics, because politics were associated with conflict and with war.\n\nThe main success of this strategy was associating politics with danger, and it was very successful until at least the late 1960s.\n\n(narrator) Franco has achieved what he set out to do.\n\nHe has frozen Spain in time.\n\nHis regime secure, he cultivates the image of a benign international statesman and paternal sovereign.\n\n(Paul Preston) In later life, this dictator, this mass murderer, was projected as the kind of grandfather of his people.\n\n(narrator) After almost 30 years in power, the patriarch faces one last challenge: who will rule Spain when he dies?\n\n1969.\n\nFranco announces that Juan Carlos, the grandson of King Alfonso XIII, will be his successor.\n\nThe dying dictator hopes the new king will keep Spain locked in the past.\n\nBut when Franco dies on November 20, 1975, his regime dies with him.\n\nNow king, Juan Carlos defies Franco's final wish.\n\nHe moves to dismantle the dictatorship and restore Spain to democracy.\n\nLess than 2 years later, Spaniards hold their first democratic election in more than 40 years.\n\nThe results mirror the election of 1936.\n\nThe left wing wins by a narrow margin.\n\nFranco's attempt to obliterate socialism has failed.\n\nBut the consequences of his dictatorship haunt Spain to this day.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Spaniards have confronted Franco's crimes against humanity.\n\n(Guy Hedgecoe) According to Amnesty International, Spain has the highest number of mass graves in the world after Cambodia.\n\nSo there are all these unmarked graves around the country, and this issue has not been resolved.\n\n(Emilio Silva) In Spain we have the names and the orders of names of 114,000 civilians missing in mass graves.\n\nFor example, in Malaga, in the south of Spain, in the cemetery, there is a group of graves with 4,300 people.\n\n(Paul Preston) There is considerable disquiet, discomfort, resentment about the fact that there's never been any real process of seeking justice for those who were murdered during the civil war.\n\n(Emilio Silva) And I think our history is part of the black box of Europe.\n\nAnd we have to recover the black box.\n\nAnd we have to show the sounds, sort of, in this black box.\n\n(Antonio Cazorla-Sanchez) The legacy is the emptiness that he caused in the Spanish society, all the wealth, the human wealth and the material wealth that the Spanish Civil War and the brutal dictatorship cost on the Spanish society.\n\nSo how do you evaluate that?\n\nHow do you fix that?\n\nI don't have an answer.\n\n(narrator) Next time on \"The Dictator's Playbook.\"\n\n(Lain Grahame) Idi Amin made a mark for himself.\n\n(Mahmood Mamdani) He tapped into something big.\n\n(Alicia Decker) He represented a fresh start.\n\n(Mahmood Mamdani) A future for Uganda.\n\n(Alicia Decker) Critics have written Amin off as a buffoon, but he was far more cunning.\n\nA soldier, charismatic.\n\nDistracting people from their repression.\n\n(Mariam Mufti) In the 8 years he was in power, almost 300,000 people were massacred He was ruthless, which good soldiers are.\n\n[orchestra plays in minor tones] (man) To order \"The Dictator's Playbook\" on DVD, visit shopPBS.org or call 1-800-PLAY-PBS.\n\nThis program is also available on Amazon Prime
