        "text": "What is the issue?\n\nThe Supreme Court of Spain recently ruled in favour of the government’s plan to exhume the remains of former dictator Francisco Franco.\n\nAfter his death in 1975, Spain transitioned from the authoritarian structure to a constitutional monarchy.\n\nWhat is the Spanish Civil War (1936-39)?\n\nIt is known as the ‘Guerra Civil’ in Spanish.\n\nThe conflict pitted Spain’s democratically elected Republican government against forces led by General Francisco Franco, who seized power in 1939 after three years of brutal warfare.\n\nSupporters - Franco was supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, as well as by conservative elements within Spain.\n\nThe Republican government was helped by the Soviet Union and by volunteer forces from democratic countries in Europe and the US.\n\nThe major European democracies of the time, Britain and France, shied from helping Spain’s Republican government officially.\n\nThe Civil War is thus regarded by many as one of the key harbingers of World War II.\n\nHow was Franco’s rule (1939-1975)?\n\nAfter becoming Spain’s ruler in 1939, Franco maintained the country’s neutrality in World War II but remained friendly with the Axis powers that had helped him come to power.\n\nFranco’s initial years in office were especially repressive.\n\nThousands of political opponents were sent to prison by military tribunals, and executions by firing squads took place.\n\nHe prohibited the public use of regional languages such as Catalan and Basque.\n\nCatholic Christianity was the declared state religion.\n\nTrade unions were banned. Divorce and abortion were also forbidden.\n\nTowards the end of his rule, Franco relaxed his grip on power, and his anti-communist stance brought him closer to the US and its allies during the Cold War.\n\nThe last two decades of his rule saw an overhaul of Spain’s economy.\n\nIn 1969, Franco declared the exiled royal Juan Carlos I as his official successor upon his death.\n\nJuan Carlos I dismantled Spain’s authoritarian structure after taking over in 1975 and restored Spain to a constitutional monarchy.\n\nWhy the exhumation of Franco’s remains is to be done?\n\nAfter his death in 1975, Franco was buried at the Valle de los Caídos, a state mausoleum.\n\nIt was built during his rule using forced labour and where 33,000 victims of the Spanish Civil War are buried.\n\nIn the years since, as democracy grew stronger in Spain, calls to relocate the dictator’s remains to a less honorific place arose.\n\n2018 - The Spanish parliament agreed to exhume Franco’s remains.\n\nBut the government’s plans were impeded by protests from the former dictator’s family as well as by church authorities.\n\n2019 - The Supreme Court’s decision has now cleared most obstacles in the government’s path, and the Catholic Church has agreed to abide by the ruling.\n\nWhat does this move mean politically?\n\nThe Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE), which is running Spain’s minority government, plans to relocate Franco’s remains to a less high profile location before the next general election in November 2019.\n\nThe move could improve the PSOE’s fortunes in the elections.\n\nIt could invigorate Spain’s far-right, for whom Franco’s mausoleum has become a rallying point.\n\nIn the last election in April 2019, the ultra-nationalist party obtained 10% of the popular vote, a first for the ultra-right since Franco’s death."
