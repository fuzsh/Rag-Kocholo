        "text": "It is also a chance for Sánchez to gain support among leftists when his room for political maneuver is severely limited. As the head of a minority government, he must cobble together ad-hoc coalitions to get anything done in parliament. The government’s fragility was made plain last Friday, when it suffered its first defeat over the outline of the 2019 budget.\n\nHis decision to move Franco’s tomb is on firmer political ground. It is in line with the 2011 recommendations of a national commission endorsed by the United Nations, and a decision by parliament in 2017.\n\n“A country that looks to its future needs to be at peace with its past” — Pedro Sánchez\n\nParliament and the national commission saw removing the tomb as a first step to turning the Valley of the Fallen, which has been widely criticized as a shrine to the fascist leader, into a genuine site for memorial and national reconciliation.\n\nFranco launched a military coup against the democratic government of Spain in 1936, triggered a civil war and ruled the country until his death in 1975. He is buried together with some 34,000 victims of war and repression at the Valley of the Fallen.\n\n“A country that looks to its future needs to be at peace with its past,” Sánchez told parliament in June. “Wounds have remained open for many years, too many, and it’s time to heal them. Our democracy will have symbols that unite citizens, not ones that separate them.”\n\nBut Sánchez’s decision still carries risks. It leaves him open to accusations that while he claims to be healing the wounds of the past, he is actually reopening them by harking back to a dark and divisive period in Spain’s history.\n\n“I wouldn’t spend a single euro in unearthing Franco,” Pablo Casado, the newly elected leader of the conservative Popular Party whose own grandfather was jailed by Franco, told reporters.\n\nHe accused Sánchez of following the playbook of Spain’s last Socialist prime minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, by “proposing unnecessary issues, only to obtain electoral gains, with the risk of gravely fracturing society. I think we need to look to the future.”\n\nBut the government has made clear it will implement Sánchez’s decision sooner rather than later — once legal technicalities and potential opposition from Franco’s descendants have been overcome.\n\n‘Francoist trench’\n\nThe Valley of the Fallen is the most obvious representation of the fascist architecture and “national catholicism” ideology championed by Franco. Partly built by political prisoners under forced labor, it consists mainly of a basilica dug into a hillside topped by a cross 150 meters high — three times the height of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nInaugurated in 1959, the site was portrayed by the Franco regime as a site of reconciliation — even though it was clearly intended to glorify the victorious side in the war and its leader. About 12,500 of the people buried there are unidentified.\n\nAfter his death, the dictator was buried in the center of the basilica’s main crypt. In front of him lies José Antonio Primo de Rivera, founder of Falange, the main fascist party in Spain, who was executed by the republicans during the war.\n\n“It is the main anchor that Spain has to hardline Francoism” — Francisco Ferrándiz\n\nEvery year on November 20, the day Franco died, hundreds of supporters gather to pay tribute to him.\n\nFrancisco Ferrándiz, a researcher at the National Council of Research (CSIC) who has studied repression under Franco, said he often guides foreign guests around the complex. He always includes a daily mass celebrated in honor of Franco by Benedictine monks who live in the attached abbey and whom he described as hardline Franco supporters. Many visitors, he said, can’t believe their eyes.\n\n“It is the main anchor that Spain has to hardline Francoism,” Ferrándiz said of the monument, also describing it in military terms as “a Francoist trench protected by the far right.”\n\nNew Spain\n\nDigging up the dictator is unlikely to stir up a popular backlash. Half of Spaniards living today were born after the death of Franco — and there’s little nostalgia for him except among a very small, if vocal, minority of extremists who still hail him as a savior.\n\nSpanish society has also been transformed since Franco’s repressive, inward-looking regime came to an end. A survey by the Pew Research Center showed that a higher share of Spaniards reject autocratic or military government than do Americans, Italians, French or British citizens.\n\nThe proportion of Spanish citizens who had a positive view of the Franco regime dropped from 19.4 percent in 1986 to 10.4 percent in 2000, when the publicly funded Center for Sociological Research (CIS) stopped posing the question. However, the survey also found considerable ambivalence. While 37.4 percent of citizens had a negative view of the regime, 46.4 percent held a mixed view.\n\nA major CIS study from 2008 — the most recent on the issue — showed most Spaniards supported actions such as excavating mass graves to give victims of Franco a proper burial, getting rid of symbols glorifying the dictator and annulling the verdicts of political trials. But efforts to investigate human rights violations or put on trial perpetrators of abuses didn’t gather the same level of support.\n\nFrancisco Camas, a researcher for pollster Metroscopia, said roughly half of Spaniards supported efforts to deal with the past while the other half are more ambivalent, according to unpublished data from his company. Camas also said that removing Franco’s tomb was the measure that gathered the strongest support among all potential actions to deal with the past.\n\nTwo recent polls show that more Spaniards back the removal of Franco’s tomb than oppose it.\n\nIn party political terms, with a general election due by 2020 at the latest, the move should help Sánchez burnish his leftist credentials, possibly at the expense of the far-left Podemos, which has previously spearheaded a renewed push to address the phantoms of the past.\n\nIt will also help Sánchez counter a narrative advanced by Catalan separatists, who argue that modern Spain — below the surface — remains a fascist, authoritarian country.\n\nDivisions remain\n\nWhile the issue of removing Franco’s tomb is relatively uncontroversial, much of the legacy of Spain’s recent history remains sensitive and largely unaddressed.\n\nThe scale of the civil war, the vicious repression that it triggered and the four-decade-long dictatorship that ensued all meant that the country remained deeply divided over the fascist era even decades after the transition to democracy in the late 1970s.\n\n“We consider the Valley of the Fallen a site glorifying Francoism” — Daniel Canales\n\nEstimates of civil war combat casualties range from 200,000 to half a million. In addition, around 150,000 people were executed by Franco in the war and the following five years. Some 50-60,000 people were executed by the opposing side, the republicans.\n\nFranco’s legacy is not just counted among the dead. Half a million Spaniards fled the country in fear of his regime and some 400,000 were jailed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniel Canales, a researcher for Amnesty International in Spain, said victims of the conflict were treated very differently depending on which side they were on — and much remains to be done to address historic injustices.\n\n“We consider the Valley of the Fallen a site glorifying Francoism,” Canales said. “But many other measures, like facilitating access to justice for victims of Franco, are needed.”\n\nAfter the war, the Franco regime investigated crimes committed by the republicans, identified victims and gave them proper burials. Signs of this work can be seen in cemeteries across the country, usually under the inscription “Fallen for God and for Spain.”\n\nThe victims of Franco, by contrast, were left abandoned, unidentified and scattered in thousands of mass graves across Spain. Hundreds of those graves were unearthed and the remains moved to the Valley of the Fallen without officials getting consent from — or even informing — the relatives of the dead.\n\nAfter Spain transitioned to democracy, the task of excavating the graves and identifying the dead has fallen to relatives and civic organizations as the central government has refused to take the lead on such work\n\nMore recently, some regional governments — particularly those ruled by the left — have taken a more proactive role. In Andalusia, the area hardest hit by Franco’s repression, the regional government has identified 708 mass graves, with around 100 already excavated and 4,100 corpses recovered. The data can be searched in an online map.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014, Pablo de Greiff, a U.N. human rights expert, made recommendations to Spain on how to deal with Franco’s legacy. He advocated creating some form of truth commission, transforming the Valley of the Fallen into a true monument for reconciliation, compiling data on mass graves, annulling political convictions and ending impunity for Franco-era crimes by scrapping an amnesty law — a cornerstone of the Spanish transition to democracy, which made it illegal to prosecute Franco-era crimes in the courts.\n\nIn his report, de Greiff said it was “surprising to note that more has not been done for the rights of so many victims.”\n\nBut the conservative government under then-Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy ignored the recommendations.\n\nThe government’s plans don’t include scrapping the amnesty law or putting on trial human rights abusers from the Franco regime.\n\nThe Spanish conservatives have officially condemned Francoism repeatedly and didn’t oppose plans to unearth Franco when it was voted on in Congress in 2017 (they abstained). Yet they’ve often argued that the country risks reopening old wounds if it delves too much into the past.\n\nThere are electoral calculations behind this stance. For a long time, one of the best indicators of voting intentions in Spain was the side on which one’s relatives had fought in the civil war (those on Franco’s side and their descendants often voted for the right in the new democratic regime and vice-versa).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFernando Martínez López, the new government’s general director for historical memory, said Madrid now wants to implement most of de Greiff’s measures, adding one of their own: ban associations that glorify the dictator and his regime.\n\nYet many of those measures would need legal reform, public funds or take years — things that Sánchez’s weak administration can’t count on. Removing the remains of Franco from the Valley of the Fallen is the only one that can be relatively easily done in the short term.\n\nAlso, the government’s plans don’t include scrapping the amnesty law or putting on trial human rights abusers from the Franco regime — measures that could prove highly controversial. Some graves are still too sensitive to tread on."
