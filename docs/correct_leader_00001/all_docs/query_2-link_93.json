        "text": "Francisco Franco's eyebrows are on sale at a Madrid art fair where Spanish artists who grew up after his death are tackling the legacy of his decades-long dictatorship through irony and satire. The five-day ARCO art fair which wraps up Sunday also includes a sculpture of Franco squeezed inside a soft drinks fridge, along with a spinning bust of the dictator who died in 1975. \"The repression was so great and the dictatorship lasted so long that people ended up loving the person who took away their freedom. My generation can have a more archaeological, a more critical perspective,\" said Spanish artist Fernando Sanchez Castillo. Last year he bought Franco's former yacht, the Azor, for an undisclosed sum, and had it transformed into scrap metal which he used to make minimalistic sculptures currently on view at a Madrid gallery. The 41-year-old artist also bought two hairs from Franco's eyebrows last year from a man who says he obtained them when he made a mold of the dictator's face after he died. Castillo displayed the eyebrow hairs at ARCO inside a clear plastic bag, made visible to the art-lover by a magnifying glass, in an exhibit that is on sale for an undisclosed sum. He said putting the eyebrows on display, and transforming Franco's yacht into sculptures, is a comment on how Spain has become a \"dictatorship of the markets where anything can be bought and resold\". The artist also displayed a bust of the dictator's head set on a platform that spun around so quickly it was impossible to make out its features. \"It shows how Franco is always present even though he is not seen,\" said Castillo, referring to a 2007 \"historical memory\" law which requires plaques, statues and other symbols honouring Franco to be removed from public view. Many artists said they were inspired to tackle the topic of the dictatorship even though they had no direct experience of the regime's repression, because Franco continues to make headlines in Spain. \"Franco continues to be news, he has not disappeared,\" said Eugenio Merino, whose sculpture of the former dictator was a star controversial attraction at ARCO. In the sculpture, titled \"Always Franco\", the dictator is depicted wearing his green military uniform and dark sunglasses inside a fridge decorated with a white and red design similar to the Coca-Cola logo. Merino, who was born just months before Franco died at the age of 82, said his piece \"represents the idea that in Spain people are keeping the image of Franco alive\". \"We don't stop talking about him, debating about him. A fridge is where things are kept alive and fresh.\" He cited the trial this month of top judge Baltasar Garzon for trying to prosecute Franco-era atrocities, and a controversy over the publication last year of a favourable biography of Franco by Spain's Royal Historical Academy. The Franco Foundation, which campaigns to preserve the dictator's legacy, said Thursday it would sue Merino as well as the organisers of the art fair over the sculpture, which is on sale for 30,000 euros ($40,000). \"The work generates hate and confrontation,\" the vice president of the foundation, Jaime Alonso, was quoted as saying by Spanish media at the art fair after taking photos of the exhibit along with a notary. \"This is a serious offence against the former head of state. It is turning him into a caricature, a puppet. We can't ignore this because otherwise we will have increasingly coarse and scatological provocations.\" Other artists such as 34-year-old Paula Rubio Infante say they were motivated to produce works that deal with Franco because their relatives suffered under the dictatorship, which lasted from the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939 until the general's death. \"My grandparents and uncles were detained and tortured,\" said Infante, who had a large black and white photo of a mass grave of people killed by Franco's forces during the 1936-39 war on display at the art fair. \"We are the last generation that will hear direct testimony from the people who suffered under the regime, from our parents and grandparents. It is important to keep this collective memory alive.\""
