        "text": "In the mid-nineteen-nineties, I had to do some legal paperwork regarding an inherited property in Almuñécar, a city in Andalusia, Spain. To finalize matters, I needed the signed approval of a licensed abogado, a lawyer, who, in this case, turned out to be a local grandee. He was a silver-haired man with an imperious bearing, and his office was equally intimidating, filled with antique mahogany furniture, intricately embossed with caravels, suggesting an Age of Discovery vintage. A sympathetic clerk had warned me that, if the lawyer did not like me, my paperwork would not move forward. So, in an effort to warm him up, I remarked admiringly on the furnishings, which, he proudly informed me, were family heirlooms. Then, I asked, using the terminology common to Latin America, had his ancestors been involved in la Conquista, the Conquest of the Americas? He eyed me coldly, and said, “Eso no fue una conquista, sino una liberación”—“That was not a conquest but a liberation.”\n\nI managed to mutter something apparently amelioratory enough for him to agree to sign the papers. Still, his anger served as a reminder of how much of Spain’s national historiography remained unchallenged. At the time, although two decades had passed since the death of Francisco Franco, many Spaniards were still in denial about the horrors of the Civil War and the decades of Fascism that followed it. But the lawyer’s reaction revealed a deeper, enduring nationalistic pride in the era when Spain was a world power: before the United States took the last vestiges of its empire, after its humiliating defeat in the Spanish-American War of 1898; before it lost its Latin American colonies in the national liberation revolts of the nineteenth century; and before its Armada was crushed by the British, in 1588.\n\nThe catalyst for Spain’s shining moment was the seizure, in January, 1492, of the Andalusian city of Granada by forces fighting for the Catholic monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella. It was the last Moorish redoubt in Spain to fall, after an occupation that had lasted eight hundred years, and its capture the culmination of what Spaniards refer to as la reconquista of the country. Aided by the terror of the Spanish Inquisition, which Ferdinand and Isabella decreed as holy writ throughout their expanding kingdom, the reconquista led to the enforced conversion or expulsion of the Moors—Muslims—and the Jews, but most immediately it paved the way for the European discovery of the New World.\n\nIn April, 1492, buoyed by the seizure of Granada, Ferdinand and Isabella agreed to sponsor the Italian freebooter Christopher Columbus on his initial expedition across the Atlantic. He was to find a sea route to the Indies, conquer new lands for Spain, convert their peoples to Christianity—by force, if necessary—and bring back any riches he found. He set sail in August and, two months later, reached one of the Bahamian islands, which he duly claimed for Spain. As he later wrote to Ferdinand and Isabella, “I discovered many islands, thickly peopled, of which I took possession without resistance in the name of our most illustrious Monarch, by public proclamation and with unfurled banners.” In all, Columbus completed four transatlantic voyages, making landfall on Cuba, Hispaniola—home to present-day Haiti and the Dominican Republic—Trinidad, the Lesser Antilles, Jamaica, and the coastline of what is now Honduras and Nicaragua, among other places. These voyages were world-changing; they helped spark the Age of Discovery and European settlement in the New World, and, with it, European colonialism.\n\nColumbus began enslaving the Indigenous peoples he encountered, forcing them to mine gold. His preferred punishment for those who did not comply was, apparently, live dismemberment. Such methods earned him notoriety even among his fellow-conquistadors, and, for a time, he was stripped of his titles and properties, and was placed under arrest by the Spanish Crown. In the end, however, he was freed, and his wealth was restored. The native peoples of the Americas did not fare so well. Within fifty years of Columbus’s arrival, the aboriginal Taíno people, who lived on islands throughout the Caribbean and in Florida, were nearly wiped out. Within a hundred years, the Indigenous population of the Americas, thought to have numbered around sixty million in 1492, had fallen, through disease and hardship, to about four million.\n\nEarly last month, when President Biden proclaimed in two written statements that the national holiday that has been celebrated, since the nineteen-thirties, in October as Columbus Day would also be commemorated as Indigenous Peoples’ Day, he noted the “devastation” that the European arrival on American shores had wreaked. He wrote, “Today, let this day be one of reflection—on America’s spirit of exploration, on the courage and contributions of Italian Americans throughout the generations, on the dignity and resilience of Tribal Nations and Indigenous communities, and on the work that remains ahead of us to fulfill the promise of our Nation for all.” Biden’s statement angered some Italian Americans and conservatives, in an environment already marked by the outrage of people like Tucker Carlson, who has lately been denouncing critical race theory while pushing the racist replacement theory of history.\n\nBut, in Spain, the political right has reacted as if the national identity were at stake. In fact, the date of Columbus’s arrival in the New World, October 12th, is an official Spanish holiday known as National Day, featuring a military parade and festivities presided over by the king, in Madrid. For years, National Day has been heavily criticized by left-wing Latin American leaders. It was exported to Latin America as Día de la Hispanidad, to mark the union of the Old and New Worlds through the conquista; in some countries, it is also known as Día de la Raza—meaning, presumably, the Spanish race. Many regional governments have renamed the holiday; Mexico, for instance, declared it “Día de la Nación Pluricultural,” and in 2002, in Venezuela, Hugo Chávez inaugurated “Día de la Resistencia Indígena.” In 2019, soon after Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador took office, he wrote to King Felipe VI asking that, on behalf of his forebears, an official apology be issued to the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. The government, led by the Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, rejected the request, suggesting that the passage of time had rendered such a consideration obsolete, but it fuelled a firestorm of derision from Spain’s conservatives.\n\nThe controversy didn’t end there. In September, on the bicentennial of Mexico’s independence from Spain, Pope Francis published a missive in which he recognized the harm done to the country’s original inhabitants in the name of Catholicism. “It is necessary to reread the past, taking into account both the lights and the shadows,” he said. The conservative leader of the Madrid region, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, criticized the Pope’s pronouncement, characterizing the country’s legacy as “having brought the Spanish language, and, through our missions, Catholicism, and thus civilization and freedom, to the American continent.” The conservative former Prime Minister José María Aznar claimed that “the new communism is called indigenism.”\n\nComing just a week after the Pope’s statement, Biden’s proclamation compounded the challenge evidently felt by Spain’s right-wing politicians. Pablo Casado, the leader of the main conservative party, the Partido Popular, asked, “Does the Kingdom of Spain have to apologize because five centuries ago it discovered the New World, respected those who were there, created universities, created prosperity, built entire cities? I don’t think so.” Santiago Abascal, the leader of the far-right VOX party, now the third-largest party in the country, went further. He ridiculed Biden as a “lamentable President,” who “struggles to string words together.” Abascal insisted that “we should feel pride in what our ancestors did”—above all, for “evangelization,” an act he called “the masterpiece of the Conquest.” Spain’s colonial rule “was the best thing any country has done in the history of humanity,” he added, and had built an “empire for human rights.”"
