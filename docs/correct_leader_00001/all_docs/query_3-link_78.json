        "text": "Francisco Franco, his tomb and his legacy\n\nFifty kilometres north of Madrid, in the granite mountains of the Sierra de Guadarrama, stands the tallest stone cross built anywhere in the world. At more than 150 metres high, it looms over a vast basilica that is hewn into the rock below. The sprawling architectural ensemble, coldly symmetrical and entirely grey, is home to a Benedictine abbey, along with a religious boarding school and a hospice. There is a decent restaurant that specialises in traditional Spanish fare, and a mud-covered football pitch that comes to life whenever the pupils of the school emerge to play a match.\n\nMostly, however, this is a place of death. Known as the Valle de los Caídos, or Valley of the Fallen, it is the final resting place for more than 33,000 bodies. With one notable exception, all of them were killed during the Spanish Civil War, which lasted from 1936 to 1939. The odd one out is the man who started the bloody slaughter, and emerged from it victorious. His grave can be found right behind the high altar, at the very end of the imposing, windowless basilica: a modest granite slab, perpetually adorned with a bouquet of fresh flowers and the simplest of inscriptions: Francisco Franco.\n\nThe Spanish dictator died more than four decades ago but his resting place, much like his legacy, is far from settled. Franco’s grave had been an issue of fierce — and somewhat ritualised — controversy for many years, and it burst back onto the political agenda as soon as the Socialists returned to power in May 2018. Prime minister Pedro Sánchez announced shortly after taking office that he would push for the removal of Franco’s remains ‘immediately’, adding, ‘I believe that a mature European democracy like ours cannot have symbols that divide Spaniards.’ His announcement was followed by a vote in parliament that backed the removal of the dictator’s tomb, but — at least at the time of writing — that decision had yet to be implemented.\n\nWhat was striking, however, was just how divisive the plan to remove Franco’s grave remained, even forty years after his death. The motion to dig up his body won the support of just 176 out of 350 members of parliament, with 165 deputies abstaining. Out on the streets, Spaniards seemed equally split: one poll found just 41 per cent in favour of exhuming Franco, while 39 per cent were opposed. Curiously, a majority of Spaniards — more than 54 per cent — thought that now was not ‘a good moment to deal with this issue’.\n\nOutside Spain, Franco is often placed alongside Hitler and Mussolini as one of the continent’s most reviled twentieth century leaders, a brutal dictator who plunged his country into war and went on to preside over the death, incarceration, torture and exile of hundreds of thousands of his opponents. In Spain, however, the government pays for the upkeep of the Valle de los Caídos, tombstone and all. It forms part of the state’s Patrimonio Nacional, or National Heritage — the same status awarded to royal palaces and landmark monasteries. Hundreds of thousands come to visit the site every year. Spain’s Roman Catholic Church jealously guards its role as the custodian of the Valley, and provides the monks and priests who sanctify the vast granite complex with their daily songs and prayers.\n\nEven after four decades, there is still no national consensus on what the Civil War and Franco’s dictatorship meant. Only a tiny minority of Spaniards voice genuine nostalgia for the old regime but the number of those clamouring for a frank reassessment of the past is not large either. The former dictator and his deeds are widely shunned as a topic of conversation, whether in school, in parliament or around the family table. Polls are few and far between but when they do surface they often show a lingering sense of ambivalence, perhaps linked to the extraordinary economic boom that occurred during the later years of the Franco regime. One typical survey found that six out of ten Spaniards believe that Francoism had ‘both good sides and bad sides’.\n\nBut it is not just in the Valley that Franco continues to have his place. Despite a purge during the past decade, many Spanish cities still boast streets and squares that honour his memory and celebrate his victories and those of his generals. According to one official count conducted in 2018, there were no fewer than 1143 streets across the country that honoured Franco and other figures associated with the regime. There were entire villages that took the name of Caudillo — the title Franco claimed for himself. On the main square of Salamanca, the ancient university town in northern Castile, the portrait of Franco remained attached to one of the eighty-eight arches that showed profiles of Spanish rulers through the ages (it was finally removed in June 2017). In the Spanish enclave of Melilla, on the Moroccan coast, a small statue of the dictator looked out over the sea towards Spain. There is also a popular motorway restaurant halfway between Madrid and the southern coast that is filled with mementos and pictures of Franco, with placards disparaging democracy and recent Spanish leaders. In Madrid itself, there is a prominent foundation that is dedicated to celebrating the dictator’s life and work. Once a year, its members and other Franco sympathisers come to the Valle de los Caídos for a special mass, and to pray for his eternal soul.\n\nTo some Spaniards, the site and the annual ritual are an abomination, a stain on the country’s democratic record. They argue that Spain, perhaps uniquely in Western Europe, has never truly made an effort to confront its past. Far from allowing old wounds to heal, this failure has, they argue, kept old divisions alive, the original sin of Spanish democracy, still unatoned for after all these years. One man who believes this more strongly than most is Emilio Silva, a political scientist and journalist who rose to prominence over the past decade as the co-founder of Spain’s historical memory movement. ‘Can you imagine a church in Germany where the priest prays for the soul of Hitler? Can you imagine a square in Italy that is named after Mussolini?’ Silva asked me, over coffee in a noisy bar in Madrid.\n\nThe movement he started almost two decades ago is best known for locating and digging up the graves of Spanish Republicans killed by Franco’s Nationalists before and after the war. More than 1300 bodies have been recovered from roadside ditches and secluded forests, and accorded a proper burial. For the relatives, this process has often been momentous — allowing them finally to come to terms with six decades of pain. The broader aim of Silva and his allies is to shatter Spain’s so-called pact of forgetting — the unspoken agreement between left and right in the wake of Franco’s death to look to the future, not the past. In legal terms, that pact is cemented in the 1977 amnesty law, which shields former Franco officials — including the regime’s most notorious torturers — from criminal prosecution. Yet it is also reflected in Spain’s schools, where the history of the Civil War and Franco’s dictatorship remain marginal subjects. And it finds an echo in the singular absence of any national museum or monument — aside from the Valley — to commemorate the war. ‘We are a country full of ignorance,’ remarked Silva. ‘If there wasn’t so much ignorance, Franco would no longer be there [in the basilica]. For a society with even a little bit of understanding, it would simply be intolerable.’\n\nFrancisco Franco Bahamonde was born in 1892, in the Galician coastal town of El Ferrol. He was supposed to follow the family tradition and join the Spanish navy, but the Spanish-American war of 1898 and the resulting loss of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines had sharply reduced the need for new cadets. Franco joined the army instead, where he rose swiftly through the ranks. He became the youngest captain in the Spanish armed forces, then the youngest major, the youngest colonel and finally the youngest general. He made his mark as a commander in Spain’s Foreign Legion in Morocco, which was engaged in a savage, decades-long campaign to quell anti-colonial uprisings. A dedicated soldier who neither drank nor womanised, he was known as a cruel disciplinarian who had no qualms about his troops mutilating the bodies of the enemy. His physical appearance was less than imposing — he was short, and even as a young man he had a pot belly and a high-pitched voice — but Franco quickly gained the respect of his men as a fearless commander, often riding into battle on a white horse that made him an easy target. As a young man he showed little interest in politics or religion, though he did develop an intense hatred of both communism and freemasonry. Like many of his fellow soldiers, he had little regard for democracy, blaming the humiliating loss of Spain’s colonies on the weakness of the Republican leadership. Throughout his life, contemporaries would describe him as aloof, controlled, impassionate and utterly cold. As the British historian Hugh Thomas recounts:\n\nThe failure of humane democracy in Spain had given way to one of the coldest-hearted men, a man intolerant of human foibles, humourless but able, calm and determined. One day in winter, Bernhardt [ Johannes Bernhardt, a German SS general based in Madrid] was lunching with Franco (whom he admired). The question came up as to what to do with four militiawomen, captured, armed with rifles. Franco believed that all women captured in arms should be shot. ‘There is nothing else to be done’, he said, ‘shoot them’, without changing the tone that he would use for a discussion of the weather.\n\nFranco biographies are packed with similar tales. In the immediate aftermath of the war, determined to ‘cleanse’ Spain of all traces of Republican resistance, the dictator signed thousands of death sentences — casually, over coffee, often in the presence of his personal priest.\n\nPaul Preston, another British historian writing on Spain, has used the word holocaust to describe the mass slaughter ordered by Franco both during and after the war (though he also insists that the scale does not compare to the systematic murder of the Jews by Nazi Germany). By his estimate, Franco was responsible for the murder of more than 200,000 people during and after the war, on top of the 200,000 soldiers who had died in battle and an unknown number of civilian victims of the fighting.\n\nThe historical parallels with Hitler and Mussolini are hard to ignore, not least because German and Italian support proved instrumental during the war itself. But Franco did two things that neither of the other two dictators managed: he knew when to stop, and he knew how to survive. The first point is crucial. Despite pressure from Germany, Franco kept Spain neutral during the Second World War. Had he joined the Axis powers, his rule would undoubtedly have ended in 1945, if not earlier. Instead, he held on to power until his death in 1975 — long enough to regain the favour of Western allies such as the US, and to preside over an economic recovery that went at least some way towards changing Spanish perceptions of the dictator. The dictadura became a dictablanda — a soft dictatorship. Spain in the 1960s and 1970s was a repressive authoritarian regime, a grey backwater cut off from the European mainstream, a country where a woman needed her husband’s permission to conduct even the simplest legal or commercial transaction, and where opposition activists were persecuted and jailed without mercy. But as long as you played by the rules of the Franco regime, you had little to fear from the government. Over time, the space allowed for artistic expression and economic activity grew. Directors such as Luis Buñuel, Carlos Saura and Luis García Berlanga made some superb, even subversive, films under Franco. And bankers and businessmen with the right connections made plenty of money.\n\nHere lies one of the roots of today’s ambivalence towards Franco: if he had died in 1939 or 1940, Spain might have remembered him only as a monster. But large parts of Spanish society came to acquire a more complex memory of the man and his deeds in the decades thereafter. I had to think of a line from Sonnenallee, a 1999 film about growing up in Communist East Germany: ‘There once was a country and I lived in it,’ the narrator says at the end. ‘And if you ask me what it was like I will say: it was the best time of my life. Because I was young and I was in love.’ Normal people in other words, don’t think, judge and remember like historians. For many Spaniards of the post-war era, Franco was a brooding presence in the background, as they went about their daily lives, getting married, having children, buying cars and going to the seaside. The revulsion felt by Silva and others was widespread, but it was far from universal.\n\nTo its defenders, the Valle de los Caídos is, above all, a site of mourning and reconciliation. They point out that the mass tombs that line those heavy granite walls hold the dead of both sides. But they often fail to mention that the Republican dead were brought to the mausoleum without consulting their families — or, in some cases against the express wishes of relatives. Neither do they question why any Republican would wish to be buried in a tomb built with the help of Republican slave labour, and laden with Francoist and fascist imagery.\n\nAt least once a year, the notion of reconciliation becomes impossible to maintain. Every 20 November, the anniversary of Franco’s death, his supporters arrive from all over the country, and beyond, for a special mass. I have rarely had cause to attend Catholic mass during my life but even regular worshippers are likely to leave this particular ceremony in a state of dazed wonderment. Part of this has to do with the sheer sense of drama. At the precise moment of the transubstantiation, when the bread and wine are ritually converted into the body and blood of Christ, the vast underground basilica is plunged into sudden darkness. An invisible helper turns off all lights, save for a single spot that is directed at the body of Christ on the cross, along with the hands of the priest holding aloft the wafer. The priest, who is also the abbot of the Valley’s Benedictine monastery, then starts his homily with a prayer for the soul of Francisco Franco and José Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of Spain’s fascist Falange movement. Both men died on 20 November but were separated by a political eternity: Franco passed away in his bed, peacefully, after thirty-six years of unopposed rule. Primo de Rivera was killed by a Republican firing squad in 1936, just months after the start of Spain’s Civil War. The two bodies occupy pride of place in the gloomy basilica, buried in front and behind the altar. Standing at the lectern just above, the priest praised the two fascist leaders for their decision to ‘forgive their enemies and seek their forgiveness for themselves’.\n\nWhen I visited, I was told that some worshippers might offer a fascist salute, but I had not expected arms to be raised quite so brazenly. Some made a discreet, hasty salute on their way to receive Holy Communion, but all inhibitions melted away once the priests, monks and choirboys had left the church. Franco’s grave was quickly surrounded by dozens of admirers. They laid down red flowers and knelt to touch the rough, grey stone. Some said a personal prayer. Dozens straightened their backs and offered the raised-arm salute, while friends and wives snapped pictures. Shouts of ‘Viva Franco!’ and ‘Viva España!’ echoed through the vast basilica. Neither the guards from Spain’s National Heritage nor the remaining monk tried to intervene.\n\nStanding quietly among the crowd was a tall, middle-aged man called Jaime Alonso, the vice-president and spokesman of the Francisco Franco Foundation and the public face of hardcore Francoism in Spain today. I saw him whisper a prayer and cross himself but he quickly turned away from the more raucous crowd surrounding the dictator’s grave. Impeccably dressed and softly spoken, Alonso is a lawyer by profession and Francoist by passion. Armed with a wealth of numbers, dates and facts, he made a resolute case in Franco’s defence when I caught up with him back in Madrid. He told me he had grown up with a vision of Franco as the ‘father of the nation’, and still viewed him as ‘the man of providence who came to save Spain’. Selfless, upright, a brilliant military commander and great political strategist, Franco was hailed as a towering figure in Spanish history, comparable only to the medieval rulers who drove the Moors from Spain in 1492, or the great kings who held sway over an empire stretching from Peru to the Philippines. Alonso vigorously defended Franco’s military putsch against the country’s elected government in 1936, which marked the start of the Civil War, insisting it was a necessary step to put an end to the chaos and violence of the period. ‘There was no other option. They could either fight or let themselves be killed,’ he said. Franco’s post-war achievements were no less significant, Alonso argued. ‘In Franco’s Spain, at least towards the later years, no one was hungry. Everyone had a car, a home, a television set. There was social security, paid holidays and health insurance … He created a middle class.’\n\nThe Franco foundation was located in a third-floor apartment just up the road from Real Madrid’s imposing Bernabéu stadium. It was a large space but slightly dusty, and seemed to be in need of renovation. The offices were packed with memorabilia, signed photos, oil paintings, thousands of books and an archive. Aside from myself, the only visitors to the foundation all looked old enough to remember the days of the Caudillo from personal experience. There was even a small souvenir shop, where visitors could pick up a Franco ashtray for €4.50. For all his enthusiasm, Alonso admitted that there were few genuine Francoists left in Spain today. Since the return of parliamentary democracy, there had only been one openly Francoist member of parliament. Even during the recent economic crisis, with millions of Spaniards desperately searching for work, there had been no sign of revival in Francoist sentiment.\n\nIn late 2018, a new far-right party called Vox did emerge as a genuine contender in Spanish politics. But it also seemed clear that its success had more to do with the Catalan crisis and migration worries than with any desire to turn back the clock to the Franco era. Alonso himself, however, remained convinced that Franco lived on. Why else, he asked, would the country’s political mainstream be so silent about his rule? ‘They are afraid of him. They know very well that Franco is more than just a reference, that he is something embedded in the culture of the Spanish people as a solution. Today, even if everything falls apart, we have a national ideal that stays with us and that is passed on in our genes. How can Francoism revive today? As bad as the situation is, the idea is there.’\n\nWhat was striking was not so much the historical narrative put forward by the Franco Foundation but the absence of any official challenge to it. I asked countless Spaniards what they were taught about the Civil War in school. The answer was, almost invariably, nothing. Spain’s parties have never been able to agree on a joint condemnation of the Franco dictatorship, or given an official apology to its victims. There has been no official commission, no national museum offering a unified narrative. Historians such as Paul Preston argue that this silence — coupled with the effort by Franco loyalists to preserve the dictator’s reputation — has helped create an image that is far more benign than the man deserved.\n\nTo this day, General Franco and his regime enjoy a relatively good press. This derives from a series of persistent myths about the benefits of his rule. Along with a carefully constructed idea that he masterminded Spain’s economic ‘miracle’ in the 1960s and heroically kept his country out of the Second World War, there are numerous falsifications about the origins of his regime. These derive from the initial lie that the Spanish Civil War was a necessary war fought to save the country from Communist take-over. The success of this fabrication influences much writing on the Spanish Civil War to depict it as a conflict between two more or less equal sides. The issue of innocent civilian casualties is subsumed into that concept and thereby ‘normalized’.\n\nAmong mainstream historians this benign view of Franco is now indeed widely discredited. But it lives on, consciously or not, in some sectors of Spanish society. The idea that Franco did what he had to in 1936, that the Red Terror (the atrocities committed by the Republican side) were as bad or even worse than those committed by Franco’s Nationalists, or that post-war Francoist Spain was a country of law, order, justice and progress — all these notions can be, and are, expressed openly in Spain today. Not by many, to be sure, but one does not have to look too hard to come across them.\n\nOne place where Francoist sentiment and aesthetics survive in particularly unabashed form is inside Casa Pepe, a popular motorway restaurant on the A-4, about 250 kilometres south of the Spanish capital. Located conveniently on the halfway mark between Madrid and the Andalusian coast, the restaurant has been a stop for travellers for many years. With the outside painted in the colours of the Spanish flag, there is nothing subtle about Casa Pepe. Entering the bar, I came face to face with hundreds of photos, pictures and old newspaper cuttings of and about Franco. There were ‘pre-constitutional’ flags showing the Francoist eagle, and banners of the Falange. Hanging above the bar were caricatures of left-wing politicians and a sign that read: ‘With Franco: 40 years of peace, justice and liberty. And with democracy: Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!!!’\n\nThe adjoining shop offered a bewildering selection of Francoist souvenirs and memorabilia: wine bottles with the face of Franco on the label, bars of chocolate emblazoned with the Franco-era slogan Arriba España! (‘Up Spain!’), Franco T-shirts, Falangist pottery and baseball caps bearing the emblem of the División Azul, the Spanish division that fought alongside Nazi Germany on the Eastern Front. It was macabre, strange, repulsive — but also slightly trivial. The bar looked and felt like a fairground attraction, a house of horrors that happened also to serve ham sandwiches and cold beer. Some guests seemed to delight in the surroundings but most looked as if they had been drawn to the restaurant, like myself, largely out of curiosity. Still, it seemed remarkable that a place like Casa Pepe could survive, and indeed commercially thrive, so many years after the death of Franco — and after so many thousands of books and articles had detailed the crimes of his regime.\n\nI grew up in Germany, where Vergangenheitsbewältigung (the process of coming to terms with the past) was seen as a collective national duty, so the existence of a place like Casa Pepe spoke to me of a lax — even careless — approach to history. But perhaps I was wrong. In some ways, the survival of this roadside inn represented the opposite of carelessness: it was still here because Spain’s transition to democracy was based on a truce that had been successful — and that few dared to question. Casa Pepe was here for the same reason that Franco’s body was still in the Valle de los Caídos: because Spain’s present — for all its economic and political difficulties — seemed too precious to contaminate with arguments about the past. I didn’t want the government to shut down Casa Pepe either, but I wanted its owners and customers to realise that it was offensive, insensitive and wrong to keep it as it is. I left without ordering anything. Not that it made any difference: when I drove off, the parking area was even fuller than when I had arrived.\n\nFor the Spanish writer Javier Cercas, the interplay of memory and history, and the stories people tell themselves about the past, have long been a subject of fascination. His 2001 book Soldiers of Salamis is widely hailed as one of the great novels about the Civil War. I called him up in late 2015, a few weeks after the release of another book, The Imposter, which dealt once again with history, war, terror — and the lies they bring forth. The book contained an entire chapter about Spain’s own struggle — and ultimate failure — to come to terms with its history. ‘A country must have a basic accord about the past,’ Cercas told me. ‘Britain has it. Germany has it. All the strong democracies have this basic accord. But Spain hasn’t.’ The reason for this, he argued, was obvious: ‘There was no rupture in Spain after Francoism. There was a transition, there was peaceful and progressive change from dictatorship to democracy. This means that the Spanish right did not break completely with Francoism. It would be wrong and absurd to say that the Spanish right is Francoist. It obviously isn’t. But it has never been able to bring itself to condemn Francoism.’\n\nNot everyone I spoke to was convinced that this mattered. José María de Areilza, a professor of law at Esade business school and former government adviser, spoke for many when he argued that Spain was right to look to the future and ‘leave the past to the historians’. ‘There is no one way to deal with the past,’ he told me. ‘Franco died in his bed. But everything that has happened in Spain since has condemned him. He is being condemned every day by the normal functioning of our democracy, by our constitution. Spain has moved on by doing, by acting.’\n\nThis also rang true. I found it hard to make up my mind. Part of me was scandalised by Spain’s lack of historical rigour, and the nation’s willingness to tolerate the overt celebration of Franco and his legacy. But it was also clear that Spain’s decision to look to the future, not the past, had been broadly vindicated. The dwindling band of genuine Franco supporters in modern Spain posed no threat to democracy (as Alonso had explained to me, ‘we do nothing to subvert the system, the system will subvert itself ’). The armed forces were no longer plotting a return to the old days. Why devote political capital and energy on an issue that the majority of Spaniards showed little interest in? Why reopen a tacit accord that had paved the way for four decades of peace, stability, liberty and prosperity?\n\nFor Cercas, however, the country’s failure openly to confront the past left Spain in a state of heightened fragility. ‘If there is no accord over the past, then the past can always be used, can always be manipulated,’ he said. ‘There is no accord over our past, and that means that finding an accord over our present and our future is much more difficult. Can we live with this? Yes, we can live with this. But would we live better if we had a common narrative? We would live much better.’\n\nThe most ambitious attempt to challenge the pact of forgetting came under the Socialist government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the prime minister from 2004 to 2011. The Zapatero government provided public funding to unearth Republican war graves, and passed a law calling for the removal of Francoist statues and street names. It faced bitter opposition from the centre-right Popular party, and from Spain’s Roman Catholic Church (which had served as a pillar of the Franco regime). At the height of the controversy, the country’s conference of bishops published a searing attack on the government, saying it was ‘opening old wounds’ and ‘threatening the tranquil coexistence’. The archbishop of Madrid put it even more bluntly. Sometimes, he remarked, ‘one has to know how to forget’.\n\nTowards the end of its tenure, the Zapatero government decided to tackle the biggest totem of them all: the Valley of the Fallen. It appointed a commission of experts and asked it to draw up proposals for an overhaul of the site. The commission was formally established in May 2011 — just six months before a general election that Zapatero knew he would lose. Whatever conclusions its members would reach, they were almost certain to be filed away the very instant the new centre-right government took over.\n\nFrancisco Ferrándiz knew he was part of an exercise in futility but he decided to accept the invitation to join the commission all the same. A social anthropologist at Spain’s National Research Council, he had closely followed the work of the historical memory movement. Here was a chance to shape the debate over one of the most contentious monuments in the world. ‘We didn’t want to impose a narrative. We wanted to create the conditions for a debate in society that could come up with some kind of consensus about the monument,’ Ferrándiz told me. ‘I think you have to confront these things at some point. Some countries have done this through truth and reconciliation commissions but in Spain it was just glossed over.’\n\nIn the end, after much internal wrangling, the commission called for a radical overhaul: it suggested removing Franco’s grave from the basilica and burying him elsewhere, and transferring the body of Primo de Rivera from its privileged site to one of the mass graves that lined the church. Just as importantly, they wanted to convert the sections of the site that housed the dead into a national cemetery — and so remove the graves from the care of the monks. As expected, the document was shelved immediately by the new government. Asked about the future of the Valle de los Caídos in 2013, the deputy prime minister fell back on the Popular party’s standard line that any change required the ‘consensus’ of all parties. That consensus, of course, remained elusive for as long as the PP was in power. For much of its first term in office, the government of Mariano Rajoy was consumed by the economic crisis, and by the never-ending corruption revelations. Whenever I asked a government official about the Valle de los Caídos, or about revisiting Spain’s approach to the Franco dictatorship, they would stare at me in disbelief. For them, this chapter had been closed long ago. But the plan drawn up by Ferrándiz and his colleagues was not forgotten. In early 2017, the Socialists and Podemos joined forces in parliament to push through a non-binding resolution calling for the removal of Franco’s grave. The following year, Spain’s moribund left suddenly found itself back in power. Shortly after taking over the job of prime minister, Pedro Sánchez revived the 2017 motion, and the original plan to remake the Valle de los Caídos– and finally remove the body of Franco.\n\nSánchez seemed genuine in his belief that the monument in its current form was an outrage, but the plan also made sense politically. As the leader of a minority government, the new prime minister lacked the strength in parliament to push through ambitious economic or social reforms. Exhuming Franco was a proposal that a majority of deputies — from his own party, from Podemos, and from regional parties in Catalonia and the Basque country — could rally behind. It also placed the Popular party and Ciudadanos in an uncomfortable position. Neither wanted to be seen as defending Franco, but nor were they keen to hand an easy victory to Sánchez. In the end, both parties abstained. Pablo Casado, the man who replaced Mariano Rajoy as leader of the PP, denounced the move as a ‘smokescreen’ to hide the government’s weakness.\n\nMuch as Spaniards want to move on from Franco’s legacy, it has a habit of popping up, sometimes in the most unexpected of places. In September 2016 I interviewed a researcher at the University of Glasgow who had made a curious discovery while analysing the Spanish edition of Ian Fleming’s spy thriller Dr. No. As he compared the translation with the original, Jordi Cornella realised that there were striking differences. ‘The last chapter of Dr. No was totally distorted because they took out a couple of pages with sexual references. I thought this must be a mistake but then I started researching and found other examples.’\n\nCornella had stumbled across the work of Franco’s censors, a joyless caste of editors tasked with removing any content from novels, plays and movies that ran counter to the dictator’s ideology. Criticism of Franco himself, passages about the Civil War, sentences that were deemed too sexually explicit or hostile to the Church were removed or rewritten. The problem was that — in some instances at least — these changes were never rectified. To this day, key works by Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, James Baldwin, Dashiell Hammett and John Dos Passos — to name but a few — are available in Spain only in the version approved by Franco’s censors. ‘The problem now is that these versions appear even in ebooks, so you can say that censorship is still alive and well in Spain,’ Cornella explained. ‘This is a legacy of the Franco regime that is somehow invisible. It is there, but readers don’t know about it.’\n\nJames Bond, the womanising spy at the heart of Fleming’s fictional series, suffered particularly gravely at the hands of Franco’s censors. Many of his graphic sexual exploits were missing from the Spanish versions of the books decades after the end of the dictatorship. In the case of Hemingway’s Across the River, even recent Spanish editions included a string of changes made by the censors. A reference to ‘lesbians’ in the original text is still translated as ‘good friends’ in the current Spanish hardback edition. A reference to ‘General Fat Ass Franco’ in the English text appeared as the unspecific ‘General Asno Gordo’ (or fat donkey) in a 2001 paperback. Coarse language and Hemingwayesque insults such as ‘son of a bitch’ have been toned down throughout the text. Here was a small but telling example of the enduring legacy of the dictatorship. Over the course of Franco’s long rule, Spanish publishers released close to 500,000 books, all of which had to pass the censors. No one knows how many of these titles were amended or cut, and how many censored editions are still in print. But it is clear that Spanish readers may have to live with the censor’s changes for many years to come. Books, as Cornella remarked, ‘have a very long life’.\n\nThe task of purging Franco and his regime from public spaces has proved no less difficult. As mentioned above, despite the efforts of the Zapatero government, city maps across the country have continued to show streets and squares named after the dictator, or honouring his generals and supporters. Locals had lived with these, and other reminders of Franco, for so long they no longer seemed to offend. But they did offend a new wave of politicians who won control of Spanish cities in the aftermath of the crisis. The 2015 local elections marked a triumph for Podemos, even if the party itself did not stand in the elections. Instead, Podemos joined forces with other grassroots activists to set up local offshoots — such as Ahora Madrid (Now Madrid) — that in turn fielded a string of charismatic and popular candidates. The results were spectacular: Podemos allies won the city halls of Madrid, Barcelona, Zaragoza, Cádiz, La Coruña and a long list of smaller towns and municipalities. Equipped with slender majorities and little experience, many of the new mayors made symbolist politics an early priority.\n\nAmong them was Manuela Carmena, the mayor of Madrid, whose administration announced, a few months after taking office, that it would rename thirty streets and squares in the capital (the list would later rise to fifty-two). Only one of the names referred to Franco himself: the Plaza de Caudillo. Most of the remaining sites honoured generals who had taken part in the 1936 military uprising against the Spanish Republic, and who served in the bloody civil war that followed. They included the generals Yagüe, Mola, Varela and Fanjul as well as General Millán Astray, founder of the Spanish legion and an early propagandist for Franco. The plan also called for a renaming of Plaza Arriba España, as well as the Calle de los Caídos de la División Azul. In their place, the Madrid government wanted to honour men and women who had set a different kind of example. Among the proposed new names was Julián Besteiro, a Socialist politician who had died in a Francoist prison in 1940; Robert Capa, the celebrated war photographer, and Max Aub, a writer and diplomat who had helped secure Picasso’s anti-war painting Guernica for the Spanish pavilion at the 1937 international exposition in Paris. The plan met fierce resistance from the Popular party, with one local leader denouncing the renaming exercise as an ‘attempt to promote division and confrontation based on the Civil War, 80 years after the fact’.\n\nAs expected, the effort created plenty of controversy, and headlines both in the Spanish and the international press. What it did not do was make much difference on the ground. More than two years after Carmena took office, not one street name had been changed in the capital. Swamped by a series of law suits from right-wing groups, including the Franco Foundation, the municipality announced in July 2017 that it was freezing the plan. The battle for memory had turned into trench warfare; progress, if there was any at all, would have to be measured in inches.\n\nFor all his frustration with the failure to overhaul the Valle de los Caídos, Ferrándiz, the anthropologist, had not lost hope that a new generation of Spaniards would eventually demand a less circumspect approach towards the country’s past. He pointed out that Spain’s political order had come under scrutiny as never before in the years after the crisis. The transition itself had become almost a dirty word for a new generation of political activists who were desperate to sweep away what they saw as a deeply corrupt system. ‘We had the prestigious transition that is being taught all over the world as an example of how to move cleanly from a dictatorship to democracy. Now we find that this transition is under fire because it glossed over some of the thorniest issues of the dictatorship — and let the perpetrators die in bed without ever facing their responsibility. Now we have a new generation saying: “We have to face this.” ’\n\nThe younger generation of Spaniards has indeed freed itself of the old fears and reflexes regarding Franco, but most prefer to focus on other issues — issues that seem more burning and relevant than the legacy of dictatorship. ‘Franco represents everything I don’t like about Spain and about Spanish history — the ultra-right, the relationship between church and state and the whole communion-and-daily-mass way of life,’ Sagrario Monedero, a political activist in her early thirties who works for a non-governmental organisation in Madrid, told me. ‘But he is also a bit of a comical figure — this small man with a pot belly and a high-pitched voice,’ she added. Like a growing number of young Spaniards, Monedero has never visited the Valley of the Fallen. She regards the monument as an outrage but also suggests that her generation sees no urgent need to tackle the Franco legacy. ‘History has already given its verdict.’\n\nIt is an argument that goes a long way towards explaining the indifference about Franco in Spain today. But if history has indeed given its verdict, why has it not been executed? Why has it been so hard for Spanish democracy to touch that brooding mausoleum in the mountains? ‘Let’s take this terrible monument as an opportunity,’ said Ferrándiz. ‘It is the biggest Francoist monument of them all, and it is where all the complexities come together. If the debate has to happen somewhere, if we are to find a consensus about our history, it has to be around the Valley.’\n\nSooner or later, Franco’s remains may be exhumed, and reburied in a different, less exalted place. But even if the grave is finally broken open, the removal of the dead dictator’s bones will be nothing more than a political gesture as long as there is no broader debate — and no wider consensus — regarding his position in Spanish history. The reluctance to have that debate remains palpable, despite the apparent flurry of activity by the Sánchez government.\n\nYet eight decades after the end of the civil war, is it not time for Spain to build a new memorial to the victims? Eight decades later, should there not be a national museum to tell the story of what happened, and why? More than four decades after Franco’s death, is it not time to shift perceptions as well as tombstones? Reaching a national consensus remains elusive, however, and those monuments and memorials remain unbuilt. All we have is that vast granite mausoleum in the mountains above Madrid, that will be Franco’s for years to come, no matter where his body lies"
