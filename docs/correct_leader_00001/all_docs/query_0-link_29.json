        "text": "In the Spanish Capital, the actions of certain armed militias of the workers party and unions lead to waves of murders in summer 1936 against suspects of being part of the “Fifth Column” or sympathizing with the revolt. These groups acted out of the courts and confiscated the goods of the arrested after murdering them, like this Milicia Popular de Investigación, called “The Squadron of Dawn” that appears in the picture lead by Agapito Garcia Atadell, (with glasses), and surrounded by some of the militiamen that worked under his command. When the nationals approached Madrid, in November 1936, Atadell fled to France, and later attempted to reach America from Marseille with substantial loot. However his boat made a stopover in a dock in the Canary Islands and Garcia Atadell was arrested and, later, executed by the rebels. Madrid 8/18/1936\n\nFrom November 1936, the republicans managed to impose their authority over the autonomous anarchist groups and militias of the different parties that acted on their own and they created the seed of the future republican army that was always subject to intromissions by the different political parties. They all took part in the repression, including the government with help of the soviets, when a part of the political prisoners were transferred to Valencia that ended in a massive firing line in the outskirts of Madrid. In the picture, anarchists part of the “Ateneo Libertario de las Cuarenta Fanegas”\n\nThe republican propaganda and of the several parties that formed the Frente Popular as well as the anarchists was very superior to the one of the Nationalists during the whole war, partly because the best illustrators were sympathizers with the republic, like Mauricio Amster or the communist Josep Renau.\n\nIn the image, a poster by the Propaganda Section of the Public Instruction Ministry encouraging the people of Madrid to defend the capital. Madrid, November 1936.\n\nWhile the first to help the revolted were the fascist Italian regime and Germany under Hitler, the Spanish republic received the support of Stalin’s USSR, what gave great influence to the Spanish communist party to both government and population. As is seen in the image the Soviet Union Friends Association did a constant work of propaganda pro-soviets. Here you see some sympathizers carrying a bulletin board commemorating the 19th anniversary of the Russian revolution. Madrid, November 1936.\n\nAlso Madrid got full of posters that depicted the Soviet Leaders, particularly Joseph Stalin, for all kind of reasons and within the personality cult that totalitarian regimes leaders received. Alike to Hitler in Nazi Germany and Mussolini in Fascist Italy. This poster, placed in the downtown square of Madrid of the Puerta del Sol is a portrait of Stalin and a fragment of a letter sent by him to the Spanish “Antifascists” commemorating the 19th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. Madrid, 11/11/1936.\n\nGENERAL VARELA\n\nGeneral José Enrique Varela, one of the most important generals in Franco’s army during the civil war, was born in San Fernando (Cádiz) on April the 17th 1891 and commanded the national offensive against Madrid in 1936. Son of a military, he fought in the colonial war in the north of Morocco, then a Spanish colony, and was granted the most honored medal in Spain, the Cruz Laureada de San Fernando. Of traditional ideology he revolted in 1932 against the republic formed in 1931 and he was arrested for it. He recovered his freedom two years later and was promoted to the rank of general. He took part preparing the military coup of July the 18th 1936, that initiated the civil war.\n\nOnce the war ended he was designated minister of the army in general Francisco Franco’s first government, though political differences with him made him friendlier to the allies. In 1942 Franco accepted his resign as minister and in 1945 he was appointed High Commissioner of Spain in Morocco. On march the 24th 1951 he died in Tangier (Morocco).\n\nIn the picture, the final offensive of the revolted troops against the republican Madrid was leaded by general José Enrique Varela Iglesias. Here we see him with a Moroccan djellaba in a town in the Madrid frontline during the Spanish Civil War. Madrid, around November 1936.\n\nGENERAL MIAJA\n\nGeneral José Miaja Menant, key figure of the republican forces during the defense of Madrid in the Spanish Civil War, was born in Oviedo in april the 20th 1878 and died exiled in Mexico in January the 14th 1958. His career was the military and took part in the colonial war in Morocco. Promoted to general in 1932 during the 2nd Republic he was appointed minister of war four years later. In face of the advances of the national troops, the republican government moved to Valencia and entrusted him the defense of the capital, managing to halt the enemy in Ciudad Universitaria, west from the city.\n\nGeneral Miaja was also the republican leader in other significant battles, in fact during the war he held more military power than any other republican general.\n\nGroup of soldiers of the international brigades of the “Commune de Paris” battalion, who joined the11th Brigade when they reached Madrid. They wore an ample beret of the French alpine and a leather jerkin of English origin. The international brigades, troops formed by volunteers of 54 countries were created by the communist international and peaked up to 40000 combatants in different moments (of which 10000 were French) and became decisive in stopping the national offensive in Ciudad Universitaria. Madrid 11/8/1936.\n\nAnarchist leader Buenaventura Durruti (c), was the leader of the column that had his name, he was an archetype of an active anarchist before and during the Civil War, and after taking part in different combats during the initial months in the Civil War, he died in Ciudad Universitaria on November the 20th victim of a stray bullet. In the image he’s with second lieutenant Antonino Uriel (2nd R) and a reporter of a republican newspaper. Around November 1936.\n\n“There are only two outcomes, victory for the working class, freedom or victory for the fascist which means tyranny. Both sides know what awaits the looser. We are ready to end up fascism once and for all despite the Republican government” Buenaventura Durruti\n\nThe Soviet Union supplied the Republic with 700 airplanes and 400 tanks, besides weapons, technicians, pilots, military advisers and espionage agents, besides that also food clothes and fuel partly payed by popular donations partly with the gold reserves of the bank of Spain. The Russian tanks T-26 manned by soviets and the Russian airplanes took part in the battle of Madrid.\n\nIn the image you can see republican soldiers that salute with their fists up riding a T 26-B Tank of soviet manufacture in the Madrid frontline, around 1937.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church was hounded in many parts of the republican Spain due to the anticlericalism of certain political parties and sided with the rebels. Eventually it became one of the pillars of the new regime that was being created in the National Spain directed by general Francisco Franco once general Mola died in an airplane accident. In the picture you see a priest celebrating communion facing the republican positions during the celebration of epiphany. Guadarrama Range in the north of Madrid 1/6/1937.\n\nCommunist leader Enrique Líster was entrusted the defense of a sector of the city during the Battle of Madrid, commanding the first Joint Brigade of the EPR. He later was in charge of one of the best divisions of the republican army that took part in the toughest battles. In the image he’s seen with officers and soldiers of his division after the battle of Brunete. July 1937."
