MORE INFO

Born Under A Bad Sign is Albert Kings legendary first album for Stax Records, and features Booker T. & The MGs and the Memphis Horns. The Indianola, Mississippi-born King of the Blues Guitar, cemented his legacy with this debut set. While hed recorded for labels like Vee-Jay, Parrot and Bobbin, it was his chemistry with the Stax team  label executives Al Bell, Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton, songwriters Booker T. Jones and William Bell, and backing from Booker T. & the MGs and the Memphis Horns  that put King on the blues map. Kings first Stax recording was Laundromat Blues, included on this album. Booker T. Jones and Stax soul singer William Bell came up with the thundering bass riff that defined the title track Born Under a Bad Sign. The song notched #49 on the R&B chart in 1967. The album has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and included in Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. This ALL-ANALOG reissue has been mastered from the original mono tapes by Kevin Gray at Cohearent Audio and pressed on 180-gram vinyl at Memphis Record Pressing. The mono mix of this album has been unavailable on vinyl since the album's original 1967 release.
