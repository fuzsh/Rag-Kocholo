        "text": "Yes it is a great song and there is another song that borrowed a lot from Big Bird..Savoy Brown must have liked it to. I remember buying the Savoy Brown album this was one and thinking,this song sounds familiar\n\nJohnny Taylor and the band taking Jonny Mercer & Harold Arlen's \"Blues in the Night\" down home, the early albums are full of unexpected gems like this, it's why I think the essence of Stax is in the album filler and B-sides, not the hits as great as they are. This album also has selections written by Herbie Hancock and Merle Travis, all given the Stax treatment.\n\n\"Make It Me\" is great. I first heard it on the Complete Singles 1959-1968 box set. I also really liked \"I'm Going Home\" by Prince Conley, \"Don't Be Afraid Of Love\" by Oscar Mack, \"Please Return To Me\" by The Fleets, \"Why Should I Suffer With The Blues\" by The Canes and \"In The Twilight Zone\" by The Astors as songs I hadn't known before the set.\n\nYes but it was recorded at Stax studios and the regular Stax guys (Cropper, Dunn, Hayes...) were the ones who played on it, although it's true that, technically, it is not a Stax song.\n\nWritten by Steve Cropper and Eddie Floyd, so to me it is a Stax song that happened to come out on Atlantic.\n\nA really good album. The Japanese looking (a lot of them were actually manufactured in Europe) set of CD reissues of loads this stuff from a few years ago were a godsend! Loads of albums that are very hard to find in the UK available very cheap, just simple reissues with mostly good mastering. I bought loads of them, probably the majority.\n\nI think I have a Japanese LP reissue, my collection is a mishmash of originals and various reissue series.\n\nI do have some nice original Stax and Atlantic LPs, but not loads. They're difficult to find in the first place, then they're usually well played and worn out and the mastering is mediocre on a lot of the UK pressings for some reason. Because of all that most of this music I have on CD.\n\nIt's a great record, but it was recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio by their regular session players, so to some it's not really Stax.\n\nso i can post Atlantic as well?\n\nEnterprise makes it difficult enough\n\ntrue that.\n\nBut the thread title says STAX records….\n\nThe record - the physical object with the hole in the middle - says Atlantic…\n\nSo…\n\nnot a STAX record…\n\nJus’ saying…\n\nLol\n\nThis one's worse. Same guy, probably same recording session. I can't go beyond 15 seconds of this. Absolutely brutal.\n\nSame here. I have great memories of listening to it in my fathers car as a young lad."
