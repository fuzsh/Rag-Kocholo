        "text": "A companion to both Live Wire/Blues Power and Wednesday Night in San Francisco, this album finds Albert King placing his distinctive stamp on tunes associated with Freddie King, B.B. King, T-Bone Walker, Charles Brown, and others, as well as reprising several of his own past recordings. The Fillmore Auditorium, with its strangely garbed hippies and psychedelic light shows, may have seemed odd to the veteran bluesman, but it didnâ€™t show in these stellar performances. His music, honed on the so-called chitlin circuit, fit handily into the currents of rock music during that period, allowing him to easily win over these newfound fans while maintaining total artistic integrity.\n\nwith Willie James Exon, James Washington, Roosevelt Pointer, Theotis Morgan"
