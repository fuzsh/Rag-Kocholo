        "text": "After the original Stax building was demolished in 1989 leaving only a barren lot, the Stax Museum opened its doors to great international fanfare in May 2003 and has since received more than a million visitors. The museum experience includes permanent exhibits such as a circa-1906 authentic Mississippi Delta church to illustrate soul music’s Black gospel influence, a recreation of the original recording studio and control room, an Express Yourself Dance Floor with looping Soul Train television footage, a Hall of Records with some 900 45-singles and 300 LPs, and Isaac Hayes’ gold-trimmed, fur-lined 1972 Cadillac Eldorado complete with a television and refrigerator. The museum also features a changing gallery, interactive exhibits, films, listening stations, and more than 3,000 items of memorabilia including stage costumes, photographs, documents, personal items that belonged to Stax Records stars, and instruments and vintage recording equipment used at Stax."
