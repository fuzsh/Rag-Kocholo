        "text": "“Do you like good music, that sweet soul music, just as long as it’s swinging, oh yeah, oh yeah.”\n\nAbove are the opening lyrics to Arthur Conley’s 1967 smash hit “Sweet Soul Music” which was co-written by Otis Redding, Sam Cooke and Conley. This song remains a shining example of excellent soul singles released by Stax Records, which had recording studios in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nWith this month’s music blog message, I am featuring some of the most beloved Southern soul music singles from Stax Records. I will countdown my baker’s dozen: what I consider to be the 13 best and most influential Stax soul top 40 hits spanning from 1965 until 1972.\n\nBefore I share my selections, I want to give a brief history of Stax which was founded during 1957. This Memphis recording company was on the forefront with the advancement of Southern Black Music: Soul, rhythm and blues, gospel and funk.\n\nStax became the second largest company producing soul music, just behind Motown Records of Detroit, Michigan during the mid 60s to early 70s.\n\nAccording to the current 2023 Stax Records Dot Com website: “Stax placed more than 167 hit songs in the Top 100 on the pop charts, and a staggering 243 hits in the Top 100 R&B charts.”\n\nWhen discussing the early years of Stax, it must be noted that there were other record label names associated with the Memphis music company: the biggest in this category is Volt Records. It was founded in 1961 as a Stax subsidiary R&B label.\n\nMusic recorded by Stax/Volt Records and other subsidiary labels during the early years (1957-1968) was distributed by ATCO Records, which was owned by Atlantic Records.\n\nAfter Atlantic departed ways with Stax, the company was independent until 1972 when CBS Records distributed for the Memphis organization. Five years later, Fantasy Records bought Stax as the label had declared bankruptcy.\n\nBelow are the criterion I am using for my Stax/Volt soul singles countdown:\n\nOnly one song per artist. This will allow 13 different recording acts to be a part of the countdown instead of multiple songs from a singer like Otis Redding.\n\nSong was a Top 10 hit on Billboard’s Hot R&B (Soul) singles chart.\n\nSelection also was a crossover hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking #30 or higher.\n\nBelow are excellent Stax soul singles outside of my countdown. Songs listed in random order and not ranked:\n\nGroovin’ – Booker T. and the MG’s – 1967\n\nHang ‘Em High – Booker T. and the MG’s – 1968\n\nHold on!

Inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. “Mustang Sally” is on Rolling Stone’s “500 Greatest Songs of all-time” listing.\n\n(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay—Otis Redding (1967)\n\nOtis Redding is regarded as one of the all-time greatest singers of the 20th Century. Known as the “King of Soul”, this singer-songwriter gave spirited concert performances during his short music career.\n\nAs a songwriter, Redding penned the song “Respect” that Aretha Franklin covered and turned into a massive hit. Another well-known song by the King of Soul” is “Try a Little Tenderness.”\n\n“(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay” by Redding is my number one top selection on my countdown of the best Stax songs of all-time. Redding recorded this composition 3 days before he perished in a plane crash near Madison, Wisconsin on December 10, 1967.\n\nReleased as a single during January 1968, “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay” became the first posthumous number 1 song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. It remains one of the most iconic top 40 singles of the 60s.\n\nDuring 1969, Redding received 2 posthumous Grammy Awards for his best known and well-loved signature song. Without a doubt, I have “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay” as the #1 greatest Stax superb soul single ever made.\n\nThat wraps up what I consider to be the 13 essential Stax/Volt soul singles from the 60s and 70s. I completely understand that my listing of songs in this category was written from my point of view and is subjective.\n\nIf you were creating a similar register of excellent soul hits, your tabulation may be totally different. What do you consider to be the best musical tunes in this category? I hope you will comment below.\n\nListening to Southern soul singles from Stax Records will always have a special place in my heart. I still cherish and fondly remember every song on my countdown.
