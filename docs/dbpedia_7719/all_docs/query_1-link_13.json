Stax was also integrated, with Black and white musicians working together like a family, until it eventually became one of the largest Black-owned record labels in the world.\n\nAnd yet, in 1975, Stax Records was forced into involuntary bankruptcy. The bank gave the building to a nearby church for $10, and, in 1989, the building had fallen into such a state of disrepair that the church demolished it, leaving only a barren lot with a single historical marker to alert visitors that this had once been the home of Stax Records."
