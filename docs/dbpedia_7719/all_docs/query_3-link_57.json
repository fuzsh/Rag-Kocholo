        "text": "For any soul music fans out there, PBS is premiering a documentary tonight called Respect Yourself - The Stax Record Story. Besides showing musical performances by the likes of Otis Redding and Booker T & the MGs, the documentary will examine Stax's relationship with the Civil Rights movement.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nFrom the PBS Great Performances Website\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/stax/index.html:\n\nRESPECT YOURSELF: THE STAX RECORDS STORY premieres on August 1, 2007 on PBS (check local listings).\n\nBetween 1959 and 1975, Stax Records in Memphis, Tennessee released international chart-topping hits such as \"Soul Man,\" \"Dock of the Bay,\" \"Green Onions,\" \"Midnight Hour,\" \"Respect Yourself,\" and the theme from SHAFT. The label's artists included Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Booker T. & the MGs, Wilson Pickett, Isaac Hayes, and even Richard Pryor and Jesse Jackson. Founded by a white conservative bank teller who played country fiddle music, Stax became the preeminent soul music label in America, and became identified with the civil rights movement of the 1960s and '70s. RESPECT YOURSELF documents the Stax label, its visionaries, and most of all, its music.\n\nAlthough started by a white banker and his sister, Estelle Axton, Stax eventually became one of the largest and most successful black-owned companies in the country before it was forced into bankruptcy due to financial and legal troubles in 1975. The label was resurrected in December 2006 and Concord Records, which acquired it, has been issuing new albums, re-releasing classics from the original catalogue, and mounting special Stax Revue concerts across the country. The legacy of Stax and the artists who recorded there is also being kept alive by the Stax Museum of American Soul Music, now located at the site of the former studio on the corner of McLemore Avenue and College Street in Memphis. Discover more about the origins of Stax, initially called Satellite Records; the convergence of black and white music at the studio; and the first songs that put the label on the map in the essay by contributor Robert Gordon. Read an excerpt from Gordon's book IT CAME FROM MEMPHIS, about the city that gave rise to not only Stax but also two other venerable music labels, Sun and Hi Records, as well as the Delta blues. Watch performances by Otis Redding, Booker T. & the MG's, and the Staple Singers, and find a directory of the music from the program in the song list."
