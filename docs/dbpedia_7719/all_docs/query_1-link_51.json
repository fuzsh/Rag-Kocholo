        "text": "The STAX RECORDS story, from its beginning in an old movie theater on East McLemore Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee, to its extraordinary rise as an international hit-making machine, is an indispensable chapter in American musical history. Amid the civil rights-era racial strife and deep-seated tensions of the late '50s and '60s, Stax's integrated artist roster and staff fundamentally shaped American soul music, spawning the careers of recording artists, songwriters and producers such as Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, Booker T. & the MG's, The Staple Singers, Albert King, Johnnie Taylor, Eddie Floyd, The Bar-Kays, Sam & Dave, William Bell, David Porter, Shirley Brown, The Mar-Keys, Steve Cropper, The Mad Lads and Rufus and Carla Thomas, just to name a few.\n\nStax released more than 800 singles and nearly 300 LPs, picking up eight GRAMMYs and an ACADEMY AWARD along the way. In all, Stax placed more than 167 hit songs in the Top 100 pop charts, and a staggering 243 hits in the Top 100 R&B charts. Today, the original site of Stax Records is a multimillion- dollar campus that includes the Stax Museum of American Soul Music, Stax Music Academy and The Soulsville Charter School. The Soulsville Foundation's two youth programs serve primarily at-risk, inner city youth who are carrying the unique legacy of Stax Records into the future for generations to come.\n\nConcord Music, which acquired the legendary Memphis label as part of its purchase of Fantasy Records in 2004, has since honored Stax's unique legacy, releasing definitive collections, rare performances, unreleased tracks and more, in deluxe, new packages via Craft Recordings. Additionally, Concord Music has reactivated Stax as a dynamic new force in soul music committed to the power and legacy of their forbearers. Recent releases include critically acclaimed new recordings from Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats, William Bell, Ben Harper and Southern Avenue.\n\nStax Ultimate Giveaway\n\nUse this form to enter The Current's Ultimate Stax giveaway between 10 a.m. CST on Sunday, December 10 and 11:59 p.m. CST on Sunday, December 17, 2017.\n\nOne (1) winner will recieve an ulitmate Stax Records 60th Anniversary prize package, including:\n\nStax 60th Anniversary 60-track, 3CD set Soulsville U.S.A.: A Celebration of Stax; Isaac Hayes Spirit Of Memphis CD box set, assorted vinyl from classic and new Stax artists; Stax Classics Concord CDs: William Bell, The Dramatics, Johnnie Taylor, Albert King, The Staples Singers, a Stax tote bag and more!\n\nThree (3) back up names will be drawn.\n\nPrize retail value: $300.00\n\nWe will contact the winner on Wednesday, December 20, 2017.
