        "text": "Born Under a Bad Sign is the second compilation album by American blues musician Albert King, released in August 1967 by Stax Records. The album features eleven electric blues tracks recorded between March 1966 and June 1967 across five different sessions, with King accompanied by two bands: Booker T. & the M.G.'s and the Memphis Horns. While the album did not chart, it garnered critical acclaim and is often regarded as one of the greatest blues albums ever. It has influenced numerous guitarists, including Eric Clapton, Mike Bloomfield, Jimi Hendrix, and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Born Under a Bad Sign has been honoured by several music institutions, including induction into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame, the Grammy Hall of Fame, and the National Recording Registry.\n\nTracklist:\n\nSide A\n\n1.
