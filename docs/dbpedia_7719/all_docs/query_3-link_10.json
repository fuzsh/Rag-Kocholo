        "text": "By 1965, Stax was doing well and had scored a few top 40 hits. Rufus Thomas’ “Walking the Dog.” William Bell’s “You Don’t Miss Your Water (Till Your Well Runs Dry).” Booker T. & the MGs’ “Green Onions.” The little Memphis label had grown strong enough to earn a deal with Atlantic Records to distribute its records.\n\nIn those early days, one of Stax’s best friends was the African-American Memphis DJ Al Bell (née Alvertis Isbell). Bell spun records at WLOK and was a fixture in Estelle’s Satellite Record Shop. Stewart had met Bell in 1959 when he was promoting the first single that Stax recorded for a black group, the Veltones. Late in 1963, Bell took a big-market job in Washington, but in 1965, Jim Stewart asked Bell to return to Memphis and join Stax as its promotion director.\n\nRoss: Can you talk about a little bit about Al Bell, beginning with when Jim Stewart first brought him in?\n\nGordon: Well, when Jim has his (first African-American group) Veltones early on, he's got to go to the black radio stations to promote it. Al Bell was a black disc jockey, and he remembers meeting Jim there. Al makes a name for himself on WLOK and gets a job in an even bigger market in Washington. A couple or three years pass, and Stax is having hits. They are aware that their hits could be bigger if they had a promoter on staff, because they were relying on Atlantic but they realized that Atlantic promoted its own records first. Al is the one they think of, and they have to draw him back to town.\n\nRoss: You write that Jim Stewart actually offered Al Bell equity in the company, a pretty bold act at the time.\n\nGordon: He was drawn by equity in the company and also by a return to his home and knowing that this was an enterprise he could help build.\n\nRoss: I was particularly touched by the scene in your book of these two executives in Memphis in the 1960s, one black and one white, sharing an office.\n\nGordon: Yeah, Jim is on one side and Al is on the other, and they would share a desk. Not only were they going to share a desk, but they were going to share a telephone. But what doesn't happen is what Al feared — which would be that Jim would pick up the phone to make his call, pull his handkerchief out of his pocket and give the earpiece and the receiver a wipe-down to, you know, wipe off the black. And with that assurance and that sense of equality, Al Bell was off and running.\n\nBy 1965, Stax had developed what Gordon calls “a Midas touch.” Almost everything the label released climbed the R&B charts, and many of its hits were crossing over to the pop charts. Atlantic Records, which was already distributing Stax’s records nationwide, began to send its own artists to Memphis to record. From 1965 to 1968, Stax gave birth to a remarkable string of hits from Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, Eddie Floyd and many others. And during those years, the people of Stax were living in a world of their own making — one quite different from the world that existed outside their studio’s doors.\n\nRoss: There was this dichotomy going on. When they were in the Stax studio, it was an integrated environment, but then when they took the music on the road, they were back in the segregated reality of the time.\n\nGordon: It was a revolution, nothing short of a revolution. That’s what makes this story so epic. They stuck to what they thought was right.\n\nRoss: And they did have one place they could go for fun outside the studio, and that was the Lorraine Motel, which would soon become famous as the site of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination.\n\nGordon: You know, Stax had no air conditioning, and so the guys would have to cool off. The MG’s could make international hits together, but they couldn’t go to a burger stand to be served together. But at the Lorraine they could. At the Lorraine, they could swim in the pool together unbothered. They could be served coffee and a sandwich at the coffee shop of the Lorraine. And the Lorraine was where Stax housed its visiting artists, such as Wilson Pickett. They had a good relationship with the owners of the motel.\n\nRoss: But then, on April 4, 1968, Dr. King was killed there.\n\nGordon: Like Booker said, “It couldn’t have happened any closer to us than to have happened at that motel.”\n\nRoss: Everything changed after that, right?\n\nGordon: Yes. Three events happened between late December of 1967 and April 1968 brought the company to a screeching halt. On Dec. 6, Otis Redding goes on a three-day weekend gig and his plane goes down. Not only do they lose Otis, but they also lose the Bar-Kays. The Bar-Kays are kind of the heart of his band, and they represent the next generation. They're kids from the neighborhood who had come into Stax and were adopted by the MG’s. Then, a few weeks later, Atlantic is given an offer it can't refuse to sell itself to Warner Bros.\n\nRoss: And you write in your book about how Jim Stewart, when Atlantic was bought, discovered that he had unintentionally signed away the rights to the master recordings of Stax’s biggest hits when he’d signed his distribution deal with Atlantic.\n\nGordon: Yes. That’s the second thing. For a company that had just lost its star, it just seems like unbearable news to learn. But it was there in black and white. Jim Stewart had signed away their catalogue. And then Martin Luther King gets assassinated at the Lorraine, which was their home away from home. So for all intents and purposes, the label is dead. The energy of the label is dead. Everyone here is crushed, but that’s when Al Bell had new ideas.\n\nRoss: Like what?\n\nGordon: Bell said, “Well, what do we have? We have a studio. We have artists. Let’s create a new catalogue, let’s find someone to finance us and let’s rev the engine.”"
