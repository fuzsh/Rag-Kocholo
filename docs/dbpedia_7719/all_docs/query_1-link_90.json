He particularly recalled the strange sounding music he heard a man playing at a train station in Tutwiler, Mississippi: The Blues. Handy received his first big break when his band was asked to play for Memphis political boss, Edward H. Crump. Handy’s band had a song called “Mr. Crump.” The title was later changed to “The Memphis Blues” which was the first blues ballad Handy ever wrote, and arguably the first blues ballad in history. After publishing the song himself in 1912, “The Memphis Blues” became popular all over the United States. Handy went on to open up a Memphis-based music publishing firm, and in 1917 moved the company to New York City.\n\n36 – Isaac Hayes\n\n(1942 – 2008)\n\nIsaac Hayes was born in 1942 in Covington, Tennessee, and was raised by his maternal grandparents.

Hayes and lyricist David Porter soon became a notable songwriting team at Stax. Hayes released his first album “Introducing Isaac Hayes” in 1967, but did not gain a following until his “Hot Buttered Soul” album made the pop and R&B charts in 1969.

Unable to break into the Sun Records label’s stable of male artists, Jackson created Moon Records in 1956 to record her own single, “Beboppers Christmas,” which led her to release additional rockabilly singles by other small bands, and is widely thought to be the first woman to produce, engineer, arrange and promote music on her own rock and rollmusic label.
