        "text": "I always preferred B.B.'s material when he was backed by a smaller band and not an orchestra with strings added and everything.\n\nThe live albums in general tend to be better in this regard.\n\nI really like B.B. King's ABC records from the late '60s and early '70s, with \"Indianola Mississippi Seeds\" being the best one--great tracks with Leon Russell and Carole King. Like other posters mentioned, he was really engaged with the popular music of the time. I think that one was also one of B.B.'s own personal favorites. I also think that his first live album with Bobby Bland, \"Together for the First Time...Live\", is a blast.\n\nHe recorded many albums for the Crown label, while his releases on RPM and Kent were 45's. Crown marketed B.B. King LP's as bargain bin rack-fodder; they were displayed alongside Hawaiian, Dixieland, Movies & Shows and Sing-a-long records. The albums were distinctive though; the quartet recordings of My Kind Of Blues, the all-instrumental Easy Listening Blues, his Sings Spirituals album, on which I detect no guitar. In later years, some producers also focused on King's voice rather than his instrumental prowess.\n\nIt can be intimidating trying to explore such a deep catalog, but it's worth it.\n\nRE: Albert King;\n\nBorn Under a Bad Sign\n\nI'll Play the Blues For You\n\nI Wanna Get Funky- the STAX rhythm section here really shines\n\nAn often overlooked gem in the Albert catalog is The Pinch from 1977. Available on CD as The Blues Don't Change.\n\nSome have mentioned Freddy/ie King as well, might as well keep going and add Earl King to the list.\n\nI actually have the album cover for Born Under a Bad Sign tattooed on my left hand. I'm a fan...\n\nThe Rhino comp is called \"The Ultimate Collection\" and is a fabulous 2CD set from 1993 for anyone wanting to know.\n\nGreat, great studio examples here.\n\nBlues At Sunrise was recorded in 1973 in Montreux and is worth mentioning for Albert's stunning cover of Ray Charles' I Believe To My Soul & for the greatest live version of his own \"I'll Play The Blues For You\" you could imagine!\n\nA truly wicked tone throughout.\n\nNo. It is the Montreux Festival performance from 1977. AFAIK it's the only way to get the complete performance of the Albert Live on cd.\n\nI have AK's Live Wire/Blues Power, In Session (with SRV), and the following two comps:\n\nI believe King of the Blues Guitar contains all of the tracks from the album, Born Under a Bad Sign, plus an additional half dozen tracks.\n\nAfter reading some of the comments on this thread, I may need to supplement my collection with a few additional CDs.\n\nThe Fillmore live shows are decent, but, the rhythm section was too thin for my tastes, the 1977 Montreux show mentioned above has a fantastic full sound. Worth tracking down, most of the show is on a CD simply titled \"Live\" available by Charly and Rhino.\n\nMost of Albert's early '70s albums are worth buying. Lovejoy is another decent album. But, the ones I listed are in my opinion fully realized albums, and not so much left over tracks. His later work on Tomato label isn't bad either."
