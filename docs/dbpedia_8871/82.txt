Bratislava also known by other alternative names) is the capital of Slovakia, and with a population of about 500,000, the country's largest city. The first known permanent settlement of the area began with the Linear Pottery Culture, around 5000 BC in the Neolithic era. About 200 BC, the Celtic Boii tribe founded the first significant settlement, a fortified town known as an oppidum. They also established a mint, producing silver coins known as biatecs.[12] The area fell under Roman influence from the 1st to the 4th century AD and was made part of the Limes Romanus, a border defence system.[13] The Romans introduced grape growing to the area and began a tradition of winemaking, which survives to the present. In the 10th century, the territory of Pressburg (what would later become Pozsony county) became part of Hungary (called "the Kingdom of Hungary" from 1000). It developed as a key economic and administrative centre on the kingdom's frontier. The city became a coronation town and the seat of kings, archbishops (1543), the nobility and all major organisations and offices. Between 1536 and 1830, eleven Hungarian kings and queens were crowned at St. Martin's Cathedral.
