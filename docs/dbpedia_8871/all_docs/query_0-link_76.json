The first memory of Skalica dates back to 1217 when it was called Zakulcza. In the 14th century it became a market town and in 1372 a full independent \"free royal town\" with all the rights connected to this status. Among these rights there was the so-called \"right of the sword\", i.e. the possibility of judging and executing people. In this period the town walls were also built. In 1442 the monks of St. Francis came to town, during the 17th century also other orders like Jesuits, friars of St. Paul and Carmelites arrived. Skalica became as important as Bratislava, Trnava or Kosice. The citizens of Skalica were known for their handmade works and wine. At the end of the 18th century and in the 19th century important industries were founded: chemical, textile and leather industries. In the second half of the 19th century Skalica became an important center of national cultural life. Cultural clubs were founded and newspapers were edited. In 1885-1889 a railway to Bratislava was built and in 1893 a second one to Morava. In the 20th century Skalica became an important center of polygraphy. An important tradition of the people of Skalica is the viticulture. Source: the Skalica website.\n\nJarig Bakker\n\nSkalica (Hungarian: Szakolca; German: Skalitz has 14.748 inhabitants (1990 census).
