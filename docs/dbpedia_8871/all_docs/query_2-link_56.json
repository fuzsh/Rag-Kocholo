        "text": "A brief history of the Historical Building of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, Župné Square\n\nThe National Council Building of the Slovak Republic on Župné Square, as it appears today, came about by a gradual construction process. At the beginning of 18th century, a baroque church with a trinitarian monastery was built on the grounds in front of Michalska Gate, where a medieval settlement and St. Michael’s church stood in middle ages. The one-storey monastery had a typical four-winged layout with a central courtyard (current eastern courtyard, so-called “atrium“).\n\nAfter the dissolution of trinitarians by Joseph II in 1783, the monastery was temporarily used as a military hospital and as early as the beginning of 19th century, it is documented that Bratislava castle was used as a hospital (in the northern bastion). Thus, around the turn of 18th and 19th centuries, the vacant monastery started to be used as “a County House of the County of Bratislava”. Due to the lack of capacity, the County House was rebuilt and extended several times: at the turn of 18th and 19th centuries, during the first quarter of the 19th century and again during the period of 1844-1847 in this phase, development of the western wing was completed, creating today’s western courtyard (“carpark”), the main facade was adapted in a neo-classical style, with much of the interior renovation carried out in the same style. We can see on the main facade the year 1848 (in Roman numerals) and the County´s crest (a wheel with a half-figure of a stag, the symbol of the Pálfys noble house, who were hereditary governors of the Bratislava County). Ignác Feigler was the architect of the historical building’s reconstruction during the 1840s and was the most distinguished member of famous builders’ family. With these modifications, the construction process of the building was finished. The County House is a protected architectural and historical monument, registered in the Central Register of the Cultural Monuments.\n\nDeclaration of Sovereignty of Slovak Republic was adopted here, in 1992."
