        "text": "Naturally, they are not exact “twins”. Vienna is Bratislava’s bigger, more famous and historically more important sister. Nevertheless, significant influence on all levels can be perceived by each visitor. Numerous buildings and statues in Bratislava were built by the Viennese. If choosing one sculptor for all, let’s mention Viktor Tilgner, Austrian artist, whose connection between the both cities cannot be forgotten. He was born in Bratislava, and died in Vienna. Most of his works he did for Vienna, often you pass beside them without noticing. But he never forgot his birth place and gave to our city probably the most beautiful fountain just outside of the opera house (the old building of the Slovak National Theatre) – Ganymede’s fountain.\n\nLast but not least we cannot forget gastro! What comes to your mind if Vienna is discussed? Wiener Schnitzel, right? And this used to be and partially still ranks among the most popular dishes in Bratislava.\n\nHyperloop – the proximity of these two capitals lead Elon Musk to consider construction of the futuristic hyperloop between them. The project was designed the way that you would reach the other city as fast as in 8 minutes! The project – not surprisingly remained on the paper (although the plan in 2013 said that in 2020 it should be launched already).\n\nNevertheless, apart from numerous trains and buses you can feel the Danube River between Vienna and Bratislava by taking the modern catamaran “Twin City Liner”.\n\nAnd while Bratislava – strangely for us – ranks just as the 113th most liveable city in the world to live in, Vienna is at its very top! “Vienna scores with its very good medical care and an extremely broad range of cultural and leisure activities“."
