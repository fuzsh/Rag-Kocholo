        "text": "Bratislavsky kraj\n\nLast modified: 2018-12-19 by rob raeside\n\nKeywords: bratislava region |\n\nLinks: FOTW homepage | search | disclaimer and copyright | write us | mirrors\n\nby Jarig Bakker, 11 Dec 2002\n\nadopted 12 Dec 2001\n\nBratislava region flag\n\nBratislava region hanging flag\n\nBratislava region President's flag\n\nBratislava region emblem\n\nSee also:\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovakian regional flags\n\nBratislava region\n\nBratislava region flag\n\nToday I recieved an answer from \"Urad Bratislavskeho samospravneho kraja\" regarding its flag. The attached image was made in Microsoft Excel (!) and presented as hanging vertically. It is another example of \"Kosice pattern\".\n\nDescription ( from the hoist to the fly): quartered field with vertical line in 1/3 of the field (although we see it like a horizontal line :-); first and 4th fields are blue (i. e. upper left and lower right field), 2nd field (upper right one) is yellow and 3rd field (lower left) white. So probably the white field would be upper fly, if the flag were horizontally hung.\n\nIt really seems like try to introduce an official model for regional flags in Slovakia, however Trencín and Presov Regions spoiled this \"splendid unity\" with striped fields.\n\nAleš Křížan, 4 Dec 2002\n\nThis site (at this time working - click \"Symboly\") shows it with yellow field in canton (upper hoist) and white field in lower fly. There is also bigger image of Coat of Arms (wavy bar represents rivers Danube, Morava and their confluence in Bratislava - Devin) and official seal.\n\nAleš Křížan, 11 Dec 2002\n\nBratislava region hanging flag\n\nby Jarig Bakker, 11 Dec 2002\n\nBratislava region President's flag\n\nby Jens Pattke, 28 Jan 2006\n\nBratislava region emblem\n\nby Jens Pattke, 28 Jan 2006\n\nYesterday I foud out newly adopted Coat of Arms of Bratislavsky samospravny kraj (Bratislava self- governed region) or rather Vyšší územný celok (Higher territorial unit) Bratislavský. The matter of Slovak subdivisions is more complicated that it seems to be. Nowadays on regional level there are State adminstrative offices called Krajske urady (sg. Krajsky úrad) with a Head called \"prednosta\" and Self- government entities called Vyššie územné celky (Higher territorial units, sg. Vyšší územný celok - VÚC). Elected representation of Self governning is led by Chairman of VUC (\"predseda VÚC\"). \"Zupan\" is unofficial title. \"Prednosta\" is an appointed officer, \"predseda\" is elected member of regional parliament. To make things more complicated (even I don't understand the system) also VÚC has its own office called Úrad samosprávneho kraja or something. Nowadays both kind of Regions has the same territory, but self- government is fighting with state administration for buildings etc. and changes of number of VÚC are discussed. Nobody nows, how many VÚC will Slovakia have in the end of this year (and how many flags they will have: ). Maybe some more historical provincial symbols will be restored and some provinces too.\n\nBratislavský samosprávny kraj / Self-governing Bratislava region - Some excerpts from Slovak press, concerning this region:\n\nFrom \"stolice\" through \"counties/župy\" to \"samosprávne kraje\" 21.12.2001 TA SR (Press Agency of the Slovak Republic)\n\nBratislava December 21 (TASR) -\n\nApproved Arms of Bratislavský samosprávny kraj will symbolise respect to almost 450 Years of Self - Government in Bratislava region. This is also the reason (according to Higher Territorial Unit Chairman (\"predseda Vyššieho územného celku/VÚC\") Lubo Roman),why is it so close to Coat of Arms of Hereditary Counts of Bratislava (of Pálffy. In contradiction to Pállfy Arms, (Azure on a Triple Mount Vert a Half Wheel Or (sometimes Gules) a Stag rising Or) in Arms of VÚC was triple hill replaced by a wavy bar. The latter should point out historical and contemporary geopolitical meaning of Danubian City Bratislava. VÚC are today wrongly seen and compared with historical counties (\"župy, sg. župa). Their development begun in post-revolution Years 1848 - 1849 and ended in 1928. ... they replaced self- governed \"stolice\" (Sedes in Latin, Stühle in German) of nobility. Origin of it we can find in the begin of 14. Cent. ...\n\nIn fact the name of historical County and of the city before 1919 was Pozsony, in German Presburg, in Slovakian Prešporok, which were the names of Bratislava before\n\nSo Bratislavský kraj has PROPOSAL for its Arms, modelled by historical Pozsony Province. We don't know, if the Ministry of Intern (supreme heraldical authority in Slovakia) already granted these symbols.\n\nRegional parliaments members pledge of representative 19.12.2001 SITA (whole name of this Press Agency unknown to me) Pledge of representative was taken by Chairman of Bratislavský samosprávny kraj Lubo Roman and by present representatives the regional parliament (altogether 46 members) on today's festival in Primaciálny palác in Bratislava. Bratislavský\n\nsamosprávny kraj will be characterised by yellow - blue - white flag, seal and Arms with depiction of a stag and Danube, which should remain family of hereditary Counts (župan, Ispán) Pálffy....\n\nAleš Křížan, 21 Mar 2002\n\nThe origin of the Coat of Arms of Bratislava Region:\n\nThe Coat of Arms of Pozsony county, Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nSee Ralf Hartemink's site:\n\nUsed ~1599-1920.\n\nThis Coat of Arms was originally the Coat of Arms of the Pálffy family. The Pálffy family became the Lord Lieutenant of Pozsony county after general Nicolaus Pálffy reoccupied Castle of Győr from the Turkish.\n\nThe origin of the Pálffy's Coa was the Coat of Arms of the Erdődy family formerly Bakócz family. The Coat of Arms relates to an accidents with a deer....\n\nThe former Pozsony county was 4370 km2. 4323 km2 was detached to Czechoslovakia by the Treaty of Trianon (1920), 43 km2 was detached to Czechoslovakia by the Treaty of Paris (1947). Now 4 km2 of the formerly Pozsony county is part of Hungary\n\nIstván Molnár, 21 Mar 2002"
