        "text": "The Romanesque church dedicated to the Most Holy Savior that once stood on its site was built between 1204 and 1221. It became a parish church at the beginning of the 14th century. This church was expanded in Gothic style between 1311 and 1314. The Gothic constructions lasted for centuries. During the reign of King Matthias of Hungary, the church was expanded to its current size in late Gothic style between 1467 and 1487.\n\nArchbishop Esterházy Imre of Esztergom ordered the addition of the Baroque Chapel of St. John the Almsgiver to the north side of the church in 1732. It is the artwork of Georg Rafael Donner. Donner also created the equestrian statue of St. Martin dressed in Hungarian Hussar costume. The statue was part of the former main altar, but now it stands in the southern nave of the church.\n\nThe church was renovated between 1863 and 1878 in Neo-Gothic style according to the plans of Lippert Jézsef. 11 kings and 8 queens of Hungary were crowned in the church between 1563 and 1830 (of whom 10 kings and 1 queen were actually ruling).\n\nThe tower of the church is 85 meters high and on top of the spire the 164 centimeters tall copy of the Holy Crown of Hungary weighing 150 kilograms can be seen.\n\nSeveral famous Hungarians rest in the crypt of the church, including Archbishop Pázmány Péter, the founder of the University of Nagyszombat (now ELTE in Budapest).\n\nThe codex containing one of the oldest Hungarian-language text, the Funeral Cermon and Prayer dating back to 1192, was found in the church by the Jesuit monk Pray György in 1770.\n\nThe new Danube-bridge (UFO) and the related road infrastructure built by Czechoslovakia in the 20th century cut the church from the Castle Hill and resulted in the destruction of a large part of the old town of Pozsony.\n\nArchbishop Batthyány József of Esztergom ordered the construction of the palace, which took place between 1778 and 1781 according to the plans of Melchior Hefele. The tympanum is decorated by the archbishop's coat of arms and his cardinal's hat.\n\nThe Peace of Pozsony was signed in its Mirror Room on December 26, 1805 after the united Austrian and Russian army was defeated by Napoleon in the battle of Austerlitz. Emperor Ferdinand V signed the so-called April Laws here on April 11, 1848. The laws demanded by the Hungarian Revolution abolished the serfdom among other things and converted Hungary to a constitutional monarchy.\n\nIn 1849 Haynau signed the death sentences of the Hungarian revolutionaries here after the Habsburgs managed to suppress the Hungarian Revolution with Russian help. Batthiány Lajos, the first Hungarian prime minister, 13 generals of the Hungarian War of Independence and many revolutionaries were executed. There is a series of 17th century English gobelins (tapestry) in the palace depicting the tragic love of Hero and Leander. The gobelins were purchased by Archbishop Batthyány Lajos from Cardinal Mazarin.\n\nThe chapel of St. László can be found in the palace and the fountain of St. George the Dragon Slayer is in its inner courtyard.\n\nThe Franciscan monastery was established after the Mongol invasion in 1241-1242. The construction of the church was ordered by King László IV of Hungary in 1290. It was consecrated in 1297 in the presence of King Andrew III of Hungary. The two-story chapel of St. John on the northern side of the church dates back to 1380. After the earthquakes in 1586 and in 1590, the church was reconstructed in Renaissance style by 1619. There is a Chapel of Loretto on its northern side from 1708. Its western facade comes from 1745 and its furnishing was made in the 18th century. Its main altar was made in the 18th century and it contains the statues of St. Stephen of Hungary and his son, St. lmre.\n\nThe construction of the tower had been continuous since 1410 and it gained its current form in 1897 according to the plans of Schulek Frigyes. Its original Gothic spire can be found in a town park in Pozsonyligetfalu, south of the Danube.\n\nFrom 1563 to 1830 the kings of Hungary knighted the worthy nobles to knights of the golden spur after the coronation ceremony in this church.\n\nThe northwestern gate of the town of Pozsony was called St. Lawrence's Gate and it led to the village of Szentlőrinc (St Lawrence). Its first parish church was the Chapel of St. James, and its ruins can be inspected under a glass roof. It was a round chapel built around 1100, and a Gothic cemetery chapel was built on its site in the 14th century. The St. Lawrence's church was a three-nave Gothic church built a few meters to the north of the chapel at the beginning of the 14th century. The church was modified in the 15th century and in 1529 it was demolished due to defense concerns with respect to the Turkish threat. In 1774 the cemetery, the St. James's chapel, the St. Lawrence's Gate and the town walls were all demolished. They marked the location of the foundation walls of St. Lawrence's church in the pavement.\n\nThe church was constructed in the first half of the 14th century on the site of the former Cistercian church.\n\nIts tower was built in the 15th century. The monastery was reconstructed in the 17th century in Renaissance style. After the battle of Mohács the Dominican nuns of the monastery on Margaret Island found refuge in the Clarissan monastery of Pozsony, and they brought with them the earthly remains of St. Margaret of Hungary. According to the tradition the relics were walled up in the crypt of the church in 1782, when the order was banned by the impious Emperor Joseph II, and they are still there. Later the Catholic grammar school and the Academy of Law moved to the monastery. The tower was restored between 1888 and 1889 in Neo-Gothic style by the architect Schulek Frigyes.\n\nThe monastery functions as library, while the church serves as gallery and concert hall.\n\nThe Capuchin monks settled down in Pozsony at the end of the 17th century. They started to build the church in 1708 from the contribution of Countess Eleonóra Terézia. The first mess was conducted by Archbishop Keresztély Ágost of Esztergom in 1709. The monastery was built between 1711 and 1717 and was consecrated by Bishop Erdődy László of Nyitra. The monastery was expanded in 1727. The church had to be rebuilt between 1735 and 1737, because its foundation sank. Its Baroque main altar was created in 1737 by the Capuchin Father Berthold, and it depicts St. Stephen of Hungary in the company of his son St. Imre as he offers the crown to Virgin Mary, patron saint of Hungary.\n\nThe side altars of St. Francis of Assisi and St. Anthony of Padua were painted by Anton Karl Rosier in 1737. The organ loft and the new organ was made between 1819 and 1824.\n\nThe church was reconstructed to its current Neo-Romanesque and Neo-Gothic style between 1860 and 1861 according to the plans of Feigler Ignác Jr. The sculpture of St. Stephen of Hungary stands in the niche above the entrance. There is a Baroque lmmaculata column in front of the church from 1725.\n\nThe building was mentioned for the first time in the 14th century. Its oldest western part dates back to 1288 and it was the Gothic house of town judge Jakab. It was purchased by the town in 1387 and the second part with the pointed arches and the tower was added at that time. The tower originally served as a chapel. The gate was built around 1442. The Renaissance arcade courtyard was constructed in 1581. In the 16th century the neighboring Unger house was integrated into the building. The tower was reconstructed in Baroque style at the end of the 17th century. The Rococo palace of the Hungarian Appony family was incorporated into the town hall in 1867.\n\nAt present the building hosts the Town Museum and the Town Archives.\n\nThe Baroque building of the barracks was built in 1763 according to the plans of Franz Anton Hillebrandt. It could host two entire infantry regiments.\n\nThe building was also used as prison. Baron Mednyánszky László, a major in the Hungarian War of Independence between 1848 and 1849, spent his last night in its prison cell. Under his command the small Hungarian garrison of Liptóvár resisted the Imperial army of Simunich for more than four weeks. He and his fellow soldier Gruber Fülöp were hanged by Haynau on June 5, 1849 on Mount Donkey (Szamárhegy). This made them the first victims of the terror of Haynau, who was entrusted with the bloody retribution carried out after the fall of the Hungarian Revolution. Mount Donkey is now occupied by a monstrous Soviet monument called Slavín.\n\nThe Hungarian author Madách lmre, the writer of the famous play The Tragedy of Man, was also imprisoned here, just as the Lutheran pastor and Hungarian revolutionary Rázga Pál, who was also executed on June 18, 1849.\n\nThe southern wing of the barracks facing the Danube was demolished in 1940. After World War II the Slovak National Gallery occupied the building. lt got its new \"modern\" wing between 1969 and 1977.\n\nThe building of the grammar school was constructed between 1906 and 1908 in Hungarian Art-Nouveau style according to the plans of Lechner Ödön.\n\nArchbishop Pázmány Péter of Esztergom established the Jesuit College of Pozsony on September 11, 1626. The construction of the new building of the college started in 1628. The college and the grammar school were located in that building until 1714, when it was moved to the former house of Behaim Balázs on Batthiány Square (now Primate Square). lt was one of the oldest buildings of Pozsony and it was in a bad condition. The school later moved to the former monastery of the Clarissans. After the dissolution of the Jesuit Order, the Benedictines managed the school. The Benedictines were exiled in 1850 for their patriotic behavior after the fall of the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence, and the language of the education became German during the absolutism. In 1861 the school could return to Hungarian-language education and after 1867 it became a royal Catholic grammar school with 8 classes. The famous Hungarian composer Bartók Béla was also its student. In 1919 Pozsony was invaded by the Czechoslovak army and they turned the school into a Slovak-language grammar school. Although more than twice as many Hungarians lived in the town, the invaders did not allow the school to start new first class with Hungarian-language education.\n\nA tavern addressed to \"The swan\" stood on its site already in the 13th century. The restaurant addressed to \"The three green trees\" opened in the building in 1760. In 1838 Johann Lőwy, the director of the horse-drawn tram connecting Pozsony to Nagyszombat, purchased the building. The terminal of the railway was in the neighborhood on the Coronation square. Between 1844 and 1846 the one-story building became a three-story hotel with new Classicist appearance and was renamed to \"To the green tree\".\n\nIn 1905 the first cinema in the town was opened in the building with the name Elektrobioscop.\n\nIn 1913 two other neighboring buildings were integrated into the hotel and they got a new uniform facade. One of them was its former rival, the Savoy Hotel. The two united hotels got the name Carlton Hotel. It was managed by Palugyay Károly and his wife, Antónia. The building was modified to its current form between 1925 and 1929.\n\nKossuth Lajos, the political leader of the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence between 1848 and 1849, stayed in The Green Tree Hotel in March 1848. On March 17, 1848 he made a speech to the crowd from the already demolished balcony of the hotel and announced that Emperor Ferdinand V entrusted Batthyány Lajos with setting up the first Hungarian government the previous day.\n\nThe construction of the bridge in 1891 was ordered by the Hungarian minister Baross Gábor. The bridge was named after Emperor Franz Joseph. The railway towards Szombathely (Hungary) also crossed the Danube on this bridge. After the Czechoslovak invasion in 1919 the bridge was renamed to Stefánik (Stefánik was a Slovak separatist born in northern Hungary, who betrayed his homeland and joined the French Foreign Legion during WW l.). The retreating Germans exploded the bridge in 1945. The Soviet army built a temporary steel bridge on the piers of the old bridge with German prisoners of war. The temporary bridge was named after the Red Army, and although it was built for only a couple of years, it still stands.\n\nThe new Danube Bridge was opened for the traffic in 1974. It was built by the Czechoslovak rulers of Pozsony at the expense of demolishing entire historic town quarters of Pozsony.\n\nThe only one medieval town gate that was spared is the Michael Gate. One section of the moat before the gate can still be seen, and the bridge leads across it. The original bridge was made of wood, which was replaced by a brick bridge of three arches in 1727, after the town's fortifications had already lost their significance. In 1898 the bridge was widened, was given a new iron railing and one semicircular balcony was created on each side in the middle. The sculptures of St. John of Nepomuk and St. Michael were placed on them. In 1984 the statues, which were in a bad condition, were replaced by their replicas, and the Hungarian-Ianguage inscriptions on their pedestals were covered with Slovak-language plaques. After the Czechoslovak invasion in 1919, the town was forcefully Slovakized, and the Slovaks still can't stand seeing any sign of the town's Hungarian past. You can go down to the bottom of the moat using the stairs next to the Vörös Rák (Red Crab) Pharmacy.\n\nThe monument of Empress Maria Theresia was unveiled on May 16, 1897 in the presence of Emperor Franz Joseph. lt was the artwork of the Hungarian sculptor Fadrusz János. The model of the monument won a grand prize at the World Expo in Paris in 1900.\n\nOn the night of 26 to 27 October 1921 the Czechoslovak invaders torn down the statue and smashed it into pieces with iron bars. The statue of Ludovit Stúr made by Bártfay Tibor was erected on its site in 1972. Ludovit Stúr was a Slovak subversive politician who recruited volunteers to fight on the side of the Habsburg Empire in order to suppress the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence between 1848 and 1849. He did not achieve great success, because the large majority of the Slovak minority of northern Hungary (now Slovakia) fought on the side of the Hungarians. Sorrowfully his ideological successors managed to undermine the integrity of Hungary and come to power by convincing the Entente Powers to create Czechoslovakia, the predecessor of Slovakia, without asking for the will of the people. This gave them the means to incite never ending hatred towards Hungarians, which was and still is indispensable for maintaining their power.\n\nArchbishop Batthyány József of Esztergom ordered the construction of the palace, which took place between 1778 and 1781 according to the plans of Melchior Hefele. The tympanum is decorated by the archbishop's coat of arms and his cardinal's hat.\n\nThe Peace of Pozsony was signed in its Mirror Room on December 26, 1805 after the united Austrian and Russian army was defeated by Napoleon in the battle of Austerlitz. Emperor Ferdinand V signed the so-called April Laws here on April 11, 1848.
