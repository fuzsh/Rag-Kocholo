        "text": "A couple of months before I found myself taking a detour through Bratislava on my way home from the Balkans, I watched EuroTrip for the first time.\n\nIf you haven’t seen this totally ridiculous, slapstick stupid American comedy, what were you even doing in the 00’s? Me? I was listening to Scotty Doesn’t Know, but this year was the first time I actually watched the movie, despite it being entirely directed at my demographic when it came out and it was even about backpacking Europe.\n\nAnyway if you haven’t seen it, there’s a scene where they are dropped off in the middle of what looks like a post-apocalyptic Eastern bloc city (or… Pripyat), where a dog’s eating a hand and the dodgy lorry driver that took them there runs off saying “ha haaaaa! They’ll never find me in Bratislava!” They ask a man if they can catch a train to Berlin, and he goes, “yes! Very soon! They are building it now!”\n\n…Bratislava is nothing like EuroTrip.\n\nBratislava is, in fact, an incredibly pretty city that I did not expect at all.\n\nIt didn’t feel like that when I arrived late at night, and in my defiance against taking taxis, I walked from the train station (which had been built and was very much in service) to my hostel, just outside the old town. It was dark, deathly quiet, and the streets that engulfed my hostel were even darker and quieter. Even worse, I had chosen it for being near the main road from the train station, which it turns out you can’t walk along; I had to navigate dark, winding side streets instead. In hindsight, it was probably a stupid idea, but importantly, I made it. And only just – the bar, where you collect your key after hours, was just closing up when I got there.\n\nIn the morning, I desperately needed to do laundry, and when the hostel charged a fortune, I expected the facilities to actually work. I found out after washing my clothes that the dryer did not, which left me with an entire bag of wet clothes to haul off to my next hostel (long story: didn’t have much internet in the Balkans, booked a good hostel last minute which was sold out the night I arrived, so I decided to book somewhere closer to the train station for one night, plus you’re allowed to book yourself an overpriced boutique hostel once in a while, right?).\n\nBratislava was making me cranky after 10 days of early mornings, and all I wanted to do was go and find a cute cafe and eat waffles or something.\n\nBreakfast at Mondieu Café\n\nBINGO.\n\nThis café probably marked the beginning of my love affair with Bratislava. As I took in my beautiful surroundings, watched tours of people gawping at the buildings as they arrived from their river cruises, and kept re-adjusting my carrier bag of heavy clothes that was constantly trying to slop over and send my knickers flying out onto the path, I realised I’d made a good decision stopping here.\n\nI took a short route through the old town to get to the hostel out on the other side – as much as I was enjoying how pretty the town was, I needed to offload my stuff. I’d chosen the hostel deliberately because it had fantastic reviews, it was reasonably priced and best of all, it was MUSIC THEMED! Sadly I was missing out on their live shows, which would have been a really fun addition.\n\nBefore I headed back into the old town, I had one stop to check off…\n\nThe Blue Church\n\nI happened across a photo of this church shortly before I visited and immediately put it at the top of my list. (Yep, above the castle and the weird UFO building!)\n\nI think it’s easy to see why – it’s one of the best churches I’ve ever seen! Certainly one of the most unique, too.\n\nIt does have an official name – the Church Of St Elizabeth – but it really is just known as the Blue Church, to the point that even its Wikipedia page is called “Blue Church” (capitalised).\n\nRead more: A Day Wandering Beautiful Vienna\n\nFrom the church, I decided to do a loop along the river and back into the old town to explore it properly. What really struck me was just how small Bratislava’s old town is. I always found it a shame that Bratislava is seen as a “day stop” between Prague and Budapest, or a day trip from Vienna, or on a river cruise. I was glad to have more than a day there, but quite honestly, I could have seen it all in a day – and, in fact, virtually did.\n\nOnce I’d taken approximately 1,985,402 photos, I took a detour up to the Presidential Palace and promptly saw a car crash into a bus right outside it. It happened right in front of me as I waited to cross the road! Incredibly, the car driver, who had pulled out of the inside lane INTO THE BUS, hurled abuse at the bus driver and drove off in a cloud of dust!!! There was then mayhem as the bus had to stop in the middle of the road and let all the passengers off. I wasn’t sure whether to stick around as a witness but nobody was hurt and the situation seemed to be brought under control quickly.\n\nAnyway, the Presidential Palace is pretty!\n\nAfter that drama, I headed uphill for Bratislava’s main landmark.\n\nBratislava Castle\n\nOf course, no visit to Bratislava is complete without a trip up to the castle overlooking the city. I didn’t go inside, and it’s not really the prettiest castle in the world, but it was worth it for the views from the top.\n\nBratislava certainly has an interesting skyline. There’s an observation deck in the UFO building along with a restaurant, although I didn’t end up going up as it’s expensive – main courses run at almost 50€!\n\nDinner at Slovak Pub\n\nNaturally, I had found a crazy restaurant online and made a beeline for it as soon as the evening hit, along with another girl from the hostel.\n\nIt’s an underground KGB-themed bar!!\n\n…unfortunately we asked for food and they said that they didn’t serve any, and we would have to go upstairs to eat at a restaurant. It confused me because I’ve seen photos and reviews of the food. The place is literally listed as a restaurant on Google.\n\nLuckily we had passed another place that I’d read good reviews for, the simply named Slovak Pub, and we ended up going there instead. It was better than I could have hoped for!\n\nI indulged in a traditional plate of potato dumplings and sheep’s cheese (bryndzové halušky) and ended up washing it down afterwards with alcoholic tea. Not just alcoholic tea, but 62% alcoholic tea. What the hell is this and why hasn’t the UK come up with this bizarre concoction?! It turns out it’s a pretty popular spirit in Slovakia!\n\nThe dumplings were absolutely delicious – I’m still thinking of them now. One of my favourite traditional dishes I think!\n\nAnother place I love the traditional food: Poland! Check out A Getaway In Gorgeous Gdansk: Gates, Museums & Christmas Markets or Krakow: A Contrasting Trip Of Christmas Cheer & Harrowing History\n\nTea in an underground bomb shelter\n\nBratislava’s weirdness didn’t end there – the following night, after a long day in Vienna, I bumped into a dancing polar bear and thought I was delirious, and on my final day, I was lured into an underground tea bar in a bomb shelter only to find myself accidentally becoming a hippie for a couple of hours.\n\nNo, seriously – what would you expect of a tea place with that sign? Awesome, unique British-themed experience, right? Not… feeling like you’re in a Nepalese tea house. There was an overwhelming amount of choice too, but the girls were more than happy to help me choose something! It ended up being a lovely experience.\n\nOh, and in case you thought I was joking about the polar bear:\n\nBut of course, all these quirky additions to the town just made me love the place more.\n\nStatues around Bratislava\n\nOn my last day, before the tea place, I went for breakfast with the girl I’d befriended in the hostel, and we made the most of taking silly photos with some of the statues around town!\n\nThe statues are one of the most famous attractions in Bratislava, but one downside of solo travel is being able to take photos like this, so it was perfect having a like-minded travel buddy for the morning.\n\nAfter she left for her bus, I crossed the river, thinking that I might go up into the bizarre UFO building, but instead just took photos from the riverside – this is one of the best views in town of the castle!\n\nBack in town, I wandered down an alleyway that I somehow hadn’t found before, and stumbled across a Scottish pub.\n\nYou see Irish pubs in every city across the world – but I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Scottish one!\n\nI ended up having more potato dumplings for lunch (not in the Scottish pub). Honest verdict? They are freaking delicious, but the sheep’s cheese and bacon makes it really rich, and I struggled to finish it to the point I’m still not sure if I could have another plate even now!! It’s too much!\n\nI think I walked every street of the old town – and most more than once – just to take in all the pretty buildings, find all the strange statues and generally fall in love with the place.\n\nFor me, Bratislava was the perfect mix of beautiful, quirky, eastern, western, and touristy but not overly so. It was unexpected, yet felt comfortably familiar.\n\nBut most of all, I think it finds it tough being shouldered in with Prague, Vienna and Budapest an hour or two away on every side. Bratislava should be recognised in its own right and deserves to hit the limelight by itself for once.\n\nOr maybe it should just stay where it is, and the people who know, know.\n\nI visited Bratislava on the way back from my Balkans trip.
