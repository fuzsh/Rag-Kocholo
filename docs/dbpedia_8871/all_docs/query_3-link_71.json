        "text": "Time of Year\n\nThere are many times of the year you can enjoy Bratislava. It all depends on the experience you’re after:\n\nI visited Bratislava in late May and it was amazing to see the city so alive, even though it was an extremely hot visit! Because of this, I’d avoid visiting in the Summer. There are lots of hills and historic buildings without air conditioning so the heat can be brutal.\n\nSimilar to Vienna (1 hour away), Spring is a wonderful time in Bratislava. You can comfortably explore with mild temperatures and fewer crowds. And bonus – the city’s fruit trees should also be in full bloom!\n\nIf snow is more your kind of your landscape, Bratislava sees its fair share in the Winter with temperatures typically under 40°F. Just don’t forget to visit the city’s annual Christmas Market if visiting in December!\n\nHow To Get There\n\nIf arriving from outside of Europe, I recommend flying into either Vienna or Budapest. From there, you can take the train into Bratislava, where the station is only 15 minutes walking distance from Old Town.\n\nIf you’re already in Europe, you can travel by train from cities like Munich, Budapest and Krakow. Alternatively, Bratislava has a small airport offering flights to a handful of nearby destinations.\n\nHow To Get Around\n\nWHile Bratislava has its fair share of hills, most sights are located within Old Town, making the city the perfect place to explore on foot.\n\nTrams, buses or trolley buses also run throughout Bratislava, making the city all the more accessible.\n\nFor trips outside the city, you can take the train or rent a car. Just make sure to secure an International Driver’s Permit (IDP) before your trip if you decide on renting a car. You can do this through AAA if you’re a U.S. Citizen or Permanent Resident with a local state driver’s license.\n\nSlavin Memorial\n\nSlavin Memorial is a World War II Memorial commemorating the Soviet Army soldiers who died liberating the city in April 1945. It’s located about 30 minutes walking distance up from Bratislava Castle.\n\nRolandova Fountain\n\nSometimes referred to as Maximillian Fountain, Rolandova Fountain was built in the late 1500s by the King of Royal Hungary at the time, Maximilian II. Originally built as a public water supply, it now serves as a stunning art piece and still-working fountain in Bratislava’s Main Square.\n\nPrimate’s Palace\n\nPrimate’s Palace is a pale pink and white neoclassical palace in Bratislava’s Old Town. And along with its gorgeous exterior, Primate’s Palace holds many treasures within, including a rare 17th century English royal tapestries collection."
