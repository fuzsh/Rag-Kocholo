        "text": "How to get to Bratislava\n\nGetting to Bratislava is extremely easy. You can take a flight from many major European cities or a bus from the nearby towns, like Prague or Budapest, however, I think the easiest way to get there is to travel from Vienna. Bratislava is located only around 70 km (45 miles) from the famous Austrian capital and it takes only around 1 hour to drive between those two cities.\n\nThere are no border controls as both countries are in the Schengen zone. So, I believe, if you're in Vienna and you're bored by its \"perfectness\", hop on the bus to Slovakia and see Bratislava which is a gateway to a slightly different world of Eastern Europe with its all aspects.\n\nWe arrived in Bratislava by bus from Prague, the journey was a bit long but easily doable. It took around 5 hours but anyway we wanted to see the both major cities of the former Czechoslovakia.\n\nIs Bratislava worth visiting? Is it a good alternative to Prague?\n\nWe arrived in Bratislava at night and at first, the area around the main bus station was pretty much run down and dodgy. But what I love about Eastern Europe is the fact that the seemingly rough places are way safer than similar looking spots in the west. Nevertheless, during the short walk to the hostel, there was nothing much that could enchant us or at least seem beautiful in Bratislava, especially that we'd just come from the perfectly maintained Prague. These were our first impressions of the Slovakian capital.\n\nThe next day, however, was to change our opinion about the city. It turned out to be well worth a visit - the closer you get to the Old Town area, the better it gets.The historic center is not as beautifully kept as the pristine streets of Prague but it's cozy and nice. And it does feel more authentic - while Prague reminds of a Disney fairy tale film, Bratislava comes across more as a normal, authentic city where it's actually quite easy to believe that local people (not only tourists) do live and hang out in the old town.\n\nI think you should keep one thing in mind before visiting Bratislava - don't expect it to be a second Prague, Vienna or Paris. Bratislava is a lot smaller and if you visit it as you would visit a small town - you'll like it. Although there are no extremely spectacular things in Bratislava that you wouldn't see anywhere else in the world (but you can still spot many surprising little gems) - it does have its charm. If you've ever been to the cities such as Krakow, Ljubljana, Riga, Vilnius or Tallinn - you most likely will also enjoy Bratislava. And, if you're in Vienna, go to Bratislava just to see the difference and experience the Eastern Part of Europe, too!\n\nUFO observation desk\n\nThe UFO observation desk is a peculiar attraction attached to the bridge over the river Danube connecting the old town and the residential districts filled with concrete blocks.\n\nThis weird construction has nothing to do with UFO, however, with the exception of its strange shape. From the inside, you can see quite a nice panorama of the entire old town and the castle, but I think I prefer the view from the tower of the Old Town Hall.\n\nThe entry fee, in my opinion, is way to high - 7 EUR (8 USD) for 10 minutes of taking some photos is a rip off. Nevertheless, if you wish to see Bratislava from the highest point, that's the place to go.\n\nSlavin War Memorial\n\nSlavin War Memorial is located in the northern part of Bratislava. To get there, you need to walk uphill quite a lot so if you don't have too much time, I would skip it as it is nothing too special unless you're deeply interested in the WW2 history.\n\nThe memorial is dedicated to the Soviet soldiers that died during the fights with the Nazis during the second world war.\n\nOn the way there, you can see another viewpoint of Bratislava - this time the modern part and some interesting houses with the architecture typical of the Austro-Hungarian Empire which I really liked.\n\nSlovak Radio - The Inverted pyramid\n\nYet another crazy example of the Communist Era architecture, the inverted pyramid building which is the seat of the Slovak Radio is situated in the modern center of Bratislava, a bit to the north of the old town.\n\nThis peculiar construction was voted as one of the 30 ugliest buildings in the world but in my opinion, the typical Soviet/Communist, heavy, brutal architecture is original, different and should be treated as a legacy of the bygone times that will never return, whether they were good or bad.\n\nIn the future, it will be probably a cool and outlandish tourist destination rather than an object of mockery in the western world. At least it makes the Eastern Cities less \"boringly perfect\".\n\nThe Old Town\n\nAlthough at first, I wasn't too convinced about whether I liked Bratislava or not, with every corner the city turned out to be more and more interesting. Especially, after entering the beautiful old town through the Michael's Gate - the city's oldest building and the only remaining medieval gate in Bratislava from the beginning of the 14th century.\n\nThe old town of Bratislava is tiny and quite similar to other cities in Central Europe, like Krakow, Ljubljana, Riga or Vilnius. Click on the links to read my posts about those cities.\n\nIt's of course not as spectacular as Prague, but what I like about it is the authenticity and the true atmosphere of an old, medieval town. Some of the buildings remind of the grand European architecture (Grassalkovich Palace, the National Theater and Primate's Palace) - others, in turn, are crumbling which actually is not a bad thing and adds more charm to the overall character of the city.\n\nThe churches\n\nThere are a few beautiful churches in the old town, and because the historical center is so small, if you just walk around, it's really difficult to miss them:\n\nTrinity Church (18th century) - Zupne Namestie square\n\nClarissine Church (14th century) - Beautiful church made of stone\n\nSt. Martin's Cathedral (15th century) - largest church in Bratislava\n\nCapuchin Church (18th century) - the most picturesque church, especially viewed with the castle in the background\n\nBratislava Castle\n\nBratislava Castle dates back to as early as the 10th century, however it was rebuilt numerous times and the last time it was renovated was in the 2000s.\n\nThe castle is a huge rectangular building with four distinctive towers, but it doesn't resemble those Disney-style castles. It's nice enough, however, built on a cliff and overlooking the old town.\n\nThe castle is visible virtually from all over Bratislava and it integrates beautifully when seen from between the narrow streets of old town.\n\nThe Old Town Hall and Michael's Gate Tower - Best Viewpoints of the Old town\n\nThe Old Town Hall (14th century), located in the very heart of the city - Hlavne Namestie square. Here, Bratislava does remind of Prague of Krakow.\n\nIf you wish to see one of the best views of the city, climb up the steps of the Old Town Hall tower and the nearby Michalska (Michael's) tower.\n\nFor me, those were the best viewpoints (and cheaper than the UFO observation desk) of the old town. You can see all the little streets and red roofed houses with the castle hill in the background. A beautiful, fairy tale-like view.\n\nDrunk Mexican and a man emerging from sewers\n\nAs in many cities, you can find something unique in Bratislava, too. There are some monuments and statues as well as ordinary, every day life things that make the city interesting.\n\nDon't miss the statue called Cumil - \"Man at work\" - which is basically a man coming out of the sewer in the old town. Touching his head may bring you luck! This weird monument is quite hard to find, however, it's located in the corner of Panska street and Rybarska Brana street.\n\nWe also came across a Mexican restaurant which had a dummy of a drunk Mexican sitting on its window - quite a funny way to encourage guests to dine in there."
