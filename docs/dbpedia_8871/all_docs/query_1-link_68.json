        "text": "Explore the adorable capital city of Slovakia!\n\nBratislava has an interesting and complicated history. For much of its history, the city was part of the kingdom of Hungary and ruled by the Austrian Hapsburgs. In fact, Bratislava wasn’t even known as Bratislava until after WWI (previous name was Pressburg/Prešporok), when it was incorporated into the new country of Czechoslovakia. The ethnic makeup of Bratislava at that time was mostly ethnic Germans and Hungarians. They tried to make Bratislava a free state, but they failed, and Bratislava was made the seat of government for Slovakia. The Hungarians fled after the Hungarian army left the city in 1919. Slovakian and Czech families would replace them. In 1993, Bratislava would be named the capital of the new Slovak Republic after separation from the Czech Republic (Czechia).\n\nSituated on the Danube, Bratislava is right on the border with Austria and very close to the country’s border with Hungary. It’s a subdued capital city, even though it has over 400,000 inhabitants in the metro region. There are quite a few medieval buildings in the old town, including towers, churches and even a castle. There is also a sprinkling of 20th-21st century building scattered around the city center but the character of the center of Bratislava is still pretty much intact. Everything is also super colorful, making even a cold February day feel cheery.\n\nBratislava was amazing. It was so pleasant to just walk around and explore. You can easily spend a couple days here, exploring and going to museums. There are also castle ruins not far outside of town. I was just so impressed with Bratislava. Plus, they have a good pizza place near Michael’s Gate.\n\nCheck out my next update where I head to Brno, Czechia!\n\nor\n\nStart at the beginning of this adventure in Zurich!"
