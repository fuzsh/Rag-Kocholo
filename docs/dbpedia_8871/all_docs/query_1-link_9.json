        "text": "History of the Name\n\nDid you know that Bratislava has had its name for just over a hundred years? The Hungarians always called it Poszony, for Germans it was Pressburg, Slovaks referred to it as Prešporok, and in Czech, it was known as Prešpurk.\n\nIt was only on March 27, 1919, shortly after the Czech Republic and Slovakia became independent countries, that Prešpurk was renamed Bratislava. Today, Slovaks affectionately call it Blava.\n\nInterestingly, in 1919, only about twenty percent of Bratislava's population were Slovaks. Therefore, the first president of the Czechoslovak Republic, Tomáš Garigue Masaryk, considered whether to annex Prešpurk to Czechoslovakia at all.\n\nThe city was predominantly German with a strong Hungarian minority. Eventually, on January 1, 1919, the Czechoslovak army occupied Prešpurk, and the city became part of the newly formed state.\n\nHistory of the City\n\nThe most famous landmark of Bratislava is Bratislava Castle. Founded in the 9th century AD, a small town emerged around it. It was named Wratisslaburgium or Vratislav's Castle.\n\nBetween 1563 and 1830, Bratislava was the coronation city for Hungarian kings, traditionally held in St. Martin's Cathedral.\n\nHowever, when Joseph II demoted Bratislava to a provincial town, Buda became the capital of Hungary, and the coronation jewels were transferred to Vienna.\n\nWhy Visit Bratislava\n\nIn modern Bratislava, about half a million people currently reside. You'll find dozens of interesting places worth visiting in Bratislava.\n\nAmong the most attractive tourist spots are:\n\nBratislava Castle – the city's most famous landmark,\n\nMain Square – often referred to as the \"heart of Bratislava\",\n\nSt. Martin's Cathedral – the most significant religious monument,\n\nSlovak National Theatre – an architectural gem with elements of Baroque and Renaissance by renowned Viennese architects,\n\nBratislava UFO – a dominant feature of the Slovak National Uprising bridge.\n\nBosonium or Istropolis?\n\nDid you know that Bratislava has had a variety of both official and unofficial names throughout history? Among them are the previously mentioned Wratisslaburgium, Brezalauspurc, Presburch, Prešporek, Poson, Bosan, Bosonium, and Istropolis.\n\nIn gratitude for the recognition of the new state by the United States of America, there was also consideration to name it Wilsonovo. However, the name Bratislava, coined by Pavel J. Šafařík from the name Brecisburg, eventually prevailed.\n\nHow to make the most of your time in Bratislava?
