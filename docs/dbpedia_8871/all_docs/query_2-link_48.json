        "text": "For most Americans, Slovakia and its capital city, Bratislava, are still seen as secondary stops on the express train between Prague and Budapest or other better-known eastern European destinations.\n\nBut Bratislava is charming, vibrant and will especially appeal to tourists who enjoy mixing with the locals, rather than bumping into other visitors at every step as in other European hotspots.\n\nThe city is also awash in new construction and new wealth, the spoils of Slovakia’s recent entry into the European Union. Yet the mostly mountainous countryside beyond the city remains as undiscovered as ever.\n\nI’d had heard about all the changes in Slovakia, still one of Europe’s newest countries, and I couldn’t wait to see all of it. I had lived here for five years in the 1990s, beginning in 1993, the year that Czechoslovakia dissolved into two independent countries, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nI lived my first year in the country with a local family, the Repasskys, in east Slovakia, a region of cultural treasures and breathtaking scenery. They had introduced me to their land and patiently taught me the language. I later founded, with three other journalists, an English-language newspaper called The Slovak Spectator. Now I was returning for the newspaper’s 10th anniversary.\n\nI also intended to see the Repasskys again, although I felt awkward about it. When I left the country in 1998, I had married a Slovak. But the marriage didn’t last and I fell out of touch with the Repasskys.\n\nNow I felt like the prodigal son seeking a second chance as I called Mrs. Repasska and sheepishly said I’d like to visit, if she’d have me.\n\n“Dear child,” she said, “of course, we want you to visit. You are our son.”\n\nBut my trip to the Repasskys’ home was a few days away, so I had ample time to again explore Bratislava, the hub of the country’s progress.\n\nProsperity oozes in many places here – in the fashionable dress of young people, plentiful goods in shiny new boutiques, and historic buildings bathed in bright, playful pastels.\n\nThe Old Town district is the city’s jewel, with cobblestone squares, narrow, labyrinthine streets and a castle offering sweeping views of the city and the Danube River.\n\nHlavne Namestie, the city’s main square, exemplifies Bratislava’s renaissance. Many buildings, rotting with broken windows and dusty interiors only several years ago, have been restored to their architectural graces. The Japanese and Greek embassies, a French cultural center and three coffeehouses now call the square home.\n\nHviezdoslavovo Namestie also has gotten a facelift. The long, mall-like boulevard is a stroller’s dream: Begin at the Slovak National Theater building and the small square in front of it, abuzz with professionals on cell phones rushing to the next appointment and older folks on their daily walk or passing time on benches. Pass fountains with tracks of water and a gazebo with a stage. There are many cafes and restaurants along the way, where one can sample the national dish, bryndzove halusky (potato gnocchi topped with sheep’s cheese) or sip another local staple, slivovica, or plum brandy.\n\nThe boulevard ends at another small square with the Novy Most (New Bridge), which, along with the concrete apartment high-rises across the Danube, are Bratislava’s most enduring symbols of its socialist past.\n\nA walk across the bridge on the pedestrian path and you’ll gain a greater appreciation of the Danube’s breadth; there’s a park and a children’s play area with a beer garden on the other side.\n\nInstead of going over the bridge, take a right and head toward St. Martin’s Cathedral. The church breathes Slovakia’s long subjugation to Hungarian rule, when Bratislava was the Hungarian empire’s capital and kings and queens were crowned in St. Martin’s, including the empress Maria Theresa. The castle is a short distance up the hill.\n\nThe Repasskys live in a small village in the Spis region, an area of east Slovakia that will reward those with an adventuresome spirit and a yearning for the outdoors. Get a rental car, and you can see most of the sights in a day or two.\n\nThere’s Spis Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage site. It’s a brief, yet steep, walk to the expansive castle ruins, but the reward is a panoramic view of the countryside, with the High Tatras mountains in the distance.\n\nIn the village below is the Spisska Kapitula monastery, also a UNESCO landmark.\n\nNearby is Levoca, where the renowned woodcarver Majster Pavol carved intricate structures, including the mammoth Gothic altar in St. James Church on the main square. Visiting the plaza itself is like being tossed back centuries in time, with medieval buildings and burgher homes painstakingly restored to their original, centuries-old grandeur.\n\nI stayed a couple of days with the Repasskys, reminiscing about old times and visiting the Catholic school where I taught English to exuberant middle-schoolers. The students were different, but their eagerness to learn English was the same. We played a few games of “hangman,” and then the teacher told them I was a journalist.\n\nHands shot up. “Do you know Britney Spears?” asked one. I shook my head, no. “How about Bono?” asked another. Sorry.\n\nI told them I had met the American vice president and the man who located the undersea wreckage of the Titanic. They didn’t seem impressed.\n\nIt seemed like I had just arrived when it was time to leave. I was about to get on the train when Mrs. Repasska drew me close, and blessed me by making the sign of the cross on my forehead.\n\n“Come back soon,” she said, “and bring your new wife.”"
