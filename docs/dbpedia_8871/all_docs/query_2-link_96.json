        "text": "Slovakia swimmer Tamara Potocka collapsed poolside Friday morning after a qualifying heat of the women's 200-meter individual medley at the Paris Olympics. She was given first aid and then carried off on a stretcher.\n\nPotocka, 21, was seen wearing an oxygen mask as she was taken away for medical attention. Medical personnel at the pool said she was conscious.\n\nPotocka collapsed as she got out of the water and almost immediately was surrounded by a half-dozen medical attendants who put her on a stretcher after about a minute and carried her off the pool deck.\n\nIt was not clear if she received CPR.\n\nRELATED STORY | Imane Khelif, Algerian boxer who had gender test issue, wins first Olympic fight when opponent quits\n\nIsraeli swimmer Lea Polonsky, who swam two heats after Potocka, said swimmers know their sport has inherent risks.\n\n“Of course that's something in the back of your mind, but we do every day push ourselves to the limit,” she added. “You always know something like that can happen. It's not something you think about during the race, but it's always there.”\n\nThis is Potocka's first Olympics. She resides in the Slovakian capital of Bratislava.\n\nPotocka finished seventh in her heat in a time of 2 minutes, 14.20 seconds. Her time was not fast enough to advance her to the semifinals of the event, which eliminated her from the competition."
