        "text": "Buy data Donate\n\nUpdates:\n\nI have added data from the 2011 census, and replaced the 1970 figures under Population history, which were rounded, with exact numbers from source [1].\n\nNew proposed NUTS codes for Slovakia were issued on 2004-09-15. I have updated the table to show them.\n\nDuring the Iron Curtain period, Czechoslovakia comprised two Socialist Republics, the Czech S. R. and the Slovak S. R. Each republic was divided into several kraje (regions) and one independent city. The communist government of Czechoslovakia resigned on November 24, 1989. On January 1, 1993, the Czech and Slovak Republics separated amicably. The old administrative divisions apparently persisted for a while, but by 1996, Slovakia adopted a new set of regions.\n\nInternational standard ISO 3166-2 was published on December 15, 1998. It superseded ISO/DIS 3166-2 (draft international standard). For Slovakia, the draft standard showed three regions, the ones which had prevailed under communism. It failed to list the one independent city, Bratislava. The final standard showed the eight regions adopted in ~1996. The new regions and their codes are shown in this table.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameSLOVAKIA ISO codeSK FIPS codeLO LanguageSlovak (sk) Time zone+1~ CapitalBratislava\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Slovakia was a region in the north of Hungary, which was one of two kingdoms linked together as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. At the end of World War I, shortly before the Armistice, the Slovaks organized a new government in northern Hungary. They merged with the Czechs to form Czechoslovakia on 1918-11-14. The Treaty of Saint-Germain (1919-09-10) confirmed the new country. During World War II, Slovakia was invaded and became a German protectorate. At the end of the war, Czechoslovakia was restored almost to its pre-war borders. The Soviet Union annexed Transcarpathian Ukraine, also known as Ruthenia, at the eastern end. By its constitution of 1948-06-09, Czechoslovakia became a \"people's democratic republic.\" Its primary divisions were the Czech and the Slovak Socialist Republic. On 1993-01-01, the two republics became separate countries. What had been the second-level subdivisions of Czechoslovakia were now first-level subdivisions of the Czech Republic and of Slovakia.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nDanish: Slovakiet, Den Slovakiske Republik, Slovakiet\n\nDutch: Slowakije, Slowaakse Republiek (formal)\n\nEnglish: Slovak Republic (formal)\n\nFinnish: Slovakia\n\nFrench: Slovaquie f, République f Slovaque (formal)\n\nGerman: Slowakei f, Slowakische Republik f (formal)\n\nIcelandic: Slóvakía\n\nItalian: Slovacchia f, Repubblica f Slovacca (formal)\n\nNorwegian: Den slovakiske republikk (formal) (Bokmål), Den slovakiske republikken (formal) (Nynorsk), Slovakia\n\nPortuguese: Eslováquia, República f Eslovaca (formal)\n\nSlovak: Slovensko, Slovenská Republika (formal)\n\nRussian: Словакия, Словацкая Республика (formal)\n\nSpanish: Eslovaquia, República f Eslovaca (formal)\n\nSwedish: Slovakien\n\nTurkish: Slovakya Cumhuriyeti (formal)\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nfrom ethnic name Slovak, a variant of Slav\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nSlovakia is divided into eight kraje (regions).\n\nRegionHASCFIPSNUTSRCPop-2011Pop-2001Area(km.²)Area(mi.²)Slovak NameGermanFormer Banska BystricaSK.BCLO01SK0326660,563662,1219,4553,651BanskobystrickýNeusohlCentral, East BratislavaSK.BLLO02SK0101602,436599,0152,052792BratislavskýPreßburgBratislava, West KosiceSK.KILO03SK0428791,723766,0126,7522,607KošickýKaschauEast NitraSK.NILO04SK0234689,867713,4226,3442,449NitrianskyNeutraWest PresovSK.PVLO05SK0417814,527789,9688,9813,468PrešovskýPreschauEast TrencinSK.TCLO06SK0223594,328605,5824,5021,738TrenčianskyTrentschinWest, Central TrnavaSK.TALO07SK0212554,741551,0034,1471,601TrnavskýTyrnauWest ZilinaSK.ZILO08SK0315688,851692,3326,8012,626ŽilinskýSilleinCentral 8 regions5,397,0365,379,45549,03418,933\n\nName: English name of region or province.

Slovak addresses can be identified by prefixing the postal codes with \"SK-\".\n\nFurther subdivisions:\n\nSee the Districts of Slovakia page.\n\nBratislava was subdivided into obvody until 1996. The regions are subdivided into 79 okresy.\n\nThe NUTS level-2 nomenclature, derived by taking the first four characters of the NUTS codes in the table above, defines an unofficial set of districts (called \"oblasti\" in Slovak). These are their names: Bratislavský kraj (SK01), Západné Slovensko (SK02), Stredné Slovensko (SK03), and Východné Slovensko (SK04). These names are essentially the same as those used for the four divisions of the Slovak Socialist Republic in the 1970s and 1980s, but the areas they cover are different.\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nThe UN LOCODE page for Slovakia lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions. This information can be put together to approximate the territorial extent of subdivisions.\n\nOrigins of names:\n\nBratislava: Slovak Brecislava, name of an old Slav colony\n\nChange history:\n\n1918: Slovakia formed. It consisted of two provinces: Slovakia proper and Carpathian Ruthenia.

Carpathian Ruthenia consisted of Bereg, Máramaros, Ugocsa, and the rest of Ung. For more details about the Hungarian counties, see Hungary listing.\n\n1918-11-14: Slovakia merged with a Czech government in formation, creating Czechoslovakia.\n\n1920: Poland took parts of Orava (374 km.²) and Spis (215 km.²) regions from Slovakia.\n\n1945-06-29: Soviet Union acquired Carpathian Ruthenia from Czechoslovakia by treaty.\n\n1949-01-01: The země (provinces) of Slovakia were replaced by six regions. This table shows populations as of 1957-01-01. The capitals have the same names as their regions. The German names of the capitals, used during the occupation, are also shown.\n\nRegionPopulationArea(km.²)German name Bratislava970,2857,519Preßburg Banská Bystrica587,2159,266Neusohl Žilina525,0728,269Sillein Košice541,3597,440Kaschau Prešov448,3198,495Preschau Nitra747,7877,968Neutra 6 regions3,820,03748,957\n\nPopulation: 1957-01-01 estimate\n\n1960: Banská Bystrica and Žilina merged to form Central Slovakia; Košice and Prešov merged to form East Slovakia; Bratislava and Nitra merged to form West Slovakia.\n\n~1970: Bratislava hlavné mesto (city) split from West Slovakia.
