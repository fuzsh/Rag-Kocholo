Plus, the beautiful countryside is perfect for hiking, cycling, and picnicking.\n\nOn the other hand, if you prefer a quieter atmosphere and want to avoid crowds of tourists, consider visiting Bratislava in the shoulder seasons of spring (April-May) or autumn (September-October). During these months, there are fewer tourists but it is still pleasant weather. You can take a stroll through the picturesque Old Town without feeling overwhelmed by crowds.\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in experiencing Bratislava‚Äôs winter wonderland charm, plan a visit between November and February when snow blankets the cityscape. The festive Christmas markets bring warmth and joy to cold nights as locals gather around stalls selling delicious treats like mulled wine and roasted chestnuts.\n\nWhat to do in Bratislava\n\nWhat to do in Bratislava? Start by exploring the Bratislava Old Town, where you‚Äôll find narrow, winding streets, historic buildings, and vibrant squares. O\n\n1. Michael‚Äôs Gate.\n\nStroll through the charming streets of the Old Town, where you can admire some of the most iconic Bratislava places to see.\n\nStart your Bratislava sightseeing by entering the old town through Michael‚Äôs gate. This is the only gate that still exists and in fact, is the only Medieval gate still in existence in Bratislava. It is part of the original fortifications which date from the 14th century. The tower houses the Museum of Arms and also offers a fabulous view of the Old Town. At the top of the tower is a statue of the archangel Michael, slaying a dragon.\n\nThe door to the stairs for the tower is easily missed. If you are looking at the tower from inside the old town there is a large, heavy wooden door to the right of the archway. If it is closed open it and you will find a ticket office. The tower is only 51m metres tall, but the view from the sixth floor across the beautiful medieval town is a delight.\n\n2. Explore the old town\n\nOne of the best things to do in Bratislava is to explore the Bratislava old town.\n\nThe buildings are a mixture of Gothic and Baroque styles and the cobbled streets are like a picture postcard. There are restaurants and cafes all over so choose one, have a drink and watch the world go by. The main area of Bratislava Old Town has been pedestrianized and it is a pleasure not to have to worry about traffic.\n\nWalking down the main street you are walking along the coronation route. Keep your eyes open for the gold crowns dotted along the road. This is the route of the coronation processions of kings and queens between 1563 and 1830. It is an easy to follow route if you want to walk in the footsteps of the monarchs of a bygone era.\n\nExploring the Old Town is an essential part of any visit to Bratislava. Immerse yourself in its rich history and vibrant culture, and you‚Äôll understand why it‚Äôs one of the attractions in Bratislava that you should not miss.\n\nü§© Recommended: Bratislava: 1-Hour Small Group Walking Tour ‚Äì This is the tour that I did and loved it\n\n3. Old town hall and main square\n\nAt the heart of the Old Town is the Town Hall and Tower. It is the oldest city hall in Slovakia built in 1370. The Romanesque house belonged to the Mayor and became the property of the city. Over time the houses next to it were annexed to create the building we see today.\n\nIt has been used as a prison and a mint, but today it houses the Bratislava City Museum documenting the city‚Äôs history. It also has a rather lovely roof. If you are prepared to climb to the top of the tower you will have a lovely view across the town.\n\n4. St. Martin‚Äôs Cathedral\n\nSt Martin‚Äôs Cathedral is where 18 royal coronations have taken place over the years. It became a coronation city when the Ottoman Turks conquered Hungary and occupied the town. There is a gold crown on the top of the spire which is a reproduction of the crown of St. Stephen and signifies the royal connection.\n\nThe 85 m high tower was built during the 13th and 14th centuries and originally formed part of the fortification of the town walls. The interior is beautiful and is worth a visit if you can spare the time. You will have to dress accordingly when you visit, so ladies, take a wrap or a scarf with you as a cover-up if you are wearing strappy tops.\n\n5. Bratislava Castle\n\nOne of the top Bratislava attractions is the magnificent Bratislava Castle (Hrad)), perched high above the city, offering stunning views of Bratislava, Slovakia, the Danube River and the surrounding areas.\n\nBratislava castle was built in the 9th century and if you climb the hill you will enjoy amazing views from the gardens. On a clear day, you can see both Austria and Hungary. The castle has been recently renovated.\n\n6. Slovak National Theatre\n\nThere are 2 opera houses in Bratislava, Slovakia. The Slovak National Theatre (The Old Opera Building) is a gem and is located on Hviezdoslavovo Square near the Danube River. The first performance took place in 1920 two years after it was built. It is still in use today even though there is a newer modern opera house.\n\n7. Hviezdoslav Square\n\nOne of the things to do in Bratislava is to chill and watch the world go by. This is the number one spot in town to do just that. It is a wide-open space filled with fountains and shady trees and lined with beautiful old mansions and townhouses. You will also find a number of embassies here while on the other side of the square are restaurants and cafes. There are often buskers around who are more than willing to entertain you. It is also where the Christmas market is held each year.\n\n8. Cross the Most SNP Bridge\n\nThe Bridge of the Slovak National Uprising (Most SNP) was built between 1967 and 1972 during the Soviet era. It looks a bit like a spaceship and totally out of place on the landscape, but it is a talking point. There is a restaurant at the top of it where you will have great views over the Danube and the city. The elevator is old and a bit claustrophobic so you may want to skip this if it is a problem.\n\nPro Tip: If you are catching a bus to your next destination the bus station is located below this bridge.\n\n9. The Blue Church Bratislava\n\nAlthough it is officially known as the Church of St Elizabeth of Hungary it is commonly called ‚Äòthe Blue Church. The church is art nouveau in style, which is also known as Hungarian Secession. It reminded me of a beautifully iced cake and I instantly fell in love with this building. The Blue Church was one of my favourite things to see in Bratislava. The pastel shades are really pretty. Both the interior and exterior are beautiful shades of blue. Even the roof is glazed with blue ceramic tiles.\n\n10. Slovak Pub\n\nYou can‚Äôt spend any time in Bratislava and not have a meal. Tracking down great food is always important for me and one of the fun things to do in Bratislava. The Slovak Pub was an excellent choice for local food and I was told that it is one of the best pubs in Bratislava.\n\nIt is an old building with a maze of rooms all themed in styles reflecting the history of Slovakia. They source many of their products from a bio farm which they own as well as purchasing produce from local farmers.\n\nThe food is delicious and the beer is chilled to perfection. If you try nothing else I recommend the dumplings followed by the strudel both of which were heavenly. In fact, the food was so good I went back the next day to try a few more dishes.\n\n11. What to eat in Bratislava\n\nStart your food journey by trying traditional Slovak dishes such as bryndzov√© halu≈°ky, a delectable dish made with potato dumplings smothered in a creamy sheep cheese sauce and topped with crispy bacon. This hearty dish is a true comfort food, especially during winter in Bratislava.\n\nFor a taste of Bratislava‚Äôs street food culture, head to the local food markets and sample mouthwatering delights like trdeln√≠k, a sweet pastry cooked over an open flame and topped with cinnamon and sugar. The crispy exterior and soft, doughy interior make it a delightful treat that pairs perfectly with a cup of coffee. I first tried these in Cesky Krumlov, in the Czech Republic and was hooked.\n\nI love going on a food tour. I always think that not only do you get to try delicious food, but you also learn so much from the knowledgeable guides.\n\nü§© Recommended: Bratislava Foodie Tour\n\n12. Quirky statues in Bratislava\n\nOne of the fun things to do in Bratislava is to keep your eyes open as you walk around town for the quirky statues dotted all over. The most famous is Cumil at the junction of Laurinsk√° and Pansk√° Streets. You will find him popping his head out of the sewers and having a well-earned break. His head has been taken off a few times by reckless drivers so there is a warning sign that has been installed, although I am not sure how much difference it‚Äôs made.\n\nNapoleonic Soldier ‚Äì Located in the main square\n\nSchone Naci ‚Äì Schone Naci (man with a top hat) was a popular character in Bratislava. You will find him located at Rybarska Brana Street.\n\nHans Christian Andersen ‚Äì Head to Hviezdoslavovo Square to see the statue that commemorates this popular children‚Äôs author.\n\nThese statutes are a must see in Bratislava. Don‚Äôt miss them!\n\n13. Street art\n\nI did not see much street art in and around the city but in 2016 the first street art festival was held. One of my favourite works was The Fox in Dubajska Street.\n\nYou may also find some street art under the UFO bridge and the passage under Staromestska street, between Zochova, Kozia and Zupne namestie.\n\n14. Primatial (Primate‚Äôs) Palace\n\nThis pretty pink building was built between 1778 and 1781 for the archbishop. Today it is the seat of the Mayor of Bratislava.\n\nThe palace contains a rare collection of English tapestries from the 17th century that was only rediscovered in 1903 when the building was being repaired. One of the best things to see is the Hall of Mirrors.\n\n1 day in Bratislava Slovakia\n\nYou can easily see all the things to do in Bratislava mentioned above if you only have 1 day in Bratislava. If you are in Vienna or Budapest and are wondering if it is worth the day trip please allow 1 day in Bratislava Slovakia in your plans.\n\nThings to do near Bratislava\n\n15. Devin Castle\n\nPerched on a clifftop, overlooking the Danube, are the ruins of Devin Castle. Before 1989 the boundary of the Iron Curtain, separating the Eastern Bloc from the West ran in front of the castle. The surrounding area was a restricted military zone heavily fortified with barbed wire and watchtowers.\n\nThe castle was destroyed by Napoleon‚Äôs retreating forces in 1809 and has remained a ruin.\n\nYou can easily visit Devin Castle on a day trip from Bratislava.\n\nü§© Recommended: The Bratislava Wine Tasting and Devin Castle Private Tour that takes you to the popular castle and a local wine producer\n\n16. Slavin Monument\n\nYou can‚Äôt help but notice the huge Slavin War Memorial on the hill overlooking the castle. It is visible from most of the city. It commemorates the city‚Äôs liberation by the Red Army in 1945, but it is also a cemetery for the thousands of Soviet soldiers who died in the battles that surrounded the city during the last weeks of WWII.\n\nWhere to stay in Bratislava\n\nArt Hotel William\n\nThe Art Hotel William has an excellent location right in the heart of Bratislava‚Äôs old town making the main sights easily accessible and within walking distance. There is also a wide range of bars and restaurants in the immediate surroundings. The rooms are spacious, modern and well-equipped. You can book a room or a suite if you need more space.
