        "text": "Robert Lowry papers\n\nFinding Aid\n\nPrepared by Alice Essinger, November, 22, 2002; revised by Shelley Morris, April 2004; Last Updated: March 2022\n\nInclusive Dates: 1945-1992\n\nExtent: 2.5 cubic feet (2 record storage boxes + oversized scrapbooks)\n\nPhysical Location: 11th floor\n\nBiographical Note: Robert Lowry (1919-1994) was a popular author in his younger days, but became relatively unknown towards the end of his life. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio he spent the beginning and end of his life there. An avid writer from very early on, he began publishing his poems and short stories in the \"Sunshine Page\" of the Cincinnati Times Star, at the age of nine. In his early twenties, he started his own magazine called The Little Man and published several well-known authors. At the age of 23, he served in World War II and upon his return he published several books. Lowry's books were a combinaton of novels and compilations of short stories. In 1952, at the age of 33, he was committed into a mental institution and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He received electric shock treatments, a matter that upset him much throughout the rest of his life. His condition was later reclassified as manic-depressive. Throughout the latter half of his life he was in and out of institutions and while he still wrote, he had experienced difficulty in getting his works published. He struggled financially at the end of his life and spent the last five years in low rent hotels. By the time of his death, all of his books were out of print.\n\nScope and Content: This collection includes advertising, correspondence, poems and short stories of Robert Lowry.
