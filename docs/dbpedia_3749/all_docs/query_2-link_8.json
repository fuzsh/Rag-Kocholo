        "text": "In today’s world, Easter is often secularized. Many think of hunting Easter eggs, the Easter Bunny, and Easter Parades when they hear the word Easter. Yet, Easter is much more! It’s…\n\nwhen we celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Messiah!\n\n########\n\nOne of my favorite hymns at Easter is the one I sang every Easter morning when I was a young boy. Sometimes I attended sunrise services out in the open among the trees and flowers, and at other times I sang the hymn in the church. Wherever I sang it I remember stooping as low as I could and then when it was time for the chorus to begin, I would suddenly jump up. It was that hymn….\n\nUP FROM THE GRAVE HE AROSE\n\nHere is the story behind the hymn.\n\nThis hymn was inspired by the story of the angel at the empty tomb of Jesus who said to the frightened women who had come to the tomb, “He is not here; he has risen.” Luke 24:6 NIV\n\nThe text was written and the tune was composed in 1874 by Robert Lowry. He had been a Christian since he was seventeen years old, and as a preacher he had pastored churches in New York and New Jersey. He had moved to preach at the First Baptist Church in Lewisburg, PA, where he also served there as a professor at Bucknell University.\n\nOne evening Robert Lowry was having his nightly devotions and was thinking about the events associated with Christ's death and resurrection.\n\nHe soon found himself sitting at a small pump organ in the parlor of his home. (A pump organ is much smaller than a pipe organ, and requires the organist to pump with his foot to produce the musical sound.) In a very spontaneous fashion, Lowry penned the words and music for the song that echoed in his mind. Many of his hymns like this one were composed on that small organ as he would pump with his foot.\n\nThe hymn was only one of more than 500 hymns written by Robert Lowry, who also edited over twenty hymnals. He said, “I am always amazed at how quickly some of our favorite hymns were written”. This one was no exception.\n\nOther hymns you may be familiar with that he wrote were Nothing But The Blood of Jesus, Shall We Gather at the River, and I Need Thee Every Hour. Many of the hymns written by Lowry became very popular and have been used and sung at evangelistic revivals and in churches all over the world.\n\nDr. Lowry considered his position as a preacher to be his primary occupation and his music ability as a hymn writer/composer to be secondary. He couldn’t deny the success of his hymns, but delivering sermons was much more important to him. Music to him was a “side issue,” an “efflorescence,” and writing a hymn ranked far below preparing and delivering a sermon. Yet almost a century later his hymns remain a potent force in many gospel gatherings.\n\nLooking back almost 150 years, and in one of God’s Other Ways©, Lowry is better remembered for his hymns, and his sermons are mostly forgotten.\n\nLowry’s hymn, Up From the Grave He Arose, begins slowly in a dirge-like tone, and then the refrain switches into a joyous melody.\n\n(1) Low in the grave He lay, Jesus my Savior,\n\nWaiting the coming day, Jesus my Lord!\n\nUp from the grave He arose,\n\nWith a mighty triumph o'er His foes,\n\nHe arose a Victor from the dark domain,\n\nAnd He lives forever, with His saints to reign.\n\nHe arose! He arose!\n\nHallelujah! Christ arose!\n\n(2) Vainly they watch His bed, Jesus my Savior;\n\nVainly they seal the dead, Jesus my Lord!\n\nUp from the grave He arose,\n\nWith a mighty triumph o'er His foes,\n\nHe arose a Victor from the dark domain,\n\nAnd He lives forever, with His saints to reign.\n\nHe arose! He arose!\n\nHallelujah! Christ arose!\n\n(3) Death cannot keep its Prey, Jesus my Savior\n\nHe tore the bars away, Jesus my Lord!\n\nUp from the grave He arose,\n\nWith a mighty triumph o'er His foes,\n\nHe arose a Victor from the dark domain,\n\nAnd He lives forever, with His saints to reign.\n\nHe arose! He arose!\n\nHallelujah! Christ arose!\n\n#########\n\nCHRIST IS RISEN; CHRIST IS RISEN, INDEED!. These familiar words will be heard in churches all over the United States and around the world on Easter Sunday morning.\n\nUse this link to listen to a rendition of this song:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN77HjfAc8k\n\n###########\n\nHe is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: ‘The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.’ Luke 24:6-7 NIV\n\nThe angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.” Matthew 28:5-6 NIV\n\nPraise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead… 1 Peter 1:3 NIV\n\n########\n\nNote: North of the equator Resurrection or Easter Sunday typically falls on a different date each year. Easter is always the first Sunday after or on the first full moon, after spring arrives."
