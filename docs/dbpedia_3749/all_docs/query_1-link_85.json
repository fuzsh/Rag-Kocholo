        "text": "Robert Lowry Rutherford, 71, of Kingston, Okla.passed away December 17, 2021. Rob was born February 24, 1950, in Dallas, Texas to the late Tot and Bubba Rutherford.\n\nRob served his country in the Air Force from 1969-1973 and was stationed in Guam, the Philippines and in Vietnam. He worked in the electronics business where he met many lifelong friends including the love of his life. When he married Cookie, he gained a bonus son, Shawn. Shawn was a rebellious 14-year-old, but he quickly discovered that Rob was always there for him. Rob cherished being a dad and he was the most awesome Papa to their two grandsons.\n\nHe and Cookie moved to Kingston in 2012 and loved every minute of it. He was recently diagnosed with lung cancer but God graciously took him home so he wouldnâ€™t have to suffer the brutal treatments.\n\nRob loved his Lord and Savior, his family and friends and their wonderful neighbors. He thoroughly enjoyed beating Cookie on the pool table every chance he got. He also loved taking their boat out on the lake and listening to music.\n\nRob leaves behind his wife Cookie, their son Shawn Wheeler, his wife Raechell and grandsons Nick and Chris; his sister Georgia; brother-in-law Russell and wife Linda; several nieces, nephews and cousins; and by his biological son Troy Ficklin.\n\nThose that went before him are his sister Dinah Beth; his brother-in-law Mike Wheeler and nephew Cris Wheeler whom he shared a birthday with and dearly loved.\n\nMemorials can be sent to Kingston First Baptist Church or to the animal shelter of your choice.\n\nA memorial service will be held on January 7, 2022, at 1:00 p.m. at the Kingston First Baptist Church in Kingston, Okla. Pastors Steve Beebe and Joe Patterson will officiate the service. Services will be under the direction of Watts Funeral Home in Madill, Okla. Condolences may be sent to wattsfuneralhome.com."
