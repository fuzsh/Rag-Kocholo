        "text": "dbo:abstract\n\nروبرت لوري (بالإنجليزية: Robert Lowry)‏ هو ملحن أمريكي، ولد في 12 مارس 1826 في فيلادلفيا في الولايات المتحدة، وتوفي في 25 نوفمبر 1899 في بلينفيلد في الولايات المتحدة. (ar)\n\nRobert Lowry (* 12. März 1826 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; † am 25. November 1899 in Plainfield, New Jersey) war ein US-amerikanischer Literaturprofessor, baptistischer Geistlicher und Komponist zahlreicher Erweckungslieder. (de)\n\nRobert Lowry (March 12, 1826 – 25 November 1899) was an American preacher who became a popular writer of gospel music in the mid- to late-19th century. His best-known hymns include \"Shall We Gather at the River\", \"Christ Arose!\", \"How Can I Keep from Singing?\" and \"Nothing But The Blood Of Jesus\". Born in Philadelphia, Lowry studied at the University at Lewisburg and entered the Baptist ministry in 1854. During the following 45 years he held a number of pastorates in New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Between 1869 and 1875 he combined his pastoral work with a professorship in rhetoric at his alma mater, and later served as the University's chancellor. From 1868 he acted as hymnals editor to Biglow and Main, the country's leading publisher of gospel and Sunday School music; under his supervision more than 20 hymnals were produced by the firm, many of wide and enduring popularity. Despite his protestations that preaching was his main vocation and that music was merely a sideline, it is as a hymnwriter that Lowry is chiefly remembered, ranking with such as W. H. Doane and Ira D. Sankey as one of the originators of a musical tradition that has lasted until the modern era of revival. (en)\n\nRobert Lowry, född 12 mars 1826, död 25 november 1899, var en amerikansk psalmförfattare och koralkompositör. Lowry arbetade vid universitetet i Lewisburg (senare omdöpt Bucknell University), där han blev professor i litteratur. Han förordnades som baptistisk minister och pastor i West Chester, Pennsylvania, Bloomingdale Baptist Church, New York City; Hanson Place Baptist Church, Brooklyn, New York, First Baptist Church, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, och Park Avenue Baptist Church, Plainfield, New Jersey. Han arbetade även som en musikredaktör på Biglow Publishing Company, och var en av grundarna till Sixth Avenue Baptist Church i New York. Han skrev omkring 500 Gospellåtar. Han finns representerad med fyra tonsättningar i Den svenska psalmboken 1986 (nr 12, 94, 252 och 300) och ytterligare några i Frälsningsarméns sångbok 1990. (sv)\n\ndbp:quote\n\n\"We owe a debt of gratitude to him and so many others of his day who have enriched our garden of psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and enabled us to teach and admonish one another even as we express our praise and devotion to our Lord musically.\" (en)\n\n\"I was in London, and had gone to meeting in the Old Bailey ... I was preparing to leave, when the chairman of the meeting announced that the author of 'Shall We Gather at the River?' was present, and I was requested by name to come forward. Men applauded and women waved their handkerchiefs as I went to the platform. It was a tribute to the hymn; but I felt, when it was over, that, after all, I had perhaps done some little good in the world, and I felt more than ever content to die when God called.\" (en)"
