Lowry and Katherine Lowry (Eggleston). Early in life he moved to Anacortes, Washington where he graduated from high school in 1966. He lettered every year in 3 sports – football, wrestling, and track. He attended Skagit Valley Community College for two years on a wrestling scholarship before joining the Army in 1969. Chuck was in the 101st Airborne division in Vietnam, received a Purple Heart, and was honorably discharged in May of 1972. He then continued his education at the University of Washington, joining the Theta Chi Fraternity. In the Fall of 1972, he met his lifelong love. Pam and Chuck met on a blind date and it was love at first sight. They were married September 2, 1973.\n\nIn 1973 Chuck graduated from UW with an Accounting degree, and in 1979 received his MBA from UPS. Chuck started his career working for a prominent accounting firm, from there moved into banking starting in the Treasury Division of a local bank. He later moved into the brokerage side as a securities compliance officer, ending his career at a large brokerage firm. After his retirement in 2009, Chuck concentrated boating, traveling and volunteering. One of his favorite destinations was Maui where he paddled outrigger canoes daily.\n\nImmediately after his marriage to Pam, they purchased their first sailboat. This led to a lifetime of sailing the Salish Sea together. They joined Seattle Yacht Club in 1977 where Chuck participated heavily in sailing and volunteer jobs in the Club. He was chairman of numerous committees, Club Treasurer, and Commodore in 2012. He was one of the founders of Northwest Amateur Sailing and Racing Association (NASRA), a non-profit organization benefiting sailing, which brought a fleet of small sailboats to the Club, which are still being used today. Because of his leadership role in Seattle Yacht Club, Chuck became active in the International Council of Yacht Clubs (ICOYC), serving as Vice President of the North Americas and, at the time of his death, he was serving as Secretary of the entire ICOYC group. His involvement in ICOYC led he and Pam to numerous travels around the world to participate in forums and cruises. They met numerous friends throughout the world. Chuck remained an extremely active member of Seattle Yacht Club for the remainder of his life. Through members of SYC, he because active in the Amateur Radio group. Chuck and Pam enjoyed checking in to the local boater’s net each morning. Chuck maintained a General License under the call sign K1 CRL.\n\nFamily was extremely important to Chuck. Chuck and Pam have two children, Christine Marie Fraser (Seth), Issaquah, Washington, and Philip Ward Lowry (Kristen), Buda, Texas, and two granddaughters, Cayla Fraser (7) and Sloane Fraser (4). His family was the light of his life. He was a devoted husband, father, grandfather, brother-in-law, and uncle. Recently, he loved snow skiing with Christine, Cayla, and Sloane, and was so proud that they were learning to enjoy skiing in the Northwest.\n\nChuck and Pam have lived in Beaux Arts Village for 44 years. As was his character, Chuck was a dedicated volunteer in the Village. He served on the Town Council and was Mayor for 16 years. Lately, he was serving as Dockmaster and spearheaded many projects around the Village – building barbecues, stairs, paths, and advising on many other projects. He was well loved in his neighborhood because of his kind disposition and his willingness to help anyone. He was truly a “gentle” man.\n\nDuring the years that his children were growing up, Chuck was an active member of his church. He was Treasurer of the church for many years and participated in numerous mission trips to Tijuana, Mexico to build houses. Chuck was a great role model for the youth since he was such a calm, caring person. He loved being a table parent at a youth program at the church. His kind and gentle ways were a calming influence on otherwise rowdy children. Later, Chuck and Pam were thrilled to be participating in church events with their children and grandchildren.\n\nDuring the 49 summers that Chuck and Pam were married, they always spent time boating in the San Juan and Gulf Islands, along with spending time at a family cabin on Lindbergh Lake in Montana. Chuck was the best at maintenance. Whether on the boat or at the cabin, he invariably had a tool belt close at hand. Because of his gentle nature and great mechanical skills, he was always ready to help those in need.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents and his two younger brothers. Chuck is survived by his wife of 49 years, Pam, daughter, Christine Fraser (Seth), and son, Philip (Kristen), 2 grandchildren, numerous family members and his faithful dog, Harley (named because of Chuck’s love of his Harley Davidson motorcycle). Everyone loved Chuck because of his calm demeanor and measured thoughts. He was extremely well regarded and loved by everyone. Chuck, we will miss you immensely!\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held at the Seattle Yacht Club beginning promptly at 2:00 p.m. on\n\nTuesday, November 8. Donations can be made to Northwest Amateur Sailing and Racing Association\n\n(NASRA, c/o Seattle Yacht Club, 1807 East Hamlin Street, Seattle, WA 98012)."
