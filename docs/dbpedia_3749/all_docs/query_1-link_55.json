Running the funeral home has truly been a family affair with 4 generations of Baslerâ€™s involved in funeral service.\n\nBasler Funeral Home serves all faiths and offers personalized services to accommodate all the families we serve.\n\nWhether you are wanting a traditional burial service with a casket and vault or a cremation service with an urn we have a variety of services and merchandise available to our families. Some of our families when they choose a casket, vault or urn also choose to have it personalized to express the life of their loved one. Many of our families include pictures into the services of their love ones by having collage boards or a DVD slideshow video. Most of the ways you can personalize the service can be done at no additional cost.\n\nWe live in a world where we want to stand out. We live our lives connected to our family and friends. We here at the funeral home understand that and will help you plan a funeral that reflects the way you lived your life. We can help you customize your obituary to include things that were important to you or theme your funeral to life you lived.\n\nOther items that may be of interest to families occasionally are keepsake memorial products. Anything from cremation jewelry, Thumbies (fingerprint jewelry), bookmarks and all sorts of printed materials and other products are available to remember your loved one in a more personal way.\n\nThe Basler Family and staff are here to take care of your family at your time of need or in advance as well. We truly are people who know you, people you can rely on, today and tomorrow."
