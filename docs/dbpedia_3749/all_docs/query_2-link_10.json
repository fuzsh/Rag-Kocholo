        "text": "Hi, friends. Here’s the second installment of the “Story Behind” series leading up to Easter. Again, the theme this Easter is blood. [The featured image of the last post depicted the last supper; today’s depicts Jesus praying in the garden of Gethsemane, right after the supper and right before his arrest.]\n\nThe Reverend Robert Lowry, D.D.\n\nRev. Lowry, born in Philadelphia, PA in 1826, played musical instruments from a young age. At age 22, he went to school for ministry at University of Lewisburg, PA, graduating with the highest honors of his class. Rev. Lowry served as a pastor in several churches around the Northeast US. He had a great reputation–brilliant and friendly. Though preaching the gospel was his main vocation, he loved hymnology. Fun fact: he attempted to reduce music to a mathematical basis…it didn’t work. He wrote “Nothing But the Blood” in 1876. Others hymns he wrote the music but not the lyrics for include “Shall We Gather at the River?,” “I Need Thee Every Hour,” and “We’re Marching to Zion.” He died in New Jersey in 1899.\n\n“Nothing But the Blood” Devotional\n\nThe first verse directly alludes to the crucifixion story in saying that “nothing but the blood” can “wash away [our] sin.” In other words, we are only enabled to have our sins forgiven and forgotten because of Jesus’ sacrifice. Repeating “nothing but the blood” emphasizes that none of our idols, whether it’s a golden calf in Exodus or an iPhone X in 2018, can save us from sin and death…only God can do that! Verse 3 is also phenomenal, stating that “naught of good that I have done” can “for sin atone.” In other words, salvation cannot and doesn’t need to be earned; it’s a gift we don’t deserve!\n\n6 And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, 7 in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. 8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—9 not by works, so that no one can boast. 10 For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. Ephesians 2: 6-10 (NIV)\n\nLyrics:\n\nWhat can wash away my sin?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nWhat can make me whole again?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nRefrain:\n\nOh! precious is the flow\n\nThat makes me white as snow;\n\nNo other fount I know,\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nFor my pardon, this I see,\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nFor my cleansing this my plea,\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nNothing can for sin atone,\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nNaught of good that I have done,\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nThis is all my hope and peace,\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nThis is all my righteousness,\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nNow by this I’ll overcome—\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nNow by this I’ll reach my home—\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nGlory! Glory! This I sing—\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus,\n\nAll my praise for this I bring—\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nThis is the same congregation from the last post. Again, finding versions of these old hymns without the music altered is pretty difficult.\n\nHere is a popular, modernized version with additional lyrics and updated music.\n\nThanks for reading! Last post goes up on Friday."
