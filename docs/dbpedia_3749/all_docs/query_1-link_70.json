        "text": "Robert M. (Bob) Lowry, Jr. was born 25 February 1924 in Ballinger, Texas. At Ballinger High School he played football and golf and graduated near the top of his class. He entered Texas A&M University in 1941 and left in December 1942 after enlisting in the Army. He left the Army in 1943 to join the Class of 1946 on 1 July.\n\nOne of his roommates, Phil Farris, recalled: \"Bob was a warm hearted Texan whose good nature and personal warmth made all of is in Company H-1 his close friends. When the plebe system was about to overwhelm one of us, he jumped in with a bit of home spun philosophy to shake off the despair.\" Bob chose to become an Air Cadet yearling year and graduated with the wings of a second lieutenant in the Army Air Corps.\n\nBob's first assignment was to Arizona for further training. He took time out to marry Charlotte Louise Kinney in Ballinger, Texas, on 20 August 1946. From Arizona, Bob and Louise moved to Shaw Field, South Carolina, and then on to Langley Field, Virginia, where Bob was assigned to a tactical reconnaissance squadron, one of the first jet squadrons in what was then the Army Air Corps. An Air Force classmate, Hamilton (Bruce) Shawe, recalled Bob's next assignment: \"We spent a lot of time flying air shows in 1947 and 1948 and explaining to ex-WWII pilots that a jet did not have a propeller. During the summer of 1948, most of us were assigned to a tactical reconnaissance squadron at Yokota Air Base in Japan, flying the RF-80. When the Korean War started, Bob was one of the first pilots in the squadron to see combat, and, during his combat tour, he was awarded two DFC's and nine Air Medals. When I went down behind enemy lines, he and Bryce Poe were the two pilots in the squadron who risked their lives in an effort to locate my downed aircraft.\"\n\nFrom Korea, Bob was sent to Purdue University to gain his masters in Electrical Engineering prior to assignment as an instructor in the Electricity Department at West Point. In 1956, Bob was chosen to help organize the new Physics and Electrical Engineering Departments at the fledgling Air Force Academy. The Lowrys left in 1960, for the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Field, Alabama. From Maxwell, Bob was assigned to the Air Force Systems Command, in the Advanced Planning Group of the Electronic Systems Division. A friend Bob had served with at Langley back in 1947, Frank Dillon, remembered: \"Bob was the one person I could depend on to work on the most complex problems that came up.... A special office was opened at Cape Canaveral, and Bob was assigned there under Brigadier General Gus Lundquist. The mission was to get ESD more involved in the Space Programs. Bob had the experience and background, as well as the technical competence, to do the job...\" In 1966, Bob was selected to attend the Industrial College of the Armed Forces at Fort McNair, DC. A friend and Air Force classmate, Bryce Poe II, recalled: \"Not long after graduation from ICAF, Bob volunteered again for combat, this time in Vietnam. There he had one of the most critically important assignments related to the air campaign--commander of one of the Direct Air Support Centers. It was his responsibility to control any USAF, US Navy or RVN aircraft entering, crossing or operating in a Corps area. Be it strike, close air support, resupply, airlift, or airdrop, defoliation, courier, infiltration or extraction of forces, it was all his. For this he earned the Legion of Merit, and more pertinent, the respect of every combat airman. With the rank of colonel and press of command responsibility, he once again did not need to fly combat, but he would not ask it of others without learning about what was going on in the air. As in Korea, he flew as much or more than his subordinates, earning another DFC and nine more Air Medals.\"\n\nFrom Vietnam, Bob was assigned to J-6 in the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He suffered a massive heart attack in December of 1971 and retired 30 May 1973. The Lowrys moved back to Texas and Bob taught math at North Harris Community College, Houston, until 1978, when he accepted a position in Tehran, Iran with the Ramo Woolridge Corporation. That job ended as Bob recalled: \"I was kicked out during the 1979 revolution.\" Bob returned to Houston and worked for Houston Light and Power until 1983. He also taught part time at North Harris Community College and took courses there, all the history; philosophy, literature and religion courses offered. The effects of his massive heart attack finally took their toll and Robert M. Lowry, Jr. died 25 August 1993. He is survived by his beloved wife, Louise; two daughters. Debra and Mary; a son, Robert III; an aunt, Edna Grier; and six grandchildren.\n\nThe remembrances of Bob Lowry all reflect a similar theme; that Bob Lowry was loved and respected by his many friends as a loving husband and father who lived each day of his life by the West Point credo, Duty, Honor, Country. A classmate and friend from his days teaching at West Point, Edward A. Saunders, expressed well the feelings of loss felt by Bob's friends: \"I have lost one of my very best friends with Bob's passing. The times we were together were among the best of my life.\" Friend and classmate, Bruce Shawe, aptly put Bob's life into perspective when he reminisced: \"Husband, father, teacher, leader, friend, companion, patriot, a true son of West Point, Bob Lowry was all of these. He was also a fighter pilot with the consummate ability to take his craft to the outer limits of the flight envelope, and that special quality that makes fighter pilots a 'band of happy warriors'.\"\n\nAt Bob's funeral service, his daughter in law read a letter written by Bob's son, Robert M. Lowry, III: \"Dad was always wonderful to me, always gentle with me. He guided and taught me strongly but with kindness and humor. Dad was always there for me even when duty, honor, country required him to be on the other side of the world. Many times he risked his life for the freedom of the entire world. And he somehow managed to survive and return to his family and become an old soldier. Texan, Texas Aggie, West Pointer, Career Air Force Officer, Flyer, Husband, Father, Father in law, Grandfather, Christian, Hole in one Golfer; I love you, Dad.\"\n\nThe Class of 1946 joins his family and friends in proclaiming, \"Well Done, Bob; Be Thou At Peace!\"\n\n'46 Memorial Article Project and his family"
