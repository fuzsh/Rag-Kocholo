        "text": "On 21 July 1980, Slippery Rock State College contacted the First ROTC Region at Fort Bragg, North Carolina about establishing an Army ROTC program at Slippery Rock University. The mission establishing Army ROTC at Slippery Rock was assigned to Indiana University of Pennsylvania. An Extension Center Agreement was submitted on 21 August 1980 and was approved on 1 March 1981.\n\nIn January 1982, the first military science course was offered at the freshman level. The following fall semester, Both MS I and MS II classes were offered. The first Advanced Course class was offered in September 1982. The first commissioning class of Slippery Rock's ROTC program graduated in May 1984. In October 2002, Slippery Rock University became a host institution for Army ROTC.\n\nSince the beginning of Advanced ROTC, Slippery Rock Cadets have consistently scored among the top 20 of 93 schools in the First ROTC Region. Slippery Rock, along with its former host institution, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, has won the Governor's Trophy for the Best ROTC Unit in the Commonwealth three separate times. Additionally, Slippery Rock was awarded the General Douglas MacArthur Award as the best unit in this ROTC region, out of 42 colleges and universities, in 1993, 1995, 2002, and 2019. The commissioning class of 2007 had the honor of being #1 out of 19 schools in the 2nd Brigade, Eastern ROTC Region.\n\nSince its inception, Slippery Rock's Army ROTC Battalion has commissioned nearly 500 officers.\n\nSlippery Rock University's ROTC Program offers a first-rate military education to supplement the other fine academic offerings of the University. Slippery Rock ROTC graduates are currently serving successfully in the Army in leadership positions throughout the world.\n\nBANK THOMAS\n\nAcademic year: Senior\n\nHometown: Pattaya City, Thailand\n\nMajor/Minor: Accounting major with a leadership minor\n\nHobbies: Working out, hiking, playing soccer, spending time with friends, and going to the shooting range\n\nCampus Activities: Intramural soccer, Aspiring Futures Command Club, SRU ROTC Cannon Crew, and Color Guard\n\n“Participating in Slippery Rock University's ROTC program has been an enriching experience that has greatly enhanced my college years.
