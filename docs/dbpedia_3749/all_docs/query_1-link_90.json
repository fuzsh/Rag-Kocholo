        "text": "Whig and Tribune\n\nOctober 26, 1872\n\nWhig and Tribune, Jackson, Tennessee\n\nDied at his residence in Henderson County, Tenn., October 5th, 1872, after illness of pneumonia and typhoid fever, Dr. Robert Lowry, graduate of the Medical College of South Carolina.\n\nHis religion was Catholic, his charities are a living monument to his name's honor. He lived among the poor as their equal, and his great delight was to help the needy although his talent and wealth might have placed him among the rich and great, yet he chose an obscure life, and ever refused public honors when offered. He was one of Henderson County's oldest and best citizens; his age was about 67 years. He was born in Ireland and his nearest relatives mourn his death."
