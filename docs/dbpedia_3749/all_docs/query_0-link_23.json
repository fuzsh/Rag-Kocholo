        "text": "Lowry, Robert\n\nRifleman\n\nNo. 18111, ‘B’ Company, 13th Battalion, Royal Irish Rifles\n\nKilled in action on Saturday 1 July 1916 (aged 21)\n\nNo known grave\n\nCommemorated:\n\nCommonwealth War Graves Commission\n\nThiepval Memorial, France (Pier and Face 15 A and 15 B)\n\nNewtownards and District War Memorial\n\nPresbyterian Church in Ireland (PCI) Roll of Honour 1914 – 1919 for\n\nGreenwell Street Presbyterian Church Newtownards\n\nLoughries True Blues Loyal Orange Lodge (LOL) No.1948\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nRobert Lowry was born on 28 October 1894 in the townland of Ballymacreely and he was the eldest son of Robert and Mary Elizabeth Lowry (nee McDowell) who were married on 1 December 1893 in Killinchy Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church. Robert Lowry from Ballyminstra was a son of Robert Lowry, a thatcher. Mary Elizabeth McDowell from Ballymacreely was a daughter of James McDowell, a labourer.\n\nThe Lowry family lived in the townland of Ballywatticock, Newtownards.\n\nRobert Lowry Senior worked as an agricultural labourer and he and Mary has at least twelve children:\n\nRobert (born 28 October 1894 in Ballymacreely)\n\nWilliam McDowell (born 29 June 1896 in Ballygeegan)\n\nSusanna McDowell (born 28 November 1897 in Magherascouse)\n\nJohn (born 11 May 1899 in Magherascouse)\n\nThomas (born 25 October 1900 in Magherascouse)\n\nMary Elizabeth (born 7 March 1902 in Greengraves)\n\nSamuel (born 21 December 1903)\n\nJane (born 25 July 1905 in Ballywatticock)\n\nAlexander (born 23 January 1907 in Ballywatticock)\n\nDavid (born 24 June 1908 in Ballywatticock)\n\nAgnes McKnight (born 25 September 1909 in Ballywatticock)\n\nGeorge (born 24 February 1911 in Ballywatticock)\n\nThe four eldest children were baptised in Killinchy Presbyterian Church and the eight youngest in Greenwell Street Presbyterian Church Newtownards.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of the Great War Robert Lowry Junior worked as an agricultural labourer. He was a member of the Guild and Bible class at Ballyblack Presbyterian Chuch and he was secretary of both Loughries True Blues Loyal Orange Lodge (LOL) No.1948 and the local contingent of the Ulster Volunteer Force.\n\nAs soon as hostilities began Robert enlisted and he served with the 13th Battalion Royal Irish Rifles in 108th Brigade of the 36th (Ulster) Division. During the evening before the start of the Battle of the Somme he wrote a letter to his parents. In the letter his main concern was not for what he and his comrades would have to face the following day but rather for those back at home. Rifleman Robert Lowry was posted as missing in action after the first day of the Battle of the Somme.\n\nLike every other family that received such news, the Lowry family retained the hope that Robert might have survived. But it was not to be; in February 1917 Robert’s family received the official news that extinguished all hope – ‘missing since first of July 1916, now presumed to have been killed in action, place unknown.’\n\nRobert’s parents, brothers and sisters placed a For King and Country notice in the Newtownards Chronicle and it contained the verse:\n\nHis warfare o’er, his battle fought,\n\nHis victory won, though dearly bought;\n\nDear is the spot where our loved one is laid,\n\nDear is the memory that shall never fade.\n\nA little while and we shall meet\n\nThe loved one gone before,\n\nAnd we shall clasp his hands again\n\nOn yonder golden shore.\n\nAt the time of Robert’s death his brother William was at home having been wounded whilst on active service with the 9th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.\n\nRifleman Robert Lowry was 21 when he died and he has no known grave. He is commemorated on Newtownards and District War Memorial; in the PCI Roll of Honour for Greenwell Street Presbyterian Church Newtownards and in Loughries True Blues Loyal Orange Lodge (LOL) No.1948.\n\nRifleman Robert Lowry’s family placed and In Memoriam notice in the 7 July 1917 edition of the Newtownards Chronicle and it contained the verse:\n\nFor King and country well he stood,\n\nUnknown to coward’s fears;\n\nIn battle’s strife, he shed his blood\n\nWith the Ulster Volunteers.\n\nIn the bloom of life death claimed him,\n\nIn the pride of his manhood days;\n\nNone knew him but to love him,\n\nNone mentioned his name but with praise.\n\nRifleman Robert Lowry’s family placed and In Memoriam notice in the 6 July 1918 edition of the Newtownards Chronicle and it contained the verse:\n\nShort was thy life, our darling son,\n\nBut peaceful be thy rest;\n\nMother misses you most of all,\n\nBecause she loved you best.\n\nFar away from all who loved him\n\nSoldiers gently laid him to rest,\n\nIn a hero’s grave he lies sleeping –\n\nOne of God’s brightest and best."
