        "text": "Robert (Bob) Oliver Lowry passed away at 74 in the comfort of his Missoula home on Monday January 29, 2024, in the company of his beloved dog Bullseye.\n\nBob was born on December 19, 1949, in Alberta, Canada, to Cyril and Verda Lowry. He was the 7th of 10 siblings. Bob was brought up on a farm for the first few years of his life until his family moved to Missoula when he was 5, where he spent the rest of his childhood.\n\nBob was a globetrotter, travelling to dozens of countries over his lifetime. He developed his love of travel after his mother Verda sent him on a two day bus ride by himself at 11 years old to stay with his older brother Gary in Boise Idaho over the summer, and from there his travel bug flourished.\n\nBob's life has always aligned with his love of travel. During the Vietnam War, Bob was conscripted into the US Army. He made what he called one of the best decisions of his life by requesting a transfer to the Navy, where he spent 4 years on the USS Turner Joy from 1969 to 1973 as a Quartermaster, travelling all over Asia and Oceania.\n\nBob spent the majority of his career at Boeing, which he started with the help of his brother Gary who also worked for the company. Bob worked for Boeing through to retirement. As a 'Boeing Rep', he was posted in various countries around the world, including the UK, several locations in China; South Korea; and finally New Zealand where he was known by the Air New Zealand team as Boeing Bob.\n\nBob is survived by his two sons, Ollie and Robbie, and their families including his grandchildren, Jay, Dom, Ella and Maia; and his siblings, Gary, Gordon, Karen, Cheryl, Don, Randy and Larry."
