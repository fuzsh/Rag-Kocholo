        "text": "The Lowrys came to the US from Canada - I think my father was born in Ontario but family moved to Buffalo around 1900 - the year of the Pan American Exposition. He was born in 1879 and came to Buffalo with his Dad. The others followed a year later. All born in Canada except John, around 1900. I think Grandpa Lowry (now that I think of it I'm not even sure of his name - but I believe he was Robert -) sold band instruments - maybe even uniforms. He became bedridden I suppose when he was around 50 -+ I never ever remember seeing him out of bed.\n\nI doubt very much if Grandpa L. was much of a business man. The Lowrys were all dremers (the Irish in them?) ... Grandpa Lowry knew the other big theatre owner in Buffalo - a man named Shea - and was offered a partnership but it never came off. Don't know why. [Living] says Grandpa L. lost the use of his legs - he thinks perhaps GOUT might have played a part. I'm right - both he and [living]'s father were Robert James.\n\nBy 1906 - all the family were together and living at 356 Front Street, Buffalo. That was long before I knew anything about them. I only remember a rather dingy old place on 14th street in Buff. - later to become all Italian + who knows what now (1980's) - probably black, because Even in my old neighborhood - blacks were encroaching within a few blocks from the west side. They destroyed the area whenever they moved in, it seems - but that's a problem for society + not to be digressed upon here."
