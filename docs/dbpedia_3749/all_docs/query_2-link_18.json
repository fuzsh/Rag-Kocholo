        "text": "\"He is Risen!, He is Risen Indeed!\" Greetings to you on this most important day of remembrance in the Christian faith - Resurrection Sunday. It is a day of joy and celebration and one of the great hymns that describes the events of this day is the week's choice. Robert Lowry (1826-1899), the composer, was born in Philadelphia and seventeen years later became a Baptist. Soon afterward he entered the University of Lewisburg (now Bucknell) with the intention of becoming a pastor. After graduation, he took a church in West Chester. Over the next 45 years, he pastored five churches in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey. From 1869 on, he pastored while teaching at his alma mater and then serving as its chancellor. Music and a knowledge of hymnology were his favorite studies, but always as an avocation. Although Lowry wrote a number hymns and tunes and published many songbooks, his main interest throughout life was preaching God's Word. During spring of 1874, while having his devotions one evening, Robert Lowry was impressed with the events associated with Christ's resurrection, especially with these words recorded in Luke 24:6-8. \"He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. And they remembered his words.\" Soon Robert Lowry found himself seated at the little pump organ in the parlor of his home, and, in a very spontaneous fashion, there came forth the music and the words, giving expression to the thoughts that had been uppermost in his mind. The hymn was first published, in 1875. And for over a century since then Christians have joyfully sung this great hymn each Easter as part of their worship and praise for God's great gift. Sing along with it this week as we remember and celebrate Christ's conquering of death ... for each of us.\n\n1. Low in the grave He lay,\n\nJesus my Savior,\n\nWaiting the coming day,\n\nJesus my Lord!\n\nUp from the grave He arose,\n\nWith a mighty triumph o'er His foes,\n\nHe arose a Victor from the dark domain,\n\nAnd He lives forever, with His saints to reign.\n\nHe arose! He arose!\n\nHallelujah! Christ arose!\n\n2. Vainly they watch His bed,\n\nJesus my Savior;\n\nVainly they seal the dead,\n\nJesus my Lord!\n\nUp from the grave He arose,\n\nWith a mighty triumph o'er His foes,\n\nHe arose a Victor from the dark domain,\n\nAnd He lives forever, with His saints to reign.\n\nHe arose! He arose!\n\nHallelujah! Christ arose!\n\n3. Death cannot keep its Prey,\n\nJesus my Savior;\n\nHe tore the bars away,\n\nJesus my Lord!\n\nUp from the grave He arose,\n\nWith a mighty triumph o'er His foes,\n\nHe arose a Victor from the dark domain,\n\nAnd He lives forever, with His saints to reign.\n\nHe arose! He arose!\n\nHallelujah! Christ arose!\n\nListen to this hymn here. LISTEN\n\nThe Easter season should be the most important time of the year for all believers since it is a time when we remember and celebrate the death and resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It is a time when each believer should meditate upon the deep meaning of that profound event when God's Son took upon Him all of our sins so that we could be forgiven and reconciled with God. This week's hymn simply traces those events ... He was wounded, He died, He rose and now He lives ... for me! And someday He will be coming ... for me! And I love the final words of the hymn which proclaim, \"Then with what joy His dear face I shall see, Oh, how I praise Him! He's coming for me.\" W. G. Owens (1870-1945) is credited with writing the words and the music. However Gladys Watkin Toberts is said to have actually written verses 2-5. Little is known about either of them. Owens was a minister who for over 30 years conducted seaside missions in Northern Ireland under the banner of the Children's Special Service Mission, later known as the Scripture Union. It is said that the words of the first verse were inspired when, after World War I, Owens saw a wounded veteran limping past him on the street and he thought, \"He was wounded for me.\" This incident later reminded him of what Christ also had done for him. Meditate upon the words of each verse as you celebrate Good Friday and then the joyous Resurrection Day! He is risen!\n\n(1) Wounded for me, wounded for me,\n\nThere on the cross He was wounded for me;\n\nGone my transgressions, and now I am free,\n\nAll because Jesus was wounded for me.\n\n(2) Dying for me, dying for me,\n\nThere on the cross He was dying for me;\n\nNow in His death my redemption I see,\n\nAll because Jesus was dying for me.\n\n(3) Risen for me, risen for me,\n\nUp from the grave He has risen for me;\n\nNow evermore from death's sting I am free,\n\nAll because Jesus has risen for me.\n\n(4) Living for me, living for me,\n\nUp in the skies He is living for me;\n\nDaily He's pleading and praying for me,\n\nAll because Jesus is living for me.\n\n(5) Coming for me, coming for me,\n\nSoon in the air He is coming for me;\n\nThen with what joy His dear face I shall see,\n\nOh, how I praise Him! He's coming for me.\n\nYou can listen to an old vocal rendition of this my the White Sisters here. VOCAL\n\nHere is an interesting piano rendition. PIANO\n\nIf you have been a believer for many years you have no doubt faced times of great joy and times of great sorrow. You've faced many storms as well as times of great sunshine. And sometimes you have probably felt very lonely. And yet the Lord has promised to never leave us nor forsake us. As this week's hymn says, Jesus will walk with us through all of those times - the good and the bad. What a comfort that should be to us. I hope that you can testify that you, too, have experienced His presence, strength, guidance and peace throughout your life's walk. The words and music to this hymn were written in 1922 by Haldor Lillenas. who immigrated here from Norway as a little boy. He was very lonely in this new country but an old lady befriended him, and taught him the English language. Most importantly, however, she taught him Bible passages and led him to Christ. In 1906, he felt that God wanted him to preach and write songs. He married a songwriter, Bertha Mae Wilson, and they worked together. He was a composer and choirmaster for revivals and crusades. It is said that eventually he became one of the best song leaders in the nation. His salary finally allowed Mr. and Mrs. Lillenas to buy a house of their own. They could not furnish their house very well, but He needed some kind of piano or organ so, he bought an organ from his neighbor for five dollars. He used this to compose many great hymns. During his life he composed over four thousand hymn texts and tunes, and supplied songs for many evangelists. I don't know what caused him to write this particular hymn, but it probably came from his own experiences. Personally, it has been many years since I've sung this week's hymn. But recently I heard it on a radio station that was featuring old hymns. And since then the music and words have filled my mind. What a great reminder to us that Jesus will indeed walk with us through whatever comes our way. Thank Him for that this week.\n\n(1) Jesus will walk with me down thru the valley,\n\nJesus will walk with me over the plain;\n\nWhen in the shadow or when in the sunshine,\n\nIf He goes with me I shall not complain.\n\nJesus will walk with me,\n\nHe will talk with me;\n\nHe will walk with me;\n\nIn joy or in sorrow, today and tomorrow,\n\nI know He will walk with me.\n\n(2) Jesus will walk with me when I am tempted,\n\nGiving me strength as my need may demand;\n\nWhen in affliction His presence is near me,\n\nI am upheld by His almighty hand.\n\nJesus will walk with me,\n\nHe will talk with me;\n\nHe will walk with me;\n\nIn joy or in sorrow, today and tomorrow,\n\nI know He will walk with me.\n\n(3) Jesus will walk with me, guarding me ever,\n\nGiving me victory thru storm and thru strife;\n\nHe is my Comforter, Counselor, Leader,\n\nOver the uneven journey of life.\n\nJesus will walk with me,\n\nHe will talk with me;\n\nHe will walk with me;\n\nIn joy or in sorrow, today and tomorrow,\n\nI know He will walk with me.\n\n(4) Jesus will walk with me in life's fair morning,\n\nAnd when the shadows of evening must come;\n\nLiving or dying, He will not forsake me.\n\nJesus will walk with me all the way home.\n\nJesus will walk with me,\n\nHe will talk with me;\n\nHe will walk with me;\n\nIn joy or in sorrow, today and tomorrow,\n\nI know He will walk with me.\n\nOne of the challenges of writing this blog is trying to find videos of the music. Sometimes this has been impossible because they are no longer being sung. This week's choice provided such a challenge. But I finally found one. The quality is not very great, but the music is still there. LISTEN\n\nHave you ever been sharing the good news of the Gospel with someone and they listened attentively and you were so sure that they were ready to accept God's gift of salvation.? But when they seemed almost convinced of their need for the Savior they backed off and didn't make a decision. So often folks come to the point of making that life changing choice and then decide to wait expecting they might do it another time. That is so hard and heart wrenching to see. Especially when we know that they may never have another chance. Life is so unpredictable and can change so quickly. But that is what happened more than 2,000 years ago when King Agrippa told the Apostle Paul \"Almost, you persuade me to be a Christian.\" (Acts 26:28). In 1871 Reverend Brundage expounded upon this sad story in Acts, and then ended his Sunday morning sermon with the words \"He who is almost persuaded is almost saved, and to be almost saved is to be entirely lost\". Philip Paui Bliss (1838-1876), composer of many hymns, was in the congregation listening to Reverend Brundage's sermon. The pastor's powerful closing words left such an impression upon Bliss that he set about composing a song with the same sentiment. Almost Persuaded was published that same year in The Charm: A Collection of Sunday School Music, and quickly found its way into the majority of English Christian hymnals. The compelling words have since been sung at many an altar call. If you are one of those who have heard the Gospel and never responded, please don't wait another minute to accept God's free gift of eternal life.\n\n(1) \"Almost persuaded\" now to believe;\n\n\"Almost persuaded\" Christ to receive;\n\nSeems now some soul to say,\n\n\"Go, Spirit, go Thy way,\n\nSome more convenient day\n\nOn Thee I'll call.\"\n\n(2) \"Almost persuaded,\" come, come today;\n\n\"Almost persuaded,\" turn not away;\n\nJesus invites you here,\n\nAngels are lingering near\n\nPrayers rise from hearts so dear;\n\nO wanderer, come!\n\n(3) \"Almost persuaded,\" harvest is past!\n\n\"Almost persuaded,\" doom comes at last!\n\n\"Almost\" cannot avail;\n\n\"Almost\" is but to fail!\n\nSad, sad, that bitter wail—\n\n\"Almost,\" but lost!\n\nYou can listen to it here.
