From 1875 to 1885 he was Pastor to Park Avenue Baptist Church, and from 1880 to 1886 President of the New Jersey Baptist School Union. He composed many hymns, among which the popular \"Beautiful River\" has survived. Married, with three sons, he died in Plainfield, New Jersey, on November 23, 1899."
