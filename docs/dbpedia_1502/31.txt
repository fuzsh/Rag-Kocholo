THE phone kept ringing on Jack Curran's desk -- old grads, weeklies from Queens, national talk shows, good friends. They all wanted to talk about Curran's trip to the Final Four this weekend.

Curran is not exactly going to coach. That honor, that challenge, belongs to Jim Larranaga, the lanky youth in the photograph over Curran's shoulder, now a silver-haired coach at George Mason, the shocking outsider at the Final Four.

Instead, Curran is going as a guest of Larranaga, whom he coached at Archbishop Molloy High in Queens in the mid-60's. Yesterday, everybody started off talking about Larranaga, but they were really talking about Curran, still slender, still somewhat red-haired, still coaching baseball and basketball at 75, mentor to thousands.

"The thing is, after all these years, the players realize what they had here, and they all keep in touch," Curran said after fielding a few more calls.

Molloy has done well by its city boys (and, since 2000, its city girls). Among its graduates are Charles J. Camarda, an astronaut on the space shuttle Discovery; Raymond W. Kelly, the New York City police commissioner; Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney; and Lou Carnesecca, the longtime St. John's basketball coach, who preceded Curran as coach at Molloy. With Camarda safely back from space, Larranaga is the major alum at the moment.

The old grads must know how lucky they are to have this continuity with the Marist Brothers, who administer Molloy. Not everybody can go back decades later and connect with the old school and valued teachers like Curran.
