        "text": "With rapid growth of world wide web, the amount of quickly growing information has gone beyond our imagination. Many techniques are presented to help users to find the desired information from large data set quickly and accurately. Multi document summarization is effective one. The techniques that are used in summarization are feature based, graph based, cluster based, knowledge based, component based and CST based. The outline of all the methods is discussed in detail. Then all methods are compared and future work is discussed\n\nThe ubiquitous availability of computing devices and the widespread use of the internet have generated a large amount of data continuously. Therefore, the amount of available information on any given topic is far beyond humans&#39; processing capacity to properly process, causing what is known as information overload. To efficiently cope with large amounts of information and generate content with significant value to users, we require identifying, merging and summarising information. Data summaries can help gather related information and collect it into a shorter format that enables answering complicated questions, gaining new insight and discovering conceptual boundaries. This thesis focuses on three main challenges to alleviate information overload using novel summarisation techniques. It further intends to facilitate the analysis of documents to support personalised information extraction. This thesis separates the research issues into four areas, covering (i) feature engineering...\n\nWe describe a task-based evaluation to determine whether multi-document summaries measurably improve user perfor- mance when using online news browsing systems for directed research. We evaluated the multi-document summaries gen- erated by Newsblaster, a robust news browsing system that clusters online news articles and summarizes multiple arti- cles on each event. Four groups of subjects were asked to perform the"
