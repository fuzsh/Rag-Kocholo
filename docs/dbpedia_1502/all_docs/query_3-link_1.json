Board-issued ACLs are listed below in reverse chronological order.\n\nThe Central Valley Water Board uses CAOs to require substantial, long-term corrective actions for parties who discharge waste, or have the potential to discharge waste, in violation of an order or water quality objectives defined in a Basin Plan.\n\nAlldrin Boatright, LLC - February 2016 (Order R5-2016-0702)\n\nStaff conducted pre-storm season foothill inspections to evaluate sites with a potential for erosion and sediment discharges. The staff inspection of the Alldrin Boatright, LLC property (previously identified by the Stanislaus County Assessor information as Alldrin Sonora, LLC) found a significant potential to discharge waste. The investigation resulted in the Board's issuance of a CAO that required preparation of a Sediment & Erosion Control Plan and a Completion Report, the latter of which was to document site improvements to prevent sediment waste discharges.\n\nK2 Ranches LLC - September 2015 (Order R5-2015-0738)\n\nStaff was contacted by the Stanislaus County Department of Public Works regarding the alleged potential for sediment discharges from the K2 Ranches property. Staff then investigated the property and found a significant potential to discharge waste. The investigation resulted in the Boardâ€™s issuance of a CAO that required preparation of a Sediment & Erosion Control Plan, and a Completion Report, the latter of which was to document site improvements to prevent sediment waste discharges.\n\nTrinitas Almond Partners - July 2013 (Order R5-2013-0703)\n\nStaff was contacted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and Trinitas Almond Partners (TAP) regarding alleged sediment discharges from TAP properties. Staff then investigated the waste discharges to Blitz Creek, Stanislaus County, in December 2013. The investigation resulted in the Board's issuance of a CAO that required the discharger to prepare a stabilization and cleanup plan and a completion report.\n\nRosa, Lawrence A. Living Trust & Lori R.; and F.A. Maggiore & Sons, LLC - February 2013\n\n(Order R5-2013-0900)\n\nStaff investigated complaints of sediment discharges to Discovery Bay, Contra Costa County, in May and June 2011.

Maggiore & Sons, LLC (operator).\n\nLawrence, Steve; and Debraga, Ted - July 2011 (Order R5-2011-0704)\n\nStaff investigated a complaint of sediment discharges to Little Tule River, Shasta County, in June 2011. The investigation resulted in the Board's issuance of a CAO that required the discharger to prepare an erosion control and irrigation water management plan, and a completion report.\n\nStanislaus Almond Ranch - March 2008 (Order R5-2008-0701)\n\nStaff investigated complaints of sediment discharges to Peaslee Creek and the Tuolumne River, Stanislaus County, in January and February 2008.
