        "text": "Sign languages are the natural languages of deaf people and deaf communities. In the past 50 years, an impressive number of sign languages have come to be studied from a modern linguistic perspective, generating ground-breaking insights into the influence of the communicative channel on language structure. However, only a handful of these studies concern sign languages on the African continent. This is striking, particularly in view of the rich diversity of sign languages and signing communities found in Africa. Despite being limited in number, the studies available on African sign languages reveal unique structural features, not attested in non-African sign languages so far. Thus, research on African sign languages is important for the typology of sign languages, as well as for the general typology of African languages. The diversity in signing communities in sociolinguistic terms offer valuable opportunities for studying the impact of social setting on sign language structure; an issue of current debate in the sign language literature. Studies on African sign languages are relevant for a number of domains in general linguistics as well, including language contact, change, shift, acquisition, creation, and emergence. Last but not least, the scientific examination of African sign languages is of major importance for the emancipation and participation of deaf African in society.\n\nA heritage language is a minority language used in a context where a different language is dominant in the community. Codas (children of Deaf adults) who sign but may be dominant in the spoken language of their community present an interesting case due to the added difference in spoken/signed modality. The relatively new field of research on heritage sign languages builds upon our knowledge of phenomena at play when both the heritage language (HL) and the community language use spoken modality (e.g., varying degrees of proficiency in HL, interference of the community language on HL), as well as issues specific to balanced signed/spoken language bilinguals (e.g., the tendency to use blending, by which is meant simultaneously signing and speaking rather than code-switching). One aspect crucial to the study of heritage language is that of assessment. Two useful methods used for assessing production are (1) eliciting narratives on the basis of picture books or silent video clips and then measuring the data for features such as the speech rate or number of errors and (2) cloze tests. Methods are also under development to assess comprehension and perception in signed languages. Studying heritage sign languages promises to provide us new insight into strong tendencies already established in heritage spoken languages, such as speakers' difficulty with optionality and ambiguity, as well as speakers' better command of verbs in their heritage language than of nouns."
