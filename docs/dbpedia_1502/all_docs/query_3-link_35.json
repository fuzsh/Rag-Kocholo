        "text": "Brett Brown adds Chad Iske to Coaching Staff\n\nAdding to the list of head-noddingly good decisions the Sixers have made since Doug Collins left.\n\nBrett Brown to be next 76ers head coach\n\nThe 76ers and Brett Borwn have agreed on a 4 year contract, reports Ian Thomsen of Sports Illustrated.\n\nBrett Brown offered Sixers coaching job\n\nAfter a long search, the Sixers appear to have settled on the player development oriented Spurs assistant Brett Brown as their new head coach.\n\n2nd Round Coach Interviews Begin This Week\n\nWe might have a list of finalists. We might also not have a list of finalists. Sixers coaching search: For the Greater Good.\n\nCharles Barkley on Sixers Non-Coach\n\nBecause Charles Barkley remains a relevant and important source of information and opinions. They're losing no matter what.\n\nSixers Coach: Top Two Include Brown...and Curry?\n\nMarc Stein sent out a series of tweets at some ghastly hour of the night intimating the new Sixers head coach will be one of two people: San Antonio's Brett Brown or our dear hold friend Michael Curry\n\nSixers Interested in Snyder, Atkinson\n\nIt's been 3 months since the Sixers had a head coach. They are thinking about hiring one. These are candidates.\n\nSixers Coach: Ed Pinckney, Adrian Griffin?\n\nSam Hinkie won't stop until all the rumors are proved false. He's apparently received permission to reach out to two Bulls assistants.\n\nSixers \"Officially\" Dump Aron For O'Neil\n\nBecause when things leak from the organization, deny first, then confirm. O'Neil previously held a similar position for the Knicks and New York Rangers.\n\nCeltics Hire Stevens; Sixers Only Coachless Team\n\nThere's something about Sam Hinkie having his pick of the entire universe to coach the Sixers. I'm bleeding confidence.\n\nSource: Spurs Coach Brett Brown to the Celtics?\n\nA source tells LB that Spurs coach Brett Brown, previously linked to Sixers, has mutual interest with Boston. That would leave the Sixers as the only team in the league without a head coach.\n\nSixers, Spurs Deny Brett Brown Coaching Rumor\n\nHey I think it's just cool that the Sixers and Spurs are agreeing on something. We must be doing something right!\n\nMAYBE: Sixers Hire Spurs Asst Brett Brown\n\nThe Sixers finally have a head coach. And he's a Spurs assistant. This is the best night of my life.\n\nSixers Gonna Sixers, Offseason Rumor Style\n\nYou can take the Sixers out of Sixers, but you can't take the SIXERS out of SIXERS. Running the gamut of storylines for the team right now with help from Friday Night Lights.\n\nCoaching Update: Sixers Interested in Spurs' Brown\n\nBrett Brown has been with the Spurs since 2002, working as an assistant coach and in player development.\n\nKnicks Exec Close to Joining Sixers\n\nHe resigned from the Knicks spot last year. Please God let it be as a consulting role. We have enough consultants to field a separate basketball team.\n\nSixers Coaching Search: Just Wait Longer\n\nThe Sixers will take their good, sweet time in hiring a coach. Sam Hinkie wants to make sure he has the personnel in order before bringing in the guy to coach 'em. Dig it."
