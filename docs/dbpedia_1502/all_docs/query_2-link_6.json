        "text": "The problem of defining and naming cell types has many similarities to those of genes in genomics, where there is a practical need to track individual sequencing and assembly results as distinct and self-contained entities, while simultaneously recognizing the goal for a singular reference that the community can use to map sequencing data into a common context (Frankish et al., 2019; Harrow et al., 2012; Kitts et al., 2016). Here, a similar strategy is proposed for cell type nomenclature: Use of a standardized series of identifiers for tracking cell types referenced to individual studies, in addition to providing a mechanism for defining common identifiers (Figure 1A). At the core of the schema are two key concepts: (1) a taxonomy, defined as the output of a computational algorithm applied to a specific dataset, which must be generated prior to implementation of this schema, and (2) a cell set, which can represent any collection of cells within a specific taxonomy (see Table 1 for definitions of key terms). These components are generated through the input of data and information generated from analysis that identifies provisional cell types (sometimes called cell types for convenience). These are analytically relevant cell sets that represent quantitatively derived data clusters defined by whatever classification algorithm generated the taxonomy. Provisional cell types can be organized as the terminal leaves of a hierarchical taxonomy using a dendrogram, as a non-hierarchical community structure, or both. Taxonomies and cell sets are assigned unique identifier tags, as described below, and additional metadata can be stored alongside these tags for use with future databasing and ontology tools. These properties can be tracked using a relational graph or other database service, in a qualitatively similar manner to how transcripts are tracked across different versions of GENCODE genome builds (Frankish et al., 2019).\n\nFigure 1\n\nTable 1\n\nA major goal of the CCN is to track taxonomies and their associated cell sets by providing an easy-to-understand schema that is widely applicable to new and published taxonomies and that can be implemented through a user-friendly code base. The CCN is compatible with taxonomies generated from either single or multiple modalities, taxonomies applied to cells from overlapping datasets, and reference taxonomies (discussed in detail below). Each taxonomy is assigned a unique taxonomy id of the format CCN[YYYYMMDD][#], where ‘CCN’ denotes this nomenclature convention; Y, M, and D represent year, month, and day, respectively; and # is an index for compiling multiple taxonomies on a single day. Each taxonomy can also be assigned metadata, such as species, but such details are outside the scope of the CCN. Within each taxonomy, cell sets (and therefore also provisional cell types) are assigned multiple identifier tags, which are used for different purposes. Cell set accession IDs track unique cell sets across the entire universe of taxonomies and are defined as CS[YYYYMMDD][#]_[unique # within taxonomy], where CS stands for ‘cell set’ and the date and number match the taxonomy id. Cell set labels are useful for constructing cell sets from groups of provisional cell types, but can otherwise be ignored. Cell set aliases represent descriptors intended for public use and communication, including data-driven terms, historical names, or more generic cell type nomenclature. For convenience these are split into at most one preferred alias, which represents the primary tag for public consumption (e.g., the cell type names used in a manuscript), and any other additional aliases. Additionally, each cell set can have at most one aligned alias, which is a biologically driven term that is selected from a controlled vocabulary. Aligned aliases generally are assigned to only a subset of cell sets by alignment to a reference taxonomy, but in principle can be assigned in any taxonomy or taxonomies (e.g., if a rare type is identified that is missing from the reference). The CCN includes a specific system for assigning such aliases in the mammalian cortex using properties that are predicted to be largely preserved across development, anatomical area, and species, which will be discussed in detail. Furthermore, the CCN includes a series of metadata tags tracking the provenance and anatomy of cell sets. The cell set alias assignee and cell set alias citation indicate the person and permanent data identifier associated with each cell set alias. The cell set structure indicates the location in the brain (or body) from where associated cells were primarily collected. Ideally, this will be paired to an established ontology using the cell set ontology tag; in this case, we use UBERON since it is designed as an integrated cross-species anatomy ontology (Haendel et al., 2014). Finally, the CCN is compatible with incorporation of additional taxonomy-specific or future global cell set metadata or descriptors. This could include donor metadata (e.g., age or sex), summarized cell metadata (e.g., cortical layer or average reads), or additional cell set tags. In particular, the concept of a cell set level is often useful for distinguishing highly specific but statistically less confident provisional cell types from the more general and more statistically robust cell sets.\n\nThe CCN is currently in use by the Allen Cell Types Database for transcriptomic taxonomies (http://celltypes.brain-map.org/rnaseq/) and is being applied to taxonomies generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN; https://biccn.org/) (Bakken et al., 2020a; Adkins et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020a), a consortia of centers and laboratories working collaboratively to generate, analyze, and share data about brain cell types in human, mouse, macaque, and other non-human primates.\n\nMammalian brain cell types inhabit a complex landscape with fuzzy boundaries and complicated correspondences between species and modalities, leading to a variety of disparate solutions for naming cell types. Thus, a challenging and potentially contentious question in cell type classification is how these newly identified cell types should be named, or in the context of the CCN, what should be put in the ‘cell set aligned alias’ identifier. The CCN utilizes a strategy for naming cell types in the mammalian cortex that includes properties that are cell intrinsic and potentially well conserved between species (Table 2). This convention is used as the cell set aligned alias tag in the CCN and ideally should directly map to cell types defined in a relevant ontology (i.e., Cell Ontology [Diehl et al., 2016] or Neuron Phenotype Ontology [Gillespie et al., 2020]). While admittedly underdeveloped, this convention has been applied to multiple studies of the primary motor cortex (M1; as discussed below) and represents only a starting point for discussion.\n\nTable 2\n\nFor glutamatergic neurons, cell types are named based on predominant layer(s) of localization of cell body (soma) and their predicted projection patterns. The relatively robust laminarity of glutamatergic cell types has been described based on cytoarchitecture in multiple mammalian species for many years (e.g., Rakic, 1984), and has been confirmed using RNA in situ hybridization (Hodge et al., 2019; Tasic et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2012), and a combination of layer dissections and scRNA-seq (Hodge et al., 2019; Tasic et al., 2018). While in humans many cell types do not follow the layer boundaries defined by cytoarchitecture entirely, laminar patterning is still generally well conserved between human donors and mice (Hodge et al., 2019). In adult mouse visual cortex, projection targets for cell types have been explicitly measured using a combination of retrograde labeling and scRNA-seq (Tasic et al., 2018; Tasic et al., 2016). By aligning cell types across species, the projection targets in mice can be hypothetically extrapolated to putative projection targets in human or other mammalian species. For example, von Economo neurons are likely to project subcortically (Hodge et al., 2020). For GABAergic interneurons, developmental origin may define cell types by their canonical marker gene profile established early in development, with Pvalb and Sst labeling cell types derived from the medial ganglionic eminence and Vip, Sncg, and Lamp5 labeling cell types derived from the caudal ganglionic eminence (DeFelipe et al., 2013). Non-neuronal cell types have not been a focus of the studies cited and hence they are labeled at a broad cell type level only. However, knowledge from other single-cell transcriptomics studies on microglia (Hammond et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019), astrocytes (Batiuk et al., 2020), and oligodendrocytes (Marques et al., 2016) could be included in subsequent versions of this convention. In all cases, multiple cell types are present within a given class. While it may not be possible to directly translate every feature to other brain structure or other organs, most of the concepts proposed here could still be followed.\n\nThe CCN presents a flexible data structure for storing key information about taxonomies and cell sets, implemented through reproducible code with standard output files, along with a specific convention for naming mammalian neocortical cell types. It is applicable to taxonomies defined on any data type using any classification algorithm, including hierarchical cell type classification using scRNA-seq. While useful for these reasons alone, a primary utility of the CCN is to facilitate cross-study integration of cell type classifications, in particular when applied in the framework of a reference taxonomy. A reference taxonomy (or reference cell type classification) is any taxonomy based on one or a combination of high-confidence datasets, which can be used as a baseline of comparison for other datasets collected from the same organ system. For example, many researchers favor building a gene expression-based reference taxonomy based on high-throughput, high-resolution single-cell transcriptomics assays and then layering on additional phenotypic data as they become available (Yuste et al., 2020). Molecular, physiological, and morphological characteristics of cortical neurons are highly correlated based on simultaneous measurement in individual cells using Patch-seq (Berg et al., 2020; Gouwens et al., 2020; Scala et al., 2020), making such a strategy feasible. Many groups are currently performing scRNA-seq analysis in different areas of the brain, from all organs in the human body (Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 2017), from multiple mammalian species (Geirsdottir et al., 2019), and across trajectories of development (Nowakowski et al., 2017), aging (Tabula Muris Consortium, 2020), and disease (Mathys et al., 2019). Application of the CCN to these datasets will allow future reference taxonomies to evolve to accommodate these additional complexities by overlaying a common data structure and associated nomenclature.\n\nReference taxonomies and the CCN are two components of a multi-staged analysis workflow for aligning cell type classifications using datasets collected across multiple labs, from multiple experimental platforms, and from multiple data modalities (Figure 2). This workflow accommodates methodological differences in cell type definitions across studies and accommodates changes in reference taxonomies over time. The proposed workflow can be broken down into four broad stages:\n\nFigure 2\n\nFirst, many research teams will independently define cell types, identify their discriminating features, and name them using one of many available experimental and computational strategies. This represents the current state of the field. The CCN may be applied to each dataset independently at this stage.\n\nSecond, an initial reference cell type classification will be defined by taking the results from one or more (ideally validated) datasets and integrating these data together in a single analysis, if needed. Being high dimensional, high throughput, and relatively low cost, transcriptomics strategies are immediately applicable to many organs and species, and the goal is for reference cell types to be defined using this modality (Yuste et al., 2020). The CCN will then be applied to the reference taxonomy as described above – the CCN treats reference taxonomies identically to any other taxonomy. Importantly, aligned aliases should be defined in the reference taxonomy at this stage using a standard naming convention such as the one proposed above.\n\nThis reference cell type classification can now be used as a comparator for any related datasets, providing a mechanism for transferring prior knowledge about cell types across datasets. Cell sets from existing taxonomies can be renamed using one of the many validated alignment algorithms (e.g., Barkas et al., 2018; Butler et al., 2018; Gala et al., 2019; Johansen and Quon, 2019) by integrating data from this taxonomy with the reference, and then updating the cell set aligned alias to match terms defined in the reference. For new datasets, taxonomies can be generated using any clustering or alignment strategy followed by the same mapping and annotation transfer steps.\n\nFinally, new versions of the reference cell type classification should be periodically generated using additional data and/or computational methods, and this new classification will now be used as comparator for related datasets. Steps 3 and 4 can iterate at some to-be-defined cadence.\n\nThis workflow provides two complementary strategies to compare between taxonomies without needing to look at gene expression or other quantitative features. First, each taxonomy draws upon a common set of aligned alias terms, which allows for immediate linking of common cell sets between taxonomies (in cases where such information can be reliably assigned). A second strategy is through inclusion of common datasets across multiple taxonomies (reference or otherwise); if cells are assigned to the same cell sets in more than one taxonomy, then the cell sets can be directly linked. As a whole, this workflow provides a general outline for versioned cell type classification that could be specialized as needed for communities studying different organ systems and that provides a starting point for design of future cell taxonomy and nomenclature databases.\n\nA recent study profiling nearly half a million nuclei in primate and mouse primary motor cortex (M1) presents a taxonomy suitable for defining as a reference taxonomy (Bakken et al., 2020a). This study included single cell data from three separate ‘omics’ modalities (transcriptomics, epigenetics, and methylation) for mouse, marmoset, and human. Datasets were integrated in two ways. First, epigenetics and methylation datasets were integrated with snRNA-seq data within mouse, marmoset, and human independently (as shown in Figure 3A for human), which demonstrates a consistent genomic profile of cell types within species. Second, snRNA-seq from each species were aligned into a single integrated reference, which identifies cell type homologies across species that were presumably present in the mammalian ancestor to rodents and primates. This evidence-based assumption of cross-species homologies provides a strategy for transferring cell type characteristics from rodent studies (e.g., projection targets) into human, where experiments for making such measurements are not yet possible. A total of 11 taxonomies were generated (Figure 3B), and all were included in the same nomenclature schema, and the CCN was applied to this set of taxonomies as described above (see Supplementary Table 3 in Bakken et al., 2020a and Supplementary file 1). Figure 3C shows an example of these cross-species and cross-modality alignments for L6 CT cells, which are divided into two cell sets in the integrated taxonomy (and assigned the aligned alias tags L6 CT_1 and L6 CT_2) and includebetween one and seven cell sets in the single-modality taxonomies.\n\nFigure 3\n\nThis integrated taxonomy (Figure 3B, gray box) represents a suitable reference taxonomy for several reasons: first, the data generation, data analysis, and write-up spanned multiple BICCN-funded labs as part of a coordinated consortium project, indicating that this taxonomy was approved by a large subset of the neocortex cell typing community; second, while a number of differences were found between species, 45 core provisional cell types could be aligned across all species with transcriptomics; third, the taxonomies generated using epigenetics and methylation are largely consistent with results of this integrated taxonomy (Figure 3A, bottom panels and Yao et al., 2020a); and finally, this taxonomy can be linked with other quantitative features (such as morphology, electrophysiology, and expected projection targets) through comparison with mouse studies using complementary modalities such as Patch-seq (Gouwens et al., 2020; Scala et al., 2020) and Retro-seq (Tasic et al., 2018; Tasic et al., 2016). Using these linkages, aligned aliases of the format proposed in Table 2 were assigned to cell sets in the integrated taxonomy along with the 10 other species-specific taxonomies using a combination of (1) robust gene markers from the literature, (2) highly discriminating gene markers in these data, (3) projection targets in mouse, (4) historical names based on cell shape, and (5) broad or low-resolution cell type names (that directly map to ontologies), providing a starting point for how brain cell types could be named. A complete list of aligned aliases used is shown in Supplementary file 2.\n\nThis section addresses how to apply the CCN to an example taxonomy, from human MTG. Three inputs are required to run the CCN: (1) a cell type taxonomy (not necessarily hierarchical), (2) a cell metadata file with cluster assignments (and optionally additional information), and (3) optional manual annotations of cell sets (e.g., aliases), which typically would be completed during taxonomy generation. Example files for human MTG are saved in the repository’s data folder. Once all files are downloaded and the workspace is set up, several global variables are set, which propagate to each cell set as a starting point, and which can be updated for specific cell sets later in the process. A unique taxonomy_id of the format CCN[YYYYMMDD][#] is chosen, which will match the prefix for cell set accession IDs. To ensure uniqueness across all taxonomies, taxonomy_ids are tracked in a public-facing database, with future plans to transfer these to a more permanent solution that will also provide storage for accompanying CCN output files and relevant metadata. In addition, values for the cell set assignee, citation, structure, and ontology tag are defined, along with the prefix(es) for the cell set label. For human MTG, ‘CCN201908210’, ‘Trygve Bakken’, ‘10.1038/s41586-019-1506-7’, ‘middle temporal gyrus’, ‘UBERON:0002771’, and ‘MTG’ are used, respectively. Next, the dendrogram is read in as the starting point for defining cell sets by including both provisional cell types (terminal leaves) and groups of cell types with similar expression patterns (internal nodes). Figure 1B shows the annotated dendrogram in human MTG provided in the GitHub repository, under which are displayed the names of cell types presented in Hodge et al., 2019. These provisional cell types were named using an entirely data-driven strategy: (cell class) (L)(cortical layers of localization) (canonical marker gene) ([optional] specific marker gene), as discussed in Hodge et al., 2019.\n\nThe main script takes the preset values and dendrogram as input, assigns accession ids and labels for each cell set, and then outputs an intermediate table and a dendrogram with all CCN labels defined in the previous section (Figure 1C). By default, the provisional cell types are assigned their original name from the dendrogram as preferred alias (e.g., ‘Inh L1-2 PAX6 CDH12’), while this field is left blank for internal nodes. For all cell sets, fields for additional and aligned alias are also initially left blank. Cell set labels are formatted as the label prefix (e.g., ‘MTG’) followed by a list of the cell set labels of all included provisional cell types. For example, the ‘LAMP5/PAX6’ node in human MTG includes the first six cell types in the tree and therefore has the cell set label of ‘MTG 001–006’. The table with these CCN tags for each cell set is then written to a csv file for manual annotation, which includes two critical aspects: (1) creation of new cell sets and (2) updating CCN tags for any cell sets. Cell sets corresponding to groups of relevant cell types either based on biological relevance (e.g., LAMP5-associated cell types in MTG) or as defined using a non-hierarchical computational strategy can be added at this step. In addition, cell sets corresponding to metadata rather than cell types can also be added. For example, in human MTG, ‘CS201908210_154’ corresponds to the set of nuclei collected from neurosurgical tissue and is given a cell set label of ‘Metadata 1’ and a preferred alias of ‘Neurosurgical’.\n\nAfter finalizing these cell sets, they can then be annotated to include additional aliases based on known literature (e.g., assigning ‘basket’ or ‘fast-spiking’ to relevant PVALB+ cell sets), along with the assignees and citations from which such aliases were derived (e.g., ‘Nathan Gouwens’ and ‘10.1101/2020.02.03.932244’). As another example, Inh L1-4 LAMP5 LCP2 corresponds to Rosehip cells (see Boldog et al., 2018) and therefore an additional alias for this cell type is ‘Rosehip’. The structures and associated ontology tags could also be updated at this stage. For example, previous studies in mice suggest that most non-neuronal and GABAergic cell types are conserved across cortical areas (Tasic et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2020b). Although not done here, relevant cell sets could be generalized to an anatomic structure such as ‘Neocortex’ (UBERON:0001950). A final component of manual annotation is to update relevant cell sets with an aligned alias (e.g., a common usage term), which is critical for comparison of taxonomies in the CCN. In this case, aligned aliases for all cell sets were assigned by comparison with the human M1 reference (Bakken et al., 2020a), as shown in Figure 4 for glutamatergic neurons and as described in Use case 1. It is important to note that this step requires a previous computational alignment (or some other strategy to match cell sets) to use as evidence prior to assignment of the aligned alias; cell set alignment itself is not performed as part of the CCN.\n\nAfter completing the manual annotations, the updated table is read back into R for additional dendrogram annotation and for mapping of cells to cell sets. Dendrograms are revised to include the new cell sets and annotations, and then output in a few standard formats (.RData, .json, and .pdf) for ontology construction and other downstream uses. Individual cells are then mapped to cell sets using the cell metadata table, which includes a unique cell identifier, provisional cell type classification, and other optional metadata. Cells are then mapped to cell sets representing one or more provisional cell type using the annotated dendrogram and/or the updated nomenclature table using the cell set label tag. Finally, cells are mapped to remaining cell sets (if any) using custom scripts. This results in a table of binary calls (0 = no, 1 = yes), indicating exclusion or inclusion of each cell in each cell set (Figure 1D), which is written to another csv file as part of the process. This format is designed to allow for probabilistic mapping of cells to cell sets, which is beyond the scope of this manuscript. These output files are intended to be directly included as supplemental materials in manuscripts performing cell type classification in any species. In addition, the GitHub repository will be updated to include conversion functions to allow input into future community-accepted cell type databases, as such resources become available. Supplementary file 1 includes a table of applied nomenclature for all taxonomies discussed in this manuscript, along with cell to cell set mappings for a few example taxonomies."
