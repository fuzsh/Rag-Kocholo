The Evansville season was the only one counting towards Lickliter’s “preseason vs. end season” results. However, aside from a pair of impressive Sweet Sixteen runs at Butler, his pre-2012 stints at Iowa and Butler were nothing special. Lickliter’s Iowa teams ranked 174th, 87th, and 146th overall, and two of his six Butler squads finished outside the top 130.\n\n301. Tavaras Hardy, Loyola MD\n\n300.

Grant’s raw rank score is in line with expectations - the Cougars have finished in the KenPom top 100 once and have made one NCAA Tournament in the coach’s six-year tenure. From a relative score perspective, Grant’s first season in 2015 weighed down his ranking - again, that was expected. What wasn’t expected was Grant’s preseason expectation performances. Only in 2016 did Grant exceed preseason expectations per KenPom - every other season, Charleston has finished slightly below where they “should have”.\n\n241. Kyle Keller, Stephen F. Austin\n\n240.

Let’s instead look at why he lands at 104th on this list. First from a raw rank perspective - Enfield has had just ONE team in seven years at the helm of USC crack the KenPom top 50, and only two seasons has his Trojans made the NCAA Tournament. His Tourney appearance at FGCU and six USC top 100 finishes added to his score and kept his head above water.\n\nFrom a relative rank perspective, Enfield has performed pretty much how you’d expect. He crushed expectations in 2012 at FGCU (and actually underperformed in 2013) and has under-achieved or finished as expected in six of his seven seasons at USC. He significantly outperformed program norms at FGCU but has been worse than program norms with the Trojans.\n\n103. Richard Pitino, Minnesota\n\n102. Eric Henderson, South Dakota State\n\n101.

How bad was Drew’s relative score from his 2019 Vanderbilt season? Really bad. And so was his 2018 Vandy season, for that matter. But, Drew significantly exceeded preseason expectations in 2017 and his entire Valparaiso tenure was a success, save for 2014. Drew’s Valpo performance definitely is the primary reason behind his top-100 ranking, but he did notch a top 50 and top 100 finish at Vandy before being canned.\n\n94. Mick Cronin, UCLA\n\n93.

In my head, Cooley is one of the very best head coaches in the country for a multitude of reasons. But, peeling back the layers of his performance has made me think a little harder on that notion. From 2013 - 2017, Cooley outperformed preseason expectations at Providence, but he’s lagged behind in each of the past three years. Cooley has had five Tournament teams at Providence, but zero Sweet Sixteen appearances. And, only once has Cooley had a team finish inside the KenPom top 40.\n\nCooley did outperform program norms at Fairfield, where he coached from 2007 - 2011. His promotion from there to Providence factors into his overall score.\n\n87. Greg Lansing, Indiana State\n\n86. Bob Marlin, Louisiana\n\n85. Mark Turgeon, Maryland\n\n84.

His spot boils down to one thing - Adj. EM performance over program average. Mack has spent the past two seasons at Louisville and has done a good job overall (far exceeded expectations in 2019, underperformed in 2020). However, Rick Pitino’s 2002 - 2017 stint at Louisville, in which he captured a national championship, a few final fours, and several top ten finishes has put the program’s standard to the moon.

It’s Brownell’s Wright State (2007 - 2010) and UNC Wilmington (2003 - 2006) stints that vault him to such a high ranking. At UNCW, Brownell had two squads rank in the KenPom top 50.

I admit it looks odd to have Todd Golden at #42 and his predecessor, Kyle Smith, who took a promotion to coach Washington State, at #53, but let’s break down how good a year it was for Golden. 2020 was San Francisco’s BEST season in the KenPom era (dating back to 2002) from an Adj. EM standpoint. Golden’s squad finished the year ranked 74th after starting the season 136th, and would have climbed higher had they been able to steal one of their two close Gonzaga games.\n\nGolden is an interesting case to watch going forward. He inherited a good team chock full of Kyle Smith guys, which gave him a great starting point off which to work. Smith could be a reason Golden rose to the level he did in 2020, but lots of coaches inherit good situations and fail to execute. At 34, Golden has many years ahead of him in the head coaching ranks, and his willingness to embrace analytics has him ahead of the curve.\n\n41. Ben Howland, Mississippi State\n\n40.

Consistency has been the name of the game for Rice, who has finished in the KenPom top 100 eight times in 10 seasons and once in the top 50. Rice has exceeded preseason expectations seven of nine seasons since 2012, and has led Boise through its best stretch in program history.\n\nExternal factors are certainly at play here, as Boise has only been a member of the Mountain West (and had access to a much larger budget thanks in part to its football success) under Rice, but we should give credit to where credit is due. Rice is the coaching equivalent of a baseball player who racks up 3,000+ hits in his career with limited power.\n\n23. Mark Pope, BYU\n\nScore: 80\n\nRaw Rank: T-100th\n\nRelative Rank: T-2nd\n\n22.

Let’s start with Kevin Keatts, a coach who has come under fire recently for his lackluster three years at the helm of NC State. In those three seasons, Keatts has finished every year in the top 50, but is only one game above .500 in ACC play overall. But, 2020 was actually the only year in which Keatts failed out outperform his preseason ranking. In fact in 2018, he shocked the world by taking the 109th preseason-ranked Wolfpack to 42nd pre-Tournament. It’s also worth remembering Keatts led two of the best UNCW squads in program history in 2016 and 2017.\n\nMusselman’s squads have finished inside the top KenPom top 50 three of his five seasons as a DI coach. At Nevada, he owned the Mountain West to the tune of a 44-10 record from 2017 - 2019. This year’s Arkansas team finished a tad below expectations, but his Nevada years give him enough “Mussel” to rank in the top 20.\n\nUnderwood was criticized heavily by Illini fans after the 2018 and 2019 seasons and was likely looking at a firing if not for a strong 2020 season in which his squad would have made its first Big Dance since 2013. Despite a combined 26-39 (11-27) record over those two seasons, Underwood actually improved his team’s preseason ranking in each year. In his seven-year head coaching career, Underwood has never fallen below preseason expectations - his 2017 Oklahoma State job was the best of his career from an Adj.
