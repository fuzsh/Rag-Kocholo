        "text": "Correction of oral contrast artifacts in CT-based attenuation correction of PET images using an automated segmentation algorithm.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhmadian, Alireza; Ay, Mohammad R; Bidgoli, Javad H; Sarkar, Saeed; Zaidi, Habib\n\n2008-10-01\n\nOral contrast is usually administered in most X-ray computed tomography (CT) examinations of the abdomen and the pelvis as it allows more accurate identification of the bowel and facilitates the interpretation of abdominal and pelvic CT studies. However, the misclassification of contrast medium with high-density bone in CT-based attenuation correction (CTAC) is known to generate artifacts in the attenuation map (mumap), thus resulting in overcorrection for attenuation of positron emission tomography (PET) images. In this study, we developed an automated algorithm for segmentation and classification of regions containing oral contrast medium to correct for artifacts in CT-attenuation-corrected PET images using the segmented contrast correction (SCC) algorithm. The proposed algorithm consists of two steps: first, high CT number object segmentation using combined region- and boundary-based segmentation and second, object classification to bone and contrast agent using a knowledge-based nonlinear fuzzy classifier. Thereafter, the CT numbers of pixels belonging to the region classified as contrast medium are substituted with their equivalent effective bone CT numbers using the SCC algorithm. The generated CT images are then down-sampled followed by Gaussian smoothing to match the resolution of PET images. A piecewise calibration curve was then used to convert CT pixel values to linear attenuation coefficients at 511 keV. The visual assessment of segmented regions performed by an experienced radiologist confirmed the accuracy of the segmentation and classification algorithms for delineation of contrast-enhanced regions in clinical CT images. The quantitative analysis of generated mumaps of 21 clinical CT colonoscopy datasets showed an overestimation ranging between 24.4% and 37.3% in the 3D-classified regions depending on their volume and the concentration of contrast medium. Two PET/CT studies known to be problematic demonstrated the applicability of the technique in\n\nSpectral areas and ratios classifier algorithm for pancreatic tissue classification using optical spectroscopy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChandra, Malavika; Scheiman, James; Simeone, Diane; McKenna, Barbara; Purdy, Julianne; Mycek, Mary-Ann\n\n2010-01-01\n\nPancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer death, in part because of the inability of current diagnostic methods to reliably detect early-stage disease. We present the first assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of algorithms developed for pancreatic tissue classification using data from fiber optic probe-based bimodal optical spectroscopy, a real-time approach that would be compatible with minimally invasive diagnostic procedures for early cancer detection in the pancreas. A total of 96 fluorescence and 96 reflectance spectra are considered from 50 freshly excised tissue sites-including human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, chronic pancreatitis (inflammation), and normal tissues-on nine patients. Classification algorithms using linear discriminant analysis are developed to distinguish among tissues, and leave-one-out cross-validation is employed to assess the classifiers' performance. The spectral areas and ratios classifier (SpARC) algorithm employs a combination of reflectance and fluorescence data and has the best performance, with sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value for correctly identifying adenocarcinoma being 85, 89, 92, and 80%, respectively.\n\nDevelopment of PET projection data correction algorithm\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBazhanov, P. V.; Kotina, E. D.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nPositron emission tomography is modern nuclear medicine method used in metabolism and internals functions examinations. This method allows to diagnosticate treatments on their early stages. Mathematical algorithms are widely used not only for images reconstruction but also for PET data correction. In this paper random coincidences and scatter correction algorithms implementation are considered, as well as algorithm of PET projection data acquisition modeling for corrections verification.\n\nCorrecting Classifiers for Sample Selection Bias in Two-Phase Case-Control Studies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTheis, Fabian J.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nEpidemiological studies often utilize stratified data in which rare outcomes or exposures are artificially enriched. This design can increase precision in association tests but distorts predictions when applying classifiers on nonstratified data. Several methods correct for this so-called sample selection bias, but their performance remains unclear especially for machine learning classifiers. With an emphasis on two-phase case-control studies, we aim to assess which corrections to perform in which setting and to obtain methods suitable for machine learning techniques, especially the random forest. We propose two new resampling-based methods to resemble the original data and covariance structure: stochastic inverse-probability oversampling and parametric inverse-probability bagging. We compare all techniques for the random forest and other classifiers, both theoretically and on simulated and real data. Empirical results show that the random forest profits from only the parametric inverse-probability bagging proposed by us. For other classifiers, correction is mostly advantageous, and methods perform uniformly. We discuss consequences of inappropriate distribution assumptions and reason for different behaviors between the random forest and other classifiers. In conclusion, we provide guidance for choosing correction methods when training classifiers on biased samples. For random forests, our method outperforms state-of-the-art procedures if distribution assumptions are roughly fulfilled. We provide our implementation in the R package sambia.

Researches have shown that a base classifier performance might be enhanced by ensemble classification strategies. In this study, we construct rotation forest (RF) ensemble classifiers of 30 machine learning algorithms to evaluate their classification performances using Parkinson's, diabetes and heart diseases from literature. While making experiments, first the feature dimension of three datasets is reduced using correlation based feature selection (CFS) algorithm. Second, classification performances of 30 machine learning algorithms are calculated for three datasets. Third, 30 classifier ensembles are constructed based on RF algorithm to assess performances of respective classifiers with the same disease data. All the experiments are carried out with leave-one-out validation strategy and the performances of the 60 algorithms are evaluated using three metrics; classification accuracy (ACC), kappa error (KE) and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Base classifiers succeeded 72.15%, 77.52% and 84.43% average accuracies for diabetes, heart and Parkinson's datasets, respectively. As for RF classifier ensembles, they produced average accuracies of 74.47%, 80.49% and 87.13% for respective diseases. RF, a newly proposed classifier ensemble algorithm, might be used to improve accuracy of miscellaneous machine learning algorithms to design advanced CADx systems.

Clusters of microcalcifications (MCCs) are symptoms of DCIS that are recognized by mammography. Selection of robust features vector is the process of selecting an optimal subset of features from a large number of available features in a given problem domain after the feature extraction and before any classification scheme. Feature selection reduces the feature space that improves the performance of classifier and decreases the computational burden imposed by using many features on classifier. Selection of an optimal subset of features from a large number of available features in a given problem domain is a difficult search problem. For n features, the total numbers of possible subsets of features are 2n. Thus, selection of an optimal subset of features problem belongs to the category of NP-hard problems. In this paper, an attempt is made to find the optimal subset of MCCs features from all possible subsets of features using genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and biogeography-based optimization (BBO). For simulation, a total of 380 benign and malignant MCCs samples have been selected from mammogram images of DDSM database. A total of 50 features extracted from benign and malignant MCCs samples are used in this study. In these algorithms, fitness function is correct classification rate of classifier. Support vector machine is used as a classifier. From experimental results, it is also observed that the performance of PSO-based and BBO-based algorithms to select an optimal subset of features for classifying MCCs as benign or malignant is better as compared to GA-based algorithm.\n\nProposed hybrid-classifier ensemble algorithm to map snow cover area\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNijhawan, Rahul; Raman, Balasubramanian; Das, Josodhir\n\n2018-01-01\n\nMetaclassification ensemble approach is known to improve the prediction performance of snow-covered area. The methodology adopted in this case is based on neural network along with four state-of-art machine learning algorithms: support vector machine, artificial neural networks, spectral angle mapper, K-mean clustering, and a snow index: normalized difference snow index. An AdaBoost ensemble algorithm related to decision tree for snow-cover mapping is also proposed. According to available literature, these methods have been rarely used for snow-cover mapping. Employing the above techniques, a study was conducted for Raktavarn and Chaturangi Bamak glaciers, Uttarakhand, Himalaya using multispectral Landsat 7 ETM+ (enhanced thematic mapper) image. The study also compares the results with those obtained from statistical combination methods (majority rule and belief functions) and accuracies of individual classifiers. Accuracy assessment is performed by computing the quantity and allocation disagreement, analyzing statistic measures (accuracy, precision, specificity, AUC, and sensitivity) and receiver operating characteristic curves. A total of 225 combinations of parameters for individual classifiers were trained and tested on the dataset and results were compared with the proposed approach. It was observed that the proposed methodology produced the highest classification accuracy (95.21%), close to (94.01%) that was produced by the proposed AdaBoost ensemble algorithm. From the sets of observations, it was concluded that the ensemble of classifiers produced better results compared to individual classifiers.\n\nA method of measuring and correcting tilt of anti - vibration wind turbines based on screening algorithm\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXiao, Zhongxiu\n\n2018-04-01\n\nA Method of Measuring and Correcting Tilt of Anti - vibration Wind Turbines Based on Screening Algorithm is proposed in this paper. First of all, we design a device which the core is the acceleration sensor ADXL203, the inclination is measured by installing it on the tower of the wind turbine as well as the engine room. Next using the Kalman filter algorithm to filter effectively by establishing a state space model for signal and noise. Then we use matlab for simulation. Considering the impact of the tower and nacelle vibration on the collected data, the original data and the filtering data are classified and stored by the Screening algorithm, then filter the filtering data to make the output data more accurate. Finally, we eliminate installation errors by using algorithm to achieve the tilt correction. The device based on this method has high precision, low cost and anti-vibration advantages. It has a wide range of application and promotion value.\n\nGustaf: Detecting and correctly classifying SVs in the NGS twilight zone.\n\nPubMed\n\nTrappe, Kathrin; Emde, Anne-Katrin; Ehrlich, Hans-Christian; Reinert, Knut\n\n2014-12-15\n\nThe landscape of structural variation (SV) including complex duplication and translocation patterns is far from resolved. SV detection tools usually exhibit low agreement, are often geared toward certain types or size ranges of variation and struggle to correctly classify the type and exact size of SVs. We present Gustaf (Generic mUlti-SpliT Alignment Finder), a sound generic multi-split SV detection tool that detects and classifies deletions, inversions, dispersed duplications and translocations of â¥ 30 bp. Our approach is based on a generic multi-split alignment strategy that can identify SV breakpoints with base pair resolution. We show that Gustaf correctly identifies SVs, especially in the range from 30 to 100 bp, which we call the next-generation sequencing (NGS) twilight zone of SVs, as well as larger SVs >500 bp. Gustaf performs better than similar tools in our benchmark and is furthermore able to correctly identify size and location of dispersed duplications and translocations, which otherwise might be wrongly classified, for example, as large deletions.

Various new algorithms and commercial systems have been proposed and developed. However, none of the proposed or developed algorithm is a complete solution because it may work very well on one set of images with say illumination changes but may not work properly on another set of image variations like expression variations. This study is motivated by the fact that any single classifier cannot claim to show generally better performance against all facial image variations. To overcome this shortcoming and achieve generality, combining several classifiers using various strategies has been studied extensively also incorporating the question of suitability of any classifier for this task. The study is based on the outcome of a comprehensive comparative analysis conducted on a combination of six subspace extraction algorithms and four distance metrics on three facial databases. The analysis leads to the selection of the most suitable classifiers which performs better on one task or the other. These classifiers are then combined together onto an ensemble classifier by two different strategies of weighted sum and re-ranking. The results of the ensemble classifier show that these strategies can be effectively used to construct a single classifier that can successfully handle varying facial image conditions of illumination, aging and facial expressions.\n\nIndications for spine surgery: validation of an administrative coding algorithm to classify degenerative diagnoses\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLurie, Jon D.; Tosteson, Anna N.A.; Deyo, Richard A.; Tosteson, Tor; Weinstein, James; Mirza, Sohail K.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nStudy Design Retrospective analysis of Medicare claims linked to a multi-center clinical trial. Objective The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) provided a unique opportunity to examine the validity of a claims-based algorithm for grouping patients by surgical indication. SPORT enrolled patients for lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and degenerative spondylolisthesis. We compared the surgical indication derived from Medicare claims to that provided by SPORT surgeons, the âgold standardâ. Summary of Background Data Administrative data are frequently used to report procedure rates, surgical safety outcomes, and costs in the management of spinal surgery. However, the accuracy of using diagnosis codes to classify patients by surgical indication has not been examined. Methods Medicare claims were link to beneficiaries enrolled in SPORT. The sensitivity and specificity of three claims-based approaches to group patients based on surgical indications were examined: 1) using the first listed diagnosis; 2) using all diagnoses independently; and 3) using a diagnosis hierarchy based on the support for fusion surgery. Results Medicare claims were obtained from 376 SPORT participants, including 21 with disc herniation, 183 with spinal stenosis, and 172 with degenerative spondylolisthesis. The hierarchical coding algorithm was the most accurate approach for classifying patients by surgical indication, with sensitivities of 76.2%, 88.1%, and 84.3% for disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and degenerative spondylolisthesis cohorts, respectively. The specificity was 98.3% for disc herniation, 83.2% for spinal stenosis, and 90.7% for degenerative spondylolisthesis. Misclassifications were primarily due to codes attributing more complex pathology to the case. Conclusion Standardized approaches for using claims data to accurately group patients by surgical indications has widespread interest. We found that a hierarchical coding approach correctly classified over 90\n\nAdaptive convergence nonuniformity correction algorithm.\n\nPubMed\n\nQian, Weixian; Chen, Qian; Bai, Junqi; Gu, Guohua\n\n2011-01-01\n\nNowadays, convergence and ghosting artifacts are common problems in scene-based nonuniformity correction (NUC) algorithms. In this study, we introduce the idea of space frequency to the scene-based NUC. Then the convergence speed factor is presented, which can adaptively change the convergence speed by a change of the scene dynamic range. In fact, the convergence speed factor role is to decrease the statistical data standard deviation. The nonuniformity space relativity characteristic was summarized by plenty of experimental statistical data. The space relativity characteristic was used to correct the convergence speed factor, which can make it more stable. Finally, real and simulated infrared image sequences were applied to demonstrate the positive effect of our algorithm.\n\nGeometry correction Algorithm for UAV Remote Sensing Image Based on Improved Neural Network\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Ruian; Liu, Nan; Zeng, Beibei; Chen, Tingting; Yin, Ninghao\n\n2018-03-01\n\nAiming at the disadvantage of current geometry correction algorithm for UAV remote sensing image, a new algorithm is proposed. Adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) and RBF neural network are introduced into this algorithm. And combined with the geometry correction principle for UAV remote sensing image, the algorithm and solving steps of AGA-RBF are presented in order to realize geometry correction for UAV remote sensing. The correction accuracy and operational efficiency is improved through optimizing the structure and connection weight of RBF neural network separately with AGA and LMS algorithm. Finally, experiments show that AGA-RBF algorithm has the advantages of high correction accuracy, high running rate and strong generalization ability.\n\nExperimental testing of four correction algorithms for the forward scattering spectrometer probe\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHovenac, Edward A.; Oldenburg, John R.; Lock, James A.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThree number density correction algorithms and one size distribution correction algorithm for the Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP) were compared with data taken by the Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) and an optical number density measuring instrument (NDMI). Of the three number density correction algorithms, the one that compared best to the PDPA and NDMI data was the algorithm developed by Baumgardner, Strapp, and Dye (1985). The algorithm that corrects sizing errors in the FSSP that was developed by Lock and Hovenac (1989) was shown to be within 25 percent of the Phase Doppler measurements at number densities as high as 3000/cc.\n\nDesign of the OMPS limb sensor correction algorithm\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJaross, Glen; McPeters, Richard; Seftor, Colin; Kowitt, Mark\n\nThe Sensor Data Records (SDR) for the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) on NPOESS (National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System) contains geolocated and calibrated radiances, and are similar to the Level 1 data of NASA Earth Observing System and other programs. The SDR algorithms (one for each of the 3 OMPS focal planes) are the processes by which the Raw Data Records (RDR) from the OMPS sensors are converted into the records that contain all data necessary for ozone retrievals. Consequently, the algorithms must correct and calibrate Earth signals, geolocate the data, and identify and ingest collocated ancillary data. As with other limb sensors, ozone profile retrievals are relatively insensitive to calibration errors due to the use of altitude normalization and wavelength pairing. But the profile retrievals as they pertain to OMPS are not immune from sensor changes. In particular, the OMPS Limb sensor images an altitude range of > 100 km and a spectral range of 290-1000 nm on its detector. Uncorrected sensor degradation and spectral registration drifts can lead to changes in the measured radiance profile, which in turn affects the ozone trend measurement. Since OMPS is intended for long-term monitoring, sensor calibration is a specific concern. The calibration is maintained via the ground data processing. This means that all sensor calibration data, including direct solar measurements, are brought down in the raw data and processed separately by the SDR algorithms. One of the sensor corrections performed by the algorithm is the correction for stray light. The imaging spectrometer and the unique focal plane design of OMPS makes these corrections particularly challenging and important. Following an overview of the algorithm flow, we will briefly describe the sensor stray light characterization and the correction approach used in the code.\n\nA novel algorithm for simplification of complex gene classifiers in cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWilson, Raphael A.; Teng, Ling; Bachmeyer, Karen M.; Bissonnette, Mei Lin Z.; Husain, Aliya N.; Parham, David M.; Triche, Timothy J.; Wing, Michele R.; Gastier-Foster, Julie M.; Barr, Frederic G.; Hawkins, Douglas S.; Anderson, James R.; Skapek, Stephen X.; Volchenboum, Samuel L.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe clinical application of complex molecular classifiers as diagnostic or prognostic tools has been limited by the time and cost needed to apply them to patients. Using an existing fifty-gene expression signature known to separate two molecular subtypes of the pediatric cancer rhabdomyosarcoma, we show that an exhaustive iterative search algorithm can distill this complex classifier down to two or three features with equal discrimination. We validated the two-gene signatures using three separate and distinct data sets, including one that uses degraded RNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material. Finally, to demonstrate the generalizability of our algorithm, we applied it to a lung cancer data set to find minimal gene signatures that can distinguish survival. Our approach can easily be generalized and coupled to existing technical platforms to facilitate the discovery of simplified signatures that are ready for routine clinical use.

The atmospheric effect, the basic equations, a description of the computational procedure, and a sensitivity study are discussed. The program is designed to take the measured radiances, view and illumination directions, and the aerosol and gaseous absorption optical thickness to compute the radiance just above the surface, the irradiance on the surface, and surface reflectance. Alternatively, the program will compute the upward radiance at a specific altitude for a given surface reflectance, view and illumination directions, and aerosol and gaseous absorption optical thickness. The algorithm can be applied for any view and illumination directions and any wavelength in the range 0.48 micron to 2.2 micron. The relation between the measured radiance and surface reflectance, which is expressed as a function of atmospheric properties and measurement geometry, is computed using a radiative transfer routine. The results of the computations are presented in a table which forms the basis of the correction algorithm. The algorithm can be used for atmospheric corrections in the presence of a rural aerosol. The sensitivity of the derived surface reflectance to uncertainties in the model and input data is discussed.\n\nAlgorithm for atmospheric corrections of aircraft and satellite imagery\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFraser, R.

A new classifier (a set of features together with a classification method) based on artificial neural networks trained using artificial fish swarm optimization (AFSO) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The basic idea behind the proposed classifier is to use AFSO algorithm for searching the best combination of synaptic weights for the neural network. An optimal set of features based on the statistical textural features is presented. The investigational outcomes of the proposed suspicious lesion classifier algorithm therefore confirm that the resulting classifier performs better than other such classifiers reported in the literature. Therefore this classifier demonstrates that the improvement in both the sensitivity and specificity are possible through automated image analysis.\n\nQualitative and quantitative evaluation of six algorithms for correcting intensity nonuniformity effects.\n\nPubMed\n\nArnold, J B; Liow, J S; Schaper, K A; Stern, J J; Sled, J G; Shattuck, D W; Worth, A J; Cohen, M S; Leahy, R M; Mazziotta, J C; Rottenberg, D A\n\n2001-05-01\n\nThe desire to correct intensity nonuniformity in magnetic resonance images has led to the proliferation of nonuniformity-correction (NUC) algorithms with different theoretical underpinnings. In order to provide end users with a rational basis for selecting a given algorithm for a specific neuroscientific application, we evaluated the performance of six NUC algorithms. We used simulated and real MRI data volumes, including six repeat scans of the same subject, in order to rank the accuracy, precision, and stability of the nonuniformity corrections. We also compared algorithms using data volumes from different subjects and different (1.5T and 3.0T) MRI scanners in order to relate differences in algorithmic performance to intersubject variability and/or differences in scanner performance. In phantom studies, the correlation of the extracted with the applied nonuniformity was highest in the transaxial (left-to-right) direction and lowest in the axial (top-to-bottom) direction. Two of the six algorithms demonstrated a high degree of stability, as measured by the iterative application of the algorithm to its corrected output. While none of the algorithms performed ideally under all circumstances, locally adaptive methods generally outperformed nonadaptive methods.

An automatic annotation scheme must be in an urgent need to reduce the gap between the amount of new sequences produced and reliable functional annotation. This work proposes rules for automatically classifying the fungus genes. The approach involves elucidating the enzyme classifying rule that is hidden in UniProt protein knowledgebase and then applying it for classification. The association algorithm, Apriori, is utilized to mine the relationship between the enzyme class and significant InterPro entries. The candidate rules are evaluated for their classificatory capacity. There were five datasets collected from the Swiss-Prot for establishing the annotation rules. These were treated as the training sets. The TrEMBL entries were treated as the testing set. A correct enzyme classification rate of 70% was obtained for the prokaryote datasets and a similar rate of about 80% was obtained for the eukaryote datasets. The fungus training dataset which lacks an enzyme class description was also used to evaluate the fungus candidate rules. A total of 88 out of 5085 test entries were matched with the fungus rule set. These were otherwise poorly annotated using their functional descriptions. The feasibility of using the method presented here to classify enzyme classes based on the enzyme domain rules is evident. The rules may be also employed by the protein annotators in manual annotation or implemented in an automatic annotation flowchart.\n\nAn environment-adaptive management algorithm for hearing-support devices incorporating listening situation and noise type classifiers.\n\nPubMed\n\nYook, Sunhyun; Nam, Kyoung Won; Kim, Heepyung; Hong, Sung Hwa; Jang, Dong Pyo; Kim, In Young\n\n2015-04-01\n\nIn order to provide more consistent sound intelligibility for the hearing-impaired person, regardless of environment, it is necessary to adjust the setting of the hearing-support (HS) device to accommodate various environmental circumstances. In this study, a fully automatic HS device management algorithm that can adapt to various environmental situations is proposed; it is composed of a listening-situation classifier, a noise-type classifier, an adaptive noise-reduction algorithm, and a management algorithm that can selectively turn on/off one or more of the three basic algorithms-beamforming, noise-reduction, and feedback cancellation-and can also adjust internal gains and parameters of the wide-dynamic-range compression (WDRC) and noise-reduction (NR) algorithms in accordance with variations in environmental situations. Experimental results demonstrated that the implemented algorithms can classify both listening situation and ambient noise type situations with high accuracies (92.8-96.4% and 90.9-99.4%, respectively), and the gains and parameters of the WDRC and NR algorithms were successfully adjusted according to variations in environmental situation. The average values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), frequency-weighted segmental SNR, Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality, and mean opinion test scores of 10 normal-hearing volunteers of the adaptive multiband spectral subtraction (MBSS) algorithm were improved by 1.74 dB, 2.11 dB, 0.49, and 0.68, respectively, compared to the conventional fixed-parameter MBSS algorithm. These results indicate that the proposed environment-adaptive management algorithm can be applied to HS devices to improve sound intelligibility for hearing-impaired individuals in various acoustic environments.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of machine learning algorithms trained to classify open-text reports of doctor performance and to assess the potential for classifications to identify significant differences in doctors' professional performance in the United Kingdom. We used 1636 open-text comments (34,283 words) relating to the performance of 548 doctors collected from a survey of clinicians' colleagues using the General Medical Council Colleague Questionnaire (GMC-CQ). We coded 77.75% (1272/1636) of the comments into 5 global themes (innovation, interpersonal skills, popularity, professionalism, and respect) using a qualitative framework. We trained 8 machine learning algorithms to classify comments and assessed their performance using several training samples. We evaluated doctor performance using the GMC-CQ and compared scores between doctors with different classifications using t tests. Individual algorithm performance was high (range F score=.68 to .83). Interrater agreement between the algorithms and the human coder was highest for codes relating to \"popular\" (recall=.97), \"innovator\" (recall=.98), and \"respected\" (recall=.87) codes and was lower for the \"interpersonal\" (recall=.80) and \"professional\" (recall=.82) codes. A 10-fold cross-validation demonstrated similar performance in each analysis. When combined together into an ensemble of multiple algorithms, mean human-computer interrater agreement was .88. Comments that were classified as \"respected,\" \"professional,\" and \"interpersonal\" related to higher doctor scores on the GMC-CQ compared with comments that were not classified (P<.05). Scores did not vary between doctors who were rated as popular or innovative and those who were not rated at all (P>.05).

J. Pollina\n\n1999-09-01\n\nIn December 1997, the US Department of Energy (DOE) established a Center of Excellence (Hyperspectral-Multispectral Algorithm Research Center, HyMARC) for promoting the research and development of algorithms to exploit spectral imagery. This center is located at the DOE Remote Sensing Laboratory in Las Vegas, Nevada, and is operated for the DOE by Bechtel Nevada. This paper presents the results to date of a research project begun at the center during 1998 to investigate the correction of hyperspectral data for atmospheric aerosols. Results of a project conducted by the Rochester Institute of Technology to define, implement, and test procedures for absolutemoreÂ Â» calibration and correction of hyperspectral data to absolute units of high spectral resolution imagery will be presented. Hybrid techniques for atmospheric correction using image or spectral scene data coupled through radiative propagation models will be specifically addressed. Results of this effort to analyze HYDICE sensor data will be included. Preliminary results based on studying the performance of standard routines, such as Atmospheric Pre-corrected Differential Absorption and Nonlinear Least Squares Spectral Fit, in retrieving reflectance spectra show overall reflectance retrieval errors of approximately one to two reflectance units in the 0.4- to 2.5-micron-wavelength region (outside of the absorption features). These results are based on HYDICE sensor data collected from the Southern Great Plains Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site during overflights conducted in July of 1997. Results of an upgrade made in the model-based atmospheric correction techniques, which take advantage of updates made to the moderate resolution atmospheric transmittance model (MODTRAN 4.0) software, will also be presented. Data will be shown to demonstrate how the reflectance retrieval in the shorter wavelengths of the blue-green region will be improved because of enhanced modeling of multiple scattering effects.Â«Â less\n\nTemporal high-pass non-uniformity correction algorithm based on grayscale mapping and hardware implementation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJin, Minglei; Jin, Weiqi; Li, Yiyang; Li, Shuo\n\n2015-08-01\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel scene-based non-uniformity correction algorithm for infrared image processing-temporal high-pass non-uniformity correction algorithm based on grayscale mapping (THP and GM). The main sources of non-uniformity are: (1) detector fabrication inaccuracies; (2) non-linearity and variations in the read-out electronics and (3) optical path effects. The non-uniformity will be reduced by non-uniformity correction (NUC) algorithms. The NUC algorithms are often divided into calibration-based non-uniformity correction (CBNUC) algorithms and scene-based non-uniformity correction (SBNUC) algorithms. As non-uniformity drifts temporally, CBNUC algorithms must be repeated by inserting a uniform radiation source which SBNUC algorithms do not need into the view, so the SBNUC algorithm becomes an essential part of infrared imaging system. The SBNUC algorithms' poor robustness often leads two defects: artifacts and over-correction, meanwhile due to complicated calculation process and large storage consumption, hardware implementation of the SBNUC algorithms is difficult, especially in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. The THP and GM algorithm proposed in this paper can eliminate the non-uniformity without causing defects. The hardware implementation of the algorithm only based on FPGA has two advantages: (1) low resources consumption, and (2) small hardware delay: less than 20 lines, it can be transplanted to a variety of infrared detectors equipped with FPGA image processing module, it can reduce the stripe non-uniformity and the ripple non-uniformity.\n\nThe atmospheric correction algorithm for HY-1B/COCTS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHe, Xianqiang; Bai, Yan; Pan, Delu; Zhu, Qiankun\n\n2008-10-01\n\nChina has launched her second ocean color satellite HY-1B on 11 Apr., 2007, which carried two remote sensors. The Chinese Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (COCTS) is the main sensor on HY-1B, and it has not only eight visible and near-infrared wavelength bands similar to the SeaWiFS, but also two more thermal infrared bands to measure the sea surface temperature. Therefore, COCTS has broad application potentiality, such as fishery resource protection and development, coastal monitoring and management and marine pollution monitoring. Atmospheric correction is the key of the quantitative ocean color remote sensing. In this paper, the operational atmospheric correction algorithm of HY-1B/COCTS has been developed. Firstly, based on the vector radiative transfer numerical model of coupled oceanatmosphere system- PCOART, the exact Rayleigh scattering look-up table (LUT), aerosol scattering LUT and atmosphere diffuse transmission LUT for HY-1B/COCTS have been generated. Secondly, using the generated LUTs, the exactly operational atmospheric correction algorithm for HY-1B/COCTS has been developed. The algorithm has been validated using the simulated spectral data generated by PCOART, and the result shows the error of the water-leaving reflectance retrieved by this algorithm is less than 0.0005, which meets the requirement of the exactly atmospheric correction of ocean color remote sensing. Finally, the algorithm has been applied to the HY-1B/COCTS remote sensing data, and the retrieved water-leaving radiances are consist with the Aqua/MODIS results, and the corresponding ocean color remote sensing products have been generated including the chlorophyll concentration and total suspended particle matter concentration.\n\nGeneralized algebraic scene-based nonuniformity correction algorithm.\n\nPubMed\n\nRatliff, Bradley M; Hayat, Majeed M; Tyo, J Scott\n\n2005-02-01\n\nA generalization of a recently developed algebraic scene-based nonuniformity correction algorithm for focal plane array (FPA) sensors is presented. The new technique uses pairs of image frames exhibiting arbitrary one- or two-dimensional translational motion to compute compensator quantities that are then used to remove nonuniformity in the bias of the FPA response. Unlike its predecessor, the generalization does not require the use of either a blackbody calibration target or a shutter. The algorithm has a low computational overhead, lending itself to real-time hardware implementation. The high-quality correction ability of this technique is demonstrated through application to real IR data from both cooled and uncooled infrared FPAs. A theoretical and experimental error analysis is performed to study the accuracy of the bias compensator estimates in the presence of two main sources of error.\n\nAn algorithm for generating modular hierarchical neural network classifiers: a step toward larger scale applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoverso, Davide\n\n2003-08-01\n\nMany-class learning is the problem of training a classifier to discriminate among a large number of target classes. Together with the problem of dealing with high-dimensional patterns (i.e. a high-dimensional input space), the many class problem (i.e. a high-dimensional output space) is a major obstacle to be faced when scaling-up classifier systems and algorithms from small pilot applications to large full-scale applications. The Autonomous Recursive Task Decomposition (ARTD) algorithm is here proposed as a solution to the problem of many-class learning. Example applications of ARTD to neural classifier training are also presented. In these examples, improvements in training time are shown to range from 4-fold to more than 30-fold in pattern classification tasks of both static and dynamic character.\n\nClassifying spatially heterogeneous wetland communities using machine learning algorithms and spectral and textural features.\n\nPubMed\n\nSzantoi, Zoltan; Escobedo, Francisco J; Abd-Elrahman, Amr; Pearlstine, Leonard; Dewitt, Bon; Smith, Scot\n\n2015-05-01\n\nMapping of wetlands (marsh vs. swamp vs. upland) is a common remote sensing application.Yet, discriminating between similar freshwater communities such as graminoid/sedge fromremotely sensed imagery is more difficult. Most of this activity has been performed using medium to low resolution imagery. There are only a few studies using highspatial resolutionimagery and machine learning image classification algorithms for mapping heterogeneouswetland plantcommunities. This study addresses this void by analyzing whether machine learning classifierssuch as decisiontrees (DT) and artificial neural networks (ANN) can accurately classify graminoid/sedgecommunities usinghigh resolution aerial imagery and image texture data in the Everglades National Park, Florida.In addition tospectral bands, the normalized difference vegetation index, and first- and second-order texturefeatures derivedfrom the near-infrared band were analyzed. Classifier accuracies were assessed using confusiontablesand the calculated kappa coefficients of the resulting maps. The results indicated that an ANN(multilayerperceptron based on backpropagation) algorithm produced a statistically significantly higheraccuracy(82.04%) than the DT (QUEST) algorithm (80.48%) or the maximum likelihood (80.56%)classifier (Î±<0.05). Findings show that using multiple window sizes provided the best results. First-ordertexture featuresalso provided computational advantages and results that were not significantly different fromthose usingsecond-order texture features.\n\nAn efficient algorithm for automatic phase correction of NMR spectra based on entropy minimization\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Li; Weng, Zhiqiang; Goh, LaiYoong; Garland, Marc\n\n2002-09-01\n\nA new algorithm for automatic phase correction of NMR spectra based on entropy minimization is proposed. The optimal zero-order and first-order phase corrections for a NMR spectrum are determined by minimizing entropy. The objective function is constructed using a Shannon-type information entropy measure. Entropy is defined as the normalized derivative of the NMR spectral data. The algorithm has been successfully applied to experimental 1H NMR spectra. The results of automatic phase correction are found to be comparable to, or perhaps better than, manual phase correction. The advantages of this automatic phase correction algorithm include its simple mathematical basis and the straightforward, reproducible, and efficient optimization procedure. The algorithm is implemented in the Matlab program ACMEâAutomated phase Correction based on Minimization of Entropy.\n\nSVM based colon polyps classifier in a wireless active stereo endoscope.\n\nPubMed\n\nAyoub, J; Granado, B; Mhanna, Y; Romain, O\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis work focuses on the recognition of three-dimensional colon polyps captured by an active stereo vision sensor. The detection algorithm consists of SVM classifier trained on robust feature descriptors. The study is related to Cyclope, this prototype sensor allows real time 3D object reconstruction and continues to be optimized technically to improve its classification task by differentiation between hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps. Experimental results were encouraging and show correct classification rate of approximately 97%. The work contains detailed statistics about the detection rate and the computing complexity. Inspired by intensity histogram, the work shows a new approach that extracts a set of features based on depth histogram and combines stereo measurement with SVM classifiers to correctly classify benign and malignant polyps.\n\nA review and experimental study on the application of classifiers and evolutionary algorithms in EEG-based brain-machine interface systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTahernezhad-Javazm, Farajollah; Azimirad, Vahid; Shoaran, Maryam\n\n2018-04-01\n\nObjective. Considering the importance and the near-future development of noninvasive brain-machine interface (BMI) systems, this paper presents a comprehensive theoretical-experimental survey on the classification and evolutionary methods for BMI-based systems in which EEG signals are used. Approach. The paper is divided into two main parts. In the first part, a wide range of different types of the base and combinatorial classifiers including boosting and bagging classifiers and evolutionary algorithms are reviewed and investigated. In the second part, these classifiers and evolutionary algorithms are assessed and compared based on two types of relatively widely used BMI systems, sensory motor rhythm-BMI and event-related potentials-BMI. Moreover, in the second part, some of the improved evolutionary algorithms as well as bi-objective algorithms are experimentally assessed and compared. Main results. In this study two databases are used, and cross-validation accuracy (CVA) and stability to data volume (SDV) are considered as the evaluation criteria for the classifiers. According to the experimental results on both databases, regarding the base classifiers, linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines with respect to CVA evaluation metric, and naive Bayes with respect to SDV demonstrated the best performances. Among the combinatorial classifiers, four classifiers, Bagg-DT (bagging decision tree), LogitBoost, and GentleBoost with respect to CVA, and Bagging-LR (bagging logistic regression) and AdaBoost (adaptive boosting) with respect to SDV had the best performances. Finally, regarding the evolutionary algorithms, single-objective invasive weed optimization (IWO) and bi-objective nondominated sorting IWO algorithms demonstrated the best performances. Significance. We present a general survey on the base and the combinatorial classification methods for EEG signals (sensory motor rhythm and event-related potentials) as well as their optimization methods\n\nAssociation algorithm to mine the rules that govern enzyme definition and to classify protein sequences\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChiu, Shih-Hau; Chen, Chien-Chi; Yuan, Gwo-Fang; Lin, Thy-Hou\n\n2006-01-01\n\nBackground The number of sequences compiled in many genome projects is growing exponentially, but most of them have not been characterized experimentally. An automatic annotation scheme must be in an urgent need to reduce the gap between the amount of new sequences produced and reliable functional annotation. This work proposes rules for automatically classifying the fungus genes. The approach involves elucidating the enzyme classifying rule that is hidden in UniProt protein knowledgebase and then applying it for classification. The association algorithm, Apriori, is utilized to mine the relationship between the enzyme class and significant InterPro entries. The candidate rules are evaluated for their classificatory capacity. Results There were five datasets collected from the Swiss-Prot for establishing the annotation rules. These were treated as the training sets. The TrEMBL entries were treated as the testing set. A correct enzyme classification rate of 70% was obtained for the prokaryote datasets and a similar rate of about 80% was obtained for the eukaryote datasets. The fungus training dataset which lacks an enzyme class description was also used to evaluate the fungus candidate rules. A total of 88 out of 5085 test entries were matched with the fungus rule set. These were otherwise poorly annotated using their functional descriptions. Conclusion The feasibility of using the method presented here to classify enzyme classes based on the enzyme domain rules is evident. The rules may be also employed by the protein annotators in manual annotation or implemented in an automatic annotation flowchart.

The see-saw diagram describes the image correction in rotationally symmetric systems over a finite field of view by means of aspherics surfaces. The algorithm is applied to the design of some basic telescopic configurations such as the classical Cassegrain telescope, the Dall-Kirkham telescope, the Pressman-Camichel telescope and the Ritchey-Chretien telescope in order to show a physically visualizable concept of image correction for optical systems that employ aspheric surfaces. By using the see-saw method the student can visualize the different possible configurations of such telescopes as well as their performances and also the student will be able to understand that it is not always possible to correct more primary aberrations by aspherizing more surfaces.\n\nPrediction-Correction Algorithms for Time-Varying Constrained Optimization\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nSimonetto, Andrea; Dall'Anese, Emiliano\n\n2017-07-26\n\nThis article develops online algorithms to track solutions of time-varying constrained optimization problems. Particularly, resembling workhorse Kalman filtering-based approaches for dynamical systems, the proposed methods involve prediction-correction steps to provably track the trajectory of the optimal solutions of time-varying convex problems. The merits of existing prediction-correction methods have been shown for unconstrained problems and for setups where computing the inverse of the Hessian of the cost function is computationally affordable. This paper addresses the limitations of existing methods by tackling constrained problems and by designing first-order prediction steps that rely on the Hessian of the cost function (and do notmoreÂ Â» require the computation of its inverse). In addition, the proposed methods are shown to improve the convergence speed of existing prediction-correction methods when applied to unconstrained problems. Numerical simulations corroborate the analytical results and showcase performance and benefits of the proposed algorithms. A realistic application of the proposed method to real-time control of energy resources is presented.Â«Â less\n\nNonuniformity correction algorithm with efficient pixel offset estimation for infrared focal plane arrays.\n\nPubMed\n\nOrÅ¼anowski, Tomasz\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis paper presents an infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) response nonuniformity correction (NUC) algorithm which is easy to implement by hardware. The proposed NUC algorithm is based on the linear correction scheme with the useful method of pixel offset correction coefficients update. The new approach to IRFPA response nonuniformity correction consists in the use of pixel response change determined at the actual operating conditions in relation to the reference ones by means of shutter to compensate a pixel offset temporal drift. Moreover, it permits to remove any optics shading effect in the output image as well. To show efficiency of the proposed NUC algorithm some test results for microbolometer IRFPA are presented.\n\nValidation of the Thematic Mapper radiometric and geometric correction algorithms\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFischel, D.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThe radiometric and geometric correction algorithms for Thematic Mapper are critical to subsequent successful information extraction. Earlier Landsat scanners, known as Multispectral Scanners, produce imagery which exhibits striping due to mismatching of detector gains and biases. Thematic Mapper exhibits the same phenomenon at three levels: detector-to-detector, scan-to-scan, and multiscan striping. The cause of these variations has been traced to variations in the dark current of the detectors. An alternative formulation has been tested and shown to be very satisfactory. Unfortunately, the Thematic Mapper detectors exhibit saturation effects suffered while viewing extensive cloud areas, and is not easily correctable. The geometric correction algorithm has been shown to be remarkably reliable. Only minor and modest improvements are indicated and shown to be effective.\n\nAn improved non-uniformity correction algorithm and its GPU parallel implementation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCheng, Kuanhong; Zhou, Huixin; Qin, Hanlin; Zhao, Dong; Qian, Kun; Rong, Shenghui\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe performance of SLP-THP based non-uniformity correction algorithm is seriously affected by the result of SLP filter, which always leads to image blurring and ghosting artifacts. To address this problem, an improved SLP-THP based non-uniformity correction method with curvature constraint was proposed. Here we put forward a new way to estimate spatial low frequency component. First, the details and contours of input image were obtained respectively by minimizing local Gaussian curvature and mean curvature of image surface. Then, the guided filter was utilized to combine these two parts together to get the estimate of spatial low frequency component. Finally, we brought this SLP component into SLP-THP method to achieve non-uniformity correction. The performance of proposed algorithm was verified by several real and simulated infrared image sequences. The experimental results indicated that the proposed algorithm can reduce the non-uniformity without detail losing. After that, a GPU based parallel implementation that runs 150 times faster than CPU was presented, which showed the proposed algorithm has great potential for real time application.\n\nAtmospheric Correction Prototype Algorithm for High Spatial Resolution Multispectral Earth Observing Imaging Systems\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPagnutti, Mary\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis viewgraph presentation reviews the creation of a prototype algorithm for atmospheric correction using high spatial resolution earth observing imaging systems. The objective of the work was to evaluate accuracy of a prototype algorithm that uses satellite-derived atmospheric products to generate scene reflectance maps for high spatial resolution (HSR) systems. This presentation focused on preliminary results of only the satellite-based atmospheric correction algorithm.\n\nClassifying Volcanic Activity Using an Empirical Decision Making Algorithm\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJunek, W. N.; Jones, W. L.; Woods, M. T.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nDetection and classification of developing volcanic activity is vital to eruption forecasting. Timely information regarding an impending eruption would aid civil authorities in determining the proper response to a developing crisis. In this presentation, volcanic activity is characterized using an event tree classifier and a suite of empirical statistical models derived through logistic regression. Forecasts are reported in terms of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) volcano alert level system. The algorithm employs multidisciplinary data (e.g., seismic, GPS, InSAR) acquired by various volcano monitoring systems and source modeling information to forecast the likelihood that an eruption, with a volcanic explosivity index (VEI) > 1, will occur within a quantitatively constrained area. Logistic models are constructed from a sparse and geographically diverse dataset assembled from a collection of historic volcanic unrest episodes. Bootstrapping techniques are applied to the training data to allow for the estimation of robust logistic model coefficients. Cross validation produced a series of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with areas ranging between 0.78-0.81, which indicates the algorithm has good predictive capabilities. The ROC curves also allowed for the determination of a false positive rate and optimum detection for each stage of the algorithm. Forecasts for historic volcanic unrest episodes in North America and Iceland were computed and are consistent with the actual outcome of the events.\n\nA new unequal-weighted triple-frequency first order ionosphere correction algorithm and its application in COMPASS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, WenXiang; Mou, WeiHua; Wang, FeiXue\n\n2012-03-01\n\nAs the introduction of triple-frequency signals in GNSS, the multi-frequency ionosphere correction technology has been fast developing. References indicate that the triple-frequency second order ionosphere correction is worse than the dual-frequency first order ionosphere correction because of the larger noise amplification factor. On the assumption that the variances of three frequency pseudoranges were equal, other references presented the triple-frequency first order ionosphere correction, which proved worse or better than the dual-frequency first order correction in different situations. In practice, the PN code rate, carrier-to-noise ratio, parameters of DLL and multipath effect of each frequency are not the same, so three frequency pseudorange variances are unequal. Under this consideration, a new unequal-weighted triple-frequency first order ionosphere correction algorithm, which minimizes the variance of the pseudorange ionosphere-free combination, is proposed in this paper. It is found that conventional dual-frequency first-order correction algorithms and the equal-weighted triple-frequency first order correction algorithm are special cases of the new algorithm. A new pseudorange variance estimation method based on the three carrier combination is also introduced. Theoretical analysis shows that the new algorithm is optimal. The experiment with COMPASS G3 satellite observations demonstrates that the ionosphere-free pseudorange combination variance of the new algorithm is smaller than traditional multi-frequency correction algorithms.\n\nImproved target detection algorithm using Fukunaga-Koontz transform and distance classifier correlation filter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBal, A.; Alam, M. S.; Aslan, M. S.\n\n2006-05-01\n\nOften sensor ego-motion or fast target movement causes the target to temporarily go out of the field-of-view leading to reappearing target detection problem in target tracking applications. Since the target goes out of the current frame and reenters at a later frame, the reentering location and variations in rotation, scale, and other 3D orientations of the target are not known thus complicating the detection algorithm has been developed using Fukunaga-Koontz Transform (FKT) and distance classifier correlation filter (DCCF). The detection algorithm uses target and background information, extracted from training samples, to detect possible candidate target images. The detected candidate target images are then introduced into the second algorithm, DCCF, called clutter rejection module, to determine the target coordinates are detected and tracking algorithm is initiated. The performance of the proposed FKT-DCCF based target detection algorithm has been tested using real-world forward looking infrared (FLIR) video sequences.\n\nDiagnostic Performance of a Novel Coronary CT Angiography Algorithm: Prospective Multicenter Validation of an Intracycle CT Motion Correction Algorithm for Diagnostic Accuracy.\n\nPubMed\n\nAndreini, Daniele; Lin, Fay Y; Rizvi, Asim; Cho, Iksung; Heo, Ran; Pontone, Gianluca; Bartorelli, Antonio L; Mushtaq, Saima; Villines, Todd C; Carrascosa, Patricia; Choi, Byoung Wook; Bloom, Stephen; Wei, Han; Xing, Yan; Gebow, Dan; Gransar, Heidi; Chang, Hyuk-Jae; Leipsic, Jonathon; Min, James K\n\n2018-06-01\n\nMotion artifact can reduce the diagnostic accuracy of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) for coronary artery disease (CAD). The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of an algorithm dedicated to correcting coronary motion artifact with the performance of standard reconstruction methods in a prospective international multicenter study. Patients referred for clinically indicated invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for suspected CAD prospectively underwent an investigational CCTA examination free from heart rate-lowering medications before they underwent ICA. Blinded core laboratory interpretations of motion-corrected and standard reconstructions for obstructive CAD (â¥ 50% stenosis) were compared with ICA findings. Segments unevaluable owing to artifact were considered obstructive. The primary endpoint was per-subject diagnostic accuracy of the intracycle motion correction algorithm for obstructive CAD found at ICA. Among 230 patients who underwent CCTA with the motion correction algorithm and standard reconstruction, 92 (40.0%) had obstructive CAD on the basis of ICA findings. At a mean heart rate of 68.0 Â± 11.7 beats/min, the motion correction algorithm reduced the number of nondiagnostic scans compared with standard reconstruction (20.4% vs 34.8%; p < 0.001). Diagnostic accuracy for obstructive CAD with the motion correction algorithm (62%; 95% CI, 56-68%) was not significantly different from that of standard reconstruction on a per-subject basis (59%; 95% CI, 53-66%; p = 0.28) but was superior on a per-vessel basis: 77% (95% CI, 74-80%) versus 72% (95% CI, 69-75%) (p = 0.02). The motion correction algorithm was superior in subgroups of patients with severely obstructive (â¥ 70%) stenosis, heart rate â¥ 70 beats/min, and vessels in the atrioventricular groove. The motion correction algorithm studied reduces artifacts and improves diagnostic performance for obstructive CAD on a per-vessel basis and in selected subgroups on a per\n\nPrediction of protein long-range contacts using an ensemble of genetic algorithm classifiers with sequence profile centers.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Peng; Li, Jinyan\n\n2010-05-17\n\nPrediction of long-range inter-residue contacts is an important topic in bioinformatics research. It is helpful for determining protein structures, understanding protein foldings, and therefore advancing the annotation of protein functions. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of genetic algorithm classifiers (GaCs) to address the long-range contact prediction problem. Our method is based on the key idea called sequence profile centers (SPCs). Each SPC is the average sequence profiles of residue pairs belonging to the same contact class or non-contact class. GaCs train on multiple but different pairs of long-range contact data (positive data) and long-range non-contact data (negative data). The negative data sets, having roughly the same sizes as the positive ones, are constructed by random sampling over the original imbalanced negative data. As a result, about 21.5% long-range contacts are correctly predicted. We also found that the ensemble of GaCs indeed makes an accuracy improvement by around 5.6% over the single GaC. Classifiers with the use of sequence profile centers may advance the long-range contact prediction. In line with this approach, key structural features in proteins would be determined with high efficiency and accuracy.\n\nVoidage correction algorithm for unresolved Euler-Lagrange simulations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAskarishahi, Maryam; Salehi, Mohammad-Sadegh; Radl, Stefan\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe effect of grid coarsening on the predicted total drag force and heat exchange rate in dense gas-particle flows is investigated using Euler-Lagrange (EL) approach. We demonstrate that grid coarsening may reduce the predicted total drag force and exchange rate. Surprisingly, exchange coefficients predicted by the EL approach deviate more significantly from the exact value compared to results of Euler-Euler (EE)-based calculations. The voidage gradient is identified as the root cause of this peculiar behavior. Consequently, we propose a correction algorithm based on a sigmoidal function to predict the voidage experienced by individual particles. Our correction algorithm can significantly improve the prediction of exchange coefficients in EL models, which is tested for simulations involving Euler grid cell sizes between 2d_p and 12d_p . It is most relevant in simulations of dense polydisperse particle suspensions featuring steep voidage profiles. For these suspensions, classical approaches may result in an error of the total exchange rate of up to 30%.\n\nAn algebraic algorithm for nonuniformity correction in focal-plane arrays.\n\nPubMed\n\nRatliff, Bradley M; Hayat, Majeed M; Hardie, Russell C\n\n2002-09-01\n\nA scene-based algorithm is developed to compensate for bias nonuniformity in focal-plane arrays. Nonuniformity can be extremely problematic, especially for mid- to far-infrared imaging systems. The technique is based on use of estimates of interframe subpixel shifts in an image sequence, in conjunction with a linear-interpolation model for the motion, to extract information on the bias nonuniformity algebraically. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed by using real infrared and simulated data. One advantage of this technique is its simplicity; it requires relatively few frames to generate an effective correction matrix, thereby permitting the execution of frequent on-the-fly nonuniformity correction as drift occurs. Additionally, the performance is shown to exhibit considerable robustness with respect to lack of the common types of temporal and spatial irradiance diversity that are typically required by statistical scene-based nonuniformity correction techniques.\n\nApproximate string matching algorithms for limited-vocabulary OCR output correction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLasko, Thomas A.; Hauser, Susan E.\n\n2000-12-01\n\nFive methods for matching words mistranslated by optical character recognition to their most likely match in a reference dictionary were tested on data from the archives of the National Library of Medicine. The methods, including an adaptation of the cross correlation algorithm, the generic edit distance algorithm, the edit distance algorithm with a probabilistic substitution matrix, Bayesian analysis, and Bayesian analysis on an actively thinned reference dictionary were implemented and their accuracy rates compared. Of the five, the Bayesian algorithm produced the most correct matches (87%), and had the advantage of producing scores that have a useful and practical interpretation.\n\nUse of a machine learning algorithm to classify expertise: analysis of hand motion patterns during a simulated surgical task.\n\nPubMed\n\nWatson, Robert A\n\n2014-08-01\n\nTo test the hypothesis that machine learning algorithms increase the predictive power to classify surgical expertise using surgeons' hand motion patterns. In 2012 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 14 surgical attendings and 10 first- and second-year surgical residents each performed two bench model venous anastomoses. During the simulated tasks, the participants wore an inertial measurement unit on the dorsum of their dominant (right) hand to capture their hand motion patterns. The pattern from each bench model task performed was preprocessed into a symbolic time series and labeled as expert (attending) or novice (resident). The labeled hand motion patterns were processed and used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm. The trained algorithm was then tested for discriminative/predictive power against unlabeled (blinded) hand motion patterns from tasks not used in the training. The Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity metric was also measured from each hand motion pattern, with an optimal threshold calculated to separately classify the patterns. The LZ metric classified unlabeled (blinded) hand motion patterns into expert and novice groups with an accuracy of 70% (sensitivity 64%, specificity 80%). The SVM algorithm had an accuracy of 83% (sensitivity 86%, specificity 80%). The results confirmed the hypothesis. The SVM algorithm increased the predictive power to classify blinded surgical hand motion patterns into expert versus novice groups. With further development, the system used in this study could become a viable tool for low-cost, objective assessment of procedural proficiency in a competency-based curriculum.\n\nEvaluation of atmospheric correction algorithms for processing SeaWiFS data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRansibrahmanakul, Varis; Stumpf, Richard; Ramachandran, Sathyadev; Hughes, Kent\n\n2005-08-01\n\nTo enable the production of the best chlorophyll products from SeaWiFS data NOAA (Coastwatch and NOS) evaluated the various atmospheric correction algorithms by comparing the satellite derived water reflectance derived for each algorithm with in situ data. Gordon and Wang (1994) introduced a method to correct for Rayleigh and aerosol scattering in the atmosphere so that water reflectance may be derived from the radiance measured at the top of the atmosphere. However, since the correction assumed near infrared scattering to be negligible in coastal waters an invalid assumption, the method over estimates the atmospheric contribution and consequently under estimates water reflectance for the lower wavelength bands on extrapolation. Several improved methods to estimate near infrared correction exist: Siegel et al. (2000); Ruddick et al. (2000); Stumpf et al. (2002) and Stumpf et al. (2003), where an absorbing aerosol correction is also applied along with an additional 1.01% calibration adjustment for the 412 nm band. The evaluation show that the near infrared correction developed by Stumpf et al. (2003) result in an overall minimum error for U.S. waters. As of July 2004, NASA (SEADAS) has selected this as the default method for the atmospheric correction used to produce chlorophyll products.\n\nOptimal spiral phase modulation in Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for wavefront reconstruction and correction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarÃ¡nek, M.; BÄhal, J.; Bouchal, Z.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn the phase retrieval applications, the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm is widely used for the simplicity of implementation. This iterative process can advantageously be deployed in the combination with a spatial light modulator (SLM) enabling simultaneous correction of optical aberrations. As recently demonstrated, the accuracy and efficiency of the aberration correction using the GS algorithm can be significantly enhanced by a vortex image spot used as the target intensity pattern in the iterative process. Here we present an optimization of the spiral phase modulation incorporated into the GS algorithm.\n\nAn improved non-uniformity correction algorithm and its hardware implementation on FPGA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRong, Shenghui; Zhou, Huixin; Wen, Zhigang; Qin, Hanlin; Qian, Kun; Cheng, Kuanhong\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe Non-uniformity of Infrared Focal Plane Arrays (IRFPA) severely degrades the infrared image quality. An effective non-uniformity correction (NUC) algorithm is necessary for an IRFPA imaging and application system. However traditional scene-based NUC algorithm suffers the image blurring and artificial ghosting. In addition, few effective hardware platforms have been proposed to implement corresponding NUC algorithms. Thus, this paper proposed an improved neural-network based NUC algorithm by the guided image filter and the projection-based motion detection algorithm. First, the guided image filter is utilized to achieve the accurate desired image to decrease the artificial ghosting. Then a projection-based moving detection algorithm is utilized to determine whether the correction coefficients should be updated or not. In this way the problem of image blurring can be overcome. At last, an FPGA-based hardware design is introduced to realize the proposed NUC algorithm. A real and a simulated infrared image sequences are utilized to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results indicated that the proposed NUC algorithm can effectively eliminate the fix pattern noise with less image blurring and artificial ghosting. The proposed hardware design takes less logic elements in FPGA and spends less clock cycles to process one frame of image.\n\nA nonlinear lag correction algorithm for a-Si flat-panel x-ray detectors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nStarman, Jared; Star-Lack, Josh; Virshup, Gary; Shapiro, Edward; Fahrig, Rebecca\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPurpose: Detector lag, or residual signal, in a-Si flat-panel (FP) detectors can cause significant shading artifacts in cone-beam computed tomography reconstructions. To date, most correction models have assumed a linear, time-invariant (LTI) model and correct lag by deconvolution with an impulse response function (IRF). However, the lag correction is sensitive to both the exposure intensity and the technique used for determining the IRF. Even when the LTI correction that produces the minimum error is found, residual artifact remains. A new non-LTI method was developed to take into account the IRF measurement technique and exposure dependencies. Methods: First, a multiexponential (N = 4) LTI model was implemented for lag correction. Next, a non-LTI lag correction, known as the nonlinear consistent stored charge (NLCSC) method, was developed based on the LTI multiexponential method. It differs from other nonlinear lag correction algorithms in that it maintains a consistent estimate of the amount of charge stored in the FP and it does not require intimate knowledge of the semiconductor parameters specific to the FP. For the NLCSC method, all coefficients of the IRF are functions of exposure intensity. Another nonlinear lag correction method that only used an intensity weighting of the IRF was also compared. The correction algorithms were applied to step-response projection data and CT acquisitions of a large pelvic phantom and an acrylic head phantom. The authors collected rising and falling edge step-response data on a Varian 4030CB a-Si FP detector operating in dynamic gain mode at 15 fps at nine incident exposures (2.0%â92% of the detector saturation exposure). For projection data, 1st and 50th frame lag were measured before and after correction. For the CT reconstructions, five pairs of ROIs were defined and the maximum and mean signal differences within a pair were calculated for the different exposures and step-response edge techniques. Results: The LTI\n\nError minimizing algorithms for nearest eighbor classifiers\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPorter, Reid B; Hush, Don; Zimmer, G. Beate\n\n2011-01-03\n\nStack Filters define a large class of discrete nonlinear filter first introd uced in image and signal processing for noise removal. In recent years we have suggested their application to classification problems, and investigated their relationship to other types of discrete classifiers such as Decision Trees. In this paper we focus on a continuous domain version of Stack Filter Classifiers which we call Ordered Hypothesis Machines (OHM), and investigate their relationship to Nearest Neighbor classifiers. We show that OHM classifiers provide a novel framework in which to train Nearest Neighbor type classifiers by minimizing empirical error based loss functions. WemoreÂ Â» use the framework to investigate a new cost sensitive loss function that allows us to train a Nearest Neighbor type classifier for low false alarm rate applications. We report results on both synthetic data and real-world image data.Â«Â less\n\nHierarchical Learning of Tree Classifiers for Large-Scale Plant Species Identification.\n\nPubMed\n\nFan, Jianping; Zhou, Ning; Peng, Jinye; Gao, Ling\n\n2015-11-01\n\nIn this paper, a hierarchical multi-task structural learning algorithm is developed to support large-scale plant species identification, where a visual tree is constructed for organizing large numbers of plant species in a coarse-to-fine fashion and determining the inter-related learning tasks automatically. For a given parent node on the visual tree, it contains a set of sibling coarse-grained categories of plant species or sibling fine-grained plant species, and a multi-task structural learning algorithm is developed to train their inter-related classifiers jointly for enhancing their discrimination power. The inter-level relationship constraint, e.g., a plant image must first be assigned to a parent node (high-level non-leaf node) correctly if it can further be assigned to the most relevant child node (low-level non-leaf node or leaf node) on the visual tree, is formally defined and leveraged to learn more discriminative tree classifiers over the visual tree. Our experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our hierarchical multi-task structural learning algorithm on training more discriminative tree classifiers for large-scale plant species identification.\n\nAlgorithms for Image Analysis and Combination of Pattern Classifiers with Application to Medical Diagnosis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGeorgiou, Harris\n\n2009-10-01\n\nMedical Informatics and the application of modern signal processing in the assistance of the diagnostic process in medical imaging is one of the more recent and active research areas today. This thesis addresses a variety of issues related to the general problem of medical image analysis, specifically in mammography, and presents a series of algorithms and design approaches for all the intermediate levels of a modern system for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). The diagnostic problem is analyzed with a systematic approach, first defining the imaging characteristics and features that are relevant to probable pathology in mammo-grams. Next, these features are quantified and fused into new, integrated radio-logical systems that exhibit embedded digital signal processing, in order to improve the final result and minimize the radiological dose for the patient. In a higher level, special algorithms are designed for detecting and encoding these clinically interest-ing imaging features, in order to be used as input to advanced pattern classifiers and machine learning models. Finally, these approaches are extended in multi-classifier models under the scope of Game Theory and optimum collective deci-sion, in order to produce efficient solutions for combining classifiers with minimum computational costs for advanced diagnostic systems. The material covered in this thesis is related to a total of 18 published papers, 6 in scientific journals and 12 in international conferences.\n\nECHO: A reference-free short-read error correction algorithm\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKao, Wei-Chun; Chan, Andrew H.; Song, Yun S.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nDeveloping accurate, scalable algorithms to improve data quality is an important computational challenge associated with recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technology. In this study, a novel error-correction algorithm, called ECHO, is introduced for correcting base-call errors in short-reads, without the need of a reference genome. Unlike most previous methods, ECHO does not require the user to specify parameters of which optimal values are typically unknown a priori. ECHO automatically sets the parameters in the assumed model and estimates error characteristics specific to each sequencing run, while maintaining a running time that is within the range of practical use. ECHO is based on a probabilistic model and is able to assign a quality score to each corrected base. Furthermore, it explicitly models heterozygosity in diploid genomes and provides a reference-free method for detecting bases that originated from heterozygous sites. On both real and simulated data, ECHO is able to improve the accuracy of previous error-correction methods by several folds to an order of magnitude, depending on the sequence coverage depth and the position in the read. The improvement is most pronounced toward the end of the read, where previous methods become noticeably less effective. Using a whole-genome yeast data set, it is demonstrated here that ECHO is capable of coping with nonuniform coverage. Also, it is shown that using ECHO to perform error correction as a preprocessing step considerably facilitates de novo assembly, particularly in the case of low-to-moderate sequence coverage depth.

The non-uniform response in infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) detectors produces corrupted images with a fixed-pattern noise(FPN).We introduced and analyzed the artificial neural network scene-based non-uniformity correction (SBNUC) algorithm. A design of DSP-based NUC development platform for IRFPA is described. The DSP hardware platform designed is of low power consumption, with 32-bit fixed point DSP TMS320DM643 as the kernel processor. The dependability and expansibility of the software have been improved by DSP/BIOS real-time operating system and Reference Framework 5. In order to realize real-time performance, the calibration parameters update is set at a lower task priority then video input and output in DSP/BIOS. In this way, calibration parameters updating will not affect video streams. The work flow of the system and the strategy of real-time realization are introduced. Experiments on real infrared imaging sequences demonstrate that this algorithm requires only a few frames to obtain high quality corrections. It is computationally efficient and suitable for all kinds of non-uniformity.\n\nThe Orthogonally Partitioned EM Algorithm: Extending the EM Algorithm for Algorithmic Stability and Bias Correction Due to Imperfect Data.\n\nPubMed\n\nRegier, Michael D; Moodie, Erica E M\n\n2016-05-01\n\nWe propose an extension of the EM algorithm that exploits the common assumption of unique parameterization, corrects for biases due to missing data and measurement error, converges for the specified model when standard implementation of the EM algorithm has a low probability of convergence, and reduces a potentially complex algorithm into a sequence of smaller, simpler, self-contained EM algorithms. We use the theory surrounding the EM algorithm to derive the theoretical results of our proposal, showing that an optimal solution over the parameter space is obtained. A simulation study is used to explore the finite sample properties of the proposed extension when there is missing data and measurement error. We observe that partitioning the EM algorithm into simpler steps may provide better bias reduction in the estimation of model parameters. The ability to breakdown a complicated problem in to a series of simpler, more accessible problems will permit a broader implementation of the EM algorithm, permit the use of software packages that now implement and/or automate the EM algorithm, and make the EM algorithm more accessible to a wider and more general audience.\n\nDigital algorithm for dispersion correction in optical coherence tomography for homogeneous and stratified media.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarks, Daniel L; Oldenburg, Amy L; Reynolds, J Joshua; Boppart, Stephen A\n\n2003-01-10\n\nThe resolution of optical coherence tomography (OCT) often suffers from blurring caused by material dispersion.

Two different algorithms (Miloshevich et al., 2009, MILO hereafter; and Wang et al., 2013, WANG hereafter) have been designed to account for this solar radiative dry bias (SRDB). These corrections are markedly different with MILO adding up to 40 % more moisture to the original radiosonde profile than WANG; however, the impact of the two algorithms varies with height. The accuracy of these two algorithms is evaluated using three different approaches: a comparison of precipitable water vapor (PWV),moreÂ Â» downwelling radiative closure with a surface-based microwave radiometer at a high-altitude site (5.3 km m.s.l.), and upwelling radiative closure with the space-based Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). The PWV computed from the uncorrected and corrected RH data is compared against PWV retrieved from ground-based microwave radiometers at tropical, midlatitude, and arctic sites. Although MILO generally adds more moisture to the original radiosonde profile in the upper troposphere compared to WANG, both corrections yield similar changes to the PWV, and the corrected data agree well with the ground-based retrievals. The two closure activities â done for clear-sky scenes â use the radiative transfer models MonoRTM and LBLRTM to compute radiance from the radiosonde profiles to compare against spectral observations. Both WANG- and MILO-corrected RHs are statistically better than original RH in all cases except for the driest 30 % of cases in the downwelling experiment, where both algorithms add too much water vapor to the original profile. In the upwelling experiment, the RH correction applied by the WANG vs. MILO algorithm is statistically different above 10 km for the driest 30 % of cases and above 8 km for the moistest 30 % of cases, suggesting that the MILO correction performs better than the WANG in clear-sky scenes.

Twenty-five dynamic MR mammography (MRM) data sets and 25 contrast-enhanced three-dimensional peripheral MR angiographic (MRA) data sets which were affected by patient motion of varying severeness were selected retrospectively from routine examinations. Anonymized data were registered by a new experimental elastic motion correction algorithm. The algorithm works by computing a similarity measure for the two volumes that takes into account expected signal changes due to the presence of a contrast agent while penalizing other signal changes caused by patient motion. A conjugate gradient method is used to find the best possible set of motion parameters that maximizes the similarity measures across the entire volume. Images before and after correction were visually evaluated and scored by experienced radiologists with respect to reduction of motion, improvement of image quality, disappearance of existing lesions or creation of artifactual lesions. It was found that the correction improves image quality (76% for MRM and 96% for MRA) and diagnosability (60% for MRM and 96% for MRA).\n\nIs diabetes mellitus correctly registered and classified in primary care? A population-based study in Catalonia, Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nMata-Cases, Manel; Mauricio, DÃ­dac; Real, Jordi; BolÃ­bar, Bonaventura; Franch-Nadal, Josep\n\n2016-11-01\n\nTo assess the prevalence of miscoding, misclassification, misdiagnosis and under-registration of diabetes mellitus (DM) in primary health care in Catalonia (Spain), and to explore use of automated algorithms to identify them. In this cross-sectional, retrospective study using an anonymized electronic general practice database, data were collected from patients or users with a diabetes-related code or from patients with no DM or prediabetes code but treated with antidiabetic drugs (unregistered DM). Decision algorithms were designed to classify the true diagnosis of type 1 DM (T1DM), type 2 DM (T2DM), and undetermined DM (UDM), and to classify unregistered DM patients treated with antidiabetic drugs. Data were collected from a total of 376,278 subjects with a DM ICD-10 code, and from 8707 patients with no DM or prediabetes code but treated with antidiabetic drugs. After application of the algorithms, 13.9% of patients with T1DM were identified as misclassified, and were probably T2DM; 80.9% of patients with UDM were reclassified as T2DM, and 19.1% of them were misdiagnosed as DM when they probably had prediabetes. The overall prevalence of miscoding (multiple codes or UDM) was 2.2%. Finally, 55.2% of subjects with unregistered DM were classified as prediabetes, 35.7% as T2DM, 8.5% as UDM treated with insulin, and 0.6% as T1DM. The prevalence of inappropriate codification or classification and under-registration of DM is relevant in primary care. Implementation of algorithms could automatically flag cases that need review and would substantially decrease the risk of inappropriate registration or coding. Copyright Â© 2016 SEEN.
