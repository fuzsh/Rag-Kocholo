        "text": "Objectives\n\nThe Mathematical Sciences Department at The University of Texas at Dallas offers graduate studies in seven specializations namely - Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Engineering Mathematics, Statistics, Applied Statistics, Data Science and Actuarial Science, and an interdisciplinary degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. The degree programs offer students the opportunity to prepare for careers in these disciplines themselves or in any of the many other fields for which these disciplines offer such indispensable tools. As other sciences develop, problems which require the use of these tools are numerous and pressing.\n\nIn addition to a wide range of courses in mathematics, statistics, and actuarial science, the Mathematical Sciences Department offers a unique selection of courses that consider mathematical and computational aspects of engineering, biology and other scientific problems.\n\nThe Master of Science degree programs are designed for persons seeking specializations in Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Engineering Mathematics, Statistics, Applied Statistics, Data Science, Actuarial Science, or Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.\n\nThe Master of Science degree is also available for those who plan to teach Mathematics or Statistics above the remedial level at a community college or at a college or university. The Master of Science degree is recommended as a minimum, since a doctorate degree is sometimes required.\n\nFor information concerning the Master of Arts in Teaching in Mathematics Education, designed for persons who are teaching in grades 6-12, see the Science and Mathematics Education section.\n\nThe Doctor of Philosophy degree programs cover two basic areas of concentration: Statistics and Mathematics. They are designed for those who plan to pursue academic, government, financial, actuarial, or industrial careers.\n\nFacilities\n\nThe faculty, staff, and students have access to a large network of workstations and servers on campus.\n\nAdmission Requirements\n\nThe University's general admission requirements are discussed on the Graduate Admission page (catalog.utdallas.edu/2016/graduate/admission).\n\nSpecific additional admission requirements for students in degree programs in the Department of Mathematical Sciences follow. Students lacking undergraduate prerequisites for graduate courses in their area must complete these prerequisites or receive approval from the graduate advisor and the course instructor before registering.\n\nOne of the components of a student's academic history which is evaluated when the student is seeking admission to the graduate program is his/her performance on certain standardized tests. Since these tests are designed to indicate only the student's potential for graduate study, they are used in conjunction with other measures of student proficiency, such as GPA (grade point average), etc., in determining the admission status of a potential graduate student. Accordingly, there is no rigid minimum cutoff score for admission to the program. Most applicants admitted to either the MS or PhD programs have GRE scores of at least 143 verbal, 155 quantitative, and 310 combined. However, exceptions are made in some cases when other credentials are especially strong. Higher standards prevail for applicants seeking Teaching Assistantships.\n\nMaster of Science in Mathematics\n\n36 semester credit hours minimum\n\nDepartment Faculty\n\nFACG> nsm-mathematics-ms\n\nProfessors: @ammann, @zxb105020, @vxd123630, @sxe062000, @yxg142030, @ali, @wzk091000, @sem120030, @lfp140030, @dxr124030, @vish, @serfling, @turi, @jwz120030\n\nProfessors Emeritus: @pxo062000, @ness\n\nClinical Professors: @nah103020, @wxl153330\n\nAssociate Professors: @sxb125731, @yxc069200, @mxc136030, @pkc022000, @mkd034000\n\nAssistant Professors: @mma110020, @mxa149530, @bxc126030, @qxh102020, @fxk141230, @yxl145331, @oxm130230, @txo140730, @qxs102020, @att140830\n\nSenior Lecturers: @mka120030, @kxa143530, @mxd066000, @rxd153030, @axe031000, @mxf091000, @btg032000, @ftk100020, @yxk055000, @dlewis, @cxl109120, @bcm052000, @dxm146130, @mln018200, @jsp061000, @phs031000, @jxs158030, @tgw100020\n\nUT Dallas Affiliated Faculty: @herve, @txa051000, @axb046100, @sxl139330, @wiorkow, @zxx091000, @hxy103120, @mqz091000\n\nAdjunct Faculty from the Research for Mathematics of the Mexican Council and Technology: @jcg063000, @asv000000\n\nDegree Requirements\n\nThe University's general degree requirements are discussed on the Graduate Policies and Procedures page (catalog.utdallas.edu/2016/graduate/policies/policy).\n\nStudents seeking a Master of Science in Mathematics must complete a total of 12 three-semester credit hour courses.

During their study, our MS students acquire the necessary skills that make them highly competitive in the modern job market. Our recent graduates are currently employed as statisticians, biostatisticians, quantitative analysts, managers, actuaries, and so on, or they continue into doctoral degree programs.\n\nDegree Requirements\n\nThe University's general degree requirements are discussed on the Graduate Policies and Procedures page (catalog.utdallas.edu/now/graduate/policies/policy).\n\nThe MS degree in Statistics requires completion of 12 approved graduate courses, for a total of 36 semester credit hours. Among these courses, there will be at least 7 courses in Statistics, including 5 specified ones. The other 5 courses are electives, which may be in Statistics, Mathematics, or another discipline, according to the student's professional interests and career goals. All such decisions are made in consultation with the statistics graduate advisor and are subject to the advisor's approval.\n\nSome students choose to do research at the MS level under the supervision of one of the professors and to write a thesis. The thesis must be approved by the Head of the Mathematical Sciences Department. Once the research project is completed, the thesis requires a formal defense in front of the thesis committee. A MS thesis project can be counted as 3 or 6 semester credit hours towards the required 36 hours.\n\nEach student must earn a 3.0 minimum GPA in the courses listed for the student's program.\n\nTo satisfy the MS degree requirements, we currently offer a choice between three specializations - Statistics and Applied Statistics, and Data Science.\n\nStatistics Specialization (MS)\n\n1. Five Core Courses:\n\nStatistical Inference I\n\nAdvanced Statistical Methods I\n\nAdvanced Statistical Methods II\n\nLinear Statistical Models\n\nNumerical Linear Algebra and Statistical Computing\n\n2.
