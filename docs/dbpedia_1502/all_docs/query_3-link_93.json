        "text": "The Largest Miami Cigar Shop\n\nThe Neptune Cigar Superstore is the largest cigar shop in Miami, where you will find a huge selection of premium cigars and fine accessories for the cigar lover. Located on US1 just minutes away from Dadeland Mall, we're conveniently on your way to some of the great tourist attractions of South Florida such as the Florida Keys and the Everglades National Park. We proudly serve the communities of Coral Gables, South Miami, Kendall, Pinecrest, and Palmetto Bay in South Florida.\n\nView Larger Map\n\nAt our store you will find superior product quality, excellent customer service, and a wide-ranging selection at the lowest prices, so you can expect to find discounts of 10% to 40% less than the MSRP on our cigars and accessories. Our friendly staff is trained to offer you advice on cigars, cigar storage and preservation, and suggestions on the best accessories in the market for cigar aficionados. Just like Miami, our staff is a mix of Southern hospitality, Latin American warmth, and European flair. Our staff is fluent in English, Spanish and French.\n\nAs with our online store, detailed information is clearly printed next to each cigar, allowing you to read a description, the nation of origin, and the price of each individual cigar. The store's d√©cor suggests class and pedigree, and was designed by a renowned decorator with rich, beautiful dark wood flooring.\n\nWhat we love best about our shop is the people we meet here every day. Our customers are always happy to be here, and because this is Miami, it is not unusual to meet one of your favorite cigar makers at our lounge. About every 2 weeks we host an event with one cigar maker to give them an opportunity to meet customers and promote their brands. We throw amazing parties featuring live music, drinks, food and specials on the featured cigars. Please check our event calendar for future dates, if you're in town you do not want to miss our events!\n\nOn 1/18/2023, we closed the doors for one last time to our store located on 9308 S Dixie Hwy (Dadeland). Our current location is just a few blocks away: 12475 S Dixie Hwy, at the Pinecrest Village Plaza next to the Sherwin Williams store. We look forward to seeing you in Pinecrest! Call 786-472-1378 to speak to our staff at this store."
