        "text": "L3 acquisition has been a topic of increasing interest throughout the past decade. Nevertheless, linguistically-oriented work has so far paid little attention to the acquisition of foreign languages by second generation minority (or heritage) speakers, who have acquired two languages in early childhood. Our paper investigates article acquisition by German-Turkish speakers, who have grown up in Germany. Specifically, we address the question whether these speakers’ L3 English shows cross-linguistic influence (CLI) from Turkish (their chronological L1) or German (their chronological L2). Results indicate the absence of negative CLI from Turkish and positive CLI from German, their L2. The study can be seen as supporting the view that typological proximity is crucial for CLI, while also allowing for the conclusion that language dominance plays a role.\n\nThe data for this study consisted of a longitudinal corpus of narratives from 17 English second language (L2) children, mean age of 5;4 years at the outset, with first languages (Lls) that do not have definite/indefinite articles (Chinese, Korean and Japanese) and Lls that do have article systems (Spanish, Romanian and Arabic). We examined these children&#39;s acquisition of articles in order to determine the role of L1 transfer and, in so doing, test the Fluctuation Hypothesis, and also to compare our findings to those from research on adult L2 learners. Three tendencies were found over two years: (1) All children substituted the for a in indefinite specific contexts (i.e. showed fluctuation) regardless of L1 background; (2) all children were more accurate with use of the in definite contexts than with a in indefinite contexts, regardless of L1 background; and (3) children with [-article] Lls had more omitted articles as error forms than children with [+article] L1s, but only at th...\n\nL2 learners’ problems with English articles have been linked to learners’ L1 and their access to universal semantic features (e.g. definiteness and specificity). Studies suggest that L2 adults rely on their L1 knowledge (Ionin et al. 2008) while child L2 learners rely more on their access to semantic universals (Zdorenko & Paradis 2011). The present study investigates whether child L2 learners access features like adult L2 learners (i.e. reassembling the features of the L1) or as L1 acquirers (i.e. choosing from the inventory of universal features). We evaluated the acquisition of English articles in 30 Spanish-speaking children learning English as their L2 and found that, as adults, they transfer knowledge from their L1. However, the error analysis also suggests that article acquisition in child L2 learners is restricted by Universal Grammar resembling L1 acquisition. In conclusion, we propose that article acquisition in child L2 learners patterns with both adult L2 and L1 acquisition.\n\nIt is well-documented that native speakers of languages which lack articles and have no morphological marker for definiteness show persistent variability in the use of articles in second languages where they are present and where definiteness is marked. It has been argued that these learners use articles to mark both specificity and definiteness. This paper shows that learners display fewer problems of this kind when acquiring a third language (L3) which has articles that mark definiteness in a similar manner to that of the second language (L2). The languages under investigation in this study are Japanese (L1), English (L2) and German (L3). Results from a gap-filling task show an effect of both L3 and L2 proficiency. Furthermore, inappropriate selections appear not to be based on participants selecting articles on the basis of specificity, but instead upon the grammatical Case of the noun in question."
