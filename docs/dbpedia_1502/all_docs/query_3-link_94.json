        "text": "The 2014-15 season and the madness that came with the postseason has officially concluded, which means it's time to put that image of Duke cutting down the nets into the rearview mirror and turn our focus to the 2015-16 season.\n\nEvents of the off-season — players testing the NBA waters, the cycling of coaches and transfers through the landscape and the impact of incoming freshmen — are sure to shake things up. But for now, here's USA TODAY Sports' instant look at the way-too-early top 25 for next season.\n\n1. North Carolina (26-12, 11-7): All five starters should be back from this Sweet 16 team, giving coach Roy Williams a veteran group that can contend for a national title. Point guard Marcus Paige (14.1 ppg after 17.5 ppg as a sophomore) didn't have an All-American type of season in 2014-15 to boost his draft stock, but he'll get another chance if he stays. He remains the Tar Heels' catalyst, and expect underclassmen Kennedy Meeks and Justin Jackson to take significant jumps next season.\n\nRecruiting grade: C+. Very quiet so far with under the radar commit Luke Maye, but that could change quickly if in-state stars Brandon Ingram and/or Jaylen Brown.\n\n2. Kentucky (38-1, 18-0 in 2014-15): Coach John Calipari will likely have his roster depleted by the NBA draft. Barring any surprising comebacks like last season — Karl-Anthony Towns, Trey Lyles and Willie Cauley-Stein are projected lottery picks, Devin Booker should go in the first round and then Dakari Johnson looks like a second-rounder, and Aaron and Andrew Harrison could join him there. That's the Wildcats' top seven scorers.\n\nReserves Tyler Ulis, Alex Poythress and Marcus Lee could be the only holdovers. No matter. Calipari has once again reloaded with a stellar recruiting class, led by Skal Labissiere, No. 5 in the class of 2015 (via 247Sports), and elite point guard Isaiah Briscoe. And there are seven McDonald's All-Americans who are unsigned and considering UK, likely waiting to see what type of openings there will be.\n\nRecruiting grade: A- But only by their standards and it could quickly become an A+.\n\n3. Virginia (30-4, 16-2): The Cavaliers were dominant in 2014-15, only losing one game before March when they dropped three of six and bowed out of the NCAAs in the round of 32. If Justin Anderson returns, the bulk of the ACC regular-season championship roster will be back to avenge this past season's unhappy ending. Malcolm Brogdon (14.0 ppg) is a two-time All-American and will returns as as Virginia's leading scorer. Anthony Gill and Mike Tobey should make significant improvements as seniors, and look for pass-first point guard London Perrantes to have more scoring duties in 2015-16.\n\nRecruiting grade: B-. Jarred Reuter, a 6-8 forward is the lone signee thus far.\n\n4. Iowa State (25-9, 12-6): Georges Niang's decision to return will make the Cyclones a favorite to win the Big 12 title. Point guard Monte Morris, the nation's leader in assist-to-turnover ratio, and forward Jameel McKay will also be back for coach Fred Hoiberg, who won't have to rebuild as much as he's had to do in the past. And Iowa State again hit the transfer jackpot. Oregon State transfer Hallice Cooke, Marquette transfer Deonte Burton and junior college transfer Darien Williams could make immediate impacts. A surprising loss to UAB in the opening round of the NCAA tournament will likely fuel this team in the offseason.\n\nRecruiting grade: Incomplete. The Cyclones have four scholarships and no commitments.\n\n5. Maryland (28-7, 14-4): The Terrapins will be the favorite to win the Big Ten in their second season in the league. Leading scorer Melo Trimble's return will help an experienced Maryland team continue the momentum from a school-record 26 regular-season wins in 2014-15. The Terps lose veteran guard Dez Wells but bring in promising big man Diamond Stone (No. 10 via 247Sports).\n\nRecruiting grade: A. Five-star Stone could be a game-changer and says he sees himself on a similar trajectory to the way Maryland developed Alex Len, the fifth overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft.\n\n6. Villanova (33-3, 16-2): The Wildcats lose leading scorer Darrun Hilliard II and mainstay JayVaughn Pinkston to graduation. And Dylan Ennis announced he'll transfer. But Villanova should once again have a strong backcourt that will make it the Big East front-runner. Josh Hart (10.1 ppg) and Ryan Arcidiacono (10.1 ppg) will welcome top-30 point guard Jalen Brunson. Back-to-back unexpected early NCAA tourney exits should serve as incentive for this group.\n\nRecruiting grade: A. Brunson, who won the skills competition at the McDonald's All American Game, might already have had an impact on the program with Ennis' decision to transfer rather than play his final season with the Wildcats.\n\n7. Kansas (27-9, 13-5): Kelly Oubre Jr. announced he'll turn pro and fellow freshman Cliff Alexander likely will as well. But if KU returns leading scorer Perry Ellis (13.8 ppg), it will have its two best players back (the other being feisty point guard Frank Mason III. Both will be upperclassmen and much better, as will guard Wayne Selden Jr. and Jamari Traylor. Devonte Graham, who showed potential but never put it all together as a freshman, should also blossom. Coach Bill Self also has hauled in a dynamic power forward in Carlton Bragg (No. 18 via 247Sports).\n\nRecruiting grade: A-. The 6-9 Bragg from Cleveland is the lone member of the class thus far, but Kansas is in the running for a number of the top uncommitted players.\n\n8. Notre Dame (32-6, 14-4): The Irish lose top players Jerian Grant and Pat Connaughton but bring back core players in Zach Auguste, Demetrius Jackson, Steve Vasturia and Bonzie Colson, all of whom will take on much larger roles. A return to the Elite Eight would be a lofty goal but coach Mike Brey should have this team back in the national mix.\n\nRecruiting grade: B+. In Rex Pflueger, Notre Dame gets a multipurpose player who comes from a winning program at Mater Dei (Santa Ana, Calif.).\n\n9. Gonzaga (25-3, 17-1): The veteran backcourt — Kevin Pangos, Gary Bell Jr. and Byron Wesley — will be irreplaceable, but the returning frontcourt should keep the 'Zags in the national conversation. All-America forward Kyle Wiltjer (16.8 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 47% three-point shooting) should be back, Przemek Karnowski should take another step in his last year of elgibility and Domantas Sabonis should become one of the best big men in the country as a sophomore. Mark Few will have to figure out his starting guards for the first time in four seasons.\n\nRecruiting grade: B. Guard Jesse Wade has been committed since October 2013, but the Zags will need to add more to this class.\n\n10. Duke (35-4, 15-3): The Blue Devils will likely lose all the offensive firepower that got them to the Final Four — Quinn Cook to graduation and Jahlil Okafor, Justise Winslow and Tyus Jones to the NBA draft. But coach Mike Krzyzewski's staff is strong on the recruiting trail. It has reeled in top-30 players Chase Jeter and Luke Kennard, both of whom will see time right away. Role players Amile Jefferson, Marshall Plumlee and Matt Jones will provide leadership. And neglected freshman Grayson Allen will have an increased role.\n\nRecruiting grade: A. In McDonald's All Americans Jeter and Kennard, Duke has two players who will fit in right away. Plus, the Blue Devils remain in the running for a number of top players.\n\n***\n\n11. Arizona (34-4, 16-2): Point guard T.J. McConnell, the team's heart and soul on the past two Elite Eight teams, is gone. Stanley Johnson will likely leave as a lottery pick, and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Brandon Ashley could leave for the NBA as well. Regardless, coach Sean Miller has once again reloaded with his 2015 class — highlighted by top-15 recruits forward Ray Smith and Allonzo Trier. Holdovers Gabe York and Elliot Pitts should take on bigger roles, and likely returning 7-footer Kalen Tarczewski still has a chance to become elite. And Kadeem Allen, a junior college transfer who redshirted this past season, might be the toughest Wildcats player to defend.\n\nRecruiting grade: A. Trier is trying to recruit Oakland big man and fellow McDonald's All American Ivan Rabb, who is down to Arizona and Cal.\n\n12. UCLA (22-14, 11-7): The Bruins looked like a bottom-tier Pac-12 team at the start of last season but finished as a Sweet 16 team. They'll start much better in 2015-16, returning starting guards Bryce Alford and Isaac Hamilton. Big men Tony Parker and Thomas Welsh will also be back, while Kevon Looney is likely turning pro. UCLA's top addition will be elite recruit Prince Ali, who should help fill the void of departing guard Norman Powell.\n\nRecruiting grade: B. The Bruins bring in a pair of four stars led by Ali from Florida. The interesting X factor might be whether star football recruit Sosa Jamabo tries hoops too. Jamabo helped lead Plano (Texas) West to a state title in basketball.\n\n13. Wichita State (30-5, 17-1): The Shockers' biggest returnee will be the man that's transformed Wichita State from decent mid-major to an elite program. Coach Gregg Marshall turned down Alabama and will again have the Shockers playing with the toughness that's paved way to breakthrough success over the past three seasons. Wichita State loses Darius Carter and Tekele Cotton but brings back one of the best backcourts in the country in rising seniors Fred VanVleet and Ron Baker, who combined for more than 28 points a game last season.\n\nRecruiting grade: B+ Power forward Eric Hamilton played for a very good Sunrise Christian Academy team in Kansas, and Markus McDuffie is another excellent product of St. Anthony's in Jersey City, N.J.\n\n14. SMU (27-7, 15-3): AAC player of the year Nic Moore (14.5 ppg, 5.1 apg) is back as a senior and so is menacing big man Markus Kennedy. Keith Frazier should also be back after missing nearly half the season for eligibility reasons. Top-100 recruit Shake Milton will provide a boost to what should be a deep roster in Larry Brown's fourth season at the helm.\n\nRecruiting grade: B+. Milton is a top-100 player and the top prospect in Oklahoma, but was lured away to Dallas.\n\n15. Arkansas (27-9, 13-5): If Bobby Portis (17.5 ppg, 8.9 rpg) bypasses early entry into the NBA, expect the Razorbacks to be a serious national threat. The 1-2 punch of Portis and Michael Qualls (15.9 ppg, 5.3 rpg) make for one of the best inside-out tandems in the SEC. Rashad Madden and Alandise Harris won't be easy to replace, but there are plenty of players ready to take on bigger roles, including Anton Beard. Coach Mike Anderson brings in a strong 2015 class, led by top-40 recruit Ted Kapita, a fierce power forward.\n\nRecruiting grade: B. Kapita from Huntington (W.Va.) Prep is an enticing prospect at 6-8.\n\n16. Oklahoma (24-11, 12-6): Much depends on whether Buddy Hield (17.4 ppg) returns to Norman or goes to the NBA. The Big 12 Player of the Year would rejoin fellow starting guards Jordan Woodard and Isaiah Cousins to form one of the best backcourts in the league. TaShawn Thomas departs but Ryan Spangler (9.7 ppg, 8.2 rpg) can anchor the paint.\n\nRecruiting grade: B-. Junior college center Akolda Manyang, a 7-footer, is the primary addition.\n\n17. Texas (20-14, 8-10): Shaka Smart will usher in a new era with the program but how his techniques mesh with the talent Rick Barnes hauled in will be one of the more intriguing story lines in 2014-15. Among the likely returnees from last season's underachieving team, point guard Isaiah Taylor (13.1 ppg, 4.6 apg) could benefit the most from Smart's guidance if he skips entering the NBA draft. Big man Myles Turner has already declared. Cameron Ridley isn't a great fit for Smart's system, so it will be interesting to see how a fleet of rim-protecting bigs are used.\n\nRecruiting grade: B+. All signs point toward Smart being able to retain Barnes' two commitments. Guard Kerwin Roach Jr., a top 50 player, should fit Smart's style nicely.\n\n18. Butler (23-11, 12-6): Leading scorers Kellen Dunham and Roosevelt Jones return from last season's overachieving group. And there's no coaching uncertainty, with Chris Holtmann signing an extension through 2020-2021 after taking over for Brandon Miller last season. N.C. State transfer Tyler Lewis will likely take over controls at the point and make an immediate impact.\n\nRecruiting grade: B. In-state guard Sean McDermott is a big-time shooter from the perimeter.\n\n19. Syracuse (18-13, 9-9): The Orange lose Rakeem Christmas and Chris McCullough declared for the draft, but everyone else is back. Coach Jim Boeheim, who's announced he's retiring in three seasons, will be tasked with helping the program weather the storm in light of looming NCAA penalties. The Orange will be loaded in the backcourt with returnees Trevor Cooney, Michael Gbinije and Kaleb Joseph. Joining them will be top-20 recruit Malachi Richardson, an explosive shooting guard.\n\nRecruiting grade: B-. The Orange pulled in four four-star players led by shooting guard Malachi Richardson from Hamilton, N.J., who is ranked among the top 30 players in the class.\n\n20. Indiana (20-14, 9-9): Barring any surprising departures, the Hoosiers should bring back one of the most talented rosters of any Big Ten team, led by underrated guard Yogi Ferrell (16.3 ppg, 4.9 apg) and James Blackmon Jr., who should hit another level as a sophomore. Forward Troy Williams will also be back and is capable of averaging a double-double with more consistency. Undecided high-level recruit Thon Maker also is considering Indiana.\n\nRecruiting grade: A-. The Hoosiers' frontcourt will get an immediate boost from 6-10 five-star prospect Thomas Bryant from Huntington Prep.\n\n21. Michigan State (27-12, 12-6): In January, the Spartans were an NCAA tournament bubble team. In April, they were in the Final Four. That's a testament to just how good Tom Izzo is as a coach, both in motivating his players and mastering the Xs and Os. Travis Trice and Branden Dawson will be gone, but Denzel Valentine should return as a veteran alongside guard Bryn Forbes. Michigan State adds top-20 recruit Deyonta Davis, an athletic power forward who will be called upon early and often. And the most important newcomer to watch is West Virginia transfer Eron Harris, who dazzled in practice while sitting out this season.\n\nRecruiting grade: A. Davis is a McDonald's All American, and the Spartans also add shooter Matt McQuaid and athletic Kyle Ahrens.\n\n22. N.C. State (22-14, 10-8): There's a chance Cat Barber turns pro, but if he comes back the late-peaking Wolfpack have a chance to pose a bigger threat early in 2015-16. Barber and Trevor Lacey will make for a fearsome backcourt tandem, and N.C. State's frontcourt should be much better thanks to a year of maturity. If coach Mark Gottfried's cast plays at the level it did in the NCAAs — knocking off top-seeded Villanova to reach the Sweet 16 — they'll be a darkhorse contender in the ACC.\n\nRecruiting grade: Incomplete. The Pack has three scholarships open and no commitments. This could change quickly, especially if they can get Ingram or Malik Newman.\n\n23. Miami (25-13, 10-8): The Hurricanes will have virtually everyone back from last season's team, including the potent backcourt duo of Angel Rodriguez and Sheldon McClellan. Miami fell on the wrong side of the NCAA tournament bubble in 2014-15, but coach Jim Larrañaga will have one of the most experienced rosters in the ACC next season.\n\nRecruiting grade: C. Thus far, the class is only small forward Anthony Lawrence from St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\n24. Wisconsin (36-4, 16-2): Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker are likely first-round NBA draft picks, while Josh Gasser and Traevon Jackson are gone. Without their top two players, the Badgers won't be Final Four good. But it's still Wisconsin and as long as coach Bo Ryan is on the sidelines, there's no reason to underestimate this team and not expect a top-four finish in the Big Ten. Nigel Hayes will assert himself into a lead role. And departing point guard Jackson's injury-plagued season will pay off for blossoming combo guard Bronson Koenig, who still has two seasons of eligibility to jump into a larger role.\n\nRecruiting grade: A. The Badgers add size and strength and the scoring of 6-4 in-state guard Brevin Pritzl.​\n\n25. Utah (26-9, 13-5): All-American and do-everything guard Delon Wright will take his talents to the NBA. But everyone else is likely back from a Sweet 16 team, barring an unexpected pro departure for promising big man Jakob Poeltl. Point guard Brandon Taylor and forward Jordan Loveridge will be seniors and will play a part in keeping the Utes relevant in 2015-16.\n\nRecruiting grade: A-. In 6-9 Makol Mawein, the Utes get a shot blocker with a developing offensive game. Junior college guard Gabe Bealer is a potential scorer.\n\nJust missed: No. 26 Florida State, No. 27 Baylor, No. 28 LSU, No. 29 Texas A&M, No. 30 Tulsa\n\nAlso considered: Louisville, Purdue, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Cincinnati, Memphis, UConn, Valparaiso, Marquette, Dayton, West Virginia."
