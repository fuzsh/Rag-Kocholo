Kathryn Earle, the managing director of Berg Publishers, has been a most patient visionary, generous with her time and advice. I am grateful to Joanne B. Eicher, the series editor, for her invaluable comments. Hannah Shakespeare, Ken Bruce, Felicity Howlett, and Caroline McCarthy – all members of the Berg team – were always helpful and supportive. As we assembled the volume, the Latin American Studies Association offered its support for the project, granting the 2003 panel on “Dress, Body and Culture in Latin America” a traveling fellowship that enabled us to bring together contributors for an engaging discussion on the emerging field of Latin American fashion studies. The Wendy and Emery Reves Center for International Studies at the College of William and Mary provided additional funding for this endeavor. Moda Brasil granted first page to the conference panel, applauding the transnational approach to fashion studies at a time of world discord. Numerous readers have also contributed to the success of this project at various stages of its development. My contributors have offered their wholehearted commitment to this project at every stage. In the process, they have helped create a genuinely thoughtful and ever growing community of scholars who work on Latin American dress, body and culture. Catherine Barrera, Gwen Kirkpatrick, Francine Masiello, Laura Novik, and Barbara Weissberger shared great insight and offered moral support in more ways than they probably know. Yosi Anaya, Virginia Davis, Rachel DiNitto, Bill Fisher, Christopher Larkosh, Silvia Tandeciarz, Sibel Zandi-Sayek and several anonymous readers provided engaging reader comments. While at Old Dominion University, Anita Fellman, Luisa Igloria, Sujata Moorti and Carolyn Rhodes of the Women’s Studies program were the most encouraging colleagues I could have had. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to participate in a 2000 workshop organized by Laura Novik for faculty and students of the University of Buenos Aires Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Urbanismo. This workshop, along with the stimulating dialogue with designers and merchandisers at the Centro de Estudios de la Moda in Argentina, helped me formulate the parameters of this project in its earliest stages. From that point on I have been fortunate to work with colleagues and designers in many countries. As we finalized the volume, the vision of Rita Andrade and the talented fashion photographer Jaques Faing of Brazil helped make the cover a reality.\n\nxv\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMy colleagues at the College of William and Mary also deserve great thanks.

Itsy bitsy Brazilian underwear modeled by Giselle Bündchen and sold in the pages of Victoria’s Secret. Sueded ponchos for an elegant overlayer in Paris. Handwoven bags from Chiapas with pre-Columbian motifs carried in Buenos Aires with the spirit of resistance. Designers affiliated with the Color Marketing Group have created a palette of so-called “Latin tones” – from romantic pinks to “earth-connected hues” – for the fashions targeting United States Baby Boomers over the next decade. From the rainbow that adorns Mayan women to the tango-inspired dress of Argentina, Latin American dress has long been a source of inspiration to designers from around the world. Surprisingly, however, scholars continue to overlook the influences, scope and diversity of dress within this world culture region. Bringing together an international community of scholars whose research focuses on the interrelationship between dress, body and culture, this volume reveals a diverse set of responses that aim to unravel the history and significance of Latin American fashion. What, then, is Latin American fashion? The very term, which refers to the dress, body and culture of a large and heterogeneous world culture region, might seem all too impractical for the scholar wishing to compare and contrast the fashions of Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America. Given that the nature of dress in Latin America is highly diversified, the chapters of this volume look to overlapping socio-historical influences that have shaped the pursuit of elegance and transformed cultural dynamics to elucidate some general characteristics for the region. As a cultural process, fashion is a profoundly social experience that invites individual and collective bodies to assume certain identities and, at times, also to transgress limits and create new ones. Taking into consideration the transnational flows and multicultural influences of dress and material culture, this volume aims to initiate an interdisciplinary discussion on the paths for research in the field. Crossing boundaries to attain a more integrated approach, the Latin American Fashion Reader maps the multivalent nature of fashion’s discursive and visual registers. To address the transformative qualities of Latin American fashion, this volume is organized into five parts. Relying heavily on archival research, the first part unravels Latin American fashion history through the examination of the region’s colonial legacy and the power of dress. A section on altered traditions turns to ethnographic fieldwork to rethink the points of contact\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nbetween local knowledge and the global context. At first glance, the resonances of fashion might seem limitless, as if the local were constantly remade for a world market. Despite the aggressive interactions of world trade, there also appear to exist clear boundaries that allow for individual – in this case indigenous – communities to preserve the sacred attributes of their traditional rites and dress. The essays of the third part address the role of the cultural imaginary, situating the articulations of dress within and beyond the parameters of urban and national spaces. From the Argentine ponchos confectioned for Parisian collections to the Brazilian bikinis shown on Cable News Network (CNN), the cultural imaginary links individual styles and collective fantasies to the historical understandings of myth and national identity. The fourth part further informs the mediation and consumption of culture through the study of fashion icons; final words in search of fashion expose the contested territories negotiated by Latin American fashion scholars to politicize and make over the realm of the quotidian.\n\nUnraveling History1 When Christopher Columbus claimed the islands of Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Haiti for Spain in 1492, he initiated the conquest of the indigenous populations living in the region known today as Latin America and the Caribbean. The first images and accounts of American natives that circulated throughout Europe reveal much about a sense of awe experienced by the first colonizers. They viewed the natives’ “nakedness” with bewilderment and marveled at the presence of material goods such as cotton cloth, intricate feather work and weavings. This “New World” would provide Europe with material goods as varied as silver, gold, sugar, chocolate, textiles and dye. Portugal, involved in its own push for colonial power, would successfully challenge Spain for the region that makes up today’s Brazil. As Spain and Portugal quickly established colonial governments, the native populations suffered the effects of brutal conquest, incurable disease, and forced conversion to Christianity. Friar Bartolomé de Las Casas would coin the term “black legend” to describe the exploitative practices of conquistadors and settlers who had turned to slavery and other forms of systematic violence to establish ranches, mines and textile industries. To maintain a sense of hierarchy and respond to increasing mestizaje, or racial mixing, a caste system was established throughout the region. Prior to colonization, dress and textiles had often served as indicators of social and religious identity and as mediums of exchange, a fact that European authors of the period often disregarded. The caste system forced natives and African slaves to wear Western styles of dress, thereby reinforcing the authority of the Spanish and Portuguese and, over time, their creole descendants. Some indigenous communities gave voice to their history and religious beliefs with the help of intricate 2\n\nIntroduction\n\ncolor coding systems as found in woven textiles or the compilations of strings used in traditional narratives. In this way, the huipil of Guatemala and the highlands of Mexico placed deities of the sun and the underworld in dialogue with the Christian faith. Still worn today by Mayan women, the traditional blouse component of their traje, or dress, reveals information about the wearer’s village, status, heritage, and personal beliefs. Recent excavations in Argentina and Brazil point to the African and Islamic origins of some pieces of jewelry found near the sites of plantations and urban mansions, suggesting that accessories may not have been censored by colonial authorities in the same way as dress. Colonial powers often allowed one to wear almost any design provided that it was gender specific. The selection of fabric, however, was a highly serious matter. Depending on her social status, a Mexican woman of the eighteenth century would have purchased either a silk or cotton rebozo, or scarf. Decrees prohibited the use of certain textiles by those whom the caste system deemed as inferiors, thus leading to the prohibition of velvet or taffeta for specially fashioned Incan unkus, or tunics, in the Andean region. In the first part of the volume, Mariselle Meléndez analyzes the construction of cultural, racial and ethnic differences as mediated by the rhetoric of clothing in colonial Spanish America. In the colonial visual register, nakedness marked the “barbarian” Other while clothing served to privilege the more powerful, “civilized” Europeans. To reach a more complete understanding of the nuances of dress in this period, Meléndez investigates the contradictory identity of the shipwrecked conquistador, whose unfortunate circumstances often forced him into a state of nakedness, and the subaltern of the late eighteenth century who manipulated dress codes to challenge the caste system. Once the lack of clothing was no longer the issue and racial miscegenation challenged the very categories of the caste system, the aura of colonial power began to disintegrate. In this light, these disruptive performances of dress serve as early cultural indicators of the crisis that would lead to a region-wide independence movement and the subsequent fragmentation of the Spanish Empire. By the early nineteenth century, the region experienced several calls for independence from Spain and Portugal that deeply affected the way people consumed fashion. For Cuba and Puerto Rico, this struggle for independence would not materialize until the end of the nineteenth century, although the description of fashion and dance in several literary works began to plot the demise of Spanish rule and construct alternate political identities. In the visual imaginary of this period, creole political leaders such as Simón Bolívar (Venezuela) and José de San Martín (Argentina) appear in wind-swept capes and uniforms of their own design. Many women found themselves called upon to sew the accessories of war, their products in view and their identities concealed. A few, like Juana de Azurduy (Bolivia) and Josefa de Tenorio (Argentina), took on male uniforms in order to fight on the battlefield, later arguing that they merited equal status in postcolonial society.\n\n3\n\nIntroduction\n\nDistancing themselves from the customs of Spain, the fashionable women of Buenos Aires would transform the Spanish peineta, or hair comb, into the threefeet by three-feet Argentine peinetón in order to assert their presences and at times obstruct the very public sphere that professed independence from oppression but which, ironically, had not yet granted all inhabitants of the River Plate region the privilege of citizenship. My essay explores the metonymy of this fashionable style in order to elucidate its cultural significance in the postcolonial period: The peinetón, which in the early 1800s categorized an oddlooking but highly fashionable hair comb, was later used as a term to describe the politically conscious woman whose crowned head granted her a great deal of significance in the public sphere. In satirical caricatures from the 1830s, the enlarged crests of women’s combs invade downtown Buenos Aires and overpower the top hats of men. By 1837, government-sponsored popular poetry would equate the peinetón-wearing woman with the prostitute, reminding all that fashionable crowns granted women reign over their domestic obligations but not over the political life of the emerging Argentine republic. In nineteenth-century Mexico, the unique dress of working class women – embroidered white blouses, fine woven scarves and brightly colored skirts – caught the eye of the foreign traveler. Rich with symbolism and folklore, this so-called china poblana costume referred to the servant dress of a woman from Puebla while at the same time evoking the legendary china poblana, an Asian woman brought to Mexico as a slave in the seventeenth century. Just as important as the Spanish maja and Parisian grisette, the costume of the china poblana has been transformed over the centuries into a national archetype for the Mexican woman. As Mexico struggled to define itself as a nation in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, this dress evolved as well, later versions colored with the green, red and white hues of the flag that evoke patriotic sentiments in native Mexicans. In the United States, the elected queen who presides over the Cinco de Mayo festivities, often wears china poblana to celebrate her Mexican American heritage. In the next essay, Kimberly Randall analyzes the information provided in travel diaries and foreign correspondence to reconstruct what the china poblana looked like at the pinnacle of her expression. Costume histories have often categorized Latin America as a region where outmoded styles prevail long after they have circulated elsewhere, thereby privileging the status of European fashion centers. Randall focuses her study on the contrast between elite Mexican fashions, which tended to follow styles espoused by the fashion presses of France, Great Britain and Spain, and the dynamic configurations under way in the more popular sectors. Taking another look at the very narratives that have informed traditional costume historians’ assessments of Latin American design – and which contemporary scholars have often disregarded for their racist descriptions – Randall’s work exposes the layered segments and multicultural fusions of this intricate dress. Araceli Tinajero’s essay extends the categories of Latin American fashion to include the Far Eastern influences that were brought to the region as a result of Spanish imperialistic expansion. During the colonial period, Spanish 4\n\nIntroduction\n\nmercantilist trade routes brought silks from the Philippines, porcelain from China, and cotton from India to various Latin American ports. Tinajero reviews colonial shipping news and finds that samples of these goods remained in Latin America and influenced the behavior of all sectors of the population, but especially the colonizers who cherished these items and the colonized artisans who began to integrate Far Eastern designs in their work. Looking to the Asian artifacts that inform the late nineteenth-century writings of Rubén Darío (the prominent Nicaraguan author whose works initiated the first uniquely Latin American literary movement) and contemporary Feng Shui practices, Tinajero explains that Orientalism has informed and shaped the region’s fashions for centuries. While contemporary scholars must still link the consumption of these fashions to exoticism and the neo-colonial relationships that govern the trade of Far Eastern goods, it is clear that the impact of Asian immigrants on contemporary Latin American material culture has also brought about a significant, and positive, shift in attitudes. The popularity of Chinatowns and Sayonara sandals in contemporary Peru, Tinajero argues, may very well be part of a process – however contradictory – that will lead to a greater acceptance of multicultural values in the region.\n\nAltered Traditions Rapid modernization, tourism, globalization . . . In recent years, these phenomena have altered significantly the ways in which artisans create, consume and market traditional ritual clothes and “ethnic” dress. When indigenous garments are sold to the tourist who seeks an authentic version of “native costume,” a process that anthropologists often analyze as the consumption of ethnicity, these artifacts are severed from their ceremonial origins as they enter into a secular world consisting of market-driven forces and, at times, contradictory political economies. Each of the four essays in this part deals with a different aspect of the alteration of “traditional” indigenous dress for sale in the marketplace. Pamela Scheinman asks if modernization imposes “inevitable and irreversible conditions, in effect coercing conservative subsistence farmers into a cash economy and mestizo culture” or if marginalized social groups can find a way in which to mediate this process. To investigate this question, she turns to the case of ixcacles, handmade agave fiber sandals that Nahua society invests with magical powers in curing rituals and for walking into the afterlife. Turning to historical documents and interviews with craftswomen, Scheinman perceptively explores the abandonment of indigenous languages and dress through the lens of Mexican cultural history and the making of ixcacles. While traditional wearers still abound, young people have discarded their ixcacles in favor of more modern – and less indigenous – styles. In recent years, Scheinman writes, craftspeople have modified their designs to appeal to tourists who will use them as beachwear or a souvenir, thereby perpetuating their income and their cultural heritage. 5\n\nIntroduction\n\n“Why do gringos like black?” an artisan asked Blenda Femenías when she was studying the alterations of traditional ritual clothes into commodities no longer primarily invested with sacred meaning. For the inhabitants of Caylloma, Peru, black signifies a state of mourning, while for tourists it often represents a fashion statement that they can wear for special occasions back home. Furthermore, many tourists request specially designed embroideries that natives associate with festival styles. How, then, does the artisan fashion a garment that combines mourning and festival styles, as in the case of a commissioned vest that Femenías discusses, and simultaneously maintain the integrity of the artisan’s role in society? After all, sacred cloths and designs are indeed for sale; what differs is that they are being sold to people who will not use them for the reasons they were created. At the same time, we are reminded that “outside influences” do not solely determine these transformations; “local artisans have also initiated change for local customers,” the author explains. Combining original ethnographic research with a narrative of personal experiences, Femenías maps the increasingly secularized trading places of Caylloma, demonstrating the multi-layered negotiations an ethnic artisan addresses in the creation of “authentic native costume” and the marketing of his or her “Indian” identity. Drawing on two years of ethnographic fieldwork and apprenticeship, Elayne Zorn takes us to the coca-growing region of Bolivia to analyze a regional fashion industry – independent of but parallel to Western commercial fashion enterprises – that provides embroidered ethnic dress to the people of Northern Potosí. The Sakaka ayllu, a community of about 21,000 people who themselves combine distinctive clothes of their own design with factory-produced garments to signal their cultural heritage, create “traditional” clothes that will reach wearers of different markets and ethnic backgrounds. Because Bolivian society is highly polarized along racial and ethnic lines, indigenous styles, while symbolically poetic for the wearer, imply a low social status. Western-style dress grants the wearer a higher status in society; a change in fashion is thus a matter of great significance, as the wearer must forge a new identity that detracts from his or her ethnic affiliations. The Sakaka, many of whom sold heirloom textiles during the “ethnic art” boom of the 1980s to survive, now use wages earned from seasonal labor in the coca/cocaine economy to create new “traditional” designs that reaffirm their sense of community despite the numerous forces, such as modernization or racism, working against them. If the previous essays reveal how artisans have altered their traditions in response to market demands, then Elyse Demaray, Melody Keim-Shenk and Mary Littrell provide an important perspective on how foreign businesses rely on varying concepts of “tradition” to market “boundary textile art” to customers who reside in developed countries. Boundary art, as the authors define it, is produced by an ethnic group for sale to outsiders and “crosses the boundary where . . . two cultures meet” (Baizerman 1987: 5). Turning to field research, on-site interviews and observations, the authors analyze two United\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nStates-based businesses with differing goals that ultimately determine their approach to tradition, which in turn affect the ways in which artisans fashion their goods and interact with the global market economy. As a fair trade enterprise, Maya Traditions carefully balances the traditional techniques and designs of Mayan weavers while changing colors and styles according to market demands. The upscale, for-profit Peruvian Connection, which has excelled in an extremely competitive market while granting its employees more than subsistence wages, emphasizes Peruvian cultural heritage but not motifs. Tradition, as the authors of this and the other essays demonstrate, varies according to each culture and exists apart from its representation in the global economy. While grounded in the past through meaning, the idea of what constitutes “tradition” finds itself subject to continuous negotiations in the present, as the interaction between artisans, consumers (both native and foreign), and the businesses that market these commodities attests.\n\nFashion and the Cultural Imaginary For some scholars, aspects of Latin American fashion – whether the garment or department store – serve as a point of entry into questions of national identity as determined by economic, socio-political and cultural transformations. In her meditation on the Argentine poncho, Ruth Corcuera delves into the garment’s mythical past, revealing its semi-nomadic indigenous origins and explaining its subsequent appropriation by the gauchos who roamed the country’s interior. Sometimes an individual’s sole material possession, the poncho could serve its owner as a bed, a pillow, a card table, and even a house. Corcuera, whose studies of textiles and ponchos have helped shape the field of cultural anthropology in her native Argentina, reveals here the form and symbolic complexity of this garment. The poncho, she argues, while associated in the Argentine cultural imaginary with freedom and geographical expanse, also serves as a testament to cultural integration. Reading the history of Argentina’s frontier through the poncho, her essay valorizes the indigenous roots of the garment and brings to light the socio-political transformations that have made this very garment a symbol of Argentine national identity. The poncho may exist in many forms throughout Latin America and the world, but for many Argentines its messages and meanings remit to an Edenic past. Rita Andrade’s chapter examines the social impact that Mappin Stores, a British department store launched in Brazil in 1913, would have on the lives of paulistas, or the inhabitants of São Paulo. Referred to endearingly as Casa Mappin, this department store relied heavily on class-based hierarchies prevalent in city life to market its vision of sophistication and modernity at a moment of urban expansion and massive immigration. In her essay, Andrade uncovers the documents and advertisements once housed in the Mappin Historical Archive, now closed to the public, to elucidate how five- o’clock tea,\n\n7\n\nIntroduction\n\nred brick buildings and even British libraries infused São Paulo, today Brazil’s largest city, with a certain “Englishness.” This extensive study on the dissemination and consumption of English style reveals the irony with which European ideas and fashions eventually merged into an urban experience of “Brazilianness.” If the previous chapter explores the dynamics of foreign fashion consumption in Brazil, Nizia Villaça explores the influences of the beach fashions of Rio de Janeiro on national and global culture. In the media and on tourist postcards, attention to a stereotypical Copacabana “way of life” has neglected to address issues of socio-economic disparity and political resistance. “In the window of being and seeming,” she reminds us, “fashion is a kind of record keeper that reveals aspects of individual and collective appearance.” Approaching Brazilian beachwear in a semiotic fashion, Villaça places the trend-setting garments that helped establish Rio de Janeiro as the body’s “cultural capital” in dialogue with their respective moments of creation. The stress on bodily freedom at the beach, for instance, might be read as a form of resistance that addressed the sexual, racial and political divisions imposed on Brazilians from 1965 to 1984, a period plagued by military dictatorship. Unisex thongs and flower-power designs represented, to borrow the words of cultural critic Luiz Carlos Maciel, the only free territory in a dictatorial country. In later decades, within the context of a globalized economy, beach fashions have reflected an increasingly fragmented – and tribal – set of ethical stands and approaches to leisure in Rio de Janeiro. Beach fashions, Villaça reveals, are as complex as the city that has continuously witnessed their emergence from the waves of the sea. Dilia López-Gydosh and Marsha A. Dickson highlight the transformations in Puerto Rican women’s dress immediately following the Spanish American War of 1898, chronicling the presence of cross-cultural fusions in dress that remit to the legacy of Spanish and later United States colonialism. Grounded in the analysis of fashion magazines, photographic representations of women, records of fashion imports to the island, as well as religious and travel narratives, this essay suggests that women discarded some Spanish fashions for those of the United States in order to push for their rights to self-expression in a traditional society that did not favor their political participation. With the opening of department stores and the publication of weekly fashion magazines in Puerto Rico, women discarded the Spanish elements of their styles, such as the mantilla for the hat, and their fashions increasingly reflected the push towards cultural assimilation. López-Gydosh and Dickson point out that some, mostly understated, forms of Spanish dress persisted through the early part of the twentieth century, like eyelet “lace” with ribbon trim or the “untucked” shirtwaist. Nostalgic revivals of “empire” dress appeared in the 1910s. Eventually, however, the only remnant of Spanish colonialism found in women’s dress was the porta-abanico, a long necklace that carried a folded fan. Because “every girl had a fan which she kept always in motion,” as one American visitor to the island would observe in 1899, the authors suggest that women may have engaged a subtle language of resistance. With their seemingly restrained fan\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nwaves, captured indelibly in early twentieth-century photographs, several women quietly undermined the recent transference of power as they contemplated more personalized paths to liberation.\n\nCultural Mediation and Consumption Into the twentieth century, Latin American dress would inspire several fashions in Europe and the United States, from the blouse with lace ruffles inspired by the Afro-Cuban rhumba to the well-known Mexican huaraches (or woven leather sandals) to the straw Panama hat actually created in Ecuador. Vogue and Look turned attention to trendsetting Latin American women whose visions of haute couture, as in the case of Eva Perón (Argentina), and native designs, as in the case of surrealist painter Frida Kahlo (Mexico), would continue to resonate in the popular imaginary until the present day. Other, more contemporary, fashion statements have tended to revisit the past for a retro-effect, such as the young Cuban American donning the guayabera, a lightweight, embroidered cotton shirt worn outside the pants throughout the Caribbean; or the Chicano Zoot-suiter, whose wartime appropriations of his father’s suits inspired ethnic pride in the face of racism and brutality; or the teenage club kid wearing Inca-techno styles while discotheque-dancing. The final chapters in this volume deal with the cultural mediation and consumption of fashionable Latin(o) American identities. In her essay on the guayabera, Marilyn Miller examines the multivalent manifestations of this icon of Caribbean cultural identity and fashion. “The guayabera invests its wearer with Cubanness,” she writes, even if its style has become more popular outside Cuba than on the island. Soldiers who fought for Cuban independence in 1898 wore the simply cut shirt; following the revolution of 1959, Fidel Castro and government officials adapted the guayabera as a kind of professional uniform, conveying a relaxed attitude that many associated with the guajiros, or people from rural areas, rather than the “civilized” elite of Havana. While the guayabera is no longer ubiquitous as everyday wear in Cuba, it provides nightclub waiters and bartenders who cater to foreign tourists with a touch of cubanía, or Cubanness. Many Hispanics living in the United States find that the breezy shirt brings “the Latin back to their (Latin) American identity,” as Miller explains, adding that the garment has also become the “costume of the financially successful but perpetually nostalgic Cuban American.” In recent years, United States-based labels, including Banana Republic and Donna Karan, have created elegant, unisex versions of this Caribbean fashion, signaling the garment’s integration beyond nationalist and regionalist discourses and into contemporary crossover cultures. Because fashion can be so highly charged culturally, its representation in writing also signals a carefully constructed symbolic order. Grounded in psychoanalytic theory and gender studies, James Pancrazio’s chapter on\n\n9\n\nIntroduction\n\n“Transvestite Pedagogy” investigates the complexities of (literary) transvestism in fashionable discourse as published in popular magazines two decades after Cuban independence, in the 1920s. Following the retreat of Spanish colonialism, the rhetoric of fashion provided a forum for discussions on the configuration of national identity, even if that identity came to the shores of the island from afar. At a time of postcolonial renovation, Cuban fashion writing plotted ways in which the public might consume fashion and its newly emancipated cultural identity. In this meditation on cultural crisis, Pancrazio uncovers the early fashion writings of renowned Cuban author Alejo Carpentier, penned under the female pseudonym of Jacqueline in the pages of Havana’s Social magazine. Jacqueline, who most readers associated with a fashionable French or United States identity, helped sell seemingly elitist magazines – and its ideas – to a popular readership. At the same time, fashion descriptions rendered Jacqueline’s identity elusive and fluid, as if to mediate the cultural discourse of an emerging Cuban nation. The tensions at play in these chronicles hinged on the idea of insularity, which entailed resisting external influences in the nationbuilding process, and the idea of instrumentality, which implied the appropriation of foreign models for the island’s cultural development. If “transvestism is a textual act,” as Pancrazio suggests, then Carpentier’s cross-dressing initiates a “play of masks” that modernity itself would seem to represent. After all, the self that writes cannot be the self that is represented, and the writing self must become absent if it is to appear as representation. Thus, a didactic language based on the power of fantasy and self-transformation encouraged readers to consider individualized designs alongside the more collective visions of Cuba’s political and cultural future. Cultural mediation also affects the ways in which we consume and perceive Latin American icons, their images “seducing” an interpretive global community of consumers that seems forever fascinated with the lives and looks of some celebrities. Among the more cult-like icons, we find Ernesto “Che” Guevara, Frida Kahlo, Eva Perón, their stylized images found screenprinted on T-shirts worldwide, mass-merchandised to the point of erasing their cultural significance. María Claudia André describes the historical roles and revisions of Kahlo and Perón, two “Latin American icons for export” who actively engaged the self-conscious construction and reproduction of their own images and who “sought to construct an ideal of themselves that paradoxically both matches and mismatches most of the consumer theories and practices that have made icons out of them.” In their lifetimes, both women used their status as the wives of famous men to challenge patriarchal domination at historical junctures that limited women’s political participation. In her art and in real life, Frida Kahlo emphasized her mestiza heritage, asserting a post-revolutionary Mexican cultural identity through the use of traditional costumes. Her selfportraits represent dress as a source of resistance against the legacy of colonialism and twentieth-century brands of cultural imperialism. Ultimately, the very machine of mass production and consumption that Kahlo resisted during her\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nlifetime ended up absorbing – and even marketing – her message. As André’s essay demonstrates, designers have consistently reworked Kahlo’s style since her canonization as a Mexican surrealist in the 1930s. Elsa Schiaparelli honored her with the creation of a dress in her name in the 1930s, and several decades later, Jean Paul Gaultier promoted a seductive Frida vamp to “update” the artist’s image for the new millenium. In contrast, Eva Perón wore haute couture designs (she was one of Christian Dior’s main customers) while also confirming the status of the working classes, who understood her fashion motivations because she shared their humble origins. Like Kahlo’s image, the style of the woman who the Argentine masses endearingly referred to as “Evita” has been packaged and repackaged in numerous cultural productions, with Madonna’s fashion-conscious portrayal of the Argentine political leader in the 1996 film Evita providing just one of many examples. Today, the images of Frida and Evita appear on jacket designs and thematic earrings and handbags throughout the world. The postmodern cultural fetish for self-defining consumption in a global economy, André argues powerfully, is gradually erasing the meaning of these historical figures, “attenuating the urgency of radical social change and displacing it into cultural dilettantism and quietism” (cited in André). How are fashionable “Latin American” and “Latino” identities mediated in popular culture? Claudia M. Milian Arias explores the fashioning and consumption of “Salvadoranness” in the United States by unveiling the faces of domestic servant Rosa López and supermodel Christy Turlington. López, a political refugee from El Salvador who represents explicit Salvadoranness, gained prominence in the mid-1990s when she served as a defense witness for the O.J. Simpson trial. Turlington, to whom the Metropolitan Museum of Art awarded the Face of the Twentieth Century Award and upon whom its Costume Institute’s models are modeled, dedicates much energy to Salvadoran American causes and serves as the chairwoman of the International Committee for Intercambios Culturales (Cultural Exchanges) of El Salvador. Yet her Salvadoran identity is difficult to place, for the media has “unracialized” and then “reracialized” her ethnic roots, creating an entirely new category in a celebritystyle caste system that projects a “whitened” American ideal. This is “Christyturlingtonicity,” reads Media Week. “Maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s Maybelline,” claim many commercials for the make-up line that Turlington represents. Grounded in critical race theory and fashion studies, Milian Arias’ essay demonstrates how cultural mediations of image – and ultimately fashion – are in perpetual motion, highlighting and erasing differences that the media creates and the public consumes.\n\nIn Search of Fashion In the final essay to this volume, cultural critic Fabricio Forastelli returns to his native Argentina to uncover the status of fashion. He arrives on 18 December\n\n11\n\nIntroduction\n\n2003, during an intense political moment that commemorates the victims of police brutality following Argentina’s economic collapse in 2001. Just two years later, Forastelli discovers that the state of Latin American fashion is in flux, as individual and collective forms of dress disclose some very powerful emotions. His essay remembers the latter part of the twentieth century, which witnessed a horrifying backlash against democratic values when countries such as Argentina, Chile and Uruguay installed military governments. Strict gender codes imposed clean-cut looks for men and feminine styles for women. Responding to human rights abuses and the plight of the “disappeared” (which refers to the tens of thousands of victims who were killed or whose whereabouts still remain unknown), the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo in Argentina began to protest near important national monuments in their morning robes and house slippers, as if to state visually that they had no one at home to care for as the regime had taken away their sons and daughters. Today, the Mothers wear a white scarf, embroidered with the names of their missing loved ones, during their weekly marches. Around this same period, in other parts of the region, the revolutionary movements of Cuba (1959–present) and Nicaragua (1979–90) signaled a turn towards socialist anti-fashion, which associated the elitist pursuit of luxury with the kind of capitalist domination that created dependencies on foreign goods and which exploited the working classes. Indeed, much of Latin America had experienced uneven economic development throughout the twentieth century. In the garment industry, multinationals relied on the cheap labor of native workers for the weaving, assembly and sewing of garments. Yet in recent years, even revolutionary Fidel Castro (Cuba) has occasionally shed his camouflage for the sartorial pleasures of a dark blue designer suit. A heightened awareness of the sweatshop conditions of the maquiladora industry, or the exportprocessing zones established in the 1960s and which still operate today under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), sometimes led consumers to boycott specific collections and push for a more socially conscious fashion system. Some designers, such as Carlos Miele (Brazil), have worked with women of the favelas, or shantytowns, and various indigenous communities to establish cooperatives that will ensure fair-trade wages for their creations. Situated in a transnational context, Forastelli’s chapter links local forms of knowledge in the urban setting to the global forces at play in Latin American fashions. During a recent visit to Argentina, the author met with university intellectuals and queer activists to find that they have aligned themselves politically with those disenfranchised by neoliberal economic policies. What to wear in such a context?, he asks. “In a city where one out of every two people is unemployed or underemployed, dressing like a Subcomondante Marcos would be a bit of an overstatement,” Forastelli writes. At the university, fashionable dress is regarded as a kind of “narcissistic projection,” one in which perhaps only visiting scholars dare partake. Furthermore, scholarly interventions deemed fashionable in Europe and the United States may not offer the\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nradical message that Argentine academics, negotiating the promise of the future while facing the memory of dictatorships past, hope to hear. Following a lecture by Gayatri Spivak at the University of Buenos Aires in 2003, firmly grounded in postcolonial theories on cultural imperialism, some members of the audience were known to have joked mockingly amongst themselves – saying “Shut up!” as if to indicate a false surprise – in the months that followed. These days, Forastelli suggests, Argentines want more help deciphering contemporary economic discourses that seem as mysteriously encoded as pre-Colombian hieroglyphs. “As economic recipes after Argentina’s deluge become more and more impossible to read in the discourses of transnational financial bodies,” he explains, “dress may be the very performance that helps us calculate the ruins of the local amidst the ashes of the economic global market.” Even transvestites have modified their dress to reflect the dynamics of everyday life in Argentina. “You would expect Argentine transvestites to dress with glamour,” Lohana Berkins explains at a mass protest. “Wrong. Now we dress without glamour, like any other sweaty worker in the streets.” What is Latin American fashion and how might we approach the power of its messages and transformations? This volume represents but a star on a larger map, as the very object of our study ultimately reveals whole worlds of culture. Crossing the boundaries of academic disciplines, the transnational scope of this emerging field offers many exciting possibilities for an integrated discussion of dress as it relates to cultural process, identity formation and social change in Latin America. As fashion interprets the present and plots the future, the answer to the question posed above will certainly depend on whom you decide to ask.\n\n13\n\nVisualizing Difference\n\n1\n\nVisualizing Difference: The Rhetoric of Clothing in Colonial Spanish America\n\n1\n\nMariselle Meléndez\n\nClothing has played a vital role in the process of identity construction of different ethnic and racial groups. Corporeal decorations, accessories, jewelry, costume, and types of fabrics, for example, have been historically used by diverse social groups to distinguish themselves and visually express particular cultural identities.2 Clothing has also constituted a rhetorical vehicle to establish power relationships, social categorizations, and degrees of civilization among societies. As Pierre Bourdieu (1984: 7) suggests, systems of domination can find expression in the preferences for certain kind of clothing by fulfilling “a social function of legitimating social differences.” In the case of colonial Spanish America, the absence or lack of clothing functioned as a determinant factor to classify and categorize others. Difference was visually and discursively constructed through the rhetoric of clothing. This chapter examines the importance of clothing as a social marker and a rhetorical strategy in the process of identity construction in colonial Spanish America. First, I discuss the role that lack of clothing played in the narratives of conquest and colonization as well as its importance for some Amerindian societies previous to the Spanish arrival in the so-called New World.” Taking into consideration European authors such as Fray Ramón Pané, Cristóbal Colón, Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Bernal Díaz del Castillo, Pedro Cieza de León as well as mestizo and indigenous writers such as Guaman Poma de Ayala and Inca Garcilaso, I indicate the significance of clothes as a sign of cultural, racial and ethnic superiority. The second part of the chapter is devoted to the role that clothing played as a symbolic tool of recognition as seen in legal and literary texts of the late colonial period.3 I examine how eighteenth-century remarks by colonial authorities and male writers responded to the importance that clothing played in the visual categorization of the colonial citizens. Within this context, clothing functioned as a “strategic cultural practice” (Pratt 1992: 17\n\nUnraveling History\n\n167) that aimed to express superiority and distinction. As a sign of visual recognition, clothing was manipulated by subaltern groups to challenge the social categorizations that were once imposed by Spaniards to limit social movement. This chapter contends that in the eighteenth century, clothing was considered a dangerous sign of cultural transgression and a destabilizing factor in the colonial social order due to its dynamic nature of appropriation.\n\nLack of Clothing and the Differentiation of the “Other” in Early Colonial Texts Walter Mignolo observes that the lack of writing along with the lack of clothing and cannibalism constituted three crucial elements often used in the construction of Amerindian images: “Not having it yet or having it in excess were two cognitive moves used by Europeans in constructing the identity of the self-same by constructing at the same time, the image of the other” (Mignolo 1992: 312). Written as well as visual texts usually contrasted the nakedness of the indigenous people with the presence of clothing in the European to emphasize the superiority of the latter over the former.4 This was also true for the case of visual representations of the African slaves in the Americas, as early engravings reveal (see Figure 1). Naked bodies symbolized within colonial discourse lack of civilization and social inferiority. Christopher Columbus offers us the first written accounts in which lack of clothing worked as a visual reminder of the native disposition to be mastered and civilized. In his “Carta a Santángel” (1493/1978: 6), Columbus comments: The inhabitant of both sexes in this island, and in all the others which I have seen, or of which I have received information, go always naked as they were born, with the exception of some of the women, who use the covering of a leaf, or a small bough, or an apron of cotton which they prepare for that purpose. None of them, as I have already said, are possessed of any iron, neither have they weapons, being unacquainted with, and indeed incompetent to use them, not from any deformity of body (for they are well-formed), but because they are timid and full of fear.\n\nNative identity was articulated in terms of lack of clothing and weapons that make them inferior but not dangerous.5 For Europeans, moral and physical nakedness justified their presence in foreign lands as fully civilized clothed men. They were “to dress” the Amerindians in a literal and figurative manner, covering their bodies and their souls with fabric, religion, and reason. From the very beginning of the encounter, clothing came to be understood as a sign of difference and a symbol of power. Even the natives according to Columbus, came to be aware of this fact:\n\n18\n\nVisualizing Difference\n\nFigure 1.1. Black slaves working the mines on the island of Hispaniola. Benzoni, Girolamo. “Americae, das fu[e]nffte Buch.” Frankfurt a. M.: E. Kempfer 1613. (Theodor de Bry’s “America.” Pt. 5. German.) Courtesy of the Rare Book and Special Collections Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. [The Indians] have a firm belief that all strength and power, and indeed all good things, are in heaven, and that I descended from thence with these ships and sailors, and under this impression was I received after they had thrown aside their fears . . . and those men who have crossed to the neighboring islands give an admirable description of everything they observed; but they never saw any people clothed, nor any ship like ours. (Colon 1978: 8–9, emphasis mine)\n\nThis fact was confirmed by Fray Ramón Pané in his Relación acerca de las antigüedades de los indios (circa 1498) when he writes that the main cacique in the island of Hispaniola had foretold the dominion of the natives there by foreigners fully clothed: “And they say this cacique affirmed he had spoken with Yucahuguamá, who had told him that those who remained alive after his death would enjoy their dominion for but a brief time because a clothed people would come to their land who would overcome them and kill them, and they would die of hunger” (Pané 1498/1999: 31).6 Early narratives of the encounter showed how nakedness became an immediate tool to articulate difference. 19\n\nUnraveling History\n\nNatives as well as Spaniards recognized visually what set them apart: the lack of or presence of clothing. Early illustrations of the encounter published between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries reiterated that fact very clearly. For Europeans, this lack became a social parameter that justified the power to change the other. Nakedness as a trope of barbarism suffered a twist in 1542 when Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in his book Naufragios presented the Spaniard in a state of nakedness. However, what he considered part of the common nature of the indigenous groups: “All this people of this land go about naked” (Núñez Cabeza de Vaca 1542/1999: 117), became for the Spaniards an accidental result of the shipwreck: “and since we were naked and the cold was very great . . . Those of us who escaped [were] naked as the day we were born and [we had] lost everything we carried with us” (Núñez Cabeza de Vaca 1542/1999: 97, 99). Extreme weather did not seem to affect the rustic nature of the native but it did have traumatic consequences for the civilized/clothed men for whom nakedness was not the norm. Compassion underlies the scenes in which Alvar Núñez highlighted the pain and suffering of their vulnerable bodies, which was so visibly apparent even to the indigenous people: “And with the great grief and pity they felt on seeing us in such a state, they all began to weep loudly and so sincerely, that they could be heard a great distance away” (Núñez Cabeza de Vaca 1542/1999: 101). Spaniards unaware of Alvar Núñez’s disastrous expedition were unable to recognize their civilized fellow countryman, “who experienced great shock upon seeing me so strangely dressed . . . They remained looking at me a long time, so astonished that they neither spoke to me nor managed to ask me anything” (Núñez Cabeza de Vaca 1542/1999: 245). An internalized Western assumption of “nakedness as symbol of barbarism” became, in this passage, an equivocal sign of identification. At this instant, Cabeza de Vaca had become an “Other”. Clothing as a sign of civilization would lose its meaning in the eyes of the Amerindians who associated the fully clothed Spaniards with barbaric acts of violence. In this respect Núñez Cabeza de Vaca comments, “. . . saying that the Christians were lying, because we came from where the sun rose, and they from where it set; and that we cured the sick, and they killed those who were well; and that we came naked and barefoot, and they went about dressed and on horses and with lances” (Núñez Cabeza de Vaca 1542/1999: 249, 251; emphasis mine). The above passages show the ambivalent and dynamic nature of the ideology of clothing and nakedness. As instruments of knowledge about others, they depended upon the cultural context in which they were manipulated. In the case of Cabeza de Vaca’s persona, both “misrecognitions” functioned discursively as mechanisms to stress Alvar Núñez’s suffering, exceptional survival skills, and his lack of uncivilized behavior. Nakedness made the European extra superior while leaving the natives in a fixed state of primitivism. Bernal Díaz del Castillo, in his Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España (1568), discusses a similar passage to the one described by Núñez\n\n20\n\nVisualizing Difference\n\nCabeza de Vaca. Bernal narrates the story of two Spaniards, Jerónimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero, who were captured by indigenous tribes and turned into slaves. When found by Spaniards again their physical transformation was outstanding due to an altered physical appearance. Guerrero was so aware of the transformation that, when Hernán Cortés offered to rescue him, he said to his newly freed companion Aguilar, “You go, and God be with you, but I have my face tattooed and my ears pierced, what would the Spaniards say should they see me in this guise?” (Díaz del Castillo 1568/1969: 43, emphasis mine). Fear of rejection by his countrymen forced Guerrero to make a decision to stay with his new Indian wife. Guerrero was very well aware of how physical transformation could visually bring rejection. “Seeing” and “being seen,” as Homi Bhabha (1994: 76) reminds us, became in colonial discourse crucial elements in the process of subjectification of others. Guerrero’s friend Aguilar, on the other hand, decided to return with the Spaniards. In that first encounter, Aguilar realized how physical appearance was so embedded in the Spanish mentality about the Other. When they saw him they could not recognize Aguilar as one of their own due to his physical transformation: “because Aguilar was nothing other than an Indian.” He was finally recognized when he pronounced the following words: “God and Saint Mary and Seville” (Díaz del Castillo 1568/1969: 69). After cultural recognition, clothing worked as a material tool to reinscribe their own “Other” to his former state of civilization: “Cortés at once ordered him to be given a shirt and doublet and drawers and a cape and sandals, for he had no other clothes, and asked him about himself and what his name was and when he came to this country” (Díaz del Castillo 1568/1969: 45, emphasis mine). Clothing as a tool of reinstatement was crucial in the ordering and visual recognition in the European civilized world. The visualization of nakedness and clothing as ordering markers of civilization is also seen in the work of the mestizo writer Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, Comentarios reales (1609). In Chapter VIII, Book One, he introduces the episode of Pedro el Serrano, a Spaniard who ended up shipwrecked on a deserted island and suffered all kind of adversities. Vega mentions that, after two months, Serrano “saw himself naked as when he was born, and due to the amount of rain, heat and humidity in the region, the few clothes he possesed became rotten. The sun, with its great heat, tired him a lot, because he had neither clothes nor shade to protect him” (Vega 1609/1984: 19, emphasis mine). His physical transformation as a result of the harshness of the weather made him look like a wild boar, his skin all covered with hair. After three years, another Spaniard landed on the island and found Pedro Serrano. The mutual lack of recognition left them in a state of shock: “When they saw each other, it was difficult to determine who was in greater shock. Serrano thought that the other man was the devil disguised as a man, who had come to tempt him in some desperation. The guest understood that Serrano was the devil himself.” Both started fleeing from each other out of fear and in the process Serrano screamed: “Jesus, Jesus,\n\n21\n\nUnraveling History\n\ndeliver me, oh Lord, from the devil!” (Vega 1609/1984: 19–20). The other man finally recognized Serrano as a Christian and convinced him that he was a Christian too. This passage underscores how nakedness and also clothing could potentially become visual misleading tools when categorizing others. Appearance carried within itself deceptiveness inasmuch as clothing as well as nakedness functioned as ambiguous visual artifacts to judge difference. Nakedness as a manipulative tool of differentiation became evident when Serrano returned to Europe. He decided to travel from Spain to Germany in the same physical state that he found himself on the island: almost naked. He saw the opportunity to financially benefit from this: “for this to be proof of his shipwreck” and “to earn a lot of money” (1984: 20). Lack of clothing was seen as an opportunity to make money and not necessarily as a negative aspect of differentiation. Although lack of clothing was still considered the abnormal, when seen in the European body it became a symbol of admiration and superiority. Even the Royal Majesty was impressed and convinced: “. . . and the Royal Majesty having heard and seen [Pedro Serrano], awarded him four thousand pesos of income” (Vega 1609/1984: 20). Through nakedness, Serrano was able to demonstrate his physical ability to survive in a hostile environment; an act that enabled him to gain respect from his fellow “civilized” men. Some European authors seemed to disregard how important clothing was within the native societies they encountered. Clothing, for some indigenous societies in Peru and Mexico, was also considered a sign of distinction. In certain native societies clothing was used as an important complement to cultural practices such as celebrations. Pedro Cieza de León in La crónica del Perú (1540–50) recalls one Andean celebration ‘. . . [the Indians] went to the square, where, in different areas, blankets similar to tapestries had been thrown upon the ground for the caciques and persons of rank and authority to sit. These men were very well adorned and dressed with their best clothes” (Cieza de Léon 1540–50/2000: 375). For the indigenous nobility, clothing served as a tool to state visually a cultural affiliation as well as social status. Cieza was in awe when he commented on the luxurious clothes worn by the Inca rulers: The clothes of these Incas consisted of short shirts with wide sleeves, extremely adorned with bright embroidery made of gold, while others [shirts] had emeralds and precious stones . . . In order to make these clothes, [the Indians] had and still have perfect colors such as crimson, blue, yellow, black and other sorts, which are really superior to the ones in Spain. (Cieza de Léon 1540–50/2000: 370)\n\nGarcilaso de la Vega devoted passages to emphasize the importance of clothes in Andean societies. Clothing according to him, was the second most important tax that Inca subalterns paid to the Inca: “In addition to the first tribute which consisted of sowing and harvesting the Sun’s lands as well as those of the Inca, the Indians offered another tribute, which was to furnish the clothes, shoes, and weapons for the army as well as for needy people” (Vega 1609/1984: 176). How clothes were made, what kind of fabric was used for a specific social status 22\n\nVisualizing Difference\n\nand who was chosen to make them, offered evidence on how in Inca society clothes represented a symbol of distinction and social class. The Amerindian writer Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala in his Nueva Coronica y Buen Gobierno (1615) explains in detail how the lineages of the Inca rulers were expressed in their attire. He describes the type of adornments, weapons, fabric, colors and accessories that the Incas chose to mark their lineages. The pictures he included in his chronicle reiterated visually the importance of clothing as a sign of distinction. In these illustrations one can notice easily the differences between the second and the fourth Inca rulers just by the manner in which they wore the mantle, the type of shield (rodela) and the style of shirt (camiseta). Colors worn by them also corroborated their difference. The second Inca Sinche Roca “wore a red llauto (Indian head-dress) decorated with feathers as a sunshade, and his shirt was pink” (Guaman Poma de Ayala 1615/1993: 71), while the fourth Inca had “his coat of arms and sallet (uma chuco) were dark blue (yanas pacra) . . . His mantle was red, and his shirt was blue in the top, and was decorated with three stripes of adornment (tocapo) in the middle, and the ornament (caxane) of the lower part was white and green” (Guaman Poma de Ayala 1615/1993: 79). As Guaman Poma de Ayala illustrates, the Incas had their own sophisticated system of social classification based on their style of dress. Clothing worked in their society as visual reminders of power and civilization.8 Vega also made clear how even within Inca society, lack of clothing was interpreted as a sign of barbarism. Referring to the pre-Inca society, he explains: “The Indians of that first age dressed like animals, because the only clothes they had was what nature gave them: their own skin” (Vega 1609/1984: 26). Vega reiterates that in that barbaric period “the Indians are so uncivilized that they do not want to get dressed” (Vega 1609/1984: 26). He views the lack of clothing as one of the main elements that distinguished the barbaric pre-Inca Andean society versus the civilized “clothed” Inca culture. For European societies and highly developed Amerindians societies, clothing was not only a social marker but also a tool with which to measure one’s degree of civilization. Andean societies were not the only ones for whom clothing played an important role in the establishment of distinction. Patricia Anawalt reminds us that in Aztec society, indigenous nobility assigned the kind of clothes that each social group was allowed to wear according to their social status (Anawalt 1981: 27). Fabrics such as cotton were designated only for the noble class whereas fabric made of maguey or yucca was intended for the lower class. Aztec nobility strictly controlled what an individual was allowed to wear including color, accessories, and number of feathers. On this issue Hernán Cortés recalled in his “Segunda Carta de Relación” (1520): “In addition to this Mutezuma gave me many garments belonging to himself which, considering that they were woven of cotton without any admixture of silk, could not, I think, be matched in all the world” (Cortés 1520/1962: 85). He also noted that the presence of certain clothes made clear the distinction between Montezuma and others. In his famous encounter with the Aztec ruler, Cortés commented on the visual 23\n\nUnraveling History\n\nappearance of Montezuma and his companions: “All three were dressed in similar fashion except that Mutezuma wore shoes whereas the others were barefoot” (Cortés 1520/1962: 69). Again, lack or presence of certain clothing items served as signs of distinction for both societies. Bernal Díaz del Castillo recognized this when he commented in more detail on Montezuma’s appearance: “The Great Montezuma was richly attired according to his usage, and he was shod with sandals, the soles were of gold and the upper part adorned with precious stones” (Díaz del Castillo 1568/1969: 193). Both authors seem to have valued Montezuma because of the clothing commodities that the Aztec ruler wore. He is recognized as “different” by the Spaniards solely on the fact that Montezuma had more valuable clothes. The written and visual accounts of the authors discussed above illustrate the importance of clothing as a symbolic visual item that denoted distinction and connoted civilization. Lack of clothing was associated with barbarism and served as a rhetorical device to justify power over others. Clothing and nakedness as signs of difference constituted exemplary discursive strategies to judge others visually and to impose fixed identities that would fit within specific political agendas. However, what happened in the eighteenth century when lack of clothing did not seem to be an issue? What role did the rhetoric of clothing play in the process of identity constructions? What role did race, gender, and social class play in the interpretation of dressing habits? In the second part of this chapter I would like to examine the cultural implications of adapting and transforming clothing as a social marker of categorization. I will also discuss how dressing habits for members of the marginalized sectors of the society became destabilizing practices that blurred the social classifications imposed by the colonial order.\n\nThe Culture of Excesses: The Symbolic Appropriation of Clothes In colonial Spanish America, the eighteenth century was a period of profound transformations that affected all sectors of society. Miscegenation had produced a multiracial society that was constantly under the surveillance of colonial authorities. Racial groups were being categorized not only by color but also by their dressing habits, hairstyle, social behavior, cultural practices and eating habits. Social mobility was always a concern for a colonial system that was obsessed with social hierarchies. In a time when color had become an equivocal and misleading sign of differentiation, colonial authorities struggled to legally establish transparent practices of differentiation. Dressing habits played a vital role in the desire by all sectors of the society to distinguish themselves from the others. Clothing was used not only by the Spanish and Creole aristocracy to visually state their social power and distinction over the rest but it was also used by lower sectors of the society to gain 24\n\nVisualizing Difference\n\nsocial access to places that were prohibited to them. This practice was very common in the urban centers of the Viceroyalties such as Mexico and Lima. Jean Descola (1968: 127) observed that during the eighteenth century, people were judged and valued by the luxury of their clothes.9 Clothing in the late colonial period constituted a symbol of social status and it was used as a determinant visual factor to ascertain who was who in society. The value of what a woman could contribute in her dowry was also determined by the kind of fabric, dresses and jewelry that she owned. These items were used by their husbands as if future objects of investment. The quality of fabric, their places of origin and the color, were important factors in determining how much money a woman had and to what social class she belonged.10 But clothing as Daniel Roche (1994: 186) suggests, was not only “a way of demonstrating rank and acquiring prestige,” for it could also be considered an “essential element in the representations and the realities of a system.” Sumptuary laws enacted by the Crown in the eighteenth century are a perfect example of the importance that dressing habits had in the daily lives of people in the colonies. The Royal decrees aimed to establish racial and social divisions legally by controlling and imposing the use of certain clothes throughout their domains. A Real Pragmática enacted in 1716 clearly stated the type of fabric that lower sectors of the population such as mestizos, mulattos, blacks and other casta groups were allowed to use. Individuals such as blacksmiths, tanners, esparto workers, those who work in the spice business, and other people that have similar or even worse jobs, as well as unskilled workers, farm workers and day laborers, are not allowed to wear clothes made of silk, or any other fabric mixed with silk. They are only allowed to wear or bring clothes made of wool, linen or cotton. (Konetzke 1962: 130)11\n\nVisual items of clothing became indicators of the social status of colonial individuals. “Seeing” as a way of “interpreting” (Mirzoeff 1999: 13) was to become intrinsically related to the act of classifying and containing the other. Other royal decrees intended to limit the racial transformation under way in the late colonial period. In 1725, the Viceroy of Peru imposed a royal decree that aimed to control “the outrageous excess of the clothes worn by blacks, mulattos, Indians and mestizos of both sexes” (Konetzke 1962: 187). According to the Viceroy, it was crucial to stop these sectors of the population from dressing in such a manner due to “the frequent thefts committed in order to be able to afford such expensive attires” (Konetzke 1962: 187). Controlling the type of clothes that lower sectors of the society could wear was a way to make visually clear the racial and social distinctions necessary in a profoundly hierarchical society. The control of dressing habits was important because for colonial authorities of the time, color was not a clear factor of distinction. For example, when the skin of a mestizo woman looked lighter or about the same color as that of Spanish woman, it was difficult for the authorities to deny access to racially 25\n\nUnraveling History\n\nmarginalized women (and men) to spaces that were reserved for whites. If one studies the depiction of a Spaniard woman and the picture of a mestizo woman (both shown in Figure 1.2), it is very difficult to differentiate them racially as both are depicted with similar skin tones. What finally determined their racial and social status was the type of dress, hairstyle and jewelry they wore. The wealth of the Spanish woman was expressed with the luxury of her fabric, the detail in her embroidery, and the presence of jewelry and many accessories in her hair. If women from different racial groups, but similar skin color, dressed in similar fashion, as happened in colonial Latin America, the authorities were unable to judge according to visual appearance. Furthermore, a mestiza or a mulata could end up enjoying rights that were the exclusive domain of white women, a dangerous factor that could threaten the colonial order. El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes (1775–76) offers us an interesting anecdote that illustrates how pervasive was the association between clothing and social status in the mentality of some sectors of the society. In chapter IV, the narrator who journeyed from Buenos Aires to Lima comments on the good taste of the women from Córdoba when it came to dressing. He emphasizes that for these women, clothing was considered an important fact in their lives. As an example, he mentions the case of a mulatto woman who despite many warnings from the Creole women in town, insisted in exhibiting herself in a “very embellished” fashion (Carrió de la Vandera 1980: 113). She was told several times to dress according to her racial and social status (calidad).12 One day, one of the cordobesas asked the mulata to stop by her house. Once inside and in the presence of other Creole women, the cordobesa gave the following order to the servants: “to take the mulatto woman’s clothes off of her, to whip her, to burn her expensive attire while she watched and then to dress her with clothes appropriate for her birth status” (1980: 113, emphasis mine). The mulatto woman was violently stripped from her clothes and physically punished as a reminder of her social status. In such acts one can observe how clothing in colonial society was considered a threatening element, especially when it enabled women from lower sectors of the society to look like their superiors in the caste system. To restore the “correct” social status, the cordobesa made the mulata wear clothing that was considered to be appropriate for her race. In this passage race becomes an unstable instrument of categorization and a sign of fear. Racial categories ended up constantly threatened by the manipulation of what to wear. Race as “an organizing principle” and a way of “interpreting the world” (Winant 1994: 2) was challenged by the manipulation of those for whom racial categories of exclusion had been created. The mulatto woman understood the symbolic meaning of clothing as a sign of distinction, and although her transgression was finally suppressed by the cordobesas, it did not change the fact that racial categories represented malleable constructions that were usually contested. Colonial authorities were very aware of that when they enacted laws that aimed to control dressing habits:\n\n26\n\nVisualizing Difference\n\nFigure 2.1. On the left: Spanish woman with mantle.

And because the observance of what is included in this Pragmática aims to maintain a good public government in our kingdoms, a government which could find itself disturbed by a multiplicity of jurisdictions, with punishments decided and executed not by the hands of the Justicias Ordinarias (Ordinary Justice) alone, we grant them [the Ordinary Justice] with exclusive jurisdiction to inquire about specific cases that merit punishment, and to execute the penalties committed. The punishments against transgressors are to be executed inviolably. (Konetzke 1962: 133)\n\nClothing was not only a visual parameter with which to categorize race; it also played a crucial role in discourses that attempted to control women’s mobility within the public space. Male authorities engaged in a criticism of women as an excessive consumer of clothes made connections between the use of luxurious clothes and women’s visibility outside the domestic space. This criticism was not evidence only in literary texts but also in colonial legislation. The decree pronounced in 1716 “Contra el abuso de trages y gastos superfluos” (“Against the abuse of superfluous dresses and expenses”) offers solid evidence of the anxiety that colonial authorities felt towards women’s control over their own bodies when deciding what to wear and how much to spend for it. The problem for the authorities relied also in the excessive public display of luxurious accessories and the material of the dresses, especially when they were made 27\n\nUnraveling History\n\nwith fabrics not bought from Spain and its dominions. Referring to people who attended and participated in the comedias in the Viceroyalty of New Spain the Crown stated: . . . and only black and colored silk dresses without embroideries and decorative trimmings will only be permitted, and only if they come from our own Kingdoms’ factories,13 its dominions or our friendly provinces, and we will give as a deadline the day of the celebration of Corpus Christi . . . to wear these types of dresses that are already currently worn and that exceed the regulations that are given now, with the declaration that this regulation has to be made clear and also inviolably executed starting the same day of Corpus Christi. (Konetzke 1962: 127)\n\nClothing in colonial legislation served as a mechanism of control that assured Spain’s monopoly over the textiles trade. According to authorities, colonial citizens, especially women, had become active consumers of goods such as textiles. For legal authorities, the quality and value displayed in the fabrics were dangerous reminders of the impact of illegal foreign trade in the colonies.14 The visual display of what was not considered part of Spain’s economic hegemony was viewed as a transgression against the colonial order: it was deemed “excessive.” Regulating the public display of what to wear constituted a desperate mechanism of social control for a society that had started to distinguish itself by its own sense of fashion and consumption. The negative repercussions of the excessive display of clothing can also be noted in the letter addressed to the Academic Society of the Lovers of the Country published in the newspaper Mercurio Peruano in 1791, entitled “Carta escrita a la Sociedad sobre los gastos excesivos de una Tapada” (“Letter written to the Society about the excessive expenses of a Tapada”). The letter came from an overwhelmed husband who has found himself in a precarious economic situation due to his wife’s excessive expenses. He complained how, because of his beautiful wife’s fashion taste, he was almost broke. He also protested her insistence and strong desire to attend every public and social event in town, and her need to have a different dress for each occasion. Her exquisite fashion taste had gained the admiration of all of those who attended the same social events. In the process, however, the husband had found himself unable to pay his debts. There were two elements of his wife’s behavior that concerned him: the fact that she demanded to attend every social event in town, and second, her strong belief that a different dress was needed. The husband commented that expenses just in shoes and food surpassed his income of one thousand pesos a year. When it came to dresses, the situation was worse. She demanded “four summer short skirts, and at least two winter ones, because of this we have one thousand fights (that causes her to kick up a fuss), for according to her, the skirt that worked for one social event is not to be used again for the near future. With what money is all this going to be paid?” (Mercurio Peruano 1964: 113). Her obsession with good appearances and quality of clothes was also emphasized in the 28\n\nVisualizing Difference\n\nhusband’s complaints: “And finally, from where am I going to obtain the money to pay for the services of the Silversmith, who renews all the fashion, and the Tailor, who invents it, and the Merchant who sells on credit to my Wife the lace, the satin, the fetlock, and the lamé?” (Mercurio Peruano 1964: 133–4). Acknowledging a situation beyond his control, the husband concluded his letter by asking for help and expressing fear of the consequences should his wife figure out what he had done: “I beg you to help me with great discretion because she is very clever and acute, and if she finds out that I have written this letter there will be hell to pay as she often says” (Mercurio Peruano 1964: 114). The above letter offers a good depiction of the symbolic implications clothing had for certain women and men in the late colonial period. For the wife, clothing had become a vehicle to express social freedom by making her visible in a society in which “looks” had become a measure for social status and prestige. The opportunity to acquire a new dress enabled her to attend as many public events as she wanted transgressing the traditional role bestowed upon her as a mother and wife circumscribed to the domestic space. Also, through the act of ordering and buying clothes, she exercised power and became an integral part of a local economy that existed because of women’s desire to dress well. The business of the silversmith, merchant and tailor depended exclusively on clients like her who were willing to buy a lot and often. For the husband, on the other hand, clothing represented a dangerous and disruptive factor in his responsibility of “governing” and “managing” the household. He was unable to control her “excesses” that consequently affected his ability to provide and pay others. His social status and reputation was being damaged by her obsession with being well dressed publicly at all times. However, what it seems more bothersome to him was his failure and inability to control her, stating how afraid he was of the possibility of his wife finding out that he had written such letter. Excessiveness in dressing habits had become in the eighteenth century a powerful tool of self-expression, especially for marginalized sectors of the society that were trying to gain visual and social recognition in a male and racially dominated world.\n\nFinal Remarks: Clothing as a Visual System of Representation The colonial texts that I analyze in this essay offer us the opportunity to understand the role of clothing in the process of identity construction in colonial Spanish America. In the early colonial period, the lack versus the presence of clothing became dominant factors in the categorization of the self and the other. It contributed to the establishment of ethnic and racial categories centered on ideas of power, control and domination. Clothing constituted a visual tool to establish differences and to justify superiority over other cultures. Visuality as a “system of representation” (Sturken and Cartwright 2002: 12),15 played a 29\n\nUnraveling History\n\ncentral role in the desire to know other cultures. In this dynamic process of creating an image of others through the act of looking, clothing became the quintessential paradigm of ethnic, racial and cultural distinction. In the eighteenth century, however, colonial society had assimilated well the importance of clothing as a symbolic mark of distinction. Clothing was seen as an avenue of self-expression and was manipulated by marginal sectors of the society such as mestizos, blacks, mulattos, and women who wanted to find a space of their own in a society governed by the categories of race, gender and birthplace. The problem for colonial authorities consisted now not on the lack of, but on the obsession with clothes. Sumptuary laws like those discussed before offered a glimpse of the relevant role that clothing was playing in the process of social control and categorization. Regulations regarding what to wear, how to wear it, who was allowed to dress in certain manner and use of a certain fabric, represented crucial mechanisms of control. Clothing as a dynamic process of self-expression was evident in all sectors of the colonial society. Social acceptance through clothing became a tangible possibility of mobility in a highly hierarchical colonial world. If clothing served as a clear indicator of superiority between European and Amerindian societies, now in the late colonial period it had become an ambivalent indicator of superiority. Racially subordinated subjects manipulated clothing to achieve recognition and in the process, they managed to blur racial and social categorizations that had seemed so transparent in the early colonial period. Clothing complicated the visual process of recognition of the other. Those who were supposed to be different were becoming almost the same. Within this context, clothing would become an obsession. Creoles and Spaniards added more luxurious fabrics and accessories to their styles in order to defeat attempts by marginal sectors of the society that – attempting to ascend socially and economically – dressed like them. Meanwhile, indigenous groups, mestizos, mulattos, blacks, and other castes continued their attempt to look like those who were more socially, economically, politically, and culturally recognized and accepted. The symbolic appropriation of clothing entailed the crossing of legal boundaries and social categorizations that seemed so transparent at an earlier time. Mechanisms of control such as laws and, on some occasions, physical violence, were to become extreme tools to halt the dangerous and dynamic process of social, gender and racial mobility that was underway in a society in which clothing was seen as a visual expression of recognition and as the possibility for social freedom. Spanish American colonial texts thus clearly demonstrate the dynamic nature of clothing and its impact upon processes of identity construction and differentiation.\n\n30\n\nFashioning Independence\n\n2\n\nFashioning Independence: Gender, Dress and Social Space in Postcolonial Argentina\n\n1\n\nRegina A. Root\n\nThe clothing choices of the fashionable few can have a profound impact on the political discourse of a country. The word coined for an item of clothing or a particular style may resonate in the public conscience as a sign of the times or as a symbol of national identity. In Latin American countries today, many women have found their fashion in the funda, a special purse for the cellular telephone sold in various colors and designs. At the same time it places the wearer within the multinational paradigm of neoliberal capitalism, the funda also remits to the space of the home. Appropriating the vocabulary of the home, the cellular telephone cover becomes a meaning transferred, a term of high fashion that once was used to describe mattress covers. In the late 1990s in the United States, the Zoot-suit experienced a revival along with the nostalgia for the dynamic nightlife of big cities.2 In the 1940s, Zoot-suiters, a term applied to rebellious Chicano males struggling against police brutality and the racism of sailors in Los Angeles, marked their presence in the city by wearing the clothing of their fathers in extra-large sizes. In the nineteenth century, during the regime of Juan Manuel de Rosas, one’s style of dress served to identify different ideologies at a time when the emerging nation’s political panorama was dominated by two tendencies: the Unitarians and the Federals. Governed by an intellectual elite based in Buenos Aires, the Unitarians espoused progressive, liberal and European ideas. The Federals, on the other hand, had the support of the fortunate soldiers, or caudillos, whose wealth had been acquired following the war for independence from Spain and who ruled Argentina’s interior and the lands outside Buenos Aires. Federal authorities, who were in power from 1829 to 1852, issued decrees that legalized a scarlet insignia that ordered and unified all Argentines under the pledge of Federal power, regardless of sex, race or class. The official literature of the period intensified these distinctions, delineating the Federal patriotic subject and 31\n\nUnraveling History\n\nimplicating the Unitarian in a drama of national betrayal. Because Juan Manuel de Rosas had pushed so vehemently for an ordered and more homogenous society, the vocabulary of fashion made it possible to identify the ideology of the wearer. These enforced dress codes thus enabled authors and bystanders to “read” a person or group in the same way that a twenty-first century North American might read the “suits” on Wall Street. A combination of seemingly disparate elements joined into a kind of referential union. In real life, a Federal could be identified, if not out of fervor alone, by his scarlet vests, insignias and hair accessories. Anonymous letters to the editor in newspapers of the period employed patriotic metonyms instead of signatures, alluding to these Federal characteristics, such as elongated sideburns in “Patillas” (“Sideburns”) or “Los Patilludos” (“Sideburned Ones”). Aristocratic Unitarians, on the other hand, showed a predilection for high French fashions and risked their lives while donning U-shaped (for Unitarian) beards or shades of light blue and green. The mere mention of the word celeste (light blue) no longer evoked the colors of the flag for independence but instead remitted to an illegal political position. The usage of metonymical terms that denoted particular styles of uniforms and dress solidified hierarchies that posited Federalists as Argentines and Unitarians as marginalized afrancesados.3 Drawing from the vocabulary of uniform and fashion, postcolonial Argentine literature relied on a series of associations that can only be explained from a sociopolitical context. Metonymical digression, Roman Jakobson (1990: 130) explains, involves culturally based transfers of meaning in the expression of relational concepts that a given “speech community” finds pertinent to its existence and experiences. According to The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics (1993: 783), metonymy is “a figure in which one word is substituted for another on the basis of some material, causal or conceptual relation.” As a rhetorical device, metonymy forces us to unravel the origins of a word in a diachronic fashion, only to arrive at another object or idea that we wish to express.4 Michel Le Guern (1973: 104) argues that metonymy can indicate the points of intersection between the history of civilization and language. He cites an example from French, the word bureau, used to identify a desk or an office. The term, however, was originally a term for the piece of cloth that covered a desk. When the cloth disappeared from fashion, a transfer in meaning occurred and the bureau became the desk itself (Le Guern 1973: 105). In order to capture the cultural and historical context of a metonym, the reader must engage in a study of the subtle transference process and the final shift in language. A metonym, after all, does not disclose the reason for its emergence.5 In this chapter, I will analyze the transference of a uniquely Argentine word, the peinetón, used to describe a comb worn by women in the region. In the process, I hope to demonstrate how an historical study of dress must ground itself in metonymical process – that is, fashion theorists and historians need to address the linguistic registers describing the accessory or garment to elucidate the significance of its production. First created as a term to designate a fashionable\n\n32\n\nFashioning Independence\n\nArgentine style for a tortoiseshell comb worn following the retreat of Spanish colonialism, the peinetón became a symbol for the early nineteenth-century woman who, seeking her independence in postcolonial society, participated with more freedom in the public sphere. In this meditation on nineteenth-century gender politics, we will bring into our discussion the vocabulary of fashion and its subsequent treatment in satirical caricatures and the modern poetry of an emerging Argentine nation. Derived from peine (“comb” in Spanish) and later, the peineta, the peinetón might translate into English as something more elaborate than a “grandiose comb.” Not likely to be found in dictionaries of Spanish, one pronounces the Argentine word as if to underline it and proclaim a statement. The accent on its final syllable demands the listener’s most undivided attention. At the cusp of its popularity, the peinetón would measure up to 3 feet in height and width. The peinetón has often appeared in twentieth century historical and literary works as a mere anecdote, a testimony to an earlier, more distinct Argentine aesthetic. Numerous travelogs feature this art of head dressing, with reactions from foreign visitors ranging from graceful praise to dumbfounded marvel, “the ponderous yet not inelegant comb giving to their little heads a great deal of importance” (British Packet, no. 216: 1). Alcides D’Orvigny likened the combs to large convex fans that followed porteñas, or port-dwelling residents of Buenos Aires, throughout the city. With dramatic tension, Arsène Isabelle equated the peinetón to an elaborat"
