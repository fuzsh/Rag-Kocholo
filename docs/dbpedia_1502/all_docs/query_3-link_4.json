        "text": "On this episode of “JWill’s Thoughts of the Day”: Who are YOU & what is YOUR personal brand? This is something that I think about regularly and it’s always evolving. In a world that places so much value on how others view you, it’s more important to look inward and see how it is that you view yourself first before anyone else can have a say. Find your purpose/mission, develop the narrative, live it, communicate it, socialize it! Dont’t forget to reevaluate and make adjustments as needed👍🏼 Once you develop a strong personal brand, you will never have to worry about what people say when you’re not in the room, you will have already set the narrative for them!💯 By seriously thinking about these things and putting in the WORK, (and let me tell you, it’s not easy) the overall VALUE you will create for yourself will increase!

Think about it. Your logo, website, social media graphics, even the way your physical store is laid out - all of these elements contribute to your brand's visual identity. And just like a well-written story, your design should be intentional, cohesive, and evoke an emotion in your audience. Crafting Your Brand Story Through Design So, how do you go about crafting a compelling brand story through design? Here are a few tips. Listen to today's Podcast, SUBSCRIBE, LIKE & SHARE\n\nSome branding thoughts for your Monday :) The execution of the new Patreon brand feels a bit on-the-nose to me, but I absolutely love the trend of dynamic, variable visual identities. Patreon's new visuals place an emphasis on adaptability and personalization; crafting an intentional, yet uniquely different experience for each of its audience members. Branding \"trends\" come and go, but this is one I hope sticks around. It seems to be a natural evolution of the debranding trend, where brand identities were stripped down to their very basics to allow individuals to project their own experiences onto their favorite brands. But as brands get more minimal, what do they stand for? Variable, dynamic brand identities are an incredible option for brands that mean a lot of different things to different people. This is a trend that makes a lot of logical sense, and I hope it sticks around. https://lnkd.in/eXWrY_u4\n\n🙋♀️ Hands up if you sit down and take considerable time to evaluate brand, packaging or marketing design work that comes back from your designer? Recently, a founder from my Brand Growth Heroes Accelerator Programme reached out to me on Whatsapp for feedback on 3 versions of new label designs. 🎤 Listen to my (hopefully you'll agree helpful) answer by clicking play on the video below! --> Referring back to the objectives set in the brand or packaging design brief is KEY before responding to the designer's work --> This means you need to have: 1. thought through and crafted clear objectives and 2. written a clear brief 😉 --> Care of thought ensures we ask the right people to give us feedback on the work, based on what it aims to achieve. --> Make sure you don't fall into the 'personal preference trap'. Yes personal preference is important, but only once you've ticked the 'does the work deliver against the objectives in the brief' box! --> Also...put yourself in your designer's shoes! If they've spent time crafting the work, then we should spend time evaluating it against what we asked them to deliver. Hands up if you try to rush evaluating brand design work too often? #packaging #branddesign #brandgrowthheroes (In our latest episode of Brand Growth Heroes, Camilla Barnard of Rude Health and I discuss brand and packaging design in detail.
