        "text": "James David “Dave” Stroud, 81, passed away on Monday, June 17, 2024 at Jackson Oak Retirement Community in Lone Oak, Kentucky.\n\nDave was born May 16, 1943 to the late William James Stroud and the late Margie Lee Halterman Stroud Patterson. His grandparents, Bill and Mary Halterman, as well as his Uncle, Charles William “Bud” Halterman, were a huge influence in Dave’s life and were deeply loved by him. Many of his formative years were spent living in Hickman, KY, though he and his parents also lived in Key West, Florida for a time, before returning to Hickman, where Dave graduated from high school.\n\nHis first marriage to Carolyn Barnett Henderson of the Brownsville community in Hickman came in December of 1962. Carolyn brought to the marriage, a young daughter, Cindy Henderson, who was then joined by a brother, Chris Stroud, in 1964.\n\nDave’s first job was as a butcher in the meat department of E.W. James & Sons Supermarket in Hickman, Kentucky. The family then moved to Memphis, TN, where Dave would begin his long and successful career with Sears, Roebuck, & Co. During the course of his career with Sears, Dave and his family would live and work in several different states. After 30+ years with Sears, Dave accepted an early retirement offer. However, shortly thereafter, a general contracting company in charge of renovating existing Sears stores or converting other retail spaces into Sears stores, convinced him to return to the workforce, where he stayed until his permanent retirement a few years later.\n\nWhile working in Puerto Rico, Dave met his second wife, Miriam Galindez. After retirement, they purchased a lakeside home in Donalsonville, GA. Dave and Miriam assumed the responsibility of raising a granddaughter, Dayana, the daughter of one of Miriam’s three adult children. Dave and Miriam were married in 2009, after Dave’s recovery from the first of two strokes.\n\nWhile visiting his sister, Zebreina Patterson of Mayfield, KY, in 2017, Dave suffered his second and most debilitating stroke. This stroke severely limited his use of the left side of his body, which for someone as active as Dave had always been, was a serious blow. Through the use of a scooter, however, he regained some mobility and independence.\n\nIn 2019, less than a year from diagnosis, Miriam passed away from ovarian cancer. Dave’s disability prevented him from remaining alone in their home, so he moved to Paducah, Kentucky in 2020, where his sister could assist with his care. Diagnosed with COPD and Stage 3 kidney disease, Dave’s health began to significantly decline in 2023 and he began hospice care in May of this year. He was able to remain in his apartment at Jackson Oaks Retirement Community until his death on June 17th.\n\nWhile Dave did not attend college, he was extremely intelligent and well-read, constantly seeking to learn new things. He maintained his quick wit, and often somewhat inappropriate sense of humor until the end. He will be missed.\n\nHe is survived by, One son, Dr. Christopher (Marianne) Stroud of Fort Wayne, IN. One daughter, Cindy (Robert) Covington of Hoschton, GA One Sister, Zebreina Patterson of Mayfield, KY. Three step-children from his second marriage. Twelve grandchildren (five from his step-children) Nine great grandchildren. One nephew and four cousins\n\nA family planned mass will be 1 p.m. Saturday June 29, 2024 at St. Thomas Moore Catholic Church in Paducah"
