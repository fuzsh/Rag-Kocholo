        "text": "\"Bridging the process-pattern divide in ecology and evolution\"\n\nDr. James T. Stroud is an evolutionary ecologist that explores the processes responsible for the generation and maintenance of large-scale patterns of biological diversity, primarily using lizards as a model system. Specifically, his research focuses on bridging this process-pattern divide by studying how ecological and microevolutionary processes – those able to be observed and measured in the wild – may underlie macro-scale patterns of diversity through space and time. James is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Washington University in St. Louis, having previously completed his PhD at Florida International University. In 2021, James was named a recipient of the American Society of Naturalist’s Jasper Loftus-Hills Young Investigator Award."
