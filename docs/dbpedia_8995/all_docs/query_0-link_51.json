See the researcher list for a complete list of those researching this family, some of them helped me out in various ways, but I'd like to especially thank Beverly Holderby for data shared on this line.\n\nJesse Stroud was born ca 1760/70 per the 1830 census. I've seen old published genealogies giving his birth as \"1758\" but never with any sources attached. The only records we have for him that indicate his age are the 1790, 1800 and 1830 census. In 1790 he was age 16+, or born before 1774. In 1800 he was age 26-44, or born ca 1755/74. In 1810 and 1820 he was somewhere in Tennessee, and those census records are lost. In 1830 he was in Tennessee and listed as age 60-69, so born ca 1760/70.\n\nJesse Stroud was probably born in Orange County, North Carolina, assuming he was the son of Peter Stroud Sr as most researchers believe. They lived in southern Orange County along the Chatham County border.\n\nJesse Stroud is probably a son of Peter Stroud (Sr) and Naomi ---, but that is not proven. Peter Sr did live a Will, but it was lost with so many other Burke County records during the Civil War. Jesse Stroud was neighbors with Peter Sr and the other Strouds, and it seems very likely that they were father and son, but Ive seen no hard evidence that they were, but circumstantial evidence supports it and there seems no other option. Also, a 1922 letter from Ed Anderson (Grandson of Jesse Stroud) to John G. Stroud (grandson of William Stroud) stated that their grandfathers (Jesse and William) were brothers to Peter Stroud Jr and that all were sons of Peter Stroud Sr. We can only assume that Ed Anderson had personal family knowledge since he was not very far removed from that generation.\n\nJesse Stroud was listed in the book \"North Carolina Revolutionary Solders, Sailors, Patriots\", Volume I as a \"Patriot\", meaning he somehow contributed to the Revolutionary Cause. I don't know what service he rendered, though it was probably financial or material contributions. I have not attempted to locate any Revolutionary War records on him.\n\nJesse Stroud married Naomi --- before ca 1785, presumably in Orange County, North Carolina. She was born ca 1755/74, possibly in Orange County. I don't know her maiden name, though one published source shows that she was a Stroud also, but no supporting documentation was provided. If she was also a Stroud, then she was undoubtedly a cousin to Jesse, but I don't know who her parents were. I personally don't think she was a Stroud, but I have no proof either way. (\"N.C. Revolutionary Soldiers, Sailors, Patriots ... Vol I\" pg 200)\n\nIn the late 1780's, Jesse Stroud and family, along with his parents moved from Orange County to Burke County and settled in the Muddy Creek region (now McDowell County).\n\nJesse Stroud was listed on the 1790 census in Burke County next to his father Peter Stroud and brother Peter Jr.\n\n1790 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1790 Burke Co, NC pg 106 Jesse Stroud 1-3-1-0-0 Analysis: 1 Male(s) 16 and Up (before 1774) Jesse STROUD (1755/74) s/o Peter 3 Male(s) under 16 (1774/1790) John STROUD (1784/85) son Eclesiastes STROUD (1784/85) son Isaac STROUD (1784/90) son 1 Female(s) any age (before 1790) Naomi Stroud (1755/74) wife\n\nJesse Stroud was listed on a 1793 Burke County tax list in Captain John Carson's Company. He was taxed for 321 acres and 1 poll (himself). His father Peter Sr and brother Peter Jr were also listed.\n\nBy 1798, Jesse had moved his family just a little southward, but over the line into Rutherford County where he lived somewhere along the Second Broad River.\n\nOn 15 Jun 1798, Josiah Black of Rutherford sold 258 acres to Jesse Stroud, also of Rutherford. The land was described as adjoining Janes and Withrow. Witnessed by John Huddleston. The deed was signed by Josiah Black, David Porter and Rachel Porter. (Rutherford Co, NC Deed Book 10 page 115).\n\nOn 20 Jun 1798, David Porter sold Jesse Porter 100 acres on the North Side of Second Broad River above Coneways Creek adjoining George Black. Witnesses were John Huddleston and Hugh Black. (Rutherford Co, NC Deed Book 10 page 240).\n\nJesse Stroud was listed on the 1800 census in Rutherford County. Unfortunately this census was alphabetical, so I can't determine who Jesse's neighbors were. An older woman (age 45+, born before 1755) was living with them. This could be Naomi's widowed mother, or some other older relative.\n\n1800 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1800 Rutherford Co, NC pg 144 Jesse Stroud 33010-20011-0-1 Analysis: 1 Male(s) 26-44 (1755-1774) Jesse STROUD (1760/70) s/o Peter 3 Male(s) 10-15 (1784-1790) John STROUD (1784/85) son Echolds STROUD (1784/85) son Isaac STROUD (1784/90) son 3 Male(s) 0-9 (1790-1800) Thomas STROUD (1791) son Peter STROUD (1792) son Jesse STROUD (1794) son 1 Female(s) 45 & up (before 1755) Mother?

This deed was lost with most of the early Burke County records during the Civil War, but the court record survives, showing it was recorded in April 1811 by Robert Morgan, a witness. (From \"Burke Co, NC Deeds Registered 1804-1813\" by Kathy Gunter Sullivan, 1995)\n\nSometime between ca 1806 and 1810, Jesse Stroud moved his family west to Tennessee. In the same time-frame, his wife Naomi died, though whether in NC or TN I can't say. I also can not say where he went in Tennessee. Several of his children appeared in Dickson County, Tennessee by 1816 including a \"Jesse\", which is either him or his son Jesse. Based on the 1820 census, I think it was his son Jesse in Dickson County.\n\nJesse Stroud married Tabitha Hicks between ca 1806 and 1810. I don't know if they married in NC or somewhere in Tennessee. I don't know the proof for her maiden name. She was born ca 1785/86 (per 1850 census) either in North Carolina or Tennessee. The 1850 census record for her lists her birth place as \"Unknown\".\n\nI have a huge blank spot in my documentation for Jesse between ca 1806 and 1830. I can say that he was somewhere in Tennessee during those years, but I can't be more specific.\n\nJesse was not listed anywhere on the 1810 census. He was probably already in Tennessee then, and that census is lost for Tennessee.\n\nI did not find Jesse on the 1820 census either. This census was lost for all of eastern Tennessee, but is still extant for western Tennessee. There was a Jesse Stroud in Dickson County, but he was too young, and I am fairly sure he was Jesse Jr.\n\nJesse Stroud was listed on the 1830 census in Obion County, Tennessee. This is in the extreme north western corner of Tennessee, bordering the Mississippi River and Kentucky. He could not have been there all along, for that area was Indian territory until 1819. Henry County was formed in 1821 and then Obion County was formed in 1823. Jesse was listed there in 1830 \"next\" to son William Stroud, but this list was alphabetical, so I can't really tell if they were neighbors, but they probably were.\n\n1830 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1830 Obion Co, TN pg 164 Jesse Strowd 1110100010000-0211001000000 Analysis: 1 Male(s) 60-69 (1760-1770) Jesse STROUD (1760/70) s/o Peter & Naomi 1 Male(s) 20-29 (1800-1810) Richard STROUD (1810) son 1 Male(s) 10-14 (1815-1820) Howell STROUD (1816) son 1 Male(s) 5-9 (1820-1825) Silas STROUD (1822) son 1 Male(s) 0-4 (1825-1830) James STROUD (1825/26) son 1 Female(s) 40-49 (1780-1790) Tabitha HICKS Stroud (1785/86) wife 1 Female(s) 15-19 (1810-1815) Elizabeth STROUD (1813) daughter 1 Female(s) 10-14 (1815-1820) Deniza STROUD (1818) daughter 2 Female(s) 5-9 (1820-1825) Obedience STROUD (c1823) daughter Margaret Jane STROUD (1824/25) daughter\n\nJesse Stroud made his Will on 24 May 1834 in neighboring Weakley County, Tennessee. I don't know if he moved there temporarily or what (his wife and children were back in Obion after this). His will was very informative. He named a large family including \"wife Tabitha and her six children (viz) Elizabeth, Deniza, Obedience, Margaret, Jane, James & Richard, my two tracts of land in Obion Co, TN on Davidson Creek. He also named \"my son Howell\", and \"my son Silas\", \"having had eleven children by my first wife Naoma, to each one dollar (viz) Echolds, Isaac, Jesse, John, Thomas, Nancy, Rebecca, Polly, Sally, William & Peter.\" The Will was witnessed by Harden S. Adams, Samuel Hall, and Thornton Jones. He signed the will with a mark that looked like an \"R\". Some use this as a middle initial for him, which it could be, or it could just be his mark.\n\nHis will was proven on 17 Jul 1834, so he had died by then.\n\nTabitha, now widowed, was listed as head of household on the 1840 census in Obion County. This census was alphabetical, so I can't tell who her neighbors were.\n\n1840 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1840 Obion Co, TN pg 152 Tabitha Stroud 0210200000000-0201100100000 Analysis: 2 Male(s) 20-29 (1810-1820) Howell STROUD (1815/16) son Silas STROUD (c1822) son 1 Male(s) 10-14 (1825-1830) James STROUD (1825/26) son 2 Male(s) 5-9 (1830-1835) Grandson?

Jesse and second wife Tabitha had eight children together, all named in his Will, for a total of 19 children. For some reason he mentioned Tabitha's \"six children\", and then named sons Silas and Howell separately. This could mean they had a different mother, or he just wanted them to have a different inheritance from the rest. It should be noted that Jesse did not name his children in the Will in their birth order.\n\nJohn Stroud (c1785)\n\nEcclesiastes \"Echolds\" Stroud (c1785)\n\nIsaac Stroud (c1789)\n\nThomas Stroud (1791)\n\nPeter Stroud (c1792)\n\nJesse Stroud (c1794)\n\nRebecca Stroud (c1797)\n\nNancy Stroud (1798)\n\nSarah Stroud (c1801)\n\nMary Stroud (c1803)\n\nWilliam P.

Other researchers have told me that it is John Stroud of Bedford and Williamson Co, TN who was this John Stroud, son of Jesse. I don't know what direct proof there is that this is the right John, but it seems to be the case. Some evidence in favor of this conclusion is that Jesse's son Peter Stroud was also in Bedford at the same time as John, and their brother Thomas also lived there at one time.\n\nAccording to shared research, John Stroud married Rosey Green, but I've not seen any proof (yet) of her given name or maiden name. She was dead before the 1850 census.\n\nJohn was in Bedford Co, TN until the 1830's when he moved to neighboring Williamson County.\n\nSee his own page for additional information.\n\nEcclesiastes \"Echolds\" Stroud\n\nwas born ca 1784/85 in either Orange Co, NC or Burke (now McDowell) County, NC. \"Echolds\" was named in his father's Will of 1834. His name was often listed as \"Eccles\" or \"Accles\" or various other spellings.\n\nEcholds married Mary --- in Burke or Rutherford Co, NC and moved to Tennessee with the rest of his family. He lived in Dickson County for a few years before returning to Burke Co, NC by 1820. He remained in Burke until ca 1838 when he moved to Roane County, Tennessee, and then moved to neighboring Anderson County in the 1840's.\n\nSee his own page for additional information.\n\nIsaac Stroud\n\nwas born ca 1789 (per other researchers) in Burke (now McDowell) County, NC. \"Isaac\" was named in his father's Will of 1834.\n\nI have found very little on Isaac. He was named in his father's Will, so he must have been still living in 1834, though that isn't necessarily the case. He did not appear on any Tennessee census records as far as I can determine. Assuming his \"1789\" birth date is accurate, I can do some census analysis on him.\n\nIn 1790 he was probably home with his parents, listed in the \"under 16\" age group (born 1774/90).\n\nIn 1800 he was probably still home and in the age 10-15 category (born ca 1784/90).\n\nHis father was not found on the 1810 or 1820 census. In 1830 Jesse Stroud had no apparent sons this age with him, so Isaac was on his own (or dead) by that time.\n\nIsaac Stroud would have turned 21 around 1810 and if he married it would have been around the same time.\n\nLawrence Wood (deceased) told me about Elizabeth Ann Stroud (1817 TN) who married Manson Grist and lived in Rabun Co, GA. He said her father was Isaac Stroud and that he died and then his wife married a Mr. Stewart as a second husband. He had no proof of this, but it was either family tradition or something someone told him (or both).\n\nI could never reconcile this story with any Isaac Stroud in that area, but it is entirely possible that this story is referring to this same Isaac, for if his brother Echolds returned to the original home place, Isaac could have as well. I have found a little bit of data that may shed some light on this. Elizabeth A. Stroud was born in Tennessee (county unknown) in 1817. If Isaac was her father, then he married before 1817, and died soon after. Elizabeth married Manson Grist before 1836, and moved to Rabun County, Georgia where they remained. Their oldest child was a daughter named \"Rosanna\". There was a widow Rosanna Stewart (1780/90) who was a neighbor of theirs in 1840. Rosanna Stewart's son William Stewart married one of Manson Grist's siblings (or niece).\n\nThis could be reconciled in this manner (keep in mind this is just a theory, but it fits the available facts). Isaac Stroud, born ca 1789, married Rosanna --- before 1817. She was born ca 1780/90. They married in Tennessee, and lived there a short time. Isaac died shortly after marriage, leaving only one child. Rosanna returned to North Carolina or north Georgia where she married a Mr. Stewart before 1830. Mr. Stewart died before 1840. Rosanna Steward was listed on the 1840 census in Rabun Co, GA. Rosanna either died in the 1840's or remarried or moved away, for I did not find her on the 1850 census.\n\nThe above story would explain everything, though it is far from proven, but I do like it. There were other Isaac Strouds around, but none with NC or TN connections that would make me think they were this same Isaac, son of Jesse. I could have missed something though.\n\nThomas Stroud\n\nwas born ca 1789/90 (per 1850 census) or 27 Aug 1791 (source?) in Burke (now McDowell) County, NC. \"Thomas\" was named in his father's Will of 1834.\n\nThomas married Sarah Virginia Thompson in 1812. They lived in Dickson and Bedford Co, TN and moved to Logan Co, IL in the 1840's.\n\nSee their own page for additional information.\n\nPeter Stroud\n\nwas born ca 1791/92 (per 1850 census) in Burke (now McDowell) County, NC. \"Peter\" was named in his father's Will of 1834.\n\nPeter married Rebecca Green before 1813 in Tennessee. They lived in Bedford Co, TN and moved to Logan Co, IL in the 1830's, and then to Marion County, Iowa in the 1840's.\n\nSee their own page for additional information.\n\nJesse Stroud\n\nwas born ca 1794/1800 (per census analysis) in Burke (now McDowell) County, NC. \"Jesse\" was named in his father's Will of 1834. Other researchers have told me he died in 1830. Perhaps his father didn't know that, or he was named anyway, just so his heirs would get something (this happened often).\n\nJesse married Jane ---, probably in Dickson County, Tennessee. They were there in the 1816, 1820 and 1830.\n\nSee their own page for additional information.\n\nRebecca Stroud\n\nwas born ca 1797 (per other researchers) in either Burke (now McDowell) or Rutherford (now McDowell) Co, NC. \"Rebecca\" was named in her father's Will of 1834.\n\nShe was apparently at home with her parents for the 1800 census (age \"under 10\", born ca 1790/1800). I don't have her parents' 1810 and 1820 census records. She was not with her father in 1830, so probably married or dead by then.\n\nShe was named in her father's Will of 1834 simply as \"Rebecca\". No surname was given, so I don't know who she was married to.\n\nI have found no additional data on Rebecca. A check of the marriage records available to me reveal no Rebecca Stroud marriage, or at least none that could be this same Rebecca.\n\nNancy Stroud\n\nwas born ca 1797/98 (per 1850 census) or 18 Oct 1798 (per Hazel Hayes) in Rutherford (now McDowell) Co, NC. \"Nancy\" was named in her father's Will of 1834.\n\nSpecial thanks to Hazel Hayes and Beverly Holderby for data shared on this family.\n\nShe was apparently at home with her parents for the 1800 census (age \"under 10\", born ca 1790/1800). I don't have her parents' 1810 and 1820 census records. She was not with her father in 1830, so probably married or dead by then.\n\nShe was named in her father's Will of 1834 simply as \"Nancy\". No surname was given.\n\nOther researchers show this Nancy Stroud as having married John Osborne Roberts ca 1813. I don't know what proof there is that John Roberts' wife Nancy was a Stroud, nor what proof she is Jesse's daughter. However, she does fit based on her age. She and John named a son \"Jesse\" and daughter \"Naomi\", so it all fits based on circumstantial evidence. If there is any solid proof, I haven't seen it yet.\n\n** I am attempting to find my source documentation for this family (most of which was shared by other researchers), but can't lay my hands on it at the moment.\n\n** I don't yet have this family on the 1820, 1830 census.\n\nJohn O. Roberts was listed on both the 1836 and 1838 Wayne County, Tennessee tax lists, both times in District 2 and taxed for 100 acres and one white poll (himself) and for 5 acres.\n\n** I don't have him in 1840 yet, but I'm sure he was in Wayne County then.\n\nI do know that John and Nancy were listed on the 1850 census in Wayne County, Tennessee. Two of their married sons were listed close by.\n\n1850 census abstract: (Explanation of this census)\n\n(Note: The dates at the end of each line are not part of the original census, but are approximate birth years based on age)\n\n1850 WAYNE CO, TN Page 259B House/Family # 116/ 119 - 2nd DISTRICT Twp ROBERTS J O 59 M W FARMER 1050 NC 1790/1791 ROBERTS NANCY 52 F W NC 1797/1798 ROBERTS ANDREW 17 M W TN 1832/1833 ROBERTS M 10 F W TN 1839/1840 ROBERTS CARILINE 16 F W TN 1833/1834 ROBERTS JOHN MARS 16 M W TN 1833/1834\n\nThey were still in Wayne for the 1860 census.\n\n1860 census abstract: (Explanation of this census)\n\n(Note: The dates at the end of each line are not part of the original census, but are approximate birth years based on age)\n\n1860 WAYNE CO, TN Page 15 House/Family # 1254/1254 -- CIVIL DISTRICT 2 Twp CARROLSVILLE P.O.

Their names and dates were all shared by other researchers. The 1850 census proves two of them.\n\nSarah Stroud\n\nwas born ca 1801 (per other researchers) in Rutherford (now McDowell) Co, NC. \"Sally\" was named in her father's Will of 1834. \"Sally\" is a common nickname for \"Sarah\".\n\nI don't have her parents' 1810 and 1820 census records. She was not with her father in 1830, so probably married or dead by then.\n\nShe was named in her father's Will of 1834 simply as \"Sally\". No surname was given, so I don't know who she was married to.\n\nI have found no additional data on Sally. A check of the marriage records available to me reveal no likely marriages, for this Sarah / Sally Stroud.\n\nMary Stroud\n\nwas born ca 1803 (per other researchers) in Rutherford (now McDowell) Co, NC. \"Polly\" was named in her father's Will of 1834. \"Polly\" is a common nickname for \"Mary\".\n\nI don't have her parents' 1810 and 1820 census records. She was not with her father in 1830, so probably married or dead by then.\n\nOther researchers have told me that Mary Stroud married Samuel Riley. I have not been able to confirm this just yet.\n\nI have found no additional data on them yet. In 1830 there was a \"Samuel Riley\" in both Warren and Williamson County, Tennessee.\n\nWilliam P. Stroud\n\nwas born ca 1805/06 (per 1850 census) in Rutherford (now McDowell) County, NC. \"William\" was named in his father's Will of 1834.\n\nWilliam married Dianna --- before ca 1828 in Tennessee. They lived in Obion Co, TN and moved to Carroll Co, AR in the 1830's.\n\nSee their own page for additional information.\n\nRichard Stroud\n\nwas born ca 1810 (per other researchers), probably in Tennessee somewhere. \"Richard\" was named in his father's Will of 1834.\n\nI have not found much data concerning Richard Stroud. There was a Richard listed on the 1840 census in Henry County, Tennessee. I don't have this census entry yet. This was fairly close to where his parents lived in Obion County, so this could be this same Richard. More research is needed to be sure.\n\nElizabeth Stroud\n\nwas born ca 1813 (per other researchers) in Tennessee, county unknown. \"Elizabeth\" was named in her father's 1834 Will.\n\nI don't have her parents' 1820 census records.
