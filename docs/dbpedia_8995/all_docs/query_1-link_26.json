        "text": "American professional golfer (born 1982)\n\nChristopher James Stroud (born February 3, 1982) is an American professional golfer who currently plays on the PGA Tour. He finally got his first professional win on August 6, 2017 at the Barracuda Championship after 290 starts on the PGA Tour.\n\nStroud was born in Groves, Texas. He played college golf at Lamar University and was a two-time All-American. As an amateur, he won the 2003 North and South Amateur and played on the 2004 Palmer Cup team.\n\nStroud turned pro in 2004. He played on mini-tours until earning his PGA Tour card at the 2006 (T16), 2007 (3rd), and 2008 (T4) Qualifying schools. He was not able to finish high enough on the money list to retain his card until 2009 when he finished 113th. His best performance in a PGA Tour event during these early years was a tie for fifth at the 2007 Zurich Classic of New Orleans. In 2013, he lost to Ken Duke in a playoff at the Travelers Championship.\n\nOn August 6, 2017, Stroud earned his first PGA Tour victory when he won the Barracuda Championship in a playoff over Greg Owen and Richy Werenski. It was his 290th PGA Tour start and he was playing on conditional status. At the 2017 PGA Championship, Stroud was near the top for the first three rounds before a final round 76 earned him a T9 finish. Prior to his win, Stroud was planning on retiring after the season.\n\n2003 North and South Amateur\n\nNo. Date Tournament Winning score Margin of\n\nvictory Runners-up 1 Aug 6, 2017 Barracuda Championship 44 pts (9-3-12-20=44) Playoff Greg Owen, Richy Werenski\n\nPGA Tour playoff record (1–1)\n\nNo. Year Tournament Opponent(s) Result 1 2013 Travelers Championship Ken Duke Lost to birdie on second extra hole 2 2017 Barracuda Championship Greg Owen, Richy Werenski Won with birdie on second extra hole\n\nOwen eliminated by birdie on first hole\n\nNo. Date Tournament Winning score Margin of\n\nvictory Runner-up 1 Mar 27, 2005 NGA Hooters Tour Auburn Classic −12 (68-70-66=204) 1 stroke Elliot Gealy\n\nTournament 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Masters Tournament U.S. Open CUT CUT CUT T47 The Open Championship CUT PGA Championship CUT CUT T64 T9 T65\n\nTop 10\n\nDid not play\n\nCUT = missed the half-way cut\n\n\"T\" = tied for place\n\nTournament Wins 2nd 3rd Top-5 Top-10 Top-25 Events Cuts made Masters Tournament 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 U.S. Open 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 The Open Championship 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 PGA Championship 0 0 0 0 1 1 5 3 Totals 0 0 0 0 1 1 10 4\n\nMost consecutive cuts made – 3 (2014 PGA – 2018 PGA, current)\n\nLongest streak of top-10s – 1\n\nTournament 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 The Players Championship T10 T12 CUT T33 T80 T42 WD T46\n\nTop 10\n\nDid not play\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut\n\nWD = withdrew\n\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\n\nAmateur\n\nPalmer Cup: 2004\n\n2006 PGA Tour Qualifying School graduates\n\n2007 PGA Tour Qualifying School graduates\n\n2008 PGA Tour Qualifying School graduates"
