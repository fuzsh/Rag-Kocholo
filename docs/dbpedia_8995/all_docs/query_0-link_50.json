They used the Robert Morgan Papers Collection (#0268), available in Joyner Library’s Special Collections, and other sources to form and author unique publications available in The ScholarShip, ECU’s Institutional Repository.

        "text": "Stroud was a senior when he submitted his paper. White was dually enrolled as an ECU first-year student and a junior in the Innovation Early College High School. An awards ceremony also will recognize their efforts.\n\n“Their extensive research used not only the Morgan Papers, but numerous other primary and secondary sources,” library director Jan Lewis said. “They weaved their research into compelling narratives; in one case of Senator Morgan’s first campaign for the U.S. Senate, and in the other case, one of his legislative accomplishments as a senator. Both papers tied his accomplishments to his core value of integrity and to his work as attorney general of North Carolina in the area of consumer protection. I hope that their papers will inspire other students to use the Morgan Collection and apply for this research award.”\n\nMorgan is a 1947 East Carolina Teachers College alum. One of the research award judges was Carroll Leggett, who was chief of staff for Morgan.\n\n“Applause for White for finding a totally unexplored aspect of Senator Morgan’s service for her research project,” Leggett said. “I am amazed. I was there in the midst of things, but have no recollection of Senator Morgan’s involvement in the passage of this anti-dumping legislation. … Her research here was no easy matter. We thank her for this addition to the Robert B. Morgan Collection at Joyner Library.”\n\nLibrary employee Kristen Daniel, instruction and outreach librarian in Special Collections, also was a judge. Daniel said she enjoyed the narrative style used by Stroud, who uses background and research of President Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal to argue that Watergate only played a tangential role in Morgan’s victory."
