        "text": "Center Street Studio is pleased to announce a new suite of four etchings by German-American artist Anna Schuleit Haber. Master printer and publisher James Stroud invited the artist to pursue a print project after seeing a series of drawings she was working on over the course of the past few years. Four motifs chosen from a larger group were newly drawn and etched into copper plates. Printed on Hahnemühle Copperplate paper with hand-colored chine collé sheets painted by the artist in acrylic, each set in the 'edition' of 30 will be unique. The first available set is featured here.\n\nThe price is $6500. for the set of four prints. For more information and availability please contact Director James Stroud: jstroud@centerstreetstudio.com or click the Purchase button below.\n\nfrom the artist:\n\nMy usual studio space has several parts: paintings on the walls, drawings and prints on tables in the middle, paints and inks and dry media and other tools in-between, and books and writings on the fringes. The different parts in my studio help to keep me moving, like stations along a road. Things are in flux, swinging in and out of abstraction. I feel curious and glad in the spaces that open up in that imagined landscape, glad to follow, to find. At the center of it all — not in the center visibly, but rather central to the daily work — lie my drawings. Sometimes drawings are a way of story-making. Sometimes they remain figurative enough to be recognized as something known or remembered. Sometimes they become a form of recording.\n\nIn the printmaking studio the open ways of drawing merge for me with the linear processes of printing. Three of the etchings are of wooden figures that I found while helping to clear an old attic space. The birds, the hinged dog, and the horse emerged from the half-dark with their shapes and characters intact. The fourth etching is of my dog, who belongs with the others, bridging their world of open play with ours. Among the layers of inspiration for this project are also the life stories of toy creator Margarete Steiff and pediatrician Janusz Korczak. The notions of how to be and how to invent — of how to be in one’s inventions, and how to survive through them — are all tied into this series.\n\nAnna Schuleit Haber, September 2023\n\nAnna Schuleit Haber’s work lies at the intersection of painting, drawing, performance and installation art, architecture, and community. She studied painting at the Rhode Island School of Design and was a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies at Harvard. Her works range from museum installations made with paint, to large-scale projects in forests, on uninhabited islands, and in psychiatric institutions, using extensive sound systems, live sod, thousands of flowers, mirrors, antique telephones, bodies of water, and neuroscience technologies. She was named a MacArthur Fellow for a body of work that has “conceptual clarity, compassion, and beauty.\" Her works on paper and paintings are included in private collections throughout the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia, as well as in the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam.\n\nCenter Street Studio is pleased to announce its first print publication of 2023. This is Bill Thompson's first print with CSS since 2015!\n\nFrom the artist:\n\n‘As a sculptor, I tend to view everything in terms of volume and form. With two-dimensional work, I look for a way to address the physicality of the paper itself or graphically convey volume and form. For our latest etching, I wanted to revisit the vessel form of an earlier print, Relaxed Standard. Because a vessel generally holds liquid and as a nod to the printmaking medium, it was logical to imagine it filled with black ink. The title worked because of the wordplay—an implied directive to the printer—and as an echo of my youth growing up in a house full of antiques.\n\nAfter the vessel plate was created, we experimented with various ways to incorporate texture into the negative space. Initially, we considered filling the background with a scan of a vintage yellowed newspaper; but I decided that it would be more conceptually accurate if the words had been generated by a quill pen. In my family’s trove of genealogical documents, I found two books containing sermons handwritten in the mid-1800’s by my great-great-grandfather, a Presbyterian minister. We scanned and doubled them up to create a denser background texture—one in which the words were still somewhat legible but not distractingly so. My mother, especially, would have been thrilled by this ancestral collaboration and rather amused that her secular son had finally embraced words delivered from a church lectern!’\n\n- Bill Thompson, January 2023"
