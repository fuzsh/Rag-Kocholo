        "text": "North County Battalion goalkeeper James Stroud has been selected as the eighth Mitre National Player of the Week for the 2016 NPSL season.\n\nStroud registered 12 saves in a 0-0 road draw with Albion SC Pros in the “San Diego Derby.”\n\n“Over the last several weeks we have seen James come up big for the team on several occasions,” North County Battalion head coach Ryan Guy commented. “What those who don’t know him have not seen is the incredible work, both on and off the pitch, that he has been doing to get himself to this point. Continuing his current form is his singular goal and his teammates are similarly motivated by that drive and desire.”\n\nA long-time Southern California resident, Stroud was born in Philadelphia and moved with his family when he was in middle school. He is a 2009 graduate of Torrey Pines High School and was also a member of several competitive club teams including LA Galaxy Academy, San Diego Surf, and Albion. In 2008, he was named to the USSF Academy Southwest Conference Best XI.\n\nFollowing graduation from high school, Stroud attended CSU Chico where he played for five seasons. During his time with Wildcats, he led the CCAA conference in goals against average, save percentage, and shutouts per game.\n\nFor the past two seasons, Stroud played in the NPSL as a member of the San Diego Flash. An instrumental part of the team’s success last year, he led the Southwest Conference in goals against average and shutouts per game. This is his first season with the Battalion.\n\nStroud has been impressive with North County in 2016, accumulating four starts and over 360 minutes of play. He currently has a 1.50 goals against average, 26 saves, and one shutout this season.\n\n“I’m very excited to have been named the Mitre National Player of the Week for my performance during our match at Albion,” Stroud added. “I’ve worked hard to come back from a major injury so it feels great, but my #1 priority is being there for my teammates and I’m just happy I was able to do so on Saturday and have a performance worthy of this recognition. All my teammates left their hearts and souls on the field on Saturday and we came away with a result we were proud of, but we know there’s more work to be done. We’re going to end the season strong and plan to show up big for the playoffs representing San Diego soccer at the highest level.”\n\nThe Mitre National Player of the Week is announced every Friday during the regular season. The winner of this national honor is determined by a vote of media members from across the country.\n\nABOUT THE NPSL\n\nThe NPSL is a national league that operates in the 4th Division of the U.S. Soccer pyramid. NPSL teams are eligible to participate in the U.S. Open Cup through their affiliation with the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) and the United States Adult Soccer Association (USASA).
