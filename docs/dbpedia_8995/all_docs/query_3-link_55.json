        "text": "For fifteen years, James Stroud has been generously supporting young guitarists in Ohio through his namesake guitar competition. It started as a University of Akron event (he completed his MM in Guitar Performance there in 1985), but migrated to Oberlin five years ago and became an All-Ohio event. The prizes, totaling $7,500, are larger than the prizes at most American guitar competitions, and the Ohio-only restriction gives students in the state a terrific and unique opportunity to find success. As host and producer, I coordinate the facility and publicity, hire the guest artists/judges, and of course, encourage my students to participate. I never judge.\n\nThis post is a photographic tour of our Stroud Competition weekend.\n\nThis year, we had as our guests the Rucco-James Duo. The Italian guitarist, Pasquale Rucco and American guitarist Douglas James specialize in 19th century music, and use period instruments (or copies) on stage. They played a program featuring music of Giuliani, L’Hoyer, Diabelli and others. (The complete program is at the end of the post).\n\nTheir gorgeous instruments were a decorative counterpoint to their elegant and spirited interpretations.\n\nIn the late afternoon, I gave a solo recital in Kulas Recital Hall featuring my original works, Islamorada Suite, A Musical Congeries, and Suite Blue. (Complete program at end of post).\n\nThe finals, held in Kulas Recital Hall, took place that night. The finalists were (in alphabetical order) Julia Bodian (Oberlin), Mariam Hajialigol (Cleveland Institute), Alejandro Rodriquez (Cleveland Institute) and Craig Slagh (Oberlin). The prizes on offer were: 1st $3,000, 2nd $2000, 3rd $1000 and 4th $500 plus a special audience award of and additional $1,000. The audience were given a slip of paper and a pencil upon entering the hall and asked to pick their own favorites for tallying afterwards.\n\nThe finals were terrific, with a high level of musicianship all around. We heard a wide range of pieces, including works by Dowland and Bach, Regondi and Villa-Lobos, Turina and Morel, Ginastera and Britten and more. The final results were announced afterwards and were as follows:\n\n1st prize: Alejandro Rodriguez ($3,000)\n\n2nd prize: Julia Bodian ($2,000)\n\n3rd Prize: Maryam Hajialigol ($1,000)\n\n4th prize: Craig Slagh ($500)\n\nAudience award: a tie between Julia Bodian and Craig Slagh, who each will get an additional $500\n\nCONGRATULATIONS TO THE FINALISTS!!!!\n\nThank you once again, James Stroud for your extraordinary commitment to helping young classical guitarists. And thanks again to our guests, the Rucco-James Duo. Congratulations to all the young guitarists who stepped forward to compete in this event and to participate in other ways, all meaningful and important. And of course, one more shout-out to our winners, Alejandro Rodriguez, Julia Bodian, Maryam Hajialigol and Craig Slagh!!!\n\nWe look forward to the next edition of this event!"
