        "text": "Paul Jay Stroud Jr., a cherished father, husband, and friend, passed away in Independence, Missouri, on March 31, 2024, at the age of 76.\n\nBorn in Granite City, Illinois, on December 28, 1947 to Paul and Vera Stroud, Paul's life was marked by remarkable courage and dedication. Serving his country with honor, he bravely navigated the challenges of the Vietnam War as a member of the United States Army, embodying the values of courage and commitment throughout his service.\n\nFollowing his military tenure, Paul pursued a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing from the University of Central Florida. This educational foundation propelled him into a successful career as a Sales Manager at ACME Products in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nBeyond his professional achievements, Paul was known for his warm and welcoming demeanor. He possessed a natural ability to connect with others, never failing to make a friend along life's journey. His daughters held a special place in his heart, and he took immense pride in supporting and encouraging them, exemplifying the role of a devoted father with unwavering love.\n\nIn his leisure time, Paul found solace and joy in the embrace of nature. His favorite hobbies included golf, hunting, fishing, and waterskiing. He excelled at all of these pastimes, and was especially proud of recording two hole-in-one’s in his lifetime. Paul’s passion for these activities was infectious. He found fulfillment in sharing his knowledge and enthusiasm, particularly in mentoring those new to hunting.\n\nPaul is survived by his beloved wife and best friend of 47 years, Rebecca \"Becky\" Stroud, his daughters Amanda Stroud Gagnon (Zachary) and Melissa \"Missy\" Stroud-Roberson (Greg), his siblings James Stroud (Cindy Davis) and Susie Stroud Lefils (Greg), as well as many nieces and nephews. He is preceded in death by his parents, Paul Senior and Vera Loemker Stroud, his sister JoAnn Stroud Torrizo, and his brother-in-law David Pegram.\n\nPaul's legacy of courage, kindness, and passion will continue to inspire those who were fortunate enough to know him. He will be dearly missed and fondly remembered by all whose lives he touched."
