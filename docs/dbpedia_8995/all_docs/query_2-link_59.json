Stroud (c1810) and Ann Morgan of Burke and McDowell Co, NC and Van Buren Co, AR\n\nmartygrant.com: Home > Genealogy > Stroud > Families > James\n\n[Commentary] [Children] [Researcher List] [Register Report] [A Note about sources] [How to contact me] [Home]\n\nI (Marty Grant) am a 1st Cousin 6 times removed of James L. Stroud.\n\nSpecial thanks to Pam Stroud and others for data shared on this family.\n\nJames L. Stroud was born ca 1809/10 (per 1850 census). He was born in either Burke (now McDowell) Co, NC in the Muddy Creek area, or possibly in Surry Co, NC where his parents seemed to be living in 1810. I have seen no record showing this James had a middle initial of \"L\", but other researchers have shared that with me. I don't know the source for it, nor what the \"L\" stands for.\n\nJames is a proven son of William and Delilah (---) Stroud. He was named in an 1823 Guardianship record naming the heirs of William Stroud.\n\nHe was apparently home with his parents in 1810 (age \"under 10\", born ca 1800/10), and home in 1820 (age 10-15, born ca 1804/10).\n\nJames Stroud was named in the Jul 1823 Guardianship record as a minor orphan of William Stroud, deceased and Delilah (his mother) was appointed his legal guardian.\n\nHe was apparently home with his widowed mother in 1830 (age 20-29, born ca 1800/10).\n\nIn 1835 Congressional Elections were held and the voter lists survive for Burke County. There were two \"James Stroud\" listings, and one \"J. Stroud\", all in Neals Precinct. One of these was this James, I'm sure.\n\nOn 20 Feb 1840, James Stroud obtained a marriage bond in neighboring Rutherford County to marry Ann Morgan. Abner Morgan (her father) was bondsman. Ann was born ca 1819/20 (per 1850 census) in Rutherford County, daughter of Abner Morgan and Elizabeth Wilkerson.\n\nThey were listed on the 1840 census in Burke County. He was listed as James \"Jr\" to distinguish himself from his older cousin James A. Stroud (1800/04).\n\n1840 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1840 Burke Co, NC pg 346 James Stroud Jr 0000100000000-0000100000000 Analysis: 1 Male(s) 20-29 (1810-1820) James L. STROUD (1810) s/o William 1 Female(s) 20-29 (1810-1820) Ann MORGAN Stroud (1819/20) wife\n\nIn 1842, McDowell County was formed from the section of Burke where the Strouds resided.\n\nOn 4 Oct 1847 James and several siblings deeded some of their inheritance to Edward H. Grant: James Stroud, Peter Stroud, William Stroud, Jesse Stroud, Hicks Stroud and Nancy Stroud, heirs of William Stroud, deceased. Witnesses were Samuel Deal and S. B. Erwin. (McDowell Co, NC Deed Book 1 page 472).\n\nAround 1848 or so, James and his brother Jesse and sister Nancy and their families, along with Matthew Stroud (cousin?) moved from Muddy Creek to Van Buren County, Arkansas.\n\nThey were listed on the 1850 census in Van Buren County in Craig Township. Lucinda Morgan (c1833) was with them. She could be Ann's sister or a niece.\n\n1850 census abstract: (Explanation of this census)\n\n(Note: The dates at the end of each line are not part of the original census, but are approximate birth years based on age)\n\n1850 VAN BUREN CO, AR Page 318 House/Family # 303/ 303 - CRAIG Twp STROUD JAMES 40 M W FARMER NC 1809/1810 STROUD ANNA 30 F W NC 1819/1820 STROUD ABNER 9 M W NC 1840/1841 STROUD WILLIAM 8 M W NC 1841/1842 STROUD JOHN H 5 M W NC 1844/1845 STROUD NANCY J 1 F W AR 1848/1849 MORGAN LUCINDA 17 F W NC 1832/1833\n\nThey were still in Van Buren for the 1860 census, but in Liberty Township.

I have some additional data on them from the census records, and some that was shared by other researchers. I don't have enough data on them to include documented sections on them here.\n\nResearcher List\n\nPersons researching this family :\n\nSee Stroud Researcher List\n\nRegister Report"
