        "text": "James Stroud is a contestant from ​Survivor: Pulau Tiga.\n\nProfile[]\n\nRetrieved from itv-survivor.co.uk\n\nName: James\n\nAge: 40\n\nFrom: London\n\nMarital Status: Married\n\nOccupation: Property Developer\n\nLuxury Item: Mirror (for contact lenses)\n\nThe Old Etonian property developer was born and brought up in Surrey and now lives in Wimbledon with his wife Caroline and their five children. He's got a BA in Geography and his favourite shop is traveller's paradise Stanfords.\n\nHe's passionate about expeditions and exploration, fitting in an adventure trip every three years. His latest adventure was a six-week trek through Nepal and he's roughed it everywhere from Latin America to the Himalayas.\n\nFairness is important to James, but he's prepared to make exceptions for a game with such high stakes. He enjoys privacy and reading - his favourites include Candide and Tintin - but doesn't get many opportunities to be on his own.[2]\n\nSurvivor[]\n\nThis section is empty.
