Stroud Passes Away At Hospital\n\nFuneral for Prominent Local Resident and Former Mayor to be Held Tuesday\n\nJames W. Stroud\n\nBy H. P. White\n\nJames W. Stroud was born August 2, 1859, and died January 28, 1935. He grew to manhood in the state of Missouri. He was converted to Christianity at the age of fourteen years and was a member of the Methodist Church of Pawhuska, Oklahoma, at the time of his death. He made his own way in the world from the time he was twelve years of age. He married while quite young before arriving at the age of majority and raised a family of eight children. He made the run into Oklahoma April 22, 1889.\n\nHe founded the town of Stroud in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, in 1892. He was the first postmaster, the first banker, the first doctor, the first general merchant, and the first lumberman in the new town of Stroud. He built the first school house that was built in Lincoln County, territory of Oklahoma. He was the principal promoter of the building of the Frisco Railroad from Sapulpa, Indian Territory, to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Territory, a distance of one hundred three miles, and took the initiative in procuring a survey and right of way for that extension. He owned and had platted the town site of the town of Stroud, sold out most of his holdings at Stroud, and moved to Pawhuska, Oklahoma, in the early part of 1907.\n\nHe was always a builder, and in the early part of 1907, he built one of the first brick buildings erected in the city of Pawhuska, the two-story double fifty-feet front Stroud Building at Sixth adn Kihekah Avenue, now occupied by Kertman's Department Store. Shortly thereafter, he built the two-story Stroud building immediately across the alley south from the first building. He afterwards built two one-story brick buildings on North Kihekah Avenue and a one-story brick building on Sixth Street, now occupied by Kuhlman's Bakery.\n\nJames W. Stroud was the third mayor of the city of Pawhuska, serving as mayor from May 1909 to May 1911, covering a very important period in the history of Pawhuska, Oklahoma. He individually promoted the drilling of two gas wells for the City of Pawhuska. he solicited and procured subscriptions to the costs of the drilling of these two wells but contributed most of the money himself with the understanding that if the gas was procured, the wells would be turned to the City of Pawhuska at the actual cost of the drilling, the contributors to receive back the amount of money they contributed only and should dry holes be encountered, the contributors to bear the loss. Two gas wells were drilled under this arrangement, one at the southwest corner of the townsite and one at the northeast corner of the townsite. They were gas wells and were assigned to the City of Pawhuska at the actual cost of drilling. Pawhuska thus became a competitor of the Pawhuska Oil and Gas Company in furnishing gas to the citizens of Pawhuska, and through this competition the citizens of Pawhuska have been saved approximately one million dollars in the price of gas during the past twenty-five years.\n\nIn 1913, he organized the Acacia Oil and Gas Company, which was incorporated under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. He was the president, general manager, and the largest stockholder of that company. He was the leading spirit in the drilling of nineteen wells, all of which, except three, produced either oil or gas, or both. He retired from that company about ten years ago.\n\nHis was an active life. He was public spirited and gave freely to the churches and to charity. His passing is a real loss to the community.\n\nHe is survived by Etta B. Stroud, surviving wife; Sam W. Stroud and Charles Stroud of San Antonio, Tex.; LeMoyne Stroud of Fort Worth, Texas, sons; Mrs. Henry McMillen of Ponca City, Oklahoma; Mrs. J. H. Ward of Pawhuska, Oklahoma; and Mrs. Maude Spurr of Seminole, Oklahoma, daughters. Also nine grandchildren and one great grandchild.\n\nBuried Pawhuska, Osage County, Oklahoma, USA. [7]\n\nJ. W. Stroud was born in 1859 in Missouri and lived in Buffalo, Dallas, Missouri in his early years. He passed away in 1935 in Pawhuska, Osage, Oklahoma. He had a number of marriages during his life. He is known as founder of Stroud, Lincoln, Oklahoma. When he left Stroud, he moved to Pawhuska, Osage, Oklahoma, where he had many business interests. He served as mayor of Pawhuska in 1909. This is confirmed with a photo of him that hangs in the courthouse there and also by a notice in the Stroud Messenger (May 7, 1909): \"J. W. Stroud, formerly of this city, was elected mayor of Pawhuska last week by Republicans by a 142 majority.\"\n\nSources\n\n↑ Source: #S-1050174850\n\n↑ Source: #S-1050174797 Year: 1880; Census Place: Benton, Dallas, Missouri; Roll: 684; Family History Film: 1254684; Page: 330C; Enumeration District: 026; Image: 0323\n\n↑ Source: #S-1050174850\n\n↑ Source: #S-1050174797 Year: 1880; Census Place: Benton, Dallas, Missouri; Roll: 684; Family History Film: 1254684; Page: 330C; Enumeration District: 026; Image: 0323\n\n↑ Source: #S-1050174850\n\n↑ Source: #S-1050174797 Year: 1880; Census Place: Benton, Dallas, Missouri; Roll: 684; Family History Film: 1254684; Page: 330C; Enumeration District: 026; Image: 0323\n\n↑ Source: #S-1050174850\n\nSource: S-1050174797 Repository: #R-1786713044 1880 United States Federal Census Ancestry.com and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Publication: Ancestry.com Operations Inc\n\nRepository: R-1786713044 Ancestry.com Note:\n\nSource: S-1050174850 Repository: #R-1786713044 U.S., Find A Grave Index, 1600s-Current Ancestry.com Publication: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=83352620\n\nMakers of Government in Oklahoma: A Descriptive Roster of Oklahomans Whose Influence and Activity Make Them Significant in the Course of Public Events in Their State (1 January 1930). Biography. Has a lot of correct information but his birth location is incorrect. He was born in Missouri (not in New York).\n\nA Standard History of Oklahoma by Joseph Thoburn, 1916. This bio of J.W. Stroud is a combination of correct and incorrect information. This bio correctly states that he was born in Missouri. It says \"Springfield\" but was likely the smaller nearby town of Buffalo in Dallas County, Missouri, where he lived after his birth and as a young man. It also says his parents were German--they could have had some German heritage; however, the family had been in the U.S. for at least a few generations. His mother was Priscilla Smith (not Schmidt as the bio says). This bio says Martha Gregg was the mother of his children.\n\nFind a Grave: Pawhuska, Osage, Oklahoma.\n\nSources for middle name (William): Marriage record to Martha Gregg. Letter to his great great granddaughter from his last wife. Namesakes: J. W.'s son Charles Dow Stroud named one of his sons James William Stroud II. A grandson of Charles Dow Stroud was named James William Stroud III.\n\nMarriage record: Dallas County, Missouri, Martha Gregg and William Stroud. The Dallas County, Missouri, Marriage Records, Book B, is one place to find this record. They married at the home of John C. Travis."
