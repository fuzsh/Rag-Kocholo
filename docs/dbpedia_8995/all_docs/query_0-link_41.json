I have found memories of Grandpa Jim Stroud. I hope this pays fitting tribute to him.\n\nJames Stroud, called \"Uncle Jim\" was born in Van buren County. The Exact date is unknown, but it is believed to have been somewhere between 1845 and 1850. He was one of a family of five boys: Hicks, James, Isaac, Robert and Price. He married G Cordelia Mills, who was born August 26, 1851. To this union, three boys and two girls were born: Walter, Colphus, Rufus, Rhoda and Ora Lee. Walter married Millie Spears: Dolphus married Dora Jones; Rufus married Linda Freeman;Rhoda married Elbert Beavers ( many years after his death, she married Dolan Church); Ora Lee married Marion Thompson.\n\nIn 1895, he moved his family from Cleveland to Jerusalem. He purchased some acreage just south of and adjoining the lot where the store \"The Ark\" now stands, and built a home there. His wife, \"Aunt Delia\" , as she was called, passed away on April ^, 1918. His son-in-law, Elbert Beavers, had also died, and Uncle Jim lived in the house that Elbert had built when he came to Jerusalem. with Rhoda and her children for the remainder of his life.\n\nUncle Jim was a blacksmith by trade, and had a blacksmith shop just north of his home. Being an expert at the trade, at time he had more business than he could handle. He shoed horses and mules sharpened plows, made plow handles, repaired harnesses and did whatever it took to keep the crude farm implements in good working order. This was at a time when most of the dead were buried in home-made coffins. His shop also served as a make-shift coffin factory. Volunteer workers might be found making 2 or 3 coffins at one time.\n\nUncle Jim was a member of the Church of Christ and was a devoted servant. he walked to church as long as he was able, always carrying his Bible in his hand. Uncle Jim had a calm and quiet Manner about him, which enabled him to live a long and peaceful life. Even through times were hard, he went about his work faithfully, always looking for tomorrow to be a better day. During his lifetime, he wan the respect, confidence and love of a wide circle of friends. It is believed he died between 1928 and 1932.
