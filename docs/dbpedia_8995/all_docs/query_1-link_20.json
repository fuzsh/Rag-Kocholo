        "text": "Kyle James Stroud, 37, passed away on February 2, 2024. He was born in 1986 in Boulder Community Hospital on Easter. He is survived by his parents, Jim and Gayla, his brother Clifton, sister-in-law Jeanette, nephew Patrick, stepchildren Connor and Rylen, and best friend and love Sarah.\n\nKyle grew up in the mountains of Colorado where he shone bright as an extraordinary athlete. Throughout his life Kyle rode and raced competitively in Motocross, traveling with his family across the country and winning many accolades in the sport. One of his most cherished years of racing was the last year that he and his brother raced together in 2021.\n\nIn high school Kyle played football and was also part of the ski team.\n\nKyle had a deep love for the great outdoors, enjoying camping, fishing, and gardening. He was a talented master carpenter who had successfully owned his own business for nearly a decade. Kyleâ€™s carpentry was his artwork, and it was so stunning that he built his booming business out of nothing more than word of mouth.\n\nOver the years he adored his many canine companions Zeus, Jacob, Hooch, Bo, Barney, and is survived by Copper. Kyle had an unforgettable spirit, a strong personality, and a heart of gold. He will be dearly missed by all who were touched by his love.\n\nA Celebration of Life ceremony will be held in Branson, Missouri, on April 13, 2024."
