        "text": "Stroud Family Colorado\n\nFrom Out of Africa to the Trail of Tears and the Colorado Migration\n\nThe Stroud Family Colorado website chronicles the inspiring and historic African- and Native- American achievements of the pioneering Stroud family.\n\nI’m Frank Shines, descendant of Kimbal Dolphus (K.D.) and Lulu Magee Stroud. My grandfather was Tandy Stroud (son of Kimbal and Lulu) and my great uncle was Dolphus Stroud, Phi Bet Kappa 1928 Olympic hopeful.\n\nLearn more\n\nMy mother (deceased) was Vanessa Juanita Stroud (Tandy’s daughter) who married my father, Franklin Pierce Shines, Sr. in San Francisco, California in 1961. I am eternally grateful for my parents and my uncle Joe Stroud (Tandy’s son) and Carl Bourgeois (Bobby Stroud’s son) who inspired me to pursue excellence, help others and better understand my family history. You can reach me at fpshines@gmail.com.\n\nJoseph Stroud (1941 – 2024)\n\nMillionaire businessman and visionary dies\n\nOn April 12, 2024 at 8:35 am CST, philanthropist, telecom and media tycoon, Joseph Stroud, of the pioneering Stroud Family of Colorado, passed away at Hillsdale Hospital in Chicago.\n\nStroud Family Embraces AI\n\nFrank Shines and the crew of the upcoming family documentary film, “Running to Harvard,” are using AI to restore images and awaken history. The team (Producer: Frank Shines-Stroud Executive Director: Ralph-Michael Giordano, Assistant Director: Mike Pach Cinematographer: Kyle Hanchett) has also created an interactive AI-powered Stroud Family Chatbot that can answer any of your questions about the Stroud family. In the 1890s, Rev. K.D. and his wife Lulu used education as the technology of the times to secure a future for their children. Now two, three, four generations into the future Stroud descendants know that AI is fast becoming the game-changer for the Underdog that embraces this new technology.\n\nRunning to Harvard\n\n2024 Stroud Family Documentary\n\nA Man, a Family and a Colorado ‘Olympic City’ that Dared to Dream\n\nRunning to Harvard chronicles the untold, true Olympic story of Dolphus and Tandy Stroud, two scholar-athletes whose father (K.D.) was born and raised on a Texas plantation, and the legacy of a pioneering family’s impact on a city and a nation. Also, Bobby Stroud Bourgeois-Nelson, Nina Stroud Pellerin, Lulu Stroud Pollard, Jack Stroud and the other siblings are featured.\n\nThe documentary team includes: Producer: Frank Shines-Stroud, Executive Director: Ralph-Michael Giordano, Assistant Director: Mike Pach, Cinematographer: Kyle Hanchette. Interviews include: Colorado College, Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum, Sachs Foundation, Juanita (Stroud) Martin, Nicole Stewart, Percy Pellerin, Frank Shines and others.\n\nStroud Leadership Academy Coaches Underserved\n\nThe Stroud Leadership Academy‘s vision is: Imagine a world where everyone had an equal place at the starting line.\n\nThe mission of the Stroud Leadership Academy (SLA) is to develop leaders of character with critical thinking, problem-solving and digital literacy skills, a passion for lifelong learning and an understanding of the psychology of change.\n\nSLA is a Stroud family community outreach and IBOC give-back initiative in support of RACE the Opera. SLA will support and assist with fundraising for the opera, training underserved communities and producing and distributing an upcoming Stroud family documentary, to be produced by TV actor and producer Tim Reid and distributed on LG|CY TV, Legacy of a People.\n\nUpcoming 2024 Documentary Running to Harvard\n\nA Man, a Family and a Colorado Community that Dared to Dream\n\nThis 2024 documentary, Running to Harvard, chronicles the untold, true Olympic story of Dolphus and Tandy Stroud, two scholar-athlete brothers whose father was born and raised on a Texas plantation, and the legacy of a pioneering family’s impact on a nation.\n\nStroud Leadership Academy in Forbes\n\nOn September 2, 2022, Forbes Magazine featured the Stroud Leadership Academy in an article on Black entrepreneurship and high tech, as part of our partnership with GUETTO of Brazil.\n\nThe Stroud Leadership Academy is a giveback initiative of RACE the Opera which provides coaching and mentorship to underrepresented youth and entrepreneurs in the US, Africa and Brazil.\n\nSLA imagines a world where everyone had an equal place at the starting line.\n\nJuanita Stroud Martin Publishes “A Taste of Life”\n\nJuanita Stroud Martin, daughter of Phi Beta Kappa scholar-athlete and 1928 Olympic hopeful, releases new book on Amazon.\n\nThe book provides an historical record of the remarkable, largely untold story of the Stroud family of Colorado through the prism of different family perspectives.\n\nThe full title of the book is “A Taste of Life: Prisms — Through a Glass Darkly” in hardcover.\n\nRev. K.D. Stroud’s Anthem of Heaven Inspires Opera\n\nK.D. Stroud was born and raised on a Texas slave plantation. During a dream he awakened with a melody in his head. He studied music theory and wrote down a sketch of two songs: “You Must Get Ready to Die” and “Anthem of Heaven.”.\n\nYears later, his music and art prodigy daughter, Bobbie Stroud, updated the sheet music and played it (Ready to Die) on an organ while her sister Nina sang along. Nearly 100 years later the song (Anthem of Heaven) was showcased to a near-capacity crowd at the Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum on Independence Day weekend, July 2, 2022.\n\nSiblings Reunited\n\nAfter 40 Years\n\nMore than 40 years ago, the children of Vanessa Stroud (Trudy, Frank and Lisa) were separated.\n\nLisa was about 2 1/2 years old at the time that the State of California separated her from older siblings Trudy and Frank.\n\nThis website, Lisa’s dogged determination and the power of the human spirit all conspired to reunite the three siblings after 44 years.\n\nThe video here is Trudy (Stroud) Morgan’s tribute to a family reunited.\n\nJoseph Gray, HOKA & Sachs Foundation Pay Tribute to Dolphus Stroud\n\nColorado Springs resident, Joseph Gray, is a 7-Time USA Mountain Runner of The Year and a member of the Colorado Running Hall of Fame. In collaboration with his running shoe sponsor, HOKA, and the Sachs Foundation, Gray paid tribute to Dolphus Stroud, with whom he shared many parallels. “My desire to inspire the next generation of young Black athletes to try distance running, outdoor sports and mountain running led me to the story of Kelley Dolphus Stroud,” wrote Gray.\n\n2022-2023 Calendar\n\nFor 2022, there are several upcoming events:\n\nJul 2, 2022: RACE the Opera Performance Workshop w/ IBOC, 2pm local time at Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum (Stroud family history through Dolphus’ Olympic journey)\n\nJul 3, 2022.

Then 25,000 years ago a group of humans living in Siberia crossed a small land mass into Alaska and migrated south into Canada and the rest of the Americas. Among those first Americans were my family’s ancestors of the Creek Nation (Muscogee) and the Tawakoni (today’s Wichita and Affiliated Tribes) arriving in the Americas about 17,000 to 14,000 years ago. Our African lineage originates in the regions of Ghana, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Sudan.

Magee, statesman, abolitionist and author of Night of Affliction and Morning of Recovery: An Autobiography, published in 1873.\n\nFrank Shines’ DNA Profile\n\nStroud Family Colorado DNA. Based on my 23andMe.com ancestral DNA timeline, our first African ancestors arrived on slave ships in the American colonies (pre-USA) circa 1690-1720. Later, my 23andMe.com ancestral profile shows the first entrance of Scandinavian, French DNA (Carrie Boulduc) into our gene pool about 1720-1820 during the Revolutionary War. Then in the 1810-1870 time period (Trail of Tears and Emancipation Proclamation) British-Irish DNA appears, which explains the Stroud family name. Mandred Stroud was a Texas slave owner — and the grandfather of my great grandfather, K.D. Stroud.\n\nLearn more\n\nThe remarkable achievements of the Stroud Family (first generation out of slavery) are memorialized in several books: John Stokes Holley’s, The Invisible People of the Pikes Peak Region: An Afro-American Chronicle (1990), Inez Hunt’s The Story of Mr. Bristol and the Little Red Brick Schoolhouse (1971). I devote a chapter of my recently published book (Oct 2020), Let in But Left Out: Leadership, Faith & Knowledge in the Age of AI, Coronavirus & Fake News (Frank Shines and Granison Shines), to chronicling the history and accomplishments of the Stroud Family. The book draws upon the power of families and nations to adapt to change brought on by technology, personal hardships, and pandemics."
