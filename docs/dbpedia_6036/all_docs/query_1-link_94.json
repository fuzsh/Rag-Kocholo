        "text": "This week’s Band of the Week is hotly-tipped pop-rock duo Honey Revenge - who have just released their new album ‘Retrovision’ via Thriller Records.\n\nFounded on a collective dream and a drive for positivity, Honey Revenge are united by their long-standing and all-encompassing love for music. Growing up on everything from Warped Tour and Disney rock to Guitar Hero and R&B classics, their personal tastes have continuously evolved over time, creating the eclectic genre-less sonic cocktail they’re now mixing up within the alternative scene.\n\nHaving just announced their debut UK show at Camden Assembly on the 7th December - Devin Papadol - from the band, took a moment to talk to us about the album in more depth.\n\nHey there Honey Revenge - how are you? So your album is out now - how does it feel to have it out there in the world?\n\nHello! It’s very surreal. A lot of the songs on the album have been in the works for years so it’s wild to think that they’re out in the world for everyone to listen to!\n\nIt is called ‘Retrovision’ - what is the meaning behind that?\n\nThe “Retro” in ‘Retrovision’ is supposed to symbolize the retrospective approach to a lot of the messages we touch on in the album. I speak on a string of bad luck while also acknowledging that a lot of it stems from my bad attitude, and negative approach to life sometimes. In addition, there is an overall retro aesthetic that is represented in the visuals of it.\n\nWhere was it recorded? Any behind the scenes stories from the creative process you are happy to share with us?\n\nWe had the opportunity to record and write the album with a variety of talented producers and writers. It was all done in Los Angeles! We did a majority of the songs with Zach Jones, Kj Strock, and Kanner (Rachel Kanner). However, we did a handful of songs with other people such as Erik Ron, (who worked on ‘Seeing Negative’), Mike Green (who worked on ‘Are You Impressed?’) and Hiram Hernandez (worked on ‘Rerun’). Every song on the album had additional mastering from Kris Crummett!\n\nWhat are the key themes and influences on the album?\n\nWhile there’s obvious Emo influences to Retrovision, we had tons of inspiration come from listening to synth pop and neo soul. Bands like The Maine and The Band Camino to bands like Tonight Alive and You Me At Six.\n\nIf the album could be the soundtrack to any film - which one would it be and why?\n\nIf there was ever a remake to Jennifer’s Body that would be really awesome. I’d also love to have our music featured in something like Degrassi.\n\nDo you have a favorite lyric on the album - if so, which one and why?\n\nMy personal favorite lyrics from the record come from the bridge in ‘Seeing Negative’ because I think they encapsulate the record well: “I’m so driven but I can’t drive I’m don’t stuck sitting in the passenger side”… and it goes on to see “I’ve been needing a change of pace. If I keep begging then I might get a taste. Planned and accidental. Wasted potential” I’m talking about what it’s like to wait for your dreams to come true and feeling like your getting left behind but when everything finally comes to fruition and it’s crunch time, you might not be comfortable or ready.\n\nNow the album is out there - what next?\n\nTour anywhere and everywhere! I want to see the world and finally connect with the amazing people that have been supporting us from the beginning. We’re going to Europe in December, and hopefully we get to travel beyond that."
