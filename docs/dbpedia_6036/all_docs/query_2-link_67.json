        "text": "â€‹\n\nWelcome to my first rate! What we will be doing here is rating the singles of (Joy Division,) New Order (and all the off-shoots started by the four core/founding members of New Order). Whether you are an avid fan or just delving into their discography, I hope you hop on and enjoy the ride.\n\nJOY DIVISION\n\nThis band sure made one hell of an impact for only releasing four singles (two released after the 'end' of the band) and two albums. Composed of Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Steven Morris. Ian, who was epileptic and suffered from depression and other personal issues, was the frontman of the band and wrote all the lyrics. His lyrics were mainly melancholic and pained, which reflected in the band's sparse and gloomy punk arrangements. Joy Division would come to a premature end after Ian committed suicide. They never released singles from their albums (a trend New Order would continue for short while), so unfortunately due to the nature of this rate we don't really get to delve into the real meat of the band.\n\nTransmission\n\nKomakino\n\nLove Will Tear Us Apart\n\nAtmosphere\n\nNEW ORDER\n\nAfter Ian's suicide, the band continued as a three-piece and eventually recruited keyboardist Gillian Gilbert. Beginning as an almost facsimile of Joy Division, the four-piece would eventually evolve out of the eerie post-punk primordial soup and establish a distinct identity of their own. New Order began adopting more new wave and electronic styles over the course of four albums (Movement, Power Corruption & Lies, Low-Life, Brotherhood), trying to balance guitar-driven rock with synth-heavy dance, culminating in their (in my opinion) opus, Technique. Cue drama (inside and outside the band), a break up, a make-up, another break up, and a bit of a line-up change (the band is currently Bernard, Steven, Gillian, and two other guys). There were a few albums (Republic, Get Ready, Waiting For The Sirens' Call) released somewhere in there, too. And a new one (Music Complete) coming this September!\n\nCeremony\n\nProcession\n\nEverything's Gone Green\n\nTemptation\n\nBlue Monday (1988, -95)\n\nConfusion\n\nThieves Like Us\n\nMurder\n\nThe Perfect Kiss\n\nSub-culture\n\nShellshock\n\nState Of The Nation\n\nBizarre Love Triangle\n\nTrue Faith (-94)\n\nTouched By The Hand Of God\n\nBlue Monday 1988\n\nFine Time\n\nRound & Round\n\nRun 2\n\nWorld In Motion...\n\nRegret\n\nRuined In A Day\n\nWorld (The Price Of Love)\n\nSpooky (Minimix)\n\nTrue Faith-94\n\n1963 (Arthur Baker Remix)\n\nBlue Monday-95\n\nVideo 5 8 6\n\nCrystal\n\n60 Miles An Hour\n\nSomeone Like You\n\nHere To Stay\n\nKrafty\n\nJetstream\n\nWaiting For The Sirens' Call\n\nGuilt Is A Useless Emotion\n\nRestless\n\nMORE\n\nELECTRONIC\n\nElectronic was made up of Bernard and the Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, with some early collaborations with the Pet Shop Boys. They've released three albums in total (Electronic, Raise The Pressure, Twisted Tenderness) with the help of some friends, including Karl Bartos from Kraftwerk. The sound of the band varies between guitar-driven and full throttle synth/dance pop.\n\nGetting Away With It\n\nFeel Every Beat\n\nGet The Message\n\nTighten Up\n\nDisappointed\n\nForbidden City\n\nFor You\n\nSecond Nature\n\nUntil The End Of Time\n\nProdigal Son\n\nVivid\n\nMake It Happen\n\nLate At Night\n\nREVENGE\n\nFormed by Peter Hook and a bunch of people who I don't care to list in the early 90s during New Order's first break, they only released one album (One True Passion) and then re-released it with a bunch of new material later on. Sounds very much like New Order, or a place where New Order could have gone.\n\n7 Reasons\n\nPineapple Face\n\nSlave\n\nState Of Shock\n\nTHE OTHER TWO\n\nWhile Bernard and Peter were off making music with other bands in the 90s, Gillian and Steven decided to make their own band (hence the name). They've released two albums, The Other Two & You and Super Highways. Very pop-oriented.\n\nTasty Fish\n\nSelfish\n\nInnocence\n\nSuper Highways\n\nYou Can Fly\n\nMONACO\n\nAnother short-lived band started by Peter, formed from the ashes of Revenge with another former Revenge member David Potts. The band released an album in 1997 (Music For Pleasure) and another in 2000 (Monaco) that was initially shelved by the band's original label. Pop/rock with a dose of dance elements akin to Republic era New Order.\n\nWhat Do You Want From Me?\n\nShattered\n\nSweet Lips\n\nShine\n\nI've Got A Feeling\n\nSee Saw\n\nFREEBASS\n\nBorn from three bassists: our Peter Hook, The Smiths' Andy Rourke (who then left before completing the album), and Primal Screams' Gary Mounfield. Topped off with vocalist Gary Briggs. Freebass have one album (It's A Beautiful Life), one single, and a few EPs and then imploded. It's a mid-2000s rock band with 2-3 bassists, basically.\n\nLive Tomorrow You Go Down\n\nBAD LIEUTENANT\n\nAnother one of Bernard's bands, this time with Phil Cunningham (now bassist for New Order) and Jake Evans. They've only released one album Never Cry Another Tear and two singles. The band's sound is much more straight forward contemporary rock compared to the other bands in this rate.\n\nSink Or Swim\n\nTwist Of Fate\n\nTOTAL: if I counted right, that's only 68 songs to rate! Shouldn't be too hard. Send me your scores via PM. 0-10, half scores are acceptable, and one song gets an 11. Commentary is more than welcome. The deadline will be September 6th for the time being (I'll shorten/lengthen the voting period based on demand if need be).\n\nIn regards to songs with multiple mixes (like Bizarre Love Triangle's 7\" mix vs 12\" mix), go with whichever you prefer if you think it changes your score. I've only linked one version for the songs with different mixes like that, but feel free to seek out the others if you think they're different enough to warrant a change of score. Mention it in your comments!\n\nThis also means that I've consolidated all three Blue Monday releases (and both True Faith releases) into one entry. If enough people think that they would rather rate Blue Monday three times because the mixes are different enough to warrant different scores and rankings, I can make that change. I'd really like some feedback on this before I get the ball rolling.\n\nHowever, in the case of Run, 1963, and Spooky, please rate only the mix that was issued as a single (the linked version). Even if you think the album version of Run or the b-side version of 1963 is better, I need your score for the single mixes only, please.\n\nFinal note, don't worry about Video 5 8 6. It's a great song, but the single release is around 20min and I don't want you fussing with that.\n\n---\n\nLEADERBOARD\n\n#68. Prodigal Son - Electronic (3.50)\n\n#67.
