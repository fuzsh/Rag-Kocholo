        "text": "It's time once again to answer your questions about the music industry. This week's question comes from James Cross, who identifies himself as \"Loud Rock Director\" at WGDR-FM, a community radio station in Plainfield, Vermont:\n\n\"Exactly how much profanity merits a 'Parental Advisory' label on albums or 'Explicit' on songs? Who sets those rules and have they changed recently?\"\n\nThen he goes on to answer his own question:\n\n\"Just wanted to let you know, there is no rule on this. It is completely voluntary to put the PA sticker on a record. Maybe that's one of the ones you already knew though, haha. Hope I helped!\"\n\nHe's right. The record labeling system grew out of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) movie rating system, which was launched in 1968. But there are significant differences between that effort and record labeling. For one, movie rating is de facto mandatory -- a filmmaker or distributor who releases a film that has not been submitted for a rating risks the consequences: many theater chains will not show un-rated movies. Films are rated by a panel of anonymous California parents.\n\nMusic is rated by the artists who make it and their labels. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) calls it the \"Parental Advisory Label Program\" -- that's PAL for short. From the RIAA website:\n\n\"Individual record companies and artists decide which of their releases should receive a 'PAL Notice' indicating that the release contains explicit content.\"\n\nBut there's no specific definition of \"explicit.\" The main criteria seem to be: strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse.\n\nThe RIAA site then offers this caveat:\n\n\"A determination that a sound recording contains PAL Content is not a statement as to whether the sound recording is or is not suitable for particular listeners. Nor is the absence of any notification that a sound recording contains PAL Content a statement that the sound recording is completely devoid of all references to strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse.\"\n\nIn other words, they tell you, or they don't.\n\nThis kind of self-regulation usually grows out of the threat of potentially more restrictive government regulation (a popular topic these days). That was true when the MPAA launched its movie ratings system and it's certainly true for music labeling.\n\nThe record industry first recognized a threat when the Parents Music Resource Center launched in April of 1985. The non-profit foundation got off the ground with $5000 from a musician -- Beach Boy Mike Love. The founders were prominent Washington women including Mary (Tipper) Gore (then wife of Senator Al Gore).\n\nThe PMRC compiled a list of 15 songs it deemed objectionable. Topping the list was Prince's \"Darling Nikki,\" for its reference to masturbation. The story goes that Tipper Gore bought Purple Rain (the album containing \"Darling Nikki\") for her young daughter, who promptly pointed out the naughty bits.\n\nThe Washington wives used their connections (PMRC's founders included wives of 10 Senators, 6 Representatives, and a Cabinet Secretary) to leverage their cause. And they had some leverage -- it seems there was a bill that the music industry very much wanted to get through Congress. H.R. 2911 proposed a tax on tape recorders and blank cassettes as a way of collecting royalties (most of which would go to the labels) to offset the claimed losses that would result from home taping.\n\nJust five months after the PMRC launched, the RIAA announced that record labels would put advisories on albums. But the PMRC rejected the RIAA's olive branch, saying the industry proposal did not go far enough. The PMRC wanted all song lyrics printed on album covers; albums with explicit covers kept behind record store counters; and a requirement that labels reassess contracts with musicians who engaged in violent or sexually explicit behavior in concert.\n\nThe PMRC also proposed a rating system similar to the MPAA's:\n\nX for \"profane or sexually explicit\" lyrics\n\nV for violence\n\nD/A for drug and alcohol references\n\nO for \"occult\" content\n\nThe RIAA rejected these demands and suggested a label reading, \"Parental Guidance: Explicit Lyrics.\"\n\nCary Sherman, the current President of the RIAA, was a lawyer at Arnold & Porter at the time.\n\n\"First, no \"board\" can determine what is the appropriate interpretation of a song and therefore how it should be rated,\" Sherman writes in an email. \"It's up to the listener to decide the meaning of a song. Second, it's simply impractical to rate as many songs as are released in a given year. In 2009, there were 793 movies rated. That same year, there were over 97,000 albums, or over 1.2 million songs, released.\"\n\nNevertheless, the PMRC pushed for a panel of industry and consumer representatives -- similar to the MPAA ratings board -- to develop specific guidelines.\n\n\"The original proposal for a full blown ratings system was opposed by Frank Zappa and by a group I organized of managers, agents, PR people, artists and some label execs called The Musical Majority (a reference to the Moral Majority founded by televangelist Jerry Falwell), which was created in association with the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union),\" says Danny Goldberg, who was then head of Gold Mountain Records.\n\n\"We felt that words did not lend themselves to a movie type rating system,\" Goldberg continues, \"because different people would interpret what was 'violent,' etc., differently -- not to mention humor, irony, etc.\"\n\n\"I remember the PMRC complaining about the song 'Under the Blade' by Twisted Sister which they claimed was about rape,\" says Cary Sherman. \"But the lead singer for the group, Dee Snider, testified that the PMRC was projecting its violent fantasies into his music, which was actually about the fear that a patient experiences on the operating table before surgery, and that the song was inspired by surgery that the band's drummer had to undergo.\"\n\nSnider testified at a 5-hour hearing held by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on September 19, 1985. The hearing room was filled with TV cameras (all of the major networks were there). By most accounts, the most damaging testimony came from John Denver -- in support of freedom of expression. But much of the coverage went to Frank Zappa (the event was marked last month by the unveiling of a statue in his honor in his hometown, Baltimore) because his testimony was both, well, Zappaesque and cogent.\n\nHis full statement is part of the Congressional Record. Here's a choice bit:\n\n\"The PMRC promotes their program as a harmless type of consumer information service, providing 'guidelines' which will assist baffled parents in the determination of the 'suitability' of records listened to by 'very young children.' The methods they propose have several unfortunate side effects, not the least of which is the reduction of all American music, recorded and live, to the intellectual level of a Saturday morning cartoon show.\"\n\nLess than two months after the Congressional hearing, the adversaries announced a compromise: albums could either bear the label \"Explicit Lyrics - Parental Advisory\" or, in lieu of that, have all of their lyrics printed on the back cover.\n\nSeveral chains announced they would not carry stickered albums. Wal-Mart Stores, Sam's Club and Walmart.com (collectively \"Wal-Mart\") still operate under a policy that disallows recordings with the Parental Advisory Label.\n\n\"Overall, I don't think labels adversely effected sales,\" says Danny Goldberg, who now heads Gold Village Entertainment, an artist management company. \"Since kids -- even before the Internet -- were able to get what they wanted. It ended up being a way for certain retailers like Wal-Mart to brand themselves as 'family friendly' -- at least to families who didn't like profanity on records.\"\n\nThe drama over record labeling moved from the national stage to statehouses. By 1990, nineteen states had considered some form of labeling legislation.\n\nThat same year the record companies announced a revised label: \"Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics.\" Unlike the previous labels, it was to be a standard size; black and white; and always located on the bottom right-hand corner of a physical release.\n\nThe debate dragged on and Congress held more hearings in 1994. The result was a slightly revised label -- the one still in use 16 years later: \"Parental Advisory: Explicit Content.\" The Senate followed with more hearings -- on violence in music -- in 1997 and 1998. The RIAA revised the guidelines for its members.\n\nToday the PAL logo is usually embedded in the digital artwork for albums purchased online, says Cary Sherman.\n\n\"Each individual track that has potentially objectionable content is labeled 'explicit,' which stays with the track even after point of purchase. If there is one track that is labeled 'explicit,' the entire album must have a PAL logo, even if not all of the tracks on the album are labeled as such,\" Sherman says.\n\nToday, \"Parental Advisory: Explicit Content,\" is a fact of music-buying life. So it's perhaps hard to imagine what a big deal this fight was. The story was covered by the international media. Countless musicians, from Metallica to Sonic Youth to the Ramones to Ice-T recorded songs or produced album art criticizing the Parents Music Resource Center.\n\nAs for the PMRC, it's gone the way of record store chains."
