[besides blue monday, and true faith]\n\n\"Bizarre Love Triangle\" is a song by the English rock band New Order, released as a single in 1986 from their fourth studio album, Brotherhood (1986), which reached the top five on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart,[5] and No. 5 on the Australian ARIA Charts (No. 1 on the Victoria state chart) in March 1987.[6]\n\nIt failed to make the top 40 in either the United Kingdom (only reaching No. 56[7]) or the US Billboard Hot 100. In the United States, the song reached No. 8 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart, but failed to chart on the Hot 100 during its original 1986 release. However, a new mix included on The Best of New Order was released in 1994 and finally made a brief appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 in the number 98 position in 1995.\n\nIn 2004 the song was ranked number 201 in Rolling Stone's \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\nhere is the iconic video version:\n\nthere are multiple official versions:\n\nCode:\n\nbizarre dub triangle (7\" edit) 3:23 v bizarre dub triangle (or i don't care) 7:00 v, cd bizarre love triangle 4:20 v, cd, cs bizarre love triangle-94 3:54 v, cd, cs bizarre love triangle (7\" edit #1) 3:40 v bizarre love triangle (7\" edit #2) 3:23 v bizarre love triangle (10\" acetate) 3:36 v bizarre love triangle (12\") 6:44 v, cd, cs bizarre love triangle (armand van helden mix) 8:59 v, cd, cs bizarre love triangle (best of) 3:51 v, cd, cs bizarre love triangle (extended edit) 4:58 v bizarre love triangle (live bbc1) 4:39 v, cd bizarre love triangle (live reading98)4:52 dvd bizarre love triangle (married to the mob) 3:54 v, cd, cs Bizarre Love Triangle (Richard X Edit) 4:18 v, cd Bizarre Love Triangle (Richard X Extended Mix) 6:55 v, cd bizarre love triangle (single remix) 3:44 v, cd bizarre love triangle (threesome) 3:23 cd\n\nthere's a few more recent live versions i haven't included either.\n\nI think it's a great song, and maybe except for the 'armand van helden' version\n\nfrom the rest of remixes, most are great..\n\ni will cover some of the other versions also, and also, there are multitracks out\n\nthere, if you want to remix it yourself.\n\nlater\n\n-1\n\nThere are certain immortal songs out there, songs that sound great (or at least decent) no matter what one does to them. Bizarre Love Triangle is one such song; check out some of the various covers on YouTube for proof (the Even As We Speak version is particularly engaging). BLT wouldn't make my personal NO top ten, but that's not a knock on BLT; it's just that there are other NO songs that I love even more!\n\nThe album version is a great pop confection, the 12\" remix is a head-spinning dance track, the '94 remix is surprisingly enjoyable...but my absolute favourite version is the one on the live BBC album. It sounds alive, what with Hooky's psychotic bass and Bernard's incredibly impassioned vocals. It's rough in all the right places, and really gets the lyrics' sentiments across in a way that no other performance does.\n\nGot a link to this?\n\nInteresting idea, I happen to love a lot of the solo projects but they all seem to have a distinct variety of \"New Order-ishness\" from each other. I happen to think the first Electronic album is a classic though and their output generally stood head & shoulders above anything Hooky or the others did. Here's what I'd have put together from the side projects (if anyone had even bothered to ask me!) and I'm pretty sure this'd be a more listenable album than the Lost Sirens album.\n\nSide 1\n\nIdiot Country (Electronic)\n\nTasty Fish (The Other Two)\n\nBilly Bones (Monaco)\n\nVivid (Electronic)\n\nPineapple Face (Revenge)\n\nDisappointed (Electronic)\n\nSide 2\n\nJunk (Monaco)\n\nSoviet / Get The Message (Electronic)\n\nPatience Of A Saint (Electronic)\n\nSecond To None (Electronic)\n\nForbidden City (Electronic)\n\nGetting Away With It (Electronic)\n\nI hope I'm not stepping on anyone's toes here, but I love this band too much to let this thread go without at least taking it on to Republic. I'll gladly step aside should any of the OPs wish to continue it at any point.\n\nFor now, next up on Brotherhood is All Day Long:\n\nThis is probably my favourite song on the album. It's stuffed with hooks, from the opening riff to those wonderful synth figures that could have each been a song on their own (check out 2:20 and 3:08 for two particularly glorious examples). The lyrics are surprisingly dark, and - unlike most NO songs - they actually include the title (!). They may not be as poetic as something Morrissey would have written, but thematically, at least, they wouldn't be out of place on the first Smiths album.\n\nAs a finished performance, it's one of NO's greatest achievements. The record - though superficially quiet compared to something like Blue Monday - barrels along with an unstoppable force, with a wonderfully deep bottom end rounding everything out. Bernard sings it beautifully, with sensitivity and passion (\"So don't tell me about politics\"), and I could listen to the outro forever. It's almost like their Layla, with the first (vocal) half dominated by pain and confusion, and the second (instrumental) half feeling more cathartic in tone.\n\nMES told me the Worst was the best band that ever lived. I've never been able to find anything at all about them on the internet or anywhere."
