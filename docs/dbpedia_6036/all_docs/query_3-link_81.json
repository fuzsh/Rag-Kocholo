        "text": "Harry Styles And Taylor Swift’s Break-Up Songs About Their Relationship Uncovered\n\nHarry Styles is thought to be a big inspiration for Taylor Swift when it came to her album '1989'. Let’s take a look inside their relationship, including why and when they split and which songs they wrote about each other.\n\nTaylor Swift's fans have been getting excited about the re-recording of her first six albums, and now that she's officially dropped '1989 - Taylor's Version', Swifties are now convinced Harry Styles was the boyfriend who inspired the album.\n\nFans are convinced that '1989' was heavily inspired by her romance with the former One Direction star, with many lyrics referencing him, so it's no surprise fans Swifties immediately pressed play on the five new tracks From The Vault that were released along with the re-record.\n\nRead more: Harry Styles And Taylor Swift: Inside Their Relationship & Are They Still Friends?\n\nRead more: Who Is Taylor Swift’s ‘1989’ Album About? All The Tracks Thought To Be About Harry Styles\n\nRead more: All Of Taylor Swift's Albums In Order By Year\n\nSo, when exactly did Harry and Taylor date? Why did they split and how many songs have they written about each other?\n\nLet’s take a look at all the deets you need to know…\n\nWhen did Harry Styles and Taylor Swift date?\n\nThe pair are thought to have met and started dating around November 2012, with a picture of Harry and Taylor strolling around Central Park going viral the following month.\n\nHowever, their romance came to an end at the start of 2013.\n\nWhy and when did Harry Styles and Taylor Swift split?\n\nThey only dated for a few short months and called it quits in early 2013, during a New Year’s holiday in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nThe couple had jetted off on holiday to spend time together after spending Christmas apart, but an alleged argument led them to cut their quality time short, with Taylor flying back to the US alone just three days later.\n\nHarry continued to stay on holiday for a while longer before news broke that they had called time on their short-lived relationship.\n\nWhich songs has Taylor Swift written about Harry Styles?\n\nIt is thought that Taylor’s tracks ‘Style’, ‘Out of the Woods’ and ‘Cardigan’ are just some of the songs penned about her 1D ex.\n\nIn ‘Style’, along with the obvious name comparison, her lyrics alluded to Haz’s appearance, as she sang: “You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt, and I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt”.\n\n‘Out of the Woods’ makes reference to the famous aeroplane necklace that was worn by both of the stars at the time of their romance.\n\nMeanwhile, Tay’s ‘Cardigan’ music video drew on very similar visuals to Harry’s ‘Falling’.\n\nSome fans also think ‘I Knew You Were Trouble’ was written about Haz as it was released not long after their split.\n\nMany '1989' tracks also make subtle references to Harry - or have been responded to in songs by the singer himself.\n\nAccording to Swifties, these '1989' bops are rumoured to be about Harry:\n\n‘Blank Space’\n\n‘I Wish You Would’\n\n‘All You Had To Do Was Stay’\n\n‘How You Get The Girl’\n\n‘This Love’\n\n‘Clean’\n\n‘Wildest Dreams’\n\n‘Out of the Woods’\n\n‘Style’\n\n‘I Know Places’\n\nWhich songs has Harry Styles written about Taylor Swift?\n\nHarry’s track ‘Two Ghosts’ is thought to be about Taylor, with the lyrics, “Same red lips, same blue eyes / Same white shirt, couple more tattoos,” hinting at a very 2012 Tay.\n\n‘Perfect’, 'Walking In The Wind', 'Olivia' and ‘Ever Since New York’ have both been speculated to be about his then-girlfriend, too.\n\nHe even penned a track titled ‘I Love You’ for US singers Alex & Sierra, which includes references to some of Tay's songs.\n\nLet’s be honest, no one writes love songs better than Harry and Taylor!"
