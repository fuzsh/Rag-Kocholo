        "text": "World In Motion < Regret > World\n\nI can’t begin to imagine the chaos surrounding the band in 1992. Label failing. Club failing. Money hemorrhaging. Band-weary. Project-hungry. If there was ever an atmosphere within which to record a new album with enthusiasm, coherence and belief, then this wasn’t it. Against all odds, and under extreme duress, New Order still managed to offer up a very good album with at least one flare of brilliance; namely Regret, and more than a handful of otherwise solid tunes. I’m going to take my time going through this album, because it needs some serious reconsideration…\n\nBut first, some thoughts on Bernard, Peter, Gillian and Stephen’s respective solo projects, which were a significant force around this time. I’ve whipped up a quick chart of the band members’ album output over the years:\n\nJust look at those first 10 years. What a phenomenal body of work. What a consistently-stunning sequence of albums. Almost year-on-year (not counting the singles in between), plus all that touring, plus the label & club, plus their Bemusic production work, etc etc. Call me biased, but I reckon that is 10 years remarkably well spent, which few others can match. After all that, wouldn’t you want to take a break too? Wouldn’t you want to change the dynamic, work with some other people, gain traction on some ideas outside the collective? In hindsight it was so obviously the right move that I wonder why anyone challenged their motives during this time; let alone the band members to each other…\n\nSo the solo works – in a nutshell (because I’m not here to review them). Electronic is simply brilliant in every way. A stunning release from Bernard, Johnny, Neil and Chris. The last-best album to come out on Factory. You can understand Hooky feeling a little taken aback with Bernard’s desire to fly solo for a bit (and indeed the quality and his success in doing so), but – perhaps as a sign of things to come 15 years later – there’s a little of the puerile in Revenge. One True Passion and Gun World Porn have passion for sure, but – with a few good exceptions – they lack songwriting cohesion, and no amount of money thrown at the studio can make up for that. Monaco would be the real deal 7 years later. The Other Two & You was everything you’d expect from Gillian and Stephen; melodic pure electronic pop music – no more, no less – and how great was it to finally have Gillian singing!\n\nI’ve always felt that the solo works of ’90-’92 were in a way the seperate pieces of a ‘lost’ New Order album that Republic didn’t quite live up to, but that absolutely had to be, and I for one am glad they all exist. For the band, Republic probably felt like passing a watermelon, and it’s a mark of their indomitable spirit that they were able to recover sufficiently to release such a decent album.\n\nIndeed there are 4 remarkable recoveries in New Order’s career: the first being of course the band’s coming together immediately after Ian’s death. The second being their regrouping to produce Republic; lashed to the masts as they were during the downfall of Factory/Haçienda. The third – with thanks to Rob Gretton for his final act in helping to set them all straight again – being the band’s conscious recoupling in the late-’90s, which eventually led to Get Ready; an album I never thought would come – particularly as they were sick to the eyeballs of each other and Reading’93 seemed to be their curtain call (and after which London began horse-flogging). And finally in 2011; Gillian’s triumphant return, the benefit shows, signing with Mute, and Music Complete. As New Order fans, we have a lot to be thankful for.\n\nRegret then…\n\nFirst appearances were worrying. The Republic-era releases sport some of my least-favourite sleeves in the New Order catalogue, and the cowboy/Malboro-men sunset thing seemed so far away from New Order and Peter Saville’s representations to-date that my apprehensiveness was high. I never quite got the hidden meaning in the choice and sequencing of the Photoshopped images used across these releases, but putting a positive spin on it I suppose it was different, and it certainly no longer looked like a Factory-release; particularly with the spelling-out of ‘A NewOrder Release‘ on the front. Just in case, you know…\n\nBut the song itself is wonderful. If you were going to lead with your best shot, they certainly did it with Regret. Opening with huge synth-string calls and chunky guitar responses, leading into Hooky’s driving bass melodies; and which in my opinion is one of his finest performances and is the absolute backbone to the song. Bernard’s vocal performance is first class; hitting his highs with confidence and forcefulness. Lyrically strong, I particularly love the opening ‘Maybe I’ve forgotten‘ lines, the chorus, and the final ‘Just wait ’til tomorrow‘ final reprise. The song is just so melodic; rising and falling in tune with the intensification and easing of the regret in Bernard’s voice. I’ve spoken before about the evolution of Bernard’s songwriting and messaging, and this felt absolutely like the right song at this time; a reflective, tuneful, powerful song that spoke volumes and laid bare their recent past.\n\nRemix-wise the stand-out version is Farley & Heller’s Fire Island Mix, which has a lovely laid-back feel with its loungey alternative bassline and additional piano work. It remains a great chillout track on my personal playlists. Their Junior Dub Mix follows similar lines but has only a short and repeated vocal sample, a more overall house-feel, and adds a subtle and effective acid tone to the the low-end sequencer which works a treat. The band’s own New Order Mix offers a different balance with respect to the original’s guitars vs. synths; with a greater emphasis on the latter, and an alternative outro (lacking the vocal reprise). The Weatherall/Sabres of Paradise Fast ‘N’ Throb mix leaves me underwhelmed; largely because of its minimal connection to the original (something which many of the London-era remixes suffer) and it gets boring very quickly. Their Slow ‘N’ Lo mix fares better for its echoey dub feel, vocal and bass inclusions, but the pseudo-harmonica sounds a tad cheap. I actually prefer this excursion into reggae beats far more than Ruined In A Day, but we’ll get to that.\n\nThe video for Regret is one of my all-time favourite New Order clips, with its postcards-from-Europe feel (changing to the industrial mid-West?); band members playing in the hotels rooms and cavernous marbled halls. Very stylish. As for the Baywatch ‘version’… embarrasing.\n\nI agree with Neil Tennant’s assertion on NewOrderStory that Regret is one of the band’s finest singles up to that point. It’s certainly in my top-five of all time; and is easily the best song on Republic. Proof-positive that you can’t judge a book by its cover.\n\nRating:"
