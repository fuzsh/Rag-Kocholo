        "text": "For over thirty years, death metal legends Six Feet Under have been leaving their mark in the death metal scene. From breaking from the norms of traditional death metal to a more death n' roll, groove variant sound, the band has been one of the longest active bands from the peak of 1990's death metal. They are also the fourth best-selling death metal act in the U.S. Fronted by former Cannibal Corpse front man Chris Barnes, the band is crawling back from the grave with the release of their new studio album Killing For Revenge on May 10th through Metal Blade Records.\n\nI sat down with Chris Barnes as he gave us the scoop on the brand new album Killing For Revenge. We also talk about the band's history, their collaboration with rapper and Body Count front man Ice-T, marijuana and why he quit, his Cameo, the Graveyard Classics albums, and being the star of a car commercial."
