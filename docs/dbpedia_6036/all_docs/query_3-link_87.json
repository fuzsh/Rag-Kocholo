        "text": "I never should have sold my C'vania II cart üòî it was worth it just for the music alone. what a great series this was!\n\nThanks for the article, I'm actually gonna check out this guy's Tubes while I'm building cabinets today ü§ò\n\n@-wc- My fully boxed copy of CV2 on the GB cost me ¬£12.99 from a local indie game store in the late '90s. Last time I checked, I think it was worth about ¬£400-¬£500 in that condition. I'll be passing it down to my kids!\n\n(Unless, of course, it begins to drop in value as all of us old gits pass away and nobody wants to pay that stupid price)\n\n@Damo\n\n\"(Unless, of course, it begins to drop in value as all of us old gits pass away and nobody wants to pay that stupid price)\"\n\nI do wonder if all but the really big important and most zeitgeisty games will be the \"heirloom china\" of the next generation. üò¨\n\nEither way, what a cool thing to have! Mine was just a loose copy, and in the \"wii era\" for whatever reason I felt a lot less attached to my physical copies. It was a more optimistic time in gaming, for me, and I thought stuff like Virtual Console was just going to expand and get better and more comprehensive over time üòÖ\n\nLuckily I did keep many of my favorite valuable childhood games: Metal Storm, Earthbound, Rtype 3 etc. üëç I'm not really accumulating these kinds of games anymore so I'm glad to have them! cheers damo ‚úåÔ∏è\n\nEvery musical track on Super Castlevania IV is engrained into my mind. I even used the intro music with the headstone to scare the neighbours with one Halloween night playing in the background on a spooky October in the early 90s recorded professionally onto a cassette tape! Really added to the atmosphere of that title back in the 16 bit days.\n\nAs for Castlevania prices crazy money some of them, appreciate more than gold, just like Lego and most Nintendo plus Square Enix games. Saw a mint Symphony of the Night with Art cards go for wild money recently. Must be one of, if not the most consistent series for appreciation from initial retail value."
