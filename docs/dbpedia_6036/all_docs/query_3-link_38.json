        "text": "I have always regarded my now 40 year old self as a music lover in general. I (used to) enjoy a pretty broad spectrum of genres and sounds, though I predominantly consider myself a black metal fan. 9 times out of 10, when it comes to actually picking out something to listen, it is something of the sort. The mix of aggression, anger, bitterness, melancholy, melody and many more that black metal offers in spades used to do the trick for me.\n\nAnd then lockdowns came, along with all their restrictions and measures; more often than not excessive and disproportionate, sometimes absurd and unreasonable, sometimes plain ridiculous. And with all that, the need for satisfying anything else apart from anger and aggression evaporated. No thirst for other feelings left to quench, only anger and hatred. War metal, or bestial black metal or whatever you wanna call it, was something that I occasionally enjoyed, but apart from a handful of albums, it never clicked. And suddenly lo and behold, the scales were removed from my eyes and a band that I never really considered anything special, became the torch bearer for my newfound mental state.\n\nNow, you'll get people saying that all Revenge albums/songs are the same etc etc. Do not listen to them, listen to the albums. They are really, REALLY different to each other; in terms of sound production, in terms of vocals, in terms of tempo changes (or lack thereof), in terms of songwriting. Remember that most heavy metal fans, consider all black metal songs and albums identical, there are even jokes about that, but we know that this could not be further from the truth. Anyway, I could pick any album to review, but I chose Scum.Collapse.Eradication because it sits right in the middle of the band's sound evolution.\n\nThe production and mix is much clearer than that of the first three LPs, but still rawer than the polished (at least for Revenge standards) sound of the last two. Pete Helmkamp is gone, and the vocals alternate between the trademark high pitched aggressive screams and artificially low grows in a perfect balance. The songwriting starts to become more nuanced and you can easily tell one song from another. Carefully placed slow parts, breakdowns, and catchy sections start to pop more often. The album clocks at an ideal 35 minutes. Banner Degradation -Revenge's best song- is on this album. And of course the classic Revenge sound, though somewhat tamed, is ever-present; the hyperactively blasting drumming and the chaotic chord progression \"riffing\" drive every song into perfection.\n\nThe problem is that now I cannot really enjoy any other kind of black metal or music in general. Everything sounds watered down and spineless after a few minutes. Every time I feel like listening to anything else, I find myself reaching back to the soul-soothing sounds of Mr Read and Mr Ross. Thank you lockdowns and Revenge for ruining music for me. Well played.\n\nAfter three albums and several minor releases, I'd got used to Revenge's style of blast-attack-raze (as in raze to the ground) style of black metal so it's a surprise to discover on this fourth album that the guys have actually raised their game to another, higher level. The band's sound is sharper than what I remember and the songs are now long enough to admit the occasional lead guitar solo which, in line with the Revenge take-no-prisoners musical philosophy, pullulates insanely shrill bubble chords as fast as bacteria on speed. The sound actually varies from lawn-mower drone to deep gravel chow-downs. There are strange throaty guttural effects a-plenty on most tracks that sound as if Read got himself a bunch of monster zombie hounds and locked them up in the studio while the band was recording so you hear them groaning and slavering away in the background. He's got reason to defend himself with such canine critters as this album expresses his and the band's general disgust with human \"sheeple\" weakness.\n\nA dramatic intro with thudding bass drum and crashing riffs, beneath which James Read's voice growls indecipherable sweet-nothings, swings into \"Us and Them (High Power)\" which, having claimed out attention, rips into a careening zig-zag all over the shop with shrill guitar zips and bash-bash percussion. \"Retaliation (Fallout Prayer)\" follows immediately after and although it appears an extension of the first track, I can sort of hear a slightly different rhythm (or maybe my mind thinks, this is a new song so it must have a different rhythm!) and there are bits that go hollow and rattling which I've never heard before on any black metal album. (Are Revenge going experimental?) \"Parasite Gallows (In Line)\" can't wait to get started and finish at the same time so this is another wild tear through nuclear-powered drums, the filthiest, crust-laden guitar chainsaw churn, more lead guitar frothing up like cane toad spawn and deep croaky monster vocal effects. For weird, gravelly sonic texture and creepiness, very few songs can match \"Parasite Gallows ...\" and this is an early highlight if not the major highlight of the album.\n\nHardly any time for a breather each time a song ends as Revenge are already into the next one and halfway through it and before long we're close to the last couple of tracks. The singing, if we can call it that, is more deranged and hysterical with every additional track, with more screams and \"aaaarghhhs!\" The musicianship is surprisingly good when you consider the guys are playing faster than fast and chaotically, and the second half of the album improves on the first with more varied beats and a wide array of effects. \"Banner Degradation (Exile or Death)\" manages to pack in a slow, almost sludge stomping beat with an industrial edge in among the hyper-fast rhythms and riffing. By \"Pride Ruination (Division Collapse)\", we're just about ready for anything from Revenge that we haven't heard before and this track turns out to have a real rhythmic groove in parts. The drumming is stuttering hard and cymbals are all but completely berserk. \"Scorned Detractor (Trust No One)\" sees those half-crazed zombie hounds straining at the metal bars of their cage which increasingly comes close to breaking point while Read screeches himself ragged and the Revenge train races headlong towards the inevitable cliff-top where the sleepers end and below is just vast empty space.\n\nFor sheer energy and ferocity, few bands can match Revenge and few can also match the music not just for its aggression and anger but also humour. Read and Vermin really do sound as though they're enjoying every moment bashing out this opus.\n\nUh, well I was expecting the album to end in fiery and chaotic self-immolation but the conclusion is abrupt and it's me who's fallen off the cliff-top and going down, down, down into empty space while the fellers above are cheering me on!\n\nThickly distorted, grinding guitars. Blast beats. Growls and gurgles that spit out presumably violent lyrics you couldn't even begin to decipher. That's Revenge in a nutshell; they don't fuck around in the least, and they don't pretend to. In a lot of ways, Scum.Collapse.Eradication is very similar to their previous album, Infiltration.Downfall.Death, but as is often the case, the devil is in the details. There's something slightly more refined about the chaos on Scum, which is hard to notice at first, but really is what makes the album shine. A plethora of slow, doomy, heavy parts provide respites from the usual grinding, and the song writing is a bit more complex. It's not a radical change, but it turns Scum into an exciting black/death album indeed.\n\nAll the pieces and parts here are top-notch. The core of Revenge's sound will always be the bestial grinding of most of their riffs, and those moments are strong here. The riffs will cut right through you with their utter brutallity, and they're thick and meaty due to a great production and complementing bass work. The occasional shredded guitar solo helps things along as well. However, Revenge doesn't leave you wallowing and bored in a sea of high speed riffs. They like to stop and take things slow now and then, grinding you down instead of outright pulverizing you. The break downs and doomier bits are the parts, e.g. the break down in \"Parasite Gallows (In Line)\" and the groove half-way through \"Pride Ruination (Division Collapse)\", provide some of the album's strongest moments. These parts show up frequently, adding up to give the album an up and down, rollercoaster feel. The drumming helps immensely too, with breaks from the blast beats changing the feeling of riffs entirely. Then there are of course the vocals, which are an insane mix of screams, growls and deep, goregrind gurgles. Everything is mixed very well, with no part overtaking any other.\n\nNot to say that any of that increased complexity is the end point of the album. Scum.Collapse.Eradication isn't about eight songs, it's about a 36 minute experience. It's very clear from the nearly complete lack of hooks. Revenge aren't friendly, and they're not here to be listenable or pleasant. You fall head first into a Revenge album and let it tear apart your soul, leaving you in a state of exhausted catharsis at the end. The clever little complexities of the album only serve to make the experience even more of a roller coaster, and that's what makes the album work. It also greatly improves relistenability and rewards such repeat listens. Though it's the album's blessing, it is at once Scum's (and Revenge's) weakness at well. Revenge is only really good at providing that one experience, albeit in different forms on each album (and at its best here). I find it satisfying, but many won't, and I'm sure a great deal of people will think it's simply poor songwriting. If this is your kind of music, there's plenty to gorge yourself on, and I find it immensely enjoyable. On the other hand, if Scum.Collapse.Eradiction doesn't sound like your thing, don't expect to be converted.\n\nThe production on this record is well-balanced, with plenty of low-end matched by guitars and cymbals which rise above it. Revenge's sound remains remarkably coherent even when everything's blasting; both J. Read's drumming and the lead guitar are equally easy to follow, giving this record surprising depth.\n\nThe last record was a little different -- a bit more complex, a bit slower in places -- but on Scum.Collapse.Eradication the band manages to combine that approach with the feral insanity of their first two records, retaining the full impact of both. The result just might be the best Revenge record of all time: packed with crushing slow parts, tempo changes, and surprisingly memorable riffs amidst a torrent of raging, frothing hatred. The vocals are a cut above as well, belched and snarled and bellowed, sometimes pitch-shifted, vomiting pure aggression all over each and every track. \"Scorned Detractor\" is a perfect example, with a vocal intro that has to be heard to be believed. I don't even miss Pete Helmkamp on this record, and I doubt I'll ever type *that* sentence twice!\n\nThis is still Revenge, though, and that means that everyone will either hate it or love it; what you hear is what you get, and what you get is thirty-five minutes worth of pummelling blasts and churning guitars. If that's what you're looking for you'll be well-pleased by this; most of the album is a frantic paean to grinding chaos, especially \"Parasite Gallows (In Line)\" and \"Banner Degradation (Exile or Death)\". Not one millisecond of this will be a let-down to anyone familiar with Revenge; as always, the ferocity of this band stands unparalleled. Despite ten years of copycat bands no one has ever managed to outdo Revenge... and if this record is any indication, perhaps no one ever will. Scum.Collapse.Eradication earns my highest recommendation.\n\nStandout tracks: \"Parasite Gallows (In Line)\", \"Pride Ruination (Division Collapse)\", \"Scorned Detractor (Trust No One)\"\n\nReview by vorfeed: http;//www.vorfeed.net\n\nRevenge do not fuck around.\n\nThere are a countless number of truly brutal, truly unhinged bands out there, but few can match the napalm-and-vomit that this Canadian duo spew from every orifice. It's all this band know how to do: belch out disgusting abominations that stink of death. Scum.Collapse.Eradication is no different in this regard from any previous Revenge album... in any way.\n\nI know, I know. Revenge are \"trve\" and \"real.\" Shit like musical progression and exploration are for \"posers\" and the \"untrve.\" And in many ways that's fine. Some bands find a sound, and stick with it. They make music they want to make for fans who don't want them to change. It's a perfectly harmonious atrocity that never comes off the rails or slows down. Devastation by the numbers; comforting genocide... dependable hatred for humanity. All of this I can understand and even appreciate.\n\nThat doesn't mean I can get all the way behind it. Scum.Collapse.Eradication is the definition of competent, and at times elevates itself above it's station. \"Parasite Gallows(In Line)\" is a crusty slice of Carcass-inspired deathgrind, with completely unhinged guitar solos to boot, that mixes in a heavy dose of Archgoat-style mid paced riffing that does not fail to crush spines. \"Filth Solution(Intolerance)\" makes maximum use of the pitch-shifted gutturals(lifted right from Reek of Putrefaction) to create a swampy mess of distorted grindcore riffs and Blasphemy-infused hatred. All the stuff you expect from Revenge is here. Which is nice...\n\nBut it begs the question, a question I have been finding myself asking a lot lately. Do all bands lend themselves to multiple releases? How many Nile albums do you have to buy before you've gotten enough of the same... exact... sound. Or Amon Amarth? Or Hate Eternal? For most people, including myself, the answer is one(except for Amon Amarth... closer to zero). Revenge are in the same boat. Fact is, if you own any of the previous Revenge albums, then you have already listened to Scum.Collapse.Eradicate. You already have experienced this punishing whirlwind of savagery and blast beats. Which is not to say the album is worthless, and I find this album has my favorite production of all the Revenge albums. It's fun and aggressive and heavy. It's a whole lot of things, most of them good.\n\nBut all of them have been done before. So yes, Revenge do not fuck around. Scum.Collapse. Eradicate is deadly serious in every way. It's all about the murder, the mayhem and the hatred... and nothing else.\n\nRating: 6.5/10\n\nOriginally posted at http://curseofthegreatwhiteelephant.blogspot.com/\n\nRevenge is a Canadian black metal band. Or should I say, bestial black metal. Bestial black metal, to those unfamiliar with the term, is a sub-genre of the black metal sub-genre that features elements from thrash and death, and was pioneered by the likes of Blasphemy, also Canadian. It's usually fast, brutal, and full of black rage and hatred. If you've heard any other release by Revenge, then you'll find absolutely no surprises here. But it's a good thing, really. There are always bands that expand the boundaries of the genre, but not many bands actually pull it off well. Revenge does.\n\nSpewing vitriol in a vehement take on blackened death with a punky edge, accompanied with vocals that sound like a pack of wolves gnawing ravenously at a pillow. Anti-human riffs and odd (or nonexistant) structures that occasionaly burst into random solos with insane and relentless blast beats, this is nihilistic rage personified. You'll find no difference in the songs here, as they're usually the same merciless skirmishes on your aural temples. After a couple of listens, though, you'll somehow tell each song apart, whether by a small riff here, or a noisy bit there. That's irrelevant though; one does not simply listen to bestial black metal for the songwriting. One listens to it because he likes his metal raw, noisy, inexorable, and blasphemous to the bone. This album doesn't sound like it's eight different songs, but a single assault on everything you know. The only track that stands out here is \"Scorned Detractor (Trust No One),\" for some reason.\n\nSo if you don't like chaotic walls of noises full of rabid dogs barking as they gnaw your flesh while wardrums play to the sound of an army marching towards a peaceful village to rape and pillage, don't waste your time on this. You'll just get mad at people. But if you do like incoherent blitzkriegs, anything Revenge has done up to this point, any other bestial black metal band has done, listen to this."
