In this song, Claude\n\nS. repeatedly sings \"My heart is on fire... my soul will burn\" --\n\nwhich seems alarmingly similar to JD's Heart and Soul (\"Heart and\n\nsoul... one will burn\").\n\n(Sean Ercanbrack) writes:\n\n>Here are a couple of things I've been wondering about maybe you have been\n\n>wondering about these things too:\n\n>*Aside from the Happy Mondays and theStereo MC's, can anyone think of any\n\n>other bands influenced by New Order?

Robert Smith (the Cure) has said (on more than one occassion)\n\nthat Closer is his favorite album of all time. Ian McCullogh (E&TB) has also\n\ncited JD as his biggest influence in the early days. Question is are these\n\nGothic bands. Many would argue not.\n\n>*Aside from Iggy Pop and the Stooges, Kraftwork, and the Sex Pistols, are\n\n>there any other groups that have influenced the band?\n\nThe Velvet Underground.\n\nThat all my brain can offer today.\n\nLater.\n\nPeace, love & NewOrder\n\nAEJ ajo...@mustang.uwo.ca\n\nSean Ercanbrack (CYW...@prodigy.com) wrote:\n\n: Here are a couple of things I've been wondering about maybe you have been\n\n: wondering about these things too:\n\n: *Aside from the Happy Mondays and theStereo MC's, can anyone think of any\n\n: other bands influenced by New Order?

This qualifies as hearsay, I might add.\n\n>*I suppose numerous gothic bands have been influenced by Joy Division,\n\n>but does anyone know of any names of bands that admittedly have been\n\n>influenced?\n\nTrent Reznor seemed pretty intent on kissing Joy Division's behind a\n\nwhile ago, it seems. He did a (flat lousy) cover of \"Dead Souls\" for\n\nthe soundtrack to \"The Crow\", and let's not forget the title of his\n\nbig hit. . .\n\n>* Does anyone have any additional information about The Stiff Kittens?\n\n>Didn't Warsaw get announced under the name and changed from The Stiff\n\n>Kittens to Warsaw, just as they got on stage to play?\n\nI recall reading in some biography of the band that \"the Stiff\n\nKittens\" was just a way of referring to the band in the days before\n\nthey came up with the name Warsaw.\n\nI know they changed to Joy Division because they didn't want to be\n\nconfused with Warsaw Pact, though.\n\nOn 4 Jul 1996, Sami Rainisto wrote:\n\n> In article <Pine.OSF.3.91.960701094419.32413A-100000@leofric>,\n\n> ccx...@coventry.ac.uk says...\n\n> >\n\n> >On 27 Jun 1996, Sami Rainisto wrote:\n\n> >\n\n> >> Lightning Seeds are a NewOrder ripoff.\n\n> >\n\n> >Are you on drugs??\n\n>\n\n> Of course I am (hell, who ISN'T?) but Lightning Seeds are still a\n\n> NewOrder ripoff.

So how you can say\n\nthey're a rip off is beyond me. You obviously didnt know what NO sounded\n\nlike back then.\n\nLightning Seeds....I happen to think there music sh*t hot and again does not\n\nsound f**k all like NO\n\nNirvana..? I dont particularly like them, so cant really comment on that one,\n\nbut from what i have heard...still nothin' like NO\n\nOasis.....
