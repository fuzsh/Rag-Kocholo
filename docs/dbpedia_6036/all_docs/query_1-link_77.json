        "text": "As we've reported this evening, Foreign Secretary David Lammy is heading to Israel for talks with the country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIsrael, Qatar, Egypt, and the US are all currently engaged in ceasefire talks in Doha as they try to de-escalate the situation in the Middle East.\n\nWhile the UK is not directly involved in the talks today, Sir Keir Starmer and the Westminster government is still working to try to lower the temperature in the region.\n\nOver the weekend, Sir Keir picked up the phone and rang Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian - urging him to \"de-escalate and avoid further regional confrontation\", according to Downing Street.\n\nBut the president rejected that, saying retaliation against Israel is a \"right\", according to an Iranian news agency, with Israel an \"aggressor\".\n\nStarmer's top ministers on diplomatic offensive\n\nElsewhere, the likes of Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Defence Secretary John Healey have both been engaged in diplomatic efforts.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Lammy met with the Saudi foreign minister in London - where the pair discussed working together towards de-escalation, a ceasefire, and a release of hostages.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia and Iran have had sometimes complicated relations, Riyadh still wields significant influence in the Middle East.\n\nMr Healey, meanwhile, spoke to US defence secretary Lloyd Austin yesterday, with the pair discussing the \"urgent need for restraint and de-escalation\" in the Middle East.\n\nBy Alex Crawford, special correspondent in Beirut, camera Jake Britton, specialist producer Chris Cunningham and Lebanon producer Jihad Jineid\n\nLebanon is preparing for all-out war even as the Gaza ceasefire talks begin.\n\nWe joined the Lebanese health minister, Firas Abiad, as he toured hospitals to see their disaster plans and hear about their preparations for a potential major emergency.\n\n\"Part of what we are doing is to make sure our hospitals are ready to receive patients and casualties and plans are enacted in these different regions if there is a large number of internally displaced population,\" the minister told us.\n\nHe said they'd identified key centres for mass evacuations and tried to bolster the nation's health infrastructure despite already depleted government funds due to a string of recent crises.\n\nThese include the coronavirus pandemic, an economic collapse and the huge explosion at Beirut Port four years ago. The country can ill-afford a war right now.\n\nBut most people in Lebanon that we spoke to are increasingly pessimistic about the prospect of a resolution to the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nThe country's collective blood pressure went up several notches with the twin assassinations of key Hamas and Hezbollah leaders in Tehran and Beirut about a fortnight ago.\n\nIran and Hezbollah are blaming Israel for both bombings, although Israel has neither denied nor confirmed it was responsible for the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nSince then, the Iranian Supreme Leader and the head of Hezbollah have both vowed revenge on Israel.\n\nIf retaliation is carried out as promised, the Lebanese people are bracing themselves for another round of Israeli attacks and anticipating the cycle of violence to continue.\n\nMany of the country's doctors and nurses have been given extra training to cope with war injuries which they may not ordinarily have much widespread experience in - injuries such as bullet wounds, traumatic amputations and catastrophic bleeding caused by bomb blasts and shrapnel.\n\n\"We are scared,\" one young nurse told us. \"Of course, we are all scared. We don't know what is going to happen.\"\n\nThe disaster planning has been going on for the past month - building up a nationwide stockpile of medicines in case there's a sea and air blockade.\n\nThe health minister told us: \"In past wars like in 2006 (when Israel and Hezbollah were involved in a 34-day conflict) our airport was bombed and our ports blockaded, so we've been building up stores in case this happens. I believe we have enough for about four months.\"\n\nAt the Mazboud Government Hospital in Mazboud city in Aley Governate, about a half hour's drive out of the capital, the hospital administrator told us the main priority has been planning for a swift evacuation if the hospital itself is attacked.\n\n\"We can evacuate the hospital in about a half hour,\" Shadi Hanouni told us. \"We think if there's a war, Israel will attack us here.\n\n\"They don't treat anything differently, whether it is a hospital or a school, they just attack everything.\"\n\nHe went on to say: \"All the hospital staff are worried. They don't know if theyâ€™ll be able to return to their homes if there's war, or if they will stay here for 24 hours all the time. But they are ready for it.\"\n\nThe streets are noticeably less busy, with many families retreating to mountain areas they view as safer.\n\nMultiple embassies - including Britain's - have warned their citizens to leave the country or not to travel to Lebanon. Several airlines have restricted their flights for a period, with some cancelling them altogether.\n\nWater supply shops are reporting an increase in sales of up to 10% as residents stockpile water.\n\nBut for the poor, who live from day to day, there are few options.\n\nAli Zangar who earns a small living picking up garbage, said: \"The rich can afford to leave the country. It's only the poor like us who will be left behind if there's war.\"\n\nPost-war plans when it comes to the war in Gaza \"are more appropriate for a galaxy far, far away\", an expert has told Sky News.\n\nAaron David Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former state department Middle East analyst, said traditionally negotiations in the Middle East have only two speeds \"slow and slower\".\n\nMr Miller said the problem with any negotiation is \"urgency\" and \"that's been the problem all along\".\n\nHe said he was \"pessimistic\" about what would come as the final objectives of Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar were \"irreconcilable\".\n\n\"Sinwar will keep the hostages, even if he agrees to a limited phase one release, he'll keep the 40 or 50 males until he gets what he wants which is a permanent cessation of hostilities,\" the expert said.\n\n\"Netanyahu I know will not agree to that.\"\n\nMr Miller said all of the post-war plans \"frankly right now are more appropriate for a galaxy far, far away rather than the realities back here on planet Earth when it comes to Gaza\".\n\n\"Hamas is going to survive - possibly as an insurgency - but with enough political influence to have a major say with who or what governs Gaza,\" he said.\n\nMr Miller said the talks could lead to a break in the battlefield but it would hard.\n\n\"But again, if you could get six weeks of ceasefire coming out of Doha, it would be a minor miracle. It'd be a miracle actually,\" he added.\n\nHe also said if he was to take a guess he would \"suggest that by the end of August, you could imagine an agreement that would move us through phase one - that would be a cessation of hostilities and limited hostage release.\n\nMr Miller also said it would be \"hard for him to imagine\" either side would be able to move beyond that."
