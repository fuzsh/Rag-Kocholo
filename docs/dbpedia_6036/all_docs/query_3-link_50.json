        "text": "\"Sugaan Essena\" was a song by the band The Agasar.[1] Cal Kestis listened to it via a device[3] similar to the headset[4] by 14 BBY, during his ship-scrapping time under the Scrapper Guild's employment on the planet Bracca. Kestis later recognized the band that performed the song while he was forced to fight in the gladiator arena of the Haxion Brood at Ordo Eris.[3]\n\nThis section of the article assumes 100% game completion of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Any alternate stories may be noted in the \"Behind the scenes\" section. The events in this section may or may not have been confirmed as canon.\n\nIn 9 BBY, Kestis purchased the song from the merchant Doma Dendra at Dendra's Antiquities on the planet Koboh using priorite and gave it to music producer Ashe Javi and the DJ droid DD-EC. The musicians then used the song in their setlist at Pyloon's Saloon.[1]\n\nAssumption ends here.\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nA segment of the song is first heard in the opening scenes of the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. It was created by Mongolian band The Hu, and performed in an original Star Wars language specifically for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The language was devised, with guidance from the game creators, by The Hu, who took inspiration from the power of Eternal Blue Sky and its relation to power in Star Wars, while incorporating other aspects of Mongolian culture into their band's style.[6]\n\n\"Sugaan Essena\" means \"The Black Thunder.\" The song is about a warrior's heart and spirit as the power of thunder, a quality that Cal Kestis possesses.[7]\n\nOn February 18, 2020, Electronic Arts released a music video on YouTube that featured the band performing an extended cut of the song not featured in the game.[6]\n\nOn February 2, 2022, the band released their sophomore album \"Rumble of Thunder\" which includes a Mongolian version of the song, named \"Black Thunder\".[8] An additional version with added lyrics in English—featuring Serj Tankian and Daniel \"DL\" Laskiewicz from the band Bad Wolves—was released on March 30, 2023.[9]\n\nIn the 2023 video game Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, the song is purchasable at Doma Dendra's shop in Rambler's Reach Outpost on Koboh, costing players three priorite. If players have recruited Ashe Javi and DD-EC, they can then play the song in Pyloon's Saloon.[1]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (First appearance)\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor\n\nSources[]\n\n(First identified as \"Sugaan Essena\", simultaneous with )\n\nNotes and references[]\n\n[]\n\nHow Mongolian Band the Hu made a song for 'Star Wars' in an alien language on Revolver (February 18, 2020) (archived from the original on March 7, 2020)\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor songs\n\nSongs \"Ebon Flow\" · \"Spiceman\" · \"High Waves\" · \"Sublime Raid II\" · \"Eseerin Vasahina\" · \"Shortpaw's Dance\"\n\n\"Zanara\" · \"Meet Me at the Sabacc Table\" · \"Ground Pulse\" · \"Hohochu\" · \"Rumble Droid\" · \"Who Mourns for Taris?\"\n\n\"Fields of Dusk\" · \"Revisit Waters\" · \"Eerin Siinaa\" · \"Sugaan Essena\" See also: Songs\n\n[edit]\n\nSongs\n\nIntroduced in Episode IV \"Mad About Me\" · \"Dune Sea Special\" \"Christmas in the Stars\" album Introduced in Episode VI \"Lapti Nek\" · \"Jedi Rocks\" · \"Ewok Celebration\" (\"Yub Nub\") Introduced in Holiday Special \"Light the Sky on Fire\" · \"Goodnight, But Not Goodbye\" · \"This Minute Now\" · \"A Day to Celebrate\" Introduced in Droids, Ewoks, and Star Tours \"In Trouble Again\" · \"Ewoks\" · \"Friends Together, Friends Forever\" · \"The Droid Rooms\" Introduced in Republic Commando, The Old Republic, and Galaxy's Edge Vode An · \"Clones\" · The Old Republic · Galaxy's Edge Introduced in sequel trilogy \"Jabba Flow\" · \"Dobra Doompa\" · \"Lido Hey\" Introduced in Anthology Series, LEGO Holiday Special, and LEGO Terrifying Tales \"Chicken in the Pot\" · \"Stormtrooper JP-054 Karaoke\" · \"Joh Blastoh\" · \"Whirlee Moova Dee Bonkee\" Introduced in Battlefront II, Jedi: Fallen Order, Visions, and Jedi: Survivor \"Ma Kapar\" · \"Sugaan Essena\" · \"Galactic Dreamer\" · Jedi: Survivor See also: themes and leitmotifs\n\n[edit]"
