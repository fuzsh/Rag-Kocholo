        "text": "If the thunderous bassline that kicks off Monaco’s debut is\n\nunmistakably familiar, it’s because the world was first introduced\n\nto it in 1979, when Joy Division surfaced with “Unknown Pleasures”\n\non England’s cutting-edge Factory Records. A year later, just\n\nbefore the influential post-punk band released the landmark album\n\n“Closer,” frontman Ian Curtis hanged himself in the basement of his\n\nMacclesfield, England, home. Surviving Curtis were guitarist\n\nBernard Sumner, drummer Stephen Morris and the man behind that\n\nfamiliar bassline, Peter Hook.\n\nWith Sumner on vocals, the remaining members of Joy Division,\n\nplus Morris’ girlfriend, Gillian Gilbert, went on to record as New Order, bridging the gap between punk and synth-heavy New Wave, and in the process becoming one of the most successful and critically acclaimed proto-alternative acts. With\n\nNew Order currently in a holding pattern (they haven’t released a\n\nrecord since 1993’s “Republic”), Hook enlisted former Revenge\n\nbassist David Potts for Monaco, whose New Order-aping sound has\n\nsparked a mid-life career revival for Hook. Potts’ voice sounds as\n\nfamiliar as Hook’s bass, although it hasn’t been heard on record\n\nbefore.\n\n“I think the only time I’ve sung before Monaco is karaoke,” Potts says, sitting in\n\nA&M Records’ midtown Manhattan offices with Hook and Hook’s\n\ngirlfriend (who can’t keep their hands off of each other). “I was\n\nan altar boy once, but I didn’t have to sing.”\n\nHis voice is recognizable from New Order, a group,\n\nincidentally, that he was never even in. In fact, Potts sounds so\n\nmuch like Sumner on Monaco’s “Music For Pleasure” that it could\n\neasily be mistaken for a factory-fresh New Order album, although\n\nthe band, unsurprisingly, doesn’t see it that way.\n\n“When you got a [bass] style like Peter’s, you can play it to\n\nany old record and say it sounds like New Order,” Potts adds. “And\n\nwith my range, people say it sounds more like New Order too but\n\nwhat am I going to do, start rapping?”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nNew Order comparisons aside, the two have formed a unique\n\nmusical partnership after some time together in Revenge, Hook’s\n\nearly-’90s side project. At 26, Potts is the fresh, virginal\n\nyounger half of Monaco, while Hook, at a very healthy looking 41,\n\nprovides parental guidance.\n\n“The age difference doesn’t mean a thing really,” Potts says.\n\n“But he’s got the experience — 20 years worth of experience that\n\ndoesn’t count for s—!”\n\n“But you still don’t listen to me, do ya?” Hook retorts,\n\nlaughing.\n\nFor Hook, things have never been better. New Order never\n\nracked up as many record sales as glowing reviews, and Monaco’s\n\nmajor label deal represents quite a change from folding his own CD\n\nsleeves at an English indie label.\n\n“This is one of the only records I’ve ever made that I can\n\nactually sit and listen to,” Hook says. “Usually, the New Order\n\nrecords were so bloody angst-ridden, and there was such a black\n\ncloud over it with Factory Records and the amount of work you had\n\nto do, that you could never actually put the record on. I mean, on\n\nour first record [Joy Division‘s “Unknown Pleasures” – 1979] I\n\nhad to sit there folding the sleeves for three days and putting the\n\nrecords in and loading up 10,000 friggin’ LPs into the back of a\n\nvan. Now all of the sudden I make a record and someone just says,\n\n‘That’s a great record, would you like some coffee?'”\n\nPotts, who grew up listening to New Order, first joined up\n\nwith Hook as a sound engineer for Revenge and then became the\n\ngroup’s touring bassist during a 1991 tour of America.\n\n“When I first started working with Peter in the studio with\n\nRevenge, I was working *for* him and I didn’t necessarily know who\n\nhe was,” he recalls. “Afterwards, we were just working together as\n\nfriends.”\n\n“The iconic part of it doesn’t come into it when he’s trying\n\nto get me out of bed in the morning or trying to make something\n\nwork in the studio,” Hook adds. “I was working with David Bowie, thinking, ‘Oh God, David Bowie,\n\nhe’s a God.’ But then in the studio, I’d say, ‘Dave, are you going\n\nto run the bleeding tape or are we just sitting here wasting our\n\ntime?’ That superstar bit doesn’t really matter when it comes down\n\nto working.”\n\nTrending\n\nThe work that went into “Music for Pleasure” has already won\n\nthe band two Top 20 hits in the U.K., and Monaco’s first single,\n\n“What Do You Want From Me,” is currently sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-ing\n\nall over American radio. As for the fate of New Order, Hook is less\n\nthan optimistic."
