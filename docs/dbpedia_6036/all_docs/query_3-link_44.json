        "text": "Taylor Swift isn‚Äôt out for revenge this time around.\n\nAfter a handful of Swifties got the ‚ÄúSpeak Now (Taylor‚Äôs Version)‚Äù album a day ahead of its July 7 release, they discovered that she had changed the lyrics on her hit song ‚ÄúBetter Than Revenge.‚Äù\n\nIn the original track, which was released in 2010, Swift sings, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not a saint and she‚Äôs not what you think / she‚Äôs an actress, whoa / She‚Äôs better known for the things that she does / On the mattress, whoa.‚Äù\n\nHowever, the 33-year-old swapped out the latter part of the verse with, ‚ÄúHe was a moth to the flame / She was holding the matches, whoa.‚Äù\n\nOne fan, who got their hands on the album, posted a photo of the new lyrics on Twitter, while another user shared a short clip of the new version.\n\nThe longstanding rumor is that Swift wrote the song about actress Camilla Belle, who dated Joe Jonas directly after the Grammy winner.\n\nYet, now that the exes are on good terms, it appears Swift is looking to make amends with Jonas‚Äô former flame.\n\nHowever, fans had a mixed reaction to the change given the fact they‚Äôve been screaming the same, albeit problematic, lyrics for over a decade.\n\n‚ÄúWe miss brutal Taylor where she hated everyone but lover era Taylor assassinated her,‚Äù one fan wrote.\n\n‚ÄúI thought I was gonna stream the original if she changed the lyrics. But now I don‚Äôt know. Like I know she only did this to please people. And I want to support her fully. But I love the original so so much üò≠,‚Äù another added.\n\n‚Äúpathological people pleaser,‚Äù a third tweeted, referring to Swift‚Äôs song ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Losing Me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to sing the original line over this line every single time. This moth to a flame line does not and will never exist to me,‚Äù a disappointed fan chimed in.\n\nYet others were thrilled by the change, praising Swift for rejecting her past internalized misogyny.\n\nFor more Page Six you love‚Ä¶\n\nListen to our weekly ‚ÄúWe Hear‚Äù podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n‚ÄúThis is why I love her. She almost always does the right thing,‚Äù someone else tweeted. ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt encourage slut shaming over here.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs better now, we won,‚Äù another stated.\n\n‚ÄúI think that was the right call shrug ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èyou can‚Äôt say you regret doing something and then profit of [sic] it again üòÖ,‚Äù one fan noted. ‚ÄúPlus there really is no downside, fans who like the stolen version can still listen to that and taylor can put something out that she is proud of.‚Äù\n\nWhile some fans might not agree with Swift‚Äôs decision, the ‚ÄúAll Too Well‚Äù songstress hinted in an interview with The Guardian that she regretted making the jab.\n\n‚ÄúI was 18 when I wrote that,‚Äù she explained in 2014. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the age you are when you think someone can actually take your boyfriend. Then you grow up and realize no one take someone from you if they don‚Äôt want to leave.‚Äù\n\nSwift has been re-recording her first six albums after now-rival Scooter Braun purchased her master recordings in 2019.\n\nAt the time, Swift denied having had any opportunity to buy her music back ‚Äî claiming Braun and Scott Borchetta, the former head of Big Machine Records, went behind her back."
