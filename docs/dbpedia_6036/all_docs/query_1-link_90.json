        "text": "John “Rhino” Edwards is probably better known as being the bass player in a small band by the name of Status Quo who have had a moderate amount of success for over 40 years.\n\nThe new album II arrived at AATR towers with absolutely no fanfare, no press release or anything.\n\nNot knowing what to expect we put it on the sound system in the office & cranked the hell out of it.\n\nWhat followed was just shy of 50 minutes of really eclectic music & provided everyone who was listening to a mile wide shit eating grin.\n\nHis bass prowess in Quo is widely regarded & quite rightly too. It’s his cheekie chappy vocal style that is the big surprise here.\n\nEvery track on this album has something different which makes this album such a joy to listen to.\n\nFrom the Blues soaked opener Tomorrow is Today, the Eminem sounding All The Girls Love A Bastard to the full on rocker that is Secretary.\n\nIt showcases that John is not only just a shuffle boogie wonder but has a lot more to offer besides.\n\nThis would be the perfect summer album. It’s a pity it’s being released at the tale end of it & that’s the only downside of this record.\n\nIt’s the kind of album that you can imagine being cranked up on Brighton Beach.\n\nProduced by Mike Paxman, best known for his work with Judie Tzuke, Nick Kamen, Uriah Heep , Status Quo, and Asia. It’s stripped back & has a live feel about it.\n\nLyrically the album is full of misogyny, humor, social comment & a song about a dog (Stan The Man).\n\nVideo courtesy of Andreas yeti\n\nIt actually doesn’t get much better than this & whoever said humor doesn’t belong in music really is TALKING BOLLOCKS\n\nOne of the very few albums I’ve heard this year that I wish was longer.\n\nRhino’s Revenge II is released on Friday October 23rd.\n\nNot just for fans of Quo (although completeists will obviously be purchasing) but if you want a good time eclectic rock n roll album then this is a must.\n\n01 Tomorrow Is Today.\n\n02 Famous.\n\n03 New New New.\n\n04 All the Girls Love A Bastard.\n\n05 Powerplay.\n\n06 Secretary.\n\n07 Cougar.\n\n08 My Name Is Stan.\n\n09 Busy Doing Nothin’.\n\n10 One Note Blues.\n\n11 Black Widows.\n\n12 Take ‘Em Down.\n\nScore 8.5\n\nJohn ‘Rhino’ Edwards: Vocals, Bass\n\nFreddie Edwards: Lead Guitar\n\nMax Edwards: Drums\n\nMatthew Starritt: Rhythm Guitar, Vocals, Harp"
