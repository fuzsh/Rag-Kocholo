If you tell me you are into music, I will take that at face value. And then I will ask you a few questions to see if you’re telling me the truth.\n\nIn the same way that good music must say something, make you feel something, form the soundtrack of your life, or change the world, I want your answers to have conviction.

And I’ll be able to tell if you make these answers up on the spot.\n\n(Click here for Part 2 of this and a whole new set of questions)\n\nWhat kind of music do you like?\n\nI can’t bear it when someone tells me that they are into everything. Even worse is “everything, except country”. I am sorry for your singular bias against one particular genre, especially since that one has a lot of greatness to it. But you really can’t like everything. At least not if we will…"
