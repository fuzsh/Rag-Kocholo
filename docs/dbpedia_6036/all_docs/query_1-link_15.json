The band is comprised of Justin Warfield (vocals, guitar, keyboards) and Adam Bravin (bass, keyboards). Accompaniment members Thomas Froggatt (guitar) and Scott Ellis (drums) join them on stage. The band have released three albums: “She Wants Revenge” (2006), “This is Forever” (2007) and “Valleyheart” (2011)\n\nShe Wants Revenge’s music is hard to encompass into a single genre or sound. It draws inspiration from several alternative rock and new wave artists. The band blends their influences with ever-present electronics (eg. synths and drum machines) in a style most accurately labelled under the umbrella term “darkwave”, a style of music reminiscent of the New Wave and Gothic Rock sounds of the 1980s. She Wants Revenge have stated that they make “dance music” on numerous occasions setting them aside from the contemporary rock bands often falsely linked with the band in the music press.\n\nTear You Apart [directed by Joaquin Phoenix]\n\nHistory\n\nTheir self-titled debut, was released in 2006. They contributed a cover of ‘Kidnap the Sandy Claws‘ to the soundtrack of the “The Nightmare Before Christmas” re-release.\n\nTheir next LP release, ‘This Is Forever’ was released in 2007. They also were featured on a track ‘Time’, with Timbaland.\n\nOn 27th February 2008, She Wants Revenge parted ways with Geffen/Interscope to run their own record label called Perfect Kiss Records, from which they released an EP titled ‘Save Your Soul’. A second EP followed in 2009, titled “Up and Down”, which was released on the 22nd of September.\n\nFestival tickets:\n\nTickets for 2019 are on sale and SELLING FAST!

The vocal range is rather similar to that of Ian Curtis and comparisons are inevitable, but inaccurate.\n\nAmongst the dark-rock influences there are also clearly electronic influences in this track and the rest of the album. So, not so much Joy Division, more New Order then…\n\n‘Kiss Me’ is addictive, but terribly cheesy – and this is pretty much the summary of the album. It’s a mix between Editors style dark-indie-stadium-rock pomp…\n\nStill, it does stand up well amongst its peers. The duo have a swagger and songs to back it up. Also, they’ve previously said that they’re not Dark Wave, but are in fact “dancey rock n roll” hmm… there’s another famous scene band tries that one also…\n\n– Miranda Yardley @ Terrorizer (read the full article here)\n\nFestival tickets:\n\nTickets for 2019 are on sale and SELLING FAST!
