The darkness does possess a certain beauty. I hope I get to see them live again.\n\nHuntington Beach, CA@\n\nHuntington State Beach\n\nChristmas\n\nNovember 15th 2022\n\nAmazing performance by an amazing band at an amazing venue! The band mentioned they had performed at this venue several times over the years and it was clear how comfortable they were. This was my first time seeing them live and as a fan of many years, I was not disappointed. Justin was really interactive and brought a ton of energy. It was a seamless performance that seemed to wash over you. At first they left immediately after their last song and let us cheer for a while before they came out for their encore. I wish the crowd had had a little more energy honestly, but to be fair it was a Wednesday night. Everyone was very friendly too! I'll definitely see SWR again.\n\nJersey City, NJ@\n\nWhite Eagle Hall\n\nNovember 14th 2022\n\nSounds was amazing in this small, intimate venue. My only complaint was the stage lighting. It was all very dark which i guess is on brand for them, but would have been nice to have it brighter on the stage. All in all, so happy to see these guys after being a fan for so many years. They did not disappoint.\n\nLondon, ON@\n\nRum Runners\n\nMorgan\n\nNovember 7th 2022\n\nThey seemed kind of bored, or going through the motions (other than the drummer!!), but the overall performance itself was great. I’ve loved these guys for decades and wasn’t disappointed, being able to meet them was great too. They were really nice, friendly, and accommodating. These dudes deserve more, so maybe that’s why they seemed so calm and subdued (the venue was tiny, crowded, and very poorly ran)—but the performance was professional and nearly flawless.\n\nColumbus, OH@\n\nRumba Cafe\n\nViolet\n\nAugust 23rd 2022\n\nThis was hands down one of the best concerts I’ve ever been to! I also loved when Justin reprimanded this annoying guy for moshing and making people uncomfy. Fuckin love Justin Warfield\n\nEnglewood, CO@\n\nGothic Theatre\n\nAlysse\n\nAugust 20th 2022\n\nLoved the show. It was the perfect venue for the crowd and bands. Sound was great. We really enjoyed it and hope they come back through soon!\n\nSalt Lake City, UT@\n\nUrban Lounge\n\nDave\n\nDecember 16th 2019\n\nVenue had an amp fail, band went acoustic, and kept going while the techs went next door and borrowed an amp and installed it. Band finished the show and played some extra. Great experience! Thank you to She Wants Revenge and the staff at Andy's Bar for a great display of professionalism!\n\nDenton, TX@\n\nAndy's Bar & Grill\n\nLaurie\n\nJuly 2nd 2019\n\nAmazing show from start to finish! She Wants Revenge were bloody fantastic!!! The opening acts were really good and if you’ve never been to Terminal West, check it out!\n\nAtlanta, GA@\n\nTerminal West\n\nChloe\n\nJuly 1st 2019\n\nIt was amazing finally seeing Justin and Adam in concert! I've loved their music since I was in middle school! I'm so glad they came to Durham❤️\n\nDurham, NC@\n\nMotorco Music Hall\n\nTom\n\nJune 27th 2019\n\nFirst time seeing these guys. Everything sounded fantastic! Fun interactions with the crowd. Their opener, MXMS was also awesome! Skyloft is a great venue for this kind of music.\n\nAlbany, NY@\n\nSkyloft NY\n\nKara\n\nJune 4th 2019\n\nThe concert was AMAZING!!! But the venue was beyond ridiculous HOT!!!! And when I say HOT I mean I literally sat and sweated in a venue that should have WAY better A/C than they had! I wanted to dance but myself and other patrons were dripping in sweat and to HOT to move. Absolutely LOVE the venue but the A/C issue was straight POO!\n\nGainesville, FL@\n\nHigh Dive\n\nJake\n\nNovember 30th 2018\n\nOmg just amazing! Dream come true. Had my woman was a much much added bouns. Lit the crowd! Expensive damn good drinks. Warrior rm (upstairs) packed but wicked! 🖤🖤🖤🖤\n\nSan Antonio, TX@\n\nAztec Theatre\n\nRobert\n\nNovember 4th 2018\n\nThe sound was nearly perfect. Guitars level was a tad low. It was the bass’ time to shine this night. All in all it was a great time.\n\nSan Antonio, TX@\n\nPaper Tiger\n\nSamantha\n\nNovember 1st 2018\n\nThe venue is beautiful and much bigger than expected and She Wants Revenge was everything I was hoping for and more. The opening band, who was performing for the last time was fabulous and very nice local guys. I got to meet both bands and got both merchandise, signatures and pictures. It was the greatest birthday gift I’ve ever given myself ❤️\n\nRichmond, VA@\n\nThe Broadberry\n\nChristina\n\nOctober 22nd 2018\n\n😍 Sooooooooo good! OMG they played Broken Girl!! Thank you to whoever made that request! Love love Justin and Adam! I see a lot of concerts and I’ve never seen so many people singing all the lyrics to every single song! Sooooooooo good! 😍\n\nChicago, IL@\n\nMetro\n\nSean\n\nOctober 20th 2018\n\nAwesome show all around including amazing openers of Dead Orchids (Denver band) and Mykki Blanco who blew everyone's minds. She Wants Revenge was fantastic as always and seemed to love the super fun crowd at one of Denver's most intimate venues.\n\nDenver, CO@\n\nThe Oriental Theater\n\nJeff\n\nOctober 7th 2018\n\nAwesome amazing show. Band members hung out amongst the crowd and were very personable. Great show all around with quality opening acts too.\n\nPortland, OR@\n\nRevolution Hall\n\nCharles\n\nMay 26th 2018\n\nSecond Time I’ve seen She Wants Revenge at A&R Music Bar Columbus, OH 5/25/18! Great Band! Justin & Adam signed a set list for me! Wish they had their CD available at the Merch table!\n\nColumbus, OH@\n\nA&R Music Bar\n\nJodi\n\nJuly 19th 2017\n\nBand sounded great! Haven't seen them since they played with Placebo at the Greek in Los Angeles. This was much smaller and more intimate.\n\nWest Palm Beach, FL@\n\nRespectable Street\n\nJaime\n\nOctober 12th 2016\n\nSWR Live was a blast. Powerful in their presence with a beautifully intimate energy that surged through the crowd. I will always see them live when I can, especially in Seattle.\n\nSeattle, WA@\n\nThe Showbox\n\nView More Fan Reviews\n\nShe Wants Revenge is an American darkwave/rock band hailing from Los Angeles, California and formed in 2005. The band is comprised of lead members Justin Warfield and Adam 12 and by accompaniment members TommySheWants and Scott Ellis.\n\nThey were signed by Fred Durst to his interscope imprint flawless records. However, as of Feb. 27th, 2008, She Wants Revenge now run their own record label called perfect kiss records.\n\nShe Wants Revenge draws inspiration from various bands including Bauhaus, Depeche Mode, New Order and The Sisters of Mercy. She Wants Revenge have been compared to Joy Division and Interpol in the music press. The latter of which is understandable as both bands draw influence from the baritone vocal range of Ian Curtis.\n\nThe band released two albums, first was the self-titled album, which hit the stores in 2006. 'This Is Forever' was the next album, which was released in 2007. The band toured with Depeche Mode and Placebo during 2006. They contributed to the track 'Kindnap the Sandy Claws' which was released in the compilation 'The Nightmare Before Christmas Soundtrack' in 2006. Next year, in 2007, She Wants Revenge was featured on the track 'Time', with Timbaland.\n\nShe Wants Revenge is just the latest twist in a long, varied career for Justin Warfield. Starting out as a Prince Paul-produced rapper, Warfield went on to form The Justin Warfield Supernaut, playing an LSD-fueled take on poppy grunge. From there Warfield moved on to the uk and formed One Inch Punch with Gianni Garofalo (a member of the Supernaut). One Inch Punch's twisted take on lo-fi scuzz grunge was topped with laconic rap from Warfield. Their biggest hit came with Pretty Piece of Flesh from the William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet movie soundtrack. Warfield and Garofalo's next move was back to LA and was in a more alt-rock direction with crossover act Tape, whose incredibly powerful sound never made it further than a couple of EPs. Somewhere between all those records, Warfield found time to perform guest vocal duties on a wide range of material including Bomb the Bass's seminal Bug Powder Dust and album tracks for Placebo and the The Chemical Brothers. She Wants Revenge sees Warfield alongside his musical partner Adam12 tackling the most successful sound of his career to date.\n\nShow More"
