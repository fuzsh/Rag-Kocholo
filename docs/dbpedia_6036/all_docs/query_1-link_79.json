        "text": "If you went to school during the 1980s you'll remember the characteristics that marked out the nerds. They wore drainpipe trousers, had an unhealthy fascination with the works of Tolkien and were accomplished players of Advanced Dungeons And Dragons. More significantly, they sported long, shaggy, faintly greasy hairdos that identified them as fans of the music that dared not speak its name: stadium rock.\n\nThose maligned souls have spent years metaphorically lurking behind the science huts in order to avoid ridicule. But now it appears they're stepping out of the shadows and taking their revenge.\n\nLook at the evidence. Style magazines are littered with moody models in drainpipes; Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings movies are being heralded as cinematic masterpieces; why, even the Guardian recently ran a feature on the return of the white sock.\n\nAnd most shockingly of all, the most talked about rock band in Britain today are a shaggy-haired quartet who have vowed to reawaken the yelping, star-jumping, guitarlicking spirit of classic stadium rock. They wear catsuits, theatrical make-up and moustaches. Their ambition is to see Wembley Stadium rebuilt and named in their honour. They even include a drummer who proudly declares over a pint in a King's Cross pub: \"I won first prize for lead-miniature painting at Lowestoft Model Fair.\"\n\nThey are the Darkness, and they're here to rock your world. It's been a while since a rock band has stimulated such debate, excitement or confusion. Dazed & Confused devoted 12 pages of enthusiastic eulogy to the Darkness last year, while the NME has suggested they should be killed.\n\nTwo camps have emerged: those who see the Darkness's brand of theatrical rock majesty as a much needed kick up the arse for Britain's namby-pamby, pantwetting music scene; and those who see them as one notch below Wayne's World in the history of preposterous rock spoofs.\n\n\"That's because they can't believe it,\" says guitarist Dan Hawkins. \"I think people find it hard to believe what they're actually seeing. They think there's some kind of ironic masterplan behind it but there isn't. We're just doing what we really like doing.\"\n\nMoustachioed bassist Frankie Poullain is almost incandescent at the suggestion they're anything other than the saviours of rock. \"Obviously we don't see ourselves as cheesy or we wouldn't be wasting all this time working really fucking hard to fight against the grain.\"\n\nMost people who've seen the band live will testify that they're both serious and cheesy. And rather spectacular too. When Xfm threw a Christmas party at the Marquee club they invited the Darkness to support the Libertines. The crowd was made up in equal measure of selfconsciously cool media types and slightly geeky sorts who looked as though they may have seen Whitesnake play Milton Keynes on more than one occasion.\n\nIt took Justin Hawkins - the band's lithe, long-haired and lavishly tattooed frontman - half an hour of headstands, star jumps and shrieking to work the diverse throng into a heaving mass of intoxicated disciples. Lifelong enemies of rock held their hands like devil's horns and raised them to the stage.\n\nBy the end, when a bare-chested Hawkins climbed on a crew member's shoulders and walked amid the crowd playing a guitar behind his head and singing I Believe In A Thing Called Love in a falsetto reminiscent of a dentist's drill, the crowd were bowing in euphoric worship. You can imagine how the Libertines must have felt.\n\nThe Hawkins brothers and their drumming, lead-figure painting friend Ed Graham grew up in Suffolk. They were the school nerds who \"never grew out of Aerosmith\". After school, Dan Hawkins played in numerous bands with Frankie Poullain which were \"all 1980s-influenced and all unfashionable\". They spent two years trying to find a singer who didn't want to impersonate either Liam Gallagher or Thom Yorke but to no avail.\n\nBy the turn of the century they'd almost decided to give up on their musical careers. Then, on New Year's Eve 1999, Dan and Justin's aunt threw a party at her pub in Norfolk. Justin embraced the karaoke machine she'd set up with gusto, wowing the revellers with an all-singing, all-dancing rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody. Dan was astounded and the Darkness was born.\n\n\"Our first gig was at a friend's funeral,\" says Dan sombrely. Were they less flamboyant than they've since become? \"No,\" deadpans Justin. \"It was a full-on rock assault.\" From the outset they resolved to defy fashion and submit to their instinctive love of excess rawk. \"People kept telling us to tone it down,\" says Dan. \"But if anything that made us go the opposite way. If someone suggested Frankie trimmed his moustache, he'd grow it longer.\"\n\nFor almost two years their bloody-mindedness got them nowhere. Only once the more diluted bands of the garage-rock scene had loosened the lid on the jar did the fickle music industry succumb to the \"full-on rock assault\" of the Darkness. With their first album just completed, a new single out on Monday and a tour with Def Leppard already under way, the Darkness are focused on reinvigorating a music scene they believe has been lying comatose since 1989.\n\n\"None of us have bought an album by a new band in 10 years,\" says Dan. They shudder at the mention of indie. \"The difference with rock is that it's all about working hard, playing hard and showing discipline,\" asserts Poullain. \"Indie bands don't have the ability to do any of that.\"\n\nMusically, they say, bands of their nature are simply more accomplished. \"It goes with the whole uncool thing,\" explains Justin. \"You have to spend a certain amount of time in your bedroom practising your guitar. You can't hang out and be cool. That's why geeks are better musicians.\"\n\nThere are some comparisons to be made with their indie cousins. Ten years ago, the British rock charts were dominated by American acts just as they are now. Then two ambitious brothers formed a band that cleverly reinterpreted old music in a bid to reinvigorate the scene. The Darkness may not ultimately achieve the same success as Oasis but they share similarly outlandish plans for world domination. \"Once they've rebuilt Wembley and renamed it The Darkness Stadium, we'll play there and I'll be fired onstage as a human cannonball,\" explains Justin. \"I'll hit the wall, slide down and start the first track.\"\n\nIn the less distant future, fans of the band's showmanship eagerly await their first video. It will apparently involve \"Ferraris, Lamborghinis, a helicopter, a stately home, a pterodactyl and an army of kung fu experts acting out a special Darkness routine.\"\n\nBut their biggest, most sinister plan will ultimately provide vengeance for all those who wore drainpipes and read Tolkien before it was trendy. \"The crowds at our gigs now tend to be half nerds and half supermodels,\" says Poullain. \"They'll soon start breeding kids who are hyper-intelligent, very self-conscious but gorgeous with really long legs.\" \"Through our music,\" declares Justin, \"we will create a new race of supernerds.\""
