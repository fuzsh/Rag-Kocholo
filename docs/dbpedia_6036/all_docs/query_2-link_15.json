Never a dull moment.\n\nI like both but early New Order is pure genius.\n\n\"Age of Consent\" is one of the best songs ever recorded. Bliss from opening note to closing.\n\nYeah, I think NO's first couple albums + Ceremony is like the perfect fusion between the two bands.\n\nThey both serve different purposes for me. New Order is, in my opinion, technically superior but I mostly use them for background music whereas I dance to Joy Division.\n\nNot to say you couldn't interchange those two.\n\nBoth of them are two of my favorite bands, but I'm personally a bigger fan of New Order.\n\nNew Order.\n\nTechnique has a sound that I had been looking for for years.\n\nBoth are great though.\n\nBest New Order album imo. Round & Round is too good.\n\nNew Order but it's completely unacceptable to pit them against each other and you know this\n\nNo, because different strokes for different folks. Some people maybe hate an incarnation they took and have a preference for the sound of the other.\n\nYeah, I think NO's first couple albums + Ceremony is like the perfect fusion between the two bands.\n\nAgreed completely.\n\nI used to occasionally play Age of & Disorder back to back when I ran a dance party in NYC.\n\nI like both but early New Order is pure genius.\n\n\"Age of Consent\" is one of the best songs ever recorded. Bliss from opening note to closing.\n\nI agree with both especially the later, Age of Consent is GOAT tier.\n\nI like both but early New Order is pure genius.\n\n\"Age of Consent\" is one of the best songs ever recorded.

He doesn't really bother me. I mean he's not a great singer but he was put there and seems to take a \"well, someone's got to do it\" approach to vocals.\n\nMaybe we should rate the 999999 New Order side projects\n\n-Electronic\n\n-Revenge\n\n-The Other Two\n\n-Monaco\n\n-Peter Hook & the Light\n\n-I'm sure I'm forgetting like a dozen or two others\n\nNew Order are one of the best bands of the 1980s\n\nBut, despite their small catalogue, Joy Division are one of the all time greatest bands with two GOAT-tier albums (and great singles).

I have the first vinyl single pressing of it which sounds much more different than the versions you can find online on streaming services.\n\nElectronic's debut album is fantastic. Tacky in the best way possible. Weird that this is the mix of New Order and The Smiths with that tinge of Pet Shop Boys. My favourite supergroup.\n\nIt is pretty good. Although they had some decent post-debut tunes too. I always loved \"For You.\"\n\nI always knew it as BBC because I've had this particular CD since I was a wee lad. But well, Peel championed so many amazing bands, it's mindblowing. Always some of their best recordings as well at this show.\n\nThat version of Colony is my favorite JD track.\n\nAlso, everyone:\n\nWhere do I start with New Order album-wise? What's commonly regarded as their best album?\n\nWhere do I start with New Order album-wise?

I know what I'm digging into this weekend.\n\nI also have no idea why I've never really dug into New Order in all this time. I've been listening to JD for nearly 20 years.\n\nNew Order because there is so much more of it. Their discography goes through changes and evolutions since they actually had a career. I do love some Joy Division, though. I've never heard a voice quite like Ian Curtis."
