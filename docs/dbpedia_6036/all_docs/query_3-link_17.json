        "text": "There can’t always be room for forgiveness. And when the time for revenge comes knocking at your door, Billboard‘s got your soundtrack covered.\n\nThere’s been a longstanding tradition in music of using songs to get even, whether by airing out private details in tell-all lyrics or fantasizing about everything from property damage to murder. In the ambiguous worlds of pop, hip-hop, rock n’ roll and country, keying cars, smashing windows and even homicide are fair game.\n\nJust look at SZA‘s Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper “Kill Bill.” Based on its commercial success, it’s clear that millions agree there’s nothing more cathartic than daydreaming about murdering not just your former boyfriend, but his new girl, too. Or, there’s the Stevie Nicks method of penning a song so good, your ex — who just so happens to be your bandmate — has no choice but to perform it with you over and over as a constant reminder of everything he did wrong. Why move on when you can get the last laugh?\n\nThat’s definitely the mindset of many women in country music, for whom songs about unleashing your inner crazy are basically rites of passage. Even Taylor Swift has continued this tradition — set by the likes of Reba McEntire, The Chicks, Carrie Underwood and Miranda Lambert — in her post-country pop music (but more on all of those ladies later).\n\nThe point is, no matter the genre of music, and no matter the method of justice, songs about sweet revenge always hit the spot — that is, if an axe isn’t an option. Keep reading to see Billboard‘s top 25 favorites below."
