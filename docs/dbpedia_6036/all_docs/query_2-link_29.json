        "text": "Movement is the debut album by New Order, it released on 13 November 1981. It is the only New Order album to be produced by Martin Hannett. It has the FAC number of 50, continuing off Closer's FAC number of 25.\n\nBackground\n\nAfter the suicide of Ian Curtis, and the single Ceremony and it’s B-side In A Lonely Place. New Order decided to make some entirely new songs of their own, although some of them were played live in 1980, such as \"Dreams Never End\" and \"Truth\".\n\nIt was unknown who would be vocalist at the time, since Ian Curtis was the original vocalist for Joy Division. In the end Bernard Sumner was the main vocalist, with Peter Hook singing Dreams Never End, and Doubts Even Here, as well as being backup.\n\nThe album sleeve features the album's basic information between a F and a L. The F stands for \"Factory\", the record company which produced Movement, and L is the Roman numeral for 50, which is the Faction number.\n\nReception and Reviews\n\nMovement was harshly received, due to its \"lack of forward momentum\" after Ceremony.\n\nAllmusic gave it 4.5 stars saying in part of its review: \"Movement is a first hesitant step in the transition from Joy Division to New Order. After the tragic loss of Ian Curtis, the three remaining members of the former band added keyboardist Gillian Gilbert and soldiered on. Despite a relatively assured debut single (\"Ceremony,\" which didn't appear on the album), the first New Order album revealed a band understandably caught up in mourning for its former lead singer. (But of course, themes of loss and isolation were hardly novel for them.) Movement was made up of songs written just after the suicide of Ian Curtis, and it was recorded with alternating vocal spots to see whose would fit best -- although neither bassist Peter Hook nor guitarist Bernard Sumner sounded quite worthy of the mantle. Sumner wound up taking lead on all the tracks except for \"Dreams Never End\" and \"Doubts Even Here.\" At times, both vocalists' hesitancy makes it sound as if they were recording guide vocals for a Joy Division LP, expecting Ian Curtis to come in later. Despite the band's opaque lyrics, there are easily spotted references to Curtis all over the record, with despair and confusion reigning, especially on \"Senses\" (\"No reason ever was given\") and \"ICB\" (\"It's so far away, and it's closing in\"). More so than on any Joy Division record, it also revealed a group unafraid to experiment relentlessly in the studio until it had emerged with something unique. It showed, too, on tracks like the very hooky \"Dreams Never End\" or the insistently danceable \"Chosen Time,\" some of the pop smarts that would flower fully later on in their career. Spurred on by producer Martin Hannett, despite his antagonistic relationship with the band (and perhaps, because of it), New Order produced a ghostly, brittle record, occasionally uptempo but never upbeat, with drum machines rattling and echoing over dark waves of synthesizers and Hook's iconic basswork. A masterpiece in the career of any other post-punk band, Movement paled only in comparison to the band's later work.\"[1]\n\nUser ratings on Allmusic give it merely 4 stars.\n\nRobert Christgau gave it a B+: \"For months I've sworn to concentrate on the lyrics and be done with this goddamn record, but it ain't gonna happen. The singing isn't literally inaudible, but it is literally unprojected, much less noticeable than the surrounding drum, guitar, and synthesizer rhythms/effects. Very atmospheric--the spaceship as sepulcher, with a beat. And as long as I literally don't have to hear their doomy doggerel, not a bad way to go.\"[2]\n\nPitchfork gave it a 9.3/10 Sputnikmusic gave it 4 stars, and Tiny Mix Tapes gave it 5 stars.\n\nBand member Peter Hook later replied his own criticism on the album: \"We were confused musically... Our songwriting wasn't coming together. I don't know how we pulled out of that one. I actually liked Movement, but I know why nobody else likes it. It was good for the first two-and-a-half minutes, then it dipped.\" He later commented that the most important thing to come out of those sessions was that the engineers taught the band how to use sequencer machines.\n\nThe future single \"Temptation\" will not only make the album popular, but largely raise up New Order altogether.\n\nTracklist\n\nDreams Never End\n\nTruth\n\nSenses\n\nChosen Time\n\nICB\n\nThe Him\n\nDoubts Even Here\n\nDenial\n\nBonus Disc, 2008 Collectors Edition\n\nCeremony (September version)\n\nTemptation (7\")\n\nIn A Lonely Place\n\nEverything's Gone Green\n\nCries and Whispers\n\nHurt\n\nMesh\n\nCeremony (Original)\n\nTemptation (12\")\n\nDefinitive Edition bonus tracks\n\nReleased 5 April 2019\n\nDreams Never End (Western Works Demo)\n\nHomage (Western Works Demo)\n\nCeremony (Western Works Demo)\n\nTruth (Western Works Demo)\n\nAre You Ready For This?
