        "text": "Tracks on The Tortured Poets Department\n\n1. Fortnight (feat. Post Malone)\n\nTaylor appears to reference the end of her relationship with Joe Alwyn and her subsequent fling with Matty Healy in the first track on her album.\n\nThe first verse appears to hint at the end of her romance with Joe as she sings: I was supposed to be sent away but they forgot to come and get me.\n\nTaylor then wishes an ex well who betrayed her: All of this to say, I hope you're okay, but you're the reason / No one here's to blame but what about your quiet treason.\n\nIn the second verse, Taylor talks about a short-lived fling that helped her 'move on', potentially a reference to Matt.\n\nShe sings: 'All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February / I took the miracle move on drug and the effects were temporary / And I love you, it's ruining my life / I touched you for only a fortnight.'\n\n2. The Tortured Poets Department\n\nThe titular track is a shimmering melody which suggest that Taylor, modestly, doesn't see herself at the top table of tortured poets: 'You're not Dylan Thomas, and I'm not Patti Smith.'\n\nIt also appears to heavily reference her fling with Matty as she sings: 'You smokеd then ate seven bars of chocolate / We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist.\n\n'I scratch your head, you fall asleep / Like a tattooed golden retriever / But you awaken with dread.'\n\nShe also makes a candid reference to her mental health, singing: 'But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave /And I had said that to Jack about you so I felt seen'.\n\n3. My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\n\nWritten solely by Taylor, this song's dense electronic hum adds forceful notes.\n\nFans have suggested the title is a reference to the 'shiny toy she sang about in her hit Cruel Summer from the album Lover.\n\nIt's not clear if she is referring to heartbreak after splitting from Joe or the abrupt end to her romance with Matty.\n\n'Once I fix me, he's gonna miss me,' she vows, adding: 'I know I'm just repeating mysеlf Put me back on my shelf / But first, pull the string And I'll tell you that he runs Because he loves me (He loves me).'\n\n4. Down Bad\n\nTaylor references mental health again as she details how 'down' she feels without an ex and the infatuation she felt with him.\n\n'Everything comes out teenage petulance,' sings Taylor as she bitterly surveys the fallout from an old relationship.\n\nShe continues: 'Everything comes out teenage petulance / F**k it if I can't have him / I might just die, it would make no difference / Down bad, waking up in blood /Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up.\n\n'F**k it if I can't have us / I might just not get up / I might stay down bad.'\n\n5. So Long, London\n\nThe first track to be written with The National's Aaron Dessner brings a change of pace, with a lovely, choral intro. 'So long, London, you'll find someone,' sings Taylor.\n\nThe song appears to be a reference to British ex Joe and a follow up to her hit London Boy from Lover.\n\nShe references their different approaches to the end of their romance, singing in the first verse: 'I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift / Pulled him in tighter each time he was drifting away / My spine split from carrying us up the hill.'\n\nVerse three she muses: 'And you say I abandoned the ship, but I was going down with it / My white knuckle dying grip holding tight to your quiet resentment.'\n\nTaylor Swift officially dropped The Tortured Poets Department on Friday - her hotly-anticipated 11th studio album\n\n6. But Daddy I Love Him\n\n'I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want,' sings Taylor, showing wry humour as she admits to falling for the bad boys. Produced, with real brightness, by Dessner.\n\nShe goes on to revel in the fact she dismisses warning from critics, singing: 'They slammed the door on my whole world / The one thing I wanted\n\n'Now I’m running with my dress unbuttoned, / Screaming, But daddy I love him / I’m having his baby / No I’m not, but you should see your faces.'\n\n7. Fresh Out The Slammer\n\nFinger-picked acoustic guitar adds folky notes reminiscent of lockdown albums Folklore and Evermore to Fresh Out The Slammer, which details rushing into a new relationship.\n\nSeemingly a reference to her fling with Matty - who she previously dated in 2015 - she sings: 'Now pretty baby, I’m running back home to you. / Fresh out the slammer I know who my first call will be to.'\n\nOn the decay of her past relationship, she sings: 'Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter he was with her in dreams / Gray and blue and fights and tunnels, handcuffed to the spell I was under.\n\n'For just one hour of sunshine / Years of labor, locks and ceilings / In the shade of how he was feeling.'\n\n8. Florida!!! (feat. Florence + The Machine)\n\nAn album highlight, this theatrical duet with London singer Florence Welch is an uplifting song of escape – from small-town life and a bad romance.\n\nTellingly the first tour stop following her split from Joe was in Tampa, Florida and she begins her song by singing: 'You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too.\n\n'They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true / And my friends all smell like weed or little babies / And this city reeks of driving myself crazy.'\n\n9. Guilty As Sin?\n\nA tale of unrequited love, and a superb slice of 1980s-style soft rock. It even mentions The Downtown Lights, a 1989 single by Scottish band The Blue Nile.\n\nShe begins the track with her feelings on being 'trapped' in a relationship, singing: 'My boredom’s bone-deep, this cage was once just fine / Am I allowed to cry?\n\n'I dream of cracking locks, throwing my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks.'\n\nShe hints at an emotional affair providing her release, singing: 'These fatal fantasies giving way to labored breath taking all of me we’ve already done it in my head.\n\n'If it’s make-believe why does it feel like a vow we’ll both uphold somehow?”'\n\n10. Who's Afraid Of Little Old Me?\n\nBig drums, a dramatic arrangement, and more dry humour in another song penned solely by Taylor. 'You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me,' she snarls.\n\nIt's reminiscent of her hit single Look What You Made Me Do and the villain arc is prominent in her lyrics.\n\nShe sings: 'I was tame, I was gentle till the circus life made me mean /Don’t you worry folks, we took out all her teeth\n\n'Who’s afraid of little old me? Well you should be.'\n\nThis is her first new album since the end of her six-year relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn and, while she doesn't mention Alwyn by name, speculation will be rife that tracks such as So Long, London are about him. Pictured together in 2019\n\nTaylor Swift and Matty Healy seen leaving The Electric Lady studio in Manhattan on May 16, 2023\n\n11. I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)\n\nA moody, stripped-down number worthy of Lana Del Rey, who has also worked extensively with the song's producer, Jack Antonoff.\n\nShe appears to be referring to chain smoking, booze loving Matty, as she sings: 'The smoke cloud billows out his mouth like a freight train through a small town / The jokes that he told across the bar were revolting and far too loud.'\n\nFans had expressed their concerns when Taylor started dating The 1975 bad boy rocker and it seems her friends had the same reservations.\n\nTaylor sings: 'They shake their heads, saying, \"God help her\" when I tell ‘em he’s my man / But your good Lord doesn’t need to lift a finger / I can fix him, no really I can / And only I can.'\n\n12. loml\n\n'You said I'm the love of your life,' sings Taylor on this warm, resonant piano ballad. In a smart twist, the 'loml' ultimately becomes 'the loss of my life'.\n\nShe describes being love-bombed by an old flame, seemingly referring to Matty given their past experience.\n\nOthers have suggested the intensity of the lyrics suggest it relates to her longterm relationship with Joe.\n\nShe sings: 'I felt a glow like this, never before and never since /If you know it in one glimpse it’s legendary.\n\n'You and I go from one kiss to getting married / Still alive, killing time at the cemetery / Never quite buried.'\n\n13. I Can Do It With A Broken Heart\n\nMore 1980s influences on an electronic pop track that sees Taylor vowing to remain a trouper, despite any romantic strife.\n\nShe sings about putting on a brave face while her relationships publicly fall apart, noting: 'They said, \"Babe, you gotta fake it till you make it,\" and I did.\n\n'Lights, camera, b***h, smile / Even when you wanna die / He said he'd love me all his life / But that life was too short / Breaking down, I hit the floor / All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting more.'\n\nTaylor has previously admitted she struggled with her love live playing out so publicly and the narrative that she'd had more boyfriends than other women.\n\n14. The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\n\n'You didn't measure up in any measure of a man,' sings a disdainful Taylor on a melodramatic ballad.\n\nThe title is noteworthy, given that Matty's stature is an object of some debate. The singer previously disclosed: 'Everyone in [the 1975] is 6’4” and I’m 5’10”, so everyone thinks that I’m 5’5”.'\n\nMore recently, he addressed these short man allegations by telling a fan that he was 'sick to f***ing death of this', insisting that he is 'a big boy.'\n\nShe sings: 'And I don’t miss what we had / But could someone give a message / To the smallest man who ever lived?'\n\n15. The Alchemy\n\nNot all the songs are about heartbreak, as sporting metaphors aplenty suggest a track inspired by the singer's current boyfriend, American football star Travis Kelce.\n\n'When I touch down, call the amateurs and cut them from the team,' she sings.\n\nSpeaking about the upcoming release back in February, when he was building up to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas, Kelce said he had heard some of the songs on Taylor's latest release.\n\n'I have heard some of it and yes, it's unbelievable,' he said to reporters. 'I can't wait for her to shake up the world when it finally drops.'\n\n16. Clara Bow\n\nIt's tempting to think Taylor sees something of herself in a closing track inspired by Clara an American actress of the 1920s who lived her life in the Hollywood goldfish bowl.\n\nShe goes on to reference Stevie Nicks as she details struggling with the trappings of fame.\n\nTaylor sings: 'I'm not trying to exaggеrate / But I think I might die if I made it, die if I made it / No one in my small town thought I'd meet these suits in LA / They all want to say.'\n\nThe Alchemy: Sporting metaphors aplenty suggest a track inspired by the singer's current boyfriend, American football star Travis Kelce. Pictured at Coachella this week\n\nBonus tracks on The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\n\n17. The Black Dog\n\nThe Black Dog is also a reference to depression and lack of energy based on a demonic hellhound acting as an omen of death in English folklore and literature.\n\nAs well as the eerie lyrical meaning to the title, The Black Dog is a bar in Vauxhall, London - her ex Matt's city of birth and just a stone's throw away from Joe's hometown of Royal Tunbridge Wells in Kent.\n\nIn the song, she belts out: 'I am someone who until recent events you shared your secrets with and your location / you forgot to turn it off / And so I watch as you walk into some bar called The Black Dog...\n\n'I just don't understand how you don't miss me in The Black Dog when someone plays The Starting Line and you jump up, but she's too young to know this song that was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming.'\n\n18. Imgonnagetyouback\n\nTaylor is torn between calling things off for good or rekindling with an ex in imgonnagetyouback.\n\nEmotions are clearly running high as she sings: ‘Whether Im gonna be your wife / Or smash up your bike / I haven’t decided yet’.\n\nShe appears to reference her new romance with Travis as the song goes on, sharing: 'I can feel it coming / In the way you move / Push the reset button /We’re becoming something new.\n\n'See you got somebody else / Say I got someone else too / Even if it’s him, I'm leaving here with you.'\n\n19. The Albatross\n\nIt seems London watering holes are a theme of the album, with The Black Dog and The Bolter joining The Albatross as apparent references to venues.\n\nThe Albatross Club is a pub in Farringdon, London but also has particularly eerie significance in its meaning as a word alone.\n\nAlbatross is defined in the Britannica Dictionary as: 'A continuing problem that makes it difficult or impossible to do or achieve something. Fame has become an albatross that prevents her from leading a normal and happy life.'\n\nAdditionally, an albatross is a large white ocean bird that has very long and often black wings - which many likened to her outfit from the Grammys.\n\nTaylor is taking no prisoners in this track, referring to herself as one of the largest seabirds on Earth - famed for their giant wingspan and ability to glide seamlessly.\n\nShe sings about taking revenge with the lyrics: 'She is here to destroy you/ Devils that you know / Raise worse hell than a stranger'.\n\n20. Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus\n\nTaylor tells the story of a rocky relationship in which their partner betrays them and focuses on drugs more than her.\n\nShe hints at infidelity on their part by singing: 'Your hologram stumbled into my apartment / Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness.\n\n'Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus / And I just watched it happen / As the decade would play us for fools.'\n\nTaylor goes on to reference, singing: 'You said some things that I can’t unabsorb / You turned me into an idea of sorts / You needed me, but you needed drugs more / And I couldn’t watch it happen.'\n\nTaylor reignited her explosive feud with Kim Kardashian by releasing a diss track aimed at the reality star (pictured with Kim in 2015)\n\nTaylor also seems to reference Kim's 10-year-old daughter North West dancing to Shake It Off on TikTok back in January, she writes:# your kid comes home singin' a song that only us two is gonna know is about you'\n\n21. How Did It End?\n\nTaylor appears to reference the speculation over her relationship with Joe as she details in the chorus:\n\n'Come one come all It's happ'nin' again / The empathetic hunger descends We'll tell no-one / 'Cept all of our friends / We must know How did it end?'\n\nAccusing people of conducting their own 'post-mortem's' in the opening sentence, Taylor also accuses people of being smug: 'Soon they'll go home to their husbands / 'cause they know they can trust him / Then feverishly calling their cousins.'\n\nShe later admits that while everyone is questioning, 'How did it end?' she doesn't know herself: 'But I still don't know, how did it end?'\n\n22. So High School\n\nWhile many tracks are bold aims at her exes Matt and Joe, happiness does reign in her track So High School where she discusses current boyfriend Travis.\n\nShe sings: 'You know how to ball, I know Aristotle, brand new, full throttle // Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto // It's true, swear, scouts honor // You knew what you wanted, and, boy, you got her.'\n\nTaylor the directly references a resurfaced video in which Travis was asked who marry, kiss or kill between Ariana Grande, Katy Perry and Taylor.\n\nShe sings: 'Are you gonna marry, kiss or kill me? Kill me. It's just a game, but really, really, I'm betting on all three for us two.\n\n23. I Hate It Here\n\nTaylor relies in escapism to distract herself from the issues plaguing her real life, describing herself as going to 'secret gardens in my mind'.\n\nShe appears to be dealing with the fallout of being lied to, singing: Tell me something awful like you are a poet / Trapped inside the body of a finance guy\n\n'Tell me all your secrets / All you’ll ever be is / My eternal consolation prize.'\n\nShe appears to be between relationships, musing: 'I’m lonely, but I’m good /I’m bitter, but I swear I’m fine.'\n\n24. thanK you aIMee\n\nFans are convinced the 24th track - thanK you aIMee - is aimed at Kim Kardashian, as the letters K,I and M are capped up to spell out her name.\n\nTaylor sings in one line: 'There's a bronze spray-tanned statue of you and a plaque underneath it/That threatens to push me down the stairs, at our school.'\n\n'All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin' / And I can't forgive the way you made me feel / Screamed 'F**k you, Aimee' to the night sky, as the blood was gushin' / But I can't forget the way you made me heal.'\n\nShe goes on to add: 'And it wasn't a fair fight, or a clean kill / Each time that Aimee stomped across my gravе / And then she wrote hеadlines/ In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take.'\n\nTaylor concludes by confirming she's changed the name of the woman she's singing about - further fuelling speculation the track is about Kim.\n\nShe also seems to reference Kim's 10-year-old daughter North West dancing to her 2014 single Shake It Off on TikTok, finding it ironic as the 'song is about you'.\n\nShe sings: 'And so I changed your name, and any real defining clues/And one day, your kid comes home singin' a song that only us two is gonna know is about you.'\n\n25. I Look in People's Windows\n\nWhile she may have the ultimate girl squad around her, Taylor admits she can't help but feel lonely when chasing a man.\n\nShe sings: 'I look in people's windows / Transfixed by rose golden glows / They have their friends over to drink nice wine.\n\n'I look in people's windows / In case you're at their table / What if your eyes looked up and met mine / One more time.'\n\n26. The Prophecy\n\nTaylor seems to be pained by the thought of trying to find an intimate love when her life is so public.\n\nThe singer - who found fame as a teenager - reveals that being in the spotlight and adored by millions of fans can't measure up to being loved by a partner.\n\nShe shares: 'Please / Change the prophecy / Let it once be me / Who do I have to speak to / About if they can redo the prophecy?'\n\nTaylor has previously revealed how fame changed her life for the worst, explaining: 'It's a social situation every time I go out.\n\n'I just have to wake up in the morning and say, \"How am I feeling today? If someone asks for a picture, am I gonna feel imposed upon today because I'm dealing with my own stuff? Am I gonna take my own stuff out on some innocent 14-year-old today and be in a bad mood?\"\n\n'OK, maybe not … Maybe I won't leave the house.'\n\n27. Cassandra\n\nthanK you aIMee might not be the only song issuing shots at Kim Kardashians, with Cassandra also seeming to be filled with veiled digs.\n\nGreek god Cassandra, 'entangled men' and was punished with a curse where no one would believe what she had to say.\n\nIn her chorus, Taylor sings: 'When the first stone’s thrown, they’re screaming /In the streets, there’s a raging riot / When it’s \"Burn the b***h\", they’re shrieking / When the truth comes out, it’s quiet.'\n\nThis could be in reference to Kim sparking a social media firestorm when she shared a Snapchat video of then-husband Kanye West during a phone call with Taylor, where she seemingly gave the rapper to include lyrics about her in his new song.\n\nWhile Taylor insisted that she hadn't consented to Kanye labelled her a 'b***h' in his track, many accused her of being a snake.\n\nKardashian fans and Swifties went to war with one another by posting snake emojis.\n\nTaylor references snakes in her song, sharing: 'So, they killed Cassandra first ‘cause she feared the worst / And tried to tell the town / So, they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say / Do you believe me now?'\n\n28. Peter\n\nTaylor reflects on her childhood and pleads for forgiveness as she reflects on losing a past love.\n\nIt could be in reference to Matty, who she was first linked to in 2014, and their subsequent breakup as she sings: 'Said you were gonna grow up /Then you were gonna come find me.\n\n'Words from the mouths of babes / Promises oceans deep / But never to keep / Never to keep.'\n\nIt could also be a follow up to her song Cardigan, where she sang: 'Tried to change the ending / Peter losing Wendy'.\n\nTaylor reflects on her childhood and pleads for forgiveness as she reflects on losing a past love (pictured in 2008)\n\n29. The Bolter\n\nFans have made many interpretations of The Bolter - with links to a London pub in the form of Mansion House's bar of the same name while also alluding to a suitor running into the night - something fans insisted was about Joe.\n\nSome Twitter users claimed the location is where the former couple enjoyed their first date - yet the claims were quickly disputed by devoted followers.\n\nThe initial claim came from a fan writing: 'The Bolter is a bar in London where Taylor and Joe went on their first outing?!?!???? I’m done, BYE'.\n\nOthers followed up writing: '***Apparently that’s not the bar they were publicly first seen together!!!!*** But there is indeed this bar in London which is crazy anyway... guys it's not real, it was different place'.\n\nShe sings: 'Started with a kiss / \"Oh, we must stop meeting like this\" / But it always ends with a town car speeding / Out the drive one evenin' / Ended with the slam of a door / But she's got the best stories // You can be sure...\n\n'All her f**kin' lives / Flashed before her eyes / And she realized / It feels like the time / She fell through the ice / Then came out alive'.\n\n30. Robin\n\nHer penultimate track is also reflective of her youth as she reflects on how innocence is ripped away with age.\n\nShe sings: 'You get the dragonflies above your bed /You have a favorite spot on the swing set / You have no room in your dreams for regret\n\n'You have no idea / The time will arrive for the cruel and the mean / You'll learn to bounce back just like your trampoline.'\n\nDespite this there's an element of hope involved as she sings: 'But now we'll curtail your curiosity / In sweetness / Way to go, tiger / Way to go, tiger /Higher and higher / Higher and higher / Wilder and lighter.'\n\n31. The Manuscript\n\nThe only bonus track on the first physical versions of Taylor's album seems to be a follow up to All Too Well - her song about Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nShe reflects on a past romance as she sings: 'Now and then she rereads the manuscript / Of the entire torrid affair /He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was / Soon they'd be pushin' strollers / But soon it was over.'\n\nIn a nod to All Too Well (10 Minute Version) and its music video directly, Taylor continues: 'The Professor said to write what you know / Lookin' backwards might be the only way to move forward / Then the actors / Were hitting their marks.'\n\nThe Bad Blood songstress, 34 - who recently teased a 'timetable' to her fans ahead of the LP's release - initially announced the album while attending the 2024 Grammys in February\n\nTaylor Swift fans were left in shock when it was revealed in April that she'd called it quits with Joe Alwyn after six years together.\n\nAnd with the hitmaker, 33, moving on from The 1975 frontman Matty Healy with American footballer Travis Kelce, DailyMail.com is taking a look back at her extensive dating history.\n\nJuly- October 2008: JOE JONAS\n\nTaylor dated Joe in the early days of her singing career back in 2008, but sadly split after only a few months together\n\nTaylor dated Joe in the early days of her singing career back in 2008, but sadly split after only a few months together.\n\nThe singer revealed that she was dumped over 'phone call' and their relationship was inspiration for the star's much-loved album Fearless.\n\nThe Grammy-winning songstress then went onto slam Joe during an appearance on The Ellen Show, saying: 'There's one (song) that's about that guy, but that guy's not in my life anymore, unfortunately. That's ouch.\n\n'We haven't talked since, but you know what, some day I'm gonna find someone really really great who's right for me.'\n\n'When I look at that person, I'm not even going to remember the boy who broke up with me over the phone in 25 seconds when I was 18.'\n\nBut in 2015, Joe revealed he harbored no bad blood with Taylor during an interview with Access Hollywood, admitting that having a song written about you goes with the territory of dating a musician.\n\nThe singer revealed that she was dumped over 'phone call' and their relationship was inspiration for the star's much-loved album Fearless\n\nAnd in 2021, Taylor hinted that she and Jonas were back on civil terms during another appearance on Ellen's Burning Questions segment.\n\nThe star was asked what the most rebellious thing she did as a teenager was, which caused Taylor to laugh.\n\n'Probably when I like put Joe Jonas on blast on your show,' she began. 'That was too much, that was too much.'\n\nMeanwhile in 2021, Taylor put out previously unreleased track Mr. Perfectly Fine which is believed to be about ex Joe.\n\nAugust - November 2009: TAYLOR LAUTNER\n\nTaylor and Taylor dated back in 2009, having first met while filming the upcoming ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day, where they shared an on-screen kiss.\n\nTaylor and Taylor dated back in 2009, having first met while filming the upcoming ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day, where they shared an on-screen kiss.\n\nShe described the moment as 'life-changing', and he appeared equally smitten, saying he definitely considered her 'his type'.\n\nWhen quizzed about their relationship on a U.S. radio show at the time, the Love Story singer played it coy.\n\nShe said: 'I don't know, he's an amazing guy and we're really close... and ah... yep.'\n\nHowever it was a mere two months before their relationship was over.\n\n'He liked her more than she liked him. He went everywhere he could to see her, but she didn't travel much to see him,' a source told Us Weekly at the time. 'They decided they were better as friends.'\n\nIt has long been rumored that Swift wrote Back To December about her 2009 relationship with Lautner.\n\nNovember 2009 - February 2010: JOHN MAYER\n\nJohn Mayer reportedly dated Taylor from December 2009 through February 2010 when he was 31 and she was 19\n\nJohn Mayer reportedly dated Taylor from December 2009 through February 2010 when he was 31 and she was 19.\n\nThey originally met when she collaborated on his song Half of My Heart.\n\nThe romance seemingly ended on bad terms based on her scathing song Dear John which many people believe is about him.\n\nThe name of the song as well as lyrics recalling her age (19) at the time of the romance appear to lead to the conclusion that is is fact about John and their rocky but brief romance, although the songstress never confirmed it was about him.\n\nThe timing of the song also confirms its about John: She released the song in October 2010 on her Speak Now album, eight months after their reported split.\n\nThe romance seemingly ended on bad terms based on her scathing song Dear John which many people believe is about him\n\nThe tune gave insight on how Taylor and John's reported romance went wrong, with the singer singing in tune: 'Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone/ Don't you think I was too young to be messed with / The girl in the dress cried the whole way home.'\n\nShe also wrote the lyrics: 'Well maybe it's me / And my blind optimism to blame / Or maybe it's you and your sick need / To give love and take it away.\n\n'Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong / Don't you think nineteen's too young / To be played by your dark, twisted games.'\n\nHe added more fuel to the fire two years after the songs release when he told Rolling Stone magazine that he felt 'really humiliated' about the song, which 'made' him 'feel terrible.'\n\nOctober - December 2010: JAKE GYLLENHAAL\n\nSwift and Gyllenhaal made headlines when they dated for just three months in the fall of 2010, when he was 29 and she was 20\n\nSwift and Gyllenhaal made headlines when they dated for just three months in the fall of 2010, when he was 29 and she was 20.\n\nSources told tabloids at the time that it was 'serious,' and they were even spotted together over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nNearly two years after they split, Swift released Red, which included track number five, All Too Well, with allusions to the actor.\n\nIn the original lyrics, Swift sings about taking a trip upstate with her romantic partner, leaving her scarf at his sister's house, dancing in the kitchen, and falling in love before it all ended.\n\nShe later teased on numerous occasions that the song as she originally wrote it lasted about ten minutes, but verses were cut for time.\n\nGyllenhaal, though, denied knowing anything about being featured on her album.\n\n'Do I [have a song]? I don't know,' he told Howard Stern in 2015.\n\nEarlier this year, Taylor released a 10-minute long, deeply personal version of All Too Well, which offered added new dramatic details in recounting their romance, singing that she was in 'hell' and felt 'shame' (pictured, the music video)\n\nThe song would have firmly been in Swift's past had it not been for the drama with her masters. In 2009, after Scooter Braun purchased her masters, Swift accused him of exerting 'tyrannical control' over her music, and the two had a bitter feud in the press.\n\nAt the urging of fans, Swift began rerecording all of the songs for which he owned the masters, which she has started to release — including several never-before-released tracks on each one.\n\nShe released a 10-minute long, deeply personal version of All Too Well, which offered added new dramatic details in recounting their romance, singing that she was in 'hell' and felt 'shame.'\n\nMost damning, though were revelations that Gyllenhaal told Swift the problem was their age difference.\n\nJuly- October 2012: CONNOR KENNEDY\n\nTaylor and Connor - the son of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and the late Mary Kennedy - were first spotted together at the Kennedy family home in Hyannisport in July 2012\n\nTaylor and Connor - the son of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and the late Mary Kennedy - were first spotted together at the Kennedy family home in Hyannisport in July 2012.\n\nBut the summer romance barely lasted three months. Insiders said Taylor - who was four years older than Conor - freaked the 18-year-old by coming on too strong - and because of her apparent obsession with his famous family.\n\n'Conor's just an 18-year-old kid and wasn't ready for anything super serious,' a pal told RadarOnline.com.\n\n'But Taylor is looking for her soulmate and it kind of freaked him out with how strong she came on,' the insider went on.\n\nThe friend also said that Taylor was obsessed with the Kennedy family - and was living out a fairytale with Conor.\n\n'She was more obsessed with the idea of dating a Kennedy, than the actual Kennedy she was dating,' the pal added.\n\nDecember 2012 - January 2013: HARRY STYLES\n\nFledgling couple Harry and Taylor dated from November 2012, with a source telling The Sun at the time he was 'head over heels' for her\n\nFledgling couple Harry and Taylor dated from November 2012, with a source telling The Sun at the time: 'Harry is head over heels for Taylor and even admitted he loves her while they were in the Big Apple.'\n\nHowever they split just three months later in January 2013.\n\nAt the time it was reported she had ended their fling after an angry row during their New Year's vacation.\n\nHe is largely believed to be the inspiration for her tracks Style and Out Of The Woods, both off of the album 1989.\n\nIn 2015, she admitted she always knew her relationship with Harry was doomed for fail.\n\nIn a video posted to celebrate the one year anniversary of her hit album 1989, she revealed that the number one feeling she felt during her three month fling with the One Direction singer was 'anxiety'.\n\nBefore belting out a one-off acoustic version of Out Of The Woods, she elaborated on the relationship that inspired the song.\n\n'I'm going to play you a song that I wrote about a relationship that I was in that the number one feeling I felt in the whole relationship was anxiety,' she explained as she sat at her piano.\n\nIn 2015, she admitted she always knew her relationship with Harry was doomed for fail because she felt 'anxious' the whole time\n\n'Because it felt very fragile, it felt very tentative. And it always felt like, 'Okay, what's the next road block? What's the next thing that's gonna deter this?\n\n'How long do we have before this turns into just an awful mess and we break up? Is it a month? Is it three days?'\n\nThe former One Direction-er previously spoke about Taylor's songwriting back in 2017.\n\nHe kept coy about the songs, but defended Taylor against critics telling Rolling Stone: 'I mean, I don't know if [Out Of The Woods and Style] about me or not, but the issue is, she's so good, they're bloody everywhere.'\n\nMarch 2015 - June 2016: CALVIN HARRIS\n\nTaylor is rumored to have started their relationship after meeting the hunk at a BRIT Awards after party in London in February 2015\n\nTaylor is rumored to have started their relationship after meeting the hunk at a BRIT Awards after party in London in February 2015.\n\nHowever the couple ended up splitting in 2016 after a very public romance, with reports stating the relationship had ended because he was 'jealous' of the superstar singer's success.\n\nCalvin later accused Taylor's team of leaking that she had secretly written the lyrics for his hit track with Rihanna, This Is What You Came For.\n\nHe wrote soon at the time: 'Hurtful to me at this point that her and her team would go so far out of their way to try and make ME look bad at this stage though. I figure if you're happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do.\n\n'I know you're off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy [Perry] ETC but I'm not that guy, sorry. I won't allow it. Please focus on the positive aspects of YOUR life because you've earned a great one. God bless everyone have a beautiful day.'\n\nCalvin later admitted 'all hell broke loose' when he split from Taylor.\n\nCalvin later admitted 'all hell broke loose' when he split from Taylor; seen in 2015\n\nHe told GQ: 'It's very difficult when something I consider so personal plays out very publicly.
