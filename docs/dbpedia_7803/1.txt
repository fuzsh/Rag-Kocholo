In the same way that the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States is comprised of individual provinces, so too is the rest of the world, with other Assistancies and Jesuit Conferences representing each region. For more information about the provinces and Assistancies throughout the world, please visit the Jesuit Curia, the global headquarters of the Society of Jesus, located in Rome.
