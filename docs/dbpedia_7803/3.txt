Saint Ignatius of Loyola wrote the Spiritual Exercises after experiencing a profound conversion in Manresa, Spain. Ignatian spirituality today links Jesuits across the world and also enriches the lives of millions of non-Jesuits. We are pleased to share IgnatianSpirituality.org, via Loyola Press, which is a ministry of our province. Copies of the Spiritual Exercises and materials supporting them can be purchased via Loyola Press or at any major online book retailer.
