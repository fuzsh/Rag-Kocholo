        "text": "Erected between 1568 and 1584, Il Gesù was the first Jesuit church built in Rome. It was lavishly decorated during the seventeenth century. Nowadays, the Church of the Gesù (Chiesa del Gesù) is considered to be one of the best examples of Roman Baroque architecture.\n\nIn its interior\n\nIl Gesú was built with small chapels instead of aisles, designed specially so that the members of the church are all facing the main altar.\n\nOne of the most striking parts of the temple is the ceiling fresco painted by Baciccia (Giovanni Battista Gaulli). The fresco manages to look three-dimensional thanks to the wooden figures and stuccos added to the fresco.\n\nLocated in the chapel of the Madonna della Strada there is a small icon of the Madonna della Strada. The icon was built on the same site as Il Gesù and dates from the fifteenth century. It had originally been part of the church, which has the same name.\n\nThe Chapel St Ignatius of Loyola (founder of the Jesuits) is a prime example of Roman Baroque architecture. In this chapel, the tomb of the saint is decorated with silver, gold, bronze, marble and some special stones.\n\nIn the right transept is the altar of Saint Francis Xavier, one of the founders of the Jesuits. The altar features Jesus with St Ignatius and it has a silver reliquary with part of the saint’s right arm.\n\nIn the heart of the city"
