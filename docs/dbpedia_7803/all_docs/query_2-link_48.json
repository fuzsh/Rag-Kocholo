        "text": "International\n\nEuropean Jesuits in Philosophy (JESPHIL)\n\nJESPHIL is a group of European Jesuit Philosophers who meet every two years to make a philosophical contribution to the study of problems of current importance, and to support the role of philosophy within Jesuit formation. The group encourages networking and cooperation between institutions, and studies the philosophical aspects of important questions related to the mission of Jesuits in Europe, in collaboration with the President of the European Jesuit Provincials.\n\nCatholic University of Portugal, Braga\n\nThe Faculty of Philosophy at Braga, directed by the Society of Jesus and the oldest Faculty at the Catholic University of Portugal, finds itself in the “Mission” that St. Ignatius puts forward in Part IV of the Constitutions: “The aim which the Society of Jesus directly seeks is to aid its own members and their neighbors to attain the ultimate end for which they were created. To achieve this purpose, in addition to the example of one’s own life, learning and a method of expounding it are also necessary. Therefore, after the proper foundation of abnegation of themselves is seen to be present in those who were admitted and also the required progress in virtues, it will be necessary to provide for the edifice of their learning and the manner of employing it, that these may be aids toward better knowledge and service of God, our creator and Lord. Toward achieving this purpose, the Society takes charge of the colleges and also of some universities.” Adapting this “Mission” to modern times, we might say that the Faculty of Philosophy finds its purpose in the development of its students’ abilities. It currently offers degrees in Philosophy, Classics, Portuguese Literature and Linguistics, Psychology, and more.\n\nCentre Sèvres, Paris\n\nThe Faculty of Philosophy at Centre Sevres-Paris has been granted permission by the Holy See to confer canonical degrees at the bachelors, masters (licenciate) and doctoral levels. Due to an agreement between the French Republic and the Holy See, these degrees are recognized as equivalent to their French counterparts. The Faculty of Philosophy offers a solid basis in the history of philosophy and the fundamental questions that can be found therein. The Faculty of Philosophy has particular strengths in: History of Philosophy; especially in the Ancient, Patristic, Modern and Contemporary periods; Moral and Social Philosophy; and Mysticism and Philosophy of Religion. In addition, courses are offered in the social sciences and within specialized departments of the Centre Sevres in the areas of aesthetics, public ethics and biomedical ethics. Our pedagogy emphasizes thorough familiarity with the works of major thinkers. It calls attention to the historical roots of major philosophical themes concerning man and society, as well as their impact on contemporary culture and their spiritual value.\n\nFaculty of Philosophy of the Society of Jesus (FFDI), Zagreb\n\nThe Faculty of Philosophy of the Society of Jesus (FFDI) is an institution of higher education which was founded, and whose Statute was approved, by the Vatican’s Congregation for Catholic Education in Seminaries and Institutes of Study (Congregazione per l’Educazione Cattolica dei Seminari e degli Istituti di Studi) through a decree dated July 31st, 1989. By virtue of that decision FFDI was, in terms of canon law, fully elevated to equal status with the Faculty of Theology in Zagreb, the Faculty of Theology in Split, and the Faculty of Theology in Dakovo. FFDI belongs to the Croatian Province of the Society of Jesus, which provides the dean, the vice-dean, and a large number of teachers, besides ensuring the necessary conditions for its work. FFDI in its structure and functions is governed according to the existing general canon law of the Catholic Church, and in particular by the Apostolic Constitution Sapientia Christiana and its regulations, the Statutes approved by the Congregation for Catholic Education in Seminaries and Institutes of Study, along with regulations issued by the Faculty itself and the legal regulations of the Croatian state and academic authorities. The Faculty of Philosophy of the Society of Jesus continues its own centuries-long tradition of having established itself along the formal university standards of the Society of Jesus, by offering courses in philosophy and teaching philosophy in Zagreb. The Faculty delivers its instruction in two scientific fields (philosophy and religious studies), works on its own premises (the faculty building and the library), holds approved programs and validly issued permanent licenses, hosts teachers, enjoys a great interest from students, and is equipped with computer technology and other necessary equipment.\n\nHeythrop College, London\n\nHeythrop was established in 1614 in Louvain by the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) for the study of philosophy and theology. Since 1970, it has been a College of the University of London, while retaining a modern Catholic ethos, and offers an educational experience that respects all faiths and perspectives. Why study philosophy at Heythrop? Well, you will be located in a fashionable and attractive part of London yet studying in a peaceful setting 200 yards from Kensington High Street with its excellent transport links. More important, you will be part of the prestigious University of London, one of the most highly rated universities in the world and the one with the largest philosophy faculty in Britain. You will share in being involved with a vibrant, rapidly growing and friendly department with high academic standards which is almost unique in offering individual tuition. Heythrop has more than eleven full-time philosophy staff with many more part-time staff. The department has particular research strengths in: philosophy of religion; philosophy of mind and psychology, especially agency, imagination, intentionality, perception, psychoanalysis, and rationality; aesthetics, especially fiction and imagination; metaphysics, especially metaphysics of mind, natural kinds, and necessity."
