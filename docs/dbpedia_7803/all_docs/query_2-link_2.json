        "text": "The third Ignatian Leadership Programme took place in June/July 2024. The Programme was led by the recognised authority on Ignatian leadership, David McCallum SJ, and was held at Campion Hall, the Jesuit postgraduate Hall in the University of Oxford. 12 Jesuits participated, eleven from the European Conference. Those in attendance were Jesuits in their first leadership roles. The purpose of the two-week course was to cultivate the attitudes, skills, and knowledge of Ignatian leadership, drawing on Ignatian spirituality, contemporary leadership studies, and the psychology of human flourishing. In other words, the aim was to form Jesuits for leadership understood as contemplation in action. The methodology on the course was varied, with the theoretical woven into the experiential and practical, offering a broad and enriching tapestry of learning. Throughout the programme, “seeds” were planted with care, to be nurtured and to grow over time. One participant shared “I am not sure what the fruit will be – I need time”. We therefore acknowledge contemplation continues, beyond the summer school. A hallmark of the programme is the strong emphasis on discernment as characteristic, not only of Ignatian prayer, but also of Ignatian leadership. The participants commented on and appreciated this singular emphasis as they explored the conceptual self, versus the observing self, versus the experiencing self. The following key words stood out on the programme: acceptance, freshness and spirit. Participants learned to accept their limitations and gifts, see their roles with fresh eyes, and enliven their spirit forthe magis. Growth in self-awareness and in magnanimity were deeply considered. Participants valued the safe spaces in which they could speak and share freely, sometimes about challenges. One participant said “(I was) able to slow down on the course (with) time to reflect, especially on self”. The programme was led by David MacCallum, who directs the Discerning Leadership Programme at the Curia in Rome, together with Roger Dawson. Other course instructors included John Dardis, Nick Austin, Dierdre Rowe and Austen Ivereigh. Participant feedback was very positive, with a strong recommendation of this programme to other Jesuits. Comments included: • “Course was an excellent seed – fertile good in this group.”• “It’s helped me to follow Jesus in more discernment and leadership as service.”• “This course was the perfect course at the right time.”• “It deepened my discernment for leadership.”• “Confirmation especially in self-awareness; confident in listening skills. More confidence in dealing in conflict.”• “It gave me hope in a difficult situation. It gave me a path to consolation.”• “This course is a gift – and gave me deeper understanding. It gave me tools, practicalities and cont exp. It’s an invitation to go deeper, of conversion even.”In 2025 we anticipate a further summer school, which will build on the experience and learnings of July 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n\nBecause sport and faith share common values ​​and because the Games that are opening are an opportunity to bear witness to the joy and \"strength\" of Christ, the Jesuits are mobilizing before and during the event: presence of chaplains in the Olympic village, exhibition, spiritual journeys, reviews... A tour of this mobilization. The two Jesuit communities of Saint-Denis in the starting blocks Located in Saint-Denis Basilica and La Plaine Saint-Denis , the two Jesuit communities are fully mobilized, while the city will welcome up to 170,000 supporters daily, from July 24 to August 11 and then from August 29 to September 8, not including the residents of the neighborhood. \" We will spend the summer with the residents who will not be able to afford to leave or pay for entry to the stadium, and experience the games together ,\" rejoices Fr. Jacques Enjalbert SJ, chaplain of the Maison d'église de Saint-Paul. Two Jesuits, Frs. Jacques Enjalbert and Grégoire Catta, as well as three Xavier sisters, Véronique Rouquet, Juliette Ploquin and Gudrun Steiss, will be part of the team of Catholic chaplains at the interdenominational center of the athletes' village . They will be available to athletes from all over the world for a warm welcome, fraternal support and spiritual listening, both before and after the events, and will also be able to pray with them. Near the Olympic village, in the Saint-Ouen-le-Vieux church, they will take turns, with diocesan priests, to celebrate a daily mass for them. As part of the Holy Games, the Jesuits will contribute to the proposals of the diocese of Saint-Denis by welcoming supporters and tourists in the two churches they run : Saint-Denys de l'Estrée and Saint-Paul de la Plaine. Located a stone's throw from the Stade de France and the new Aquatic Centre, the Saint-Paul de la Plaine church house will aim to link sport, art and spirituality through various initiatives: A photography exhibition from June 30 to September 18 on the theme of Body & Soul. Created by photographer Manuel Lagos Cid and journalist-videographer Benjamin Le Souëf, it will illustrate how the Christian faith sheds light on the relationship to the body and to sports practice through six themes. For each, a central text panel, bilingual French-English, will be framed by portraits of neighborhood residents evoking, in a short video, the way in which the experience of sport resonates with their life and faith journeys. This exhibition was designed in partnership with a spiritual retreat to be experienced as a family offered by the Jesuits (see box) . It will also be visible at the Saint-Denys de l'Estrée church, in the center of Saint-Denis, and at the Saint-Ferréol church, a Jesuit sanctuary on the Old Port in Marseille where the Olympic sailing events and some football matches will take place. Finally, a copy of \"Pugilist \", a sculpture by Paul Landowski made for the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, which represents a competitive boxer, will be exhibited in front of the church. Another \"body and soul\" fighter will face him: \"End of game\", a sculpture by Théophile Stein from the Volonté 93 collective in Saint-Ouen. In the church itself, the installation \"l'habitant\", by Thibaut Lucas from the Push collective in Aubervilliers, will enter into dialogue with the liturgical space. Visits and discovery of heritage Also in Saint-Denis, the association \"Pierres Vivantes\", an initiative launched by an Italian Jesuit in 2008, will organize an international camp during the first ten days of the games. The young participants will show visitors around the Saint-Denis basilica and raise awareness of the richness of the Christian mystery through art and architecture. During the second part of the games, a camp led by Fr. Pierre Alexandre Collomb SJ and Fr. Manuel Grandin SJ, and made up jointly of young people from the Magis network and the diocese of Saint-Denis, will take over and welcome tourists and pilgrims to this high place of art, history and faith. Body and soul, a spiritual training to experience as a family Let's get moving towards games! This is the proposal of the Body & Soul course which invites families to follow a spiritual training exploring the spiritual dimension of sports practice based on six themes that relate as much to daily life as to sport: play and discipline, body and soul, strength and fragility, test and combat, defeat and victory, competition and team spirit, i.e. six realities in tension. > Booklets and registration: Body & Soul Course A podcast: Saint Ignatius participates in the games with his specialty: the Spiritual Exercises ! When writing the Spiritual Exercises , Saint Ignatius of Loyola knew well that a sport requires training and repetition of exercises. In this year of games, Prie en chemin is offering from July 1st a course of 4 podcasts with free access to explore the link between sports training and the Spiritual Exercises : training, being fair-play, being “supported”, fighting to win… > Presentation"
