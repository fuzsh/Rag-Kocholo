        "text": "As the 1400's came to a close, the great cities of Europe were prospering, adventurers were exploring distant lands, and a renaissance in learning was inspiring new ideas in the arts and sciences. Ignatius was born in 1491, the youngest son of a large, noble family in northern Spain. Though he was a devout Catholic, Ignatius hardly had the youth expected of a saint. He dreamed of becoming a knight and loved riding, fighting, gambling, dancing, and romancing young ladies.\n\nBut Ignatius's dreams began to change shortly before his 30th birthday. The young soldier was defending the castle of Pamplona against a French attack when he was hit in the legs by a cannonball. Bedridden for several months at his family's castle, he asked for some adventure stories to read, but all his sister-in-law could find for him was a life of Christ and some tales of saints. As he read these books, he noticed a change taking place within him.\n\nDaydreams of serving the king as a valiant knight, though at first enticing, ultimately left him feeling inwardly dry and discontented. By contrast, when he imagined devoting his life to the service of God and others, like the saints he had read about, Ignatius experienced a deep sense of peace.\n\nIgnatius wisely wanted to test what these unfamiliar desires were all about. So once he recovered from his injuries, he left behind his sword and castle and traveled widely â€” begging, preaching, and caring for the sick and poor. He loved talking with people about the spiritual life, and recorded his insights into a manual of prayer called the Spiritual Exercises. The more Ignatius worked and prayed, the more he realized that he was called to a life different than the one he had expected.\n\nLacking formal academic training, Ignatius went to Paris to study philosophy and theology so that he would become a better preacher and teacher. There, he met other students who were captivated by his experience of God, his vision of the world, and his boundless enthusiasm. In a small chapel outside of Paris, Ignatius and six other men professed religious vows of poverty and chastity to bind them more closely together. (They would later take a vow of obedience.) These companions, who called themselves \"friends in the Lord,\" would eventually become the first Jesuits, more formally known as the \"Society of Jesus.\" (This explains the \"S.J.\" after a Jesuit's last name).\n\nIn 1540, about the time Ignatius of Loyola turned 50, he and his companions went to Rome and offered their services to the pope, who very soon began to depend on them for important missions throughout the world. Over the years, the young Ignatius's desire for power, prestige, and privilege had been transformed into a desire for a life of service and simplicity. Ignatius gradually grew in his awareness of God's deep love, not just for the world generally, but for himself personally. He experienced this love as a profoundly intimate call by Christ to follow him, a call that filled Ignatius with great enthusiasm to serve God and, as he said, \"to help souls.\" Appropriately, then, Ignatius and his Jesuits chose as their motto Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam, a Latin phrase that means \"for the greater glory of God.\" The initials, \"A.M.D.G.,\" would be inscribed in many of the buildings the Jesuits would open over the centuries, reminding them that the inspiration and end of all they do is God.\n\nIgnatius never intended to open schools. He feared that they would tie down his Jesuits too much, preventing them from traveling wherever necessary to serve the needs of the Church. Ignatius soon discovered how much people's religious and moral life could be improved by an education rooted both in the gospel and in the humanistic revival of the Renaissance. Serving the \"greater glory of God,\" in short, meant opening schools. Ignatius's Jesuits quickly built a reputation as scholars and teachers. Students from all over Europe flocked to the burgeoning Jesuit schools. As Jesuit missionaries traveled the globe, they opened schools and colleges where there had been none before. By 1600, there were 245 Jesuit schools. Most of these were a combination of what we now call high schools and colleges; fifteen were specifically universities.\n\nIn the fledgling republic of the United States, Archbishop John Carroll founded the first Catholic college in the country, opening the doors to Georgetown in 1789. The rich history of Saint Joseph's University began a few decades later, on a September morning in 1851, when about thirty young men gathered at Saint Joseph's Church in Philadelphia, just one block from Independence Hall. After attending Mass, they were assigned to classes in a building next to the church. In 1927, the college moved out west of the city to its present location, which was known as \"Hawk Hill\" because of the hawks that used to enjoy this hill overlooking the city. It is no accident that many of the Jesuits' schools were in cities. Ignatius loved the hustle and bustle of city life. More importantly,in the crowded cities were countless people in great spiritual and material need. Ignatius was always ready to go wherever human needs were not met.\n\nAs we strive for \"God's greater glory,\" for the \"A.M.D.G.,\" Ignatius insists that we remain flexible and ready to adapt ourselves to different times and places. In this spirit, Jesuit education is a living tradition. Yet there are some elements common to all Jesuit universities founded across the ages and around the world. To these distinctive characteristics we now turn.\n\nIgnatius believed in the promise of each person, created in the image of God. During those long months recovering in his family's castle, he experienced God working with him through his deepest desires and hopes. As his faith grew, Ignatius also recognized that God works in all that is good in the world. Ignatius thus urges his students to \"find God in all things,\" not just in traditionally religious places and practices. A Jesuit education aims to develop in students a \"sacramental awareness\" of the world, that is, to see all of creation as pointing toward God.\n\nColleges are fitting places to help us find God in all things. Students take a variety of courses in different disciplines. In the Jesuit tradition, we look for God's fingerprints in all that we study. For example, because God is found in the natural world around us, we study biology, chemistry, and physics. Because God is found in our humanity, we study the works and ideas of women and men across the ages. We revel in the beauty of fine art and literature, we ask questions fundamental to the human person in philosophy and theology, and we see the best and worst of human nature in history. A very practical man, Ignatius would agree that we can find God in our business courses too: in the innovation that leads to progress and in whatever promotes genuine human community and economic justice.\n\nTaking a variety of different courses is what most people mean by a \"liberal education.\" At Jesuit and other Catholic colleges, though, liberal education means more. We are part of a rich tradition that is as much religious as it is intellectual. Jesuit education opens our minds, liberates our thinking, and empowers us to realize our God-given potential.\n\nIf we are to take seriously the call \"to find God in all things,\" then we must also try to find God in the goodness of our own lives - in our talents, in the people we live and learn with, and in the ordinary routine of every day. As we appreciate God's grandeur in and around us, we are drawn into a more loving, more meaningful relationship with our Creator.\n\nAs the books and papers pile up, try not to lose sight of the big picture. Look out for ideas that connect all of the different subjects you are studying. Stretch your mind and heart to realize eternal truths and appreciate timeless beauty. Become filled with wonder at moments of new understanding. Notice how you are thinking and praying in new ways. Above all, go about your work as scholars with diligence and humility, because in your studies and in your search for truth, you can encounter the face of God.\n\nIgnatius believed that life was a constant interplay between action and reflection, work and prayer, doing and knowing. We learn best when we are actively engaged in the learning process. As a student, you must do more than just read, take notes, and write exams. You must apply what you learn, making it your own. As you struggle with understanding research, connecting ideas, and then writing papers, you learn more than just the subject of your research: You learn how to think and learn on your own. You will become self-learners in our laboratories and during course internships. You will be active learners outside of your courses, too, whether you are involved in sports, community service, theatre, or retreats.\n\nDuring these enriching activities, you will test your character, reshape your vision of the world, and learn to love in new situations. This active engagement with the \"real world\" will give you the confidence you need to make the world a more just and gentle place.\n\nYou won't have much trouble being active at Saint Joseph's. Because your days here will be full, it is crucial for you to take time to reflect on all that is going on and to appreciate how you are changing. Otherwise, you may have the experience, but miss the meaning. Without taking time to reflect, you may miss the passing glances of God in your day.\n\nAt different times, in and out of class, we will invite you to slow down and consider important questions: What difference does what I'm studying make in the \"real world\"? What values and ideas really matter in my life? Where do I find God in the routine of every day? What kind of work and relationships give me joy and energy? When do I feel most alive and truly who I am called to be?\n\nRemember that before his conversion, Ignatius led the very active life of a knight. It was only during his forced convalescence following his run-in with a cannonball that he found the time to reflect on his life, an experience that changed him dramatically. We, too, must take time out of our busy days for quiet reflection. Quiet lets us hear God calling us in the ordinary moments of everyday life. Reflecting on both the world around us and on the deepest movements of our hearts helps us make better decisions about how to live our lives."
