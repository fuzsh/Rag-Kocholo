        "text": "The largest all-male religious order within the Roman Catholic church is the Society of Jesus, more commonly called Jesuits. The order was founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola in Paris, France, on Aug. 15, 1534, when he and six university students pledged to keep vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience and to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. One of the students was Francis Xavier, who later became a missionary to India and Japan.\n\nBecause entrance into Jerusalem was then impossible, the men went to Rome and placed themselves at the disposal of the pope. Loyola drew up a structure for his proposed organization, and it was approved by Pope Paul III on Sept. 27, 1540.\n\nLoyola, because of his military background, gave the Jesuits an almost military structure. The head of the order is the superior general, who serves for life. The governing body is a general congregation. It conducts the society’s business and, when the superior general dies, it meets to elect a successor. The superior general is aided by assistants, each of whom presides over a geographic region of the world. These regions, called assistancies, are divided into provinces headed by officials called provincials.\n\nThe society has three grades of membership: priests; scholastics; and temporal coadjutors, or brothers. The scholastic spends about nine years studying theology, philosophy, and arts and sciences, as well as teaching under supervision. After ordination to the priesthood, he spends a year devoted to spiritual formation. The priest then receives his final grade, either as formed spiritual coadjutor or as professed of solemn vows. As solemnly professed he takes four solemn vows and may hold any position in the society and participate in general congregations.\n\nThe Jesuits quickly became a potent teaching and missionary force in the church. They proved to be an effective tool of the Counter-Reformation in stemming the tide of Protestantism in Europe. The Jesuits founded colleges throughout Europe and sent missionaries to all parts of the world. By the time Ignatius died in 1556, there were 1,000 Jesuits working in Europe and Asia. Two centuries later their total had reached 22,589.\n\nThe zeal and effectiveness of the order aroused fear and hostility both within and outside the church. Portugal was the first to ban the Jesuits in 1759–61. Spain and France soon joined Portugal in demanding that the pope suppress the society. In 1773 Pope Clement XIV abolished the order. A remnant of the society endured in Russia, where the papal decree could not be enforced. Jesuits in other nations devoted themselves to ordinary priestly duties and study.\n\nDemands that the Jesuits be allowed to resume their educational and mission work led to the restoration of the order by Pope Pius VII in 1814. Education at all levels now involves more Jesuits than any other activity. Among their universities in the United States are Fordham in New York City, Marquette in Milwaukee, Wis., and Georgetown in Washington, D.C."
