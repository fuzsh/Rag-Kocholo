        "text": "Jesuits were invited to Gorizia (GÃ¶rz), a former part of the Hapsburg Austrian Empire to help stop the spread of Lutheranism. Two Jesuits came there in April 1615 to begin the work, but within a few months the war between Venice and the Hapsburgs interrupted their work until 1620. In 1621 the school, until then subject to the college of Graz, became an independent college. Two advanced courses of studies were later added: that of moral theology (1639) and that of philosophy (1650). Pastoral requirements required the construction of a new church, beginning in 1654, suitable for the large number of faithful who participated. The Jesuits' care wasn't limited to the students, they also founded pious congregations for the nobles and the citizens. The church took more than 80 years to complete, the facade being constructed between 1721 and 1723 by the Austrian Jesuit Christoph Tausch, a student of Br. Andrea Pozzo, SJ. By 1687 the number of students reached 594, the highest in its history. Pastoral and spiritual activity also increased dramatically. While the college was the training site for seminarians in 1723, a decline had begun leading to the failure of major courses in canon law and mathematics. With the erection of the Diocese of Gorizia in 1751, the Jesuits lost the right to name the pastor of the parish church. And while the St. Ignatius Church was finally consecrated in 1767, the Order was already beginning to be suppressed in 1762 in France, in 1767 in the territory of Charles III, and by 1773 throughout the world.\n\nThe college at Messina was the first Jesuit school open to lay men. The World Congress on Jesuit Education took place in Messina in November 1991 as part of the Ignatian Year. Jesuit education at that time involved 1370 educational institutions, in 65 countries, embracing 2,000,000 students and 81,000 teachers.\n\nThe Brera College and Observatory, Milan\n\nYUGOSLAVIA, 1987, bicentenary of the death of Roger Boscovich, Scott 1834 perf and imperf\n\nfeaturing the Brera Observatory founded by him\n\nITALY, 2012, the 250th anniversary of the Brera Observatory, Scott 3151\n\nIn 1571 Pope Pius V at the request of Cardinal Charles Borromeo gave the remains of a monastery and the land that once belong to the congregation of the Humiliati, now dissolved, to the Jesuits to set up a college there. In 1572 Pope Gregory XIII issued the Bull, Dum intra mentis nostrae, gave the Jesuit college of Brera rights to award certain university degrees, but to avoid conflict with the nearby University of Pavia and the Senate of Milan which defended Pavia's status, the Jesuits exercised their higher academic privileges cautiously. Meanwhile plans for a new school building, begun in 1573 by Martino Bassi, did not progress until 1627 when Francesco Maria Richini took over the project. In 1764-1765 under Boscovich's instigation the observatory was added. When the Jesuits were dissolved in 1773 the college and observatory became state property. The building now houses the Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan's largest art gallery and one of the most important in Italy, as well as the Academy of Fine Arts of Brera and the Brera Library."
