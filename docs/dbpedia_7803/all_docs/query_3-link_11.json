Today, Jesuits and their collaborators remain on the frontiers of mission and ministry, providing spiritual care to men, women and families at the margins of society.\n\nMicronesia\n\nAfter the Second World War, Jesuits from New York were given responsibility for Jesuit works in what were then the United States Trust Territories in the Pacific – ministries located in what is today the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, the U.S. Territory of Guam and the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Jesuits serve in pastoral ministry on the islands and staff two high schools in the Federated States of Micronesia, Xavier High School, on Chuuk, and Yap Catholic High School, on the island of Yap. Jesuits live in two communities and additionally serve as hospital chaplains and administer the sacraments at St. Mary’s Parish, a deacon-led parish on Yap.\n\nRome\n\nThe headquarters of the Society of Jesus (known as the Jesuit Curia) is in Rome, Italy, where many spiritual, educational and administrative works support the operation of the international Order. Jesuits from New England and New York have a long tradition of sending men to these ministries and to the Pontifical Gregorian University, the Pontifical Biblical Institute, and the Pontifical Oriental Institutes, which educate and train future Church leaders.\n\nOther Missions\n\nA Jesuit may be sent anywhere in the world to serve the people of God. USA East Jesuits are also sent on mission to other provinces around the world."
