        "text": "1854\n\nHer Majesty Isabel II, Queen of Spain, issued a royal charter founding the Colegio de Belén (Belen School) in Havana, Cuba. Belen School begins its educational work in the building formerly occupied by the convent and convalescent hospital of Our Lady of Belen, hence the name of the school.\n\n1925\n\nSixty acres of new land and several buildings are donated to Belen School. The complex is later known as \"The Palace of Education.\"\n\n1961\n\nBelen Jesuit School is established in the United States. The fourth floor of the Gesu Elementary School, located in what is now the parking lot of Gesu Church in downtown Miami, becomes the first site of Belen Jesuit Preparatory School. The actual building no longer exists.\n\n1962\n\nBelen Jesuit Preparatory School acquires its own building and moves to a new site on the corner of SW 8th Street and 7th Avenue in Miami.\n\n1980\n\nGround-breaking ceremony is held for a new building on a 30 acre-site located in west Dade County.\n\n1981\n\nThe school year 1981-82 begins in the new facilities with an enrollment of 598 students.\n\n1992\n\nA language laboratory, two computer laboratories and four new classrooms are installed. The library is remodeled. A new track and a parking lot are added.\n\n1995\n\nThe Roberto C. Goizueta Athletic Center is inaugurated. Two more classrooms are added. Computers are updated in the computer labs.\n\n1996\n\nBelen Jesuit receives accreditation from SACS (Southern Association of Colleges and Schools), a prestigious and recognized association devoted to recognizing elite institutions.\n\n1998\n\nBelen Jesuit inaugurates the new Vincam wing, providing a larger cafeteria, eight new classrooms, and a guest dining room.\n\n2002\n\nBelen inaugurates the additions of Villa Javier, the Jesuit residence, and the Raúl and Nidia Rodríguez Science Pavilion. Work is also completed on the new outdoor basketball courts and tennis courts.\n\n2003\n\nThe Ignatian Center for the Arts Center is completed. The art center consists of the Ophelia & Juan Js. Roca Theater, Olga & Carlos Saladrigas Art Gallery, 7 classrooms, and a music rehearsal hall. The athletic complex is also renovated.\n\n2008\n\nThe Administration Building is completed. The administration building houses the offices of the President, Advancement, Admissions, Alumni, Registrar, Business, Copy Center, Technology Director, and the Cosculluela Dining Hall.\n\n2011\n\nThe School celebrates its Golden Jubilee, the fiftieth anniversary of the reestablishment of the school in South Florida. The school unveiled the Ecos de un Belén lejano painting by Cuban-American artist Humberto Calzada in the Administration building. Additionally, a complete renovation of the school’s central patio is completed and renamed the Garrido Family Plaza.\n\n2012\n\nThe new academic year begins a new era of teaching at Belen Jesuit with the implementation of a one‐to‐one program using the Apple iPad device and utilizing all-digital textbooks. In the fall, the football team kicks off its 41st season by debuting a new artificial turf football field. The newly named Sánchez Field will be used continuously for many sports including football, soccer, and lacrosse.\n\n2013\n\nThe school unveils a seven-foot bronzed statue of St. Ignatius of Loyola, blessed by Archbishop Thomas Wenski at the school’s main entrance. That summer, the Nike Hill & Tunnel is inaugurated, which extends the length of the cross-country course to 1.7 miles.\n\n2014\n\nIn January, the northwest lot of Belen Jesuit is transformed from a vacant lot to a beautiful practice field, featuring an artificial turf. The Hernández Field is used by athletes who play soccer, lacrosse and football, and by track and cross-country runners.\n\nIn December, the historical book, \"Men for Others: The Belen Jesuit Story\" by author Zeida Sardiñas is published. The book recounts the story of how the Jesuits founded Belen in Cuba and Miami.\n\n2015\n\nIn the fall, Bishop Fernando Isern blesses the grounds where construction on the new cafeteria and kitchen will be built. The new Dining Hall will provide the school with a larger space for eating and meal preparation, as well as a modern space for learning, community meetings, and formal gatherings.\n\n2016\n\nIn the spring, Miami Auxiliary Bishop Peter Baldacchino blesses the grounds where the Gian Zumpano Aquatic Center will be built. The new aquatic center will feature a state-of-the-art Olympic sized pool and will be home to the championship-winning swimming and water polo teams.\n\nOn November 29 Jesuit Fathers Willie García-Tuñón, Alberto Garcia, and Pedro Cartaya celebrated mass on the occasion of the blessing of the Chapel of Our Lady in the Garrido Plaza.\n\n2017\n\nOn March 19, Father Willie García-Tuñón celebrated mass in honor of the feast of St. Joseph at the newly renovated St. Joseph’s Patio, located between the school’s kitchen and Vincam Wing. The patio is adorned with a beautiful new statue of St. Joseph and a European Olive Tree.\n\nJust in time for the first bell of the 2017-2018 school year, the Dining Hall is blessed and inaugurated on August 21, followed by a ribbon-cutting ceremony on the first full day of school, August 22.\n\n2018\n\nArchbishop Thomas Wenski blesses the Gian Zumpano Aquatic Center on June 6, 2018 along with the Jesuit Fathers of Miami, led by Rev. Guillermo M. García-Tuñón, S.J.'87, Belen President and Rev. Alberto Garcia, S.J., Jesuit Superior of Miami.\n\n“The Gian Zumpano Aquatic Center embodies all that Gian Zumpano represented,” said Jesuit Father García-Tuñón. “His selflessness and generosity touched the community and Belen Jesuit. Gian was only a year older than I and was my friend. I am honored that this facility will memorialize a true Man for Others through the efforts of Gian’s family and friends.”\n\n2019\n\nIn April, four tennis courts were added behind the Gian Zumpano Aquatic Center. These multi-functional courts will also function as basketball and volleyball courts.\n\nOn May 29, School Chaplain Father Christian A. Sáenz, S.J. blessed the grounds of the future site of the Our Lady of Belen Chapel during the Groundbreaking Ceremony.\n\nOn September 6, the new field lights were turned on and the first football game was played at night. The Wolverines played the Doral Academy Falcons and earned their first win of the season. Lights were also added to the varsity baseball field.\n\nOn October 26, Father Guillermo M. García-Tuñón launched the public phase of the ‘For the Greater Glory’ campaign which aims to raise $34 million towards the strategic vision of the school.\n\nOn November 25, School Chaplain Father Christian A. Sáenz, S.J. blessed the grounds of the Arroyo Quad, located behind the Dining Hall. This beautiful park recognizes those courageous men who ventured far and worked hard to assure that tyranny would not have the last word and that Ignatian education would flourish. Memorialized in the quad are the Jesuit priests and brothers who have served at Belen Jesuit.\n\n2020\n\nOn January 28, School Chaplain Father Christian A. Sáenz, S.J. blessed the Fides Et Ratio Patio. The patio features a bronze statue of Father Matteo Ricci, S.J. as is located near the Raul and Nidia Rodriguez Science Pavilion.\n\nOn March 16, as a result of a global pandemic, Belen Jesuit transitioned to a distance learning model to complete the 2019-2020 school year. The campus was closed and all sports and activities were canceled or postponed.\n\nThe 2020-2021 school year began with classes being held virtually but by mid-September, we had transitioned to a hybrid model and in the new year transitioned to full back.\n\nThe state-of-the-art Roberto C. Goizueta Innovation Center opened for the 2020-21 academic year. The 8,000 square foot facility is an integral part of Belen’s mission of academic excellence. The facility offers a mix of traditional classrooms, maker space, and a science lab. The STEAM Program gives students access to a large selection of tools and is home to the Robotics teams and Engineering classes.\n\n2021\n\nClassroom Renovations began in the spring of 2021. Phase one of this project includes a complete re-imaging of the classrooms to a more modern design with enhanced technology, functionality, and new furniture. So far, 15 classrooms have been renovated. The goal is to have all classrooms completed within the next couple of years.\n\n2022\n\nIn February, a statue of Jesuit saint Aloysius de Gonzaga was blessed. Located in the newly constructed Gonzaga Pit it is located in between the Gian Zumpano Aquatic Center and the Shanley Family Administration building. This area will be utilized as an area for reflection and presentations.\n\nIn May, the Our Lady of Belen Chapel was dedicated in a special Mass celebrated by The Most. Rev. Thomas Wenski, Archbishop of Miami. In addition to the archbishop, the Mass included Fr. Martin Lenk, SJ., Provincial of the Antilles Province, Fr. Alberto García, S.J., Superior of the Jesuits in Miami, Fr. Guillermo M. García-Tuñón, S.J., President of Belen Jesuit, priests, deacons, and invited guests.\n\nIn June, the groundbreaking and blessing of the Roberto Surís Athletic Center was held. The three-story, nearly 60,000-square-foot building will feature two workout rooms, a gym, two dozen treadmills, ERG Machines, golf simulators, and much more!"
