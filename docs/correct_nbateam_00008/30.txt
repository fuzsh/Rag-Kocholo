As you know, Rasheed Wallace was part of the Detroit Pistons 2004 NBA Championship team after being traded to Detroit by the Atlanta Hawks. Throughout his career, Wallace loved to yell, “ball don’t lie” after an opposing player would miss a free throw following a questionable foul.

In honor of Wallace, we give to you a compilation video of Wallace yelling, “ball don’t lie.”

Enjoy!

Sheed even kept the tradition alive while coaching for the Pistons 2013 Summer League team.
