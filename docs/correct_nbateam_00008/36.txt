No, not that Rasheed Wallace trade, the other Rasheed Wallace trade.

If you were around during the year 2004, you'll recall the Pistons swinging a mid-season deal with Atlanta that bought them Rasheed Wallace (who infamously played one game as a Hawk) in exchange for a bunch of spare parts and some future draft picks. The Pistons were a good (not great) team that was about 12 games over .500 when they made the trade. With Wallace, they closed the season 20-6 and went on a rampage in the playoffs, defeating the Lakers 4-1 to win the NBA title.

The Pistons really separated themselves from the pack when they made that move. Wallace added a dimension to the team that was previously missing. Of course, it helped that he was already being shopped, and that the Pistons reeled him in from a Hawks team that was rebuilding after Atlanta had snagged him from Portland because Wallace had worn out his welcome. This was, of course, a calculated risk by then-GM Joe Dumars. Wallace led the league in technicals that season, and was also in the final year of a contract. Adding that to a team with good chemistry could have backfired horribly, leaving the Pistons out of future picks. Of course, we all know how that ended.

I'm wondering if the Wizards need to take a "swing for the fences" Rasheed Wallace move themselves. They're solidly in the Top 4 in a wide open East. I'm sorry, I'm just not scared of Atlanta, Toronto, or any other team in a seven-game series. I'm also not sure we have what it takes to beat any team from the West in the Finals either. But if the timing is right, those teams could also be beaten.

The Wizards have all their future first rounders, and a few spare pieces they could send out as sweetener for the right guy. The question, of course, is who is this year's Rasheed Wallace?

I don't have that answer, maybe ya'll do. Chime in below.
