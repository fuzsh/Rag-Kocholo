The Detroit Pistons have announced that Rasheed Wallace has been added to their staff as an assistant coach.

The new coach of the Detroit Pistons, Maurice Cheeks, used to coach Rasheed Wallace back when they were both with the Portland Trailblazers.

ESPN is reporting that Wallace was signed to a two-year deal.

Rasheed Wallace played on the 2004 NBA champion Pistons team after being traded to Detroit by the Atlanta Hawks. Wallace only played one game with the Hawks, scoring 20 points.

Last season Wallace played with the New York Knicks before retiring in April.

This is the year of long-time players becoming coaches in the league, as Jason Kidd has returned to the Nets, but this time as their head coach. Former Pistons head coach, Lawrence Frank, will be an assistant coach with the Nets.
