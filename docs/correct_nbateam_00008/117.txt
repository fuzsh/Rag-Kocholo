Rasheed Wallace played one game for the Atlanta Hawks, and some may argue he is one of the greatest Hawks for all time. Here is a pic of Sheed as a Hawk on that one night before he was traded to the Detroit Pistons.

Wallace scored 20 points with 6 rebounds and 5 blocks in a 98-92 loss to New Jersey on Feb. 18, 2004.
