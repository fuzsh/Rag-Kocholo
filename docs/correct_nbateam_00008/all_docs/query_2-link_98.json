        "text": "A four-time All-Star and NBA champion will reportedly no longer join the Los Angeles Lakers this summer.\n\nAccording to a July 25 report from Shams Charania of The Athletic, Rasheed Wallace won’t be joining new Lakers head coach Darvin Ham’s staff.\n\n“After further conversations, former NBA All-Star Rasheed Wallace will no longer join new Lakers coach Darvin Ham’s staff, sources said,” Charania wrote. “Wallace served as an assistant under Penny Hardaway at the University of Memphis last season.”\n\nCharania reported on June 6 that Wallace “was recently identified as a candidate for Ham’s staff.” As members of the Detroit Pistons, Ham and Wallace won the 2004 championship over the Lakers, who missed the playoffs last season despite having LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook.\n\nSince retiring in 2013, Wallace has gained coaching experience in high school, college and the NBA, with stops at Charles E. Jordan High School in North Carolina, the University of Memphis and the Pistons.\n\nWallace finished his NBA career with averages of 14.4 points, 6.7 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 1,109 games with the Washington Bullets, Portland Trail Blazers, Atlanta Hawks, Pistons, Boston Celtics and New York Knicks.\n\nKevin Garnett Was Excited About Wallace Joining Lakers\n\nHall of Famer Kevin Garnett was excited about Wallace’s possibility of joining the Lakers. On June 11, Garnett spoke about Wallace’s potential impact on James and Davis.\n\n“My dog Sheed Wallace on the bench with big Ham. I think this is great for this Laker team,” Garnett said on “KG Certified.” “I think Anthony Davis needs an influence that he can have. Someone in his ear. Listen, Rasheed Wallace is one of the best f***in’ power forwards and players to ever play in our league. He’s full of knowledge. He hasn’t shared that knowledge with the world, but I talk basketball with him several times. He is nothing below a genius and a mastermind when it comes to the block. He understands everything about both ends of the ball when it comes to scoring and also defending. I think he’s gonna be great for Anthony Davis. I think he’s gonna be great for LeBron James. I think he’s gonna be great for this Laker team. Straight up and down.”\n\nDuring his introductory press conference with the Lakers on June 6, Ham said Wallace was a “candidate” to join him in LA. It’s unknown why Wallace won’t be on the Lakers next season.\n\nLakers Still Trying to Trade Westbrook\n\nThe Lakers are still trying to trade Westbrook, who was second in the league in turnovers and had the sixth-worst effective field goal percentage last season. Charania reported on July 25 that “Utah, New York and Indiana are among the teams who have discussed deals with the Lakers” involving Westbrook.\n\n“Utah, New York and Indiana are among the teams who have discussed deals with the Lakers involving Russell Westbrook and draft capital, sources said,” Charania wrote. “There appears no deal imminent in those conversations — as the overall trade market plays out over the next two months of the offseason.”"
