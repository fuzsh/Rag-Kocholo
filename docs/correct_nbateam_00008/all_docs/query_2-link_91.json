        "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --- The Atlanta Hawks and Detroit Pistons are in unfamiliar territory.\n\nAtlanta has its best record at the All-Star break in a decade while Detroit hasn't been this bad in several years.\n\nJoe Johnson scored 27 points Wednesday night, leading Atlanta to a 99-95 win over Detroit.\n\nIf the postseason started Wednesday, the Hawks would've played host to the Pistons, who don't seem equipped to handle Atlanta's energy, talent and offensive options.\n\nAtlanta would win the tiebreaker, if it finishes the regular season tied with Detroit, because it has won two of the three scheduled meetings.\n\n\"It makes a big difference because the fourth seed gets home-court advantage,\" Murray said. \"That makes this a big win.\"\n\nFlip Murray added 23 points for the Hawks.\n\n\"Flip Murray's 23 points were a killer,\" said Pistons coach Michael Curry, a Glenn Hills High graduate.\n\nThe Pistons cut Murray nearly a year ago.\n\nThe Hawks took the lead late for good in the third quarter, and after Detroit pulled within two with 9.4 seconds left, Johnson made two free throws to seal the win.\n\nThe Hawks (31-21) have won four of five, matching the most wins they've had going into All-Star weekend in a decade after pushing the Boston Celtics to the brink of elimination in the first round last year.\n\n\"That shows that we've got a lot of guys that are hungry last year after getting a taste of success in the first round against the world champs,\" coach Mike Woodson said."
