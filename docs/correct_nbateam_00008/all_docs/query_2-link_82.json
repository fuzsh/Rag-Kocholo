        "text": "Rasheed Wallace has always celebrated the 2004 Detroit Pistons as one of the most surprising championship teams in league history. Forward Draymond Green clapped back at him, though, for claiming that they can beat the 2017 iteration of the Golden State Warriors.\n\nWallace joined the Detroit Pistons in February 2004 when the Atlanta Hawks traded him there as part of a three-team deal with the Boston Celtics. Fortunately, his arrival was timely as the 6’11” big man was instrumental in helping Motor City reach the NBA Finals of that year and winning the ring against a Los Angeles Lakers team that fielded Shaquille O’Neal, Karl Malone, Gary Payton, and the late Kobe Bryant.\n\nThe former Portland Trail Blazers star would go on to play five more seasons in Detroit before spending the final years of his career with the Celtics and New York Knicks. All in all, he retired as one of the most physically imposing players to play the power forward position in the NBA.\n\nFor his part, Green was instrumental in bringing a position-less style of basketball to the NBA. Along with All-Star point guard Stephen Curry‘s outside shooting, the Warriors were able to revolutionize the sport and win four championships along the way.\n\nDraymond Green Claps Back at Rasheed Wallace For Claiming 2004 Detroit Pistons Can Beat 2017 Golden State Warriors\n\nJust recently, Wallace claimed that the 2004 Detroit Pistons can beat Green’s 2017 iteration of the Warriors. The one-time Defensive Player of the Year awardee responded on his X account and clapped back at the one-time NBA champion’s claim.\n\nFor context, Wallace’s 2004 Pistons had a 102 offensive rating and a second-place 95.4 defensive rating during that season. Meanwhile, the 2017 Warriors boasted a 115.6 offensive rating, first among 30 teams, and a second-place 104.0 rating on the defensive end.\n\nJudging from the numbers, Green’s clapback at Wallace may be valid, especially if taking their offense into account. It remains to be seen how Wallace will respond to the Warriors’ forward or if he’ll stay silent on the issue.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
