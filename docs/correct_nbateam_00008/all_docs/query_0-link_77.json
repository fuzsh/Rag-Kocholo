        "text": "Rashed Wallace wants to return to the NBA, which is an awesome development for NBA fans everywhere. The league will never reach a point where more Sheed is not needed. Sadly, it appears no NBA teams are interested in his services.\n\nOne league source who has talked with Wallace recently describes him as \"serious\" about a return to the NBA this season. Nevertheless, no teams contacted by Yahoo! Sports reported that they had any contact with Wallace, or his representative.\n\nThese teams are doing it wrong. How can you not make room for Rasheed Wallace on your roster? I guess I need to explain to all of them why this is an opportunity they can't pass up.\n\nHere's why every team in the NBA should sign Wallace:\n\nAtlanta Hawks: In Wallace's last game for the Hawks, he had a bad shooting night, but still scored 20 points. A team without Al Horford all year could use 20 points from a big man on a bad night.\n\nBoston Celtics: If everyone else on the team played with as much heart as Wallace did in Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals, the Celtics would have two rings. Who better to explain the importance of pacing oneself to a veteran team?\n\nCharlotte Bobcats: Now that Dean Smith isn't coaching, Wallace can finally show off all of his immense talent for a North Carolina team.\n\nChicago Bulls: He already knows how to score in the United Center.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: He's already done what LeBron James did after his final game in Cleveland. The Cavs should sign him as a symbolic gesture so they can finally get closure.\n\nDallas Mavericks: No team better understands Sheed's commitment to playing hard.\n\nDenver Nuggets: Because their big weakness is half-court shooting.\n\nDetroit Pistons: They signed Ben Wallace to a two-year deal just to remember the good ol' days, so they can sign Sheed for four months to do the same.\n\nGolden State Warriors: Their top healthy big man is Andris Biedrins.\n\nHouston Rockets: Their only true center is Samuel Dalembert.\n\nIndiana Pacers: Nobody is better at guaranteeing things will happen in Conseco Fieldhouse.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers: Their top backups are Reggie Evans and Brian Cook. Plus, Chauncey Billups needs someone to rebound his misses again.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers: A.C. Green couldn't guard him 11 years ago.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: The Grizzlies' power forwards are Marreese Speights and Dante Cunningham.\n\nMiami Heat: If you can't beat LeBron James, join him. That's what LeBron would do! (Kidding, sort of).\n\nMilwaukee Bucks: Wallace paired with Scott Skiles will make the Bucks interesting, even if it's for all the wrong reasons.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: You know Sheed is going to push Darko Milicic in practice after Darko did this.\n\nNew Jersey Nets: The Nets' best frontcourt player is Kris Humphries.\n\nNew Orleans Hornets: He deserves the right to get his towel back.\n\nNew York Knicks: A beard-growing contest between Sheed and Baron Davis would improve team morale.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder: Wallace's reputation for being a \"great teammate\" should rub off perfectly on Russell Westbrook.\n\nOrlando Magic: Pairing Sheed with Hedo Turkododo is an opportunity the Magic can't pass up.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: He's better than Tony Battie.\n\nPhoenix Suns: The Suns' medical staff should magically get him back in shape.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers: For old time's sake.\n\nSacramento Kings: That's it, DeMarcus. Embrace your hate! Feel it through your bones!\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: How many people guarded Tim Duncan better in his prime?\n\nToronto Raptors: He's better than Jamaal Magloire.\n\nUtah Jazz: Because you can never have too many big men.\n\nWashington Wizards: I'm sure Flip Saunders would love to have him.\n\nThere you have it, you guys. Now, let's get on it and bring this man back into the NBA."
