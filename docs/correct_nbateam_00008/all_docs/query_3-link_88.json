        "text": "The Detroit Pistons just had one of the worst seasons of all time and quite literally made history because of their failures.\n\nBut there are still certain parts of the team that are exciting, including Cade Cunningham.\n\nEveryone agrees that the young star could and should be the future of the team and the Pistons just took a huge step to make that a reality.\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski is reporting that the Pistons and Cunningham have agreed to a five-year, $224 million max rookie contract extension that could be worth as much as $269 million.\n\nThe news of Cunningham’s massive signing had many Pistons fans applauding and hopeful for what’s to come.\n\nThe vast majority of people said that Cunningham is worth every single penny that Detroit will pay.\n\nLast season, Cunningham averaged 22.7 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 7.5 assists per game and he is still just 22 years old.\n\nThe sky could be the limit for the young player.\n\nMany people are thinking of the team’s future and they definitely envision Cunningham leading Detroit for a long time.\n\nBut many others said that Detroit has to do more than just give Cunningham this contract.\n\nThe front office also needs to compile a good roster for Cunningham.\n\nIf they want any hope of rebounding from this awful season, they have to keep improving the rest of the team.\n\nThe Pistons are intent on doing just that and they have made some moves this summer to put the dreadful 2023-24 season behind them.\n\nSecuring Cunningham for the future was their top priority and now that it’s done, the Pistons can focus on other ways to get better."
