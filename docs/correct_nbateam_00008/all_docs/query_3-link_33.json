        "text": "For almost a year now, former NBA great Rasheed Wallace has been driving to Flint, Michigan, with truckloads of fresh, potable water — a precious commodity in an area where the water has been poisoned by careless decision-making by state and local governments.\n\nAs Wallace states in a recent piece for The Players' Tribune, though Flint's struggles have faded from the media spotlight over the past few months, the problems haven't gone away. And Wallace is rightfully angry.\n\nVia the Players' Tribune:\n\nWhen you woke up this morning, what’s the first thing you did? Took a piss and flushed the toilet? Brushed your teeth? Took a shower? Whatever you did, I’m guessing you used water.\n\nWhat’d you do after that? Made yourself some coffee or tea? Washed the pan you used to cook breakfast? More water.\n\nNow, how about when you got to the office? Did you wash your hands? Did you rinse off the apple you ate for a snack? You definitely used some water.\n\nThat’s all normal, part of our everyday lives.\n\nUnless you live in Flint, Michigan.\n\nYou probably think that, because they’re not all over your TV anymore, the problems of Flint are in the past.\n\nWell, I’ve been visiting Flint for the past year, so let me tell you the truth.\n\nSome of the folks in Flint can’t take showers because their water is still poisoned with lead.\n\nThey have to boil water, pour it into the sink and then wash in it.\n\nYeah, a grown-ass man has to take a bird bath. That s--- ain’t right. It’s still going on today.\n\nAnd it’s not going away anytime soon.\n\nFor Wallace, though, it's not enough that people express their support for Flint or even contribute to the effort. He wants everyone to see the horrible situation with their own eyes.\n\nDon’t nobody feel good about this. It’s a crisis.\n\nI’m telling y’all. Anyone can go up there and see.\n\nWhenever someone — family, friends, former teammates — says to me, “Let me know the next time you’re going up there and I’ll buy a pallet of water,” I just say, “How about you come up with me. How about you come and see how this s--- is for yourself.”\n\nIn Wallace's eyes, there's one kicker that makes this human catastrophe even worse:\n\nAnd, to this day, the people of Flint still have to pay their water bills — they have to pay for water this is still unsafe and contaminated.\n\nThat’s right. They still want those people to pay their [expletive] water bills.\n\nYou'll want to give Wallace's full, heartfelt letter a read, as he condemns how a distance of just a few miles can make all the difference in access to clean drinking water — and explains how an incident in a local restaurant crystallized the nature of the water crisis in Flint."
