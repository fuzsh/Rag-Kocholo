        "text": "Rasheed Wallace may retire this summer, says Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers. If so, it would end a 15-year career where Wallace has scored 15,860 points, 7,321 rebounds.\n\nWallace, who has two-years left on his contact, would also leave the game as the most ejected player of his era, with 30 ejections.\n\nHe also played for the Washington Wizards, Atlanta Hawks, Portland Trail Blazers, and he won an NBA title with the Detroit Pistons in 2004.\n\nRasheed's retirement certainly won't bring any tears to Cavaliers fans. The Pistons (including Wallace) provided plenty of heartache for Cavaliers fans over the years. Plus, fans here were tired of Wallace's whining."
