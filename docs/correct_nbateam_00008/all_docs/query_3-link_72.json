        "text": "The Celtics return home Monday night, as they try for the third time this season to ground the Atlanta Hawks. It’s the second game in as many days for the Green, who\n\nbeat the Toronto Raptors Sunday, 114-107, in Toronto.\n\nBoston lost to Atlanta, 93-85, Friday night in Atlanta.\n\nWith the C’s hoping that the third time will be the charm against the Hawks, here’s a quick look around the Internet at all-things Green and White:\n\nSunday’s win over the Raptors included a pair of big-time individual efforts, Rajon Rondo’s triple-double, and Rasheed Wallace’s highest offensive output since 2007.\n\n• The Boston Herald's Steve Bulpett noted that Rondo's triple-double was completed with a rebound:\n\n\"'I had like 12 guys over on the bench telling me to get a rebound,' he said. Rondo completed the feat by pulling in a Hedo Turkoglu miss with 7:08 left. It's his first triple-double of the season and third of his career in the regular season. Rondo had three in last year's playoffs.\"\n\n• Frank Dell'Apa of The Boston Globe wrote Monday that Wallace's 29-point outing is proof that the Celtics made the correct decision targeting the veteran big-man in free-agency during last offseason.\n\n•\n\nCelticsBlog.com\n\ntook a closer look at Sheed’s Sunday in Toronto and connected the dots even further. Their findings: Rasheed Wallace eats the Raptors for lunch on a regular basis.\n\n• If the Celtics can take comfort in anything leading up to Monday’s game with the pesky Hawks, it’s that Atlanta has been icy on the road of late, losing their last three away from home – including an unsightly 113-81 loss in Orlando Saturday."
