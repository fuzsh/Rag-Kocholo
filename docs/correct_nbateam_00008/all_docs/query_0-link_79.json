Again, only Problem is I don't know if Kobe & other key free agents are willing to come to Atlanta. But they definitely can outbid other teams when it comes down to money.\n\nkobe, Garnett and anyone else out there will at least COURT the hawks in order to get their number up.\n\nOriginally posted by: Reliant\n\nOriginally posted by: juiio\n\nOriginally posted by: Reliant\n\nNaw, the Blazers can easily make the playoffs. They're 24-25 and the number 8 spot is 29-23. Also, the season is only half over, a strong finish to the season and they're in.\n\nAlmost 60%, not 50%.\n\nIf the Grizz maintain their current pace, they'll finish 46-36. That means the Blazers would have to finish 23-10 to finish 1 game ahead. That is very unlikely.\n\nIt is possible, of course, but it would likely take a Grizz (or Nuggets) collapse, since I don't think the Blazers can be that good.\n\nThe Nuggets had a hot start and are something like 10-20 since. They're slumping, but no one is really making a push to catch up to them, the Blazers can do it, along with Utah.\n\nYep. Nuggest down, Portland up. If Portland maintains this pace they give themselves a good shot. I never said it was a lock they were in, but they are certainly in contention for that last playoff spot. I like the trade so much because Wallace's departure gives the Blazers a chance to focus on the positive. If Shareef and Ratliff come in as team players from the get go, they could capture lightning in a bottle and make the playoffs ahead of expectations. Sports is not just about ability, but motivations and keeping a positive outlook regardless of current circumstances."
