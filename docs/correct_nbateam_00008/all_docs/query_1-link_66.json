        "text": "Rasheed Wallace has always celebrated the 2004 Detroit Pistons as one of the most surprising championship teams in league history. Forward Draymond Green clapped back at him, though, for claiming that they can beat the 2017 iteration of the Golden State Warriors.\n\nWallace joined the Detroit Pistons in February 2004 when the Atlanta Hawks traded him there as part of a three-team deal with the Boston Celtics. Fortunately, his arrival was timely as the 6’11” big man was instrumental in helping Motor City reach the NBA Finals of that year and winning the ring against a Los Angeles Lakers team that fielded Shaquille O’Neal, Karl Malone, Gary Payton, and the late Kobe Bryant.\n\nThe former Portland Trail Blazers star would go on to play five more seasons in Detroit before spending the final years of his career with the Celtics and New York Knicks. All in all, he retired as one of the most physically imposing players to play the power forward position in the NBA.\n\nFor his part, Green was instrumental in bringing a position-less style of basketball to the NBA. Along with All-Star point guard Stephen Curry‘s outside shooting, the Warriors were able to revolutionize the sport and win four championships along the way.\n\nDraymond Green Claps Back at Rasheed Wallace For Claiming 2004 Detroit Pistons Can Beat 2017 Golden State Warriors"
