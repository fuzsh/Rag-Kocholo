        "text": "The Knicks don’t see being aged as any kind of barrier and seem to be aware that this will be a full season, unlike last year’s truncated version because of the lockout. Chandler’s Dallas Mavericks team won the 2011 title with an average age of nearly 30.\n\n“Obviously, we’ve got some guys a little over that mark,” Chandler said, “but you know what, the guys that we do have are going to bring great veteran leadership and they bring a calmness around the team that we didn’t have before, and it’s only going to benefit us. In order to win in this league, you’ve got to have veterans.”\n\nCoach Mike Woodson seems to think it will make his job easier. We’ll check in with him again in mid-February.\n\n“[Starting his coaching career with a young Atlanta Hawks team] was fun, but I think the fact that I got this veteran team, it’s going to make life a little bit more easier because they’ve been around and they know how to play,” he said. “And I’ve just got to pace them and direct them and put them in the right position.”"
