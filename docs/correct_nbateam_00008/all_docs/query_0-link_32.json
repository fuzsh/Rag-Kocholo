        "text": "On this date in Boston Celtic history, fan-favorite big man Al Horford signed with the team in 2016. A standout at the University of Florida, where the Dominican center won two national titles in consecutive seasons, Horford was drafted third overall by the Atlanta Hawks, with whom he spent nine seasons before choosing to sign with the Celtics.\n\nThe former Gator left Atlanta in free agency after the Hawks were swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the playoffs two years in a row. He signed a four-year, $113 million contract with Boston. The Celtics made the Eastern Conference finals twice during Horford’s first tenure with the team.\n\nThe Puerto Plata native also made an All-Star team and an All-Defensive second team while with Boston in that stint.\n\nAfter a disappointing 2018-19 season with the team that saw a number of factors destroy a highly anticipated campaign, Horford opted to test the free market.\n\nThe Boston star was tendered a considerable offer by the Philadelphia 76ers that the Celtics did not match. They later traded assets to get him back on their cap sheet — more on that shortly.\n\nHorford struggled in an over-packed Sixers frontcourt and was dealt to the Oklahoma City Thunder the following offseason. He rebuilt his reputation as one of the league’s most complete big men, only to be dealt back to Boston at the end of the 2020-21 campaign.\n\nHe was an instrumental part of the team’s run to the 2022 NBA Finals.\n\nIt was also on this date in 2009 that four-time All-Star Rasheed Wallace signed with the Celtics.\n\nThe former UNC standout played one season with Boston before retiring for two seasons. He averaged 9 points, 4.1 boards, an assist, and a steal per game.\n\nIt was on this date the Celtics lost wing Earl Shannon in 2002.\n\nThe Rhode Island native (who went on to become an FBI agent after his basketball career) played five games for Boston in the 1948-49 season before retiring.\n\nHe averaged 1 point per game over that stretch — rest in peace.\n\nFinally, it is also the day Hall of Fame forward Frank Ramsey passed away in 2018.\n\nThe Kentucky native played nine seasons over 10 years (a year in the armed forces interrupting) with the Celtics, winning titles in seven of them while pioneering the role of the sixth man in the early NBA.\n\nListen to the “Celtics Lab” podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ"
