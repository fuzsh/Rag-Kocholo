        "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) — Rasheed Wallace is credited with turning the Detroit Pistons into champions. They have, in turn, helped him improve his image.\n\nHis teammates and coaches love him, like they always have. Fans adore him, like they have at times. Officials will chat with him, even those who wouldn't in the past, and reporters now get along with him.\n\nWallace's temper made him a notorious member of the Portland Trail Blazers — and the NBA — for seven-plus seasons before he was dealt last year to Atlanta and later Detroit.\n\nHe broke his own league record with 41 technical fouls during the 2000-01 season, and once threatened an official after a game and was suspended for seven games.\n\nWallace tied for the league lead with 25 technicals this season, passing Dennis Rodman on the career list with 227 during his 10-year career, but he was only ejected once and he's regarded more as a winner than a trouble maker.\n\nVeteran official Jack Nies even smiled and laughed with him during Detroit's victory over Philadelphia on Saturday in Game — of the team's first-round playoff series.\"I don't think he acts any different than anybody else,\" Nies said earlier this month, with a grin, without answering another question as he stepped into an officials' locker room.\n\nWallace insisted he still isn't allowed to have a calm conversation with officials, declining to elaborate, and that only the perception of him has changed.\n\n\"I'm still the same person I was in Portland, but it's just a different environment,\" he said Sunday. \"The environment here is more helpful. The environment there is more hurtful. That was just one of the drawbacks of being the only professional team in that city. Here you have us, the Tigers and the Lions.\n\n\"People back there are still mad at me, but it doesn't really bother me. They can try to use me as a scapegoat for their demise.\"\n\nPeople inside and outside the Pistons' organization say Wallace was the reason the Detroit won its third title.\n\nDetroit acquired Wallace, with an expiring contract, from the Hawks in a three-team deal just before the trading deadline last year for reserves and two No. — picks.\n\n\"I was shocked at the time and I still think it's one of the greatest acquisitions that any executive or team could make,\" Philadelphia coach Jim O'Brien said. \"It completely changed around their whole team.\"\n\nThe man who pulled off the trade agreed, and re-signed Wallace last summer to a $57 million, five-year contract.\n\n\"Without him, we're not the world champions right now,\" said Joe Dumars, Detroit's president of basketball operations. \"He gave us just the swagger we needed.\n\n\"I think we've been good for him, too. He's playing with great guys and that's letting people see what kind of guy he really is.\"\n\nFor his \"Student Achiever Program\" and \"Sheed's Squad\" ticket giveaway, Wallace earned the NBA community assist award in February. The Philadelphia native also has annual coat and food drives in his hometown, Portland and Detroit.\n\n\"Those who know Rasheed have never had a problem with him,\" said Steve Kerr, who played with Wallace during the 2001-02 season. \"But he did struggle with an anger problem sometimes in Portland.\n\n\"What's really helped his image is that he's gotten that under control and now he's with a championship team. Winning fixes a lot of things.\"\n\nWallace helped the Pistons get off to a good start defending their title with a 29-point performance in their 106-85 victory over the 76ers on Saturday. When he has the ball at The Palace, the crowd screams \"Sheeeeeed!\" just as the Tigers fans used to yell \"Loooooou!\" when Lou Whitaker made plays two decades ago.\n\n\"Fans here have embraced him and that was even before he helped us win the championship,\" Pistons coach Larry Brown said.\n\nThe 6-foot-11 power forward averaged 14.5 points during the regular season, his lowest-scoring output since the 1998-99 season, and 8.2 rebounds.\n\n\"You look at stats, and you can't measure his value,\" Brown said. \"He's a great interior defender, and out on the floor. He's a superstar who doesn't care about scoring. There's nothing he can't do. He's as good as it gets in terms of playing the right way.\"\n\nDetroit hosts Game 2 in the best-of-seven series with the Sixers on Tuesday. The Pistons routed Milwaukee in the first game of the postseason last year, then lost Game 2.\n\n\"We came back in that second game flatter than a week-old soda,\" Wallace said with one of his countless, humorous one-liners. \"It's a living and learning experience, so I know we'll be ready.\""
