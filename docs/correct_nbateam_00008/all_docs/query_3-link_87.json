        "text": "In the aftermath of the blockbuster trade, which resulted in the Portland Trail Blazers sending superstar guard Damian Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks, the struggling franchise went from being a veteran team on the fringe of being a playoff contender to a team thrust into a rebuilding process, with guard Scoot Henderson being the new star the team wants to build around.\n\nWith the team heading in another direction, head coach Chauncey Billups has had to pivot on the fly, with winning no longer the top priority due to the team not currently built to win games on a consistent basis.\n\nBillups recently opened up about the situation in Portland while talking with his former Detroit Pistons teammate Rasheed Wallace.\n\n“We had a vet team…About 3-4 months later, it changed…I’ve had to kinda just be nimble with all of that stuff and understand like I can’t beat myself up when we lose because we’re not set up to win. I’m not a miracle worker,” Billups said.\n\nAt this point in time, there seems to be no clear plan for the Blazers moving forward, as Henderson didn’t turn out to be the player they were expecting last season in Portland, which may extend the rebuilding process.\n\nWith the Western Conference only getting better over the last couple of years, with young and talented teams emerging like the Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves, it could be a rough stretch ahead of the Blazers and Billups as their chances of even being in the playoff picture seem remote at best."
