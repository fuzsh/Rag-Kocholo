        "text": "For a team that had the second seed in the East sewn up heading into their regular-season finale with the visiting Atlanta Hawks, the Knicks had a pretty eventful Wednesday.\n\nAfter Quentin Richardson re-joined the Knicks on Tuesday, Rasheed Wallace retired again, the team signed Earl Barron—who ended up getting the start—and then the Knicks had to play an actual basketball game, which they won, 98-92.\n\nSteve Popper of The Bergen Record:\n\nCarmelo Anthony, Jason Kidd, Kenyon Martin and just about every Knicks player sat out of the game, but Chris Copeland finished his impressive rookie season by pouring in 33 points against a Hawks team that seemed more interested in playing the Pacers—and avoiding a potential second-round series with the Heat—than facing the fourth-seeded Nets in the first round.\n\nUnfortunately, Copeland was one of several Knicks to suffer a minor injury on Wednesday.\n\nMarc Berman of the New York Post:\n\n\"I'm good. I'll be all right,\" Copeland said, as quoted by Peter Botte of the New York Daily News. \"It doesn't feel too good right now . . . but I'm sure it will be fine by Saturday.\"\n\nShumpert described his injury as a \"bad Charlie horse.\"\n\nIn other Knicks news:\n\n• NJ.com's Tony Williams wrote about Copeland's night: \"One of the few bright spots tonight, however, was the fact that Copeland became the first Knicks' rookie since Bill Cartwright did it in 1980 with back-to-back 30-point games. He's hopeful to take his scoring tear into the playoffs, as head coach Mike Woodson seems to be getting more comfortable with the rookie in key spots with each passing successful outing.\"\n\n• USA Today's Jeff Zillgitt wrote that Carmelo Anthony isn't feeling any pressure this postseason: \"This is why Carmelo Anthony came to New York, and this is why the New York Knicks gave away so much to get him. When the playoffs begin, the team wants to be relevant. And this season, for the first time since 1999-2000 when they reached the Eastern Conference finals, the Knicks are relevant in the postseason... Anthony is responsible for that.\"\n\n• The Wall Street Journal's Chris Herring discussed Anthony's \"accidental scoring title\": \"Anthony secured the scoring crown by recently overtaking Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant with a dominant month of April, in which Anthony averaged 36.9 points per game on 54% shooting overall and 46% accuracy from the three-point line. Those were all steep statistical improvements from the 27.5 points, 43.4% shooting and 36.3% three-point connection rate he'd posted from November to March. By sitting out Wednesday's night game against Atlanta, he finished with 28.7 points.\"\n\n• Fred Kerber of the Post wrote about the threat the Knicks pose to the Celtics: \"There are enough worries about the Knicks to fill volumes of scouting report binders for the Celtics. There's the size factor. There's depth. There's shooting. Even apparent weaknesses are a concern: Suddenly, 'old' becomes 'experienced.'... But Celtics coach Doc Rivers said he gets the biggest headache when he simply thinks of the Knicks offense... 'They're really good offensively. They really are. They spread the floor and they do a terrific job,' said Rivers, whose Celtics lost their regular-season finale, 114-90, to the Raptors Wednesday night before seeing the Knicks in the playoffs starting Saturday at 3 p.m.\"\n\n• Newsday's Al Iannazzone thinks that Kenyon Martin has something to prove this postseason: \"His tattoos, the hard fouls he delivers and all the facial expressions ranging from disdain and disgust to incredulous, dismissive smiles make people think they know who Kenyon Martin is as a person and a basketball player... He's tough, aggressive and physical. But it's been pride and heart that have made Martin a great late February pickup by the Knicks. He's on a mission to show he shouldn't have been unemployed for so long.\"\n\n• Berman believes that Richardson could give the Knicks some help on defense: \"Asked about his days defending LeBron when he played for the Knicks, Richardson said, 'I do have experience playing against him, that possibly could have factored into it. But if we make it that far, and we get to play them, then I'm up for the challenge.'\""
