        "text": "LAS VEGAS — Rasheed Wallace was a problem for most defenders during the height of his playing days.\n\nAssured a place in Detroit Pistons history because of his role in landing the franchise its third title in 2004, Wallace was a matchup nightmare.\n\nYou can add Malik Rose to the list of victims.\n\nThe Pistons' new assistant general manager was asked Thursday to recall his biggest Pistons headache during a 13-year career in which he was part of two championships with the San Antonio Spurs.\n\n“He’s dropped me off a lot of times in my life, in our day,” Rose said with a chuckle. “He was the guy I looked at the most and said it’s going to be a long day. He’s 7-feet. He shoots it from (above his head). And he’s good.”\n\nMore on the Pistons:\n\nPistons will unveil 'pit bulls' during NBA summer league\n\nWindsor: Golden State Warriors just copying the path of past NBA champs\n\nKennard 'comfortable' with look at point guard\n\nThankfully, at 43, Rose’s days as a 6-foot-8 power forward are over.\n\nHe joins the Pistons front office after starting with the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nHe says his role is still being determined — although scouting will be a primary focus.\n\nRose was hired by senior adviser Ed Stefanski and Pistons vice chairman Arn Tellem, the brain trust that replaced former team president Stan Van Gundy after four seasons.\n\nRose, Wallace, Stefanski and Tellem are all Philadelphia natives. Rose has known all three for a while and he jumped at the chance to join the Pistons’ revamped front office.\n\n“These opportunities don’t come up very often,” Rose said. “Anytime you get one, you really have to jump on it. I’m really fortunate that Arn and Ed saw something in me that they wanted to bring me into their environment, their team and here I am. I’m just looking to make the most of it.\n\nAnd so far, so good. He says Stefanski, who is running the front office, encourages a collaborative process.\n\n“He’s really open with everything,” Rose said. “He shares information. He wants your input on it. You have to have a point of view with Ed Stefanski because he’s going to call on it and expect you to know what to say and be able to back up what you want to say. I’m looking forward to it.”\n\nRose said he’s spoken with Wallace recently.\n\nAnd he’s received the Detroit handbook, courtesy of Wallace.\n\n“He’s happy for me,” Rose said. “He’s told me where to go, where not to go. Places to eat, barbershops. Things like that.”\n\nFront office moves\n\nTwo sources told the Free Press that the Pistons are hiring long-time Brooklyn Nets executive Gregg Polinsky as director of player personnel. Polinsky will report to Stefanski.\n\nPolinsky has survived multiple leadership changes since joining the Nets in 2000. He’s spent the last 10 years in a similar position with Nets — although he will have increased responsibilities with the Pistons.\n\nAlso, assistant general manager Pat Garrity and chief of staff Andrew Loomis, holdovers from the Van Gundy regime, are in Vegas with the summer-league team and a source says the two are likely to remain with the franchise\n\nESPN.com's Adrian Wojnarowski was first to report the Polinsky news.\n\nCasey’s staff takes shape\n\nNew coach Dwane Casey has hired Sidney Lowe, Sean Sweeney and D.J. Bakker as assistant coaches.\n\nA source told the Free Press that long-time assistant coach Tim Grgurich is likely to join the staff.\n\nCasey told the Free Press earlier this month that he was recruiting Grgurich, 76, for his staff. He most recently worked for the Milwaukee Bucks. He was let go shortly after the firing of head coach Jason Kidd in January.\n\nFollow Vince Ellis on Twitter @vincent_ellis56."
