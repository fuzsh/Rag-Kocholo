Wallace only played one game with the Hawks, scoring 20 points.\n\nLast season Wallace played with the New York Knicks before retiring in April.\n\nThis is the year of long-time players becoming coaches in the league, as Jason Kidd has returned to the Nets, but this time as their head coach. Former Pistons head coach, Lawrence Frank, will be an assistant coach with the Nets."
