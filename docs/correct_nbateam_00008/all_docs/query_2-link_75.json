        "text": "<p>Talk about a rebuilding job gone awry.</p><p>Five years ago, the Atlanta Hawks decided it was time to start over. They said just making the playoffs wasn't good enough. They wanted to get younger, quicker, more exciting.</p><p>Well, all that got them was five straight seasons of missing the playoffs. So, it's time to start over _ again.</p><p>The Hawks basically cleaned out their roster, leaving only four players under contract for 2004-05. They finished out another losing season with a bunch of guys on 10-day deals, looking more like an NBDL team than an NBA franchise.</p><p>In lieu of wins, they were left to tout things such as effort and a more exciting run-and-gun style that at least made the losses a little more tolerable.</p><p>\"This year was a struggle for everybody, all the trades we had and the new guys coming in,\" said Chris Crawford, one of the few players likely to return next season. \"But I think toward the end we were playing good basketball. We were playing hard and that's all anybody can ask of a team. I was pretty happy with what we accomplished.\"</p><p>Pretty happy? The Hawks finished 28-54, equaling their second-worst record since moving from St. Louis to Atlanta in 1968. And no one had any idea what the future holds.</p><p>Crawford, Jason Terry, Alan Henderson and rookie Boris Diaw are the only players signed up to play for the Hawks next season.</p><p>Top scorer Stephen Jackson (18.1 points per game) can become a free agent. The rest of the roster was pieced together after general manager Bobby Knight decided to dump as many high-priced players as he could before the February trade deadline.</p><p>Starters Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Theo Ratliff were dealt away. Rasheed Wallace was acquired from Portland, played one game for Atlanta and was sent packing, too.</p><p>How desperate did the Hawks become? Jason Collier was signed from the NBDL and went right into the starting lineup. Michael Bradley started at center in the season finale; a month ago, he was waived by Toronto.</p><p>\"It was kind of like we had two teams,\" coach Terry Stotts said. \"We had the first group, then the group that came in after all the trades.\"</p><p>The first order of business for Knight is deciding whether Stotts will return for his second full season. Granted, the coach didn't have much to work with _ especially at the end _ but the Hawks appear to be in need of someone with a higher profile.</p><p>This attendance-challenged franchise could use someone to stir ticket sales in a city that long ago tuned out the Hawks. Plus, it wouldn't hurt to have someone who could do a selling job on prospective free agents, convincing them to take a chance on playing in Atlanta.</p><p>A new ownership group, which was approved late in the season after a tedious sale process, will let Knight decide whether to bring back Stotts for the last year of his contract.</p><p>The two talked after Wednesday night's season finale and agreed to get together in a couple of days to discuss the future.</p><p>\"All the speculation seems to be coming from the media,\" Stotts said Thursday. \"Billy has been very supportive of me and my staff. I'm in the same position as every NBA coach at the end of the season. The team will sit back, evaluate how we did and go from there.\"</p><p>Terry said Stotts deserves another year.</p><p>\"You never give a guy one year to prove what he can do, especially with a year like we've had,\" Terry said. \"Under the circumstances, he's done a good job.\"</p><p>Knight said he will base his decision on what's best for the team, making it sound as though Stotts has a decent chance to keep his job.</p><p>\"This isn't a popularity contest,\" Knight said. \"Half the people are going to be mad at you no matter what. Everybody's not going to be pleased. So you can't worry about what other people think. I'm going to use my judgment and do what I think is the best thing to do.\"</p><p>The Hawks played a more exciting brand of basketball after all the trades, scoring at least 100 points in their last five games, and were actually a little more successful. Atlanta was 18-36 at the deadline and went 10-18 the rest of the way.</p><p>Of course, the last two months really don't mean much for next season _ most of those guys won't be back. And the Hawks did a lot of their scoring at the expense of defense, giving up triple-figure points in 18 of their last 28 games.</p><p>\"It's a fun style to play,\" Stotts said. \"But to win championships, you've got to play defense.\"</p><p>The Hawks are a long way from competing for championships. They're starting over.</p><p>Again.</p>"
