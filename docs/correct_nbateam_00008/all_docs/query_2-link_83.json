        "text": "Free Press sports writer Vince Ellis ranks the five most impactful trades in Pistons history.\n\nBad Boys lay foundation\n\nThe date: Feb. 16, 1982.\n\nThe move: Acquired center Bill Laimbeer and Ken Carr from Cleveland in exchange for forward Phil Hubbard, forward Paul Mokeski and two draft picks.\n\nThe impact: Laimbeer joined forces with Isiah Thomas to form the heart and soul of the legendary Bad Boys team that won two straight NBA titles\n\nMore Detroit Pistons:\n\nGriffin's debut worth the price, at least for one night\n\nNo word on Rasheed Wallace, Tayshaun Prince jersey retirement -- yet\n\nBill Laimbeer settles LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan debate\n\nLanding ’Sheed\n\nThe date: Feb. 9. 2004.\n\nThe move: The Pistons acquired big man Rasheed Wallace from the Atlanta Hawks and guard Mike James from the Boston Celtics as part of a three-way deal that sent guards Chucky Atkins and Lindsey Hunter to Boston and guard Bobby Sura, center Zeljko Rebraca and Celtics forward Chris Mills to Atlanta. The Celtics received Detroit’s first-round pick in the 2004 draft and cash. Atlanta received the rights to Milwaukee’s 2004 first-round draft choice.\n\nThe impact: The move helped propel the Pistons to the 2004 NBA title and was the final move to cement a great era of Pistons basketball that included six trips to the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nMoving on from A.D.\n\nThe date: Feb. 15, 1989.\n\nThe move: The Pistons acquired small forward Mark Aguirre from the Dallas Mavericks for small forward Adrian Dantley and a 1991 first-round pick.\n\nThe impact: The Pistons moved a disgruntled Dantley and helped team chemistry with the addition of Aguirre – the last major move before the two titles from the Bad Boys.\n\nBlake to Motown\n\nThe date: Jan. 29, 2018.\n\nThe move: The Pistons land power forward Blake Griffin, Brice Johnson and center Willie Reed in exchange for Avery Bradley, Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic and a first- and second-round draft pick.\n\nThe impact: The franchise lacks buzz because it’s been close to a decade since the last playoff victory. Griffin’s arrival provides at least a momentary jolt to the franchise.\n\nA.I. wrecks run\n\nThe date: Nov. 3, 2008.\n\nThe move: The Pistons acquired star guard Allen Iverson from the Denver Nuggets in exchange for franchise cornerstone guard Chauncey Billups, forward Antonio McDyess and center Cheikh Samb.\n\nThe impact: Pistons president Joe Dumars tossed a Molotov cocktail into the locker room, ruining the delicate chemistry formed during the run of six straight appearances in the Eastern Conference finals. The franchise has not won a playoff game since."
