        "text": "Randy Livingston (born April 2, 1975, in New Orleans, Louisiana) is a former American professional Basketball player who last played Point guard for the NBADL's Idaho Stampede. He stands 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) and weighs 209 lbs (95 kgs).\n\nLivingston attended New Orleans' famed Isidore Newman School along with standout quarterback Peyton Manning, where he was named the High School co-player of the year in 1992 (with Jason Kidd) and 1993 (with Rasheed Wallace). Livingston also played in the prestigious McDonald's All American Game and Magic's Roundball Classic. After high school, Livingston attended Louisiana State University but only appeared in 32 games over two seasons because of knee problems. He was drafted by the Houston Rockets in the 2nd round (42nd overall) of the 1996 NBA Draft. He was signed as a free agent by the Atlanta Hawks in 1997. He played for the Phoenix Suns during the 1999 season and, miraculously (as this situated never occurred again for Livingston in the NBA), he repeated with them next season, playing his most consistent season so far (79 games, 14 mpg, 4.8 ppg, 1.6 rpg and 2.2 apg). He appeared sporadically (2 games) for the Golden State Warriors during the following season. He played for the Seattle Supersonics in the 2002 season, also dressing up with two teams in the CBA. Livingston would play briefly for the New Orleans Hornets during the 2003 season, for the Los Angeles Clippers during the 2004 season and with the Utah Jazz during the 2005 season.\n\nWas drafted in the 2005 AAPBL Draft but the league folded soon thereafter. Livingston spent the beginning of 2005-2006 in the Turkish basketball league playing for Galatasaray, and joined the Stampede (for whom he had once played whilst the team competed in the CBA) in February 2006. He also appeared in 5 games with the Chicago Bulls in March. In 2006-07 he began with the Stampede once again but, on April 11 2007, signed a contract for the remainder of the season with the SuperSonics, for a second time. This was due to almost simultaneous injuries to Earl Watson and Luke Ridnour.\n\nIn 2006-07's NBDL, his 12.0 points per game for the Stampede were tied for 44th in the league and his 10.5 assists second only to Will Conroy. The following season, as the Stampede were crowned the competition's winners after beating the Austin Toros 2-1, Livingston retired from professional basketball.\n\nAlthough Livingston is officially retired, the Erie Bayhawks of the D-League still drafted him in the expanson draft in hopes of him coming out of retirement.\n\nHonours and awards[]\n\nNBADL Champion: 2007-08\n\nNBADL MVP: 2006-07\n\nAll-NBADL First-team: 2006-2007, 2007-08\n\nAll-CBA Second-team: 1998-1999, 2003-2004\n\nMost assists in an NBADL game (22)\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
