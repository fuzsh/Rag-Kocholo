        "text": "<p>Center Theo Ratliff signed a five-year contract extension with the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday.</p><p>Ratliff, who led the league in blocked shots the last two seasons, played 32 games with the Blazers last season after he was acquired from the Atlanta Hawks with Shareef Abdur-Rahim for Rasheed Wallace.</p><p>The 6-foot-10, 235-pound Ratliff averaged 7.3 points and 7.3 rebounds with the Blazers, along with an all-time franchise-best 4.41 blocks a game. He had 141 blocked shots in Portland.</p><p>For the season, Ratliff averaged 7.9 points, 7.2 rebounds and a league-leading 3.61 blocks a game.</p><p>Ratliff provided a defensive spark for the Blazers. But it came too late as the team failed to make the playoffs for the first time in 22 seasons.</p><p>\"I'm very happy to be here. My family and I decided that this was a city we wanted to stay in. I think we have great talent on this team and we can go far. It's a great team and a great city,\" Ratliff said at a news conference.</p><p>He blocked six or more shots 12 times last season, and tied Bill Walton and Mychal Thompson for the franchise record for most blocks in one game when he had nine against Orlando on Feb. 2.</p><p>Ratliff was the 18th overall pick in the 1995 draft by the Detroit Pistons. He has averaged 8.7 points, 6.4 rebounds and 2.81 blocks in his career.</p><p>\"From the time he arrived in Portland, we identified with Theo's superior play on the floor and his lifestyle and character off the court as a member of the Portland community,\" Blazers general manager John Nash said.</p>"
