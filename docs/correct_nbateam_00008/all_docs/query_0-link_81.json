Throughout his career, Wallace loved to yell, “ball don’t lie” after an opposing player would miss a free throw following a questionable foul.\n\nIn honor of Wallace, we give to you a compilation video of Wallace yelling, “ball don’t lie.”\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSheed even kept the tradition alive while coaching for the Pistons 2013 Summer League team.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GflytjUIf38"
