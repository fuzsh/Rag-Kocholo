        "text": "ATLANTA -- The Portland Trail Blazers traded volatile forward Rasheed Wallace and reserve Wesley Person to the Atlanta Hawks late Monday night for Shareef Abdur-Rahim and two other players.\n\nIn Wallace, Atlanta gets an often-troubled player who's averaging 17 points a game. He drew the ire of NBA commissioner David Stern earlier this season when he told The Oregonian newspaper that the league's white establishment is exploiting young black athletes to enrich itself.\n\nWallace later issued an apology.\n\nLast season, he was suspended by the league for seven games for threatening an official on the loading dock at the Rose Garden Arena after a game. It was the longest suspension ever handed down that did not involve physical contact or substance abuse.\n\nThe announcement of the trade came about 90 minutes after the Hawks beat the Dallas Mavericks 102-96. Abdur-Rahim had 27 points and 10 rebounds in the victory, and is averaging about 20 points this season.\n\nHe goes to the Trail Blazers with center Theo Ratliff and little-used point guard Dan Dickau, a first-round pick of the Sacramento Kings in 2002, who was traded to the Hawks on draft day.\n\nCavaliers 97, Celtics 89: In Cleveland, rookie LeBron James scored 24 points and Cleveland made sure they didn't give Ricky Davis anything more to say with a win over Boston.\n\nZydrunas Ilgauskas added 19 points and 16 rebounds as Cleveland also broke an 11-game slide against the Celtics.\n\nMost important for Cleveland fans was the Cavs beat Davis, who was back in Cleveland for the first time since he was traded to the Celtics on Dec. 15 in a six-player swap.\n\nShortly after the deal, Davis criticized the Cavs, their front office and the city, calling Cleveland \"a black hole.\" Davis apologized Monday.\n\nNuggets 86, Grizzlies 83: In Denver, Andre Miller's 16-foot jumper with 36 seconds left and Carmelo Anthony's two free throws lifted Denver, snapping the Grizzlies' four-game winning streak. Miller and Anthony each scored 20 points."
