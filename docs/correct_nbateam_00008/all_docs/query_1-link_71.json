        "text": "After playing only one game for the Atlanta Hawks, a trade was made and Wallace was sent to Detroit.\n\nWallace helped the Pistons win the next 16 of their 19 games.\n\nThe Pistons may have lost game 2 at home, but their defensive dominance took them the rest of the way.\n\nDetroit defeated Milwaukee in 5 games to advance to the semi-finals.\n\nDetroit was swept by New Jersey in the previous season, but came back with a vengeance in the ’03-’04 semifinals.\n\nThe Pistons won the first two games at home, but the Nets forged ahead with a 3-2 lead.\n\nDetroit went back to their defensive prowess, keeping Jason Kidd from scoring efficiently and holding back the Nets offensive onslaught to take the series in 7 games.\n\nThe Pistons got off to a rocky start in game 1 against top seed Indiana.\n\nIndiana proved difficult to keep down, but ultimately the Pistons stuck to their defensive strength and took the mighty Pacers out of the equation in 6 games, stamping Detroit’s ticket to the NBA Finals, and a showdown with the Los Angeles powerhouse duo of Shaq and Kobe.\n\nDetroit went into the NBA Finals with NBA fans and sports media doubting their survival against the top heavy Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nWithout a superstar on their starting lineup, the Pistons were in stark contrast to the Lakers lineup of Kobe, Shaq, Payton and Malone.\n\nThe Pistons shocked the analysts by taking game one, which many considered a fluke after the Lakers secured victory in game 2.\n\nThat would be the only win Los Angeles had in the series as Detroit used their impressive defense to shut down Shaq, Kobe and any other offensive weaponry the Lakers had at their disposal.\n\n5 games later, it was finished, and Detroit was preparing for a victory parade."
