        "text": "The Knicks finally made the move everyone was expecting when they agreed to terms with free agent power forward Rasheed Wallace.\n\nNew York, as it is their team policy, didn't disclose the terms of the deal but it's believed to be for one year and the league's veteran minimum of approximately $1.7 million.\n\nThe 6-foot-11 Wallace made approximately $156 million during his 15 NBA seasons, so money is obviously not a factor in returning. The mercurial forward has posted career averages of 14.6 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks per game during a career that included stops with the Washington Bullets, Portland Trail Blazers, Atlanta Hawks, Detroit Pistons and Boston Celtics. He is also a four-time NBA All Star (2000, 2001, 2006, 2008), who won an NBA Championship with Detroit in 2004, alongside then-assistant coach Mike Woodson.\n\nHis role on Woodson's team figures to be as the primary backup to Amar'e Stoudemire at the power forward position, as well as spot duty at center behind Tyson Chandler and Marcus Camby.\n\nWallace last played for Boston in 2009-10, averaging career lows of 9.0 points, 4.1 rebounds and 1.0 assists over 22.5 minutes in 79 regular season games (13 starts) and 6.1 points and 3.0 rebounds over 17.1 minutes in 24 postseason games (one start).\n\nHe was originally selected by Washington in the first round (fourth overall) of 1995 NBA Draft, following his sophomore season at the University of North Carolina."
