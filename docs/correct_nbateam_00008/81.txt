ATLANTA - Rasheed Wallace hopes to succeed where Shareef Abdur-Rahim failed.

Following his first practice Monday night since being traded to the Atlanta Hawks, Wallace avoided making any big statements for a team that&#39;s on course to miss the NBA playoffs for the fourth straight year.

``Right now, we&#39;re just going to try to get it off the ground,&#39;&#39; Wallace said. ``There&#39;s 29 games left, so we&#39;re going to try and win at least half of them more than half, actually. That&#39;s our main goal right now.&#39;&#39;

Atlanta acquired Wallace, a two-time All-Star, and swingman Wesley Person in a Feb. 9 deal that sent Abdur-Rahim, Theo Ratliff and backup point guard Dan Dickau to Portland. Wallace replaces Abdur-Rahim as the starting power forward and will make his Hawks debut Wednesday night at New Jersey.

``If we can win at least half of them games, I would say that&#39;s successful,&#39;&#39; said Wallace, who averaged 17 points and 16 rebounds in 45 games with the Trail Blazers this season.

``Out of them 29, win a minimum of 18 to 20, then that&#39;s good. As far as the record goes, I&#39;m really not sure because I don&#39;t really watch the standings or keep track of stats or nothing like that, but hey, we can go ahead and wreck a whole lot of guys&#39; playoffs right now.&#39;&#39;

Abdur-Rahim, a two-time All-Star who grew up in nearby Marietta, never accomplished his goal of leading Atlanta back to the playoffs this despite Hawks management making a guarantee to season-ticket holders before the start of last season.

By last April, head coach Lon Kruger and general manager Pete Babcock were out of work, and the team was up for sale.

Terry Stotts, who replaced Kruger, refuses to concede that the playoffs are out of reach with the Hawks only 4 1/2 games out of the eighth and final spot in the Eastern Conference. Atlanta entered the All-Star break having won three of four.

``We have a challenge of trying to play cohesively,&#39;&#39; Stotts said. ``We were playing very well over the last 15 games, and I think we were starting to gain some confidence.&#39;&#39;

Stotts held practice without Michael Doleac and Joel Przybilla, the centers acquired in a three-team trade Saturday with New York and Milwaukee, because other players involved in the deal had yet to pass a mandatory physical with their new teams. The Hawks traded center Nazr Mohammed to the Knicks.

Regarding Wallace, Stotts believes Atlanta has a new floor leader who can challenge his teammates when necessary.

``He&#39;s a terrific post player, shoots 3s, passes the ball very well, very athletic he brings a lot of versatility to the lineup,&#39;&#39; Stotts said. ``He&#39;s a very good passer out of the double team. He&#39;s long defensively and he bothers shots. He just brings a lot of different dimensions to the team.&#39;&#39;

Injuries to Alan Henderson (sore back) and Travis Hansen (sore foot) are holding back the Hawks, who hope backup guard Jacque Vaughn will return against the Nets after missing three games with a sprained ankle.

Person, an eight-year veteran from Auburn, will play for his third team in two seasons. He averaged double-digit scoring in six of his first eight years with Phoenix, Cleveland and Memphis.

``It&#39;s a lot like training camp, and that&#39;s the key,&#39;&#39; Person said. ``We&#39;ve got to gel as a team and see what we have. I think we had a good practice today, and I think a lot of the guys are pretty upbeat.&#39;&#39;

Wallace, who starred two seasons at North Carolina before Washington made him the fourth overall pick in 1995, knew the Trail Blazers wanted to trade him, but he brushed aside any notions that some fans might consider him a malcontent.

The temperamental forward served a seven-game suspension last year for threatening an official. Three years ago, Wallace set the NBA record with 41 technical fouls. He&#39;s tied for the league lead this season with 12 technicals.

``It really bothers my wife and my kids, but it just rolls off my back like water off a duck,&#39;&#39; Wallace said. ``It really stuck with my wife because she didn&#39;t dig how everybody was talking bad about her husband. At school, my kids had to face it a little bit, but it&#39;s cool. We&#39;re moving ahead to a better time now.&#39;&#39;
