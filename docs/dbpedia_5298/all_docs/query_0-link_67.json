        "text": "You should say:\n\nWhat program he/she presents\n\nHow often you watch/ listen to him/her\n\nWhat s/he does or talk about\n\nand explain why you like this TV or radio presenter.\n\nModel Answer 1:\n\nWith a pleasant personality, the television anchors make a berth among the audience, globally. In India, I prefer programs anchored by beautiful presenter Ayesha Faridi.\n\nPrincipally she is a news presenter and anchors business news events at CNBC TV18 and had continued with the television station since 2003 to 2010, right before joining at ET Now. She usually anchors several programs for the television channel and those include the flagship morning shows, including Power Breakfast, Your Stocks, Bull’s Eye, Bazaar, India Market Wrap, Midcap Radar, The Market and First Trades, few afternoon shows, Market @ Lunch, Riding The Bull, The F&O Show etc. She presents the news and information on different issues and analyses the issues critically. She is also assigned to analyze sector-based reports, a variety of current business trends, fundamental issues of business organizations, presenting investigative reports on the local business climates, general news on finance, and sometimes she is also responsible to link with the external traders and business corporations to get information for reports and more other tasks.\n\nI am an irregular television viewer and mostly watch news only from different channels. But I frequently watch her shows particularly the morning shows. On the shows, she gravely analyses the business issues and prospects of the day for different business companies and organisation. Her micro and macro level analysis help to get ideas about the business situations of any specific company. She analyses the facts with proper information and in some cases, she interviews different renowned business people or economists to bring out the hidden facts and analyse them before the audience. She never presents any news or information without any proper reference and keeps the record too for future use.\n\nAs a business journalist, market analysing expert and television anchor, she mostly discusses the business issues in her shows. She talks about different aspects, the past present and the future of any specific business corporation. Sometimes the discussions become lively and help investors to decide over taking decisions including raising the investment or improving the products conditions and more other relevant phases. Since the discussions are based on the business and the current context, the business people get ideas to resolve their troubles. Mostly the renowned corporations and multinational companies are the regular audiences of her events. Not only she presents the news, she also takes expert opinions for the betterment of any specific sector which is also a beneficial factor for her audience.\n\nI like Ayesha Faridi than any other news presenters for her superb personality and news presentation style. When she speaks, she speaks very clearly. Her pronunciation both the Hindi and English words are adorable and appear natural, and free of all local tones. Moreover, she always picks the best among the experts to opine in her show so that the audience could have a real scenario of the situation and the expert suggestions to recover. Airing time is another fact behind preferring her shows. All her shows are aired at the perfect time when people need it best. Most of the shows begin in the morning when people (especially the businessmen) prepare to get out of the home. After watching the early morning analysis on the television show, they could take the necessary decisions for the day.\n\nModel Answer 2:\n\nLarry King is one of the most successful TV and radio presenters in the USA. He is my favourite presenter and I have been watching his programs for long. He is mostly famous for the interviews with the renowned people across the world. I personally thank you, sir, for this opportunity to let me talk about a TV presenter I really like.\n\nInitially, Larry King was known as Lawrence Harvey Zeiger but it was really a difficult name to remember for his audience. So, he changed his name to Larry King as per the directives from one of his program makers. His early life was filled with struggle and hardly had the chances to show his potentials to the audiences. Finally, he got the chance as a journalist and since then he is on the top of popularity for his analytical skills, ready wits and smartness. In fact, he is an idol for many of the aspiring journalists around the world.\n\nLarry King is most famous for his interview program – Larry King Live which was aired on CNN. He ran the program from 1985 to 2010. This was a live program on the television channel where he took interviews of different people including politicians, celebrities, artists and many others. for his outstanding performance as a host, he has received a large number of awards including 10 Cable ACE Awards, two Peabody etc. He began his career in the 50s and took next 10 years to emerge as a star in this arena. He also played the role of an all-night broadcaster in the national radio in 1978. At present, he hosts Larry King Now and Politicking with Larry King.\n\nThe representation of the programs hosted by King is interesting to me. I am amazed at his semi-informal tones of the interviews. It appears that Larry King is bringing out the truth from the interviewees in a sophisticated manner. Sometimes, the truths are bitter and also raise controversies, I think this is the right manner to interview someone. He knows the methods to discover the inner self of a man. I like the way he asks the very personal questions and the interviewees do not feel shy to answer them to the public. Besides, he narrates some of the special information about the guests at the programs that even amazes the guests as well. Another important aspect that he is one of the most successful hosts who never had any misunderstanding with the guests in his episodes.\n\nLarry King is one of the most influential people in the country. I like him most for some of his personal qualities. He is a radio and television program host and at the same time, he is a writer. He has already written a couple of books after his heart disorder. Moreover, he is a man of charity and has donated to some charitable works. King is a man of benevolence and knows how to respect people and even his opponents. He began his career when he had nothing with him and now he owns a lot of fame and definitely he is rich enough. But he is still the same as he was 40 years ago when he was to begin his career in Florida.\n\nMore Ideas to talk about this Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card topic:\n\nTopic: Describe a TV presenter you like.\n\n1. Bear Grylls is a popular TV presenter across the world. This British presented is mostly famous for the reality show – Man vs. Wild. He presents the programme in an outstanding way. He directly takes part in the dangerous and adventurous activities that amaze the audience. I like this TV presenter because he has overcome all of his physical hindrances towards adventure.\n\n2. In the entertainment world, I adore Oprah Winfrey more than anyone else in the USA. She hosts a talk show and the show has become famous around the world. She hosts the show in a lively manner. She wants to know about various things through the show and digs out some interesting facts about people she interviews. I like Oprah Winfrey for her outstanding talent. In her early life, she underwent a good number of misfortunes and have overcome them. She is the most powerful living woman in the world at present.\n\n3. The media industry in China is filled with different types of people and among them, Elena Kong is my favourite one. She is a multitalented personality and famous as a TV presenter. As I said before, she is a multitalented personality and hosts different types of shows and events on television. Her presentation is exceptional and knows how to satisfy the audience. I like Elena because she performs her role as a presenter exceptionally and her lucid voice attracts everyone’s attention.\n\n4. Among the other television presenters, Carol Nakamura appears different to me. She was a regular presenter of a popular Brazilian television show named Domingão do Faustão. It was a great show. She has a distinctive way of presenting and she also can handle critical situations swiftly. She is my favourite presenter because of her special styles and expressions. She knows how to bring out the potentials from the participants.\n\n5. Karan Johar is a popular TV presenter in India. He hosts a show named ‘Koffee with Karan’. He wants to know about the unknown life events of the local celebrities. In fact, he also tries to get the real facts about controversial matters. I like him because of his outspoken nature. He invites the high-profile Bollywood superstars in his show. He also can speak politely and manages the situations smartly. So, he has been running the show for a long time.\n\nFamous TV presenters around the Globe.\n\nAustralia:\n\nMark Beretta\n\nWaleed Aly\n\nRebecca Maddern\n\nLarry Emdur\n\nNatalie Barr\n\nNatarsha Belling\n\nAndrew O’Keefe\n\nSonia Kruger\n\nJames Brayshaw\n\nJessica Rowe\n\nDavid Campbell\n\nLivinia Nixon\n\nScott Cam\n\nShaun Micallef\n\nJames Tobin\n\nIndia:\n\nAmitabh Bachchan\n\nMandira Bedi\n\nArnab Goswami\n\nAnnu Kapoor\n\nKaran Johar\n\nSalman Khan\n\nAman Verma\n\nUSA:\n\nLarry King\n\nKatie Couric\n\nEllen DeGeneres\n\nOprah Winfrey\n\nRyan Seacrest\n\nJimmy Fallon\n\nSuze Orman\n\nFrank Gifford\n\nDonald Trump\n\nBob Barker\n\nDagmar\n\nTom Bergeron\n\nVanna White\n\nJohn Barrowman\n\nUK:\n\nFiona Bruce\n\nAdrian Chiles\n\nEamonn Holmes\n\nSteve Backshall\n\nAlan Carr\n\nVernon Kay\n\nNatasha Kaplinsky\n\nTess Daly\n\nHuw Edwards\n\nJames May\n\nHazel Irvine\n\nBear Grylls\n\nPhillip Schofield\n\nKirsty Gallacher\n\nJonathan Ross\n\nGabby Logan\n\nCanada:\n\nAlex Trebek\n\nGeorge Stroumboulopoulos\n\nBen Mulroney\n\nDavid Suzuki\n\nTanya Kim\n\nPascale Nadeau\n\nMario Dumont\n\nDiana Swain\n\nPamela Wallin\n\nWendy Mesley\n\nTracy Moore\n\nDawna Friesen\n\nChina:\n\nYang Lan\n\nHacken Lee\n\nShannon Lee\n\nJerry Lamb\n\nNi Ping\n\nSa Beining\n\nKris Wu\n\nWentao Dou\n\nJapan:\n\nKazunari Ninomiya\n\nMino Monta\n\nKai Atō\n\nMasami Nagasawa\n\nAisa Senda\n\nIchiro Furutachi\n\nTamori\n\nAkiko Yagi\n\nItaly:\n\nElisabetta Canalis\n\nGerry Scotti\n\nDanilo Bertazzi\n\nSimona Ventura\n\nPippo Baudo\n\nPaolo Bonolis\n\nMaria De Filippi\n\nRita Dalla Chiesa\n\nFabio Fazio\n\nRussia:"
