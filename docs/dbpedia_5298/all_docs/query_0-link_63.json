Joseph, The Indian Express, October 24, 2001\n\n>>> The Marxists have a vested interest in the poor who constitute their main vote bank. A decline in the number of the poor will lead to a decline in their power and a diminution of their vote bank.

General Musharraf has been successful in not only legitimising his military regime but has also emerged as the closest ally (after Britain) of the US in the present war.

Violence only leads to retaliation, which means bloodletting. Nothing gets satisfactorily solved by violent methods. Most world leaders realise this.

Chrungoo, The Organiser, October 14, 2001\n\n>>> The world, it seems, has got engaged in responding to the terror of terrorist onslaught. The world opinion led by USA is by and large convinced that it is now or never. The calls of \"war', \"do or die\", \"fight to finish\", and \"get ready those Who are in the uniforms\" constitute the resolve to hold the bull by the horns.

This was an incident, I thought, through which destiny was shaking up our political leadership to awaken them to these dangers. ......\n\nMass Immigration Creates Terrorist Haven in Europe\n\nSam Francis, October 18, 2001\n\n>>> America is not the only country to have a problem with Arabic and Muslim immigrants. If you think the consequences of allowing mass immigration from the Third World states of the Middle East are coming home to roost, in Europe they are starting to rip down the whole henhouse. ......\n\nAssam govt. steps up vigil against Laden supporters\n\nTimes News Network, The Times of India, October 17, 2001\n\n>>> Alarmed by reports of possible infiltration by ISI-backed Osama Bin Laden supporters to create communal tension, the Assam police have alerted police stations across the state to step up vigil and watch out for trouble. ......\n\nNo room for Pakistanis in Chinese airlines\n\nOur Political Bureau, The Economic Times, October 17, 2001\n\n>>> The \"all-weather friendship\" between China and Pakistan is under severe strain.

The army action at Akhnoor didn't remain confined to the infiltrators who had crossed over, but targeted the Pakistani bunkers who had provided cover to the terrorists by resorting to heavy firing. ......\n\nThreshold of patience\n\nEditorial, The Hindustan Times, October 17, 2001\n\n>>> The 'punitive action' taken by the Indian army against Pakistani positions in Kashmir shows how the wheel is coming full circle in the region. Although the shelling by the Indian side cannot be put in the category of 'hot pursuit', an idea which has long been aired on this side of the border, it nevertheless underlines how India's patience is wearing thin. ......\n\nSmashing Taliban's vibrant drug network on US agenda\n\nDonna Leinwand, Toni Locy and Vivienne Walt, The Hindustan Times, October 17, 2001\n\n>>> As American bombers continue to pound Taliban facilities in Afghanistan, US officials say the campaign against the terrorist-friendly regime inevitably will target its biggest moneymaker: a vibrant drug network that supplies more than 70 per cent of the world's opium.

Many of Delhi's literary luminaries refused to comment on the award after it was announced and very few had good things to say about the author. The usual buzz when an Indian or a person of Indian origin makes it big in the global arena seemed missing, at least in the Capital's publishing circles. ......\n\nAnti-US protests in Nigeria turn violent, 16 killed\n\nEmeka Madu, The Economic Times, October 14, 2001\n\n>>> Nigerian authorities clamped a night curfew on the northern city of Kano and issued a 'shoot on sight' order after at least 16 people were killed in anti-American riots on Saturday, officials and residents said.

My Fatwa Of Dissent\n\nMir Ali Raza, Outlook, October 22, 2001\n\n>>> After September 11, the world has suddenly became a more difficult place for the Muslim.

Sudarshan, Outlook, October 22, 2001\n\n>>> The published evidence on which the US is pursuing its war on Osama bin Laden and his associates wouldn't stand up to legal scrutiny. This became obvious from the howls of disbelief of the British media when Prime Minister Tony Blair made public a document, \"Responsibility For the Terrorist Atrocities in the United States, 11 September 2001\", which was based on evidence supplied by the US. ......\n\nThree Cheers\n\nMariana Baabar, Outlook, October 22, 2001\n\n>>> They said it could never happen. But it did and that too at a mere stroke of the pen. The infamous 'state within a state', one of the aliases of the all-powerful Inter Services Intelligence (isi), has been finally reined in. With it, amid all the enveloping gloom, there is renewed hope of the Pakistan army regaining the liberal ethos it had during the reign of Field Marshal Ayub Khan. ......\n\n'India Will Have To Fight Its Own Battle'\n\nOutlook, October 22, 2001\n\n>>> His comments tinged with realism about the lack of formal guarantees to India of a 'Phase II' in the international war against terrorism that would strike at Pak-sponsored terrorism, a combative Union home minister L.K.

Asim Hussain managed to speak to him on telephone, till the lines were disconnected by the military authorities. ......\n\nShort-Circuited Jehadi Robots\n\nAmir Mir, Outlook, October 22, 2001\n\n>>> Pakistan is simmering. And it only takes a religious leader to fan the smouldering embers to suck towns and cities into a vortex of fury-shops and cars are set afire as frenzied people take to streets shouting slogans against the US and President Pervez Musharraf, clashing intermittently with the police. The Pakistan government could well succeed in preventing the fire from spreading, but, for the moment, it's anxious. ......\n\nThe Split Screen Syndrome\n\nOutlook, October 22, 2001\n\n>>> It was one of the oddest phone calls ever made. US Secretary of State Colin Powell phoned the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, to ask for some censorship of the Al Jazeera satellite TV channel which has had exclusive access to Osama bin Laden and his men. The Emir politely declined, citing media freedom to the American leader. ......\n\nNobelity, At Last\n\nKhushwant Singh, Outlook, October 22, 2001\n\n>>> When I got the news of V.S. Naipaul being awarded this year's Nobel Prize for Literature, I was delighted and felt I had been vindicated. I was delighted because I have known him as a friend for over 35 years. I have met his first wife, who was English, and get on famously with his charming, vivacious present wife, Nadira, who is Pakistani Punjabi. ......\n\nFrom Kabul To Kashmir\n\nPrem Shankar Jha, Outlook, October 22, 2001\n\n>>> India's media would do the country a service if it was to discard its preoccupation with the possible shifts of US policy on the Kashmir issue and devote more attention to the shifts in geopolitics the US air strikes on Afghanistan have initiated. That many of these could make governance more difficult in India, with 140 million Muslims, goes without saying. ......\n\nBSF jawan unfurls Pak flag at durgah\n\nThe Times of India, October 20, 2001\n\n>>> A Border Security Force jawan was beaten up by enraged people after he allegedly hoisted a Pakistani flag at a durgah in Nyaydongri village in Nandgaon tehsil of the district on Thursday, police said on Friday. ......\n\nPak has to save its nukes to fight India: Minister\n\nThe Times of India, October 20, 2001\n\n>>> In a bid to pacify hardliners opposed to Pakistan supporting the US military action in Afghanistan, a senior minister has urged the Islamic clerics to restrain their emotions towards Taliban as Islamabad has to \"save its nuclear assets to fight a war against India.\" ......\n\nHunt down all terrorists\n\nP. M. Kamath, Free Press Journal, October 19, 2001\n\n>>> Though India was first to have offered help to the US, it is in the fitness of things that the US should use Pakistan rather than India in its immediate aim of bringing to books terrorists involved in the attacks against them. Geopolitical location, access to Taliban and ability to share intelligence on Osama bin Laden- all favour Pakistan rather than India. ......\n\nSyrian defense minister blames WTC, Pentagon attacks on Israel\n\nArieh O'Sullivan, Tel Aviv, October 19, 2001\n\n>>> At a meeting in Damascus last week with a delegation from the British Royal College of Defense Studies, Tlass said the Mossad planned the ramming of two hijacked airliners into the WTC's towers as part of a Jewish conspiracy. ......\n\n600 Kashmiri militants guarding Osama: Jane's\n\nA Chalomumbai Correspondent, Mid-Day, October 19, 2001\n\n>>> Over 600 Lashker-e-Toiba (LeT) militants have been placed at strategic locations to guardinternational terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden, Janes Defence Weekly has reported. ......\n\nAl-Badr warns India against 'misadventure'\n\nRediff on Net, October 19, 2001\n\n>>> The Pakistan-based chief of Al Badr has warned India that it would be \"taught a tough lesson\" if it acts against Kashmiri mujahideen groups, Online news agency reports. ......\n\nThe Delhi Two-Step\n\nEditorial, The Wall Street Journal, October 19, 2001\n\n>>> As Colin Powell touched down in Pakistan on Monday for talks with President Musharraf, he was greeted with what sounded like a 21-gun salute. Except that the guns were Indian and fired not in Mr. Powell's honor but at Pakistani army posts on the Line of Control dividing India from Pakistan in Kashmir. ......\n\nCNN reporting?\n\nVaman Rao, October 19, 2001\n\n>>> I am pained to agree with a recent article in the eminent daily, the Economic Times (October 19, 2001), that CNN should henceforth be called PNN - the Propaganda News Network or Pakistan News Network. The CNN reporting in the aftermath of 9-11 attack on WTC and Pentagon and subsequent attack on Afghanistan has become so shallow and erroneous that watching news reports from CNN has become an exercise in mis-education. ......\n\nAnti-Western and Extremist Views Pervade Saudi Schools\n\nNeil MacFarquhar, The New York Times, October 19, 2001\n\n>>> The textbook for one of the five religion classes required of all 10th graders in Saudi public high schools tackles the complicated issue of who good Muslims should befriend.

The ancient Nandeeshwara temple at Malleswaram 17th cross was discovered only three years ago, but it has stood for 7,000 years on that spot. Being buried over the years hasn't diminished its aura at all. It still draws huge crowds all day. ......\n\nMcDonald's embraces Islam in Indonesia\n\nTomi Soetjipt"
