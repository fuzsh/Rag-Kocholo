        "text": "A phalanx of ten top stock pickers has recommended ten top-quality stocks for us to buy now. These are ideal “buy and forget” stocks which will effortlessly compound our wealth over the next 10 years and longer\n\nETNow celebrates 10 years of success\n\nETNow, which has dynamic journalists like Ayesha Faridi, Nikunj Dalmia and others, recently celebrated its 10th year of excellence in reporting.\n\nEminent Billionaires Adi Godrej, Ajay Piramal and Kiran Majumdar Shaw were amongst the many who rushed to congratulate ET Now for the great achievement.\n\n[Throwback picture of Ayesha Faridi and her distinguished colleagues]\n\nGift for novices – 10 stocks for 10 years\n\nThe novices of Dalal Street deserve to be rewarded because we have been loyal viewers of ETNow and have contributed to its immense prosperity.\n\nSo, the mandarins persuaded ten of the topmost stock pickers to recommend ten high-quality stocks to us.\n\nThe stocks recommended are as follows:\n\nStock Recommended by CMP (Rs) YoY Gain (%) Basant Maheshwari Titan 1292 49 Vijay Kedia Repro 494 (30) Porinju Veliyath Tata Global 262 2 Sandip Sabhrawal Britannia 2830 (5) Atul Suri HDFC Life 438 (7) Samit Vartak Edelweiss 177 (42) Rakesh Arora Grasim 897 (11) Pankaj Murarka Syngene 335 12 Manish Sonthalia DCB Bank 230 32 Vinay Khattar Titan 1292 49\n\nTitan – Basant Maheshwari\n\nBasant is known to be a stickler for quality.\n\nHe has been tutoring us from time immemorial to steer clear of alleged “chakri” stocks and to buy only high-quality stocks even if they are quoting at high valuations.\n\nTitan is a sensible choice given that it is the crown jewel in the portfolio of Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, the Badshah of Dalal Street.\n\nRakesh Jhunjhunwala holds a colossal quantity of 7% of Titan, worth a mammoth Rs. 8000 crore.\n\nIn fact, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala had publicly recommended Titan to us in 2003 when it was quoting at a beggarly valuation of Rs. 3 (adjusted for split & bonus).\n\nIf we had obediently listened to him and bought the stock, we would be multi-millionaires today.\n\nHowever, as usual, we were rebellious and defiant with the result that we are continuing to wallow in poverty.\n\nIt is worth noting that some experts on technical analysis are somewhat diffident about Titan’s prospects.\n\nOne has claimed that the charts are looking “scary” and that the stock can plunge into depths never seen before.\n\nTGBL – Porinju Veliyath\n\nPorinju Veliyath’s investing philosophy is diametrically opposite to that of Basant Maheshwari.\n\nUnlike Basant, Porinju has a healthy contempt for blue-chip quality stocks.\n\nHe has claimed that buying such stocks does not require any skills and even a “SSC pass” can do so.\n\nHowever, Porinju knows better than anyone else that when one is offering stock recommendations to raw novices, it is better to tread with caution and stick to blue-chips.\n\nSo, he has recommended his all-time favourite blue-chip, Tata Global Beverages Ltd alias TGBL.\n\nAccording to other experts, the impending transfer of the FMCG businesses of Tata Chemicals to Tata Global and the renaming of the latter to ‘Tata Consumer Products‘ will transform the fortunes of TGBL and set it on the multibagger path sooner than later.\n\nRepro – Vijay Kedia\n\nRepro India is the crown jewel in Vijay Kedia’s portfolio of multibagger stocks.\n\nAs of date, he holds a treasure trove of 6.51% of Repro’s equity, worth Rs. 36.9 crore.\n\nVijay Kedia’s fascination for Repro India arises from the fact that he strongly believes that the Company will “disrupt” the publishing sector and generate mega multibagger gains the way Apple did.\n\nOther seven stocks\n\nThe other seven stocks recommended by the other distinguished experts also need no introduction."
