        "text": "The ever popular daytime crime drama Father Brown returns for an eleventh series. Mark Williams returns as the crime busting priest with guest cast including Sylvester McCoy (Doctor Who, The Hobbit), Ingrid Oliver (Watson and Oliver, Doctor Who), Ian Gelder (Game of Thrones, His Dark Materials) and John Light (Around the World in 80 Days, Murder in Provence). Lorna Watson also returns as Sister Boniface, reuniting the fan favourite crime solving duo.\n\nSeries 11 picks up in 1955 where Chief Inspector Sullivan (Tom Chambers) and Mrs Devine (Claudie Blakley) have grown closer since we saw them last. Something which hasnât escaped the notice of Father Brown (Mark Williams) and Brenda (Ruby-May Martinwood).\n\nWith a food fayre to die for, a real life crime at a crime writing festival and a village rivalry that turns deadly at the local Olimpicks, thereâs plenty for the gang to be busy with. Father Brown and Sister Boniface become embroiled in a murder at an arts and crafts fair, while Brenda takes a trip in time to face ghosts from her past when an old friend, Dr McClurgy (Sylvester McCoy), reaches out. Meanwhile Father Brownâs frenemy Flambeau (John Light) returns with his estranged father, Gabriel (Ian Gelder), in tow and a dangerous mission in mind...\n\nFather Brown is a BBC Studios Drama Production for BBC One and BBC iPlayer. The Script Producer is Dawn-Coulson Beckett, the Line Producer is Michelle Brown, the Series Producer is SeÃ¡n Gleeson and the Executive Producer is Neil Irvine. Helen Munson is the Commissioning Editor for BBC Daytime. Series 1 to 11 of Father Brown are internationally distributed by BBC Studios.\n\nFather Brown Facts\n\nFather Brown, which first aired on BBC daytime in 2013, is now a global success with 120 episodes now made (including the 10 due to air in Jan 2024)\n\nIt is the number 1 UK Daytime drama of the last decade\n\nIn the UK, series 10 averaged 2.6m across all screens for the ten episodes and is currently ranking as the #1 daytime drama of 2023 to date.\n\nAcross all series in the UK, a combined total of 22.6 million viewers have tuned into watch (Reach 3+ min)\n\nThe series continues to be a hit internationally and is viewed by audiences in US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Hungary, Poland, South Korea and Japan.\n\nQ&A with Mark Williams (Father Brown)\n\nWeâre at the 11th series of Father Brown. What is the continuing appeal for you of working on this great series?\n\nThe chief attraction for me is that I never get bored. I've never been bored on this job - which is an incredibly unusual thing for an actor to say. Father Brown is constantly interested in everything that goes on around him. I find that easy to generate because so am I.\n\nTell us moreâ¦\n\nHe's looking at the world all the time and there's always something to see. He is fascinated by the arrangement of life itself and the way people deal with each other and the things they don't say. That is what Miss Marple said: it's the unimportant things that are important. Itâs very much the same for him. He has that Miss Marple thing of being the quiet observer. Increasingly, not so quiet sometimes actually! We've moved away from Chestertonâs Father Brown, and that's probably my fault. He is a lot more proactive now. And he seems to be picking a lot of locks lately, which we may have to address!\n\nWhat highlights should we be looking out for in the new series of Father Brown?\n\nWe have got some very good plots this year. In one episode, Sister Boniface gets arrested, but it's not her fault, funnily enough. To be continuedâ¦ We also have a really nice episode about Brenda, which we're filming at the moment. It's about what happened to her when she was an evacuee. A letter has been written and thereby hangs a tale. We have to deal with a double murder â one historical and one contemporary, so it's a really strong plot. We have got a crime writing festival, too, which is great. It's lots of shenanigans about crime and people's enjoyment of it, and then suddenly it becomes very real for people.\n\nHave you come up with any plots yourself this year?\n\nYes. There is a plot that revolves around a dance competition coming up that was my idea. I thought we should do that because we have two dancers in the regular cast. It seemed to me that was a facility we should use!\n\nSylvester McCoy, a former Doctor Who, is also guest starring as a doctor in this series, isnât he?\n\nYes, a Doctor playing a doctor. How meta! He is called Dr McClurgy. Itâs a great name and he is a great character. He's a cantankerous old bloke. But Brenda wins him round, luckily.\n\nFather Brown has such a great history of attracting guest stars. That's part of the attraction of the show, presumably?\n\nItâs certainly an appeal for me. One of the chief joys for me is that every episode we have different people on. I just love watching them work. Sometimes I forget to concentrate and just go, âLook at them! Wow! Look at them doing acting!â Because I actually like actors. There are some actors who don't like other actors, but I do. I like them very much. It's great because not only do we move locations regularly, but we have different cast members, too. Although it is sometimes nice when itâs just the five of us. We did a scene together last night, and we were all going, âItâs so nice just to be the five of us.â\n\nHas any other TV detective influenced your performance as Father Brown?\n\nI was a big fan of the American series that we got in the 70s, like Colombo. I have to acknowledge the debt really to Peter Falk. I like his style of being on the back foot and slightly off the beat. As an actor, you don't necessarily think that rhythm should be important, but actually it is. Because if you do everything at the same beat, you will die of boredom. So it's better to vary the rhythm. And Peter Falk was a very big influence for me. I actually got Colomboâs catchphrase into one show. I was about to leave and I turned around and said, âJust one more thingâ â which I was pathetically pleased about! I've also got another Colombo nod coming up, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. It's just something that Peter Falk used to do, which I'm going to use.\n\nWhy do the clergy lend themselves so well to crime solving?\n\nBecause they're outside society. They're not like policemen. They're not dealing with politics or other people. They have a spiritual realm, so they have somewhere else to come from when they view the world. And also they have a faith, which gives them an interior strength. They are right in the middle of the community as well, but not really of the community, particularly Catholic priests who are celibate. Father Brown is driven by something beyond merely solving the crime. For him, it's not an intellectual puzzle in the Sherlock Holmes tradition. The reward is not to solve the puzzle; the reward is somebody's soul. When the peace of the world is riven by bad things, he wants to put them right. He wants there to be peace.\n\nHave you thought how long you might play Father Brown for?\n\nI donât really do that. I think it's bad for the soul. In this business, planning for the future is an extremely dangerous preoccupation. You have only got one job at a time. You never know whether you're going to work again, which is one of the cruelties of this business, along with rejection. Which is why itâs amazing that so many people do it year after year in the face of these terrible setbacks and unemployment!\n\nWhen was the last time you went to confession?\n\nI've never been to confession. I confess to myself in the dark watches of the night. I do that regularly and with zeal. So I confessed to myself last night, for example.\n\nHave you ever sworn while wearing your cassock?\n\nOh, yes, regularly, off camera. It's a good antidote because being good all the time can be a little bit trying. Especially when you're wearing about 20 pounds worth of cloth and the sweat is running down your back, a good curse is sometimes a great idea!\n\nFather Brown is shown in many different territories all around the world. Why has it struck such a universal chord?\n\nI think it's good storytelling. That's what it's about. It's also familiar in the sense that the same things happen in each episode. But then the same things happen in every single Haydn symphony. It doesn't make them any less individual, to use a probably over-wrought musical analogy - but there you go, I did it! So there's that. And also there is the whole appeal of the whodunit, to which there is always a resolution. There's an ending. It's solved. So you can put it away afterwards and say, âRight, that's good. We solved that. We learnt about the human conditionâ.\n\nWhat is the most unusual place you have been recognised?\n\nA little girl in a sweet shop in Cartagena ran up and wrapped her arms around my legs and went, âFather Brown!â It happens quite regularly. You can be in all sorts of places.\n\nQ&A with Tom Chambers (Chief Inspector Sullivan)\n\nHow is Chief Inspector Sullivanâs relationship with Mrs Devine evolving in this series?\n\nThereâs a woman's touch and then there's the divine touch! Mrs Devine has that. Itâs a lovely relationship developing between them. Itâs just a very natural connection between them. It was immediate. Heâs always carried a torch for her. From the very beginning, they had an instant chemistry.\n\nHas Mrs Devineâs arrival brought Sullivan an added dimension?\n\nDefinitely. The lovely thing about Mrs Devine coming in is that it's given Sullivan a completely new, fresh layer. I've always felt that once you're a policeman, you always have to be a policeman. It's harder to play other dynamics because you are serving society and that's basically how you have to be seen. So where the other people in the cast could be a bit more flexible with their behaviour, I was always associated with being a policeman. If a policeman turns up on your doorstep, even if he is undercover, he's got an air about him of being a policeman or a detective. So the great thing for Sullivan and for the audience is now there's this extra depth to him. We can see two sides to him. Itâs great for me playing Sullivan because now there's another part of him to explore.\n\nHave you enjoyed working with Claudie?\n\nAbsolutely. She is sensational. She is utterly brilliant. She is very lively and effervescent and cheeky. It's such fun doing scenes with her.\n\nIs Sullivan still often in conflict with Father Brown?\n\nYes. Sullivan has always been on the path of trying to do good. He's a true, loyal detective. Unfortunately, he is always outwitted by the extremely clever and observant Father Brown. Sullivan has to just go on the bare facts, whereas obviously Father Brown can always read between the lines and spot the hidden clues. So Sullivan is in a constant battle with Father Brown.\n\nDoes this provoke tension between Mrs Devine and Sullivan?\n\nYes. There is sometimes a difficult triangle because Mrs Devine is helping Father Brown and Sullivan is aware of that. Therefore, she's conflicted, playing two sides and trying to be loyal to both. There is a moment where Mrs Devine does let Sullivan down because in his eyes she's practically broken the law to help Father Brown. So yes, itâs not a relationship battle, but itâs definitely testing at times.\n\nAre the other regular characters aware of Sullivan and Mrs Devine's \"secret relationship\"?\n\nYes! The funny thing is, Mrs Devine and Sullivan think they're doing a good job of hiding from the others the fact that they are now an item and very much in love. But it's very obvious to the others that they are together!\n\nWhy do you think Father Brown has been such a hit all over the world?\n\nFirst and foremost, because itâs about kindness. Even though thereâs a murder every week, the Father Brown series has a depth of kindness to it. It's just got this unique flavour to it, where the writing and the relationships and the period all work really well. It's like reading a wonderful Jane Austen novel, where there's a real depth and honesty and truth to it. The world it portrays is something that we can all aspire to or relate to. So overall, there's an incredible warmth within the stories.\n\nAnything else?\n\nAlso, we're all intrigued by suspense and mystery and murder. It's something that our brains plug into maybe because the mystique gives us a bit of an adrenaline rush. In Father Brown, it's done in such a way that it's easily digested and watched as well. Within the spectrum of some of the really gritty, current serial-killer shows, which can be quite harrowing, itâs not too graphic. Those modern shows are utterly brilliant, but I think there's also a great desire to soften the palate a bit. This has got such great style.\n\nWhat other elements attract so many viewers worldwide?\n\nMark Williams playing Father Brown. He does it in a way that's just so gentle and intelligent. He would be your go-to person in any situation. He is somebody you can always trust; he is loyal, devoted. So Mark is probably the greatest reason why it's such a huge success. I still can't get my head around how much he has to do and how much he invests personally in Father Brown. He is aware of every single degree of the production. He knows what slices of characters do what, when and how. He is like an encyclopedia on the set for us. I actually go to him if I've got a question. Heâs such an oracle. Mark is just outstanding\n\nWhich episodes should we watch out for in the new season?\n\nThere is one episode that features ballroom dancing. There's a dance school that Mrs Devine and Brenda attend. They get a phone call to say that some talent spotters from a big TV show are coming. And obviously there's a murder â who would have thought it? But Sullivan is not impressed by dancing at all because when he was growing up, his dad made him go to lots of policemen's balls, and he was made to dance with his mum which he didn't like at all. So he has no interest in getting involved or going to watch Mrs Devine dance. Then something happens, and he has to come to the rescue. He has to step in, and step in he does.\n\nWhat other delights do we have to look forward to in this series?\n\nIn this lovely world of Father Brown, weâve got the Kembleford Olympics. This includes things like a spinach-eating contest, toe-wrestling and shin-bashing. It's unlike any other Olympics you've ever witnessed! I may have to get a stunt double for the feet. Alternatively, it may be the first time I've ever had a pedicure. They've offered me one, but I still haven't accepted!\n\nQ&A with Claudie Blakley (Mrs Devine)\n\nAre you enjoying playing the burgeoning romance between Mrs Devine and Chief Inspector Sullivan in this season?\n\nYes, I'm really loving it. It's great. The fact that Sullivan decided to stay was a nice surprise for Mrs Devine. She is hoping that something will develop there. Itâs lovely for her to have that hope because I think she's ready for a new adventure romantically, I really do. I think it's been tough for her, nursing her husband after he was injured. Itâs been hard. Why shouldn't she have another little chance and other little go at it? Itâs good to meet somebody at her time of life.\n\nWhat does Mrs Devine see in Sullivan?\n\nThere is just a connection between them. She has got so much empathy for him initially during his clashes with Father Brown. She's very empathetic, and then that moves on to something else. He's quite twinkly with her, and he's full of surprises. In one of the episodes, Mrs Devine drags Sullivan into performing as an actor, and he's really good. That's attractive. Heâs a man full of mystery who can suddenly turn his hand to anything. Acting is her passion as well. So for him to suddenly show that he is a really good actor may have helped her see him in a different light. He is mysterious, too, isn't he? He's deep. Heâs got a lot going on.\n\nHow would you describe Mrs Devine?\n\nSheâs just such a fun, sunny, optimistic character who I believe brings out the best in people. Sheâs really refreshing. What works so well in her relationship with Father Brown is that she comes things from another angle. She can spot things from a different perspective. Sheâs good that connecting with people because of all her amateur dramatics. She's a people person. She's social, and she's gossipy and so she hears things. That makes for a good dynamic with Father Brown. I think they work well as a team. Itâs also great fun driving around the Cotswolds like a madwoman!\n\nDo you relish driving around in the vintage car?\n\nYes. In my first week on Father Brown, I got behind the wheel. I got to really put my foot down. The camera was attached to the car and I had to nearly run someone over. I had to hit him with the door and he flew off. And I just thought, âOh my God, this is going to be the best job ever!â\n\nWhy is Mrs Devine so good at helping Father Brown with his sleuthing?\n\nBecause she's got an innate curiosity about people. She has already proved that she can be a really good asset to him. Father Brown has always been on her radar, and she just thinks he's amazing. So she just wanted a chance to be a little part of it. I don't think she realised how it would go in terms of the status that she now has with him. But yes, she's good at it because she is very intuitive and practical.\n\nWhat is the atmosphere like on set?\n\nWe all get on like a house on fire. We go out together. We are a tight team and we have a close friendship. There's lots of banter, and that creates really good chemistry. So when the cameras are rolling, there's already a spark. And when the five of us are in a scene together, the rapport is tremendous. It is intense. It's a tough filming schedule, so we all help each other out. We all hold each other up. Thereâs a strong bond, there's a lot of support, and there's a lot of love. And that applies to the crew as well. Everyone seems to be funny on this job, especially Mr. Williams. He's making us laugh a lot.\n\nHow has it been working with Mark?\n\nItâs wonderful! He's intensely likeable. Heâs just got that likeable thing that you can't put your finger on. Heâs got great warmth and that marvellous face. He's got that friendly look, those twinkly eyes, that lovely smile. It's something that the camera really picks up. It all comes through, and that connects to the audience. His physicality is lovely, too. When he is thinking, you go, âOh, what's he thinking? What's going on?â And I adore his mannerisms. He is like a little bird. I just love what he does. Itâs like he paid me to say this, isn't it?!\n\nWhat do you like most about portraying Mrs Devine?\n\nThere is nothing really not to like about playing this character. I really, really love it. Mrs Devine just brings up my mood. Itâs a joy. I can't wait to get to work every day!\n\nQ&A with John Burton (Sergeant Goodfellow)\n\nSergeant Goodfellow is a widely adored character, isnât he?\n\nYes, he is a really popular character. I hear that a lot. I think he's just a genuine man. He's not got any bad side to him. He is just decent, honest, loyal, trustworthy, all those credentials that you'd want in a police officer. And you have to remember that he's grown up in this village and married into the village. He is one of Father Brownâs parishioners. He's probably joined the police because his dad was in the force. It's that sort of vibe I get from him. I think people buy into that nice, salt of the earth type of character. So I think that's probably why he is so widely liked. I do get ever such a lot of feedback about the character from social media. When that happens, you go, âWow!â It just amazes me.\n\nWhat you enjoy most about the job?\n\nI love it when itâs just the five main regular characters in a scene together. Yesterday, we got to do one of those scenes, which is really rare, and everyone was talking about it. When we're all in a scene together, we are just like kids at school. People are laughing and joking. It's just great fun. Itâs a really good mix of personalities, and we all spark off each other. And that's what happens. You can just tell that the energy is there within the scene.\n\nWhy is Father Brown such a big hit all over the world?\n\nIt's a number of things. Itâs because of the storytelling definitely, but viewers also adore all the other elements that come into the programme. That's everything from the guest artists and the writing and the hair and makeup to the settings and the locations. It all just comes together. And you get these wonderful episodes that people simply love.\n\nWhatâs it like working with Mark?\n\nItâs terrific. Heâs such a brilliant actor to work with. He is also incredibly well read. If you want to know anything, ask Mark, from what that tree is to what that bird is sitting in that tree. He's very, very knowledgeable. With some of the things he comes out with, I ask, âHow on earth do you know that?â âI read it.â When he comes to work on the very first day of the shoot, he always brings loads of books, and they could be about anything. A few years ago, we did an episode that involved Goodfellow looking at this medical journal from the 1950s and talking about how someone could have been poisoned. It was a real book. Mark grabbed it off me and went, âLet me look at that.â He was thumbing through it and he said, âI'm going to buy this.â Then he went online whilst we were there, and he bought the book. He said, âItâs really interesting. I can find out stuff about medicine in the 50s.â\n\nWhat else have you learned from Mark?\n\nIn this series we are doing episode about vampires, and I gather that was his idea. Mark found a true story about a vampire slayer in the Cotswolds in the 50s. Heâs obviously done some research. So that's what I mean about him being very well read. He's really, really clever. He is off the scale intelligent.\n\nDo you get recognised a lot?\n\nYes. I was doing a Stage Golfing Society day down in Bedfordshire the other day. As I walked into the bar, I could see this woman hopping from foot to foot. She asked, âCan I get a picture with you? I love the show. I'm from America, and it's huge out there.â Iâve also had young people from Australia coming up to me and saying, âYou know, you wouldn't be able to walk down the street in Australia. Itâs primetime on a Saturday night out there.â Thatâs what I love about Father Brown â the fact that we can give joy to people all over the world, and it can be dubbed into 101 different languages. I've seen it in Italian and German, and you just go, âThatâs incredible!â\n\nQ&A with Ruby-May Martinwood (Brenda Palmer)\n\nWhere do we find Brenda at the beginning of this series?\n\nShe has got a little bit less feisty. She is not quite as angry with everyone. She doesnât put a wall up and feel the need to defend herself all the time. She feels a lot safer. She is starting to let people in. Father Brown has softened her a lot. She feels safe and comfortable with him. Brenda is also quite important now, especially helping with solving all the mysteries and all the murders. Sheâs become a crucial part of that, so her self-esteem has gone up quite a bit because she knows she has a status now. She has got an interest in what she's going to do in the future, she has started to find her feet. She is even developing an interest in boys!\n\nDoes Brenda really feel at home living with Father Brown now?\n\nYes. He is almost like a father figure to Brenda. Itâs the same with Mrs Devine. They started off with a little bit of friction, but they definitely softened towards each other. It will be interesting to see how their dynamic progresses because they are a little family. Brenda looks after the house, while she is under the wing of Father Brown. And then goes out on little adventures with Mrs Devine. So itâs really cool.\n\nWhat can you tell us about one of Brendaâs big episodes in this series, which involves Dr McClurgy, played by Sylvester McCoy?\n\nItâs a gorgeous, very sweet, very endearing episode. It goes back and shows you a little bit of what Brenda's upbringing was like. She and Dr McClurgy have got a beautiful little bond. She was evacuated to stay with him during the war and he really looked after. It was probably one of the places where she actually felt like it was home. It was a pretty magical place. He was very much into storytelling, and he also made Brenda feel really confident. There are quite a few little moments where you can see that. He always has faith in Brenda. Thatâs quite a rare friend to have.\n\nWhat else happens in the episode?\n\nBrenda, Father Brown and Mrs Devine go and visit him. And actually it turns out that Dr McClurgy has become a little bit of a grumpy old man! Heâs involved in a property dispute. There are some people who are actually treating him quite badly. They are throwing bricks through his window to try and get him to move out, but he doesnât want to. But despite his grumpiness, Brenda still reconnects with him. He remembers what a lovely relationship they had and that makes him gentle and soft again. So she has a good effect on him.\n\nWhat is Brendaâs reaction to the developing relationship between Mrs Devine and Chief Inspector Sullivan?\n\nBrenda has never liked authority or the police. So Chief Inspector Sullivan is not her favourite person. But she can see that he makes Mrs Devine very happy. Still, Brenda has got her eye on him to make sure he stays in line!\n\nDo you think the Cotswolds are another character in Father Brown?\n\nDefinitely. The Cotswolds are gorgeous. The fact that the scenery is so aesthetically beautiful is one of the things that everyone loves so much about Father Brown. And we only film what is there. We donât use any effects. We are very lucky to have it on our doorstep. The old English countryside is so lovely.\n\nAs it enters its 11th season, why do you think Father Brown is more popular than ever?\n\nItâs family friendly, so everyone can watch it together. It's warm. It's funny. It's also got depth to it, but thereâs nothing remotely terrifying or scary about it. So it's something which you can watch for comfort.\n\nHow do you find it collaborating with Mark?\n\nMarkâs great. He's a brilliant actor. He works with such detail. And he really does carry the show. He takes on so many roles. When Mark is in, you feel at ease, you feel like you know what youâre doing. Also, he just makes the entire time we are on set so enjoyable. There will be times we all we all cry with laughter because of what heâs saying. You need that. When you're working for three, four months, that is what you need â people who make it an absolute blast.
