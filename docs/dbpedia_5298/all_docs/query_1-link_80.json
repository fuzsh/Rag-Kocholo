        "text": "Everyone watches the weather, it's just ingrained into our everyday lives. Naturally, the news networks put their hottest babes as weather ladies. Switching between channels there is Janice Dean of FOX, Bonnie Schneider of CNN and Jackie Meretsky of MSNBC. Who do you like to watch??\n\nYour typical hot blond, Janice Dean usually dresses pretty conservatively,\n\nBonnie Schneider doesn't have that pretty a face, but she's got the rack. She really looks hot when she wears a tight sweater,\n\nLast but not least, and my favorite is Jackie Meretsky. She also doesn't have a real pretty face, but her body is so tight. Jackie looks like she runs marathons. Very tall, long and lean, extremely hot.\n\nScreencaps courtesy of the Ultimate News Babes website.\n\nWhat do you get when you add Erica Hill + Christi Paul?? One smoking hot CNN headline news combination. They're both hot in their unique ways, but man when they are together, you can't not watch them. It doesn't hurt that they're both intelligent and have something worthy to say as well.\n\nErica + Christi together, what more could you ask for...\n\nChristi with that pretty face of hers,\n\nErica with that air of confidence, yep, you are one hot babe,\n\nScreencaps courtesy of Shadow at the Reporter Caps forum.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm a big Jill Dobson fan, something about her face that sometimes look a little distorted. But I have to say lately, Jill has been looking very hot lately on FOX News. Maybe it's a new hairdo, better makeup, whatever it is, it's working. And her smile is very pretty, one of the better ones for sure...\n\nFrom yesterday,\n\nFrom the day before,\n\nScreencaps courtesy of ARF at the Reporter Caps forum.\n\nVia the Inside Cable News blog, it seems that management at CNBC are just a little ticked off at the PageSix interview article that featured Erin Burnett. They think Erin comes off as a narcissistic gold-digger and think it damages her image.\n\nIn it, Erin reportedly says that the key to getting a piece of her [heart] (insert ass) is by \"giving her round-trip, business-class tickets to Australia and New Zealand, sending a yoga instructor and personal chef to her apartment, and treating her and her sisters to a long-weekend spa getaway, among other suggestions.\"\n\nI don't know what the heck is the big deal. So what, Erin's a girl and girl's like guys to chase them around buying shit for them and trying to win them over. It's called \"the game\" people, and if you can't ante up, then you can't play. Don't be a playa hater.\n\nI like these Hazards of Live TV clips that Inside Cable News does. This one shows the very hot Contessa Brewer needing some more lipstick in between interview segments. Except the camera cut back to Contessa unexpectedly and she was caught.... oopsy.\n\nI like the look on Contessa's face too, it's like she got caught shoplifting or something. It's just lipstick Contessa, it's not like they caught you with your pants down or something.\n\nOverall Hotness: 8/10\n\nFace: 8/10\n\nBody: 8/10\n\nLegs: 8/10\n\nPersonality: 8/10\n\nJenna Lee is one hot babe, no two ways about it. Ever since she premiered just a few months ago along with the launch of FOX's Business News in October, lotsa people have been tuning into watch all the new hotties, but Jenna is the queen of them all so far.\n\nJenna is like that really hot coed in college. You know, smart and nerdy during the day, but hot and sexy for all those wild frat parties. You can picture her as that hot girl dancing on top of the coffee table with 50 guys in the room rooting for her. She has a pretty face, nice full hair, and a wickedly tight body. Her legs are long, smooth and almost perfect.\n\nThe best part about Jenna Lee is that for the time being, it seems that she's single. I know, if you can believe that a hottie like Jenna is still on the market. I bet it must be hard for her though, to meet good guys. She probably attracts all the stalkers and pervs. I do hope that she finds a good guy...\n\nShe doesn't have an official page, but here is what her wikipedia page says:\n\nJenna Lee (born 1980 in San Francisco, California) is an anchor on the Fox Business Network. She is a graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a Bachelor of Arts in English and Global & International Studies. It is often reported in her biographies that she graduated from the University of California. However, there is no such school. The University of California includes many different schools and Jenna attended the University of California at Santa Barbara. She also holds a Master of Science degree in Journalism from Columbia University. Lee, along with Nicole Petallides were the the two first two anchors on the air when the network made its debut on October 15, 2007.\n\nBefore joining FBN, Lee worked for Forbes.com as a news anchor and reporter. During that time, she conducted interviews with various leaders in the business community, both on-set and in the field, and covered multiple beats, including investing, the leisure industry, alternative business practices and international news.\n\nPrior to her stint at Forbes.com, Lee worked for NY1, serving as a reporter and a segment producer for Fortune Business Report. While there, she also served as an associate producer for Inside City Hall, a live nightly politics program, and as a writer for their morning newscast.\n\nOn the October 23, 2007 taping of Fox Business' Happy Hour show, Lee stated that she was part Italian on her mother's side. Her mother's maiden name she mentioned was Delfino.\n\nThis is that Extra segment they did on Jenna, hopefully she has a valentine coming up for Feb, otherwise, I'll be her valentine...\n\nHere are a nice set of pictures of the beautiful Jenna Lee, and there will be plenty more in the next months, years I hope,\n\nErica is one my favorite news babes because she's so quirky and funny, but extremely hot. She's got a great anchor voice as well, so polished, she never says \"um\" or \"ah\".\n\nI wonder what Erica is thinking about here, either she's got some secret Clemens fetish we don't know about or she's craving something sweet,\n\nWho would you take, Christi Paul or Erica Hill, or both...\n\nScreencaps courtesy of the Ultimate News Babes website and mrg1808 at the Reporter Caps forum.\n\nI almost never watch Good Morning America on ABC. I like Diane Sawyer, but not enough to change my TV viewing habits (maybe 20 years ago when she was still young enough to be called a MILF). But someone posted this news babe whom I've never heard of or seen before. Her name is Bianna Golodryga. She's very exotic isn't she? You're looking at her wondering what/who she is, very sexy...\n\nScreencaps courtesy of Shadow at the Reporter Caps forum."
