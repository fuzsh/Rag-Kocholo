I have such strong memories of it, of watching it on Channel 4 one Sunday evening in the mid 90s, or of even passing an advertising hoarding with its poster on many times in 1992 as it was just up the road from me opposite the local Morrisons! I even have the excellent soundtrack.\n\nBilled as 'A comedy for the 90s' Peter's Friends was certainly that (though in all honesty it was probably usurped of that accolade just two years later with Four Weddings and a Funeral) and helped create or build on a template that would be seenâ€¦"
