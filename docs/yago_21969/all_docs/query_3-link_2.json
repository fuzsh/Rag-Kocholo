        "text": "In the midst of the Hundred Years War, the young King Henry V of England embarks on the conquest of France in 1415.\n\nA woman who has lost her memory is taken in by a Los Angeles orphanage, and a private eye is enlisted to track down her identity, but he soon finds that he might have a past life connection to her that endangers their lives.\n\nSix former college friends, with two new friends, gather for a New Year's Eve weekend reunion at a large English countryside manor after ten years to reminisce about the good times now long gone.\n\nIf film is basically a voyeuristric medium, then one of the questions that might be asked about \"Peter's Friends\" is: Would we like to be one of these friends, and attend such a reunion ourselves? I would.\n\nYoung lovers, and soon to wed, Hero and Claudio conspire to get verbal sparring partners and confirmed singles, Benedick and Beatrice, to wed as well.\n\nWhen the brilliant but unorthodox scientist Dr. Victor Frankenstein rejects the artificial man that he has created, the Creature escapes and later swears revenge.\n\nMary Shelley's Frankenstein is ambitious and visually striking, but the overwrought tone and lack of scares make for a tonally inconsistent experience.\n\nThis small-scale, putatively comic meditation on the anxieties and joys of the theatrical life says nothing fresh about the artistic process and manages to be coy and grating in doing so.\n\nHamlet, Prince of Denmark, returns home to find his father murdered and his mother remarrying the murderer, his uncle. Meanwhile, war is brewing.\n\nKenneth Branagh's sprawling, finely textured adaptation of Shakespeare's masterpiece lives up to its source material, using strong performances and a sharp cinematic focus to create a powerfully resonant film that wastes none of its 246 minutes.\n\nAn update of the classic Shakespeare story, director Kenneth Branagh shot the film like a classic 1930s musical. It tells the story of four best friends who swear off love.\n\nA daughter of the powerful Duke must show her courage and inventiveness to be with the man she loves.\n\nBranagh's fifth foray into celluloid Shakespeare brings us this rather stodgy version of the Bard's wise comedy of old Japan.\n\nDuring World War I, in an unnamed country, a soldier named Tamino is sent by the Queen of the Night to rescue her daughter Pamina from the clutches of the supposedly evil Sarastro. But all is not as it seems.\n\nThe results are often fascinating (I love the duet of the Armed Men, sung by a chorus of faces animated out of a wall of sandbags), sometimes ludicrous and never boring.\n\nSleuth is so obvious and coarse, rather than suspenseful and action-packed, that it does nothing to improve on the original version\n\nThe powerful but arrogant god Thor is cast out of Asgard to live amongst humans in Midgard (Earth), where he soon becomes one of their finest defenders.\n\nAs Macbeth rides home from battle, three witches prophecise that he will soon rise in power to become King of Scotland. Aided by his wife, the pair will stop at nothing to seal their fate.\n\nJack Ryan, as a young covert C.I.A. analyst, uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U.S. economy with a terrorist attack.\n\nWhen her father unexpectedly dies, young Ella finds herself at the mercy of her cruel stepmother and her scheming stepsisters. Never one to give up hope, Ella's fortunes begin to change after meeting a dashing stranger.\n\nWhen a murder occurs on the train on which he's travelling, celebrated detective Hercule Poirot is recruited to solve the case."
