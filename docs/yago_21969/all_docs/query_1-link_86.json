We stay together five years I get a free hair transplant and she gets a new set of breasts.\n\nPeter:\n\nWhat, so she'll have four?\n\nAndrew:\n\nYes, but her agent gets one.\n\nPeter:\n\nAnd you know, when you think about it, that's exactly what happens to us when we're born. We're dropped down a random chimney and we have to get on with the strangers we find there. Typical Chesterton there to describe a chimney as a kind of uterus.\n\nSarah:\n\nYou're probably going to be stuck with that Joan Collins impersonator for the rest of your life.\n\nAndrew:\n\nYou're talking about the woman I almost love.\n\nSarah:\n\nI've never seen anyone wear more makeup! How does she take it off? With a chiesel?"
