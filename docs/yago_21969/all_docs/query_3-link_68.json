        "text": "The unsettling supernatural thriller opened in cinemas September 15 2023\n\nNow available to watch on Hulu [US], Disney+ [UK] and on Prime Video, iTunes and Microsoft Video\n\nInspired by the novel Hallowe’en Party, and directed by and starring Oscar® winner Kenneth Branagh as famed detective Hercule Poirot. A Haunting in Venice is set in eerie, post-World War II Venice on All Hallows’ Eve and is a terrifying mystery featuring the return of the celebrated sleuth, Hercule Poirot. Now retired and living in self-imposed exile in the world’s most glamorous city, Poirot reluctantly attends a séance at a decaying, haunted palazzo. When one of the guests is murdered, the detective is thrust into a sinister world of shadows and secrets.\n\nAbout the Film\n\nReuniting the team of filmmakers behind 2017’s Murder on the Orient Express and 2022’s Death on the Nile, the film is directed by Kenneth Branagh with a screenplay by Oscar® nominee Michael Green (Logan) based upon Agatha Christie’s novel Hallowe’en Party. A brilliant acting ensemble portrays a cast of unforgettable characters, including Kenneth Branagh, Kyle Allen (Rosaline), Camille Cottin (Call My Agent), Jamie Dornan (Belfast), Tina Fey (30 Rock), Jude Hill (Belfast), Ali Khan (6 Underground), Emma Laird (Mayor of Kingstown), Kelly Reilly (Yellowstone), Riccardo Scamarcio (Caravaggio’s Shadow), and recent Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh (Everything Everywhere All at Once). The producers are Kenneth Branagh, Judy Hofflund, Ridley Scott, and Simon Kinberg, with Louise Killin, James Prichard, and Mark Gordon serving as executive producers.\n\nHildur Guønadøttir, the acclaimed composer from Iceland who won an Oscar, Golden Globe® and BAFTA for Joker and an Emmy® and GRAMMY® for Chernobyl, and who most recently scored Tár and Women Talking, composed the score.\n\nAn Icelandic artist who now resides in Berlin, Hildur Gudnadóttir has been manifesting herself at the forefront of experimental pop and contemporary music. In her solo works, she draws out a broad spectrum of sounds from her instrumentation, ranging from intimate simplicity to huge soundscapes. She began playing cello as a child, entered the Reykjavík Music Academy and then moved on to musical studies/composition and new media at the Iceland Academy of the Arts and Universität der Künste Berlin. She has released four critically acclaimed solo albums and has composed music for theatre, dance performances and films. The Icelandic Symphony Orchestra, Icelandic National Theatre, Tate Modern, The British Film Institute, The Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm and Gothenburg National Theatre are amongst the institutions that have commissioned new works from her."
