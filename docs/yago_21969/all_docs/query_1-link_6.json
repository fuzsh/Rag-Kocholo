        "text": "Positive Role Models\n\nsome\n\nThe friendship group can be judgmental of each other and make cruel jokes at times, but are ultimately caring and supportive. Peter is friendly and generous, but has refused to settle down or take on much responsibility since his youth. Roger and Mary struggle to communicate following the loss of their son, but gradually learn to let each other, and their friends, in. Maggie is smart but quite straight-laced, though begins to let loose and focus on her own happiness. Sarah is portrayed as bouncing from relationship to relationship and not taking the emotions of others seriously, though looks inward at her motives after her most recent breakup. Andrew is unhappy in his relationship and can be arrogant and cutting toward his wife and others, but also admits his faults toward the end of the film.\n\nDiverse Representations\n\nsome\n\nCast is majority White, with one Black character among the main group of friends. Stereotypical portrayal of American actress being rude and obsessed with her looks. She mentions having bulimia in the past and binge eats at night, which the film plays for laughs. One main character is bisexual and refers to himself as a \"bit of a whoopsie.\" His role is fully rounded and not majorly stereotyped, and other characters are accepting when he comes out. He is the only LGBTQ+ representation in the movie and is diagnosed with HIV, though he is shown to be living a healthy life and taking a new drug that offers hope. However some casual jokes are made about bisexuality, such as another character saying her male ex was bisexual and left her for another woman, which is the \"ultimate put down.\"\n\nDid we miss something on diversity? Suggest an update.\n\nParents need to know that Peter's Friends is a comedy-drama about six college friends who reunite at Peter's (Stephen Fry) countryside manor to celebrate New Year's Eve. It has plenty of warmth and humor, as well some mature themes such as suicide, the loss of a child, HIV, alcoholism, and infidelity. Sex is portrayed on-screen, and male nudity is shown from behind. Frequent strong language includes \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and \"bitch,\" and characters smoke and drink, sometimes to the point of intoxication. A character comes out to their friends as bisexual, which is met with a supportive response, though jokes are made at the expense of bisexuals in other parts of the film. Overall the movie is entertaining and heartfelt, and will appeal to older teens and adults who enjoy an ensemble drama performed by acting greats, including Emma Thompson, Hugh Laurie, and Kenneth Branagh.
