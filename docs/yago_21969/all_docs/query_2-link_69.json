        "text": "The great Kenneth Branagh is celebrating his birthday today (December 10), so we’re marking the occasion by making him our British Icon of the Week. As he gathers Oscar buzz for his latest movie Belfast – a poignant and heartfelt tribute to the city he grew up in – here’s a reminder of 10 ways in which he has really excelled over the years.\n\n1. He has Oscar nominations for acting, writing, and directing.\n\nBranagh's five Oscar nominations are: Best Actor and Best Director for 1989's Henry V; Best Live Action Short Film for 1992's Swan Song; Best Adapted Screenplay for 1996's Hamlet; and Best Supporting Actor for 2011's My Week with Marilyn. Surprisingly, Branagh has never actually won one, but maybe Belfast will break his nomination-only streak?\n\n2. He most definitely has the range.\n\nWho else has directed Shakespeare films, Agatha Christie adaptations like 2017's smash hit Murder on the Orient Express, and a huge Marvel superhero movie like 2011's Thor? He also has a dash of Disney on his résumé after directing 2015's Cinderella and 2020's Artemis Fowl.3. He gave a stirring performance at the London 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nAs part of director Danny Boyle's epic opening ceremony, Branagh portrayed innovative 19th century engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It's a powerful moment that might just put a lump in your throat.4. He has a lovely personal and professional relationship with Dame Judi Dench.\n\nBy now, the two actors have worked together at least a dozen times. During their 2017 appearance on The Graham Norton Show, Branagh recalled the time that Dench forgot to put on an important part of her stage costume. It's a funny and slightly naughty story told by Branagh with palpable affection.5. In 2011, he was made \"Sir Kenneth Branagh\" by Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nBranagh received his knighthood for services to drama and the community in Northern Ireland. You can watch footage of Branagh receiving his honor from Queen Elizabeth II here.\n\n6. He made a terrific TV detective.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2016, Branagh starred in the BBC’s highly acclaimed series Wallander, which was adapted from Henning Mankell's popular crime novels. He gave a brilliantly layered performance as Kurt Wallander, a deeply committed police inspector who has tremendous empathy for his victims, but struggles to find quite as much meaning in his personal life. In 2009, Branagh deservedly picked up BAFTA’s Best Actor award for his performance.7. He's president of one of the U.K.'s most prestigious drama schools.\n\nBranagh has been president of RADA, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, since 2014, when he succeeded the late Richard Attenborough. You can watch him chatting all things acting with fellow RADA alum Ralph Fiennes in this interesting “in conversation” video.8. He's immensely proud of his Northern Irish roots.\n\nWhen he was awarded the freedom of the city of Belfast in 2017, Branagh said the Northern Irish capital has \"always given me more than I could ever repay.\"\n\n\"It gave me a profound sense of family, a magnificent landscape to play in, and a Belfast sense of humor that is a constant boisterous reminder to never take yourself too seriously,\" Branagh added, according to the Belfast Telegraph. \"I'm proud to say that you can take the boy out of Belfast, but you can't take Belfast out of the boy.\"\n\n9. He portrayed another acting great: Sir Laurence Olivier\n\nBranagh played the legendary thesp in My Week with Marilyn, a lovely biographical movie about Marilyn Monroe's 1957 trip to England to make The Prince and the Showgirl, which was directed by co-starred Olivier. It's hard to imagine anyone but Branagh pulling off this tricky role quite so well; he and Michelle Williams bounce off one another brilliantly.10. And finally, he’s a very accomplished narrator.\n\nWho can forget Branagh’s sterling work on the BBC's landmark 1999 nature documentary series Walking with Dinosaurs?Have we forgot to mention one of your favorite Kenneth Branagh moments?"
