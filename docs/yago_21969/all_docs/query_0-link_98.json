        "text": "\"Peter's Friends,\" a cheerfully derivative comedy about a group of old friends enjoying a house-party reunion, borrows so blatantly from \"The Big Chill\" that it takes a while to realize this film has some life of its own. Once again, the principals are brought together to reconsider the courses of their lives. Once again, these decisions are made to the tune of an ebullient rock soundtrack. Once again, thoughts of mortality lend substance to what otherwise would look like lighthearted fun.\n\nThe setting this time is a grand English manor house, which Peter (Stephen Fry) has recently inherited in one of the film's more conspicuous coming-of-age touches. A decade earlier, the principals were college chums joining forces to stage a giddy New Year's Eve musical revue. But they are now at a more serious stage in their lives.\n\nMaggie (Emma Thompson) is desperately lonely, and determined to do something about it. Roger and Mary (Hugh Laurie and Imelda Staunton) are recovering from the loss of a child. Sarah (Alphonsia Emmanuel) has embarked on one too many ill-considered affairs, this one with Brian (Tony Slattery), a married actor. Brian's biggest dramatic accomplishment is feigning interest in what others have to say.\n\nKenneth Branagh, who produced and directed the film, also appears as Andrew, who once aspired to be a serious playwright and is now best known as the creator of an American sitcom. Appearing as Carol, his brassy American wife, is Rita Rudner, who wrote the screenplay with her husband, Martin Bergman, and all but steals the film. \"Did you ever see 'Upstairs, Downstairs?' \" Carol worriedly asks Peter's cook, who has somehow failed to jump at her orders the way they do back in Hollywood.\n\nArriving with a load of exercise equipment and a Rodeo Drive wardrobe that is a comedy act all by itself, Ms. Rudner's Carol makes no bones about not fitting in with her husband's English friends. Looking around the manor, she denies that a house of hers in Bel Air was vulgar, saying, \"It was just like this, only everything was brand new.\" Inspecting her room, she complains to Peter about the lack of a television set, only to learn there are none anywhere in the house. \"That's all right, I'll read,\" she says bravely. \"Does anyone have a book?\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
