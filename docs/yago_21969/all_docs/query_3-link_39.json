        "text": "What's the story on him? He was supposed to be a second Olivier after \"Henry V\" came out, but the reception of most of his Shakespeare movies has been tepid.\n\nThere was talk of him being gay when he starred his protegÃ© Tom Hiddletson as Loki in the first \"Thor\" movie, but though the gossip continues to swirl around Hiddleston, I hear little about Branagh. I always thought he was incredibly attractive--he's handsome in a very real way.\n\nWell, the story is, when he and what's her name did that noirish murder movie that was pure corn? He had sex. With men! I mean, SO many of them. Half the phone book in West Hollywood sized numbers.\n\nRemember phonebooks?\n\nSo much wasted paper. Do you think Kenneth and Emma--OMG! THAT'S her name! And she did a movie called \"Emma,\" right? Won an Oscar? Writing really weird screenplays, being in Harry Potter?\n\nO.K. O.K., so who was Emma fucking? Or is it whom?\n\nYou know, this is really an amazing mojito, darlings! What did you crush into it?\n\nAnd I congratulate you on your very \"MARY!\" routine in your reply, r6. It was very workmanlike.\n\nYou know, everyone wants to be a star these days, but some of us have the sense to be bit players. Steadier work that way.\n\nYou wouldn't happen to know what liking one's eggs on the Jersey side means?\n\nThe next time you head out to brunch I highly recommend them.\n\nI prefer my Jersey eggs perfectly poached. Sometimes scrambled if they're soft scrambled. Or in a French omelette--also soft.\n\nSoft is the key.\n\n\"Heâ€™s not gay, just a boring slightly geeky straight bloke. \"\n\nYou have a photographed head shot of him framed in your home, don't you? A black and white one that you put in that thrift shop frame that you covered in beads. The hot glue burns were a bitch but it came out looking so good. Good enough for Kenneth anyway.\n\nThat whore! That filthy whore! You gave him the most memorable night of his life and it was your golden jewel plucking night to boot!\n\nThat heel! That fucking heel! Well, you showed him.\n\nYou still haven't washed it since he touched it last.\n\nOf course I was talking about your autographed Harry Potter Gilderoy Lockhart edition t-shirt. If you washed it the autograph might come off.\n\nBut, you know, you good occasionally blast it with Febreeze every once in while and that autograph would be fine. I have that Harry Potter cosplay outfit? A fortune to dry clean! But put some cheap vodka and steam distilled water in a spray bottle and you can spritz it right on the hanger. Let it dry. You're all set.\n\nI mean, I do it right after you wear it because you don't want a build up of odors. I might also rub a little oxyclean paste with an old tooth brush. Some of those stains kind or ruin the overall effect you may be going for.\n\nApparently when Olivier died, Prince Charles couldn't attend the funeral in St. Paul's Cathedral and wanted to send Branagh as his representative. The Olivier family were horrified--\"Henry V\" had just come out and there was all this talk about Branagh being the new Olivier in the press, so if Branagh had come he would have stolen all the attention away from Olivier--and what' was even more upsetting, as the prince's representative, he would have been the last seated in the Cathedral and they all would have remained standing until he sat down. They protested so strenuously the prince had to back off and send Richard Attenborough instead.\n\nIt was a classic tone-deaf move by Prince Charles--he had decided Branagh was the next Olivier, so he had thought the gesture would be cute. His mother would have been very careful to ask around first and never would have made the mistake. This is the sort of thing for why Brits are so deeply distrustful of Charles--he's very arrogant (or at least he was in his 30s and 40s--I think he's learned better by now).\n\nKB is straight? ðŸ˜‚\n\nThis man has too many gay/bi/casting-couch rumours to count and don't forget about him \"mentoring\" Tom Hiddleston.\n\nA few examples:\n\nLiterally every film credit Tom Hiddleston had prior/including the first Thor movie was linked to Kenneth Branagh in some way and we all know that Branagh didn't take interest in back then 19 year old Hiddleston because of his talent. He got him into RADA, into his first major play, onto TV and into his first really big film role.\n\nQuote from an alleged RADA poster: Ken has been Tom's \"mentor\" for close to a decade now. Everything Tom is is because of Ken's love.\n\nBranagh, Kenneth. \"Early in his career was ambitio-sexual--would sleep with anyone to advance his career.\" Cute but conceited. Possibly yet another Great Gay British Actor. Couldn't handle his then-wife's success and pouted, causing Emma Thompson to divorce him. Linked with Helena Bonham Carter and Alicia Silverstone.\"\n\nRemember when Richard Madden who played prince charming in Branagh's version of Cinderella had to try on diffrent jock-straps in front of Branagh and the costume designer in order to look which one would make his package look \"family friendly\"?\n\nWhen Alexander Skarsgard was originally cast as Thor and dropped last minute under mysterious circumstances and Chris Hemsworth later refused to ever work with Branagh again ( after having to do the casting couch)?\n\nom Hiddleston for every role Kenneth Branagh has ever cast him in.\n\nAlso heard that Chris Hemsworth for Thor and the guy who played the prince in the Cinderella movie Branagh directed.\n\nAnd casting-couch-Ken fucked around for his roles way back in the day too.\n\nOne interesting thing about the Chris Hemsworth/Kenneth Branagh casting couch rumor after the the first Thor move was filmed, became a hit and Hemsworth became famous, Hemsworth reportedly refused to work with Branagh again for the sequel.\n\nKen's affair with Keanu being the real reason for the end of his marriage to Emma not HBC.\n\nKen allegedly sharing a flat with his boyfriend in London around 2004?\n\nYou just made all that up on the spot, r20. And I'd bet good money you're the same deranged Hiddles/Marvel troll that's been busted for sockpuppeting and starting deranged threads on various gossip sites all over the place lately.\n\n\"Literally every film credit Tom Hiddleston had prior/including the first Thor movie was linked to Kenneth Branagh in some way and we all know that Branagh didn't take interest in back then 19 year old Hiddleston because of his talent. He got him into RADA, into his first major play, onto TV and into his first really big film role.\"\n\nCompletely fake. Tom Hiddleston was literally an Olivier Award winner when he first met Kenneth Branagh. And he was in his late twenties at the time, not 19.\n\nTom didn't even start acting till he was in his early twenties (he graduated from Cambridge before he enrolled in drama school, and would have been probably 24 or 25 when he graduated from RADA) so I don't know why you're claiming he was a teenager.\n\nKen met Tom Hiddleston for the first time in 2008 (when he was 27 years old), when he was starring in Othello at the Donmar Warehouse. This was three years after he graduated from RADA, and he'd already starred in two movies (both directed by a woman), a few TV series, and several major stage productions, one of which as mentioned he won an Olivier for.\n\nThere's no question that Ken's mentorship helped his career but he was nearly 30 and a reasonably successful actor before they even met. Making up lies about him being an inexperienced teenager is just plain weird.\n\nGlad to see a few good things said about Olivier on this thread. Not a nice person. At all. But DL likes to trash him as an actor unnecessarily.\n\nBut still in films like Carrie, Henry V and Richard III he is a talent of such giant proportions there is no one comparable today. People still talk of his Macbeth and Coriolanus. Well the few still alive who saw him on stage.\n\nAnd yes there could be quite a bit of the ham fat but could anyone have ever played a more handsome tormented Heathcliff? We are so bereft of great talents today.\n\nR11, etc., it's nice to hear your casual tidbits. I was just thinking about Emma today and her movie with Jeff Goldblum, \"The Tall Guy.\" I'd like to see that again.\n\nI didn't realize that she had divorced KB; I thought they split because of his affair. I wasted time feeling sorry for her, I guess. She's ended up in what appears to be happy, long marriage with Greg Wise, so, good for her! I didn't find him that attractive in \"Sense and Sensibility,\" but he's aging wonderfully and is looking incredible these days.\n\nAnything else you'd like to tell us would not go amiss. Can you tell us who else you've worked with whose names we would probably know?"
