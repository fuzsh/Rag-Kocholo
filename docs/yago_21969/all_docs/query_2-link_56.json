        "text": "As UK audiences will be able to see Belfast in cinemas, we're taking a look behind the scenes at the people and places that make up the movie.\n\nThe semi-autobiographical film from Kenneth Branagh centres around nine-year-old Buddy as he navigates life in the city at the beginning of The Troubles in 1969.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Kenneth Branagh, the writer and director of Belfast :\n\nWho is Kenneth Branagh?\n\nKenneth Branagh is a 61-year-old actor, writer, and director, who has been nominated for five Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards, and has won three BAFTAs and two Emmy Awards throughout his career.\n\nHe lived in the Tiger's Bay area of North Belfast until he was nine-years-old, when his family moved to England to escape the violence of The Troubles in 1969.\n\nWhat is his background in acting?\n\nAfter disappointing A-Level results, a young Kenneth Branagh went on to train at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.\n\nThe actor achieved early success in Northern Ireland for his role as Billy, the title character in the BBC's Play for Today trilogy known as the Billy Plays from 1982-1984.\n\nHe had early success as a theatre actor when he graduated from RADA, and became well-known for his Shakespeare performances.\n\nWhat are some of his biggest roles?\n\nKenneth Branagh is best-known for directing and starring in several adaptions of Shakespeare plays, including Henry V , Much Ado About Nothing, Othello, Hamlet, Love's Labour's Lost , and As You Like It.\n\nHe also starred as Hercule Poirot in his directed adaption of Murder on the Orient Express, and was well-known for his role as Gilderoy Lockhart in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\n\nBranagh also played the role of a Royal Navy Commander in Dunkirk , and was cast as the villain in Tenet , a role he received critical acclaim for.\n\nWhat has the actor said about the film Belfast?\n\nAs the film centres around his own personal experience growing up in North Belfast at the onset of The Troubles, Kenneth Branagh has said making the film Belfast was a \"very personal\" experience for him.\n\nSpeaking virtually to film students at the QFT in 2020 about the movie, he said: “It’s a very personal film, set partly in Belfast and partly elsewhere.\n\n“My experience of Belfast when I was growing up was to be part of a larger extended family, one that lived nearby each other, in a world in terms of television that had three channels in black and white. We listened to radio extensively, listened to records extensively and we went to see films extensively and when we weren’t doing that, we visited each other.\n\n\"I hope that there is humour and I hope that it’s emotional. It’s a look at a people and a place in tumult through the eyes of a nine-year old movie-mad kid.\""
