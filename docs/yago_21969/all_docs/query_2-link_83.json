        "text": "Profile\n\nSir Kenneth Branagh is an actor, director and screen-writer. He was born in Belfast, Ireland before relocating to Reading at the age of 9. He trained at RADA and in 1987 co-founded the Renaissance Theatre Company, going on to receive acclaim for his work both acting and directing Shakespeare. His first film appearance was in Henry V, which he also directed and for which he won a BAFTA.\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nKenneth is a huge fan of words and writing. He described himself as a ‘words man’ and he is ‘drawn to words’.\n\nHe has been nominated for five Academy Awards, five Golden Globes, and has won an Emmy (Best Lead Actor: Conspiracy, 2001) and three BAFTAs (Best Director: Henry V 1989; Best Actor: Wallander, 2008; Best TV Drama Series: Wallander, 2008).\n\nHe is only one of eight actors to have been Oscar nominated for acting, writing and directing. Others include Woody Allen, Orson Welles and George Clooney."
