        "text": "Mobb Deep‘s “Shook Ones, Pt. II” beat has been crowned as the greatest in the history of Hip-Hop.\n\nAs part of its Hip-Hop’s Greatest 50 Beats list, Rock The Bells put together a panel of cultural historians to parse out which rap instrumental is the best of them all. Panelists DJ Epps, Cool (of Cool & Dre), DJ Scratch, and Torae ultimately settled on “Shook Ones, Pt. II” as the top pick.\n\nThe backing track for the classic hit beat out contenders like first runner-up “Still D.R.E.” by Dr. Dre, as well as A Tribe Called Quest’s “Electric Relaxation,” Craig Mack’s “Flava In Ya Ear,” and Nas’ “NY State of Mind.”\n\nAfter catching wind of his victory, Mobb Deep member Havoc, who produced “Shook Ones, Pt. II,” expressed his gratitude for being acknowledged for creating the genre’s definitive soundscape. “I just want to say how honored I am to have ‘Shook Ones, Pt. II’ by Mobb Deep produced by myself, voted number one Hip-Hop beat of all time,” he said, according to HipHopDX.\n\n“I remember being in the projects in Queensbridge, me and Prodigy just being there trying to make something for the world to hear our voice. And here we are this many years later, being saluted and held as the number one beat and Hip-Hop greatest of all time.”\n\nHe continued, “But I just want to say thank you to all the Hip-Hop fans, rest in peace to my brother Prodigy. He would be just as excited — as excited as I am, and I just want to thank all y’all fans, man. Salute.”\n\nFour of the beats in the top five were released within a three-year span, as “Electric Relaxation” dropped in 1993, “NY State of Mind” and “Flava In Ya Ear” arrived in 1994, and “Shook Ones, Pt. II” being unleashed in 1995. “Still D.R.E.” is the newest record in the Top 5, as it was released in 1999."
