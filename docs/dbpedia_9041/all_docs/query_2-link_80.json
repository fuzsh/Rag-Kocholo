        "text": "Netflix have released a new documentary about the making of ‘We Are the World’, titled The Greatest Night in Pop.\n\nThe feature length film, which is directed by Bao Nguyen, explores the creation of the track and the process of getting it recorded in 1985 by a roster of the most famous and successful musical artists of the era.\n\n‘We Are the World’ was a charity single, released under the name USA For Africa. It was largely inspired by the runaway success of Band Aid’s ‘Do They Know It’s Christmas’ the previous year, and it became one of the biggest-selling singles of all time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe song received four Grammy Awards and raised more than $80 million, which translates to over $200 million in today’s money, for humanitarian aid in Africa and the United States.\n\nThe Greatest Night in Pop is streaming on Netflix now, having received its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19.\n\nWho is interviewed in The Greatest Night in Pop?\n\nLionel Richie, who co-wrote ‘We Are the World’ with Michael Jackson, is one of the producers of the film and is interviewed extensively.\n\nRecommended\n\nAlso speaking on screen in the documentary are artists including Bruce Springsteen, Dionne Warwick, Smokey Robinson, Cyndi Lauper, Huey Lewis and Kenny Loggins.\n\nMany of the key figures involved in the development of the single are no longer alive, including Harry Belafonte, who had the original idea to attempt an American version of Band Aid, and Ken Kragen, a fundraiser who ended up helming the project.\n\nWho appeared on ‘We Are the World’?\n\nFans of pop music can revel in the extensive behind-the-scenes footage that the documentary shows, including from Kenny Rogers’ Lion Share Recording Studio, which was used to lay down the track in January 1985.\n\nThe record was produced by Quincy Jones, alongside Michael Omartian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe soloists on the song were, in order of appearance:\n\nLionel Richie\n\nStevie Wonder\n\nPaul Simon\n\nKenny Rogers\n\nJames Ingram\n\nTina Turner\n\nBilly Joel\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nDiana Ross\n\nDionne Warwick\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nAl Jarreau\n\nBruce Springsteen\n\nKenny Loggins\n\nSteve Perry\n\nDaryl Hall\n\nHuey Lewis\n\nCyndi Lauper\n\nKim Carnes\n\nBob Dylan\n\nRay Charles"
