        "text": "In 1987 I ripped a friend's vinyl titled 'The Jazz Singer' by Al Jarreu. The record stated the date 1965, but I don't remember whether this was the date of the record itself or of the recording. The tracklist is\n\n1. My Favorite Things\n\n2. Stockholm Sweetnin'\n\n3. Sleeping Bee\n\n4. The Masqueade Is Over\n\n5. Sophisticated Lady\n\n6. Joey\n\n7. Come rain or shine\n\n8. The one note samba\n\nI always liked that record, but when looking for a CD I always found what seemed pirate editions. Finally yesterday I picked a used CD titled 'The Masquerade is over', from the label 'Flash' Produced by Masters Records, Roermond/Holland, Manufactured by PILZ Compact Disc, Kranzberg/Munich. It contains these 8 tracks in the same order plus 8 more. All of them are clearly vinyl rips... It still sounds better than my old cassette.\n\nMy question is, is there any legit edition of this material, coming from the real masters? Thank you!\n\nYou may like to PM a Gort to change the thread title to something more specific. I'm sure there are many Al Jarreau fans who would like to chime in.\n\nIt appears Al did a slew of early recordings prior to his signing with Reprise/Warner Brothers in the mid-70s.\n\nThe album to which you refer above was (first?) released in 1981 by Bainbridge and made in the USA.\n\nMusicstack has some LP copies.\n\nI would like some more information on where these tracks were obtained though. Perhaps even who owns the rights to these today.\n\nIIRC the vinyl I ripped from had none of those covers. As I said before the title was different. It could be a later pirate copy, or less likely an earlier incarnation, but I cannot say. I wish I could contact again that friend and ask him whether he still owns that record. Looking now at the credits would be very useful.\n\nBTW the pirate cd (a vinyl rip, with cracks and pops and all) is also different."
