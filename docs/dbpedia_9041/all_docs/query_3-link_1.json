        "text": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jarreau\n\nAlwin Lopez \"Al\" Jarreau (March 12, 1940 – February 12, 2017) was an American jazz singer. He won seven Grammy Awards and was nominated for over a dozen more. He is perhaps best known for his 1981 album Breakin' Away, for having sung the theme song of the late-1980s television series Moonlighting, and as a performer in the 1985 charity song \"We Are the World\".\n\nBackground\n\nJarreau was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the fifth of six children. His website refers to Reservoir Avenue, the name of the street where he lived. His father was a Seventh-day Adventist Church minister and singer, and his mother was a church pianist. He and his family sang together in church concerts and in benefits, and he and his mother performed at PTA meetings.\n\nHe was student council president and Badger Boys State delegate for Lincoln High School. At Boys State, he was elected governor. He went on to attend Ripon College, where he also sang with a group called the Indigos. Jarreau graduated in 1962 with a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology. He went on to earn a master's degree in vocational rehabilitation from the University of Iowa, worked as a rehabilitation counselor in San Francisco, and moonlighted with a jazz trio headed by George Duke.\n\nIn 1967, he joined forces with acoustic guitarist Julio Martinez. The duo became the star attraction at a small Sausalito night club called Gatsby's. This success contributed to Jarreau's decision to make professional singing his life and full-time career.\n\nGoing full-time\n\nIn 1968, Jarreau made jazz his primary occupation. In 1969, Jarreau and Martinez headed south, where Jarreau appeared at such Los Angeles hot spots as Dino's, The Troubadour, and Bitter End West. Television exposure came from Johnny Carson, Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin, Dinah Shore, and David Frost. He expanded his nightclub appearances performing at The Improv between the acts of such rising-star comics as Bette Midler, Jimmie Walker, and John Belushi. During this period, he became involved with the United Church of Religious Science and the Church of Scientology, but he later dissociated from Scientology. Also, roughly at the same time, he began writing his own lyrics, finding that his Christian spirituality began to influence his work.\n\nIn 1975, Jarreau was working with pianist Tom Canning when he was spotted by Warner Bros. Records. On Valentine's Day 1976 he sang on the 13th episode of NBC's new Saturday Night Live hosted, that week by Peter Boyle. Soon thereafter he released his critically acclaimed debut album, We Got By, which catapulted him to international fame and garnered him a German Grammy Award. A second German Grammy would follow with the release of his second album, Glow.\n\nIn 1978, Al won his first U.S Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album for his album, Look To The Rainbow.\n\nOne of Jarreau's most commercially successful albums is Breakin' Away (1981), which includes the hit song \"We're in This Love Together\". He won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for Breakin' Away. In 1984, his single \"After All\" reached 69 on the US Hot 100 chart and number 26 on the R&B chart. It was especially popular in the Philippines. His last big hit was the Grammy-nominated theme to the 1980s American television show Moonlighting, for which he wrote the lyrics. Among other things, he was well known for his extensive use of scat singing, and vocal percussion. He was also a featured vocalist on USA for Africa's \"We Are the World\" in which he sang the line, \"...and so we all must lend a helping hand.\" Another charitable media event, HBO's Comic Relief, featured Al in a duet with Natalie Cole singing the song \"Mr. President\", written by Joe Sterling, Mike Loveless and Ray Reach.\n\nJarreau took an extended break from recording in the 1990s. As he explained in an interview with Jazz Review: \"I was still touring, in fact, I toured more than I ever had in the past, so I kept in touch with my audience. I got my symphony program under way, which included my music and that of other people too, and I performed on the Broadway production of Grease. I was busier than ever! For the most part, I was doing what I have always done … perform live. I was shopping for a record deal and was letting people know that there is a new album coming. I was just waiting for the right label (Verve), but I toured more than ever.\"\n\nIn 2003, Jarreau and conductor Larry Baird collaborated on symphony shows around the United States, with Baird arranging additional orchestral material for Jarreau's shows.\n\nJarreau toured and performed with Joe Sample, Chick Corea, Kathleen Battle, Miles Davis, David Sanborn, Rick Braun, and George Benson. He also performed the role of the Teen Angel in a 1996 Broadway production of Grease. On March 6, 2001, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 7083 Hollywood Boulevard on the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and La Brea Avenue.\n\nIn 2006, Jarreau appeared in a duet with American Idol finalist Paris Bennett during the Season 5 finale and on Celebrity Duets singing with actor Cheech Marin.\n\nIn 2010, Jarreau was a guest on the new Eumir Deodato album, with the song \"Double Face\" written by Nicolosi/Deodato/Al Jarreau. The song was produced by the Italian company Nicolosi Productions.\n\nOn February 16, 2012, he was invited to the famous Italian Festival di Sanremo to sing with the Italian group Matia Bazar.\n\nOn February 8, 2017, after being hospitalized for exhaustion, Jarreau cancelled his remaining 2017 tour dates and retired from touring.\n\nPersonal life\n\nJarreau was married twice. His first marriage, to Phyllis Hall, lasted from 1964 to 1968. His second wife was model Susan Elaine Player, whom he married in 1977. Jarreau and Player had one son together, Ryan.\n\nIt was reported on July 23, 2010 that Jarreau was critically ill at a hospital in France, while in the area to perform a concert at nearby Barcelonnette, and was being treated for respiratory problems and cardiac arrhythmias. He was taken to the intensive-care unit at Gap late on July 22, 2010. Jarreau was conscious, in a stable condition and in the cardiology unit of La Timone hospital in Marseille, the Marseille Hospital Authority said. He was expected to remain there for about a week for tests. In June 2012, Jarreau was diagnosed with pneumonia, which caused him to cancel several concerts in France. Jarreau made a full recovery and continued to tour extensively until February 2017.\n\nIn 2009 children's author Carmen Rubin published the story Ashti Meets Birdman Al, inspired by Jarreau's music. He wrote the foreword for the book and read from it across the world. Al and Carmen worked together to promote literacy and the importance of keeping music alive in children.\n\nDeath\n\nAfter having been hospitalized for exhaustion in Los Angeles, Al Jarreau, died on February 12, 2017 at the age of 76."
