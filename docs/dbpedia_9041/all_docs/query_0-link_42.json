Al brought beauty to life through his music while providing inspiration and hope to young people around the world. He believed strongly in keeping music and arts opportunities alive for children everywhere. While we are deeply saddened of Al’s passing, we are incredibly honored that Al believed so much in our cause to choose our foundation as a beneficiary of gifts in his name.\n\nAl Jarreau’s unique vocal style is one of the world’s most precious treasures. His innovative musical expressions have made him one of the most exciting and critically-acclaimed performers of our time with seven Grammy® Awards, scores of international music awards and popular accolades worldwide.\n\nMilwaukee-born and raised, Al Jarreau was internationally acclaimed for his ability to sing many styles, his scat singing and his talent of taking on the character of guitar and percussion, all with his versatile and soulful voice. Jarreau topped the music sales charts with more than 20 albums. He was the only vocalist in history to have Grammy Awards in the 3 categories of jazz, pop, and R&B. Jarreau’s Grammy earnings total seven, along with a nomination for the theme song from the ever-popular TV show, Moonlighting. Al Jarreau toured the world and delighted audiences, while also tirelessly working to promote the importance of keeping music and arts opportunities alive for children everywhere!\n\nThe Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to Al Jarreau on October 8, 2016 in the Grand Ballroom at the Pfister Hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The evening featured student performers from Lincoln Center for the Arts, Milwaukee High School for the Arts and other professional performers. Speakers included the Mayor of Milwaukee, friends and colleagues of Al Jarreau and more. The event was taped by Wisconsin Public Television as part of a documentary on Al Jarreau’s life coming out at a future date. The following commemorative video was presented as a special tribute during the Lifetime Achievement Award event.\n\nThank you to our donors and sponsors for this event!\n\nThank you to the companies that hosted a corporate table at our event: BestEd Business, Hal Leonard Corporation, Lincoln High School Alumni Association, Marcus Hotels & Resorts and Wisconsin Public Television."
