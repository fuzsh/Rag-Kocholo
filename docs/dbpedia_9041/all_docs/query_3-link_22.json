        "text": "The Al Jarreau album I listen to most is his live album, Look To the Rainbow. Followed by All Fly Home.\n\n[Copying below my prior post in this thread]\n\nI think Al Jarreau's best period is this run from 1978 to 1983. His music became much more commercial and pop after All Fly Home. I would recommend starting with All Fly Home and Jarreau (the earliest and latest of this run), then work your way to This Time and Breakin' Away. If you like the jazzier Al Jarreau, you can check out his albums before All Fly Home. The albums after Jarreau sound very 1980s in their production.\n\n1978: All Fly Home\n\n1980: This Time\n\n1981: Breakin' Away\n\n1983: Jarreau\n\nThis period is bookended by two very good live albums. Look to the Rainbow, the earlier one, is more jazz. In London, the later one, is Jarreau as pop star.\n\n1977: Look To The Rainbow\n\n1984: In London\n\nI could recommend any of the six above. If had to narrow down where you should start to learn about this artist, I'd pick All Fly Home, Jarreau and Look To The Rainbow.\n\nAudiophile notes: Friday Music has reissued some of Al Jarreau's albums on CD, some with bonus tracks, including Jarreau and In London from my recommendations above. Friday Music also put out a twofer of We Got By (1975) and Glow (1976) on one CD. Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab issued All Fly Home on vinyl in the late 1970s.\n\nBreakin' Away is certainly one of my favorite albums. This Time might be my favorite. His early often had a lot of less than stellar material with which he made the most of. But often they were most about his vocal pyrotechnics rather than having something to say with the song. His vocal styles started to support the material better as he got older. Certainly on his early live Look To The Rainbow set, his incredible take on \"Take Five\" was a career highlight. But when he got to This Time, he really hit a sweet spot of jazz and pop. It has his classic version of Chick Corea's \"Spain\". With Breakin' Away, he had a pop hit with the title cut. With that, he started to shift more toward commercial pop and funk. I saw him live three times in about a 6 year period, first with the Breakin' Away tour. Jarreau, the album that followed Breakin' Away followed a similar formula. High Crime after that got more into the funk, and less in jazz. Although he occasionally put out a more straight ahead jazz album, I sort of lost interest in him as he put out L Is For Lover (I still saw that tour), and Heart's Horizon. The last album at its first release was Heaven And Earth, at it had a cover of \"Blue In Green\", but he lost the focus I really liked. The last concert I saw, the L Is For Lover tour felt less personal, playful and loose."
