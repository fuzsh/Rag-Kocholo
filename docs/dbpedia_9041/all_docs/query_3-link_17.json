        "text": "Just visited Al Jarreau's website, and found out he has a new recording coming out this August. This one's called Accentuate The Positive, and features Jarreau in a quartet setting (Al, plus a jazz trio). I never did warm to his two other GRP releases (Tomorrow Today and All I Got), but this one will actually be something new, along with being a slight return to his roots.\n\naljarreau.com said:\n\n\"My new CD is on it's way and will be ready by Summer 2004. The CD is quite different than any other that I have recorded.\n\nAll songs were recorded live in the studio with a quartet. There were no string arrangements, no background arrangements, background vocals or overdubs, only two solo’s by harmonica and tenor sax were added after the original sessions where I sang along with the quartet.\".\n\nThe quartet includes piano, bass, drums and guitar. I’ll list the songs in a moment but in effect what we did was to select some classic standards, some jazz standards and added two original pieces. We allowed those classic compositions to lead us to new but simple arrangements of themselves. I sang more differently than ever! Here is the list of songs on my forthcoming new album.\n\n* Cold Duck\n\n* The Nearness of You\n\nI’m Beginning to See the Light\n\n* My Foolish Heart\n\n* The Midnight Sun\n\n* Accentuate the Positive\n\n* Betty Bee Bop’s Song\n\n* Waltz for Debbie\n\n* Groovin’ High\n\n* Lotus Flower\n\n* Scootch-a-Bootie.\n\nFirst time in awhile I've been excited about a new Al Jarreau release!\n\nI think there's very few out there who DON'T feel the same as you!\n\nJarreau essentially fell into the same trap as George Benson; he just drifted too far towards straightforward pop the further and further into the '80s (L IS FOR LOVER (as crazy as I am about \"Says\" - I LOVE that song!) alienated as much of his jazz audience as WHILE THE CITY SLEEPS ... did for Benson), and to this day is still trying to recover lost ground with critics and jazz purists.\n\nJeff F.\n\nI'm more tolerant of Al Jarreau's trips into pop/R&B/funk, mainly because that is another area of music I listen to. (And to be honest, I'd rather hear his version of funk and R&B than most others today!) I like the entire L Is For Lover album (Nile Rodgers production...good stuff!), and also have a fondness for High Crime and some of Heart's Horizon. His two most recent GRP releases didn't do much for me though...they were just noisy and overproduced, IMHO. But if you like earlier Jarreau, the live Tenderness album sort of leans toward his earlier nightclub days. I've seen him twice in concert--once for the Jarreau album, and the other just a few years ago when he was on a Montreux Festival tour with David Sanborn, Joe Sample, George Duke and Roberta Flack. Interesting show, since the artists performed together in different groupings (Jarreau and Sanborn on \"Since I Fell For You\",, which they performed on record with Bob James), as well as solo. (And what can be funkier than Joe Sample's \"Hippies On A Corner\"? )\n\nSpeaking of George Benson, I prefer his earlier vocal songs the best (from Breezin' or Give Me The Night). However, I really got into his Absolute Benson CD, which was contemporary jazz without being $moooth Jazz boredom. Just Benson and his guitar, with minimal vocals...just like the old days.\n\nUsually a new Jarreau album wouldn't mean much to me,but a couple of interesting bits from Verve's press releases. \"Cold Duck\" is indeed a vocal version of \"Cold Duck Time\",from the Les McCann/Eddie Harris popular jazz album,SWISS MOVEMENT(it was also the flip of the \"Compared to What\" single). \"Betty Bee Bop's Song\" is in tribute to the late Betty Carter,one of the most under rated voices ever-Al probably has a shrine to her art. And two songs with affiliation to pianist Bill Evans:\"My Foolish Heart\" and Bill's own composition,\"Waltz For Debby\". Philly Bassist Christian McBride and drummer Peter Erkstine are a major part of the backing,not just guesting-that could lead to some fine support. Also,this is the first album Al has done with producer Tommy LiPuma(of A&M/Horizon) fame in 25 years-it looks carefully planned--- hopefully it's well executed. Mac"
