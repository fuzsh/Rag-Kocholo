        "text": "Aaron Shorr\n\nSunday, September 8 at 7pm\n\nWe're excited to kick off our Fall '24 Jazz at the Fort Garry Hotel season with a special guest, former Winnipegger and guitarist extraordinaire, Aaron Shorr.\n\nAaron Shorr started playing guitar as a young teenager, and developed an interest in jazz through his grandmother’s record collection. He studied at Humber College in Toronto, the University of Manitoba, and privately with international jazz icons like Jonathan Kreisberg, Miles Okazaki, and Bruce Forman. He has performed with William Bonness, Caity Gyorgy, Jon McCasslin, and with Winnipeg's Rainbow Stage, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. Aaron also sits as musical director for Still Crazy: The Music of Paul Simon. In 2023 Aaron released his debut album Omand’s Creek (self released). Now living in Calgary, he maintains a busy schedule of performing and teaching.\n\nWe're thrilled to welcome Aaron back to Winnipeg for this special performance featuring pianist Carter Graham, bassist Julian Bradford, and drummer Kevin Waters.\n\nErin Propp + Larry Roy\n\nSunday, March 12 at 7pm\n\nErin Propp and Larry Roy reach into the everyday and blur the edges, creating works that are at once deeply personal and achingly relatable. Erin and Larry’s musical abilities are tools of exacting expression, expertly honed. They reach in to resonate, calling the listener inside, sounding the overtones of our shared experience.\n\nErin and Larry’s 2021 album, We Want All the Same Things, is their long-awaited second release, following their 2012 debut stunner, Courage, My Love (2012). Courage was met with praise, winning Best Jazz Album of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards (2013), and a Juno nomination in the category of Vocal Jazz Album of the Year (2014).\n\nWe Want All the Same Things is a new pinnacle of startling beauty and musical insight from the Winnipeg duo. This music speaks to the listener with songs that are powerful but not aggressive, and diverse without being in conflict. Erin and Larry’s songs explore the facets of people living alongside one another – the ease and adversity within mutualism, and ultimately the true privilege it is to struggle through life together.\n\nWoody Holler Trio\n\nSunday, April 2 at 7pm\n\nWoody Holler grew up listening to western music, but has since also developed a voracious appetite for jazz. Combining the two genres with a versatile, classically trained vocal style that ranges from opera to yodelling, Woody Holler’s show is a unique and exciting experience not to be missed! The Woody Holler Trio was formed around Woody’s lyric tenor voice and includes Chenoa McKelvey on guitar and Daniel Koulack on bass. The performance is reminiscent of a 1940s radio show, with a timeless, eclectic repertoire, and includes a dynamic range of styles and sounds from the operatic to show-stopping extreme yodelling.\n\nAudiences will get to experience finger-snapping shuffle beats, honey-slowed love croons, western classics, and a Golden Age lustre sure to transport the listener back in time.\n\nChenoa McKelvey is a freelance musician based out of Winnipeg, Manitoba. During her time as a student at the University of Manitoba's jazz studies program from 2014 to 2019, she honed her skill as a distinctly styled guitarist in a variety of genres such as blues, swing music, country music, and jazz. Citing influences such as Django Reinhardt, Charlie Christian, Barney Kessel, and Grant Green, McKelvey aims to bring an authenticity to her playing that is deeply rooted in the history of her instrument. Since the beginning of 2022, McKelvey has spent much of her time as an orchestra guitarist on various cruise ships playing with a plethora of guest artists, production shows, as well as regular solo and small group sets. While off the ship, she performs regularly as a solo artist, an accompanist, and in various musical groups around Winnipeg and surrounding areas, and has hosted open mics, jams, and leads and arranges for her own swing quartet Juvel.\n\nDaniel Koulack, whose music includes a broad range of genres, is a multi-instrumentalist specializing in clawhammer (or frailing) style banjo and string bass. Daniel’s own music can be heard on his three albums of original instrumental music, of which two were nominated for Juno awards in the Best Roots/Traditional category.\n\nMarco Castillo Brazilian Jazz Ensemble\n\nSunday, April 9 at 7pm\n\nMarco Castillo’s musical appetites were honed at the feet of the best; his father led the group Trio Irakitan and recorded prolifically, including with Nat King Cole. Born in the samba capital of the world, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Marco toured extensively as a sideman and bandleader in Brazil and South America after graduating with a B.A. in music.\n\nUpon arriving in Canada in 2007 as an experienced musician, Marco rapidly made an impact on the rich Winnipeg music community, recording three full length albums. Brazilian Season (2008) was top on the university and college radio charts for several weeks. In 2010 he was invited by CBC’s former producer Kinsey Posen to cover two songs for a CBC music project - “Heart of Gold “ and “These Eyes” were beautifully crafted in a unique Brazilian style. Marco's 2012 record Trip to Brazil won the Western Canadian Music Award for Best World Music, and Zabelê (2014) was also nominated at the WCMAs. In 2015, Marco's newest album found him representing Brazil in one of the biggest Latin American festivals in Viña del Mar, Chile with his original piece “Forró no Canadá”. Marco performed twice for 15,000 people at the venue La quinta vergara. The live show was broadcast to millions around the globe and he was one of six finalists. In the same year he performed an epic show at venue Beco das garrafas, the cradle of bossa nova in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAlways looking for inspiration, Marco has collaborated and performed with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, Winnipeg Jazz Orchestra and plenty of local and international artists, as well as toured in western Canada. Whether leading his full band, Brazilian Beats, or small ensembles, Castillo is a versatile musician and producer who blends smoothly and passionately into any musical context.\n\nMarco has several music projects on the go for release in 2023 - new music is being cooked!\n\nAmber Epp Sings Joni Mitchell\n\nSunday, April 23 at 7pm\n\nImagine a child that always sings at the dinner table. One who gets sent outside by a mother who can only hear “The Lonely Goatherder” so many times. A little girl that, having played a song on the piano with her fingers, tries it with her toes. This same child follows her family around the globe, from adventures in Australia, to climbing the Grand Canyon, to getting trapped in Mayan caves. Such an upbringing is sure to release a unique and fiery personality.\n\nAdventure, discovery, and joy culminate in the music of Amber Epp. All at once alluring and uplifting, Amber shares her joy for life and excitement in the undiscovered in each performance. With heartstrings pulled by the freedom of jazz and the rhythm of Latin music, she unites her favourite styles in a delightful way.\n\nA trip to New York City sparked the fire for jazz; now Amber leaves a blazing trail wherever she performs. Inspired by jazz greats like Ella Fitzgerald, modern singers like Dianne Reeves, and new discoveries like Gretchen Parlato, Amber’s gift for music, improvising, and languages ignites every song.\n\nThe endless fields, the big sky, and the music - Joni Mitchell and Amber share these common elements of growing up in The Prairies. Enjoy a night of Joni Mitchell songs reimagined. Maybe a new beat, maybe a few extra chords, maybe a different instrument. Audiences will recognize these well-known songs and fall in love with them all over again as they're presented in a new light. Enjoy an entire concert of jazzy Joni Mitchell tunes in Winnipeg's newest live music space: The Club Room at the Fort Garry Hotel.\n\nNadia Douglas\n\nSunday, May 21 at 7pm\n\nNadia Douglas is a jazz singer with a passion for swing jazz and classic standards. With a rich alto voice, keen rhythmic intuition, and an actress's insight into a great lyric, Nadia’s performances breathe new life into the songs she loves.\n\nBased in Winnipeg, Nadia developed a love for the golden age of jazz.

His musical performances encompass jazz, pop, rock, cabaret songs, and more. Audiences may also recognize him as the Programs Manager of Jazz Winnipeg, where he spends his workdays helping to promote the rich and vibrant culture of jazz in Winnipeg.\n\nAbout Al Jarreau: The only vocalist in history to net Grammy Awards in three different categories (jazz, pop, and R&B), Al Jarreau was a virtuoso performer who balanced smooth lyricism with his own innovative brand of vocalese. Initially emerging in the late '60s, Jarreau drew audiences with his dynamic blend of jazz balladry and vocalese. By the '70s, he had caught the industry's attention and delivered a series of highly acclaimed crossover albums, including 1977's Grammy Award-winning Look to the Rainbow: Live in Europe, that found him tackling a mix of stylistically varied cover songs as well as his own emotive originals. Although his skills were based in jazz, his albums found him just as adept at interpreting folk, R&B, pop, and funk. This wide adaptability, paired with his warmly upbeat charisma, brought him huge success throughout the '80s and found him moving increasingly into the commercial pop sphere with sleek productions like 1981's Breakin' Away, which earned him two more Grammy Awards. Along with his own albums, he also made a cultural impact, contributing to the landmark charity album USA for Africa: We Are the World, and he reached an even broader audience as the singer and co-writer of the iconic theme to the '80s TV show Moonlighting. After his recordings slowed somewhat in the '90s, Jarreau returned to regular activity in the 2000s. He earned his 11th Grammy Award for his work on \"God Bless the Child\" with Jill Scott and George Benson from Scott's Collaborations in 2007, and issued a steady stream of his own recordings that, as with his final album, 2014's My Old Friend: Celebrating George Duke, often found him returning to his jazz roots.\n\nKeith Price introduced Amber Epp to Joni Mitchell on vinyl in his sunny Osborne Village apartment.

What started as playing together in the University of Manitoba's Jazz Program blossomed into a 20-year musical partnership.\n\n\"I credit Keith with widening my musical scope, particularly with Canadian musicians,\" Amber says. \"He showed me connections between bands like the Tragically Hip and The Guess Who and jazz sensibilities. He introduced me to Canadian bands like Arcade Fire and The Bros. Landreth. Keith convinced me that even though it wasn't jazz, they were still worth a listen. Together, we find creative ways to share their music beyond simply covering their tunes.\"\n\nKeith says: \"I remember performing together with Amber at the Monday Night Hang at the Freehouse. We were both there every week for a couple of years, and were both serious about improving our craft. Amber pushes herself as an artist, performing in multiple languages and is a highly skilled pianist, composer, arranger, and bandleader. She is a good friend, and I enjoy collaborating with her because she is open to experimenting with music and seeing what happens.\"\n\nIn 2019, Keith moved to Aotearoa/New Zealand to teach and coordinate the Jazz Program at the University of Auckland.

Whether performing with a double-quartet, a trio, or as a solo guitarist, Keith’s musical focus is on openness, imagination, and the search for a shared connection with fellow musicians and audiences alike.\n\nImagine a child that always sings at the dinner table.

Such an upbringing is sure to release a unique and fiery personality. Adventure, discovery, and joy culminate in the music of Amber Epp. All at once alluring and uplifting, Amber shares her joy for life and excitement in the undiscovered in each performance.
