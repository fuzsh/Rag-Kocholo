        "text": "Sponsored by Amoeba MusicFollowing the unexpected passing of legendary keyboardist, composer and producer George Duke, GRAMMY-award winning singer and song stylist Al Jarreau pays a fond tribute to Duke in My Old Friend: Celebrating George Duke, to be released August 5 on Concord Records. Garnering a stellar list of musicians including bassists Marcus Miller and Stanley Clarke; saxophonists Gerald Albright and Boney James; and singers Dianne Reeves, Kelly Price, Lalah Hathaway and Jeffrey Osborne; among others, the new album illustrates Duke’s broad musical scope that includes post-bop, jazz-fusion, R&B and Brazilian jazz. Jarreau and Duke formed an interminable relationship upon meeting in San Francisco in 1965, while Jarreau was working as a social-worker and Duke was establishing himself, playing on weekends at Half Note. After Jarreau made his debut on-stage one Sunday night, he was invited to join Duke’s trio on a regular basis. My Old Friend, extends Duke’s legacy, in addition to being another bright spot in Jarreau’s own illustrious repertoire. The album commences with a gem from Jarreau’s own songbook, “My Old Friend,” from his 1981 landmark LP Breakin’ Away. The motif of friendship emanates from the laidback mid-tempo groove of the track, and remains a central theme throughout the album. Please join us as we welcome Jarreau to the Clive Davis Theater to celebrate the release of the new album with an interview, moderated by Vice President of The GRAMMY Foundation and MusiCares Scott Goldman, and performance.\n\nOther\n\nCurrent Exhibits"
