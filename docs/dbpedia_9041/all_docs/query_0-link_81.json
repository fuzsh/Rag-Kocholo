        "text": "September 13th: 7:30 pm - 8:30 pm @ Lane Library\n\nThe author of Never Givin’ Up: The Life and Music of Al Jarreau and Professor Emeritus of Music Kurt Dietrich will be on campus for a reading of the newly published authorized biography.\n\nDietrich will read from the book and discuss his research in a public presentation.\n\nJarreau is the only person in history to win Grammy Awards in three different categories: jazz, pop and R&B. He recorded more than two dozen albums over three decades and was renowned for his ability to sing many styles, including scat singing and taking on the character of guitar and percussion, all with his versatile and soulful voice. He acted on Broadway in the hit musical “Grease” and appeared on the television programs “New York Undercover” and “Touched by an Angel.”\n\nClick here to learn more about the biography and Dietrich.\n\nUpcoming Events"
