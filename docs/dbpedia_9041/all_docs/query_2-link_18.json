Thank you very much for this useful and great work.\n\nUnfortunately i am just learning about regular expressions, so this is my issue:\n\nI want to shorten the Artist Name and Title name this way;\n\nArtist Name.\n\na. I want to preserve only the first letter for all words with maximum 3 letters\n\nb. Then for the rest of the words i want to preserve the first 3 letters:\n\nArctic Monkeys : ArcMon\n\nAlice In Chains : AliICha\n\nFaith No More : FaiNMor\n\nGuns And Roses: GunARos\n\nTitle Name. I want to preserve only the first Letter of every word except for the last word. Last word would not be shortened. Titles with just one word would remain unchanged.\n\nHere Comes The Rain Again : HCTRAgain\n\nMy Immortal : MImmortal\n\nLove Hate Love: LHLove\n\nWell, i hope you could help me.\n\nThank you very much pals.\n\nCarlos Enrique.\n\nEverything is possible as soon as you define clear and strict rules. We are \"intelligent\" and deviate many times from the main rule. Program is no intelligent but strictly follows our orders.\n\nDo you want always to follow those rule?\n\nPlease specify if you foresee any exceptions.\n\nThank you.\n\nBefore anybody starts wrinkling his brain:\n\nWhat about\n\ninitials, (e.g. Andrea T. Mendoza)\n\nsingle name names (e.g. ABBA)\n\nnon-letters (numbers, ampersand e.g. Booker T. & MGs, 50 Cent)\n\nnames with 3 or less letters (e.g. Al Jarreau)\n\nname extensions (e.g. Sammy Davis jr., Booker Newberry III)\n\nnames that are already short (e.g. DJ FK)\n\nDo you really want to get rid of perfectly sound data and replace it with an arbitrary heap of letters?\n\nVictor, thank you very much for taking the time to help.\n\nI will try this later and i will be careful.\n\nIÂ´ll give you feedback tomorrow.\n\nBest regards."
