        "text": "Jay Graydon News Archive\n\nDecember, 2021\n\nJAY GRAYDON - Happy Holidays!\n\nHey everyone, Happy Holidays to all!\n\n1. Just an update of what is happening. Randy and I are going to finally mix the JaR album entitled CODE. That is happening now!\n\n2. After keeping notes for many years, it is time to finally do an autobiography on video. I'm going to talk like I typically do and that will be in a book form as well along with many pictures.\n\n3. In a few months time I will start a YouTube educational channel in which I will share my best tips and tricks in recording and guitar land. I have been into electronics as far back as I can remember and at age 11, my dad bought me a mono tape recorder and gave me some mikes, a mixer, and a power amp with speakers he got from a night club, in which he was part owner, when the night club closed. When I was in my early 20s, I bought a 4 track recorder, more mics, a better mixer, etc. Then, while I was doing record sessions for a living, I bought a 3M 8 track reorder, a 2 track Ampex recorder, then a 16 track recorder, then a 24 track recorder, better mixers along the way and so on. In 1979, I had a real recording studio built from the ground up that I still have, which is a pro recording studio. Two 24 track recorders, two 2-track recorders, major outboard gear, so many synths/samplers, ADAT recorders, and finally Pro Tools systems.\n\nAlong the way, I figured out so many recording techniques. After coming up with the idea, I would then figure out how to make the idea work using electronics. I had also learned ideas from other engineers and I would then figure out if I could improve such ideas, which typically happened. There is so much to teach!\n\nThat is when my PA Kerstin said we should set up a business YouTube Channel, so I have been keeping notes for the past year as to not forget such ideas.\n\nI will start from the beginning so everything makes sense as when I read articles that does not explain the full electronic path, I realized every step needs to be noted and shown recording video of every step! This information will be very important for the beginner in bedroom/house studios with minimum equipment through pro engineers/pro studios!\n\nI will also teach guitar stuff as well and will do many interviews with so many people in all fields meaning musicians, recording artists, etc.\n\nI am also working on a guitar book (with Kerstin's sons, Stefan and Peppe) as I don't want to spend the time learning a notation program, plus the cats have thought of ideas that should be included! I will also video the guitar stuff along with a few surprises guitarists will love!\n\nWe will then do a book for keyboard, drums, and bass.\n\nLast thing for now. If you have not purchased the Famous E Electric Piano it is the best sounding Rhodes ever! The full story is noted on my website!\n\nChris Poehler, Greg Schlaepfer, and I started a sampling project a few months ago that will be around 10,000 DX7/TX7, and maybe more of the DX synth series, samples! I was amazed that the midi on DX7s did not use the full 127 step velocities! We will explain when the program comes out. It is time for those sounds to make a return in pop music since it has been many years since the sounds have been available!\n\nThat is all for now. - Your pal, Jay\n\nJAY GRAYDON - plus a Few More First Call Guitarists\n\nL to R : Ray Parker Jr, Lee Ritenour, Steve Lukather, Dean Parks, Jay Graydon. Photo © Nathan East 2021\n\nJay's comments:\n\nRay Parker has a pal named Ola, who is Norwegian and when Ola comes into town Ray sets up a big hang with some of the cats. This time it was major as like probably 30 people were there.\n\nNate East took that picture as Nate was sitting right across from me. I spent a lot of time talking to Freddie Washington, who is the bass player in Steely Dan and a great cat. Sylvester Rivers was there as well and all kinds of other cats and it just so happened that the five of us in the picture ended up in that area where Nate took the picture!\n\nCan you imagine how many albums have been sold with all of us five cats, who played guitar on so many records? Obviously someone said something real funny since were all laughing. Whenever any of us get together, there's always so many stories and we also get into technical stuff, etc.\n\nIt was a very fun hang and it's clear that we're all like brothers! We all have so much respect for each other! - Jay\n\nNovember, 2021\n\nJAY GRAYDON - New Version of Mornin'\n\nJay groovin' hard with Mark Kibble (Take 6), Janis Siegel (The Manhattan Transfer), Lauren Kinhan (New York Voices), and others, playing guitar on a new version of his own song MORNIN'.\n\n\"Join Janis Siegel (The Manhattan Transfer) and Lauren Kinhan (New York Voices) as they welcome Mark Kibble (Take 6), La Tanya Hall, Liane Carroll, Raul Midón, young artist Georgia Heers to the Vocal Gumbo kitchens.

Jay did new versions of \"Twilight Zone / Twilight Tone\" and \"Nothin' You Can Do About It\" for this project and the album will be released next year.\n\nHe has also collaborated with Mark Kibble (TAKE 6) on a project, which will be presented in a video on the Music-with-a-Mission platform Virtual Vocal Gumbo - November 11th at 8PM ET /5PM PT. This Online Music Festival website is maintained by Janis Siegel, Lauren Kinhan, and Laurie Green.\n\nSeptember, 2021\n\nJAY GRAYDON - Interviews and More\n\nYes, it has been very quiet here for quite some time, but that does not mean that Jay has been inactive. On the contrary, Jay has been very busy with various projects lately, which we will tell you more about once we can reveal them. Further, he has been doing several interviews via Zoom and over the phone and continues to do so, as well as doing guitar work for an album, which will be released in a few months.\n\nOn the to-do-list now is hopefully the release of the second JaR album - CODE - by the end of this year, and apart from compiling material for his autobiography and for another book on music Jay is also preparing content and topics for his upcoming YouTube educational channel. We will announce here as soon as we launch the channel.\n\nSo keep hanging around as there is sooo much more coming!\n\n************************** TILLFÄLLIG PARKERING\n\nJANUARY 2023 Playlist - Jay Graydon: The Al Jarreau Productions\n\nJay Graydon produced 4 of the Al Jarreau albums in full - BREAKIN' AWAY, JARREAU, HIGH CRIME, THIS TIME - and 5 of the songs on HEART'S HORIZON.\n\nMore details on the production page, in the song catalogue and in the discography under the letter J.\n\n*************************\n\nDecember, 2020\n\nJAY GRAYDON - December 2020 Interviews\n\nJay has been doing several interviews and podcasts in November/December and we will post links to them on the website, as they become available.\n\nJazz talk episode 65 Jay Graydon Pt 1.\n\nAn in depth interview with Guitarist, producer, songwriter Jay Graydon - Part 1.

It's an album that Jay Graydon produced the whole tracks for the first time in 1977. We have just started the mail order today, the 8th of October, and it's the 71st birthday of Mr. Jay Graydon!!\n\nHappy Birthday, Jay-sama!! - Toshi\n\nRead more about it and ORDER YOUR COPY HERE!\n\nJay's comments on this re-release.\n\nHey Everyone,\n\nAt this time, my studio was 16 tracks and a simple mixer with 22 inputs. I had a BX20 reverb and some outboard equipments along with some good mikes. In between sessions I would write and demo songs and I knew I wanted to be a full time record producer at some point. My good friend John Farrar (Olivia Newton John's producer) had a friend he knew in Australia who was a good selling artist in Australia wanted to come to LA to make an album. Even though the budget was limited, I wanted experience as a producer so I took the gig so this was my first record production.\n\nI was still doing record dates full time so I had to fit in the sessions for Barry's album in-between sessions and probably worked on the weekends. I worked quickly on the album but since I am a perfectionist, I had to do a good job as always. You will notice all of the musicians are mostly the \"A\" studio players and everyone played very well as expected!\n\nSince I only co-wrote a few songs, Barry's songs had simple chord changes and I always do my best to make the songs as classy as possible so I came up with hipper chords changes where they would work but not to hip as we always must respect the songs and audience. When writing out the arrangements, since again I needed to move quickly, I used the first ideas that came to mind and most likely wrote out most of what was going to be played on the tracking date that included some hook lines. I was not concerned with the guitar parts when writing out the arrangements since I would overdub the guitar parts and did my best to come up with hooky sounding lines.\n\nBarry has good pitch so recording the vocals was fairly easy. Also, Barry is a very nice guy so easy to get along with.\n\nIn conclusion, you will hear how we all played during that time and the beginning of my production work. I remember we had fun and as always, a learning experience. I hope you like the album and have fun reflecting as to the era. - Jay\n\nB-DAY MESSAGE FROM JAY!\n\nHey guys!\n\nI hope you are doing well! I really appreciate your kind birthday wishes and Im glad to still be on the planet and fully functional!\n\nSadly musicians are obviously in the group of people who have taken a hard hit like it was not bad enough Spotify and like have destroyed what was left of the music business! Heres hoping when Covid 19 is under control, we can get back to normal making people happy through our music!\n\nThere is a bit of good news, which is pop music is starting to return to quality music with melodies that are using more notes beyond the pentatonic scale! Further chord structures beyond very simple stock progressions are making a return! The best part for guitarists is the guitar playing is very similar to the rhythm guitar and single note parts almost identical to last golden era of music (mid 70s through mid 80s)! Even the sounds are reverting to that era such as the new Maroon 5 song, which features a Fender Rhodes! The famous E Electronic piano was not yet released when they recorded the song but the keyboard players in the band (such as Sam Farrar) now have the famous \"E\"! If I have not explained how the E was discovered and what made this instrument in demand, let me know and I will tell the full story, which is fluke of events!\n\nHeres hoping 2021 will be a great year and us musicians will once again be able to play live and record with the rhythm section in one room!\n\nI thank you again for all of your kind birthday wishes as you have made my day!\n\nYour musical pal, Jay\n\nAugust, 2020\n\nJARREAU MEDLEY SHOWCASING THE FAMOUS E ELECTRIC PIANO!\n\nHey everyone, check out this video with a Jarreau medley. I can't believe how great Stefan is playing! Also Peppe did an excellent job on the programming! These demos are the best of the best as the songs are from the era! Stefan has become such an outstanding player on all levels and plays the songs exactly like they should be played for pitching! Keep the demos coming as you cats are doing better demos than anyone!!!! These guys are playing great and they're really really really great demos!\n\nHey Stefan,\n\nOUTSTANDING MAN!!!! You and Peppe have done such an incredible job on all of the stuff and the Jarreau Medley is killer!!!!\n\nNo doubt your State Cows fanbase digs the E. - Jay\n\nMore demos here The Famous E Electric Piano\n\nJuly, 2020\n\nTWO INTERVIEWS BY JON LAMOREAUX AT THE HUSTLE!\n\nPromo Mode - Jay Graydon discusses the famous \"E\" Electric Keyboard (and a bunch of other stuff)\n\nJuly 18, 2020\n\nMusicians, keyboardists, gearheads, lend us your ears! Jay Graydon is back to tell us the story of the famous E Electric Piano which was a sought after session instrument in the early 80s and how it's been sampled and is now for sale. He also discusses a new Youtube channel is starting where he will share tricks of the trade and we hear stories about David Foster, Ray Parker Jr. his approach to production, guitars, perfect pitch, and a million other things. Get to know how the mind of a musical genius works!\n\nEpisode 271 - Jay Graydon\n\nJuly 15, 2020\n\nJay Graydon is one of rock's most wildly successful multi-hyphenates. He was a first call session guitarist in LA for most of the 70s with one of his biggest claims to fame being the solo on Steely Dan's \"Peg\". He also wrote huge hits for artists like DeBarge, George Benson, and Earth, Wind and Fire, formed the fantastic, but short-lived band Airplay with burgeoning mega-producer David Foster, and then he produced huge albums by Al Jarreau, Patti LaBelle and Kenny Rogers. Not to mention, if you've seen him in the great doc Hired Gun, you know what a funny, honest guy he is. In this loose and sprawling conversation, we cover all of this and much much more including his interest in magic and bowling. Stories abound!\n\nTHE FAMOUS E ELECTRIC PIANO - RELEASE JULY 10, 2020!\n\nMessage from Jay:\n\nHey everyone,\n\nAfter 3 years of working on the FAMOUS E ELECTRIC PIANO sampling project, we are releasing the sample program this morning (7-10-2020) at 10am West Coast time in the states!!!!\n\nYou can hear a few demos on our specific page for the \"E\" - The Famous E Electric Piano as well as many demos on the - Orange Tree Samples page. BTW Orange Tree Samples is the company, which is selling our product and for the first two weeks, it is on sale, so please tell anyone you think would be interested!\n\nThere are some testimonials on both pages and there will be more demos and testimonials, which we will post, when other great players have played the E!\n\nThe main version is 96k 24 bit as that was the sample rate in which we sampled. The \"E\" uses Kontakt (version 5.7 or higher) or Kontakt Player made by Native Instruments. Kontakt Player is free and can be downloaded on the Native Instruments site.\n\nKontakt will re-sample as per your session in your DAW but if your session is not 96k 24 bit, \"aliasing\" is in play so, since we are perfectionists and want the user to have the best quality possible, we are also offering 3 other downloads for all sample rates below meaning 88.2k-24bit, 48k-24bit, 44.1.k-24bit as to eliminate \"aliasing\".\n\nI have done tutorials (and more to follow very soon) showing options and tricks to get the \"E\" sounding as good as possible. You can find the tutorials here - The Famous E Electric Piano and like I noted above, there are more to come so please check back with us from time to time.\n\nIf you would like to hear some records in which I used the \"E\" on albums I produced (with David Foster playing), no doubt Spotify or the like has the following songs that feature the \"E\".\n\nMornin' (Al Jarreau from the album entitled, Jarreau)\n\nSave Me (Al Jarreau from the album entitled, Jarreau)\n\nFor You (Dionne Warwick from the album entitled, Friends In Love)\n\nThere are so many other songs in which I used the \"E\" as well as other artists!\n\nI always say any electronic instrument is as only as good as the weakest component in the chain. In this case, obviously quite by accident, there are no weak components!\n\nThe odds are good all of you know of this instrument that was manufactured by Fender but we are not allowed to use the name since after the designer, \"Harold\" (again, we can't mention his last name) passed away, some person copyrighted the name and is suing anyone who uses the word! (What a strange situation for someone to do that). So Harold was told this instrument was the best sounding of all of the (word we can't use) built, he found George and went to his home to hear this electric piano. After doing so, he told George it is the most beautiful sounding (the word again) he has ever heard!\n\nOn behalf of my partners George Mamalakis and Greg Schlaepfer, we hope you enjoy the \"E\" as much as we do!\n\nIf you would like to know how the \"E\" was discovered, it is a good story! Read all about it George Mamalakis project page - The Famous E Sampling Project - JAY GRAYDON\n\nRANDY GOODRUM - RED EYE!\n\nMy JaR partner Randy Goodrum has recorded a solo album and I must say it is outstanding on all levels!!!! It is called Red Eye and here's Randy's website - Randy Goodrum - Red Eye - if you are interested in purchasing.\n\nJune, 2020\n\nTHE FAMOUS E ELECTRIC PIANO IS ALMOST HERE - UPDATE!\n\nMessage from Jay:\n\nHey Cats,\n\nFOR YOU really does show the beauty of the E.\n\nNo Phase 90 as the effects are limited to what Kontakt has.\n\nThe release of the E is literally a few days away! NI is doing a quick check and then we will release!\n\nI am going to do a video tutorial in a few days to make it easy regarding navigation and will note important stuff, but this video wont be posted until the day of release! This video and others will be posted in a new YouTube channel, which my PA Kerstin will set up. We will keep you posted as to when this new channel is set up and cleared.\n\nBack to Kontakt (the program runs in Kontakt and Kontakt Player. It requires Kontakt 5.7 or higher!\n\nThere is another company that claims to have samples the Famous E but that is not true! That program has 5 velocity layers and ours has 18!\n\nThe other company did not rebuild the Rhodes and left in all kinds of clanks and bad mechanical problems! The first thing to do with any vintage instrument is to get it sounding as it did when it was new, which is what we did! This project took 3 years as we are all perfectionists!\n\nI think there will be a discount offer for the first 2 weeks only so if interested, please check back with us every day! Also, please pass the word along as that would be most appreciated!\n\nA few more things to note for now. All of the choruses are great and one is a special design we did called Logical.\n\nBack in the day, I asked GML EQ, which is the best analog EQ ever making the E sound so delicious!\n\nSince the Kontakt EQ and effects are not very good (they really need to update their plugs as old and the EQ sucks), I will note in the tutorial what I am using to record as to plug in EQ.\n\nIn closing, the best Rhodes ever is back and everyone will love the instrument as much as me and my 2 partners on the project.\n\nOrange Tree Samples is the place to buy the E and Greg (the owner of Orange Tree Samples) is a genius as to his coding!\n\nTHE FAMOUS E ELECTRIC PIANO IS ALMOST HERE!\n\nMessage from Jay:\n\nHey everyone,\n\nThe Famous E Electric Piano will be released in no more than two weeks and more than likely even sooner!\n\nThere is no doubt this is the best Fender Rhodes ever! Harold Rhodes once came to GEORGEs house (GEORGE MAMALAKIS owns the E Rhodes) and Harold said its the best Rhodes he has ever heard! No doubt he has played and heard hundreds if not thousands of Rhodes!\n\nNote that as soon as the E is released, I will do a video tutorial on the way I approach the settings along with tips and tricks that are important.\n\nYou may want to listen to the Al Jarreau track MORNIN from the Jarreau album self titled JARREAU. Most all the tracks that have Rhodes are great examples of the sound, such as the song SAVE ME, which shows the absolute beauty of the Rhodes in the intro.\n\nAnother classic song with the famous E is from the Dionne Warwick album FRIENDS IN LOVE. Listen to the first track - FOR YOU - as that once again features the Rhodes big-time!\n\nAs soon as the E is available for sale, we will post and note the link to Orange Tree Samples. I think for the first two weeks only, there will be a discount. That is the last I heard so I bet that will be the case.\n\nOrange Tree Samples is the company we partnered with and our partner GREG SCHLAEPFER, who owns the company, is an absolute genius writing code that was extremely important.\n\nHere below is a message from George Mamalakis.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nHello Everyone from George Mamalakis, owner of the E Rhodes and the E Model Rhodes website.\n\nAll of you have contacted me in the past with questions and comments regarding the E Rhodes. And most of you are aware that I have been working in collaboration with Jay Graydon and Greg Schlaepfer, owner of Orange Tree Samples, to produce a virtual version of the E Rhodes. Most of you have also asked to be notified when the sample library will be released, and that is why I am writing to you at this time.\n\nI am thrilled to announce that The Famous E Electric Piano sample library will be available for purchase before the end of June from Orange Tree Samples. I have updated my E Model Rhodes website with a special page entitled \"Project Update\" where you will find a very comprehensive overview of the library. i have included graphics of the User Interfaces with descriptions of the controls and settings as well as audio demos of some of the preset sounds that will be instantly available when you open up the library for the first time. There are 15 demo tunes representing the 15 \"factory\" presets which I have created. When the product is released, it will also include 15 \"factory\" presets created by Jay Graydon and 15 created by Greg Schlaepfer. These 45 presets will, of course, include many versions and enhancements of the sound that made the E Rhodes famous but will also include presets that illustrate the wide range of tonality that the E Rhodes, and now The Famous E Electric Piano are capable of. A special surprise treat is a recording of Al Jarreau's iconic tune Mornin' produced and performed by Johan Landqvist of Sweden (along with friends on bass and drums). We thought it would be a surefire way to demonstrate that The Famous E Electric Piano is truly the virtual equivalent of the E Rhodes.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions and I promise that I will notify you the minute that we know The Famous E Electric Piano is released and available. (Please let me know if you do not want to be contacted.)\n\nI have been privileged to own the E Rhodes since 1985 and now I am so excited that I can share its sound and magic with the world!\n\nAll the best, George Mamalakis\n\nClick here to go to the Project Update page.\n\nMay, 2020\n\nMAY 2020 UPDATE!\n\nMessage from Jay:\n\nHey all,\n\nas we know, things will never be the same caused by the pandemic! We need to stand united as to do whatever we can to get back to work so if anyone has ideas, they should tell the representatives in their country noting we need financial help from the government! Unemployment Benefits is a start but it seems musicians are left out on stuff like free loans and so on.\n\nMusicians are clearly hit very hard as no live playing of any kind, no studio recording with multiple people in the room, films cant be made, and the list goes on and on! How are we supposed to make a living in this business? The only thing we can do is to do home recording with someone creating the basic track and then send the files around for overdubs. I am going to do a video on this along with many educational videos in technical land for Pro Tools and the like, guitar teaching, and more!\n\nI am also going to do an instructional video as to teach relative pitch and how to practice. I have no doubt you will really love this stuff as I have been practicing relative pitch, since I was 14 when I found out I will never have perfect pitch so I wanted to get as close to perfect pitch as possible. That will be for sale via a new YouTube channel, which we will set up in a few months time. Yea, I already have an official YouTube channel for various stuff - Graydon/Olofsson - linked from my website - so this new second channel will be a subscription based educational club, and the relative pitch video will be for sale, but all of the other stuff will be for free! We will ask you to please sign up to my club for free (Jay Graydon and Friends) as to keep you informed of what is added as we go. You will also be able to request I do videos on certain subjects.\n\nAll of this will begin in a few months, but first I will finish the JaR 2 mixes and we will also be ready to finally launch the first version of The Famous E Electric Piano Sampling Project in just a few weeks.\n\nIn any case, enjoy this video my PA Kerstin created on an arrangement I did.\n\nWhen I was in Japan promoting my album, \"Airplay for the Planet\", I was asked to do a video for a major TV show. They asked that I play the \"Star Spangled Banner\" starting with a melodic chord melody rendition and then break into a Jimi Hendrix thing. I spent a few hours in the hotel working out the chord melody part. When I got back to L.A. the song came to mind and I finished the chord melody arrangement in full. I never thought I would record it, but when I worked on my BEBOP album, a few of my guitar pals said I should record and include this arrangement as well.\n\nFurther, since I could mix the BEBOP album leaving out one instrument, I did a few versions in that fashion and published one of them - the Minus-Guitar version - on Hal Leonard. So, the BEBOP album is also available as a \"Jam-with-the-Band\" book/CD package, which is a book with the sheet music and a CD with the music minus guitar as to play with the band with top-notch session players. The book/CD package lets you learn and perform 8 of my original bebop tunes, plus the Star Spangled Banner - a rare opportunity for young jazz music students to perform with a real bebop band and a fun way of keeping your chops up, while playing alone at home. After all, there has never been a better time than right now, to learn and hone your playing skills.\n\nHere you will find more info on the BEBOP album and the recording process plus pics and another video. Both the BEBOP album and the \"Jam-with-the-Band\" book/CD package, are available on e.g. Amazon and other online stores, via my website. - Jay Graydon\n\nJay Graydon - BEBOP (album)\n\nJay Graydon - BEBOP (Minus-Guitar Book/CD)\n\nApril, 2020\n\nJAY IN AL JARREAU DOCUMENTARY!\n\nJay is featured in the UNSUNG documentary about AL JARREAU Season 14 - Episode 16 (1 hour). Two showings back to back at 7 and 8pm. Here is a trailer for the show Al Jarreau Went from Local Jazz Singer to World Famous R&B and Pop Star in which Jay explains how they did it.\n\nJay's comments:\n\nHey everyone, I did an extensive interview for the Al Jarreau documentary that will be aired tonight - April 12, 2020 UNSUNG / AL JARREAU Season 14 - Episode 16 (1 hour). Two showings back to back at 7 and 8pm. It may also be available on streaming services like Netflix and Amazon but not sure so if you are in the states you can get access to the channel TV1 (328 on Direct TV). I hope the editor used some of the good stories.\n\nI hope they use the part about the songs and alternate versions that have never been released!!!!\n\nAs most of you may know, Jarreau was a jazz artist and would have probably remained so playing jazz clubs. When I was asked to produce him, it was my goal to turn him into a pop, R&B, AC star, which obviously happened. The 4 1/2 albums I produced for him were his best selling albums with major Grammy nominations and wins such as POP ALBUM OF THE YEAR. Here is the list of Grammy nominations for the Jarreau albums.\n\nAlbum Of The Year - BREAKIN' AWAY\n\nBest Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocals - MORNIN'\n\nBest Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocals - STEP BY STEP\n\nBest Engineered Recording - for the JARREAU album\n\nProducer Of The Year - for the JARREAU album\n\nYou will also find more info on the albums I produced on my website.\n\nI would have continued producing Al, but a moron got in the chain that was a relative of the manager. This is the perfect example that music is fun, BUT the music business is not fun! Anyway, the moron story will be included in my autobiography. I will hopefully release the book at the end of the year! The book has many funny stories!\n\nRegarding the moron story, Heres a tip for anyone that is producing demos and ends up working as a record producer. Never let anyone in the studio, who is not directly working on the record! Tell people who will be in the studio to work, do not bring anyone with you! Its a job, not a hangout! That reminds me Yoko should have had the sense to not go in the studio when recording as no doubt the other cats in the band were bugged! If you want a band to break up, this will surely help speed up that process. (g)\n\nIn any case, I bet the documentary will be good as I really liked the beautiful lady who interviewed me! She is very intelligent and knew the questions to ask! I hope the editor included the best stuff from all people who were interviewed!\n\nIll be watching with you! - Jay\n\nJAY GRAYDON MUSIC NOW ON AMAZON!\n\nCD Baby has decided to retire their store as of April 2020, so to purchase Jay's music please go to our pages at AMAZON instead.\n\nSonic Thrust Records albums and downloads available at AMAZON.\n\nJay Graydon's other albums and downloads available at AMAZON.\n\nJaR (Jay Graydon & Randy Goodrum) albums and downloads available at AMAZON.\n\nMarch, 2020\n\nKEITH OLSEN PASSING!\n\nA message from Jay:\n\nThere is a bonus of being a studio musician when the musician is also a recording engineer such as in my case. I would look at how engineers set up microphones on drums and all the instruments. During playbacks, I would look at the recording console to see how the engineers set the equalization, the outboard gear they patched in such as compressors and so on.\n\nA few engineers stick out as the best of the best and KEITH was one of them! I would always ask engineers questions when I liked their sound.\n\nKEITH was one of the best I have worked with over the years and when I asked him questions he was always glad to pass along his information. When I built my current home studio, I asked him what would be the best way to position the drums, meaning on the floor or on a riser. He said a riser is much better because its not making direct contact with studio floor if using rubber on the drum riser. I took his advice and had a drum riser platform built with rubber on all the wood that was touching the floor.\n\nWe stayed in contact over the years and shared information and always learned from each other!\n\nAnybody I know would agree with what I had noted regarding his work! KEITH was also a very nice guy! He is surely going to be missed by many people! The best news is the records he engineered and produced stand the test of time! - Jay Graydon\n\nPLEASE SAVE THE SONGWRITERS!\n\nHey everyone, we received this image below from NMPA in the mail today with the caption below ...\n\n\"Songwriters: Spotify and Amazon are taking you to court on March 10.

I figure no more than two months. I gotta tell ya when you hear that thing it's going to blow you away. It's definitely the best sounding Rhodes of all time, not even a close second. The full story will be noted when we release the product. - Jay\n\nJuly, 2019\n\nJAY SHARING SOME THOUGHTS ON MUSIC AND MATH\n\nCats, check out the link below as what is interesting is the math and how our ears are tricked!\n\nMusical Fractals\n\nPass along the above and the following if you like, as I bet there are many stories regarding \"Ghost Notes\" and other strange sonic anomalies!\n\n\"Ghost Notes\" within a mix!\n\nThat got me thinking about another subject as when mixing, no doubt you Cats at some point over the years have heard a strange \"ghost note\" created by harmonics of two or more instruments. The first time I heard this, I set up a locate spot a few beats before the problem as to quickly start the test over and over. I muted an instrumental track. If that did not make the ghost note go away, I un-muted that track and muted another and so on with all possible combinations of muting and soloing tracks until finally finding what caused the ghost note. Then I started moving the level down in 1 dB intervals on one or more of the tracks until getting rid of the ghost note. If no automation, manual moves needed to happen when recording the final mix to the 2-track machine.\n\nWith Pro Tools and the like, much easier to fix with a quick automated downward level ride on one or more of the tracks responsible for the ghost note.\n\nOver the years, I seem to remember this happening 3 times and I seem to remember one ghost note was caused by 3 tracks. Not sure if any ghost notes were caused by the drums as part of the equation.\n\nI wonder if any records were released with the ghost note as part of the mix sounding like a major clam? (g)\n\nObviously with Pro Tools and the like, much easier to fix with a quick automated downward level ride on one or more of the tracks responsible for the ghost note. Also, more options such as changing the pitch very slightly on one of the tracks using Melodyne.\n\nLater Cats, Rake\n\nJune, 2019\n\nIMPORTANT MESSAGES FROM JAY AND GREG MATHIESON!\n\nJay's lifelong friend Greg Mathieson posted this below on his Facebook page on June 19, 2019. It is a very important message, which sadly captures the essence of the music business of today. With Greg's kind permission, we are reposting his Facebook entry here below, but first Jay's comments on this situation:\n\nJay Graydon:\n\nHey all, the following was posted by one of my best friends, Greg Mathieson. His thought as to trying to eliminate free music makes sense when noting something like people will buy a cup of coffee at Starbucks (probably 4 to 7 bucks) but won't pay 99 cents for downloading a song.\n\nThankfully my era was the last in which, songwriters, record producers, and recording artists made a good living as to royalties. My royalties have dropped big time starting when free music became something people expect and think is OK! Spotify is a total joke as let's say a song gets 1 million plays. The total royalty is just under 5,000 that is to be split with the record company, writer, and producer! When the new copyright law came (after near 100 years of no updating), Spotify filed an appeal! If the record companies and artists pulled all of their music from Spotify, they would go from millions to out of business in one day, which they deserve sucking up all of the advertising monies with very little consideration to the people that created and paid for recording the music!\n\nNow to the main point. Why would anyone want to be a musician, etc. in this era as it is next to impossible to make any money is what is left of the music business! I worry about the young generation as such musicians, etc. must have a day gig to survive instead of a shot at being paid what we were paid!\n\nThere is only one way to pull this off, which is they must unite as to stopping people from file sharing and ask they pay for the music as we all did before Napster! It's all up to you so please spread the word to everyone you know! Also, if people stopped using Spotify and the like, those blood sucking vampires would either charge the proper rate to users per play and pay royalties like record companies and ASCAP/BMI pays!\n\n(The musician's union is powerless and hardly any musicians sign up to the union anymore for obvious reasons. The union pension fund many of us old guys paid into, is about to take a huge drop as to our retirement checks! This will really affect the musicians who can no longer get work and can't play anymore. I have good friends that have debilitating medical issues who need their pension monies! If the government steps in to help, they will have total control of how much of a cut will take place and the word on the street is it could be half!)\n\nIt's up to you or things will only get worse!\n\nHow about someone starts a FaceBook conversation as to hopefully go viral. You may want to note stuff like some people think it is OK for them to get music for free as I am just one person. Even worse is people simply expect to get music for free not even thinking that doing so is causing people a huge loss as to income! It's like taking money out of the people's pocket that created the music!\n\nAfter all of that, I know most of you that like my music have bought CD's or album downloads of my recordings and I thank you from the bottom of my heart and I am very proud of you respecting this is what I do for a living!\n\nSo check out what Greg wrote as to this subject along with the bootleg videos of his gigs that people post stealing the music. The story about Vinnie is major proof of how pissed off he is regarding stealing music!\n\nYour musical pal, Jay\n\n***\n\nGreg Mathieson:\n\nI have to get one more thing off my chest. It's a little negative so if you don't want to read it STOP NOW!!!\n\nI know that there was some illegal recording of the gig last week and that's not what bothers me because that gig/party was a one-off. That band might not ever happen again. Or, maybe it will happen in in 10 years for the 60th B-Party.\n\nThe one that really hurt and effected my life was the the illegal recording of the band with me, Vinnie, Landau and Abraham Sr. You see we had planned to do our own videos so we could make some money. The music world has been turned upside down now. Everybody thinks that music should be free. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? My royalties and publishing checks have gone down by 90%. Big bummer. (Now, I'm cool because I lived through the golden days of sessions, but I worry about the next generation of musicians). File sharing and protools has made it so there is no real session work anymore. Everyone is sitting in a room by themselves making records. I hardly ever do a recording session with live players in a studio with all the cats there in the same room. I THINK WE'RE LOSING SOMETHING! (I have a plan about this but I'll tell you about that next month when I'm ready).\n\nSo ... some cat comes into the club and illegally records the Vinnie band right behind Vinnie and posts it all over you tube. Vinnie hits the roof!!!!!\n\nLong story short ... Vinnie will never ever! ... do you understand the words \"never ever\" ... play with me at the Baked Potato again! This cat ruined the band! The band brakes up. The band will never play again! THAT'S A DAMM SHAME!!! I miss that bandâ¦â¦..DAMM!!!!!!\n\nSo you, Yea you!! ... you know who you are. Are you happy that you broke the band up? Did you ever consider the consequences of your actions? This is BS and I'm bummed and I miss that band.\n\nNow to my Facebook friends. I know that you probably give to a charity or to your church or maybe help out out a friend. Next time you down load a song for free ... instead think about your local musicians. Go to iTunes and pay $.99 or $1.99 and support your local musicians. You pay way more than that at Starbucks!\n\nGROOVE HARD\n\nGREG\n\nTHE RIVERA RAKE HEAD SOON SOLD OUT!\n\nHey everyone,\n\nYou people probably know Rivera makes a signature amp called the Rake Head. There are enough panels, circuit boards, and key parts to build around 7 more and that will be it forever! Check it out here!\n\nIn the era of amp modelers the amp market has almost over, which is sad as molders will never sound as good as an amp and takes the fun away since they don't have the punch and sweet warm mid range tone. The Rake Head was designed to allow the high E string not \"thin out\" when playing up high on the neck as the amp can be loaded with sweet mids obviously the mid range control! The Focus pot is so very cool as the more you add, the sound gets bigger when needed! The clean channel is sweet with more highs (for rhythm) AND you can also use this channel for sweet distortion as well adding in the Ninga Boost!\n\nWhen I played a few gigs at the Baked Potato a while back, my very good friend Dan Sawyer was there. Dan is an outstanding guitarist and he was doing studio work in the same era when I was doing session work. I love Dan's tone as he likes the sweet mids!\n\nAfter the gig, Dan e-mailed me stating the following. \"I have heard Larry Carlton, Luke, Landau, and the rest of the outstanding guitarists at the Spud (the nickname for the Baked Potato) and your tone is the best I have ever heard!\" I thanked him big time and simply noted when Paul Rivera and I were designing the amp (we would test different circuits and tone circuits) that led to the final Rake head design so you should be telling this to Paul Rivera. (g)\n\nWhen I power up the amp and play through it, it makes me want to play! In the past, when playing through other amps, they were OK but since the Rake Head tone is perfect for me, I play better for sure as things become effortless as I am never fighting with the amp (you get the drift).\n\nThe bottom line with the story is if you like my tone, it would be a good idea to buy one before it is over!\n\nYour musical Bro, Jay\n\nMay, 2019\n\nPAST TO PRESENT - THE 70s - REMASTERED!\n\nI just remastered Past to Present - the 70s and as usual, the incredible Fab Filter plugins and some others as well allow so much flexibility! This album is interesting as it is an adventure through my history leading up to the point of before becoming a 1st call studio guitarist up to the point when I made the move to producing and writing. - Jay\n\nRead the full story about the making of the album on this page.\n\nHere is a video featuring Jay performing one of the songs\n\nSHE WAITS FOR ME\n\nin a different version than the one on the original AIRPLAY album.\n\nApril, 2019\n\nBACK IN STOCK!!!\n\nJay Graydon All Stars - 20th Anniversary Edition - 4 DVD Box Set\n\nThe Region Free 4 DVD box set Jay Graydon All Stars - 20th Anniversary Edition is now available at Amazon!

Larry called me noting he was working on a Jarreau tribute album and asked me if I would play the guitar parts on Mornin', which I did. The track is great as expected and the bass player (Chris) in Al's band is an outstanding singer and can sound like Al to the point it's scary!\n\nLarry was Al's musical director for many years and Chris was his bass player and background singer for many years as well. I just played the full album now and was amazed as to how the songs have developed regarding the arrangements over the years! Outstanding musicians as expected.\n\nWell done guys! - Jay\n\nThe album will be released May 17 and is available for pre-order at Chris Walker's website and here below are the tracks and featured artists on the album.\n\nAl Message\n\nMornin' feat.

LEE RITENOUR!\n\nAs you know Jay was one of the guitar judges in Lee Ritenour's Six String Theory Competition 2018 and recently Rit hosted a great evening of music presenting the winners of his 2018 Six String Theory Music Competition at the Catalina Jazz Club in Hollywood.\n\nIt was an awesome night and Lee Ritenour was jamming with the winners - some incredible young talent from around the world! Jazz, Blues, Rock, Classical.... they covered it all!\n\nCheck out the winners list 2018 on Lee Ritenour's Six String Theory website.\n\nJay's comments on the gig:\n\nRit, Wes Ritenour on drums, the main bass player and keyboard player are contest winners (I think) and with Wes, they played with all the other guitarists, which all were outstanding! The winners are noted on the site for 6 string theory.\n\nThe classical guitarist winner is a chick who is unbelievable!!!!\n\nGuitarists of my era that were there - Mitch Holder, Tim May, Thom Rotella, Pat Kelly. Me, Luke and Steve Vai sat together with our chicks (or wives). My voice over 1st call pal Scott Rummel sat with us as well. I got Bill Evans in but did not see him as too much was going on and just until the gig started, I was in the band room meeting the winners and hanging out with Rit, Luke, and Vai.\n\nEveryone played great and good to see my pals Rit, Luke, Steve Vai, Tim May, Mitch Holder, and Thom Rotella. Foz was there with Chris Botti, but I did not know until the next day when he called me. He saw me split with Scott and DML (about 15 minutes before the gig was over) and unfortunately I did not see him in the crowd. The gig was fun!\n\nHere below a few pics from the gig.

After having major tech problems this fall I am back to mixing the JaR 2 songs, as well as working on other projects. Most recently I have been playing on a Jarreau tribute album for Larry Williams that will come out next year. Further, we are getting close as to finishing mode of the first release of the \"Famous E Piano\" sample program.\n\nAs you may know I also produced, mixed and mastered the solo album by Phil deGruy. Check it out at Phil's Website\n\nI did an interview with Tim Pierce a few weeks ago, which was filmed and in it I am teaching him how to play the PEG solo. If you are interested, you can watch it on his YouTube channel.\n\nTo get you into the holiday mood you may want to listen to my Dad singing his own Christmas song, which I recorded with him in a pop style - Jay and Joe Graydon - On This Christmas Eve\n\nIf you are interested in some more music for your Christmas gifts, you will find a few suggestions on my ... Christmas page\n\nSee you all next year with hopefully the NEW JaR album finally being released and also a few other projects waiting in the wings ... - Jay\n\nOctober, 2018\n\n\"The Mutual Admiration Society\" for Your Grammy Consideration!\n\nAs many of you already know, Jay Graydon is a featured guitar player on the track \"Strip Mall Gourmet\" of this album below - The Mutual Admiration Society.\n\n\"For Your Grammy Consideration: The Mutual Admiration Society, an album from Sterling Ball, @jim cox, and @john ferraro. Featuring some of the world's greatest guitarists including @steve vai, @john petrucci, @steve lukather, @steve morse, @albert lee and Jay Graydon. #grammys #FYC\"\n\nSeptember, 2018\n\nAirplay remastering 2018 with 3 extra bonus tracks!\n\nUpon request from Sony International, Japan, Jay did this remastering of the AIRPLAY album (released in July 2018) involving several new techniques to enhance and perfect the sonics of the album. It is available as a SACD and as a blue vinyl from various places, among them, these below ...\n\nSony Music Japan\n\nAmazon in blue vinyl\n\nAmazon as a Limited Mini Sleeve w. Bonus Track\n\nCDBANQ\n\nAll data on the songs, releasing label and cat.# is noted in Jay's discography.\n\nHere are a few notes from Jay on how he worked with the remaster this time around.\n\nHi all of you who like the Airplay album or may have not heard this album, most of you know I have remastered the album a few times over the years. Each time I did so, there was always better electronic tools or Pro Tools plug-ins to use. For this current mastering, I spent 12 weeks as I wanted to reshape the whole sonic concept! In the late 70's and first half of the 80's, recordings had more upper midrange than they do now. One reason Airplay had a lot of upper mids (around 2k to 3k) was David and I thought we had over-produced the album as we had so many guitar and synth parts! The way to get a crowded album to have all parts heard is to add the mentioned frequency on many instruments and vocals.\n\nWith the great Pro Tools 3rd party plug-ins such as the FabFilter EQ and Multi-band compressor (and many more plugs), I was able to totally reshape the sonics! I moved the 2 to 3k feature by having the FabFilter multi-band compressor set to tame the 2 to 3k, I used the FF EQ to do the same when needed automating all of the plug-ins as needed to get the sound I was looking for!\n\nMany of the songs needed more bass since in when using vinyl records, the bass creates a wider groove in the record and if the attack is real punchy, (the same for the bass drum), the \"spike\" could easily make the needle jump out of the groove! With digital audio, that problem does not exist!\n\nLet's back up for a moment. Around 7 months ago, Sony and I thought it would be a good idea to remaster. I think this is the first remastering that used the original 2-track tape instead of a tape copy since when pressing records in other countries, tape copies were made and sent to each country that would release the product.\n\nThe original tapes are at Sony (I think in New York) and Sony Japan asked the tape be transferred to digital at 192k-24 bit, which occurred!\n\nWhen I received the digital files, I was asked to re-master in 4 separate formats, which are ...\n\n24bit / 96 kHz master as WAV file (including the 3 bonus tracks) for SACD portion of SACD/Hybrid release\n\n16bit / 44.1 kHz master as one DDP file (including the 3 bonus tracks) for CD portion of SACD/Hybrid release\n\n24bit / 96 kHz master as WAV file (WITHOUT the bonus tracks) for Side A (Track# 1-5) for Vinyl LP release\n\n24bit / 96 kHz master as WAV file (WITHOUT the bonus tracks) for Side B (Track# 6-10) for Vinyl LP release\n\nAfter experimenting with a few songs, I realized Stranded (the 1st song) vocal level would be too low after adding the plug-ins for the total reshaping. One of my best friends is Bill Evans who is a total genius! As part of his PhD research, he created a new type of audio editing program called Belexes that uses augmented reality to explore and edit sounds in three dimensions.\n\nEvery waveform you can see in a DAW such as Pro Tools can be broken down into millions of individual sine waves. Once this is done, sound can be edited in three separate dimensions: frequency, time, and amplitude. He now works on a commercial version, invented by his partner Robin Lobel, which runs in two dimensions on ordinary computers. It's called SpectraLayers, and includes a feature they added for my own work.\n\nSo back to Stranded. Since I needed the vocal to be as much 5 dB louder than it was, I asked Bill if he could remove the vocal from the instruments and send me both tracks. Actually to do this as good as possible, since there are vocal parts that overlap each other, There are 3 vocal tracks and an instruments track (all are obviously stereo tracks).\n\nWorking with SpectraLayers and Steve Oliver at Audioamix (TRAX), Tom (Bill's co-engineer) and Bill separated the three vocals to separate tracks.\n\nHere's the audio of a section of the song before separating the vocals, then a version with just the vocals, and then the full track with the instruments put back together with the new boosted level riding.\n\nYou are going to hear some of this sound kind of robotic and other little anomalies BUT when I tweaked the EQ and more, and then mixed back together to one stereo track, almost impossible to notice the vocals were ever removed and added back!!!! - Jay\n\nAUDIO SAMPLES - Before And After Enhancement\n\nOriginal full track before the fix\n\nTrack of just the vocals\n\nTrack with vocals removed\n\nFull track after putting back the vocals\n\nJAY EXPLAINING THE PEG SOLO TO TIM PIERCE!\n\nA few weeks ago Jay's very good friend and an excellent guitar player, Tim Pierce, visited Jay in the studio for an interview on how to to play the iconic PEG solo, as well as chatting about the gear being used and the recording session with Donald Fagen and Walter Becker of the Steely Dan.\n\nTim is now sharing the video from the event with all of you in his YouTube channel.\n\nA comment from Jay regarding this event:\n\nNear the end of the video, I did not know Tim was going to use live guitar audio along with my recorded track of the solo. If I knew Tim was going to use my \"jam along\" audio with the track, I would have tuned up and played a few passes to make sure to get it in tune so please forgive the fact the pitch is not good.\n\nAlso, the solo is a remake of the original as I have used it a few times in films and TV interviews. Since it costs big bucks to get a synch license from Warner Bros to use the original, I hired my very close friend, Jay Oliver (excellent keyboardist and composer), who is also outstanding as to re-creating sounds with samplers. etc. Unless the listener pays close attention, you might think this is the original Steely version!\n\nAugust, 2018\n\nJaR 2 AND NEVE 2!\n\nMessage from Jay:\n\nHey all, Jay Graydon here, after many months working with the re-masters for Japan of AIRPLAY and AIRPLAY FOR THE PLANET, plus mixing, mastering and co-producing, the new album by Phil deGruy, I finally resumed working on the JaR 2 mixes. Guess what happens next ...?\n\nTwo Caps exploded on my Neve V2 (the insert card power rail cap on channels 18&20) and the smoke rising up from the console scared the shit out of me! It sounded like 10 firecrackers and happened twice within 5 minutes of each other! All of those Caps on every module will need to be replaced asap as too old and they suck major current! More will blow up soon if not replaced!\n\nSoon every cap on the console Neve V2-48) will need to be replaced as they fail! There are around 100 per module. This will be the 6th time a full re-capping will happen in over 30 years! A new console would cost 500,000 bucks and for the first six months, there would be problems so that idea is not practical, especially the price!\n\nAs soon as I get problems fixed in the studio I start the mixes. I hope no more than a week from Monday as my tech Dave Clark will work this Monday and next Monday as there are always a few problems. I am now heading into the control room to write out notes for Dave as to failed modules, etc. This issue is major! Shit like this happens all the time with big consoles. The more modules, the more the problems build up. Dave is the main Neve tech at Capitol and he is constantly working on 3 Neves!\n\nThe trade off of using an analog console with Pro Tools is worth the hassle as the Neve V2 is the last console with the old style Neve EQ that sounds great!\n\nSo hang in there, folks, JaR 2 is on the way! - Jay\n\nApril, 2018\n\nJAY JUDGING IN RIT'S SIX STRING THEORY COMPETITION!\n\nOnce again Jay is one of the guitar judges in Lee Ritenour's Six String Theory Competition, You are welcome to participate in one of the categories - GUITAR, PIANO, BASS or DRUMS. The registration is open until May 31, 2018. Here is a video with Rit talking about the contest.\n\nMarch, 2018\n\nBUSY NIGHTS IN THE STUDIO!\n\nIt may seem very quiet around here, but the truth is Jay is working hard in the studio, and barely has time to come up for air. Here he is with a brief message to you all.\n\nHey all, Jay Graydon here. Long time since I posted anything, but I am slammed with work in the studio and not much time for anything else. Just a few brief notes as to what is happening ...\n\nThe Japan gig with Foz is postponed due to scheduling problems.\n\nSo, right now I am\n\nremastering the AIRPLAY album for Japan\n\nmastering an album for Phil DeGruy\n\nworking on finishing the famous E-Rhodes sample program - probably 3 months before release\n\nmixing the Jar 2 album\n\nI will also be a judge in Lee Ritenour's Six String Theory competition\n\nDecember, 2017\n\nMARRIAGE BETWEEN RIVERA RAKE HEAD AMP AND LINE 6 HELIX USED FOR EFFECTS!\n\nJay notes:\n\nIn the video you just watched or about to watch regarding the marriage of Analog Amplification (my signature Rake Head amp & speaker bottom) and digital (Line 6 Helix I mostly use for a replacement of stomp box effects), I forgot to mention the issue of latency (delay) of digital, obviously the less latency the better.\n\nBefore I get into full detail, note that sound travels at approximently1 millisecond per foot. If you are 10 feet away from an analog amp, the sound is delayed to your ears by 10 milliseconds when playing your instrument. We have gotten used to such delay.\n\nThe Helix is a digital processor that must use digital to analog and analog to digital converters. The Helix converters induce just 1.1 milliseconds so no big deal. You may think since stomp boxes are analog so no extra delay is in play BUT in this era, many stomp boxes that used to be analog or many new stomp boxes are digital, leading to the fact each digital stomp box induces at least 1.1 milliseconds and maybe more! Further, the converters will typically not be high quality converts that hurt the sound!\n\nThe bottom line as to latency is the latency could add a lot of delay!\n\nOne more issue to address is noise caused by stomp boxes as well as cables and connectors that dull up the sound. Without getting too technical, impedance loading is in play and more!\n\nWESTCOAST MUSIC MAGAZINE READER'S AWARD!\n\n\"Congratulations to Jay Graydon from all the readers of 'West Coast' Music Magazine who voted \"Airplay For The Planet\" the Best Reissued Album in our 2017 Award Winners Poll. We are delighted to see this particular album reissued as it is a real favourite amongst west coast music lovers and we are equally looking forward to hearing new material from Jay in 2018 too.\" - Nick Mawson (Editor)\n\n-----------\n\nHey all, Jay Graydon here.\n\nI just found out about the great news as to Airplay For The Planet has won the Readers Award for \"Best Reissued Album Of The Year\" in the West Coast Music Magazine!\n\nWow, what an honor! I thank all of you who voted and again, I am truly honored! If you are interested, this reissue of Airplay for the Planet is available through my website.\n\nI am once again reminded that even though the business part of the music business can be a drag, the bottom line in my job is to make people happy through my music!\n\nSome of you may have seen the movie, Hired Gun. The studio musician sections were short and early touched on, which is good as before the timing of that movie, for a few years, I had been thinking and writing an outline for a documentary of the 1st call studio musicians, background singers, etc. from the 70's through the late 80's  that was the last era of musical songs where players had to be the best of the best! Other than the interviews with all the great musicians, singers, etc. there will be interviews with the artists that were/are stars as to the importance of the studio musicians/singers. Now for the best part! We will record songs from the era the same way we did before Pro Tools help! The viewing audience will be in the control room and studio hearing and watching everything that happens in such sessions! There will be humor for sure and stories only we know!\n\nAlso, when you read this, I will finally be mixing the JaR album Code! The odds are good the album will be released by spring.\n\nFurther, I have been working on a book for years writing out stories as I think of them. Hopefully that will get released sometime next year.\n\nThanks again for the huge honor!\n\nYour musical pal, Jay\n\nSUPERIOR DRUMMER 3!\n\nNew message from Jay;\n\nHey all, I have been a beta tester for Toontrack since the first Superior Drummer program came out. I just set up Superior 3 and I must tell you this is by far the best sounding and flexible drum program ever! The midi is perfectly accurate and no inverted phase issues. I am extremely impressed!!!! Check out the program as I think youll love it!\n\nSuperior Drummer 3 at Toontrack\n\nNovember, 2017\n\nLATEST ON THE E-RHODES SAMPLING PROJECT!\n\nNew message from Jay;\n\nIf you did not know, George (the owner of the famous E Rhodes) and I have been working on sampling the one and only \"E\" for nearly 2 years. The full story will be noted when we release the product, which will be as soon as possible. We are in negotiations as to the deal and as soon as that gets wrapped up, we will release for sale!\n\nGeorge and I have listened to every sampled Rhodes we know of. None stand up to the \"E\". Spectrasonics released a video for their program, Keyscapes. They claim to have sampled the famous \"E\", which is not true! We contacted the company and asked they stop advertising their Rhodes as the \"E\" but I think the video still exists. No matter as again, the \"E\" will be released very soon!\n\nWe sampled at 96k 24 bit and will render down to 88.2, 48, and 44.1 so if using other than 96k, there will be no real time rendering down, which helps save DSP power. We did not do any looping as each sample sustains in full!\n\nWe are perfectionists so we did not take any shortcuts! Again, the full story when released.\n\nIt is fact that any program is only as good as the weakest link in the audio chain - in this case, there is no weak link! Most importantly is the sound source (the instrument sampled)! I have heard/played at least 100 Fender Rhodes over the years and there is no doubt the \"E\" is the best ever!\n\nListen to the Al Jarreau - JARREAU - album if you want to hear the sound.\n\nNo need to take my word as the person that has heard more Fender Rhodes than anyone is the designer, Harold Rhodes! Over the years Harold was told by many people he should hear the famous \"E\" so he drove to George's home to listen to it. Harold said it is the best Rhodes he had ever heard!\n\nB3PIO LIVE AND CHRISTMAS TIPS!\n\nAs previously announced, the next live gig with B3PIO (Jay Graydon, Greg Mathieson, Raplh Humphrey, Jerry Watts, Jr.) will be on November 9 at the Baked Potato! Hope to be seeing you there!\n\n\"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, everywhere you go\" .... and here are our recommendations for a wonderful holiday season with the best music you can get your hands on.\n\nOctober, 2017\n\nTHE B3PIO BAND HAS ITS OWN FACEBOOK PAGE!\n\nWe have now set up a Facebook page for the B3PIO band which will note all about the band, like the latest news, bios, and pics. Later on maybe videos and merch as well. There you will also find upcoming gig dates and info on how to book tickets. Since the shows often sell out, best to go to the Baked Potato site and buy tickets in advance. There are two sets and if the 2nd set does not sell out, you can stay for the 2nd set, but to make sure you hear both sets, it would be a good move to buy tickets for both.\n\nJAY GRAYDON AND HIRED GUN!\n\nHere below a link to a brief video clip with Jay talking about his PEG solo on the Steely Dan album AJA. This clip is taken from the highly acclaimed documentary HIRED GUN, by director/producer Fran Strine.\n\nJay Graydon VIDEO CLIP from HIRED GUN!

The venue is small so best get tickets in advance!\"\n\nCODE OFFICIAL VIDEO!\n\nA message from Jay:\n\n\"Hey all, I know so many of you are waiting for the new JaR album, and as you know I am working on the final mixes at this point, BUT there are soooooo many other things to do at the same time, like doing endorsement videos, teaching my fellow guitarists how to play the solos on a few AIRPLAY songs for the gig at Budokan with Foz November 28, doing interviews, phone calls, emails, writing new songs, working on my autobiography ... etc. etc. ... You get the drift.\n\nHaving said that, we will give you a little teaser of the new JaR album - a cool video based on the title song CODE, recently filmed by Bennett Ryle, who did an excellent job!!! Hope you enjoy it!!!!\"\n\nWALTER BECKER PASSING!\n\n\"So very sad to hear Walter passed away as Steely Dan has helped keep quality music alive in a huge way! Donald says he will keep SD going, which is great!\" - Jay\n\nAs most of you know Jay played the legendary solo on the Steely Dan song \"PEG\", where he, as the 7th or 8th soloist was the one who nailed it. Donald and Walter are discussing the making of PEG in this video.\n\nAIRPLAY FOR THE PLANET REMASTER AVAILABLE AGAIN!\n\n\"Ooops, the 96k remastered CD of AIRPLAY FOR THE PLANET sold out quickly, BUT we have now pressed up a new batch, so not a problem any longer.

I am working on setting up a seminar the day before (probably at a Yamaha center) which will include tickets for the gig (good VIP seats), Meet and Greet with me, everyone can ask me questions, and the chance of coming to a rehearsal or sound check. I will probably have a bunch of hand burned 1st generation CD's of mine to sign for everyone. It may be limited to around 100 people but could be more. I will note details as things unfold.\"\n\nMORE PICS FROM THE SPUD GIG!\n\nHere are a few more pics from the Spud gig on August 10.

If so, we will of course keep you posted here on the site, so stay tuned music lovers!\n\n(To see a larger image, just click on the pic.)\n\nJAY GRAYDON PLAYING LIVE AT THE BAKED POTATO!\n\nHere's a quick story as to the history of the band.\n\nGreg and I met in college and quickly became very good friends and worked so many gigs together for a few years and when not working, we jammed often. We jammed with a few different drummers and bass players. Ralph was one of those drummers as I worked with Ralph in the Don Ellis band for a few years.\n\nI remember when Greg first brought a chart for his composition entitled, LMNOP. That was probably 45 years ago! That was the beginning of Greg's band so to speak.\n\nDan Sawyer (outstanding studio guitarist if you did not know that) was the next guitarist in the band. Then I introduced Greg to Carlton and Carlton was next. After a while, Steve Lukather was the next outstanding guitarist in the band, and then Mike Landau (obviously another outstanding guitarist). So at this point, obviously I am now the guitarist after nearly 50 years ago! As to drummers, I can't remember who was first when Greg became serious as to the band but Jeff Porcaro soon became the drummer in the band. After that I think Abe Laboriel Jr. was next and then Vinnie. So similar to me, Ralph is back in the band! Very ironic the three of us are playing together again!\n\nAbe Laboriel Sr. was the bassist in the band around the time Jeff Porcaro was in the band but no longer as Jerry Watts in now the bassist. I met him last night on the gig and he is an outstanding bassist and a great person!\n\nNow that I feel my playing is getting back to what it should be, I want to play more often so once again I am available for hire to play solos and guitar parts via files sent to me.\n\nIn any case, I am really digging playing guitar often these days!\n\nJuly, 2017\n\nHIRED GUN DOCUMENTARY ON DVD!\n\nThe HIRED GUN documentary will now be released on DVD, Blu-ray and VOD - available August 1!\n\nIf you missed your opportunity to see this film last month, follow one of these links to pre-order your copy at Amazon or Barnes and Noble.\n\nYou can check out pictures and video clips from the movie on Facebook and on the documentary website as well!\n\nApril, 2017\n\nRAKE HEAD REISSUE!\n\nRivera is reissuing the Rake Head May 2017! This is the Jay Graydon signature tone machine that was originally released almost 20 years ago! Only 25 will be made!\n\nFrom the Rivera website ...\n\nThe Jay Graydon Signature Rake Head is back! Resurrected for an ultra limited run. We're building only 25 pieces and then they're gone. You want the Steely Dan tone and more, this amp is for you! And, don't think this amp is only a late 70's early 80's king of tones. The Rake is also known for it's ultra smooth high-gain with thick-mids sonic signature.

I remember the first meeting I had with Tommy and David Foster in the late 70's. I think David and I were asking for a record deal. Tommy passed on the deal as we were not really ready for such a deal, but that was good in the long run as David and I fell into the RCA AIRPLAY deal by accident.\n\nWhen Tommy was doing A&R at Warners, it was Tommy's idea to hire me as to co-write and produce songs for the George Benson Collection album, which lead me to co-writing and producing TURN YOUR LOVE AROUD! I really owed Tommy big time for thinking I was the right producer/co-writer for the huge #1 hit!\n\nAs for Tommy as a producer, I don't think he was a musician and most of the time, such producers do not have a clue on the musical end BUT he had a sense to what worked well or not and was so easy to get along with regarding producing the artist. I bet every artist that Tommy produced was always pleased with the process! That is a huge compliment! Over many years Tommy and I ran into each other almost once a week in a restaurant we really like and always had a great time talking about most everything. We had many laughs and got along so very well!\n\nI will miss Tommy so very much! So sad he is gone as he will be missed by so many friends! Rest in peace Bro!\n\nFebruary, 2017\n\nAL JARREAU PASSING!\n\nA message from Jay:\n\nHi All,\n\nNeedless to say I have been receiving tons of e-mails and posts on Facebook regarding the passing of Alwin Jarreau and I do thank all of you for your kind messages and for offering your condolences.\n\nAl will surely be missed by all! Al was a good person and no need to mention a extremely talented singer!\n\nSome of the best stuff I have produced and co-written songs for was the five albums with Al!\n\nI had spoken with Al less than a year ago as to get together regarding some unfinished business as well as ideas I had for his live gigs. We tried to schedule a meeting but sadly the time frame did not work out. It was on my to-do list and I was going to call him this week!\n\nDuring our conversation on the phone, we were laughing about some stories and the conversation was very good!\n\nI have been working on an autobiography for years writing down stories as they come to mind and there will be so many stories as to recording sessions, etc.\n\nIf there is any good news at this point, there are many songs we recorded that were not released along with alternate takes. This music needs to be heard so I will contact Warner Bros and Rhino noting I am the only person who knows the information as to put together the audio for all to hear.\n\nIn closing, Al had a great life and made so many people happy as to his records and concerts!\n\nRest in Peace Alwin. - Jay Graydon\n\nFebruary, 2017\n\nAIRPLAY FOR THE PLANET - Remastered at 96k - Thanks!\n\nA message from Jay:\n\nThanks to all of you for purchasing the 96k version of the AIRPLAY FOR THE PLANET album on my Bandcamp page and thanks also for all of your great and appreciative comments on this enhanced remaster! I really worked hard on making it sound as great as possible and I am very happy with the result.\n\nRight now I am denoising, tweaking, and mixing audio for my very close friend, Phil DeGruy, who is an outstanding solo guitarist in chord melody land! He plays a 17 string guitar and if you have never heard his stuff, go to his website as to check it out.\n\nWhen done with that project, the next move is to truncate the samples for the incredible \"E\" Rhodes used on so many recording sessions as the owner George Mamalakis and I partnered up to do the sample library. We are both perfectionists so for the past year the \"E\" has been tweaked to sound better than ever! George is sampling every note. We will have 19 velocities for each note and no looping meaning the notes sustain until they are silent! George should elaborate as to this. After truncating all notes, we will work out a deal with a major software company as to release for sale.\n\nThe next move will be to finally finish the JaR mixes. BTW we have also updated the sessions page on my website with tons of information on recording sessions over the years, with all of the musicians involved and you will surely have fun checking that out!\n\nJanuary, 2017\n\nScreening of HIRED GUN!\n\nHey all, here is a short message regarding a film, that I am featured in. It is called HIRED GUN and is about studio musicians.\n\nJoin director Fran Strine and cast member Ray Parker Jr for a screening of Hired Gun. Jay Graydon is featured in the film and shares really funny stories on the George Benson hit \"Turn Your Love Around\" with Steve Lukather as well as Jays legendary guitar solo in Steely Dans \"Peg\"\n\nPortland, OR, on Jan. 28 screening of HIRED GUN.\n\nJanuary, 2017\n\nAIRPLAY FOR THE PLANET - Remastered at 96k!\n\nQuestion:\n\nHi Jay, Downloaded the 96k. Great job! Silky mids and lows, fab eq. Was this entirely in the box or was it via your Neve? A credit to you!\n\n---\n\nThanks for the kind words! I am now remembering the full story. All but 2 songs (maybe 3) were recorded analog 48 track (two MCI (modified) 24 track machines linked via time code). The other two songs were recorded via ADAT (a total of 48 tracks).\n\nAll songs were mixed through the NEVE 2- 48 (this is the last NEVE manufactured with the very musical warm EQ). SHE JUST CAN'T MAKE UP HER MIND ended up being a rough mix through the NEVE to a DAT 2 track recorder.\n\nOther than SHE JUST CAN'T MAKE UP HER MIND (recorded to a DAT recorder) all other songs were recorded to an Ampex ATR 102 (1/2\" tape) analog recorder.\n\nAs mentioned, I transferred the analog 2 track master to Pro Tools at 44.1k and 96k 24 bit.\n\nSo none of the songs were mixed in the box! I never mix in the box always using the Neve!\n\n---\n\nAs always Jay you are a mine of wonderful information.\n\nAIRPLAY FOR THE PLANET - Remastered at 96k!\n\nAIRPLAY FOR THE PLANET has been selling well and we are running out of stock so when almost out of stock, CD BABY requests more. That opened a can of worms since the program Kerstin used for the original artwork is out of date so she needed to start over using a new program. Since she needed to redo the artwork, I thought it would be a good idea to re-master the audio.\n\nSo I have remastered the album at 96k (more about that work below) and we have set up a Bandcamp page for Jay Graydon - AIRPLAY FOR THE PLANET - Remastered at 96k. Welcome to check it out!\n\nWhen I first set up Pro Tools about 14 years ago I wanted to transfer all analog tapes to Pro Tools as to preserve. The problem with old analog tapes is they won't play as they become sticky as the chemicals used to make tape are part petroleum based. The solution is to have the tapes baked! At that point the tapes will play for about a month. I found all of the analog tapes I could find so after having the tapes baked, I transferred everything into Pro Tools at that time.\n\nI typically recorded the transfers at 44.1k but in some cases, I also recorded at 96k. I asked Kerstin to find out if any company allows 96k audio files to be sold. One of her sons (Stefan) mentioned he uses BANDCAMP for his State Cows albums as they allow 96k files to download!\n\nI thought the re-mastering gig would take a few days BUT it ended up taking 6 weeks, since I am a perfectionist. The concept was to \"sculpt\" the mastering by automating EQ to make sound as good as possible. I did my best to make the bass sound more \"even\" as well as bringing up the vocal level on a few songs via EQ, adding some sweet high end frequencies to \"open up\" some meaning to give it air. Some guitar solos and lines had a bit too much in the 2.5k area so I rode EQ in those spots.\n\nKeep in mind most of the songs were recorded on analogue 2\" Scotch 996 tape (at 30 ips), which is the best sounding analog tape ever manufactured! The mixes were recorded on 1/2\" Scotch 996 tape (at 30 ips),\n\nBack to the re-mastering, I am just scratching the surface as to describing all of the automated EQ moves I did BUT I must say it was worth the hassle as the album sounds delicious! - Jay\n\nDecember, 2016\n\nJAY GRAYDON - CROONER SONGS!\n\n\"My very good friend Tim Hosman writes many songs for library companies that place the songs on films, TV shows, jingles, etc. Tim was asked by one of the companies he writes for to do 4 songs in the Sinatra, Ella, etc. style. Tim knows that style is so easy for me to write so I composed the melody/chord changes and Tim wrote great lyrics! Tim hired a good friend of ours (George Stone) to arrange for big band and strings. There are small group versions (trio) as well.\n\nTim had little time to record the stuff but it sounds great! The male singer on the songs is Rick Riso. I produced the vocal on one song - I Fell In Love Today AKA My Heart Skipped A Beat with Kate Reid - and she is a great singer!\n\nSince the tunes are being used by a library company for placements in films, TV shows etc. they all have 2 titles each as follows ...\n\nSwinging For The Fences AKA Swinging For Love\n\nI Fell In Love Today AKA My Heart Skipped A Beat\n\nHey Cupid AKA Cupid's Crooner\n\nAutumn Breeze AKA My Heartstrings\n\nWe had just composed the songs and shortly after that is when I broke my right elbow in half! Ouch! If that had not happened, I may have been more involved as to the production and would have played guitar on the songs in the Freddie Green style (I love to play that style).\n\nThe songs have been used in several TV shows, such as PARENTHOOD (Cupid's Crooner), REVENGE (Cupid's Crooner; Swinging For Love; My Heartstrings Trio), ARROW (My Heartstrings Trio), GRACELAND (Swinging For Love Trio), MAGIC CITY (Swinging For Love; My Heartstrings), RAY DONOVAN (Swinging For Love), HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER (Cupids Crooner), AMERICAN HOUSEWIFE (My Heartstrings), and many more. Some of the songs have been used in movies as well.\n\nThe songs are released on a compilation album called - Timeless Vocals: The Golden Years - and the tracks can be downloaded at iTunes. The track numbers for our songs are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10.\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy the songs, arrangements, etc.\" - Jay\n\nNovember, 2016\n\nAUDIO PLAYERS THAT CAN PLAY 96k?\n\nI have 96k files of Jay Graydon - AIRPLAY FOR THE PLANET. Note this album was mixed on Scotch 996 (the best analogue tape ever manufactured) and when transferring to Pro Tools to master, I recorded 44.1k files and 96k files JUST IN CASE THERE WOULD BE FUTURE AUDIO PLAYERS THAT CAN PLAY 96k.\n\nDo any of you know of such a player? Since 96k files with 11 tracks won't fit on a CD, I have no idea to the format to use. Maybe DVD's?\n\nPlease drop me a line via my personal assistant Kerstin or comment on my Facebook page since if you know about the options, if there is enough demand, I would gladly do the work to get the 96k audio files available. - Jay\n\nNEWS FLASH!\n\nHey all, for all of you interested in the beautiful sound of the famous legendary \"E\" Rhodes piano ... have we got news for you!!! Jay Graydon and George Mamalakis, who owns this \"Holy Grail\" piano are working together on a project, which will knock your socks off!!! Just read on, quality music lovers ...\n\nSeptember 16, 2016\n\nTHE LEGENDARY \"E\" RHODES SAMPLING PROJECT!\n\nEric and I go back many years. I wrote to him directly regarding his claim about sampling the actual \"E\"\" Rhodes and I had no doubt that he would willingly change the wording and video information as to his new program, Keyscape, noting the Rhodes samples are not from the famous \"E\", but instead from another Leeds Rhodes that Eddy Reynolds modified.\n\nNote, we are all friends here and we surely support all of Eric's plugs as all are great! No doubt Keyscape will be an outstanding program (I am very interested in experimenting with the Yamaha C7 he sampled!). Eric was also very kind as to offer an NFR of Keyscape for both George and me. Of course we will give Eric an NFR when our program is ready for release.\n\nIn my e-mail to Eric I noted my personal experience as to all of Leeds Rhodes stating the following:\n\n\"Please note when David Foster told me about the \"E\", from then on we used it on many sessions as you know, the Eddy mod happened later and I noticed the mod improved the sound around 10%.\n\nI had also heard all of the other Leeds Rhodes on sessions (before and after the Eddy mod) in which I was booked to play guitar. When going into the control room listening to the first playback, I would pay attention to the Rhodes sound in order to find out if any other of Leeds Rhodes modified by Eddy were better. I was hoping to hear one that was as good or close to as good as the \"E\" for my production work since after I spread the word about the \"E\", booking it could take a month or more, so the sessions were booked around the availability. Man, I must say none were even close to the \"E\"!\n\nI think my own personal (stage model) Rhodes was manufactured around 1973 (maybe a 72) but no matter, as it was average at best. I hired Eddy to mod my Rhodes (soon after the discovery of the \"E\") and like I noticed with all of the others, the sound improved only about 10%. After the mod, my Rhodes has been a dust collector, as I never used it again. Its sitting next to my Arp 2600 that has not been powered up for probably 30 years and Im afraid to turn it on. (g)\n\nAnyway, just noting my experience. I must say that until I play your Rhodes samples in my studio on the big monitors, I am wise enough (maybe I should say \"old enough\" ) to reserve judgment!\"\n\nWe will keep everyone informed as to the progress of our exciting sampling project of the famous E RHODES. Meanwhile, we plan to produce some videos that should be of interest  especially to illustrate how the note strikes were struck using a device that George built. He calls it V.E.R.A. (Velocity E Rhodes Actuator) and I am impressed that George designed this incredible mechanism, despite his corny acronym for it! - Jay\n\nSeptember 10, 2016\n\nTHE LEGENDARY \"E\" RHODES SAMPLING PROJECT!\n\nPlease tell all of your friends and websites about the \"E\" program! Spectrasonics has noted misleading information that could destroy the market of the Famous \"E\" Rhodes owned by George!\n\nNote huge attention will be paid as to the chorus since as we know that is extremely important to the sound! Most people do not realize the using a square wave as the modulator is the smoothest way to chorus! If you have an ALESIS QUADRAVERB, one of the chorus modulator options is a square wave! The designer of the QUADRAVERB is Marcus Ryle and is a very close friend. When I was beta testing the unit for him he mentioned to check out the square wave modulator  I was floored as to the smooth modulation!\n\nImportant! Anyone that knows me knows I am a perfectionist. The \"E\" will not have \"looped notes\" meaning every sample will sustain until the audio is at -inf! Every note velocity sample will be sampled + 0.3 dB apart meaning the lowest level hit to the extreme hardest attack are in increments of +0.3 dB from each other! This is almost overkill but we want to make sure every possible level of tone change is covered!\n\nWe are sampling at 96k/24 bit and of course 88.2k, 48k, and 44.1k will be included in the program. Needless to say the files will be huge! There is so much information to write about and George and I will do so in sections so please check back into my website for upcoming details!\n\nSeptember 9, 2016\n\nTHE LEGENDARY \"E\" RHODES SAMPLING PROJECT!\n\nWe would like to congratulate Eric Persing on the launch of his extraordinary new virtual instrument Keyscape, which is featuring probably the largest selection of collector keyboards in the world. However, although Keyscape has a Rhodes sample, in the video, Eric states the Rhodes sampled is the famous legendary \"E\" Rhodes, WHICH IS NOT TRUE!\n\nThere is only one specific \"E\" Rhodes electronic piano, which Harold Rhodes called \"the most beautiful Rhodes I've ever heard!\" - that was the real \"E\" Rhodes, which was used by all the session musicians of the era on e.g. the Jarreau albums and so many others. After discovering the \"E\", since none of the other Leeds Rhodes were even close sounding, I would not use any other Rhodes on a session, period!!!!\n\nThe owner of this piano, George Mamalakis, and I are currently sampling the \"E\" and will be releasing the product probably in January 2017. We will post news about this on our websites, so keep hanging around if you are interested in getting the genuine unique legendary \"E\" Rhodes sound. George and I will note full details as things progress, which will be educational! Feel free to share this info on your own Facebook pages!\n\nCheck out George's website on the \"E\" Rhodes for more info ...\n\nApril, 2016\n\nJAY AT \"HIRED GUN\" PRE-SCREENING!\n\n(To see a larger image, just click on the pic.)\n\nJay Graydon with a few of the musicians, who are featured in the documentary Hired Gun at the pre-screening of the movie at Ray's pad. From right to left, Jay Graydon, Steve Lukather, Ray Parker Jr., David Paich, Sylvester Rivers, Fran Strine (director), David Garfield, and a few others. Jay appears briefly here in the promo trailer at 4:01 - Hired Gun Documentary Sizzle (in association w/ Foolish Kings)\n\nSTORYLINE\n\nHired Gun is a documentary film about session and touring musicians that are hired by well established and famous bands and artists like Metallica, KISS, and Billy Joel. These hired guns may not be household names, but are still masters of their craft. Session Aces. Keepers of Time. Vocalists. Composers. The sidemen and sidewomen who play the riffs and fills we imitate in the air. When we turn up the radio, chances are we are listening to one of these players. A-listers have them on speed dial. International tour or recording session, who're they gonna call? A \"Hired Gun.\" This feature length one-off documentary introduces the prolific musicians who are virtually unknown to the public. Billy Joel, Whitesnake, P!NK and Metallica are synonymous with their own artistry and success, but who is responsible for their instrumental solos? Who tours with them live? It is the consummate side players who kill it show after show, often playing circles around the actual band members. In \"Hired Gun,\" viewers learn the firsthand stories from individuals who have mastered their craft and perform on the world's biggest stages. This film details the highs and lows of touring life, the demands of hectic session schedules, and the dedication required ...\n\nApril, 2016\n\nHIRE JAY TO PLAY ON YOUR PROJECT!\n\nYea, it is really true! Apart from mixing the songs for the new JaR album Jay has now decided he will take on more guitar work for hire from time to time, so if you think you have a suitable project for him to play on ... go for it!\n\n(To see a larger image, just click on the pic.)\n\nPhoto © Kerstin Olofsson. All rights reserved.\n\n\"Lately I have been accepting studio work for guitar parts and solos. I must say I like doing the work as it makes me play guitar more often!\n\nIf anyone is interested as to hiring me for such work, and if I think I am the person to play the guitar parts/solos, please contact me through my website or via my Facebook page.\n\nThe way I work is the producer, artist, or engineer sends me the session audio files. I create a new session in my Pro Tools HD 3 system and import the audio. When I have finished the work I send the guitar audio files. I work alone in my studio as that allows me to work on the song(s) late at night. There are more details to note when needed. - Jay\"\n\nFebruary, 2016\n\nJAY HANGING WITH THE TOTO CATS\n\nLeft to right: Michael McDonald, Jay Graydon, Maureen McGillan Sklar, Steve Lukather, Lee Sklar.
