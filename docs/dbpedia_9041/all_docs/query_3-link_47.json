        "text": "For a nonprofit organization, it doesn’t get much worse than losing your headline performer less than three months before your annual fundraiser.\n\nBut that’s what happened to the Desert Symphony when the legendary jazz vocalist Al Jarreau died Feb. 12 at age 76. For most organizations, that means going to your list of agents and booking an available singer. For Desert Symphony, it meant finding another name vocalist with orchestral charts for its classical musicians. That narrows the field of candidates.\n\nA major focus of the benefit is to present long-time Palm Springs resident Ruta Lee with its Amadeus Award, recognizing her for her philanthropy and career in film and musical theatre. She’s the first woman to receive the Amadeus, following in the footsteps of such local luminaries as Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, Jack Jones, Ted Giatas and last year’s recipient, Harold Matzner.\n\nPAST PERFORMANCE: Desert Symphony's February concert\n\nThe Desert Symphony needed to find a headline act with a broad base of support to stand in front of its musicians at the McCallum Theatre.\n\n“When we heard about the death of Al Jarreau, we were truly saddened,” said Nancy Tapick, Desert Symphony board president. “In the 28 years that the Desert Symphony has been performing, we never confronted the loss of an entertainer. Since this is our one major fundraiser of the year, canceling the concert was not an option. The only thing that we could do was to roll up our shirt sleeves and find a suitable replacement.”\n\nThe board decided it should be someone who specialized in a different genre of music than Jarreau.\n\n“Al Jarreau was a jazz legend,” she said. “One doesn't easily replace a legend and we decided it would be a dishonor to his legacy to even try.”\n\nIn his place, they booked LeAnn Rimes, a former child country star who today transcends genres. At age 34, Rimes has had 42 singles on the Billboard Country chart. She became the youngest recipient of a Grammy Award in 1997, winning Best Female Country Vocalist for her now classic torch song, “Blue.” She also became the first country artist to win a Grammy for Best New Artist that year.\n\nHer latest album, “Remnants,” takes her in a more contemporary R&B direction.\n\n“‘Remnants’ was inspired by love,” she told The Desert Sun. “We cover every aspect of it – from making it, receiving it, standing up for it, breaking it. I think there is a song everyone can relate to. Musically, I tapped into my mother’s Mississippi roots with a lot of gospel and soul influence. I think it is a sound that I have grown up with and has always been in me, so it is great to finally let that out and come to life on this record.”\n\nRimes was born in Jackson, Mississippi, and grew up in Garland, Texas – less than an hour from Ruta Lee’s second home in Fort Worth. And, like Lee, she grew up doing musical theatre. She appeared in a Dallas production of “A Christmas Carol” and tried out for a Broadway production of “Annie.” She didn’t get the role and soon turned to country music.\n\nOne can only imagine what might have happened if she had gained fame as a child star of Broadway.\n\n“I am grateful for all the opportunities that I have had,” Rimes said. “I think everything happens for a reason and clearly this was my path. So I am thankful for it.”\n\nShe declined to talk about her transition from a 14-year-old country superstar to a grown-up pop star. She didn’t follow the same outrageous path to maturity as Miley Cyrus or Justin Bieber. On Rime’s 21st birthday, she wrote a children’s book about a young jaguar, called “Jag.”\n\nShe began singing more pop material after the success of “Blue,” an album that also included her version of Eddy Arnold’s 1955 country standard, “The Cattle Call.” Her 1998 album, “Sittin’ On Top of the World,” contained pop material by Carole Bayer Sager and David Foster, and a remake of Prince’s “Purple Rain.” But it also contained the country hits “Commitment” and “Nothing New Under the Sun.”\n\nShe said she never intentionally tried new genres just for the sake of change.\n\n“In general, I try to follow my intuition, that instinct in my gut when I hear a song that tells me I want to sing it,” Rimes said. “I never think of genres and I still don't.”\n\nBut she did hire Mark Batson, a producer who has won Grammy Awards for rap albums by Eminem and an R&B album for Beyoncé, to help her with “Remnants.” Batson also had worked with Alicia Keys, Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, Nas, Seal, 50 Cent and James Blunt. So that was seen as a sign that Rimes was taking a different direction. But she said she wasn’t overtly influenced into going down a new path.\n\n“I didn’t listen to other music while recording this album on purpose so we could just let the music flow,” Rimes said. “I worked with my long-time producer and songwriting partner Darrell Brown and collaborated with Mark Batson for the first time. Mark, I think, definitely brought his R&B and urban music background to the table. So, I think between all of us, we all influenced this album.”\n\nNEW FUNDRAISING GROUP: Symphonettes raising money\n\nRimes said she also likes working with symphony orchestras. Desert Symphony officials said her benefit concert is expected to include her renditions of “Blue” and a Patsy Cline medley to showcase the late great country vocalist’s early influence on her career. Also on her songlist is \"Summertime” from George Gershwin’s “Porgy and Bess” opera, her 2007 country hit, “Nothing Better To Do,” and “The Story” from “Remnants.”\n\nThe Desert Symphony, conducted by music director Gary Berkson, will open the concert with lush tributes to past female pop stars such as Billie Holliday, Dinah Washington and Judy Garland. Then Rimes will come on to sing with the orchestra.\n\n“Whenever the chance arises, I try to make it happen,” Rimes said. “The emotion a great symphony adds to my songs is a wonderful experience. I get goosebumps on stage when they start playing.”\n\nShe’s also planning a few surprises.\n\n“We have some special music coming in time for Mother’s Day,” she said. “There's a new dance single coming for the clubs around the same time and that is all while the current single (from “Remnants”) is being played. That's the fun of doing what I do. I always have something new being created.”\n\nClassical Rimes\n\nWhat: LeAnn Rimes in the Desert Symphony’s 28th Anniversary Celebration, honoring Ruta Lee\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. April 1\n\nWhere: The McCallum Theatre, 73-000 Fred Waring Drive, Palm Desert\n\nTickets: $500, including dinner at Wally’s or Cuistot restaurants, or $77-$202 for the concert only"
