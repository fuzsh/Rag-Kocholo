Postmedia may earn an affiliate commission from purchases made through links on this page.\n\nArticle content\n\nAl Jarreau, the iconic jazz singer whose rose to widespread fame in the late 1970s and early 1980s, died Sunday at the age of 76. A few days earlier, he had announced his retirement.\n\nThe Wisconsin-born Jarreau worked as a rehabilitation counsellor before turning to music full-time in his late 20s. Ultimately, he won seven Grammy Awards in multiple categories, beginning with his 1978 Best Jazz Vocal Performance win for the double live album Look To The Rainbow. Smooth and funky crossover successes followed in the 1980s, including the acclaimed albums Breakin’ Away and Jarreau. Also in the 1980s, Jarreau took part in the recording of We Are The World, and he also sang the theme song to the TV show Moonlighting.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nR.I.P.

The first shows Jarreau’s singular vitality and inventiveness. Would there have been such commanding and diverse singers as Bobby McFerrin and Kurt Elling if there hadn’t been Al Jarreau?\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBelow, it’s great to see Jarreau, 36 years later and still ebullient, supported by a stellar cast that once again includes Corea, performing for Barack and Michelle Obama among others on International Jazz Day.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSome salutes to Al Jarreau on Twitter:\n\nWith a heavy heart I say goodbye to my good friend and brother, the great Al Jarreau. 11 years ago today we… https://t.co/wJsOFBDL5T — George Benson (@GBguitar) February 13, 2017\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nRIP Al Jarreau, the best to ever do it, thanks for recording one of my songs. #AlJarreau #RIPaljarreau #Jazz https://t.co/4o7OoWVTOx — SIEDAH GARRETT (@SIEDAHGARRETT) February 13, 2017\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\n#AlJarreau was a master improviser, an endearing storyteller…always able to capture an audience and anyone with whom he shared the stage. pic.twitter.com/fxlEUjDDnW — Cassandra Wilson (@reallycassandra) February 12, 2017\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nAs we salute music @Grammys, I want to salute one of the greatest Mr. Al Jarreau. Jazz has no boundaries @AlJarreau https://t.co/I8muLhUHsG — Terence Blanchard (@T_Blanchard) February 13, 2017\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nAt aljarreau.com, the following message is posted:\n\n“His 2nd priority in life was music. There was no 3rd. His 1st priority, far ahead of the other, was healing or comforting anyone in need. Whether it was emotional pain, or physical discomfort, or any other cause of suffering, he needed to put our minds at ease and our hearts at rest. He needed to see a warm, affirming smile where there had not been one before. Song was just his tool for making that happen.\n\n“A few things I think Al would want mentioned right now:\n\n“To Al’s wife, son, sister, brothers and family: You allowed Al to share himself with the world. He was grateful that you gave him that gift. He knew it was difficult, and regretted that more than he could explain. Please know that your gift was to us, too, and that we are also grateful.\n\n“To everyone who attended his concerts and listened to his albums: He needed you, and you were always there for him, for more than 50 years. He was thankful for you every day and tried to show that to each of you.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“To his band, and to the many, many talented musicians, writers, composers, and arrangers who played and collaborated with him over the years: You enabled, supported and thrilled him. He treasured you, and considered you brilliant. He loved sharing the stage with you, and was honored that you shared it with him.\n\n“To each promoter, presenter and producer: Thank you for your faith in him. Your commitment to Al was both essential and endless, and he never took you for granted.\n\n“To his agents, managers, crew, counselors, publicists, and journalists who supported his work, and also to all of the airline, hotel, venue and other people who hosted him like royalty: He noticed every bit of the dedication and effort that you unselfishly provided without limits. And, he appreciated you completely.\n\n“To young people everywhere, especially the musicians he was grateful to meet at school workshops, musical competitions, residencies, and at concerts: From you, Al asks a favor. Please find any artistic thing that you can do with passion, and do it. With art in your life, you will be a better family member, neighbor, friend, and citizen.”\n\n“Finally, to Al Jarreau, from all of us: Thank you. You completed your ministry in a gracious way. Godspeed… you’ve earned it.”\n\nRest in Peace, Al Jarreau.\n\nphum@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/peterhum\n\nottawacitizen.com/jazzblog\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
