He was 76.\n\nJarreau was hospitalized earlier in the week and was said to have been improving slowly.\n\nThe Wisconsin native has won seven Grammys over a 50-year career. His biggest single was 1981's \"We're in This Love Together.\" Jarreau was a vocalist on the all-star 1985 track, \"We Are the World,\" and sang the theme to TV's \"Moonlighting.\"\n\nHe is one of the few artists to have won Grammys in three separate categories -- jazz, pop and R&B.\n\nJarreau is survived by his wife, Susan, and a son, Ryan."
