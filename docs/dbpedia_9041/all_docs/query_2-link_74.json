Woody Allen giving an impromptu clarinet show at the Municipal Auditorium. Mahalia Jackson belting \"Just a Closer Walk with Thee\" in Congo Square -- then Beauregard Square -- with Duke Ellington closing the whole thing out. Just 350 folks attended the first, very modest and freewheeling New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Fest in April 1970, but with a lineup of legends like that -- not to mention Al Hirt, Fats Domino, The Meters and Clifton Chenier -- the local music extravaganza immediately became a quintessential part of Crescent City culture, heritage and lore.\"\n\n(Photo by Steve Dipaola, the Oregonian archive)\n\n1971 - Dizzy Gillespie\n\nOther big time visitors: Movie director and clarinetist Woody Allen\n\nSelect hometown faves: Kid Ory, Pete Fountain, Professor Longhair, Zion Harmonizers, Babe Stovall, Papa Albert French and the Original Tuxedo Brass Band\n\nEvening Concerts: From its beginning until well into the 21st-century, the Jazz Fest presented evening concerts at New Orleans' Municipal Auditorium, the Riverboat President, Saenger Theatre, UNO Lakefront Arena and elsewhere. The most popular guest performers usually appeared at these special venues, but they often performed on the festival site as well. Early on, the daytime, outdoor part of the festival was referred to as the Heritage Fair.\n\n(Photo by Henry Grossman for Time Magazine, 1964)\n\n1972 - Thelonius Monk\n\nOther big time visitors: Nina Simone, B.

Fifty years after its founding, skeptics still criticize the Jazz Fest management for not sticking more strictly to the single musical style mentioned in it's name. But Jazz Fest has always included examples of other genres. In 1980 jazz fusion pioneer Chick Corea topped the bill, but the disco group Chic was also in the lineup and so was the poet Gil Scott-Heron, who was blazing a trail toward rap.\n\nSelect hometown faves: Chris Owens, Irma Thomas, Dr. John, John Rankin, The Radiators\n\nPhoto by Eliot Kamenitz, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune)\n\n1987 - Dr. John\n\nOutstanding big time visitors: The Band, The Four Tops, Spiro Gyro, King Sunny Ade, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Leon Redbone\n\nSelect hometown faves: Fats Domino, Wynton Marsalis, Irma Thomas, Allan Toussaint, Ernie K-Doe\n\nSomeone you might not have expected to see at Jazz Fest: Kenny G\n\nHeading to Gentilly: Though night time shows at venues such as the S.S.

The caption of this undated photo reads: \"Musicians were covered by a tent, so there wasn't a single guitarist electrocuted during intermittent rain at Saturday's Jazz and Heritage Festival. Here, The Radiators appear before an enthusiastic crowd. Despite the on-again-off-again showers, all festival acts went on as scheduled.\"\n\nNote: Springsteen's scrappy performance seemed to perfectly fit the first Jazz Fest after Hurricane Katrina and the 2005 flood.\n\nCorrection: Fats Domino was originally listed among the 2006 performers, but cancelled because of illness.\n\nPhoto by Brett Duke, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune)\n\n2007 - ZZ Top\n\nOther big time visitors: Van Morrison, Richie Havens, Rod Stewart, Counting Crows, George Benson, Allman Brothers, John Mayer, Steely Dan, New Edition\n\nSelect hometown faves: Bonerama, Henry Butler, Pete Fountain, Jerry Lee Lewis, Irma Thomas, Radiators, Harry Connick Jr.\n\n(Photo by Brett Duke, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune)\n\n2008 - Billy Joel\n\nNote: Bennett has the distinction of being the only artist to both headline the festival and paint one of the festival posters, his 2010 portrait of Louis Prima.

Whatever the capacity of the Acura Stage field - 50,000? 60,000? - it was at maximum capacity for Elton John. This was no surprise: Sunny weather plus Saturday plus a legacy artist with a vast catalog of songs most people on the planet know by heart will equal an enormous turnout every time.\"\n\n(Photo by Brett Duke, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune)\n\n2018 - Aerosmith\n\nOther big time visitors: Anita Baker, Steel Pulse, Khalid, Rod Stewart, David Byrne, Lyle Lovett, Toots and Maytals, Beck, Cage the Elephant, Steve Miller\n\nSelect hometown faves: Big Freedia, Tank and the Bangas, Sonny Landreth, Doug Kershaw, Aaron Neville, The Radiators\n\n(Photo by Doug MacCash, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune)\n\n2019 - Katy Perry\n\nOther big time visitors: Alanis Morsette, Doobie Brothers, Leon Bridges, Van Morrison, Johnny Rivers, Tom Jones, Mavis Staples, Gladys Knight, Los Lobos, Pit Bull, Diana Ross\n\nSelect hometown faves: Boyfriend, Big Freedia, Tank and the Bangas, The Revivalists, Chris Owens, Hurray for the Riff Raff, Nathan and the Zydeco Cha Chas\n\n(Photo by Michel Euler, AP)\n\nThe year of the cancellations\n\nThe 50th anniversary Jazz Fest may be remembered for the performers who were unable to appear. The Rolling Stones were expected to appear on May 2, but canceled when vocalist Mick Jagger required heart valve surgery.\n\nThe Stones were replaced by Fleetwood Mac, which was forced to bow out in order for vocalist Stevie Nicks to recover from the flu.\n\nFleetwood Mac was then replaced by Widespread Panic.\n\nPlease read: \"Jazz Fest stars should all cover Mick Jagger, Stevie Nicks and Jerry Lee Lewis songs\"\n\nPhoto of Sheryl Crow by Michael DeMocker, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune)\n\nWho decided?\n\nMany thanks to the Jazz Fest archive for providing access to all of the annual festival programs.\n\nSince the festival usually spans seven days, with innumerable acts on several stages, at various sites, it was difficult to decide exactly who was THE headliner for any given year. In creating our list of Jazz Fest's biggest stars from 1970 to 2019, we avoided duplications and tried to choose shows that implied the variety found at the festival.\n\n(Photo of festival closer Trombone Shorty by David Grunfeld, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune)\n\nDoug MacCash\n\nhas the best job in the world, covering art, music and culture in New Orleans.
