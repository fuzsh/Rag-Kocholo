        "text": "Behind Al Jarreau, the discreet man who is reluctant to talk about himself hides a beast of the stage coupled with a rhythm monster, passionate about jazz, soul, funk or R&B. A diversity that has sometimes earned him the criticism of his peers but through which he has become a legend.\n\nThe gods certainly leaned over the cradle of this son of a pastor and a pianist to grant him this unique voice. Ranging from the lowest notes of a baritone to astonishing and subtle highs, he is the very embodiment of music. A scat lover, king of vocal percussion, his concerts are always tinged with improvised flights of fancy, his twisted face and unique gestures galvanising the crowds.\n\nAn outstanding technician, he transcends musical boundaries with elegance and communicative joy, reconciling the demands of jazz and the exuberance of pop like no one before him. His covers of standards such as Agua De Beber, where he offers an unprecedented demonstration and rhythmic mastery, or the pop hit by Elton John Your Song are perfect reinventions of classical masterpieces.\n\nAnd yet the world has almost been deprived of the talents of this great artist who was primarily dedicated to a career as a psychologist and social worker. \"As a psychologist and social worker, I have learned to understand the suffering and difficult times of others. ...] It changed me! I hope that this is reflected in my music and the way I perform. Deeply human, Al Jarreau embodies generosity in life and on stage, with the desire to \"comfort those who are suffering\" as a common thread. A contagious joy that transforms his concerts into an authentic communion."
