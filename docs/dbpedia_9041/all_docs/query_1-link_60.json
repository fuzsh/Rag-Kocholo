        "text": "It was in the summer of 1968 that Al Jarreau first caught the attention of audiences. Playing as part of a small duo in the Sausalito Marina in California, he drew huge unexpected audiences that came to see the “crazy singer” who could imitate an entire band with his voice. Half a century later, he stands before us as one of the kings of vocalization and as a jazz artist who has dedicated his career to pushing the boundaries of his craft.\n\nYet despite his purism, popular success has also been part of his story. Much like his peer Bobby McFerrin, his voice captured the mainstream on singles, like “We’re In This Love Together” and “Mornin’,” which is also the opening track to his 2015 performance at the famous Olympia venue in Paris. Welcomed as a conquering hero, Jarreau is one of jazz’ most-loved performers and he brings out all the frills in this show, performing a wide-ranging repertoire with a particular highlight, of course, being the final track, his stupendous standard “Roof Garden.”"
