        "text": "LOS ANGELES – Al Jarreau, a versatile vocalist who sold millions of records and won numerous Grammys for his work in pop and R&B as well as his first love, jazz, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 76.\n\nHis death was announced by his manager, Joe Gordon, who said Jarreau had been hospitalized for exhaustion two weeks ago.\n\nA preacher’s son, Jarreau started singing in public as a boy but did not begin a full-time musical career until the late 1960s, when he was nearly 30. Before that, he had worked as a psychologist and rehabilitation counselor.\n\nBy the 1970s he had became a widely popular jazz singer, touring extensively and appearing often on television.\n\nCritics praised his supple voice, his improvisational skill and, in particular, his virtuosic ability to produce an array of vocalizations, ranging from delicious nonsense to clicks and growls to quasi-instrumental sounds.\n\nOver time, Jarreau’s work – both his singing and his original compositions – came to incorporate elements of pop, folk, soul, gospel, rhythm and blues, and Latin music. The result was a highly accessible, intensely personal and commercially successful style that defied easy genre classification, though some jazz purists derided it as fusion or, worse still, smooth jazz.\n\nJarreau released more than 20 albums. He won seven Grammys, and it was a mark of his eclecticism that they spanned three categories: jazz, pop and R&B.\n\nHe won a Grammy in 1978 for best jazz vocal performance, for his album “Look to the Rainbow.” He won his last in 2007, for best traditional R&B vocal performance; the award was shared by Jarreau, George Benson and Jill Scott for their collaborative performance, “God Bless the Child.”\n\nIn between, in 1982, Jarreau earned a Grammy for best pop vocal performance by a male artist for the title track of his album “Breakin’ Away.” That year, he also received the Grammy for best jazz vocal performance by a male artist, for his version of Dave Brubeck’s “Blue Rondo à la Turk,” from the same album.\n\nHis other Grammys came in 1979 for the album “All Fly Home” (in the jazz category) and in 1993 for the album “Heaven and Earth” (in R&B).\n\nAlwin Lopez Jarreau was born in Milwaukee on March 12, 1940. His father, a minister, was a fine singer; his mother played the piano in church. Young Al began singing at 4, harmonizing with his siblings. As a youth he sang in church, as well as with street-corner harmony groups and local jazz bands.\n\nJarreau earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Ripon College in Wisconsin in 1962 and a master’s in vocational rehabilitation from the University of Iowa in 1964. Afterward he moved to San Francisco, where he worked as a rehabilitation counselor for people with disabilities.\n\nBut Jarreau found he could not resist the pull of jazz and before long was singing in small clubs. By the late ’60s he had quit his day job and embarked on a nightclub career, first on the West Coast and eventually in New York.\n\nThe album advertised as his debut, “We Got By,” was released by Warner Bros. in 1975 to critical praise. (A decade earlier, Jarreau had quietly recorded an album, later released on the Bainbridge label under the title “1965.” Though Jarreau took legal action, without success, to block its belated release in 1982, it is esteemed by jazz connoisseurs today.)\n\nHis other albums include “Glow” (1979) and “Accentuate the Positive” (2004).\n\nJarreau’s first marriage, to Phyllis Hall, ended in divorce.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, the former Susan Player; a son, Ryan; two brothers, Marshall and Appie; and a sister, Rose Marie Freeman.\n\nSo eclectic was Jarreau that he even did a turn in a Broadway musical, appearing as a replacement in the role of the Teen Angel in the 1994 revival of “Grease.”"
