        "text": "Â After graduating from West Point with a degree in Nuclear Engineering, Pat commissioned into the Infantry, completed Ranger School, and was sent to Fort Wainwright, Alaska, for his first assignment as Infantry Platoon Leader.Â\n\nEducation\n\nPat deployed to Afghanistan and took over a small air-access only combat outpost in the heart of the Arghandab valley. At 23 years old and in charge of roughly 350 Americans, Afghans, and expatriates, and responsible for nearly $100 million worth of infrastructure and equipment, it was a unique and formative leadership experience for Pat.\n\nMilitary\n\nPat and his men enjoyed extraordinary success and upon returning to the United States, Pat volunteered and was selected for the Special Forces, and moved to North Carolina to complete Special Forces training.Â\n\nAfter becoming a Green Beret, Pat returned to Afghanistan and led his Special Forces unit through increasingly difficult and challenging circumstances that corresponded with a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan. At this time, it became clear to Pat that the United States had lost the political will to win, and we had a true crisis of leadership brewing in our country.Â\n\nWhile on active duty, Pat and his wife Rocky created a small firearms business that operated from their double-wide trailer home outside of Fayetteville. It grew out of their living room, then grew out of their garage, and then grew out of the warehouse they built behind the double-wide!Â\n\nBusiness\n\nWhen Pat left the Army, the pair had created a contract-manufacturing powerhouse, which Pat and his partners later grew into a manufacturing powerhouse. They purchased a 120,000 square foot state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and have been manufacturing American made defense products in Western North Carolina ever since.Â\n\nPat and his amazing wife Rocky have been married for 13 years and have 2 beautiful daughters, Reagan (6) and McKinley (4). After the fall of Afghanistan, Pat could no longer stand idly by and watch our country deteriorate economically, socially, morally, and spiritually at the hands of failed leadership achieving failed outcomes.\n\nThe Call to Serve"
