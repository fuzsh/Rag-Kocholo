        "text": "Patrick is the president and chief executive officer of the NC Rural Center. He is a product of our state’s public schools, including Piney Creek Elementary School in Piney Creek and Alleghany High School in Sparta. He graduated from Wake Forest University in 1987 and from Wake Forest University School of Law in 1990.\n\nAfter law school, Patrick worked briefly for Congressman Steve Neal before becoming the first executive director of the Alleghany County Chamber of Commerce in his hometown of Sparta. From 1992-1999, Patrick served as director of the chamber and as the lead economic developer for the county, successfully recruiting two new industries to the county that were the top new investments in the entire state in 1994 and 1998.\n\nToward the end of Patrick’s chamber tenure, a collaborative effort led by the Alleghany Chamber resulted in the New River being named one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in the United States by President Bill Clinton in July of 1998. Nine months later, Patrick left the chamber to become the first executive director of a startup nonprofit, New River Community Partners, the lead organization responsible for coordinating and leading the basin-wide implementation of a sustainable economic development plan encompassing three northwestern North Carolina counties, 11 southwestern Virginia counties, and seven southern West Virginia counties.\n\nIn 2000, Patrick was elected to the Alleghany County Board of Commissioners. In 2003, Patrick, still director of New River Community Partners was simultaneously named executive director of the Blue Ridge Business Development Center, a revitalization project in Sparta that was an initiative of New River Community Partners. The project involved the renovation of an abandoned textile plant—the place his mother had worked for 42 years—into a state-of- the-art technology and education center focused on transitioning the region’s old manufacturing economy to a new more diversified economic base for northwestern North Carolina.\n\nIn March of 2006, Patrick lost his father, a retired school teacher. He then made the difficult decision to leave his home county in October of 2006 to become vice president of programs for the North Carolina Rural Center. As a graduate of the Center’s Rural Economic Development Institute and a member of the Center’s board of directors from 1997 to 2000, Patrick already had a long history with–and connection to–the NC Rural Center.\n\nIn 2013, he was named president of the NC Rural Center and led the organization through a major transition, repositioning the Center into a new era of work and community engagement but still focused on the singular mission to serve the people and places of rural North Carolina.\n\n“I can’t imagine work that is more rewarding or more important to me that the work I’ve been able to do at the Rural Center. It’s enabled me to experience every nook and cranny of the ‘goodliest land under the cope of heaven’ and to do work that maintains a deep connection with the place and people of Piney Creek, who gave me everything I have needed to live a very blessed life.”\n\nCarolyn Rhodes is an accomplished and visionary leader with an unwavering commitment to fostering collaboration, driving innovation, and championing progressive change. With a remarkable 20-plus year journey across diverse sectors, Carolyn’s passion lies in cultivating inclusive leadership; instituting comprehensive diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) strategies, and building sustainable infrastructures.\n\nAt the core of her leadership philosophy is a resolute dedication to equitable representation and opportunities for career advancement. This principle intertwines with her pursuit of operational excellence and adherence to stringent compliance standards.\n\nHaving collaborated extensively with senior executives in nonprofits, small- and mid-sized businesses, and large corporations, Carolyn brings insight into equity and organizational development. Her approach encompasses active listening, transformative challenges, motivational guidance, and inspirational encouragement, all of which inspire individuals to transcend conventional boundaries and embrace innovation.\n\nAn alumnus of Peace College with a B.A. in psychology, Carolyn also holds a nonprofit management certification from Duke University and has earned distinction as a senior certified professional from the Society of Human Resources Management.\n\nAs a fervent supporter of her community, Carolyn’s advocacy extends to nonprofits aiding single mothers, affordable housing initiatives, and empowering Black male youth in Durham. A Durham native herself, Carolyn’s commitment to giving back is an embodiment of her aspiration to empower others in reshaping the world.\n\nBeyond her professional journey, Carolyn finds solace in an active lifestyle. An ardent runner, she thrives on the camaraderie of the outdoors through hiking and adventure, coupled with the mindfulness of practices such as hot yoga and strength training. She also loves international travel, which allows her to continue to broaden her horizons and gain fresh perspectives.\n\nFranklin is the chief finance officer at the NC Rural Center, overseeing the Center’s finances, operations and information technology.\n\nHe retired from Batchelor, Tillery & Roberts, LLP (BTR) in 2021, where he was a founding and audit partner.

Born and raised in a small rural town in Southern California, Jenal grew up enjoying the many animals on her family’s pet resort-style farm and exploring the nearby mountains. Her parents each had their own very successful small businesses; her mom ran a local accounting firm and her dad installed and maintained water wells for rural people who were not connected to urban water systems.\n\nJenal’s life quickly became one of city living when she attended high school and college in San Diego. To satisfy her itch for travel, she studied abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina and ended up staying for almost two years to take classes, volunteer, and teach English. She then moved to Boston, where she worked for various public and nonprofit organizations, including a community college, a large university, and a health and human services agency. She obtained her MBA in Public and Nonprofit Management from Boston University’s Questrom School of Business. After graduate school, she moved to North Carolina where she had the opportunity to manage corporate and foundation partnerships for the Girl Scouts and do some consulting work for a nonprofit fundraising firm called moss+ross.\n\nJenal is passionate about supporting underserved communities and is thrilled to be part of an organization that empowers North Carolina’s rural people and places. When she’s not building partnerships, she loves to hike with her sweet black lab, cycle the back roads of Orange County, grow fruits and veggies in her novice backyard garden, and do front porch yoga in the sunshine.\n\nDalton Bailey is a data manager for the NC Rural Center.

Dalton also worked as an intern and subcontracted consultant for Elevate Consulting, an evaluation and consulting firm based in Nashville that predominantly serves local non-profit organizations.\n\nComing from a rural background, Dalton is passionate about using his knowledge to benefit rural communities.
