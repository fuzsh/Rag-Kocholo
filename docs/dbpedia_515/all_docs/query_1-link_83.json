        "text": "The inability for some elders to retire in America is a widespread problem for those over 65. With the rise of inflation, money that they managed to save for retirement won't go nearly as far as they once planned.\n\nThat's true for a 97-year-old woman who bartends at her local watering hole, but she still deserves respect. Instead, she was punched in the face for denying a drink to a customer.\n\nWoman Punches 97-Year-Old Bartender\n\nIt all went down at Hurricane Tina's Bar in Fort Myers Beach, Fla.\n\nAccording to a report by Fox 35 in Orlando, the 97 year-old bartender, Betty Kai — known at the bar as \"Betty Boop\" — says a woman who claimed to be the bar owner’s sister became aggressive when denied another drink.\n\nShe grabbed Kai's arm and struck her in the face with a closed fist before other patrons intervened and escorted her outside.\n\nSarah Lucille Powell, 24, now faces multiple charges, including battery on a person 65 years of age or older, battery on an officer, resisting an officer, and providing a false ID to an officer.\n\nWho hits an elderly woman in the face? This lady:\n\nAfter the debacle — which happened around noon on July 18 — the suspect ran away and police had to do a search of the area to find her, which they did.\n\nKai sustained multiple lacerations on her forearm, and a red, swollen cheek. Lee County EMS treated her injuries on-site, but she declined further medical treatment like the bada-- she is.\n\nKai told deputies she intended to press charges. Surveillance footage of the incident was collected."
