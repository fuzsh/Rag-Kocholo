Only cash or checks will be accepted at the door.\n\nOriginally, Green was scheduled to play only on Saturday, but he agreed to add a second show when the first one sold out so quickly.\n\n“We are so excited to have an artist with such a long and great reputation in Texas country playing in Albany and at the Aztec,” board member Lynsi Musselman said.\n\nAlbany Live opened up more reserved seating for the Friday show so people can pick their seats.\n\nThe doors will open at the Aztec for the Friday performance at 7:00 p.m., with the show starting at 8:00 p.m. The Saturday performance will start at 7:00 p.m.\n\nGreen will also be in town to support a pop-up show by his wife, Kori, featuring her original jewelry designs. Her jewelry will be shown at Me and Mrs. Jones on Saturday across the street from the Aztec Theater.\n\nArtist’s Background\n\nBorn in San Antonio, Texas, Pat Green firmly established himself as a Texas legend with his evocative blend of traditional and modern country music. He started his musical career playing at local bars while attending Texas Tech University, quickly capturing the hearts of listeners with his authentic sound and heartfelt storytelling\n\nGreen’s debut album, Dancehall Dreamer, released in 1995, marked the beginning of a celebrated journey that would deeply embed him in the fabric of Texas music culture.\n\nHis influence in Texas country music is underscored by a career that spans over two decades, with albums like Three Days and the gold-certified Wave on Wave.\n\nAdding to his storied career, Pat Green just released a new song titled “Elvis in Memphis,” which promises to enchant listeners with its rich narrative and melodious charm.\n\nAlongside his creative endeavors, Green continues to tour extensively across the United States, bringing his iconic music to fans old and new"
