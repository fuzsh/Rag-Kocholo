If you have any questions, please feel free to contact our office or contact an admissions counselor individually.\n\nOur counselors are divided into two groups, trained to meet your personal admission needs: freshmen counselors or transfer counselors. Our talented admissions staff also handles International Student applications.\n\nNot only do our transfer counselors work with students who have previously attended another college or university after graduating from high school but with students who do not have a recent high school profile.\n\nUndergraduate Admissions Administrators\n\nUndergraduate Admissions Counselors (Located on Cullowhee Campus)\n\nKeyona Presha\n\nAssociate Director of Undergraduate Admissions Recruitment\n\nkpresha@wcu.edu\n\n828.227.2682\n\nHometown: Asheville, NC\n\nEducational Background: Bachelor of Business Administration with a Concentration in Management, North Carolina Central University; Master of Science in Communication with a Specialization in Public Relations, Syracuse University\n\nProfessional background: I started my professional journey in banking in 2016 before transitioning over to admissions in 2019.
