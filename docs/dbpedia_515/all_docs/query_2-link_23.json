        "text": "Pat Green is one of the greatest country musicians and singers of our generation, and yet, outside of Texas, he's never received the commercial notoriety he deserves. Even without the acclaim, glitz and glamour, however, Green has created a canon of songs that will stand the test of time and likely outlast many of his contemporaries.\n\nBorn in San Antonio and raised in Waco, Green is a Texas boy through and through — he even attended Texas Tech University, where he was a member of the FarmHouse fraternity — and his love of the Lone Star State shines through in all of his music.\n\nWith countless singles under his belt and a wealth of studio albums to his name, The Boot has picked out the Top 5 Pat Green Songs of all time.
