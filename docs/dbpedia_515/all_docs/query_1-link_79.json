        "text": "The birth of the Hitmen. For years Rick Monroe has been a solo artist hiring players as needed and doing the Nashville shuffle of interchangeable bands, but during covid everything changed. In 2020, Rick and the band, with Bobby Perkins & Alan Beeler, were set to have an amazing year starting off with a West Coast tour when the world shut down. Instead of everyone going their own way, they all stuck together and started streaming live shows from their basements, garages and living rooms. At the same time Rick and Alan Beeler started a standing Tuesday writing meeting which eventually became the bulk of their current album. Through some mutual friends, Rick met Malcolm Springer and they decided to track a few songs and see how it went. Once in the studio it was obvious that this was quickly becoming more of a band situation and when Malcolm brought Jason Bohl in, the sound finally came together. Rick joked one night about how the band was killing it and bam- someone said “The Hitmen”- and that was that.\n\nRick Monroe – Vocals, Guitar\n\nWorld-class entertainer Rick Monroe brings his music and a magnetic presence wherever he goes. With adown-to-earth Country resonance, Monroe is no stranger to the stage: he’s performed in 17 countries–and every U.S. state including Washington DC & Puerto Rico. The seven-time Jägermeister Country Brand Ambassador has toured with Eric Church, Dierks Bentley, Lee Bice, Aaron Lewis, Eli Young Band, Pat Green & Randy Houser as well as has opened for Country Music Legends like Charlie Daniels Band, Dwight Yoakam, Travis Tritt, Patty Loveless and more; entertained for the USO, AFE, U.S. troops in Vietnam and the former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. His brother called him “Elvis Gump” because of all the amazing people and places his career has led him.\n\nShow-goers can expect to hear some of Rick’s new material as well as hit singles like the sultry “This Side of You,” and the Southern rocker “Cocaine Cold & Whiskey Shakes.” As well as several Top 40 hits from the IT’S A LOVE THING, GYPSY SOUL EPs & Full Albums SMOKE OUT THE WINDOW & AGAINST THE GRAIN.\n\nFor those who aren’t familiar with his music, Rick advises them to come to the show for a good time and to be ready for “just about anything.” “I love to play,” the singer notes. “And I want everyone to play along. I like to think of my shows as an interactive sport.”\n\nRick grew up in a variety of places–California, Connecticut, Kansas, North Carolina, even England, and his love of music and outgoing personality naturally drew him to the stage. Now based in Nashville, Monroe believes GYPSY SOUL shows the kind of diversity he can offer as an artist. He says, “I’m not so linear in my approach to music; I’m more diversified. My influences range from A to Z and I always try to put that into my music. But my home base will always be Country because it’s not just about the hype of an idea; it’s based on songs.” Fans can expect to hear a wide range of material–but Rick promises that it will all be quality. If his chart success is any indication, it’s clear Monroe knows what folks want to hear–and he’s eager to give them exactly that.\n\nThe “Great Minds” music video and “This Side of You” Lyric video have logged over 1,500,000 views on YouTube. While his streams, without any curated playlist have reached of 1,000,000 and growing.\n\nRick enjoys sponsorships and/or endorsements with Monster Energy Drink, GHS Strings, SE electronics, Roper Western Wear, Shubb Capos, Speakeasy Original, Westone Audio & Fishman Audio."
