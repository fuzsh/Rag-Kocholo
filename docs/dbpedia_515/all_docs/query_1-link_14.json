        "text": "American singer/songwriter\n\nFor other uses, see Riley Green (disambiguation).\n\nMusical artist\n\nRiley Green (born October 18, 1988) is an American country music singer and songwriter. Signed to Nashville Harbor Records & Entertainment (formerly BMLG) since 2019, he has released two albums: Different 'Round Here in 2019 and Ain't My Last Rodeo in 2023. Green has charted four top-20 hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts: \"There Was This Girl\", \"I Wish Grandpas Never Died\", \"Half of Me\" (with Thomas Rhett), and \"Different 'Round Here\" (with Luke Combs).\n\nMusic career\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore he was a recording artist, Green was a Division 1 FCS Quarterback on the Jacksonville State University football team. Green was also a contestant on the CMT reality show Redneck Island. He released a self-titled EP in 2013, followed by additional EPs in 2015, 2016, and 2017. In 2018, he signed to the Big Machine Label Group.[1][2]\n\nBilly Dukes of Taste of Country reviewed \"There Was This Girl\" favorably, comparing its theme to \"Chicks Dig It\" by Chris Cagle and noting the more neotraditional country influence compared to Green's peers.[3] The song charted on Country Airplay, and a music video was shot in October 2018.[4]\n\nIn April 2019, Green announced the release of his second single, \"In Love by Now\", co-written with Rhett Akins, Ben Hayslip, and Marv Green, and released an accompanying music video shot in Belize.[5][6]\n\n\"I Wish Grandpas Never Died\" was released in August 2019 as the third single from Green's debut album, Different 'Round Here, which was released on September 20, 2019.[7]\n\nThe Academy of Country Music presented Riley Green with the New Male Artist of the Year Award for 2019.[8]\n\nHe collaborated on a song with Justin Moore for his 2023 album, Stray Dog.[9]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of studio albums, with selected details, peak chart positions and certifications Title Details Peak chart positions Certifications US\n\n[10] US Country\n\n[11] Different 'Round Here\n\nRelease date: September 20, 2019\n\nLabel: Nashville Harbor\n\nFormat: CD, digital download, streaming\n\n95 11\n\nRIAA: Gold[12]\n\nAin't My Last Rodeo\n\nRelease date: October 13, 2023\n\nLabel: Nashville Harbor\n\nFormat: CD, digital download, streaming\n\n79 15\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\nList of EPs, with selected details and peak chart positions Title Details Peak chart positions US\n\n[10] US Heat\n\n[13] US Country\n\n[11] US Indie\n\n[14] Outlaws Like Us\n\nRelease date: August 2017\n\nLabel: Self-released\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\n— 5 — 24 Riley Green[15]\n\nRelease date: June 1, 2018\n\nLabel: Nashville Harbor\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\n— — — — In a Truck Right Now\n\nRelease date: June 29, 2018\n\nLabel: Nashville Harbor\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\n— 3 — — Get That Man a Beer[16]\n\nRelease date: June 14, 2019\n\nLabel: Nashville Harbor\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\n— 8 — — Behind the Bar\n\nRelease date: July 2, 2021\n\nLabel: Nashville Harbor\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\n122 — 18 — Way Out Here\n\nRelease date: April 12, 2024\n\nLabel: Nashville Harbor\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\n149 — 29 23 \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles, with selected peak chart positions and certifications shown Year Title Peak chart positions Certifications Album US\n\n[17] US Country Songs\n\n[18] US Country Airplay\n\n[19] CAN\n\n[20] CAN Country\n\n[21] 2018 \"There Was This Girl\" 70 11 3 75 1\n\nRIAA: Platinum[22]\n\nARIA: Gold[23]\n\nMC: Gold[24]\n\nDifferent 'Round Here 2019 \"In Love by Now\" — — 52 — — \"I Wish Grandpas Never Died\" 66 12 12 95 11\n\nRIAA: 2× Platinum[22]\n\nARIA: Gold[23]\n\nMC: Platinum[24]\n\n2020 \"If It Wasn't for Trucks\" — 40 41 — —\n\nRIAA: Gold[22]\n\nMC: Gold[24]\n\nBehind the Bar 2022 \"Hell of a Way to Go\" — 50 — — —\n\nRIAA: Gold[22]\n\n— 2023 \"Different 'Round Here\"\n\n(with Luke Combs)[25] 60 15 2 89 11\n\nRIAA: Platinum[22]\n\nMC: Platinum[24]\n\nAin't My Last Rodeo 2024 \"Damn Good Day to Leave\" — — 25 — 43 \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n\nFeatured singles\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles as featured artist, with selected peak chart positions and certifications shown Year Title Peak chart positions Certifications Album US\n\n[17] US Country Songs\n\n[18] US Country Airplay\n\n[19] AUS\n\n[26] CAN\n\n[20] CAN\n\nCountry\n\n[21] IRE\n\n[27] NZ\n\n[28] UK\n\n[29] WW\n\n[30] 2022 \"Half of Me\"\n\n(Thomas Rhett featuring Riley Green) 52 9 1 — 54 1 — — — —\n\nRIAA: Gold[22]\n\nWhere We Started 2024 \"You Look Like You Love Me\"\n\n(Ella Langley featuring Riley Green) 36 13 41\n\n[31] 67 33 — 66 19 59 89 Hungover\n\nOther charted and certified songs\n\n[edit]\n\nList of other charted and certified songs, with selected certifications Year Title Peak chart positions Certifications Album US Bubbling\n\n[32] US Country Songs\n\n[18] 2018 \"Bury Me in Dixie\" — —\n\nRIAA: Gold[22]\n\nOutlaws Like Us \"When She Comes Home Tonight\" — —\n\nRIAA: Gold[22]\n\nRiley Green 2024 \"Worst Way\" 5 32 Way Out Here\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nList of music videos Year Video 2017 \"Bury Me in Dixie\" 2018 \"There Was This Girl\" 2019 \"In Love by Now\" 2020 \"If It Wasn't for Trucks\""
