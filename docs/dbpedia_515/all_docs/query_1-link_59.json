        "text": "Perhaps her first words were not even spoken but likely sang. Billie Jo Jones started singing as soon as she could talk. This singer/songwriter is known for blending traditional country music with her own, unique style and attitude.\n\nBorn in Dallas, TX, this proud native was destined for stardom from a very early age. Billie Jo shares, “I was putting on private concerts for my grandparents who raised me in their living room when I was 4-5 years old! They would sit and watch me for hours and clap for me after every song. I would perform a variety of songs from Shania Twain to the Dixie Chicks to Patsy Cline to Ray Price to Loretta Lynn. I have always loved old country.”\n\nShe made her public debut at age 9 at her local church, Lake Fork Baptist. From there, the opportunities grew and she began singing at different area churches and local Opry’s close by. Some of her first venues were The Cotton Pickin’ Theatre in Point, TX, The Wylie Opry in Wylie, TX, Gladewater Saturday Night Opry in Gladewater, TX and many others that hold a very special place in her heart. She sang The National Anthem for the girls state basketball playoffs every year in high school, which was a huge honor and achievement early on thanks to the help of her superintendent Mr. David Seago.\n\nBillie Jo is one of most loved Texas Country Music favorites. She has shared the stage with artists: Deana Carter, Gene Watson, Linda Davis, Barbara Fairchild, The Oakridge Boys, Diamond Rio, Justin Moore, Wade Bowen, Pat Green, Stoney LaRue, Roger Creager, Sam Riggs, Bryan White, Jerrod Niemann, Josh Abbott, Wade Hayes, Adam Hood, Jason Eady, Courtney Patton, Jamie Lin Wilson, Chris Colston and many others.\n\nA personal highlight, was opening for Ray Price, one of her biggest inspirations and someone she listened to many times with her grandparents over the years.\n\nBillie Jo Jones is being heard all over the world. Her previous single \"Right Now Kinda Girl\" hit #1 on the Texas Regional Radio Chart, 2 weeks in a row on CDX True Indie & several weeks in a row on Texas Internet Radio Chart. The news is spreading fast about this spitfire blonde headed Texan who is resurrecting her favorite style of country music. Hard hitting and truthful lyrics, clever hooks and melodies that will stick in your brain for days. Her new single \"Some Girls Don't Cry\" is the title of her 1st ever full-length country album and is available for airplay everywhere!\n\nWhen asked why she chose to sing and play music, Billie Jo replied, “Singing is the only thing I have ever wanted to do. God didn’t give me this voice to just sit at home with it. I believe He gave me this voice and the courage to go out and play shows every weekend. I have always had a heart for people and getting to share my voice and my story through my songs means EVERYTHING to me”."
