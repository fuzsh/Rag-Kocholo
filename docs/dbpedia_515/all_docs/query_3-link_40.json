        "text": "The division of Vascular & Interventional Radiology consists of twelve diverse, experienced clinical faculty who practice at Froedtert Hospital as well as at the Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center. Our faculty’s entire clinical and research focus is on Interventional Radiology. Our residents will have the opportunity to train with physicians that have a wide range of special interests, such as interventional oncology, palliative medicine, vascular disease (peripheral interventions and Aortic), musculoskeletal interventions, and MR-guided ablation. The division's faculty are world-renowned in their areas of expertise and are frequently invited to speak at national and international meetings. We have demonstrated national leadership within our field including founding the Society of Interventional Oncology (SIO), chairing the SIR Scientific Annual Meeting, holding positions as SIR committee chairs, past and present councilors on the SIR Executive Council, and president of APDIR, among others.\n\nAdditionally, our program has state-of-the-art facilities housed within a new surgical and interventional platform designed with our patients in mind. The new interventional platform has the latest Siemens equipment including five single plane flat panel angiography suites, three bi-plane angiography suites, two hybrid OR Zeegos, and an integrated CT-angiography suite. Our education mission is not limited to our residents as we also support an IR technologist training program, one of only a handful in the country.\n\nThe training environment includes all aspects of Interventional Radiology as well as those pertinent to running a clinical practice. This includes dedicated education on E&M and CPT coding, documentation, and perspectives from hospital administration.\n\nWe thank you for your interest in our residency program, and wish you the very best as you progress through training. Please feel free to contact us with any questions.\n\nComprehensive Training\n\nThe Interventional Radiology residency experience is diverse and extensive with each resident encountering over 1500 patients per year. Our clinical practice covers the full spectrum of interventional radiology, performing all diagnostic and endovascular procedures (outside of cardiac catheterizations and intracranial neuro interventions), all nonvascular percutaneous liver and percutaneous GU procedures, image-guided interventional oncology therapies, and non-invasive outpatient vein therapy procedures. Our division is fully integrated with subspecialities of the Department of Radiology such as digital imaging, chest, and GI radiology. Our residency programs provide well-rounded training for complete clinical competence and prepare our residents for IR/DR certification.\n\nJunior Residents (PGY-2-PGY-4) in our Integrated program focus primarily on Diagnostic Radiology, rotating through thirteen four-week blocks per year that cover chest, MSK, nuclear medicine, neuro-radiology, GI/GU, IR, ultrasound, body CT, body MR, breast, pediatrics, VA digital imaging/VA general imaging, emergency medicine, and American Institute for Radiologic Pathology (AIRP) cardiac. Senior Residents (PGY-5-PGY-6) are devoted to Interventional Radiology, with procedural, ICU, palliative care, and clinical care (in-patient care, consult service, and outpatient clinic) rotations.\n\nWorld-Class Facilities\n\nOur program has state-of-the-art facilities housed within a new surgical and interventional platform designed with our patients in mind. The new interventional platform has the latest Siemens equipment, including five single-plane flat-panel angiography suites, three bi-plane angiography suites, two hybrid OR Zeegos, and an integrated CT-angiography suite.\n\nUnmatched Clinical Experience\n\nOur residents will train with full-time, fellowship trained, CAQ Board Certified faculty whose entire clinical and research focus is Interventional Radiology. With a wide-range of special interests – such as interventional oncology, palliative medicine, peripheral vascular & aortic disease, and musculoskeletal interventions – our faculty are world-renowned in their areas of expertise. They are frequently invited speakers at national and international meetings and show demonstrated leadership within the field.\n\nSurgical Partnerships\n\nWe believe that our practice has many unique qualities including a relationship with the Division of Vascular Surgery, which allows for the collegial combined medical and procedural care of patients with peripheral vascular disease. We have a hybrid operating room that allows combined cases in an operating room setting, while maintaining high-quality imaging. In our education partnership with General Surgery, incoming residents who match into our categorical Integrated Interventional Radiology program will also match into a preliminary year with MCW General Surgery, where their training is specifically geared to a future in interventional radiology.\n\nCutting-Edge Research\n\nThe Division of Vascular & Interventional Radiology is currently enrolling in multicenter, prospective randomized control trials and has a dedicated research coordinator. Because research is so critical to the advancement of our specialty, two of our faculty members have time dedicated to research-only endeavors. Residents are routinely involved both in clinical trials and their own research projects, and often present at national meetings.\n\nEducation Focused\n\nOur mission is not limited to our residents, as we also support an IR technologist training program—one of only a handful in the country. The training environment includes all pertinent aspects of running a clinical Interventional Radiology practice, like dedicated education on E&M and CPT coding, documentation, and perspectives from hospital administration."
