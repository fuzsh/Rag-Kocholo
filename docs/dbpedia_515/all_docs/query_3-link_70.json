        "text": "The Peach State has 159 counties to explore, but southwest Georgia is largely a still-undiscovered region by travelers. Here, you’ll find rich history, with connections to presidents and the Civil Rights Movement, and natural wonders like canyons and natural springs. The great outdoors also beckon, with backcountry camping and dark sky parks for undisturbed stargazing.\n\nBut, one of the biggest reasons to visit the region is to learn about President Jimmy Carter, perhaps the best-known resident of this part of the state. Spend a weekend exploring the southwest Georgia communities that he calls home: Plains and Americus. You’re sure to be charmed by these small towns that are filled with presidential landmarks and welcoming residents who are proud of their famous neighbor.\n\nFollow this three-day guide to Plains and Americus to plan a trip that includes must-see Carter presidential landmarks as well as other highlights in the region.\n\nFriday\n\nStart your trip to southwest Georgia in the city of Americus, with its charming historic downtown filled with shops and restaurants. You might know Americus as the international headquarters of Habitat for Humanity, the nonprofit organization that builds homes around the world and with which the Carters have had a long relationship. The town is also where Charles Lindbergh made his first solo flight, and it’s home to Koinonia Farm, which was a big part of the Civil Rights Movement in the region.\n\nCheck into the iconic Windsor Hotel, originally built in 1892 and identifiable with its brick turret-like design. The Presidential Suite is the best room, honoring President and Mrs. Carter, who were present for the hotel’s reopening in 1991. Other famous guests have included gangster Al Capone, and reportedly, some ghosts have been known to haunt the halls. If you’re looking for a homey atmosphere, stay at the Americus Garden Inn, a Victorian 1847 home with seven luxurious suites.\n\nWhen you’re ready, head to dinner at one of the many Americus restaurants. Rosemary & Thyme located in the Windsor Hotel’s grand dining room is a popular spot, with menu favorites like steak and bourbon-glazed pork chops. After dinner, grab a nightcap at Floyd’s Pub, the hotel bar with a balcony overlooking downtown.\n\nIf you’d prefer something more casual, Gyro City Mediterranean Grill has gyros, burgers, and baklava. Or, enjoy dinner and live music at Pat’s Place, which has nachos, sandwiches, and pizza plus a full bar.\n\nSaturday\n\nWhen you’re ready to visit Plains, you have three choices for how to see the presidential hometown:\n\nBy vintage train ride on the Presidential Flyer SAM Shortline Railroad,\n\nBy two-hour van tour with Plains Tours, or\n\nBy car on your own.\n\n1. Take a vintage train ride\n\nThe Historic SAM Shortline Railroad line is a south Georgia staple, founded as the Savannah, Americus & Montgomery (SAM) Railway in the 1800s. The company later struggled financially and was sold, but in 2000, it was brought back as a tourist experience, bringing travelers through the region’s peanut farms and pecan groves to small towns with exciting stories to tell. It offers a variety of themed and seasonal trips, including the Presidential Flyer, which includes stops in downtown Plains, allowing time to explore the shops and restaurants, and in nearby Archery to explore the Boyhood Farm.\n\nThe Presidential Flyer train leaves from Georgia Veterans State Park in Cordele, visiting Plains and returning to Cordele in historic air-conditioned cars named for the nearby towns. There are four classes of seats, including basic Coach as well as Deluxe, Premium, and Chairman’s Class, which comes with drinks, snacks, and lunch.\n\nIf you choose the train ride, the day starts at 9:30 a.m. and ends at 4:30 p.m. with a two-hour layover in Plains and a 40-minute stop in Archery. The dates for this train ride vary, so check the schedule before you go. Tickets start at $39.99 for adults and can be booked online. The train is wheelchair-accessible; contact the railroad to book tickets.\n\nAfter your train ride, explore Georgia Veterans State Park, established in 1946 to honor the state’s armed forces veterans with memorials and a museum featuring uniforms, weapons, and other military memorabilia. It’s part of Lake Blackshear Resort & Golf Club, which has campgrounds, cabins, golf courses, a marina, and an archery range. The resort has multiple restaurants, like Cordelia’s, which has views of the lake and serves favorites like steaks and seafood. The Cypress Grill at the marina is open seasonally with live music and burgers. Or, grab a drink at 88’s Lakeside Bar. Outside of the resort, Daphne Lodge Restaurant is a local favorite that serves steak and seafood in a 1970s-style home.\n\n2. Take a van tour\n\nPlains Tours is a local company that offers van tours of the historic landmarks in Plains. Passengers from the SAM Shortline train can book the Sam’s Express tour, a 45-minute van tour that visits landmarks during the train’s layover in Plains before hopping back on the train. Tickets can be purchased the day of your visit, but online in advance is recommended.\n\nThe Classic tour is a two-hour guided van tour that leaves from the Visitor Information Center in Plains. This tour goes to the top landmarks in town, including the three locations of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park, where you’ll have a chance to get out of the van and explore the sites. There are also photo stops at the smiling peanut statue and the new butterfly mural in town. Tickets should be booked in advance.\n\nPrices range from $25 for the Sam’s Express tour and $49 for the Classic tour. Custom tours also are available for $200. (Note, the vans are not wheelchair-accessible.)\n\n3. Drive your car on a self-guided tour\n\nIf you’re traveling independently, start your trip at the Visitor Information Center in Plains, located right as you come into town on US Highway 280. The building resembles a home and features items related to the Carters, like the presidential seal and brochures about what to see in town. Pick up a map and get helpful tips from the staff about how to spend your day in Plains. Outside the center, you’ll find a location on the Rosalynn Carter Butterfly Trail, a project of the First Lady’s that promotes habitat for butterflies across the United States and worldwide.\n\nFrom there, visit the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park, which comprises the museum inside his former high school, his boyhood farm and the historic Plains Depot. At the high school, rooms have been restored to what they would have looked like when he was a student before he graduated in 1941 and went on to attend Georgia Southwestern College in Americus. There’s also a replica of his presidential desk and a bag from the Carter peanut farm among the exhibits about his and Rosalynn’s lives.\n\nNext, tuck into the historic Plains Depot, which was the town’s train station and later served as Carter’s 1976 presidential campaign headquarters. The small museum has buttons, signs, and other memorabilia from his political run.\n\nThe boyhood farm where Carter grew up, a short drive from downtown, features a restored white farmhouse filled with period furnishings. The general store that his father operated is stocked with canned goods and other essentials the family and their neighbors would have needed. Give yourself plenty of time to explore the outbuildings.\n\nWhen you’re ready for a bite, head to Buffalo Cafe, a former bank building in the heart of downtown Plains. The restaurant has local memorabilia and serves burgers and sandwiches, but don’t miss the fried green tomatoes. Afterward, indulge your sweet tooth with the famous peanut ice cream at Plain Peanuts before browsing the antique shops where you can see vintage Carter campaign buttons.\n\nOutside of town, snap your photo at the smiling peanut statue on GA-45 North, inspired by President Carter’s likeness. The roadside attraction was built in 1976 to support Carter’s presidential campaign. It was originally located at the Plains Depot but was moved to its current location near the Carters’ church in 2000 after being damaged in a car accident.\n\nAfter a day of soaking up history, return to Americus to check out the shops, like The Maze, a sprawling store with booths selling a variety of gifts. Then, catch dinner downtown and a show at the Rylander Theatre, where the auditorium is named in honor of Jimmy Carter. The circa 1921 theater hosts plays and live music.\n\nSunday\n\nGet up early and put on your Sunday best for services at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, where President Carter regularly taught Sunday School for decades, during which he would discuss scripture and world events. The church was founded in 1977, and the Carters have been active members since then.\n\nAlthough Sunday dining options are few, there are some great spots to grab a bite between Plains and Americus. Bonita’s Restaurant in Plains has a Sunday buffet with Southern home cooking and desserts. In Americus, Gladys’ Kitchen serves hearty Southern fare like fried chicken, collard greens, and macaroni and cheese. The 1800 Mexican Restaurant is a popular spot for tacos, fajitas, and margaritas.\n\nAfter your presidential experiences in Plains, set out to explore the other famous landmarks around southwest Georgia like Providence Canyon State Park, known as the state’s “Little Grand Canyon.” Located about one hour west of Plains, Providence Canyon spans more than 1,000 acres, and the namesake canyon, in orange hues, goes to 150 feet deep. You can go on hikes, visit the museum, and stay at one of the campsites. It’s also great for stargazing. The $5 parking fee grants admission.\n\nOther points of interest nearby include:\n\nAndersonville National Historic Site (approximately 20 minutes northeast of Americus)\n\nPasaquan (approximately 40 minutes northwest of Americus)\n\nRichland Distilling Company (approximately 40 minutes west of Americus)\n\nRadium Springs Gardens (approximately 50 minutes south of Americus)\n\nThings to know before you go"
