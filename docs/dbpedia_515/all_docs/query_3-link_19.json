        "text": "This song reminds me of Hope and Promise. The song starts off \"We come together on a special day,\" which automatically makes me think about uniting people or bringing together a community. It also reminds me of cleaning! LOL! Waking up on a Saturday morning hearing this song blasting through the house instantly meant Mah was in full-on cleaning mode and that she had a list of chores for me to do as soon as I got up.\n\nThis song and I go WAY back. My pops used to groove to this one when I was a kid! And even though this tune came out way before my time, it's an evergreen tuneâan anthem that will always have meaning and relevance for centuries to come. There is no other song out there that can do the two things that this song does for my soul: soothe and galvanize. Those shimmering strings and bells coupled with the otherworldly limpid, smooth vocals of Curtis Mayfieldâthey soothe me when I'm troubled. And in that same stroke, those prophetic words of Curtisâenjoining me to \"get on board\" this virtuous train of freedomâthey galvanize me in my resolve to do good by this world. Their message inspires me to be decent. To be honorable. To be just. And to have faith.\n\nIn other words, this song says to me, \"Calm yourself, childâ¦but get up, because there's work to be done.\" And Lord have mercy, I know that's true! You see, this tune was released in 1965 at the height of the Civil Rights movement. But nowâ52 years laterâwe still have a long way to go. And I'm convinced that if we all act on this song, we might just get there.\n\nBeing just another kid from Chicago, I can't even put in words just how much my heart swells with pride in knowing that Curtis Mayfield & The Impressions are Chicago's very own. They have left a profound legacyâboth musically and sociallyâto which ALL Chicago musicians such as myself ought to pay homage and carry on. But let me tell youâthose are some very big shoes to fill!\n\nI moved back home to Chicago in 2006, and the city was bursting with energy for then-Senator Obama, the new Millennium Park, and the White Sox. Wilco's beautiful, dirge-like I Am Trying to Break Your Heart was a favorite of mine and when I heard JC Brooks' version in 2011, after Barack Obama became President, there was so much joy it in. Felt like a street festival, like a summer bike ride. It really echoed the excitement and love I felt for my city during the end of the '00s, and that I still feel every time I'm able to return home.\n\nFolk might remember President Obama singing Sweet Home Chicago, but that's not the only reason why it's one of our favorite Chicago songs. Instead, it was a rendition by another leader, Mayor Harold Washington, that always makes us smile. He broke out in song on stage during his re-election victory speech in 1987 with such joy and warmth that washed away the ugly divisive campaign (the hard years of his first term). Sadly, we lost him just seven months later. Who knew that 25 years later we would be singing it in the White House!\n\nThe very day that I decided that I was moving to Chicago to start my life post-grad-school, I got in my car, turned on the radio, and Sweet Home Chicago came on. I knew it was a sign that I had chosen well. I started my career in the neighborhoods of Pilsen and Little Village, organizing community groups in the Catholic parishes there. I ended up running a legal services program for immigrants, which ultimately took me to D.C., the civil rights movement and, to my astonishment, President Obama's senior White House team. I will always feel lucky that my sense of home and neighborhood was shaped by the immigrant neighborhoods of Chicago. My first-born is starting her career there now too... Sweet home, indeed!\n\nI met Common in the elevator at the Met Ball. I asked him if I could interview his mom for a Yahoo Beauty story I was doing for Mother's Day. He put his number in my phone, and totally followed through. To me, Common is what being a Chicagoan is about. He's a real, regular guy in a rockstar body.\n\nI used to work at Young Chicago Authors, and I'd see Ravyn come in and perform this song. It was also on a lot of our pre-Wordplay (our open mic on Tuesday evenings) playlists. The song has so many layers and emotions in it, a lot of self-consciousness, which I feel like is so relatable and often missing from music. When I'm missing Chicago, I put this song on: It reminds me of summer Tuesday evenings crowded in YCA's space. Wordplay is an incredible event â everyone is so supportive and clinging on to your every word. It's actually radical, to have people listening as closely to you as they do at YCA. It's magical. And when I think of being active in my community, when I think of people who I love, a lot of that centers around spaces like YCA that I have been a part of. And it centers around a radical listening, taking the time to encourage each other, to listen to each other even when people are different than you. And this song is so magical, and very much in that spirit.\n\nFinding love on the campaign trail isn't easy. But that is exactly what happened to us in 2008, and to so many other \"Obama couples\" to come out of the last ten years. Amidst the long hours and dedication to a historic campaign, our shared passion for Chicago and a shared belief in the power of Democracy grew into something more. When we listen now to Chicago's own Jennifer Hudson singing \"and I am telling you\" we hear the drive, perseverance, and resolve that are the hallmarks, not only of our own campaign and personal experience, but also the qualities of our entire amazing city and every last one of its inhabitants who are dedicated to staying and devoted to making it ever better.\n\nWe play it on flights every now and then. Probably more than once. It means a lot of all of us because it brings to mind all of the things that Chicago is about: itâs about family, itâs about people, about enjoying everything the city has to offer. Itâs a great city to be a part of â itâs my kind of town."
