        "text": "SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) — This time at the Olympics, hammer thrower Annette Nneka Echikunwoke got to compete. Not only compete, but win a medal — for the United States.\n\nThree years ago, Echikunwoke arrived at the Tokyo Games ready to represent Nigeria, but she wound up needing to leave before even getting to take a throw. Nigeria was among a handful of countries deemed “high risk” by track’s anti-doping regulators in the lead-up to those Olympics — forcing its athletes to be subjected to more drug testing.\n\nEchikunwoke was among those from Nigeria who did not meet the requirement and so was not allowed to participate.\n\nThe 28-year-old was born in Ohio and originally decided to represent Nigeria because that’s where her parents are from. But after the issues in 2021, she switched her Olympic country to the U.S., and on Tuesday night became the first American woman to earn Summer Games medal in the hammer, getting a silver.\n\nEchikunwoke was in the early lead before Canada’s Camryn Rogers won the gold on her second-to-last throw.\n\n“I think (this medal) could have happened three years ago, but I’m happy it’s happening now,” Echikunwoke said. “I feel like everything happens for a reason, even if it’s bad or good or ugly or whatever the case may be. This is beautiful.”\n\nShe remembers that time in Tokyo so vividly, such as not being able to walk in the opening ceremony.\n\n“Not the best feeling, as you could imagine,” said Echikunwoke, who went to the University of Cincinnati.\n\nEchikunwoke’s application to change what country she would compete for finally came through at the last minute before the U.S. nationals in 2022, and she earned a spot for the world championships that year.\n\nNow, she’s an Olympic medalist for the red-white-and-blue.\n\n“It doesn’t feel real right now,” she said. “I can’t really put it into words.”\n\nEchikunwoke led after the third round Tuesday with a throw of 75.48 meters (247 feet, 7 inches). Rogers, though, threw the hammer 76.97 (252-6) on her second-to-last attempt to overtake her. Bronze went to Zhao Jie of China.\n\nStill, a wonderful Olympic experience for Echikunwoke after what transpired in Tokyo.\n\n“I was depressed, definitely, for a couple months after,” she said. “It’s not always been easy. There’s definitely days where I’m like, ‘Why am I doing this?’”\n\nFor nights like this, of course.\n\n“I feel like there’s so many dreams in my heart that are still going to come about, and I’m so excited to just be in this moment,” she said. “This is Dream No. 1.”\n\nAnd Dream No. 2?\n\n“We’ll see,” Echikunwoke said. “I’ll let you know what happens.”\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games"
