        "text": "Family Medicine Residency Programs\n\nWelcome! We invite you to explore our residency programs. We offer training in family medicine and preventive medicine. Our programs emphasize holistic healthcare and provide residents with opportunities to collaborate in a multidisciplinary clinical environment. UMass Chan Medical School residents can choose to train at one of several sites, from a small-town practice to urban community health centers. Our more than 400 graduates currently practice throughout New England, across the United States, and around the world.\n\nWorcester, centrally located in Massachusetts, is the second largest city in New England. Fitchburg is a small urban community 20 miles north of Worcester while Barre is a picturesque rural New England town 20 miles west. The central geographic location of these communities offers convenient access to a wide range of educational and cultural facilities and events. I invite you to contact our residency directors to learn more about each individual program. We are committed to providing you with a rewarding residency experience.\n\nOur Residency Programs"
