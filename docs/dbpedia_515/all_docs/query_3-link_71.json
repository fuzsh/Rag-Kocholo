        "text": "You’ve probably heard it countless times: your data is out there. “Every time you open an app, you send about maybe 500 kilobytes of data to their servers,” says Patrick Jackson, chief technology officer at the tracker protection company, Disconnect. “That is equivalent to about 125 pages of text that you would print in a printer.”\n\nCompanies are capitalizing on all that data. The data broker industry, which consists of companies that collect your information and sell it, is worth about $200 billion dollars. Your data is a valuable commodity.\n\nIn today’s day and age, even signing up for an app means you may be agreeing to share your data. It may seem like the only option to protect your privacy is to go off the grid, but as digital privacy and anti-surveillance advocate Matt Mitchell says, “privacy isn’t a switch, it’s a dial.” There are easy steps you can take to protect more of your data.\n\nClear your activity history\n\nAccounts like Google and LinkedIn store your data and search history. You can manage and erase some of this information by going to myactivity.google.com or an applications’ privacy and security settings.\n\nGet a browser extension\n\nOne of the main ways your data is tracked and shared is through cookies. When you click “accept cookies,” you give permission for browsers to track––and potentially sell–– your information to data brokers.\n\nHowever, there are browser extensions such as Privacy Badger that “eat” these cookies, getting rid of tracking cookies and stopping websites from seeing what other sites you might be browsing. This can help mitigate further tracking.\n\nChoose a safe password\n\nEven if you think you have a clever password, hackers are very good at getting information about you from data brokers, such as your hometown or street name.\n\nYou should opt for a strong and unique password that uses a combination of both words and numbers. It should also be long: seven character passwords can be figured out in a few seconds, whereas 12 character passwords with a mix of uppercase letters and numbers can be a lot harder to crack. A passphrase consisting of a string of random words is even more secure, and easier to remember.\n\nUse two factor authentication\n\nEven if hackers can somehow guess your password, you can also add an extra layer of security: two-factor authentication."
