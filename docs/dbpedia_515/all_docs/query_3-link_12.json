        "text": "BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WBKO) - Patrick Folker, the co-owner of The Runners Lounge, has become an important part of Bowling Green’s running community. Known for his dedication and genuine care for runners of all levels, Folker is more than just a business owner—he’s a mentor, a friend, and an integral part of many runners’ journeys.\n\n“Three years ago, I walked in here as a super undisciplined runner, forever injured,” said Autumn Luntzel, a local runner. “Patrick was instrumental in my transformation. He provides a place for all runners to come and vent, make plans, or just feel supported. It’s more than just shoes; he truly cares about everyone who walks through that door.”\n\nLuntzel’s story mirrors the experiences of many others who have found support and guidance at The Runners Lounge. Folker’s influence is profound in their development and training from casual runners to those training for marathons.\n\n“I was looking for more community and structure in my running. Patrick knew my name before I even walked in the door,” said Rosie O’Connor, another local runner “He’s one of the most welcoming and encouraging people I know. He helped me believe in my big goals, even when I was doubtful.”\n\nThis sentiment of encouragement and personal connection is a recurring theme among those who frequent The Runners Lounge.\n\nFolker’s journey into the running world was also a personal one.\n\nFollowing a back surgery, Folker was advised by his doctor that running would help in the recovery process. He was skeptical at first but took the advice and has been a prolific runner ever since; taking others along with him to enjoy the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.\n\n“It’s just nice to hear that I’m actually helping people,” Folker said. \" You just do what you can and then you plant the seeds and then hopefully something will grow from that.”\n\nOne of those seeds was opening a shoe store in the Bike Rack Bistro and a restaurant he and his wife Crystal own and operate.\n\nOriginally called The Lounge, it was a room in the restaurant that evolved from a recreational space to a bike repair room and then a small shoe store renamed The Runners Lounge. Eventually, the shoe store outgrew the room in the restaurant and moved to its current location, strategically placed along a common Bowling Green Marathon route.\n\n“We wanted to help others fall in love with the sport for the sake of their health—both physical and mental,” said Jeff Galloway, Folker’s business partner, and friend. “Our goal was to create an outlet for helping more people, whether it’s through the right pair of shoes, training plans, or mentoring.”\n\nThe new location focused on their clients’ holistic well-being, blending shoe fittings with advice, injury treatment, and recovery services.\n\n“I want people to love their bodies and love themselves because it becomes greater, it becomes greater than them. It’s important for their spouse and children that their mom or dad live a long, healthy life. That is not being selfish. That is being grateful to your family,” Folker said.\n\nThe local running community is grateful for Patrick’s guidance and expertise as he encourages them to improve their skills and contribute positively to the community.\n\n“Patrick has always been there to guide me, ensuring I could complete a full marathon and inspiring me to give back to the sport,” said Harlan Holmes, another local runner.\n\nA lover of nature and being outdoors, Folker’s philosophy extends beyond running, encompassing overall well-being and safety.\n\n“I think nature has a natural rhythm to it, and then when you run you become a part of that natural rhythm of nature,” Folker said. “You breathe in a rhythm, your heart beats in a rhythm, your feet are a rhythm, and then you just kind of get in tune with nature.”\n\nFolker offers free running clinics to anyone in the community, driven by his desire for people to love their bodies and love themselves. Additionally, he recognizes the safety concerns for female runners and provides free self-defense classes, sharing his knowledge as a black belt in karate.\n\n“I would much rather train a woman, a mom of two, how to defend herself as opposed to a guy who may wind up in a bar fight because of his ego,” he said.\n\nHe takes the time to listen to every person, working with them to make a plan that fits their needs and abilities.\n\n“To me, it’s just a natural process of how to do things, of how to live. It doesn’t really matter if it’s running or martial arts or whatever. It’s just sharing ideas and that idea grows,” Folker said.\n\nDespite the pain, sweat, and tears involved, Folker wishes everyone could experience the benefits of running.\n\n“Running. It’s tough, it’s tough, but it makes people better people when they become runners. If you’re not a runner, start running. If you are a runner, don’t quit. It’s that simple,” he said."
