        "text": "The Frio River Band plays an eclectic mix of original music, traditional and new country. and just a little bit of classic rock thrown in for fun.\n\nThe band’s musical influences vary as much as our personalities. Some of us like classic rock like Jethro Tull, Tom Petty, and Emerson, Lake, and Palmer. Still others like the traditional country sound like Hank Williams, Sr., Willie Nelson, and Merle Haggard. Lastly, some of us like Texas country like Pat Green, Curtis Grimes, and Whiskey Myers.\n\nMost of all though, we just like being the Premier Country Band in East Texas! We like playing music together, and just giving our fans an overall hometown show played by hometown people. The Frio River Band members are live music fans first and musicians second. That really gives us a unique perspective when it comes down to playing live.\n\nWe hope you will find the time to come visit us at one of our live shows at a venue near you soon. Maybe even come on up, say hey, and request a song!\n\nDon’t forget that you can sign up for our mailing list (we PROMISE we won’t spam you) on any of our pages. we hope you’ll take the time to do that so we can inform you of upcoming live shows."
