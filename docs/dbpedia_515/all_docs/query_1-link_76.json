        "text": "Artist Information\n\nBen Burgess is the pride of East Dallas, a renaissance man with a golden pen. After landing his first career cut with Jonas Brothers' “Chillin' In the Summertime,” he packed up a blossoming career born between his hometown and Austin's 6th Street to chase dreams in Los Angeles, but quickly relocated to Nashville when his twang got too loud for the West Coast. Burgess started writing with Warner Chappell Music Publishing in 2015, where he stockpiled cuts including the BMI 2020 Country Song of the Year, 7X platinum “Whiskey Glasses,” Tyler Rich's gold “The Difference,” Pat Green's Texas radio #1 “Drinkin' Days,” Lil Wayne's “Dreams,” Martin Garrix & Troye Sivan's platinum “There for You,” Dierks Bentley's “My Religion,” HARDY's “SIGNED, SOBER YOU,” and more. His tracks have landed TV placements on ABC's Grey's Anatomy and commercial spots for Major League Baseball, Xbox, and Lexus. Breaking out as an artist in his own right, Burgess signed to Big Loud Records in 2020, and in the same year, was featured on Diplo Presents Thomas Wesley's buzzy Chapter 1: Snake Oil album on “Heartbreak.” He was also part of HIXTAPE: Vol. 2's “Red Dirt Clouds” alongside David Lee Murphy and labelmate ERNEST. In 2022, Burgess released his debut album Tears the Size of Texas and opened tours for Koe Wetzel, Warren Zeiders, and Jelly Roll. He’ll support headline runs by Larry Fleet and Kolby Cooper in 2023 while writing more new music."
