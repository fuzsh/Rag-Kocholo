        "text": "Zach Bryan was a notable snub at last year’s CMA Awards, but that isn’t the case for 2023. The rising country music star is one of the five nominees for New Artist of the Year announced Thursday, along with Jelly Roll, Parker McCollum, Megan Moroney, and Hailey Whitters.\n\nThe 27-year-old will find out if he’s a winner during the ceremony on November 8. He currently holds the No. 1 song and album on the Billboard charts.\n\nBryan was dismissive of the Country Music Association and its annual awards show following his omission in 2022, saying, “I don’t and will never want to be considered at the CMAs.” However, the panel couldn’t overlook the U.S. Navy veteran’s rapid ascent through the genre.\n\nBryan followed in the footsteps of legendary country artists like Alan Jackson, Tim McGraw, Kenny Chesney, and Brad Paisley with a breakthrough ACM Award for New Male Artist of the Year in May. He burst onto the scene with his 2022 triple album American Heartbreak, which debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200.\n\nBest known for his single “Something in the Orange,” Bryan released a self-titled album in August featuring collaborations with Kacey Musgraves, The Lumineers, The War and Treaty, and more. He’s also preparing for an extensive 10-month tour starting in March 2024 with guests such as Jason Isbell and Sheryl Crow.\n\nAlthough he’s now a force in the genre, Bryan has had an unusual path to stardom. Read on to learn more about the Oklahoman’s musical journey."
