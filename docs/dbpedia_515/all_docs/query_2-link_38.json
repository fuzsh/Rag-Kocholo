        "text": "Don’t miss the Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Pat Green live at Ruidoso Downs Race Track on Saturday, July 15, 2023.\n\nGet your tickets now!\n\nCredited as one of Texas country’s modern-era founding fathers, Green has traveled many roads in the 25 years since his debut album, Dancehall Dreamer. A singer-songwriter with a restless creative spirit, his career has gone beyond the bounds of a “country star” to include the work of a painter, sculptor, philanthropist, family man, and more. But one constant has remained – his vision.\n\nCombining Southwestern country traditions with the rebellious spirit of rock ‘n’ roll and adding in a poet’s literary flourish, Green’s vision brought the organic, true-to-yourself Texas style to the country mainstream in the early 2000s. With watershed tracks like “Carry On,” “Three Days,” and the Grammy-nominated Top 5 Billboard Country Airplay hit, “Wave On Wave,” he’s gone on to sell more than two million records and notch a string of Top Ten hits on the Billboard Country Radio chart, 12 Number Ones at Texas radio, a headlining sell out of the Houston Astrodome and tours with Dave Matthews Band, Willie Nelson, Kenny Chesney, and others."
