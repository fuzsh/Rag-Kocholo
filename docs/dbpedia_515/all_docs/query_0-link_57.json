        "text": "Riley Green has been compelling Country music fans to raise a drink, shed a tear, and, above all, celebrate where they are from, since first releasing his self-titled EP in 2018 with Big Machine Label Group. His songs like the No. 1 PLATINUM hit “There Was This Girl,” the 2X-PLATINUM-certified heart-tugger “I Wish Grandpas Never Died” (which he performed live at the 55th ACM Awards), and his chart-topping collab with Thomas Rhett, “Half of Me,” have made Riley synonymous with what Country music does best: making listeners feel something with his no-gimmick, relatable writing and classic feel.\n\nAn avid sports fan, former athlete (Jacksonville State University quarterback) and outdoorsman, Riley is riding a wave of success after being named the Academy of Country Music’s 2020 New Male Artist of the Year, a former MusicRow Breakout Artist of the Year, a CMT “Listen Up Artist,” and one of CRS’s 2020 New Faces. Playing to an average of 65,000 fans each night serving as direct support for Morgan Wallen and Luke Combs last year, and headlining the Rock The South festival, Green is now selling out his own headlining shows and even put on his own festival with the inaugural Duckman Jam at Flora-Bama in April of this year.\n\nHis latest full-length studio album Ain’t My Last Rodeo, produced by Dann Huff, is more of the signature Riley Green fans have come to know and love from the good ol’ boy who still lives in his hometown of Jacksonville, AL. The project, which includes his third No. 1 single “Different ‘Round Here (Ft. Luke Combs)” as well as his single, “Damn Good Day To Leave” is heavily influenced by the rural, small town and slower way of life at home and time spent with his family. He recently released more music in the form of an EP titled Way Out Here."
