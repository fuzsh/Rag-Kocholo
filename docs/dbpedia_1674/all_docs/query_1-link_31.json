In her ten seasons with the Bulldogs, White has guided the ‘Dogs to three 20-win seasons, five postseason appearances and four appearances in the Mountain West tournament championship game. White holds a .571 winning percentage (104-78) in Mountain West games and has an overall .556 winning percentage at Fresno State (177-141).\n\nIn her tenth season, Coach White finished on the stronger side, exceeding last season overall and conference win total early on. Strong leadership from Coach White brought the 'Dogs back to the quarterfinal round of the Mountain West Tournament, for the first time in the last two seasons. Closing out the season on a high note, freshman Taija Sta. Maria and newcomer Mia Jacobs earned MW post season honors, All-Freshman Team and All-MW Honorable mention, respectively.\n\nIn her ninth season, Coach White would see her toughest conference record at Fresno State, going 3-15 and a first round elimination to Nevada in the Mountain West Tournament. Fresno State would close out the season on a three game losing streak going 39% from the field (663-of-1701), 29% from the three (163-of-552) and 74% from the foul line (396-of-530).\n\nIn the 2021-22 season that was shortened by nearly a month, and saw cancelations, postponements and program shutdowns across the country due to Covid-19, the ‘Dogs successfully played 28 of its 30 scheduled games and avoided any program shutdowns during the pandemic while finishing with a 17-11 record (12-6 MW). Under unprecedented conditions, White guided the Bulldogs back to the postseason as one of 32 teams selected to the WNIT. The ‘Dogs also returned to the MW Championship game, following an upset of top-seeded New Mexico in the semifinals. Fresno State’s offensive production increased to 77.8 per game which ranked 13th in the nation, second-highest in program history. The Bulldogs’ efficiency also moved up to 45.2 percent, 26th nationally, and fourth-best at all-time at Fresno State.\n\nIn a season that was shortened by nearly a month, and saw cancelations, postponements and program shutdowns across the country due to Covid-19, the 'Dogs successfully played 28 of its 30 scheduled games and avoided any program shutdowns during the pandemic while finishing with a 17-11 record (12-6 MW). Under unprecedented conditions, White guided the Bulldogs back to the postseason as one of 32 teams selected to the WNIT. The 'Dogs also returned to the MW Championship game, following an upset of top-seeded New Mexico in the semifinals. Fresno State's offensive production increased to 77.8 per game which ranked 13th in the nation, second-highest in program history. The Bulldogs' efficiency also moved up to 45.2 percent, 26th nationally, and fourth-best at all-time at Fresno State.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, Haley and Hanna Cavinder were named to the All-MW Team. Haley was tabbed as the conference's Player of the Year. It was the first time league history that a player had won the award a year after being selected Freshman of the Year.\n\nWhite's sixth season in Fresno was a banner year as she guided the Bulldogs to a 25-7 record on the program's first MW regular season championship with a 16-2 record, and only third outright regular season conference title. The 'Dogs also reached their third MW championship game in five seasons. White's team won its first 15 games of league play, the second-longest win streak to open a season for Fresno State. The Bulldogs also won 14 consecutive games from Dec. 28-Feb. 15, a streak that is also second in the program's history. The wins added up as Fresno State averaged its highest scoring average (76.1 ppg) in more than 30 years and posted its second-best free-throw percentage (76.2%) behind only last season's school record. Limiting turnovers was key to the team's offense, breaking program records for assist-to-turnover ratio (1.30) and turnovers per game (12.1).\n\nThe Bulldogs racked up their most postseason honors in a season (9) as White was named Coach of the Year, Maddi Utti was selected Player of the Year and Haley Cavinder was tabbed Freshman of the Year. It was just the second time in conference history that a team claimed all three awards in the same season.\n\nLed by Candice White in 2018-19, the senior paced the MW in scoring for the second season in a row with 18.4 points per game, the Bulldogs earned their third trip to the WNIT under White. The 'Dogs finished the year with a 19-13 record after placing fourth in the MW while reaching the semifinals of the conference tournament for the sixth time in their seven seasons in the league. Fresno State averaged 69.7 points per game, the highest during White's tenure. The Bulldogs' scoring was aided by the team shooting a program-record 78.4 percent from the free-throw line.\n\nWhile Candice White earned her second All-MW selection in her final season, Maddi Utti garnered a honorable mention nod. The sophomore was also selected to the MW All-Defensive Team after being the only player in the league to rank in the top 10 in rebounds, blocks and steals.\n\nWith her youngest roster to date, White navigated the 2017-18 season by starting three true freshmen in 24 games, the most of any Division I team during a year in which they finished 17-15. Fresno State finished fourth in the league (11-7) to earn a first-round bye in the tournament for the fifth time in its six years in the conference. The ‘Dogs returned to the postseason with a bid to the Women’s Basketball Invitational where they captured the program’s first postseason win in a true road game at CSU Bakersfield, 77-66.\n\nJunior Candice White led the young group of Bulldogs as she garnered All-MW honors after leading the team in points, rebounds, assists and steals while being one of the most well-rounded players in the conference. She became just the second Fresno State player to score more than 600 points in season (605). Joining the junior with postseason accolades were freshmen Aly Gamez and Maddi Utti who were both named to the MW All-Freshman Team after being instant impact players for the Bulldogs as each ranked second or third on the team in points, rebounds, assists and steals.\n\nThrough an up-and-down 2016-17 season in which the 'Dogs finished 18-15, White's team came together late in the season to propel it to a run of three wins in three days at the MW Tournament to reach its second-straight championship game. Along the way, the Bulldogs became the first No. 7 seed to defeat a No. 2 seed, and the lowest seed to reach the championship game in tournament history.\n\nThe Bulldogs were led by two-time MW Defensive Player of the Year, Bego Faz Davalos, and a breakout season from sophomore guard Candice White who earned All-MW honorable mention honors. Faz Davalos ranked in the top 10 in the NCAA in seven stat categories while breaking multiple season and career records at Fresno State and in the Mountain West. White ranked 15th in the NCAA in free-throw percentage and 37th in 3-point percentage. The sophomore's 87.7 percent from the free-throw line set the Fresno State single-season record while also moving into the top 10 in points in a season, 3's made in a season and career 3-point percentage.\n\nWhite's 2016 squad went 22-12 overall and reached the second round of the WNIT with a 59-53 win over Santa Clara. It was the second consecutive season with a postseason victory for the Bulldogs, a first in the program's history.\n\nA year after turning Fresno State into one of the top defensive teams in the Mountain West, White's defensive brand of basketball set a program low for opponent field-goal percentage (.371) and allowed 59.4 points per game, the team's lowest since 2006 and the third lowest in program history. A big piece to that was the shot blocking of Bego Faz Davalos who was named MW Defensive Player of the Year after leading the NCAA with 136 blocked shots.\n\nFaz Davalos also garnered postseason All-MW honors along with Toni Smith who earned honorable mention accolades and Breanne Knishka who was selected to the MW All-Freshmen Team.\n\nIn her first season, White guided the ‘Dogs to their seventh consecutive season of 20 or more wins (23) and to the postseason for the eighth consecutive year, reaching the second round of the Women’s National Invitational Tournament. The team’s 79-73 win over San Francisco at the Save Mart Center in the first round of the WNIT was the program’s first postseason win since 2006.\n\nDuring the middle of the season, White’s group recorded the second-longest win streak in Fresno State’s history at 13 games, an unbeaten stretch that lasted nearly two months. The final win of that streak gave the ‘Dogs a 17-3 record to open the season, a mark that ranks as the best 20-game start in school history.\n\nIt took White little time to put her stamp on the Bulldogs’ defense as her squad was the only team in the conference to finish in the top two in the Mountain West in scoring defense, field goal percentage defense, 3-point percentage defense, blocks and steals during the conference season. The ‘Dogs led the MW in scoring defense (55.8 ppg), 3-point defense (.259), block shots (5.7 bpg) and steals (12.3 spg).\n\nUnder White’s tutelage, a trio of Bulldogs garnered a total of five postseason conference honors, with Alex Sheedy highlighting the group after being named Co-Player of the Year. Sheedy was subsequently also selected to the All-MW team. Fellow senior Raven Fox earned Sixth Player of the Year and was named to the All-Defensive Team. After breaking three conference records for blocked shots, Bego Faz Davalos earned a spot on the All-Freshman Team.\n\nPRIOR TO FRESNO STATE\n\nWhite was hired on April 16, 2014 to be the 10th head coach in the history of the Fresno State women's basketball program, coming to the central valley after eight seasons as the head coach at Northern Colorado, where in her time in Greeley she built the Bears from the ground up into a team that made postseason play in three out of the last four years. She was the 2010-11 Big Sky Conference Coach of the Year and is the winningest head coach in Northern Colorado history. After helping NC transition from Division II to Division I, White led Northern Colorado to a 72-54 record in her last four seasons and tallied 117 wins overall.\n\nAt Northern Colorado, White was able to guide the Bears back into the postseason by turning her squad into a perennial contender in the Big Sky Conference. In her eight seasons, she led teams to a total of four appearances in the Big Sky Championships, including three of the last four.\n\nAfter sharing the 2010-11 Big Sky regular season championship, Northern Colorado advanced to its first-ever NCAA Division I postseason appearance when it participated in the Women's Basketball Invitation. The following two seasons, White led NC into the WNIT, which was highlighted by the Bears' first-round victory over Wyoming in 2012 - the programs first-ever Division I postseason win.\n\nWhite's teams showed continual improvement, increasing their win total in four of the past five seasons and included in that was 20-win campaigns in 2011-12 and 2012-13. The Bears only had two 20-win seasons in the first 32 years of program history before White took over in 2006-07. Her 2012-13 team finished the campaign with a 21-13 overall record, tying the school record for wins in a season. A total of 15 players garnered All-Big Sky accolades and 43 were All-Academic team members during her tenure at Northern Colorado.\n\nWhite has prior experience coaching in the Mountain West from her days as an assistant at Utah (2001-03) and Wyoming (2003-06). In her second season at Utah, she helped guide the Utes to the Mountain West regular season championship and into the NCAA Tournament second round. Utah finished that season with a 24-7 overall record. In her three seasons at Wyoming, White helped the Cowgirls win their first conference tournament game in 12 years (2004) and to a first-round WNIT victory over Oregon State (2006). That 2006 Cowgirl team finished the season with a 21-9 overall record.\n\nWhite also has previous head coaching experience from her days at the junior college ranks, when she coached Snow Junior College from 1996-01. In five years, she led the Badgers to a 107-50 record and back-to-back Scenic West Athletic Conference Championships in 1999-00 and 2000-01. In 2000, the Badgers finished with a 27-6 record and a final ranking of No. 13. In 2001, Snow tallied a 30-3 record and was ranked 12th in the final poll. For her efforts, White was named the 2000 Scenic West Coach of the Year and the Snow College Coach of the Year. Every year during her tenure at Snow, the Badger teams improved their win total. In addition to the team's success on the court, the Badgers were the Academic Team of the Year in 1999, 2000 and 2001.\n\nPLAYING EXPERIENCE\n\nWhite graduated from Utah Valley Community College in 1989 where she played for coach Tom Perkins. At Utah Valley, she was named a Kodak All-American after she led her team to a final 16 appearance.\n\nWHAT THEY ARE SAYING ABOUT JAIME WHITE\n\nConnie Yori, University of Nebraska Head Women's Basketball Coach\n\n\"I've watched Jaime's programs from afar for quite a number of years. I'm very impressed by the way they run their motion offense and the style of play that she's put forth at Northern Colorado. I think she is a person of really good character, high integrity and she's a first-class hire for Fresno State.\"\n\nLisa Bluder, University of Iowa Head Women's Basketball Coach\n\n\"I think this is a great hire for Fresno State. Jaime has been in our game for a long time and has worked extremely hard to not only be a successful basketball coach, but also to be a great mentor for young women and that is what I have been most impressed with is her ability and desire to help young women grow in their leadership skills and their life skills.\""
