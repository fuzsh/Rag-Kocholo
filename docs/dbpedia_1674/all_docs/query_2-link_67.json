Saturday's regionally-televised matchup at 2:30 p.m. (CDT) from Memorial Stadium/Tom Osborne Field actually is the fifth Big 12 Conference encounter played in August. On Aug. 31, 1996, Kansas State began Big 12 football competition with a 21-14 home win over Texas Tech. Texas downed Missouri 40-10 in Austin that same date.\n\nOn Aug. 30, 1997-the co-earliest starting date in league annals-Oklahoma State defeated Iowa State 21-14 in Ames while last year on Aug. 31 ISU toppled Kansas 45-3 in a national telecast (Fox Sports Net) to open conference contests.\n\nThe full-slate action this week, featuring six telecasts, starts at 11 a.m. (CDT) with a split-national telecast between Missouri and Illinois of the Big Ten Conference at St. Louis' Edward Jones Dome.
