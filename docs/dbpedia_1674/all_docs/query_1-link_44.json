        "text": "Rebels projected as high as No. 2 in the preseason for first time since 2001.\n\nLAS VEGAS (UNLVRebels.com) -- UNLV football tied a school record by being picked to finish second in the Mountain West in the preseason media poll, which was released Wednesday to kick off the league's annual Media Days at Circa Resort in downtown.\n\nThe Rebels, who received four first-place votes and 471 points overall, only trailed Boise State's 543 total points. Those same two teams played in last year's Mountain West Championship game at Allegiant Stadium. The only other time UNLV was picked to finish as high as second was before the 2001 season after John Robinson's Rebels downed Arkansas in the 2000 Las Vegas Bowl.\n\nHeading into 2024, Fresno State was picked third (460), Air Force fourth (384), Colorado State fifth (337), Wyoming sixth (296), Utah State seventh (285), San Diego State eighth (251), Hawai'i ninth (214), San Jose State 10th (185), New Mexico 11th (85) and UNR 12th (77).\n\nUnder the direction of 2023 Mountain West Coach of the Year Barry Odom, the Rebels will kick off their 57th season of football on August 31 by heading to Big 12 Conference member Houston at 4 p.m. PT on FS1 in the first of a school-record 11 national TV games. The home opener comes one week later when Utah Tech comes to Allegiant Stadium for a noon kickoff on September 7.\n\nSeason tickets, three-game mini-plans and single-game tickets for the six-game 2024 home schedule are available now by visiting unlvtickets.com or calling (702) 739-FANS (3267). For information on VIP premium club seats or suites at Allegiant Stadium, contact the Premium Sales office at premiumseating@unlv.edu or by calling (702) 895-0292."
