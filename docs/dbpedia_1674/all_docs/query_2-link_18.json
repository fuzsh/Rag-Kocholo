        "text": "We've reached the final week of college basketball's regular season with the and still playing for a potential share of the Mountain West title. Meanwhile, the Wolf Pack women are one win away from clinching a bye at the conference tournament, which a win over last-place San Jose State on Tuesday would secure. Almost all of the questions in this week's Monday Mailbag center on college basketball, so let's get to them. Thanks, as always, for the inquiries.\n\nHere are the odds for Mountain West teams reaching the NCAA Tournament's second round:\n\n1. San Diego State— 52.1\n\n2. Utah State — 27.6\n\n3. Boise State— 18.1\n\n4. Nevada— 11.3\n\n5. UNLV— 8.0\n\n6. New Mexico— 5.8\n\n7. Colorado State— 5.0\n\nI would go:\n\n1. San Diego State (this program has proven it can win NCAA Tournament games)\n\n2. New Mexico (I love the Lobos' ceiling; I hate the floor)\n\n3. Nevada (especially if the Wolf Pack keeps shooting the three-ball this well)\n\n4. Boise State (I'm concerned about the guard play and bench)\n\n5. Utah State (best non-conference win is over San Francisco)\n\n6. Colorado State (if only it was playing at the form we saw in non-league)\n\n7. UNLV (unless it wins the conference tournament, UNLV is not getting in the Big Dance)\n\nBut like you said, a lot of this comes down to matchup and health.\n\nWhere I would seed them:\n\nSan Diego State (No. 5)\n\nUtah State (No. 5)\n\nNevada (No. 7)\n\nBoise State (No. 7)\n\nColorado State (No. 9)\n\nNew Mexico (Last Four In)\n\nWhere I project them to be seeded right now:\n\nSan Diego State (No. 4)\n\nUtah State (No. 6)\n\nBoise State (No. 7)\n\nNevada (No. 8)\n\nColorado State (No. 9)\n\nNew Mexico (Last Four In)\n\nColorado State did enough in non-conference that it should be in the field as long as it beats Air Force in its lone game this week and wins a first-round game in the MW Tournament, which would be against the Fresno State/Air Force/San Jose State tier. That should happen. New Mexico probably needs to win both games this week (Fresno State, Utah State) and two games at the MW Tournament (to reach the semifinals) to feel safe. Outside of the NET ranking, the Lobos'résumé isn't great. The two wins over Nevada make up 40 percent of New Mexico's five Quad 1 and 2 victories. I'll give the MW a 100 percent chance of four teams getting into the NCAA Tournament, a 90 percent chance of five teams and a 50 percent chance of six teams. And we'll throw in a 5 percent chance of seven teams if UNLV can win the MW Tournament.\n\nThe Big 12 is West of the Mississippi and is way better than the Mountain West. But the MW will at least tie the conference record with five NCAA Tournament bids with a great shot at six teams. We'll see how the conference does in the tournament. It hasn't had two teams win a game in the same NCAA Tournament in the last decade since the conference went to its current membership in 2013-14. If you want conference-wide recognition, teams other than San Diego State need to do something in the Big Dance. Maybe this is the year.\n\nIn terms of pure talent, I would take New Mexico's roster over any other in the Mountain West. That's why I think the Lobos have the highest ceiling. But the floor is also lower than most of the other Mountain West's top teams. That's been the case in each of the last two seasons. Richard Pitino is a good coach but not a great one. That was evident at Minnesota and again at New Mexico. He's elevated the Lobos' program, but if this roster doesn't get to an NCAA Tournament in back-to-back seasons, that's a problem. And main issue is New Mexico's defense. The Lobos' defense is improved this year but has allowed at least 118 points per 100 possessions in four of the last eight games after allowing that number zero times in its first 21 games. Defense was an issue last year, too. If you can't get stops, you're going to struggle to beat good teams. And as much as I like Jaelen House and Jamal Mashburn Jr., they rank first and second on the team in usage rate against top-100 NET teams but slot sixth and eight, respectively, in offensive rating against such competition. That's a problem.\n\nLast week I said a No. 5 seed, so I'll stick with that. That would tie the program's best NCAA Tournament seed. And I won't remind you what happened in that game. (Andrew Strait happened).\n\nI wouldn't beat on five or six NCAA Tournament teams every year moving forward, but the Mountain West has rebounded from its 2014-21 stretch when the league averaged1.86 NCAA Tournament bids per year. Over the last three seasons, it will be four bids, four bids and at least five bids. So, I think a floor of three moving forward is fair to expect. I wrote a long column , which is worth a read. One element of that story is the fact the MW has capitalized on the extra COVID season the last two years. Last year's San Diego State team that reached the national title game had a nine-man rotation that included five fifth-year seniors, two fourth-year seniors and two juniors. This year, six of the MW's top-10 scorers would not be eligible if not for the extra COVID year. So, when that extra COVID season dries up after 2024-25, that would disadvantage the MW. On the other hand, the Pac-12 dissolving makes the MW the West's power conference in basketball, which should help the league recruit players who want to play in a West-based league that keeps its travel reasonable. So, I think the MW is back to its late 2000s, early 2010s strength, but I would not consider it a power conference at this stage. It needs to do more widespread damage in the NCAA Tournament. That said, men's basketball is the MW's second-best sport other than cross country, so that's huge for the league.\n\nNevada, Boise State, New Mexico, Utah State, UNLV, Colorado State, Fresno State and San Jose State all played at San Diego State and at Wyoming. San Diego State did not play at Wyoming; Air Force did not play at San Diego State. So, all of the MW contenders except for SDSU played at Wyoming and at SDSU (the Aztecs obviously can't play themselves). As for the Friday games, playing a lot of those isn't a competitive disadvantage. Nevada only had to play MW-leading Utah State once, albeit on the road, so other than the Aggies, the Wolf Pack had the MW's most advantageous schedule of the top-seven teams.\n\nI have . That said, I don't think humans as underrating Nevada given the following data:\n\nHumans (media): 26th in the Top 25\n\nHumans (coaches): 27th in the Top 25\n\nSOR:37\n\nNET: 40\n\nKenPom: 41\n\nBPI: 58\n\nThe humans are quite a bit higher on Nevada than the rawrésumé data compiled by the computers. And there are two reasons for those lower computers rankings despite the 24-6 record: (1) Nevada has a non-conference strength of schedule of241, per KenPom, and 255, per BPI; and (2) Nevada is No. 40 in KenPom \"luck.\" The data above shows humans are giving Nevada a lot more \"love\" than the raw data suggests the Wolf Pack should get. Still, I don't see how anybody ranks South Florida, which is 1-0 in Quad 1 games and has two Quad 4 losses, over Nevada, yet the Bulls are ranked in both major polls this week. Probably because USF has gone 20-1 over its last 21 games. But the Bulls played the No.297 non-league strength of schedule and is 157th overall in schedule strength (Nevada is 97th).\n\nI don't know the particulars of his calf injury, so I can't answer this question without that information. If he's 90 percent or more and isn't at risk of worsening his injury, I'd play him this week. But the most important thing is getting Kenan Blackshear as close to 100 percent healthy as possible for the postseason. If I had to guess, I think Blackshear will play Tuesday at Boise State.\n\nYes, Nevada's home win over Colorado State dropped from a Quad 1 win to a Quad 2 game, which impacted the entire Mountain West as Nevada, San Diego State, Utah State, Boise State, New Mexico, UNLV and Wyoming all beat the Rams at home. Each team lost that Quad 1 win, at least for now, as Colorado State dropped below 30 in NET (it is currently 34). Utah State also fell out of the top 30 in NET (it's 36), which cost New Mexico, San Diego State and Utah State Quad 1 wins. Nevada could lose a Quad 1 win to Washington (72 in NET, must be top 75) but could pick up a Quad 1 win with its road victory at UNLV (82 in NET, must get into the top 75). The Drake loss has toggled between a Quad 1 and Quad 2 defeat with the Bulldogs at 48 in NET (cut line on that is 50 for a Quad 1 loss). Anyway, Nevada is in the NCAA Tournament, so I wouldn't deeply fret about these things. And I'd rather be a 10 seed than an 8 or 9 seed to avoid a potential second-round game with a No. 1 seed. You don't want to play Houston, UConn, Purdue or Tennessee in a potential round of 32 game. Those are the country's four elite teams.\n\nIf you can't get excited about this Nevada men's basketball season, few Wolf Pack seasons will excite you. This is a top-10 season in Nevada's history even if the Wolf Pack loses out, and it's likely to end up a top-five season in program history that has already included thrillers with Colorado State, San Diego State, New Mexico, UNLV and Boise State and to a lesser degree against Wyoming, Georgia Tech, Hawaii and Washington. It's been a highly entertaining season with Nevada (at worst) a top 40 team in the country. I qualify a \"great\" season as winning a conference championship or NCAA Tournament game, so there's work to be done for \"great.\" But if this season hasn't \"amped\" you up, you're probably expecting too much.\n\nLike 10 percent.\n\nColorado State had an amazing non-conference against an elite schedule, so the Rams' early-season love was deserved. As the losses have mounted, the national credibility has wilted. I could see the argument that New Mexico has received more love than Nevada despite a similarrésumé for most of the season as the Lobos were ranked for three straight weeks in late January to early February. They also have the sons of two former NBA players and are led by the son of one of the nation's most famous coaches. So, that helps the recognition. As for UNLV, I don't think the Rebels have received much national attention.\n\nNevada men's basketball can finish anywhere from the No. 1 seed to the No. 6 seed in next week's conference tournament.\n\nNevada's six hardest games by NET this season have been: @San Diego State, @New Mexico, @Utah State, @Colorado State, vs. TCU and vs. Drake. The Wolf Pack lost three of those games (@SDSU, @New Mexico, vs. Drake) with the other three losses being at home against Boise State, at home against New Mexico and at Wyoming. If you swapped those losses, I don't think it'd help Nevada much because the Wolf Pack's Quad 1 record would take a hit. The Wolf Pack has avoided bad losses except for the game at Wyoming. Change that Wyoming loss to a loss at Utah State and maybe the Wolf Pack moves up a seed. But the difference wouldn't be huge.\n\nThat would take several days of research to answer. But I will just say NET is one metric. Some people treat it like it's the only metric, but that's clearly not the case. If it was, New Mexico (NET 28) would be an NCAA Tournament lock rather than a bubble team.\n\nCould is the optimal word here. Any top-50 team in the nation could beat San Diego State at Viejas Arena. But I'm guessing only the national top 10 would be favored to win at Viejas Arena, and the number might actually be a touch smaller than 10.\n\nHunter McIntosh does not have one year of eligibility left. This is his final year of college since he returned to action last season.\n\nThe Wolf Pack seniors with the option for another year of eligibility areTré Coleman, Daniel Foster, Tylan Pope and K.J. Hymes. I expect all of them to return for another year of college in 2024-25. Coleman is the top prospect of that group but could make similar money in NIL at Nevada as he would do playing professionally.\n\nI'll put it at a 3 percent chance Nevada's 10 eligible scholarship players return to Reno next season. If you're Jeriah Coleman, who has played 52 minutes this season, why would you come back to Nevada? PLus, the Wolf Pack could make some moves to free up scholarship spots for incoming transfers.\n\nIt will be hard to get stronger than this season, but the Mountian West should remain excellent. Jaedon LeDee (No. 1 scorer), Jarod Lucas (No. 3), Sam Griffin (No. 5 scorer), Isaiah Stevens (No. 6 scorer), Jaelen House (No. 9 scorer) and Kenan Blackshear (No. 10 scorer) are all out of eligibility, so that's six of the league's top-10 scorers gone. More important is keeping coaches year after year to build continuity. If the MW retains nine of its 11 coaches (I imagine Fresno State's Justin Hutson is gone and maybe one other coach gets poached), that's a good result. If that happens, the MW should remain a three- to five-bid league. So, I'll call for a moderate step back but nothing major as the league will still have a ton of fifth-year seniors thanks to the COVID-19 extra season.\n\nSteve Alford runs a motion offense, some of which stems from his college head coach, Indiana's Bobby Knight, who wrote an influential 29-page manual titled “Motion Offense” in 1975.\n\n“He really changed college basketball,\" . \"You look at the motion offense and people everywhere used it. Then they started to get away from it, and now it’s coming back. I molded everything we do from practices to academics to community service, how you represent the school around what Coach Knight did.”\n\n5.\n\n4.\n\n3.\n\n2. (Nevada used these in 2017-18 with a larger logo before using a similar design Friday)\n\n1.\n\nThe worst were the 2017-18 . Those were atrocious.\n\nI was not at that game. And there's a \"no cheering in the press box\" rule, so I'd like to think I would have kept my composure. But if any player (home or road) banked in a 3-pointer at the buzzer to win a game, I think the natural reaction would be to have some kind of reaction. That happens maybe once a college basketball season.\n\nForget about all-time. Just look at this season. Of Nevada's 30 games this year, the Wolf Pack has had 11 games decided by four points or fewer/overtime. That's an incredible rate of close-game affairs. If I ranked the top-10 thrillers for Nevada this season, it'd go:\n\n10. Air Force 75, Nevada 71 (Nevada cuts 12-point deficit with 2:39 remaining to two but can't complete comeback)\n\n9. Colorado State 54, Nevada 51 (Wolf Pack fails to foul in final 15 seconds of regulation as Rams ice game)\n\n8. Nevada 63, Fresno State 62 (Nevada goes on late 7-0 run before holding off two late 3-pointers by Mia Jacobs)\n\n7. Nevada 72, San Diego State 71 (SDSU can't get shot off down one with possession and seven seconds remaining)\n\n6. UCSB 73, Nevada 66, OT (Claire Jacobs hits a deep 3-pointer at regulation buzzer to send game to overtime)\n\n5. Nevada 58, Boise State 57 (Wolf Pack forces turnover in final second to seal win)\n\n4. Weber State 57, Nevada 55 (Kaylee Borden misses potential game-winning three at buzzer)\n\n3. Nevada 68, Boise State 65, OT (Tori Davis hits deep 3-pointer as regulation expires to force overtime after Boise State misses two free throws; Broncos miss game-tying three with 3 seconds left in overtime)\n\n2. Nevada 67, Central Arkansas 65, OT (Claire Jacobs' game-winner with 1.7 seconds left in overtime)\n\n1. Nevada 83, New Mexico 82 (Lexie Givens and-one and free throw with 0.7 seconds remaining for the win)\n\nThis happened before the 2015-16 season. Women's teams who call timeout with possession and 59.9 seconds or less on the clock in the fourth quarter or overtime have the option of advancing the ball to the frontcourt. Without that rule, maybe half the thrillers listed above don't happen. I like the rule. I wouldn't mind if the men's game adopted it. It'd add more late-game drama.\n\nI love the question, but it's tough to answer because NIL deals are not privy to public-records requests, so there's no transparency to compare one school to the next. My guess would be $1 million a year in women's basketball and $350,000 in volleyball would make the Wolf Pack a Top 25 team and potential national contender. Shall we start a GoFundMe for the Wolf Pack?\n\nAnother good question. Another one I have no answer to. Almost everything to do with NIL is under a veil of secrecy. I would hope the athlete gets at least two-thirds of that money.\n\nI'd probably say I grew up a UCLA fan since I was born in Southern California, but I don't really have an affinity for any league. I do enjoy the Mountain West. I'm lucky to cover such a strong league.\n\nThe XFL is no more. It's now called the \"United Football League\" after merging with the USFL. The rosters are out and RB Toa Taua is on the Michigan Panthers while LB Gabriel Sewell Jr. is on the Houston Roughnecks. .\n\nI don't think the Pac-2's goal was to avoid putting all its eggs in one basket. The Mountain West never invited the Pac-2 to join the conference in the other sports, and I don't disagree with the move. In men's basketball, in particular, it could have watered down the league. The Pac-2's alignment of joining the MW in football and the WCC in other non-baseball sports makes sense for Washington State and Oregon State from a travel standpoint and the MW from a logistical standpoint. On the whole, the MW's non-football sports are stronger than the WCC's, but that's largely because of men's basketball. Other than that, there's not a huge difference. The MW's other sports are almost all one-bid caliber other than cross country and sometimes softball or volleyball.\n\nSailing, motorcycles, chess, darts,archery, bowling, ultra-endurance sports. In college, the only sport where men and women compete against each other is rifle, so toss that in there, too.\n\nUNLV announced last week a $6.5 million gift fromBoyd Gaming and the Boyd Family toward the construction of an indoor practice facility used for football and other sports. That puts the Rebels at $8.2 million in announced gifts toward this project. This is an area where Nevada has lagged. Certainly, Northern Nevada doesn't have as many high-level businesses as Southern Nevada, and it's worth noting the that the Wolf Pack men's program would play in. But the inability of the Wolf Pack to build an indoor football practice facility over the last 20 years is arguably the department's greatest embarrassment this century. Some of the lack of private donations is the constant turnover in the Wolf Pack athletics department at the lead fundraiser role, but even when there was stability there, it never got done. and are both moving forward with indoor football practice facilities. Those are FCS teams. Nevada is way behind the curve.\n\nSee y'all next week!\n\nSports columnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
