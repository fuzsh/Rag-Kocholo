        "text": "The came and went last week with one notable move from a Mountain West player. Colorado State's Nique Clifford opted to return to school for a second senior season, bolstering the Rams' roster. After our initial for the 2024-25 season, here is our post-early-early deadline update, which includes several teams continuing to add to their rosters via transfer additions.\n\n1. Boise State\n\nLast season: 22-11, 13-5 (tied for second place; lost in NCAA Tournament's First Four)\n\n2024-25 outlook: The Broncos are the lone MW team to return two All-MW players in Tyson Degenhart (16.7 ppg, 6.2 rpg) and O'mar Stanley (12.7 ppg, 6.6 rpg). Three starters departed, including two via transfer (Chibuzo Agbo to USC; Roddie Anderson III to Xavier). But SJSU PG transfer Alvaro Cardenas (13.2 ppg, 5.5 apg) is the perfect addition with NAIA SF Javan Buchanan and two-time Arizona Gatorade Player of the Year C Dylan Anderson potential starters. SF Andrew Meadow was solid as a freshman and helps to form a strong six-player group. Depth might be an issue; it usually is with Boise State. But the Broncos have a good starting five and winning pedigree (three straight NCAA Tournament berths; 20.7 wins per season under coach Leon Rice).\n\n2. Nevada\n\nLast season: 26-8, 13-5 (tied for second place; lost in NCAA Tournament's first round)\n\n2024-25 outlook: The Wolf Pack lost its top-two scorers to graduation (Jarod Lucas, Kenan Blackshear), but the cupboard isn't bare. Nick Davidson (12.2 ppg, 7.3 rpg) was third-team All-MW with room to grow as this year's offensive focal point. Tré Coleman (8.5 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 2.8 apg) is a two-time All-MW defensive team honoree who will get more opportunities offensively. K.J. Hymes, Daniel Foster and Tyler Rolsion add depth and experience as role players. And Nevada was strong in the transfer portal, adding potential starters in Cal Poly CG Kobe Sanders (19.6 ppg, 3.2 apg), Fresno State SG Xavier DuSell (11.5 ppg, 39.5 3PT%); Texas State PF/C Brandon Love (10.4 ppg, 5.4 rpg); and Portland PFYuto Yamanouchi-Williams (8.6 ppg, 5.2 rpg). Any step back should be minimal.\n\n3. New Mexico\n\nLast season: 26-10, 10-8 (tied for sixth place; lost in NCAA Tournament's first round)\n\n2024-25 outlook: New Mexico was No. 1 on this list until losing JT Toppin to Texas Tech, with Toppin entering the portal late in the process. That was a major loss, but the Lobos are still strong with talent. Donovan Dent (14.1 ppg, 5.4 apg) is arguably the MW's best lead guard, and Nelly Junior Joseph (8.9 ppg, 8.2 rpg) is one of its top bigs. Co-sixth man of the year Mustapha Amzil (6.7 ppg, 3.5 rpg) is back along with Tru Washington (6.6 ppg, 3.3 rpg), who was one of the league's top freshmen. North Texas CG C.J. Noland (10.9 ppg) was a solid addition, and New Mexico added size with Filip Borovicanin (Arizona) and Atiki Ally Atiki (BYU), who are both 6-9. Georgia Tech transfer Ibrahima Sacko has potential. A solid prep class also enters the program. Talent is not usually an issue here. Maximizing it has been. This is probably the MW's most talented roster again.\n\n4. Utah State\n\nLast season: 28-7, 14-4 (first place; lost in NCAA Tournament's second round)\n\n2024-25 outlook: For the second straight season, it's a major rebuild under a first-year head coach at Utah State. Danny Sprinkle pulled off a miracle in his one season in Logan; Jerrod Calhoun, formerly at Youngstown State, will try and do the same. Calhoun starts in a stronger position than Sprinkle with the return of SG Mason Falslev (11.3 ppg, 4.4 rpg) and SG Ian Martinez (13.3 ppg, 3.6 rpg). Both entered the transfer portal before returning to school. C Isaac Johnson (6.6 ppg, 3.1 rpg) also is back. That's three starters from last year's MW championship team. TransfersDexter Akanno (Oregon State); Deyton Albury (Queens, NC); Aubin Gateretse (Stetson); Drake Allen (Utah Valley); Tucker Anderson (Central Arkansas); and Braden Housley (Southern Utah) add depth and competition.\n\n5. Colorado State\n\nLast season: 25-11, 10-8 (tied for sixth place; lost in NCAA Tournament's first round)\n\n2024-25 outlook:Niko Medved doesn't usually lean heavily on Division I transfers, but this offseason has bucked that trend. The Rams have had a lot of success importing talent from the D-I ranks this spring, which is needed given the loss of PG Isaiah Stevens (16 ppg, 6.8 apg). SF Nique Clifford (12.2 ppg, 7.6 rpg, 3.0 apg) bypassing the draft was huge, boosting the Rams up a spot from last month's rankings. You could argue for a higher placement, butStevens meant so much to CSU, it's hard to forecast how his departure will impact the Rams. CSU has added transfers Ethan Morton (Purdue); Keshawn Williams (Northern Illinois); Bowen Born (Northern Iowa); Jaylen Crocker-Johnson (Little Rock); and Nikola Dapa (LIU), so there's talent despite the Rams losing four starters (Clifford is the only one back).\n\n6. UNLV\n\nLast season: 21-13, 12-6 (fourth place; lost in NIT's quarterfinals)\n\n2024-25 outlook: MW co-freshman of the year Dedan Thomas Jr. (13.6 ppg, 5.1 apg) is a player-of-the-year candidate and one of the nation's top point guards. Jalen Hill (10.7 ppg, 6.1 rpg) returns from a torn ACL, which he suffered seven games into last season. He spent four years at Oklahoma before that and should be one of the league's better wings. PF/C Rob Whaley (7.6 ppg) also is back.Transfers Jaden Henley (DePaul); Jace Whiting (Boise State); Jailen Bedford (Oral Roberts); andJulian Rishwain (Florida) add depth to the backcourt on one of the MW's smaller teams in usable size. SG Brooklyn Hicks is another backcourt option. This roster seems a little light to contend for a MW title, but it's a postseason contender.\n\n7. San Diego State\n\nLast season: 26-11, 11-7 (fifth place; lost in NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16)\n\n2024-25 outlook: It isn't very likelySDSU will finish seventh, although it placed fifth last year with a much more proven roster. The last time the Aztecs placed seventh in the MW was2000-01, the second year of the conference's existence. But SDSU hasn't had a great offseason with MW player of the year (media vote) C Jaedon LeDee graduating andPG Lamont Butler (Kentucky), Micah Parrish (Ohio State) andElijah Saunders (Virginia) transferring. Only two players from the 2023 national runner-up roster remain — Miles Byrd (3.6 ppg in his career) and Demarshay Johnson Jr. (0.6 ppg). SDSU lost seven of its top-eight scorers from last year, the exception being SG Reese Dixon-Waters (9.6 ppg), who lost his starting job midway through MW play. The Aztecs have added some mid-level transfers in Nick Boyd (Florida Atlantic); Jared Coleman-Jones (Middle Tennessee); Wayne McKinney III (San Diego) andKimo Ferrari (Brown), but will need some young and inexperienced players to become instant hits to get a bye in the 2025 MW Tournament (top-five seed).\n\n8. Air Force\n\nLast season: 9-22, 2-16 (tied for 10th place)\n\n2024-25 outlook: Air Force lost its leading scorer to transfer for the second straight season, which is especially painful given the Falcons can't poach players from the portal. This has to be a developmental program, and when you develop good players and lose them without being able to replace them, it's tough. Gone are Rytis Petraitis (15.7 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 3.7 apg) and Kellan Boylan (7.5 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 2.1 apg) to Cal and Lipscomb, respectively. But the Falcons had zero seniors who scored a point last season, so everybody else is eligible to return. SF Beau Becker (13.8 ppg), SG Ethan Taylor (13.5 ppg) and SG Jeffrey Mills (9.1 ppg) are all quality players who should improve. Air Force will be more competitive next season despite two key losses. Joe Scott's squad is 14-59 in MW games during his current four-year run, so this is a huge season for his program.\n\n9. Wyoming\n\nLast season: 15-17, 8-10 (eighth place)\n\n2024-25 outlook: The Cowboys were one of three MW schools to change head coaches this offseason, but Wyoming's came by far the latest when it hired Sundance Wicks to replace Jeff Linder, who accepted an assistant job at Texas Tech. Wicks inherited a roster that lost its top-six scorers from last season. There was a reason Linder left the program, after all. G Kobe Newton (4.5 ppg) is the top returning scorer. The Cowboys have added five transfers, but two of the top commitments — Tyree Ihenacho (Washington) and Yuto Yamanouchi-Williams (Nevada) — flipped after the coaching chance. Denver PF Touko Tainamo (15.2 ppg, 7.7 rpg), Hampton SG Jordan Nesbitt (10.2 ppg, 4.3 apg, 4.9 rpg) and Fort Lewis College SG Obi Agbim (15.5 ppg) should have the biggest impacts of the newcomers. Wyoming is up two spots from last month's rankings as Wicks has rebuilt the roster.\n\n10. San Jose State\n\nLast season: 9-23, 2-16 (tied for 10th place)\n\n2024-25 outlook: San Jose State lost its top-three scorers to transfer in MJ Amey (LMU), Alvaro Cardenas (Boise State) and Tibet Gorener (SMU) with No. 4 scorer (Trey Anderson) graduating. G Latrell Davis (5.7 ppg) and C Adrame Diongue (4.8 ppg) are the top returners, plus Tim Miles is a good coach, which lifts SJSU above our bottom team. The Spartans have added three transfers with MW experience in PG Donavan Yap, Jr. (Fresno State); SG Josh Uduje (Utah State); andPF Sadraque NgaNga (Seton Hall via Boise State). Also entering are two Pac-12 transfers in CGWill McClendon (UCLA) and C Chol Marial (Oregon State). The Spartans have added some nice pieces this spring, but it's a major year-over-year flip and last year's team went 2-16 in league play with a more talented roster.\n\n11. Fresno State\n\nLast season: 12-21, 4-14 (ninth place)\n\n2024-25 outlook: Fresno State's entire rotation graduated or jumped into the transfer portal following the Bulldogs' coaching change, leaving Vance Walberg with a lot of production to replace. He did get ex-Nevada player Jalen Weaver (7.4 ppg) to recommit to the program, but Fresno State lost its top-five scorers and eight of its top nine. Walberg has added Division I imports Mor Seck (Hawaii) and Elijah Price (Drake), but they scored a combined 76 points last season. Lower-level transfers Amar Aguillard (Triton College) and Alex Crawford (San Diego City College) will be counted on for major production, which doesn't seem like a formula for success. This roster was decimated after its coaching change. The still lists only eight players for next season.\n\nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
