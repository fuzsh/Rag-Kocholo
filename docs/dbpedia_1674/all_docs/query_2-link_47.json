Graduate senior RB Calvin Tyler Jr. led all rushers in the game with 129 yards on 24 carries for his third-straight 100-yard game.\n\nLegas was 9-of-12 passing for 85 yards and a 32-yard touchdown to senior WR Justin McGriff that gave Utah State a 7-3 lead with 1:54 to go in the first quarter.\n\nMcGriff finished with a game-high 63 yards on four receptions, while junior WR Terrell Vaughn had a game-best six catches for 48 yards.\n\nDefensively, junior ILB MJ Tafisi had a team-high 12 tackles, including 1.5 tackles for loss, while graduate junior DE Daniel Grzesiak had five stops, including 3.5 tackles for loss and 3.0 sacks – both career highs – to go along with a forced fumble, pass breakup and quarterback hurry. Senior ILB AJ Vongphachanh added nine tackles, including 0.5 tackles for loss, one pass breakup and one quarterback hurry.\n\nColorado State struck first courtesy of a 23-yard field goal by Michael Boyle with 11:45 to go in the opening quarter.

Colorado State (3-4, 2-1 MW) needed just five plays to march 73 yards to paydirt, capped by a 13-yard touchdown pass from Todd Centeio to Gary Williams, cutting the deficit to 26-24 with 3:31 left.\n\nUtah State had the opportunity to run the clock out, but after gaining one first down, the Rams forced the Aggies to punt the ball back to them.\n\nColorado State took over on its own 15-yard line and following three straight completions from Centeio, the Rams were on the Aggies' 39-yard line. On third-and-10 from the 39, Centeio completed a 15-yard pass to Ty McCullouch and it appeared as if CSU was going to ruin Utah State's Homecoming.\n\nAfter some confusion by the Rams, Colorado State eventually got its special teams unit onto the field and hurriedly lined up for a game-winning 42-yard field goal attempt. Fortunately for the Aggies, Cayden Camper's kick sailed wide left.\n\nColes had a career-best four field goals from 45, 30, 42 and 34 yards, respectively, to go along with two extra points for a career-high 14 points in the game for USU.\n\nBonner was 17-of-31 passing for 233 yards and the two touchdowns, both to senior WR Derek Wright.

Junior OLB Ajani Carter intercepted his second pass of the season and junior CB Michael Anyanwu had five tackles, forced a fumble, and recovered a pooch kick by the Aggies that led to a Coles field goal.\n\nFollowing a scoreless first quarter, both offenses came alive in the second.\n\nBonner threw touchdown passes of 25 and 38 yards, respectively, to give the Aggies leads of 7-0 and 14-7, respectively.\n\nThe Rams answered each Utah State score with touchdowns from Bailey.\n\nColes gave the Aggies the lead back for good when he drilled a 45-yard field goal to make it 17-14 with 1:30 to go.\n\nOn the ensuing kickoff, sophomore PK Elliott Nimrod pooched it toward the USU sideline. CSU failed to jump on the loose pigskin and Anyanwu recovered it for the Aggies on the Rams' 24-yard line.\n\nUtah State cashed in five plays later when Coles made good on a 30-yard field goal to give the Aggies a 20-14 lead at the break.\n\nGAME 5 RECAP vs. UCONN\n\nEAST HARTFORD, Connecticut - Sophomore S Ike Larsen blocked the potential game-tying extra point with 40 seconds remaining to help Utah State hold off UConn 34-33 on Saturday, Sept. 30, 2023, at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field.\n\nThe blocked extra point came after the Huskies (0-5) pulled to within one on a 1-yard touchdown run by Jelani Stafford. The score capped a nine-play, 85-yard drive for the hosts.\n\nGraduate senior QB Cooper Legas helped the Aggies (2-3) rally from down 17 points in the second quarter as he replaced starter McCae Hillstead in the third quarter after the freshman was injured on a late hit. The 17-point comeback for USU is tied for the fourth-largest in school history.\n\nUtah State also improved to 9-1 under head coach Blake Anderson in one-score games and notched its 13th come-from-behind win under Anderson, including its eighth when trailing by double digits.\n\nUtah State had six players make their first-career start in the game, including three along the offensive line due to injuries.\n\nLegas was 11-of-13 passing for 204 yards and a career-high-tying three touchdowns, including a 52-yarder to junior WR Jalen Royals that gave Utah State the lead for good, 31-24 with 12:36 left in the game.

Hillstead threw a 63-yard touchdown pass to graduate junior WR Colby Bowman with 14 seconds remaining on the clock to pull the Aggies to within 17-7. USU went 75 yards on just two plays for the score.\n\nPrior to that two-play drive, Utah State had just 22 yards of total offense and one first down in the game.
