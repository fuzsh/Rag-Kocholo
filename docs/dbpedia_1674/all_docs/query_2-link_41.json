        "text": "Tony Vitello (pronounced: vie-TELL-oh) accepted the position of head coach for the Tennessee Volunteers baseball program on June 7, 2017.\n\n\"This is as good of an opportunity as there is in the country,\" Vitello said after being hired. \"I consider myself incredibly blessed to be a part of the athletic department at the University of Tennessee. It's the ultimate combination of an elite conference, a state school with great in-state players, a phenomenal city and outstanding tradition that exists not just with baseball, but across all sports.\n\n\"It's no coincidence that it's been a place where so many great coaches have been leaders in their sport. I want to work like crazy to uphold that standard.\"\n\nSince taking over on Rocky Top, Vitello has led the Big Orange back to national prominence and has helped establish Tennessee baseball as an SEC and national power, leading the program to four NCAA regionals (2019, 2021, 2022, 2023), three NCAA super regionals (2021, 2022, 2023) and a pair of Men's College World Series appearances (2021 & 2023).\n\nA native of St. Louis, Missouri, Vitello arrived at UT following four seasons as assistant coach/recruiting coordinator at Arkansas. His rise to the head coaching ranks also included stops at Missouri (his alma mater) and TCU. He has earned a reputation as one of the elite recruiters on the college baseball landscape, having assembled 12 top-15 signing classes--including America's top-rated crop of talent in 2014. In November 2016, D1Baseball.com ranked Vitello No. 2, and tops in the SEC, on its list of the top 30 recruiting coordinators in America.\n\nDuring a full-time, Division I coaching career spanning 20 years, Vitello has signed and developed 10 first-round MLB Draft picks and a handful of players who have gone on to play in Major League Baseball. That list includes VFL Garrett Crochet, Andrew Benintendi, Brandon Finnegan, Kyle Gibson, All-Star Aaron Crow, Gold Glove Award winner and four-time All-Star Ian Kinsler and five-time All-Star and three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer.\n\nVitello, a two-time National Coach of the Year during his time at Tennessee, has recruited and developed four first-round picks during his tenure with the Vols, including Chase Dollander, who became UT's highest-drafted pitcher straight out of college in program history when he was selected by the Colorado Rockies with the No. 9 overall pick in the 2023 MLB Draft, besting Crochet, who was selected with the 11th overall pick in the 2020 MLB Draft and became the first player to go from the draft to the big leagues without playing in the minors since Mike Leake did so with the Reds in 2010.\n\nTennessee has had 35 players drafted since 2018 when Vitello took over as head coach, averaging nearly six picks per year. Since 2020, the Vols' 28 total draft picks lead the nation.\n\nAfter a record-breaking 2022 season that ended one win short of a return trip to Omaha, the Vols used a strong second half of the season to propel themselves on an impressive postseason run and reach the Men’s College World Series for the second time in three years in 2023, the program's second appearance under Vitello.\n\nThe Big Orange caught fire during their final five SEC series to secure a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Clemson Regional before knocking off Charlotte and No. 4 national seed Clemson to advance to the program’s third straight super regional. Once again, the Vols had to go on the road, but were able to dispose of Southern Miss in three games to book the program’s sixth trip to Omaha. UT went on to win its first CWS game since 2001 with a 6-4 victory over Stanford, snapping a six-game losing streak in Omaha.\n\nThe Vols had a program-record six pitchers selected in the 2023 MLB Draft, led by Dollander, who became the highest drafted player in the Vitello era after going No. 9 overall to the Colorado Rockies. In total, Tennessee had eight players chosen in the 2023 draft, which was tied for the second most in program history.\n\nTennessee cemented its reemergence as an SEC and national power in 2022, setting a new program record with 57 victories en route to winning SEC Regular Season and SEC Tournament titles. With Vitello in charge, the Vols have increased their win total during every full season since his arrival (29 – 2018, 40 – 2019, 50 – 2021, 57 – 2022).\n\nThe Volunteers achieved the program’s first No. 1 national ranking in any poll in week six of the 2022 season before settling in as the unanimous top-ranked team in week seven. UT was ranked No. 1 in at least one poll during 12 weeks of the season and spent 10 weeks as the nation’s unanimous top-ranked team.\n\nThe Vols led the nation in numerous statistical categories while setting a handful of program records along the way, including new marks for home runs (158), runs scored (613), RBIs (574), slugging percentage (.604), ERA (2.51), WHIP (1.00), opponent batting average (.199), strikeouts (695), strikeouts/nine innings (10.5) and walks allowed/nine innings (2.48), among others.\n\nUT was one win away from making its second consecutive College World Series appearance but fell to Notre Dame in the Knoxville Super Regional. However, the Big Orange won both the SEC Regular Season and SEC Tournament championships for the first time since 1995. The Vols won the SEC Regular Season title by six games, and the eastern division crown by 10 games, both of which are the largest margins in conference history.\n\nTennessee became the first NCAA Division I team since at least 1972 to lead the country in both home runs and ERA. The Vols’ 158 long balls shattered the previous program record of 107 while ranking fourth in NCAA Division I history, including the most by any team in the BBCOR bat era (since 2011). UT also led the country in runs scored (613), slugging percentage (.604), strikeout-to-walk ratio (4.24), WHIP (1.00), walks allowed/nine innings (2.48) and winning percentage (.864).\n\nVitello was named the Perfect Game National Coach of the Year for the second season in a row and was also tabbed as the Southeast Region Coach of the Year by the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA). The Vols set a program record with nine players earning postseason All-America honors, including four first-team selections, which was also a school record. Tennessee had four players earn Freshmen All-America honors, as well.\n\nSophomore pitcher Chase Dollander racked up the postseason honors following a dominant year on the mound, becoming the first UT player to be named SEC Pitcher of the Year and earn consensus first-team All-America honors since Luke Hochevar in 2005. Freshman right hander Chase Burns also brought home some national awards after being named the D1Baseball.com National Freshman of the Year, the NCBWA Freshman National Pitcher of the Year and the Collegiate Baseball Co-Freshman National Player of the Year.\n\nUT's 2022 record-breaking season was followed by an equally impressive showing in the 2022 MLB Draft, as a program-record 10 Vols were selected, ranking second among all schools nationally and first in the SEC. Outfielders Drew Gilbert and Jordan Beck were both taken in the first round, giving Tennessee multiple first rounders for the first time since 2007 when three Tennessee players were selected in the opening round. The Vols became just the fourth SEC team to have 10 or more players chosen in the first 20 rounds of any MLB Draft, joining the likes of Mississippi State, Texas A&M and Vanderbilt.\n\nTennessee continued its ascension through the college baseball ranks during an historic 2021 season. Vitello's Vols won 50 games for just the third time in program history, finishing with a 50-18 record while advancing to the College World Series for the first time since 2005. UT also hosted an NCAA regional for the first time since 2005 and hosted its first-ever super regional, sweeping LSU to punch its ticket to Omaha for the fifth time in program history. Tennessee's 50 wins were tied for the most in the country in 2021.\n\nUnder Vitello’s guidance, Tennessee won its first SEC Eastern division title since 1997 after posting a 20-10 record in league play and winning eight of its 10 conference series, including all five series on the road for the first time ever. The Vols also made their first appearance in the SEC Tournament Championship game since 1995 and advanced to back-to-back NCAA regionals for the first time since 2004 and 2005.\n\nVitello was named the 2021 National Coach of the Year by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association and Perfect Game, becoming just the second head coach in program history to earn that honor, joining legendary Vols’ skipper Rod Delmonico, who was named National Coach of the Year by Baseball America in 1995. Delmonico led Tennessee to three of its previous four trips to the College World Series (1995, 2001, 2005) and is the program’s career leader in wins with 699 during his time on Rocky Top. With an 11-6 win over Georgia on March 19, Vitello became the fastest head coach in program history to win 100 games with the Vols, overtaking Delmonico’s mark of 163 games. Vitello needed just 153 contests to accomplish the feat.\n\nTennessee was ranked for the entire 2021 season and checked in as high as No. 2 in the polls on multiple occasions—the program's highest ranking ever at the time. The Vols set a program record with 16 road victories and hit 98 home runs—second most in school history at the time. Tennessee also had five players earn All-America honors in 2021, another program record until it was broken in the 2022 season.\n\nFor the third year in a row, Tennessee was also well-represented in the MLB Draft. UT's seven total picks were tied for the sixth most among Division I programs, and at the time, were tied for the second most in a single draft in program history and marked the most Vols ever selected through the first 20 rounds of any draft.\n\nAfter leading the program back to the NCAA Tournament in 2019, Vitello and the Vols looked poised to take another step forward in 2020 after a strong start to the season. The Vols were ranked as high as No. 11 in the nation after a 13-0 start to the year and were 15-2 heading into SEC play before the season was halted on March 12 and eventually canceled due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. UT's No. 11 national ranking was its highest since being ranked No. 11 in the 2007 preseason poll.\n\nPrior to the season being canceled, Tennessee led the country in total runs (180) and runs per game (10.6) while ranking second in home runs (31), slugging percentage (.556), walks (124), on-base percentage (.442) and WHIP (0.94). The Vols were also among the national leaders in a handful of other statistical categories. Entering SEC play, 14 different players on Tennessee's roster had hit a home run, more than any other team in the nation. Nine players had multiple homers, led by the trio of Alerick Soularie (five), Zach Daniels (four) and Connor Pavolony (four).\n\nThe highlight of the shortened 2020 season was winning the inaugural Round Rock Classic in Round Rock, Texas. The Vols swept a loaded field that included No. 1 Texas Tech, Houston and No. 25 Stanford, outscoring those three teams by a combined score of 21-8. UT's 6-2 win over No. 1 Texas Tech to open the tournament was the program's sixth victory over a top-10 team and second over a top-ranked team since Vitello took over prior to the 2018 season.\n\nIn June's MLB Draft, Tennessee had three players selected, which was tied for second most in the SEC and fifth most in the nation. Crochet became the program's 17th first-round pick and the first under Vitello at Tennessee, going No. 11 overall to the Chicago White Sox. Alerick Soularie was taken in the second round by the Minnesota Twins and Zach Daniels was selected in the fourth round by the Houston Astros, giving UT three picks in the first four rounds for the first time since 2007. The 2020 draft was shortened to just five rounds due to effects stemming from the pandemic.\n\nTennessee took a major step forward as a program during Vitello's second season at the helm in 2019. The Vols went 40-21 overall and 14-16 in SEC play to finish third in the Eastern Division, the program's highest finish since 2005. Vitello led the Big Orange to their first NCAA regional since 2005, ending a 13-year drought.\n\nThe Vols exploded out of the gates in 2019 with the best start in program history, winning their first 15 games of the season. UT also won five series in SEC play (most since 2005) and finished the year with 26 victories over non-conference teams (most since 2000).\n\nTennessee was ranked in the Top 25 for 10 weeks, due in large part to having one of the nation's top pitching staffs and fielding teams. The Vols tied the program record with 10 shutouts (second in the country) and also finished among the national leaders in strikeout-to-walk ratio (ninth), WHIP (10th), walks allowed/nine innings (14th), ERA (19th) and fielding percentage (14th).\n\nUT's offensive production also saw an increase under Vitello in 2019. The Vols scored 378 runs, had 173 extra-base hits, hit 53 home runs and had a slugging percentage of .407, all marks that were the highest since 2010. Tennessee was one of the country's most proficient base stealing teams as well, leading all Power 5 programs with 108 stolen bases. Junior speedster Jay Charleston finished the year with 41 steals, becoming the first SEC player to steal 40-plus bases in a season since VFLs Chris Burke (49) and Stevie Daniel (46) both accomplished the feat back in 2001.\n\nTennessee also had six players selected in the 2019 Major League Baseball Draft, tying the most since 2015. Andre Lipcius (third round), Stallings (fifth round), Andrew Schultz (sixth round), Zach Linginfelter (ninth round), Ricky Martinez (18th round) and Charleston (26th round) were all among those picked. With the 83rd overall pick by the Detroit Tigers, Lipcius became the highest-drafted UT player since current Cincinnati Reds’ outfielder Nick Senzel went No. 2 overall in 2016.\n\nIn his first season at Tennessee, Vitello led the Vols to a 29-27 overall record and engineered an impressive turnaround from 2017 in SEC play. After winning just seven conference games in 2017, Vitello helped lead UT to 12 wins and three series victories in league play, including a sweep of Alabama and series victories over ranked foes Texas A&M and Kentucky. Tennessee posted a 9-6 record at home in SEC play, which was the program's best since 2005.\n\nUT's offensive numbers also saw a significant rise in Vitello's first season on Rocky Top as the Vols increased their season totals in runs, hits, home runs, extra-base hits, RBIs, slugging percentage, walks and on-base percentage in 2018 despite losing their top two hitters from 2017.\n\nArkansas stood among the most competitive programs in the nation during Vitello's four seasons in Fayetteville, averaging nearly 38 wins per year, winning 40 or more games three times, appearing in three NCAA Tournaments and advancing to the 2015 College World Series. That 2015 squad set a school record with a stellar .975 team fielding percentage.\n\nVitello coached 22 Razorbacks who were selected in four MLB Drafts.\n\nVitello's tenure with the Razorbacks was preceded by three seasons as an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at TCU (which was a member of the Mountain West in his first season [2011] before joining the Big 12). Prior to that, he was an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at Missouri (then a member of the Big 12) for eight years.\n\nIn his three years at TCU, Vitello lured some of the top players in the country to Fort Worth and helped the Horned Frogs to a pair of NCAA tournament appearances, including a super regional berth in 2012. The Horned Frogs started seven freshmen, recruited by Vitello, in the super regional at UCLA. His final recruiting class at TCU was ranked 17th in the country, and three student-athletes he signed also played for Team USA.\n\nDuring Vitello's eight years at Mizzou, the Tigers made the postseason seven times. He served as the pitching coach, while also working with the team's hitters and serving as the first base coach. Vitello's 2008 Missouri recruiting class was ranked No. 11 nationally by Baseball America, and he had top-25 recruiting classes in three of his final four years in Columbia.\n\nDuring his time as a Tiger assistant coach, Vitello recruited and developed 19 players who were drafted by major league teams, including major leaguers Kinsler, Scherzer, Crow, Gibson, Nick Tepesch, Doug Mathis and Justin James.\n\nVitello already boasts the incredibly rare distinction of having mentored both a National Hitter of the Year (Benintendi) and National Pitcher of the Year (Crow). Benintendi won the 2015 Golden Spikes Award as America's top amateur baseball player after batting .376 with 20 home runs, 57 RBIs and 24 stolen bases. Crow--who Vitello shepherded during his tenure on staff at his alma mater, Missouri--claimed the 2008 Roger Clemens Award following a campaign in which he won 13 games, posted four shutouts, totaled 127 strikeouts and at one point threw 43 consecutive scoreless innings.\n\nCrow became the highest MLB Draft pick in Mizzou history when the Washington Nationals selected him ninth overall that summer.\n\nBenintendi--drafted seventh overall by the Boston Red Sox in 2015 and the recipient of a $3.6 million signing bonus--is a prime example of Vitello's abilities in player development. From his freshman to sophomore season, Benintendi improved his batting average by 100 points and hit 19 more home runs. En route to National Player of the Year honors in 2015, he became just the third player in SEC history to lead the league in home runs and batting average. Just 421 days after being drafted, Benintendi was promoted to the Majors.\n\nA three-year letterwinner at Missouri (2000-02), Vitello earned Academic All-Big 12 Conference honors as a senior and was named to the Big 12 Commissioner's Honor Roll twice. Following his playing career and the completion of his management degree at MU, Vitello joined the Missouri coaching staff as a volunteer assistant in 2003 and completed his course work for his master's degree in business. In 2004, he was elevated to full-time assistant coach.\n\nVitello served as the associate head coach for the Salinas Packers of the California Collegiate League in 2002. The Packers finished 50-14 and earned their first trip to the NBC World Series in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nVITELLO'S NCAA APPEARANCES\n\n2023 College World Series*\n\n2022 NCAA Knoxville Super Regional*\n\n2021 College World Series*\n\n2019 NCAA Chapel Hill Regional*\n\n2017 NCAA Fayetteville Regional\n\n2015 College World Series\n\n2014 NCAA Charlottesville Regional\n\n2012 NCAA Los Angeles Super Regional\n\n2011 NCAA Fort Worth Regional\n\n2009 NCAA Oxford Regional\n\n2008 NCAA Coral Gables Regional\n\n2007 NCAA Columbia (Mo.)

UT went on to win its first CWS game since 2001 with a 6-4 victory over Stanford, snapping a six-game losing streak in Omaha. As has become the norm, Tennessee boasted one of the country’s top pitching staffs and finished the year ranked among the top five nationally in ERA (2nd – 3.63), WHIP (2nd – 1.16), strikeout-to-walk ratio (2nd – 4.03), shutouts (3rd – 9), total strikeouts (3rd – 738), strikeouts per nine innings (3rd – 11.7), hits allowed per nine innings (4th – 7.51) and walks allowed per nine innings (4th – 2.90). The Big Orange also continued to put up impressive power numbers, finishing sixth in the NCAA with 126 home runs, the second most in a single-season in program history, trailing only the 2022 team that blasted 158. UT had eight players, including a program-record six pitchers, selected in the 2023 MLB Draft and also had two players earn All-America honors in pitchers Andrew Lindsey and AJ Russell.\n\n2022 -- TENNESSEE (Postseason: NCAA Knoxville Super Regional)\n\nDuring his fifth season in charge of the Tennessee baseball program, Vitello orchesrated one of best years in program history, leading the Volunteers to their first-ever No. 1 national seed and a program-record 57 victories. UT was one win away from making its second consecutive College World Series appearance but fell to Notre Dame in the Knoxville Super Regional. However, the Big Orange won both the SEC Regular Season and SEC Tournament championships for the first time since 1995. The Vols won the SEC Regular Season title by six games, and the eastern division crown by 10 games, both of which are the largest margins in conference history. Tennessee became the first NCAA Division I team since at least 1972 to lead the country in both home runs (158) and ERA (2.51). The Vols’ 158 long balls shattered the previous program record of 107 while ranking fourth in NCAA Division I history, including the most by any team in the BBCOR bat era (since 2011). UT also led the country in runs scored (613), slugging percentage (.604), strikeout-to-walk ratio (4.24), WHIP (1.00), walks allowed/nine innings (2.48) and win/loss percentage (.864). Tennessee set a program record and led all SEC teams with 10 players selected in the 2022 MLB Draft and also set another program record with eight players earning postseason All-America honors.\n\n2021 -- TENNESSEE (Postseason: College World Series)\n\nVitello's fourth season at Tennessee ended up going down as one of the best in program history. The Vols made their fifth appearance in the College World Series (first since 2005) and went 20-10 in conference play to win the SEC Eastern division for the first time since 1997. UT's 50 wins were the third most in program history and the Big Orange ended their SEC Tournament struggles by advancing to the championship game for the first time since 1995. Tennessee was ranked for the entire season and earned its highest ranking in program history at the time, spending multiple weeks at No. 2 before eventually ending the season ranked as high as No. 5 nationally. For his efforts, Vitello was named 2021 National Coach of the Year by the NCBWA and Perfect Game. The Vols also boasted a program-record five All-Americans and had seven players taken in the 2021 MLB Draft, which was tied for the sixth most of any college team and tied for third most among SEC programs.\n\n2020 -- TENNESSEE (Postseason: N/A Due to COVID-19 Pandemic)\n\nIn his third season as the Vols skipper, Vitello had the Big Orange off to another fast start before the season was canceled due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Tennessee's 13-0 start to the season was the second-best in program history, trailing just the 15-0 start from the 2019 season. Vitello had the Vols ranked as high as 11th in the nation, the program's highest ranking since being tabbed No. 11 in the 2007 preseason poll. During the second weekend of the year, UT won the inaugural Round Rock Classic by sweeping the field that included No. 1 Texas Tech, Houston and No. 25 Stanford. The Vols finished the shortened season ranked No. 1 in the country in total runs (180) and runs per game (10.6) while ranking second nationally in home runs (31).\n\n2019 -- TENNESSEE (Postseason: NCAA Chapel Hill Regional)\n\nIn Vitello's second season on Rocky Top, he led Tennessee to its first 40-win season and NCAA Tournament appearance since 2005. He also led the Vols to 14 conference victories and a third-place finish in the SEC Eastern division (best since 2005) after winning five SEC series, including three over ranked opponents. Vitello led UT to nine wins over ranked teams, the most since the Orange & White had 10 victories over Top 25 programs in 2014.

Redshirt sophomores Carson Shaddy and Luke Bonfield each hit better than .300 and combined for 16 home runs and 74 RBIs to lead a team that finished fourth in the SEC in home runs (49). Two of Arkansas' six draftees in the 2016 MLB Draft were pupils of Vitello. Utility player Clark Eagan went in the ninth round to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Eagan batted .298 during his junior season with 37 runs scored, 67 hits, seven home runs and 37 RBIs.

Three Arkansas position players signed professional contracts following the 2015 season, including Andrew Benintendi who was selected No. 7 overall by the Boston Red Sox.

He also made an immediate impact working with the program's hitters, as the Razorbacks improved their batting average, on-base percentage and slugging percentage from the previous campaign. Arkansas also enjoyed a boost in total hits, triples, home runs, RBIs and runs scored. The offense helped lead Arkansas to its 13th straight NCAA Tournament appearance at the NCAA Charlottesville Regional, and the Razorbacks advanced to the Regional final.
