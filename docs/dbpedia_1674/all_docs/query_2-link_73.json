        "text": "Entering his tenth season as head coach of the Florida Gators in 2023-24, J.C. Deacon looks to expand on the success of his first nine seasons with the Orange and Blue.\n\nIt was a historic season for Deacon and the Gators in 2022-23 that led to the program’s fifth National Championship and 16th SEC Championship. Both were first for Deacon as he capped off the season being named Division I Dave Williams National Coach of the Year, a career first and only the second Gator head coach to receive the honor and third overall in program history and first since 2004 when Buddy Alexander received the recognition. He was also tabbed the SEC Coach of the Year.\n\nFlorida captured a national title for the first time in 22 years last week as the Gators swept NCAAs with Fred Biondi winning the NCAA Individual Championship. It was the third UF golfer (Nick Gilliam 2001, Bob Murphy 1966) to achieve the honor and second time in 30 years the program swept both titles. Florida is one of seven schools to achieve the mark twice.\n\nIn nine seasons, Florida has won 21 total events and medalist honors under Deacon. The Gators won the NCAA team title, individual title and conference title in the same season for the first time in program history.\n\nUF reached match play at nationals for the first time in program history after Deacon led the Gators to its best finish in the match play era (2009) last year in 10th. Florida played in the fourth round of stroke play for the fifth time in program history and third with Deacon. It was also the second consecutive season to clinch a spot in the final 18.\n\nFlorida finished stroke play in 2nd with a score of 1118 (-2), its lowest all-time at Grayhawk and first under par team score at the NCAAs since 2006. The 1,118 was the lowest round score at the National Championships in program history. A final round of 279 (-1) marks the third consecutive under round after back-to-back 2-under 278s in round two and three. The 2-under performance by UF is the best round at the NCAA Championships since the opening round in 2007.\n\nFlorida made its 56th NCAA Championship appearance this year, ranking fifth most in the country. The Gators have advanced out of regionals six times under Deacon and the last two years. UF has qualified for regionals every season with Deacon at the helm.\n\nA third round comeback at Bath Regional saw Florida erase a seven shot deficit led by a trio of rounds in the 60s by Yuxin Lin (66, -5), John DuBois (69, -2) and Ricky Castillo (69, -2) to earn a spot at Grayhawk.\n\nIn his ninth season, Deacon guided Florida to a SEC Championship Title for the first time in 12 years. The Gators got revenge and defeated No. 1 Vanderbilt 3-1-1 at Sea Island after falling 3-2 in 2022. Senior John DuBois, the 2022 SEC Individual Champion, sank a 15-footer for the match-clinching point.\n\nFlorida claimed six team titles and six individual titles this season, the most all-time under Deacon. The six team wins was the most since seven in 2003-04 as it was the sixth time the Gators have won at least six events in a season. The six medalist honors tied the program record in a season and only the third time in Florida history, the others were in 1989-90 and 2010-11.\n\nPrior to the postseason, the Orange and Blue won four regular season tournaments, including the season opener and finale. At the Augusta Haskins Award Invite, Florida finished 39-under par, to tie second all-time in program history by par and only three shots away from the record (-42) set under Deacon at the 2018 NCAA Regional.\n\nAt the VyStar Credit Union Gators Invitational, Florida won its home event for the fourth straight year under Deacon and the 29th time overall in the tournament's 46th occurrence.\n\nDeacon saw four golfers (Fred Biondi, Ricky Castillo, John DuBois and Yuxin Lin) all earn PING All-American honors, tied for the most selections by a school this year and tied the Florida record. It was the seventh time the Gators had four selections with the last time being in 2006. Biondi, Castillo, Lin and Quentin Debove were also selected to the PING All-Region Team. The trio of Biondi, Castillo and Lin collected All-SEC honors with Matthew Kress collecting freshman team recognition.\n\nSuccess was also obtained off the course with Fred Biondi, Quentin Debove and John DuBois being named GCCA All-American Scholars, which marked the third consecutive years with multiple honorees under Deacon and most selections in a single season in program history.\n\nAfter a bumpy fall in the 2021-22 season, Deacon got the Gators regrouped for a dominant spring. The second half of the season started on a strong note with winning back-to-back tournaments victories at the Sea Best Invitational and the VyStar Gators Invitational. The victory at Sea Best marked the fifth time in the spring opener and third time under Deacon.\n\nAt the Gator, Florida won the 45th annual event for the 28th time in program history and third under Deacon. The Gators shot 28-under (812) to win by 12 strokes over No. 3 Oklahoma State. Fred Biondi finished 14-under at 196 to tie the tournament record while he claimed his first collegiate medalist honor. The record was last set by Camilo Benedetti in 2001 as he tied for second in tournament score and tied third all-time in tournament score by par in three rounds. A native of Sao Paulo, Brazil, he set career bests in low round (63), tournament score and finish on the weekend. Biondi became the 16th UF golfer to be the individual champion at the invite as his birdie on 18th concluded the career outing and brought the crowd at Mark Bostick to their feet.\n\nBiondi’s first collegiate victory turned into a breakout season as he won his second tournament at the Calusa Cup along with two runner-up finishes, including at the NCAA Palm Beach Regional. He ended his season being named a PING First Team All-American, Haskins Award Finalist, All-SEC First Team, GCAA All-American Scholar, PING All-Region Team and two-time SEC Golfer of the Week.\n\nAt the 2022 SEC Championships, another Gator won his first collegiate title with John DuBois being crowned the individual champion. He became he 25th Gator in program history to win the title, the most by any SEC School. He joins the list of names such as Tommy Aaron, Steve Melnyk, Brian Gay, Camilo Benedetti, and volunteer assistant coach Billy Horschel. It marks the third UF golfer to win in the last five tournaments and third under Deacon - Alejandro Tosti (2017) and Andy Zheng (2018).\n\nThe Gators advanced to the SEC match play finals for the first time since the format was added in 2017. UF knocked off No. 6 Georgia (3-1-1) in the quarterfinals and No. 2 Texas A&M (3-1-1) in the semifinals. Florida finished runner-up for the 13th time in program history and first since 2010.\n\nUF took care of business at the NCAA Palm Beach Regional with 3rd place performance, advancing to its 55th NCAA Championship and fifth under Deacon, only missing it twice under him. At Grayhawk and the NCAA Championships, Deacon helped rally the Gators late in round three on the back nine to make the top-15 cut. Florida concluded its run only seven strokes from making match play for a 10th place finish, marking the highest under Deacon and best since 2007 - a 9th place outing.\n\nDeacon and the Gators returned to competition in a three-tournament fall schedule that featured SEC only play to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Florida touted a new lineup that featured at least three newcomers in each tournament, recording its best finish at the Vanderbilt Legends Collegiate where a 24-under par score put the team in a tie for fourth place. Deacon lit the fire for the Gators heading into the winter hiatus, responding with back-to-back first place finishes in their first two tournaments, including the second straight win at the Gators Invitational.\n\nThe Gators qualified for their 54th NCAA Championship in program history after a gutsy final round in the Cle Elum Regional propelled the team into fifth place. Florida would see its season come to an end after three rounds of stroke play at the Championship, with Ricky Castillo qualifying individually for the final day of stroke play and ultimately finishing 12th in the field.\n\nDeacon oversaw an incredible freshman duo in Joe Pagdin and Tyler Wilkes. Pagdin was named the 2021 SEC Freshman of the Year and the pair were both names to the SEC All-Freshman Team. In addition, Ricky Castillo earned a spot on the Second-Team All-SEC. Castillo and Pagdin were both named to the Division I PING All-Region Southeast Team.\n\nUnder Deacon, the Gators were trending upwards before the 2019-20 season abruptly ended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following a challenging fall campaign, Florida opened the spring with three-straight top-five finishes. Of those finishes, Deacon’s squad captured the team title at the VyStar Gators Invitational by an impressive 18 strokes, giving the Gators their first team win at Mark Bostick Golf Course since 2011.\n\nDeacon oversaw the best one-two combination in the nation with junior John Axelsen and freshman Ricky Castillo. Both players received recognition at the national and league level following their outstanding play. Castillo was named the 2020 Phil Mickelson Outstanding Freshman Award honoree and SEC Freshman of the Year. He also earned a spot on the All-SEC First Team, NCAA Division I PING All-America First Team and appeared on the Ben Hogan Award Final Watch List. Alongside Castillo, Axelsen also earned First Team All-American and All-SEC First Team honors.\n\nThe Gators ended the 2018-19 season at the NCAA Regional in Pullman, Washington. Florida tallied four top-five finishes and seven top-10 finishes. Their best came at the Florida Gators Invitational where the finished in second place, just one stroke off the winner Vanderbilt. The Gators' arguably-best performance came in the last event of the regular season at the Robert Kepler Invitational, hosted by Ohio State. The Gators finished third with four Gators inside the top 25. Sophomore John Axelsen earned PING All-Region honors at the conclusion of the season.\n\nThe 2017-18 season brought another individual conference champion and All-American under Deacon's reign in sophomore Andy Zhang. The Gators notched three titles, five top-5 and eight top-10 finishes throughout the season. They won the NCAA Regional in record-breaking fashion. After sitting at 25-under and five clear of the field entering the final round, Florida was chasing history. The team needed to shoot 12-under-par to tie the record for strokes under par.\n\nThe Gators shattered that mark, shooting a final-round 271 (-17), the lowest single round to par in program history. By the end of the tournament, they were 42-under-par to set the new program record by five strokes en route to winning the event by 12 shots. All five Gator players finished 2-under or better in the tournament, the only school in the field to accomplish the feat. Florida won the regional title for the first time since 2011 and fifth time overall.\n\nThe Gators advanced to the 54th NCAA Championships in program history and the third time in four season the team has made it under Deacon.\n\nDuring the 2016-17 season, the Gators tallied five team victories, nine top-5 finishes and 11 top-10 finishes en route to earning a national seed in the program’s 53rd appearance in the NCAA Tournament. Individually, Florida had four players finish atop the leaderboard including Alejando Tosti’s victory at the SEC Championships. Florida also had nine top-5 finishes and 21 top-10 finishes in 2016-17.\n\nDeacon saw two of his golfers in Sam Horsfield and Tosti garner national honors as the pairing were both named to the Golfweek and PING All-America Teams. Tosti was placed on the Golfweek First Team, PING second team and All-SEC honors. Horsfield garnered honorable mention honors from Golfweek and PING and All-SEC honors. Gordon Neale was also named to the All-SEC team while Andy Zhang made Freshman All-SEC.\n\nDuring its second season under his guidance, the team notched two victories, nine top-5 finishes and 11 top-10 finishes on its way to the NCAA Championships, the program’s 52nd appearance in the event. They improved in every postseason tournament, finishing tied for third at the SEC Championship, tied for second at the NCAA Regional and 15th at the NCAA Championships. Individually, Deacon saw his players capture four victories, four runner ups and 22 top-10 finishes.\n\nUnder Deacon’s coaching, Sam Horsfield cleaned up the awards season, winning the Phil Mickleson Award and SEC Freshman of the Year while also being named First Team Ping All-America, GCAA All-Freshman Team, PING All-Southeastern Region Team, All Nicklaus Team, and All-SEC. Deacon also saw Gordon Neale be named a Ping All-America Honorable Mention and named to the First-Year SEC Academic Honor Roll, Alejandro Tosti named to the PING All-Southeastern Region Team, and four Gators make the SEC Academic Honor Roll.\n\nIn Deacon’s first season at the helm, the 2014-15 squad placed fourth at the NCAA Regional Championship en route to qualifying for the NCAA Championships for the 51st time in school history. On the way to the postseason, Florida collected seven top-10 finishes, including four runner-up performances. UF combined for 34 top-25 finishes and 14 top-10 finishes, with three Gators placing in the top five multiple times.\n\nIn his initial year with the program, Deacon coached J.D. Tomlinson to spots on the PING Honorable Mention All-America Team, PING All-Southeast Region Team and second team All-SEC and led Alejandro Tosti to a place on the Freshman All-SEC Team. Under his watch, five Gators were named to the SEC Academic Roll, one was selected to the SEC First-Year Academic Honor Roll and two were chosen as Cleveland Golf/Srixon All-America Scholars.\n\nPrior to his head coaching debut, Deacon served as an assistant coach at his alma mater, UNLV. A collegiate player for the Rebels from 2001-05, Deacon joined the UNLV staff in the spring of 2011 and helped the 2013 squad advance to match play at the NCAA Championships, where it tied for fifth. A pair of Rebels, Kevin Penner (2012 & 2013) and Derek Ernst (2012), earned All-America honors on his watch. Five Rebels collected a total of eight spots on the All-Mountain West Men's Golf Team under his guidance, with Ernst winning the 2012 Mountain West Conference individual title and Penner picking up the victory in 2013.\n\nAs a student-athlete, Deacon helped UNLV to a Mountain West title in 2002 by tying for second in the individual contest. He competed in the 2002 and 2003 NCAA Championships and was a member of the Golf Coaches Association of America All-American Scholar Team and the Academic All-Mountain West Team in 2004. Deacon graduated from UNLV with a bachelor’s degree in communications in 2005 and has returned to the state where he completed high school.
