        "text": "2018\n\nThe 2018 season was a coming out party for several youngsters in the program, led by true freshman quarterback Zach Wilson. BYU football utilized a strong nucleus of freshmen in 2018 with key upperclassmen to not only improve its results but also offer a foreshadowing of greater things to come for the program moving forward. During the season the Cougars played 28 freshmen, including 18 true freshmen, while 14 different freshmen started at least one game. BYU’s freshman class made a combined 75 starts during the season and nearly every position featured freshmen as starters, including quarterback, running back, offensive line, tight end, wide receiver, defensive line, defensive back and kicker. Improving upon a disappointing nine-loss season in 2017, the Cougars finished 2018 with a 7-6 record that was highlighted by a big road victory over No. 6 Wisconsin and a record-setting bowl performance to wrap up the season. For the first time since 2015, BYU earned a spot in the top-25 polls during the season and also improved to 2-0 under Kalani Sitake in postseason play. BYU kicked off the year with a win over Arizona and potential Heisman candidate Khalil Tate. A dangerous runner, Tate was bottled up all night and BYU beat the wildcats 28-23 on the road. After a home loss to a stout Cal team, BYU hit the road again and put together a historic win at No. 6 Wisconsin in a 24-21 win. The Cougars defeated McNeese at home before back-to-back losses at No. 10 Washington and home to a dangerous Utah State team. After six games, Coach Sitake made a change at quarterback to Wilson and the BYU offense got a boost in the next game against a 6-1 Hawai'i team in Provo. The Cougars rocketed to 49 points, beating the Warriors 49-23 to spark the back half of the season. A letdown followed the next week however, with BYU falling to the MAC divisional champions, NIU. Despite a solid performance from Wilson at Boise State, the Cougars fell 21-16 to the Broncos but had a chance to win it with a play from the BSU 2-yard line with just seconds remaining. Wilson's keeper came up short though. BYU won the next two against UMass and senior day against New Mexico State behind a solid ground game that racked up 317 yards against the Aggies. Another heartbreaker happened at Utah in the last regular season game. BYU led 20-0 at halftime and looked to be fully in control before a furious comeback from the Utes would deny the Cougars to end the losing streak to Utah in a 35-27 loss in Salt Lake. At 6-6, BYU accepted an invitation to the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl where Zach Wilson put on a historic and perfect 18 for 18 passing day, throwing for 317 yards and four touchdowns to route the Western Michigan Broncos 49-18 in Boise.\n\n2017\n\nA record number of injuries and other setbacks derailed the 2017 campaign and the Cougars missed a bowl game for the first time in 13 seasons, finishing with a record of 4-9. The injury bug bit early and often for BYU and at times proved too much to handle. The Cougars had 37 different players miss significant time with an injury. Of those 37, 25 were members of the two-deep and 13 were projected starters before the season began. There were some bright spots in the season, first wit tight end Matt Bushman on offense, leading the team with 49 receptions, 520 yards and three touchdowns en route to being named a Freshman All-American by USA Today Sports, Chat Sports, 247 Sports and the FWAA. His marks were best among FBS true freshman tight ends and best by any BYU tight end since consensus All-American Dennis Pitta in 2009. Tejan Koroma was named a Pro Football Focus Second Team All-American after completing his fourth consecutive year as a starter, totaling 51 starts in his career. Defensively, Fred Warner was a star, leading the team in tackles and went on to be drafted in the third round by the San Francisco 49ers. The injuries however, combined with another strong independent schedule proved daunting. BYU suffered a seven-game losing skid during the season before finishing the year 3-2 to close the final five games. The Cougars were able to identify depth in new places with so many contributors missing time. Five different players took snaps at quarterback with Tanner Mangum, Beau Hoge, Joe Critchlow all starting games in addition to Koy Detmer Jr. seeing time on the field as well as Austin Kafentzis as a situational runner. After winning game one, BYU dropped the next seven as the season's injuries took their toll. BYU got back on track against San Jose State in Provo with a 41-20 victory before falling to a surging Fresno State team in California. BYU lost Mangum for the season against the Bulldogs as well. True freshman Joe Critchlow won his first start against UNLV, thanks to a historic performance by running back Squally Canada. Canada ran for 213 yards on 25 carries, good enough for the No. 10 mark in school single-game history. The Cougars won 31-21 but then suffered another setback the next week against UMass, falling 16-10 on a disappointing senior day. BYU ended the season with a trip to Hawaii and finished on a high note, taking down the Warriors 30-20 on Thanksgiving weekend to finish the 2017 campaign on an uptick.\n\n2016\n\nFormer BYU fullback Kalani Sitake was named head coach following 2015's Las Vegas Bowl. Right out of the gate, he took on one of the most challenging and diverse schedules in Cougar history for the 2016 season. BYU finished the year 9-4, including a 24-21 win in the Poinsettia Bowl to cap Sitake's first year at the helm. Taysom Hill returned as a fifth-year senior to quarterback the new pro-style offense led by BYU's lone Heisman Trophy winner, Ty Detmer, who returned on Sitake's staff as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. Jamaal Williams also returned for his senior season and the career rushing record, finishing with 3,901 yards, highlighted by a 286-yard game to break the single-game school record against Toledo. He finished the year No. 5 nationally with 137.5 yards per game, totaling 1,375 in just 10 games played. The Cougar defense also shined, finishing No. 2 nationally in takeaways with 31, and No. 14 in scoring defense at 19.5 points per game. BYU started the year with an 18-16 win vs. Arizona at Phoenix Stadium when freshman Jake Oldroyd knocked in his first career field goal for the game-winner. The Cougars dropped three straight after that by a total of seven points but rebounded with a thrilling 55-53 win over an offensively-loaded Toledo team. Williams ran for 286 yards to break Eldon Fortie's single-game record that stood since 1962. He also scored five touchdowns to tie the single-game record. Rhett Almond kicked a 19-yard field goal to win it as time expired. BYU went on to beat Michigan State on the road in dominant fashion, 31-14 and then defeated Mississippi State of the SEC with a 28-21 double-overtime victory at LaVell Edwards Stadium. The Cougars were tripped up on the road at No. 14 Boise State, losing another one-point contest. BYU won its final four regular season games but lost quarterback Taysom Hill with an arm injury in the final regular season contest. Experienced backup Tanner Mangum stepped in and along with Williams' 210 yard performance beat former conference foe Wyoming in an unusual wet and rainy San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl. Hill finished his Cougar career No. 4 at BYU in total offense with 9,744 yards of total offense. Following the season, Williams was selected in the fourth round by the Green Bay Packers in the NFL Draft. Nine other Cougars got NFL opportunities, including Hill who also signed with the Packers.\n\n2015\n\nIn the final season at BYU for head coach Bronco Mendenhall, the Cougars achieved their best record since 2011, finishing the season 9-4. Led by Touchdown Club of Columbus Freshman of the Year Tanner Mangum, the 3,854 total passing yards are the most in a season for BYU since 2008. Additionally, the offense scored the second-most points per game since 2009 with 33.7. The offense this season was well rounded with five receivers who each had more than 450 yards, including three with over 575. The season started off with one of the most memorable plays in BYU football history. With senior quarterback Taysom Hill injured, Mangum came off the bench. In the final play, Mangum threw a Hail Mary to Mitch Mathews, who caught the ball for the miraculous 33-28 win at Nebraska. Mangum followed up that performance with another incredible heave when BYU was down against No. 20 Boise State in the home opener. Mangum found Mitchell Juergens in the end zone for the go-ahead touchdown. A pick-six from Kai Nacua sealed the 35-24 win. Following the second week, the Cougars were ranked 19/22 heading to No. 10/12 UCLA, but they fell short. After a second loss to Michigan, BYU won five in a row, four of which were at LaVell Edwards Stadium. The Cougars participated in the Royal Purple Las Vegas Bowl against rival Utah, then ranked No. 22. However, BYU was unable to overcome five first-quarter turnovers. The Cougars fought back into the game, but the comeback fell short, losing 35-28. Mendenhall finished his time at BYU with a 99-43 overall record as the head coach, which is second all-time at BYU. Bronson Kaufusi finished his career ranked No. 3 in BYU career tackles for loss with 44 and second all-time in sacks with 26.5. The Baltimore Ravens selected Kaufusi in the third round as the 70th pick in the NFL Draft.\n\n2014\n\nBYU achieved a 3-0 record against Power 5 conference opponents, finished 8-5 overall and overcame a rash of midseason injuries to key players including starting quarterback Taysom Hill, running back Jamaal Williams, right guard Brock Stringham and cornerback Jordan Johnson. In all, 22 players who were starters or significant contributors missed multiple games with injuries during the year. In reaching the 2014 Miami Beach Bowl, BYU became one of only 12 programs to earn a bowl invitation each of the last 10 years. The Cougars scored more points in 2014 than they had since 2001. BYU also finished No. 14 in the nation in scoring offense with 37.1 points per game and No. 26 in total offense at 460.5 yards per game. BYU exploded out of the gates with a 4-0 start, topping UConn, Texas, Houston and Virginia. The 41-7 drubbing of Texas highlighted the first four games as BYU silenced over 93,000 fans in Austin to the tune of the Longhorns worst home loss since 1997. In game five against Utah State, Taysom Hill suffered a season-ending leg injury, signaling the start of a wave of injury to the program. The Cougars lost four straight but with Christian Stewart in at quarterback, BYU rebounded to win four straight and earn another bowl invitation. The regular season was capped off with a thrilling 42-35 win at Cal in an exciting back-and-forth offensive display. BYU dropped a heartbreaker in overtime to Memphis in the Miami Beach Bowl 55-48 in overtime. Stewart finished the year with 2,610 passing yards and 25 touchdowns in 11 games. Mitch Mathews highlighted the air attack with 73 catches, 922 yards and nine touchdowns.\n\n2013\n\nThe Cougars finished the 2013 season with an 8-5 record after playing one of the toughest schedules in school history and advanced to a ninth straight bowl game. Six of BYU's eight wins came against eventual bowl teams, including a 40-21 win against No. 15 Texas in Provo. The Cougars ran all over the Longhorns, rushing for a school-record 550 yards. The new go-fast, go-hard offense from returning offensive coordinator Robert Anae helped quarterback Taysom Hill put together a season of 2,938 passing yards and 19 touchdowns while running for 1,344 yards and 10 more scores. Running back Jamaal Williams also ran for over 1,000 yards with 1,233 yards and seven touchdowns. Wide receiver Cody Hoffman became the school's career leader in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns. He finished 2013 with 57 receptions, 894 yards and five touchdowns. Defensively Uani 'Unga was tackling machine, setting the single-season record for BYU with 143 stops. Kyle Van Noy wrapped up his Cougar career with 17.5 more tackles for loss to make him the career leader in TFL. Van Noy went on to join former teammate Ezekiel Ansah with the Detroit Lions after being selected in the second round of the NFL Draft, No. 40 overall.\n\n2012\n\nA dominant defense led BYU to its seventh winning season in as many years as the BYU football team finished the 2012 season with eight wins, a program-best fourth consecutive bowl victory and the No. 3 defense in the nation ...
