        "text": "NTJCAC HALL OF FAME\n\n2019\n\nHobart F. \"Hobie\" McManigal - Vernon College\n\nThe colleagues of Hobart F. “Hobie” McManigal are honored and privileged to recommend him for the North Texas Junior College Athletic Conference Hall of Fame.\n\nDuring his 30-year tenure, Hobart F. “Hobie” McManigal was actively involved in teaching, leading, and coaching at Vernon College. McManigal was instrumental in all student activities outside the classroom and coaching assignments, such as Sports Day, Turkey Run, and the Intramural activities of Flag Football, Basketball, Volleyball, Archery, Tennis, Golf, and Softball.\n\nHobie McManigal began his career at Vernon College (formerly Vernon Regional Junior College) in the fall of 1975 as Tennis coach and Physical Education instructor. In 1978 McManigal was promoted to Athletic Director. At that time the Athletic Department consisted of Intercollegiate Tennis and Golf. His tenure from 1975 – 2005, McManigal was responsible and commendable for his implementation of several athletic programs.\n\nThe fall of 1982 the college fielded its first Collegiate Rodeo Team. After a coach was hired, a rodeo arena was established and constructed to allow the team a place for practice on campus.\n\nSpring of 1987 brought on the Collegiate Baseball Team. While recruiting a new coach, McManigal was instrumental in the planning, organizing, and overseeing the newly constructed baseball complex.\n\nIn 1989 McManigal again recruited a new coach and instituted the Collegiate Volleyball Team.\n\nIn the spring of 1996 McManigal, once again hired a coach, and instituted the Collegiate Softball Team. He supervised the construction of the softball field, assisted by the coach.\n\nAs Hobie McManigal’s career shows, he has been a valuable asset to Vernon College not only to students, but the athletes and colleagues as well. He always has had a positive attitude whether on campus or in the community. The teams he developed continue his legacy to this day. He exemplifies the significance of being an outstanding educator, coach, athletic director, leader, and friend.\n\nVan Hedrick - North Central Texas College\n\nVan Hedrick has been the only head softball coach in the 20-year history of the North Central Texas College program. After serving as the assistant baseball coach at NCTC for several years, he started the softball program from scratch in 1999. In his 20 years as head coach, he has only had ONE losing season, and that was the very first season. He has more than 840 victories, winning more than 65 percent of his games. That win total makes him the winningest active junior college coach in Texas, and ranks him 10th among all active NJCAA Division I coaches. His teams have won two NTJCAC Championships, three NJCAA Region V North Championships and have advanced to the NJCAA Division I National Tournament three times in a span of nine years.\n\nSince the inception of the program, Coach Hedrick has made sure his team is actively involved in the community. Whether it be volunteering with a community playground build, reading to kindergarten students at local schools, working at a hot-air balloon festival to benefit a local hospital, or cleaning up a church playground, the Lady Lions softball team is always looking for ways to help out the community.\n\nSince 2005, Hedrick has served as Athletic Director at NCTC. Each year, NCTC teams donate the proceeds from gate admissions to local organizations including the American Red Cross and local animal shelters and food pantries. Tens of thousands of dollars have gone to local non-profit organizations because of this program.\n\nWhile attending Iowa Park High School, where he graduated in 1985, Van Hedrick was a three-sport letterman in football, basketball and baseball, and he earned All-District honors in all three sports. His pursuit of excellence on the playing field is no different in his work as the Lady Lions' first coach than it was in his playing days.\n\nCoach Hedrick attended Vernon Regional Junior College from 1986-1988, playing shortstop and serving as a team tri-captain. After earning his Associate degree there, Hedrick attended Tarleton State University from 1988 to 1990. At Tarleton, he moved to the outfield and was used as a relief pitcher. An arm injury sidelined him for most of his junior season. During Hedrick's senior year at Tarleton, however, he was named \"Comeback Player of the Year.\"\n\nIn 1990, Coach Hedrick earned his bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice, with a minor in Physical Education. After a year as the assistant coach at Hill College, he returned to Tarleton State and was a graduate assistant coach for two years while completing his Master of Education degree in 1992.\n\nCoach Hedrick is married to Robyn Ruzicka Hedrick and they have three daughters: Ashley, Allison and Autumn. Robyn holds a master's degree in Early Childhood Development and teaches high school Family and Consumer Science in Lindsay, TX.\n\nNo doubt one of the highlights of Coach Hedrick’s career came in 2017 when his older daughter, Ashley, signed with NCTC Softball.\n\nWilliam J. Campion - Ranger College\n\nRanger College President William J. Campion won a lot of games during his career as a basketball coach. He called even more during a 35-year period as a college referee before retiring from the court to focus on being one of the top small-college administrators in the United States.\n\nMore than two decades after he hung up his whistle, Campion got the call he least expected last month. He was wanted in the hall.\n\nThe Northern Texas Junior College Athletic Conference Hall of Fame, that is.\n\n“We’re honored to inducted President Campion into the NTJCAC Hall of Fame,” said Northern Texas Junior College Athletic Conference Commissioner Stan Feaster in making the announcement. “As a coach, referee and administrator, few people have done as much for this conference, and this school, as he. I can’t think of anyone who deserves this more.”\n\nWith his induction into the NTJCAC Hall of Fame, Campion becomes the fourth person from Ranger College to be enshrined in the conference’s hall of fame. Other RC individuals honored with individuals enshrined are former basketball/softball coach Ron Butler, former baseball coaches Jack Allen and Don Flowers.\n\nA native of El Paso, Campion has spent more than 40 years in the college ranks, working as a coach, educator and administrator at some of the top institutions on the U.S. He earned his bachelor’s degree from Texas Western College (now the University of Texas at El Paso. He later earned his doctorate from Texas A&M-Commerce.\n\nCampion, who has served as president of Ranger College for the past 10 years, broke into coaching college basketball in 1969 at Schreiner College in Kerrville. He served as the college’s head coach through the 1975 season. Following his departure from Schreiner for a position with East Texas State University, Campion continued working as a college and high school official. He spent more than three decades as an official in Texas, Oklahoma and Florida.\n\nCampion’s induction into the NTJCAC Hall of Fame marks the second time he has been honored with inclusion in an athletics hall of fame. In 1994, he was enshrined in the Florida Community College Basketball Hall of Fame. The following year, in 1995 he was honored by the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) with a Distinguished Service Award for his contributions to junior college athletics at the national level.\n\nDuring his tenure at Ranger College, Campion has had a major impact, including the passage of a $10 million bond that has helped the 93-year-old campus upgrade several of its facilities. He also hired former University of Kentucky and Texas A&M head coach Billy Gillispie as the men’s basketball coach and athletic director to oversee the overhaul of the RC athletic departments. Earlier this year, the RC men’s basketball team was ranked No. 1 in the country. The college’s golf and cross country teams are also ranked among the nation’s best.\n\nCampion and his wife, Sharon, are the parents of four daughters, and the grandparents to 12 grandchildren, some of whom have attended Ranger College.\n\n2018\n\nKevin Darwin - North Central Texas College\n\nAt the helm of Lions Baseball from its inaugural season in 1992, Coach Darwin led the Lions to the 2001 NJCAA World Series Championship in Grand Junction, Colorado. It was the first national title in any sport ever won by a North Central Texas College Team. And they did it in grand style—becoming the first team ever to drop the first game and then win six straight to capture the championship. The feat resulted not only from the efforts of an exceptional group of players but also from Coach Darwin’s outstanding managerial skills and inspirational leadership. It also earned him NJCAA “Coach of the Year” honors for 2001.\n\nAs Athletic Director, Coach Darwin brought distinction to all NCTC intercollegiate sports, in the classroom as well as on the playing fields. For him, the first word of the phase “student athlete” will always be the most important.”\n\nDon Flowers - Ranger College\n\nFormer Ranger College baseball player and coach Don Flowers was inducted into the the Northern Texas Junior College Athletic Conference (NTJCAC) Class of 2018 “Hall of Fame” during a campus ceremony on December 21, 2017 immediately following the induction of the late Jack Allen.\n\nFlowers played for the hall of fame coach, Allen from 1971-73. During his time on the field, he was named MVP of the national tournament when the Rangers captured the title in ’73. After his time as a Ranger, Flowers went on to play at Pan American University, now called University of Texas Rio Grande located in Edinburg.\n\nAfter his playing career ended, Flowers returned to Ranger and became an assistant for his former coach. In his first season assisting his former coach, RC placed third in the national tournament and would go on to win the 1978 national championship. When Allen retired in 1985, he endorsed Flowers to take over the Rangers baseball program, of which he did and went on to win over 400 games.\n\nWhile he coached future MLB players Hector Ortiz, Danny Williams and Pedro Bourbon many would say his biggest contribution to RC baseball was overseeing the construction of a new ballpark, which was named after Ranger alum and former MLB player Ellis Burks. Construction was completed in 2000 and RC still plays its home games there.\n\nFlowers retired from coaching in 2004 and began working in the wildlife industry.\n\n2017\n\nJack Allen - Ranger College\n\nFormer Ranger College baseball head coach and NJCAA Hall of Famer, Jack Allen was posthumously inducted into the Northern Texas Junior College Athletic Conference (NTJCAC) Class of 2017 “Hall of Fame” during a campus ceremony on December 21, 2017. Mr. Allen passed away on May 28, 2016 at the age of 80.\n\nA 1953 graduate of Ranger High School, Allen coached at Ranger Junior College – later renamed Ranger College – for more than two decades and won a school-record 814 games and a pair of NJCAA national championships. He began his coaching career in 1963 at RJC and helped turn the Rangers into a perennial national power. Under his leadership, the team won the NJCAA national title in 1973 and 1978, finished fifth in 1975, and third in 1976. In addition to the two national titles, he led Ranger to seven regional championships and four state titles. During his 23 seasons as the Rangers’ head coach, he compiled a record of 814-399.\n\nAllen was elected into the Junior College Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame in 1986. After retiring from Ranger Junior College, he took over the head coach at Tarleton State University in 1989. Over the ensuing 13 seasons, he led the Texans to consecutive 40-win seasons and was named the NAIA District 8 and Area II Coach of the Year in 1992. He helped TSU qualify for the school's first NCAA South Central Regional Tournament in 1998. Allen returned to RC to finish out his career as the Rangers athletic director.\n\nCoach Allen was inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame prior to the 2000 season. He retired from coaching in 2002 and was inducted into the Tarleton Athletics Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nJack a resident of Lake Leon, was married to his wife of 50 years, Linda Ann Allen. He becomes the second recipient of this prestigious honor, following former Coach Ron Butler in 2015.\n\nDr. Robert \"Chops\" Chaloupecky - North Central Texas College\n\nComing aboard in 1971, Coach Chaloupecky not only built the longest tenure of any NCTC coach in any sport ever but also amassed an unequaled winning record by the time he retired on July 2, 2003. Over 32 seasons, his teams posted a cumulative overall dual match record of 949-298-15. His winning percentage of .761 was still, in 2003, the highest among all active community college tennis coaches in the records. His players posted equally impressive records in the classroom, many winning Academic All-American honors and, as a team, inspiring all other NCTC student athletes to strive for academic excellence. Coach Chaloupecky was inducted into the NJCAA Women’s Tennis Hall of Fame in 1993 and the NJCAA Men’s Tennis Hall of Fame in 1997. He was NJCAA Junior College Wilson/ITA Coach of the Year in 1997.\n\n2015\n\nRon Butler - Ranger College\n\nRanger College has selected Mr. Ron Butler as the first recipient of the newly established Northern Texas Junior College Athletic Conference (NTJCAC) “Hall of Fame”.\n\nRon Butler, better known as “Coach Butler” or “Mr. Ranger College” to many area folks and colleagues retired in 2000 after providing 36 years of athletic direction for Ranger College. His long running successful career began in 1964 as the Men’s basketball coach and Assistant football coach. This endeavor followed an outstanding High School career at Oak Grove High School in Paragould, Arkansas, which earned him a basketball scholarship at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock and Midwestern University.\n\nDuring his tenure at Ranger College, Coach Butler held the reigns as Athletic Director for 32 years. In addition, he was the Men’s basketball coach for 16 years, enjoying many successful seasons. Throughout his successful coaching career, Ranger College would benefit from many of Butler’s accomplishments. His basketball team would quickly earn the nickname “Butler’s Bullies,” especially while overpowering opponents in Ranger Gym, now appropriately named Ron Butler Gymnasium, where the Rangers very seldom ever suffered a defeat. In only his second season, Ranger would win the Region V Tournament and advance to the National JUCO Tournament in Hutchinson, Kansas. Several conference championships would come his way; 1965, 66, 67, 71, 76, and 1982. It was the 1967 season that the Rangers reached their highest level of play, winning the Region V Championship and placing 6th in the National Tournament, having held the rank of #2 in the Nation for much of the season. In all Butler amassed a 320-160 record.\n\nHe began the Women’s basketball program in 1968, cultivating an 18 year run. His Women’s basketball teams ranked at the top of the old AIAW and won the National Invitational Tournament, the then National Championship in Oklahoma City, in 1971. Ranger’s baseball program also rose to prominence under Butler’s 34-year watch as A.D., winning National Championships in 1973 and 1978. Remaining a vital part of Ranger football program, Butler would witness a feat, reached by few…helping the program win a National Championship in 1979.\n\nIn 1987, Butler pioneered a women’s Fast-Pitch softball program as an intercollegiate sport. At the time, Ranger College was only the second Junior College in Texas offering Women’s softball at the Division I college level. His Lady Rangers would advance to the National Tournament four times placing second in both 1988 and 1991. In 1994 and still going strong, Butler founded the “Cowtown Classic,” which now represents the largest two-year college women’s softball event drawing over 35 teams from 7 states.\n\nA special tribute was paid to the long-time coach and Athletic Director on January 9, 2010, a celebration in his honor recognizing this day as “Ron Butler Day.”\n\nButler remains very much the center of all things at Ranger College, where he attends many home sporting events and also serves on the Ranger College Board of Regents as Vice-Chairman. Of his many accomplishments he acknowledges one of his best, which is being married to his lovely wife Rowena for over 56 years. The Butlers raised three children and have five grandchildren.\n\nWJCAC HALL OF FAME\n\n2020\n\nDrew Sanders - New Mexico Junior College\n\nDrew Sanders came to New Mexico Junior College in the summer of 2007 to begin his tenure as the head women’s basketball coach for the T-Birds. No one could imagine the string of success that was ahead for the Fletcher, Oklahoma native. During Coach Sanders 13-year career with the T-Birds he earned 298 wins against 115 loses helping make NMJC a nationally recognized program. The T-Birds won 5 WJCAC Championships, 2 Co-Conference WJCAC Championships, 4 Region V Championships, and represented the WJCAC with 7 National Tournament appearances. The T-Birds finished as the National Runners up in 2019.\n\nCoach Sanders coached 41 years, 20 at the junior college level and 21 at the high school level. Coach Sanders had a junior college career record of 443 - 182 at Eastern Oklahoma State College and NMJC. His overall career record including high school was 836 - 403.\n\nThe coaching resume established by Sanders is recognized in his home state of Oklahoma as well. Having led multiple teams to the Oklahoma High School State Tournament along with an exceptional career leading the Lady Mountaineers of Eastern Oklahoma State College which included a trip to the NJCAA National Tournament. Coach Sanders was selected as the 1996 Oklahoma High School Coach of the Year and was inducted to the Oklahoma Girls Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nCoach Sanders is blessed to have a family that has sacrificed and supported his career in every way. This includes his wife, Nedra, 3 daughters, 2 sons-in-law, & 7 grandchildren. Shawn & son, Lane; Kristin & husband, Jeremiah, & children, Branden, Abbe, Josiah, & Sawyer; & Stefanie & husband, RJ, & children, Christopher & Cason. Coach Sanders is lucky to have the support of his extended family too numerous\n\nto mention.\n\nSylvia Gann Benge Mahoney - New Mexico Junior College\n\n“Seldom does a college sport exist for more than eighty years without having a book written about it, but college rodeo has. The extent of available information for research consisted of brief references in college yearbooks, rodeo history books, and museums. The National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association’s (NIRA) home page on the Internet had a limited amount of background information. For this reason, erroneous information, which slowed research, had found its way into obituaries, college rodeo programs, awards ceremonies, and biographies. A need was evident for a documented, detailed history of college rodeo supplemented with the records of national champions and the schools that won them. Most schools did not have an accurate record of their own champions because the national records were incomplete and had several earlyday errors. Also, a list of the persons who were at the organizational meetings was needed to give credit to those who actually helped start the NIRA.\n\nPrior to starting my seventeen years of research on the history of college rodeo, I spent an initiation period of about eight years. When I was hired to teach English at New Mexico Junior College (NMJC), it was a young, robust institution in an oil-rich county one hundred miles long and forty miles wide, with most of the county being ranch country. Under the strong leadership of John Sheppard, vice president for instruction, NMJC provided the environment for creative ideas and supported them with wise direction and encouragement.\n\nSo that NMJC could have a rodeo program, the ranchers and area rodeo groups built an arena and gave it to the college. I replaced the English instructor and rodeo club sponsor, so I was asked to do both, also. Since they assured me that there was no one else available, I, after making calls to recruit help, agreed to do it. The fall of 1977, when I became the rodeo club sponsor, attorney and NMJC board member Ray Potter, who twenty years later became my brother-in-law, directed the idea of moving the NMJC rodeo program into the athletic department so that it could be funded, resulting in my acquiring the title of rodeo coach.\n\nWhile I was a rodeo coach and an English instructor at New Mexico Junior College, NIRA commissioner Tim Corfield initiated me into the field of writing rodeo articles, illustrated with photos, for the national college rodeo newspaper as well as for other national magazines, such as Western Horseman. Tim recommended me to Randy Witte, Western Horseman publisher, who offered me writing opportunities and enthusiastically promoted the NIRA alumni association and the writing of this book. After I presented several papers on college rodeo to the Texas Folklore Society (TFS), Dr. Francis Abernethy, TFS secretary and editor, asked me to write the entry on rodeo for The New Handbook of Texas, an encyclopedia.\n\nThe research and writing for this book about college rodeo started when I became the executive director of the Lea County Cowboy Hall of Fame (LCCHF) and Western Heritage Center on the NMJC campus at Hobbs, New Mexico. When the interim college president, R. N. Tydings, remarked to me after a coaches’ meeting to plan a $4 million addition to the gym that he didn’t see anything in the plans for rodeo, I presented a proposal to him to showcase some of the world champions from Lea County—approximately fifty-seven championships had been won at that time. President Tydings called county rancher Tuffy Cooper, whose talks to my Southwest literature classes about the fact that the county had spawned so many rodeo world champions had led to my proposal to President Tydings. After the three of us talked, the LCCHF resulted, with a thirteen-member talented, visionary board of directors from area ranches, especially inspired by rancher Daisy Clayton, seven hundred charter members, an annual induction dinner, and five thousand square feet of space to fill.\n\nAs the executive director with museum displays to create, I called on Museum of New Mexico curators for advice, and they welcomed me for a week to learn some basics. Then, I started research on ranchers and county rodeo champions. While doing research on a former college cowgirl who said that she had won an NIRA all-around championship (she had), I found that the NIRA had limited records on early-day NIRA cowgirls. In fact, the cowgirl national champions were not listed in the national records prior to 1956. During the first few years, the nomadic national office, run by college students, winnowed the files down to almost nothing, leaving them incomplete. No records existed on the twenty-nine years of college rodeo history prior to the organization of the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association, which is the only college rodeo association.\n\nI discovered that the only sources of information on college rodeo before the founding of the NIRA were from the cowboys and cowgirls and their scrapbooks with newspaper clippings and rodeo programs. As I called people, they started expressing a desire to have an NIRA alumni association, so in 1992 one of the alumni, Betty Sims Solt, and I organized the NIRA Alumni (NIRAA), which meets annually at the College National Finals Rodeo (CNFR). The members of this group helped verify that some national records were incorrect or incomplete. The alumni also filled in many history blanks, information that could not be found in printed material.\n\nAs a coach, I started attending college rodeos in 1977 in the Southwest Region, which included the colleges and universities from Fort Worth to San Angelo down to the Big Bend country up to the Texas Panhandle, and at that time, all of New Mexico. Along the way, I married a rodeo coach, John Mahoney from Sul Ross State University, who took a coaching job at Vernon Regional Junior College. After I quit coaching, I continued going to the Southwest Region rodeos with my coach husband and to every CNFR since 1979, making it easy to connect with present and past cowboys and cowgirls since rodeo people have an intricate networking.\n\nI started my research by collecting every book on rodeo that I could find. There are no books on the history of college rodeo and few on professional rodeo. In my search, I started recording interviews with former NIRA members and champions; many of those more than 150 people are now deceased. Without them, countless questions would have gone unanswered.\n\nTo establish where and when the first intercollegiate rodeo was held, I started contacting people at land-grant universities for information. Charlie Rankin provided Texas A&M history that led to the 1920 date for the first college rodeo on a campus. Then, everything came together when John Bascom of Victorville, California, who made copies of all the information at the Victor Press on the first intercollegiate rodeo produced by Cal Godshall, called to tell me that he had located Jeanne Godshall, Cal’s daughter. The turning point in my research came when I talked to Jeanne Godshall, who initially said that she wasn’t well and didn’t feel like talking. However, forty-five minutes later she had given me valuable, previously unavailable information and insight that helped tie my research together.\n\nA surprising fact found during my research was that college rodeo had run parallel with professional rodeo while both were in their infancy, but college rodeo remained relatively unknown. With this fact, the effects of the new breed of cowboy and cowgirl on professional rodeo became a part of my research. With rodeo originating in the daily work of cowboys on ranches, the cultural aspect of a college education on ranch rodeo cowboys, and the spread of rodeo internationally by college rodeo networking and new careers contributed to the research. My research became more than a record of college championships, it became a project to gain insight into rodeo in a collegiate atmosphere and the perpetuation of a sense of the Spirit of the West by educated college rodeo people who moved beyond ranches. It illuminated the reason that college rodeo athletes are hard working, independent, fun, down-to-earth people. Cowboys and cowgirls, who are responsible for the feeding and care of their horses every day, are kept honest by their horses, as horses kick champions as fast as they kick anyone. These attributes along with persistence in taking what they love—their horse and their competition—wherever they go, successfully transplanted rodeo to the college campus and changed it from a show to a college sport, resulting in educated rodeo people who perpetuated the Western way of life as they moved into numerous new professions in new geographical areas while maintaining a strong network of friendships and a love for the sport of rodeo.”\n\nNow, a look at Sylvia's seven-year tenure, 1977-1984, as NMJC college rodeo coach, at the time in 1977, one of only three-female college rodeo coaches in the nation.\n\nIn 1982, Sylvia's NMJC women's rodeo team was 1982 Reserve National Champion Women's Team, a record that still stands at NMJC. This was significant, but an inside look adds to this. The 1982 National Champion Women's Team Championship was won by a college-rodeo power-house university, Southeastern Oklahoma State University. Please note, two-year colleges compete with universities for national championships. Even more, the SEOSU coach Betty Gayle Cooper was a cowgirl, born and raised on a ranch in Lea County near Monument to a college rodeo champion, Tuffy Cooper. So, in 1982, the national champion team coach and 2nd-place national champion team coach were both raised in Lea County, Betty Gayle Cooper and Sylvia Gann Benge Mahoney.\n\nDuring Sylvia's seven years as NMJC rodeo coach, two team members qualified for the national finals every year by winning 7 regional championships, 4 reserve regional championships, 1982 CNFR Reserve All-Around Championship--LaRae Higgins; 1982 National Rookie of the Year--Tami Noble.\n\nEight of Sylvia's NMJC men's team members went on to compete at the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association National Finals Rodeo with two winning world championships: Shaun Burchett, 1987 & 1988 World Champion Steer Roper; D.R. Daniel, 1987 Reserve World Champion Tie-Down Roper.\n\nIn fall 1983, Manny Marquez, sports editor, Hobbs News Sun, wrote, \"Last year, NMJC women's team, ... finished second in the National Intercollegiate Finals [CNFR], and essentially was the national junior college champion because the only school to finish ahead of it was a major college. ... The NMJC rodeo program has reached big-time.\"\n\nIn fall 1983, Sylvia submitted her letter of resignation saying, \"The rodeo program has gotten so big that it needs somebody who can work with it full-time.

Nicky learned that the strength of her mother would motivate her to achieve unsurmountable odds through the face of adversity and obstacles. She developed a love for sports, but happened to excel the best in basketball. She spent most of her youth on the pavements ane at the infamous King Dome (Foster Projects), West 4th Street, Milbank and Rucker Parks, developing a toughness and grit, where she was often challenged by boys in the neighborhood. She learned how to handle the ball, which included no look passes and a quickness like no one else her age, thus given her the nickname “Quickie Nicky.” She began to take this sport very serious, realizing there could be an opportunity to earn a future scholarship. She wasn’t prepared for what was to come upon entering high school and this is where the real journey in her determination to achieve began.\n\nEntering high school, Nicky was sure to make the varsity team and did just that at Murry Bergtraum Public High School. She spent her first two years excelling both academically and athletically, but also struggled emotionally as her mother, Ms. Geneva was fighting through a medical condition. Her Mom and siblings are Nicky’s pride and joy and it was very difficult to see her Mom face such pain. However, Ms. Geneva and family never missed a game and would be her biggest cheerleaders present. Although Nicky excelled at Murry Bergtraum, having averaged 24.3 points per game and 6.2 assists, and a single game scoring record of 45 points, she decided she needed a change. She transferred to West Side High School and this is really where her career took off. She averaged better than 20 pts., 10 assist and 4 steals a game. Nicky’s highlight at Westside High, was once scoring 80 points in a single game. Although excited about basketball, her family was her priority. Her senior season came and Nicky had to begin to think about her future. Did she want to stay in New York or explore other parts of the world?\n\nShe began to get recruited by a few schools, but her closeness to her Mother would not allow her to move too far away. A close friend of Nicky’s heard of an opportunity in Hobbs, New Mexico, and made mention of it just to get an answer of; What? Where? I have never heard of a school that far away and I certainly did not want to leave my ailing mother.\n\nFaced with this extremely difficult decision and with the encouragement and approval of her soft spoken mother, she decided to take a chance. After gaining the trust of Coach Bret Palmer and then learning there was financial assistance available, she said, YES. Nicky had to take a leap of faith and decided New Mexico JC was the place she wanted to lend her talents. She traveled across country and then began to second guess her decision, becoming “Home Sick.” Again, with the strength of her mother and the support of her siblings, she decided to remain in Hobbs, New Mexico. She then discovered, and comforted knowing there were other high school stand outs that planned on attending New Mexico as well.\n\nThings were headed in the right direction and what was to become of her career at New Mexico Junior College was absolutely stellar. Her accomplishments from her first year alone, gained her honors such as first team All-Conference, assist and steal leader. She was recognized as one of the top guards in her conference, but now she began to earn national attention. Never losing sight of Ms. Geneva’s ailment, Nicky remained focused and determined to make her mother proud. In Nicky’s sophomore season, she was beginning to be recruited nationally by several schools such as University of Georgia, San Diego State, and University of Southern California (USC). Again, the accolades compiled with Nicky being named First Team All-Conference, All Region, and Kodak All-American, the highest honor for a Junior College Player. Nicky finished her stellar career, ranked #2 All Time, and one of the top assist and steal leaders, one of the team captains, and led the team to a 25-4 record, with New Mexico JC being nationally ranked.\n\nAfter gaining numerous accolades, and with much consideration and approval of her loved ones, Nicky decided to commit to Pac-10 powerhouse, USC. She played alongside Lisa Leslie (2-time WNBA Champion & Gold Medalist), Tina Thompson (4-Time WNBA Champion, Gold Medalist), and a host of noteworthy student-athletes. Head Coach Marianne Stanley, had gained an outstanding player, and Nicky meshed very well with her team. She received a lot of support and began to feel that she made the right decision. However, during Nicky’s senior season, she received a call no one plans on receiving that Ms. Geneva had passed. Devastated, Nicky had to return home to New York to be with her family. Although a very challenging time, Nicky again had to face a decision, did she want to stay on the East Coast or did she want to return to USC. She spoke to her eldest sister, Sharon McCrimmon, who said, “Mom would not want you to give up on your dream of playing at a prestigious University, so continue to make her proud, as she will always be in our hearts.” Nicky returned to USC and continued to indeed to make her mother proud.\n\nNicky had developed into a true point guard, after learning her leadership development from New Mexico Junior College. This included; teamwork, dedication, consistency, dependability and being a good listener. She made a true impact at USC and in the PAC-10, with accolades including being in the top 8 in assist and steals/per turnover ratio. She was one of the most exciting point guards to watch and led her team to one game shy of going to the Final Four. In the Elite Eight National Tournament, Nicky shined, scoring in double figures vs. Nebraska University (15 points), Avg. 73% in Free throws and 6.2 in Assists. Her collegiate career was coming to a close, but one thing was for certain, she promised her family that she would honor her Mother Geneva by graduating with her degree from USC. Having the support of her family and them all being in attendance at her graduation, Nicky honored her commitment and walked across the stage with her degree in Communications and Minor in Sociology.\n\nNow, she faced another life decision, what was to come next? She knew there could be a potential for a professional career but that was a matter of if a league would surface. To Nicky’s delight a newly formed Professional Women’s League had begun, the ABL. She was drafted to the Long Beach Stingrays and the Atlanta Glory, who was coached by the Legendary Gold Medalist, Teresa Edwards. Nicky had grown once again as a person and athlete and wanted to continue her professional career. She began to play in various leagues throughout the city to hone her skills. Again, she was delighted that she could possibly be drafted in the newly formed Women’s National Basketball League (WNBA). Nicky would have to wait three years to decide her fate. During that time, Nicky began to work in education as a substitute teacher and coach. She developed a liking toward helping others. Her patience indeed paid off, after extensive training and waiting for a call, she received the call she had been drafted in the 4th round of the WNBA by the Nicky was invited into the WNBA Combine in Chicago. Various teams were able to scout talent and prepare choose their top picks for the draft. A called was made to Nicky informing her that The Los Angeles Sparks had drafted her #63 in the fourth round. The opportunity to stay home and still play the sport that has shaped her life was a dream come true. During her career with the LA Sparks, she earned two World Championships, (2001, 2002) and played an important role with the team. Her infectious personality and ability to communicate effectively with her teammates, she was well received. Nicky played 4 seasons with the LA Sparks before being traded to the Houston Comets in 2005. During the off season of the WNBA, Nicky expanded her development by playing oversees in Poland, which she gained accolades by winning a championship with the European FIBA team, Polpharma VWB. To add to her off season accomplishments, Nicky received a Proclamation by the State of New York, naming September 13, as Nicky McCrimmon Day.\n\nNicky decided to retire the sport she loved so much, but her awards didn’t stop there. In 2003, the place that shaped her development recognized her by retiring her basketball jersey. The love and support they showed her during her playing years are invaluable and she is forever indebted. Her later accomplishments included acting roles in movies such as Space Jam and countless commercials and TV Sitcoms. Currently, Nicky serves as a Deputy Probation Officer but still finds time to mentor youth. The opportunity to be chosen and recognized in the Hall of Fame from New Mexico Junior College would be the final chapter in her story book. She has represented herself, her family and the sport of basketball with the highest integrity. We hope that she will be considered for this prestige award.\n\nKelly Chadwick, Western Texas College\n\nWestern Texas College along with the Western Junior College Athletic Conference took the opportunity to recognize the late Coach Kelly Chadwick by inducting him into the WJCAC Hall of Fame. The inductee was represented by his daughter, Denise Payne and her son Justin and daughter Jenna, and Coach Chadwick’s son Royce Chadwick, who currently coaches the Texas A&M- Corpus Christi women’s basketball team.

As he grew stronger and faster throughout high school, Wardell felt he was just average in most of the sports in which he participated. Soon, Wardell decided to concentrate on track and field and use the sport as a way to springboard himself into college. Little did he know the height of success he was headed for.\n\nTrack and field proved to have that immediate success for Gilbreath as he won state (Texas) in the 220-yard dash with a time of 21.2 during his senior year in high school and then landed a spot on the national High School All-American team.\n\nWardell’s success was just beginning, as his wish came true to go to college, when he began his collegiate track and field career at New Mexico Junior College under coach Ross Black, who helped mold him into one of the top sprinters of all time. The NMJC team went on to win numerous dual meets and set records in multiple events that led up to a trip to the NJCAA Track & Field Championship. Wardell became high point man after winning the NJCAA T&F Championship in the 220-yard dash at 20.6. He also placed in two other events, including second in the 100-yard dash and third in the mile relay. NMJC placed a successful third overall in the national meet. As a Junior College All-American, Wardell set school records in the 220-yard dash carving out his niche on the international circuit and becoming one of NMJC’s first sprinters to participate on multiple USA and World University track and field teams. Gilbreath then toured several nations, including Germany, Italy, Russia and Poland as a member of the USA Junior AAU Outdoor Track & Field Team where he became an international Champion in 1973, winning the 220-yard dash in 20.8. He also won a gold medal as the 2nd leg of the 400 meters relay team, which tied the world record at 39.9 set by France in 1969.\n\nMoving on to the University of Arizona to pursue a degree in education, Wardell became a two-time NCAA All-American in the 200 meters in 1974 and 1976 when he was ranked No. 1 in the world for half the season and one of the top sprinters projected to make the USA Olympic Team. Unfortunately, an injury in the semifinals of the Olympic Trials prevented Wardell from making the team, but his time of 20.2 in the 200 meters still ranked him third in the world and second in the USA. In 1977, Gilbreath continued to participate with the USA team pursuing that Olympic dream and ran in key international meets including the third edition of the Pacific Conference Games, a competition between five Pacific coast nations: Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the United States. He won a gold medal with the 4X100 relay team with a time of 38.85. He continued in 1978 to compete internationally in Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Germany against Olympic-caliber athletes leading up to the 1980 Olympic games.\n\nBack in the United States, Wardell successfully pursued a sponsorship with Mesa Petroleum Company of Amarillo, Texas, affording him the opportunity to train for the Olympics. In 1979, Gilbreath and the USA team then went to Moscow, Russia to participate in a pre-Olympic track & field meet at the Spartacade Games. Gilbreath was the only American to win three gold medals in Russia and was on track for the upcoming 1980 Olympic Trials until the USA decided to boycott the Moscow Olympics in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The boycott sank the dreams of many aspiring athletes. Wrapping up his profound year in 1979, Wardell was named the Panhandle Sports Hall of Fame Athlete of the Year.\n\nIn 1980, Gilbreath took a major step in building a life outside of track and field by marrying his longtime love, Audrey. Now married for 38 years, the couple raised two daughters, Stefanie and Briana who both became excellent athletes in their own right. Both daughters were H.S. McDonald All-Americans in basketball, NCAA women’s basketball players for the University of Southern California (USC) Trojans, and both played professionally for the WNBA as well as for overseas teams in Poland, Germany, Portugal and Belgium.\n\nToday, Wardell and Audrey are owners of the largest and oldest African-American-owned marketing agency in Houston. They founded Gilbreath Communications, Inc. more than 28 years ago, and the company has steadily expanded its business and raised its profile — earning recognition over the years as one of Houston’s Fastest-Growing Small Businesses.\n\nSince launching Gilbreath Communications, they have developed, implemented and managed diverse integrated marketing, public relations, advertising and digital campaigns, for more than 400 public and private entities. Their portfolio of clients include Shell Oil, the City of Houston Department of Homeland Security, Houston Community College System, the Texas Department of Agriculture, Texas A&M University, Prairie View A&M University, CenterPoint Energy, Amegy Bank, Port of Houston Authority, Workforce Solutions, the NFL, McCain Foods, Reliant Energy, Rite Choice Pharmacy, The Methodist Hospital, BP America, the City of Houston Health Department, and the Texas Department of Transportation, to name a few.\n\nGilbreath Communications also has won numerous prestigious industry, business and community service awards over the years for the agency’s work, including Small Business of the Year by the SBA and Marketing and Communications Firm of the Year by the Greater Houston Business Procurement Forum. After induction into the Southwest Advertising Hall of Fame, the agency received one of the ad club’s highest honors as the 2016 Silver Medal Award winner designated for those who make significant contributions to the success of their own company; demonstrate excellent creative ability; contributions to the general advancement of advertising; contributions to the community, and contributions to the AAF-Houston.\n\nWardell and Audrey both believe their greatest accomplishment was having the opportunity to pay it forward by putting five nephews through college so they, too, could become productive citizens. Additionally, five years ago, the agency launched a scholarship in the company’s name through the Advertising Education Foundation of Houston. The scholarship is awarded to students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) who are pursuing degrees in the communications area.\n\nTom Cantrell - New Mexico Junior College\n\nTom graduated from Sherman High School located in Sherman, Texas in 1969.

Birmingham guided the Thunderbirds to six WJCAC titles and seven WJCAC runner-up finishes.\n\n“It’s an honor to be in the WJCAC Hall of Fame and represent the city and county that I grew up in,” Birmingham said. “NMJC and Lea County gave me the opportunity and I’ll never forget that. I will always be a Lea Countian until the day I die.”\n\nBirmingham is also a member of the NJCAA Hall of Fame (2011), the Lea County Sports Hall of Fame (2012) and the New Mexico Sports Hall of Fame (2015).\n\nBirmingham finished his Thunderbird career with an eye-popping .750 winning percentage (765-255-2), including 17 consecutive winning season to finish his tenure at NMJC – which came to an end after the 2007 season when he accepted the head coaching position at New Mexico. Following the program’s first season, the T-Birds were at least 12 games over .500 in his final 17 seasons, including an incredible 378-88-2 (.810) from 2000-07.\n\nUnder Birmingham's leadership, New Mexico Junior College became known for its hitting prowess with six former players leading the country in batting and six teams hitting above .400.

NMJC closer Brendan Donnelly (1990-91) won Game 6 for the Anaheim Angels in the 2002 World Series, and became the first T-Bird with an MLB championship ring. A year later, Armando Almanza (1992-93) was a member of the World Champion Florida Marlins. In the summer of 2003, Donnelly was the winning pitcher in the MLB All-Star game in Chicago.\n\nBirmingham also watched proudly as former NMJC players Jose Flores (1992-93) and Mike Vento (1997) participated in the MLB playoffs with Oakland and the New York Yankees, respectively. Johnny Lujan and David Carpenter are the most recent former NMJC players to be make noise with a big league organization.\n\nBirmingham’s success has translated to The University of New Mexico.

As a senior Braziel started every game for the Lady Raiders during a season in which they finished with a 30-4 record and advanced to the ‘Sweet 16’ of the NCAA tournament before falling to Rutgers. The Lady Raiders have not experienced another 30 win season since the 1998-1999 season (as of August 2011).\n\nBraziel was named Most Valuable Player of the Big 12 tournament in 1999 as well as the Big 12 Player of the Year after leading the Lady Raiders with 20 points and nearly nine rebounds per game. Braziel was also named to four All-American teams for the 1998-99 season: The United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the Associated Press, Women’s Basketball Journal, and the Women’s Basketball News Service. Entering the 2011-12 academic year, Braziel still ranks highly in several single season Lady Raider categories including fifth with 690 points in 1998-99, third in field goals made, and fifth in blocked shots.\n\nBraziel’s success at both South Plains and Texas Tech landed her an opportunity to play at the highest level when she was drafted by the Charlotte Sting of the WNBA following the 1998-99 NCAA season.

In 1997, Outlaw began his first season with the Orlando Magic.\n\nThe 1997-98 season may very well be Outlaw’s finest in a fantastic career as he averaged 36 minutes per game, and played in all 82 regular season games that year. Known as the “hustler,” the Magic implemented the “Bo Hustle Award” for employees who exemplify Bo’s characteristics. Bo retired from Orlando in 2008 after 15 years in the NBA and currently works in the Magic front office as the Director of Community Relations.\n\nSheryl Swoopes - South Plains College\n\n2007\n\nBill Griffin - Howard College\n\nCoach Bill Griffin, who has been inducted into the Western Junior College Athletic Conference Hall of Fame as a member of the class of 2007, led the Howard College Baseball Program for 9 seasons and built an impressive legacy in the process.\n\nDuring his tenure as the Hawks’ skipper, he led the program to 347 wins, two conference crowns, two regional titles, one state title and the 1991 NJCAA National Championship.

He served as the Dean of Student Services for 6 years, as the Athletic Director for 8 years and as an Assistant Professor for 3 years. He did all of this while he was coaching baseball! Although his claim to fame lies on the baseball field, we know that he had an equally strong impact on the many student lives he touched. His wisdom and guidance for the students and his peers were invaluable.\n\nHis storied career also includes accomplishments such as being selected by the American Baseball Federation as one of four coaches chosen to coach in the World Baseball Games held in the Republic of China, which was a forerunner of baseball being introduced into the Olympic Games in 1980. Throughout his career, he has coached 23 All-Americans and has had 64 players drafted into professional baseball. Forty of the 64 players were drafted during his tenure with the Hawks.\n\nThe highest recognition or accomplishment for a player or a coach is to have their number retired.
