        "text": "We are now in the off-season of the two biggest college sports. But there is still plenty of news with transfers and spring recruiting. Through it all, we have you covered. Take a look at today’s links, plus the content coming your way on our site.\n\nOdds of joining the PAC.\n\nChris Murray is often the king of offseason content as far as Mountain West beat writers go, and this one is prime offseason content; conference realignment. He asked a sportsbook rep for odds and listed them here. To be clear, these are no current rumors, thanks in large part to the MW’s exit fee rules and the scheduling agreement the PAC signed with the MW saying it would have to pay large fees (about $10 million per school) if they didn’t merge with teh entire conference. Anyway, San Diego State gets the best odds with 28.6 percent, with Colorado State next at 25%. UNLV and Boise State are the only other teams above the 20% mark. Then there is a large drop to Fresno State at 13%, and six teams in the conference have under 10% odds. It should also be noted that no expansion is tied for second at 25%.\n\nCollege Football News Preview: UNLV.\n\nIt looks like College Football News is starting its preview of every team this summer. We will feature all of them in these links when they come up. The Rebels are first and all eyes are on them to see how they follow up last year’s spectacular season. They have a QB battle with two new transfers, but the weapons at RB and WR mostly all return and should help break the new passer in. The OL should also be a strength with 4 of 5 starters returning. On defense, UNLV should be solid again with the potential to be great. They will need to improve the pass rush, but the secondary looks better this year on paper. This article is a bit hesitant about them, mainly due to a tougher schedule, but overall, thinks they can be a bowl team in 2024.\n\nRam X-factors in 2024.\n\nEvery team relies on its star players to play like stars in order to be successful. Colorado State has no shortage of those players on both sides of the ball. However, they also need contributions from solid or roles players to plug some holes, and that has been an issue for them over the past two years. This post outlines some players who could potentially fill those roles in the 2024 season. Nuer Gatkuoth will get the first shot to fill the spot left by Mohamed Kamara, while Buom Jock will be counted on to reach his potential and slide in next to Chase Wilson at linebacker. The specialists at kicker and punter will be counted on to steal some hidden yardage and win the field position battles to help the defense. If Justin Wilson can provide the production he did at the end of last season, it would give the offense an added dimension. Also, the hope is that Isaiah Essissima can step into one of the open cornerback roles to aid the secondary.\n\nThe Broncos have a RT battle and some OL depth.\n\nAnyone who has watched Boise State over the past 5ish seasons knows that the offensive line was a rough spot for the offense until the end of the 2022 season. Now, as they return four players returning starters, they finally have some depth, especially on the interior. One starting spot, RT, is up for grabs this offseason, and it looks like Hall Schmidt and Kyle Cox are the top players vying for the position. The depth is short on experience but high on talent, with as many as eight or nine total players talented enough to play in some capacity.\n\nBulldogs playing in the Santa Barbara regional.\n\nOn the horizon:"
