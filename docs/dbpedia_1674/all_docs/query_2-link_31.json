        "text": "Last year, the Mountain West failed to have any team end up with ten wins in 2023. However, four different teams reached nine victories. Looking ahead to 2024, how many teams will reach the ten-win mark for the season?\n\nMike: The Mountain West needs a rebound this upcoming season. It seems like Boise State, Fresno State, and UNLV will be talented enough to reach 10 wins during the 2024 season. But things don’t always work according to plan, and some games on their schedules will prove quite the challenge. I think the Broncos and Rebels have the best chance, but at least one of them will fail to reach double-digit wins. Put me down for one team reaching that mark in 2024.\n\nJeff: the Mountain West will be in the crosshairs this year due to realignment and discussions of conference validity to be able to compete at a power level. The MWC needs to have several teams rise to the top with consistent performances. Over the past few years, we’ve seen San Jose State, Boise State, San Diego State, Utah State, Air Force, and Fresno State have all shown their talents to win. This year's preseason presents itself with a consensus three-team pick: Boise, Fresno, and UNLV. A dark horse could arise, but it’s a long shot. I asked my Pekingese pet her pick for the ten-game winner. She gave three barks for UNLV. No endorsement for Fresno and a downright paw down for Boise State. So our pick is one ten-game winner with the Running Rebels coming out on top.\n\nZane: The only teams that I believe have a shot are Fresno State and Boise State, and even with that said, both of these teams' schedules are extremely tough. I think Boise State will be able to reach 10 wins, however with them only losing to Oregon and either UNLV or Washington State. Boise State should be able to beat the rest of the teams they play.\n\nAdam E: I will pick two teams that will break the 10-win barrier. First, I am going to agree with others on here and pick Boise State. Their schedule appears to favor them to win 11 games this season, with the only loss being at Oregon. The Broncos should be favorites in all other matchups heading into the MWC Championship game and will be talked about as a legitimate playoff threat. The second team I will pick hasn’t been mentioned yet, and that is the Air Force Falcons. Air Force has a favorable schedule by missing both Boise State and UNLV in the regular season. With games against Merrimack, New Mexico, Army, Navy, Nevada, and a rebuilding Oregon State team. I think Boise State and Air Force will be on a collision course this season into the MWC Championship game with the winner heading to the playoffs.\n\nMatt: If we’re talking just regular season, I think we might only get 2, and it’ll be the two teams meeting in the conference title game. That’ll be some mix of Air Force, Boise, Fresno, or UNLV. I think we might have a team or two that falls just short in the regular season, but wins their bowl game to end the season with 10 wins. I think that’ll give us 3 total, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see 4 teams reach double digit win totals this season.\n\nDom: I think it’ll be between Boise State and UNLV to crack double-digit wins in the regular season. Fresno State and Air Force will get pretty close, and I could see one of them cracking 10 wins from winning a bowl game. It’ll definitely be harder this season for more teams to get that many wins, so I’ll go ahead and say Boise State and UNLV will be the only two.\n\nGraham: The easy answer to this question is Boise State. With the level of talent that the Broncos boast coming into this season and momentum under first year head coach Spencer Danielson, the Broncos are going to be a fun team to watch. They are facing hefty expectations and this season will be competing for a chance to get into the College Football Playoff.\n\nWith Boise State as a lock for 10 wins in this prediction, what other teams could reach 10 wins? I believe that UNLV will improve on last season after appearing in the Mountain West Championship game and a healthy Jeff Tedford leading Fresno State would help the Bulldogs tremendously. The problem for Fresno State is that they draw some difficult competition on the road in Michigan, UNLV, Air Force, and UCLA. The Bulldogs should be able to win most of their home games but winning the majority on the road is going to be difficult. UNLV draws some tougher opponents in general in Houston, Kansas, Oregon State, and San Diego State. Most of those games will also be on the road. I think that the Mountian West can produce a better number in terms of six win teams but in terms of 10 win, I am going to say that the Mountain West will have two ten win teams in Boise State and Fresno State."
