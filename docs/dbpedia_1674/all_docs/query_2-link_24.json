        "text": "RENO, Nev. - Nevada women's basketball assistant coach Ashley Elliott has been named to the Mountain West's 25th Season Team, the conference announced Saturday.\n\nEntering her sixth season on the Pack's coaching staff, Elliott was an All-American guard at Wyoming from 2001-05.\n\n\"The Mountain West has a rich history in women's basketball. As a competitor, and now coach in the conference, I have seen many remarkable players come through,\" Elliott said. \"To be recognized on the 25th Season Team is both a surprise and an honor. I had an incredible experience at the University of Wyoming, playing for impactful coaches with teammates who became lifelong friends and supported by a community that loves their university. To be able to coach and mentor student-athletes in the same conference and represent the University of Nevada is truly special. The University of Wyoming has always been close to my heart and the University of Nevada has become my home.\"\n\nAs a player, Elliott had a Hall of Fame level collegiate career at Wyoming in the early 2000s. She earned a Kodak/WBCA All-American honorable mention in 2005 and was a two-time First Team All-Mountain West selection.\n\nElliott ranks in the top 10 at Wyoming in career 3-point field goals made, assists, free throws made and steals. She was inducted into the Wyoming Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nAfter her stint in college basketball, Elliott played professionally overseas for two seasons with the Uni-Neuchatel Club of Switzerland.\n\nDuring the 2023-24 season as an assistant coach, Elliott was instrumental in Nevada's fourth-place finish in the Mountain West. Along with her role with recruiting and guard development, Elliott has helped Nevada's players obtain nine All-Mountain West honors since her arrival in Reno.\n\nJoining Nevada in 2018, Elliott served as the team's Director of Player Development before being elevated to her current position as an assistant coach. Elliott was previously on the coaching staff at Arizona State, Weber State and Idaho State.\n\nFrom its inception in 1999, the Mountain West has been committed to excellence in intercollegiate athletics, while promoting the academic missions of its member institutions. Progressive in its approach, the MW continues to cultivate opportunities for student-athletes to compete at the highest level while fostering academic achievement and sportsmanship. The Mountain West is celebrating its 25th Season of excellence on and off the court of play.\n\nElliott and the Wolf Pack play their first game of the 2024 Mountain West Championships on Monday at 2:30 p.m. against Colorado State in Las Vegas.\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS FOR THE MOUNTAIN WEST CHAMPIONSHIPS\n\nNevada women's basketball will be one of 11 teams competing for the Mountain West's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. First round action for the women's tournament begins March 10 and the championship game takes place on March 13.\n\nAll-session, general admission passes to the women's tournament (10 games) are available starting at just $75 and can be purchased here.
