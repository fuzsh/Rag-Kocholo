        "text": "When North Idaho Junior College opened its doors in 1933, it didn't take long for the college and the community to plant the seeds for a longstanding competitive men's basketball program. Since then the college has had teams for women's basketball, bowling, baseball, wrestling, tennis, men and women's golf, men and women's soccer, volleyball, softball, track, and cross country. In honor of the school's 75th anniversary celebration, the Athletics Department established the first North Idaho College Hall of Fame.\n\nMany outstanding teams, athletes, and coaches have contributed to the program's rich history and Tradition of Excellence. The inductees were selected by a Hall of Fame Committee utilizing feedback from current and former coaches, local media, community members, and longtime boosters.\n\nIn February 2009, following a well researched and definitive process, the committee selected 12 individuals who met the criteria and were inducted as charter members of NIC's Hall of Fame on May 2, 2009. The inaugural class included two coaches, nine student-athletes, and a contributor to the sport. Over 100 athletes were nominated for the prestigious charter class.\n\nThe North Idaho College Hall of Fame is located in the foyer of Perry Christianson Gymnasium on the NIC campus. Individual plaques displaying the members' photographs and biographies are on permanent display in the gymnasium lobby. Each year, additional members will be inducted. Athletes must be at least five years removed from competition at NIC for consideration.\n\nHall of Fame Nominations\n\nHall of Fame Nomination Form\n\nCollese Dornan\n\n2017\n\nWomen’s Volleyball\n\nThe Fife, Washington native found her way to North Idaho in 2004 and helped lead the resurgence of NIC Volleyball.
