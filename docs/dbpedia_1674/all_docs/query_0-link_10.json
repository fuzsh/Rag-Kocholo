        "text": "May 17, 2000\n\nBox Score\n\nLAS VEGAS - In their inaugural appearance in the Mountain West Conference Tournament, the Utah baseball team dropped its first game to Brigham Young 9-6. The Utes scored six runs on 11 hits with six errors and allowed BYU nine runs on 11 hits with three errors.\n\nUtah started the game with a run in the first inning on a double by third baseman Mike Goff. The Utes quickly lost the lead however giving up three runs to the Cougars in the bottom of the inning. Utah was unable to regain the lead falling prey to errors and leaving Ute 12 runners on base.\n\nCenterfielder Sam Swenson led the Utes at the plate going 2-for-4, including his 21st double of the season. He also scored two runs in the contest. First baseman Nate Weese was 2-for-5 scoring two RBI in the game and also hitting a double.\n\nGoff left the game in the fifth inning with a sprained ankle. His playing status for the rest of the tournament is still undetermined.\n\nSenior Jared Cavaness pitched the first 5.2 innings of the game and picked up the loss for Utah. He faced 27 batters, gave up nine hits and three earned runs. Pitcher John Lewis pitched the final 2.1 innings of the game giving up a pair of hits and runs.\n\nThe defeat drops the Utes in to the losers bracket to face conference champion New Mexico tomorrow. New Mexico defeated Air Force today 17-3. The Utes and the Lobos play at 3:00 p.m. at Earl E. Stadium in Las Vegas, Nev."
