        "text": "Pipi Hollingsworth, Ryan Khoury, Alison McInturff, Jane Quimby, Jeff Robbins and Louie Sakoda named to the 2024 class\n\n7/10/2024 12:50:00 PM\n\nThe University of Utah Athletics Department will honor six of its all-time best student-athletes when the 2024 Hall of Fame class is inducted in September. Baseball player Ryan Khoury, softball player Pipi Hollingsworth, women's swimmer Alison McInturff, women's basketball player Jane Quimby, men's tennis player Jeff Robbins and football kicker/punter Louie Sakoda have been selected for the Class of 2024.\n\n\"On behalf of the University of Utah and the Department of Athletics, it is a great honor to announce this phenomenal Class of 2024 for the Utah Athletics Hall of Fame,\" said Mark Harlan, Director of Athletics. \"Each has established an unforgettable legacy at the U, and those accomplishments and memories will now be permanently woven into the story of the Utes' incredible history of athletics excellence. We are thrilled to announce the Class of 2024 and look forward to their official induction celebration this fall.\"\n\nThe induction ceremony will take place on Friday, Sept. 27, at the Rice-Eccles Stadium & Tower. The class will also be honored at Utah's football game against Arizona the following day.\n\nPipi Hollingsworth – Softball\n\nNamed a second team All-American in 1987, Hollingsworth hit .368 with 11 doubles and four triples her senior season. She led a young Utes squad to the 1987 High Country Athletic Conference Championship and a berth in the NCAA Midwest Regional. The four-year starter and captain of the outfield earned all-conference honors twice.\n\nRyan Khoury – Baseball\n\nKhoury was an ABCA first team All-American as a senior in 2006. The shortstop also earned second-team All-America and District 8 Player of the Year honors from the NCBWA, and third-team recognition from Collegiate Baseball. Khoury hit .438 with 73 runs scored, 13 home runs, 56 RBI, 18 doubles, four triples and 16 stolen bases that season. He was drafted by Boston Red Sox in the 12th round in 2006.\n\nAlison McInturff – Women's Swimming\n\nMcInturff earned All-America honors in the 200 free in 2007 and won six Mountain West Conference championships over the course of her career. She claimed three league titles in the 200 free, as well as first-place finishes in the 100 free and the 800 free relay in 2005, and the 400 free relay in 2006. McInturff set six school records and qualified for the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials.\n\nJane Quimby – Women's Basketball\n\nHonored as a WBCA/Kodak honorable mention All-American in 1980, Quimby still ranks 15th in career scoring at Utah with 1,385 points and in the top 20 in field goals made and attempted. Quimby led Utah to at least 20 wins in each of her four seasons. The Utes claimed three Intermountain Athletic Conference regular season championships and had a combined league record of 41-6 during her four-year career.\n\nJeff Robbins – Men's Tennis\n\nRobbins was a nationally-ranked tennis player on three levels, first on the junior circuit, then as a collegiate player at Utah, and finally on the pro circuit. He was ranked No. 1 in the country for a brief time during his career with the Utes, and earned All-America honors in 1981. Robbins has been the chief executive officer of the Utah Sports Commission since the organization was founded in 2000.\n\nLouie Sakoda – Football\n\nSakoda became the second player in the history of the Football Writers Association of America to make first-team All-America at two positions, both as a kicker and a punter. He also was the second player ever to be named a finalist for the Ray Guy and Lou Groza awards in the same year as a senior. Sakoda became the first unanimous All-American in Utah football history in 2008, earning first team honors as a kicker by all five of the major organizations that comprise the unanimous All-America team. In 2007 he was a first-team All-America punter by two organizations."
