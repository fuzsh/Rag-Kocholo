        "text": "Any Nevada-UNLV game carries big stakes. But Thursday's Wolf Pack-Rebels women's soccer matchup at Mackay Stadium has even more on the line.\n\nNevada is a win or draw away in its regular-season finale against its rival from making its first Mountain West Tournament in a decade. The Wolf Pack sits in fifth place in the 12-team conference with a4-5-1 record and 13 points. UNLV (2-5-3 in league, nine points) would need a win over Nevada and handful of other things to happen to earn a top-six spot in the conference, which is required to qualify for the MW Tournament.\n\nThe Wolf Pack could lose to UNLV and still make the conference tournament but would rather not put itself in that position.\n\n\"Win and we are in,\" first-year Nevada head coach Vanessa Valentine said. \"That's the mindset going into Thursday. All the excitement around this game, there's so much involved. You've got UNLV, which obviously are our rivals right out of the gate. We're celebrating our seven seniors that are graduating, so it's senior week. And then, of course, the cherry on top: if we win, we go into the Mountain West conference tournament.\n\n\"You cannot write a better script to the ending of a movie than that. It's so incredibly exciting, and our girls are ready.\"\n\nNevada (6-8-5 overall) has won its most games since 2015. A victory over UNLV would give the Wolf Pack its most conference wins since 2009. After making the MW Tournament in 2012 and 2013, Nevada has not played in the postseason since then. This year, the Wolf Pack didn't win until its eighth game of the year but has since found its rhythm under Valentine's leadership.\n\n\"The biggest thing has always been the belief in these girls,\" Valentine said. \"Like, 'You guys are just as good, if not obviously better, than a lot of these teams that we're playing. It's getting them in shape, getting them some fitness. But, honestly, it's just building that confidence within themselves and within each other that they can go toe to toe with anybody. We've been proving that game after game. We beat San Diego State that went undefeated in our conference. We are the first ones to hand them their first loss. And from there, we've just continue to build that confidence of, 'Hey, you know what? We're good. We're here.' And the girls have really responded well to that.\"\n\nNevada women's soccer has been the Wolf Pack program with the least on-field success since it was created in 2000. The team has had just two winnings seasons, those coming in 2005 and 2006. Entering this year, Nevada was 22-83-11 in MW games. But in addition to knocking off MW-leading SDSU, the Wolf Pack also led second-place Boise State late before the Broncos rallied to a 2-1 victory and hung with third-place Utah State in a 2-1 loss.\n\nThe Wolf Pack has proven it can play with the conference's best teams and is now one win away from being able to prove that in the conference tournament.\n\n\"I don't know if there was necessarily a turning point,\" Valentine said. \"It was just growth. It was them getting used to my style, my voice and then again just that belief of, 'Hey, look, we're good. We can do this. We can pass the ball. We can play.' The big part was we started with Virginia right out of the gate. Our very first game was against the No. 5. team in the nation. My message to the girls was, 'I don't care who we play against. We could play against a U.S. national team. It does not matter to me. I am not scared and we should never be scared of any of our opponents.' If we stay organized, if we work together, there's only going to be growth from that.\"\n\nNevada's MW Tournament scenarios\n\n* Beat UNLV and earn No. 5 seed\n\n* Tie UNLV and earn No. 5 or No. 6 seed\n\n* Lose to UNLV and earn No. 5 or No. 6 seed if two of Fresno State, Air Force and New Mexico lose\n\n* Will not qualify for MW Tournament with loss to UNLV and two ofFresno State, Air Force and New Mexico winning\n\nYou can watch Vanessa Valentine's full NSN Tonight interview below."
