UNLV hit .209 in the series, but raised that average to .235 against the Bears with runners on base.\n\nBrent Johnson and Tony Schuler swung the bat well. Schuler put three hits together in his five plate appearances, while Johnson went 4-for-10 with a pair of RBIs. Garett Shitanishi hit the first home run of his career, high school or college, against the Bears on Sunday.\n\nTransfer Jeremy Weinberg made three appearances on the mound in relief, giving up only a single hit. Doug Thornton also looked impressive in relief, pitching 3.2 innings on Friday with six strikeouts.\n\nUNLV is 56-34 lifetime against Nevada, Reno. The Rebels dropped both games to the Wolfpack last season, 6-5 at home and 10-9 at Reno. Reno has won four of the last six meetings dating back to the 2000 season.\n\nNEVADA WOLFPACK\n\nNevada, Reno won two of three games against Pepperdine to start the 2002 season and enter this weekends series with a 1.04 ERA.

The Rebels will play home-and-home, three-game series against five conference foes for a total of 30 conference games.The conference tournament, to be held this year in Provo, UT, will decide the conference's automatic bid into the 2002 NCAA Baseball Championship.\n\nBASEBALL AMERICA\n\nBaseball America predicts UNLV will finish third in the Mountain West Conference this season, behind first place BYU and second place San Diego State.\n\nOther preseason conference honors include Brent Johnson as the Best Defensive Third Baseman and Robbie Van with the Best Breaking Ball.\n\nAUTOMATIC BID\n\nTwenty-nine conferences receive an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament. 2001 marked the first season the Mountain West Conference received an automatic bid.
