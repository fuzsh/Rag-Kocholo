        "text": "RENO, Nev. â€“ Nevada Baseball landed two alumni to the Mountain West 25th Season Baseball Team, which the conference announced Wednesday.\n\nBraden Shipley (2011-13) was named to the 10-pitcher list, while Dillan Shrum (2017-21) earned a spot in the 25-man position player group.\n\nShipley went 17-7 over his three-year Nevada pitching career, and finished his career with a 2.79 earned run average and 203 strikeouts, figures which rank second and sixth, respectively, in the Nevada record book through the 2024 season. After appearing primarily at shortstop with just two mound appearances as a freshman in 2011, Shipley moved to the mound full-time in 2012, going 9-4 with a 2.20 ERA and was named WAC Pitcher of the Year.\n\nIn his lone season playing in the Mountain West (2013), Shipley went 7-3 with a 2.77 ERA and 102 strikeouts, being named Mountain West Co-Pitcher of the Year and to the conference's First Team.\n\nHe also holds the distinction as the highest-selected athlete in Nevada history, pertaining to a professional sports draft, being tabbed with the 15th overall pick of the 2013 MLB June Amateur Draft by the Arizona Diamondbacks. Shipley made his major-league debut on July 25, 2016, getting the starting nod and even going 1-for-3 with a double at the plate against the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nShipley played three seasons (2016-18) in the majors, appearing in 26 games (14 starts) and going 4-6.\n\nShrum capped a five-year career with the Wolf Pack with one of the best offensive seasons in program history, in 2021. That season, Shrum set program single-season records in batting average (.468) and slugging (.968), with an eye-popping OPS of 1.495. He hit 15 homers, doubled 15 times, and drove in 47 runs, being named Tony Gwynn Mountain West Player of the Year, and earning second-team All-America recognition from D1Baseball and ABCA/Rawlings.\n\nHis .468 batting average ranked second in the country, with his slugging percentage, home run total, and on-base percentage (.527) also leading the conference as Nevada claimed the Mountain West title and made its first NCAA Regional appearance since 2000.\n\nShrum batted .333 over his Nevada career, and ranks tied for 10th all-time in doubles (49). He finished his career with exactly 200 hits, 111 runs scored, 38 home runs, 146 RBIs, and a slugging percentage of .618.\n\nShrum was also one of the Wolf Pack's top performers in the classroom. Having earned his degree in biology with emphasis in cell and molecular biology in 2020, Shrum was named to the CoSIDA (now CSC) 2021 Academic All-America Division I Baseball First Team, becoming, at the time, Nevada's 19th all-time academic All-American.\n\nFollowing his Nevada career, Shrum signed a free-agent deal with the Kansas City Royals, and is currently in his second season with the Northwest Arkansas Naturals, the Royals' Double-A affiliate."
