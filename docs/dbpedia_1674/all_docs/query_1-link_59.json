        "text": "Complete List of NAIA Colleges with Baseball Teams\n\nThe NAIA, or National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, sets the athletic rules for its 300+ member colleges and its 212 baseball programs. The NAIA is characterized by its smaller, close-knit campuses, competitive teams and well-rounded college experience for athletes. Also, a distinction from the NCAA is that there are no recruiting restrictions when it comes to coach and student-athlete communications. For student-athletes who want to study abroad, participate in extracurricular activities and enjoy a more traditional college experience, the NAIA might be a great fit.\n\nDoes the NAIA award baseball scholarships?\n\nYes. Unlike NCAA Division 3 schools, the NAIA does offer athletic scholarship opportunities. The amount of money athletes can receive as part of their NAIA baseball scholarship will depend on the school, coach, talent level and position. Each program is allowed to offer up to 12 scholarships, which is more than any other NCAA four-year school. NAIA schools also have other financial aid opportunities outside of athletic scholarships. Potential recruits should look into academic, merit and need-based scholarships to bring down the overall cost of tuition.\n\nWhat is the Avista NAIA World Series?\n\nPlayed in Lewiston, Idaho, the Avista NAIA World Series originated in 1957 and is the championship tournament of the NAIA. The double-elimination tournament has been held at Lewis-Clark State College in Lewsiton, Idaho since 2000. Westmont College won its first championship title in 2023.\n\nNAIA baseball rankings\n\nThe NAIA polls ask baseball coaches across each conference to rank the top NAIA baseball programs. Below is a list of the top NAIA baseball colleges according to NCSA’s own Power Rankings.\n\nDordt University\n\nIndiana Wesleyan University\n\nOklahoma City University\n\nUniversity of Michigan – Dearborn\n\nMarian University – Indiana\n\nMadonna University\n\nNorthwestern College – Iowa\n\nTaylor University\n\nSt. Ambrose University\n\nSoutheastern University"
