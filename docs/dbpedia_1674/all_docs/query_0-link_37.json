        "meta_description": "The 2017 baseball season – Little League Baseball and Major League Baseball alike — is heading toward an exciting finish.\r\n\r\nThe Little League World Series West Region tournament kicked off last weekend with Santa Margarita representing Southern California and San Ramon’s Canyon Creek Little League representing Northern California in the six-team regional field.\r\n\r\nTournament action continues through the upcoming weekend. The West region champion advances to the Little League World Series in South Williamsport, Pa., later this month.\r\n\r\nThe Padres, meanwhile, are once again well out of contention (a staggering 30 games back) in the National League West Division standings.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no shortage of teams vying for postseason playoff berths in both MLB’s National and American leagues as summer turns into fall.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Nationals (NL East), Los Angeles Dodgers (NL West) and Houston Astros (AL West) are runaway leaders in their respective divisions while a four-team race appears to be developing for the NL Central title between the defending World Series champion Chicago Cubs, Milwaukee Brewers, St. Louis Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees are once again embroiled in a tight finish in the AL East while the Cleveland Indians and Kansas City Royals are pushing each other for the AL Central banner.\r\n\r\nChula Vistan John Jaso remains a contributor for the Pirates with eight home runs, 26 RBI and 20 runs scored in 207 at-bats this season.\r\n\r\nSantee native Stephen Strasburg, the first pick in the 2009 MLB Draft by the Nationals, is currently recovering from an injury, progressing to throwing bullpen practice as he works toward rejoining the active rotation.\r\n\r\nThe West Hills High School alum has posted a 10-3 record so far this season with a 3.25 earned-run average in 20 starts. He has 141 strikeouts in 121 innings pitched.\r\n\r\nAdrian Gonzalez, the No. 1 MLB draft pick in 2000 out of Eastlake High School, has been moved to the 60-day disabled list with a herniated disc in his back and is expected to remain out of action with the Dodgers until the middle of this month.\r\n\r\nGonzalez, an original draft pick by the Florida Marlins, has played for four MLB teams in his 14-year professional career. He played two seasons with the Texas Rangers in 2004-5, then enjoyed a five-year stay with the hometown Padres (2006-10).\r\n\r\nHe joined the Dodgers in 2012 after a two-year stint with the Red Sox.\r\n\r\nHe’s reached postseason play in a Los Angeles uniform the past four seasons. He helped lead the Padres to the National League Divisional series against St. Louis in 2006.\r\n\r\nA five-time MLB All-Star Game selection, four-time Golden Glove award winner and two-time Silver Slugger award winner, Gonzalez has appeared in 49 games this season with a .255 hitting average, one home run and 23 RBI.\r\n\r\nAt 35, baseball has been very kind to him and his family. He’s making $22 million this season. Over the duration of his MLB career, he’s made more than $145 million.\r\n\r\nLocals only\r\nThe College World Series wrapped up in June. Locally, UC San Diego finished runner-up in the Division II championship game after winning the West regional tournament.\r\n\r\nA pair of Chula Vistans – pitchers Troy Cruz (Bonita Vista) and Adrian Orozco (Otay Ranch) – helped the Toreros post a final 44-19 record.\r\n\r\nSan Diego State University’s baseball team was also in the running in the Division I tournament. The Aztecs qualified for the Long Beach regional after winning the Mountain West Conference championship tournament.\r\n\r\nSDSU received the No. 4 seed in the regional tournament behind top-seeded Long Beach State, second-seeded UCLA and third-seeded Texas.\r\n\r\nThe Aztecs had defeated both Long Beach State and UCLA twice in the regular season.\r\n\r\nHowever, a 6-0 loss to Long Beach State in the opening round promptly dropped SDSU into the elimination bracket.\r\n\r\nThe Aztecs eliminated UCLA, 3-2, in a 13-inning nail-biter on the second day of competition but could not cinch a comeback as they lost, 7-4, in a third-round game to Long Beach State to suffer elimination themselves from the tournament.\r\n\r\nSDSU finished 42-21 to close the season. The 42 victories tied for the most for the program in the last 15 seasons.\r\n\r\nThe Aztecs had quite a bit to be proud of as their season ended in early June. SDSU won its a fourth Mountain West Conference tournament title in the last five seasons and advanced to an NCAA regional for the fourth time in five years.\r\n\r\nSDSU’s 2017 roster featured a robust five South County players: senior infielders Andrew Martinez and Andrew Brown, freshman outfielder Julian Escobedo, sophomore catcher Dean Nevarez, freshman pitcher Tre Brown.\r\n\r\nEscobedo, Nevarez and Tre Brown all are graduates of Eastlake High School while Martinez is a Mater Dei Catholic High School alum and Andrew Brown attended The Rock Academy.\r\n\r\nMartinez hit .320 in 59 games for the Aztecs this spring. He scored 31 runs, slugged 19 doubles and eight home runs and drove in 35 runs.\r\n\r\nHe was the MVP of the Mountain West tournament, which SDSU won to advance to the NCAA regional.\r\n\r\nMartinez stroked the game-winning two-RBI single in the bottom of the eighth inning in the championship game of the MW tournament as SDSU defeated Fresno State 5-3.\r\n\r\nHe hit a two-run home in the top of the ninth at UCLA to give SDSU an 8-6 win over the Bruins in a non-conference game on May 2.\r\n\r\nBrown appeared in 51 games for SDSU in 2017 with 12 doubles, three home runs, 37 RBI and a .332 hitting average.\r\n\r\nHe ranked second on the team with 25 multiple-hit games.\r\n\r\nNevarez appeared in 52 games, slammed nine home runs and collected 31 RBI while scoring 33 times. He hit .301 at the plate.\r\n\r\nHe finished second on the team in home runs, including one in the championship game at the Mountain West tournament.\r\n\r\nEscobedo played in 48 games, racked up 21 hits, including two triples and six RBI. He stole nine bases (nine-for-nine) to rank third on the team in that category while posting a .226 hitting average.\r\n\r\nTre Brown made only two appearances as a true freshman this season, tossing one inning.\r\n\r\nMartinez was among 36 SDSU student-athletes who were honored for their high achievement in the classroom as Mountain West Scholar-Athletes for the 2016-17 school year.\r\n\r\nGo Aztecs\r\n\r\nSeveral Aztecs earned postseason honors. Outfielder Tyler Adkinson and shortstop Danny Sheehan were both selected to the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA)/Rawlings NCAA Division I West All-Region First Team.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, pitcher Brett Seeburger was selected in the 10th round of the 2017 Major League Baseball draft by St. Louis. He was one of four SDSU players taken in the draft.\r\n\r\nSecond baseman Alan Trejo was tabbed in the 16th round by the Colorado Rockies while pitcher C.J. Saylor was selected in the 28th round by St. Louis. Adkinson was taken in the 32nd round by the L.A. Dodgers while pitcher Marcus Reyes was a 38th-round pick by the Toronto Blue Jays.\r\n\r\nMore than 20 current and incoming Aztecs competed in summer ball leagues around the country.\r\n\r\nOf note, Nevarez hit a home run in his first at-bat for the Duluth Huskies in the Northwoods League.\r\n\r\nLittle League\r\n\r\nAction in the West region tournament kicked into gear on Sunday as Hilo (Hawaii) edged Chandler National (Arizona), 2-1, and Santa Margarita blasted Nevada champion Summerlin South from Las Vegas, 7-2, to each win their opening games in the double-elimination tournament.\r\n\r\nIn Monday’s second-round games, Hilo hammered Utah champion Dixie Little League from St. George, 14-5, while Santa Margarita slipped past Canyon Creek, 3-2, to each win their opening two contests.\r\n\r\nSanta Margarita’s Bobby Gray set down the first 12 batters he faced and finished the game with 10 strikeouts while allowing three hits in five-and-two-thirds innings to pick up the win in Sunday’s opener.\r\n\r\nSanta Margarita, which eliminated Eastlake Little League in the Division III championship game on July 30, won Monday’s game on a walk-off suicide squeeze bunt by Garret Strenger. Mason Kellerman scored the game-winning run in the bottom of the sixth inning after first staking the SoCal champions to an early 2-0 lead with a two-RBI double.\r\n\r\nElimination games are scheduled Tuesday and Wednesday before Santa Margarita and Hilo hook up in a highly anticipated winners bracket matchup on Thursday (6 p.m., ESPN).\r\n\r\nThe elimination bracket final is scheduled Friday, Aug. 11, at 6 p.m., while the championship game is scheduled Saturday, Aug. 12, at 6 p.m. Both games will be telecast on ESPN.\r\n\r\nFor tournament updates, visit the website at http://www.llbws.org/llbbws/west.htm\r\n\r\nLittle League World Series\r\nWest Region Tournament\r\nParticipating Teams\r\n•Chandler National Little League (Arizona)\r\n•Hilo Little League (Hawaii)\r\n•Summerlin South Little League (Nevada)\r\n•Canyon Creek Little League (Northern California)\r\n•Santa Margarita (Southern California)\r\n•Dixie Little League (Utah)\r\n\r\nGame schedule\r\nSunday, Aug. 8\r\nHawaii 2, Arizona, 1.
