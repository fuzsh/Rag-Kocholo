When the conference began in 1969, its name was the Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA). After nineteen years, in 1988, its name was changed to the Big West Conference.[1] The conference stopped sponsoring college football after the 2000 season.\n\nHistory[]\n\nCreation of the Pacific Coast Athletic Association[]\n\nThe Big West Conference was formed on July 1, 1969, as the Pacific Coast Athletic Association. The charter all-sports members of the PCAA were Cal State Los Angeles, Fresno State, Long Beach State, San Diego State, San Jose State, and UC Santa Barbara. The University of the Pacific joined only for football, becoming an all-sports member two years later.[2]\n\nFour of these charter members (Cal State Los Angeles, Fresno State, Long Beach State, and San Diego State) had previously been members of the nation's premier Division II conference, the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA). After capturing multiple national championships, the members sought a higher level of play, which could be found within the university ranks. Charter football member Pacific and charter all-sports members San Jose State and UC Santa Barbara had also been CCAA members in the past, but had moved to the West Coast Athletic Conference (now West Coast Conference) before joining the PCAA.\n\nThe seven schools formally met in May 1969 and finalized the creation of the PCAA less than two months later.\n\nEvolution[]\n\nSince its inception as the Pacific Coast Athletic Association, the conference has seen many changes throughout the years. Utah State was the first institution outside of California to join the conference in 1978. This opened the floodgates for many other schools to affiliate with the PCAA; notable schools include UNLV, Nevada, Louisiana Tech, and Boise State, among others.\n\nBig West Conference Sports\n\nBaseball - men's\n\nBasketball - men's and women's\n\nCross Country - men's and women's\n\nGolf - men's and women's\n\nSoccer - men's and women's\n\nSoftball - women's\n\nTennis - men's and women's\n\nTrack & Field - men's and women's\n\nVolleyball - women's\n\nWater Polo - women's\n\nIn 1983, the PCAA became the first western conference to introduce women's athletic programs, giving the opportunity for all its members to have their women student-athletes compete at the same level as their male counterparts. This proved vital for Hawaiʻi as their only participation in the conference was for their women's sports.\n\nHowever, turnover of universities started to take its toll. Many left to join conferences that were perceived as more well-known, such as the Western Athletic Conference or the Mountain West Conference, while others did not see the benefit of travel since historically many of the teams have been California-based. From the departures of Idaho and Utah State in 2005 until the arrival of Hawaiʻi in 2012, all members were based in California, reducing both the cost and travel time between the universities. When Hawaiʻi joined, it agreed to help defray a portion of travel costs to that state for the league's California members. Between full and associate members, there have been no fewer than 25 members in the conference's history, while only three of the original seven charter members remain (Long Beach State, Pacific, and UC Santa Barbara; in 2013, Pacific will leave).\n\nThe change to the Big West[]\n\nTo mark its 20th year as an athletic conference, in 1988 the Pacific Coast Athletic Association decided to change its name to the Big West Conference. The move signaled the changing landscape within the conference. With such schools as Utah State, UNLV, Nevada, New Mexico State, and Hawaii now in the fold, the name change was more representative of the population. In addition, the conference had signed a contract with ESPN to have its men's basketball games telecast as the third game of a triple header known as \"Big Monday\" - the other conferences being featured were the Big East and the Big 12 so the name Big West fit the \"big\" theme. Despite the eventual departure of all non-California based teams, the widely-known \"Big West Conference\" name has remained constant.\n\nMembership[]\n\nCurrent members[]\n\nInstitution Nickname Location Founded Joined Type Enrollment NCAA Team\n\nChampionships Cal Poly !California Polytechnic State University\n\n(Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) Mustangs San Luis Obispo, California 1901 1996 Public (California State University system) 19,777 0 California State University, Fullerton\n\n(Cal State Fullerton) Titans Fullerton, California 1957 1974 Public (California State University system) 36,996 14 California State University, Northridge\n\n(Cal State Northridge) Matadors Northridge, California 1958 2001 Public (California State University system) 36,207 0 Hawaii !University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Rainbow Warriors\n\nRainbows\n\nWarriors\n\nRainbow Wahine Honolulu, Hawaii 1907 2012 Public (University of Hawaiʻi system) 20,435 3 Long Beach !California State University, Long Beach\n\n(Long Beach State) 49ers Long Beach, California 1949 1969 Public (California State University system) 37,890 4 Pacific !University of the Pacific Tigers Stockton, California 1851 1969,\n\n1971[3] Private 3,740 2 University of California, Davis\n\n(UC Davis) Aggies Davis, California 1908 2007 Public (University of California system) 31,426 1 University of California, Irvine\n\n(UC Irvine) Anteaters Irvine, California 1965 1977 Public (University of California system) 27,631 3 University of California, Riverside\n\n(UC Riverside) Highlanders Riverside, California 1954 2001 Public (University of California system) 20,746 0 University of California, Santa Barbara\n\n(UC Santa Barbara) Gauchos Santa Barbara, California 1905 1969,\n\n1976[4] Public (University of California system) 20,559 2\n\nNote\n\nAll but one of the current full members are public institutions, with all but one located in California.

Of the nine schools that were in the WAC before the 2010–12 conference realignment, only Hawaii has not spent some time in the Big West as a football participant – it was a Big West member only in women's sports. Of all the former members, Cal State Los Angeles is the only team that reverted to Division II level.\n\nSchool names and nicknames reflect those used by the institutions when they were Big West members. One school has changed its name (Southwestern Louisiana, now Louisiana–Lafayette) and one its nickname (Arkansas State, from Indians to Red Wolves).\n\nInstitution Nickname Location Membership Type Joined Left Current Conference Arkansas State University[5] Indians Jonesboro, Arkansas Football only 1993,\n\n1999 1996,\n\n2001 Sun Belt Boise State University Broncos Boise, Idaho Full member 1996 2001 Mountain West California State University, Fresno Bulldogs Fresno, California Full member 1969 1992 Mountain West California State University, Los Angeles Golden Eagles Los Angeles, California Full member 1969 1974 CCAA Idaho !University of Idaho Vandals Moscow, Idaho Full member 1996 2005 WAC* Louisiana Tech University Bulldogs Ruston, Louisiana Football only 1993 1996 WAC* Unlv !University of Nevada, Las Vegas Rebels Las Vegas, Nevada Full member 1982 1996 Mountain West Nevada !University of Nevada, Reno Wolf Pack Reno, Nevada Full member 1992 2000 Mountain West New Mexico State University Aggies Las Cruces, New Mexico Full member 1983 2000 WAC North Texas !University of North Texas Mean Green Denton, Texas Full member 1996 2000 Sun Belt* Northern Illinois University Huskies DeKalb, Illinois Football only 1993 1996 MAC San Diego State University Aztecs San Diego, California Full member 1969 1978 Mountain West San Jose State University Spartans San Jose, California Full member 1969 1996 WAC* Southwestern Louisiana !University of Southwestern Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns Lafayette, Louisiana Football only 1993 1996 Sun Belt Utah State University Aggies Logan, Utah Full member 1978 2005 WAC*\n\nNote\n\nAsterisk (*) indicates school has announced intention to change conferences in the near future.

Baseball and Women's Volleyball have been the strongest because of the number of championships won. Cal State Fullerton has won 4 College World Series in 1979, 1984, 1995, and 2004. Long Beach State has won 5 Women's Volleyball championships in 1972, 1973, 1989, 1993, 1998, the last three being NCAA sanctioned titles. In 1998 Misty May-Treanor led the 49ers to a 36-0 record on route to the program's most recent title. Pacific won back to back Women's Volleyball titles in 1985 and 1986.\n\nWhen UNLV won the school's lone Division I Basketball Championship in 1990, by beating Duke University by a record setting margin of 30 points in the 103-73 victory, they were a member of the Big West Conference.\n\nThe current members of the Big West have won a total of nine NCAA national championships including UC Santa Barbara’s most recent Men’s Soccer Championship in 2006.\n\nChampions[]\n\nBaseball[]\n\nMain article: List of Big West Conference baseball champions\n\nMen's Basketball[]\n\nMain article: Big West Conference Men's Basketball Tournament\n\nThe most recent winner of the Big West Conference Tournament is Long Beach State (2012), who won the tournament as the number 1 seed. .[7]\n\nWomen's Basketball[]\n\nMain article: Big West Conference Women's Basketball Tournament\n\n[]\n\nAn asterisk denotes the participant in the bowls that invited the Big West champion:\n\nPasadena (1969–70), California (1981–91), Las Vegas (1992–96), and Humanitarian (1997–2000)[8]\n\nFootball Champions Year University 1969 San Diego State* 1970 Long Beach State* & San Diego State 1971 Long Beach State 1972 San Diego State 1973 San Diego State 1974 San Diego State 1975 San Jose State 1976 San Jose State 1977 Fresno State 1978 San Jose State and Utah State 1979 Utah State 1980 Long Beach State 1981 San Jose State* 1982 Fresno State* 1983 Cal State Fullerton* 1984 Cal State Fullerton (UNLV* forfeited) 1985 Fresno State* 1986 San Jose State* 1987 San Jose State* 1988 Fresno State* 1989 Fresno State* 1990 San Jose State* 1991 Fresno State* & San Jose State 1992 Nevada* 1993 Utah State* & Southwestern La. 1994 UNLV*, Southwestern La., & Nevada 1995 Nevada* 1996 Nevada* & Utah State 1997 Utah State* & Nevada 1998 Idaho* 1999 Boise State* 2000 Boise State*\n\nThe Big West Conference discontinued football following the 2000 season.[9]\n\nFacilities[]\n\nSchool Basketball Arena Capacity Baseball Stadium Capacity Soccer Stadium Capacity Cal Poly Mott Gym 3,032 Robin Baggett Stadium 1,734 Alex G.
