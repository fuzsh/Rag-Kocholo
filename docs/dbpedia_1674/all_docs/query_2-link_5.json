UNLV will travel to tournaments in Lancaster, Calif., and Tempe, Ariz., over the next two weekends.\n\nMICHIGAN STATE SPARTANS\n\nFor the second time in three years, the Spartans will open their season in Las Vegas. MSU went 1-4 to open in 2000, with their only win coming against West Virginia, 6-5.\n\nSix of the team's nine seniors are pitchers, but it is sophomore Bryan Gale who is expected to lead the staff. Gale is a 2001 Freshman All-American and All-Big Ten returnee. He went went 9-1 last season with a 3.53 ERA.\n\nThe Rebels hold a 4-1 overall series advantage over the Spartans. UNLV won the last meeting 10-4 during the 2000 UNLV Desert Classic.\n\nCREIGHTON BLUEJAYS\n\nCreighton opened the season with a 10-9 loss to Kansas State on Tuesday.\n\nThe Jays have been post-season competitors two of the last three years and have their eyes set on the NCAA Regionals again in 2002. Head Coach Jack Dahm returns five starters from last year's team which finished 21-31.\n\nThe Rebels hold a 6-2 overall series advantage over the Jays.

UNLV took two of three games from Creighton in the opening series of the 1999 season.\n\nFRESHMAN ALL AMERICAN\n\nEach team in the tournament has a 2001 Freshman All-American honoree on its roster. The Rebels are represented by third baseman/outfielder Brent Johnson. The Spartans bring pitcher Bryan Gale. The Jays bring pitcher Steve Grasley and the Gauchos are represented by Matt Vasquez.\n\nHITTING STREAKS\n\nDespite the poor offensive output during last weekend's trip to Fullerton, junior second baseman Garett Shitanishi extended his season hitting streak to seven games. No one else on the team can credit a streak longer than one game.\n\nCONFERENCE NUMBERS\n\nBrent Johnson is tied with SDSU's Anthony Gwynn and BYU's Cameron Goughlan for the top spot in stolen bases this season with three. UNLV is also tied with New Mexico for team stolen bases at five.\n\nSTRENGTH OF SCHEDULE\n\nThe Rebels will play 17 games against teams that participated in the 2001 NCAA Baseball Championship, including Arizona State, Cal-Berkley, Cal-State Fullerton, Oklahoma State and BYU among others. The first 20 games for the Rebels may be the most challenging as 14 of their opponents during that stretch are ranked in the top 30 of the Collegiate Baseball Preseason Poll.\n\nEach season also brings the tough grind of Mountain West Conference play. The Rebels will play home-and-home, three-game series against five conference foes for a total of 30 conference games.The conference tournament, to be held this year in Provo, UT, will decide the conference's automatic bid into the 2002 NCAA Baseball Championship.\n\nBASEBALL AMERICA\n\nBaseball America predicts UNLV will finish third in the Mountain West Conference this season, behind first place BYU and second place San Diego State.\n\nOther preseason conference honors include Brent Johnson as the Best Defensive Third Baseman and Robbie Van with the Best Breaking Ball.\n\nAUTOMATIC BID\n\nTwenty-nine conferences receive an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament. 2001 marked the first season the Mountain West Conference received an automatic bid. The winner of the MWC Championships, held in Provo, Utah May 22-26, will receive the automatic bid.\n\nCONFERENCE TOURNAMENT\n\nThe 2002 Mountain West Conference Baseball Championship will be hosted by BYU in Provo, Utah. All six Mountain West Conference teams will compete in the double-elimination tournament May 22-26. Seedings will be decided by regular season results in conference games.\n\nAll requests for media credentials for the Mountain West Conference Baseball Championship should be submitted in writing to Assistant Director of Communications Ron Christian at the MWC office or BYU Baseball Contact Ralph Zobell prior to the event."
