The MWC officially began operations in July 1999. Geographically, the MW covers a broad expanse of the western United States, with member institutions located in California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Wyoming, and has announced expansion into Hawaii, and back into Utah in 2012. The conference introduced a new logo for the 2011 season to reflect on the changes. Craig Thompson has served as Commissioner of the MW since its founding in 1999.\n\nCharter members included Air Force, BYU, Colorado State, New Mexico, San Diego State, UNLV, Utah, and Wyoming. Before forming the Mountain West Conference, seven of the eight charter members had been longtime members of the Western Athletic Conference; half were WAC charter members at its formation in 1962 - UNLV had only joined the WAC in 1996.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe WAC expanded from 10 to 16 universities in 1996, absorbing three teams from the defunct Southwest Conference (SWC) (Rice, SMU, and TCU), adding two from the Big West (San Jose State and UNLV), and Tulsa from the Missouri Valley. After three football seasons, most of the pre-expansion members decided that the new WAC was oversized, and departed to form the Mountain West Conference. The MWC added a ninth team in 2005: TCU, also a former WAC and SWC member, which joined after four seasons in Conference USA.\n\nSee also: 2010–12 NCAA conference realignment: MWC\n\nOn June 11, 2010, Boise State University agreed to join the conference as its tenth member. On June 17, 2010, Utah announced it would be leaving the Mountain West to join what would become the Pacific-12 Conference. On August 18, 2010, amidst rumors that Brigham Young was considering leaving the Mountain West to go independent in football and rejoin the Western Athletic Conference in all other sports, the Mountain West Conference officially extended invitations to California State University, Fresno and the University of Nevada, Reno. Fresno State and Nevada accepted and would become the tenth and eleventh members of the league.[1] BYU announced on August 31, 2010 that it would leave the Mountain West Conference and go Independent in football and become a member of the West Coast Conference (WCC) in other sports starting in 2011.[2] On November 29, 2010, Texas Christian University announced all athletic teams would move to the Big East Conference effective in 2012.[3] (Less than a year later, on October 10, 2011, TCU announced it would not join the Big East but would join the Big 12 in 2012 instead.)[4] On December 10, 2010, the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa accepted a bid to become the 10th member of the conference for football only.[5] These changes would leave the Mountain West Conference with 10 teams for the 2012 football season.\n\nThe MWC champion has qualified for a BCS bowl four times since the BCS formula was tweaked to allow non-BCS conferences to play in BCS bowls if ranked in the top 12; however, all 4 teams that qualified are no longer with the conference.\n\nOn October 14, 2011 the Mountain West & Conference USA announced a plan for a football only alliance.[6]\n\nOn February 13, 2012, the Mountain West & Conference USA (C-USA) announced that both conferences would be dissolving after the 2012-2013 season to reform into one conference with at least 15 members for all sports, and a 16th team, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa as a football-only member.[7] However, when the two conferences discussed their plans with the NCAA, they were told that due to NCAA rules, they would forfeit substantial revenues. Specifically, the new conference would receive only one automatic bid to NCAA championships; at least one of the former conferences would lose future revenue distributions from the NCAA men's basketball tournament; and at least one former conference would not be able to collect exit fees from any members that departed to join the new conference.[8] As a result, the Mountain West and C-USA apparently backed away from a full merger. In late March of that year, the commissioners of both conferences stated that all 16 schools had entered into binding agreements to form a new \"association\",[9] although the Mountain West and C-USA will now apparently remain separate legal entities.[8] As many as eight more schools could be added to the alliance by the time membership is finalized in June 2012.[9]\n\nOn May 2, San Jose State and Utah State agreed to join the conference for the 2013-2014 academic year.\n\nMembers[]\n\nCurrent members[]\n\nInstitution Nickname Location Type Enrollment Year Joined Endowment Research[10] United States Air Force Academy Falcons Colorado Springs, Colorado Federal 4,417 1998 $24 million $44.3 million Boise State University Broncos Boise, Idaho Public 21,179 2011 $61 million $11.2 million Colorado State University Rams Fort Collins, Colorado Public 24,875 1998 $398 million $295.3 million University of Nevada, Las Vegas Rebels Las Vegas, Nevada Public 29,069 1998 $114 million $50.8 million University of New Mexico Lobos Albuquerque, New Mexico Public 34,674 1998 $300 million $197.6 million San Diego State University Aztecs San Diego, California Public 33,790 1998 $109 million $70.0 million Texas Christian University Horned Frogs Fort Worth, Texas Private 8,696 2005 $1,100 million $3.6 million University of Wyoming Cowboys Laramie, Wyoming Public 12,496 1998 $220 million $74.7 million\n\nTCU will leave the conference in 2012 to become a member of the Big 12 Conference.

Many of its member schools participate in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation for sports not sponsored by the Mountain West Conference. Two MW members have affiliate memberships with the Pacific-12 Conference - San Diego State for men's soccer and Boise State for wrestling.\n\nSince the 2009-10 season, the Mountain West and Missouri Valley Conferences have held an annual challenge series between all members of the MWC and an equal number of the 10 MVC teams in basketball. The first game was on November 13, featuring the Bradley Braves and the BYU Cougars in Provo and it concluded on December 23 with the Wyoming Cowboys visiting the Northern Iowa Panthers in Cedar Falls, Iowa. The challenge is similar to the ACC-Big Ten Challenge, which pits men's basketball teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Big Ten Conference.[13]\n\nTelevision network[]\n\nSee article
