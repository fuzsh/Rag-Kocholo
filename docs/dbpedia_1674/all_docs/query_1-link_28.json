        "text": "Mountain West Football: 2023 Postseason All-Conference Team, Individual Honors Announced\n\nThe regular season is in the books. Here are the all-Mountain West teams, players of the year, and coach of the year.\n\nContact/Follow @MattK_FS & @MWCwire\n\nOnly the best of the best.\n\nThe Mountain West football season is nearly complete, but before Saturday’s championship tilt between Boise State and UNLV and bowl games after that, the conference media announced its selections for the all-Mountain West two-deep and individual awards.\n\nBoise State running back Ashton Jeanty earned the nod as the Mountain West’s offensive player of the year, becoming the first sophomore to do so since Nevada’s Carson Strong in 2020. Though he was limited to just ten games because of injury, the Broncos’ super sophomore led the conference with 110.9 rushing yards per game and 164.6 all-purpose yards per game and finished second with 18 total touchdowns. According to Pro Football Focus, Jeanty’s 92.4 overall grade also led the Mountain West and ranked third among all FBS running backs.\n\nColorado State’s Mohamed Kamara was tabbed as the Mountain West’s defensive player of the year, the first Ram to be decorated as such since Shaquil Barrett in 2013. His 13 sacks and 17 tackles for loss both paced the conference, as did the 35 quarterback hurries for which he was credited by PFF, while his 83.2 overall grade is third-best among all Mountain West defenders.\n\nMeanwhile, UNLV kicker Jose Pizano stepped up to win the conference’s special teams player of the year award. After transferring in from Missouri State, Pizano led the Mountain West in connecting on 23-of-25 field goals, including a perfect 16-of-16 inside of 40 yards, and finished second overall with 119 total points. That made him just the second Rebel to crack the century mark dating back to 2009.\n\nUNLV quarterback Jayden Maiava was named the conference’s freshman of the year, becoming the fourth Rebel in the last seven seasons to earn the honor. He stepped into a difficult situation when incumbent starter Doug Brumfield was sidelined by injury in September, but the Vegas native stepped up and finished the regular season with a 64.1% completion rate, 2,626 passing yards, 14 touchdowns, and a 2.1% interception rate. More than any of the other individual awards, this one may have been a foregone conclusion after Maiava had already earned freshman of the week five times throughout 2023, a conference first.\n\nLastly, UNLV’s Barry Odom became the first Rebels head coach since John Robinson in 2000 to be named the Mountain West’s coach of the year. After taking over from Marcus Arroyo, Odom shepherded the Rebels to a 9-3 record, the team’s highest single-season win total since 1984, engineering an offense that led the conference with 35.5 points per game and a defense that tied for first with 22 total giveaways and led the way in allowing a 34.6% third-down conversion rate.\n\nAs for the all-conference teams, every program has at least one player on this year’s postseason honor roll. UNLV leads the way with six first-team selections, while three players — Wyoming’s Easton Gibbs and Colorado State’s Jack Howell and Tory Horton — each earned their second postseason first-team appearance.\n\n2023 ALL-MOUNTAIN WEST FOOTBALL FIRST TEAM\n\nOffense\n\nQB – Chevan Cordeiro, San Jose State\n\nWR – Tory Horton, Colorado State\n\nWR – Ricky White, UNLV\n\nWR – Jalen Royals, Utah State\n\nRB – Ashton Jeanty, Boise State\n\nRB – Kairee Robinson, San Jose State\n\nTE – Dallin Holker, Colorado State\n\nOL – Thor Paglialong, Air Force\n\nOL – Cade Beresford, Boise State\n\nOL – JC Davis, New Mexico\n\nOL – Tiger Shanks, UNLV\n\nOL – Frank Crum, Wyoming\n\nPK – Jose Pizano, UNLV\n\nKR – Jacob De Jesus, UNLV\n\nDefense\n\nDL – PJ Ramsey, Air Force\n\nDL – Ahmed Hassanein, Boise State\n\nDL – Mohamed Kamara, Colorado State\n\nDL – Tre Smith, San Jose State\n\nLB – Bo Richter, Air Force\n\nLB – Jackson Woodard, UNLV\n\nLB – MJ Tafisi, Utah State\n\nLB – Easton Gibbs, Wyoming\n\nDB – Trey Taylor, Air Force\n\nDB – Jack Howell, Colorado State\n\nDB – Emany Johnson, Nevada\n\nDB – Ike Larsen, Utah State\n\nP – James Ferguson-Reynolds, Boise State\n\nPR – Jacob De Jesus, UNLV\n\n2023 ALL-MOUNTAIN WEST FOOTBALL SECOND TEAM\n\nOffense\n\nQB – Jayden Maiava, UNLV\n\nWR – Steven McBride, Hawaii\n\nWR – Nick Nash, San Jose State\n\nWR – Terrell Vaughn, Utah State\n\nRB – Emmanuel Michel, Air Force\n\nRB – Jacory Croskey-Merritt, New Mexico\n\nTE – Mark Redman, San Diego State\n\nOL – Adam Karas, Air Force\n\nOL – Kage Casey, Boise State\n\nOL – Jacob Gardner, Colorado State\n\nOL – Mose Vavao, Fresno State\n\nOL – Cade Barnett, San Diego State\n\nPK – Jonah Dalmas, Boise State\n\nKR – Terrell Vaughn, Utah State\n\nDefense"
