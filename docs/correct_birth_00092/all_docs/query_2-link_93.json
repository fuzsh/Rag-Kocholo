The waterfront property features over 26 acres and a 20,000-square-foot main house with five bedrooms and eight bathrooms.\n\nBILLY JOEL LISTS NEW YORK ESTATE FOR $49 MILLION\n\n\"Just because I’m selling that house doesn’t mean I’m leaving Long Island,\" the 74-year-old told audiences Sunday night, as reported by Page Six.\n\n\"I’m just gonna spend a little more time in Florida like old Jewish guys from Long Island do,\" Joel joked.\n\nAccording to the outlet, the \"Uptown Girl\" singer acknowledged that the hefty price tag for his home is steep, adding with a laugh that \"nobody\" will want to buy the lavish manor, known as Middlesea.\n\nThe Grammy winner purchased the property in 2002 for $22.5 million.\n\nThe main house, which sits on the shores of Oyster Bay Harbor, is under renovation.
