        "text": "William Martin \"Billy\" Joel (born May 9, 1949, in the Bronx, New York) is a pianist, singer and songwriter. A six-time Grammy award winner, he is one of the best selling artists in music history.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nDon't take any shit from anybody!\n\nAfter singing \"Piano Man\" at the Madison Square Garden in New York City, (25 February 2006), also used as farewell comment to the audience after many shows.\n\nAnd in truth, of course, I'm not just 60 - I'm twelve, I'm 23, I'm 37, I'm 42, I'm 18. I'm every age I've ever been. Depending on what day of the week it is and what the situation calls for at the moment.\n\nWithout the Nazis, there wouldn't have been Billy Joel – Die Welt (10 May 2009)\n\nSong lyrics\n\n[edit]\n\nShe's got a way about her\n\nI don't know what it is.\n\nBut I know that I can't live without her.\n\nShe's got a way of pleasin'\n\nI don't know what it is\n\nBut there doesn't have to be a reason anyway.\n\nShe's Got a Way.\n\nShe comes to me when I'm feelin' down\n\nInspires me without a sound\n\nShe touches me and I get turned around.\n\nShe's Got a Way.\n\nYou can walk away from your mistakes\n\nYou can turn your back on what you do\n\nJust a little smile is all it takes\n\nAnd you can have your cake and eat it too.\n\nLoneliness will get to you somehow\n\nBut ev'rybody loves you now.\n\nEverybody Loves You Now\n\nIt's nine o' clock on a Saturday\n\nRegular crowd shuffles in\n\nThere's an old man sitting next to me\n\nMaking love to his tonic and gin.\n\nPiano Man.\n\nSing us a song you're the piano man\n\nSing us a song tonight.\n\nWell we're all in the mood for a melody\n\nAnd you've got us feeling alright.\n\nPiano Man.\n\nAnd the waitress is practicing politics\n\nAs the businessmen slowly get stoned\n\nYes they're sharing a drink they call loneliness\n\nBut it's better than drinking alone.\n\nPiano Man.\n\nIf I traveled all my life\n\nAnd I never get to stop and settle down\n\nLong as I have you by my side\n\nThere's a roof above and good walls all around\n\nYou're my castle, you're my cabin and my instant pleasure dome\n\nI need you in my house 'cause you're my home.\n\nYou're My Home.\n\nFrom a town known as Wheeling, West Virginia\n\nRode a boy with a six-gun in his hand\n\nAnd his daring life of crime made him a legend in his time\n\nEast and west of the Rio Grande.\n\nWell, he started with a bank in Colorado\n\nIn the pocket of his vest a Colt he hid.\n\nAnd his age and his size took the teller by surprise,\n\nAnd the word spread of Billy the Kid.\n\nThe Ballad of Billy the Kid.\n\nSo you play your albums and you smoke your pot\n\nAnd you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot\n\nOh, but still you're aching for the things you haven't got,\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nAnd if you can't understand why your world is so dead\n\nAnd why you've got to keep in style and feed your head\n\nWell, you're twenty one and still you mother makes your bed\n\nAnd that's too long.\n\nCaptain Jack.\n\nStreetlife serenaders\n\nHave no obligations\n\nHold no grand illusions\n\nNeed no stimulation.\n\nStreetlife Serenader.\n\nHiding up in the mountains\n\nLaying low in the canyons\n\nGoin' nowhere in the streets\n\nWith the Spanish names\n\nMakin' love with the natives\n\nIn their Hollywood places\n\nMaking up for all the time gone by\n\nLos Angelenos\n\nAll came from somewhere.\n\nLos Angelenos.\n\nI am the entertainer and I know just where I stand\n\nAnother serenader and another long haired band\n\nToday I am your champion, I may have won your hearts,\n\nBut I know the game, you'll forget my name,\n\nAnd I won't be here in another year\n\nIf I don't stay on the charts.\n\nThe Entertainer.\n\nI am the entertainer, I've come to do my show\n\nYou've heard my latest record, it's been on the radio\n\nIt took me years to write it, they were the best years of my life\n\nIt was a beautiful song but it ran too long\n\nIf you're gonna have a hit you gotta make it fit\n\nSo they cut it down to 3:05.\n\nThe Entertainer.\n\nI am the entertainer, the idol of my age\n\nI make all kinds of money when I go on the stage\n\nYou see me in the papers, I've been in the magazines\n\nBut if I go cold, I won't get sold\n\nI get put in the back in the discount rack\n\nLike another can of beans.\n\nThe Entertainer.\n\nTurnstiles (1976)\n\n[edit]\n\nSo many faces in and out of my life\n\nSome will last\n\nSome will be just now and then.\n\nLife is a series of hellos and goodbyes\n\nI'm afraid it's time for goodbye again.\n\nSay goodbye to Hollywood\n\nSay goodbye my baby\n\nSay goodbye to Hollywood\n\nSay goodbye my baby.\n\nSay Goodbye to Hollywood.\n\nNow we are forced to recognize our inhumanity\n\nOur reason coexists with our insanity\n\nAnd though we choose between reality and madness\n\nIt's either sadness or euphoria.\n\nSummer, Highland Falls.\n\nSome folks like to get away\n\nTake a holiday from the neighborhood.\n\nHop a flight to Miami Beach\n\nOr to Hollywood\n\nBut I'm talking a Greyhound\n\nOn the Hudson River Line.\n\nI'm in a New York state of mind.\n\nNew York State of Mind.\n\nIt was so easy living day by day\n\nOut of touch with the rhythm and blues\n\nBut now I need a little give and take\n\nThe New York Times, The Daily News.\n\nNew York State of Mind.\n\nThere's a place in the world for the angry young man\n\nWith his working class ties and his radical plans\n\nHe refuses to bend he refuses to crawl\n\nAnd he's always at home with his back to the wall\n\nAnd he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost\n\nAnd struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross\n\nAnd likes to be known as the angry young man.\n\nAngry Young Man.\n\nI believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage\n\nI found that just surviving was a noble fight\n\nI once believed in causes too\n\nI had my pointless point of view\n\nAnd life went on no matter who was wrong or right.\n\nAngry Young Man.\n\nSo before we end and then begin\n\nWe'll drink a toast to how it's been\n\nA few more hours to be complete\n\nA few more nights on satin sheets\n\nA few more times that I can say\n\nI've loved these days.\n\nI've Loved These Days.\n\nSeen the lights go out Broadway\n\nI saw the Empire State laid low\n\nAnd life went on beyond the Palisades\n\nThey all bought Cadillacs\n\nAnd left there long ago.\n\nMiami 2017.\n\nYou know those lights were bright on Broadway\n\nThat was so many years ago\n\nBefore we all lived here in Florida\n\nBefore the Mafia took over Mexico.\n\nThere are not many who remember\n\nThey say a handful still survive\n\nTo tell the world about\n\nThe way the lights went out\n\nAnd keep the memory alive.\n\nMiami 2017 (Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway).\n\nIt seems such a waste of time\n\nIf that's what it's all about\n\nIf that's movin' up then I'm movin' out.\n\nMovin' Out (Anthony's Song).\n\nWell, we all fall in love\n\nBut we disregard the danger\n\nThough we share so many secrets\n\nThere are some we never tell.\n\nWhy were you so surprised\n\nThat you never saw the stranger?\n\nDid you ever let your lover see\n\nThe stranger in yourself?\n\nThe Stranger.\n\nI don't want clever conversation\n\nI never want to work that hard.\n\nI just want someone\n\nthat I can talk to\n\nI want you just the way you are.\n\nI need to know that you will always be\n\nThe same old someone that I knew\n\nWhat will it take till you believe in me\n\nThe way that I believe in you.\n\nJust the Way You Are.\n\nI remember those days hanging out\n\nAt the village green\n\nEngineer boots, leather jackets\n\nAnd tight blue jeans\n\nDrop a dime in the box play the\n\nSong about New Orleans\n\nCold beer, hot lights\n\nMy sweet romantic teenage nights.\n\nScenes from an Italian Restaurant.\n\nBrenda and Eddie were the popular steadies\n\nAnd the king and the queen of the prom\n\nRiding around with the car top down and the radio on\n\nNobody looked any finer\n\nOr was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner\n\nWe never knew we could want more than that out of life\n\nSurely Brenda and Eddie would always know how to survive.\n\nScenes from an Italian Restaurant.\n\nBrenda and Eddie had had it already\n\nBy the summer of '75\n\nFrom the high to the low\n\nTo the end of the show\n\nFor the rest of their lives.\n\nThey couldn't go back to the greasers.\n\nThe best they could do was pick up the pieces.\n\nWe always knew they would both find a way to get by.\n\nThat's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie.\n\nCan't tell you more than I told you already.\n\nAnd here we are wavin' Brenda and Eddie goodbye.\n\nScenes from an Italian Restaurant.\n\nBut you know you can't always see when you're right\n\nYou got your passion you got your pride\n\nBut don't you know only fools are satisfied?\n\nDream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true\n\nWhen will you realize\n\nVienna waits for you?\n\nVienna.\n\nYou might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd\n\nWe ain't too pretty we ain't too proud\n\nWe might be laughing a bit too loud\n\nBut that never hurt no one.\n\nCome on Virginia show me a sign\n\nSend up a signal I'll throw you the line.\n\nThe stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind\n\nNever lets in the sun.\n\nAnd only the good die young.\n\nOnly the Good Die Young.\n\nThey say there's a heaven for those who will wait\n\nSome say it's better but I say it ain't.\n\nI'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints\n\nSinners are much more fun...\n\nAnd only the good die young.\n\nOnly the Good Die Young.\n\nShe can kill with a smile\n\nShe can wound with her eyes\n\nShe can ruin your faith with her casual lies\n\nAnd she only reveals what she wants you to see\n\nShe hides like a child\n\nBut she's always a woman to me.\n\nShe's Always a Woman.\n\nOh, she takes care of herself\n\nShe can wait if she wants\n\nShe's ahead of her time\n\nOh, and she never gives out\n\nAnd she never gives in\n\nShe just changes her mind.\n\nShe's Always a Woman.\n\nBecause you had to be a big shot, didn't you\n\nYou had to open up your mouth\n\nYou had to be a big shot, didn't you\n\nAll your friends were so knocked out\n\nYou had to have the last word, last night\n\nYou know what everything's about\n\nYou had to have a white hot spotlight\n\nYou had to be a big shot last night.\n\nBig Shot.\n\nHonesty is such a lonely word\n\nEveryone is so untrue\n\nHonesty is hardly ever heard\n\nAnd mostly what I need from you.\n\nHonesty.\n\nI can always find someone\n\nTo say they sympathize\n\nIf I wear my heart out on my sleeve.\n\nBut I don't want some pretty face\n\nTo tell me pretty lies.\n\nAll I want is someone to believe.\n\nHonesty.\n\nI don't need you to worry for me cause I'm alright.\n\nI don't want you to tell me it's time to come home.\n\nI don't care what you say anymore, this is my life.\n\nGo ahead with your own life and leave me alone.\n\nMy Life.\n\nI never said you had to offer me a second chance.\n\nI never said I was a victim of circumstance.\n\nI still belong, don't get me wrong.\n\nAnd you can speak your mind\n\nBut not on my time.\n\nMy Life.\n\nThey will tell you, you can't sleep alone in strange place.\n\nThen they'll tell you, you can't sleep with somebody else.\n\nAh, but sooner or later you sleep in your own space.\n\nEither way, it's okay, you wake with yourself.\n\nMy Life.\n\nNow think of all the years you tried to\n\nFind someone to satisfy you.\n\nI might be as crazy as you say.\n\nIf I'm crazy then it's true\n\nThat it's all because of you\n\nAnd you wouldn't want me any other way.\n\nYou may be right\n\nI may be crazy.\n\nBut it just may be a lunatic you're looking for.\n\nIt's too late to fight\n\nIt's too late to change me.\n\nYou may be wrong for all I know\n\nBut you may be right.\n\nYou May Be Right.\n\nIt's just a fantasy\n\nIt's not the real thing\n\nIt's just a fantasy\n\nIt's not the real thing.\n\nBut sometimes a fantasy\n\nIs all you need.\n\nSometimes a Fantasy.\n\nAll your life you had to stand in line\n\nStill you’re standing on your feet.\n\nAll your choices made you change your mind\n\nNow your calendar's complete.\n\nDon't wait for answers\n\nJust take your chances\n\nDon't ask me why.\n\nDon't Ask Me Why.\n\nYesterday you were an only child\n\nNow your ghosts have gone away.\n\nYou can kill them in the classic style.\n\nNow you, \"parlez vous francais\"\n\nDon't look for answers\n\nYou took your chances\n\nDon't ask my why.\n\nDon't Ask Me Why.\n\nWhat's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?\n\n\"Don't you know that they're out of touch?\"\n\nShould I try to be a straight 'A' student?\n\n\"If you are then you think too much.\n\nDon't you know about the new fashion honey?\n\nAll you need are looks and a whole lotta money.\"\n\nIt's the next phase, new wave , dance craze, anyways\n\nIt's still rock and roll to me.\n\nEverybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound\n\nFunny, but it's still rock and roll to me.\n\nIt's Still Rock and Roll to Me.\n\nEvery child had a pretty good shot\n\nTo get at least as far as their old man got\n\nBut something happened on the way to that place\n\nThey threw an American flag in our face.\n\nAllentown.\n\nWell I'm living here in Allentown\n\nAnd it's hard to keep a good man down\n\nBut I won't be getting up today.\n\nAllentown.\n\nYou have to learn to pace yourself.\n\nPressure.\n\nYou're just like everybody else.\n\nPressure.\n\nYou've only had to run so far,\n\nSo good.\n\nBut you will come to a place\n\nWhere the only thing you feel\n\nAre loaded guns in your face.\n\nAnd you'll have to deal with\n\nPressure.\n\nPressure.\n\nWe held the coastline\n\nThey held the highlands\n\nAnd they were sharp\n\nAs sharp as knives\n\nThey heard the hum of our motors\n\nThey counted the rotors\n\nAnd waited for us to arrive.\n\nAnd we would all go down together\n\nWe said we'd all go down together\n\nYes we would all go down together.\n\nGoodnight Saigon\n\nYou don't have to start a fight\n\nI'm a man who can't say no\n\nIf you've got a little risky business\n\nJust point me where you want to go\n\nTake me to the power\n\nTake me to the heat\n\nTake me to the cleaners\n\nIf it's open to the street\n\nSomething's got to pay off\n\nSomething's got to break\n\nSomeone's got a fortune that they're begging\n\nMe to take.\n\nEasy Money.\n\nSome people stay far away from the door\n\nIf there's a chance of it opening up\n\nThey hear a voice in the hall outside\n\nAnd hope that it just passes by.\n\nSome people live with the fear of a touch\n\nAnd the anger of having been a fool.\n\nThey will not listen to anyone\n\nSo nobody tells them a lie.\n\nAn Innocent Man.\n\nSome people hope for a miracle cure\n\nSome people just accept the world as it is.\n\nBut I'm not willing to lay down and die\n\nBecause I am an innocent man.\n\nAn Innocent Man.\n\nIf you said goodbye to me tonight\n\nThere would still be music left to write.\n\nWhat else could I do?\n\nI'm so inspired by you.\n\nThat hasn't happened for the longest time.\n\nThe Longest Time.\n\nI don't care what consequence it brings\n\nI have been a fool for lesser things.\n\nI want you so bad.\n\nI think you ought to know that\n\nI intend to hold you for\n\nThe longest time.\n\nThe Longest Time.\n\nListen boy\n\nDon't want to see you let a good thing\n\nSlip away.\n\nYou know I don't like watching\n\nAnybody make the same mistakes\n\nI made.\n\nShe's a real nice girl\n\nAnd she's always there for you.\n\nBut a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do.\n\nTell Her About It.\n\nTell her about it\n\nTell her everything you feel\n\nGive her every reason to accept\n\nThat you're for real.\n\nTell her about it.\n\nTell her all your crazy dreams.\n\nLet her know you need her\n\nLet her know how much she means.\n\nTell Her About It.\n\nTell her about it\n\nLet her know how much you care\n\nWhen she can't be with you\n\nTell her you wish you were there.\n\nTell her about it.\n\nEvery day before you leave\n\nPay her some attention\n\nGive her something to believe.\n\nTell Her About It.\n\nUptown girl\n\nShe's been living in her uptown world.\n\nI bet she never had a backstreet guy\n\nI bet her mama never told her why.\n\nI'm gonna try for an uptown girl.\n\nShe's been living in her white bread world\n\nAs long as anyone with hot blood can\n\nAnd now she's looking for a downtown man\n\nThat's what I am.\n\nUptown Girl.\n\nI know the moment isn't right\n\nTo tell the girl a comical line\n\nTo keep the conversation light\n\nI guess I'm just frightened out of my mind.\n\nBut if that's how I feel\n\nThen it's the best feeling I've ever known\n\nIt's undeniably real\n\nLeave a tender moment alone.\n\nLeave a Tender Moment Alone.\n\nLearned stickball as a formal education.\n\nLost a lot of fights\n\nBut it taught me how to lose O.K..\n\nOh, I heard about sex\n\nBut not enough.\n\nI found you could dance\n\nAnd still look tough anyway.\n\nOh yes I did.\n\nI found out a man ain't just being macho.\n\nAte an awful lot of late night drive-in food, drank a lot of take home pay.\n\nI thought I was the Duke of Earl\n\nWhen I made it with a red-haired girl\n\nIn the Chevrolet.\n\nKeeping the Faith.\n\nYou can get just so much\n\nFrom a good thing.\n\nYou can linger too long\n\nIn your dreams.\n\nSay goodbye to the\n\nOldies but goodies.\n\nYou know the good ole days weren't always good,\n\nAnd tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems.\n\nKeeping the Faith.\n\nI told you my reasons\n\nFor the whole revival.\n\nNow I'm going outside to have\n\nAn ice cold beer in the shade.\n\nOh, I'm going to listen to my 45's.\n\nAin't it wonderful to be alive\n\nWhen the rock 'n' roll plays, yeah.\n\nWhen the memory stays, yeah.\n\nI'm keeping the faith.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nKeeping the faith.\n\nKeeping the Faith.\n\nThis is the time to remember\n\n'Cause it will not last forever.\n\nThese are the days to hold on to\n\n'Cause we won't, although we'll want to.\n\nThis is the time,\n\nBut time is gonna change.\n\nYou've given me the best of you\n\nBut now I need the rest of you.\n\nThis Is the Time.\n\nSome love is just a lie of the heart\n\nThe cold remains of what began with a passionate start.\n\nAnd they may not want it to end\n\nBut it will, it's just a question of when.\n\nI've lived long enough to have learned\n\nThe closer you get to the fire the more you get burned.\n\nBut that won't happen to us\n\nBecause it's always been a matter of trust.\n\nA Matter of Trust.\n\nShe's got style and she's got her own money\n\nSo she's not another honey you can quickly disarm\n\nShe's got the eyes that make you realize\n\nShe won't be hypnotized by your usual charm.\n\nYou've got your plan of attack\n\nThat won't attract the modern woman\n\nWhen you're an old fashioned man\n\nShe understands the things you're doin'\n\nShe's a modern woman.\n\nModern Woman.\n\nLate at night\n\nWhen it's dark and cold\n\nI reach out\n\nFor someone to hold\n\nWhen I'm blue\n\nWhen I'm lonely\n\nShe comes through\n\nShe's the only one who can\n\nMy baby grand\n\nIs all I need.\n\nBaby Grand (sung with Ray Charles).\n\nThey say that no one's gonna play this on the radio\n\nThey said the melancholy blues were dead and gone\n\nBut only songs like these\n\nPlayed in minor keys\n\nKeep those memories holding on.\n\nBaby Grand.\n\nI'm so romantic\n\nI'm such a passionate man\n\nSometimes I panic\n\nWhat if nobody finds out who I am?\n\nBig Man on Mulberry Street.\n\nWe didn't start the fire\n\nIt was always burning\n\nSince the world's been turning\n\nWe didn't start the fire\n\nNo we didn't light it\n\nBut we tried to fight it.\n\nWe Didn't Start the Fire.\n\nI've got bills to pay and children who need clothes.\n\nI know there's fish out there but where God only knows.\n\nThey say these waters aren't what they used to be.\n\nBut I've got people back on land who count on me.\n\nThe Downeaster Alexa.\n\nSometimes I'm tired, sometimes I'm shot.\n\nSometimes I don't know how much more I've got.\n\nMaybe I'm headed over the hill\n\nMaybe I've set myself up for the kill.\n\nTell me how much do you think you can take\n\nUntil the heart in you is starting to break?\n\nSometimes it feels like it will.\n\nI Go to Extremes.\n\nWell I'm shameless when it comes to loving you.\n\nI'd do anything you want me to\n\nI'd do anything at all.\n\nAnd I'm standing here for all the world to see\n\nThere ain't that much left of me\n\nThat has very far to fall.\n\nShameless.\n\nAnd so my child and I came to this place\n\nTo meet him eye to eye and face to face.\n\nHe made my daughter laugh, then we embraced.\n\nWe never knew what friends we had\n\nUntil we came to Leningrad.\n\nLeningrad.\n\nBut darling there you go, slipping away into a state of grace\n\nGranted, this world is not a perfect place.\n\nStill it's the world that I'm in.\n\nHere I am talking while you don't hear a word I say.\n\nKnowing you're watching me from far away\n\nSomewhere that I've never been.\n\nState of Grace.\n\nAnd every time I've held a rose\n\nIt seems I only felt the thorns.\n\nAnd so it goes, and so it goes.\n\nAnd so will you soon I suppose.\n\nAnd So It Goes.\n\nI've seen those big machines come rolling through the quiet pines.\n\nBlue suits and bankers with their Volvos and their valentines.\n\nGive us this day our daily discount outlet merchandise.\n\nRaise up a multiplex and we will make a sacrifice.\n\nNow we're gonna get the big business.\n\nNow we're gonna get the real thing.\n\nEverybody's all excited about it.\n\nNo Man's Land.\n\nAdvice is cheap you can take it from me.\n\nIt's yours to keep 'cause opinions are free.\n\nNobody knows about the trouble I've seen.\n\nNobody's perfect, mister, nobody's clean.\n\nIt cost too much and takes too long to find out too late.\n\nSome words are not heard 'til after they're spoken.\n\nYour role was protective, your soul was too defective.\n\nSome people just don't have a heart to be broken.\n\nThe Great Wall of China.\n\nWe could have gone all the way to the Great Wall of China\n\nIf you'd only had a little more faith in me.\n\nIn lieu of diamonds, gold and platinum, reminders will still shine bright.\n\nAll the king's men and all the king's horses\n\nCan't put you together the way you used to be.\n\nWe could have been standing on the Great Wall of China.\n\nThe Great Wall of China.\n\nThese days there's a million ways\n\nTo be pulled and torn, to be misdirected.\n\nThese times there are sins and crimes\n\nOn the morning shows for the disconnected.\n\nI look and I write my book\n\nAnd I walk away with the wrong impressions.\n\nI don't care 'cause I've done my share. And I need some time for my own obsessions\n\nIt doesn't matter, I've let that life go by.\n\nIt's been forgotten 'cause all I wanted was you.\n\nBlonde Over Blue.\n\nSome days I have to give right in to the blues\n\nDespite how I try to keep fightin'.\n\nIt's a sure shot I'm going to lose.\n\nAnd I'll tell you why.\n\nYou think I'm crazy.\n\nIt's such a sad composition.\n\nBut can you blame me\n\nFor what's been causing my bad disposition?\n\nAin't nothing new with my blue situation\n\nAnd nothing's fine it's just a minor variation.\n\nA Minor Variation.\n\nSome things were perfectly clear, seen with the vision of youth.\n\nNo doubts and nothing to fear, I claimed the corner on truth.\n\nThese days it's harder to say I know what I'm fighting for.\n\nMy faith is falling away.\n\nI'm not that sure anymore.\n\nShades of grey wherever I go\n\nThe more I find out the less that I know.\n\nBlack and white is how it should be\n\nBut shades of grey are the colors I see.\n\nShades of Grey.\n\nShe waits for me at night, she waits for me in silence.\n\nShe gives me all her tenderness and takes away my pain.\n\nAnd so far she hasn't run, though I swear she's had her moments.\n\nShe still believes in miracles while others cry in vain.\n\nAll About Soul.\n\nIt's all about soul.\n\nIt's all about faith and a deeper devotion.\n\nIt's all about soul.\n\n'Cause under the love is a stronger emotion.\n\nShe's got to be strong\n\n'Cause so many things getting out of control\n\nShould drive her away.\n\nSo why does she stay?\n\nIt's all about soul.\n\nAll About Soul.\n\nGoodnight, my angel\n\nTime to close your eyes.\n\nAnd save these questions for another day.\n\nI think I know what you've been asking me.\n\nI think you know what I've been trying to say.\n\nI promised I would never leave you.\n\nAnd you should always know\n\nWherever you may go\n\nNo matter where you are\n\nI never will be far away.\n\nLullabye (Goodnight, My Angel).\n\nGoodnight, my angel\n\nNow it's time to dream.\n\nAnd dream how wonderful your life will be.\n\nSomeday your child may cry\n\nAnd if you sing this lullabye\n\nThen in your heart\n\nThere will always be a part of me.\n\nSomeday we'll all be gone.\n\nBut lullabyes go on and on...\n\nThey never die.\n\nThat's how you\n\nAnd I\n\nWill be.\n\nLullabye (Goodnight, My Angel).\n\nIn the middle of the night\n\nI go walking in my sleep\n\nThrough the valley of fear\n\nTo a river so deep.\n\nAnd I've been searching for something\n\nTaken out of my soul\n\nSomething I would never lose\n\nSomething somebody stole.\n\nThe River of Dreams.\n\nYou're having a hard time and lately you don't feel so good;\n\nYou're getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood.\n\nIt's alright, it's alright;\n\nSometimes that's what it takes.\n\nYou're only human, you're allowed to make your share of mistakes.\n\nYou're Only Human (Second Wind).\n\nDon't forget your second wind;\n\nSooner or later you'll get your second wind.\n\nIt's not always easy to be living in this world of pain.\n\nYou're gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again.\n\nIt's alright, it's alright.\n\nYou're Only Human (Second Wind).\n\nI'm young enough to still see the passionate boy I used to be.\n\nBut I'm old enough to say I got a good look at the other side.\n\nI know we got to work real hard, maybe even for the rest of our lives.\n\nBut right now I just want to take what I can\n\nGet tonight.\n\nWhile the night is still young,\n\nI want to keep making love to you,\n\nWhile the night is still young.\n\nThe Night Is Still Young.\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nBilly Joel's Official Site"
