A total flop by CBS.”\n\nWrote another, “@CBS You just might to re-schedule Billy Joel’s concert that your affiliates cut short to go to local late night news. We fans are not happy. And there are a lot of TV, etc viewing options other than you….You need to bring him back.”\n\nAnd another: “Are you kidding me? I recorded it for 3 hours because I knew it was running late. They seriously cut to the news??? That’s terrible.”\n\nBarstool Sports, which shared a clip of the truncated song, wrote, “How do you cut a Billy Joel Concert in the Middle of Piano Man?!”\n\nJournalists from some of the affected TV stations apologized to viewers on X.\n\n“As a man who grew up right next to Billy Joel’s hometown, who went to The Last Play at Shea, it was my duty to apologize to everyone about cutting off our telecast of Billy Joel tonight,” wrote Evan Closky, sports director of 10 Tampa Bay. “Not to get into the weeds, but there was a special report after the Masters and it wasn’t accounted for by the powers that be beyond this building.”\n\nSaid Rex Smith, anchor at Indiana’s WANE 15. “I apologize to the people who were enjoying Billy Joel singing on TV then all of a sudden had to see my face.”.\n\nThe concert was taped March 28 at Madison Square Garden to mark the 100th show in his long-running (and final) residency at his hometown venue.\n\nIn addition to the CBS rebroadcast, the concert special is available – in full – on Paramount+.\n\nAnd in the unlikely case you can’t recall: “…bar and put bread in my jar/And say, “Man, what are you doin’ here?”\n\nBest of Deadline\n\n2024-25 Awards Season Calendar - Dates For Oscars, Tonys, SAG Awards & More\n\n2024 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming\n\nTV Cancellations Photo Gallery: Series Ending In 2024 & Beyond"
