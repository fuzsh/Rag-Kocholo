        "text": "Background\n\nBilly Joel is an American musician and composer, who’s best known for his vocals, piano playing, and songwriting. He was born on May 9 1949 in the Bronx. He is an American legend, with over 150 million albums sold. Joel’s early life was not easy. His parents had to fight for benefits when he was born and his father went on to die in a car accident when Joel was ten years old. But that didn’t stop him from pursuing his career as a singer-songwriter, pianist, and composer. He’s an artist with a rich history.\n\nHe has released a total of 33 albums during his career. His first album was “Cold Spring Harbor,” which was released in 1971. This album didn’t have much success and it only managed to sell around 30 000 copies. The album that made him famous was “Piano Man.” It was released in 1973 and sold over 10 million copies worldwide.”We Didn’t Start the Fire” is his most recent album. It’s a collection of songs he’s written throughout the years, with Mike DelGuidice’s words and Joel’s vocals. Tony Bennett and John Legend make cameo appearances on the album.\n\nJoel has been nominated for 23 Grammy Awards and he has won six of them — three times as a member of Billy Joel & Elton John Band (1985), twice as a member of Tony Bennett’s band (2006), and once as a solo artist (1998). He won two Grammy Awards for the song ‘Just The Way You Are’ in 2010 and one for ‘Piano Man’ in 2012.\n\nIn 2019, Joel announced a concert at Camden Yards— home of the Baltimore Orioles — marking the first-ever concert at the baseball stadium. Joel was forced to postpone his concerts between March 2020 and August 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
