        "text": "UPDATE: CBS says it will re-air the entire Billy Joel concert special this Friday night, from 9-11 p.m. ET/PT.\n\n“A network programming timing error ended last night’s Billy Joel special approximately two minutes early in the Eastern and Central Time Zones. We apologize to Mr. Joel, his fans, our affiliated stations, and our audience whose viewing experience was interrupted during the last song,” the network said in a statement. “Due to the overwhelming demand from his legion of fans, BILLY JOEL: THE 100TH – LIVE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN will be rebroadcast in its entirety on CBS on April 19th at 9:00PM ET/PT.”\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nTurn the lights back on, CBS.\n\nThe network aired “The 100th: Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden” on Sunday night, letting fans see Billy Joel’s record 100th concert at MSG in New York. However, the show was delayed by CBS’ extended coverage of the Masters golf tournament, and the delay apparently led to the end of the concert getting cut off by the local news around 11:30 p.m.\n\n“Can’t believe @WTVH cut from the Billy Joel special to the news just as he was singing Piano Man! WTH @cnycentral? Who’s running that place? Must be a bunch of clowns,” one X user wrote, referring to Syracuse’s CBS affiliate, WTVH Channel 5.\n\nAccording to Awful Announcing, the broadcast abruptly cut off in the middle of Joel’s “Piano Man” on CBS stations in the Eastern and Central time zones, switching to Sunday night’s local newscasts in those markets. (Click here to see a video clip of the transition in one market.)\n\n“I apologize to the people who were enjoying Billy Joel singing on TV then all of a sudden had to see my face. I’d have picked Billy Joel over me, too,” tweeted Rex Smith, an anchor at WANE-15 in Fort Wayne, Indiana. “Also for the record, we have no idea why that happened that way. I’m sure it will be looked into.”\n\nEvan Closky, sports director at WTSP in Tampa Bay, Florida, said a special report after the Masters wasn’t accounted for “by the powers that be beyond this building.” Since Joel’s concert special — which was recorded live on March 28 — didn’t begin airing at its scheduled 9 p.m. ET start time, it didn’t finish at its expected end time of 11 p.m. (CBS also aired “60 Minutes” after The Masters, before Joel’s show.)\n\n“As a man who grew up right next to Billy Joel’s hometown, who went to The Last Play at Shea, it was my duty to apologize to everyone about cutting off our telecast of Billy Joel tonight,” Closky said on X.\n\nAccording to the Huffington Post, some outraged viewers compared the gaffe to the 1968 “Heidi” game where NBC cut away from a football game between the New York Jets and Oakland Raiders to show a children’s movie.\n\nLuckily, fans can still watch “Billy Joel: The 100th live at Madison Square Garden” in full for free online:\n\n- Watch it on cbs.com (update: As of 1 p.m. Monday, CBS website now says a Paramount+ account is required)\n\n- Stream it on demand through Paramount+ (get a 7-day free trial for Paramount+ Essential or Paramount+ with SHOWTIME)\n\n“The 100th” was Joel’s first concert to be broadcast on network television, celebrating his 100th consecutive sold-out performance at Madison Square Garden. Joel, who recently released a new song, “Turn the Lights Back On,” is expected to wrap his historic residency at MSG in July."
