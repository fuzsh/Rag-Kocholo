        "text": "Broad, earnest, and unreservedly sentimental, Billy Joel remains the quintessential showman of pop music. Born in 1949 in New York City and raised on Long Island during the postwar boom era, Joel spent his early career in Los Angeles, working briefly as the singer in a bar on Wilshire Boulevardâan experience commemorated in his signature song, âPiano Man.â He went on to become one of the most successful artists in pop, bridging reflective singer-songwriter material (1982âs The Nylon Curtain) with sock-hop nostalgia like âThe Longest Timeâ and âItâs Still Rock and Roll to Meâ for a theatrical, particularly American sound whose resonances can be heard not only in piano balladeers but in pop omnivores like Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga. In the â90s, Joel shifted his energy to touring; he sold out stadiums and arenas around the world well into the 21st century and helmed a 150-show run at New Yorkâs Madison Square Garden until the summer of 2024. Joel has an air of the everyman about him, the megastar somehow intimately in touch with the aspirations and disappointments of ordinary people. Songs like the 1977 mini-epic âScenes from an Italian Restaurantâ and 1976âs ruminative âSay Goodbye to Hollywoodâ paired anthemic choruses with a wistfulness about lost pasts; biting tracks like 1978âs socialite satire âBig Shotâ and 1971âs scathing âEverybody Loves You Nowâ put his New York-honed attitude on display; and cuts like the muscular âA Matter of Trustâ and the loping âSheâs Always a Womanâ show off his romantic side. His combination of sincerity and musical chopsâleavened by a withering humorâhave made his catalog a pop touchstone."
