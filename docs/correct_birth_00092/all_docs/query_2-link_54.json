        "text": "Update: A new version of Live At Yankee Stadium, both the video (DVD) and audio (CD), was announced in August 2022 and set for release in November 2022. The new DVD has the same songs as the prior one, with the addition of \"Uptown Girl.\" However, the video and audio quality have been greatly improved, and the video has been re-edited to make it less \"jumpy\" like the original one from 1990. The concert film will be shown at theaters on October 5 and 9, 2022. See link. As to audio (CD), this is a two disc set with 22 songs. There was no prior official CD of the concerts, except for the five-song CD that was part of the Australian package.\n\nIn June 22 and 23, 1990, Billy Joel and his band played two sold-out concerts at New York's famous Yankee Stadium. It was the perfect marriage of performer and venue. The concerts were recorded and broadcast as a single concert on The Disney Channel and then later released as a single-concert video/DVD. The video was directed by Billy's longtime friend and former band mate, Jon Small, who had become a highly regarded producer and director in the music and concert video industry. The concert DVD was 85 minutes and featured twelve songs.\n\nA mini-version was released on CD (audio only) in Australia as part of the special Australian boxed set Souvenir: The Ultimate Collection and featured five songs: \"Shout\" (composed by the Isley Brothers), \"Storm Front,\" \"New York State of Mind,\" \"I Go to Extremes,\" and the quintessential closing song \"Piano Man.\"\n\nBarnes & Noble's online store describes the DVD as follows:\n\n\"For all his international success, Billy Joel still tends to be identified as a Long Island singer-songwriter, in much the same way Bruce Springsteen is identified with the Garden State. Joel even began his career with an album entitled Cold Spring Harbor, after a peaceful hamlet on L.I.'s north shore, near his widely reported birthplace, Hicksville. Yet in Billy Joel Live at Yankee Stadium, put together from two sold-out 1990 performances at The House That Ruth Built, the multi-platinum superstar says the concerts represented a homecoming to his birthplace, the Bronx. We'll take Joel at his word on the Bronx-born claim. (Since his considerable gifts for songsmithing clearly draw on the rich doo-wop traditions of the Bronx in the 1950s, one could argue that his music was born there.)\n\n\"So it's easy to get into the spirit of the production, which starts with Joel arriving along with his fans on the subway and entering the stadium gates alongside the appreciative hordes. Once on stage with his band and touring accompanists, though, he's The Entertainer, swinging for the fences with spectacular lights and thundering orchestration. Opening with \"Storm Front,\" Joel barrels through high-energy hit after hit, pounding the keys through such favorites as \"I Go to Extremes\" and \"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\" before switching from piano to tempered accordion on \"Downeaster 'Alexa.'\" He straps on a guitar for \"We Didn't Start the Fire,\" covers the Isley Brothers' classic \"Shout,\" and delivers the anthem \"A Matter of Trust\" with appropriate vigor.\n\n\"The 13-song set closes with \"Piano Man,\" a cozy classic closely identified with his Long Island lounge roots, and somehow before 40,000 or so fans in baseball's most storied stadium, Joel manages homey intimacy. You'd think he was born there.\"\n\nBarnes & Noble's online store describes the DVD as follows:\n\n\"For all his international success, Billy Joel still tends to be identified as a Long Island singer-songwriter, in much the same way Bruce Springsteen is identified with the Garden State.
