        "text": "Billy Joel is a practical, earthy mover and doer. His personality doesn’t have room for idealism or mirages. When everything is ready, his inner strength and stamina will take him straight to the heart of the material world with no detours or mistakes. He then becomes the quintessential creator and producer. He creates out of love for the phenomenon of creation on every level. Although his innate sense of matter, his earthiness, may sometimes confine him to the material plane, it also endows him with the power to give substance to his intuitions. His material possessions embody his spirit. He is a person of conviction. He believes in his action; he has faith in his approach. Striding purposefully ahead, he goes even farther, more effectively. He is aware he has a job to carry out; he knows his duty is to create and construct. As a result, it is important for him to be deeply implicated in his career and to feel as though he is really accomplishing a goal that is important to him. He is coherent and pragmatic, and his life and mind are carefully organized. Improvisation is not his forte; on the contrary, he tends to plan out his work in advance, stick to the plan obstinately, and pace himself carefully. This tendency may strike others as being somewhat plodding and slow. But the opinion of others means little to him; he judges himself on the basis of the fruit of his labor. His accomplishments arouse his pride and possessiveness, since he views them as evidence of his worth. However, the work ethic so prevalent in our society is deeply ingrained in him. Merely by slogging on with his duty, he achieves such personal rewards and satisfactions as the knowledge that his potency never flickers; his inner virility and ability to follow through are steady, sure, and irresistible. The only drawback is that his earthiness and stubbornness may confine his interests to somewhat low horizons. His capacity for work is related to a capacity for self-devotion. He is able to give his entire being to a great cause, to devote himself body and soul, with all the might and conscientiousness he possesses, if he believes the goal to be his ultimate purpose. His initial problem is to find the cause he will make his purpose in life, because if he were to err, if he wandered into the trap of a bad cause fraught with risk, he would suffer a terrible setback. Therefore, the essential value which will define his\n\nBilly Joel, due to the influence of Leo rising, seems to have a high ideal of himself. He is simultaneously dazzling yet rebellious, extremist yet sensitive and good-natured. His behavior is ambivalent, and he blows hot and cold: emotional intensity alternates with cold impersonality. The truth is, he is aware of a deep feeling of inner disharmony which causes him to counteract his primary instincts and inhibit the free interplay of his emotional impulses and deep-seated urges. As a result, he refuses to engage in a narcissistic quest for the admiration of others as a means of confirming his own self-worth. Scorning such crude and primitive forms of self-enhancement, he seeks purpose in life by looking inside himself, examining and analyzing the emotional, mental, and spiritual components that make him tick. The only true source of self-esteem will be his objective creations and accomplishments. His psychology should undergo a complete metamorphosis in midlife (at the age of 40-45 years).\n\nBilly Joel is sensual. Pleasure is important to him.\n\nBilly Joel needed others to fulfill himself and accomplish his ambitions.\n\nBilly Joel was born under the sign of Leo (the Lion), during the time of the sun’s passage through the sign of Taurus (the Bull). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide his personality profile. The following key words capture the essence of his character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension: Determination – Pride and self-assurance – Compassion – Superiority – Perseverance – Brilliance – Pragmatism – Generosity – Productivity – Positivism – Sensuality. With his steadfast, wholesome personality, honest and determined, Billy Joel dislikes evasiveness and subterfuge in others. He is not happy with anything less than excellence and will actively seek out social success, power, and material comfort. He has a tendency to invest in his key interests and personal preferences, and he knows how to be generous. His great sensuality makes him appreciate pleasure as much as duty, with the same optimism and delight.\n\nBorn in the three and one-half days before the full moon rose, Billy Joel has a personality which is said to be complex and rich. He is often troubled by the feeling that he is struggling to do something great, but this could be due to his dedication to a spiritual or humanitarian cause. If he fails to find a great and noble cause to which he pledges himself, he could always make do with a person who attracts him. Whatever he decides, it is by working to serve others that he will approach his own self-transformation.\n\nThis relationship could yield a high degree of psychological compatibility and powerful mutual attraction. The physical and psychological reality of Billy Joel’s personality will exert a magnetic pull over the sensitivity, receptivity, tenderness, and other key qualities of your partner.\n\nBilly Joel’s moon is located at 9° LIBRA. His ideal match is a partner with the sun at 3/15° LIBRA or ARIES.\n\nBilly Joel would be perfectly matched with someone who shares his underlying psychic and unconscious aspirations. The secret ideal you cherish of the perfect partner would be aroused; it would harmonize beautifully with his ideal imaginary lover. This great psychic compatibility is the result of a harmonious relationship between the Moon of the masculine chart and the sun of the feminine one. It is propitious to a rich flow of energies between the most hidden and secret parts of both people. They are linked by an unconscious emotional bond.\n\nBilly Joel’s Venus is located at 24° TAURUS. His ideal match is a partner with Mars at 18/30° TAURUS or SCORPIO.\n\nBilly Joel would be a perfect partner for someone with emotional and sentimental needs. This person would reflect your ideal of sensuality, fulfilling your deepest desires. Additionally, your ideal partner would resonate with your own psychic projections of your ideal. This positive relationship between the unconscious sexual desires of both partners would be likely to yield sensual relations of a tantalizingly mysterious and secret nature.\n\nBilly Joel is attracted to the sensual individuals that he meets. His feelings for them are slow to coalesce, but once they do, they are deep and enduring. He would be especially attracted to this type of sensual individual, who is willing to play at submissiveness. They would share the same approach to life’s pleasures. This person would also share Billy Joel’s taste for comfort and luxury.\n\nBilly Joel’s ideal match is a partner with Venus at 1/13° TAURUS or SCORPIO."
