        "text": "'It's Still Rock and Roll to Me'\n\nBilly Joel - It's Still Rock and Roll to Me (Official Video)\n\nTaken from his 1980 Glass Houses album, this song is a cynical take at the music industry at the time.\n\nBilly Joel facts: Singer's age, wife, children, net worth and more revealed\n\nBilly sings about a manager begging an artist to stay 'hip' for the younger crowd, but the character refuses to change, as his music will stay relevant despite his appearance.\n\nThe song was written in response to various music genres in the late 1970s (such as punk, funk, and new wave). It was inspired by Joel after reading a review about an unnamed band, and realising that he had no idea what their music sounded like.\n\n'Tell Her About It'\n\nBilly Joel - Tell Her About It (Official Video)\n\nRead more: The incredible way Billy Joel looks after his loyal fans better than any other artist\n\nFrom from his album An Innocent Man, this was inspired by Billy's musical influences from the 1950s and 1960s. It is soulful advice to a young man who is in love, urging him to communicate his feelings and dreams to his partner.\n\nThe song reached the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in September 1983, becoming Joel’s second chart-topper.\n\n'Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)'\n\nBilly Joel - Movin' Out (Anthony's Song) (from Old Grey Whistle Test)\n\nThis song describes Billy's annoyance with the aspirations of working and lower-middle-class New Yorkers who take pride in working long hours to afford the appearance signs of having \"made it\".\n\nIn 2002, a stage musical based on the song and other Billy Joel tracks opened in New York and played over 1,000 performances before closing three years later.\n\n'The Longest Time'\n\nBilly Joel - The Longest Time (Official Video)\n\nFrom the 1983 album An Innocent Man, this track follows the theme of the album in paying tribute to Joel's influences, and is sung in the style of Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers.\n\nIt only reached number 25 in the UK, but it has gone on to become one of Billy Joel's most popular songs.\n\n'Goodnight Saigon'\n\nBilly Joel - Goodnight Saigon (Official Video)\n\nBilly Joel wrote this song after talking to some friends who fought in the Vietnam War.\n\nHaving not fought in the war himself, rather than pursuing an anti-war song he chose to talk about the experience of soldiers.\n\n\"A lot of my friends did go,\" he said. \"I felt bad. I disagreed with the political reasons for that war.\" A few years after his friends came back home, they told him their war stories and encouraged him to write a song.\n\n\"They said, 'We'll tell you what happened to us and you write a song about it,'\" he recalled. \"I realised you don't have to have lived it as long as you researched it and talked to people that were there.\"\n\n'New York State of Mind'\n\nBilly Joel - New York State of Mind (Audio)\n\nWhile Billy Joel is one of the most famous Long Islanders of all time, in the mid-1970s he spent three years in Los Angeles.\n\nRead more: Billy Joel plays piano with blind teenage piano prodigy in heartwarming video\n\nHowever, he never truly felt at home while living on the West Coast. He wrote this song on a bus back to New York, as he was travelling along the Hudson River line, and it later became an unofficial anthem for the city.\n\nThe song was famously performed at The Concert For New York City in October 2001 as part of a benefit for the New York City Fire and Police Departments and the loved ones of families lost during the 9/11 attacks.\n\n'Only the Good Die Young'\n\nBilly Joel - Only The Good Die Young\n\n\"Come out, Virginia, don't let me wait/ You Catholic girls start much too late.\" That is quite the opening line.\n\nUnsurprisingly, some radio stations banned the song back in 1977. However, the controversy around the song only helped sell more copies.\n\nThe song was inspired by Billy's real-life crush on a Catholic girl named Virginia.\n\n'Scenes from an Italian Restaurant'\n\nScenes From An Italian Restaurant-Billy Joel (lyrics)\n\nEven though this is one of Billy's longest and most beloved songs, it was never released as a single.\n\nRead more: Billy Joel plays discarded piano on New York street and asks why it's being thrown away - video\n\nThe song tells the tale of high school sweethearts Brenda and Eddie, a relatable couple who couldn’t survive the pressure of the real world.\n\nFor years, his fans wondered which exact Italian restaurant he was singing about, and he eventually revealed it as Fontana di Trevi in New York.\n\n'My Life'\n\nBilly Joel - My Life (Official Video)\n\nThis song first appeared on Billy's classic 1978 album 52nd Street, and reached number 3 in the US and 12 in the UK.\n\nFun fact: Chicago members Peter Cetera and Donnie Dacus performed the backing vocals on the song, and sang along with Billy during the bridge (\"Keep it to yourself, it's my life\").\n\n'A Matter of Trust'\n\nBilly Joel - A Matter of Trust (Official Video)\n\nThis song featured on Billy's 1986 album The Bridge. It achieved particular attention in the Soviet Union at the time, as part of a state-sponsored TV promotion of Joel's songs ahead of his 1987 USSR concerts.\n\nIn the music video, his then-wife Christie Brinkley appears while holding their baby daughter, Alexa.\n\n'She's Always a Woman'\n\nBilly Joel - She's Always a Woman -\n\nThis is a love song about a so-called 'modern woman', or more specifically Billy Joel's then-wife, Elizabeth Weber.\n\nRead more: Billy Joel celebrates 70th birthday as daughters Alexa, 33, and Della Rose, 3, sing to him - video\n\nIn the song, the man falls in love with the woman for her quirks as well as her flaws. At the time, Elizabeth had taken over management of Billy's career, and put his financial affairs in order after he had signed some bad contracts.\n\nShe proved to be a tough negotiator who could \"wound with her eyes\" or \"steal like a thief\", but would \"never give in\". While her tough-as-nails negotiating style was thought of as \"unfeminine\" in the eyes of many businessmen at the time, to Billy Joel, she was always a woman.\n\n'We Didn't Start the Fire'\n\nBilly Joel - We Didn't Start the Fire (Official Video)\n\nQUIZ: How well do you know the lyrics to 'We Didn't Start the Fire'?\n\nOne of the best history lessons in pop history?\n\nThe lyrics for this US number one hit feature rapid-fire references to over 100 headlines between 1949, the year of Joel's birth, and 1989, the year of release.\n\nThe song was a surprise hit, though Billy himself has said he doesn’t rate the song due to its lack of strong melody. Apparently.\n\n'Uptown Girl'\n\nBilly Joel - Uptown Girl (Official Video)\n\nSpeaking to Howard Stern, Billy had originally titled the song 'Uptown Girls' and it was written after he was surrounded by Christie Brinkley, Whitney Houston and his then-girlfriend Elle Macpherson.\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'Uptown Girl'\n\nIt ended up being about his soon-to-be wife, Brinkley, and was inspired by the music of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.\n\nThe song was a huge hit, and gave Billy his only UK number one in 1983.\n\n'Piano Man'\n\nBilly Joel - Piano Man (Video)\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'Piano Man'\n\nThis was Billy Joel’s first single and it's still his greatest.\n\nIt has since become Billy Joel’s signature song, and is based on his time playing piano at the Executive Room bar in Los Angeles, and all the familiar faces he saw there, except he was calling himself Bill Martin at the time."
