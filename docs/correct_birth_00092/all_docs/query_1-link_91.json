        "text": "Born to the name of William Martin Joel (nicknamed Billy by his parents and friends), Billy Joel is a highly esteemed composer, singer, entertainer, pianist, and songwriter. He was born on May 9, 1949 in The Bronx, New York. Piano Man was his first song to be ever graced in the Billboard Chart back in 1973, creating an instant stir in the music industry. Since then, he has become one of the most sought after music artists that many people talk and rave about until now.\n\nBilly Joel started early, way back in high school when he used to play with other professional musicians in late night bars. However, this lifestyle led him to miss one important final exam in school and this was the reason why he was not able to get his high school diploma. He was not disappointed about it at all. In fact, he boldly stated that if he couldn’t go to Columbia University, then he would go straight to Columbia Records since the company did not need a diploma to get accepted. And that was exactly what he did and was labeled under the said music mogul. It was only 25 years later when Billy Joel submitted his essay and finally got his high school diploma.\n\nHe then went on to a series of successful performances, concerts, and albums in the 70’s, 80’s, and 90’s. His self-written songs, particularly 33 of those, became included in the top 40 Billboard Hits in the United States. He also won 6 Grammy awards, nominated 23 times, and has sold over a hundred million records all over the globe."
