        "text": "We take a look at the life and career of a backstreet guy...\n\nBilly Joel, the singer behind hits like 'Piano Man', 'We Didn't Start The Fire' and 'Uptown Girl', will perform in the UK for just one show in 2024. This year he also performed his songs 'Turn the Lights Back On', and 'You May Be Right' at the Grammys. So, we've taken a look back at Billy's life and career, and answered some burning questions about Billy Joel.\n\nNew York City‚Äôs very own piano man, Billy Joel, blended rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll with a Broadway sensibility to create a whole new language for pop music, while becoming something of a superstar. The singer, whose music spans genres and decades, has some of the catchiest tunes going. Get to know the singer and musician right here!\n\nWho is Billy Joel?\n\nBorn in the Bronx in New York on 9th May 1949 and raised in Hicksville in Long Island, Billy Joel is a five-time Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter. He has sold more than 150 million records worldwide.\n\nWas Billy Joel a boxer?\n\nBilly very nearly became a boxer and fought 22 bouts as a welterweight. That all came to an end when he clapped eyes on The Beatles as part of the 73 million Americans who watched their celebrated appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964.\n\nHow did Billy Joel get famous?\n\nJoining British Invasion covers band The Echoes, Billy Joel also played piano on a number of recording sessions, including one for the Shangri-La‚Äôs ‚ÄòLeader Of The Pack‚Äô.\n\nBilly Joel moved to LA in 1972 where he played piano for six months at The Executive Room club under the name Bill Martin. The following year, he attracted the attention of a number of record labels after a live recording of his song, ‚ÄòCaptain Jack‚Äô, was broadcast by radio station WMMR in Philadelphia.\n\nSigning to Columbia Records, he released the album, ‚ÄòPiano Man‚Äô, in 1973 and the title song, based on his experiences as a lounge player, became his signature tune.\n\nSupporting acts such as J. Geils Band and the Doobie Brothers, Joel released the albums ‚ÄòStreetlife Serenade‚Äô and ‚ÄòTurnstiles‚Äô. Though he was making some in-roads into the US charts, he was still an unknown quantity in the UK.\n\nAll that was to change with the 1977 album, ‚ÄòThe Stranger‚Äô, containing the hit ‚ÄòJust The Way You Are‚Äô, Billy Joel cracked the UK Top 20. The album went silver in the UK and the following year, Joel released his next album, ‚Äò52nd Street‚Äô.\n\nWATCH: Billy Joel - 'Just the Way You Are' (Live 1977)\n\nHas Billy Joel ever won a Grammy Award?\n\nBilly has won six Grammys in total, but he's been nominated for 23! The single, ‚ÄòMy Life‚Äô, gave him his biggest UK hit to date when it peaked at Number 12, while the album scooped the award for Album of the Year at the 1979 Grammy Awards.\n\nIn 2024, the singer also performed at the Grammys.\n\nBilly Joel: 80s success\n\nResponding to criticism that his piano-led material marked him down as a mere balladeer working in the realm of soft rock, Billy Joel‚Äôs next album, 1980‚Äôs ‚ÄòGlass Houses‚Äô, found him moving into a slightly harder-edged sound.\n\nIn truth, he was still coming from the same place that he always had. Going all the way to the top in the US singles charts and Number 12 here in the UK, the single ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Still Rock And Roll To Me‚Äô was Joel‚Äôs riposte to the changing times with the point of view that good pop music will always break through regardless of what‚Äôs fashionable. In any case, he took home a Grammy Award for the Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male in 1980.\n\nFollowing the relative commercial failure of 1982‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Nylon Curtain‚Äô, Billy Joel scored big with his next album, the international success story that was 1983‚Äôs ‚ÄòAn Innocent Man‚Äô. Going back to the various musical styles of his youth that included doo-wop, soul and R‚Äôn‚ÄôB, Joel scored a run of hit singles on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe album‚Äôs best-known track is the Number 1 single, ‚ÄòUptown Girl‚Äô. The famous promo video featured Billy Joel as a grease monkey working in a gas station and supermodel Christie Brinkley as a high society girl. The end of the video sees the pair riding off together on a motorcycle. The album‚Äôs other hits included ‚ÄòAn Innocent Man‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Longest Time‚Äô.\n\nWATCH: Billy Joel - 'Uptown Girl' (Official Video)\n\nFrom here on in, Billy Joel became less of a fixture on the UK charts. His last two UK Top 10 hits were the historically fuelled ‚ÄòWe Didn‚Äôt Start The Fire‚Äô (Number 7) in 1989 and 1993‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe River Of Dreams‚Äô (Number 3). Since then, he‚Äôs only released one album, the classical ‚ÄòFantasies & Delusions‚Äô in 2001.\n\nWATCH: Billy Joel - 'We Didn‚Äôt Start The Fire'\n\nBilly Joel: Live At Yankee Stadium\n\nCelebrating five decades of Billy Joel, fans had the chance to see Billy Joel: Live At Yankee Stadium in cinemas across the country in October 2022.\n\nNow, fans can download the film to watch, or rent it digitally from Billy's website. Originally shot back in 1990 on 16mm colour film, the movie shows Billy's fantastic performances on two dates at Yankee Stadium.\n\nWhen is Billy Joel on tour?\n\nBilly has announced just one European date for 2024. The singer will be performing in Cardiff on Friday 9th August 2024, and tickets are on sale now.\n\nBilly's gig in Cardiff will be first time he has performed in the city, and fans can expect to see him performing many of his hit songs such as 'It‚Äôs Still Rock and Roll To Me', 'Tell Her About It' and 'We Didn‚Äôt Start The Fire'.\n\nIs Billy Joel married?\n\nBilly Joel has been married four times. His first wife, Elizabeth Weber Small, was his manager. They married in 1973 and divorced nine years later.\n\nHis most famous marriage was to supermodel Christie Brinkley. The couple married in 1985 and had one daughter, Alexa Ray Joel. They divorced in 1994.\n\nHe married his third wife, Katie Lee in 2004 and they separated in 2009.\n\nBilly Joel‚Äôs fourth wife is Alexis Roderick. They married in 2015 and have two daughters, Della Rose Joel and Remy Anne Joel.\n\nSee your favourite artists then and now:\n\nYou can hear Billy Joel on the Greatest Hits Radio playlist.\n\nRead more:\n\nBon Jovi through the years: How the rock band have changed over time\n\nBruce Springsteen: From 'Born to Run' to Broadway üé∏\n\nElton John: The man who gave us 'Sacrifice' and 'Your Song'\n\nHow to listen to Greatest Hits Radio:\n\nListen to Greatest Hits Radio on the free Rayo app, online or on your DAB digital radio.
