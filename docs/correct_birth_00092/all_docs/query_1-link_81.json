        "meta_description": "Billy Joel - The Piano Man \nChildhood &amp; Early Inspiration William Martin Joel was born in the Bronx on May 9, 1949. His father Howard was an accomplished classically trained pianist, while his mother Rosalind was an admirer of pop music stars. Introduced to the piano at age 4, young Billy took quickly to his father's intense classical training regimen while also soaking in his mother’s pop tastes from stars like Ray Charles and The Beatles. \nBilly's parents split when he was just shy of his teen years, profoundly impacting the shy boy. He channeled feelings of sadness and anger into piano playing. By age 16, his musical tastes had evolved into blues, soul and rock, with masters like Paul McCartney and John Lennon as heroes. In supporting himself, Joel took up boxing for a short period under the name Billy Martin. He continued nurturing his piano skills by performing at local events and bars. \nEarly Career &amp; Struggles Quitting high school to pursue a career in music full-time, Joel joined various pop groups through the mid-1960s. In 1970 at just 20 years old, he signed his first solo record deal with Family Productions, releasing his debut Cold Spring Harbor the next year. \nThe terms of the Family Productions deal swindled Joel out of royalties, as the album was mastered incorrectly to play at too high a speed. Devastated and embarrassed by the results, Joel fled to Los Angeles where he began playing piano bars under the pseudonym Bill Martin to make ends meet. After 6 months out west, Joel returned to New York with a newfound appreciation for songwriting craftsmanship while performing live. \nBreakthrough Success Joel's fortunes changed in 1972 when Columbia Records signed him after seeing a local club performance. His 1973 album Piano Man, captured Joel’s tales of struggle and characters encountered during his Los Angeles piano bar stint. The heartfelt title track became his first major hit single, earning Joel national television appearances and widespread fame at last. \nOver his next albums Streetlife Serenade and Turnstiles, Joel honed his fusion of pop, rock, blues and Tin Pan Alley into a signature sound while continuing to draw influence from his personal life. Songs like \"The Entertainer\" and \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" cemented his reputation as an insightful chronicler of the triumphs and pitfalls chasing artistic dreams. Superstardom Joel’s 1977 album The Stranger launched him into iconic stardom on the wings of hits “Just the Way You Are,” “Movin’ Out” and “Only the Good Die Young.” It garnered him the first two of six career Grammy awards. He quickly followed up with 52nd Street in 1978, containing chart-toppers “My Life,” “Big Shot,” and “Honesty.” \nBy the end of the decade, Joel ranked as one of the highest-selling music artists in America. He captivated audiences with marathon concerts showcasing his impeccable piano playing and voice. Joel also began collaborating with other superstars like Paul McCartney as his prestige soared. \n1980s Peak The 1980s saw Joel unleash some of popular music’s most ubiquitous songs, catapulting him to widespread fame beyond just rock circles. His fusion of classical compositional styles with pop melodicism hit new highs with the release of Glass Houses in 1980. Upbeat rockers like “You May Be Right” and “It’s Still Rock and Roll to Me” became anthems that connected strongly with youth. \nLater songs explored deeper themes, with the ballad “Just the Way You Are” earning Joel his first two Grammy awards in 1979. The Nylon Curtain album tackled pressing social issues like Vietnam veterans’ struggles and American factories shuttering. Chart smash “Uptown Girl” off the follow-up An Innocent Man album became emblematic of Joel's revival of pop standards styles. \nJoel's concert appeal also swelled enormously during the 1980s prime. Backed by his reliable band, shows stretched over 3 hours nightly, treating crowds to electric performances of hits alongside album cuts and improvised jams. His month-long residency touring the Soviet Union in 1987 also made history as the first American rock act ever to perform there, helping thaw Cold War tensions through music. \n1990s – Present Legacy While the 1990s saw Joel release his final pop album River of Dreams, the decade kicked off with his highest honor - induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. He became one of the youngest solo artists ever enlisted, affirming his body of work's stature and influence. In 2013, Joel received Kennedy Center Honors for enriching American culture through music. \nThough no longer recording new albums, Joel continues performing sold-out shows annually at New York’s Madison Square Garden, celebrating his decades of hits. In 2014, he played his record-setting 65th consecutive MSG monthly gig, outdoing even The Grateful Dead’s previous house act record there. \nNow over 50 years into his illustrious career, Billy Joel’s catalog stands among popular music’s most treasured. His piano-driven story songs resonate by blending classical techniques with pop themes about chasing dreams. Now nearing 75 years old, Joel sustains a devotion to songwriting excellence and powerhouse live performing - making him both one of rock’s finest showmen and craftsmen.
