        "text": "Sarah Cassi | For lehighvalleylive.com\n\nThe \"Piano Man\" himself, Billy Joel, is performing July 9, 2016, at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia.\n\nJoel has already performed \"Allentown\" on previous tour stops, so chances are it's going to be on the set list.\n\nCheck out our list of stories about what led to a song about the Queen City.\n\n'Well we're living here in Allentown'\n\nBilly Joel grew up on Long Island and originally wrote the song as \"Levittown,\" which was near Joel's hometown of Hicksville, New York.\n\nIn an interview with James Lipton on \"Inside the Actors Studio,\" Joel compared Allentown's troubles in the late 1970s and early 1980s with what he saw growing up in Hicksville.\n\nWhen the song was released in 1982, it was criticized for referencing coal and steel mills in the Queen City when there were none. They were in neighboring Bethlehem.\n\nWe're living here in Levittown\n\nJoel released four albums before his first Billboard top 10 hit -- \"Just the Way You Are\" from \"The Stranger.\"A later album, \"The Nylon Curtain,\" featured the song \"Allentown.\"\n\nBut before he hit it big, Joel was already known in the Lehigh Valley and repeatedly toured the area.\n\nStops included a $2-per-ticket show in November 1973 at The Roxy in Northampton borough, as well as concerts at Agricultural Hall in Allentown, Memorial Hall at Muhlenberg College and Lehigh University.\n\nJohn Munson | The Star-Ledger\n\nNo 'Stranger' to the Lehigh Valley\n\nJoel reportedly worked on the song for years.\n\nIn 1981, before he planned to record \"The Nylon Curtain\", Joel came to the Lehigh Valley and stayed at The Hotel Bethlehem.\n\nWhile Bethlehem Steel is what influenced the song, Joel has said he thought \"Allentown\" sounded better and was easier to rhyme.\n\n\"Allentown is a metaphor for America,\" Joel told \"People\" magazine in 1983. \"It sounds like Jimmytown, Bobbyburgh, Anytown. It just sounds real American. It's a symbol of a town that's having financial difficulties.\"\n\nHotel Bethlehem\n\nThe Hotel Bethlehem on Main Street in Bethlehem. File lehighvalleylive.com photo.\n\nLibrary of Congress Photo\n\nQuitting time whistle\n\nThe whistle recording at the beginning of the song was a matter of location.\n\nProducer Phil Ramone and engineer Jim Boyer listened to stock sound effects of steam whistles, but ended up recording a steam shovel working on a construction site near the recording studio, Ramone said in \"Making Records: The Scenes Behind the Music.\"\n\nFor more \"industrial\" sound effects in the song, they shook up a box of percussion instruments that had cowbells, maracas, etc, according to \"Making Records.\" Afterward, when they opened the box, the instruments were \"smashed to bits.\"\n\nVideo killed the radio star\n\nRussell Mulcahy directed the music video for \"Allentown.\"\n\nMulcahy had already directed the first music video played on MTV -- The Buggles' \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" -- as well as several Duran Duran music videos.\n\nIn 2014, Mulcahy told Billboard magazine that Billy Joel wasn't comfortable acting in music videos and wanted to be doing something familiar. Mulcahy's idea was to have Joel be a troubadour in the video, telling the song's story while the cast acted around him.\n\n.\n\nLet's get down, let's all go to Allentown\n\nRobert Pearce, a retired Allen Organ employee, and his daughter Joanne Pearce Martin, a pianist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, wrote the song \"We Love Allentown\" as a rebuttal to Joel's hit. \"We Love Allentown\" has been performed in the city over the years.\n\nIn 2012, the city asked residents to submit new lyrics for \"Allentown\" as part of the 250th Celebration.\n\nSarah Cassi | For lehighvalleylive.com\n\nKey to the city\n\nWhen the song came out, Allentown's then-Mayor Joseph Daddona went on the offensive.\n\nDaddona wrote a letter to Joel inviting him to do a concert in Allentown, and asking Joel to donate a portion of his royalties toward scholarships for city students.\n\nIn 1982, when Joel performed at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Daddona gave him the key to Allentown before the concert.\n\nAfter all the furor over the song, Joel performed for 6,300 people at Lehigh University's Stabler Arena on Dec. 27, 1982.\n\nThe third and final encore of the night was \"Allentown\" and Joel ended the concert by saying \"Don't take any s*** from anybody.\"\n\nThe song is still a part of Joel's tour repertoire. In the video, he's performing it July 2, 2016 at PNC Park in Pittsburgh.\n\nPerforming in Bethlehem\n\nGarth Brooks performed a part of \"Allentown\" in 2013 when Joel was part of the Kennedy Center Honors class that year.\n\nThe following year, John Mellencamp performed an acoustic version of the song when Joel received the Library of Congress' Gershwin Prize for Popular Song."
