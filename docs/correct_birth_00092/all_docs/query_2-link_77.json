        "text": "Mr. New York is movin’ out of his beloved Long Island home of over 20 years.\n\nIn the village of Centre Island, roughly 40 miles east of Midtown Manhattan, Billy Joel’s 26-acre estate has hit the market for $49 million.\n\nSources tell The Post that Joel had been renovating the residence — on Long Island’s prime North Shore — for the last few years with the intention to sell.\n\nThe Piano Man purchased the spread in 2002 for $22.5 million, according to records.\n\nInitially, the Grammy winner had only purchased 14 acres, later buying up several adjacent parcels of land.\n\nThe residential compound being offered is twice as much acreage and residential space as the original parcel Joel purchased 23 years ago.\n\nKnown as Middlesea, the estate is close to Joel’s hometown of Hicksville, a hamlet also located in the town of Oyster Bay.\n\nInterior photos shown are from Joel’s beach house and the gatehouse, not the main house, which is currently under renovation.\n\nPegged as an “extraordinary one-of-a-kind waterfront estate,” the home features 2,000 feet of waterfront footage.\n\nThe main house includes more than 20,000 square feet, and is made up of five bedrooms and eight baths.\n\nIt is currently under renovation with an elevator that services all floors, the listing notes.\n\nThere is an additional three-bedroom beach house, a pool, a helicopter pad, a floating dock and a boat ramp.\n\nMoreover, there is a three-bedroom guest apartment, a bowling alley and an indoor pool.\n\nBonnie Williamson of Daniel Gale Sotheby’s International Realty holds the listing.\n\nMeanwhile, Joel, 74, will be spending the majority of his time in Florida.\n\nIn 2015, he shelled out $22 million for a home in Manalapan, which is also on sale — for $64.9 million.\n\nJoel first listed the Florida home, south of Palm Beach, in 2018 for $31.9 million.\n\nIt then resurfaced back on the market in November 2022. It’s expected that Joel is eyeing property elsewhere in the area.\n\nChristian J. Angle with Christian Angle Real Estate holds that listing.\n\nHe isn’t however abandoning Long Island. Joel owns a horse farm on the island.\n\nIn the Hamptons, Joel still maintains his Sag Harbor residence, which has also undergone extensive renovations in the last few years.\n\nIn 2018, after two and a half years of back and forth, the Sag Harbor Board of Historic Preservation and Architectural Review finally approved Joel’s plans to significantly renovate the multi-building property."
