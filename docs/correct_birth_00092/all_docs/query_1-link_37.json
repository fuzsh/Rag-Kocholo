        "text": "Billy Joel is one of the most famous songwriters, singers, and piano players in the pop music world of the second half of the 20th century. Born William Martin Joel in 1949 in NYC, he grew up being exposed to plenty of great music from jazz and soul to the early rock. His mum made him learn to play the piano and even supported him dropping from high school to pursue his musical career. Billy started appearing on the stage in the late 1960s as a member of some small pop and rock bands. His first solo album titled, Cold Spring Harbor was released in 1971 and a year later Joel signed up with Columbia Records, which produced most of his early albums. So far, he has released 13 studio albums and sold millions and millions of copies of his songs. The ones like \"We Didn't Start The Fire\", \"Piano Man\", \"Uptown Girl\", \"My Life\", \"The Longest Time\", \"You May Be Right\", \"Vienna\", and others are among the most popular hits of Billy Joel. He is the winner of 5 Grammy and plenty of other musical awards. He has been introduced to various Halls of Fame including one of the world's best songwriters.
