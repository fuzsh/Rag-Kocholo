The answer to trivia question #3 is... THREE!\n\n*BILLY JOEL has now performed with Sir Paul McCartney THREE times with their most recent collaboration on July 16, 2011 at McCartney's Yankee Sadium concert. BILLY JOEL also made a guest appearance at Sir Paul's opening CitiField concert on July 17, 2009! And, Sir Paul McCartney showed up, as a special guest, at BILLY JOEL's closing concert at Shea Stadium on July 18, 2008! The THREE concerts were all held in the month of July, in THREE different years and at THREE different venues!\n\nÂ\n\n4. Which original BILLY JOEL band member shot himself to death?\n\nDouglas Alan Stegmeyer, BILLY JOEL's longtime bass player. Doug grew up in the same Syosset, Long Island, New York neighborhood as me (our hometown). As an acquaintance, I partied with Doug in our teenage years. This is how I came to know about BILLY JOEL. Doug joined his band as his bass player in 1974. And although BILLY JOEL grew up in Hicksville, Long Island, New York, he later hung-out in Syosset, Long Island where he meet his first wife (Elizabeth Weber Small), manager (Frank Weber), hairstylist (Mary Sue Weber), sound engineer (Brian Ruggles), and bass player (Doug Stegmeyer) and band members, (Jon Small, John Dizek, Richard McKenna, and Harry Weber) from a prior band BILLY JOEL was in named, \"THE HASSLES\"! All these band members were all from Syosset, and I knew them all. Also, this is the town where the famous \"Italian Restaurant\" is located. Sadly, for reasons known or unknown only to BILLY JOEL, Doug Stegmeyer, after playing bass guitar for Billy for almost 20 years, BILLY JOEL wanted a new bass player and never asked Doug to the next band rehearsal. He was hurt, left in the cold, and went into a deep depression.Â Douglas Alan StegmeyerÂ committed suicide andÂ shot himself to death on August 24th, 1995.\n\n(A Doug Stegmeyer Video Tribute)\n\nÂ\n\n5. What did BILLY JOEL and band member Jon Small have in common?\n\nBoth of their first wives' were the same person! Jon Small's first wife, Elizabeth Weber, had an affair with BILLY JOEL and after divorcing Jon Small, became BILLY JOEL's first wife! At the time, this ended BILLY JOEL and Jon Small's friendship. But decades later, this incident did not stop their collaborations, because Jon Small is the same Jon Small that produced BILLY JOEL's 1987 KOHUEPT video, as well as, BILLY JOEL's 2008 \"Live at Shea Stadium\" movie video!\n\nÂ\n\n6. What was the name of the model that inspired the song \"Uptown Girl\"?\n\nThe name of the model who inspired the song \"Uptown Girl\" was...Elle Macpherson! While vacationing in the Caribbean, BILLY JOEL meet THREE models who were staying in the same hotel as he. They were, Elle Macpherson, Christie Brinkley and Whitney Houston. Inspired by the models, BILLY JOEL wrote the song \"Uptown Girls\", but changed the name of the song to \"Uptown Girl\" when he began to date Macpherson. After the song was written, and after Elle, BILLY JOEL started dating Christie Brinkley, and because Christie Brinkley later became his wife and was in the âªmusic videoâª everyone assumes that the song was written about her, which is just not true. A new book, \"The Girl in the Song\" by Michael Heatley and Frank Hopkinson (available on Amazon) chronicles this and other artists songs behind these hidden inspirers. But in the end, after breaking up with Elle Macpherson, it was Christie Brinkley who stole Billy's heart,Â and she became his second wife!\n\nÂ"
