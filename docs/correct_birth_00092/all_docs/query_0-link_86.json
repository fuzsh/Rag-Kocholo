        "text": "New York native Billy Joel is being honored with an exhibit of his most cherished items at the Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame in Stony Brook, New York.\n\nThe exhibit is called \"Billy Joel: My Life, A Piano Man's Journey.\"\n\nJoel was born in the Bronx and grew up on Long Island in Hicksville/Levittown. He was inducted into this Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nThis is the first exhibit of memorabilia, awards and more, from his 50 year career in music.\n\nJoel was taken by the retrospective being in his home.\n\n\"It's a little overwhelming,\" said Joel. \"(I've) never seen this much stuff of mine accumulated in one spot so it takes a while to absorb.\"\n\nJoel said the exhibit is due to the hard work from those at the Hall of Fame.\n\n\"I didn't get any of it. These guys found it they all collected it and tracked it down and Iâve never seen this much of my stuff.â\n\nKevin O'Callaghan is with the Hall of Fame. He designed the exhibit and said everyone he talked to had a nice story about the Piano Man.\n\nâI think he was the boy next-door to Long Island,\" said O'Callaghan. \"Everybody I spoke to, when we were doing the show, had a story about meeting Billy Joel somewhere. It was the weirdest thing, was like six degrees of separation kind of thing, you know, where everybody met him. Everybody had a few words with him, heâs just very connected. Heâs down to earth. Heâs a regular guy.â\n\nBilly Joel: My Life, A Piano Man's Journey opens to the public on November 24."
