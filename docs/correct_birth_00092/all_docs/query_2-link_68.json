        "text": "Artists often chronicle historical developments through their chosen medium. In the case of Billy Joel, some of his lyrics can be traced to the early sustainability movements as he wrote about the migration of people from the cities and the attendant problems with rapid suburbanization. Described by Tony Bennett as “a poet, a performer, a philosopher and today’s American songbook,” his lyrics address, among other topics, land use, community development, and environmental issues. Following World War II, there was a major shift in population settlement patterns in the United States. As war heroes returned home, not only did the country experience a population uptick with what is referred to as the baby boomer generation, but the introduction of the automobile and the investment in road and highway infrastructure created the perfect storm for population movements from the cities to the suburbs.\n\nThis paper seeks a way to uncover the role of aural experience in the affective and more effective construction of place. In the films of Tarkovsky, the ‘weak’ narrative, based on ambiguity and improvisation, intentionally creates a distance between the image and the story in order to weaken the logic of the narrative, originating a field of associative images that arouses strong personal interpretations. The same may happen in a city by applying subtle acoustic strategies, suggesting to its users a new, more involved, attitude, so that they cease to be external elements and become participants, accepting a moral responsibility in the progression of events. This hypothesis is explored through the analysis of the relation between image and sound in Tarkovsky’s film Stalker (1979) and behaviour observations in two sonic interventions held in the cities of Lisbon (1999) and Guimarães (2012).\n\nBy focusing on a soundscapes project started by Mexico City’s Radio Educación in 2006 and currently continued by Mexico’s Fonoteca Nacional, this essay investigates the social organization of urban spaces through sound and the use of sound. The discussion focuses on soundscapes as both descriptive as well as performative interventions that speak of socially informed models that organize urban space and our perception of it. In doing this I invoke Angel Rama’s classic characterization of the ‘lettered’ city as a ‘sounded’ city and argue that this conceptualization may help us problematize how some of these forms of aurality are shaped, controlled, and circulated within older networks of national power. I also examine their potential to engage denationalized or post-national circulations of knowledge through sound that allow for the establishment of new networks of ‘cultured’ belonging and distinction beyond national borders.\n\n[Presented as keynote speech to the 17 th Biennial Conference of IASPM (International Association for the Study of Popular Music), Bridge over Troubled Waters. Challenging Ortodoxies, Gijón, June 2013]. The theme of “Music as a place” raise a theoretical question: In what ways can musical life, on one hand, and the built space of the city, on the other, be mutually related? This paper faces this topic by proposing the intimate, domestic and private spheres as crucial loci of metropolitan musical life. These are not always underlined, but deserve close attention. Not matching the conventional, dominant images of “the city” as built public space, in these invisible realms the uses and meanings of music are strongly produced and negotiated. They simultaneously reveal the ongoing centrality of face to face relationship, as well as deep changes in a new urban common sense emerging in the late modern Cosmopolis.\n\nStarting from the overvaluation of visual culture in the modes of representation of society, this article draws a time line that goes from the marginalization of sounds promoted by disciplines such as geography, architecture and urban planning, until reaching to the acoustic definition of the landscape. In this way we demonstrate how the landscape is reincorporated in the agenda of these disciplines, not only as something visible, but as a cultural construction of our sensory activity, which is also made of sounds. This explains the anthropocentric nature of the soundscape, using the concepts of “sonorous image” and “sonorous identity” to reveal how sound attributes character to space and humanizes it, that can be seen from a global or local point of view. This in order to conclude how the patrimonial identity of sound is capable of characterizing specific urban contexts, its space, its habits and customs, while the ordinary identity contains a trait of &quot;detachment&quot; that ..."
