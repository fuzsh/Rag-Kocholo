        "text": "Billy Joel was born in the Bronx on May 9, 1946, to Jewish immigrant parents, Howard and Rosalind Joel. Before emigrating to America, Billy Joel's father was a professional pianist from Austria. Facing persecution for being Jewish, Howard emigrated to Switzerland, and later to the US via Cuba. After divorcing his wife, Howard moved back to Vienna, and was absent from Billy's life for more than twenty years.\n\nJoel's first passion was not music, but rather boxing. As a kid, Joel was constantly bullied, which led him to take up boxing. And he was quite good, too! As an amateur, Joel won his first 22 fights, and competed on the Golden Gloves circuit. After breaking his nose in his final fight, Joel decided to give up the sport and focus on music.\n\nAfter being forced into piano lessons, and excelling more as a boxer than a musician, Joel's life was changed when he watched the Beatles perform on the Ed Sullivan Show on August 14, 1965. Joel said of the performance, \"Up to that moment I'd never considered playing rock as a career... I was 15 when I saw them, and I remember thinking they looked like me and my friends. They looked like working-class stiffs - they didn't look like they were manufactured in Hollywood.\" Billy Joel would later perform at the Ed Sullivan Theater, and undoubtedly inspire a whole new generation of \"working-class stiffs.\"\n\nEven though Joel was born to non-practicing Jewish parents, when he was a kid, he used to go to Catholic mass. Joel said when he was a kid that \"he used to go to Mass with his friends,\" and that he viewed it as \"a lot of very enthralling hocus-pocus.\" Joel considers himself a \"cultural Jew,\" but admits that he is really an atheist.\n\nWhile he was a good student while attending Hicksville High School, Billy Joel was already working at a local piano bar while in high school. On the night before his English and gym final exams, Joel was working late and ended up sleeping through the tests. Because of this, Joel did not have enough credits to graduate with his class. Twenty-five years later, Joel sent in a list of his public engagements and speeches to his high school, and they determined that he had fulfilled the requirement. He was awarded an honorary degree and walked the stage in June 1992."
