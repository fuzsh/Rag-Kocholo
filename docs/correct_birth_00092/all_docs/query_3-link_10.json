        "text": "Billy Joel has long been associated with the piano thanks to his anthemic smash hit, ‚ÄúPiano Man.‚Äù But Joel is more than just a best-selling pop star. He‚Äôs an ardent Beethoven fan, a dedicated songwriter, and a talented entertainer. Keep reading to learn more about Billy Joel, his achievements, and what makes him a beloved pianist.\n\nBiography\n\nBilly Joel‚Äôs luck turned around when he caught the attention of Columbia Records, which freed him from his restrictive contract and helped him catapult to fame with the hit single ‚ÄúPiano Man.‚Äù\n\nüèÜ Key Achievements:\n\n‚ÄúJust the Way You Are‚Äù won the Grammy for Song of the Year and Record of the Year\n\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame: inducted 1999\n\n2013 Kennedy Center honoree\n\nLibrary of Congress Gershwin Award for Popular Song\n\nMore than 150 million records sold\n\nInfluences and Style\n\nBilly Joel has had a lifetime love affair with our favorite instrument. His father was a pianist, he grew up in a musical family, and he was enrolled in piano lessons from the age of four.\n\nRock music turned out to be a formidable path for Joel. In fact, he dropped out of high school to play in piano bars and support his mother financially.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the point of putting myself through writing and recording if it doesn‚Äôt mean what it‚Äôs supposed to mean out there in the world?\n\nBilly Joel to Vulture\n\nThe Piano Man\n\nPerhaps it‚Äôs the storytelling. ‚ÄúPiano Man‚Äù isn‚Äôt just catchy; it‚Äôs a nostalgic anthem about an older man asking a piano player to play a song from his younger years. And it‚Äôs inspired by Joel‚Äôs real-life experience working in a piano bar and the people he encountered there.\n\nBesides being a skilled songwriter, Joel is a brilliant entertainer who puts on a good show. He can imitate accents‚Äîhis own New Yorker twang is instantly recognizable‚Äîand he seamlessly integrates the piano into his speeches. Many of his Q&A sessions at universities across America are freely streamable on YouTube and make for lighthearted entertainment.\n\nLearn to play ‚ÄúPiano Man‚Äù\n\nFeeling nostalgic? Learn ‚ÄúPiano Man‚Äù and make your fellow bar patrons wistful. You can download the lead sheet here.\n\nIf you know how to read chord charts, you can also find many of Billy Joel‚Äôs hits for free online.\n\n‚ÄúNew York State of Mind‚Äù has frequent chord changes, but most of the chords are pretty basic. There are plenty of seventh chords, which opens up opportunities for jazz improvisation.\n\n‚ÄúUptown Girl‚Äù is a little more challenging because it‚Äôs in E major (four sharps), but the simple, driving rhythm should make even the simplest arrangement easy to sing along to. (Note: The linked Ultimate Guitar chord charts suggest a different key as it uses a capo, but I‚Äôve confirmed that the song is in E major üôÇ )\n\nSHARE THIS:\n\nCharmaine Li is a Vancouver writer who has played piano for over 20 years. She holds an Associate diploma (ARCT) from the Royal Conservatory of Music and loves writing about the ways in which music‚Äîand music learning‚Äîaffects the human experience.
