        "text": "Billy Joel will perform once a month at Madison Square Garden â€” as long as the fans will have him.\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning icon announced Tuesday that he'll perform a residency at the famed NYC venue every month for as long as New Yorkers demand. He's set to perform sold-out shows on January 27, February 3, March 21 and April 28. He will also perform on his 65th birthday, which is May 9. Tickets go on sale Saturday.\n\n\"We're gonna dust off some stuff. We're gonna feature more of the album tracks, more obscure songs. We'll still do some songs people are familiar with and like, but we're gonna change it up. It gives you an edge,\" he said in an interview after the press conference.\n\nJoel was introduced by New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who called the singer a \"worldwide superstar who values most that he is a hometown hero,\" citing Joel's participation in the Concert for New York City after the September 11 attacks and the 12-12-12 concert for Hurricane Sandy relief.\n\nThe Bronx-born Joel first performed at MSG in 1978. Since then, he has played at the venue 46 times.\n\n\"I said it in '78, and I'll say it again, there is no better venue in the world,\" he said.\n\nJoel will perform at Brooklyn's Barclays Center on New Year's Eve. He said that show and previous shows are prepping him for his MSG run.\n\n\"We did a series of gigs in England and Ireland and they went well. That's kind of how we warmed up to this,\" he said."
