        "text": "Born William Martin Joel on May 9, 1949, in Hicksville, Long Island, NY; son of Howard (an engineer and classically trained pianist) and Rosalind (a homemaker) Joel; married Elizabeth Weber (his business manager), 1973 (divorced, 1982); married Christie Brinkley (a model), 1985 (divorced, 1994); married Kate Lee, 2004; children: (second marriage) Alexa Ray. Addresses: Record company--Columbia Records/Division of Sony Music, 2100 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica, CA 90404. Website--Billy Joel Official Website: http://www.billyjoel.com.\n\nWith a career spanning more than three decades, Joel has proven his musical range to his loyal audience with a diverse collection of pop and rock hits that have become American standards. Perhaps best known for his soulful ballads, the multi-platinum-selling, Grammy-winning singer/songwriter rose to mega-stardom during the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and continued his successes well into the next millennium. His albums have been among those decade's biggest sellers: singles like \"Piano Man,\" \"Just the Way You Are,\" \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me,\" \"An Innocent Man,\" and \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" have garnered much commercial and critical acclaim.\n\nWilliam Martin Joel was born on May 9, 1949, and grew up in a comfortable Long Island suburb during the years following World War II. His German-born father, Howard Joel, who was imprisoned by the Nazis at Dachau during the war, moved to America after his release, to begin a new life in New York. That new life included adopting a new faith for his son---although Joel Sr. was Jewish, young Billy was raised in a predominately Catholic neighborhood and frequently attended mass and confession. One of Joel's future hits, \"Only the Good Die Young,\" would feature lyrics about a Catholic girl's reluctance to engage in premarital sex.\n\nMusical Training Began Early\n\nJoel's father secured work as an engineer with General Electric while his mother, Rosalind, set to work raising Billy and his sister Judy. Both of Joel's parents provided early musical influences: his father was a classically trained, self-disciplined pianist, and his mother had once sung in the chorus for Gilbert and Sullivan. Billy began piano lessons at age four and continued until he was 14, though he disliked learning classical music, theory, and the endless hours of practice.\n\nIn 1957, Joel's parents divorced; his father returned to Europe, and his mother supported the family by becoming a secretary and bookkeeper. Joel's maternal grandfather, Philip Hyman, became the primary father figure in Joel's life. As a teenager, Joel began skipping school, running with a less-than-tough street gang, and engaging in Bantam-weight boxing. Though he scored well on tests, his teachers refused to graduate him from high school due to his many absences. It was also during these years that Joel discovered the power of music.\n\nIn 1962, Joel saw a live performance for the first time when he went with friends to hear James Brown at Harlem's Apollo Theater. Other early influences included Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Elvis Presley, and the Beatles. Joel was deeply affected by the British invasion, so much so that he modeled his own budding style after the Beatles' Paul McCartney. Ironically, Joel also admired the hard-rock, psychedelic sound of Jimi Hendrix.\n\nIn 1964, Joel joined his first band, the Echos (later known as the Lost Souls), on the organ and vocals and began composing simplistic songs. His fate as a musician was sealed after the band's first paid gig at a Hicksville church. A short-term recording contract with Mercury Records was offered later, but nothing came of the demo versions of two of Joel's songs recorded by the band.\n\nIn 1967, Joel and drummer Jonathan Small left the Lost Souls to join the Hassles, another Long Island pop band with more exposure. At age 18, Joel's career was officially launched, though just barely. The group recorded two albums for United Artists that elicited a lukewarm reception from fans, 1967's The Hassles and Hour of the Wolf released in 1969. Yearning for something better than the \"bubble-gum\" rock produced by the group, Joel and Small left in 1969 to form the duo Attila. They released one \"incredibly loud\" self-titled album on the Epic label in 1970 before disbanding.\n\nExperienced Setbacks\n\nDiscouraged both by the failure of his first attempts as a professional musician and the end of a serious romantic relationship, Joel slid into a depression that included a half-hearted attempt at suicide. A very brief self-imposed stay at a psychiatric hospital convinced him that his problems were minor. As he told Debbie Geller and Tom Hibbert in their 1985 biography, Billy Joel, An Illustrated Biography, \"I got out and the door closed behind me and I walked down the street and said, 'Oh, I'll never get that low again.' It was one of the best things I ever did, because I've never gotten to feel sorry for myself, no matter what's happened....\" Joel's 1985 song, \"You're Only Human,\" would focus on the problem of teen suicide.\n\nHaving decided that his future lay in writing songs for others, Joel began composing material for a demo album in 1971. He was soon signed to producer Artie Ripp's Family Productions, a Los Angeles label, and Joel moved to California to record his first solo album. Cold Spring Harbor, originally intended simply as a vehicle to showcase his songs, was released in 1972. The album was technically inferior due to problems during the mastering stage of production; Joel's voice was speeded up and sounded, in his words, \"like a chipmunk.\" His association with Ripp would prove to be financially disastrous for the singer, who unfortunately signed away all publishing rights, copyrights, and royalties to his producer/manager for a period of 15 years. This deal reportedly cost millions to break later in Joel's career.\n\nAfter a six-month tour to promote the ill-fated album, Joel married Elizabeth Weber, ex-wife of fellow Attila member Small. Weber would eventually manage her husband's career and become the model for many of his songs about women.\n\nIt was \"Captain Jack,\" one of the songs Joel had performed live while on tour to promote Cold Spring Harbor, that indirectly gave him the break he needed. After hearing the song during Joel's set at the Mary Sol Rock Festival near San Juan, Puerto Rico, and later on East Coast FM radio stations, Columbia Records executive Clive Davis tracked Joel down, helped extricate him from his contract with Ripp, and signed him to the Columbia label.\n\n\"Piano Man\" Hit Top 40\n\nJoel's first Top 40 hit single, \"Piano Man,\" the title track from his second album released in 1973, was based on his experiences in Wilshire Boulevard's Executive Lounge. The album also contained, appropriately, \"Captain Jack,\" Joel's song about a rich young heroin addict. Because of its mellow, narrative style, \"Piano Man\" was immediately compared to Harry Chapin's \"Cat's In the Cradle\" and Don McLean's \"American Pie.\" By the end of the year, Joel had been named Cash Box's best new male vocalist, and the album had been named record of the year by Stereo Review. \"Piano Man\" was eventually certified platinum. Indeed, the single would become so synonymous with the singer that Joel would select it as the final song at all of his concerts for the next 30 years.\n\nIn an interview for Entertainment Weekly's Linda Sanders, Joel reflected on his music. \"I was surprised the title song \"Piano Man\" was a hit. In a way, that's the story of any hit record I've had---they're all bizarre, strange, novelty numbers, and not particularly definitive of my work.... My problem is that people tend to define me in terms of my hits and may not know the substantive elements of my composition.\"\n\nJoel began recording Streetlife Serenade, his follow-up to Piano Man, in the summer of 1974. With the exception of the single, \"The Entertainer,\" the album was not a success. \"Interesting musical ideas, but nothing to say lyrically,\" was how Joel explained the album's weaknesses in Entertainment Weekly. \"I was trying to be Debussy in the title track---it didn't work.\" After three years on the West Coast and the letdown following dismal sales of his third album, Joel and his wife returned to their roots in New York.\n\nWith his creative juices flowing once again, Joel began working on what would be his next album, 1976's Turnstiles. This was the first album Joel produced himself using musicians of his choosing, rather than those hired by Columbia executives. Joel recruited drummer Liberty DeVitto, bass player Doug Stegmeyer, and tenor saxophonist Richie Cannata, three men who would remain with Joel's backing band for years. Although Turnstiles, like its predecessor, was not a spectacular seller, the album contained good material, including \"New York State of Mind,\" a standard that would later be covered by Barbra Streisand.\n\nThe Stranger Became a Best-Seller\n\nAlthough Joel began to feel pressure from Columbia Records to record more than one album a year and to replicate his early success with \"Piano Man,\" he refused to produce formulaic music. Fortunately, he struck much-needed gold with his next album, The Stranger, released in 1977. Produced by Phil Ramone, the album was recorded during five weeks of enthusiastic studio sessions full of improvisations by Joel and his band.\n\nIn addition to the immense appeal of the title track, The Stranger included four hit singles: \"Just the Way You Are,\" \"She's Always a Woman,\" \"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song),\" and \"Only the Good Die Young.\" Joel's international reputation was now firmly established, and his national renown was reinforced as The Stranger won Grammy Awards for record of the year and song of the year. The album went on to become Columbia/CBS's biggest seller prior to the release of Michael Jackson's Thriller, even surpassing Simon & Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water.\n\nWith the public---if not the critics---lapping up his work, Joel consolidated his reputation with the 1978 release of 52nd Street. The music was very well received, and the first single, \"My Life,\" zoomed to number three on the Billboard charts. The album became Joel's first to reach number one in the charts and went on to sell millions of copies. Three years later, Glass Houses, Joel's second platinum album, heralded a change in the singer's image as a pop stylist. With New Wave replacing disco as the musical fad du jour, Joel jumped on the bandwagon and infused the album with more hard-hitting rock songs. His goal, apparently, was to throw figurative stones at his image. The singles \"You May Be Right,\" and \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" did well with commercial audiences but left the critics cold.\n\nReviews were relentless, and Joel's attempt to be taken seriously as a modern rock performer failed. Although he supposedly scorned the critics, he had a simultaneous need for their approval and was hurt by their dismissal of Glass Houses. \"I think there was a perception that I was trying to pose as a New Wave guy, and that wasn't in any way my intention,\" he told Entertainment Weekly. \"My intention was to write bigger stuff we could play in arenas.\"\n\nIn 1981, Columbia released the platinum-certified Songs in the Attic, a collection of new live recordings of material written in Joel's early days. The album included songs from Cold Spring Harbor that had never been properly recorded.\n\nJoel had already begun studio work on his next album when he was involved in a motorcycle accident in the spring of 1982. His left wrist was broken and his hand badly damaged. Following surgery, production of the album was temporarily shut down while Joel recovered. An additional obstacle for the singer was the breakdown of his marriage to Weber, an event partially blamed on the stress created by Weber's management of her husband's career. By the end of 1982, the couple divorced. When she left, Joel's wife took half of the singer's assets with her.\n\nJoel's soul-searching paid off with the release of The Nylon Curtain in 1982, Joel's first combined commercial and artistic success. It contained several sobering \"message\" songs about society including \"Allentown,\" the rhythmical tune about the plight of unemployed Pennsylvania steel workers, and \"Goodnight Saigon,\" a slow, mournful look at Vietnam and its veterans. Joel called The Nylon Curtain \"the album of which I'm most proud.\" As he told Entertainment Weekly, the album was not as fun to make as Glass Houses because it was so difficult. \"It was an ambitious undertaking---I wanted to create a masterpiece. I remember listening to `Allentown' and thinking, `This is good,' and that I had somehow created the feelings I had when I listened to Beatles albums.\"\n\nFound an \"Uptown Girl\"\n\nWith \"Allentown,\" Joel made his first transition from vinyl to video to promote his music and gained an even larger following. When his next album, An Innocent Man, was released in 1983, the MTV video era was in full swing and the upbeat, platinum-certified An Innocent Man featured several studies in romance that lent themselves to an MTV format. Joel's girlfriend, supermodel Christie Brinkley, appeared in the hit video \"Uptown Girl,\" the perfect counterpart to Joel's small-time tough guy. The couple was married in 1985, and later had a daughter, Alexa Ray.\n\nJoel scored big with the title song from his new album. However, An Innocent Man was significant as more than a collection of catchy tunes. The album was Joel's tribute to and re-creation of some of the sounds of America's favorite pop stylists, including Little Anthony and the Imperials and Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. It was also the last album on which Joel would use his tenor falsetto. \"I knew it was the last time I was going to be able to hit certain notes,\" he told Entertainment Weekly. \"I was waving goodbye to the boy voice.\"\n\nIn early 1984, Joel's first concert video, Billy Joel: Live From Long Island, was released. The inevitable Greatest Hits Volume I and II followed in 1985, a move by Columbia that Joel viewed as a time-stalling technique. The Bridge, his first studio album in three years, appeared in 1986 but failed to garner the huge reception from critics and fans Joel had hoped for. \"Not a happy album,\" he told Entertainment Weekly. \"I wasn't simpatico with the musicians, some of whom I'd been working with a long time. I don't think the material was good; I was pressured by management to put it out too fast. By the end, I sort of gave up caring, which for me was unusual.\"\n\nIn 1987, Joel performed to great acclaim in Leningrad and Moscow in what is now the former Soviet Union. His Leningrad concert was broadcast via some 300 radio outlets. Both concerts were recorded and released later that year as Kohuept, the Russian translation of \"In Concert.\"\n\nTwo years later, Joel worked with female musicians for the first time on 1989's Storm Front, his triple-platinum comeback album with a nautical bent. A seasoned sailor, Joel spends much of his free time aboard a 36-foot fishing boat near his home in Easthampton, New York. Storm Front's cultural critique, \"We Didn't Start the Fire,\" quickly became a Number One Billboard hit single along with the album itself. Joel received five Grammy nominations for the album and completed a 15-month world tour to promote it. 4.3 million fans saw him during 174 shows in 16 countries, including a performance in Berlin the day after German reunification. He also performed in the United States at Yankee Stadium's first rock concert.\n\nRiver of Dreams Ran Smoothly\n\nFour years after the Storm Front tour de force, Joel released River of Dreams, an album that again garnered critical praise. With the cover art for the album provided by Brinkley and a song (\"Lullabye [Goodnight My Angel]\") dedicated to their daughter, the album appeared to be a family affair. Fans were eager for a new release from Joel and the album hit the charts at Number One in its first week. It was certified multi-platinum by the spring of 1994. The genesis of River of Dreams began in 1992 while Joel was in Southampton with producer Danny Kortchmar where he recorded two Elvis Presley songs for the soundtrack of the movie Honeymoon in Vegas. During that time an early version of the album was written and recorded as \"The Shelter Island Sessions.\" Joel later re-recorded the songs in Long Island and New York studios.\n\nAccording to Time's Richard Corliss, River of Dreams is \"not just a cohesive concept album but also a bunch of damn fine songs with heart and hook.\" Including such diverse melodies as \"No Man's Land,\" \"The Great Wall of China,\" \"Blonde Over Blue,\" \"Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel),\" \"Shades of Grey,\" and \"It's All About Soul,\" the album may be Joel's most significant artistic achievement yet. It represents a move into a more philosophical form of songwriting and a return to his early classical music influences.\n\nIn the fall of 1993, Joel launched what he claimed would be his last marathon world tour to promote the new album. Then, the following spring, he and Brinkley announced their separation. Rumors that the split occurred because of Joel's constant absences while on tour surrounded the breakup.\n\n1994 started out with a bang as Joel was nominated for four Grammy Awards, all for River of Dreams, including Record of the Year, Pop Male Vocal of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year. Another big event in that year was the Face to Face Tour which teamed Joel with another top piano man, Elton John. Their tour was the hot ticket to have in 1994. However, there was also sadness for Joel, as he and Brinkley divorced in August.\n\nJoel was performing a concert in Osaka, Japan in 1995 when the Kobe earthquake hit, registering 7.2 on the Richter scale. The earthquake killed over 6,000 people. Joel donated the proceeds from his concert to earthquake relief. He also toured again that year with Elton John.\n\nJoel presented a lecture series at 32 schools in 1996, titled \"An Evening of Questions, Answers...and a little Music.\" With the proceeds of these lectures, he established the Rosalind Joel Scholarship for the Performing Arts at City College in New York City, honoring his mother. He also honored another love of his life, boats, by joining forces with Peter Needham to found the Long Island Boat Company.\n\nAchievements Merited Great Awards\n\nIn 1997, Joel released Billy Joel: Greatest Hits Volume III. He also won the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Founder's Award for lifetime achievement. In 1999, he received the American Music Awards \"Award of Merit.\" He also was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nJoel rang in the year 2000 by paling to a sellout crowd at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The performance was recorded for his 17th album, Billy Joel: 2000 Years - The Millenium Concert. In March of 2000, he received the Smithsonian Institute's James Smithson Bicentennial Medal. In May, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music for Southampton College.\n\nIn 2001, Joel performed a 25 city tour with Elton John, and was honored by the Songwriter's Hall of Fame with the \"Johnny Mercer\" Award.\" He released two albums, Fantasies and Delusions, and a compilation album, The Essential Billy Joel. In the fall, he gave a series of Master Classes. One of the classes was recorded in Philadelphia, and was aired as an A&E Special, \"Billy Joel: In His Own Words.\" Following the tragedies of 9/11 in the United States, Joel performed in many conferences to raise money for the September 11th relief fund, including participating in America: A Tribute to Heroes special that aired on 31 networks on September 21, 2001.\n\n2004 brought great changes for Joel. He signed a book contract with Scholastic to release two children's books. The first, Goodnight My Angel: A Lullabye, was released, with the second book, based on his song \"New York State of Mind\" was scheduled for release in the fall of 2005. Hollywood also recognized Joel, by placing a star for him on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard. In October, he married for a third time to twenty-three-year-old Kate Lee, a restaurant correspondent for PBS.\n\nby Mary Scott Dye and Sarah Parkin\n\nBilly Joel's Career\n\nPerformed at Hicksville High School with teenage group the Echos (later known as the Lost Souls) c. 1965; worked as housepainter and oyster harvester, late 1960s-early 1970s; joined rock group the Hassles, Long Island, NY, and recorded two albums for United Artists, 1967-68; formed Attila (organ and drum duo) with Jonathan Small, 1970; signed with Columbia, 1972; teamed with Elton John for tours in 1994, 1995, and 2001; formed the Long Island Boat Company, 1996; presented lecture series at 32 schools, \"An Evening of Questions, Answers...and a Little Music,\" 1996; presented Master Class series, which later aired as an A&E special, \"Billy Joel: In His Own Words,\" 2001; signed a book contract with Scholastic, 2004.\n\nBilly Joel's Awards\n\nCash Box, Best New Male Vocalist, 1974; Stereo Review, Record of the year for The Stranger, 1977; Grammy Awards, Best Album for The Stranger and Best Song for \"Just the Way You Are,\" 1978; ASCAP Awards, Song of the Year and Artist of the Year, 1978; Grand Prix Award (Japan), 1978; Billboard Music Awards, Number One Pop Album, Pop Album Artist, Male Pop Album Artist, and Male Pop Artist, 1979; Grammy Legend Award, 1990; Humanitarian Award, Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 1990; Century Award, 1994; ASCAP Founder's Award for lifetime achievement, 1997; American Music Awards \"Award of Merit\", 1999; Smithsonian Institute's James Smithson Bicentennial Medal, 2000; \"Johnny Mercer Award,\" Songwriter's Hall of Fame, 2001; Star placed on Hollywood Walk of Fame, 2004.\n\nFamous Works\n\nSelected discography\n\n(With the Hassles) The Hassles United Artists, 1967.\n\n(With the Hassles) Hour of the Wolf United Artists, 1969.\n\n(With others) Attila Epic, 1970.\n\nCold Spring Harbor Family Productions, 1972.\n\nPiano Man Columbia, 1973.\n\nStreetlife Serenade Columbia, 1974.\n\nTurnstiles Columbia, 1976.\n\nThe Stranger Columbia, 1977.\n\n52nd Street Columbia, 1978.\n\nGlass Houses Columbia, 1980.\n\nSongs in the Attic Columbia, 1981.\n\nNylon Curtain Columbia, 1982.\n\nAn Innocent Man Columbia, 1983.\n\nGreatest Hits, Volume I and II Columbia, 1985.\n\nThe Bridge Columbia, 1986.\n\nKohuept (live), Columbia, 1987.\n\nStorm Front Columbia, 1989.\n\nRiver of Dreams Columbia, 1993.\n\nBilly Joel: Greatest Hits Volume III Sony, 1997.\n\nBilly Joel: 2000 Years - The Millenium Concert Sony, 2000.\n\nThe Essential Billy Joel Sony, 2001.\n\nFantasies and Delusions Sony, 2001.\n\nMovin' Out Sony, 2002.\n\nSelected writings\n\nGoodnight My Angel, A Lullabye Scholastic, 2004.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nGeller, Debbie, and Tom Hibbert, Billy Joel: An Illustrated Biography, McGraw-Hill, 1985.\n\nHardy, Phil, and Dave Laing, Encyclopedia of Rock, Macmillan, 1988.\n\nMcKenzie, Michael, Billy Joel, Ballantine, 1985.\n\nStambler, Irwin, The Encyclopedia of Rock and Soul, revised edition, St. Martin's, 1989.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nAmusement Business, November 29, 1993.\n\nBillboard, October 7, 1989; December 23, 1989; November 6, 1993; November 13, 1993.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, September 10, 1993.\n\nHigh Fidelity, August 1987.\n\nLife, September 1987.\n\nNewsweek, January 29, 1990.\n\nNew York Times, October 14, 1992; October 4, 1993.\n\nPeople, December 13, 1993; October 18, 2004.\n\nRolling Stone, November 6, 1986; December 23, 1993-January 6, 1994.\n\nStereo Review, February, 1990; December 1992.\n\nTime, August 30, 1993.\n\nVariety, July 8, 1987; June 16, 2003.\n\nWashington Post, October 8, 1978.\n\nOnline"
