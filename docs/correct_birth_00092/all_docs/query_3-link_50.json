        "text": "Everyone always has a favorite genre of music. Even if they say they don’t have one and they “can’t choose”, they’re lying. Everyone listens to a type of music that puts them in a greater mood, or just simply makes their head bop back and forth. Although I love all types of music, listening to classic rock always puts me in a better mood. I know it is unusual for an 18 year-old to like music that was made mostly in the 70’s and 80’s, and perhaps I love classic rock because I grew up listening to it with my parents. Wherever my love for classic rock began, I want to dedicate this blog to my favorite artists in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. One of my absolute favorite artists is “The Piano Man”, Billy Joel.\n\nWilliam Martin Joel, or more famously known as Billy Joel, was born to Howard and Rosalind Joel on May 9, 1949, in Bronx, New York. His family moved when he was a child, and he grew up in Levittown on New York’s Long Island. Joel began taking piano lessons at the age of four, and he continued with piano lessons until he was 16. By that time, he already played in three bands.\n\nBilly Joel’s style of rock and roll is unique from other artists. He had a mix of classical training with experiences in the Long Island-bar band scene. Joel’s music contrasts from smooth romantics to hard rock material. He loves rhythm and blues, yet he features a mix of jazz, pop, and soul. This might be because of his early influences, such as Beethoven, the Beatles, Dave Brubeck, Ray Charles, Fats Dominos, etc.\n\nExamples of Joel’s Wide Range in Music:\n\nPop: “Piano Man” (1973)\n\nJazz: “Just the Way You Are” (1977)\n\nRock: Joel’s album Glass Houses (1980)\n\nHeavy pop with a 60’s influence: “The Nylon Curtain” (1982)\n\nDoo-Wop: “An Innocent Man” (1983)\n\nBilly Joel had one of the most successful careers in the music industry. Joel had at least one single that made the Top Forty every year but three, from 1974 to 1993. Three of his songs, “It’s Still Rock and Roll to Me” (1980), “Tell Her About It” (1983), and “We Didn’t Start the Fire” (1989) climbed to number one in the charts. Joel also sold 150 million records, has 23 Grammy nominations, and he has won six Grammy’s. Joel was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, and in 2001 he received their Johnny Mercer Award, which is the organization’s highest and most honored award. Among many other accomplishments in his life, Joel was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nIf I had to choose a favorite Billy Joel song, it would have to be “Scenes from an Italian Restaurant” (1977). This song starts and ends with a jazz sound, and the middle has a rock and roll contrast. The song includes a story about two high school sweethearts, Brenda and Eddie, who just do not seem to live the life they envisioned, and in the end they split up. Although these lyrics are extremely catchy, its not the reason why I love the song so much. It is a song that my family always sings word for word in the car wherever we are traveling to. Good memories are associated with that song.\n\nAlthough Billy Joel stopped writing his own music, he still performs monthly at Madison Square Garden in New York City. He is loved by the young and the old, and his unique style of music continues to touch millions of lives."
