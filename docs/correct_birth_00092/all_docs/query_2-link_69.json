        "text": "People around the world are familiar with Billy Joel and his music, but no one knows him quite like the those who knew the “Pre-Piano Man” Billy Joel.\n\nWHERE IT ALL BEGAN\n\nHicksville, New York. In the late 1940's in a nieighboorhood in Hicksville, New York a boy named Greg Hicks was born. Just over a year later, about five houses down, another boy was born. This boys name was Billy Joel. Throughout these boy’s childhood, they bonded and grew up together. Greg Hicks, now an Architect at the age of 67 with three children living in Albuquerque, New Mexico has a lot of insight into Billy Joel’s childhood and the beginning of his very successful career as a musician.\n\nCHILDHOOD\n\nMost people know Billy Joel as a famous American pianist, singer-songwriter, and composer. Hick’s, however, had the pleasure of knowing Joel before his big break as a musician.\n\nTHE INSPIRATION\n\nSome people have a defining moment of what they want to do with their lives, thanks to The Beatles appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show and the Hicks family TV, Billy Joel was able to have one of those defining moments.\n\nTHE BIG BREAK\n\nIn 1971 Billy Joel released his first album, Cold Spring Harbor. It wasn’t until a couple years later in 1973 that his career really started to take off with his first hit song, Piano Man. Ever since, Hicks has been a devoted fan of Joel, by following his career, staying up to date with him through Facebook, going to his concerts whenever Joel is performing nearby, and listening to his music.\n\n“My favorite song has to be Captain Jack. The reason for this is because it is about my hometown, well, our hometown. Hicksville is a special place to both Billy and I and Billy was able to capture Hicksville as well as the culture of the 60s and 70s. I could definitely relate to what he was talking about. For example the line, ‘So you stand on the corner in your New English clothes. And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes’ takes me back to my 60s and 70s wardrobe of Beatles style clothing. When I listen to Captain Jack, it immediately takes me back to my high school years and to my friendship with Billy.” -Greg Hicks\n\nTODAY\n\nToday Greg Hicks and his sister, Barbara Hicks, are quoted in Billy Joel’s Biography by Fred Schruers. Greg Hicks is planning on seeing Billy Joel in concert at the Pepsi Center in Denver, Colorado in September of 2015 and hopes to have the opportunity to reconnect with Joel.\n\nSOURCES\n\nGregory Tyler Hicks, Billy Joel’s childhood friend.\n\nA special thanks to Greg Hicks for sharing his insight and stories!"
