        "text": "Thirty years ago, Billy Joel released what he said would be his final album, The River Of Dreams. A lot of artists announce “final” albums. Billy Joel actually stuck with it…at least as of now.\n\nHe’s released a handful of new songs in the years since. Recently, Joel released the moving ballad “Turn the Lights Back On.” He then returned to the stage at the Grammy Awards for the first time in 30 years and performed his new song. The Piano Man was met with a standing ovation.\n\nWhile there have been some fans who want more new music from him, Billy seemed to be aware that he’d said everything he wanted to say: In “Famous Last Words,” the last song on The River of Dreams, he sings, “And these are the last words I have to say/It’s always hard to say goodbye/But now it’s time to put this book away.”\n\nThe lack of new material hasn’t slowed him down as a performer. He still headlines arenas and stadiums, and is now wrapping up his years-long residency at Madison Square Garden, where he’s been playing a show per month (not including during the pandemic) since January 2014.\n\nRELATED: Billy Joel Doesn't Get Why People Hate 'We Didn't Start The Fire' So Much\n\nFans also got the chance to experience The Piano Man’s residency from the comfort of their own home. CBS aired Billy Joel: the 100th — Live at Madison Square Garden on April 14, 2023. However, things went awry when the special first aired, because it began a few minutes later due to The Masters golf tournament. The special was suddenly cut short by CBS, which led to fan backlash and the network issuing an apology.\n\nThe final show of the MSG residency has been officially set for July 25, 2024. During a June 2023 press conference about the end of his residency, “I’m kind of flabbergasted that it lasted as long as it did. My team tells me that we could continue to sell tickets, but ten years … 150 shows — all right already!”\n\nBut his twelve albums have an embarrassment of riches: he’s had over thirty top 40 hits. But his album tracks and deep cuts have some true jewels as well.\n\nSo here, we’re attempting to rank his best songs: some of the bigger singles didn’t make our list. But some deep cuts did: if you’re not familiar with them, check them out now, and thank us later."
