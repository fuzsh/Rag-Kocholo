        "text": "(born 1949). U.S. singer, pianist, and songwriter Billy Joel ranked as a pop-music superstar from 1977. William Martin Joel was born in Hicksville, N.Y., on May 9, 1949. After quitting high school to become a rock musician, Joel performed in a series of bands that recorded three minor albums. In 1971 he released his first solo album, the poorly produced Cold Spring Harbor, which also flopped. After recording two more albums, one of which achieved moderate success, Joel rocketed to the top of the pop-music charts with The Stranger (1977). One of the best-selling albums ever produced by Columbia Records, The Stranger featured four hit singles, including “Only the Good Die Young” and “Just the Way You Are,” which won two Grammy awards in 1978, for song of the year and record of the year. In 1979 Joel’s 52nd Street (1978) won a Grammy for best album, while Joel captured the award for best pop male vocalist. His 1982 album Nylon Curtain with its socially conscious songs marked a departure from his previous emphasis on romantic and slice-of-life themes. His other albums include An Innocent Man (1983), The Bridge (1986), Stormfront (1989), and River of Dreams (1993). In the early 1980s, Joel was among the first established rock performers to make music videos. In 1999 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nFantasies and Delusions, featuring classical compositions by Joel, was released in 2001. Movin’ Out, a dance-focused musical based on two dozen songs by Joel and conceived, choreographed, and directed by Twyla Tharp, premiered in 2002. In 2006, having earlier undergone treatment for alcohol abuse, Joel released 12 Gardens Live, a concert album."
