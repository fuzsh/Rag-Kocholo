        "text": "November 17, 2014\n\nThis book famously began as an autobiography until the 11th hour, when Billy Joel abruptly pulled it from the publishing schedule and paid back his advance, claiming he wasn't interested in getting into the nitty-gritty of his personal life (namely, his ex-wives and -girlfriends). His co-author on the project, Fred Schruers, still had hundreds of hours of personal interviews with Joel, so it seemed logical that he would take the reins and turn the book into an authorized biography.\n\nTo be sure, when it focuses on the music, the book is highly informative, tightly written, and filled with juicy nuggets (I'm a diehard Springsteen fan, and I hadn't been aware how deep the connection [and appreciation] between the two went). Joel is a great interviewee, smart and witty, possessing far more self-awareness than most of his rock brethren.\n\nThing is, it's hard to see why Joel would have yanked the autobiography, but then authorized this. For a man who says he doesn't believe in therapy or heavy introspection, Joel spends a substantial amount of time here doing heavy self-analysis and myth-making.\n\nThe other problem with this book is with its subject: Joel has not been a recording artist for more than 20 years. His tours remain highly popular, but also highly static (Joel rightly points out that his audiences don't give him the same benefit of the doubt they give Springsteen and Dylan, perfectly willing to hear deep cuts and adventurous set lists; Joel's been playing roughly the same set for two decades).\n\nThe upshot is that the biography hits a brick wall around 1995 and turns more into a truly gloomy cataloging of Joel's failed relationships (with some spirited repartee with Elton John thrown in). Fully one-third of the book features Joel examining in great detail why every relationship he's been in ended. If that's your thing, you will love this book. I fully admit it conquered me.\n\nThis is no knock on Schruers, who did his homework, got Joel's inner circle on the record, and does his best to make Joel's post-'95 period seem as compelling as his recording period. He also uncovers a lot about Joel's heritage, namely his family's experience in the Holocaust, that lend great perspective to Joel as an artist. And he accomplishes what a good biography should: he successfully convinces you of his subject's importance. I've run hot and cold on Joel's music in the past, but my appreciation for it -- and of Joel himself -- deepened as I worked through this book.\n\nBilly Joel is under no obligation to record or tour again. He owes us nothing. He is entitled to any solitude or sunset-riding he wants. He seems like a restless spirit, ambivalent about fame and the rigors of touring, but also thriving on it. Whatever makes him happy. As grist for a life-spanning biography, however, his 20-year creative funk mars what is otherwise an engaging, thoughtful book. Recommended with reservations.\n\nDecember 29, 2016\n\nAs I briefly mentioned in my updates, I love reading a biography or memoir where I can actually learn something about the person that I didn't know before going into the book. That happened a lot with this book, and I love Billy Joel even more now than I did a week ago (by the way, who in the HELL ever decided Billy Joel wasn't \"cool\"? This man is the epitome of cool.)\n\nSuffice to say, I loved this book. And the fella who read it, Kirk, did a good job capturing different voices (at least, until he hit the 90% mark). This book has revved the engine for what might be my biggest Billy Joel kick ever. I bought Turnstiles and 52nd Street last night because of this book, then went to the library this afternoon and found the full concert plus the documentary about the Last Play at Shea. FANGIRLING.\n\nIt was incredibly interesting to learn about the inspiration for Billy's songs, and I felt for him when he had to deal with all the shit his manager pulled. And then to wind up dealing with three divorces just sounded insane. This might be why I'm in absolutely no hurry to get married, but who knows?\n\nYou really get a feel for how much research went into this book, not in the least if you read the Note on the Sources at the end of the book. A hundred hours of interviews with Billy alone, plus a hundred hours of interviews with friends and associates. It's incredible. If you're a Billy Joel fan, or just a regular hardworking Joe Schmo who appreciates other people being down to earth, I highly recommend this book.\n\nJanuary 30, 2022\n\nI have recently read two biographies of music legends, enjoyed them both but this one was more entertaining for me than the David Bowie book. Whereas the Bowie biography was in-depth and full of information this one was far easier to read and would appeal to more than just the fanatical followers.\n\nI was interested to read of Billy Joel’s upbringing, how his family came to America, . His father’s family were wealthy Jewish industrialists in Germany but lost their business when it was taken off them by the Nazis. They escaped Europe and landed in America via Cuba, settling in New York when Billy’s father was a teenager. His father left the family home when he was eight and moved to Austria leaving Billy’s mother struggling to raise and support the family. Billy took up boxing as well as taking piano lessons and he soon got proficient at both. But after watching ‘The Beatles’ on the Ed Sullivan show Billy decided music was the route he wanted to take.\n\nI didn’t know that Billy had two failed suicide attempts after bouts of depression before meeting his first wife Elizabeth and starting a successful career. I was more aware of the happenings from then on but it was still very enjoyable to read.\n\nAugust 3, 2015\n\nAn interesting look at both Billy Joel's life and behind the scenes of the big-time music life including the record companies and touring mechanization. The author doesn't pussy-foot around Joel's marriages or his car accidents or his trips to rehab. Joel's music has often seemed autobiographical and the stories behind the songs doesn't change my opinion about that. What seems most remarkable is that through the woes of his life, Joel is always forgiving (he is on friendly terms with all of his exes).\n\nI'd like to read this again with my Billy Joel albums ready to cue to remind me of songs that I have pushed to the back of my forgetful brain.\n\nOctober 10, 2014\n\nBased on interviews with Joel, his friends, family, band mates and many others, this biography takes us from Billy Joel’s family history all the way to the present. Joel has long been one of my favourite singers and I cannot help agreeing with Elton John, that he is a bit of a conundrum, so I was very interested to find out more about him. I have never read a biography of his life before, although I was aware of the major events, but it was good to have a proper, thorough account of his life and career.\n\nThe book begins with Billy Joel’s family history, his childhood and difficult relationship with his father. We move on to his early love of music and fledgling bands, such as The Hassles and Attila. We follow his story from a stuttering start to his career (although personally I love those first albums) to the massive success of The Stranger. There are management issues (some of them extremely serious ones), record label worries and personal issues. Billy Joel is totally open in this book; discussing his marriages to Elizabeth, Christie Brinkley and Katie Lee, his problems with alcohol, his perceived ‘fallings out’ with Elton John and Liberty De Vitto. Along with the difficulties, there are also positive things. His deep love for daughter Alexa, his regard for his loyal fans, the high spots of his career, such as the Last Night at Shea with Paul McCartney and being honoured by his peers.\n\nThis is an honest and open account of Billy Joel’s life, but you do still get the sense that he really doesn’t understand – even now – how superb he truly is as a singer and a songwriter. I would love him to write some new material and have the confidence and the passion to make new albums. He has so much to offer, not just as a live act, but as a musician and, although I know there have been the odd new song along the way, he openly admits that he has lost the will to record. Still, every album he has made are familiar, old friends, constantly replayed and his music – like the man – has stood the test of time.\n\nNovember 25, 2014\n\nWhen this book came across my desk at work (one of the perks of being a librarian), it didn't matter that I was already reading three books that were due back in the library before this brand-spanking new one would be. It was a book about Billy Joel, who is not only my favourite singer of all time but is also one of my real life heroes. Everything else HAD to go on hold until I could read this one. Because his music is my one true love and true love lasts a life time.\n\nNow, some of the things brought up in this biography is stuff I was already well aware of -- his battle with depression, the collapse of his three marriages and some of the vague details behind them, the stories behind a few select favourite songs of mine. But even the things I knew were further developed in this book than I had ever read or heard previously.\n\nAnd then there were some parts I had no idea about -- like the fact that my favourite song from his first album was, for all intents and purposes, his suicide note during his FIRST suicide attempt. When I thought about the lyrics, I realised that I SHOULD have known that right from the off.\n\nI've always been aware that this man, whose music is the soundtrack for all major events of my life, is a flawed human being. I knew the generalities of some of the mistakes he's made over the years, and all of the trials he had to face. But knowing the IDEA of something is a lot different than knowing complete details. It broke my heart, made him even more human than his music has always painted him, and made me love him and his music even more than I did before (which I would have assumed previously to be impossible.)\n\nWhile there are still some songs that we don't get the story behind (including some of the ones in my top ten), we get enough to learn how his mind works. And, well, I learnt that even this genius musician, whose music is perfect and WONDERFULLY human and wise and SO SO easy to relate to, thinks he's not a great piano player or songwriter. In a weird way, that gives me hope. Because I KNOW he's talented -- if I could only pick one musician to listen to for the rest of my life, it would be him -- and if even he thinks he's not that great (despite all evidence to the contrary), then it makes me think that maybe I'm not as bad at my hobbies as I always think I am.\n\nNote this though: the writer is obviously a fan of the musician, so if you want to read something to bash Joel and his work, then this is NOT the book for you. Go pick up a REALLY old edition of an album critique for The Bridge or Nylon Curtain if you're looking for something to hate on.\n\nMay 19, 2016\n\nSchruers' \"definitive biography\" of Billy Joel relies so heavily on extended quotations -- mostly from Joel, but also from bandmates, friends, and ex-wives -- that it reads more like an oral history than a proper biography. Joel's is a sufficiently engaging personality, however, which somewhat justifies the format. The only real complaint is that much of the mid 70s-mid 80s stretch of Joel's life and career, the part in which I believe most readers would be interested, is notably bereft of details, with entire album cycles sometimes being summed up in little more than a page. This isn't to say that the last two decades of Joel's life aren't worth study, but a bit more nitty gritty about the recording sessions and the artistic drive and process behind them would be welcome. Schruers does do a fine job of explicating Joel's lyrics as autobiography and weaving them throughout the narrative, but his and Joel's easygoing geniality and unwillingness to speak ill of or hold grudges against anyone does give the reader the sense that there's quite a bit being left unsaid. Some context and embellishment is given to all of the major beats of the Joel mythos -- the suicide attempts, the depression, the on-stage outbursts, the accidents -- but there aren't any revelations to be found. Mostly, it just feels like sitting down to hear stories from the man himself, which isn't altogether a bad thing, just maybe not enough to be truly \"definitive.\"\n\nApril 23, 2018\n\nO.K. Here's the deal . . . If you're not a ridiculous, die hard fan of Billy Joel you'll like this book better than someone who is a super-freak, Billy lover (like moi) and here's the reason why.\n\nThere's not a ton of information in this book that most people don't already know, some juicy bits to titillate curious beings, such as myself, etc., etc., etc.,\n\nI also was not a fan of Mr. Schruers writing. It was okay but lacked a certain . . . shall we say, natural flow.\n\nOh Well, it was what it was. But if you don't want to read a large book about Billy, just flip between a couple of magazines and YouTube some of his songs.\n\nJune 19, 2015\n\nI admit that although I am a Billy Joel fan- I didn’t know much about him. I found this a fascinating account of his life and career. It follows his quite difficult childhood.\n\nHe started in a garage bands and writing music. They persuaded him to record and he has had great success- he has also written for a lot of the greats.\n\nHe pours his feelings into his music and the piano has helped him through many turbulent times. We hear about his married life and his many interests.\n\nI really enjoyed this one- many thanks to the publisher and Net Galley for a copy of this book.\n\nDecember 26, 2014\n\nI think most celebrity biographies are dullest in the opening chapters and only really get interesting as the person's career takes off, but I had the opposite experience with \"Billy Joel\" -- Joel's family history is fascinating, for fans as well as anyone who cares about 20th century history in general, and his journey from Long Island to California and back again is generally fairly absorbing. But Schruers' focus on Joel's personal life ultimately works to the book's detriment, because once Joel's creative well dries up in the early '90s, the book only has his love life to talk about, and it becomes a sort of dating memoir for a rich, lonely guy in his 50s and 60s. On balance, an interesting read, and this lifelong fan learned more than expected, but a deeper focus on the music and Joel's post-pop creative life might have made it something special.\n\nMarch 15, 2015\n\nmeh. I'm a fan of the piano man so I bought this book. Most of what I read I already knew. It's not packed full of information that's not already available to the public.\n\nSchruers, however is a pretty bad writer. He has written for the \"Rolling Stone\" and it show is this work. It reads like a long (too long) rolling stone article. I haven't enjoyed a rolling stone article in a long time now, and his writing style grew irritating quickly in this book.\n\nI prefer a \"definitive biography\" to have a more professional and unattached style to it. Schruers injects too much of his opinion into the book. At times it seem Schruers is not trying to retell the life of Billy Joel as much as he's trying to write a short story with Billy Joel as the main character.\n\nI would not recommend this book to anyone.\n\nMarch 24, 2024\n\nLiked it but felt slow and rough around the edges at times. Definitely learned some new facts and tidbits about Billy though!\n\nSeptember 8, 2023\n\nBest biography I’ve ever read. Of course that may be because I love Billy Joel. There were a lot of details that I didn’t know about Billy Joel’s life.\n\nMarch 9, 2023\n\nOk strap in; this is more my personal ode to Billy the great than a review!\n\nYes it’s taken me many years to finish this quite long book - I’m a bit all over the place with reading (Hello ADHD!)\n\nGreat biography! Definitely the best music artist biography I’ve personally read. The incredible amount of time and research the author put into it is simply astounding! I can’t say I learnt a huge amount, as I have literally been a die hard fan since I was about 8 or 9 years old, (now 51!) but I did love learning more about Billy as a person. Huge kudos to the author for his research and attention to detail! Fantastic job!\n\nSo, I LOVE Billy Joel! I have loved him and his music for well over 40 years.\n\nI love almost every song he’s ever written, I have every single CD he’s ever released, most also on cassette tape and many of my darling late Mum & Dad’s old vinyl albums! (nothing to play any of them on though haha)\n\nBilly’s music was a massive part of my childhood with both my late parents being big fans. Mum had his albums playing on the old vinyl all the time at home, and we did some mean Billy “sing-a-longs” on car trips on the old cassette player! We had an epic family rendition of “For the longest time”!\n\nMy fondest memories will always be Mamma & I singing duet and harmonising perfectly to “The night is still young”, from my childhood, well into my 40’s! 😢\n\nI proudly had BILLY ROCKS & I LOVE BILLY JOEL written in Nikko pen all over my 80’s canvas school backpack. I didn’t even care that I got picked on a bit, and considered a bit “daggy” coz everyone else at high school in the late 80’s were into the big rock bands of the time (Bon Jovi, Guns n Roses etc)\n\nI have been lucky enough to see The Great Man in concert several times here in Australia, most memorably “The River of Dreams” tour in the early 90’s.\n\nBut honestly, one of the greatest highlights of my life, was seeing Billy play Madison Square Garden just before Christmas, December 19th, 2018 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻\n\nSeeing your lifelong idol play, in his hometown and at such an iconic venue, WOW! The biggest pinch me night of my life!\n\nI could only get a scalpers ticket (jerks they are!) and it cost me $1000 AUD, which hurt a bit on a 5 week US/Canada trip with 2 kids, OUCH!!\n\nAND I had to go on my own! But, 2nd row…. Haven’t regretted it for a single second! Alexa Ray came out and sang, which was incredible; and Billy’s young daughter Della Rose (then just 3 years old) even came on stage!\n\nBilly wore a Santa hat most of the evening too, Christmas spirit alive and well!\n\nSome other people from the trip were there, scattered far and wide. (We were all on my/our daughters dance trip to dance at Disneyland, Disney world and Universal in Orlando, and finishing up in The big Apple)\n\nOne of the other dance mums and her 2 daughters were chosen from the “nosebleed seats” to come down the front (bastards, i had to pay a grand for that, hahaha) and another good mate who danced w my daughter, and also a massive Billy fan; somehow gate crashed and got up to the front too, so we were all singing and dancing right in front of the stage! Aahh… one of THE best nights of my life!\n\nBilly Joel is a musical genius, super entertaining to watch and is funny and gets involved with the audience.\n\nI adore him!! #1 Aussie fan, my dying wish would literally be to meet him in person. One can dream…..\n\nI even chose “She’s Got a way” as one of the songs for my mamma’s funeral.\n\nGreat book, even if you’re not a mega fan like me! 😊\n\nWow just noticed I started reading on March 9 2016 (my mamma/best friend was still alive then, only 60 years old) and just finished on March 9, 2023! What’s the odds on that! 7 years is pretty embarrassing- but hey 🤷🏼‍♀️ 7 is also my lucky number!\n\nMaybe I’ll get to meet the great man after all! 😛😛😛 Dream on girl!\n\nDecember 12, 2014\n\nThis is a good biography of Joel and in a way can be likened to an autobiography as it is mostly told in direct quotes from Joel himself. The story is that Billy was working on his biography and at a certain point handed the material and job over to Schruers, his official biographer. Thus, this is a pro-Joel book and not the place to be if you are looking for the \"dirt\" or trash-talking. I found the beginning and ending of the book very good but the middle dragged. Upon starting I was fascinated to find myself reading a thrilling Holocaust survival story as Billy Joel's family history is told. I hadn't expected this! I didn't even know he was Jewish, for some reason I thought he was Italian. LOL. The early days, and story right up to the early years of his marriage to Christie Brinkley was an interesting story for me. I was actually captivated as the book really centred on the industry and told Joel's life through his songs which are all very autobiographical. I've read several books about rock stars, but this is the first one that has ever seriously been about the industry itself. Then Billy becomes involved in legal issues with his (ex)manager and counter suits, etc. etc. plus he stops writing and this part of the book was very slow going for me and I waded through it hoping I'd get interested again. Which I did when Joel reaches more modern times post 9/11 and his career is revitalized. Now the impact of his music, his legendary status as a songwriter and his continued success as a performer and speaker take us up to the present. The book doesn't hold back on controversial subjects (his alcoholism, rocky friendship with Elton John, etc) but Joel speaks of them bluntly, of where he is with them now, not lingering on the demons or heartaches. This is his general approach to life and a theme throughout the book. I recommend this biography if you want to know more about Billy Joel's music, the man who wrote the songs and why, the type of life he lived and where he is now, in mind and body. I don't recommend if you are looking for the juicy stuff about Joel's demons, his alcoholism, who he slept with etc, it's just not that type of book.\n\nJanuary 2, 2016\n\nAs an aging baby boomer (hey don't knock the aging part, it beats the alternative) I have some specific requirements in my musical taste. It must have a melody, it must have lyrics that one can understand, and it should have some meaning. That explains my love of the Beatles, Stones, Mommas and Poppas, Fleetwood Mac, and other bands of the \"ancient\" era whose songs continue to age well. Some mellow jazz and a few classical pieces round out my preferences. Billy Joel has long been a favorite but I knew relatively little about his life other than the headline makers - marries the beautiful Christy Brinkly only to have it flame out, gets ripped off to the tune of millions by his financial manager, gets in automobile crashes with some regularity, closes down Shea Stadium with help of friends like Paul McCartney, sets record for performances in Madison Square Garden, has to undergo rehab, etc. While those events are covered in detail, I think what I really enjoyed about this book is the insight into the creative process, the development of various songs and how they relate to his life and the continuous striving by the hard working kid from Long Island. Since the book was written by a contributor to \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, the author's insights carry much credibility. Whether I am taking this to 5 stars because of my admiration for the subject, I can't be sure, but for me it was one of my more interesting reads of the year. Definitely a must for any Billy Joel fan.\n\nDecember 11, 2017\n\nAuthor Fred Schruers gives us an up close and personal view of the life of Billy Joel. It took me longer than expected to read the book because I kept listening to the songs and watching the music videos (the funniest was no doubt \"Uptown Girl\" that I saw through a new lens after reading the behind-the-scenes scoop). As a non-musician, this book gave me a whole new appreciation for how tough it is to make it in the music industry and the collateral damage that happens in building a career. Billy Joel has had four wives and spent so much time on the road that it left little time for his personal life. I learned that your manager can make or break your career in the music business. You find out a bit about Billy Joel's suicide attempt, depression, alcoholism, motorcycle accident, and his spat with Elton John. Yet, unanswered questions remain on why Billy Joel hasn't had any new songs in 20+ years and just how does he feel about this dearth of creativity.\n\nJune 4, 2018\n\nLater this year my family and I are going to see Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden to attend one of his permanent monthly gigs. Before attending the show, and being a long time fan of Billy Joel's, I wanted to learn some more about the Piano Man.\n\nBilly Joel so far has had an interesting life- whether it be from his early upbringing, to how show business has given him some great times and how those have taken advantage of him and his kindness in such a cut throat industry .\n\nI really enjoyed reading this book, although it took me longer than expected (just due to the day to day needs of work and home life). Songs of Billy's rang through my head as I read this book and I am now keen to listen to the box collection of his music before we see him in concert.\n\nI hope that Billy continues to provide a diverse performance in the show that we see later in the year. He may have matured, but no doubt his voice and engagement with the audience remains enthusiastic.\n\nJanuary 15, 2015\n\nOddly, I found the first quarter of Fred Schruers's biography of Billy Joel, which deals mainly with the singer's family history and youth, to be perhaps the most interesting—and revealing—part of the book. Part of this may have to do with the fact that the singer's years as a recording artist—which would generally be expected to constitute the meat of this kind of book—are covered relatively rapidly (Schruers is largely done with them by the time we reach the biography's midpoint), but I suspect the problem really is that the book's second half is almost entirely devoted to Joel's love life in his 50s and 60s and is, frankly, a bore. I do not really fault Schruers for this, but rather see it as a reflection of the shift in Joel's own life, from a creatively hungry, relentless songwriter and performer to a middle-aged man who mostly finds his pleasures away from the piano and the stage.\n\nJuly 20, 2015\n\n3.5, but rounded up because, let's be honest, it's Billy Joel. The prologue has a severe disconnect in style to the rest of the biography with too much combination of telling in the wrong place and showing too much. It also bothered me that the book starts off with Joel's paternal grandfather instead of Joel himself, but the author seems to have wanted to be fairly chronological. Other than those two complaints, I enjoyed reading and learning where the inspiration for his songs came about. The way he almost always puts in a few lines of warning or caution that unfortunately come true. I liked knowing that \"The Nylon Curtain\" was the hardest album for him, as its feel is my favorite of his albums. Overall, I enjoyed this biography, though I do wish it had been more autobiographical in voice.\n\nOctober 22, 2020\n\nBilly Joel's career as a singer/songwriter/piano man took a surprisingly tortuous path to fruition and could have gone off the rails many times along the way but he kept going and despite many serious setbacks and betrayals within the music business he persevered until attaining the heights and stayed there, against all odds, despite having pretty much stopped writing \"songs\" with lyrics in the 1990's, until the present day, becoming an iconic figure, collecting many honors and demolishing concert records all along the way. Journalist, Fred Schruers has captured his story in detail with all the personal problems and professional trials laid out but in a balanced way, steering clear of sensationalism and gossip while still getting all the facts. It's an epic and interesting effort. - BH.\n\nFebruary 21, 2019\n\nThis book is for fans. I grew up in Levittown as a baby boomer, too. Schruers did get one thing wrong. The local hangout wasn’t the Parkway Green. It was the Village Green as Joel mentions in one of his older songs, specifically the West Village Green (there was more than one). I haven’t read any other bios of Billy Joel and this one was pretty comprehensive going back to his grandparents. It went through the early days of struggle, his relationships, friendships with other musicians, the inspiration for many of his popular songs, and up to 2016. There were lots of insights from Billy himself and pictures. It’s obvious that he loves what he does and is a gifted songwriter and musician. Rock on, Bill!\n\nFebruary 9, 2016\n\nYou might not know this about me, but I LOVE BILLY JOEL! My mom was really hooked on him when I was a kid, so I was exposed to a LOT of him, and his was my very first concert (An Innocent Man tour, 1984). I can sing all the words to a ridiculous number of his songs, and a ridiculous number of them still make me cry. Every time. So I enjoyed this book a lot, though I do sort of wish there was a little more focus on the music itself. I learned quite a bit about Joel that I didn't already know, and I find I have even more love and respect for the man now.\n\nSo, uh, yeah. Anyone want to have a singalong with me? Heh...\n\nFebruary 20, 2019\n\nI usually avoid Biographies because they are just someone's findings or research, I usually prefer Autobiographies but I got to say that this one was excellent! Maybe its because of all the quotes from Billy that made it much more personable, maybe it's from all the historical data shared. It was well organized and flowed chronologically. It allowed me to follow along the history I already knew and the details that now linked together and made perfect scenes. Great read, very enjoyable and informative.\n\nDecember 5, 2021\n\nThis book started off red-hot, and surprising as Joel's forebearers escape the looming Holocaust in Europe, although it did cool off a little bit after Joel ends his career of recording new music in the early 1990s. Nonetheless, the writing is professional and smooth, with great access to Billy Joel and his associates. Highly recommended to those who like Billy Joel's music.\n\nMay 31, 2019\n\nVery good biography of Billy Joel, from his family’s travels from Germany to Cuba to the U.S., his childhood, and the ups and downs of his career.\n\nDecember 13, 2020\n\nThis book had to be a rush-job. It glances through the interesting part of his career in the Seventies and Eighties and and spends probably 40% post 2000."
