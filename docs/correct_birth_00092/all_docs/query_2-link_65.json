        "text": "Want to take a Greyhound on the Hudson River line?\n\nConsider 26 Kings Road your next stop.\n\nThe Orange County estate, located in Highland Falls, which once was the summer home of American financier JP Morgan and the spot that inspired one of Billy Joel’s most iconic songs is up for sale — if you’ve got a cool $2.5 million to spare.\n\nTucked away in the trees with a direct view of the Hudson River, the estate is made up of two lots: a main house with 4,288 square feet of room and a 1,577-square-foot carriage house.\n\nTogether, there are nine bedrooms and seven full bathrooms on a lot that is over two acres large.\n\nIn the biggest upstairs bedroom in the main house, realtor Jody Atkinson claims that Billy Joel wrote the famous 1976 tune — shortly after arriving off the Greyhound. The song was later recorded in Hempstead, Nassau County, and was featured on Joel's \"Turnstiles\" album.\n\nOutside of the dining room, Atkinson wrote, guests can walk to a covered dining patio, “alongside the very same steps industrial titans and presidents walked upon.”\n\nWith a pool, a tree-top balcony, and stunning water views, it’s no wonder the home was the setting and inspiration for the classic tune.\n\nMost recently, the estate was used as a bed and breakfast.\n\nSo if you’re looking to get away for a holiday from the neighborhood, this may be the spot for you.\n\nFor more information and additional pictures, click here."
