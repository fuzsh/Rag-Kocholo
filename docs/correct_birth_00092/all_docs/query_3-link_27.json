        "text": "Joel was born to Jewish parents in The Bronx, New York in 1949 and moved to Long Island a year later where he spent his childhood. He began piano lessons at the age of 4, and had an interest in boxing as a teenager, even competing on amateur circuits in New York.\n\nHe was initially reluctant to take on music, but came to love it and would miss school for piano gigs. The young Joel decided not to finish high school to focus on music. Early musical influences for him were The Everly Brothers, Elvis Presley, and The Beatles, with their performance on The Ed Sullivan Show leaving a lasting impression on him.\n\nJoel is most known for his work as a solo artist, but he has played in several bands as well. The first band he joined was a British Invasion cover group called the Echoes at the age of 16. He then joined the Long Island band The Hassles in 1967, before leaving the group with drummer Jon Small to make the duo band Attila.\n\nAttila only lasted about a year, and ended in 1970 soon after releasing a self-titled debut album because Joel had an affair with Small's wife Elizabeth. Joel and Elizabeth later got married in 1973 and divorced later in 1982.\n\nWhile Joel had a new Columbia contract, the release of his new album was getting made difficult by his old label Family Productions. Eventually, Joel was fully bought out, and then-President of Columbia Walter Yenkitoff even bought back the rights to Joel's old songs with Family Productions and gave them to the singer as a birthday gift.\n\nJoel's next two album Piano Man and Streetlife Serenade weren't national smash hits like what would follo, and received some mixed critical reviews upon first release, but these still contain songs that are essential listening for any fan.\n\nJoel performing at nightclub The Bottom Line in NYC's Greenwich Village neighborhood. The singer eventually tired of L.A. life and made his way back to New York City in 1975. He recorded the album Turnstiles soon after returning home, which contains the hit pop song \"New York State of Mind\" which has been covered by some of the best singers of all time including Barbra Streisand, Frank Sinatra and Elton John.\n\nJoel has had several rotating bands over the years, but worked extensively with (L-R) Liberty DeVito, Doug Stegmeyer and Richie Cannata to produce his early music and accompany him on tour. Several of these past band members reunited when they were inducted into the 2014 Long Island Music Hall of Fame, besides Stegmeyer, who passed away in 1995.\n\nJoel's 1977 album definitely put him on the map in a major way after several great but less-successful projects. It was the first record produced by Phil Ramone, who he would collaborate with five more times on incredible albums, and contained massive Joel hits like \"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\", \"Only The Good Die Young\" and \"Vienna\". Its song \"Just The Way You Are\" won Joel his first two Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year as well.\n\nJoel poses with some of his gold-certified records at home in New York. He followed up The Stranger with 52nd Street in 1978. This album was notable for going in a different musical direction from his previous ballads with inspiration from jazz in particular. Joel even brought in famous musicians from the genre to help with recording including jazz trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and guitarist Steve Khan.\n\nThat's right, Joel wasn't just sitting on a motorcycle for show in that music video. The star has been an avid motorbike rider since a young age. Even though he had suffered a serious accident in 1982 that badly injured his hands and delayed production of his album The Nylon Curtain, Joel still loves riding to this day.\n\nJoel wasn't the first pop artist to tour Russia, but it was certainly one of the biggest concert productions in the history of the Soviet Union. He was also being filmed by a video crew for the entire tour to offset its huge costs. The stress of this tour and production led to some outbursts by Joel during a Moscow concert, including in frustration from the camera crew shining lights in the crowd, and the fact that some concertgoers did not seem initially enthusiastic.\n\nJoel's 1989 album Storm Front was recorded during a period of emotional and financial upheaval for the artist, including having to fire and sue his former manager Frank Weber and an ex-lawyer for fraud related to discrepancies in accounting for Joel's finances. Joel was awarded $2 million in a partial judgement against Weber.\n\nAt the very least, Joel was able to turn these tough periods into excellent music, and his projects Storm Front and his final rock album River of Dreams were huge hits and explored more serious personal themes for the rocker.\n\nJoel decided to go back and finish up the paperwork and become a high school graduate in 1992. Here he is at Hicksville High in a gown. He was only one English credit shy of the diploma, but just simply hadn't been showing up for classes or exams because of his music commitments."
