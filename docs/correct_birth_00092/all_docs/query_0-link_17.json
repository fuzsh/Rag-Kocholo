        "text": "Billy Joel’s houses are as grand as his musical oeuvre. The Piano Man, who was born in the Bronx and raised on Long Island, hasn’t strayed too far from his New York roots. Only in the past decade or so has he made the move toward a warmer climate, picking up a series of properties in South Florida. The musician’s attachment to his home state even inspired one of his best-known songs, 1976’s “New York State of Mind,” which was composed entirely during a Greyhound bus ride from the city back to his upstate rental. (“I had it in my head before I even got home,” he said in a recent New York Times interview.) Suffice it to say, his venture into Florida real estate over the past decade may not mean that he’s “Movin’ Out” of New York state entirely. In fact, the singer-songwriter recently picked up an equestrian estate in East Hampton. Below, we’ve rounded up some of the places that Joel has called his own over the past 50 years or so.\n\nHudson Valley rental\n\nIt’s a familiar story by now: Joel was riding the Greyhound bus up the Hudson River when he was inspired to pen the song “New York State of Mind.” The home that he was returning to was a roughly three-acre estate about 50 miles north of Manhattan that he and his first wife Elizabeth Weber rented in the mid 1970s. (They tied the knot in 1973.) The five-bedroom brick Cape Cod–style abode already had an interesting history before Joel’s arrival: The first owner was J.P. Morgan, who built a home on the property in 1872 specifically for the unobstructed views of the Hudson. The original structures burned down in a fire, but the residence built in its place in the 1950s utilized bricks from the damaged buildings. In addition to the 4,300-square-foot main house, there is also now a three-bedroom carriage house,a one-bedroom cottage, an in-ground pool, and a private vineyard on the property. The owners who purchased the home in 1980 turned it into a bed-and-breakfast, naming a second-floor bedroom adorned with sheet music-printed wallpaper “the Billy Joel room.”\n\nOyster Bay glass house\n\nIn addition to their upstate sanctuary, Joel and Weber also kept a stunning glass house in Oyster Bay, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Long Island sound. Images of the couple at home in 1978 unsurprisingly reveal that the couple had positioned a grand piano in a prime spot in the living room facing out toward the water. Joel’s 1980 album, Glass Houses, likely drew inspiration from this home, which is pictured on the album cover.\n\nUpper East Side town house\n\nIn 1982, Joel bought Weber a $4 million, six-story, redbrick town house on the Upper East Side during a rocky period in their marriage. His hope was to reportedly reconcile their relationship with the generous gift, but the “Uptown Girl” singer’s grand gesture failed to fix things. The pair ultimately divorced two years later, though Weber continued to live in the 10,000-square-foot property with her son until 1997, when it finally sold for $3.74 million. A listing of the tony residence reveals six bedrooms, five bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, six wood-burning fireplaces, a sauna, an elevator, and a private pool.\n\nFrench Château–style Hamptons home\n\nIn the mid 1980s, Joel and his second wife, supermodel Christie Brinkley, paid an undisclosed amount for a 12-acre oceanfront property in Amagansett, New York. The estate comprised a large manor house with its own pool and garden, a three-bedroom guest house, a 1700s-era barn, and a second pool. The French Château–style residence proved to be a happy home for the musician for about two decades before he sold it to Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld for $32 million in 2000. At the time, the sale broke property records for the most expensive purchase in the area. “The Billy Joel sale was an emotional one: Jerry Seinfeld just wanted that house,” a realtor said at the time. After his purchase, Seinfeld had a baseball diamond installed and moved his extensive antique car collection into the 22-car garage.\n\nOyster Bay beachfront estate\n\nShortly after selling his Hamptons mansion to the Seinfelds, Joel picked up a beachfront estate in his hometown of Oyster Bay for $22.5 million in 2002. The 26-acre property, known as Middlesea, comprised several structures, including a 20,000-square-foot megamansion, a three-bedroom guest house, a four-bedroom gate house, two swimming pools (Joel reportedly had the indoor pool covered so that he could instead use it as a music room, according to the Wall Street Journal), a helipad, and a floating dock, and 2,000 feet of water frontage on Oyster Bay Harbor. The main mansion boasted a bowling alley, a wine cellar, a spa and salon area, and six fireplaces. Joel called the property home for the better part of two decades before putting it on the market for $49 million in spring 2023. By that point, the Grammy winner and his fourth wife, Alexis Roderick, were reportedly looking to spend more time in Florida. (Joel’s third marriage was to Food Network personality Katie Lee Biegel, from 2004 to 2009.)\n\nMediterranean-style Palm Beach mansion and town house\n\nIn 2015, Joel moved down south, snapping up a $22.1 million Mediterranean-style mansion near Palm Beach, Florida. The property comprises nine bedrooms and 11 bathrooms spread out across 13,300 square feet, including a guest house and staff quarters. Built in 2010, the property exudes over-the-top luxury, with a double-height foyer and two winding staircases with wrought iron banisters. Arches and marble pillars abound in the opulent home. Situated on one of Manalapan’s narrower barrier islands, the estate has views of the water on both its eastern and western ends, with a primary bedroom with its own private patio overlooking the pool. There is deeded ocean access and a dock. The musician first attempted to list the property for $31.9 million in 2018 to no avail. He bumped up the asking price to $64.9 million in 2022, but failed to find a buyer. Most recently, he slashed the price down by $10 million, to $54.9 million in early 2024. While trying to sell off the behemoth Palm Beach mansion, Joel quietly picked up a $9 million town house nearby in 2021.\n\nBoca Raton estate\n\nIn early 2024, Joel reportedly picked up a $29 million estate in Boca Raton’s exclusive Sanctuary development. A deed filed at the end of January revealed that someone had purchased the 15,000-square-foot home, situated on a unique corner lot with more than 560 feet of water frontage. Security is of the utmost importance at the gated and guarded community, and it presently hosts less than 100 homes, with high-end amenities such as tennis courts, a recreation area, and a 23-slip marina.\n\nEast Hampton getaway\n\nA few months later, the Grammy winner reportedly paid $10.7 million for an equestrian estate in East Hampton, just in time for the summer. The five-acre property also reportedly boasts a lily pond. “It’s down a long gated driveway on an unassuming East Hampton street that shares Alec Baldwin as a neighbor,” a source told the New York Post. “There has been a lot of activity on the property, fence building, landscaping, lots of vehicles.” Other celebrities who live in the area include Jay-Z and Beyoncé, Robert Downye Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Neil Patrick Harris."
