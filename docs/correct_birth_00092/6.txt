NEW YORK -- Billy Joel's hometown in New York honored the music legend by naming a street after him and giving him a Key to the City.

Billy Joel Way officially replaced a section of Audrey Avenue in Oyster Bay, Long Island on Thursday.

"My mom would've been thrilled. I wish she could see it," Joel said after addressing a crowd of his fans at the ceremony.

Stefanie Nelkens and Neil Bod, both Oyster Bay residents, said they've been to 80 concerts combined.

"I will be so happy walking down Billy Joel Way," said Nelkens.

"I have my own street sign," said Bod.

William Martin Joel was born in the Bronx, but spent a big part of his childhood in Oyster Bay, where he's since owned multiple homes.

The multi-platinum selling artist and philanthropist said he was hesitant to accept the honor at first.

"This was from the New York State Legislature: 'You want us to rename a street after you?' And I said, 'Yeah but don't you have to die first?' And then they came back with the answer, 'Yes,' and I said, 'Honestly, I'd rather still be alive and not have the street.' But now I've got the best of both worlds," said Joel.

The 6th grade band from James H. Vernon School played at the ceremony, while others in attendance said they were honored by Joel's presence, his contributions to music, and his connection to Oyster Bay.

"It's definitely shocking and I'm speechless," said 6th grader Shea O'Brien.

"It's something that they're gonna remember for the rest of their lives," said teacher Lauren Macy.

Fans have even more to look forward to: Joel announced a special show on May 9 at Madison Square Garden in honor of his 75th birthday.

Tickets go on sale at the end of October.
