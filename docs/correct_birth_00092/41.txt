Billy Joel

Full Name: William Martin Joel

Profession: Pianist, Songwriter and Composer

Biography: Billy Joel was born and raised in New York City. He started piano lessons at age 4. His parents divorced when he was 8, leaving his mother to raise him and his sister alone, as his father relocated to Vienna, Austria. Seeing The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show inspired him to pursue a career in pop music.

Since releasing his first hit song, "Piano Man," in 1973, Billy Joel has become the fourth best-selling recording artist and the third best-selling solo artist in the United States. His 1977 album "The Stranger" proved to be his biggest commercial and critical success.

After his 1993 album "River of Dreams", Joel largely retired from songwriting, but continues to perform occasionally, including a monthly single-show residency at Madison Square Garden in NYC, which has been held since January of 2014.

Joel is also a five-time Grammy Award winner who has been nominated for 23 Grammy Awards throughout his career and has sold more than 160 million records worldwide. Joel was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999.
