        "text": "Alessandro\n\nAlessandro is an opera written for the Royal Academy of Music composed by George Frideric Handel in 1726. Paolo Rolli was the librettist and based the story on Ortensio Mauro's La superbia d'Alessandro. This was the first opera where Handel had cast together in the same opera the famous singers Faustina Bordoni, as Rossane, and Francesca Cuzzoni, as Lisaura. Handel made use of their real-life professional rivalry in his treatment of the story. The original cast also included Francesco Bernardi. Handel had originally planned Alessandro to be his first contribution to the 1725/1726 season of the Royal Academy. However, Bordoni did not arrive in London in time to stage Alessandro, and Handel substituted his own Scipione in March and April 1726 until his arrival. The opera received its first performance on 5 May 1726 at the King's Theatre, London. The story is based around Alexander the Great's journey to India, where he meets Poro, the king of India, who was the subject of another Handel opera of that name.\n\nShailene Woodley .:\n\nAm I going to survive what Im going through right now and ever be healthy, or even have the opportunity to work on projects Im passionate about again because of the situation Im in ? she said she thought at the time.

Now Im on the other side of it, thank God. A lot of the last few years has been aboutfocusing on mental healthfor me, and its a slow process, but because of that work, I feel very grounded and rooted in who I am and very clear about everything in my life, whether its my career or my relationships or my own internal worth. Furthermore, she added : I feel very grateful to have walked that line of fire because now I know what I dont want to ever go back to. Shailene Woodley.
