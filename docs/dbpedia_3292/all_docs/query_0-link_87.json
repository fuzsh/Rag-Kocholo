        "text": "a family of Italian Renaissance architects and sculptors.\n\nGuliano da Sangallo (real surname, Giamberti). Born in 1445 in Florence; died there Oct. 20, 1516. Architect, engineer, and sculptor.\n\nGuliano developed the traditions of F. Brunelleschi. His buildings are marked by compositional clarity, airy proportions, and graceful articulation. Examples include a villa in Poggio a Caiano (near Florence, begun in 1485) and numerous fortifications in Poggio Imperiale (1488). His church of Santa Maria delle Carceri in Prato (1484–95) is among the earliest examples of the Renaissance centrally domed church.\n\nAs a sculptor, Guliano was a follower of Donatello. His interest in rendering a sense of movement is evident in his tombs for the Sassetti family in the Sassetti Chapel of the Church of Santa Trinitain Florence (marble, 1486).\n\nAntonio da Sangallo the Elder. Born in 1455 or 1463 in Florence; died there Dec. 17, 1534. Architect and sculptor.\n\nAntonio collaborated extensively with his brother, Guliano da Sangallo. His most important independent work was the church of San Biagio at Montepulciano in Tuscany (1518–45). This centrally domed structure is marked by more severe and monumental classical forms than similarly planned structures by Guliano da Sangallo.\n\nAntonio da Sangallo the Younger (real surname, Cordiani). Born in 1483 in Florence; died Aug. 3, 1546, in Terni, Umbria. Architect. Nephew and pupil of Guliano da Sangallo and Antonio da Sangallo the Elder.\n\nBeginning in 1503, Antonio worked in Bramante’s workshop in Rome. His works include numerous fortifications, including some in Parma (from 1525). After Raphael’s death in 1520, Antonio became chief architect of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. His proposal to give the church the shape of a Latin cross was rejected by Michelangelo in favor of a central plan. Antonio’s mature works in Rome include the Palazzo Farnese (1513–34, completed by Michelangelo and G. della Porta), the Banco di Santo Spirito (1523–24), and the Palazzo Sacchetti (1543).\n\nThese structures are marked by the abandonment of a story-by-story articulation of facades and by a monumentality and unity of forms, which anticipates the early baroque."
