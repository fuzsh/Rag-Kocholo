        "text": "Francesco Mochi was another pupil of Giambologna, and was one of the seventeenth-century sculptors who were also master bronze casters. He made two marvellous baroque equestrian statues of sixteenth-century rulers: Alessandro Farnese (1545–1592) and his son Ranuccio Farnese (1569–1622), Duke of both Parma and Piacenza. The statues of these rulers in Roman dress and without stirrups were finished in 1625 and 1620 respectively, and placed in the Piazza Cavalli in Piacenza."
