He is an Italian cardinal, grandson of Pope Paul III and is a great collector of arts. He received many benefices. To name a few, he became the Vice Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church, Governor of Tivoli, Archpriest of St. Peter’s Basilica and he was later put to position as Bishop of Montreal, Sicily in 1536. He later founded a Jesuit college there.\n\nThe painting depicts the image of the cardinal walking past a window and was holding a letter. The background used by the artist was a dark hall yet the foreground is bright. The painting is now housed in Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte in Naples."
