        "text": "Paul III\n\nOctober 12, 1534 - November 10, 1549\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nBirth and Family\n\nwas born in 1468 to a noble family in Canino, near\n\nHis grandfather Ranuccio had been a successful and the Commander-in-chief of the papal forces under He also served as a senator in the government of Rome.\n\nEducation\n\nAlessandro's education began in where he was tutored by Pomponio Leto (1428-98), a whose devotion to antiquity resulted in his imprisonment during the pontificate of who condemned classical culture as \"pagan.\"\n\nAlessandro then went to to live in the household of in the and study under the humanists who tutored the It was then that he became friends with who would later become Pope Leo X.\n\nHe attended the University in\n\nCAREER AS A CARDINAL\n\nNickname of the \"Petticoat Cardinal\"\n\nSoon after he entered the Church, Alessandro was made cardinal-deacon by whose favorite mistress was his sister. She was called \"la Bella\" on account of her great beauty. Alessandro's nickname of \"petticoat cardinal\" was a slighting reference to his promotion because of his sister's merits.\n\nAdvancement as a Cardinal\n\nAs a cardinal, Alessandro acquired many bishoprics and other benefices. His talent in administration put him at the forefront of the pontificates of Alexander VI, and The palace he began in Rome while still a cardinal, one of the in the city, attests to his wealth.\n\nMistress and Family\n\nLike many members of the clergy in the Renaissance, Alessandro Farnese had a mistress and illegitimate children. He had at least with his long-time mistress, a Roman noblewoman named Vannozza Cattanei. He had three of his children legitimized by Popes Julius II and Leo X.\n\nAlessandro's main failing as a pope was his fundamental dedication to the interests of members of his own family, especially his eldest son, Pier Luigi.\n\nHis other children were Paolo, Ranuccio, and Costanza.\n\nReforming Diocese and Lifestyle\n\nAfter becoming the Bishop of Parma in 1509, Alessandro began to take his clerical duties much more seriously.\n\nHe instituted the reforms recommended by the Fifth Lateran Council, which he attended in 1512 on behalf of Julius II. He later came to be identified with the reform party of the Curia (papal administration).\n\nIn 1513, he gave up his relationship with his mistress.\n\nElection as Pope\n\nAlessandro, who had been a strong contender for the office of pope in previous elections, was unanimously elected in 1534 after two days of voting. Because he was 67 years old and in poor health, his pontificate was expected to be brief. It turned out to be the of the sixteenth century, however.\n\nAlessandro took the name of Paul because the pope at the time of his birth was Paul II. He would have preferred the name \"Honorius,\" but the other cardinals objected.\n\nADDRESSING THE REFORMATION CRISIS\n\nOverall Approach\n\nThrough his personal experience with both Church reform and politics, Paul III had a good idea of how to combat the and reform the Paul III is generally credited with beginning the\n\nBecause he had witnessed the opposition and lack of cooperation that efforts at reform generated a decade earlier, Pope Paul III realized that he must not rush the process, but instead, use diplomacy and patience.\n\nPreliminary Report of Reforms Needed\n\nPaul III set up a council to study problems in the church. Their report, Consilium de emendenda ecclesia, formed the basis for the work of the upcoming\n\nThis report also came into the hands of the Protestant opposition, who used its forthright criticisms of the Church to bolster their own attacks.\n\nAppointing Well-Qualified Cardinals\n\nPaul III realized that part of the corruption in the Church was due to the appointment of men who were unqualified and indifferent to the best interests of the Church. He tried to improve the situation by nominating a series of men of outstanding character and ability to the office of cardinal. Chief among them were Giovanni Carafa, later and Marcello Cervini, later Other outstanding appointees were Gasparo Contarini and Reginald Pole.\n\nMore controversial were the cardinal-level appointments of his grandsons who was only fourteen years old, and Guido Ascanio who was just sixteen.\n\nEncouraging Reform-Oriented Orders\n\nPaul III encouraged both the initiation of reforms within existing and the foundation of new orders dedicated to reform.\n\nThe most important of the new orders was the Society of Jesus, known as the It was founded in 1534 by the Spanish priest Ignatius Loyola.\n\nIn 1540, Paul approved the Jesuit order in Italy, where it became a powerful tool in the Counter-Reformation. The Jesuits were dedicated to aggressively spreading Catholicism through education. The pope's grandson Alessandro was later the principal patron of the Order's home church in Rome.\n\nPUNITIVE MEASURES\n\nEstablishing the Inquisition in Italy\n\nPaul III tried to combat the schism within the Church through a more aggressive approach to rooting out To this end, in 1542 he established the \"Congregation of the Inquisition,\" the highest authority in heresy cases in Italy.\n\nAlthough the activities of this papal tribunal were restrained under Paul's administration, it later lapsed into the horrors associated with the Spanish Inquisition, which had been approved by\n\nEstablishing Censorship and the Index\n\nBecause many of the ideas underlying the Reformation had been spread through Europe by pamphlets, Pope Paul sought to stop the spread of heresy by preventing the publication of such works. To this end, in 1543 he established the Index, a list of banned books and publications.\n\nExcommunication of Henry VIII\n\nIn 1534, as a response to the Church's refusal to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, the first of his six wives, Henry VIII declared himself head of an autonomous national church, the Church of England. took the first steps toward excommunicating the English king in 1533, but the process was slow and not completed before the pope's death in 1534. In 1538 Paul III renewed the excommunication and put England under interdict, meaning that English Catholics could not partake of the\n\nCALLING A CHURCH COUNCIL\n\nProposal of Council in Mantua\n\nThe pope wanted to call a pan-European council to meet in in 1537. He sent ambassadors from Venice and Vienna to travel in Europe and promote the idea among church leaders and princes.\n\nOpposition by Parties At War\n\nBecause the emperor and the French were again at war, they wished to defer the matter. A group of bishops did meet in in 1538, but the small size of the gathering and the lack of the major foreign powers led the pope to put the idea of a general council off again.\n\nAttempt to Reconcile Religious Differences\n\nPart of the emperor's reluctance to support such a council was his belief that the two sides, the and the Lutherans, could find a common solution. He spent a considerable amount of time forming councils and instituting a compromise position in Germany that neither party found acceptable.\n\nThe pope found the emperor's attempts to define church doctrine to be ill-informed and meddlesome.\n\nTreaty of Crespi\n\nAlthough in 1542 Paul III called for a council to be held in Trent, the opening of such a council was postponed until after the protracted conflict between Charles V and was settled with the Treaty of Crespi in 1544.\n\nSelection of Trent\n\nThe pope accepted the emperor's suggestion of meeting in which was in Germany at that time, although he would have preferred meeting in a city in his own sphere of influence.\n\nCOUNCIL OF TRENT\n\nOpening and Agenda\n\nThe Council of Trent opened in December, 1545.\n\nThe emperor wanted to limit the agenda to reform, but the pope insisted that the council should first define an official position on dogma.\n\nDefining Dogma\n\nThe council took up the issues of church dogma that had been challenged by the northern reformers. Among other things, they defined an official position with regard to scriptural interpretation, original sin, justification (being \"saved\"), and the\n\nVictory over Schmalkaldic League\n\nIn 1546 war erupted between the emperor and the Schmalkaldic League, a coalition of German Protestant rulers and noblemen whose rebellion was also a move toward independence from the The pope supported the emperor with additional troops and funds.\n\nThe emperor had hoped his victory over the League would give him the leverage to force them to attend the Council of Trent.\n\nMoving the Council to Bologna\n\nAfter the plague broke out in Trent in 1548, the Italian delegates, who wished to be in a more hospitable environment, proposed that the conference be moved to The pope approved the move, and the Italians transferred to the papal city, but the emperor instructed the northern delegates not to go. The emperor was disappointed at losing the opportunity to expand attendance to include the Protestants, who might have attended in Trent but would not go to Italy.\n\nDissolution of the Council\n\nWith discussions at an impasse, Pope Paul suspended the first session of the council in 1548 and dissolved it in 1549.\n\nHis death that year prevented his reconvening the council.\n\nSignificance of the Council\n\nThe meetings of the council between 1545 and 1548 represented an important step in the Church's internal refashioning, showing that the administration was open to the use of the council as a vehicle for reform and redefinition of the Church's position on the dogma under discussion. The council continued to meet until 1563, spanning four more pontificates.\n\nFAMILY DISPUTE OVER PARMA-PIACENZA\n\nCreation of Duchy for Son\n\nIn 1545, the Pope removed and from the and created a duchy for his eldest son, Pier Luigi, who was also his favorite.\n\nMurder of Pier Luigi\n\nIn 1547, Pier Luigi was murdered in a plot involving Ferrante Gonzaga, who was the Governor of Milan, and the emperor, who considered Pier Luigi an enemy on account of the latter's pro-French policies.\n\nThe pope never forgave the emperor for his involvement.\n\nDispute with Ottavio over Duchy's Return\n\nAccording to standard rules of succession, Parma and Piacenza should have passed to Pier Luigi's son However, Ottavio was to Charles V's illegitimate daughter Margaret of Austria, and Paul III was concerned that if Ottavio succeeded the duchy, it would eventually fall into the emperor's hands. The pope instead argued that the property should return to papal control.\n\nOttavio refused to give up Parma and sided with the emperor, who wanted him to inherit the duchy.\n\nDeath of the Pope\n\nThe pope felt betrayed by Ottavio's refusal, and on finding that his favorite grandson, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, was also a party to Ottavio's decision, he was devastated. The pope died soon afterward of a fever, but he forgave Ottavio and ceded Parma to him before he died.\n\nParma remained under Farnese control for nearly two centuries.\n\nCOMMISSIONS AT THE VATICAN\n\nMaking Commissions and Using Assistants\n\nPope Paul III resumed construction on several major projects at the and initiated accomplishing much during his fifteen-year pontificate.\n\nThe pope generally had assistants handle the details of his commissions. Often his grandson Alessandro performed this function, much as Giulio de' Medici had done during the pontificate of his cousin Leo X.\n\n♦St. Peter's. The pope resumed construction of under the direction of Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, who had been in charge since the death of Raphael in 1520. After Antonio's death in 1546, the pope persuaded who was 71 years old, to take charge of the building works. Michelangelo abandoned Antonio's and and returned to a of Bramante's Because there was conflict between Michelangelo and the Vatican construction committee, Pope Paul III found it necessary to insist that they give the architect a free hand. Initially, Michelangelo refused payment for his work at St. Peter's. In the end, he did receive the modest sum of 50 ducats per month. However, this salary was paid from papal coffers rather than from the Vatican building fund, as was customary, thus freeing Michelangelo from oversight by the Fabbrica. Â\n\n♦Belvedere Court. Paul's pontificate witnessed the completion of the framing the by and The courtyard, a thousand-foot-long, three-level court designed by Bramante for Julius II, connected the with the which had been built by\n\n♦Last Judgment, 1534-41.Â Paul III commissioned Michelangelo to paint the in the His predecessor, Pope Clement VII, originally commissioned the project, but he died before it could be begun.

Â\n\n♦Pauline Chapel, 1542-50. Pope Paul commissioned the construction and decoration of a small private chapel near the Sistine Chapel. For this project, designed a rectangular room, which was decorated by by Perino del Vaga and frescoes by Federico Zuccaro. Michelangelo was commissioned to paint the side walls with scenes illustrating the conversion of the pope's namesake, the and the martyrdom of his earliest predecessor as pope, the Â\n\n♦Sala Regia, 1538-1449. The pope commissioned the restructuring and redecoration of the a formal reception hall that is to the Sistine Chapel. Construction took place between 1538 and around 1540. Perino del Vaga executed the coffering of the barrel-vaulted ceiling. The walls were painted after Paul's pontificate, and it is not known what he had planned. Â\n\n♦Apartments in Castel Sant'Angelo. Paul III commissioned the decoration of a suite of apartments in the Castel Sant'Angelo. Perino del Vaga painted the walls with fictive architecture and decorated the ceilings with gilded stucco coffering.Â\n\nCOMMISSIONS IN ROME\n\nCity Planning\n\nIn preparation for a visit by the emperor in 1536, Pope Paul began to repair much of the damage done during the repairing fortresses and walls around the city. Like Julius II, Paul III envisioned restoring Rome to its former splendor and focused a considerable amount of attention on enlarging and beautifying several important public spaces.\n\n♦Beginning Piazza del Campidoglio, 1538. Paul the project to build the in 1538 when he asked Michelangelo to move the ancient statue of to stand in front of the Palazzo Senatorio on a new base of his design. It is unclear how much of the piazza and the faÃ§ades of the buildings facing it Michelangelo designed at this time. The new added to the Palazzo Senatorio was begun in 1544 and finished in 1552. Â\n\n♦Improving the Corso and Via del Condotti. Pope Paul III continued to improve the which into the city from the He also widened and straightened the which intersects the Corso.\n\n♦Enlarging Piazza San Marco. Paul III enlarged the which was located beside the Â\n\n♦Enlarging Piazza Farnese.

Pope Paul continued construction of the in Rome, which Antonio da Sangallo and worked on for over thirty years. After Antonio's death, the pope appointed Michelangelo to continue in his place. Michelangelo changed the design of the using a far larger one whose scale reflected the palace's immense size. In the same vein, he enlarged the window over the making it more emphatic and ornate. In the courtyard, Michelangelo modified Antonio's three stories of by and inserting Â\n\nArt Commissions\n\n♦Cellini coins and medals.
