This document provides background context on the time period surrounding Ignatius of Loyola's life from 1450-1550. It describes the corrupt state of the Catholic Church during this era, with 12 popes accused of abuse of money and power for personal gain. Many fathered illegitimate children and advanced nepotism. This corrupt environment shaped the world Ignatius was born into as he sought to reform the Church.",
