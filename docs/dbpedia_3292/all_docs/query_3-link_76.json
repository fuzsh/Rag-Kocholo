The nephew of King Philip II of Spain, the Duke of Parma (1546-1592) distinguished himself at the battle of Lepanto in 1571, going on to lead Spanish forces against the Dutch revolt in the Netherlands. He was Governor-General of the Spanish Netherlands from 1578. He was due to command the Spanish army in the invasion of England planned in 1588, but the invasion was abandoned after the Armada was defeated. In 1590 he was sent to France where he successfully relieved the Siege of Paris.
