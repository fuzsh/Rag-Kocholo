        "text": "IN Italy, motorists of an older generation still trade stories about driving, two decades or more ago, from Rome to Florence. They recall the sometimes dramatic struggle over the Radicofani pass, then the relief of arrival in Siena, knowing the worst was behind them. And, more serenely, they reminisce about the first part of the journey, winding along the Via Cassia through the towns of Lazio: Sutri, Vetralla, Viterbo, Montefiascone, Acquapendente: Etruscan land. Compared to subsequent, colorful Tuscany, those towns have a dark, even grim aura. Their past as fortresses seems to leave its mark on the present.\n\nNow, with the advent of the A1, the all-too-convenient Autostrada del Sole, the Via Cassia has become a secondary road, and those sober, gray towns belong to a little-known backwater. If you want to visit them, you have to make a special effort, go out of your way. But, as the French guidebooks used to decree, they are ''worth the detour.'' And one of the most rewarding - now less than an hour off the superhighway - remains the little town of Bagnaia, with the graceful, beautifully-kept Villa Lante and its magnificent gardens, a late Renaissance creation that offers a perfect respite from the grinding tension of heavy Italian traffic.\n\nAt first sight, Bagnaia might also seem dark and gloomy, like its neighbor-towns. But if you turn your back on the stern, medieval cylindrical tower dominating the main square and walk a few hundred feet up a slightly rising lane of small, ancient houses, you arrive at the front gate of the villa. This gate is not used nowadays, but it is still a good place to begin your visit. Pressing your face between the bars, you can grasp in a single view the chief features of the garden.\n\nDirectly in front of you, just inside the gate, is a flat, square parterre with the most formal part of the garden. This is usually called the Italian garden, and part of it does feature the abstract, geometric boxwood shapes outlining the gravel paths of the classic giardino all'italiana. But, on either side, these severe shapes give way to more fanciful green volutes and curlicues, reflecting an 18th-century French taste, imported by a Lante duchess, niece of the King of France.\n\nIn the center of this formal garden stands the forceful fountain of the Four Moors, four naked black males supporting a coat of arms. This fountain is often, erroneously, attributed to Giambologna (who died before it was made); other scholars have pointed out a stylistic relationship with the Fountain of the Turtles in Rome, but its sculptor - Landini - was also dead by the time the fountain was made. In any case, the lithe and elegant sculptures make an ideal focus for the parterre.\n\nBeyond them, on a perfect axis, you see the upper part of the garden: a hill has been tamed over many decades by gardeners and architects, who fitted the space into a pattern. Crisscrossing steps rise to the upper terrace, as a ''chain of water,'' a descending series of little basins and rivulets, glistens in the sun like silver. The chain continues until it meets the large basin of the Giants' Fountain. Today the impetus of the water is less than in the Renaissance, when, according to contemporary accounts, the chain was more violent; but even now it makes its impact, especially when seen from a distance.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
