        "text": "The films of Quentin Tarantino are not exactly known for his use of puppies and daffodils. Indeed, leaning more towards the ear-slicing, head-exploding end of the spectrum than that which makes Disney so much money has, along with dementedly funny dialogue and pop-culture references, become something of a trademark for the director. But having not directed a movie since Jackie Brown in 1997, Tarantino's lust for flying claret has mounted up and will, according to Lucy Liu, turn more than a few stomachs when Kill Bill reaches our screens. \"It's so violent,\" she told press in Beijing while promoting Charlie's Angels 2. \"People will leave the movie theatre or get sick in the movie theatre. There's so much violence that it becomes not numbing, but almost comedic. There's a scene where there's so much violence that the colour of the film goes into black and white, so that the blood looks like oil. It's cinematic; it's art.\" From the man who put Michael Madsen into audiences' nightmares and had John Travolta stab a four-inch needle into Uma Thurman's heart, you can bet that Liu isn't exaggerating either. But don't be put off seeing what's sure to be a quality film by the odd severed limb. \"You can take it to a different level, and show what violence is in such a heightened manner that you don't think of it as violence anymore,\" says Liu. \"You think of it as a language.\" It's not mindless violence for the sake of it, it's art, see? Thanks to Dark Horizons."
