        "text": "Biography[]\n\nThomas \"Tommy\" Plympton was Beatrix Kiddo's fiancé.\n\nLife with Beatrix[]\n\nWhen Beatrix left her profession as an assassin after she discovered her pregnancy. After faking her death, she took an assumed name and moved to El Paso, Texas. She would later meet Tommy, an owner of an used record store. Beatrix put him under the pretense that she was carrying his child. After the pregnancy was announced, Tommy proposed to Beatrix, who accepted.\n\nWedding rehearsal[]\n\nDuring her and Tommy's wedding rehearsal, Bill appeared after having tracked her down. Bill agreed to be civil to Tommy and told Beatrix that if she truly wanted to marry Tommy, he would not intervene. Upon meeting Tommy, Bill was gracious and polite to him; even suggesting that he take the couple to dinner at his expense later in the evening to celebrate the wedding. Bill attended the wedding rehearsal, and was introduced as Beatrix's father (this was plausible given the age difference between Bill and Beatrix) to Tommy. Tommy suggested that Bill give Beatrix away at the wedding at which both Bill and Beatrix showed discomfort; but Beatrix covered the difficult moment. Of course, during the rehearsal, the chapel was put under siege when the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad interrupted, killing all the people in attendance. Tommy was one of the eight killed during the massacre."
