        "text": "It seems Quentin Tarantino and Miramax have patched up their differences after disagreeing over whether Uma Thurman should be replaced in Tarantino's forthcoming film Kill Bill. Charlie's Angels star Lucy Liu will now replace Thurman who had to drop out of the project because she was pregnant with her second child. Miramax originally rejected Tarantino's idea to use a replacement and wanted to work around Thurman. Tarantino, who had written the part especially for his Pulp Fiction star, was determined to go ahead with filming. Liu will now star alongside Warren Beatty in the noir thriller which will be Tarantino's first release since Jackie Brown in 1997.\n\nThe 10-year marriage of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman could be over as quickly as August 7 according to the entertainment site Peoplenews. The site claims Cruise's lawyers have filed papers with Los Angeles Superior Court in an attempt to settle the divorce before the issues of money, property and child custody raise their ugly heads. According to family law specialist Lynn Soodik: \"Tom is definitely sending a message to Nicole that the marriage is over and we are not reconciling.\" Cruise's spokesman confirmed that the actor, who is now dating his Vanilla Sky co-star Penelope Cruz, is keen to have the divorce finalised as soon as possible.\n\nTwice an Oscar winner Tom Hanks has joined the board of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, according to the BBC. Hanks was one of two governors elected to the actors' branch after the resignation of Gregory Peck, who chose not to fill out the remaining year of his three-year term. The election of Hanks to the board is a clear indication of his growing prominence in Hollywood. He was named as the actor with the most clout in this year's influential power list in Premiere magazine.\n\nElle Macpherson is expanding her acting repertoire by playing the battered wife of an American president in her next film First Victim. The Daily Mirror reports today that the former supermodel who has had patchy success as an actress will play a first lady who finds love in the arms of her husband's press secretary."
