        "text": "It turns out congratulations are in order for Neil Young and Daryl Hannah.\n\nThe \"Heart of Gold\" singer confirmed what was speculated back in August: the two lovebirds have tied the knot.\n\nYoung referred to the \"Kill Bill\" actress as his wife in a note shared to his website Wednesday about his '70s tune \"Ohio\".\n\n\"OHIO was written back in 1970 after seeing the cover of a magazine with a young girl kneeling beside her fallen friend,\" Young, 72, explained of the track. \"When the National Guard murdered four students at OHIO’s Kent State University for protesting the Vietnam War, it was a pivotal moment in our history. It was a pivotal moment for me.\n\n\"Today we see what we have become,” Young continued, building a case for gun reform. “With no real laws protecting us from guns, and with politicians supporting the NRA because the NRA supports them, we are not well represented. Today’s students are brave, demanding change in violent times.\n\n“We stand with them. They are us. We are them,\" he added. \"This has been going on for far too long. My wife Daryl and I put this video together for you to reflect on. Support the students. Support our children. They want protection. Not more guns.\"\n\nReports of a possible union started swirling months ago after congratulations for the longtime couple poured in on social media.\n\n\"Congratulations to Daryl Hannah and Neil Young on their wedding today,\" a guitarist named Mark Miller posted to Facebook. \"May they have a long and happy relationship.\"\n\nA photo Hannah, 57, posted to Instagram also raised suspicion.\n\n\"Yaaaaaaaaaaay in every sense. And so sorry not to be there. Love you ❤️❤️ \" posted CNN commentator Sally Kohn on the image.\n\nThe rock legend and Hannah have been together since at least 2014, when Young and his former wife, Pegi Young, split up after 36 years of marriage and two children.\n\nBy that point, People magazine reported, the two had been dating for months and didn't really hide it.\n\nHannah, a longtime political and environmental activist, has never been married but was in a relationship with another rock star, Jackson Browne, and with the late John F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nIn recent years, she's made a splash by getting arrested in anti-pipeline protests in Texas and in Washington, and by being among the scores of women who have accused shamed movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct.\n\nEarlier this year, Young and Hannah merged their professional and personal lives, when Young starred in Netflix's \"Paradox,\" a film written and directed by Hannah.\n\nContributing: Maria Puente"
