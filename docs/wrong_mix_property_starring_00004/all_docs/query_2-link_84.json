        "text": "Uma Thurman, star of Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, is a proud mother of three kids.\n\nShe and Ethan Hawke share two children – Levon and Maya Hawke – while Uma and Arpad Busson have a daughter named Luna.\n\nLevon joined his mother at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. He and his sister, Maya, are both actors, like their parents.\n\nUma Thurman has made a name for herself in Hollywood, proving she’s here for the long run. The actress is perhaps best known for her partnership with Quentin Tarantino, playing Mia Wallace in Pulp Fiction and The Bride in Kill Bill: Volume 1 and 2 (2003, 2004). In real life, however, perhaps her favorite role is mom to three kids.\n\nUma famously dated actor Ethan Hawke after they met while filming the 1997 movie Gattaca and they got married in 1998. They welcomed two children, Maya and Levon before divorcing in 2005. Uma then welcomed another daughter, Luna, in 2012 with her former fiance, financier Arpad Busson.\n\nUma attended the 2023 Cannes Film Festival and walked the red carpet on May 16, arriving to see Johnny Depp‘s new movie, Jeanne du Barry. Her son, Levon Thurman-Hawke, joined her. The 21-year-old looked just like his mother, with the same cheekbones and jawline. He also towered over his mother, which is no small feat since she’s 5’11.\n\nUma wore a pale pink Dior Haute Couture ballgown with a Chopard choker that matched her red satin overcoat. Levon wore a navy tuxedo, which he paired with patent leather shoes that shone in the flash of the photographer’s cameras.\n\nFind out more about Uma’s kids, from the oldest to youngest below.\n\nMaya Hawke\n\nFollowing in her mother’s footsteps is Maya Hawke, born July 8, 1998. After beginning her career modeling for various big names like Vogue, Calvin Klein, and AllSaints, she then made her on-screen debut in 2017 as Jo in the BBC adaptation of Little Women. Her breakout role, however, came as Robin — a worker at the mall’s Scoops Ahoy — in the third season of Stranger Things. She then went on to have a small part that same year in Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood — talk about really following in mom’s footsteps!\n\nHowever, Levon has a role in a handful of projects that were listed in post-production/completed in early 2023. One of them was the Zoe Kravitz-directed Pussy Island. “Frida is a young, clever, Los Angeles cocktail waitress who has her eyes set on the prize: philanthropist and tech mogul Slater King (Channing Tatum). When she skillfully maneuvers her way into King’s inner circle and ultimately an intimate gathering on his private island, she is ready for a journey of a lifetime. Despite the epic setting, beautiful people, ever-flowing champagne and late-night dance parties, Frida can sense that there’s more to this island than meets the eye. Something she can’t quite put her finger on. Something terrifying.”\n\nIn 2023, Maya became the latest starlet to appear in a Wes Anderson film, joining the ensemble cast of Asteroid City. She also joined her mother and Samuel L. Jackson in the Nicole Paone-directed The Kill Room. Maya also dipped her toes into the biopic world, playing Jamie Bernstein in 2023’s Maestro, Flannery O’Connor in Wildcat, and a “devoted Beatles fan” hoping to meet George Harrison in Revolver (a movie featuring her father, Ethan Hawke.)\n\nIn addition to continuing her acting career, Maya has also pursued a singing career, releasing two singles in 2019 and a debut album, Blush, in 2020.\n\nLevon Thurman-Hawke\n\nLevon Hawke was born in 2002. Levon is not only following in the footsteps of his famous actor parents but also his sister, as he joined the cast of Stranger Things for season 4. After behind-the-scenes photos were posted on social media ahead of the upcoming season in punk rock attire, rumors began to swirl about if Levon would appear on the show.\n\nMaya eventually shot down the rumors. “My brother is not in the show!” she told RadioTimes.com. “He came to visit me. The COVID policies were really intense, as they should be, so the only way he could come to set was if he was dressed as an extra and did COVID testing. And that was a day that the paparazzi were there, so they got a picture of him, and it was all: ‘Nepotism strikes again!’ Guys, no! He’s not in the show, but you may potentially see him once, in one shot. So, calm down, internet!”\n\nHowever, Levon has a role in a handful of projects that were listed in post-production/completed in early 2023. One of them was the Zoe Kravitz-directed Pussy Island. “Frida is a young, clever, Los Angeles cocktail waitress who has her eyes set on the prize: philanthropist and tech mogul Slater King (Channing Tatum). When she skillfully maneuvers her way into King’s inner circle and ultimately an intimate gathering on his private island, she is ready for a journey of a lifetime. Despite the epic setting, beautiful people, ever-flowing champagne and late-night dance parties, Frida can sense that there’s more to this island than meets the eye. Something she can’t quite put her finger on. Something terrifying.”\n\nLevon is also interested in fashion. He notably joined his mom in 2018 and 2019 on the front row of Prada’s resort shows in New York City and also the 2020 Dior couture show in Paris, reported Vogue India.\n\nLuna Thurman-Busson\n\nLuna was born in 2012 when Uma was dating Apnad (the pair dated from 2007 to 2009 and were together again from 2011 to 2014). Uma likes to keep her youngest daughter somewhat way from the spotlight, as not much is known about the little one. Unfortunately, what the public may have heard about Luna the most during Uma and Arpad’s brutal custody battle a few years back."
