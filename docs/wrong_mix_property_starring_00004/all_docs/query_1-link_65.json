        "text": "OK, so from what I gather from IMDB, it's basically one long movie that's being released in two parts in the theater? Bah. I'm not a huge fan of Tarantino, I might see this one if the response is good here.\n\nThis made me laugh (from the IMDB message boards for Kill Bill: Volume 2):\n\nhas anyone heard how they will release the movie on dvd i mean supposibly i suspect that they will release kill bill 1 on dvd probally after kill bill volume 2 comes out i mean i dont think that they will release them together just becasue miramax are a bunch of a holes.\n\nAny one else hear how they release it i mean like they do a special edition with both parts on 1 dvd or will they wait a while for that.\n\nOriginally posted by: JimRaynor\n\nI'm a big fan of some of the stuff that Tarantino has done, but this kill bill thing sounds kind of weird. I disagree with some of the casting... Uma Thurman as a samurai broad?? Lucy Liu??? *sigh*\n\nI thought Lucy Liu was the samurai thing (which is not possible since only men can be samurai in japanese culture, just because you play with swords dont make you a samurai).\n\nOriginally posted by: Zim Hosein\n\nOriginally posted by: JimRaynor\n\nI'm a big fan of some of the stuff that Tarantino has done, but this kill bill thing sounds kind of weird.
