        "text": "She wants to belong to her culture and felt that if she could impress Liu with her presence she would have this false sense of belonging to her own Chinese culture. From the moment she met Liu she was instantly intrigued by little body movements she had seen or the way she spoke. When conversing with Mrs. Liu Mackenzie felt like she could belong to her Chinese culture. Mrs. Liu entails “You born with it, inside you understand it. In here” (935).\n\nNevertheless, Asian-American stars are recognized extremely played prototypical roles offered to them – model minority, sexualized the female or masculine women. There is much argument within the Asian American community whether to consider Liu as a protagonist or a hateful. In playing highlighting sexuality roles such as Ling Woo on Ally McBeal, a role who is a ‘self-described “tramp” … simultaneously addicted to casual sex and uses sex to have her way with men’ (Goldsea.com 2008). Is she bolstering the sexploitation of Asian females, or is she an Asian image who plays her strong points? Moreover, there are already some problems in the critical writing as to whether Liu is to be considered an action star or an actor. Some argues that, in Charlie’s Angels\n\nFrom TV to film to animation, Taraji P Henson has had a diversity of experience that is rarely highlighted or spoken of yet is a testament to her commitment to acting.. Despite that fact she remains humble and hungry in a craft that is fleeting. She remains relevant and poise to continue into the future despite the ageism that plague female actresses. Taraji believes that love is the key to being successful. Do what you love and the rest is lagniappe. I pray to have her attitude and\n\nAn example of when the actress’s’ characterization was particularly effective was towards the end, during the scene of Mickey &amp; Edwards death, when she revealed to them, they were brothers. When she did this, her eyes welled up with tears, her voice trembled and her body convulsed; my eyes were fixed on her. I believed her, so much that I began to feel great sympathy for her. She was able to portray an emotion, and cause it to the same emotion, to be evoked by the audience.\n\nIdentity; Romance; Segregation; Beauty; Friendship; Within the film industry’s classic interpretation of female adolescents, these elements of teen culture are typically represented. A film’s demonstration of themes such as relationship tensions or social status struggles are that which attracts the popular viewership of female adolescents, for they are personally dealing with similar experiences. Furthermore, in continually representing the aforementioned traditional elements of teen culture, the film industry seems to make it so films’ story-lines and characterizations adapt to and directly reflect the era in which the film is set. This adaptation is significantly demonstrated in the popular teen films The Breakfast Club (1985), Clueless (1995), and Mean Girls (2004) as they each clearly and diversely characterize young women based on the distinct time period and the cultural attitude towards teen girls of that time. The Breakfast Club (1985) details five high school students in Illinois, a nerd, a jock, a bad boy, a weirdo, and a\n\nThe text After the First Death by Robert Cormier and the film V for Vendetta directed by James McTigue represent terrorism in ways that allow us as the audience to respond differently to each. The terrorists, V in V for Vendetta and Artkin in After the First Death both perform terrorising actions; however, I sympathise and correspond with V but consider the opposite for Artkin. V is seen as a revolutionary as he has a considerate and rational mind, he eradicates only those who commit immoral deeds to the society. In contrast, Artkin is presented as an emotionless killing machine able to murder without remorse. Thus, I feel hatred and fear towards Artkin, although both terrorists share similar motives. The terrorists are masked to hide their identities; however, we perceive them to have different ideas. Both terrorists use violence to present their ideas of anarchy, I understand V’s motive is to prevail justice for the people, therefore, deem his actions as necessary, whereas Artkin is willing to murder innocence to acquire freedom. After the First Death and V for Vendetta, both portray that terrorism has unseen motives and ideas, which make me as an audience question whether terrorism benefits or destroys the society.\n\nProfessional acting experience includes a recurring, supporting role on season two of “Veronica’s Blog” which aired on KBCW as well as The Filipino Channel. Additional professional experience includes supporting roles in independent films as well as featured background roles for a variety of television shows including Murder in the First (TNT), Sense8 (Netflix), and When We Rise (ABC), as well as featured background roles in a variety of commercials. Non-professional experience includes over ten years of theater experience with the most recent roles of Abigail Williams in the Crucible and Ariel Moore in Footloose.\n\nChristmas is recognized by the general public as a time to celebrate family and give gifts. Which it is, but gifts can go way deeper than physical objects. This is exhibited in a book, The Greatest Gift, and a movie, It’s a Wonderful Life. In 1943, Philip Van Doren Stern wrote the Greatest Gift. It tells the tale of George, a person who is about to kill himself but is then shown what the world would be like without him and realizes he shouldn’t kill himself. Unable to find a publisher for it, Philip put the story on his Christmas cards and mailed them to friends. A couple of his publisher friends thoroughly enjoyed it and made the move to publish it in a newspaper. This caught the attention of film director Frank Capra. He decided to fill in\n\nThe beginning of The Notebook opens with the gentleman, Noah in a nursing home facility. We soon learn that he is living at the facility to be close to his wife, Allie who has Alzheimer’s. Allie is introduced to Noah, and he offers to read her a story. They are in the sunroom at the nursing home, and unbeknownst to her he begins to read her a love story. Due to Allie’s disease she is unaware that the story she is listening to is her own read by her true love. Noah begins to share about the summer romance that began one night in the 1940’s at a carnival. We see Allie and Noah fall madly in love only to be torn apart by her parents that do not believe he is worthy of their daughter because of his place in society. Allie’s parents take her away from the love of her life to focus on school, and to find a socially acceptable husband for their daughter. Noah cannot forget Allie so easily and writes to her everyday for a year. When he doesn’t hear back from her we see them both move on with their lives.\n\nI've done my movie comparisons on Stomp the Yard which was made in 2007 and on the movie Frat Brothers which was made in 2013. It is the minority that is going to be described. The stereotypes in the movie include how people depict African American fraternities as dangerous, a waste of time, and a sure way to lower one's GPA.These films both display and explain characteristics of being in an African American fraternity, however one movie explains African American greek life from a more sterotypical point of view while the other film explains things from more of an actual and realistic point of view. The first thing to point out is the name of the films. One film, Stomp the Yard is about how one student who was very musically and dance inclined showed off his skills in a talent show and eventually became an aspirant for\n\nIn all the stories that have come to be known none of them have broken from the foretold path. They all draw on the same element or at least a few to achieve a greater level of connection with the audience. The best stories say they are alive, polarized, catharsis, invoke the wisdom of the body, and always trust the path. For Hoodwinked, Little Evil, and Meet the Robinsons there is no difference, they each play along to the audience so that they may continue to live and grow.\n\nIt is my intention to compare the book, Dangerous Liaisons by Choderlos de Laclos, to its modern movie version, Cruel Intentions starring Sarah Michelle Gellar. I intend to examine how the original French text was modified in reference to plot, character, morals/values, and themes. I also plan to discuss how these transformations change the meaning of the story and reflect different cultural/historical contexts. There are some major differences between these two works, if only because of when they were written.\n\nShe wears the same type of cloths, has the same hair do and her rather eccentric attitude to life also corresponds to that of her French counterpart. The primary function of the traditional Hong Kong film industry was to churn out movies aimed at the general public and make sure that they bring in a profit. This is much like the French film industry was before the emergence of the French New Wave."
