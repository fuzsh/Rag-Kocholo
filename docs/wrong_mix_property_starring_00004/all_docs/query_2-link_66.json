        "text": "While the investigation over David Carradine's mysterious death in a Bangkok hotel room continues, one of the \"Kill Bill\" star's ex-wives reflected on her life with him in a new interview with Access Hollywood.\n\n\"There was a dark side to David, there was a very intense side to David,\" Marina Anderson, who was married to the star for six years, told Access. \"People around him know that.\"\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: A Look Back: David Carradine\n\nDavid was reportedly found hanging naked in his hotel room closet, in what has been described as a possible accidental death from autoerotic asphyxiation.\n\nAnd in her divorce papers, posted on TheSmokingGun.com last week, Marina alleged that David had conducted dangerous sex acts during their marriage.\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: Hollywood Legends\n\n\"It was the continuation of abhorrent and deviant sexual behavior which was potentially deadly,\" the papers, filed in 2003, alleged. \"His deviate behavior includes an incestuous relationship with a very close family member, which permeated our marriage. This is to his admission and the admission of the person involved.\"\n\nMarina — who was David's fourth wife — would not comment on the allegations to Access, except to say that she stood by the paperwork.\n\n\"That was never meant to get out,\" she said. \"All I can say is that I hold by my document.\"\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: Surprising Former Couples\n\nInstead, Marina wanted to remember happier times with her ex.\n\n\"I have great memories of him, in spite of other stuff,\" she said. \"The most fun we had was away from everybody, away from Hollywood. That was just heaven.\"\n\nAsked if it was a love-hate relationship, she said, \"It was never hate.\"\n\n\"It was more hurt than ever hate,\" she said. \"I don't go there, especially not with him.\"\n\nAs his manager, she helped steer him toward his role in Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill\" films, which helped introduce him to a new generation and led to a full slate of film work in the following years. At the time of his death, he was filming \"Stretch\" and had several more projects lined – something Marina said would have satisfied the star.\n\n\"He was his happiest when he worked,\" she said, adding that the actor also pursued music and designed jewelry for her.\n\n\"Our favorite song was 'Rain or Shine' and he would just sit at the piano and sing it for me to cheer me up,\" she said.\n\nMarina is working on a book about her life, and while she's writing about David, she promised it wouldn't be a tell-all.\n\n\"The book… was for me, it was my healing,\" she said, adding that it may still shed some light on the mysterious star. \"There is truth in there, yeah. He liked to keep people on the edge and you know, in mystery.\"\n\nRelated Content from AccessHollywood.com:\n\nPLAY IT NOW: What Caused David Carradine's Death?\n\nPLAY IT NOW: Remembering David Carradine"
