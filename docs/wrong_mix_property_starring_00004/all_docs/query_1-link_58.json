(AP) Actress Lucy Liu is being honored at Harvard for her humanitarian work.\n\nThe \"Kill Bill\" and \"Charlie's Angels\" actress, currently starring in the CBS series \"Elementary,\" was named 2016 artist of the year by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations.\n\nShe's scheduled to receive the award Saturday evening in a presentation at the Cultural Rhythms Festival at Sanders Theater in Cambridge.\n\nBorn to immigrant parents in the New York City borough of Queens, Liu is a UNICEF Ambassador and has been a spokeswoman for the Human Rights Campaign. Harvard says she's \"worked tirelessly to raise awareness of the plight of women and children in some of the world's most impoverished countries.\"\n\nPrevious Harvard Foundation winners have included Eva Longoria, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, Denzel Washington and Salma Hayek."
