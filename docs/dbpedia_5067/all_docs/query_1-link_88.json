        "text": "STATE COLLEGE — While many Penn State Lady Lion basketball fans may be familiar with the iconic Pink Zone game, the nonprofit organization’s fight against breast cancer spans beyond the annual game to provide support to those in the community affected by breast cancer.\n\nPennsylvania Pink Zone started in 2007 as a basketball game funded by a grant from the Big Ten. The Penn State women’s basketball team hosted and beat the Wisconsin Badgers during the game. The event raised more than $20,000.\n\n“Our mission is to assist breast cancer patients and survivors throughout Centre County in many ways and to empower people to fight and treat breast cancer,” Patricia Fulvio, the executive director at Pink Zone, remarked.\n\nPink Zone partners with different local, regional and national organizations to further its mission. According to data from the organization, Pink Zone has raised more than $3.2 million for partner organizations since 2007.\n\nAccording to Pink Zone, one in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer in their lifetime. The impact of a diagnosis can be felt in many ways, including the mental and financial burdens patients face.\n\n“They call it the financial toxicity of cancer,” Fulvio explained. “And unless you’re in the battle, you don’t really understand what that means. Besides the medical expenses, which are definitely great, there are your daily expenses, which often become overwhelming because you either stop working or you work a lot less because of the treatment or because you have to be in treatment so much of the time.”\n\nFulvio continued to note that this financial toxicity can cause people to fall behind on things like bills, rent, mortgages and utilities. To help combat this financial strain, Pink Zone started a direct support fund that assists people by covering nonmedical bills for them.\n\nFulvio explained that families and people with cancer are 260% more likely to declare bankruptcy than families who have never experienced cancer.\n\n“If you’re stressing about how you’re going to pay your mortgage or that you’re going to get evicted, it’s very hard to comply with all that has to go on for your treatment,” Fulvio said. “We’re trying to alleviate that a bit so that people can concentrate more on their wellness and getting well.”\n\nThe Pink Zone game itself is a beloved Penn State tradition. With the Lady Lions decked out in their all-pink gear, Fulvio remarked how moving the camaraderie of the annual event is.\n\n“People come back year after year and they connect with other people who have gone through the same fight they have and those who have survived it and come out the other side,” she said.\n\nFulvio explained that the event is also a sentimental and moving time not only for the spectators but for the players and coaches involved as well.\n\nThere are numerous ways to support Pink Zone and its cause. In addition to donating, Fulvio noted that buying a ticket and coming out to the Pink Zone game is a great way to get involved. Additionally, the organization welcomes volunteers to help out.\n\n“A game like that requires a huge number of volunteers, so you can help that way,” Fulvio said. “You can help out by being a volunteer. Just by talking about us and being an ambassador for us helps because there are people who don’t know Pink Zone exists.”\n\nFulvio also noted that registering to play in the Pink Zone Golf Tournament on Monday, Oct. 7, is another way to support the mission.\n\nFor more information about Pink Zone, donating and events, go to papinkzone.org."
