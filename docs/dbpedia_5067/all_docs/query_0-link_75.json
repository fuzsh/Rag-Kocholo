Collaborating with Pink Hope to create an exclusive lipstick for Bright Pink Lipstick Day through her newly launched brand LUMA by Jess Hart cosmetics, Jess has revealed she’s not only Hart by name but also ‘heart’ by nature.\n\nJess is joined by her sister Ashley Hart as well as other celebrities including Jesinta Campbell, Lisa Wilkinson, Laura Csortan, Natalie Gruzlewski, Kyly Clarke, Elle and Tash from They all hate Us and Nicole Trunfio. Each have garnered the support of a close family member or friend to pucker up on the 26th of September and make their pout count, while also donating their time to be the faces of this year’s advertising campaign for Bright Pink Lipstick Day.\n\nPink Hope lipstick – LUMA by Jess Hart will be sold exclusively through Priceline stores nationwide or online at www.pinkhope.org.au for RRP $19.95 with all proceeds going to the Pink Hope charity.\n\n*Also, please be sure to get involved and share your bright pink pout on social media too and tag @PinkHopeAus #BrightPinkLipstickDay #lumabyjesshart. Help us raise awareness and get BPLD trending!"
