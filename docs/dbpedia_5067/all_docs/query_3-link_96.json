        "text": "Cancer ribbons are used to raise awareness about specific cancers such as lung, breast, and prostate cancers. People wear these ribbons to show support for those facing a specific cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe well-known breast cancer ribbon is pink, but others are less common, like the teal ribbon for ovarian cancer. In fact, there are more than 50 cancer ribbons that represent individual cancers as well as related issues such as support for cancer caregivers and bone marrow transplants.\n\nThis article explains which colors are used for which types of cancers and the months associated with raising awareness for specific cancers.\n\nBuilding Awareness With Ribbon Colors\n\nSome well-known cancer ribbons include the pink ribbon for breast cancer and the purple ribbon for pancreatic cancer. In addition to ribbons, advocacy groups have set aside specific months dedicated to awareness of specific types of cancer. During these months, ribbons are often worn more frequently by individuals.\n\nSome groups have successfully had prominent organizations adopt the ribbon colors. For instance, sports teams may wear pink jerseys in October to call attention to breast cancer.\n\nBreast Cancer Ribbon: Pink\n\nThe pink ribbon, today so quickly identified as a symbol in the fight against breast cancer, was first introduced during the 1990s as part of the Susan G. Komen New York City Race for the Cure.\n\nBreast cancer survivors often don the ribbon or iterations of it on t-shirts, hats, bumper stickers, and even tattoos. Healthcare professionals and those working for a cure and awareness also use the ribbon to encourage screening for the disease.\n\nThe second most common cancer after skin cancer, breast cancer is diagnosed in more than 290,000 people each year. Thanks to early detection and better treatments, though, survival rates are improving.\n\nProstate Cancer Ribbon: Light Blue\n\nAbout 14.7% of all new cancer diagnoses in the United States are for prostate cancer. However, this type of cancer is talked about far less than other cancers that occur less frequently. That's at least partially because men are less likely to want to discuss their prostate cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe light blue ribbon was designed to bring attention to this disease that can often be successfully treated and has a five-year survival rate of 98%.\n\nLung Cancer Ribbon: Pearl or White\n\nAs the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, a lung cancer diagnosis can be especially frightening. A pearl or white ribbon then seems an appropriate sign of hope for those fighting the disease, supporting loved ones, and working to find a cure. Ribbons as well as other items, such as pearl jewelry or white clothing, are sometimes worn as a way to build awareness of lung cancer.\n\nA goal of many people and organizations is to create an understanding that those with lung cancer are not to be blamed for their disease. While lung cancer is associated with smoking, that does not mean that those who smoked and now suffer should be forgotten. In addition, more than half of the people diagnosed with lung cancer are former smokers or people who have never smoked.\n\nColon Cancer: Dark Blue\n\nColon cancer, often referred to as colorectal cancer, is the fourth most common cancer in the United States, and it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. When the disease is diagnosed in the early stages, it has a 90% survival rate; however, the prognosis becomes worse if the cancer isn't caught until it's spread to surrounding tissue and lymph nodes.\n\nThe dark blue ribbon that represents colon cancer awareness is often used in conjunction with efforts to encourage regular screening among those who have no symptoms but are over age 45. A colonoscopy is often recommended to identify polyps and remove them before they turn into cancer.\n\nPancreatic Cancer: Purple\n\nWhile pancreatic cancer is uncommon, it ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. This is because it is often not diagnosed until the disease is fairly advanced.\n\nPancreatic cancer awareness, including wearing purple ribbons, consists of encouraging those at risk to be screened. If you have a close genetic relative with the disease or if you know you have certain genetic disorders, it's recommended that you get genetic testing for pancreatic cancer. Talk to your doctor about your risk and possible screenings.\n\nOvarian Cancer: Teal\n\nOvarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer among people with ovaries worldwide. You're most at risk if you're postmenopausal although genetic factors, fertility problems, and endometriosis also seem to increase the chances of developing ovarian cancer.\n\nBecause this cancer may not present with any symptoms in the early stages, the best way to ensure an early diagnosis is to get regular pelvic exams. Diagnosis can also be achieved through transvaginal ultrasound and blood tests.\n\nThe use of teal ribbons and special events each September bring awareness to the need for these regular check-ups and to support those who have been diagnosed.\n\nSkin Cancer: Black\n\nThe most prevalent cancer in the United States, skin cancer affects an estimated 3.3 million people. A black ribbon represents awareness for all types of skin cancer, but some subtypes use their own colors.\n\nThere are three main types:\n\nMelanoma, which is represented by a black ribbon as well\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma, which uses a red and white ribbon\n\nBasal cell carcinoma, which uses an orange ribbon\n\nBrain Cancer: Gray\n\nThere are two types of brain cancer: one originates in the brain and the other has spread to the brain from another part of the body. There is a wide variety of types of tumors that can develop in the brain. The type of tumor, location, and whether or not it originated in the brain determines how it is treated.\n\nGray ribbons are worn to show support for survivors and those who have brain cancer. Fundraisers and awareness events are often held in May.\n\nHow Many Cancer Ribbon Colors Are There?\n\nThere are 57 common cancer ribbon colors. While some cancer ribbons are well-known, others are often only worn by a select group of supporters. However, there is a great need to draw attention to all types of cancers. Here is a directory of the different ribbon colors used to promote awareness for different diagnoses and the months traditionally set aside for those groups."
