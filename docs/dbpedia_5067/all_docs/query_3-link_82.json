        "text": "Since that time, the coach has helped screen more than 1,200 individuals, catching cancer in seven of them. In fact, one survivor, whose last mammogram was in 2012, said that the only reason she received her mammogram this year was because the coach visited her corporation. It was “too convenient” to turn down a screening. Her cancer was caught inside the coach, and today she’s doing well.\n\nThe coach, which was designed to reach the underserved and the busy workforce, was made possible through a partnership between Methodist and Susan G. Komen Great Plains, an organization that is so much more than the color pink.\n\nIn an effort to better illustrate the mission and vision of the organization, one of its showcase events has changed names. The Susan G. Komen Race for The Cure® is now the Susan G. Komen MORE THAN PINK WALK™, but the focus remains the same: bringing together survivors, their loved ones and the loved ones of those who have lost their battles.\n\nThe event, which is no longer a run, represents the vast majority of participation. The 1-mile walk, which will follow several activities and experiences inside the University of Nebraska Omaha’s Baxter Arena (2425 S 67th St.), is aimed at providing a greater sense of community and a more personalized experience among participants.\n\nParticipating this year? Here’s what you can expect:\n\nRace Day: Oct. 6, 2019 at UNO’s Baxter Arena\n\nRegistration – 6 a.m. (south entrance of arena)\n\nHope Village (Survivor) Photo – 8:45 a.m.\n\nOpening Ceremony – 9:15 a.m.\n\n1-Mile Walk – 9:30 a.m.\n\nA variety of tents will be set up on the arena floor. Participants can expect to view breast cancer cells through microscopes as well as mannequins displaying breast cancer’s migration in the body. They can also write postcards to family, friends and elected officials.\n\nA larger space, set up away from the busier tents, will let people honor and remember those who have died from the disease.\n\nVendors and sponsors will set up on the arena’s upper-level concourse. Participants are encouraged to stop by the Methodist booth and sign the banner honoring the person(s) they’re walking for.\n\nDon’t forget: Your participation and donations go toward research, outreach and awareness in the fight against breast cancer."
