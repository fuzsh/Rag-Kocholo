        "text": "Jamie Haight\n\nIn 2015, I heard the words no one wants to hear, you have breast cancer. A friend recommended I set a goal to do when I was done with treatment. I picked Pledge the Pink, although at that time it was still LoCo Motion at that time. I have been a member of the flock since 2016! Once Fancy gets ahold of you she doesn’t let you go. I am honored to be a board member of an organization that fights for a cause close to my heart and has fun accomplishing our goals! My breast cancer was found early through my annual mammogram. The fact that Pledge the Pink provides assistance to women needing mammograms hits home!\n\nTreasurer\n\nNancy Shaw\n\nMy Pledge the Pink journey started in 2017 when I participated in my first PTP event. I had no idea what I was about to be a part of. There’s no way to adequately describe the spirit and unity that truly IS Pledge the Pink! I Love everything about this organization and its mission to provide breast cancer screening, treatment, and outreach programs to often underserved populations and support research in an effort to find a cure for breast cancer. It is such an absolute honor to be asked to serve on the Pledge the Pink Foundation Board and I am committed to help fund organizations that contribute to the very important mission we are on.\n\nPresident\n\nRenee Adamowicz\n\nI moved to HHI full time in 2018. I had just finished becoming a warrior – a survivor of breast cancer. I needed something to fill my soul. I was lucky to find this great organization PLEDGE THE PINK, and I volunteered for their big event: a 30-mile walk – 10 miles a day for three days on different islands and locations in SC. That first year I stood alone in the early morning dark as a volunteer as they called the survivors up to start the walk, I burst into tears as I looked around and saw all these women who have survived, I had sorrow and HOPE. I continued to volunteer, and in 2022 I walked for my “5 years clear” along with my three best friends who were also touched by breast cancer. We laughed and we cried. I was proud to commit to this challenge and a great cause. Now I am honored to be a team member on the board of Pledge the Pink Foundation, and I look forward to supporting other warrior sisters and give to those who need our support and awareness with their own battles!\n\nVice President/Secretary"
