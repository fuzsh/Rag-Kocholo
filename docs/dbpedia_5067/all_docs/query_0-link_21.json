        "text": "Notable characteristics: Well formed, anemone, double blossoms are produced in abundance on this robust grower. Flowers are held upright on strong stems, though some additional support is ideal for landscape use. Colors in the center of the flower change from yellow to white, in contrast to the pink petals.\n\nWe are excited to offer this new hybrid herbaceous peony for the first time. This is a plant which we have observed and propagated in the nursery for more than a decade. It is an open-pollinated seedling.\n\nThis plant, 'Hope's Star of Heaven', is named in memory of a person who took great pleasure in their garden. The name references a line in Rumi's poem, 'You and I', a touching and vivid expression of the love which can fill our lives.\n\nThe stars of heaven will come out to watch us,\n\nAnd we will show them\n\nthe light of a full moon –\n\nyou and I.\n\n— Excerpted from Rumi's, 'You and I' (version by Jonathan Star, from a translation by Shahram Shiva)\n\n“A Garden Beyond Paradise: The Mystical Poetry of Rumi” Bantam Books, 1992. Read the full poem here.\n\nCultivar group, hybridizer and year introduced: Peony Heaven hybrid, new introduction, to be registered with the American Peony Society.\n\nGrowth habit and size at maturity: Upright, grows to 3.5' tall and 3' wide. Very good stem strength.\n\nFlower form and size: Anemone double, 4-5\" and upward facing. Excellent variety for landscape planting or cut flowers.\n\nFlower fragrance: Light, sweet.\n\nBloom time: Mid-season hybrid peony, blooms in our USDA zone 6a garden in the last week of May or 1st week of June."
