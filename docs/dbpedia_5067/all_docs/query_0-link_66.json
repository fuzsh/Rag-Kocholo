        "text": "Karen Page’s endless enthusiasm has always amazed her friends in the tennis community.\n\nHer relentless spirit in the wake of a fight with breast cancer astounds them.\n\nChemotherapy treatments have tired the long-time tennis coach, who is known for her 32 years of work at DeWitt Tennis Center, Hope College and West Ottawa High School. Yet despite a reduced schedule, Page is out there coaching.\n\nShe will lead the Flying Dutch into their regular-season home finale against Adrian College at 3 p.m. today at the courts located at 13th and Columbia streets.\n\n“I have two big ones left,” Page said of her chemotherapy treatments. “It’s starting to take a toll. Mondays are my big day. I do travel team, two Hope classes, then practice. I can’t do the mornings anymore. It’s too tiring. I know I’m not my total self.”\n\nYou wouldn’t know it by talking to Page or watching her on the tennis court.\n\nShe’s still the same exciteable coach who’s loves to see others succeed, whether it be winning a match or learning how to play tennis itself.\n\nShe’s still the same passionate coach who makes you love the game just by being around her.\n\nShe’s still the same caring coach who’s patient whether you’re a top-notch player or a novice.\n\nHope tennis player Danielle Werley, a sophomore from Holland High School, said Page inspires the Flying Dutch as much as they’re trying to do for her.\n\n“She’s always cheering us on. She’s always ready to go no matter what,” said Werley, who plays No. 3 singles for the Flying Dutch. “It boosts everybody’s morale having her being excited about us. That keeps us motivated to help her.”\n\nBoth the Hope men’s and women’s tennis have dedicated their seasons to Page. They both surprised her during their spring break trip to Hilton Head, S.C., last month, donning pink Hope T-shirts together before a match.\n\nPink is the color the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation uses in its battle against the disease that is expected to be newly diagnosed in an estimated 182,460 women in 2008. Hope’s Student-Athlete Advisory Committee raised $1,364 for the Komen Foundation in Page’s name during a women’s basketball game in February.\n\nPage has coached the women’s tennis team at Hope for 11 years. She recently gave up coaching the girls tennis team at West Ottawa because of the high school season changes that moved girls tennis in the spring, which is the same time as her college season.\n\nTiger Teusink, Page’s friend and a long-time tennis coach in Holland, is impressed with how Page has dealt with her bout with breast cancer.\n\n“Cancer is an ugly thing. My wife has it,” Teusink said. “It is very stressful to be a coach, then to add this. ... Karen is really doing a fantastic job. She has battled this with a very positive attitude.”\n\nSome wonder where Page gets her strength.\n\nThey know it’s exhausting dealing with the treatment of breast cancer alone. They know it’s tiring to deal with the mental strain from such a health fight.\n\nPage admits she gets help from a lot of places.\n\n“With the strength I get from God, my team and all my supporters,” Page said. “I don’t know. That’s just me. I have a positive attitude.\n\n“I’m going to win this battle.”"
