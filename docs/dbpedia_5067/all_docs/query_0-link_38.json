        "text": "A chopper hovered over the Turf Valley Golf club and dropped hundreds of golf balls onto the green Thursday morning.\n\nThe person whose ball lands closest to the pin wins $2,000 and the furthest wins $500.\n\nALSO READ |\n\nThis is a first-time event at our Pink Greens Golf Tournament, said Vera Simmons, Executive Director in a news release. We always have a lot of fun at this event, with this yearâ€™s theme centered around pirates, matey. We thought this would be a fun addition to something people really enjoy each year anyway. After all, hundreds of golf balls dropping from a helicopter is a sight to be seen!\n\nBlossoms of Hope is known for the 2,900 cherry, redbud, and dogwood trees that bloom each year in Howard County as well as the more than the $800,000 it has donated to local nonprofits in the county including the Claudia Mayer/Tina Broccolino Cancer Resource Center; Gilchrist Hospice; Ellicott City Partnership, Zaching Against Cancer, Respite Retreats, Bright Minds, ARC, Community Schools Program, and Camp Attaway, to name a few.\n\nThe Pink Greens Golf Tournament is one of five events Blossoms of Hope holds each year to raise fund for our community support and individual programs, said Simmons in a news release. Pink Greens, which will begin right after the helicopter drop, is always fun with participants encouraged to dress to the theme and have a fun day in addition to a great golfing experience.\n\nTwo new initiatives this year include a countywide art show and Seeds of Hope, a program that invests in the well-being of Howard County, fostering community resilience, and addressing mental health challenges through education, awareness, collaboration, and support for local institutions.\n\nALSO READ |\n\nFor more information on the helicopter drop or about Blossoms of Hope, visit or call Vera at 443-280-2590."
