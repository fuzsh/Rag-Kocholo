We discuss Sarah’s personal experience with her breast cancer diagnosis and discovery of a genetic BRCA1 mutation. This personal experience has guided her in her advocacy for greater access to genetic testing and counselling, so Australians can be better informed about their risks and treatment pathways. The recently published MAGENTA study, supported by AstraZeneca, that Sarah was a lead author, saw 1,200 breast cancer patients across regions surveyed on the barriers they experience in accessing genetic testing and counselling.

Today I'm pleased to be joined by Sarah Powell, the CEO of Pink Hope, Australia's hereditary cancer patient focused organisation. Thanks so much for joining us on Trailblazer, Sarah. Thanks Penny. Now the mission of Pink Hope is to empower all Australians to understand. And act upon hereditary cancer risk by educating them about their health history, providing them with evidence based resources, and connecting them to a supportive and nurturing community. Can you share why this is important to you professionally leading Pink Hope, but also for you personally? So I might start with the personally because that's how I became involved with Pink Hope. I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 29 and I didn't get genetic testing at the time. A couple of years later I did my own investigations and I got a referral to her family cancer clinic, had genetic test and found out I have a BRCA 1 mutation. And as someone that experienced cancer and then finding out about the mutation, I found the mutation part incredibly difficult to handle. For me, the cancer no longer ended with me. My daughter was 18 months when I got my genetic test result and. I all I could think about was her and the decisions she may have to make in the future. Have you know if I pass this on to her? But also the decision making I had to to think about and these are life changing decisions that I have to, you know, and all people with hereditary cancers and mutations have to think about. I had to think about when to have a mastectomy, when to have my ovaries removed, or if I wanted to have a mastectomy, did I want to carry on with high risk screening. So there was lots to think about and I found it really challenging and I found Pink Hope pretty much at its inception at that stage 15 years ago. And. I was just so passionate about helping other families like mine. It can feel incredibly isolating when you have a genetic mutation. And particularly back then, people didn't really understand what it was. This was the pre Angelina Jolie days. So, yeah. And my friends, you know, they couldn't really grasp what I was trying to deal with. And so being connected to people that are going through the same thing as you was, was incredibly empowering. But and, you know, and, and helped me along that whole experience. So I did a lot of fundraising for Pink Hope and just stayed involved as much as I could. And when the opportunity came up, because Crystal was moving on and I, I was more than happy to, to put my name up and in my name in the ring and say, Yep, I, I'd really love to lead the organization because a pinko, we've always said. Knowledge is power. If you know your risk, you can change your future. You, you have the options there if you know about it. So for us, it's helping people understand what their risk is, how to assess it, and then what options are available to them. And in terms of the experiences facing patients with hereditary cancer, you co-authored a paper that focused on 1200 patients and their experiences of testing, living through the diagnosis and also. Drawn out areas that potentially focus for reform. What are the key areas that identified to you from that paper that you think you really when you really need to highlight? So the the survey was done with breast cancer patients in nine different regions in the world. So there were clearly some differences in different regions, which was to be expected, but overall only one in three patients had undergone genetic testing. The only 50% had received any type of genetic counselling. And the, the barriers that we, that we found that the, the main barrier is lack of awareness that people just weren't aware that they, this is something that they should be looking into with their breast cancer diagnosis. I can only speak for how it is in Australia, but. We know that the testing criteria to receive Medicare funded genetic testing is is very narrow. It it doesn't, people miss out, people fall through the gaps. I am living proof of that so and diagnosed 18 years ago with triple negative breast cancer at 29 and I wasn't offered genetic testing. Now I know that would be very different today. However, at the time people kept saying to me, do you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer? And I said no because I don't and I still don't. And the reality is I still had a bracket one mutation. So, you know, for some people, the family history is they don't mind not know their family. They might have a very small family. They might not talk to their family, you know, and a lot of families don't talk about having cancer. So there might be aware of the cancers in the family. There might be adopted. So there's a lot of scenarios where people miss out. And we also know that, you know, studies have shown there are many women that if they were for women with breast cancer were given genetic testing, many more would have come, you know, wouldn't have fit the criteria, but they did have a mutation. The important part of this is that if you do have a genetic mutation and you have had you have breast cancer, your treatment pathway may change. They may be different treatments available to you. You may choose to have a mastectomy at the time of your diagnosis versus. Perhaps a lumpectomy, which is exactly what happened to me because my tumor was small. I only had a lumpectomy. Then when I found out I had agent invitation, I wanted to have a mastectomy. And the challenge for me was because I'd had radiation, my reconstruction was really complex and I had to actually use my black muscle from my back to to reconstruct because of the radiation. And so, you know, this is the example. People need to have that information at diagnosis, not later. But the other side of it is their family. You know, we know that genetic testing. You know, the cascade testing that happens, it gives people in their family the opportunity to have that knowledge and perhaps avoid the, you know, the diagnosis that that person has in talking about those experiences. In many ways you've answered the question I was about to ask, which is what are the key areas that we need to focus on in Australia for reform and, and why that is so important. I think you've pointed to that in terms of the point of diagnosis and the in critical nature of. Our genetic testing, but do you want to talk more about what in particular we really need to be calling on? So I'm going to talk about it from a patient advocate or a patient advocacy group perspective. I think what we need to do is think beyond the genetic test and we. Are not set up in Australia right now for the amount of genetic testing that is happening and I said to someone the other day it's exploding and they said it's exploded. Our family cancer clinics in genetic councillors in Australia are fantastic, but those clinics weren't set up for the amount of testing that is now happening. The, the, what we see is these patients, they have the genetic test and they get the result and then they come to an organization like us because they need that peer support, that and even education. Genetic counselors have a very limited amount of time they can spend with the patient. There are so many questions. You will walk out of that appointment thinking, you know you can get all the information, but you need more support after that and obviously they they don't have the capacity to do that. You know, I think that often in the healthcare system, people think about it very clinically. So it's, you know, we need the workforce, we need to have genetic counselors. We need to make sure, you know, our labs can do the genetic testing, that that's just the start of a lifetime rollercoaster for someone that has a genetic mutation. And, you know, I say this from personal experience. You will then have to make all these decisions, like I said, life changing decisions about how to manage your risk or reduce your risk. You will need to think about perhaps your children and they, you know, when they might need genetic testing. How do you talk to your family members body image issues, you know, you're removing parts of your body and surgical menopause, it's probably one of the biggest things we see talked about on our support groups is people going through surgical menopause to reduce their risk of ovarian cancer because that comes with a whole nother set of problems. So. It's the ongoing and I call it a roller coaster because I have my ovaries removed 10 years ago. Went into surgical menopause, managed it reasonably well. And so I've kind of been on that sort of low of the roller coaster I suppose. But my daughter's 17 this year. So in, you know, in a years time she'll be eligible for testing and I feel like I'll be back on that rollercoaster worried, you know, and sort of going through that process with her so I think. If you know, I, I love that people are getting genetic testing. I love that there's more information, but we need more support for these people. And it, it's outside of the healthcare system. We're organisation, like many of the organisations involved in Magenta received very little or no government funding. We receive none, but we're supporting the patients after, you know, they're having their genetic testing. So I, I think that's what needs to change in Australia. But also we do need to broaden that criteria, particularly for people who have been diagnosed with cancer. And it's really important that they get access to that testing. Sarah, that is a really. Great way to describe what are the issues across the system, really thinking about it actually from the patient and thinking about eating individual patient as a person as that they have their own lives and pathways that they are really traversing through a diagnosis. And so you've really articulated the importance of knowledge and the role that knowing your hereditary cancer risk plays. But you've also talked about really the way the system manages people or patients when they have that knowledge. And what do you think are some of the key issues facing those patients today? One of the big issues we see in our community is the wait times to have prophylactic surgery, particularly expectancies that that isn't the only way to manage your risk of breast cancer. High risk screening is also an option, but some women choose to have a mastectomy and reduce that risk as much as possible and. I I rarely see someone in the public system wait less than 18 months and we know of some women that have waited over three years on the public system for a mastectomy. And so I feel like these, these women, they, they get this knowledge, which is amazing, but then they can't do anything with it and then becomes the anxiety while they're waiting because they've been told that they're at this, you know, hugely increased risk of breast cancer, but they're having to weigh and what we also see in our community as people. Don't want to wait. So but they don't have the money to to pay for these surgeries privately. So they access their super or they borrow money or they blown money or put it on their credit cards because they just want that fear to go, you know, they want to do everything they can to reduce their risk as much as possible. So it, it just feels a little frustrating for these people. And you know, that's why my concern around increasing genetic testing in the general population is that what do people do with this? Knowledge and when the system isn't set up to to help them manage their risk appropriately. And I think that really brings together the key components of the advocacy and the work that you are doing. From pink coat perspective. It is about raising awareness of the critical role that hereditary cancer does play and diagnosis, but also then the critical role that you play in terms of helping people with that journey as they spam. And diagnosis and also are being informed as much as possible. Was Sarah out? There's lots to think about, lots that you are really advocating for. And so I really thank you for your time with us on Trail Blazers and hopefully it's the start of what might be a few more conversations in this forum. Absolutely. Thanks, Penny, Thanks for having me. Thanks so much.\n\nTo view or add a comment, sign in"
