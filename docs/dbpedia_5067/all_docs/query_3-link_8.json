        "text": "Indigenous Pink Day is a national breast cancer awareness campaign for Native people. Our team invites Indigenous people of all ages to join us by wearing pink and sharing photos on social media using the hashtag #IndigenousPink to raise awareness of breast cancer in Indian Country. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Native women, and is the second leading cause of cancer death. However, all bodies have breast tissue and are at risk for developing breast cancer. Indigenous Pink Day aims to educate Native communities about the importance of early detection, and remind women, men, non-binary, and genderfluid relatives to talk to their doctors about breast cancer screening. Because this national campaign happens on a digital platform, community members are able to participate from anywhere!\n\nHost an Event.\n\nTalk to your healthcare provider for advice and information on breast cancer screenings. Talk to your loved ones about the importance of early detection and encourage them to schedule a mammogram. Print out the Indigenous Pink Screening Pledge for your event!\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST: JOSH ATCHEYNUM\n\nJosh began creating pieces of ledger art 10 years ago, wanting to use it as a tool to share history and oral traditions that were passed down. He creates stunning works of ledger art that can be seen in private collections, galleries and museums all over the world. In the last few years, Josh started to mix modern history with his art as he states \"One day in the future this will be history for our great, great, grandchildren\" He thanks his parents Darwin & Lori Atcheynum who always encouraged his art growing up & who sees his visions with art and the growth of an artist over the years."
