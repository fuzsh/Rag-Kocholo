It may sound silly, but zipping up one of the new bras made a huge impact on how I felt that day and restored my hope that I will one day get through this. I needed these medical necessities. They were so important to my ongoing recovery.”\n\nJenny Allen\n\n“Just wanted to say thank you so much for the wig and accessories that you sent to my house. During such a hard time it was so comforting to get while I’m in treatment. Bless you and thank you.”\n\nStefanie\n\n“Forever grateful, I spent 5 hours at my cancer center’s emergency department yesterday and came home to the beautiful package. It was a much-needed pick me up, I am forever grateful or these important products needed as I navigate this hard journey”\n\nMelissa"
