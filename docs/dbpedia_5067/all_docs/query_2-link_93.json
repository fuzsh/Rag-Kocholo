        "text": "Breast Cancer Awareness Month kicks off today (Oct 1) and despite the pandemic, there is a still slew of fabulous things you can do to support breast cancer awareness and research. The Estee Lauder Companies are longtime supporters of the breast cancer cause, and this year, besides limited edition Pink Ribbon beauty products from its brands — there are six on board — they have collaborated with local partners to make sure that even as we battle Covid-19, the goal to end breast cancer does not take a back seat.\n\nPart of proceeds of these efforts will go to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF). Additionally, for every public, in-feed Instagram post throughout the month of October featuring the hashtags #TimeToEndBreastCancer and #UnitedinHopeSG, the Estée Lauder Companies will donate $5 per post, up to $10,000, to support breast disease research at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nThere is also a Breast Cancer Campaign Microsite at https://timetoendbreastcancer.sg, where you can go for more info and to visit the virtual photobooth, to capture your pink ribbon moments in support of the campaign’s mission and donation drive.\n\nHere's how you can treat yourself and support Breast Cancer awareness and research at the same time.\n\nThis is one of three high tea collabs with The Estée Lauder Companies in the month of October to raise awareness and funds for breast cancer research.\n\nAt Anti:dote at Fairmont Singapore, there are drawers full of delectable treats like Crustacean Rillette, Salmon Gravlax and pink sweets like Rose and Lychee Sable Tart and Ruby Chocolate Cocoa Bean. $3 from each Pink Hope High Tea Set will be donated to Singapore General Hospital in support of breast disease research.\n\n$55++ for 1 pax (inclusive of one cup of coffee or one pot of TWG tea). To book, go here.\n\nLocal print and textile studio Minor Miracles has the most pandemic-appropriate product in the campaign — a face mask. It's pink, of course, and the pretty print is inspired by the idea that women are like plants in a garden, full of diversity, strength and beauty. The Garden collection comprises of a beauty pouch ($28), a hair band ($18) and a face mask ($12). 20% of the profits from the sale of the collection will be donated to Singapore General Hospital in support of breast disease research. The first 50 purchases of the complete Minor Miracles x The Estée Lauder Companies Breast Cancer Awareness Collection – The Garden will be accompanied with a complimentary beauty kit from The Estée Lauder Companies (worth $98).\n\nLocal lingerie label Perk by Kate has an exclusive collection in support of Breast Cancer Awareness, which includes the Harper Full Cup Padded Bralette set in blush, constructed perfectly for patients who have undergone mastectomy as it offers more coverage. Perk by Kate offers the adjustment of padding options for each cup to balance out any differences in sizes. Part of the proceeds from sales will be donated to SGH, and every purchase made from the Perk by Kate x The Estée Lauder Companies Breast Cancer Awareness Collection will be accompanied by a complimentary beauty kit from The Estée Lauder Companies (worth at least $100)."
