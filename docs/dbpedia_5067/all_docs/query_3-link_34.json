        "text": "October is here and all around the world, people are pulling out their pink ribbons in solidarity with the brave women battling cancer. Most of you already know that the pink ribbon symbolizes breast cancer awareness. But where did it all start? Is the meaning behind this well-known symbol still clear? We thought we’d dive into the story behind the iconic image, now recognized and featured worldwide, to answer some of these questions.\n\nThe Story Behind The Pink Ribbon - Before Pink, There Was Peach\n\nThe ribbon was first used, in 1979, as a token of remembrance where families tied yellow ribbons around trees waiting for loved ones who were being held hostage in Iran. It then was seen red and pinned to the actor Jeremy Irons who wore it to the Tony awards to support AIDS awareness. Soon, almost every charitable cause was adopting its own ribbon and 1992 became ‘The Year Of The Ribbon’, according to The New York Times.\n\nCharlotte went on to distribute thousands of these cards in the local supermarket, left stacks at doctor’s offices, and wrote to prominent women from former First Ladies to Dear Abby. Her daughter, sister, and grandmother all had breast cancer. Her ribbons were a call to action, not just a message to read and forget about. She was calling on a demand for prevention of the disease, more accountability towards better funding for breast cancer research, and promotion of self-exams and testing. Charlotte never accepted money for all her work, directing dollars towards breast cancer research.\n\nCharlotte’s efforts piqued the interests of Alexandra Penney, the editor-in-chief of Self magazine, and Evelyn Lauder, senior vice president of cosmetics company Estée Lauder. Both recognized the enormous potential of branding this image in their campaigns. Self approached Charlotte about using the peach ribbon in their second annual breast cancer awareness issue. Charlotte immediately turned down the idea, saying the initiative was too corporate and commercial. Their hearts set on a ribbon campaign, Self and Estee Lauder, after legal consultation, simply turned the color of the ribbon from peach to the pink we are so familiar with now.\n\n1.5 million pink ribbons were distributed at Estee Lauder counters with a breast self-exam card. Each person who took a ribbon had their name written on a petition that got sent to the White House to ask for an increase in funding for breast cancer research.\n\nSometimes - to those who have been through breast cancer or are battling the disease - it doesn't seem like the message of the pink ribbon is really getting out, and understood. It can get lost in insincere marketing and campaigns chasing engagement.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society (ACS), breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women, other than skin cancers. This makes awareness that much more important.\n\nBreast cancer awareness is an effort to reduce the stigma of breast cancer through education on symptoms and treatment. The global awareness that has been raised through the pink ribbon has helped increase early detection of breast cancer, make women more aware of the importance of doing regular breast self-examinations, and increase funds directed toward finding a cure.\n\nFUN FACT: The color pink, a very specific shade called “150 Pink”, was decided on for it’s symbolizing of\n\nCalming\n\nPlayful\n\nQuieting\n\nLife-affirming\n\nStress relieving characteristics.\n\nPastel pink is also thought to be health-giving.\n\nWhat It Means To Us"
