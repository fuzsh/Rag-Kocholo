They need adults to stand up and speak out.\n\nRight now, the UK is expanding oil and gas drilling that risks worsening the climate crisis. Continuing to drill betrays children’s futures and steals their right to inherit a liveable world.\n\nWe are looking for passionate volunteers to become Changemakers and help put an end to new fossil fuels. Your voice will let those in power know that we care about creating a better world for all children."
