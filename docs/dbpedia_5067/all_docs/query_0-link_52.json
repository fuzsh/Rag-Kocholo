Our new eBook can help you find healing hope.\n\n“Wendy tells you how to nourish hope that heals—realistic hope, honest hope, hope that can keep you from wasting time and energy on despair, denial or wishful thinking…” —Jane Brody, NY Times\n\nThe mission of NBCF revolves around hope. We want to change the conversation that often ends with a rallying cry to “Have hope!” Instead, we want that to start a new conversation about which hopes can help you today, how to nurture them, and how to let go of those that might harm.\n\nWe’re honored that Dr. Harpham created this exciting eBook with us. Her award-winning writing and patient advocacy work demonstrate her dedication to patients. Her own remarkable survival through and beyond cancer serves as testimony to the power of healing hope to help you live your best life, whatever the circumstances.\n\n“I thoroughly enjoyed this eBook and am excited that others can use its message, too. Now I’m off to do my ‘hope-work’!” —Pat Battaglia, metastatic cancer survivor, Associate Program Director, Breast Cancer Coalition Rochester\n\nTopics include:\n\nTell us where we can send your free copy of the eBook, Finding Hope that Heals."
