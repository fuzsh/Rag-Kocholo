        "text": "Your mission statement is the foundation for your nonprofit’s marketing and communications.\n\nA mission statement, also referred to as a vision statement, sums up the essence of your organization in just one or two sentences. It guides your decision-making processes and drives people to want to learn more about your organization.\n\nAt its strongest, a mission statement explains three things:\n\nWhy your organization exists\n\nWhom it serves\n\nHow it serves them\n\nAn effective mission statement hits all three points in a succinct, clear, and memorable way. However, many mission statements are vague and ambiguous, while others are too wordy and use industry-specific jargon. It’s up to you to craft a message that’s easy for people to remember and repeat to others.\n\nWhether writing a new mission statement or sprucing up an old one, you can learn from the best. Check out these 20 mission statement examples for guidance and inspiration, along with our tips on how to write an impactful nonprofit mission statement.\n\nDiscover How Classy Can Help 2x Your Revenue With Top Tech\n\nLearn More About Classy\n\n1. charity: water Vision Statement\n\ncharity: water is a nonprofit organization bringing clean and safe drinking water to people in developing nations.\n\nWhat we love about it: charity: water wastes no time getting to the heart of its cause.

Study your mission statement and assess whether it does its job. Then, invest the time and effort to make it hard to forget."
