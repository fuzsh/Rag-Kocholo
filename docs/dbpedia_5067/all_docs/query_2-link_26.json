Most of us are aware of breast cancer, yet we often forget to take the steps to detect the disease in its early stages and encourage others to do the same. So, give Hope to offer support and wishes of good health, to congratulate a survivor, to remind a friend or family member to perform monthly self-exams, or to express your thanks for anyone who works for the cure.\n\nWhat you should know: Women under 40 with either a family history of breast cancer or other concerns should talk with a health care provider.\n\nClinical breast examination by a health care provider at least every 3 years starting at age 20, and every year after 40.\n\nMonthly breast self-exams starting by age 20. Males should be aware too! Even though it is rare for men to develop breast cancer, early detection is just as important.\n\n*Each Pink Bird of Hope comes ready to give in a gift box and includes a gift card.\n\nPlease note that charges on your credit card will appear as “Using Art to Create a Better World”\n\nSize: 3.75″ long x 2.75″ tall (Sizes are approximate; no two Pink birds are exactly alike. You will find variations in size and color and other minor dissimilarities that are characteristic of handmade glass.)"
