We believe that individuals will have a chance to grow in their well-being, relationships, and spirit to help in their cancer journey. We believe that at all stages of the cancer journey, it is not enough to survive, but rather to focus on thriving and celebrating life.\n\nLoving Relationships\n\nOur goal is to foster loving relationships through our words, actions, and connections. We believe that not only will families grow in love during our retreat weeks, but families will continue their Little Pink experience long after the end of a retreat or volunteer experience.\n\nNon-Judgmental Environment\n\nOur promise is to create an environment of acceptance among staff, volunteers, and participants. We believe that families come in all shapes and sizes. We do not discriminate based on race, sexual orientation or identity, age, gender, disability, geographic location or religion. Breast cancer affects everyone and it is our mission to serve everyone who is on the journey. Cancer is the great equalizer- there is no room for judgment, only love and compassion."
