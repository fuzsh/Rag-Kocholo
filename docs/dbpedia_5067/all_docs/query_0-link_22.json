It’s about the most fun you can legally have on a golf course, while proving you don’t have to take yourself too seriously to support a seriously good cause. So leave your pretentions at the door – or the driving range – and enjoy a fun day of golf while helping to support families in need throughout Howard County.\n\nKevin\n\nMy team has been fortunate to take part in this annual event since its inception, in large part because of the team’s efforts helping raise funds for local organizations in need. But, what separates this event from so many others is an environment that fosters a full day of great golf with non stop laughs and enjoyment. From the moment you check in until you leave, you’re sure to experience things and sites you’ll never forget…but sometimes wish you could. Thanks Susie, your team and Blossoms of Hope…Howard County is lucky to have you!\n\nMike\n\nMy group has been playing in the golf tournament since the very beginning. We would never think about missing it because it's the most fun tournament ever! Keep up the great charity work, and we will see you on the course.\n\nGary\n\nWouldn't miss this tournament for the world! It's always the first one on the calendar for me and my team. We look forward to not only a great day of golf, food, and beverages but also an amazing cause put together by an incredible team!\n\nAndrew\n\nWhat Is Pink Greens?\n\nBlossoms of Hope’s Pink Greens is a fun-filled, 18-hole golf tournament. Lunch, dinner and an auction will follow. Prize holes like “longest shot\" and “double your money” only add to the fun.\n\nThis is a good opportunity to get in a fun day of golfing with friends and colleagues while helping to raise funds for a good cause in the community."
