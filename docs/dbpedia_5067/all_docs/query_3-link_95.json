        "text": "MISSION\n\nThe mission of Twisted Pink is to provide hope and connection to people living with metastatic breast cancer by funding bold breakthroughs in research and awareness of the disease. We are a 501(c)3 charitable organization based in Louisville, KY with Fed Tax ID 47-1140389.\n\nVISION\n\nA world where breast cancer is eliminated.\n\nWhat is Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)\n\nMBC is different from early stage breast cancer. Once breast cancer moves from the breast to other organs it is considered stage IV and there is no cure. People who are diagnosed with MBC will remain in treatment for the remainder of their lives. When breast cancer metastasizes, or travels from the breast to other organs, it most commonly travels to the brain, bone, liver, or lungs. Although some women and men with MBC live many years due to improving treatments, it is an incurable disease.\n\nSpread Hope with Twisted Pink\n\nTwisted Pink needs your help on this #GiveForGoodLou day to support more critical scientific research that will change the lives of people living with MBC. Please donate what you can as every small or large amount adds up. There is strength in numbers! Share with your social media friends and family! Let's show all individuals and their families impacted by a MBC diagnosis that there are organizations like Twisted Pink and survivors of all stages who are fighting for better treatments and quality of life. Let's make Thursday, September 12th #GiveForGoodLou day one of those days we spread support research and hope to individuals with MBC everywhere!\n\nFundraisers of $200 or More\n\nAll fundraisers who raise at least $200 will receive a Twisted Pink Tumbler and T-Shirt.\n\nFundraisers of $500 or More\n\nAll fundraisers who raise at least $500 will receive two tickets to attend the 2025 Twisted Pink Annual Fundraising Event.\n\nFundraisers of $2000 or More\n\nAll fundraisers who raise at least $2000 will receive overnight accommodations and two tickets to the 2025 Annual Fundraising Event.\n\nWho We Are\n\nOur Mission\n\nThe mission of Twisted Pink is to extend lives and improve quality of life for late stage breast cancer patients and their families by funding metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer research.\n\nWhy Twisted Pink?\n\nThe primary purpose of Twisted Pink is to accelerate outcomes of research to reach the patient quicker. The following FACTS about breast cancer drive our mission and vision:\n\n•Most people have never heard of Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC). MBC is breast cancer that has spread beyond the breast to other organs. Breast Cancer most commonly spreads to the brain, bone, liver or lungs. MBC is stage IV breast cancer and there is no cure.\n\n•Around 85% of breast cancers are NOT caused by family history.\n\n•Metastatic Breast Cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women under 50 years of age.\n\n•The median survival after MBC diagnosis is three years. This is just an 18-month increase from 1970!\n\n•MBC can occur 5, 10, or 15 years after a person’s original diagnosis and successful treatment checkups and annual mammograms.\n\n•MBC accounts for approximately 43,000 deaths annually in the U.S.\n\n•MBC affects young women and men. Men do get breast cancer, and they are often misdiagnosed initially. They represent about 1% of the new cases of breast cancer and 1% of the deaths from MBC.\n\nMore information about the organization can be found on our website at http://www.twistedpink.org"
