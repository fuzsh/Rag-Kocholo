        "text": "Pink Hope was founded on experience\n\nPink Hope was born out of a personal (family) experience with breast cancer. Jeff, the owner of both Pink Hope and Atlantic Prosthetic Services, felt that the needs of a person with breast cancer are unique. Therefore, great attention to detail was essential in meeting this need.\n\nThe environment is extremely important. Even though insurance companies use codes and refer to mastectomy products as DMEs (durable medical equipment), undergoing breast cancer is extremely personal and we understand the respect our customers deserve.\n\nPink Hope stands out as the leading Mastectomy Boutique in Wilmington, and the ONLY Mastectomy Boutique in Whiteville. We hope to turn this “medical” visit into something a little less drab, and help you gain symmetry and confidence."
