        "text": "Welcome to CanCareâs blog. CanCare is an organization that works with cancer survivor volunteers to provide one-on-one emotional support to individuals living with cancer. Join us in supporting about Breast Cancer Awareness Month!\n\nEach year in the United States, around 240,000 women face breast cancer, according to the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC). It's a challenging journey for many, but it's also a journey filled with hope!\n\nIt's heartening to know that events like Breast Cancer Awareness Month as well asÂ advancements in medical care and ongoing research are improving the odds and offering support to those facing breast cancer.\n\nWe encourage you to continue reading below to explore a wealth of helpful and inspiring information about breast cancer!\n\nGet Support\n\nSupport Information\n\nWhat is Breast Cancer?\n\nA breast has three main parts: lobules, ducts, and connective tissue. Lobules make milk, ducts carry milk to the nipple, and connective tissue holds everything together.\n\nBreast cancer is when cells in the breast start to grow uncontrollably. There are different types of breast cancer, depending on which breast cells become cancerous.\n\nMost breast cancers start in the ducts or lobules. If breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body through blood or lymph vessels, it's called metastasis.\n\nâ\n\nTypes of Breast Cancer\n\nThe most common types of breast cancer are:\n\nInvasive Ductal Carcinoma: In this type, cancer cells start in the ducts but can move beyond them into other parts of the breast. They may also spread to other parts of the body.\n\nInvasive Lobular Carcinoma: Cancer begins in the lobules and can spread to nearby breast tissues and other parts of the body.\n\nThere are also less common types like Paget's disease, medullary, mucinous, and inflammatory breast cancer. Equally important, another condition is Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), which is not invasive. It means that the cancer cells are only found in the lining of the ducts and have not spread to other parts of the breast.\n\nPositive Breast Cancer Statistics\n\nBreast cancer is a diagnosis that brings a wave of emotions, concerns, and questions. While the journey through breast cancer can be challenging, it's important to know that there are many reasons for hope and positivity.\n\nSurvival and Hope: Many women diagnosed with breast cancer not only survive but also lead fulfilling lives. About 90% of women diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States are still living five years after diagnosis, giving them hope for a bright future.\n\nEarly Detection Matters: The key to a positive outcome often lies in early detection. When breast cancer is found early, it can be less aggressive and easier to treat. In fact, if caught at a localized stage, almost everyone has a good chance of beating it!\n\nImproved Treatments: Thanks to advances in medicine, breast cancer treatment has come a long way. Some patients can now benefit from personalized treatment plans that are more effective and less invasive, allowing them to maintain a better quality of life during their journey to recovery.\n\nContinued Progress: The world's growing awareness and investment in breast cancer research are making a real difference. More insights and better therapies are being developed every day, offering hope for an even brighter future for breast cancer patients.\n\nKeep in mind, each person's experience with breast cancer is unique, but these positive aspects show that there's reason for hope and strength in the face of the challenge.\n\nThe History of Breast Cancer Awareness Month\n\nThe American Cancer Society and Imperial Chemical Industries' pharmaceutical business teamed up to launch the first Breast Cancer Awareness Month in 1985. Betty Ford, a breast cancer survivor herself, assisted in launching the week-long event. She received her diagnosis while her husband, Gerald Ford, was president of the United States, which increased awareness of breast cancer.â\n\nIn the beginning, Breast Cancer Awareness Month aimed to empower women by educating them about breast cancer. It also focused on early detection testing to help women take control of their breast health. Another one of their main objectives was to promote consciousness of mammograms as a key tool in the treatment against\n\nâIn more recent years, businesses and sports leagues have teamed up to increase awareness throughout the month. All of which has helped fundraising efforts to improve care and aim towards hopefully one day destroying the disease.\n\nBreast Cancer Awareness Month Facts: The Pink Ribbon\n\nMost everyone is familiar with the pink ribbon that appears during the month of October, but where did it originate from? The pink ribbon came to life back in 1992, thanks to EstÃ©e Lauder cosmetics. They gave away 1.5 million of them and deemed the pink ribbon as the visual reminder of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\n\nAlso, the NFL has become one of the largest supporters of Breast Cancer Awareness month. Coaches, players, and referees across the league wear a pink ribbon and other attire every October to show their support!\n\nWhat You Can do for Breast Cancer Awareness Month\n\nAre you wanting to show support during Breast Cancer Awareness Month but not sure how?
