        "text": "It is nearly impossible to miss that October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. There are numerous awareness days and months. Marketing campaigns seem to love to jump on idea of pink products and vague promises of donating to some kind of breast cancer charity. For someone like me who loves pink, adding pink items to my life is second nature. Did you know that Metastatic Breast Cancer has its own ribbon?\n\nThe MBC ribbon is green, teal and pink. The green represents triumph of spring over winter and thus symbolizes renewal, hope and immorality. The teal symbolizes healing and spirituality. The pink identifies the origin of the metastasis as breast cancer. It is harder to find products with the MBC ribbon on it. Everyone is aware of pink ribbon breast cancer, but not metastatic breast cancer – the only kind that kills and is killing 115 people every single day. I had not heard of MBC when I was diagnosed with it in July 2019. I found a lump and when they scheduled a biopsy, I had resigned myself to a diagnosis of breast cancer, the “little b” kind of breast cancer – early stage. My husband and I had talked about the possibilities of surgery and treatment and fighting it like a girl and battling it for a period of time and then moving on. When I was told it was Stage IV and had already spread to my bones, liver and adrenal gland and could not be cured, I felt like I had fallen into an abyss. Suddenly there was no talk of surgery and no talk of beating it.\n\nI like the idea of people sporting pink ribbons on items they use or wear. But if you are able to donate money to make a difference, please direct it towards a charity that truly supports people with breast cancer or knowledge about it or research to cure metastatic breast cancer. There are many worth charities. I have three that I want to highlight.\n\nThe first is My Density Matters, a non-profit organization on a mission to empower women to know their breast density and take control of their breast cancer screening. I am an ambassador for the group and we created Heidi’s Hope Boxes to raise awareness and funds. Here is a link to learn more about Heidi’s Hope Box and to purchase one for yourself or to give to a friend:\n\nThe second is Metavivor, dedicated specifically to the fight of people living with Metastatic Breast Cancer. Metavivor is volunteer led by people with MBC. They offer support for those living with MBC and bring awareness. Their most important mission is to provide critical funds for researching metastatic breast cancer. They want to turn MBC from a terminal diagnosis to a chronic, manageable disease with a decent quality of life. They are currently the only group solely dedicated to the research of Metastatic Stage IV Breast Cancer. I participated in the Chicagoland #LightUpMBC Fun Run on October 1. I have a team fundraising page where you can still donate.\n\nhttps://raceroster.com/events/2023/75440/chicagoland-number-lightupmbc-fun-run/pledge/team/573813?fbclid=IwAR2uq2xiEbVPizIkb56B3eZpHRJSNwN2yv4_FDnlub_fYVQ4YkP8a5FLcfIhttps://raceroster.com/events/2023/75440/chicagoland-number-lightupmbc-fun-run/pledge/team/573813?fbclid=IwAR2uq2xiEbVPizIkb56B3eZpHRJSNwN2yv4_FDnlub_fYVQ4YkP8a5FLcfI\n\nThe third group is the Hoopeston Breast Cancer Support Group. It meets in Hoopeston, IL every 3rd Thursday. They offer support to past and present breast cancer survivors. They offer financial support for Hoopeston-area people with breast cancer. They also offer amazing emotional support. One of the members made key chains that explain breast self exams. Please let me know if you would like one. Donations can be mailed to the group in care of Pat Foster, 202 N 2700 E Road, Wellington, IL 60973-6048.\n\nI want to leave you with a photo of me from this week as I celebrated the 21st birthday of my youngest child. This child was only 16 when I was diagnosed, the summer before their junior year in high school. I have never asked God to cure my cancer. I have asked for some healing in other areas of my life and God has done some marvelous healing in my life since my diagnosis. I begged God to allow me to see all my kids turn 21 and God provided."
