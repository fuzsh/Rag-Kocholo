        "text": "It’s springtime, which means soon there will be lots of walks and runs to raise much-needed funds for lifesaving research and programs to serve people with cancer.\n\nParticipating in these events is a great way to raise awareness, help fund research and support services, and demonstrate your support for those facing cancer.\n\nMany cancer organizations rely on fundraising to support groundbreaking research. This research helps doctors make a cancer diagnosis earlier and develop new treatments.\n\nFundraising also pays for the programs and services that help to improve the quality of life of patients and their families. Without these fundraising events, many organizations would struggle to serve those that need help the most.\n\nComing up with a creative cancer fundraising team name is a way to bring some humor to a serious issue.\n\nCreative team names for cancer walks are memorable, making it more likely that others will sign up to participate as team members or contribute money which helps you reach (and hopefully exceed) your fundraising goals.\n\nSome tips for coming up with a good team name include:\n\nKeep it short and simple, 2-3 words will be easiest to remember.\n\nIs your team participating in honor or in memory of a specific person? If so, consider including the name of the person in the team name, such as “Bridget’s Brigade”.\n\nIf the organization is disease specific, such as breast cancer focused, consider a name that relates to that type of cancer, such as “Pink Posse”.\n\nTie the name to a piece of pop culture that would be easily recognized. Some of my favorite examples are “Straight Outta Chemo”, which is a play on Straight Outta Compton, or “Rack Packers”, a play on the Rat Pack.\n\nRemember that while humor is encouraged, note that some names that could be considered too risque could have the opposite effect.\n\nSuggestions for raising the most money possible for your fundraising event:\n\n1. Build a large team – include family members, coworkers, friends and neighbors. The more team members participating and fundraising, the more money your team will collect.\n\n2. Ask if your workplace will sponsor a company team, encouraging employees to participate in the fundraising event, or by making a donation.\n\n3. Create a personal fundraising page (or one that links to a personalized donation page through the organization), and share the link on social media, asking your network to also share it with others.\n\n4. Write emails or letters to your out-of-town network who may not be on social media, and ask them to contribute.\n\n5. If allowed, set up a fundraising jar at your work or at local businesses.\n\n6. Host a yard sale where everyone on your team contributes items to sell, and where all the money made is donated to the event."
