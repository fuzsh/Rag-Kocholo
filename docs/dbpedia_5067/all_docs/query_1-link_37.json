        "text": "Our fabrics can be grouped into two categories:\n\nLong Wearing Durable Fabrics: Nylon/Spandex, Velvet, DryTech, Brushed Tricot, TechMesh, Campus Stretchtek and Campus Performance Mesh.\n\nDryTech may shrink when heat is applied.\n\nSequinz cannot be applied to Velvet.\n\nSpecial Care Fragile Fabrics: Hologram, Mesh, and Nylon/spandex with Foil (Mystique)\n\nNote that certain high fashion fabrics are more susceptible to wear and fading than other traditional long wearing, durable fabrics. Hologram and Nylon/Spandex with Foil (Mystique) fabrics will dull slightly in jeweled areas due to heat application.\n\nFragile Fabrics need extra special care:\n\nRepeated wear and washing may cause the fabrics to fade or lose foil.\n\nAlcohol in all aerosol products, such as hairspray, affect these fabrics. Please cover garment before applying. Perfumes and body lotions can also affect fragile fabrics.\n\nDeodorants and perspiration may cause these fabrics to color bleed, fade or lose foil, especially when the two colors meet under the arms. We recommend the use of pure crystal deodorant, which does not contain Aluminum Chlorohydrate.\n\nMesh could potentially be damaged due to the rigors of certain routines, where person to person contact can add stress to the fabric. You are free to order this fabric, but do so with great discretion because Elite Sportswear, L. P. will not guarantee the life span of this fabric. If you choose to use mesh in a design you will be asked to sign a waiver. The waiver states that Elite Sportswear, L.P. will not be responsible for replacing or repairing your garment(s).\n\nColor transference or color bleed occurs when a white or light color fabric is combined with a bright or dark color fabric. This is a common industry problem and can become obvious under certain conditions, especially when a light color garment is worn under a dark color warm-up or short and/or when damp garments are left in gym bags. It is impossible for Elite Sportswear, L.P. to guarantee that our fabrics will not bleed, even by following proper washing instructions, due to the individual nature of each athlete's wear/washing procedure. The following is a list of fabrics that may be at greater risk for color bleed, when combined with white or light color fabrics: Berry Mystique, Black Mystique, Navy Mystique, Red Mystique, Rich Red Velvet and Merlot Mystique. You are free to order any fabric and color combination, but please do so with great discretion. If you choose to combine light and dark colors, Elite Sportswear, L.P. will not be responsible for replacing your garment(s) if color bleed occurs.\n\nFabric softeners negatively affect the adhesives used in our garments, causing the foil on our fabrics to discolor and the embellishments to fall off.\n\nImportant Washing Instructions for all fabrics:\n\nGarment(s) must be washed separately. Turn garments inside out. Use a mild liquid detergent, gently hand wash in a large volume of cold water. Rinse immediately.\n\nDO NOT allow garment to soak. Pat dry with a clean towel and use a thick plastic hanger to air dry.\n\nDO NOT use fabric softeners. Fabric softeners negatively affect the adhesives used in our garments, causing the foil on our fabrics to discolor and the embellishments to fall off.\n\nDO NOT dry clean. Dry cleaning uses harsh chemicals that can damage the fabric and embellishments used in our garments.\n\nDO NOT iron. The heat from an iron can melt and/or discolor the delicate fabrics in our garments. Excessive heat can also weaken the adhesives used to attach the embellishments to the garment and cause them to fall off.\n\nElite Sportswear, L.P. will not guarantee any garment that is not washed and dried as directed. If you choose to combine sensitive fabrics and colors, it is at your own risk. GK may refuse returns on special orders in those combinations."
