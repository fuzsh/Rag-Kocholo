God’s calling was clear and she responded by creating an organization that works tirelessly to reach out to families that are in the middle of the breast cancer crisis. The organization is unique in that it focuses on the entire family and wrapping them in God’s love, as opposed to a patient-only focus. Little Pink conducts local programming in Burlington, NC and is most well-known for its national program for breast cancer family retreats.\n\nProject: Local Office / Clerical Volunteer\n\nDescription: Help us put together retreats and meet the day to day needs of the families that we serve.\n\nDay & Time: M-F, anytime 9-4\n\nLocation: 2442 Tribek Ct., Burlington NC 27215\n\nRequirements: Please fill out online application at www.littlepink.org, various skill levels needed.\n\nProject: Retreat Week Volunteer\n\nDescription: Come serve alongside other volunteers in the mission trip of a lifetime.
