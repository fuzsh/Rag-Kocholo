        "text": "This is exactly what got my ex-partner sick with breast cancer. She was just like me a type A, perfectionist, over-achiever willing to do whatever it took to succeed! If it meant cutting down on sleep hours to work some more, live off protein bars and coffee then that was it! Her cancer wasn’t genetic, it was lifestyle created! That was a big lesson for me since I was her caregiver and heading down the same road she was before I met her. And now running multiple companies and having more stress then I’ve ever had, I’m realizing these important lessons I learnt from her before she passed away. One of them was, who cares about anything else then your health, because without that nothing else matters. Who cares if it takes you longer to achieve your goals! Because if you lose your health before getting there, you’ll probably never get there and you won’t be there to enjoy the thing that matters the most in life and that is quality time with the people you love ❤️ All this to say, take care of yourself, don’t cut on sleep, don’t fuel your body with shit food, instead optimize yourself so that you can be productive when you need to and present when you need too!

How do you express your love for yourself? Breast cancer treatment can be really hard on a patient's mind and body. It's very important to take care of yourself to help with healing. Here are some simple ways to do that: 1. Get Support: It's normal to feel scared, sad, or worried after having breast cancer. Talking to family, friends, or a counselor can make you feel better. 2. Take Care of Your Body: Doing things like exercising, eating healthy foods, and sleeping enough can make you feel stronger and help keep cancer from coming back. 3. Relax and Be Mindful: Trying activities like meditation or yoga can help calm your mind and make you feel less stressed. 4. Find a group: Being part of a breast cancer support group lets you meet others who know what you're going through. It's a good way to share stories and get support. 5. Focusing on these self-care tips can help breast cancer survivors feel better and healthier. Katrina Mayer rightly said once, “Loving yourself isn’t vanity. It’s sanity”. #lovingyourself #cancerpatient #breastcancer #bemindful #eathealthy\n\n🌺𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗡𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗹, 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗕𝗼𝗱𝘆🌺 Ladies and gentlemen, Yes! you men too! It's time to get familiar with your own body in a way that can truly save lives. Make self-breast exams, and being body aware, not just an occasional occurrence but a regular, non-negotiable part of your regular monthly routine. Knowing what's normal for you is an essential step towards early detection - the key to overcoming breast and other cancers. The importance of self-breast exams and body awareness is that you can notice subtle changes, such as lumps, skin texture variations, or nipple discharge, which might go unnoticed. Check over your whole body, not just your breasts/chest. Look at yourself in the mirror. Learn what's normal for you. Schedule a specific time each month, maybe the first day of each month so its easy to remember. Make it a habit, it's an investment in your well-being. Fiji Cancer Society is here if you have any questions or concerns about self-breast exams or breast health. Don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to provide guidance, resources, and support every step of the way. #KnowYourNormal #EarlyDetection #Pinktober #MoveMore #WeighLess #EatRight #GetScreened #TakeAction\n\nSupporting a friend through breast cancer can make a significant difference in their journey.

In November 2018, my husband was told he had Stage 4 bowel cancer. He is incredibly lucky because he’s now four years’ post-treatment and remains no evidence of disease. I honestly believe this is because, post diagnosis, my husband received the very best care and had the most amazing surgeon who demonstrated not just skill but awesome empathy and understanding during some very difficult and dark days. We will be forever grateful to him. So, my reminder to everyone is to check your 💩. Get checked by your GP if you are worried about changes to your bowel habits, don’t be embarrassed and if your instincts tell you something is wrong, trust them and push hard for action! At no point did my husband have blood in his poo (although this can be a symptom), not even in late stage tests. His symptoms were: - A pain in the same place in his tummy that wouldn’t go away. - Feeling constantly tired. - Weight loss and loss of appetite. - Pencil 💩 (a change in the shape of his poo due to the cancer causing a blockage) - Getting ‘flu like’ symptoms (regularly feeling like he had a temperature and getting the ‘shakes’) It will probably be nothing, but you are better to get things checked. Bowel cancer that is found early has excellent survival rates!! We will be continuing our ongoing survival party by holidaying in Mexico 🇲🇽… just one week to go before the celebrations begin! #checkyourpoo #nevertooyoung #anyexcuseforacelebration\n\n#grrf Special Day Update 13 October- No Bra Day No Bra Day, celebrated annually on October 13, is a significant event promoting body positivity and raising awareness about breast health. Originating from Breast Cancer Awareness Month, it encourages individuals, especially women, to go without bras for the day, emphasizing the importance of early detection and regular self-exams. This day serves as a reminder of the significance of early detection and regular breast self-examinations, motivating women to take an active role in their breast health. Contrary to common belief, not wearing a bra doesn't necessarily result in sagging breasts; studies even suggest that the natural support of breast ligaments can be enhanced when breasts move freely. Additionally, embracing one's body without a bra can significantly boost body confidence, encouraging individuals to accept and value their bodies as they are. It stands for empowerment, body positivity, and breast health awareness. Whether someone actively participates or merely lends support to the cause, the day underscores the importance of celebrating and prioritizing every individual's comfort and health. #grrf #health #breastcancerawareness #freedom #people\n\nListen up, ladies! The bad news is that when it comes to stroke, the stats aren’t in our favor. In case you didn’t know, 1 in 5 women will have a stroke in her lifetime, and stroke kills nearly twice as many women as breast cancer. The good news, according to the World Stroke Organization, is that up to 90% of strokes are preventable. We can all take charge of our health to be #GreaterThan > stroke. How? Here are some tips: Manage your blood pressure; eat smart; exercise regularly; know your family history; control cholesterol; and go to your annual wellness appointments. For more prevention tips and additional information, visit www.world-stroke.org or www.goredforwomen.org. #WorldStrokeDay #GreaterThan #womenshealth #strokeawareness #strokeprevention #carotidarterydissection #MejorQue #MelhorQue\n\nHey there! 👋🏼 Ever feel like health challenges are like a rollercoaster you didn't sign up for?
