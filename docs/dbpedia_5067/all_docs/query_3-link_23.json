        "text": "The 2023 Breast Cancer Campaign\n\nBeautifully United to Help End Breast Cancer.\n\nThe Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) is dedicated to advancing possibilities for people around the world. As a company that lives its values, ELC has been at the forefront of supporting the global breast cancer community for more than 30 years.\n\nAt a time when breast cancer wasn’t spoken about openly, Evelyn H. Lauder saw an opportunity to bring awareness to the disease and address stigmas in women’s health. In 1992, she co-created the Pink Ribbon and founded ELC’s Breast Cancer Campaign inspiring a global movement around The Campaign’s mission to help create a breast cancer-free world for all.\n\nAs a cornerstone of the company’s social investments in women’s advancement and health, The Campaign continues to inspire purpose-driven action. Today, it supports more than 60 organizations around the world that facilitate real change aligned to the diverse needs of local communities.\n\nELC is committed to continuing the meaningful work that helps provide critical improvements in breast cancer through the collective efforts of employees, consumers, and partners worldwide. These efforts include raising funds to advance life-saving scientific research, expanding access to medical resources and care, advocating for greater awareness and early detection, developing educational materials, amplifying diverse points of view from thought leaders around the world, and many more.\n\nIn honor of The Campaign’s 30th Anniversary in 2022, The Estée Lauder Companies Charitable Foundation made a commitment to donate $15 million over five years to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation to fund groundbreaking research that will further the goal of reducing breast cancer disparities and improving outcomes.\n\nTogether, we can help create real progress against this disease, one that deserves global attention year-round, not only in October.\n\nIt’s #TimeToEndBreastCancer."
