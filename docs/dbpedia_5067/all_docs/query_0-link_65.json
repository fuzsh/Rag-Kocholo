        "text": "2023 has been a busy year so far and we have only had 20 days of it (when I started writing this)! My mind is generally willing but my body is not. For once I have decided to take stock and be realistic, (and listen to my Mum) at last, she is probably thinking! It seems my realistic is not realistic. Well, for what is realistic for me, but maybe for a ‘well’ non-disabled version of me!\n\nACCA and Being Reasonable in 2023\n\nWe need to be reasonable. So, I have rethought my aim for the year, especially relating to my Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) studying. It is better to take a bit longer but get there. This is a concept I struggle with. I know I am behind compared to my peers, and things take me longer to achieve, so I just want to do it! However, slow and steady wins the race.\n\nI think I am just good at giving this advice to others but not doing it myself.\n\nI hope to take two accounting exams one which I should take shortly and one maybe in September.\n\nDisability Talk At Work\n\nA few weeks ago, I did a Disability awareness talk at work with a few colleagues. It was good, and great to see my company wanting to talk about disability and open up the conversation, however it was probably also the hardest talk I have done! I am used to public speaking, but I think it was the fact I knew who I was speaking to (colleagues) and I am trying to be seen in a professional capacity, and then by explaining all about my disability/illness you are kind of changing that and showing your vulnerability. Nevertheless, I think we are all human and increasing people’s understanding can be nothing but a positive. I found my colleagues very supportive.\n\nChristianity\n\nLast year I don’t think I did so well with this, but this year I want to strengthen my faith. I have just started ‘The Bible Course’ so this is a good start.\n\nIt maybe a bit late but Happy New Year!\n\nDo you have any plans for 2023?\n\nHannah x"
