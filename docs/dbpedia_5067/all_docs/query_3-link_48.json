        "text": "We’re changing the way wellness gets delivered for over 34,000 people annually across Michigan.\n\nSometimes what we do looks like healthcare. Sometimes it looks more like a social service. It can even look like a ride from one place to the other. Whatever the case, it’s pretty much impossible to define what Hope Network is. So instead, we just say that we help people overcome.\n\nWhen others say, “You’re on your own.” We step in and say differently.\n\nOver the years, Hope Network has filled essential care gaps across Michigan communities. And the gaps are there because the work is hard. It’s the work that society doesn’t always see or celebrate. But it’s what we’ve been called to do. And we’ve always answered.\n\nOur highly diverse and talented workforce is the foundation to our success.\n\nWe actively seek applicants who desire to make a difference in their community, while working alongside people from all walks of life. Hope Network is committed to fostering environments where everyone feels valued and respected, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital or family status, national origin, ability status, age or veteran status. Visit our careers page to learn how you can make a difference while working for an organization that values who you are.\n\nYes, we’re hiring. And we’ll make your search easy.\n\nGive us some details and we’ll show you opportunities in your area. No matter your story or skill level, there’s a good chance we have a job for you."
