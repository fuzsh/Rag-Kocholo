        "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - This month marks 16 years for Kentucky CancerLink, helping people navigate a cancer diagnosis and helping people get lifesaving screenings.\n\nThe Central Kentucky organization has touched thousands of lives.\n\nKentucky CancerLink started out in a very different way but with the same mission of saving lives.\n\nWhen Vickie Blevins Booth owned a mastectomy boutique, she was able to help countless women who were battling breast cancer, and she also listened to a lot of their concerns.\n\n“I heard all kinds of stories in the fitting room about needs and what was needed,” said Vickie Blevins Booth.\n\nBlevins Booth realized because of barriers with cost of treatment and care, there was a need to connect women with resources available in the community.\n\nInspired by a patient navigation program in New York, she set out to bring something similar to central Kentucky.\n\n“Basically, our concept was patient navigation, which was really new to the world of cancer patients being navigated by lay navigators, and I just saw an opportunity to bring that to Kentucky,” said Blevins Booth.\n\nIn 2008, she started the nonprofit Kentucky Pink Connection, aimed at supporting breast cancer patients and women in need of screening.\n\nShe quickly started to hear from the women she helped about others in need.\n\n“You were able to help me when I had breast cancer, but now my sister has lung cancer, and it was really heartbreaking to have to limit our services,” said Blevins Booth.\n\nIn 2014 Blevins Booth and h. board took a leap of faith deciding to expand to all cancers and Kentucky CancerLink was born.\n\nMelissa Karrer is the Executive Director of Kentucky CancerLink.\n\n“When I first came to know the organization as Kentucky Pink Connection I was going through a diagnosis, Vickie was actually the person who answered the phone when I called,” said Melissa Karrer.\n\nIn the early days she was a volunteer and has seen firsthand how important Kentucky CancerLink is in the state.\n\n“I think at this point, since 2008, we are over 35,000 Kentuckians served,” said Karrer.\n\nOperating on grants and donations, Kentucky CancerLink uses those funds to make the state healthier.\n\n“We work hard to utilize the resources that we are given to go directly towards our programs,” said Karrer.\n\nAnd for board member Drew Perry, who has watched friends and family utilize Kentucky CancerLink it’s why he’s committed to helping grow the mission Vickie Blevins Booth started in leading the way in patient navigation for cancer care in Kentucky.\n\n“This is the type of impact I want to have to take the legacy Vickie has built, the foundation and make sure it grows for countless years,” said Drew Perry."
