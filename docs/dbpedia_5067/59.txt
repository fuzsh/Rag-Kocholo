PINK HOPE - our take on a beautiful tonal pink shade for October - breast cancer awareness month.

YARN - DEWY DK WEIGHT - 70% Superwash Merino Wool, 20% Nylon, 10% Silk

This yarn is sumptuous. Ultra-soft and squishy, and sure to be a favorite. Machine-washable, with a hint of "dewy" glow from the silk and strength and longevity from the nylon. I had the mill spin this custom yarn to these exact specs so you'd have a versatile DK weight yarn not only beautiful to look at but also delightful to work with.

•4-ply: This produces a round, plump yarn, for beautiful, defined stitches!

•DK Weight (stands for Double Knitting): This weight of yarn is thinner than worsted weight and thicker than sport weight. It's incredibly versatile and can knitted or crocheted into an endless number of wonderful items. All types of accessories from head to toe...sweaters are amazzzing... soft, cozy, long-wearing afghans, and loads more. This yarn is ideal for baby items too, due to the softness and ability to be machine-washed.

•Yardage: 228 m / 250 yd

•Weight: 113 g / 4 oz

Note: Each skein is a hand-created, unique work of art and no two skeins will be identical, even within the same dye lot. If working with more than one skein in a project, it is best to alternate skeins every other row. Despite every effort to accurately depict our product colors, actual shades may vary due to differences in monitor settings.
