Pink Hands of Hope was founded in 2009 by Brian and Laurie Gaughen. After Laurie was diagnosed with breast cancer, they struggled to get the financial assistance needed and were burdened with a huge financial debt due to medical bills. They vowed to help others struggling with the same financial situation and Pink Hands of Hope was born.

​

They started a thrift store to help fund various programs. Pink Hands has grown yearly, increasing the number of people who helped and adapting programs to meet the ever-changing needs of those they serve.

​

Since 2009, we've assisted over 5,000 patients, but our success relies on the support of our community.
