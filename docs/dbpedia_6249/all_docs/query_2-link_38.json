        "text": "A proposed subdivision off New Leicester Highway is moving closer to reality after being approved Tuesday night, Feb. 13, by the Buncombe County Board of Adjustment.\n\nThe proposed project, called Pentland Hills, is a 69-unit development with a mix of single-family homes and attached single-family homes, of which at least 75% are to be affordable.\n\nJoe Quinlan, home ownership manager at Mountain Housing Opportunities (MHO), defined affordable housing as not costing a buyer more than one-third of their income while serving members of the community who are earning 80% of the area median income or less.\n\nQuinlan said the proposed project on Pentland Hills Drive will be very similar to Lillie Farm Cove, an award-winning MHO development in Weaverville.\n\n“There I think we hit more like 80-85% affordable and mixed in just a few unrestricted sales,” Quinlan said.\n\nHe estimated most of the homes will appraise for over $300,000 each, which he said will be out of the range for many of the families his nonprofit is trying to serve.\n\n“What that means for us is, many of these families will qualify a certain amount of a first mortgage,\" he said. \"It won’t be enough to buy the house. We never sell our houses for less than their value, we never make a gift of equity to anybody. We will lend these families what they need in the form of soft-second financing so that we’re lending them the difference between their first mortgage and what the house appraises for.”\n\nQuinlan said there are no payments or traditional interest on the money they lend, and the loans increase in value at the same rate as the homes.\n\nBut the nonprofit is not on its own.\n\nDogwood Health Trust gave $1 million in grant money on the condition that 75% of the homes are affordable.\n\nAdditionally, the United States Agricultural Department is helping with first mortgages.\n\nAs for the next steps, the land is purchased and MHO is awaiting staff approval from Buncombe County."
