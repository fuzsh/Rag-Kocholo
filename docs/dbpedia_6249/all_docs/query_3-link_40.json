        "text": "Nursery Admissions\n\nParents who would like their child to be considered for a place in Granby's Nursery should ensure they place their child’s name on the waiting list as soon as possible after the child’s 2nd birthday. This can be done by filling in an application form, which is available online or from the school office.\n\nGranby offer a morning session from 8.45am to 11.45am or an afternoon session from 12.30pm to 3.30pm and we currently have 39 places in each session. When you apply for a place in our Nursery you will be asked for your preference for a morning or afternoon session. Where the requests for a particular session are greater than the number of places available, priority will be given to pupils living nearest to the school [calculated using the Leicester City system].\n\nOur full criteria for allocating places is as follows:\n\nPupils who live in the local community and are likely to attend Granby Primary School\n\nPupils who are in the care of the Local Authority\n\nPupils who are on the list of children subject to child protection plans and need to attend an alternative school to avoid the abuser\n\nChildren of parents or carers fleeing domestic violence [subject to verification by a senior social worker or current Leicester City Council procedures for housing reallocation in cases of recognised domestic violence]\n\nPupils who live in the catchment area of the school and have a sibling who will still be in the school when the applicant starts\n\nPupils who live outside the catchment area of the school and have a sibling who will still be in the school when the applicant starts\n\nPupils who live in the catchment area of the school\n\nGranby also offer extended Nursery provision which will provide childcare for the other half of the day and lunchtime, enabling parents or carers to access a full day of childcare from 8.45am to 3.30pm. There are facilities for children to have a nap in our sleep room and children need to bring a packed lunch with them. Availability is limited and there is a charge for the extended part of the care – please enquire at the school office for the current rate.\n\nPlease note: having a place in Granby's Nursery does not automatically guarantee your child a place in one of our Reception classes. Allocation of Reception places is managed by the Local Authority.\n\n30 Hours Free Childcare\n\nAll 3 and 4 year olds in England already get 15 hours a week, or 570 hours a year, of free early education. If their parents are living and working in England, 3 and 4 year olds may be entitled to 30 hours free childcare: an extra 570 hours of free childcare a year, so 1140 hours in total. 30 hours free childcare has been available since September 2017. The eligibility criteria are the same as those for tax-free childcare, except that you can continue to get these types of support at the same time as receiving 30 hours free childcare:\n\ntax credits\n\nuniversal credit\n\nchildcare vouchers or salary sacrifice schemes\n\nchildcare grants and bursaries\n\nWhen you apply for 30 hours free childcare, you'll be confirming that you need childcare so that you and your partner, if you have one, can work. If your child is already in a full-time Reception class in a state funded school, you won't be eligible for 30 hours free childcare.\n\nDo I Qualify?\n\nThe following guide can be used to identify if you may be eligible for 30 hours free childcare. Answering 'yes' to these questions does not guarantee parents are eligible – you will still need to register and present us with an eligible DERN code to qualify. However, if you are able to answer 'yes' to all four questions, this is a good indication that you might qualify for 30 hours free childcare:\n\nAre you, and your partner if applicable, both in employment?\n\nDo you, and your partner if applicable, both earn a weekly wage that is equivalent to 16 hours at National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage? From April 2017 this equates to:\n\n£120.00 per week if aged 25+ years\n\n£112.80 per week if aged 21-24 years\n\n£89.60 per week if aged 18-20 years\n\n£64.80 per week if aged 16-17 years\n\nDo you, or your partner if applicable, both earn less than £100,000 per person, per year?\n\nDo you have parental responsibility for the child you are enquiring about?\n\nMore information about 30 hours free childcare can be found in our information booklet:\n\nPrimary School Admissions [Reception to Year 6]\n\nParents who would like their child to be considered for a place in one of Granby's Reception classes, or any other year group, should apply through Leicester City Council as admissions for full-time compulsory schooling is the responsibility of the Local Authority and not individual schools. More information about this can be found on the Leicester City Council Starting Primary School Page. Please also consult the Leicester City Council Admissions Policy.\n\nChildren start full-time education in the September after their 4th Birthday and places are allocated subject to availability. Granby has two classes per year group with 30 places per class. However, we have adopted Leicester City Council’s overspill policy and, subject to certain conditions, we can take up to 31 pupils in some classes.\n\nThe Local Authority's criteria for allocating places is as follows:\n\nPupils who are in the care of the Local Authority\n\nPupils who are on the list of children subject to child protection plans and need to attend an alternative school to avoid the abuser\n\nChildren of parents or carers fleeing domestic violence [subject to verification by a senior social worker or current Leicester City Council procedures for housing reallocation in cases of recognised domestic violence]\n\nPupils who live in the catchment area of the school and have a sibling who will still be in the school when the applicant starts\n\nPupils who live outside the catchment area of the school and have a sibling who will still be in the school when the applicant starts\n\nPupils who live in the catchment area of the school\n\nPupils who live outside the catchment area of the school\n\nTiebreaker: pupils who live closest to the school [measured in a straight line]\n\nThe contact details for the Leicester City School Admissions Team are:\n\nSchool Admissions\n\nLeicester City Council\n\nCity Hall\n\n115 Charles Street\n\nLeicester\n\nLE1 1FZ\n\nwww.leicester.gov.uk/admissions\n\n0116 454 1009\n\nadmissions.online@leicester.gov.uk\n\nParents have a right of appeal and if you do not get a place at your chosen school. Appeals are dealt with by the Leicester City Council School Admissions Team. Granby is unable to support or decline an application once a decision has been made by the Local Authority.\n\nSecondary School Admissions [Year 7 to Year 11]\n\nGranby has excellent links with all of the secondary schools our pupils transfer to and we work closely with them to ensure that children's transition to secondary school is a positive experience. Children leave Granby feeling well prepared and excited to move onto the next stage of their learning journey. Children have opportunities to visit different secondary schools and meet the staff. The secondary schools hold open evenings where you can hear from the headteacher and have a tour of the school. This will help you to decide where to send your child.\n\nMore information about moving to secondary school can be found on the Leicester City Council Starting Secondary School Page. Please also consult the Leicester City Council Admissions Policy. Links to the websites of the some of the schools Granby pupils typically transfer to can be found below:\n\nCountesthorpe Academy\n\nFullhurst Community College\n\nLancaster Academy\n\nLutterworth High School\n\nSir Jonathan North Girls' College\n\nTudor Grange Samworth Academy\n\nWigston Academy"
