We aim to establish a unique, clear and logical address with an accurate location for each property.\n\nA registered address is important for:\n\nPost to be delivered to the right location\n\nEmergency services to find a property quickly\n\nThe occupier to access many services and utilities\n\nVisitors to find where they want to go\n\nNumbering of new properties\n\nOwners/developers will encounter difficulties in obtaining mail, goods and services if they do not have an official address; for example, when registering with utility services, applying for a credit card or ordering goods.\n\nIt is very important that owners and developers apply to us for the street numbering process as soon as possible after work on any new build or conversion starts.\n\nOnce we have issued a development or property with numbers, we pass the information on to Royal Mail, utility companies, emergency services, council departments and other organisations.\n\nOwners/developers need to ensure every property is clearly labelled with its official number to reduce problems with property location.\n\nLarge developments\n\nLarge developments which include new roads must contact us first, as numbers cannot be issued until a new road name has been approved. Please see the 'street naming' link above.\n\nOn new developments it is council policy not to issue numbers to individual plots until work has started on laying foundations.\n\nPostcodes\n\nRoyal Mail will only issue a postcode to new addresses received from us. Developers should inform Royal Mail when a property is occupied so the address can be made live on their database.\n\nIf you are having problems with your address or postcode please contact Royal Mail to check they have the address registered. If Royal Mail do not have the address or it is not correct please contact us.\n\nContact us"
