        "text": "The views of the mountains and the scenery here is SPECTACULAR! I would say it is the best in this category of any surrounding towns of Asheville. The downside and everyone who lives here says it- Restaurants/ cozy eateries, definitely not enough to sustain this growing community. Very little restrictions on businesses we have way too many junk car businesses that look terrible and if Another Tire shop with stacked tires against New Lei Hwy goes in I will lose my mind. This is actually is illegal in certain states. I would love to see this change and the tires placed behind the business not exposed to the street. Would love Leicester to keep its beautiful rolling farmland and still get a little more shopping and restaurants. Otherwise it is a great community to live in and we love that the city of Asheville with so much to do and the rich culture, nightlife,breweries, fabulous restaurants and shopping is just 15 min away. Wish we had a little charming downtown like Waynesville + BlkMtn\n\nLiving in Leicester has been wonderful. Leicester is a quiet country town right outside of Asheville. Being just close enough to town for shopping and dining, but not close enough that the magic of the quiet country setting is disturbed. With breath taking mountain views and the wonderful sounds of the surrounding nature it's just absolutely mesmerizing. However, like most towns and cities, Leicester is continuously growing. Meaning more houses, businesses, and roads are being put throughout Leicester. This disrupts the beautiful nature we have surrounding us. If I could change anything about Leicester I would change the growth so we can keep the magic of nature.\n\nI really love living in my subdivision,gives me a suburban feel,yet sitting on my deck I see great mountain views.I pull out my gate and I'm in rural farm and country areas.Love the small town feel,no traffic,no noise.Would go 5 stars if we had a small town downtown like Black Mountain or Waynesville.If you want to go out you must drive to these places or downtown Asheville,not a bad thing,but wish we had more eateries in town."
