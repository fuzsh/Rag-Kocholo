        "text": "Stevan Ratkovic\n\nAs a former and current business owner, I’ve developed a strong work ethic and a customer-focused approach that I bring to my real estate career! Having had my real estate license for years, I bring a unique perspective and fresh approach to the business. I’m very passionate about connecting people with their dream properties through personalized and seamless real estate experiences! Prior to becoming a real estate agent, I’ve worked in various engineering industries and business ownership, where I’ve honed my skills in communication, attention to detail and analytics. I earned a B.S. in Systems Engineering from University of Arkansas at Little Rock and gained my fundamentals of engineering licensure in 2013. After moving to Northwest Arkansas in 2019, I worked for J.B. Hunt while starting a business. I was fortunate enough to be able to go full time on this new business adventure until selling it in late 2022. This allowed me to go back into my passion of real estate! My passion for real estate is evident in everything I do. I take the time to listen to clients' needs and provide personalized service to ensure that they achieve their real estate goals. Whether you're buying or selling a home, I am dedicated to making the process as stress-free and enjoyable as possible! In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my wife and fur baby Oakley! We love to enjoy the outdoors, be it kayaking, hiking, camping, or golfing. As an avid Arkansas Razorbacks fan, we try to catch a baseball or football game as much as we can! I believe that a healthy work-life balance is essential for success in any career, and I strive to maintain that balance in my life. If you're looking for a motivated and detail-oriented real estate agent who will work tirelessly to help you achieve your real estate goals, look no further. Contact me today to schedule a consultation and take the first step toward buying or selling your home!\n\nLearn More"
