It is composed of tiny threads that are airborne and offer a serious health risk if inhaled over an extended period of time. However, the building industry continues to use this substance, which annually results in thousands of illnesses.\n\nLong-term exposure to microfibres increases the risk of developing lung cancer and lung illness at high exposure levels. Since the majority of people aren't even aware that it's in their homes, knowledge of this substance is crucial to consumer education.
