After 15 years in the NBA, an inspiring comeback and three titles, Shaun Livingston is calling it a career.

The former Golden State Warriors guard, who began his career with the Los Angeles Clippers, announced his decision in an Instagram post Friday.

"I’m excited, sad, fortunate and grateful all in one breath," Livingston wrote. "Hard to put into a caption all of the emotions it takes to try and accomplish your dreams."

One of the top high school players in the country, Livingston committed to Duke but then opted to head straight for the NBA draft, and the Clippers selected him fourth overall in 2004.

Injuries hampered the early years of his career, but a debilitating leg injury on Feb. 26, 2007, nearly ended it. It would take him more than a year to be cleared for basketball activities, and he sat out the entire 2007-08 season.

Livingston bounced around the league once healthy, playing stints for Miami, Oklahoma City, Washington, Charlotte and Milwaukee. His career renaissance took off with the Brooklyn Nets starting in the 2013-14 season, when he played 76 games. That offseason, he signed with the Warriors and joined the team for its run of three championships in five years. Along the way, he served as a steadying, veteran presence off the bench.

"I wasn’t supposed to be here," he wrote. "Anybody that has beat the odds understands the mental and emotional strain it takes to inspire yourself on an uphill war, let alone inspire others. 'The injury' gave me a chance to find and prove to myself (and the world) that I wouldn’t be defined by my circumstances."
