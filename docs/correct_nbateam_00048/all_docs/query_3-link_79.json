        "text": "What an exciting time for football. And with the Super Bowl around the corner, you might as well make sure you have your appetizers and snacks in order. Whether you’re excited about the game, the insane commercials, or the halftime show, it’s certain that most people will be chowing down on apps.\n\nLast year, a study found that appetizers make up most people’s diets on gameday. Interestingly, 70% of people skip the entrée and stick to appetizers on Super Bowl Sunday. This study also found that 41% say they tend to overeat.\n\nAnother study found that more than half of people look forward to game day parties because of the food. Also, highlighted is that 74% of people plan to make food at home. Meanwhile, 26% plan to order from restaurants. Either way, there will be food.\n\nGame Day Crowd-Pleasers\n\nTaste of Home compiled a list of what they consider to be the best of the best when it comes to apps. Their top five include an antipasto platter with meat and cheese cubes, pepper jelly hogs in a blanket, beef Wellington fried wontons, fruit charcuterie board, and ham and Swiss sliders.\n\nThere’s something for everyone from last-minute party throwers to ambitious hosts. If you’re looking for something quick chips and dip is a go. If you’re looking for something with a bit of pizazz, maybe try a quesadilla ring.\n\nThis year’s Super Bowl will be held on Sunday, Feb. 11. Kickoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. EST. Whether you’re tuning in for the game, watching for the commercials, or just want to see Usher’s halftime show, make sure you have your snacks ready to go.\n\nThere are many game day apps you can add to the menu, from wings, dips, and sliders, to desserts, and breads. Check out these appetizers that will make watching the game even more fun."
