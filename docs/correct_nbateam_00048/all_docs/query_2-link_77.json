        "text": "The Promise\n\nHe was the fourth pick in the 2004 NBA draft (five picks ahead of future teammate Andre Iguodala), a 6-7 guard that the Clippers hoped would be their Magic Johnson. In his second season, the once hapless Clippers had ended a nine-year playout drought and won their first playoff series in 30 years when they were the Buffalo Braves.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nBy his third season, after missing 73-games in his first two seasons, Shaun Livingston was beginning to show promise as the future of the franchise. That year, he had only missed two games and worked his way into the starting lineup averaging 9.3 games per game. On February 24, 2007, he had a double-double – 14 points and assists as the Clippers beat division rival Golden State.\n\nTwo days later, in their next game against the Charlotte Bobcats, disaster struck early in the first quarter. In a gruesome injury, which was even gruesome listening on radio as I recall the sound of his screams, Livingston suffered a dislocated left knee cap and broken left leg, in addition to tearing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and lateral meniscus and having sprained his medial collateral ligament. It is one of the worst basketball injuries many had seen and there was a real risk that his leg might need to be amputated. Ultimately, he would have to relearn how to walk.\n\nThe Retirement\n\nRemarkably, twelve years later when Shaun Livingston announced his retirement from the NBA it triggered an outpouring of emotion from the league, reporters, and fans. As Dan Woike, brilliantly pointed out in his Los Angeles Times column, Livingston’s career numbers hardly merit any great celebration.\n\nBut the numbers aren’t a complete representation of the truth. Basketball isn’t just points — it has soul, it reveals character and requires sacrifice and perseverance. Those are the reasons we, the basketball community, care that Livingston announced his NBA career has ended. Those are the reasons his exit has inspired articles and blog posts from all over the country.\n\nPeople care because the worst day of Livingston’s pro basketball life — when his leg was so badly injured that doctors feared amputation — was so awful. And it’s because the best days of Livingston’s were so wonderful, the ones where he held up NBA championship trophies. In a time where no one can seemingly agree upon anything, everyone in and around the NBA is happy that Livingston’s story got to end this way.\n\nThe fact that Livingston had a 15-year NBA career is one of the greatest comeback stories in basketball.\n\nThe Comeback\n\nAfter his injury, Livingston would not play an NBA game until October 2008 – although he would play only 12 games that season with Miami and Oklahoma City. The next season, OKC waived Livingston after 29 games and he was picked up by the struggling Washington Wizards. Two weeks later, he played 30:54 and erupted for 18 points and 8 assists. He was in the starting lineup the rest of the season, scoring in double figures in 9 of his last 11 games – including a career-high 25 points against the Boston Celtics (who would go to the NBA Finals that year).\n\nLivingston landed in Charlotte for the 2010-11 season where he reached another milestone – playing 73 games, the most he had played at the point in his career. After stints in Milwaukee, Washington and Cleveland with increasing minutes, Livingston’s breakout season came in the 2013-14 season with the Brooklyn Nets where he started 54 of the 76 games averaging 8.2 points and 4.5 assists per game.\n\nIn 2014, the Golden State Warriors signed him as a backup for Steph Curry. For the next five seasons, Livingston was an important part of the Warrior machine that reached five-consecutive NBA Finals – even scoring 20 points to lead the Warriors to victory in Game 1 of the 2016 NBA Finals.\n\nFor Livingston, the comeback was complete – he was a three-time NBA champion.\n\nAnd a champion in life.\n\nThat is why the NBA and basketball fans took a few moments this week to reflect on what Shaun had accomplished. He had gone as low as an athlete can and never gave up until he was a champion.\n\nI had hoped that the Clippers might sign Livingston to allow him to retire where his career began. It would have been especially appropriate since Clipper star Lou William’s first jersey was Livingston’s.\n\nUnfortunately, it was not to be. I suspect, Livingston will play a role in the Warriors organization and we will have not seen the last of him. Either way, I have nothing but admiration for the man and wish him and his family well."
