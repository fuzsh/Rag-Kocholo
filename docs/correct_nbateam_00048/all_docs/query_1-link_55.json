        "text": "When the Golden State Warriors were running the NBA, they were an appealing team to veteran free agents. Players like David West, Shaun Livingston and DeMarcus Cousins all signed with the Dubs at different points between 2014 and 2018.\n\nNow, another former All-Star says he would welcome the opportunity to join the Warriors. Isaiah Thomas took to Twitter and responded to current Los Angeles Lakers’ forward Jared Dudley, who reminded the NBA world not to sleep on Golden State next season.\n\nFuture Hall of Famer Dwyane Wade seems to like the idea:\n\nThomas isn’t close to being the same player he was when he averaged 27.6 points per game for the Boston Celtics over three seasons before being traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the summer of 2017. He has played on three different teams since then, with his most recent stop being with the Washington Wizards. Thomas put up 12.2 points and 3.7 assists for the Wizards before being traded to the L.A. Clippers, who waived him after the deal.\n\nDefensive issues make Thomas a liability. He’s only 5’9 and struggles guarding bigger guards. His average net rating over the past four seasons is -18, and his defensive rating hasn’t been lower than 113 during that span, per basketball reference.\n\nAs much as Thomas wants this, I don’t see the fit with the Dubs. Golden State needs bigger wing defenders to come off the bench, something Thomas clearly isn’t. He can still contribute on the offensive end, but he is more of an isolation guy who needs the ball in his hands to be effective. That won’t happen in head coach Steve Kerr’s system, who emphasizes ball movement and sharing the rock. The one aspect he would bring his outside shooting. He shot 41.3% from deep last season, and is a career 36.4% shooter from beyond the arc.\n\nIf general manager Bob Myers is looking to bolster the bench, Thomas could be had for the veterans minimum.\n\nHow do you feel about Thomas lobbying to join the Warriors? Would you like to see Myers take a chance on him?\n\nOn to some links:\n\nWith the NBA Draft Lottery coming up on Thursday, we will finally know where Golden State will be picking in the top five. Patrick Murray of Forbes looks at the different ways the Dubs can approach the selection.\n\nAlvin Gentry was an assistant coach on the 2015 NBA championship winning Warriors. He will be looking for a new gig, after being fired by the New Orleans Pelicans. (ESPN)"
