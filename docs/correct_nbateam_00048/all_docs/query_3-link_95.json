        "text": "NBA Summer League action is about to start really ramping up and a couple of former Kentucky Wildcats will help get the ball rolling.\n\nSummer League technically began on Saturday, July 6 out in California, but with just six teams and only one player with a UK connection — veteran wing Kevin Knox — who has seen any action thus far. Knox played in one of two games for the Golden State Warriors, finishing with seven points (3-10 FG), four rebounds, and five assists in 19 minutes during a 92-68 win over Dalton Knecht and the Los Angeles Lakers (Bronny James sat out this contest) on Sunday night.\n\nAt just 24 years old, Knox isn’t by any means old, but compared to most Summer League rosters, he’s on the side of looking for a shot at redemption instead of trying to establish himself as an up-and-comer. A couple of those up-and-comers will actually be on your TV screens tonight.\n\nJustin Edwards and the Philadelphia 76ers will take on Tre Mitchell and the Oklahoma City Thunder (which also rosters Oakland’s Jack Gohlke) at 7:00 p.m. EST on ESPN in the first game of the Salt Lake City (which includes just four teams) portion of Summer League.\n\nDespite not hearing his name called on Draft night a couple of weeks ago, Edwards was immediately picked up on a two-way contract by the 76ers. Mitchell didn’t have to wait long either before signing a Summer League deal with OKC. For both, this is the first step in hopefully making a roster for the start of the 2024-25 season.\n\nSummer League will fully pick up starting on Friday, July 12 when all 30 NBA teams take the hardwood in Las Vegas until July 22. Along with the three former ‘Cats mentioned above, the likes of Oscar Tshiebwe (Pacers), Reed Sheppard (Rockets), Rob Dillingham (Timberwolves), and Antonio Reeves (Pelicans) will also suit up."
