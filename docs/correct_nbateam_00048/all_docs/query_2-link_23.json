        "text": "The Oklahoma City Thunder have signed former first round draft pick and Los Angeles Clipper point guard Shaun Livingston to a multiyear contract.\n\nThunder vice president and general manager Sam Presti announced the signing Tuesday. Terms of the agreement were not announced, although it likely runs through the end of this season as well as the next one.\n\nLivingston is a 6-foot-7 guard who's averaged 9.5 points, 6.0 assists and 3.5 rebounds in 11 games with the Tulsa 66ers of the NBA Developmental League.\n\nLivingston was drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers with the fourth overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft and has played in 149 NBA games with the Clippers and Miami.\n\nHe showed considerable potential when he was on the court, but also injury prone. That was capped by a horrific knee injury that took him out of basketball for a couple years."
