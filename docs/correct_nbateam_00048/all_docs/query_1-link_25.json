        "text": "To understand Shaun Livingston, you have to put on special glasses. The full picture of his value — all the beauty and greatness, the intricate details in the tapestry of his career — requires a certain vision.\n\nNo doubt, when Livingston announced he was retiring from the NBA on Friday, he ended what was nothing short of an admirable career. Livingston is a coach’s dream in the locker room. He is an adjunct professor among pro hoopers. He is a role model for young players. All of that is true.\n\nBut what is most admirable about Livingston is knowing him. Those who do are better for it, and that’s about the best thing one can say about a person.\n\n“Dot’s a legend,” David West said via text. Livingston’s teammates called him Dot, a spinoff of S-Dot, as in S. Livingston. Jay-Z, whose government name is Sean Carter, made it a popular nickname for “S” names with his 1999 song “S. Carter.”\n\n“He came back from an injury that would have sealed the fate of most players,” West said. “He had a determination that should be admired for years to come. Great teammate and even better person. Proud to call him a friend.”\n\nLivingston didn’t just overcome a devastating leg injury. It’s too simple to digest what happened to him as coming back from injury. It was way deeper than that. Yes, he managed to play 11 more seasons after nearly needing his leg amputated. It is a feat of resilience and incomprehensible mental toughness.\n\nBut Livingston still lost quite a bit from that injury.\n\nTo see Livingston, to really see him, you have to understand contentment.\n\nHe was a prodigy coming out of Peoria, Ill. He wasn’t taken No. 4 overall by the Clippers in 2004 just to average 6.3 points and 3.0 assists for his career. Livingston had superstar written all over him. He was a 6-foot-7 point guard with exceptional handles and court vision. Man, Livingston could pass. He could get to where he wanted on the court. He could take off and bang on somebody. He was the next Penny Hardaway, carved from the Magic Johnson lineage of tall point guards.\n\nAnd point guards were becoming the rage. Baron Davis was an All-Star in New Orleans the year before Livingston was drafted. Steve Nash was MVP in Livingston’s rookie year. Chris Paul came another year later, won Rookie of the Year and was unofficially crowned the future. Chauncey Billups had turned Detroit into a winner. What we see now — this historical era of dominant point guards — had started in earnest.\n\nAnd players with size having point-guard skills? They were extra special. LeBron James was drafted in 2003. Tracy McGrady was in the prime of his Hall of Fame career. And here was Livingston, combining the height of a small forward with the skills of a true point guard. He was supposed to be mentioned with the best of them. He had that kind of talent.\n\nAnd then he suffered that terrible injury. And all that went away. And then he proved he had even more character than talent.\n\nHis greatest feat wasn’t getting back on the court. It wasn’t lasting physically. It was having the security and contentment to be at peace with his new existence. He didn’t waste his potential; he was robbed of it. It would be one thing if he just didn’t live up to expectations. He didn’t get that kind of closure but the ever-present question of what might have been.\n\nHis situation was a ripe environment for resentment. The NBA culture of compare and contrast was proven fertilizer to grow Livingston into a malcontent. But Livingston didn’t get bitter, he got better. He got over the money he lost by appreciating the perspective he gained.\n\nAfter all these seasons, you didn’t hear a story of him beefing or rumors of him having a problem with management. You only hear people rave about him. You only see some of the biggest names in the game respect him as an OG.\n\nThat’s because Livingston is sure of himself. Not in an arrogant way, but in a way that brings comfort to others. He has peace — not merely the absence of conflict but the willingness to accept it whenever it comes.\n\nWith all the money and fame and access NBA players have, they are an insecure lot. Their competitive natures don’t turn off. The anxiousness and tension don’t just sprout up in tense moments on the court. They can be jealous and petty, selfish and immature, stubborn and frustrating — just like anybody else would be in their shoes. But it only makes Livingston stand out. He carries himself in a way that suggests he is unaffected.\n\nTo be sure, Livingston is affected. He is like all professional athletes. He has insurmountable belief in himself. He has thoughts and opinions. He sees way more than he says and, if he can look you in the eye, he can give you some game. Give you that quick head nod or that one raised brow OGs use for emphasis.\n\nThat’s why to see Livingston, to really see him, you have to understand sacrifice.\n\nFor example, Livingston believed he could do more for the Warriors. Especially in the first few years.\n\nIn Game 6 of the 2015 NBA Finals, he and Draymond Green were the only two to play the entire fourth quarter. Remember when Stephen Curry got hurt in the 2016 playoffs? Of the seven games Livingston started in that postseason, he averaged 14.8 points. In two other games, when Curry played but Livingston got at least 20 minutes, Livingston totaled 19 assists. Then Curry had the “I’m back” game in the second round against Portland and Livingston went back to bench duty. He played 25 minutes or more just once the rest of the postseason — Game 1 against Cleveland — and he had 20 points on 10 shots with four assists.\n\nThink he didn’t believe he should have played more than 16 minutes in the Game 7 they lost? Of course he did.\n\nI remember asking him once why he didn’t run the point. He was used primarily as a low-post scorer. When that became harder to do, because of his legs and because of an alerted defense, I wondered why the Warriors didn’t mix it up and put him at point. He still had the handle. He still had the vision. Instead of putting him on the baseline to go 1-on-1, where the only option is to score, put him at the top and do the same thing but with passing options.\n\nHis answer was so simple: “That’s not my role in this offense.”\n\nI asked him if he still had that wheel and deal in his game.\n\n“You know I still got that.”\n\nHe smiled, nodded and jogged off to go into practice.\n\nFor Livingston, the focus never seemed to be about what he thought he should be doing but what he could be doing. If he wasn’t getting minutes, how else could he help? His answer was encouraging teammates. Keeping a pulse in the locker room, especially closely watching guys who were struggling or in a bad space. Speaking up when it was time for him to use his voice.\n\nLivingston found as much value in being a good teammate as he did in unleashing his own game. That was his game, too.\n\nIt does make you wonder what is happening to the league. The fact he is just announcing this suggests, as the behind-the-scenes chatter said, he was trying to keep playing. It seems he couldn’t find a home. If so, what does that say about the league?\n\nIs there no team that needs a guy like Livingston on their bench? Is there no longer a roster spot for OGs in residency to groom young players, influence a locker room and every now and again hit a mid-range jumper?\n\nThat would be a sad day when good guys who did everything right can’t keep a job. Livingston is someone you want around your young players.\n\nBut to see Livingston, to really see him, you have to understand genuine.\n\nHe really appreciated winning. He really liked being around the guys. He really liked good conversation.\n\nI’ve seen him pull a reporter aside and compliment a piece. I’ve also seen him politely chastise a reporter about a piece in defense of his teammates. I’ve heard him be critical about himself and I’ve heard him break down what a teammate needs to work on. I’ve seen him give that look-you-in-the-eye thank you to the workers most others overlook.\n\nLivingston is an old soul clinging to the value of meaning what you say and saying meaningful things.\n\n“The greatest gift we can give is service to others.”\n\nThat was how Livingston ended his retirement announcement on Instagram. At some point after his horrific injury, Livingston recalibrated. He set out to make his mark on the league as a premier point guard. He shifted gears. He still got some buckets, dropped some dimes, won some ‘chips. But he wound up making his mark on the league as a premier person.\n\nIt was a sight to see."
