        "text": "Livingston had gotten waived by the Oklahoma City Thunder before the Washington Wizards signed him in 2010. Saunders gave him more than just a shot to play in Washington. Livingston became a regular starter with the Wizards and for the first time since suffering his major knee injury. “After playing the season with him, I just felt like I understood the NBA game, and that was the first time I really understood it,” Livingston said of Saunders. “I always had a high IQ, but just as far as time and score and just as a pro, he was a guard’s coach. “He gave me the opportunity to implant me back into the NBA. Just to be somewhat relevant again…he gave me an opportunity. He blessed me an opportunity and allowed me to a chance to make the most of it.”\n\nNormally among the mellower players in the NBA, Livingston felt pushed to the edge not only by what was being said but also by the physical hijinks of Clippers star Blake Griffin. Livingston was particularly annoyed that Griffin was so animated during a preseason game.\n\nStoryline: Clippers-Warriors Beef\n\n“He’s going with all these antics; just play,” Livingston said. “He’s out here wrapping me up, putting elbows to my forehead. Ok. I understand. Don’t get me wrong. They want to beat us. “That’s just what you have to deal with. I see it. I recognize it.”\n\nWalton compared Livingston’s situation to one of his former teammates on one of the Los Angeles Lakers’ championship teams. Trevor Ariza after hardly attempting any 3-pointers at the start of his career gradually developed one in Los Angeles and now continues to shoot them at a high volume. Walton smiled and says he has a bet with Livingston that the 30-year-old owes push-ups when he has an open look at a 3-pointer and doesn’t shoot."
