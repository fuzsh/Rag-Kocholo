        "text": "Shaun Livingston. NBA champion.\n\nEleven years after he graduated from Peoria High School and was picked fourth in the National Basketball Association draft, Livingston last week won the 2015 NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nAs a child, Livingston dazzled Peoria playgrounds with his ball-handling skills. While at Concordia Lutheran School, a national scouting service ranked him the second-best seventh-grade player in America. He struggled through two years at Richwoods High School before blossoming at Peoria High, where the Lions won back-to-back state titles and Livingston was named Illinois Mr. Basketball in 2004. He had signed to play at Duke University, but opted to go straight to the NBA.\n\nIn 2007, during his third season with the Los Angeles Clippers, the 6-foot-7 Livingston was starting point guard for a playoff team, and stardom was predicted. But in February, he landed awkwardly on a routine layup and shredded his left knee. Damage was so severe, doctors discussed the possible necessity of amputating his leg. That didn’t happen, but Livingston’s career was derailed. The Clippers released him. Few people thought he’d play pro basketball again.\n\nOver the next seven years, Livingston rehabbed and fought his way back. Nine teams signed him and dumped him before he finally hooked up with the Brooklyn Nets in 2013 and helped guide them to the playoffs. Last summer, the Warriors decided Livingston’s veteran leadership and versatility could be a valuable asset to their rising team of young stars and signed him as a free agent to a three-year contract worth at least $14 million.\n\nThe money was great. The job security was even better. Playing at a high level again was spectacular. But none of it matched the euphoria of what the Warriors accomplished by finishing off the great LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals on Tuesday night.\n\nShaun Livingston, NBA champion.\n\n“Man,” Livingston says, “that has a terrific ring to it.”\n\nKirk Wessler can be reached at 686-3216 or kwessler@pjstar.com. Follow him on Twitter @KirkWessler.\n\n___\n\nAs Shaun Livingston celebrated the NBA championship with his Golden State Warriors teammates and fans last week, he took a few minutes to talk to the Journal Star.\n\n1\n\nJS: Describe your emotions. What has been going through your heart and head from the moment you won the championship and through the next couple of days?\n\nLivingston: Man, shocked. To be out there on the court, playing when we won, the shock and emotion of it is indescribable. I wasn’t able to sleep the first couple nights, everything going through my head, thinking about all the hard work, the journey.\n\nThe emotions I felt when we won the state championship in high school, especially the first one, were unbelievable. But it’s that same feeling on steroids now, because of the life experiences I’ve endured. The whole struggle, the decision to skip college and go to the NBA, going against the grain, the injury, going against all the doubts and the doubters who didn’t believe in me.\n\nI am on a high right now. The joy, the brotherhood with these guys that you form together. Seeing the joy in Steph Curry, Andre Iguodala. We’re champions for life now, and that’s a bond we’ll have forever.\n\nJS: You used the word “shock.” Really? The Warriors were among the favorites, you dominated the regular season with one of the best NBA records ever. And you’re shocked?\n\nLivingston: Yeah, shock. Just that we actually did it. I remember as a kid seeing Michael Jordan crying with the trophy. You watch what the Spurs did last year. You watch what LeBron did with Miami. We did it! This is us now.\n\nIt’s surreal. I mean, flying home with the Larry O’Brien (championship) trophy next to me. I had it strapped in with a seatbelt, with my arm around it.\n\n___\n\n2\n\nJS: Your versatility was invaluable to this team. Last summer, when you signed with the Warriors, you talked about backing up the guards, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, but you wound up playing three positions, were able to guard four. Did you expect that, and how much of that versatility was developed out of necessity, to be able to make it back after your injury?\n\nLivingston: That was the role I had with Brooklyn, and it’s what the Warriors expected. Our versatility as a team was an asset through the Finals. We had the pieces to fill in with whatever was needed in a given situation, and that’s what makes a good team a great team.\n\nWe had intangibles, like heart. There are lots of underdog stories on this team: Steph, Draymond (Green), even Klay. A lot of the guys overcame obstacles to get here. It’s amazing to see. You don’t really know what you can accomplish till you’re tested. We came together and shined our brightest when things were toughest. That’s the hardest thing to do.\n\nVersatility has always been part of my game, but a lot of it was born at Peoria High. I never was a good defensive player, naturally. I had good instincts, but I wasn’t the quickest player out there, and I was slow reacting. But playing with those guys at Peoria High, I mean defense, that’s what they were known for. Those Peoria championships were built on defense. I didn’t want to be the weakest link in that, and it helped prepare me for the NBA.\n\nFrom there, it was learning how to use my length and IQ, especially after I got injured, because I lost quickness.\n\n___\n\n3\n\nJS: What is it like to guard LeBron James? He wasn’t your main assignment, but you had to guard him, sometimes for several minutes.\n\nLivingston: He’s a load. Andre did a great job on him, but nobody can handle LeBron by himself. It’s all about trying to take a guy out of his comfort zone, so I try to throw him off his rhythm. LeBron has about 100 pounds on me. I’m a little quicker, so I try to beat him to spots and use my length. But when he gets a head of steam going to the basket, he’s like a train, so you just try to force him to take tough shots and try not to give him anything easy.\n\n___\n\n4\n\nJS: You wore No. 14 throughout your high school career and then your first 10 seasons in the NBA. With the Warriors, you changed to No. 34. What was the significance to 14? Is there a significance to 34? What’s the story there?\n\nLivingston: Fourteen was the number I got in high school, which was a new chapter in my life. My freshman year at Richwoods, me and Kedric Meredith were the last two to dress varsity, we were the rookies, so we got the last two uniforms. I got 14 and made it my own.\n\nBut 14 wasn’t available when I got to Golden State. They had retired it. Tom Meschery (who played from 1961-71) wore it. He came in and spoke to us one time, and I saw some old film of him. He had some game! But I couldn’t wear 14 anymore.\n\nSo, 34, I had at Concordia. And that was Howard Nathan’s number in high school (at Manual). I wanted to pay homage to him. He’s one of the greats, if not the greatest player, ever from Peoria. Playing in The League, I feel like I’m representing all of the Peoria guys.\n\n___\n\n5\n\nJS: I know your dad and sister Sarah were in Cleveland when you clinched the championship. How about your grandfather? Any other family? And what was it like having them in the house when you won the NBA championship?\n\nLivingston: My grandpa drove to Cleveland for Games 3 and 4 and kind of made a vacation out of it and had a great time. He stayed home for Game 6. He hates to fly, so he drives, and that was a long trip for one game.\n\nBut yeah, my dad and Sarah were there, and it was absolutely great. Just to see your loved ones and to enjoy that moment with them is invaluable. It just made the experience even sweeter. The people who help you along the way, who stick with you along the way; it was special to be able to give that back to them in some way. It was just an indescribable feeling to see them on the floor and celebrating with us.\n\nI will remember this forever."
