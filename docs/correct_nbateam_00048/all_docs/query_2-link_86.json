        "text": "NBA shooting guard Shaun Livingston, part of the Golden State Warriors championship squad of 2015, its regular season record-shattering team of this season and one of Illinois' finest homegrown basketball talents in recent memory, was in the Pontiac area Wednesday for his Pontiac Skills Clinic. The clinic, held at the Pontiac Rec Center, was for the community's young athletes, and served as an extension of Livingston's eponymous foundation.\n\nLivingston was born, raised and played — and played well — in Peoria, taking Peoria Central High School to back-to-back Class AA state titles in 2003 and 2004. For his considerable efforts, he was named Illinois Mr. Basketball in 2004.\n\nFollowing a debilitating left knee injury in 2007 while playing for the Los Angeles Clippers, in which he tore his ACL, PCL and lateral meniscus, he bounced around the league, briefly playing for the Miami Heat, the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Washington Wizards, the Charlotte Bobcats, the Milwaukee Bucks, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Brooklyn Nets before ultimately settling in Golden State two years ago.\n\nBut besides being a valuable role player on one of the NBA's finest squads, Livingston is extremely generous with what free time any professional athlete is allotted. Amanda Jacob, the executive director of the Peoria-based Shaun Livingston Foundation, called the organization “a vehicle for Shaun to work with kids and … to give back.” She cited his charitable surprise Christmas parties for struggling families, as well as his aid to victims of the Washington tornado disaster in 2013.\n\n“He's super thoughtful, super caring and loves giving back,” she said. “When the tornado hit Washington a few years ago … as soon as he could get through, he was asking 'How are you, what's going on and what can I do?' By the end of the week, we were getting Target gift cards to families who needed the necessities.\n\n“So he's that interested in helping out.”\n\nLivingston himself cited his foundation as an organization that focuses on aiding children.\n\n“We basically started with doing basketball camps, putting on a free camp for about 300 kids in Peoria,” he said. “Then we'd do other events, like Christmas events and Thanksgiving (events), and we'd partner with the Salvation Army, Boys and Girls Clubs, other various community centers. My focus is on the kids.”\n\nThe NBA player then described his clinic, in association with Pride of Peoria Basketball, as an effort to “represent his city.”\n\n“This is really about the kids at the end of the day — that's why we're all here,” he said, hoping that his clinic taught the kids who participated “basic skills” and “the value of teamwork.” He added that he hoped to expand his foundation's operations in the coming years.\n\nLivingston also spoke about his last two seasons with the Warriors, calling it a “great opportunity.”\n\n“It's been great; a great opportunity for me, getting a chance to play at the highest level,” he said. “I've had a chance to go to the Finals two years, so I've been extremely blessed.”\n\nThe champion was also proud to be part of an excellent crop of Illinois basketball players over the last 15 years, as former NBA MVP Derrick Rose, as well as rising stars Jabari Parker and Jahlil Okafor were also feted with Illinois Mr. Basketball honors during their high school careers.\n\n“Illinois basketball has always been rich, going back to before I was born,” he said. “I'm just humbled to be in that line … and grateful to be mentioned with those names.”"
