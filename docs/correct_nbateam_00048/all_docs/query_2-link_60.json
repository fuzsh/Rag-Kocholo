        "text": "OAKLAND — Whether he has been asked to provide 15-20 minutes of stability off the bench or step in for the best, flashiest basketball player on the planet, Shaun Livingston’s demeanor hasn’t seemed to waver.\n\nHe’s the same self-assured, buttoned-down, laconic Livingston. Take over for Stephen Curry as the Warriors’ starting point guard at a time of potential disaster? Sure, no problem. Hand him the reins.\n\nThe calmness and confidence it takes to do that goes beyond the numbers, and the numbers say plenty. In 135 minutes of action during the swift playoff dispatching of the Houston Rockets, Livingston averaged 13.2 points, shot 58.7 percent, dished 24 assists, racked up six steals and 18 rebounds and also played stellar defense.\n\nOh yes, and the turnovers. Six. In five games. The breakdown by game was 1-2-1-1-1.\n\nSuch a sustained efficient performance was Livingston personified, all performed with a stoic, decidedly unflashy stealth that almost makes him the anti-Steph. He not only didn’t make a 3-pointer in the series, he didn’t attempt one, unless you count the one he tried following a timeout Wednesday night that he casually swished.\n\nSo cool. But where does that cool come from?\n\n“Experience … experiences,” he said. “Everybody knows about the injury situation. It’s a devastating kind of thing, and when you go through traumatic events like that, you understand that now, being in this position, playing with guys like Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry, Draymond (Green), just being on this team … there was a time when I was being waived off teams that weren’t winning 20 games. Going through those experiences, it’s humbling.”\n\nThe gruesome tale of Livingston’s horrific knee injury on Feb. 26, 2007, while playing for the Los Angeles Clippers, has been documented in exhaustive and excruciating detail. Go on the Internet and you can find several dozen stories on it, complete with videos and photos if your stomach is strong enough to look. Landing awkwardly while driving to the basket, he suffered a complete dislocation of his left knee, with tears to all the major ligaments. For a brief period, it was feared he might face an amputation.\n\nThat tragedy averted, there was much concern about whether Livingston would ever walk normally again, let alone play basketball, and beyond that, ever play it at the NBA level. His career seemed crushed at age 21.\n\nBut over the past week, Livingston’s already amazing comeback story has taken on an exciting, unprecedented new chapter as The Man Who Would Be Curry, at least until the MVP is healthy to return. So far, he’s writing it without really altering his game. He’s simply taking it to another level and opening more eyes.\n\n“He’s an incredibly smart player,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “People may forget, but if it weren’t for the knee injury, Shaun was headed for a superstar career. He was going to be a multiple-time All-Star. I have so much respect and admiration for him because of the way he came back from that injury. It literally took him several years and he’s been with 10 teams or so.\n\n“There’s something about him, maybe it’s the experience he went through with the injury or maybe it’s just who he already was — just an incredibly mature person.”\n\nThe day before Game 5, Livingston admitted he cringed when he saw Curry slip and hit the floor in Houston, then roll over holding his knee. Once he heard the medical report, Livingston was elated, based partly what he experienced a decade ago.\n\n“Seeing what happened and how he fell, it could have been real ugly,” he said.\n\nAlmost immediately, Livingston was forming his game plan mentally as to how best take over for Steph.\n\n“I have to be more aggressive just because of the production that’s out,” he said. “I don’t expect to make all of that up — this guy leads the league in scoring. But it’s really important we all remain aggressive and confident. That’s more important than anything. You don’t want to put too much pressure and stress on yourself, because that can throw off the flow of the team. It’s really about remaining confident in your game, understanding what you bring to the table and being assertive.”\n\nLivingston, 30, had three 16-point games in the Houston series and in the clinching Game 5, made his first six shots en route to a 7-for-8 night. The postgame locker room was full of admirers.\n\n“Stepping in for Steph, it’s different,” Green said. “It’s not the same thing that you’re used to, which is so unique about it. But he’s been incredible for us, always steady, somebody we know we can go to if we need a basket, and taking care of the ball and really running the offense.”\n\nSaid Andrew Bogut: “Shaun’s got one of the best basketball IQs in the league. He just does everything right. He’s long, he’s athletic. He’s really good defensively for us. And that mid-range game, you can’t really put a small guard on him because he punishes them down in the paint. He’s not going to be bombing 3s like Steph, but he still affects the game in a lot of ways people don’t see. It’s just not as flashy. You don’t always see it on the stat sheet. It’s more of a seasoned-veteran approach.”\n\nIndeed, that seasoned veteran has been and will be as instrumental as anyone in sustaining this historic season without its best player.\n\nFollow Carl Steward on Twitter at twitter.com/stewardsfolly.\n\n[[[Normal]]][[[Normal]]]{\"Infobox Head\"/}"
