        "text": "With it still unclear as to how much longer we need to wait for Clippers basketball, I thought it would be a fun time to kick off this brand new series.\n\nOver the next few months, I’ll be ranking the 100 greatest players in Clippers history. Now, with such a high number of players that have suited up for the Clips at one point over the last 50 years, you’re probably wondering how these rankings will be determined.\n\nThese will be based off a player’s “Win Shares” while with the Clippers. Let’s get this list underway, shall we?\n\nShaun Livingston\n\nTime with Clippers: 2004-2007\n\nStats: 7.4 PPG, 4.8 AST, 3.1 RPG, 0.9 STL, 145 G, 44 FG%\n\nShaun Livingston was drafted by the Clippers with the fourth overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. Injuries limited his season, as he only played in 30 games and started 15 during his first year. He was still productive, as he averaged more than seven points to go along with five assists, three rebounds and a steal per game.\n\nInjuries still cost him games the following season as well, but he did appear in 61, starting only 14 of them. He averaged six points, 4.5 assists and three rebounds per game.\n\n2006-2007 was poised to be a breakout year for Livingston. He was averaging just under 10 points a game, a career-high for him. His playing time was up as well, as he was getting more starts and playing just under 30 minutes a game.\n\nThings were slowly but surely looking up for Livingston. I won’t go into too much detail, as most of you already know what happened. On February 24, 2007, Livingston played his final game for the Clippers. He suffered a devastating knee injury that almost led to his leg being amputated.\n\nHe missed the rest of the 2007 season, and then missed the entire 2008 season. In July of 2008, Livingston was released by the Clippers.\n\nUnfortunately, we never got to see Livingston at his full potential. Fortunately, he was able to walk again and resumed what turned out to be a very productive career.\n\nCheck out these highlights of Livingston on the Clippers prior to his injury."
