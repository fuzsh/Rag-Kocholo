        "text": "I caught up with Shaun Livingston on Thursday, the day after Peoria’s only current NBA player was traded from the Milwaukee Bucks to the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe former Peoria High all-stater didn’t want to say much about the deal and where he fits just yet, primarily because he’s not sure what lies ahead in the next few days.\n\n“We’ll talk once the dust settles,” he said. “I’m not sure where I’ll end up. Houston’s in flux right now trying to build its team. With the draft (Thursday night) and the moves they’re making, a lot can change.”\n\nWednesday’s trade, which sent Livingston, forward Jon Leuer and the draft’s No. 12 pick to Houston for center Samuel Dalembert and the No. 14 draft spot, was the second deal in as many days for the Rockets.\n\nHouston, which did not make the playoffs this past season, stood to gain more talent in the draft, owning the 12th, 16th and 18th picks as of mid-afternoon Thursday.\n\nConsidering the club’s goal of trading for a top-notch center such as Dwight Howard or Pau Gasol, much more maneuvering is likely, including the possibility of dealing guys they’ve just acquired.\n\nIf Livingston sticks with the Rockets, it will be his seventh NBA team since being drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers in 2004. Six of those stops have come since re-starting his career following a horrific knee injury five years ago in his last game as a Clipper.\n\nLook for an in-depth visit with Livingston soon in this space once his immediate future comes into sharper focus.\n\nSommerville’s summer: Former Peoria High and Bradley standout Marcellus Sommerville arrived back in town last week after helping his Le Mans French club to a second-place finish in the Pro A League. He worked this week as an instructor at the Geno Ford Bradley basketball camp.\n\nSommerville, 30, has played professionally in Europe for six seasons, the last five in Le Mans. He averaged 12.6 points last season, 14.0 in the playoffs.\n\nSommerville plans to return to Europe in August, but as a free agent. He’s mulling over several offers, most from French clubs.\n\n“I’m pretty pleased with the way it’s going,” he said. “I’ve been in the finals three times and in the playoffs all but one year. I’ve been one of the top players in the country. Hopefully, I’ll get another five great years out of this, have enough money in the bank and start a new career. I’d like to stay involved in basketball.”\n\nBefore heading overseas, Sommerville will again join with two other Central legends — A.J. Guyton and Daniel Ruffin — in staging the annual M.A.D. Skillz camp. Camp details will be announced next week.\n\nSummer breeze: Three of the four Bradley men’s basketball newcomers are arriving on campus next weekend in time for workouts and second summer session at BU. Freshman Ka’Darryl Bell and sophomore transfers Anthony Fields and Omari Grier are expected, while junior college transfer Tyshon Pickett won’t be here until the start of fall semester in August. Pickett had 12 academic hours to pick up this summer. He’s passed nine of them and is taking one online English class that must be completed before he can enroll at BU. ... Geno Ford saw a big jump in participation from his first basketball camp to his second, going from a total of up to 99 campers each of the two weeks last year to 140 this week.\n\nDave Reynolds can be reached at 686-3210 or dreynolds@pjstar.com.
