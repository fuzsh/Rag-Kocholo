        "text": "It’s been six years now since The Injury.\n\nShaun Livingston’s NBA career path has zigzagged from promising star to seemingly finished to his current role as journeyman backup.\n\nThe Peoria native has played for seven teams in the league, one twice, during those six years since suffering one of the sport’s most horrific injuries.\n\nStill only 27 years old, Livingston just finished this season with the Cleveland Cavaliers, with whom he signed last Christmas Day after getting cut earlier in the year by two other clubs — Houston in October and Washington in December.\n\n“I like it here,” Livingston said about the Cavaliers in a recent interview with the Journal Star. “Obviously, it’s a rebuilding situation. But they have a bright future and it’s been a good fit for me. I’m in a comfort zone. They’re playing me. But we’ll see how it goes.”\n\nForgive Livingston’s caution. He’s scaled physical, mental and emotional mountains to arrive here. This is a profession of salary caps and limited rosters in which long-term homes are uncommon for many players. Livingston’s bags have stayed packed more than most.\n\n“This year I’ve been in three different places,” he said. “It’s been chaotic. It’s more demanding mentally than anything. The whole ordeal and sacrifices of moving. ... I don’t have any kids so it allows me to be a little more flexible. But still, there’s just the whole stability thing. I usually try to stay in an apartment by the arena of where I’m playing.”\n\nWhile his 2012-13 season has been one of his best statistically — averaging 7.2 points and 3.6 assists in 49 games with the Cavs — since his left knee exploded on that fateful February night in 2007, he knows well the difficulty of staying employed in a league where his stock has gone from “can’t miss” to “expendable.”\n\n“It’s been so long since the injury, it’s hard to even remember what it was like before that,” he said. “But my knee is as close to 100 percent as it’ll probably be. I still have some flashes here and there. There are days I feel bouncy like I used to.”\n\nLeadership\n\nHe’s been a popular teammate on a young Cleveland squad, the Cavs’ second-longest tenured NBA player.\n\n“Shaun’s an awesome player,” said rookie center Tyler Zeller. “His basketball IQ is extremely high. He’s obviously not the player he was before the injury. But he can still get the job done.”\n\nSaid recently fired head coach Byron Scott: “Shaun brought us stability and leadership. For me as a coach, he’s a guy I can put in there and feel real comfortable with. I’ve always been intrigued by Shaun and love what he’s been able to do for us.” Such as providing good ball handling, precise passing, an ability to get his own shot and a body length to bother opposing shooters.\n\n“I’m very proud of Shaun,” said his Peoria High coach, Chuck Buescher. “The work he’s gone through with the injury to get back to where he is is phenomenal. It shows his true love for the game.”\n\nWhile still one of the slightest-built NBA players, Livingston is a grizzled veteran compared to the skinny kid with the big Afro who was selected No. 4 overall in the 2004 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers. He was the first and only high school guard to be chosen so high in the draft.\n\nCarrying just 170 pounds on his 6-foot-7 frame, Livingston suffered several injuries in his first two NBA seasons battling the league’s giants and missed 71 of 164 regular-season games.\n\nBut as that 2006-07 season unfolded, the 21-year-old Livingston finally enjoyed mostly good health. The promising career of the league’s tallest point guard took off.\n\nLivingston was playing 30 minutes a game, averaging 9.3 points and 5.1 assists. The previous season, he played a big part in helping lead the previously pitiful Clippers into the second round of the playoffs where they took the powerful Phoenix Suns to seven games before bowing out.\n\n“He was a really, really good player,” said Buescher, who watched Livingston play professionally every chance he got. “I asked his trainer, (Chicago-based) Tim Grover, how good he thought he could be. He told me, ‘Shaun will be an Olympian and an NBA All-Star.’ ”\n\nThe injury\n\nThen came Feb. 26, 2007, a home game against Charlotte. In the first quarter, Livingston picked up a deflection and raced downcourt.\n\nBut as he came down from the breakaway layup, his left foot landed awkwardly and his knee twisted grotesquely. Clippers team physician Dr. Steven Shimoyama rushed to his side and knew immediately that Livingston had suffered a severe knee dislocation.\n\nShimoyama was able to snap the knee back into place. Had he not succeeded, horrors such as gangrene and even amputation would have been likely.\n\nAs it was, the dislocation was just part of the damage. Every knee ligament was torn — the anterior cruciate, the posterior cruciate and the medial collateral.\n\nSo were the lateral meniscus and the retinaculum, the band that stabilizes the knee tendons. The knee was essentially destroyed and had to be rebuilt.\n\n“My wife, Barb, and I had gotten the NBA League Pass so we could see Shaun’s games,” Buescher said. “We were sitting here (in Peoria) watching the game. When he went down, it was so ugly, Barb covered her eyes. My first thought was I hope his career’s not over.”\n\nSeasoned observers said they’d never before witnessed such a gruesome injury. Local Los Angeles television stations refused to air the footage. But the 51-second YouTube clip of the horrific incident went viral.\n\nLivingston understands why many are drawn to the clip. But he claims never to have seen the injury footage and said he never will.\n\n“I call it the shock value,” he said recently. “You don’t see stuff like that every day, so it creates a buzz when something like that happens. It’s a negative situation. I like to focus on the positive.\n\n“The mind is powerful. Those images playing in your head ... to go out on the court and have that, it’s not productive.”\n\nThe road back\n\nWhile the leg could be saved, Livingston would face months of rehabilitation to simply walk again, let alone play basketball at the highest level.\n\nSurgery was performed by two of the nation’s foremost knee experts — Dr. James Andrews and Dr. William Clancy. The day after the procedure, Livingston’s range of motion was akin to a 90-year-old man.\n\nThe comeback was agonizingly slow. First, he had to learn to walk again. Once that was accomplished, he worked long hours at strengthening the leg.\n\nAs Livingston continued his rehab through the entire 2007-08 season, his contract expired with Los Angeles, and he became a free agent.\n\nA few teams expressed interest, and he signed a two-year deal with Miami as he continued his rehab. Livingston played in just four games before being traded in January 2009 to Memphis, but was waived later that day.\n\nTwo months later, he signed with the Tulsa 66ers of the NBA D-League. After three weeks, he was called up to the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nLivingston’s time there was brief, just 18 games before being waived the following December. Then came a 26-game stint with Washington, where he received his most extensive playing time to that point. He was productive, averaging 9.2 points and 4.5 assists.\n\nStability seemed to follow when Charlotte signed him to a two-year deal for $7 million in July 2010. But he lasted just one season there before being traded to Milwaukee, where he spent the 2011-12 season.\n\nMaybe a starter\n\nThen came the three-team odyssey that was this past season as Livingston’s $1.1 million contract expired.\n\n“I would want Shaun on my team, but I’m prejudiced,” Buescher said. “I would want a guy who gets the ball to others and is unselfish. There should always be a place for a guy like that.”\n\nWhile that future role is likely the reserve one that Livingston has lived the past half-dozen years, he believes he can play a more prominent position.\n\n“I think I can get back (to being a starter),” he said. “The biggest key is sustaining those type of minutes. I wear down a lot easier playing major minutes in a game compared to when I was younger.\n\n“But my knee’s really held up through the wear and tear of this season. I understand the game more. I’m more patient and have all the stuff that comes with experience.”\n\nWhether his next NBA chapter will come in Cleveland or elsewhere, Livingston brings enough to the table for it to be somewhere in the league for 2013-14.\n\n“His explosiveness maybe isn’t quite what it was before the injury,” Buescher said. “But he’s still had a good career. You have to give the kid a lot of credit. I guess he’ll never be what he once was, but I’m hopeful he can stick in the league for a few more years.”\n\nDave Reynolds can be reached at 686-3210 or dreynolds@pjstar.com.
