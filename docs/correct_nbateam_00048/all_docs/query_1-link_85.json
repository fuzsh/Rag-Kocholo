        "text": "NO LONGER USED\n\nRalph Anthony Lawler (born April 21, 1938) is an American former television and radio personality. Lawler is best known for his 41-year tenure as the voice of the National Basketball Association's Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nGoing back to the franchise's six-year stint in San Diego (1978–84), Lawler has broadcast virtually every Clippers game since the franchise moved from Buffalo, New York in 1978, whether it be radio and/or television. There were only two seasons when Lawler did not serve as the team's primary play-by-play broadcaster: 1981–82 (Jerry Gross) and 1984–85 (Eddie Doucette); Lawler returned as the full-time voice in 1985–86. In 2019, Lawler was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nAlthough the Clippers have been among the least successful NBA franchises, Lawler would provide Clippers fans with his enthusiastic commentary, which has made him a fan favorite. He has broadcast more than 3,000 Clippers games, including more than 1,600 consecutive games. He reached the 2,500-game milestone in a game versus the Boston Celtics, on February 26, 2011. Lawler reached the 3,000-game milestone on December 10, 2016 versus the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nLife and career[]\n\nLawler was born in Ohio and raised in Peoria, Illinois. His broadcasting career began in the 1960s upon graduating from Bradley University in his hometown. Lawler initially worked as a sports announcer at 1440 KPRO in Riverside, California and did some announcing at the Riverside International Raceway nearby. From there, Lawler went on to work in Philadelphia, where he broadcast games for the Flyers of the National Hockey League, the 76ers of the National Basketball Association, the Phillies of Major League Baseball, Big 5 college basketball, and Temple college football. He also worked as a sports reporter for then-CBS station WCAU-TV, before returning to Southern California for good in the late 1970s, calling the San Diego Conquistadors of the American Basketball Association and the San Diego Chargers of the National Football League.\n\nLawler has worked with Basketball Hall of Famer and current ESPN/ABC commentator Bill Walton, on locally televised Clippers broadcasts. Their broadcasts were wildly popular among Clippers (and many NBA) fans, because of their witty banter. Walton left the Clippers to work exclusively with ABC/ESPN when the two networks acquired the NBA broadcasts in 2002. Lawler's biggest broadcasting influences included Irv Kaze, a former sports executive (who had a stint as a San Diego Clippers general manager and hired Lawler in 1978) and long-time Los Angeles-area sports talk show host, before he died in 2003; and Los Angeles Lakers voice, Chick Hearn, who like Lawler, grew up in Illinois before moving on to Southern California. Lawler and former Clippers guard Shaun Livingston are alumni of Peoria (Central) High School. Lawler had previously worked on Clippers telecasts on Prime Ticket/Fox Sports West alongside former Clipper player and former color analyst, Mike Smith, over 15 seasons from 2002 to 2017. He worked alongside former San Antonio Spurs player Bruce Bowen, during the 2017/18 season.\n\nUnlike other announcers who use headsets while calling the game, Lawler relies exclusively on a handheld microphone during games. His reasoning for it is because he feels he has \"much more control over the microphone by holding it.\" He also added \"I've been doing it so long that if I wear a headset, I don't know what to do with my hands.\"\n\nLawler and his wife, Jo, have three grown children and seven grandchildren.\n\nOn March 3, 2016, Lawler was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Clippers coach Doc Rivers and several players attended the ceremony.\n\nOn September 12, 2018, Lawler announced he would retire at the end of the 2018-19 season. He has missed only three games in his 40-year career.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Lawler was named the 2019 winner of the Curt Gowdy Media Award for electronic media by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nQuotes[]"
