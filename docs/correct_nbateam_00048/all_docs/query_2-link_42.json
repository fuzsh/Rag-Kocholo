        "text": "After getting cut by the Houston Rockets earlier this season, Shaun Livingston found a new NBA home in DC, as the Wizards inked him to a deal today (and waived Jannero Pargo.) Per the press release: “Washington Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld announced today that the team has signed free agent guard Shaun Livingston. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not released. ‘We are obviously familiar with what Shaun brings both on and off the court based on his previous time here and we’re confident that he will be a positive addition to our team,’ said Grunfeld. ‘His size and playmaking ability will give us more flexibility in the backcourt.’ Livingston (6-7, 175) was originally selected by the Los Angeles Clippers with the fourth overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft out of Peoria Central High School in Illinois. He appeared in 26 games (18 starts) with the Wizards in 2009-10, averaging 9.2 points, 4.5 assists and 2.2 rebounds. In seven seasons with Los Angeles, Miami, Oklahoma City, Washington, Charlotte and Milwaukee, the 27-year old holds career averages of 6.8 points, 3.5 assists and 2.6 rebounds in 22.6 minutes per game while shooting .460 from the field and .778 from the line. He has appeared in 12 career playoff games (all with Los Angeles during the 2005-06 campaign), averaging 7.5 points, 4.8 assists and 4.7 rebounds in 27.6 minutes.”"
