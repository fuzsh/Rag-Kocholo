        "text": "OAKLAND, Calif. — In an NBA career that is technically into its second decade, Shaun Livingston has scored fewer than 5,000 points, started fewer than 200 games and spent time with nine different teams. He was cut four times. This is not nearly what he was supposed to become back when he flashed talent so conspicuous he was chosen fourth in the 2004 draft without spending a day in college basketball.\n\nAnd yet he stands three games away from a second consecutive NBA championship, not as a bystander but as an essential member of one of the deepest teams in the league’s recent history.\n\nMORE: Ranking the most important players in the NBA Finals\n\nLivingston would not trade the career he has had for the one you wish he’d had. Not now. Not with how gloriously it is climaxing. Not after scoring 20 points for the first time all year, outscoring superstar teammates Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green to lead the Warriors to a 104-89 victory over the Cavaliers and a 1-0 series advantage in the NBA Finals.\n\n“No. That’s why I’m here, because I’ve accepted my journey,” Livingston told Sporting News. “That’s really what it comes down to: believing in myself, accepting what is and not what could have been.”\n\nLivingston’s knee injury during a February 2007 game was so horrific it would be edited out of any episode of “The Walking Dead” for being too extreme. The video replay from that night has been viewed more than 1.9 million times on YouTube because, you know, that’s who we are.\n\nMORE: Must-see NBA Finals photos\n\nHe missed all of one season, and part of a second, and wasn’t really any good for another five years. The Clippers let him go. The Thunder, the Rockets and the Wizards all waived him. Those rejections drove him. And then he got to Brooklyn at age 28 and started to look a little more like the 18-year-old he’d been once, and after seeing him start 54 games and average 8.3 points and shoot 48 percent Golden State offered him a multiyear contract.\n\nIt is possible the Warriors would have won the 2015 NBA championship without him. As is the case with what he lost to injury, though, we only know what is. And Livingston contributed three double-figure scoring games in the playoffs, all in victories, and he averaged 22 minutes and 5 points per game in last year’s Finals.\n\nThursday night he was easily Golden State’s best player, and he was effective because he was active and involved when the Cavaliers so often were not.\n\nMORE: Deliberate crotch shot? That's nuts, says Delly\n\nCleveland coach Tyronn Lue said his team was bothered by “just his length, being 6-7, and no matter who you try to put in front of him he’s always going to be bigger at the point guard position. So we try to keep a bigger defender on him. But he got to the spots — to the free throw line, 12 feet in on the baseline — and got to his shot.”\n\nShaun Livingston shoots over J.R. Smith. (Getty Images)\n\nThere were multiple occasions, though, when the Cavs simply lost track of him. On one key third-quarter possession, veteran guard Iman Shumpert was caught spectating on the perimeter as Livingston dashed to the lane and scored on a put-back. Livingston outworked his Cleveland opposition.\n\n“He just played a great game,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “I thought he looked for openings. He was very aggressive. And you know, this was a strange game for us. We’re not used to having both Steph and Klay off like that with their shooting. But the one thing we’ve talked about all year is if we defend and take care of the ball, then we’re always going to have somebody score enough points for us, whether it’s the starters or the bench.”\n\nDEVENEY: Dubs' bench delivers bigger splash than stars\n\nWith the “Splash Brothers” crashing to a combined 8 of 27 from the field, Livingston understood his production would be welcome, and it was particularly rewarding after he’d shot only 36.1 percent in the difficult Western Conference finals series against Oklahoma City.\n\n“Obviously, last series wasn’t my series. I was struggling to find rhythm,” Livingston said. “It was a series of matchups, and it was tough. There are some nights you want to give more, do more and it’s not there.\n\n“Everybody on the bench feels that way. We’re confident. We’re plugged in. At any moment, we could step up. It’s good to see the results pay off.”\n\nFor many it is tempting is to write the story of what Livingston’s career might have been using the most grandiose possible projections. The canvas is blank enough it leaves room for so much interpretation. The sympathy provoked by the severity of his injury leads others to be as generous as possible.\n\nSo even though he had yet to average double-figure scoring in three seasons as a pro before the injury, though he’d only begun to position himself as a full-time starter, the declarations persist that he might have developed into a replica of Penny Hardaway, or an approximation of Magic Johnson. Conveniently, Magic made this very assertion on Twitter following Thursday's game. The talent Livingston flashed in the days before the injury was prodigious, and he appeared to be growing as a player with nearly every game he played.\n\nIt seems fairly clear that, at the very least, he would have been something like this for a longer period of time. If he had not taken that terrible detour, though, he might never have landed with the Warriors, contributing to a team on the verge of a spectacular moment in basketball history.\n\n“I think last year, winning a ring gives you that ultimate confidence,” he said. “If you can win a championship, win a ring, you can do anything.”\n\nFor instance: Win a second."
