I am however split down the middle when it comes to this recent 10-day hardship contracts being as that nobody could've predicted this happening and isn't one of the biggest reasons why most of us play 2K every single year is the MyNBA mode that allows us to create something of our own and let it grow into something bigger. I will admit that I myself have at least 5 MyNBA separate files (1 being my template file, 1 being a mirrored reflection of the current NBA sesaon, 1 being a file that I control all 30 teams and only play with my Lakers and only the Laker game outcomes could possibly be different than reality, every other game played by all 29 other teams the \"forced to win\" option is used to mirror the reality result and the 2 other 2 files are just to sim and see what goes on in later years), but just the simple fact that we are unable to have more than 20 players on a teams roster maybe we don't to mirror the current NBA season as spot on as we are trying to. If I'm not mistaken most of these 10 day hardships contracts have already expired and players were not re-signed or those players that signed those hardship deals some had to be placed in the safety protocols and were unable to even suit up during their 10 day contract right?\n\nIn any case 2K making the effort to add these players I think deserves a pat on the back from all of us because they really don't have to do it, but I say that after paying $70 for a video game I kinda want my $70 to be spent well so i applaud them for making the effort but again for $70 I would expect those players to be added to get my $$ worth in the end.\n\npjt8405 likes this.\n\n__________________\n\nEaglerock562\n\nFormer Boys Varsity Basketball Coach\n\nEaglerock562 NBA2K MyEra Reference Guide"
