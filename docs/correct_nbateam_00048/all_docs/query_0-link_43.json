        "text": "There was a path to stardom and success paved with potential for Livingston. Selected fourth overall in the NBA draft, the former Illinois Mr. Basketball had a bright future awaiting him. Unfortunately, his professional basketball career got off to a slow start. Finally, just as he began to find his groove and was well on his way toward a career year, things took a turn for the worse. This is when the story truly begins.\n\nLivingston’s journey started on February 26, 2007. On that fateful day, while attempting a layup, the Los Angeles Clipper point guard landed awkwardly, snapping his knee in two. In the emergency room that night, his leg was so mangled that he faced the threat of amputation. A gruesome injury, doctors informed Livingston that he would require months of rehab before being able to walk again.\n\nBut doctors didn’t know about one of Livingston’s key features: his resiliency. He trained with discipline, utilized experimental technology in his recovery. Eventually, Shaun Livingston returned to the NBA in late 2008, roughly twenty months post knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, Livingston’s career was not the same, which is to be expected. A former ‘young player on the rise,’ he became the ‘what if’ type of player. Over the next seven seasons, Livingston was a journeyman on a quest, during which he played for eight different teams.\n\nUltimately, this quest led Livingston to the Bay Area, where he has experienced an exciting resurgency. Over the past four seasons, Shaun Livingston has quietly played behind superstar Stephen Curry, not receiving the accolades or reaching the greatness he was once destined for.\n\nBut after finding his role, Livingston, whose career was in jeopardy while recovering from the worst basketball injury ever, now is a three time NBA champion.\n\nThis offseason, Livingston was waived by the Warriors and plans to finish his career the ‘right way’, possibly where all of it started, and the Clippers seem to also be interested.\n\nPer the Peoria Journal Star:\n\n“At this point, it’s more about finishing my career the right way. Going to where the fit is right as far as what I can bring to the table. Coming in and helping a team from a leadership standpoint, helping mentor the young guys and playing spot minutes … I’m at the stage of my career where those are the things where I add the most value. (The Clippers) would be awesome, the ideal fit. That would be a part of coming full circle. But it has to work on their end. If there’s a spot, an opportunity, that would probably make the most sense. There’s been some interest (on the Clippers’ part). It’s about whether they’re ready to pull the trigger.”\n\nLet’s make it happen!"
