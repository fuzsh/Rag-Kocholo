        "text": "Shaun Livingston didn’t need to hear the racially insensitive comments allegedly made by Clippers owner Donald Sterling in an audio recording to know how the man thinks. “You look it, it was probably disappointing to a lot of people,” said Livingston, who was drafted by the Clippers and played three years in Los Angeles. “But you look at what’s kind of gone on in the past, it’s very unfortunate, but I think it kind of tells the same story as what’s been told if you pull up the record.”\n\nWhat does Shaun Livingston think about Nets GM Billy King saying re-signing Livingston is his No. 1 priority this offseason? “It feels good to be wanted,” Livingston said. “But my focus right now is on the season and the playoffs. I just want to help my team win games and just keep getting better on the court each game.” The Nets can only offer Livingston the taxpayer mid-level exception, starting at $3.3 million, because they do not have his Bird Rights. Other teams may offer him more money.\n\nLivingston was 21 at the time and had serious left knee damage, tearing the anterior cruiciate, posterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments and dislocating his kneecap. He also had a torn lateral meniscus, and the thigh and shin bones were out of place. This was as serious as knee injuries come. Though he heard he might not play again, no doctor ever told him that, Livingston said. “My doctor, James Andrews, said it was a mountain to climb and told me it would be one of the most difficult injuries to overcome,” Livingston said. “But there was never a closed door on my career.”"
