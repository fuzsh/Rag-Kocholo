        "text": "NBA players, Hall-of-Famers, local leaders around Los Angeles, social media and even President Barack Obama are reacting to an audio recording of a man identified as L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling telling his girlfriend not to bring black people to games:\n\nLeBron James, Miami Heat forward:\n\n\"There is no room for Donald Sterling in our league. There is no room for him.\"\n\nMichael Jordan, Hall-of-Famer and current Charlotte Bobcats owner:\n\n\"I'm completely disgusted that a fellow team owner could hold such sickening and offensive views. I'm completely outraged. There is no room in the NBA -- or anywhere else -- for the kind of racism and hatred that Mr. Sterling allegedly expressed.\n\nI am appalled that this type of ignorance still exists within our country and at the highest levels of our sport. In a league where the majority of players are African-American, we cannot and must not tolerate discrimination at any level.\"\n\nKevin Johnson, Sacramento mayor and former NBA player:\n\n\"The reported comments made by Clippers owner Donald Sterling are reprehensible and unacceptable. The National Basketball Players Association must and will play a very active role in determining how this issue is addressed. There needs to be an immediate investigation and if the reports are true, there needs to be strong and swift action taken.\"\n\nCharles Barkley, Hall-of-Famer and TNT analyst:\n\n\"This is the first test for Adam Silver, because you can't have this guy making statements like that ... (if it's Sterling on the recording), he has to suspend and fine him immediately.\"\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti:\n\n\"These statements are offensive and despicable and have no place in Los Angeles. I urge the NBA to act swiftly. L.A. fans deserve and demand better.\"\n\nShaun Livingston, former Clipper and current Brooklyn Nets guard:\n\n\"I would say it's probably disappointing to a lot of people, you know what I mean? But you look at what's kind of gone on in the past, it's very unfortunate, but I think it kind of tells the same story as what's been told if you pull up the record.\"\n\nChris Webber, former NBA player and TNT analyst:\n\n\"I'm so angry that I just don't want to say anything. I don't want to add validity to anything that he said by being out of character. But the NBA owners need to handle their own. They need to take him out to the shed and handle him. Not only is being a jerk not good, but it's not good for the business of basketball.\"\n\nMagic Johnson, Hall-of-Famer who was mentioned in the recording:\n\n\"(Wife Cookie) and I will never go to a Clippers game again as long as Donald Sterling is the owner.\"\n\nRev. Al Sharpton:\n\n\"The NBA must investigate L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling's recent racial comments that were caught on tape and discipline him. No one should be allowed to own a team if they have in fact engaged in this kind of racial language. We are prepared at National Action Network to rally in front of the NBA headquarters if this matter is not immediately dealt with.\"\n\nGregg Popovich, San Antonio Spurs coach:\n\n\"The comments are obviously disgusting.\"\n\nBette Midler, actress/singer/songwriter:\n\nVia Twitter @BetteMidler: \"Donald Sterling's racist remarks? What he's been saying for yrs. I think he should be stripped of his championship rings. All zero of them.\"\n\nâââââââââââââââ\n\nClippers players stage silent protest with inside-out shirts\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers made a silent protest against owner Donald Sterling before Game 4 of their Western Conference playoff series against Golden State. The Warriors made a different kind of statement during the game.\n\nAnd just like that, a series pulled into a race-related scandal took another twist.\n\nStephen Curry made a career playoff-high seven 3-pointers and scored 33 points, leading the Warriors past the Clippers 118â97 on Sunday to even their first-round series at two games apiece.\n\n\"We wanted to come out and focus on all the work we've put in over the summer, throughout the course of the season to get ready for this moment in the playoffs and just have fun and enjoy it - not let one person ruin it for everybody,\" Curry said.\n\nThe game almost became an afterthought â until tipoff anyway â after an audio recording was posted Saturday online by TMZ purportedly of Sterling making comments urging a woman to not bring black people to his team's games. The alleged comments, which are under investigation by the NBA, have set off reactions of anger and calls for action through the league.\n\nClippers players made a silent protest against Sterling by shedding their warm-up jerseys and going through the pregame routine with their red shirts on inside out. They also wore black bands on their wrists or arms and black socks in a show of solidarity.\n\nClippers coach Doc Rivers said he knew what his players had planned but didn't voice his opinion. He said he wasn't thrilled about the demonstration, though he didn't elaborate why.\n\nThe Clippers are choosing not to speak publicly about Sterling and his purported recorded comments. Instead, the team let their uniforms become a show of solidarity.\n\nMeanwhile, the players union, still without an executive director since firing Billy Hunter in February 2013, has asked former NBA All-Star and current Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson to take a leading role on the players' behalf to address the Sterling matter.\n\nJohnson says there will be no league-wide protest by players or any kind of boycott because there's enough attention on the issue already and that players \"trust\" that NBA Commissioner Adam Silver \"will do the right thing.\"\n\nâââââââââââââââ\n\nAll eyes on Silver as Sterling fallout continues\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers have Monday off. Adam Silver likely won't get that same luxury.\n\nFacing the first real crisis of his short tenure as NBA commissioner, Silver is under pressure to swiftly bring some sort of resolution to the scandal surrounding Clippers owner Donald Sterling and the racially charged comments he allegedly made in a recorded conversation, portions of which were released over the weekend by TMZ and Deadspin.\n\nThe matter will not go away anytime soon, but the players' association is hoping Silver rules before the Clippers play host to Golden State in a critical Game 5 of their knotted-up Western Conference first-round series on Tuesday night. That means plenty of eyeballs will remain on the commissioner's office Monday, waiting to see if any word is coming.\n\n\"This situation is a massive distraction for the league right now,\" said Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, the former NBA All-Star who is serving as an adviser to the National Basketball Players Association while the Sterling matter plays out. \"It must be addressed immediately.\"\n\nSilver's first priority is verifying Sterling's voice is on the recording. From there, Silver's next move remains unclear. He works for the owners - and so far that group seems to have no sympathy for Sterling's latest controversy.\n\nAmong those who have spoken out publicly to condemn the alleged Sterling remarks: Washington's Ted Leonsis, Miami's Micky Arison and perhaps most notably, Charlotte's Michael Jordan, who won six NBA titles as a player.\n\n\"I'm obviously disgusted that a fellow team owner could hold such sickening and offensive views,\" Jordan said in a statement released Sunday. \"I'm confident that Adam Silver will make a full investigation and take appropriate action quickly.\"\n\nSilver started as commissioner Feb. 1, replacing the retired David Stern. Silver met with Kevin Johnson on Sunday and heard five things that the players' union wants from the commissioner, that list includes:\n\n-Sterling doesn't attend any NBA games for the rest of the playoffs because of the \"enormous distraction.\"\n\n-A full account of past allegations of discrimination by Sterling and why the league never sanctioned him.\n\n-An explanation of the range of penalties the league could bring against Sterling.\n\n-Assurance the NBA and the union will be partners in the investigation.\n\n-A decisive ruling.\n\n\"He's got to come down hard,\" Hall of Fame player Magic Johnson, who was referenced on the audio recording, said Sunday on ABC.\n\nThe NBA constitution is not public, though it's understood the commissioner's powers are broad when it comes to dealing with matters deemed \"prejudicial or detrimental to the best interests of basketball.\" A fine, a suspension, a demand for sensitivity training, all those and more are surely at Silver's disposal.\n\nMeanwhile, more audio may be coming. An employee in the office of attorney Mac E. Nehoray, who represents the woman allegedly on the tape, said the full recording lasts about an hour. The clips released by TMZ and Deadspin are significantly shorter than that.\n\nThe attorney's office also insists that the recording is legitimate and that Sterling is the man on the tape.\n\nAlso on Sunday, the NAACP announced on Twitter that \"(hash)DonaldSterling will not be receiving a lifetime achievement award from the LA Branch of the NAACP.\" Sterling had been slated to receive the honor on May 15 as part of the 100th anniversary celebration of the group's Los Angeles chapter.\n\nSome players feel for the magnitude of the task Silver is facing.\n\n\"What, he's been three months on the job? And he has to deal with an issue like this,\" Washington's Garrett Temple said of Silver. \"It's unfair to him. ... It's going to be a difficult situation for him to take care of, and he's probably going to act swiftly as he said. And he needs to do so. It's a very tough issue. A lot of different sides. But it's more than basketball.\"\n\nSterling agreed to not attend Sunday's game, though his wife - who has filed suit against the woman alleged to be on the tape - was present.\n\nLate Sunday, Rochelle Sterling released a statement to KABC-TV in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Our family is devastated by the racist comments made by my estranged husband. My children and I do not share these despicable views or prejudices. We will not let one man's small mindedness poison the spirit of the fans and accomplishments of the team in the city we love. We are doing everything in our power to stand by and support our Clippers team.\"\n\nSterling has been the subject of many past controversies, but this, particularly at playoff time and with his own team a potential title contender, has perhaps generated more outcry than the others combined. Even President Barack Obama addressed the issue Sunday at a news conference in Malaysia.\n\nThe next move will be made by Silver.\n\n\"This is a defining moment for the league,\" Kevin Johnson said. \"It's a defining moment for the commissioner.\"\n\nâââââââââââââââ\n\nObama comments on Sterling's 'offensive, racist statements'\n\nPresident Barack Obama said Sunday that comments reportedly made by the owner of a U.S. pro basketball team are \"incredibly offensive racist statements,\" before casting them as part of a continuing legacy of slavery and segregation that Americans must confront.\n\n\"When ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance, you don't really have to do anything, you just let them talk,\" Obama said when asked to respond to the reported comments from Los Angeles Clippers' owner Donald Sterling.\n\nObama's description of the controversy as part of a larger historical context is the latest example of his continuing willingness to expound on matters of race in his second term.\n\nAfter avoiding much mention of race relations during his campaign to become the first black president and in his first term, the president last summer offered a personal reflection in response to the shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin. And now Obama has spoken out against an audio recording of a man identified as Sterling telling his girlfriend not to bring black people to games.\n\nThe firestorm over Sterling's comments has quickly engulfed the National Basketball Association.\n\nObama cast the comments through a broader prism of racism in America, adding that \"we constantly have to be on guard on racial attitudes that divide us rather than embracing our diversity as a strength.\"\n\n\"The United States continues to wrestle with the legacy of race and slavery and segregation, that's still there, the vestiges of discrimination,\" Obama said during a news conference in Malaysia, where he was traveling.\n\n\"We've made enormous strides, but you're going to continue to see this percolate up every so often,\" he added. \"And I think that we just have to be clear and steady in denouncing it, teaching our children differently, but also remaining hopeful that part of why statements like this stand out some much is because there has been this shift in how we view ourselves.\"\n\nIn the recording attributed to Sterling recording and posted on the website TMZ, a male voice questions his girlfriend's association with minorities. TMZ reported the woman, V. Stiviano, is of black and Mexican descent.\n\nThe man asks Stiviano not to broadcast her association with black people or bring black people to games. The man specifically mentions Lakers Hall of Famer Magic Johnson on the recording, saying, \"Don't bring him to my games, OK?\"\n\nObama said he's confident NBA Commissioner Adam Silver will address the matter. He said the NBA has \"an awful lot of African American players, it's steeped in African American culture. And I suspect that the NBA is going to be deeply concerned in resolving this.\"\n\nSilver had said the NBA needs to confirm authenticity of the audio tape and interview both Sterling and the woman in the recording. He called the tape \"disturbing and offensive\" and promised to investigate quickly."
