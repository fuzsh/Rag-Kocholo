        "text": "The Golden State Warriors travel south to take on the rival Clippers in a marquee NBA match-up. The 7:30 p.m. PST tip will be broadcasted live on TNT as the second game of a Thursday night double-header. The Warriors erased a ten point fourth quarter lead by the Clippers back on November 4th and rode the hot hand of Steph Curry to a 112-108 victory over Los Angeles. At 12-0 the Dubs are four straight wins away from breaking the record for most consecutive victories to start a season in NBA history.\n\nAccording to NumberFire.com, the Warriors have a 23 percent chance to at least tie the record and a 19 percent chance of breaking it. But that would obviously require a victory on the road against a tough Clippers squad. Chris Paul and J.J. Reddick are a game time decision, which could dramatically increase the odds of the Warriors rewriting the association's history books.\n\nLast Time Out\n\nThe Clippers used a dominant defensive effort in the fourth quarter to secure a 101-96 victory over the Detroit Pistons at Staples Center last Saturday. Jamal Crawford played huge on a night the Clippers were without their floor general, Chris Paul. The streaky shooter with a slick handle scored a team high 37 points along with eight assists and six rebounds. CBSSports.com James Herbert reports that both Chris Paul and J.J. Reddick are unlikely to play tonight. But I would imagine both players are chomping at the bit to get a chance to hand the undefeated Warriors their first loss of the season. Paul and Reddick are both considered to be game time decisions.\n\nThe Warriors gutted out a 115-110 victory over the Toronto Raptors at Oracle Arena on Tuesday. Golden State used a 12-0 run late in the first half to stretch their lead to 18 points. But Toronto outscored Golden State in the second half by eleven points, eventually taking the lead late in the fourth quarter. The Warriors hit shots and made stops when absolutely necessary to fend off the pesky Raptors.\n\nThe Warriors (-315) are seven and a half point favorites over the Clippers (+265). BetOnline lists the over/under line at 212.5 total points. Let's check out some betting trends hosted by OddsShark.com:\n\nWho: Golden State Warriors (12-0, 7-5 ATS) vs. Los Angeles Clippers (6-4, 4-6 ATS) vs.\n\nWhat: Game 13 of 2015/16 NBA Season, Game 1 of current 1 game road trip.\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. PST\n\nWhere: STAPLES Center, Los Angeles, California.\n\nHow to watch:\n\nNational: TNT\n\nLocal: NONE\n\nOnline: TNT Overtime\n\nRadio: KNBR 680\n\nSpread: Warriors -7.5\n\nOver/Under: 212.5\n\nMoneyline: Golden State -315, Los Angeles +265\n\nFLO's PICKS\n\nLets check out the picks from Tuesday's game against Toronto:\n\nML - GOLDEN STATE - WIN - GS 115-110\n\nATS - TORONTO +9.5 - WIN - GS by 5\n\nO/U - UNDER -207.5 - LOSS - 225 total points\n\nSeason Totals:\n\nML - 12-0 (100%)\n\nATS - 7-5 (58%)\n\nO/U - 3-9 (25%)\n\nI anticipated a close game from a scrappy Raptors squad although I have not had much luck with the over/under so far this season. Lets check out tonight's match-up against the Clippers.\n\nThe Warriors missed Shaun Livingston against Toronto forcing Steph Curry to play an unusually high 38.5 minutes. Monte Poole of CSN Bay Area tweeted that Livingston is going to miss tonight's game against the Clippers as well. Missing a backup is one thing, but in the Clippers case they might be without their team leader Chris Paul tonight. Jamal Crawford, Blake Griffin and Austin Rivers all played over 40 minutes in their last game in which Reddick and Paul did not play. Jamal Crawford can match Steph Curry offensively, but is a big liability on the defensive end. My guess is that Crawford will be guarding Klay Thompson, who seemed to find his shooting stroke against Toronto with 18 first half points. Thompson has taken advantage of his size over Crawford in past games by effectively scoring on the low block.\n\nI see the Warriors winning regardless of Paul and Reddick's status for the game. But I will say this, if I were in Vegas and had an extra $20, I'd throw it on the Clippers (+265) on the money line.\n\nHere are my picks for tonight:\n\nML - GOLDEN STATE\n\nATS - LOS ANGELES +7.5"
