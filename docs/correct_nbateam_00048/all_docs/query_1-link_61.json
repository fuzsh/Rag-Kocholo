        "text": "Pat Riley is hinting in Miami, the Celtics are posturing in Boston and the fans are chanting in Los Angeles.\n\nAll for a player whose current team is paying him more than $210,000 a game not to play for them?\n\nThis makes sense in the NBA, where the basketball is synthetic and the intelligence is artificial, which is a kinder word than the more accurate “phony.”\n\nAllen Iverson to the Clippers? At the cost of Shaun Livingston, Corey Maggette and all budget sanity? Sorry, but The Answer isn’t the answer. AI isn’t A-OK.\n\nNow, if Philadelphia is willing to take Maggette – who, for everyone’s well being, needs to be shipped somewhere – and Cuttino Mobley, the Clippers should make that deal in the time it takes for a three-second violation.\n\nOf course, if the 76ers were open to such a proposal, it sounds like Iverson already would be a Clipper instead of being a Coucher.\n\nStill, the fans at Staples Center voiced their desire for Iverson on Wednesday as their favorite team again set fire to itself. The call for a change – any change – is understandable when Chris Kaman’s hair is the best-looking thing the Clippers have going.\n\nBut not for Livingston, who is only 21, has played just 112 regular-season games and never has received consistent big-time minutes. He possesses too much potential to sacrifice for a player who would make the Clippers better today but still not good enough eventually.\n\nIverson, at 31, needs to be supplied with more than Elton Brand to win his first NBA title. And that’s what the Clippers would be after this trade. They would be Iverson and Brand and a bunch of parts standing around and still coming up short in a beastly Western Conference.\n\nRemember, Iverson spent the past two full seasons paired with Brand light – Chris Webber – and look at the mess that wrought. Everyone knows Webber isn’t Brand, no, but over those two years, he did average 20 points and nine rebounds. And the 76ers won one playoff game.\n\nFor the Heat, now, a deal makes more sense. Iverson, Dwyane Wade and an interested Shaquille O’Neal is plenty to secure another title for Riley, who should be willing to part with everything short of his retinas to acquire AI.\n\nHow such an arrangement would work financially is something for larger brains to consider, but there’s every reason for the Heat to deal for Iverson and one clear reason for the Clippers not to do so.\n\nAs for Livingston, maybe your patience is gone, which, before last season, wasn’t even a consideration for Clipper faithful. Patience? The fans of this team were more likely to be patients of some type.\n\nIf you’re tired of waiting for Livingston, consider that after 112 games in this league, Jermaine O’Neal was averaging four points and Tracy McGrady wasn’t good enough to start for a Toronto team nowhere near the playoffs.\n\nGoing from prom to pros, which is what Livingston, Jermaine O’Neal and McGrady each did, is supposed to take time. Players such as Kevin Garnett and Amare Stoudemire are freaks, not measuring sticks. Kobe Bryant didn’t start his 10th NBA game until his third season, you know.\n\nThe Iverson discussion wouldn’t even include the Clippers if they were right these days. Instead, they have multiple failing body parts, a severe disconnection between game plan and execution and an Elton Brand who remains far from being himself.\n\nJust 21 games after reaching Game7 of the conference semifinals, the Clippers find themselves being urged by their fans to make a stunning change in direction. These are many of the same fans who were so thrilled by last season that they did things like decorate their dogs in Clippers colors.\n\nAt 10-11, this ailing team appears to need a shot of something. Bourbon, perhaps. It’s almost like the Clippers, for the first time in their history, had laurels on which to rest, and by God, they were going to rest on them!\n\nSo now they have to listen to the citizens of Clipper Nation call for a coup. The very people who were delighted with a nibble want the whole Philly cheese steak, and, with Iverson, there’s always the possibility of a gooey mess plopping in everyone’s lap.\n\nHey, any sane person would want Iverson on their team. He plays remarkably hard, is absurdly tough and still can go off as well as any player other than Bryant. In a game of bigs, he’ll end up being one of the all-time smalls.\n\nBut the Clippers are wise to hold back Livingston. Anything else has the distinctive odor of buyer’s remorse. And right now, too much about this Clippers season already stinks."
