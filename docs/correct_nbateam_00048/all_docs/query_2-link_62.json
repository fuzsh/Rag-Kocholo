        "text": "PEORIA — Shaun Livingston offered some clarity on his basketball future this week at his Pride of Peoria basketball camp at Peoria High School.\n\nSince the Golden State Warriors released Livingston two weeks ago, guaranteeing him $2 million of a $7.7 million contract buyout, reports have swirled around the 33-year-old Peorian’s options.\n\nLivingston acknowledged that retirement is certainly an option. But his preference is to play one more year with a desirable NBA team.\n\n“At this point, it’s more about finishing my career the right way,” he said. “Going to where the fit is right as far as what I can bring to the table. Coming in and helping a team from a leadership standpoint, helping mentor the young guys and playing spot minutes … I’m at the stage of my career where those are the things where I add the most value.”\n\nAnd there is one club in particular – the Los Angeles Clippers, with whom he began his pro career 15 years ago -- that would make Livingston’s decision for him if they come calling.\n\n“That would be awesome, the ideal fit,” Livingston said. “That would be a part of coming full circle. But it has to work on their end. If there’s a spot, an opportunity, that would probably make the most sense. There’s been some interest (on the Clippers’ part). It’s about whether they’re ready to pull the trigger.”\n\nThe appeal of the Clippers to Livingston increased multifold following the team’s recent signings of NBA All-Stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. The acquisitions have catapulted the franchise from a perennial also-ran to the early NBA favorites for 2019-20.\n\n“I know he wants to play one more year — for the Clippers or maybe another contender,” said Shaun’s father, Peorian Reggie Livingston. “But if that didn’t work out and he retired, that wouldn’t bother me one bit. He’s got three (World Championship) rings. Who would have thought a kid from Peoria would have three rings? Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing don’t have one.”\n\nOthers close to Livingston echoed those thoughts.\n\n“I’d like to see him play another year,” said former Peoria High teammate Daniel Ruffin. “I think he’s got something left in the tank. And then maybe he could go into an (NBA) front office or coaching job. He’d be good at that.”\n\nSaid ex-PHS coach Chuck Buescher: “I’d like to see him keep playing for another year or two. I think he still has a lot to offer. Whatever he chooses, great. But he’s got a lot of opportunities ahead of him.”\n\nA part of Livingston’s decision revolves around his health. The horrific left knee injury in 2007 that derailed his career and then forced him into a part-time role for most of his ensuing playing days has become more troublesome with age.\n\nHe’s dealt with an assortment of other ailments as well that have made just getting ready to play a full-time job.\n\n“Cold tub, hot tub, cryotherapy, massage therapy, weight room, ice baths,” he said. “It’s constant, constant, constant. If I’m doing all that and still feeling the way I’m feeling, those are yellow and red flags. Back-to-back games are a lot harder now. I feel like I’ve aged a lot faster with the injuries catching up.”\n\nBut Livingston’s unique talent as a 6-foot-7 playmaker who can guard most anyone on the floor well along with his willingness to serve in a backup role have enabled him to fashion a long and lucrative hoops career.\n\n“You look at his stats and you shrug,” Ruffin said. “But he’s the kind of player every team needs. That’s why he’s lasted so long.”\n\nNearly as valuable are Livingston’s people skills. Aside from his leadership ability within a team, Livingston is all about his efforts in the community, whether it be Oakland or Peoria.\n\nHe holds two camps in his hometown every summer. Campers pay nothing to the Pride of Peoria event. Some 240 kids are participating this year, a number so overwhelming that registration had to be shut down.\n\n“It still gives me (a thrill) giving back to the community and working with kids,” he said. “To share your experiences with them hopefully can help them down the road.”\n\nWhen Reggie Livingston picked up his son at the Peoria airport Monday night, the first thing Shaun wanted to do was go to the hospital to visit two special long-term patients -- Reggie’s good friend, Don Johnson and Peoria basketball legend Howard Nathan.\n\n“He’s a good kid,” Reggie said of Shaun. “I always taught him to care for people and to be an example in life. I’m proud he’s my son.”\n\nShaun is hopeful his immediate future will be determined within the next month.\n\n“Rosters are being filled up right now,” he said. “If an opportunity comes up and it makes sense on my end, I’ll jump at that opportunity. If it doesn’t, it’s been a helluva ride.”"
