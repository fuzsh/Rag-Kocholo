        "text": "Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, one of the deadliest one-two punches in NBA history, scored 20 total points on 8-of-27 combined shooting in the Golden State Warriors 104-89 win against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nIt was the supporting cast that came through for the defending champs. Particularly, veteran backup point guard Shaun Livingston, who scored 20 points on 8-of-10 shooting to go with four rebounds and three assists in 27 minutes on the floor.\n\nIt was the best game of his postseason career, and it couldn't have come and a more opportune time.\n\n\"Just really proud of the way everybody contributed,\" Curry said. \"You don't win championships without the entire squad coming in and making an impact on games, and the way obviously Shaun came in was so composed, got to his spots, had that confidence to know them down.\"\n\nLivingston, who— standing at 6-7 — usually has at least a couple of inches on opposing point guards, is toughest to guard when he gets near the paint and elevates over his defender. He did just that in Game 1, knocking down all eight of his shots within 16 feet of the basket.\n\n\"Obviously game ball goes to Shaun Livingston,\" LeBron James said. \"He gave them a huge spark.\""
