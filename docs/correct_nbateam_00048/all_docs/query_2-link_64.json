        "text": "After trusting his presence with his steady play and calming locker room presence for the past fours year, the Warriors have agreed with Shaun Livingston to delay when to reach a decision on his future on July 10. By doing this, the Warriors have more flexibility with assembling their roster in free-agency, while Livingston has more time to contemplate his future. ESPN first reported the news.\n\nThe Warriors originally had until Sunday to decide whether to keep Livingston, or else all of his $7.7 million of next season’s contract would have become fully guaranteed. If the Warriors waive Livingston, only $2 million of his last year will be guaranteed.\n\nThe Warriors, which might have a payroll as high as $375 million, may not want to absorb the extra $5.7 million and the nearly $20 million in luxury taxes for a point guard that had become limited last season with chronic injuries. Livingston, who will turn 34 in September, has told Bay Area News Group and other outlets, that he would consider retiring after the 2019-10 season partly because of those ailments. He had left his options open so that he could further reflect during the offseason and consult with his family.\n\nIf the Warriors part ways with Livingston, he may be open toward playing for the Los Angeles Clippers or Los Angeles Lakers. It appears likely, though, that Livingston will retire to cap off a 15-year NBA career. He admitted feeling frustration last season when he averaged a career-low in points (4.0) and second-lowest in assists (1.8). The Warriors never evaluated Livingston on his numbers, but he also missed a combined 16 games last season because of various ailments to his left knee, right foot and neck as well as for rest purposes.\n\n| THE KD FREE AGENCY TRACKER: Go here for one-stop, rumor-mill shopping |\n\nLivingston had also expressed interest in joining a team’s front office, and the Warriors are open toward that idea. They have long valued his basketball smarts and collaboration. All of which made him a valuable role player for the Warriors in the past four years. And, to think, it appeared unlikely Livingston would ever have such a role.\n\nThree years after the Los Angeles Clippers selected Livingston No. 4 overall in the 2004 NBA draft directly out of high school, Livingston suffered what was presumed to be a career-ending injury. On Feb. 26, 2007, Livingston went up in the air for a fast-break layup before his left foot landed at a nearly 90-degree angle. He had broken his left leg and dislocated his left knee cap. He had torn his anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament and lateral meniscus. And he also sprained his medial collateral ligament.\n\nLivingston missed 101 of 246 regular-season games in his first three seasons. After receiving clearance to resume playing basketball in the 2008 offseason, Livingston then bounced around with nine NBA teams and one Development League affiliate before joining the Warriors for their 2015 NBA championship run.\n\nSince then, the Warriors leaned on Livingston for being reliable as a playmaker, post-up shooter and defender. Livingston also shared duties with Andre Iguodala with mentoring the team’s bench.\n\nGet the latest Warriors news by subscribing to Bay Area News Group.
