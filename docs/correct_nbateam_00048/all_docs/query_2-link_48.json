        "text": "OAKLAND, Calif. -- In hopes to shed salary and enhance roster flexibility, the Warriors will waive veteran Shaun Livingston before his $7.7 million contract becomes fully guaranteed on Wednesday, a league source confirmed to Bay Area News Group. ESPN first reported the news.\n\nThe Warriors had planned to part ways with Livingston's salary, but they had mutually agreed to push back making a decision to July 10 so they could assemble most of their roster first. The Warriors also explored trading Livingston, but it became difficult to find anyone willing to take on salary for a player that had fought various ailments in his 15th NBA season. By waiving Livingston, the Warriors will only owe him about $2.2 million of his $7 million contract. The Warriors plan to stretch out those payments through the next three seasons, equaling about $733,000 per year.\n\nThe Warriors mostly made that move so their payroll could be closer to the so-called hard cap put in place after agreeing to acquire D'Angelo Russell as part of a sign-and-trade to Brooklyn for Kevin Durant. It also did not help, though, that Livingston averaged a career-low in points (4.0) and second-lowest in assists (1.8). The Warriors never evaluated Livingston on his numbers, but he also missed a combined 16 games last season because of various ailments to his left knee, right foot and neck as well as for rest purposes.\n\nLivingston, who will turn 34 in September, has told Bay Area News Group and other outlets that he would consider retiring after the 2019-20 season partly because of those ailments. He had left his options open so that he could further reflect during the offseason and consult with his family. Despite the Warriors' planned cost-cutting move, Livingston may be interested in joining a championship contender.\n\nLivingston had also expressed interest in joining a team's front office, and the Warriors are open toward that idea. They have long valued his basketball smarts and collaboration. All of which made him a valuable role player for the Warriors in the past four years. And, to think, it appeared unlikely Livingston would ever have such a role.\n\nThree years after the Los Angeles Clippers selected Livingston No. 4 overall in the 2004 NBA draft directly out of high school, Livingston suffered what was presumed to be a career-ending injury. On Feb. 26, 2007, Livingston went up in the air for a fast-break layup before his left foot landed at a nearly 90-degree angle. He had broken his left leg and dislocated his left knee cap. He had torn his anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament and lateral meniscus. And he also sprained his medial collateral ligament.\n\nLivingston missed 101 of 246 regular-season games in his first three seasons. After receiving clearance to resume playing basketball in the 2008 offseason, Livingston then bounced around with nine NBA teams and one Development League affiliate before joining the Warriors for their 2015 NBA championship run."
