        "text": "Jason Momoa has a new love interest in his life.\n\nAfter finalizing his divorce from Lisa Bonet in January 2024, the Aquaman star confirmed his relationship with actress Adria Arjona in May.\n\nIn a gallery of photos shared on Instagram, Momoa can be seen hugging Arjona during a dinner in Japan, calling the actress his “amor.” Their Instagram debut comes shortly after Momoa revealed he had a girlfriend at the Basingstoke Comic Con in England. \"I am very much in a relationship,\" he said at the time, teasing about his partner’s identity, \"You'll find out very soon.\"\n\nWhile talking to Entertainment Tonight in June 2024, Momoa said that Arjona has become his motorcycle riding partner. \"My lady likes to ride. Any excuse for more hugs,\" he said.\n\nIn August 2024, a source told PEOPLE that Momoa \"spends a lot of time with\" Arjona these days.\n\n\"She makes him happy. She's very adventurous and down-to-earth as well,\" the source said. \"They love the outdoors and enjoy motorcycle rides.\"\n\nBefore Arjona, Momoa briefly dated Eiza González for a few months in 2022, after he and Bonet announced their separation in January 2022.\n\nMomoa is best known for his roles in Game of Thrones and Aquaman, and Arjona has been making a name for herself in the film industry, with roles in 2022’s Morbius and Netflix’s 2024 film Hit Man alongside Glen Powell.\n\nHere’s everything to know about Adria Arjona.\n\nShe’s from Puerto Rico\n\nArjona was born on April 25, 1992 in San Juan, Puerto Rico to parents Leslie Torres and Ricardo Arjona. Though she was born in Puerto Rico, she spent her childhood in Mexico City and lived there until she was a teenager.\n\nSpeaking with Numéro Netherlands, she discussed her eclectic background, noting that she “grew up all over the place,” and has Guatemalan roots on her dad’s side.\n\n“I feel very Puerto Rican when I’m in the island. I feel very Guatemalan when I’m in Guatemala. I feel Mexican when I’m in Mexico,” she explained. “I don’t know where I identify from, that’s really hard for me. And even when I speak Spanish, no one can really catch my accent. I’m proud to be Puerto Rican, I am proud to be Guatemalan, I am proud to have been raised in Mexico, but I’m also proud that I don’t feel like I belong anywhere. And that’s helped me through my acting. I don’t have tied roots anywhere. “\n\nHer father is a Guatemalan singer\n\nArjona isn’t the only person in her family involved in the entertainment industry. Her father is internationally renowned singer and songwriter Ricardo Arjona. Speaking with PEOPLE CHICA in March 2018, she noted that her father inspires her in her own career.\n\n“He motivates me and pushes my limits and makes sure that I’m always growing as an artist,” she said. “He is constantly making me cultivate my head, not just my physicality.”\n\nShe added that her family members have been her biggest supporters of her growing career. “My whole family is excited and super supportive in what I do,” she said. “My dad is my No. 1 fan. He shows my clips to all of his friends and it’s really cute. I’m happy that I can make him proud.”\n\nShe studied at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute\n\nAfter leaving Mexico at age 12 and moving to Miami, Arjona eventually found herself in New York City when she turned 18. There, she worked to make her acting career a reality as she studied at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute.\n\nIn between classes, she worked as a waitress and hostess in New York City to make ends meet. “I learned the value of money and working hard,” she told PEOPLE CHICA of the experience. “It helped me because I got to be on my feet. And I think today I can do 16-hour days thanks to being a waitress.”\n\nShe got her breakout playing Dorothy Gale\n\nFollowing a number of featured roles, including those in Pacific Rim Uprising, Life of the Party and a recurring role on True Detective, Arjona got her breakout role playing Dorothy Gale on the Oz book adaptation Emerald City. Though the series was canceled after one season, she has booked a number of notable roles since.\n\nSome of her biggest roles include Morbius, Father of the Bride, Good Omens and Andor. She is also set to star alongside Glen Powell in the Netflix romantic action comedy Hit Man.\n\nShe was previously married\n\nLike Momoa, Arjona was previously married. She tied the knot with lawyer Edgardo Canales in 2019, and they attended the Vanity Fair Oscars party in 2020. Their relationship was kept very private, so it's unclear when they split.\n\nShe and Jason Momoa seemingly met while filming Sweet Girl\n\nBefore they started dating, Arjona and Momoa starred alongside each other in the 2021 film Sweet Girl. Principal photography for the project started in November 2019, which is likely when they first met.\n\nShe and Jason Momoa went public with their relationship in May 2024\n\nIn May 2024, Momoa went Instagram official with Arjona by posting a photo of him hugging the actress as they dined together in Japan. \"Japan, you are a dream come true you blew my mind,\" he wrote on Instagram on May 20. \"We're so thankful for everyone who opened their homes, making memories with new friends and old friends, sharing another amazing adventure with mi amor.\"\n\nMomoa had previously teased he was dating someone during an appearance at the Basingstoke Comic Con in England earlier in the month. \"I am very much in a relationship,\" he said at the time, adding, \"you'll find out very soon\" who she was.\n\nShe’s working with Jason Momoa’s stepdaughter on a new project\n\nAmong her many acting credits, Arjona is slated to star alongside Naomi Ackie, Channing Tatum, Christian Slater and more in the upcoming Blink Twice, directed by Bonet's daughter Zoë Kravitz."
