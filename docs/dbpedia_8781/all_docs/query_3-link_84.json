        "text": "Adria Arjona is on the rise. After recently scoring her first series regular role in TNT’s untitled Miami drama and her first recurring stints on CBS’ Person Of Interest and the upcoming season of HBO’s True Detective, the young actress has landed her first series lead. Arjona has been cast as Dorothy in Emerald City, NBC‘s 10-episode straight-to-series Wizard Of Oz drama. The project, originally developed during the 2013-14 season, was recently resurrected with a new writer/executive producer, David Schulner. He is now joined by Shaun Cassidy, who also will serve as executive producer.\n\nDescribed as a modern and dark reimagining of the classic tale of Oz in the vein of Game Of Thrones, drawing upon stories from Baum’s original 14 books, Emerald City hails from Universal TV.\n\nThis is one of two Dorothys that NBC is casting this simmer. The network recently put out an open casting call for a young actress to play the lead in its live staging of The Wiz.\n\nPuerto Rico-born, Mexico City-raised Arjona is repped by UTA and One Entertainment."
