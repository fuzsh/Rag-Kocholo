        "text": "Field of Study: Practical Theology\n\nRubén Arjona is an ordained minister in the National Presbyterian Church of Mexico. Before being appointed to the faculty of Union Presbyterian Seminary he served as Assistant Professor of Pastoral Theology and Care at Iliff School of Theology in Denver, CO.\n\nInspired by his work in various congregations in Mexico City and his mentorship of students in Mexican seminaries, Arjona pursued graduate studies in pastoral care and pastoral theology at Princeton Theological Seminary. In addition to serving as an instructor in seminaries in his native Mexico, Dr. Arjona served his denomination as executive secretary of its board of education and moderator of the Berea Presbytery in Mexico City.\n\nDr. Arjona has published several works in Spanish, including his undergraduate thesis on John Calvin’s missions to France, published by the Centro Basilea de Investigación y Apoyo under the auspices of the Fondation pour l’Aide au Protestantimse Réformé (FAP). More recently, Dr. Arjona has published several peer-reviewed articles in Pastoral Psychology and the Journal of Pastoral Theology.\n\nDr. Arjona’s research interests include the pastoral care of men, the intersections of pastoral care and liberation theologies, the care of couples and families, the care of LGBTQ+ individuals, and Erik H. Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development. One of his deepest passions is the care of theological students, which for him includes accompanying some of his former students in Mexico as well as mentoring international students pursuing theological studies in the United States."
