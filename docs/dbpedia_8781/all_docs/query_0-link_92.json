        "text": "History | Umayyad rule | High and Late Middle Ages | Modern history | Geography : Location | Gardens, parks and natural environments | Museums | Festivals | Sport | Transport : Rail : Air : Road\n\nüá™üá∏ C√≥rdoba, or Cordova in English, is a city in Andalusia, southern Spain, and the capital of the province of C√≥rdoba. It is the third most populated municipality in Andalusia, and the 11th overall in the country.\n\nThe city primarily lies on the right bank of the Guadalquivir, in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. Once a Roman settlement, it was taken over by the Visigoths, followed by the Muslim conquests in the eighth century and later becoming the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate of C√≥rdoba. During these Muslim periods, C√≥rdoba was transformed into a world leading centre of education and learning, producing figures such as Maimonides, Averroes, Ibn Hazm, and Al-Zahrawi, and by the 10th century it had grown to be the second-largest city in Europe. Following the Christian conquest in 1236, it became part of the Crown of Castile.\n\nC√≥rdoba is home to notable examples of Moorish architecture such as the Mezquita-Catedral, which was named as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984 and is now a cathedral. The UNESCO status has since been expanded to encompass the whole historic centre of C√≥rdoba, Medina-Azahara and Festival de los Patios. C√≥rdoba has more World Heritage Sites than anywhere in the world, with four.\n\n1\n\nHistory The first traces of human presence in the area are remains of a Neanderthal Man, dating to c. 42,000 to 35,000 BC. Pre-urban settlements around the mouth of the Guadalquivir river are known to have existed from the 8th century BC. The population gradually learned copper and silver metallurgy. The first historical mention of a settlement dates to the Carthaginian expansion across the Guadalquivir. C√≥rdoba was conquered by the Romans in 206 BC.\n\nIn 169 BC, Roman consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus (grandson of Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who had governed both Hispania Ulterior and Hispania Citerior, respectively), founded a Latin colony alongside the pre-existing Iberian settlement. The date is contested; it could have been founded in 152 BC. Between 143 and 141 BC the town was besieged by Viriatus. A Roman forum is known to have existed in the city in 113 BC. The famous Cordoba Treasure, with mixed local and Roman artistic traditions, was buried in the city at this time; it is now in the British Museum.\n\nCorduba became a Roman colonia with the name Colonia Patricia, between 46 and 45 BC. It was sacked by Caesar in 45 because of its fealty to Pompey, and resettled with veteran soldiers by Augustus. It became the capital of Baetica, with a forum and numerous temples, and was the main centre of Roman intellectual life in Hispania Ulterior. The Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger, his father, the orator Seneca the Elder, and his nephew, the poet Lucan came from Roman C√≥rdoba.\n\nIn the late Roman period, Corduba's bishop Hosius (Ossius) was the dominant figure of the western Church throughout the earlier 4th century. Later, Corduba occupied an important place in the Provincia Hispaniae of the Byzantine Empire (552‚Äì572) and under the Visigoths, who conquered it in the late 6th century.\n\n1\n\nUmayyad rule C√≥rdoba was captured by the Muslims in 711 or 712. Unlike other Iberian towns, no capitulation was signed and the position was taken by storm. C√≥rdoba was in turn governed by direct Arab rule. The new Umayyad commanders established themselves within the city and in 716 it became the provincial capital, subordinate to the Caliphate of Damascus, replacing Seville. In Arabic it was known as ŸÇÿ±ÿ∑ÿ®ÿ© (Qur·π≠uba).\n\nThe centre of the Roman and Visigothic cities became the walled medina. Over time, as many as 21 suburbs (ÿ±Ÿéÿ®Ÿéÿ∂ raba·∏ç, pl. ÿ£Ÿéÿ±Ÿíÿ®Ÿéÿßÿ∂ arbƒÅ·∏ç) developed around the city.\n\nIn 747, a battle in the surroundings of C√≥rdoba, the Battle of Saqunda took place, pitting Arab Yemenites against northerner Qays.\n\nFollowing the Abbasid ousting of the Umayyad Caliphate after 750, surviving Umayyad figure Abd ar-Rahman crossed to the Iberian Peninsula in 756. He proclaimed himself emir, known as Abd ar-Rahman I, and established his dynasty in C√≥rdoba once the rump wƒÅli Yusuf was defeated at a battle outside the city in May 756. In 785‚Äì786 (169 AH) he ordered construction of the Great Mosque of C√≥rdoba, which was completed the next year and underwent later expansions under his successors.\n\nHistorians' estimations of C√≥rdoba's population during the ninth century range from 75,000 to 160,000. The ruthless repression of the 818 revolt in the southern suburb of C√≥rdoba led to the destruction of the place. In the 10th and 11th centuries C√≥rdoba was one of the most advanced cities in the world, and a great cultural, political, financial and economic centre.\n\nC√≥rdoba had a prosperous economy, with manufactured goods including leather, metal work, glazed tiles and textiles, and agricultural produce including a range of fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, and materials such as cotton, flax and silk. It was also famous as a centre of learning, home to over 80 libraries and institutions of learning, with knowledge of medicine, mathematics, astronomy, botany far exceeding the rest of Europe at the time. Later, the vizier al-Mansur ‚Äì the de facto ruler of al-Andalus from 976 to 1002 ‚Äì burned most of the books on philosophy from the library of Caliph al-Hakam II to appease Maliki jurists (ulama); most of the others were sold off or perished in the civil strife not long after.\n\nAfter a period of weak central rule, Abd ar-Rahman III came to power as emir in 912 and campaigned lengthily and systematically to re-establish the authority of C√≥rdoba across Al-Andalus. In 929, after years of military and diplomatic efforts, he felt confident enough to declare himself \"caliph\", a title challenging the Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad and the Fatimid caliphs in North Africa. This inaugurated the height of C√≥rdoba's power and influence in the 10th century. This century saw the construction of two palatine cities in the surroundings of C√≥rdoba: Madƒ´nat al-ZahrƒÅ to the west, built by Abd ar-Rahman III, and another one built later by al-Mansur (Medina Alzahira) to the east. The economic historian J. Bradford DeLong estimates the city's population at 400,000 around 1000 AD, while estimates from other historians range from 100,000 to 1,000,000 during the same era. Whatever C√≥rdoba's population was, the city's apogee came to an abrupt halt after the 1009 crisis.\n\nOn 15 February 1009, with Hisham II as caliph and Sanchuelo as hajib (and de facto ruler), a revolution broke out in C√≥rdoba, which led to the proclamation of an alternative caliph. This marked the beginning of a long period of civil war and conflict in Al-Andalus known as the Fitna. Berbers entered and sacked C√≥rdoba in May 1013. Hisham III was routed from C√≥rdoba on 30 November 1031 and an oligarchic republic replaced the caliphate.\n\n1\n\nHigh and Late Middle Ages Under rule of the Banu Yahwar, Cordobese power did not extend far from the city, as other independent polities emerged in the rest of the former caliphate. An estimation of 65,000 inhabitants has been proposed for 11th-century C√≥rdoba.\n\nIn 1070, forces from the Abbadid Taifa of Seville entered C√≥rdoba to help in the defence of the city, that had been besieged by Al-Mamun, ruler of Toledo, yet they took control and expelled the last ruler of the taifa of C√≥rdoba, Abd-Al Malik, forcing him to exile. Al-Mamun did not cease in his efforts to take the city, and making use of a Sevillian renegade who murdered the Abbadid governor, he triumphantly entered the city on 15 February 1075, only to die there barely five months later, apparently poisoned. C√≥rdoba was seized by force in March 1091 by the Almoravids. In 1121, the population revolted against the abuses of the Almoravid governor.\n\nSworn enemies of the Almohads, Ibn Mardanƒ´≈° (the \"Wolf King\") and his stepfather Ibrahim Ibn Hamusk allied with Alfonso VIII of Castile and laid siege on C√≥rdoba by 1158‚Äì1160, ravaging the surroundings but failing to take the city.\n\nAlmohad caliph Abdallah al-Adil appointed Al-Bayyasi (brother of Zayd Abu Zayd) as governor of C√≥rdoba in 1224, only to see the later became independent from Caliphal rule. Al-Bayyasi asked Ferdinand III of Castile for help and C√≥rdoba revolted against him. Years later, in 1229, the city submitted to the authority of Ibn Hud, disavowing him in 1233, joining instead the territories under Muhammad Ibn al-A·∏•mar, ruler of Arjona and soon-to-be emir of Granada.\n\nFerdinand III entered the city on 29 June 1236, following a siege of several months. According to Arab sources, C√≥rdoba fell on 23 Shawwal 633 (that is, on 30 June 1236, a day later than Christian tradition). Upon the city's conquest the mosque was converted into a Catholic cathedral dedicated to the Virgin Mary (Santa Maria). This was also followed by the return to Santiago de Compostela of the church bells that had been looted by Almanzor and moved to C√≥rdoba by Christian war prisoners in the late 10th century. Ferdinand III granted the city a fuero in 1241; it was based on the Liber Iudiciorum and in the customs of Toledo, yet formulated in an original way. The city was divided into 14 colaciones, and numerous new church buildings were added.\n\nIn 1277 the city was unsuccessfully besieged by a joint Marinid - Granadian army under the command of Marinid Sultan Abu Yusuf Ya‚Äôqub. The a few years later a joint Castilian-Marinid army under Alfonso X (at war with his son Sancho) also unsuccessfully besieged the city\n\nMany decades after during the Third Siege of Gibraltar in 1333, a diversionary Granadian army raided the countryside of Cordoba and encamped on the far side of the Roman Bridge of Cordoba. However the diversionary army had to return to Gibraltar to help their Marinid counterparts so no further action was taken. In 1368 for the last time the Muslims attempted to capture the city in a joint effort with Peter I of Castile. The city was on the verge of falling before an outpour of rain forced the attackers encamped on the plains south of Cordoba to leave.\n\n1\n\nModern history In the context of the Early Modern Period, the city experienced a golden age between 1530 and 1580, profiting from an economic activity based on the trade of agricultural products and the preparation of clothes originally from Los Pedroches, peaking at a population of about 50,000 by 1571. A period of stagnation and ensuing decline followed.\n\nIt was reduced to 20,000 inhabitants in the 18th century. The population and economy started to increase again only in the early 20th century. The second half of the 19th century saw the arrival of railway transport via the opening of the Seville‚ÄìC√≥rdoba line on 2 June 1859.\n\nC√≥rdoba was connected by railway to Jerez and C√°diz in 1861 and, in 1866, following the link with Manzanares, with Madrid. The city was eventually connected to M√°laga and Belmez.\n\nOn 18 July 1936, the military governor of the province, Colonel Ciriaco Cascajo launched the Nationalist coup in the city, bombing the civil government and arresting the civil governor, Rodr√≠guez de Le√≥n; these actions ignited the Spanish Civil War. Following the orders of the putschist General Queipo de Llano, he declared a state of war. The putschists were met by the resistance of the political and social representatives who had gathered in the civil government headquarters, and remained there until the Nationalist rifle fire and the presence of artillery broke their morale. When its defenders began fleeing the building, Rodr√≠guez de Le√≥n finally decided to surrender and was arrested.\n\nIn the following weeks, Queipo de Llano and Major Bruno Iba√±ez carried out a bloody repression in which 2,000 persons were executed. The ensuing Francoist repression in wartime and in the immediate post-war period (1936‚Äì1951) is estimated to have led to around 9,579 killings in the province.\n\nThe Mosque-Cathedral was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, and in 1994 this status was extended to the entire historic centre of C√≥rdoba. The city has a number of modern areas, including the district of Zoco and the area surrounding the railway station.\n\nThe regional government (the Junta de Andaluc√≠a) has for some time been studying the creation of a C√≥rdoba Metropolitan Area that would comprise, in addition to the capital itself, the towns of Villafranca de C√≥rdoba, Obejo, La Carlota, Villaharta, Villaviciosa, Almod√≥var del R√≠o and Guadalc√°zar. The combined population of such an area would be around 351,000.\n\n1\n\nGeography: Location C√≥rdoba is located in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, in the depression formed by the Guadalquivir river, that cuts across the city in an east-north east to west-south west direction. The wider municipality extends across an area of 1,254.25 km2, making it the largest municipality in Andalusia and the fourth largest in Spain.\n\nThe city of C√≥rdoba lies in the middle course of the river. Three major landscape units in the municipality include the Sierra (as in the southern reaches of Sierra Morena), the Valley proper and the Campi√±a.\n\nThe differences in elevation in the Valley are very small, ranging from 100 and 170 metres above sea level, with the city proper located at an average altitude of roughly 125 metres above sea level. The landscape of the valley is further subdivided in the piedmont connecting with the Sierra, the fluvial terraces and the most immediate vicinity of the river course.\n\nThe Miocene Campi√±a, located in the southern bank of the Guadalquivir, features a hilly landscape gently increasing in height up to about 200 m. In the Sierra, to the north of the city, the altitude increases relatively abruptly up to 500 meters. Both the Sierra and the Campi√±a display viewpoints over the valley.\n\n1\n\nGardens, parks and natural environments ‚Ä¢\n\nJardines de la Victoria. Within the gardens there are two newly renovated facilities, the old Caseta del C√≠rculo de la Amistad, today Caseta Victoria, and the Kiosko de la m√∫sica, as well as a small Modernist fountain from the early 20th century. The northern section, called Jardines of Duque de Rivas, features a pergola of neoclassical style, designed by the architect Carlos S√°enz de Santamar√≠a; it is used as an exhibition hall and a caf√© bar. ‚Ä¢ Jardines de la Agricultura, located between the Jardines de la Victoria and the Paseo de C√≥rdoba: it includes numerous trails that radially converge to a round square which has a fountain or pond. This is known as the duck pond, and, in the centre, has an island with a small building in which these animals live. Scattered throughout the garden are numerous sculptures such as the sculpture in memory of Julio Romero de Torres, the sculpture to the composer Julio Aumente and the bust of Mateo Inurria. In the north is a rose garden in form of a labyrinth. ‚Ä¢ Parque de Miraflores, located on the south bank of the river Guadalquivir. It was designed by the architect Juan Cuenca Montilla as a series of terraces. Among other points of interest as the Salam and Miraflores Bridge and a sculpture by Agust√≠n Ibarrola. ‚Ä¢ Parque Cruz Conde, located south-west of the city, is an open park and barrier-free park in English gardens style. ‚Ä¢ Paseo de C√≥rdoba. Located on the underground train tracks, it is a long tour of several km in length with more than 434,000 m2. The tour has numerous fountains, including six formed by a portico of falling water which form a waterfall to a pond with four levels. Integrated into the tour is a pond of water from the Roman era, and the building of the old train station of RENFE, now converted into offices of Canal Sur. ‚Ä¢ Jardines Juan Carlos I, in the Ciudad Jard√≠n neighborhood. It is a fortress which occupies an area of about 12,500 square metres. ‚Ä¢ Jardines del Conde de Vallellano, located on both sides of the avenue of the same name. It includes a large L-shaped pond with a capacity of 3,000 m3 (105,944.00 cu ft) and archaeological remains embedded in the gardens, among which is a Roman cistern from the second half of the 1st century BC. ‚Ä¢ Parque de la Asomadilla, with a surface of 27 hectares, is the second largest park in Andalusia. The park recreates a Mediterranean forest vegetation, such as hawthorn, pomegranate, hackberry, oak, olive, tamarisk, cypress, elms, pines, oaks and carob trees among others. ‚Ä¢ Balc√≥n del Guadalquivir. ‚Ä¢ Jardines de Col√≥n. ‚Ä¢ Sotos de la Albolafia. Declared Natural monument by the Andalusian Autonomous Government, it is located in a stretch of the Guadalquivir river from the Roman Bridge and the San Rafael Bridge, with an area of 21.36 hectares. Host a large variety of birds and is an important point of migration for many birds. ‚Ä¢ Parque periurbano Los Villares.\n\n1\n\nMuseums The Archaeological and Ethnological Museum of C√≥rdoba is a provincial museum located near the Guadalquivir River. The museum was officially opened in 1867 and shared space with the Museum of Fine Arts until 1920. In 1960, the museum was relocated to the Renaissance Palace of P√°ez de Castillo where it remains to present day. The Archaeological and Ethnological Museum has eight halls which contain pieces from the middle to late Bronze Age, to Roman culture, Visigothic art, and Islamic culture.\n\nThe Julio Romero de Torres Museum is located next to the Guadalquivir and was opened in November 1931. The home of Julio Romero de Torres, has undergone many renovations and been turned into a museum and it has also been home to several other historical institutions such as the Archaeological Museum (1868-1917) and the Museum of Fine Arts. Many of the works include paintings and motifs done by Julio Romero de Torres himself.\n\nThe Fine Arts Museum of C√≥rdoba is located next to the Julio Romero de Torres Museum which it shares a courtyard with. The building originally was for the old Hospital for Charity but after that the building went under many renovations and renewals to become the renaissance style building it is today. The Museum of Fine Arts contains many works from the baroque period, medieval renaissance art, work from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, drawings, mannerist art and other unique works.\n\nThe Diocesan Museum is located in the C√≥rdoba's Episcopal Palace which was built upon the former Umayyad alc√°zar. The collection within houses many paintings, sculptures and furniture.\n\nAnother museum within C√≥rdoba are the Caliphal Baths.\n\n1\n\nFestivals Tourism is especially intense in C√≥rdoba during May as this month hosts three of the most important annual festivals in the city: ‚Ä¢ Las Cruces de Mayo (The May Crosses of C√≥rdoba). This festival takes place at the beginning of the month. During three or four days, crosses of around 3m height are placed in many squares and streets and decorated with flowers and a contest is held to choose the most beautiful one. Usually there is regional food and music near the crosses. ‚Ä¢ Los Patios de C√≥rdoba (The Courtyards Festival of C√≥rdoba - World Heritage). This festival is celebrated during the second and third week of the month. Many houses of the historic centre open their private patios to the public and compete in a contest. Both the architectonic value and the floral decorations are taken into consideration to choose the winners. It is usually very difficult and expensive to find accommodation in the city during the festival. ‚Ä¢ La Feria de C√≥rdoba (The Fair of C√≥rdoba). This festival takes place at the end of the month and is similar to the better known Seville Fair with some differences, mainly that the Sevilla Fair has majority private casetas (tents run by local businesses), while the C√≥rdoba Fair has majority public ones.\n\n1\n\nSport C√≥rdoba's main sports team is its association football team, C√≥rdoba CF, which plays in the Spanish Segunda Divisi√≥n B following a brief one-season tenure in La Liga during the 2014‚Äì15 season. Home matches are played at the Estadio Nuevo Arc√°ngel, which has 20,989 seats.\n\nC√≥rdoba also has a professional futsal team, C√≥rdoba Patrimonio de la Humanidad, which plays in the Primera Divisi√≥n de Futsal. The local youth basketball club, CD Cordobasket, had a professional team which played in the Liga EBA for three seasons before going on hiatus in August 2019. The futsal team plays the majority of its home games at the 3,500 seat Palacio Municipal de Deportes Vista Alegre.\n\n1\n\nTransport: Rail C√≥rdoba railway station is connected by high speed trains to the following Spanish cities: Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, M√°laga and Zaragoza. More than 20 trains per day connect the downtown area, in 54 minutes, with M√°laga Mar√≠a Zambrano station, which provides interchange capability to destinations along the Costa del Sol, including M√°laga Airport.\n\n1\n\nTransport: Air C√≥rdoba has an airport, although there are no airlines operating commercial flights on it. The closest airports to the city are Seville Airport (110 km as the crow flies), Granada Airport (118 km) and M√°laga Airport (136 km).\n\n1\n\nTransport: Road The city is also well connected by highways with the rest of the country and Portugal.\n\nIntercity buses The main bus station is located next to the train station. Several bus companies operate intercity bus services to and from C√≥rdoba.\n\n1"
