        "text": "City\n\nGranada is the capital city of the province with the same name, located in south-eastern Spain between the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and the Andalusian hinterland. The city is located at the foot of Sierra Nevada, the highest mountain range of the Iberian peninsula. With more than a thousand years of recorded history, Granada enjoys one of Spain's most important cultural and architectural patrimonies. Besides the Alhambra, the world renowned palaces and fortresses of the Nasrid dynasty, and the historical Moorish quarter Albaicin, both designated as Patrimony of Humanity by the UNESCO, Granada boasts a Renaissance cathedral dating from the 16th century and many other architectural monuments of the first magnitude.\n\nGRANADA (Andalusia, Spain): - Surface: 12.638 KmÂ² - Altitude: 738 m. - Coordinates: 37Â°11â² N 3Â°36â² W- Population: 240522 hab. - Gentile: Granadinos\n\nPopulation\n\nGranada has a permanent population of some 243,000 inhabitants, but the reality is considerably higher, as this figure is augmented by some 60,000 university students during the academic year and by a considerable tourist population in summer. The population breakdown by ages is the following: 22% fewer than 20 years old, 16% over 65 years, leaving an active population of 62%. The breakdown between men and women is 46/53%, approximately.\n\nSpanish Office Hours are Different\n\nOfficial office hours in Spain are from 8:30 or 9:00 to 14:00 or 14:30. That is the best time to contact any Spanish companies or institutions. In the afternoon, most public services are closed, except emergency services. Private companies are normally open from 17:00 to 20:30 or 21:00 in the afternoon. During the summer, many companies work a \"jornada intensiva\" (continuous working day) from 8:00 am till 3:00 p.m. and take the afternoon off.\n\nAccess to Granada\n\nGranada has excellent accesses via train, plane and automobile. The airport is just 15 kilometers from Granada, close to the historic town of Santa Fe. Cars can be rented at the airport, and there is also a frequent bus service to the city. The train station is in the city center, making it particularly convenient. The A-92 dual carriageway takes motorists to Seville in two-and-a-half hours, to Malaga in an hour and a half, making Granada an excellent base for touring in Andalusia. The city's new four-lane \"circunvalaciÃ³n\" ring road greatly facilitates motor traffic in and around Granada, elegantly resolving access to both the Alhambra and the Sierra Nevada ski station. The new bus station on the city's northern edge provides bus service with the four corners of the Spanish geography.\n\nThe Environ in Granada\n\nGranada is situated at the foot of Sierra Nevada, the highest mountain range of the Iberian Peninsula. Besides providing a dramatic backdrop for the city, Sierra Nevada is home to southernmost Europe's ski station, and the scene of important international ski championships in recent years. The ski area is less than an hour drive from the city, via one of Europe's finest ski access roads.\n\nThe Mediterranean beach is also within easy striking distance of Granada, less than an hour by car, with resort and residential towns like Motril, AlmuÃ±ecar, SalobreÃ±a and many more. The traditional summering spot for local families, the Granada coast, with it's sub-tropical climate, and agriculture dedicated to exotic fruits, is increasingly attracting foreign visitors and residents.\n\nA prime choice for rural tourism in the province of Granada is the Sierra Alpujarra, actually Sierra Nevada's southern slopes which drop all the way to the Mediterranean. Tucked into the canyons and valleys of the region, there are more than 50 villages. Its bucolic air, its forests of oaks and chestnut trees and its welcoming villagers, not to mention their renowned rose wines, mountain hams and local handicrafts, make this region a powerful attraction for visitors both from the rest of Spain and abroad.\n\nPanoramic view of Granada from the Valley of the Valparaiso. Photo: EDILUX\n\nThe Granada Cultural Legacy\n\nThe city which today is Granada was founded by the Romans under the name of \"Illibris.\" It was the Moors, who invaded it in the eighth century A.D. and stayed on for seven centuries, who deemed the city \"Granada.\" Ferdinand and Isabella, Spain's revered \"Catholic Monarchs,\" conquered the Kingdom of Granada in 1492, culminating the Reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula for Christiandom.\n\nIt was during the siege of the city that Isabella of Castille conceded to Christopher Columbus the resources necessary to launch his expediciÃ³n to the West Indies. This long and colorful history has left numerous imprints on Granada in the form of palaces, churches and other noble buildings which proclaim the rich cultural heritage of the city. The monumental duo comprised by the Alhambra and the Generalife, fortress, medina and palace of the Nasrid monarchs, is world renowned both for its evocative architecture and for its privileged vantage point overlooking the city of Granada. Within the same complex lies the Renaissance Palace built there in the 16th century by the emperor Charles the Fifth, grandson of the conquering Catholic Monarchs.\n\nUne toile de fond si belle qu'elle en est presque kitsch\n\nDu cÃ´tÃ© opposÃ© de la vallÃ©e du fleuve Darro s'Ã©tend la quartier de l'AlbaicÃ­n, fascinante succession d'Ã©troites rues aux murs blancs, dont la moitiÃ© dissimulent les maisons traditionnelles, avec d'Ã©lÃ©gants jardins que les Grenadins appellent \"cÃ¡rmenes.\" L'AlbaicÃ­n abrite le Mirador de San NicolÃ¡s, la fameuse place oÃ¹ les visiteurs bÃ©nÃ©ficient d'une des vues les plus renommÃ©es au monde, celle de l'Alhambra et du Generalife, avec la Sierra Nevada enneigÃ©e, offrant une toile de fond si belle qu'elle en est presque kitsch.\n\nProche de l'AlbaicÃ­n, quelque peu en amont du fleuve Darro mais tojours avec une vue majestueuse de l'Alhambra : le Sacromonte, avec sa sainte abbaye et ses traditionnelles grottes-logis gitans (dont la plupart sont dÃ©sormais occupÃ©s par des rÃ©sidents Ã©trangers avisÃ©s). C'est lÃ que les \"zambras\", spectacles flamenco de Grenade, ont traditionnellement Ã©tÃ© mis en scÃ¨ne au milieu de dÃ©cors Ã©laborÃ©s dans des caves, et ici Ã©galement que la mairie de Grenade a rÃ©cemment installÃ© le Centro Flamenco de Estudios EscÃ©nicos. Le nouveau centre d'Ã©tudes flamenco est dirigÃ© par un danseur de flamenco, Mario Maya, qui y dÃ©buta sa carriÃ¨re dans les zambras de Sacromonte Ã neuf ans.\n\nA Backdrop So Beautiful It's Almost Unreal\n\nOn the opposite side of the valley of the River Darro lies the Albaicin quarter, a fascinating collection of narrow white-walled streets which half hide the traditional town houses with gracious gardens which the Granadinos call \"cÃ¡rmenes.\" Here in the AlbaicÃ­n is located the Mirador de San NicolÃ¡s (San Nicolas Balcony), the famous plaza where visitors are feted with one of the most renowned views in the world, that of the Alhambra and Generalife, with the snowy Sierra Nevada providing a backdrop so beautiful it's almost unreal.\n\nAdjacent to the AlbaicÃ­n, just a bit farther up the River Darro but still with a commanding view of the Alhambra, is Sacromonte, with its hallowed abbey and traditional Gypsy-cave residences (most of which are now occupied by astute foreign residents). It is here that Granada's \"zambra\" flamenco shows have traditionally been staged in elaborate cave settings, and it is here that the Granada town hall has recently installed the Centro Flamenco de Estudios EscÃ©nicos (Stage Flamenco Studies Centre). The new center is under the direction of flamenco dancer, Mario Maya, who initiated his distinguished career here in the zambras of Sacromonte at the age of nine.\n\nGranada's Illustrious Resting Places\n\nGranada also offers visitors a Renaissance cathedral considered the first of its kind in Spain. Adjacent to the cathedral is the Royal Chapel (Capilla Real), commissioned by Ferdinand and Isabella as their last resting place. (Their first resting place was a tiny chapel on the Alhambra hill which is today subsumed by a hotel, the Parador de Turismo de Granada.) The city is also blessed with a score of historic churches built by the Christians after the Reconquest in a unique style which incorporated Moorish architectural themes and came to be known as \"mudÃ©jar.\"\n\nAnother obligatory stop on anyone's discerning Granada itinerary is the Casa-Museo Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca in the Huerta de San Vicente, located in the municipal park dedicated to Granada's best-known and best-loved poet. The intimate little museum occupies the house and gardens where Lorca spent his summers as a child.\n\nBesides this opulent monumental legacy, Granada offers a wide gamut of contemporary cultural attractions, starting with the city's annual International Festival of Music and Dance, with concerts and recitals staged in the Alhambra, the Palace of Charles the Fifth and the gardens of the Generalife. Other annual festival events in Granada are devoted to jazz, theater, and the tango. Add to this the stable offerings of Granada's museums, art galleries, public exhibition halls, theaters and auditoria and you have one of Europe's most evocative and best endowed destinations for cultural tourism.\n\nA Granada Chronology"
