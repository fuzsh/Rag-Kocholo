        "text": "On Sunday (Dec. 11), Ricardo Arjona ended his tour Blanco y Negro: Volver amid persistent back problems and an imminent surgery.\n\nAfter 159 concerts, the last of them in Santiago de Chile, the 59-year-old Guatemalan artist published on social media an extensive reflection in which he said goodbye to the stage, but refrained from explicitly labeling it as a “retirement.”\n\n“Thank you for making the impossible so easy. I thought I wasn’t up for taking a step yesterday afternoon and ended up doing a marathon on the longest makeshift catwalk of my life. Almost like my career was from the beginning. Today will be the last concert of BLANCO Y NEGRO,” he wrote in Spanish on Instagram. “To all the cities that this tour of 159 concerts touched, my eternal thanks. To the doctors who put me on my feet to be able to finish this trip postponing an imminent surgery, thank you very much.”\n\nAccording to Billboard Boxscore, as of mid-2023 Arjona’s tours had grossed $154.6 million and sold two million tickets, placing him at No. 10 on Billboard’s list of top-grossing Latin artists tours of all time. The renowned artist is celebrated for his extensive 30-year career catalog of Latin pop ballads. He has placed 36 songs on the Hot Latin Songs chart, including five No. 1s, such as “Desnuda,” “Cuando,” and “El Problema.”\n\nArjona revealed undergoing “six spinal infiltrations” in the past two months to sustain his ability to stand during concerts and postpone surgery. He continued in the statement: “I will have to disappear to invent a motive that is greater than this one. If I don’t find it, I’d rather not come back. Life and people have been immensely generous to this Guatemalan from the barrio, a public school teacher, who by playing the guitar, adding a few words and trying a melody, achieved a miracle he never suspected.”\n\nHe continued, “I don’t agree with the industry. I’m too down-to-earth for this trip to the stars. They turned the bohemian and irresponsible boy into a defensive and isolated guy by dint of all the sticks I carried when I was starting out. I used up all my phoniness in my early career to survive in this smoky world, and after that, I only smiled at those I liked. I still think smiling unwillingly is bad for your health and there is so much of it around.”\n\n“My family and friends are my guard and my happiness. I don’t lack anything, in fact, I have so many things to spare. To you who made the effort to make line, budget, or any other inconveniences to attend one of my concerts, my sincere thanks,” Arjona concluded.\n\nThe “Porque Es Tan Cruel el Amor” singer kicked off his Blanco y Negro tour last year, which included stops in Puerto Rico, Mexico, Guatemala, the U.S., with a show at Madison Square Garden, and more. The tour was centered around his albums Blanco (2020) and Negro (2021)."
