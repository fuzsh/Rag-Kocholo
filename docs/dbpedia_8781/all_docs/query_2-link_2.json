        "text": "This dissertation explores the relationship between intellectual networks, royal patronage and developments in political thought in late medieval Islamic Spain and North Africa. It proposes a new reading of the history of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada (635/1238–897/1492) that examines these broader issues by closely studying the life and works of Lisān al-Dīn Muḥammad b. al-Khaṭīb (713/1313–776/1374), the most prominent Spanish Muslim historian, chancellor and philosopher during the 8th/14th century, situating this figure within a larger network of scholars, statesmen and functionaries in the late medieval Islamic West. This dissertation illustrates the manner in which the crisis and transformation that characterized the territorial fragmentation of Islamic Spain and North Africa contributed to the rise of a distinct class of scholar-officials who reshaped the intellectual and political culture of the Western Mediterranean. It argues that the gradual concentration of executive political authority in the hands of scholar-officials, such as Ibn al-Khaṭīb, was part of the process of the consolidation of royal power at the expense of the nobility during the late Middle Ages. For their part, these scholar-officials composed works across a variety of genres that sought to legitimate and rationalize the centralization of royal authority. To examine this phenomenon, this dissertation draws upon a corpus of Arabic, Castilian and Aragonese manuscripts, as well as coinage and epigraphy. It investigates the lives of those individuals who existed in close proximity to royal power during the late medieval period in order to explore how their own experiences and ideas fashioned discourses about sovereignty, governmentality and the craft of history during the 14th century. The rise of a distinct class of scholar-officials, whose members included Christians, Muslims and Jews working for different (often competing) dynasties, was underpinned by similar networks of patronage, intellectual interests and a shared geography. These highly-educated individuals rose to prominence as chancellors, treasurers, and councilors within the royal courts in Iberia and were responsible for producing a multitude of works, while patronizing pieces of art and architecture that embodied their particular worldview. Lisān al-Dīn b. al-Khaṭīb provides us with an illustrative example of this class of individuals during the 8th/14th century. This figure followed in the footsteps of leading Spanish Muslim scholar-officials such as Abū Bakr b. al-Khaṭṭāb, Ibn ‘Amīra, Ibn Sa‘īd and Ibn al-Abbār, individuals who had exercised significant administrative and political authority while also being deeply involved in various intellectual and literary pursuits during the 7th/13th century. Ibn al-Khaṭīb authored over 50 works, including historical chronicles, epistolography, biographical dictionaries, poetry, medical texts, and political treatises, throughout his career. This dissertation illustrates his role at the intersection of intellectual and political developments and demonstrates how his literary production was closely intertwined with his function as a statesman. It provides the first comprehensive study in English of Ibn al-Khaṭīb’s life, from his birth into a minor family in the small town of Loja in 713/1313 to his rise as a physician and scribe in the Nasrid court, his transformation from a client and servant of the Nasrid dynasty into an itinerant scholar-official who sought to establish his own individual power and influence across the Islamic West, to his controversial assassination in Fez in 776/1374. It looks particularly closely at the letters that he exchanged with his broader network of scholars, nobles, functionaries and kings across the Mediterranean world to think about the question of loyalty, ties of obligation and individual strategies of survival in the Islamic West during this period. https://search-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/docview/2202894085?accountid=14657\n\nThe history that emerges from the Reconquista is something of a marvel when one considers the significance of these crusades and their impact on the peoples of the Iberian Peninsula. Taking into consideration the size of the Iberian Peninsula, as a region, the entanglement of these two similar, but still different religious cultures, shows how complex a scenario of holy war really was. While the thought of holy war, be it a crusade or a jihād, shifts one’s thoughts to the Near East, in particular the Holy Land, the scale and significance of the 800 year-long reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula must not be overlooked. The mixed culture that developed in Iberia after the Islamic conquests of the early 8th century are a unique case in the medieval European sphere of influence. No other mainland European region, with perhaps the acceptation of the island of Sicily, has gone through such a radical cultural change, Christian-to-Islamic-to-Christian, in such a relatively short period of time. Therefore, the rise and fall of al-Andalus as a region of mixed Christian and Islamic culture is an important scenario when one considers the geographical position of Iberia with the rest of Christian Europe. With this in mind, this dissertation attempts to tackle two main goals, one on a region-wide level and the other on a more local level. The first goal is to understand and highlight how treaties between the major political players of the Reconquista affected the regions of Valencia and Granada on a large region-wide scale. Further, this section of the study takes into consideration how the eventual implementation of these various treaties, which ranged throughout the 800 years of the Reconquista, affected the many religious groups of both Valencia and Granada. This importantly notes any changes to both regions economies and takes into consideration any resulting migrations away from these regions. The second goal, takes the region-wide outcomes and analyses these factors on a smaller local scale. This is achieved by looking at the archaeology, architecture, population movements within the local scenario and, most importantly, the Christianization process that took shape in these regions after the various Christian conquests by the northern Iberian kingdoms from the late 10th and 11th centuries till the fall of Granada in 1492. However, these two goals could not be achieved without first tackling the standard terminology used in such a study, and secondly, an in-depth historical background of the major political players that played a role in the history of the Reconquista. Therefore, Chapter 1 of this dissertation highlights the necessary terminology for this type of research, such as the communities referred to as the Mudejars and the Dhimmi. While Chapter 2 gives an in-detail historical analysis of the Kingdoms of Aragon, Catalonia, Castile-León, the Umayyad, Almoravids and Almohads Caliphates, a general overview of the taifas and an in-depth historical analysis of Granada and Valencia. This historical overview ranges from their founding during the Roman period to the end of their respective conquests during the 12th and 15th centuries. From Chapter 3 onwards, the focus then shifts to the factors mentioned above in Valencia and Granada, with Chapter 3 tackling the treaties, alliances and warfare on the regional level and Chapter 4 tackling these outcomes on the local level. This is done through the use of the surviving archaeology on the rural and urban landscapes, while also considering the material culture from a historian’s perspective in reference to the historical literature. The eventual outcomes are then considered and compared, in relation to Valencia and Granada, within Chapter 5. Therefore, this dissertation will tackle the cultural, religious, economic and warfare factors of the Reconquista by comparing and contrasting the regions and cities of Valencia and Granada. Importantly, these main factors will be viewed on both the region-wide level and on the local level, which is further sub-divided into the rural and urban landscapes.\n\nAs part of my undergraduate degree at the University of Malta I was required to write a dissertation. Being passionate about the medieval period and crusading I wanted to work on these principles. My Supervisor, Mr Charles Dalli, suggested working on a comparative study of two major cities/regions in the Iberian Peninsula during the Reconquista and, thus, ‘The Two Kingdoms of the Reconquista’ was born in the summer of 2021. After extensive secondary research of works by authors, such as, R. Burns and J. Hillgarth, Valencia and Granada were chosen as candidates. Granada was the perfect candidate for this kind of study, for, among other reasons, that it was the last Muslim kingdom in Iberia. This fact gave a perfect starting point for the cultural shift from Islamic to Christian culture to take place in a relatively short period of time (1238-1492). However, why choose Valencia over other regions, such as Toledo, Seville and Cordoba? The crusade against Valencia had the largest effect on the future expansion of the Aragonese Empire, and after its capture, the Christianisation process took time to take hold over the Islamic presence there, both in the regional and urban contexts. Therefore, Valencia was the perfect candidate to undertake a comparative study against Granada, which went through the process much faster and affected the future expansion of Castile-León. Therefore, the dissertation covered these points, noting how certain treaties and alliances affected the way the Christian Kingdoms dealt with the Islamic Taifas after their capture, how they affected the rate at which the Christianisation process unfolded and how this Christianisation process can be seen through the archaeological record today. It is through these factors that the eventual cultural shift can be seen and how two regions, which are relatively close together, evolved so differently from each other.\n\nRodrigo Jiménez de Rada’s Historia Arabum was the first Latin chronicle to give an account of the history of al-Andalus from the fall of the Visigothic kingdom of Toledo in 711 to the fall of the Caliphate in 1031. It was the last book of the great Historia de rebus Hispaniae that the archbishop completed just before he died in 1247. In this work we present the first edition of a fourteenth-century Castilian translation of the Historia Arabum, the Estoria de los árabes. The edition has been realized using the only surviving complete copy of the work, contained in manuscripts 684 and 7801 of the Spanish National Library (BNE). The Castilian text has been compared to the original Latin text contained both in the 1999 edition by Fernández Valverde, and in the manuscript 1364 of the BNE —a fifteenth-century copy of the manuscript that supposedly was used by the original translator—. It has also been compared with the Castilian version of the Historia contained in Alfonso X’s Estoria de Espanna, and with other truncated translations that have also survived in manuscript. The edition is preceded by an introductory study in which Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada’s life and work is presented and analyzed. (This work has been carried out within the framework of the research project \"Islamophobia. Continuity and change in the anti-Muslim tradition: the case of Spain\" (HAR2015-73869-JIN), funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness)."
