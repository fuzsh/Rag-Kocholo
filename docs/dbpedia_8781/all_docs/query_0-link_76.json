The exhibition, for the first time in a retrospective of such proportions, focuses on the profound cultural imprint left by Islam on the multifaceted mirror of the peninsula, an imprint whose subtle influence was felt as far away as northern Europe and the New World, when, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Spain's mighty Christian empire embarked on its mis- sion of conquest. The only part of Europe with a heritage based in both Christianity and Islam, Spain, during its \"golden age/' occupied a position of absolute supremacy in a program of vast cultural expansion. The magnificent legacy of Spanish Islam has yet to be fully explored and appreciated. Many of those elements of Islam that were absorbed over the centuries were carried imperceptibly forward in the great age of Spanish influence. Others traveled to North Africa, to Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean, and to France and Italy with refugee communities of Jewish and Muslim artisans, whose expulsion from Spain began in 1492 and continued into the following century. Today, echoes of Islamic culture are still discernible in the life of Spain — in the language, in place names, culinary habits, music and dance, and in many trades and crafts. Yet hand in hand with this great cultural diffusion came the fragmentation of a unique artistic culture, and so it has remained, dispersed, for half a millennium. Now, with the unique collaboration of the Govern- ment of Spain and the Patronato de la Alhambra y Generalife, The Metropolitan Museum of Art has brought together more than one hundred objects from collections in the United States, Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Many are drawn from Spain's own museums, libraries, monasteries, and cathedral treasuries. These are seen first in the extraordinary setting of the Alhambra, the crowning Islamic architec- tural achievement in Spain, providing an opportunity for many treasures to return to their place of origin for the first time in five hundred years. The exhibition then travels to The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it will re-create for the American public a richly complex and relatively unknown civilization. Al-Andalus: The Art of Islamic Spain has been five years in the making. In 1987 the Ministerio de Cultura of Spain approached the Museum with a proposal to mount an exhibition of Islamic art in Madrid in 1992. The Metropolitan was already collaborating with Spain, in particular with the Prado, on a number of exhibitions: Zurbardn had just opened; Goya and the Age of Enlightenment was under way; and Velazquez was in its earliest stages of discussion. The Islamic holdings of the Metropolitan Museum rank among the finest in the world, and the idea of sharing them with Spain on the occasion of the quincentennial seemed part of a natural progression. Negotiations were entrusted to Dr. Mahrukh Tarapor, then Special Assistant to the Director for Exhibitions. It was her idea to focus the exhibition on Spain's Islamic heritage and to mount it at the Alhambra; over the next two years this creative initiative was enthusiastically sup- ported and advanced by the Government of Spain. The Junta de Andaluci'a, in an act of remarkable generosity, sanctioned the participation of the Alhambra in the project, and in October 1990 a Protocol Agreement was signed in Granada confirming that the Alhambra itself would house an exhibition of masterpieces created in Spain during the period of Islamic presence. The signa- tories were the Junta de Andaluci'a, the Ministerio de Cultura, the Ayuntamiento de Granada, the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art. We wish to extend singular thanks and profound appreciation to the following individuals: in the Junta de Andalucia, Manuel Chaves Gonzalez, Presidente; Juan Manuel Suarez Japon, Consejero de Cultura y Medio Ambiente; and Jose Guirao Cabrera, Director General de Bienes Culturales; in the Ministerio de Cultura, Jordi Sole Tura, Ministro de Cultura de Esparia; and Jose Maria Luzon Nogue, Director General de Bellas Artes y Archivos. We also wish to acknowledge the early encouragement and support of former ministers Javier Solana Madariaga, and Jorge Semprun Maura, as well as former Subsecretario Miguel Satrustegui Gil-Delgado. We are grateful as well to the Ayuntamiento de Granada, and in particular to the Patronato de la Alhambra y Generalife, through whose Comision Tecnica the project moved efficiently forward. An exhibition is-, ultimately, only as good as the generosity of its lenders, and here we are indebted to almost seventy institutions, whose names we list, with gratitude, on pages xvi-xvii. To colleagues out- side Spain we would like to add a special word of thanks for their enthusiastic and ready collaboration in this unusual endeavor. In particular we wish to acknowl- edge the Kingdom of Morocco, which has sent many of its finest treasures to the exhibition. The Metropolitan Museum is mindful of this privilege and extends special thanks to Driss Basri, Ministre de lTnterieur, and Mohamed Benaissa, Ministre de la Culture, for their ready endorsement of this venture. An exhibition of such magnitude would not have been possible without the financial support of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, whose generous assistance has further ensured that the exhibition be seen in both Spain and the United States. We would like to acknowledge, specifically, its President and Chairman of the Board, Emilio Ybarra y Churruca. We would also like to thank Iberia Airlines of Spain, in particular Miguel Aguilo, President and Chairman of the Board, for providing transportation assistance for the exhibition. Additional support for the exhibition in New York has been provided by the National Endowment for the Humani- ties, a federal agency, and by an indemnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities. To Placido Arango, I want to .extend my appreciation for his help on many levels, with this venture as with our many other projects in Spain. Indeed, this institu- tion is greatly in his debt and is most proud to have his services as a trustee. I salute and thank my colleague and fellow director Mateo Revilla Uceda for his unwavering commitment to a difficult and complicated project; for sharing with us that most precious loan of all, the Alhambra, to the direction of which he brings such energy and vision; for his gracious hospitality, over a period of nearly three years, to various members of the Metropolitan's exhibition team; and, above all, for the generosity and determination that have made this collaboration possible. Finally, I would like to conclude with an envoi in profound gratitude and in praise of Mahrukh Tarapor, Assistant Director, the architect of this project, for which she has been virtually the mind and the heart. This is a characterization she will no doubt protest. But so long as those whose invaluable roles acknowledged above do not begrudge her this honor — as I feel sure they will not — I would like it to stand. This is because mind and heart best describe, on the one hand, the seriousness and scholarship, and, on the other, the inspiration and encouragement with which she has infused this im- mensely complex transatlantic, even global, project. Philippe de Montebello Director The Metropolitan Museum of Art VIII {Acknowledgments In the five years since this exhibition was first conceived, a vast network of collaborative effort has slowly estab- lished itself on both sides of the Atlantic, expanding inevitably into a network of mutual indebtedness. My own foremost debt is to Philippe de Montebello and Mateo Revilla Uceda, without whose vision and cour- age this landmark exhibition could not have taken place. To each I can offer only the most inadequate expression of thanks, but surely it is rare indeed to have the opportunity to work so closely and with so much pleasure with two equally remarkable and dedicated directors. In what must have sometimes seemed an act of blind faith, one director committed the abundant resources of his institution to the fulfillment of an idea, while the other pledged the monument itself. As a result, three extraordinary objectives have been achieved: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, for the very first time, has initiated and organized an interna- tional loan exhibition in another country; the Alham- bra, for the first time in five centuries, has gathered within its great halls masterworks from the rich artistic period of which this monument itself is the last poi- gnant testimony; and the relatively undocumented art traditions of Islamic Spain have been examined in the first major exhibition devoted to the subject. Al-Andalus: The Art of Islamic Spain is the largest and most comprehensive exhibition ever held of Span- ish Islamic art during its period of highest accomplish- ment, the eighth through the fifteenth century. Nearly seventy institutions from fifteen countries agreed to participate in this venture by graciously lending works in their collections. Two deserve mention for their special generosity: the Museo Arqueologico Nacional, Madrid, and the Museo Arqueologico Provincial de Cordoba. Countless scholars, museum authorities, gov- ernment officials, collectors, churchmen, translators, and friends have lent their time, support, and profes- sional skills to the implementation of this project and to the creation of its ambitious catalogue. Some were especially instrumental in searching out elusive loans, and others, in particular Juan Zozaya Stabel-Hansen, Subdirector, Museo Arqueologico Nacional, Madrid, offered constant and generous guidance. In Paris, Ute Collinet, Secretaire General, Reunion des musees nationaux, and Jean-Claude Meyer provided valuable assistance at critical moments, and in Berlin, Prof. Dr. Michael Meinecke, Director, Museum fur Islamische Kunst, was a most helpful colleague. We are particu- larly indebted as well to Lord Palumbo, Chairman, Arts Council of Great Britain, Jose Angel Sanchez Asiain, Presidente, Real Patronato del Museo del Prado, Ma- drid; and Jacques Soulillou, Director of Visual Arts, French Embassy, New York; and to Adi B.K. Dubash and Mrs. Kulsum Dubash, Honorary Consul, Consulate of Spain, Bombay. We also wish to thank Jonathan M. Bloom, Manuel Casamar Perez, James Dickie, Christian Ewert, Thomas F. Click, Francisco Godoy Delgado, Oleg Grabar, Purification Marinetto Sanchez, Cristina Partearroyo Lacaba, Albert Rivera, Guillermo Rossello Bordoy, D. Fairchild Ruggles, and Antonio Vallejo Triano. Both the exhibition and the catalogue have benefited immensely from their learned and scholarly contributions. Others to whom we extend our thanks are Charles Gifford, Julian Hernandez Miranda, Nina von Krogh, Margarita Mejia, and Marilyn Orozco. The collaboration of more than twenty scholars both from within and outside Spain has been spearheaded by Dr. Jerrilynn D. Dodds, Associate Professor of Art and Architecture, City College, City University of New York, and Special Consultant for this project, whose guiding intelligence has shaped and molded the exhibi- tion into a coherent whole. Working closely with Daniel Walker, Curator in Charge, Department of Islamic Art, Dr. Dodds selected the objects for the exhibition in consultation with her Spanish colleagues and edited the catalogue with the same intellectual rigor and generosity of spirit that have characterized every aspect of her involvement with this enterprise. We single her out, gratefully, for special thanks. Converting, even for the brief period of the exhibi- tion, the halls of the open and windswept Alhambra into a museum was in many ways the most critical and daunting aspect of the entire undertaking. It was recog- nized from the outset that the Alhambra's extraordinary beauty, depending as it does for its effect on sinuous interweavings of light and shade, on subtle balances of interior and exterior space, on the playful and reposeful uses of water, and on a brilliantly kaleidoscopic decora- tive scheme, could not be compromised in any way. Nor could any original surface of the monument be touched or interfered with for purposes of installation. The technical teams of the Metropolitan Museum and the Alhambra, in consultation with the Comision Tec- nica del Patronato de la Alhambra, were therefore called upon to exercise every possible ingenuity in the solution of such routine museum concerns as conserva- tion and climate control, lighting design, and security. I would like to record my personal thanks to those listed below for their cooperative effort and for the patience, persistence, and good humor with which they cleared a seemingly endless path of obstacles, allowing the exhibition to progress steadily to its final grand design. They are: from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Linda M. Sylling, Assistant Manager, Operations; Franz J. Schmidt, Manager, Buildings; Jack Soultanian, Jr., Conservator, Objects Conservation; David Harvey, Senior Exhibition Designer; Zack Zanolli, Lighting Designer; and John Barelli, Security Manager; from the Alhambra, Luciano Rodrigo Marhuenda, Jefe del Servicio de Conservacion; Carmen Navarrete Aguilera, Jefe del Departamento de Restauracion; Jesus Ber- mudez Lopez, Jefe del Departamento de Investigacion y Difusion Cultural; Jorge Calancha de Passos, Jefe del Departamento de Obras; Julian Casares Garrido, Secretario General; Rocio Linan Corrochano, Jefe del Negociado de Visitas; Genoveva Fernandez Sanchez, Secretariade Direction; and Antonio Fernandez Ortega, Jefe del Departemento Didactico. Til Hahn, of Glasbau Hahn, Frankfurt, shared his expertise in the first exploratory stages of the exhibi- tion and patiently worked with us to design and create display cases that served the Alhambra's particular environmental needs. Other Metropolitan Museum colleagues have made valuable contributions: William D. Wixom, Chairman, Department of Medieval Art and The Cloisters; Stuart W. Pyhrr, Curator, Department of Arms and Armor; William S. Lieberman, Jacques and Natasha Gelman Chairman, Department of Twentieth Century Art; Emily Kernan Rafferty, Vice President, Development and Membership; Daniel Berger, Manager, Mezzanine Gallery and Corporate Sales; Sharon H. Cott, Assistant Secretary and Associate Counsel; Kathrin Colburn, Assistant Conservator, Textile Conservation, The Clois- ters; Herbert M. Moskowitz, Registrar; and Barbara Weiss, Graphic Designer. Richard R. Morsches, Vice President, Operations; Jeffrey L. Daly, Chief Designer; Nobuko Kajitani, Conservator, Textile Conservation; and James H. Frantz, Conservator in Charge, Objects Conservation, have endured, with abundant good will, frequently inconvenient absences of the staffs of their departments. We are grateful also to Laurence B. Kanter, Curator, Robert Lehman Collection, and to the Robert Lehman Foundation for making the Robert Lehman Wing galleries available for the exhibition in New York. Above all, I am indebted to Martha Deese, Senior Assistant for Exhibitions, who devoted her formidable organizational talents to handling all corre- spondence with lenders and to coordinating a wide variety of curatorial, administrative, and editorial re- sponsibilities. It is not too much to say that her high degree of professionalism and unfailing good cheer have ensured the smooth and efficient advance of the exhibition from beginning to end. Like the exhibition, the catalogue too is an interna- tional endeavor. It is our hope that it will be not only a record of the exhibition but also serve as a pioneering reference for the future study of the art of Islamic Spain. Its overall supervision and the shaping of its concept and design were the responsibility of John P. O'Neill, Editor in Chief and General Manager of Publi- cations. The catalogue was edited by Carol Fuerstein, Senior Editor, whose skill and devotion were essential to its integrity and to its timely completion. Gwen Roginsky, Production Manager, corrected the color proofs and coordinated all phases of production. Bruce Campbell contributed the elegant and functional de- sign. Susan Chun, Production Associate, and Rachel Moskowitz Ruben, Research Assistant, aided the proj- ect in their separate capacities. Ediciones El Viso, Madrid, prepared the Spanish- language edition of the catalogue under the direction of its publisher, Santiago Saavedra, whose close collabora- tion on both the conception and development of the catalogue proved immensely valuable at every stage. His critical assistance has also extended to the exhibi- tion, and I would like to thank him for being always the best of colleagues, as well as, to all of us who worked with him, a special friend. In his office, Lola Gomez de Aranda handled all details pertaining to the catalogue with skilled professionalism and inexhaustible energy, We also wish to acknowledge the outstanding object photography of Bruce M. White of the Metropolitan Museum, Sheldan Collins of New York, and Javier Oronoz of Madrid. Architectural and site photography in Spain was executed by the renowned photographer Raghubir Singh. Among the most significant economic and cultural connections of al-Andalus were its ties with Morocco, its southern neighbor. For the Metropolitan Museum, one of the most gratifying experiences associated with the exhibition has been the discovery and exploration of Morocco's art treasures. We have been the recipi- ents, in Rabat, Fez, and Marrakesh, of the richest traditions of Islamic hospitality, for which we offer our heartfelt thanks to officials of the Kingdom of Mo- rocco: in Rabat, Driss Toulali, Directeur General des Collectivites Locales, Ministere de llnterieur; Moham- med Melehi, Directeur des Arts, Ministere de la Culture; Abdelaziz Touri, Directeur du Patrimoine, Ministere de la Culture; and Mohamed Larbi El Khattabi, Conserva- teur, Bibliotheque Royale; in Fez, Mhamed Dryef, Wali de la Province de Fes; Abdellatif El-Hajjami, Directeur General, Agence pour la Dedensification et la Rehabili- tation de la Medina de Fes, Ministere de lTnterieur; Hnia Chikhaoui, Charge de la Conservation, Musee du Batha; and Lhaj Moussa Aouni, Archeologue et Colla- borateur de l'Ader Fes; in Marrakesh, Ahmed Ben Yamani, Inspecteur des Monuments Historiques, Min- istere de la Culture; Hassan Belarabi, Conservateur, Musee Dar Si Said; Hassan Sabah, Conservateur, Biblio- theque Ben Youssouf; and Zaki Boudelfa, Caid du Cabinet, Wali de Marrakech. Our most profound thanks we have reserved for those government officials and museum colleagues in Spain without whom this exhibition could not have been realized. More than fifty percent of the exhibited works have been drawn from museums, private institu- tions, libraries, and ecclesiastical collections across the length and breadth of Spain. Officials in the Ministerio de Cultura, Spain, and the Junta de Andalucia, particu- larly, Jose Maria Luzon Nogue, Director General de Bellas Artes y Archivos, Ministerio de Cultura, and Jose Guirao Cabrera, Director General de Bienes Culturales, Junta de Andalucia, have provided invaluable advice and ready assistance at all stages, and to Philippe de Montebello's thanks I would like here to add my own appreciation of their many efforts on our behalf. Our communications with Spanish lenders have been facili- tated at every level by the efficient intervention of Javier Aiguabella of the Centro Nacional de Expo- siciones, Ministerio de Cultura, which is headed by Rosa Garcia Brage. The conservation of certain Spanish loans by the Instituto de Conservation y Restauracion de Bienes Culturales (I.C.R.B.C) has also been coordi- nated by Mr. Aiguabella. At I.C.R.B.C. we wish to thank Maria Paz Bolanos, Maria Isabel Herraiz, Maria Carmen Saldana y Paz Navarro (Materiales), and Socorro Mantilla de los Rios, Pilar Borrego y Camino Represa (Tejidos), as well as Dionisio Hernandez Gil, Director, and Jose Maria Losada, Subdirector de Bienes Muebles, for their expert assistance. We have valued especially the lively and informed interest that both Antonio Lopez Fernandez and Carlos Parames Monte- negro of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya have extended to this project. Emilio Cassinello Auban, Comisario, EXPO '92, Seville, has also been an intellectually stimulating and generous colleague. Production of the video documentary that accom- panies the exhibition has involved close collaboration with our colleagues in Madrid at Sogetel, and we acknowledge especially the efforts of Miguel Satrustegui Gil-Delgado, Project Manager; Miguel Salvat, Execu- tive Producer; and Pablo Romero, Script Cowriter and Coordinator. In conclusion, I would like to express my profound appreciation to four special friends whose encourage- ment and guidance contributed in no small measure to the success of Al-Andalus. Simeon Saxe-Coburg has enriched the exhibition by providing indispensable assistance in securing several important loans. Leopoldo Rodes has offered, unstintingly, both hospitality and efficient help. The exhibition has benefited enormously from the continued enthusiasm of Juan Cruz, and through him I have learned many valuable lessons about Spain's multifaceted culture. Above all, Placido Arango has offered unwavering support and good coun- sel. For his friendship, and for his tireless efforts on behalf of the exhibition, I shall be lastingly grateful. Mahrukh Tarapor Assistant Director The Metropolitan Museum of Art Sponsor s Statement In Washington Irving's sketches in The Alhambra, written in 1829, we read: 'To the traveller imbued with a sense of the historical and poetical, so inseparably intertwined in the annals of romantic Spain, the Al- hambra is as much an object of devotion as is the Caaba to all true Moslems.\" Many years earlier, in 1431, King John II of Castile, too, was fascinated by the beauty of the site, as is recounted, somewhere between history and legend, in El Romance de Abendmar: \"What castles are those shining there? How tall they are upon the hill !\" \"Alhambra, they call one, my lord, the other is the Muslim temple. \" This tall and shining palace is a unique setting for an exceptional selection of objects that represent almost eight centuries of Spanish history, a show that un- doubtedly will be one of the major events of the 1992 quincentennial celebrations and one that for many reasons is symbolic for all Spaniards. The Banco Bilbao Vizcaya takes very special satis- faction in participating in this project in conjunction with The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and various government and civic bodies in Spain: the Ministerio de Cultura, the Junta de Andalucia, the Ayuntamiento de Granada, and the Patronato de la Alhambra y Generalife. This exhibition is palpable proof of the efficacy of cooperation among the public sector, not-for-profit organizations, and private enter- prise, all at the service of the noble cause of culture. Emilio Ybarra y Churruca Presidente Consejo de Administracidn, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya XII Official Statements The end of the last Islamic reign on the Iberian Peninsula and the discovery of America, both of which occurred in 1492, are historical landmarks that to a large degree imprint and distinguish the modern age in Spain and in Europe in general. Now, on the occasion of the quincentenary, we should recall that Andalusia was the setting for both events. Today a meticulously selected exhibition of Islamic art evokes in Granada and in New York nearly eight centuries of Hispano-Islamic civilization and its rich contributions to the Spanish cultural heritage. Certainly this multiple legacy is evidenced in our language, customs, and habits, and helped to shape the structure of our territory. However, this legacy reached one of its most elevated peaks in artistic expression, in the numerous objects and decorative details that filled the halls and embellished the galleries of the handsome Nasrid palaces. These same riches serve now, five centuries later, to commemorate the creativity of the consummate artisans who produced them. Once again reunited in their original surroundings, they suddenly seem to revitalize the spell and fascination of the Alhambra. The organization of a cultural event of the propor- tions of this exhibition demands the combined efforts and will of many institutions and individuals. The successful realization of this project has been made possible by the impetus provided by the Junta de Andalucia, the Ministerio de Cultura, and the Ayunta- miento de Granada, the invaluable participation of New York's renowned Metropolitan Museum of Art, the beneficent support of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and Iberia Airlines of Spain, and the generosity of the many institutions that lent extremely valuable pieces. Manuel Chaves Gonzalez Presidente junta de Andalucia y del Patronato de la Alhambra y Generalise The arts of al-Andalus represent one of the most brilliant chapters in the history of centuries of super- imposed cultures on the Iberian Peninsula. Hispano- Islamic master builders, craftsmen, and artists of every kind created works and styles we still see reflected in many areas of traditional Spanish popular art. Islamic medieval arts are even today among the most signifi- cant components of Spanish culture. The current exhi- bition at the Alhambra and at The Metropolitan Museum of Art is, therefore, intimately tied to one of the quintessentiakfacets of Andalusian identity. The pieces displayed at the Alhambra form a unity with the edifice in which they are housed, a unity impossible to realize in traditional exhibitions. Archi- tecture embraces an assiduously selected group of pieces to form a harmonious and unique whole. Certain objects that were removed some five hundred years ago have been returned to the Alhambra; the beauty and uniqueness of others have been enhanced by the splen- did setting. The labor demanded by this undertaking has been exhaustive and difficult; thanks to the substantial efforts of a large group of specialists and the generous collaboration of the numerous museums involved in marking the historic date this exhibition celebrates, we have the good fortune to view the artistic grandeur of al-Andalus in the Alhambra of Granada, as well as at The Metropolitan Museum in New York. To all those concerned we offer our congratulations and our gratitude. Jordi Sole Tura Ministro de Cultura de Espana Coordination and dialogue between public institutions and private enterprise generates meaningful projects from which the public benefits. We now find ourselves on the threshold of just such an undertaking, the exhibition Al-Andalus: The Art of Islamic Spain, or- ganized by The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York with the collaboration of the Patronato de la Alhambra y Generalife under the joint patronage of the Junta de Andaluda, the Ministerio de Cultura, and the Ayuntamiento de Granada, with the additional spon- sorship of the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. The exhibition, housed in the Nasrid palaces of the Alhambra before it travels to the Metropolitan Museum, brings together an array of objects of inestimable value — value that is even more emotional than material. In recent times these objects have been scattered about the globe, but now they will be on view for nearly three months in a space with universal meaning. The symbiosis of the Alhambra and the city will be reinforced this year by the display of more than one hundred objects from the Hispano-Islamic epoch, the legacy of a civilization that cultivated, in addition to knowledge, arts that are firmly entrenched in Granada even now, as we approach the dawn of the twenty-first century: agriculture, the industrial arts, and commerce. The city responds to the wisdom of the selection of the Alhambra to house the exhibition and recognizes that this is the greatest possible homage to our ancestors, whose sensibilities, revealed in the beauty of their Nasrid palaces, we appreciate and admire. Visitors in general and we citizens of Granada in particular have the opportunity to relive a period of history in its most natural ambience. A walk through the Alhambra during the course of this exhibition offers us a direct bridge to a past that anticipated the future: Granada as a city open to all cultures. With the presentation of Al-Andalus: The Art of Islamic Spain, the sense of the principal role Granada plays in our culture will be reevaluated; I trust, therefore, that the relationship among the institutions involved in this event and others taking place in the city will establish the foundation for future collaborations. I take this opportunity to express my hope — and that of all the citizens of Granada — that Al-Andalus: The Art of Islamic Spain will be a major event; indeed the Ayuntamiento and the city of Granada have labored for it with high expectations of success. Jesus Quero Molina Alcalde Granada . xiv Al-Andalus: The Art of Islamic Spain, which marks the quincentenary of the taking of Granada by the forces of Ferdinand and Isabella, captures our attention for two primary reasons. First, the exhibition's more than one hundred pieces from many different institu- tions offer a comprehensive image of Spanish-Islamic art through its several periods; second, because the objects displayed represent most of the typical tech- niques and materials of the art of al-Andalus (stone, ivory, ceramic, wood, metal, textiles) and a great diver- sity of function (ornamental, ritual, military), they demonstrate the wide range of creativity of Spanish- Islamic culture. A further attraction of the exhibition is the first setting in which it is presented, the Nasrid palaces of the Alhambra. Care has been taken to establish a dialogue be- tween objects and architectural space at the Alhambra, thereby enriching our appreciation of both. The works of art assume a special quality in relation to the sur- roundings of the palaces; the architecture, in turn, is enhanced by the presence of the works of art. Architec- ture and objects originated from shared aesthetic pre- sumptions and shared formal and technical principles: technical knowledge and manual skill, mastery of the medium and perfection of detail, decorative richness and a particular codification of imagination, and the unfailing presence of the arabesque and of script as distinctive and specific elements of the Muslim artistic sense, a presence that lends unity to all its plastic manifestations. Temporarily \"rescued' 7 from the museums in which they are located today, these works glow with a different light within the walls of the Alhambra. Simi- larly, we perceive the palaces, with arabesques, inscrip- tions, and remains of polychromy displayed on their walls, as objects as precious as those housed for a time within them. Our eye rests on an object and then on a fragment of architecture, and in the two we appreciate that formal unity to which we have already alluded. Thus, not only the intrinsic interest of the pieces displayed but also their setting contribute to our fascination with this exhibition conceived to commem- orate the enriching role Islamic culture played five centuries ago in Spain. It is not difficult to imagine the technical and practical difficulties inherent in organizing an event of this nature in the Alhambra. Those difficulties were overcome thanks to four years of constant communica- tion and interchange of ideas with the Assistant Director of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Dr. Mahrukh Tarapor, the enthusiastic participation of the staff of the Metropolitan and the Conjunto Monumental of Gra- nada, and the support of its Comision Tecnica. We want to express our appreciation for the bold vision of the Patronato de la Alhambra y Generalife and most espe- cially to the members of its Comision Permanente, His Excellency the Consejero de Cultura y Medio Ambiente, Juan Manuel Suarez Japon, our esteemed Alcalde of Granada, Jesus Quero Molina, the distinguished Direc- tor General de Bellas Artes, Jose Maria Luzon Nogue, and the distinguished Director General de Bienes Culturales of the Junta de Andalucia, Jose Guirao Cabrera; because of their valuable services we are able to offer this extraordinary exhibition.

Dodds and Daniel Walker Al-Andalus was, for over seven centuries, the occiden- tal frontier of Islam. Floating on the western edge of the Mediterranean like an island welded to Europe only by a jagged chain of peaks, it was geographically iso- lated from both Europe and North Africa, from the path- ways to Christian as well as to Islamic lands. Physical remoteness gave al-Andalus a privileged place in the histories and myths of Islam and medieval Christen- dom but also secluded it, separated it from either community. Thus, when the last Muslims were cast from the peninsula — when al-Andalus ceased to exist — it became a stepchild of history, receiving unsteady attention from both the Islamic world and the Euro- pean land it had once inhabited. The arts of al-Andalus were viewed as the brilliant and exotic vestiges of a moment severed and exorcized from the history of Europe and lost to the world of Islam. And though a small and valiant group of scholars maintained the serious study of those arts through this century, the Islamic artistic heritage has not received a fraction of the attention it merits, as if we still believed, with Washington Irving, that \"the Moslem empire in Spain was but a brilliant exotic that took no permanent root in the soil it embellished/' 1 The goal of this volume is to make a new place for the study of the art of Islamic Spain, to celebrate its value as part of an autonomous culture and also as a potent presence that had deep importance for Europe and the Muslim world. Toward this goal a group of interna- tional scholars has contributed a wide-ranging series of studies embracing the art, architecture, and cultural climate of al-Andalus, subjects approached in terms of a broad variety of methods. What we hope to offer here is a state of the question concerning the major achieve- ments of art and architecture of al-Andalus, a volume that can serve both as an introduction to the visual world of a nearly vanished culture and as a point of departure for future scholarly study. The arts of al-Andalus include the material culture of over seven hundred years of history, works that issue from diverse rules and traditions. The courtly arts are best known and preserved : They are the primary means by which the story of al-Andalus is told in this cata- logue. The various palatine cultures and their arts are potent reminders of the extended and changing charac- ter of Islamic hegemony in Spain; they divert us from Irving's mythic view of the \"Moor\" — the monolithic other in brief intense polarity with the Christian west. Indeed, the way these arts were viewed and the way they functioned in each of the rules that produced them bear witness to the cultural and ideological divergences of those rules, to the complexity of a multifaceted and protean Islamic period on the Iberian Peninsula. The Spanish Umayyad period produced brilliant courts that carefully established an image of al-Andalus as an ele- gant capital for both the east and the west. The Taifa monarchs, whose kingdoms were small and politically impotent, nevertheless perpetuated the most refined elements in the Umayyad princely image. The invasions of the two conservative Berber sects, the Almoravids, then the Almohads, brought renewed force and a conscious sense of conservatism and constraint to the courts of al-Andalus. And, finally, the Nasrids created an opulent court that, from its very birth, looked nostalgically at the glories of an Islamic rule that had already slipped from their hands. Since the overwhelming majority of surviving ob- jects from al-Andalus were made for courtly settings, this exhibition necessarily presents a picture that re- lates primarily to the aristocratic, exclusive sectors of the Islamic society of the peninsula. It is our belief that these objects can provide a passage not only to visual and tactile experiences of beauty and power but also to an understanding of how the Muslims of al-Andalus saw themselves; they allow us to understand the mean- ing of courtly patronage and display for the Islamic princes of the Iberian Peninsula and to see the search for identity hidden within the folds of each work of art. For these were more than opulent adornments intended to impress — though on one level they were certainly that; they were also the means by which the Muslim rulers of al-Andalus created a visual setting for themselves on the western frontier of Islam. This was true in particular of the Umayyads, whose arts mark the first great passage of the culture of al- Andalus. Under the Umayyad emirate and the ca- liphate that followed, a series of artistic relationships was established that would be mined and renewed during nearly the entire history of al-Andalus. The new Muslim rulers of the peninsula accepted the pre- existing vocabulary of Hispano-Roman and Visigothic architecture: Columns and Corinthian capitals, even horseshoe arches, were used as long as they could be transformed through plan, elevation, and decoration into a product that bore the recognizable stamp of their Islamic hegemony To this vocabulary were added evocations of Umayyad Syria when Damascus was the center of the caliphate, the capital of all Islam: details of plan, mosaics by artisans imported from the east, and imitations of fine marble revetment. And, finally, more recent developments from the eastern reaches of the Islamic world were reflected in the sudden spread to Spain from Iraq and Iran of fine stucco carving — translated into an original and local idiom. In religious building and decoration, each of these visual sources contributed to the development of ingenious and com- plex aniconic ornament that engaged the viewer in a contemplative rather than an empathetic relationship, which distinguishes Islamic religious arts from those of Christians. In secular courtly arts, decorative inscriptions, which are often stylized and may constitute the primary orna- mentation of a work, took on a significant role as a link between patronage and power. We see this in caliphal ceramics in which the phrase al-mulk, meaning the power or the dominion, is repeated and in the use — forbidden to all but the ruler — of strips with the caliph's name on tiraz, luxury textiles from royal workshops. Umayyad patrons did not demur from the representation of the figure, although its use was restricted. The figure is often integrated into an overall surface decoration of interlace and foliage so that it is poised ambiguously between formal device and bearer of meaning, much as the stylized inscriptions are stretched taut between ornament and writing. Ivory carving was developed to an extent unknown in most other parts of the Islamic world, and objects made of ivory bear scrutiny for their lively figural imagery. In examples such as the pyxis of al-Mughira and the Pamplona casket, figures are clear carriers of an iconography of authority and power. These ivories reveal that such figural expression may perhaps have been part of the privilege of princes — an idea that links the Umayyads of Spain to the Roman and Sasanian rulers of Syria and Iran, reminding us that Spanish caliphal art was profoundly affected by a memory of, and also a yearning for, a place at the heart of Islamic lands. The Taifa kingdoms were financially and militarily restricted in comparison with the Umayyads they succeeded, but that did not prohibit them from enjoy- ing both international contacts and a highly evolved local artistic production. Crafts that once centered almost uniquely around Cordoba now emerged in regional centers. Ivory carving and work in silver niello developed in Cuenca and Toledo, and widely dispersed courts produced architecture that with great wit and sophistication embroidered on the tradition of interlacing arches introduced by the Cordoban caliphate, as the Aljaferia in Saragossa demonstrates. These regional courts — where the making of culture was one of the few unrestrained activities — nurtured the idea of ruler as patron and continued to employ the iconography of authority created by the Umayyads. In such urbane courts poetry and science flourished in visual settings that were original and impertinent interpretations of the powerful memory of the elegant caliphate. The Almoravid invasions were a reaction to both the impotence and the indulgence of the Taifa kingdoms, and they thus brought about profound changes in the courtly arts of al-Andalus. Art and architecture were now drawn across the Strait of Gibraltar, as artisans from the peninsula worked in Marrakesh and Fez. Architecture took on a new conservatism in plan and a decorative austerity conveyed by stuccoed brick piers with cool, keel-arched arcades. When Cordoban wood- workers created the minbar for the Kutubiyya mosque in Marrakesh, they used decorative themes of geometric complexity that would become a hallmark of the arts of al-Andalus over the next four hundred years. Figural decoration, on the other hand, appeared somewhat less frequently and became rather more emblematic in thrs period, except in ceramics — in which it was firmly en- trenched in ongoing traditions that were independent of the court — and in luxury textiles. The textiles are especially significant, in particular the rich silks created in Almerfa that were covered with bold representations of heraldic animals — our first indication of the seduction of the ascetic Almoravids by the most opulent crafts of al-Andalus. For though they had vanquished the Taifa rulers under a banner of austerity, the Almoravids at some level had absorbed the idea that the patronage of costly arts was one of the signs of kingship. The Almohads attacked the issue of fundamentalism and the arts with new rigor: They whitewashed or destroyed Almoravid mosques and built their own with a new degree of decorative restraint. The wild mean- dering arches of the caliphal and Taifa periods are now reduced to a bit of schematized lacework enclosed in a rectangle in La Giralda of Seville: a swatch of pattern that distills the sensuous mannerism of the caliphal and Taifa periods to a controlled planar texture in the Almohad minaret. In their rejection of opulence and excess, the Almohads began by outlawing the textile factories of Almeria that had flourished in Almoravid times. Ultimately, however, they created a textile tradition of their own that in some cases continues Almoravid traditions and in others features inscrip- tions and abstract geometric designs — as epitomized in the banner of Las Navas de Tolosa — that take the place of Almoravid figural motifs. It is fitting that there should survive from the Almohad period both an extraordinary battle banner and certain bell lamps from the Qarawiyyin mosque in Fez, for all reflect the military character of the Almohad hegemony As Christian bells captured in battle and converted into mosque lamps, the bell lamps were victory symbols for the faith of Islam. Both the lamps and the banner under- line the extent to which the Almohads created an image for themselves in purposeful opposition to the Christian kingdoms of the north — as distinct from the rulers of the caliphate and Taifa kingdoms whose identity was rooted simultaneously in the peninsula and in Umayyad Syria. The Almoravid reaction against the indulgence of the Taifa courts manifested itself in a new emphasis on the art of the book in Islamic Spain, particularly with regard to the production of Qur^ans. The conservatism of the Almoravids, and of the Almohads as well, is reflected more in the emphasis on Qur^an production than in any visual austerity in the manuscripts them- selves, for the latter frequently bear elaborate and sump- tuous illumination. Not all examples were religious in nature, but there remains today only one illustrated literary manuscript, the Hadith Bayadwa Riyad, the sole survivor of what must have been a rich pictorial tradition. The tiny Nasrid kingdom of Granada, the last Islamic state on the Iberian Peninsula, knew little political and military power but, thanks to its long survival and active patrons, produced a remarkable number of extremely influential objects of the highest quality. The palaces of the Alhambra contain an ency- clopedia of Islamic ornament, from stucco carving to tile inlay to wooden ceilings, which together create an environment saturated with abstract decoration. The Nasrids' arts elaborated upon the traditions of the Almohads and Almoravids but were unrestrained by the conservative attitudes of the latter dynasties. This opened the way for incredibly opulent courtly arts of every kind, including textiles, luxury arms, and the monumental Alhambra vases. Indeed, the creation of arts for the Nasrids became part of the fashioning of a public image: defiant statements of artistic grandeur in a land nearly lost to Islam. It is as if the Nasrids felt they could defy a rapidly encroaching Christian rule through the power of an old and potent visual culture. The essays and entries joined here synthesize tradi- tional wisdom concerning the courtly arts of al-Andalus with recent technical and formal studies, some of which are undertaken in the light of new methods, allowing us to consider these objects and monuments in a broader and richer cultural and historical context. The concen- tration in this volume of diverse scholarly approaches has been particularly fruitful for the study of specific sites, such as the great caliphal palace city Madinat al-Zahra 5 , near Cordoba. Madinat al-Zahra 3 emerges as a rich and multifaceted site because of meticulous archaeological and art historical analysis, by virtue of the socioeconomic and political meaning of its garden forms, and through an understanding of the way taste and the arts formed part of the courtly life created there. We can begin to see the palace as a worldly and elegant setting in which the Umayyads used patronage to play out their rivalry with the c Abbasid caliphate in Baghdad, while creating their own visual identity on a western frontier, in a predominantly Christian land. The new breadth of studies and diversity of methods further serve to free a monument such as the Alhambra from the romance of Orientalist interpretations, which have clung to it since the time of Washington Irving. A clear understanding of the Alhambra's history the func- tion of its rooms, the heritage of its complex planning, and the multivalent meanings of its gardens, the associ- ation of extraordinary textiles, ceramics, and metals with its elaborate interiors, and a vision of the lively urban fabric that flourished around the palaces tend to set loose the legendary monument from its mythical attributes of decadence and prurience. Together with a recent study of the political meaning of the Nasrid fortress, 2 the synthesis of such essays removes the Alhambra from the romantic gaze of the west and gives it a place in the lost, living culture of al-Andalus. These texts reveal, however, not only the persuasive, influential character of powerful royal patrons but also the strength and continuity of regional traditions that survived the vicissitudes of political change. We can now begin to see the arts of the Taifa kingdoms less as simply the slavish imitations of Umayyad patronage and more as original products of nascent regional centers enriched by emerging local traditions and by independent links with both Christian kingdoms on the peninsula and Islamic states in the Mediterranean. These decentralizing developments cut across the en- tire history and geography of al-Andalus. It is the particular contribution of the archaeological studies conducted by scholars of the past two decades to reveal strong local developments in the ceramics of Valencia, Murcia, and the Balearic Islands. In the cuerda seca and sgraffito traditions of Valencia and Murcia, we have a hint of regional courtly style and also of the more widespread manifestations in popular arts that correspond to local domestic architecture. These last developments are central for our under- standing of the heritage of al-Andalus, for the parts of the Spanish Islamic tradition that continue to live on the Iberian Peninsula. For it is these elements of the tradition that were integrated into the fabric of Spanish life and were gradually perceived as belonging to a peninsular expressive vocabulary rather than to a par- ticular religion or rule. This is the case with arts that are called Mudejar. Mudejar arts are traditional Islamic arts that continued to flourish in lands conquered by Christians, primarily because of the continuity of crafts and their adoption by Christian and Jewish patrons. A number of the artistic traditions loosely grouped under the rubric Mudejar endured not only as the result of the survival of Islamic workshops under Christian hegemony but also because many of the arts of al- Andalus were rooted in a local culture and economy rather than in a court or hegemony. Carpet manufac- ture, lusterware ceramic traditions, regional textile production, and the lively development of wooden ceilings were all introduced to Spain as part of Islamic culture; however, by the sixteenth century they were perceived as belonging both to Islamic tradition and to diverse groups of users and makers, as part of the shared culture of Christians, Jews, and Muslims. The impact of the courtly arts on peninsular tradi- tion was also significant. The arts of the Islamic courts were, of course, more charged with meaning and carried deeper associations with their original Muslim patrons than those shared by a broader society. Never- theless, many of the luxury arts were subsequently adopted by Spanish Christians after the fall of al- Andalus. Arms like ivory handled ear daggers, gold jewelry, and luxury ceramics were highly regarded by Christians, and the manufacture of such products con- tinued without pause. The image that Islamic monarchs of al-Andalus sought to create through patronage was powerful and transferred easily across the barrier of divergent politics and religion. Indeed, the Christian monarch Peter the Cruel appropriated the very archi- tecture of the Alhambra for his palace within the Alcazar of Seville, and his vizier Samuel ben Meir ha- Levi Abulafia employed the same decorative styles and techniques in his synagogue in Toledo. Rich tex- tiles with Arabic inscriptions were such a commonly held sign of luxury and power that Christians lined their coffins and reliquaries with them. Clearly their meaning of preciousness and importance — shared by Christians and Muslims alike — was more potent than any encumbering political or religious association. As Islamic science and learning — as manifested in astrolabes, astronomical tables, translations of Aristotle, mathematics, and technology for the manu- facture of paper — passed through Spain to France, northern lands were slowly beginning to feel the im- pact of the visual presence of al-Andalus on European soil. At Durham a ribbed vaulted Romanesque cathe- dral inexplicably sprouts dadoes with interlacing arches that create abstract patterns that are carried throughout the church — patterns that recall those of the Great Mosque of Cordoba and its progeny. From the moment the Almoravids invaded the Iberian Peninsula, the tiled mosques and palaces of Morocco began to reflect the influence of the greatest artistic achievements of al- Andalus. The mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo bears additions that show the impact of Cordoba, and there is evidence of communication between the Nasrid and Ottoman artistic traditions during the last days of al- Andalus. But the most robust bequest of al-Andalus to both Europe and the Islamic world is the legend gener- ated by this brilliant capital on Islam's western frontier. Al-Andalus was to many outsiders an exotic, elegant outpost, a place where the unexpected could happen, a world of splendid wonders. We need to look beyond such myths, of course, but must understand their sources as well. Though these images grow in large XXII part from the imagination of chroniclers, they are the result of the visual world created by audacious and creative patrons. The Islamic arts created for these patrons are di- verse; no single style characterizes the more than seven centuries of Islamic rule on the Iberian Peninsula They are, rather, united by the very intensity that the insularity of the peninsula seemed to confer upon any enterprise undertaken in al-Andalus: Isolation and, at the same time, the proximity of other cultures deep- ened the need to use art to enforce a sense of place and identity. Many of the forms and meanings of the Islamic contribution acquired such force that they survived the demise of Islamic hegemony on the penin- sula not only to feed legends but also to transform profoundly the nature of Spanish art and culture. 1.

Through diplomacy and warfare, they brought the entire peninsula except for Galicia and Asturias in the far north under Islamic control in seven years; however, frontiers with the Christian north were constantly in flux. The Muslims called the new Islamic land al-Andalus, a term that appeared on coins as the translation of Spania, the Latin name for Spain. Their territories were adminis- tered by a provincial government established in the name of the Umayyad caliphate in Damascus and centered in Cordoba. Of works of art and other material culture only coins and scant ceramic frag- ments remain from this early period. 756-929 (a.h. 139-316) The Umayyad Emirate When the Umayyad caliphate of Damascus was over- thrown by the c Abbasids in 750 (a,h. 133), the last surviving member of the dynasty fled to Spain and established himself as Emir c Abd al-Rahman I. c Abd al-Rahman I made Cordoba his capital and unified al-Andalus under his rule with a firm hand, while establishing diplomatic ties with the northern Chris- tian kingdoms, North Africa, and the Byzantine Empire and maintaining cultural contact with the c Abbasids in Baghdad. The initial construction of the Great Mosque of Cordoba under his patronage was the crowning achievement of this formative period of Hispano-Islamic art and architecture. 929-1031 (a.h. 316-423) The Umayyad Caliphate c Abd al-Rahman III reclaimed the Umayyads' right to the caliphate, declaring himself caliph in 929 (a.h. 316). Hispano-Umayyad art reached its apogee during the lengthy reigns of c Abd al-Rahman III and his son al-Hakam II and the regency of the powerful c Amirids, particularly al-Mansur, chamberlain to the nominal ruler, the child-prince Hisham II. Despite their open rejection of c Abbasid political authority, the Umayyads of Cordoba emulated the opulent palatial arts of the centers of c Abbasid power, Baghdad and Samarra. There was also influence from the Fatimid rulers, who had established an independent Shi c ite caliphate in Tunisia in 910 (a.h. 298) and occupied Egypt in 969 (a.h. 359). Perhaps in response to these eastern Mediterranean cultural impulses, which coexisted with a strong indigenous artistic component, there began to appear in Cordoba a nostalgia for the time when the Umayyads ruled the Islamic world from Damascus. Art patronage as a sign of kingship and authority is a theme that emerged from these creative appropriations from abroad and the past. Luxurious objects such as boxes of carved ivory and gilt silver, bronze animal statuary, and richly figured silks were commissioned for palaces decorated with ornate marble capitals, stucco wall panels, and marble fountains. c Abd al- Rahman Ill's palace city at Madmat al-Zahra 3 set the standard for artistic taste in the caliphate, and al- Hakam II's addition to the Great Mosque of Cordoba marked the imposition of a palatial level of luxury and hierarchy on this religious monument. 1031-1086 (a.h. 423-479) Muluk al-TawcPif or the Taifa Kingdoms The Umayyad caliphate collapsed during the fitna, or civil war, of 1010 to 1013 (a.h. 401-4). In various provinces of al-Andalus local governors or chiefs designated themselves as autonomous Taifa rulers (muluk at-TawaHf) — also known as party kings — establishing courts that attempted to equal the splendors of Cordoba in every possible way These leaders lacked significant power because of internecine feuding; the strongest among them were Seville's c Abbadid rulers, whose outstanding king was al-Mu c tamid, Toledo's Dhu'l-Nun family, Saragossa's Banu Hud rulers, and Granada's Zirids. The Taifa kings continued the practice of princely patronage and building monumental palaces, so that the number of centers of literature, music, and the opulent arts increased and important workshops appeared in diverse areas of the peninsula. Many Taifa art forms follow Cordoban trends but at times display a particular taste for the most complex and mannered models. 1088-1232 (a.h. 481-630) The Almoravid and Almohad Rules Led by Yusuf ibn Tashufin, the Almoravids, a newly emerged Islamic power in North Africa, ethnically more Berber than Arab, entered al- Andalus after the fall of Toledo in 1085 (a.h. 478) in response to the Taifa leaders' pleas for help in repelling the Christian armies of northern Spain. The Almoravids assumed control of al-Andalus in 1090 (a.h. 483), while main- taining their primary seat of government in Marra- kesh. Repudiating the lack of piety and what they considered to be the decadence of the Taifa kings, they disdained as well the opulent arts of the Spanish Muslims. Although they began by sponsoring austere programs of architectural decoration, their later mon- uments and textile manufactory in Almena indicate that the Almoravids eventually succumbed to the luxury culture of al-Andalus. In the early twelfth century the Almoravids were supplanted by the Almohads, a new Berber dynasty from the southern Maghrib. By midcentury the Almohads had taken Seville, Cordoba, Badajoz, and Almena. The Almohads made Seville their capital in al-Andalus, while retaining Marrakesh as their center of power in North Africa. After the Almohads were defeated by the combined armies of Aragon and Castile at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 (a.h. 609), a turning point in the peninsula's history, al-Andalus once again fractured into tribute-paying principalities, vulnerable to the depredations of Christian kingdoms. These principalities, except for Nasrid-ruled Granada, soon lost their sovereignty. Tlfe Almohads condemned the arts of the Almoravids; their own, especially architecture, were often but not always more austere. Their rigorous style saw the increasing schematization of ornament and the con- tinued use of geometric designs. The Great Mosque and the minaret called La Giralda, which they built in Seville, are paradigms of Almohad style. 1238-1492 (a.h. 636-898) The Nasrid Kingdom Founded by Muhammad I of Arjona, the Nasrid dynasty ruled Granada and neighboring Jaen, Almena, and Malaga in southern Spain. The early period of Nasrid rule was characterized by insistent pressure from Christian armies of the north, which succes- sively conquered Valencia, Jativa, and Jaen and made the Nasrids tribute-paying vassals in 1243 (a.h. 641). From their palace city of the Alhambra, high on a hill above Granada, the Nasrids formed tentative alli- ances with the Marinids of the Maghrib and kept un- easy peace with their Christian overlords. Nasrid arts grew from Almohad traditions but displayed far more variety and richness than their precursors. The finest military arts that survive from al-Andalus are from this period; the Nasrid's luxury arms, which were probably never used in battle, offer examples of rich craft used to support a public image. During the fourteenth century the Nasrid sultans dedicated them- selves to the decoration of their splendid palaces. The Alhambra, the last major Islamic monument of Spain, was their greatest work. The creation of a succession of Nasrid rulers, in particular Isma c ll I, Yusuf I, and Muhammad V, the Alhambra was conceived as a powerful image for a waning monarchy, a vast stage set for the diminishing power of the last Muslim rule on the peninsula. Severe political crises in the Maghrib in the fifteenth century, combined with the union of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon through the marriage in 1469 (a.h. 874) of Ferdinand and Isabella, whose avowed mission was the expulsion of the Muslims from the Iberian Peninsula, proved to be the downfall of the Nasrids. The last Nasrid ruler, Muhammad XII (called Boabdil by Spanish historians), was exiled to the Maghrib on January 2,1492 (a.h. 898). xxx THE ART OF ISLAMIC SPAIN Islamic Spain, ^de l-irst ^Tour Centuries &n Introduction OlEG GRABAR Jn 711 (a.h. 92) Arab and Berber forces crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and fairly rapidly estab- lished a measure of Muslim control over much of the Iberian Peninsula. 1 Almost four centu- ries later, in 1085 (a.h. 478), Toledo, the ancient seat of Christian power and culture and the more recent center of scientific and philosophical learning in the Arabic language, fell into the hands of the Christian princes from the north. Several centuries would elapse before Islam and the Arabs disappeared entirely from Spain, centuries that would be dominated by the struggle between Muslims and Christians. However, this struggle did not mark the period between 711 and 1084 (a.h. 477), when Islamic Spain became an area unique in all of Europe and the Mediterranean world. Al-Andalus, or the lands controlled by Islam on the Iberian Peninsula, was unique not only in terms of its tangible accomplishments but also for the ways in which it was perceived when it was a power and later, when it was remembered. The first four centuries of Muslim presence and rule in Spain belong to a peculiar moment in the history of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. This was a moment in which Roman and, to an only slightly lesser degree, Iranian imperial culture and political power no longer predominated as they had in the ancient world, and yet the presence of the Roman and Iranian pasts continued to be felt clearly. At another level, these centuries were not times of great clashes between competing and opposing cultures, as would be the case in later years, and yet there was constant confrontation, peaceful or otherwise, between Christians and Muslims. These were not times of fabulous human, economic, and cultural expansion as would occur in the later Middle Ages of western Christendom and the era of the militant empires of Turco-Mongol Islam; and yet it was a period that radically altered the character of the Iberian Peninsula. The purpose of this introductory essay is to explain these early centuries, to identify the threads within their fabric that make their art understandable, and also to set this art within the contemporary me- dieval culture of both the east and the west. I have divided my remarks into three parts: events that set a few chronological guidelines and put what happened on a map; society and culture, with an attempt to point out some of the features of the society that was created in al- Andalus — its behavior and the way of life it engendered, as well as the culture that developed; myth, centered on examples of imaginary tales associated with early medieval Islamic Spain. Events Many stories have been spun around the decision by the Arab commander Musa ibn Nusayr to move a small army of horsemen — Arabs from the east and Berbers from neighboring Morocco, across The Straits into the Iberian Peninsula. All of these tales belong to the mythology of the Arab presence in Spain, and I shall return to one aspect of them in the third part of this essay. It is most likely that, during the heady decades of the late seventh and early eighth centuries, Great Mosque of Cordoba, prayer hall of al-Mansur 3 highly energized Muslim Arab generals moved into any areas that were experiencing vacuums of central- ized power or irreducible internal conflicts. Like North Africa, the bruised and battered Spain of Visigothic kings and of an until recently divided Christianity was such a place. Its political leadership was weak, its popu- lation scattered over a huge territory and torn by competing concerns, both ethnic and spiritual, that were at large in a vast land. A few months after landing in 711, the Muslim armies were in Toledo, in the center of the peninsula. In 714 (a.h. 95) they were in Saragossa to the north- east, and raiding parties had reached almost every center of life in the entire territory of Spain. Other raids moved into southern France — Toulouse, for instance, was attacked in 719 (a.h. 101). The most celebrated of these expeditions led the Arabs all the way into central France, where they were turned back in 732 (a.h. 114) at a battle variously associated with Tours or Poitiers. Little noticed in the Muslim world itself, the battle assumed monumental proportions in Christian European, especially French, history. It was seen as the heroic brake applied to the expansion of an alien world by the west, as a minor skirmish by Arabs. From the very beginning there is thus established a difference in the perception and appreciation of the same events by Muslim and Christian sources. Whether this difference operated in respect to the perception of visual forms at the time they were created and used or, later, when they were studied, is one of the main issues that faces the historian of medieval art in Spain. It is unclear what happened between 715 and 756 (a.h. 96-139). A rapid succession of governors in al-Andalus (during this period of forty-one years there were twenty-two of them, one of whom was at his post for five years) represented the central govern- ment of the Umayyad dynasty in Syria and the authority of the caliphs, successors to the Prophet Muhammad as leader of all Muslims. The early governors' main duties were the collection of taxes and especially the channeling of booty toward the treasuries of the Umayyads in Syria. It is probable that they kept percentages for themselves and for their clients, and for this reason few were maintained for any length of time. What that booty may have been is partly the subject of myth, which contributed to the perceived image of the peninsula in later times. However, several exports are known to have come from Spain or to have been acquired through Spain. Among them were rarities like amber, which came from northern Europe, and in particular both male and female slaves, whose beauty and strength are often mentioned in sources. It is more difficult to know how the land itself and the population were transformed. There probably were not many immigrants, and these consisted of at least as many Berbers as Arabs. In all likelihood the immigrants married indigenous women, since there are almost no records of Arab or Berber women who came to the peninsula. Thus from the very beginning there was created a mixed culture, the nature of which probably contributed much to the unique character of the Arab Muslim civilization that developed in al- Andalus. It is known that the initial influx was pri- marily made up of soldiers and immigrants directed toward cities, but it is not clear whether the country- side was settled by Muslim Arabs or Berbers as early as the first half of the eighth century. Christians for the most part remained where they had always been and did not at first convert very rapidly to the new faith. Jewish communities in the cities assumed great importance. Persecuted and ill-treated by the Chris- tians, Jews eventually found within Islam a legal system that left them relatively free to profit from the new world order created by the Muslims and to maintain their practices and beliefs. Specifically, they acquired easy access to the great centers of early me- dieval Judaism located near Baghdad. Within a generation or two there seems to have been established a loosely organized frontier culture primarily dedicated to supplying the remote centers of the empire with natural resources. This was a culture that adapted itself to local conditions and opportuni- ties. Indeed, the genius of the Arab governors sent from Syria to Spain or, for that matter, to the fron- tiers of China lay in their ability to foster an equilib- rium wherever there were local ethnic, social, religious, or cultural tensions and a Muslim presence that was slowly formulating its own agenda for rule, for collec- tive behavior, and for morality. I shall return in the second section of this essay to some of the features of this equilibrium. It was in many ways an accident of history that took place far away from Spain that transformed a remote frontier province into a major political and cultural force. In 750 (a.h. 133), after several years 4 AL-ANDALUS of civil war in Syria and Iraq, the Umayyad dynasty, which had established a vast Muslim empire from the Atlantic to India, was overthrown by religious, politi- cal, and social groups that came together to oppose its easygoing but self-serving rule. The caliphate was appropriated by the new dynasty of the c Abbasids, and, more important for Spain, the focus of power shifted from Syria and the great Arabian tribes to Iraq, the center of urban Muslim populations, to a bureaucratic complex of administrators who often felt affinities with the culture of the Iranian world, and to a new army that was increasingly Turkic in constitu- tion. The symbol of this change was the founding in 762 (a.h. 145) of the imperial capital Baghdad, officially called Madinat al-Salam, the City of Peace, and meant to stand for Muslim rule everywhere. But the reality was even more important than the symbol, as Baghdad and other urban centers in Iraq such as Kufa, Basra, and Samarra developed into enormous and vital cities that for nearly three centuries were the major loci of intellectual, literary, and artistic activity for the Eur- asian world. The first c Abbasids did their best to kill all the important members of the Umayyad dynasty. How- ever, one of the Umayyads, c Abd al-Rahman ibn Mu c awiya (eventually called al-Dakhil, the Incomer), escaped c Abbasid assassins and in 755 (a.h. 138) reached al-Andalus, where he immediately found support among the Arab or arabicized immigrants, many of whom had come from Syria. In spite of this support, it took him some years to establish himself fully as the emir, or commander of all the local Muslim chieftains. He and his successors in both the emirate and caliphate ruled from their capital, Cordoba, until about 1030 (a.h. 421). Each of these Umayyad rulers played an impor- tant and unique part in forging the new entity of al-Andalus. Hisham I (r. 788-96 [a.h. 172-80]) was an emir who introduced the legal system based on Muslim precedent that would subsequently be used throughout the western Islamic world. c Abd al-Rahman II (r. 822-52 [a.h. 207-38]) was a war- rior who dealt with the emerging Christian kingdom in the north, with internal revolts, and even with Viking raiders who penetrated almost as far as Seville. His son and grandsons, who reigned from 852 to 912 (a.h. 238-300), continued to consolidate and hold together the large territory under Muslim control. The Umayyad dynasty reached the acme of its power in the tenth century under c Abd al-Rahman III (r. 912-61 [a.h. 300-350]). He adopted the title of caliph, which signified that he was the successor to the rule of the Prophet Muhammad, and thus challenged the pretenses of both Baghdad and the new heterodox Fatimid rulers of Tunisia, who would establish them- selves in Egypt and found the city of Cairo in 969 (a.h. 359). After the reign of c Abd al-Rahman 's son al-Hakam II (961-76 [a.h. 350-66]), al-Mansur, the main administrator of the court, wielded the royal power until 1002 (a.h. 393), when the regime began to disintegrate. The two hundred years of Umayyad rule in al-Andalus transformed the southern part of Spain into an actor with a major role in the international relations of the time. There was a war with Charle- magne but also, according to some accounts, an at- tempt at a matrimonial agreement with the great ruler of the north. Byzantium probably saw in Cordoba a potential ally against the c Abbasids in Baghdad and exchanged several embassies with the Umayyads, sending them a stream of gifts and perhaps artists who helped decorate the mihrab of the Great Mosque of Cordoba. Political connections with Iraq and Egypt may have been strained, but cultural and commercial relations were constant. Thanks to the development of revolutionary agricultural techniques and probably to the cultivation of silkworms and new products like rice and vegetables, hitherto unknown in the Mediter- ranean, al-Andalus became a rich producer of consumer goods that were transported as far as India by mer- chants of many faiths. Among the records of such merchants, those of the Jews have been preserved best and have provided a picture of wealth and of consump- tion almost unknown in the Christian north. It was in large measure because c Abd al-Rahman III was aware that the wealth of his lands allowed him to play a major role in the world that he saw fit to assume the title of caliph, which elevated him to the status of the rulers of Constantinople and Baghdad. The centralized system of government developed by the Umayyad princes did not last. In a sense, the Muslims had been too successful — the lands they had conquered were too vast and rugged to control and govern. In all likelihood there were not enough Muslim soldiers and settlers to hold and populate such large territories. Furthermore, the Arabs had no the emirate, caliphate, and taifa period 5 long- standing tradition of efficient dynastic or bureaucratic rule. And finally, Christian leaders were reasserting their power at this time. By the end of the tenth century, local governors took advantage of the weakness in Cordoba and de- clared their independence in at least fourteen different districts. This was the period, which lasted from about 1031 to 1086 (a.h. 423-79), of the muluk al-TawaHf f or Taifa kingdoms, the so-called party kings who transformed their cities into small capitals, fought with one another as much as with the resurgent Chris- tian kings, and often made alliances with Christian rulers against their enemies, whether Christian or Muslim. Because such clashes often resulted in the ruin of local economies and the loss of land to the Christians, these petty rulers generally have been judged rather harshly by historians. Yet they made a contribution that bore considerable fruit over the following centuries. Under their rule a series of hitherto minor provincial areas like Malaga, Granada, Badajoz, Valencia, Almeria, and Saragossa, as well as the old city of Toledo, which had lost some of its luster, acquired identities of their own. They became centers of literature and of culture, and their rulers, ministries, or rich inhabitants sponsored major works of art. Thus, when the Berber dynasties emerged at the end of the eleventh century to clash with the crusading princes of Castile or Aragon and to bring a rigid form of Islam to the warring states, they found an al-Andalus of many cities of distinct character and tradition. Society and Culture It is nearly impossible to reconstruct the life and the culture of the Arab Muslim world of al-Andalus in these early medieval centuries and to understand the nature of the people who prayed in the Great Mosque of Cordoba and used the extraordinary carved ivories produced in the workshops of Spain. I will merely attempt to suggest something of what that life and culture must have been by concentrating on two themes: the variety of people and goods that were found in al-Andalus, and the quality as well as origi- nality of its literature, of its ways of life, and of its thought. Ibn Hawqal, a tenth-century geographer from Baghdad, visited Spain, in particular Cordoba, during the first half of the tenth century He was a bit of a snob in his judgments of places far away from the capital of the Muslim world — he was, for example, very critical of the horsemanship practiced on the peninsula; but he took appreciative notice of the availability of mercury, iron, and lead, and especially of the manufacture of many different kinds of textiles, dyed wools, silks, felts, and linens. These were exported all over the Muslim world, as were slaves from Scan- dinavia and Slavic areas who had been bought in northern Christian markets, and ivory tusks acquired on the edges of the Sahara desert and crafted in the royal cities of al-Andalus. Before Cairo was founded, only Constantinople and Baghdad challenged Spanish cities in terms of the variety of exotic products and slaves available in their markets. Muslim geographers usually discuss only Muslim populations. From them we have learned that most of the Muslim inhabitants of the cities and of the country- side in Spain were Arabs from the east and Berbers from North Africa, the majority of whom were totally arabicized. These Muslims, particularly if they could claim descent from immigrants from the east, con- sidered themselves a social elite. Many, in fact, were landowners whose property, which was cultivated by others, had made them wealthy. A large number of Spanish Muslims, however, were muwalladiin, Chris- tian natives of Spain whose ancestors had converted to Islam out of religious conviction or to gain higher social status or economic advantages. Side by side with the Muslims lived large com- munities of Christians called Mozarabs because they had acquired an Arab culture although they remained strongly attached to their traditions. These attach- ments sometimes caused conflict — for example, in the middle of the ninth century, a group of Christians in Cordoba sought martyrdom by insulting the faith of the Muslims and provoking cruel retribution. But such cases were relatively rare, and, as has been noted, the Umayyads and their successors maintained a workable equilibrium between Christian and Muslim communities. Another significant group among the mixed population was made up of Jews, who played a particularly important role in the life of al-Andalus because they were among the richest and most suc- cessful merchants from Spain. These disparate groups, no matter what had brought them to al-Andalus, shared a characteristic that is curious and most interesting in terms of its 6 AL-ANDALUS psychological effect: They had an allegiance to centers or to issues outside of Spain. Christians technically were subject to the Roman hierarchy, which, during this period, admittedly was remote and inaccessible and often at odds with local theological, liturgical, and social aspirations. However, the bishops in the uncon- quered north of Spain gradually became more power- ful and by the latter part of the eleventh century consolidated their control and encouraged the slow growth of the influential sanctuary of Saint fames in Compostela. The Jews of Spain consulted the rabbis and learned men of Iraq in matters of faith. Moreover, they were connected through marriage with their core- ligionists in North Africa, Sicily, Egypt, and even India. The northern or African slaves who worked on the peninsula or passed through it for lands even more remote from their birthplaces also brought with them traditions and memories of their native cultures, although they left no record of them. It is fascinating that during the period of Islamic domination of Spain, even the Muslims expressed an affection for a place and time outside of their extraor- dinarily powerful rule — articulating a nostalgia for a past long gone and for lands and ways of life far away. The early Muslim settlers developed a kind of cult around memories of the Umayyad dynasty in Syria; they compared existence in Spain to a fantasy of what life had been in Syria, and they gave Syrian names to their creations in Spain. Thus al-Rusafa, the name of the Umayyad capital in Syria, became the name of a palace in a suburb of Cordoba, and Arabic poetry in al-Andalus often sang of the beauties of Syrian land- scape. This was a curious nostalgia that voiced no expectation of return, fostered perhaps because these memories helped sustain the struggles of the Spanish Umayyads against the c Abbasids of Baghdad. In the ninth century a second wave of influences from the east engulfed the Muslim elites of Spain. This wave is epitomized by the Iraqi singer Abu'l- Hasan ibn Nafi c , known as Ziryab. It is difficult to identify his contributions precisely, as he is credited not only with the introduction of new and more sophis- ticated ways of singing poetry but also of refinements in the realm of everyday life and behavior: new techniques for cooking and for makeup, polite manners for dining with silken tablecloths, new fashions in hair and clothes. This revolution in manners was accompanied by an influx, starting in the ninth century, of luxurious consumer goods from the East, such as the celebrated necklace known as al-thu c bdn (the snake), which had belonged to the wife of Harun al-Rashid. Whether or not these accounts of elegant life and rich goods were true is not as important as the fact that they were believed. By the tenth century, the most brilliant and creative century of the early period of Islamic rule, the Umayyads thought themselves to be in the cultural succession of the great Baghdad of the eighth and ninth centuries. Nostalgia for a lost cultural past was replaced by a feeling of superiority: The Umayyads considered themselves to be more than the equals of the c Abbasids, having forged a unique Andalusian Arab culture. It should be noted here that Spanish Christians, who held diverse religious views and had mixed feelings about their past as well as about the contemporary scene, created an extremely original culture, which was different from that of the Roman church of the north and often very close to the Arab culture of Muslims or to the Muslim culture of Arabs. In at least two respects the culture of Cordoban Umayyad Spain reached a pinnacle, elaborating on traditions appropriated from c Abbasid Iraq. First, Arabic poetic forms were cultivated, as witnessed in the love poetry of Ibn Hazm, which is suffused with a genuine lyricism that confers upon the verses a combination of amorous concreteness and esoteric imagination. There was also a new emphasis on learning, marked by a fascination with science, with the Arabic language, and with the philosophical dis- course on reason and faith that had been a focus of the intellectual life of Iraq in the ninth century. More- over, during the eleventh century these great ac- complishments were transmitted from Cordoba to dozens of smaller centers in al-Andalus. The world created by the Umayyads in Spain was one of striking wealth of many kinds. There was com- mercial wealth based on goods and slaves from the north and south that passed through al-Andalus. There was wealth in terms of consumption, as the caliph's court, first in Cordoba and then in the new capital city of Madmat al-Zahra\\ commissioned and used thou- sands of objects in gold and ivory, masses of textiles of many different sorts, and whatever else made a life of high luxury. There was a wealth of productivity and of exchange, as artisans learned to make items such as silks and boxes for the pleasure of the rich everywhere, THE EMIRATE, CALIPHATE, AND TAIFA PERIOD 7 and as goods changed hands in markets carefully supervised by well-trained officials. There was also a wealth of information, thanks to the libraries of Cordoba, which became celebrated all over the world, far outshining those of the Christian west. There was a wealth of thinking about the meaning of life, about God, and about material things. And there were poets to sing of all the ways of wealth. Myth Islamic Spain was present within the mythical mem- ory of the entire Muslim community and most partic- ularly within its Arabic- speaking areas, which had been fed on stories of the conquest. I will relate only four of these myths, as they suffice to provide a sense of the meaning of Umayyad Spain to Muslim culture as a whole. The first story concerns the conquest itself. Ac- cording to later historians, the daughter of a Christian governor was kidnapped by the last Visigothic king, Roderic. The governor called on the Arabs installed across the Mediterranean to help him avenge the dishonor done to his family, and they obliged by conquering Spain. Thus, the invasion of Spain was represented as a moral venture pursued to rectify a crime. It is difficult to determine why this rather un- usual type of conquest story developed, but a likely guess is that it originally was spun by or for Chris- tians seeking to explain to themselves the appearance of Arab Muslims in their midst as a consequence of their sins. The other myths come from a rather extraordi- nary book compiled by al-Zubayr in the latter part of the eleventh century. One describes all sorts of gifts given or received by Muslim rulers. Among these was an exceptional object alleged to have been discovered in an old church of Saragossa by a treasure hunter (today he would be called an antique dealer). This was a cylindrical bronze pyxis that contained a glass pyxis; inside the glass pyxis was a black ring stone with an image of a sexually aroused monkey. It was said that a man who held the ring stone in his hand or mouth would have an erection; when the object was set aside, the erection subsided. The Arab grandee from Sicily who obtained the pyxis gave it to one of his eunuchs as a meanspirited joke. The eunuch broke the ring stone, and it became ineffective. In this tale an object from Spain brings eroticism and magic to another Muslim land. The character of al-Andalus as a rich and remote frontier where license, wealth, and a strong, strange Christian culture mingled made it a mythic place for those who lived in other corners of the Islamic world. Significantly, works of art, as signs of wealth and cultivation, were at the center of the creation of such stories. That these legends were conceived as a means to understand the identity of this remote and exotic appendage of the Islamic world is clear in two other stories, in which the mythical imagery is more politi- cal in nature. The first concerns a table of gold and silver with inlays of precious stones. Once the prop- erty of Solomon, the son of David, it had been carried from Jerusalem to Spain by a mythical king. Accord- ing to legend, it was found during the Muslim con- quest of a fortress near Toledo, and it eventually"
