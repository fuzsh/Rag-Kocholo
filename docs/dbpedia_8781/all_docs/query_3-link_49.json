Born in Antigua, he was interested in music from an early age but took a long route to his profession, becoming a rural schoolteacher, playing basketball for the Guatemalan national team, whilst playing guitar and writing songs in his spare time.\n\nHe has enjoyed 25 years of success since his breakthrough album Animal Nocturno in 1992. Since then he has switched styles and formats many times from intimate ballads to electric epics whilst all the while building his audience and winning a string of Grammys.\n\nExpect romance and charm aplenty, but there are also plenty of songs in his considerable catalogue that reflect political messages that tackle controversial topics like US intervention in Latin America and migration."
