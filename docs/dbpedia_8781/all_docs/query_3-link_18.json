        "text": "After reaching an audience of more than three million people with “Hecho A La Antigua,” the most viewed streaming concert in the history of music in Latin America and Spain, Ricardo Arjona set a precedent with BLANCO Y NEGRO, as it has been considered the artist's most daring bet. It is a breath of fresh air from an established singer-songwriter who is constantly reinventing himself and who typically doesn’t repeat cities on a tour, is ready for BLANCO Y NEGRO: VOLVER.\n\nWhile everyone looked to follow popular trends in music, Ricardo Arjona chose his own path and ventured out to the legendary Abbey Road studios to produce 24 original songs. Once again, contradicting everything that exists in music in Spanish and reinforcing more than ever what he knows how to do best.\n\nAnyone who thinks that BLANCO Y NEGRO is the most popular project on the radio, or that appears in the most playlists on Spotify are wrong. With a black and white aesthetic and a video for each song, recorded in the same studio in London where the 24 songs were made, Ricardo Arjona started a project amid a pandemic that industry scholars pointed out as doomed to fail. It brought together elements not commonly used nowadays in the music industry recording live instruments with equipment from the 60s, without any technological fuss.\n\nTo this day, BLANCO Y NEGRO, with close to 100 shows between Europe, United States and Latin America, is one of the most popular tours in the market. More than 1.5 million fans attended the concerts last year, all claiming that the show is not just a concert but a unique experience. The tour was distinguished as one of the 20 most powerful tours in the world along with Coldplay’s and several others."
