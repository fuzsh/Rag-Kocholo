There, he replied to a question about his love life, stating, “I’m very much in a relationship.” When asked who he’s dating, the 44-year-old responded, “You’ll find out very soon. I’ve been in a relationship for a while.”\n\nHere’s what we know about Jason Momoa’s new girlfriend:\n\nAdria Arjona is a Puerto Rican-Guatemalan actress\n\nThe 32-year-old has starred in a number of films and TV shows over the years. Per her IMDB page, these include True Detective, Narcos, Emerald City, Pacific Rim: Uprising, Life of the Party, Triple Frontier, Morbius, and Father of the Bride, to name a few.\n\nShe has a famous father\n\nArjona’s father is the internationally renowned Guatemalan singer and songwriter Ricardo Arjona. In a 2018 interview with People, she talked about how he inspires her. “He motivates me and pushes my limits and makes sure that I’m always growing as an artist,” she said. “He is constantly making me cultivate my head, not just my physicality.”\n\nShe was previously married\n\nBefore dating Momoa, Arjona was married to a lawyer named Edgardo Canales. They tied the knot in 2020, and attended the Vanity Fair Oscars party together in 2020, but it’s unclear when they split up for good, per People.\n\nShe likes to keep moving\n\nArjona loves to travel. According to Flaunt, she grew up between Central and South America, Mexico City and Miami, before moving to New York City to attend the Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute when she was 18. She told the publication that she spent a lot of time on the road with her father too. “Growing up in that environment taught me that that’s the kind of lifestyle I want to live. I never want to be in one place for too long. I dislike comfort a lot,” she said.\n\nAnd has a passion for fashion\n\nOn Instagram, Arjona showcases her passion for luxury brands. From donning the coveted Prada Galleria bag and Tiffany & Co. necklaces, to attending Loewe and Ralph Lauren shows and wearing show-stopping gowns from Carolina Herrera, it’s clear she has access to some of the best brands in the biz.\n\nHow did Adria Arjona and Jason Momoa meet?\n\nAccording to People, Arjona and Momoa probably met while filming Sweet Girl in November 2019. It was released in 2021.\n\nPeople think she looks a bit like his ex, Eiza González\n\nThe resemblance is uncanny! For years, netizens have been confused between the two, who have even been described as looking like twins by some media. It seems they are friends too, based on reports.\n\nThe Dune actor dated González in 2022 after his split from then-wife Lisa Bonet, per People."
