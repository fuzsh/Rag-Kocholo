        "text": "1. THE ARABS ON THE IBERIAN PENINSULA From 711, until 1492 (Conquest of Granada by the Catholic Kings)\n\n2. SUMMARY: Al-Andalus political evolution (Elima Benito) Militar occupation and rivality (Paula Márquez) Society and economy (Garbiñe Aranguren) Art and culture (Patricia del Barco)\n\n3. AL- ANDALUS , POLITICAL EVOLUTION\n\n4. IN THEIR VICTORY COINCIDED TWO FACTORS  The height of the expansion of the Islam  The decadence of the visigoth kingdom\n\n5.  Muslims began to conquer the iberian peninsula coming from the south.  Two important muslims: Musa and Tarik (his subordinate).  Musa was callen for the witizanos to combat against the visigoth king Rodrigo.  In 711 Musa sent 7000 soldiers with Tarik.  Tarik did not obey the instructions that he had received of Musa , he entered in a new territory invaded and he continued his conquest.  Musa arrived to Algeciras in 712 because he was jealous of his subordinate.  Musa continued to the north and when he was in Lugo he received orders to come to Damasco and he left his government to his son Abd-al-Azz.\n\n7.  Conquested territories by capitulation: the most important with Teodomiro in 713.  Capitulation:when muslims could not conquer a territory they used to sign a pact of capitulation giving visigoths a relative autonomy even they could sometimes govern this territory.\n\n8. THE POPULATION IN THE IBERIAN PENINSULA  MUSLIM POPULATION: • Bereberes: Morocco, Argelia, Tunisia and Libya. They settled in unpopulated areas. • Arabs: in the most populated areas. They were: -Yemenies: Arabian Peninsula. They arrived with Musa. -Syrians: north of the Arabian Peninsula, Irak and Syria.  MULADIES: hispanogoths who were converted to the Islam.  NON-MUSLIM POPULATION: • Mozarabs: christians who lived in a muslim territory. • Jews\n\n9. MILITAR OCCUPATION. DIVERSITY AND RIVALITY.\n\n11. AL-ANDALUS, POLITICAL EVOLUTION  Primacy and glory, VIII-X Century  Political Disruption and loss of land, XI-XIII Century  The final withdrawal, XIII- XV Century\n\n12. PRIMACY AND GLORY  Dependent emirate („valiato‟) 711-756. - Initial settlement - Ib.Peninsula  simple province of the Caliphate of Damascus - Governed by a Emir (depend political, religious and militarily on the Caliph) - Great political instability - Military campaigns: a) Covadonga Battle, 722 b) Poitiers Battle, 732\n\n13. The independent emirate of Bagdag, 756- 929 - Revolt led by Persian Groups  pushed out the Umayyad - New Caliph Abul-Abbas  new dynasty, the Abbasid  translate the capital of the Caliph to Bagdag. - Abd al-Rahman I, Umayyad member  Ib.Peninsula establish himself as the Emir of Córdoba ( independent militarily and politically but not religious) Caliph of Cordoba, 929-1031 - Abd-al-Rahman III  929 he proclaimed himself Caliph - Golden age of al-Andalus, above all during the reign of Al-HakamII - Most remarkable figure Militarily Almanzor  Caliphate under his command became military dictatorship. - Died Almanzor political turmoil and fighting between rival factions marked the final phase of the caliphate  ended up disintegrating into numerous Taifa kingdoms\n\n14. POLITICAL DISSRUPTION AND LOST OF LANDS  Taifa Kingdoms, 1031.1090 - Beginning of XI century  some territories independent - In 1031 a rebellion in Cordoba overthrew the last Caliph- Hisam III  fragment into a multiplicity of Taifa kingdoms - Stage is characterized by a number of features: 1. Frequent disputes between the different Taifa kingdoms 2. High initial number was reduced the incorporation of smaller with larger ones 3. Depended on the payment of pariahs 4. His political weakness did not translate, however, not in economic nor in cultural decline\n\n15. - Military advance and the growing strength of the Christian kingdoms  Taifa kingdoms saw the need to agree to make common cause and seek outside help Almoravid Unification, 1090-1145 ⁻ Christian conquer of Toledo –> Kings of Sevilla, Granada and Badajos call Almorávides. ⁻Yusuf Ibn Tashfin beat 1086 Alfonso VI –Z battle of Zallaqah. ⁻1090 return  objetive :incorporate to the Almoravid Empire the Taifa kingdoms ⁻However, the power of the Almoravids fails to fully consolidate The second Taifa kingdoms, The Almohad unification, 1145-1237 - 1145, the decomposition of the Almoravid power had caused in Al- Andalus a return to a political fragmentation  second Taifa kingdom - Almohads became to incorporate the new Taifa kingdoms postalmoravids - The complete unification reached in 1172 Seville turned in the capital. - `Battle: Las Navas de Tolosa‟ 1212 fall down of the Almohads - Weakening Almohad power the thirdTaifa Kingdoms. - However, Christian advance  succumbing all, except of the Granada kingdom.\n\n16.
