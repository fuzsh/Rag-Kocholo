        "text": "Aquaman actor Jason Momoa is dating fellow Hollywood star Adria Arjona. Before finding each other, they were both married for several years. In 2017, Momoa wed actress Lisa Bonet. Their marriage lasted five years, and in January 2022, they announced their split in a joint statement. Bonet officially filed for divorce two years later, in January of 2024. They had two children together, Lola Iolani (16), and Nakoa-Wolf (15).\n\nArjona reportedly announced her engagement to Puerto Rican lawyer Edgardo Canales in August of 2018, after about two years of dating. In February 2020, she brought him to the Vanity Fair Oscars after-party.\n\nThe couple kept their relationship relatively private, and it is unclear exactly when Arjona and Canales parted ways.\n\nAhead everything you need to know about Adria Arjona.\n\nArjona and Momoa went Instagram official in May 2024.\n\nMomoa confirmed his relationship with the Puerto Rican-born actress on May 20, 2024, on his Instagram. He shared some photos documenting a recent trip to Japan, and in the carousel were pictures of Arjona—including one where his arms are wrapped around her waist, as they sat in a restaurant. He called her “mi amor” in the caption.\n\nIn a video posted to X, Momoa confirmed that he was in a relationship, but kept his girlfriend’s identity a secret.\n\n“I’m very much in a relationship,” he said when a fan asked if he’s single. But when she asked who his lucky lady is, he answered, “You’ll find out very soon.”\n\n“I’m very much in a relationship. I’ve been in a relationship for a while,” he added. “I’m really enjoying privacy ’cause back in the day no one gave a fuck, and now everyone does. I’m still the same guy.”\n\nArjona is an actress.\n\nArjona previously told ELLE.com that she moved to New York City when she was 18 years old to pursue an acting career. She attended the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, and she told People that she was also working as a waitress and a hostess.\n\n“I learned the value of money and working hard,” she recalled. “It helped me because I got to be on my feet. And I think today I can do 16-hour days thanks to being a waitress.”\n\nOne of Arjona’s first notable roles came in 2015, when she played Emily in the HBO series In 2017, she became the star of her own show, when she was cast as Dorothy in a modern-day retelling of The Wizard of Oz. In 2019, she starred alongside Ryan Reynolds in the 2019 Netflix action-comedy film 6 Underground.\n\nArjona is also known for playing Bix Caleen in the 2022 Star Wars series and Martine Bancroft in , which was released the same year.\n\nWhen promoting her latest film Hit Man alongside Glen Powell, Arjona told InStyle that she almost quit acting early on in her career.\n\n“It was too much pressure. I was so scared,” she told the magazine, “and it was the first role that was ever just offered to me, which is so bizarre. I was at a point in my career that nothing should have been offered to me.”\n\nArjona said that she didn’t feel that she deserved or worked for the role, but Good Omens (2019) creator Neil Gaiman helped change her mind.\n\n“[Gaiman] was like, ‘No, it’s you. I see you and I only see you in this role,’” Arjona told InStyle. “And I was like, ‘How the hell do you even know who I am?’ And I think it was the first time that I felt really insecure about my take on a character because I didn’t earn it. Usually you go out, you audition, you work on it, and the director’s like, ‘Oh, I like her take on it, so I’m going to hire her.’ And this was the first time that they hadn’t seen me. So I went in really scared and really insecure, and Neil just took me under his wing and was like, ‘You’re going to be fine.’”\n\nArjona said that she told Gaiman, “‘Look, you can shoot me Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday in small scenes; you have Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to find another actress.’ And he was like, ‘No, dude, it's going to be you.’”\n\nArjona played Momoa’s wife in a 2021 film.\n\nIn 2021, Momoa and Arjona both starred in the film Sweet Girl. The movie follows Ray Cooper (Momoa) and his teenage daughter Rachel (Isabela Merced), who are seeking justice after his wife Amanda (Arjona) tragically passes away.\n\nAlthough it is unknown when or how Momoa and Arjona met, there is a possibility that working on Sweet Girl brought them together.\n\nArjona’s father is in the spotlight.\n\nIf you don’t know Arjona, you may know her father, Ricardo Arjona, world-renowned Guatemalan singer. According to his career spanned three decades and he won a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album in 2006 for his record Adentro. Throughout his career, he has garnered a total of five other Grammy nominations. In 2017, Ricardo was awarded with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Billboard Latin Music Awards.\n\nIn March 2018, Adria said of her father, “He motivates me and pushes my limits and makes sure that I’m always growing as an artist. He is constantly making me cultivate my head, not just my physicality.”\n\nThe actress added, “My whole family is excited and super supportive in what I do. My dad is my number one fan. He shows my clips to all of his friends and it’s really cute. I’m happy that I can make him proud.”\n\nOn Monday, June 17, Momoa was speaking with Entertainment Tonight at The Bikeriders premiere in Los Angeles when he shared a detail about his relationship with Arjona. The actor loves to bike in real life and shared that she’s often seated behind him with her arms around his waist.\n\n“My lady likes to ride,” he said, adding, “ Any excuse for more hugs.”"
