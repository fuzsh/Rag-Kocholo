        "text": "Al-Andalus refers to the Iberian Peninsula under Islamic rule, primarily during the medieval period. The term is commonly used to describe the territory that was governed by various Islamic dynasties, starting with the Umayyad Caliphate in 711 AD until the completion of the Reconquista in 1492. The region covered present-day Spain and Portugal, as well as parts of southern France.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDuring the Islamic rule, al-Andalus was known for its cultural, scientific, and artistic achievements. Cities like Cordoba, Seville, and Granada became centres of learning and prosperity. The Alhambra, the Great Mosque of Cordoba, and other architectural marvels are remnants of this rich Islamic heritage in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe period of al-Andalus is characterized by a mix of Islamic, Christian, and Jewish influences, creating a unique cultural and intellectual environment. The fall of Granada in 1492 marked the end of Muslim rule in the region and the beginning of the Catholic Monarchs’ completion of the Reconquista.\n\nAl-Andalus under the Umayyad Governors (711-756 CE)\n\nOn July 19, 711, an army of Arabs and Berbers unified under the aegis of the Umayyad caliphate set foot on the Iberian Peninsula. Their arrival marked the beginning of a transformative period. Over the course of seven years, a blend of diplomatic strategies and military might enabled them to assert Islamic dominance over the entire peninsula, with the exception of Galicia and Asturias in the distant north. However, the boundaries along the Christian north remained in a constant state of flux, shaped by the ebb and flow of conflicts.\n\nThe Muslims referred to this newly acquired Islamic land as al-Andalus, a term that was also used on coins as the translation of Spania, the Latin name for Spain. The territories were governed by a provincial government established in the name of the Umayyad caliphate in Damascus, with its centre in Cordoba.\n\nThe Umayyad Emirate (756-929 CE)\n\nWhen the Abbasids overthrew the Umayyad caliphate in 750, the last surviving member of the Umayyad dynasty sought refuge in Spain. This survivor, Emir Abd al-Rahman I, established himself as a leader. Choosing Cordoba as his capital, he brought together Al-Andalus under his strong rule. Abd al-Rahman I skillfully built diplomatic relationships with northern Christian kingdoms, North Africa, and the Byzantine Empire. At the same time, he maintained cultural ties with the Abbasids in Baghdad.\n\nOne remarkable achievement during this time was the initiation of the construction of the Great Mosque of Cordoba under his patronage. This marked a pinnacle in the early era of Hispano-Islamic art and architecture.\n\nThe Umayyad Caliphate (929-1031 CE)\n\nIn 929 (A. H. 316), Abd al-Rahman III boldly asserted the Umayyads’ claim to the caliphate, proclaiming himself caliph. This marked a significant moment in the history of the Hispano-Umayyad era. The artistic brilliance of this period reached its zenith under the extensive reigns of Abd al-Rahman III and his son al-Hakam II, as well as during the influential rule of the Amirids, notably al-Mansur. Al-Mansur held a position of power as the chamberlain to the nominal ruler, the young prince Hisham II.\n\nAbd al-Rahman III’s palace city, Madinat al-Zahra, became a hallmark of artistic excellence in the caliphate. The addition made by al-Hakam II to the Great Mosque of Cordoba reflected a lavish and hierarchical touch, transforming the religious monument into a symbol of palatial luxury. This period witnessed a remarkable fusion of political power and artistic splendour in the heart of the Umayyad caliphate.\n\nMuluk al-Tawaif or the Taifa Kingdoms (1031-1086 CE)\n\nThe Umayyad caliphate faced a collapse during the tumultuous period of civil war known as the fitna, occurring from 1010 to 1013. In the aftermath, different regions of Al-Andalus witnessed local governors or chiefs asserting autonomy, designating themselves as Taifa rulers (Muluk al-Tawaif), also called party kings. These rulers aimed to replicate the grandeur of Cordoba in their own courts.\n\nHowever, these leaders struggled to consolidate significant power due to internal conflicts and infighting. Among them, the Abbadid rulers of Seville, led by the exceptional king al-Mu’tamid, stood out as the most formidable. Other notable factions included the Dhu’l-Nun family of Toledo, the Banu Hud rulers of Saragossa, and the Zirids of Granada. Despite their attempts to emulate Cordoba’s glory, the Taifa rulers faced challenges in maintaining stability and unity within their territories.\n\nThe Almoravids and Almohads (1088-1232 CE)\n\nUnder the leadership of Yusuf ibn Tashufin, the Almoravids, a newly emerging Islamic force from North Africa with a predominantly Berber ethnicity, entered Al-Andalus following the fall of Toledo in 1085 (A. H. 478). The Taifa leaders, facing the threat of Christian armies from northern Spain, sought their aid, leading to the Almoravids assuming control of Al-Andalus in 1090 (A.H. 483). Despite their dominance, Marrakesh remained their primary seat of government.\n\nIn the early twelfth century, the Almoravids were replaced by the Almohads, a new Berber dynasty from the southern Maghrib. By the mid-century, the Almohads had conquered Seville, Cordoba, Badajoz, and Almeria. Establishing Seville as their capital in Al-Andalus, they maintained Marrakesh as their power centre in North Africa.\n\nHowever, the Almohads faced a significant setback at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, where they were defeated by the combined armies of Aragon and Castile. This event marked a turning point in the history of the peninsula. Al-Andalus once again fragmented into tribute-paying principalities, making them vulnerable to the encroachments of Christian kingdoms. With the exception of Nasrid-ruled Granada, these principalities eventually lost their sovereignty. The defeat at Las Navas de Tolosa signalled the decline of Muslim rule in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe Nasrid Kingdom (1238-1492 CE)\n\nEstablished by Muhammad I of Arjona, the Nasrid dynasty held sway over Granada and nearby regions such as Jaén, Almeria, and Malaga in southern Spain. In the early years of Nasrid rule, they faced persistent pressure from the Christian armies of the north. Successively, these forces conquered Valencia, Jativa, and Jaén, making the Nasrids tribute-paying vassals in 1243 (A.H. 641).\n\nPerched high on a hill above Granada, the Nasrids ruled from their palace city, the Alhambra. They forged tentative alliances with the Marinids of the Maghrib while maintaining an uneasy peace with their Christian overlords to the north.\n\nDuring the fourteenth century, the Nasrid sultans devoted themselves to adorning their magnificent palaces. The Alhambra, their grandest creation, stands as the last significant Islamic monument in Spain.\n\nHowever, in the fifteenth century, severe political upheavals in the Maghrib and the union of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon through the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1469 posed a significant threat to the Nasrids. Ferdinand and Isabella were determined to expel Muslims from the Iberian Peninsula. This marked the decline of the Nasrids. The final Nasrid ruler, Muhammad XII (known as Boabdil by Spanish historians), was exiled to the Maghrib on January 2, 1492, marking the end of Muslim rule in Granada and the completion of the Reconquista."
