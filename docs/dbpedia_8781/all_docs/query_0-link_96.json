Obviously, any reinterpretation of any given period in history is a serious undertaking, and every effort has been made to justify what has been written. A narrative of the 800-year period between 711 and 1502 cannot hope to take into account every aspect. Where sources are available, they cannot be allowed to speak for themselves. They will invariably give rise to questions, and these need to be addressed. There is both a necessity and an obligation to select and interpret. Selection is required because a study of this nature is perforce limited, and selection itself involves a measure of subjectivity. This is not to say that an objective approach is undesirable; rather that it is consistently unachievable. Within these parameters, it should be possible to open up perspectives on the past, respecting the facts such as they are or such as they can be established. At the outset I was faced with a number of problems. The first, a terminological one, arose from the phrase ‘Muslim Spain’. These two words could refer to any period when Muslims resided in the Iberian Peninsula, irrespective of whether or not this was within an Islamic state. Consequently, this would apply not only to the Moriscos of the sixteenth century, but also to the mudéjares, Muslims who remained as such after the conquests in the first half of the thirteenth century. Yet, my concern was with al-Andalus, that part of the Iberian Peninsula which at any one time was under independent Muslim control. Although some attention has been accorded to the influence of Islam beyond Andalusi borders, the primary focus was on al-Andalus. Furthermore, as will become apparent, I am reluctant to accept the distinction between Muslim Spain and Christian Spain, not least because, as has been said by others, Spain as a country had not yet come into being. I felt that it would be possible to overcome this terminological difficulty through incorporating the word ‘reconsidered’ in the title. This word may imply a radical rethink, but at face value simply indicates that the subject is going to be looked at or thought about again. The reconsideration led me to make a number of decisions. First, the scope has been amplified. The book is not a rejigging of familiar material. The aim has been to maintain a discernible historical framework\n\nForeword ix\n\nwithin which events are treated chronologically. However, an attempt has also been made to address issues other than purely political ones: economic, societal, religious and climatic, for example. It seemed appropriate to blend literary and cultural aspects into the narrative, rather than deal with them in separate chapters. It is hoped that, in this way, a fuller, rounder picture of a given period has been achieved. Second, the decision was made to end the narrative at 1502 when, according to the official law of the state, Muslims ceased to exist in the Iberian Peninsula. Although many of the Moriscos, as they were henceforth known, were cryptoMuslims, they do not fall into the same category as their predecessors and ancestors. Furthermore, recent studies, notably the excellent monograph by L. P. Harvey, have provided ample new perspectives on the Moriscos.1 Third, with respect to bibliographical matters, the procedure adopted has been to provide chapter endnotes for specific references, both in English and in other languages. Then, at the end of the book there is a bibliographical list of works consulted and recommended. A point to make here, however, is that I have often used nineteenth-century and pre-1970 works or editions, not necessarily because I made a conscious decision not to look at later ones, where they exist, but for reasons that may perhaps be considered to be ideological. As far as editions are concerned, some later editions may improve on earlier ones in the readings of specific words, and they frequently have very good introductions or helpful notes, but the actual text will have altered only slightly. I have had recourse to translations, often in conjunction with the Arabic or Latin texts. Regarding scholarship, our horizons are being constantly extended, but it is salutary to bear in mind the contributions of scholars in past generations. The quality of their erudition has often been ignored, and whilst erudition does not necessarily equate with trustworthy scholarship, we neglect their work to our own loss. I do not think that any interpretation has been distorted by not taking into account every conceivable book, article or paper written on the subject. On the other hand, nothing has been deliberately disregarded. Throughout, the priority has been to identify and address issues which are judged to have been significant, thereby, it is hoped, both striking chords and expanding perspectives. It will become apparent that two themes have been given prominence, certainly when dealing with the earlier centuries. These are the importance of maintaining a distinction between urban and rural communities, and the need to recognise that religion played a less dominant role in affairs than has been hitherto thought. The second of these themes is not one arrived at lightly; nor has it been superimposed on any given event or situation. It started initially many years ago from a recognition that the Arabic word ‘ajam was being consistently rendered as ‘Christian’, whereas it is a religiously neutral word referring to those who speak Arabic imperfectly, and by extension foreigners. This led,\n\nx Muslim Spain reconsidered\n\nover a period of years, to a realisation that the role of revealed religion had been assigned a higher profile than it warranted, notably in the interpretation of the history of the Iberian Peninsula in the Middle Ages. Throughout the long journey of writing this book, I have been conscious of an enormous debt to those who have undertaken this or adjacent tasks before me. I shall list the works of many scholars in the bibliography, but my immediate responsibility here is to name those who have made a more personal impact. The late Professor Harold V. Livermore wrote to me on a number of occasions with his views on writing history, and I have taken them to heart. The late Professor M. A. Shaban, who spent the final years of his academic career in Exeter, insisted on the primacy of sources. We were planning to write a history of Muslim Spain together and did carry out some ground work, but the venture never came to fruition. I had the benefit of many conversations about Islamic history with him, but this is not the book that we would have written. Professor Edmund Bosworth has read and provided comments on many chapters, and I am exceedingly grateful to him for his time and attention. He is exonerated from all errors. Dr Jane Whetnall kindly proofread a chapter, removing inconsistencies, identifying and correcting solecisms and asking penetrating questions. Being a Hispano-Arabist in a British university has been a lonely occupation, but for forty years I have been encouraged by Professor L. P. Harvey, who has corresponded with me regularly throughout a busy career and an equally active retirement, during which he has published two books of great value on the later period of Muslim Spain and the Moriscos. He has offered a thoughtful, clear and reasoned opinion on a range of issues and controversies, and I have had the advantage of his immense learning and knowledge, the latter always willingly imparted. I have been privileged in having him as a kind of unofficial mentor during my career, but he is not to be held in any way responsible for the views expressed in what follows. I would finally like to thank Professor Carole Hillenbrand and Edinburgh University Press for entrusting this task to me.\n\nNote 1. L. P. Harvey, Muslims in Spain, 1500–1614, Chicago, IL and London: University of Chicago Press, 2005.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIberian background\n\nIberia was the name given to the Peninsula by Greek authors, notably by Herodotus in the fifth century bc. The only designation of the Iberian Peninsula by Latin writers had been Hispania, a province of Rome, alongside Gaul and others. It was in current use in the first century bc. It has long been supposed that Hispania may derive from the Phoenician, used by the Carthaginians, and subsequently adopted by the Romans. At the time of the invasion, the Peninsula was a Visigothic state. To use the word ‘Spain’ (España) at this time is to superimpose a notion of nationhood that simply was not present. There were identifiable regions such as Galicia, but nothing to justify the denomination of Spaniard. Spain did not come into existence until the Early Modern era, as a consequence of the unification of Castilla and Aragón during the reign of Fernando and Isabella. Hence there was never any ‘Arab’ invasion of ‘Spain’. The phrase ‘Muslim Spain’, whilst being more accurate in the first part, presents the same problem. Al-Andalus was the name given by the Muslims to their territory in Al-Andalus with its shifting borders. From the mid-thirteenth through to the end of the fifteenth century, Al-Andalus was confined to a reduced area in the south-east corner of the Peninsula roughly covering the present-day provinces of Granada and Málaga, with approximately 200 miles of coastline. It would be appropriate to employ this term in a study exclusively devoted to the Muslim-controlled area of the Peninsula. There are many other instances when the meaning of a word is of the utmost importance, and much attention will be paid to this aspect. As a preliminary reflection, it is worthwhile remembering the physical nature of the Peninsula, isolated from Europe by the Pyrenees, divided at intervals by four dominant rivers and characterised by notably contrasting terrains. What might be called a Mediterranean climate prevails over the lower, southern half of the Peninsula. Within this area, the Guadalquivir valley, with its extensive irrigation, cuts a swathe through the landscape. Here one can discern some similarity with the terrain in North Africa, but the analogy should not be overstretched. The central plateau is by and large flat and arid, whereas the climates of the more mountainous northern and north-west regions are more European, subjected as they are to the seasonal extremes of temperature that are not present in the south and south-west where a more Mediterranean climate prevails. Much has been made of the Pyrenees as a barrier between the Iberian\n\n2 Muslim Spain reconsidered\n\nPeninsula and the rest of mainland Europe. These forbidding mountains have long been considered impenetrable, but in the western area, the lower passes, such as Roncesvalles, have always been reckoned to be passable. The heights are similarly moderate in the eastern zone. It is in the central Pyrenees where the mountain peaks are at their highest. As a generality one could say that travellers therefore avoided these, and crossed at either end. Not only this, but the habitable areas spanned the present-day borders between France and Spain, the Basques in the west and the Catalonians in the east both dwelling in lands to the north and south of the Pyrenees. The Cantabrian mountain chain inland from the Bay of Biscay is another barrier that tends to get overlooked. Yet it effectively separates the narrow coastal stretch from the body of the Peninsula. Most attention, though, has always settled on the Pillars of Hercules, the so-called Straits of Gibraltar. This waterway, thirty-five miles long and an outlet of the Mediterranean Sea into the Atlantic Ocean, is eight miles across at its narrowest point. The rock is plainly visible from the African mainland. A journey across the Straits, then, is a far less daunting prospect than attempting to negotiate the Pyrenees. The landing places from Tangier would be Tarifa and Algeciras, the former named after a Muslim leader and the latter from jazīra, the Arabic for island. These are diagonal crossings making the distance somewhat longer, but even a small boat would not find the prospect unmanageable in a day, weather permitting. The natural harbour of Ceuta was also an embarkation point for the south and south-east of the Peninsula. Allowing for the vagaries of the winds and the currents, intercontinental crossings would have been commonplace from time immemorial. The earliest inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula were named Iberians by the Greeks. They are largely regarded as having been of Mediterranean stock, from North Africa, which is understandable in the light of the ready access across the Straits, and which may be regarded as a natural demographic movement. They have taken on the mantle of indigenous stock. The Celts, on the other hand, who arrived in the sixth century bc, were of central European origin. They merged, over time, with those already in situ, and, as a consequence, the name Celtiberians came into being. The Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians and others who occupied and traded from Iberian ports, both on the Atlantic, notably Cádiz, and in the Mediterranean, deserve to be mentioned but did not leave great marks on the Peninsula. Their collective contribution is dwarfed by the indelible mark that the Romans left, after the defeat of the Carthaginians by the younger Scipio, in 206–7 bc. The Iberian Peninsula was then divided into two vast provinces, Hispania Ulterior (Further Spain), in the south beyond a notional border inland and parallel to present-day Cartagena, and Hispania Citerior (Nearer Spain), incorporating the northern areas. Despite initial and serious opposition from indigenous tribes to permanent Roman settlement, amongst whom the Celtiberians occupying an area roughly equivalent to\n\nIberian background 3\n\nCastilla la Nueva were prominent, a succession of Roman armies brought the Peninsula inexorably to heel. A turning point was the capture and utter destruction, in 133 bc, of Numantia, near Soria, which set the seal on Roman supremacy. The final regions in the Peninsula to be conquered by the Romans were those in the far north and north-west, Cantabria, Asturias and Galicia, eventually subdued by the legions of Augustus around 25 bc. Henceforward, a number of subdivisions were created, including Galicia, Lusitania (comprising not only present-day Portugal, but also a substantial portion of Extremadura) and Baetica (Andalucía). The conquest of the Iberian Peninsula had been, in Leonard Curchin’s words, ‘a war of attrition’, but what was to follow is a remarkable story of absorption, as a consequence of which the majority of the inhabitants of the Peninsula came to be known collectively as Hispano-Romans.1 The Romanisation of the Iberian Peninsula occurred over several centuries, although it is thought that the southern regions, Hispania Ulterior, came first. A treaty was made with the people of Gades (Cádiz), about 200 bc, and they were accorded Roman citizenship by Julius Caesar in 49 bc. The Roman theatre became a notorious place for the puellae gaditanae (the girls of Cádiz), whose dancing and singing made them popular in Rome. The merits of Hispalis (Seville), lying on the banks of the navigable river Betis, later named Guadalquivir (the wādī al-kabīr, the Big River), by the Muslims, were recognised by the Roman governors, and an aqueduct was constructed to carry water into the city. Cordoba and Mérida, however, were provincial capitals, and as such demonstrated thorough signs of Romanisation. Cordoba, founded in the second century bc, the smaller of the two and capital of the province of Baetica, was also strategically placed. The nearby Sierra Morena was a source for mineral wealth, gold, silver and copper all being mined there. The foundations of the substantial Roman bridge across the Betis, still in place, made for ready communication with the north and provided essential access for trade. Olive oil from the surrounding groves was regarded as among the finest exported to Rome, as good as the Italian, according to Martial, and its importance cannot be underestimated. The olive oil industry was established by the first century ad, and helped to bring prosperity to the urban community who controlled much of its cultivation. Inscriptions and surviving amphorae indicate that olive oil from Hispania was exported to all parts of the Mediterranean, and in significant quantities. Additionally, Cordoba was the central distribution point for wool, which was held in high esteem, both for its quality per se, and for its products. It seems probable that among the principal reasons why Cordoba was later chosen as the Muslim capital of al-Andalus in the eighth century was because of its being a thriving economic centre, trading in mineral products and agriculture, at the hub of which was the olive oil business. Mérida (Emerita Augusta), however, was a city of major importance in the Roman Empire, and evidence of its status can be seen today in the existing\n\n4 Muslim Spain reconsidered\n\nbridge across the river Anas called the Guadiana (the wādī ana), the aqueduct known as Los Milagros, and the imposing restored theatre. When Augustus, in the first century bc, decided to build a network of roads in the Peninsula, the western route went from Seville, through Mérida to Salamanca, crossing the Tagus by a seven-arched bridge. Later Vespasian (9–79 ad) planned a route across the centre of the Peninsula, linking Mérida, via Talavera and Toledo, to Saragossa, following the Tagus for much of the route. The lower route, linking Mérida with Valencia, passed through the important mining town of Almadén, still in Baetica Province, where the cinnabar mines from which mercury was extracted were its raison d’être. They were closed at the turn of the twentieth century after 2,000 years of continual use. During the Roman period, because of the popularity of cinnabar as a colouring agent and its cosmetic potential, these mines were responsible for virtually the entire supply of the Empire’s mercury, and later their products were exported throughout the Muslim world. Chrysocolla, used for a greenish blue paint, was quarried in Asturias. Saragossa (Caesar Augusta) owed its prominence in part to its strategic position on the banks of the river Ebro. Major roads passed through the city, from Tarragona (Tarraco), the capital of the largest Roman province to Palencia, Asturias and Galicia in the north-west, thus linking the Mediterranean with the Atlantic. It was also where the route from the south connected with a smaller road to Jaca and to the Pyrenees beyond. A Roman bridge was constructed, destroyed in Muslim times. The fact that Galicia in the remote north-west of the Peninsula was made readily accessible to transport in Roman times is principally due to its mineral resources. Gold mines in Galicia and in Asturias had been extensively mined in the pre-Roman era. Their value, notably for trading purposes, was incalculable, and ensured that the whole region was far from being a neglected outpost in the northern fastnesses, as has been the general perception. Silver, lead and iron were also mined in Galicia, as is testified by Pliny. The mineral resources throughout the Peninsula were profitably exploited and exported, certainly as far as gold, silver, lead and copper were concerned, by the Romans to Rome, Italy and further afield.2 Special mention has to be made of salt, which was used to preserve fish, and for medicinal purposes, notably in the treatment of bruises. There were extensive supplies in Baetica and in the pro­ vinces of Tarraconensis and Cartaginensis. Salted fish was prepared in Cádiz and in many of the Mediterranean ports, and was transported to Rome by sea. As the network of roads was constructed across the length and breadth of the Peninsula, so Latin was introduced along the routes. Latin as a language was a unifying factor among the indigenous peoples and, perhaps as early as the first century ad, was in widespread use, certainly amongst urban communities. Latin was the language of the law that was incumbent on all Roman citizens so, alongside Romanisation, Latinisation reached out over the Peninsula. In Baetica, in particular, the process was very thorough, such that one could talk of\n\nIberian background 5\n\nthis province as being not only the home but also the epitome of ‘Roman Spain’. The exception to this was the Basque region, which preserved its civic and linguistic independence from Rome. What kind of Latin was spoken in the early centuries ad is difficult to gauge, but certainly the differences in speech would have been reflected in the classes of society. The fabric of society was Roman, but it is important to bear in mind the distinction between the urban and rural communities. The former, notably in the principal Roman cities, would resemble Roman citizens in other parts of the Empire, with the corresponding degree of culture and sophistication. In rural areas, where the demands of the land were the prime concern, the process of Romanisation would have been less rapid and more haphazard. An important factor in this regard is Christianity, which may have spread to the Peninsula as early as the second century ad. The division of the Church into five ecclesiastical provinces took place in 297; the Church Council at Elvira, Granada, in 300 ad had a total attendance of nineteen bishops, and preceded by four years the significant edict of religious toleration decreed by the emperor Constantine, which allowed ‘full freedom to all existing forms of worship, with special reference to the Christian’.3 The fact that Bishop Hosea of Cordoba presided at the Council of Nicea in present-day Turkey in 325 is an indication of the prestige enjoyed by some members of the clergy in the Peninsula. Monasticism appeared in the Christian Church in the fourth century ad, and later, as a consequence of the widespread propagation of the Rule of St Benedict from the early sixth century onwards, became established in the Iberian Peninsula. When the Roman Empire crumbled, the Iberian Peninsula became the object of interest for a number of Germanic tribes, possibly in part because they were generally rather than specifically aware of the natural and mineral resources over which the Romans had presided for so long. The Alani had established contact with the Suevi and with the Vandals in central Europe. The turmoil in the Roman Empire in the fifth century was precipitated by the destruction of Rome by the Visigoths under their leader Alaric in 410. During the first half of this century, these tribes all penetrated the Iberian Peninsula, leaving either little or, in the case of the first three mentioned, no trace of their presence. In so far as the Visigoths were concerned, from the time of their invasion of the Peninsula in 456 until defeat by the Muslims in 711, they exercised political control from their capital in Toledo, having transferred their headquarters from Toulouse in Gaul. The general consensus is that the legal codes that were drawn up during the Visigothic period were founded on the Roman code of law that had been observed and applied previously. That is to say, whatever impact this legal system may have had on the rural communities in the Roman period was continued after the collapse of the Empire. Urban government was perpetuated, and taxes were collected by representatives of the cities. That is to say that the division between urban and rural communities which was later to\n\n6 Muslim Spain reconsidered\n\nbe of such significance during the Islamic period, was already prevalent in the earlier epochs. The rule of the Visigothic state was through monarchy, with around twentyfive kings for the 250-year period. The seventh century was a particularly volatile one, with sixteen kings occupying the throne, and only one for a reign longer than ten years. The momentous decision to adopt Catholicism in place of Arianism was taken at the Third Council of Toledo in 589 ad under the kingship of Reccared. The state thereby moved rapidly to one in which Catholic doctrine prevailed. This did not bring about a burgeoning of new churches, or at least not in the smaller towns or the rural areas where the majority of the population lived. What it did provide was the cultural context for the most important writer of the Visigothic period, Isidore of Seville (c. 560–636 ad, canonised in 1598). His Etymologiae, dating to the 630s, was a compendium of knowledge, encyclopedic in its range, and a resource for scholars in succeeding centuries. His reputation was that of a defender of the Church, and, as with other bishops, he was party to administrative decision-making. This did not necessarily mean rubber-stamping state policies, as indicated by his questioning of the advisability of anti-Jewish measures such as enforced conversion. He was truly an intellectual giant for his generation, and the influence of his writings in later centuries cannot be underestimated. The position of the Jewish communities under the Visigoths in the seventh century is determinable, to a certain extent, from the measures enacted in the Councils of Toledo.4 These measures included injunctions from the monarch, so it is evident that anti-Jewish legislation emanated from the highest authority. Although forcible conversion was never enacted, there is a record of escalating persecution, culminating in the measures of the Seventeenth Council of 694, held in Toledo. The property of Jews should be confiscated, their families broken up and dispersed, their youngest children brought up as Christians; they should have the status of slaves, and be forbidden the practice of their religion. Until this point, Jewish merchants had to operate under increasingly severe restrictions, and prominent Jews had held positions of authority. The reasons for the sanctions against the Jewish presence in the Peninsula may include resentment at their evident power and status, fear of their acting collectively in opposition to the state and, towards the end of the seventh century, an obsessive preoccupation with rumours that they may have been planning to establish a kingdom in the south-east corner of the Peninsula, rallying to the call of a second David. There is some indication from the bishops that some of the sanctions were not wholly enforced, particularly in the south of the Peninsula, but the consequences for the rural communities were indeed dire. Those who had relied on Jewish merchants for trade could no longer do so, and found it difficult to dispose of their produce, agricultural or pastoral. They became, in consequence, disaffected with the Visigothic state, and were later, quite naturally, unwilling to\n\nA\n\nAQUITAINE\n\nPoitiers\n\nParis\n\nN FRA Geneva Lyon\n\nKIS\n\nAachen Cologne\n\nH\n\nD\n\nC A\n\nL I P H A T E\n\nCartagena M\n\nE\n\nD\n\nI\n\nNS XO Paderborn\n\n697\n\nE\n\n670\n\nQairawãn\n\nT\n\nBAVARIA\n\nB\n\nY\n\nZ\n\nA\n\nLO\n\nMB\n\nARD\n\nN Messina T\n\nNaples\n\nOF Rome T H E\n\nA D R I AT I C SEA\n\nS\n\nDanube\n\nB A LT I C SEA\n\nPalermo SICILY R A Carthage N E MALTA\n\nR\n\nM\n\nRavenna Florence\n\nMilan Verona Venice\n\nDOM KING\n\nEN\n\nRatisbon\n\nHM\n\nA\n\nS\n\nL\n\nI\n\nA\n\nN\n\nN\n\nV\n\nBA\n\nMap 1 Europe and the western Mediterranean in the eighth century.\n\nCeuta\n\nY\n\n100 200 300 400 500 Kilometres\n\n711 Y\n\nA\n\n0\n\n300 Miles\n\nM\n\nTangier\n\nU\n\n200\n\nBRETONS\n\nKENT\n\nCanterbury\n\nSA\n\nElb e\n\nN\n\nT OR\n\nO\n\n100\n\nOCE AN\n\nMERCIA\n\nSEA\n\nNORTH\n\nEAST ANGLIA\n\nNORTHUMBRIA Ripon York\n\nHexham\n\nGlastonbury London WESSEX e e st Winch\n\nWELSH STATES\n\nE\n\nBASQUES Turin Grenoble Oviedo Vigo AST U RI Genoa AS Toulouse Santa Comba de Bande San Juan Marseille de Baños Quintanilla de las Viñas br 714 San Pedro de la Nave o CORSICA Saragossa Barcelona Tagus Mérida Tarragona Toledo Santa María de Melque RICS SARDINIA EA AL B Cordoba\n\nATL ANT IC\n\nKINGDOMS\n\nIRISH\n\nSCOTTISH KINGDOMS\n\nKINGDOM OF THE PICTS\n\nGD\n\n0\n\nTrade routes\n\nSecular (mostly royal) sites with substantial surviving fragments or known from literary sources\n\nEcclesiastical structures of which significant remains survive\n\nKingdom of the Lombards\n\nFrankish Kingdom\n\nByzantine Empire\n\nDate of Muslim conquest\n\nMuslim Umayyad Caliphate\n\nr\n\n714\n\nne\n\nS\n\nLT\n\nE\n\nIC\n\nPE\n\nL\n\nES\n\nS\n\nE\n\nE\n\nM\n\nA\n\nThessalonica\n\nOP\n\nCRETE\n\nP\n\nI\n\nAthens\n\nR\n\nE\n\nSmyrna\n\nConstantinople\n\nBULGARIA\n\nSEA BLACK\n\nRho KIN\n\nLimit of Muslim influence Oviedo\n\nChristian territory\n\nSantiago L I C A G\n\nCommunication routes\n\nA S T U R I A S\n\nIA\n\nLeòn\n\nAmaya\n\nAstorga\n\nBurgos\n\nTuy\n\nL\n\nE\n\nÓ\n\nN\n\nToro\n\nZamora rebuilt 893\n\nSimancas repop. 899\n\nLamego\n\nOporto to Leòn 868\n\nGuadalajara Coimbra to Leòn 878\n\nMadrid\n\nT WSA R AL-A AL THAGH Talavera\n\nCoria\n\nHue\n\n-\n\nToledo\n\nSantarem\n\nA\n\nAL THAGHR AL-ADNA Badajoz\n\nLisbon\n\nL\n\n–\n\nA\n\nN\n\nD\n\nA\n\nMérida Medellín\n\nL\n\nU\n\nMalagón Calatrava la V\n\nCaracuel de Calatrava\n\nFAHS AL-BALLÜT AL-BALLUT Beja\n\nAndújar\n\nAL-SHARAF\n\nMértola Silves\n\nNiebla\n\nCaramona Carmona Seville\n\nFaro Jerez\n\n0 0\n\n100 Miles 100\n\n200 Kilometres\n\nÚbeda Baeza\n\nCordoba\n\nCadiz\n\nBaena Cabra Lucena Estepa Morón Archidona Bobastro\n\nJaén\n\nÉcija\n\nRonda\n\nTAKURANNA RAYYU\n\nLoja\n\nMálaga\n\nGibraltar\n\nMap 2 Al-Andalus in the ninth and tenth centuries, showing the frontier zones.\n\nElvira\n\nGu Granada Alhama de Granad Almuñécar\n\nK I N G D O M\n\nO F\n\nT H E\n\nF R A N K S\n\nCarcassonne Narbonne\n\nRoncevalles Pamplona Jaca\n\nya Calahorra\n\nBurgos\n\nHuesca Barbastro Tarazona Monzon Monzón A L ‘ ’ AL-A Saragossa HR Tudela\n\nAG TH AL\n\nBarcelona Calatayud Daroca\n\nMedinaceli\n\nTarragona Tortosa\n\nuadalajara Teruel\n\nadrid Huete\n\n-\n\nMinorca\n\nCuenca\n\nMallorca\n\nCastellón\n\nUclés\n\nValencia\n\nA\n\nL\n\nU\n\nS\n\nIbiza Játiva\n\nMalagón Calatrava la Vieja\n\nDenia\n\nThe Principal Campaigns of Al-Mansur Al-Man Alicante\n\nOrihuela Úbeda Baeza\n\nT\n\nM UD\n\nIR\n\nMurcia\n\nN AVA R R A ARAGON\n\nElche KINGDOM OF ÓN LEO\n\nLorca Elvira\n\nBaza Guadix\n\nGranada Alhama de Granada Almuñécar\n\nCartagena\n\nPechina Almería\n\nCordoba\n\n370/981 375/985\n\n387/997 392/1002\n\nTangier\n\nTarifa (1292)\n\nSeville (1248)\n\nGibraltar (1462)\n\n(1275)\n\nCeuta\n\n0\n\n0\n\nAlgeciras (1342–44)\n\nRonda (1485)\n\nZahara (1481)\n\nÉcija\n\nir al q uiv Guad\n\n50\n\nCordoba Córdova (1236)\n\nBaza (1489)\n\nBaza (1489)\n\nAlmería (1490)\n\nMarinid attacks (c.1240–c.1360)\n\nChristian incursions into al-Andalus\n\nMajor battle site (Muslim victory)\n\nMajor battle site (Christian victory)\n\nChristian conquest fall of city with date\n\nCastille\n\nNasrids (1232–1492) Kingdom of Granada\n\nVera (1488)\n\nHuéscar (1488)\n\nMuslim dynastic seat\n\na r r a s p u j A l\n\n(1491) Granada\n\nMap 3 Granada, c. 1230–1500.\n\n100 Kilometres\n\n50 Miles\n\nMálaga (1487)\n\nAlhama (1482)\n\nLoja (1486)\n\nCambil (1485)\n\nJaén (1246)\n\nIberian background 7\n\nsupport it against the invaders from North Africa. This may be seen, perhaps, as tacit rebellion on the part of the rural communities, a recognition that, at the level at which they conducted their lives, their livelihood was being adversely affected. As a natural consequence, they would have reacted favourably if not eagerly to any change in regime that would bring their lives back to normal. When the invasion occurred in the spring of 711 ad, the indigenous rural population would learn by rumour that those who had governed them from Toledo were being replaced. They would not know that those who established rule in Cordoba and Seville were Muslims, nor would this fact have meant much to them, had they been aware of it. The Iberian Peninsula is a vast land mass, and few would have come into contact with the invading forces or have witnessed any battles at first hand. The tempo of life in early and mid-summer in the south, where most of the activity took place, would have been slow and have moved at a leisurely pace. One suspects that only those in urban centres would have been aware that regime change was occurring.\n\nIslamic background The interpretation of the available information concerning the origins of the Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula is fraught with difficulties. It is generally agreed that an invasion occurred in 711 ad, and that the invaders were Muslims. However, the nature of the sources, both Latin and Arabic taken together, makes the construction of a coherent narrative problematic. There is an uneven Latin chronicle of 754 that deals with events at both extremes of the Mediterranean, and this is certainly an early source. Amongst other names, it is known as the Chronicle of 754, this date being that of the final entry. Its author, probably from Toledo, shows a surprisingly detailed knowledge of Arabic dynastic succession, and is evidently an opponent of those in control of al-Andalus. Arabic histories and other writings are some generations in time later than the events or subjects they describe. They do often quote previous writers by name but, taken altogether, are far from providing a coherent account. The circumstances surrounding the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula by Muslims, then, has to be pieced together, constructed like a jigsaw whose pattern is withheld. One can compose a plausible narrative on the basis of a limited number of sources, drawing from both the Latin and Arabic tradition, as Harold Livermore did, in his case using principally the indispensable Akhbār Majmū‘a (940 ad) and the Chronicle of 754.5 Or, one can rely primarily on one account, decrying the merits of others. This was the approach of Roger Collins who gave precedence to the Chronicle mentioned, while maintaining considerable scepticism towards the ‘main Arab historical works’.6 Pedro Chalmeta based his groundbreaking 1994 study of the invasion of Hispania and the Islamicisation of Al-Andalus on both Arabic and Latin sources.7 Then there is the radical alternative approach\n\n8 Muslim Spain reconsidered\n\nadopted by Ignacio Olagüe with his eyecatching title, Les Arabes n’ont jamais envahi l’Espagne.8 It makes sense, first of all, to enquire into the reasons for invasion from an Islamic perspective, or, more precisely perhaps, from the point of view of the invaders. Since the death of Muhammad in 632 ad, an Islamic empire had come into being, penetrating, soon after the year 700 ad, beyond the eastern borders of present-day Iran into Baluchistan and Afghanistan in the east, and reaching the Atlantic Ocean in the west. This does not necessarily mean that an empire was established over this extent of territory, but it does imply that there was what may be called an Islamic presence. When a city was captured, a garrison was left, and this was not always sufficient to hold the territory after the army had moved on. In the case of the North African seaboard, Qayrawān, in present-day Tunisia, was founded as a military base in 670, and later became the headquarters of the Muslim domains in North Africa. There is a fundamental distinction that has to be drawn in order to get nearer to an understanding of the seventh- and eighth-century political and social arena. Arabs were inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, whereas Muslims denoted followers of Islam. After Muhammad’s death, Arabs controlled the empire initially from Damascus which was the seat of the Caliphate until 750 ad, when it moved eastward to Iraq and eventually to Baghdad. Arab tribesmen were recruited into the armies, and received the statutory stipend, making enrolment an attractive proposition. According to al-Kindī, there were 30,000 to 40,000 such tribesmen in Egypt at the turn of the eighth century, thus diminishing the manpower in their lands of origin to a very considerable extent. Around the year 700, almost all Arabs were Muslims, but not all Muslims were Arabs. The further away the Muslim armies were from Damascus, the seat of the Caliphate at that time, the fewer the Arabs amongst their number. By the end of the first century of the Hijra, though, a considerable proportion of troops in Islamic armies were non-Arabs recruited from the subject territories, part of the attraction being the statutory stipend. In order to qualify for this, it was necessary to convert to Islam. This entailed acknowledging the articles of faith incumbent on Muslims and enshrined in the formula ‘There is no God but God, and Muhammad is the Prophet of God’. The practical requirements of the convert were the daily prayers, observance of Ramadan, the giving of alms and, if affordable, the hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca. For the rank-and-file soldier, the first of these would have had to be learnt and recited. Apart from prayers which, one imagines, would have been supervised, the others would hardly have had much relevance for a serving soldier. When the Iberian Peninsula was invaded, the Muslim troops consisted almost entirely of recruits from the indigenous populations of North Africa. A knowledge of Arabic was not a prerequisite, though from one example it is evident that some Arabs were concerned about this. Mūsā b. Nusair, the governor of Ifrīqiyya, when he appointed Tāriq b. Ziyād\n\nIberian background 9\n\ncommander of the Muslim forces in Tangier, sent ‘with his army, which was composed almost entirely of Berbers, a teacher to instruct them in the Koran and the essential duties of Islam’.9 Yet, this does seem to have been a desperate measure. Tāriq commanded about 10,000 troops, and one amongst so many is likely to have had a negligible effect, if any at all, particularly if he only spoke Arabic. The troops stationed in Tangier would have spoken the languages of their own home towns and villages. Arabic is not a language that can be readily acquired. It is simply inconceivable that it could have been understood, let alone mastered, by conscripts. At best, one may suppose that they could have followed basic commands given in Arabic, and that they had a rudimentary grasp of essential military vocabulary. To summarise at this point, the conversion of soldiers, then, even if it occurred on an individual level, would have required them to undertake the basic obligations, such as the declaration of the Muslim credo, which would have been memorised, one assumes, in Arabic. It should be said, though, that certain law schools permitted the recitation of the fātiha, the opening sūra of the Qur’ān and indeed all the ritual prayers in the convert’s own tongue. In the light of this, one might deduce that, for the troops recruited from indigenous populations into the early Muslim armies, conversion was simply a matter of convenience. The impetus for a Berber soldier, for example, to change his lifestyle would have been infinitesimal, reduced perhaps to what was required to avoid any clashes with those who were in authority over him. The further from the central lands of the Near East the Muslim armies, the greater the percentage of non-Arabs incorporated into their ranks. There had always existed a tension between Arab Muslims, who considered themselves superior in the hierarchy of Islam, despite the unambiguous declaration in the Qur’ān that ‘The believers are brothers’ (49: 10), and non-Arab Muslims. Muhammad had made it quite clear that it was not lineage that determined pre-eminence in Islam: ‘The noblest of you in the sight of God is the most godfearing’ (49: 13). Nobility is not therefore conferred through inheritance, wealth or position, but through behaviour, actions and moral responsibility. Yet Arabs sought to maintain their prominence throughout the first centuries of Islam, even though they were far outnumbered by Muslims from other ethnic origins. These were the mawālī (converts), sometimes translated rather misleadingly as ‘clients’, initially because of their attachment to a particular Arab tribe, and thereby entitled to the benefits of being affiliated to that tribe. As the conquests escalated, they were members of the indigenous population of the territories subdued by the Arab and, later, Muslim armies, who converted to Islam. Much of the conflict in early Islam was among Muslims themselves: internecine struggles among Arab factions and religious sects, and revolts by non-Arab Muslims nurtured by deep-rooted resentment that they were considered second-class citizens within Islam. Although the legal status of the mawālī has been widely discussed, the precise nature of the conversion is less well attested. For example, as\n\n10 Muslim Spain reconsidered\n\nhas already been mentioned, there was no obligation to learn Arabic. This is not to deny the primacy of the Arabic language within Islam, especially in the first century of Islam. The language of the Qur’ān and the hadīth (traditions of Islam) was Arabic, and it was revered as the language of the Prophet Muhammad and of God Himself. The study of lexicography, and particularly the language of the Arabs of the desert, was a serious pursuit amongst scholars. It was the language of poetry and scientific investigation. In Islamic courts, therefore, Arabic had pride of place, but amongst the converts in urban communities, and notably throughout rural areas in lands subjected to Islamic governance, it could not be expected that Arabic should be spoken or taught. One of the crucial points for an appreciation of the rapid expansion of Islam in the first century of the Hijra relates to the incentives afforded to those who joined the Muslim armies. Hajjāj, appointed governor of Iraq in 695, paid 300 dirhams a year to recruits to his army, with a putative increase by a hundred soon afterwards, thus setting the precedent of a regular yearly stipend for the troops.10 These would have been silver coins (dirhams), perhaps minted for the purpose, and there is no reason to suppose that the practice of encouraging recruits with an annual stipend was not also pursued in North Africa. Of course, such payments would have been supplemented by booty, an important fact to recognise in the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula. Hajjāj’s pragmatic measure, then, had beneficial repercussions in the farthest reaches of the Empire. A second crucial point in determining the motives for the expansion of Islam is the role of jihād (Holy War), that is to say war conducted against unbelievers. Yet, in the first century of Islam, it is not certain that Muslims fought under any injunction of Holy War. This interpretation of the Arabic verbal root jahada, which has the underlying meaning of ‘strive’, seems not to have justification from the Qur’ān. Sūra 9, verse 73, which contains the word jahada, is translated as follows: ‘O prophet, strive against the unbelievers and the hypocrites. Be harsh with them. Their abode is Jahannam [Gehenna] – an evil journey’s end’.11 Similarly, ‘Do not obey the unbelievers and strive mightily with it [the Qur’ān] against them’ (25: 52). In these instances, the notion is that of striving in defence of one’s religion, and there is nothing to indicate that this is to be brought about with weaponry of any kind. Fighting, from the different Arabic root qatala, is to be undertaken in defence of the faith rather than in propagation of the faith: ‘Fight in the way of God against those who fight you, but do not be the aggressors – God does not love aggressors – And kill them wherever you come upon them, and drive them out of the places from which they drove you out’ (2: 190–1). The initial phrase is taken to mean that fighting is permitted when the faith is threatened, a defensive mechanism where a state of war exists. The final sentence has been interpreted as an invitation to fight unbelievers generally, but the context would suggest that that the ‘them’ are ‘those who fight you’, a reading accepted by early authorities. From the evidence of the Qur’ān, then, there is no incentive\n\nIberian background 11\n\nto support the affirmation that jihād, in the sense of Holy War, was a motivating factor in the expansion of early Islam. In the light of this, the idea of religious fervour even as a contributory factor to the rapid expansion of Islam needs to be treated with extreme caution. On the other hand, within the regions of Islam, belief in the efficacy of Muhammad’s legacy led to pragmatic policies being introduced. This may be seen in the treatment of subject peoples as Islam spread. Where there was recognition of the supremacy of the Islamic forces, and no armed military resistance, then the terms of surrender were generous, in effect allowing the local scriptural religions to continue to be practised without hindrance, subject only to the payment of a fixed tax, known as the jizya. This policy soon brought about the existence of whole non-Muslim communities within Islamic territories. The legal status of these peoples was that of dhimmīs, those who lived under a pact or treaty, a dhimma, whereby they were protected from specifically Muslim chores, and permitted to go about their business and their religion, always provided that they paid the said jizya, and did not offend Muslims in any way in their behaviour.12 The advantages for the Muslims in having communities of dhimmīs in their domains were principally twofold. They benefited from the extra taxation, which in most areas was efficiently collected, and also from allowing the local economy, in the hands of the indigenous population, with their special knowledge of the terrain and of local conditions, to flourish. On the other side of the coin, there were the converts to Islam, the mawālī, who enjoyed many of the privileges of being a member of a particular tribal unit; hence they were also called clients. These were integrated in varying degrees within particular tribes, being differentiated principally by the fact that they were not Arabs. Islamic legislation allowed for the presence of many diverse groups within Muslim territories, such as these mawālī and the ahl al-kitāb; they were assigned specific names, all crucial to an interpretation of the social and political situation in the early centuries of Islam. There are more cogent explanations to account for the unprecedented expansion of the Islamic Empire. It was military prowess that enabled Arab armies to sweep through the Byzantine and Sassanian empires, bringing much of them under Islamic rule within a few decades after the death of Muhammad. It is a simple and ineluctable truism that successful conquests have changed political maps in what seems to be an inordinately rapid space of time, and this was the case with the Arabs whose militia overwhelmed their opponents. The precise way in which battles were fought, the formation of troops, the tactics of warfare and the organisation required were all paramount. It was an escalating tidal wave of conquest, frequently masterminded by warriors on the field of battle. The rewards for them were booty, and an opportunity to gain preferment in the Caliphal headquarters in Damascus. Although the conquest of Egypt in 640 has been described as ‘a classic example of the spontaneous and\n\n12 Muslim Spain reconsidered\n\nhaphazard manner of the Arab conquests’,13 the strategy adopted by the Arabs when they established their headquarters in Fustāt, Old Cairo, was to allow the existing measures of governance to proceed according to pre-conquest custom, and to allow the mainly agricultural economy to continue to flourish. The land remained the property of the indigenous population, and the arrangements for taxation, so essential in the emergence of Islam because of the statutory amount that had to be sent back to the central coffers, followed very much those when Egypt had been under Byzantine rule. Always providing that the taxes were paid the indigenous population, particularly those who lived away from the urban centres, were able to pursue their lives unaffected by the changeover in political control. This was fundamentally akin to the practice adopted in the Iberian Peninsula some seventy years later. The subjection of the rest of North Africa was by no means straightforward. There were two principal obstacles to the progress of the Arab armies, the Byzantine coastal strongholds, including Carthage, and the disparate Berber tribes scattered throughout the western regions. In order to thwart the former, the Arabs built up a navy in the Mediterranean, recruited, it should be said, from the indigenous non-Arab populations of Egypt and Syria, which, as the century progressed, turned into a successful facility. It was the eventual construction of a shipyard near Carthage at the turn of the eighth century, where sufficient ships were built to negate the Byzantine threat, that secured Muslim control over the southern Mediterranean shoreline. The initiative to overcome Berber resistance was grasped by the enterprising governor, ‘Uqba b. Nāfi‘, who established his headquarters and military base at Qayrawān, in present-day Tunisia, in 670. From here, he launched his remarkable and spectacular expedition inland with a substantial army, eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean in present-day Morocco, in 683, before his death and the defeat of his troops by Berbers on the return journey to Qayrawān, which was occupied by Berbers for four years before being retaken by Arabs. Opposition to the Arab/Muslim presence was taken up by the formidable female prophet, Kāhina, whose rebellion eventually ended with her death in 700. At the head of Berber forces, she inflicted a notable and serious defeat on the Arabs, and at one stage controlled the entire province except the stronghold of Qayrawān itself. This period of uncertainty was brought to an end by the appointment, in 705, of Mūsā b. Nusayr as governor of Qayrawān.\n\nNotes 1. Leonard A. Curchin, Roman Spain.

He may be said to be one of four leading protagonists in the events of 711 and his role therefore deserves careful scrutiny. He figures prominently in Arabic histories and other sources, but they do not all coincide in the information that they provide. It is necessary to make a reasoned assessment. He was born in 640 and died in 714; he was therefore in his sixties when he was appointed to his post in Qayrawān. Before that, he had served with ‘Abd al-‘Azīz b. Marwān (d. 705), who was governor of Egypt for twenty years in the name of his brother, the Caliph ‘Abd al-Malik, and was entrusted with the command of the army and of territory beyond Egypt’s borders to the west stretching as far as the Atlantic Ocean. He was experienced as a military leader, as an administrator and, as governor of Africa (wālī Ifrīqiyya) was handed the responsibility of reclaiming lands that had been appropriated by Berbers. His campaigns were successful and, according to Arab sources, he sent large numbers of captives back to Egypt. On the accession to the Caliphate of Walīd in 705, Mūsā was appointed by him amīr, prince of Ifrīqiyya1 and of the Maghrib (‘the Western lands’ in Arabic, and the origin of the word Morocco), a promotion which is testimony of the high esteem in which he was held. His remit appears to have been threefold: to secure the terrain already conquered by Muslims, to subdue those Berbers that remained recalcitrant and, to this end, to maintain an army. The conquest and occupation of Tangier before 709 meant that his military objectives were accomplished. The command of Tangier and of the army of Muslims there was given to his client, the Berber convert Tāriq b. Ziyād, whilst he returned to his headquarters at Qairawān. This astute measure ensured that predominantly Berber troops were controlled by a Berber Muslim whose responsibility it was to govern the region and keep it pacified. Mūsā, meanwhile, established the law of Islam in his region. In practice, this entailed collecting taxes from subject peoples, payable by the rural population in kind, and by merchants in coinage. It has to be remembered that the nearby trading port of Carthage was only about 91 nautical miles (105 miles) from Sicily, the narrowest crossing point in the central Mediterranean. Carthage and Tangier were two of the Mediterranean termini of caravan routes that traversed the Sahara from central Africa, notably Timbuktu, bringing merchandise such as slaves and gold. The proximity of the Muslims\n\nThe invasion of the Iberian Peninsula 15\n\nwas not coincidental as it enabled them to control these all-important trade routes. Whilst Mūsā’s was a largely autonomous rule, he benefited from cordial relations with the Caliph Walīd, ‘Abd al-Malik’s successor, to whom he sent annually what is known as the ‘Caliphal fifth’, that is to say, a fifth of the revenue received during that period. This tended in reality to be booty from successful military expeditions. With the experience that he had earlier gleaned, he re­ cognised the need for campaigns to fulfil his obligations to the Caliph. Whether he authorised Tāriq to cross the narrow stretch of the Mediterranean that separated North Africa from the Iberian Peninsula may never be determined beyond doubt, but his later response to the success of the initial invasion indicates his interest, if not concern. The fact that he had entrusted the command of the army at Tangier to Tāriq is in line with the practice of the time, and any decision to deploy troops for a particular expedition could legitimately be made by his commander in the field. Tāriq, the second of the leading protagonists of the events of 711, was evidently a capable commander. By the time that he was in charge of the troops billeted at Tangier, much of the hinterland of present-day Morocco had been effectively subjugated. Several inferences may be drawn from this. The troops had the right to be paid the required stipend, and there was no immediate prospect of booty by leading them south towards present-day Mauretania and Senegal. There existed, then, a pressing need to ensure that the rank and file of the army were paid, in order to avoid potentially damaging unrest; the obvious direction to look was north, to the rock across the water and the land that lay beyond. The extent to which Tāriq was empowered to make his own decisions is by no means certain from the sources, but it could be argued that if Mūsā controlled the overall strategy, then he, Tāriq, took charge of tactics. Amongst the factors that might account for an invasion of the Peninsula at that time, two loom large. The first of these is that the land across the Straits was permanently visible, if not shrouded in mist. Knowing that traders, tribesmen, seamen and others were frequent travellers in that narrow stretch of water, he no doubt received reports, assuredly often garbled, of the land beyond, its fabled prosperity, its people, the nature of the terrain. Whether he took the initial steps to test the veracity of the accounts on his own initiative, having already communicated what he had heard to Mūsā in distant Qairawān, may never be known for certain. What the sources are agreed upon is that, no doubt on Tāriq’s instructions, a Berber, probably named Tarīf Abū Zur‘a, a mawlā of Mūsā (although there is conflicting information concerning his name and status), led a contingent into the Peninsula in the summer of 710. It was well equipped, with 100 horsemen supported by 400 infantry, and landed at a small coastal settlement later to be known as Tarifa, named after Tarīf. He would have deployed his cavalry westward on the flat terrain towards the present-day\n\n16 Muslim Spain reconsidered\n\nCape of Trafalgar, and perhaps inland to Medina Sidonia. Only foot soldiers could have negotiated the woods and hills that lay to the east and to the coast of the bay of Algeciras. It seems feasible to speculate that he identified this as an appropriate landing place for a larger body of troops. He returned with unspecified spoils and captives which were sent by Tāriq to Mūsā, as an indication of the successful reconnaissance. This second factor introduces the third of the protagonists, Julian. Under his Arabic name Ilyān, he figures prominently in the Arabic accounts. There is a profusion of information about him, although it is frequently conflicting; the task of compiling a narrative to which all would subscribe is therefore demanding if not unachievable. He is mentioned in sources relating to the year 682, that is to say nearly thirty years before the invasion, as having dealings with the Arab general ‘Uqba, when the latter had penetrated the Maghrib as far as Tangier. By the time that Tāriq had occupied Tangier, Julian would have acquired extensive knowledge of the region and its Berber inhabitants; he was most probably governor of nearby Ceuta and was a widely respected and experienced local overlord of considerable standing. He is described as a Christian, may well have belonged to the Visigothic nobility, and have been an appointee of the Visigothic state responsible for trade across the Straits. If this was so, then it is likely that he also had charge of Algeciras, which would explain the fact that he owned boats for the transportation of merchandise. It would have been politically prudent for Tāriq to have approached Julian, and to have agreed a pact with him in return for the payment of an unspecified tribute and for information concerning the situation in the Iberian Peninsula. These pacts or treaties were a feature of early Islam, and often gained concessions for indigenous communities if these accepted Muslim control without armed opposition. Another source states that Julian had recourse directly to Mūsā, Tāriq’s superior, offering perhaps even before the reconnaissance incursion of Tarīf in 710, to facilitate the Muslims’ advance into the Peninsula. In this case, Tarīf’s expedition could have been a ‘dry run’ for the ‘real thing’ the following year. The boats that Julian had at his command in Ceuta may well have been a crucial factor in the equation. If Mūsā did indeed authorise the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, having first consulted his friend and protector the Caliph Walīd, then the availability of appropriate means of the transportation of troops would certainly have been of paramount importance. If, on the other hand, Tāriq had a free hand to make such decisions, which seems a more probable circumstance, then his recognition of Julian’s potential as an ally both as a provider of transport for his army and as a guide to affairs in the Peninsula, might well have influenced his policy. Tāriq, then, determined to take the pragmatic step to invade, secure in the knowledge that he had to hand an accomplished and influential elder statesman, effectively exercising the function of mentor. The reasons why Julian elected to collaborate with the Muslims must be\n\nThe invasion of the Iberian Peninsula 17\n\nconsidered. Was he pursuing a vendetta towards the Visigoths and in particular their recently proclaimed king, Roderic? Arabic sources elaborate on personal reasons why Julian should have wanted to exact revenge on Roderic, but these all seem to be the stuff of a later legend. A more prosaic motive might lie in Julian’s earlier close ties with the previous Visigothic king, Witiza (sole ruler 700–10), and his feelings of anger and betrayal when the kingdom passed to Roderic who was not of the royal line, rather than to one of Witiza’s sons. However, although this seems to be a reasonable surmise, it is chronologically unsound, in that Julian made his treaty or pact with Mūsā in 709, the year prior to Witiza’s death. Purely political motivation still remains a possibility, but one has also to take into account Julian’s role as a trader and merchant with immense influence over the region of the Straits. Any disruption to trade would pose severe threats to his prosperity and prestige, and the civil war that ensued in the Peninsula after Roderic’s accession was clearly not propitious for trade. He would have been impressed by the organisational and administrative skills shown by the Muslims, Mūsā in his governance of the Maghrib, and Tāriq as commander of the army in Tangier. He perhaps shrewdly saw that the Muslims could restore the days of economic affluence that he had enjoyed for around twenty-five years, before the upheavals of 710. Julian’s behaviour may therefore be seen as akin to that of an estranged patriot with a desire to restore the Peninsula to its former stability. One may add that he was certainly unworried by any alliance with Muslims and did not see the religion of Islam as a threat to the well-being of his own Christian country. Roderic, the last Visigothic king, is the fourth of this quartet of protagonists. If Mūsā and Julian were political veterans, then Tāriq and Roderic were of the next generation, the latter perhaps only in his early twenties at the time of accession to the throne in 710. Later historians of Spain have denounced Roderic as a villain for having usurped the throne and reneged on his responsibilities as monarch, and for failing to repel the Muslim invaders. The reality may be otherwise. He was made king by election, one of the legitimate means by which the crown could be conferred among the Visigoths, an act not without precedent among his predecessors, and he had therefore not attained the throne illegally. Nonetheless, there was opposition to his appointment, notably from those who favoured dynastic accession (‘he seizes the crown amidst much discord with support of the seniores’).2 To have been chosen from amongst the nobility at such a young age demonstrates that Roderic was evidently regarded as someone with exceptional talent. He seems to have been accepted in most of the kingdom, notably in the south-east region which was the domain of Theodemirus. His priority certainly appears to have been securing the hegemony of the Visigothic state, as in 711 he was campaigning against the Basques, besieging Pamplona. He acted with the vigour and perhaps impetuosity of youth (‘young and full of adventure’).3 It was well observed by al-Maqqarī in the seventeenth century\n\n18 Muslim Spain reconsidered\n\nthat when Roderic was alerted by Theodemirus that the territory had been invaded, he, Roderic, ‘guessed directly that the blow had come from Ilyān’.4 This detail would seem to suggest that Roderic was previously aware of Julian as a noble of standing and prestige but now disaffected. Perhaps recognition of Julian’s involvement in the invasion led him to realise the gravity of the situation. Indeed, it is not implausible to speculate that Julian could have advised Tāriq to cross the Straits at a time when the young Visigothic king was known to be campaigning in the north with the army, leaving the southern approaches vulnerable to assault. The invasion of the Iberian Peninsula may have begun in April 711. The consensus from the sources is that around 12,000 troops commanded by Tāriq were transported from Ceuta, in ships owned by Julian that were normally assigned to carrying merchandise, to a landing spot in the Bay of Algeciras. Arabic sources mention that the Rock of Gibraltar is so named because Tāriq landed in its vicinity, jabal Tāriq (Tāriq’s mountain), but this seems to have been a later designation. Assuming that the number of ships was limited, perhaps to the four that Julian had at his disposal, then the operation could well have been transacted over a period of time, and over a sequence of nights. Two relevant observations here are, first, that the inhabitants of the southern coastline of the Peninsula would not be overly disturbed when Julian’s merchant vessels landed, as these would have been seen frequently during the previous twenty years plying their trade across the Straits; second, the disembarkation of troops of bodies of armed men is less likely to have caused consternation at nighttime. The alarm would only have been raised when this large army, encamped in situ, was not dispersing and returning with the ships to North Africa. The details in the sources concerning the composition of the troops who crossed into the Iberian Peninsula coincide in specifying Berbers as the chief constituent elements. It cannot therefore be any longer sustained that this was an Arab invasion, as Arabs formed little or no part of the invading force. There may perhaps have been a small handful of Arabs present as representatives of Mūsā. An intriguing detail is the mention, in some sources, of blacks (sūdān), varying from a small number to several hundred. These are unlikely to have been slaves, for they would have been named as such, and, furthermore, slaves without any fighting capacity would hinder rather than contribute to the exercise. The sūdān are more likely to have been involved in trading enterprises, there perhaps at Julian’s instigation as observers, to determine the potential for trade. The identification of the invading Berbers is a major undertaking in that assumptions have been made about them that should not be taken at face value. The fundamental point de départ for what follows is that the word Berber (barbar) is an umbrella term, used to describe the inhabitants of North Africa mainly those to the west of Mūsā’s headquarters in Qairawān, the Maghrib. These inhabitants were the Latin barbari, following a designation given by the Romans to the\n\nThe invasion of the Iberian Peninsula 19\n\nindigenous population of North Africa who could not speak Latin. The Arabs would have taken over this word in the seventh century but, by this time, the population would have incorporated other peoples, notably the Vandals who had settled there in large numbers in the fifth century. There existed a large number of Berber tribal groups or peoples, who spoke languages that were not mutually intelligible. One such group comprised the largely sedentary barānis from the Arabic barnis (cloak with hood), and at the time of the invasion, many of them were located in the north of present-day Morocco. A further significant group were the butr, some of whose constituent tribes were nomadic, moving their herds from place to place in quest of pasture. The Berbers, then, comprised disparate groups spread over a wide area of western North Africa who, apparently, at the time of the invasion, had the common denominator of being Muslim. It is true that from Ibn Idhārī, an important late-thirteenth-century writer, it is ascertained that the cessation of hostilities came at the cost of accepting Islam. This meant, in effect, that those engaged in the negotiations, leaders of tribes and communities became clients of the Muslims (mawālī), adopting Arabic names. The rest, the vast majority, continued their traditional lifestyle regardless of any agreements undertaken by those in authority, and perpetuating their own customs and beliefs. It may be argued that the absorption of perhaps tens of thousands of Vandals in the sixth century provides an important clue for the understanding of what happened in the Iberian Peninsula in the immediate aftermath of the invasion nearly two centuries later, particularly if these Vandals were primarily Latin-speaking. Descendants of those Vandals who made such an impact in North Africa in the fifth and sixth centuries may well have participated in the Berber army of invasion alongside nomadic herdsmen with their familiarity with horses, warriors from the mountainous zones of North Africa and tribesmen-turnedsoldiers who no doubt anticipated plunder on a hitherto unimagined scale. If the crossing of Tāriq’s troops occurred in April 711, and if the confrontation with Roderic’s forces took place in July that year at a site not too far distant from the landing spot, then one needs to ask why this inactivity on Tāriq’s part? There is no consensus as to the site of the decisive battle, although there is a predominance in favour of one adjacent to the river Guadalete, whilst a site near the lagoon of La Janda by the river Barbate is also a possibility. The latter is closer to Tāriq’s landing, but may well have been marshy and therefore not an ideal location for a battle. A feasible explanation of the eventual whereabouts of the battle is that Tāriq acted on Julian’s advice. It made strategic sense not to stray too far from his landing site and take refuge, if necessary, on the other side of the Straits. Against this is the testimony of Ibn al-Kardabūs, the twelfthcentury writer who stated that Tāriq ordered his boats to be burnt to give added incentive to his troops, but this seems unlikely, particularly if the boats belonged to Julian.5 It also showed sound judgment to proceed westward, away\n\n20 Muslim Spain reconsidered\n\nfrom the sierras that lay to the east, and en route for the famed city of Seville. The Muslims stayed put in a propitious place of their own choosing, awaiting the Visigothic response. If the engagement with Roderic took place in July, then there must have been some frustration amongst the troops over the three months of inaction. On the other hand, Tāriq may have been productively involved in negotiations during this period. It should also be mentioned that, according to another interpretation, the invasion and decisive encounter took place near Cartagena, a couple of hundred miles along the east coast, between Almería and Alicante, but this reading of the source material, though alluring, has not attracted widespread acceptance.6 Common to many of the Arab accounts is the role played by treaties. One, in particular, the text of which has not survived, seems to have had great significance. Ibn al-Qūtīya, a fundamental tenth-century source, drawing on reputable informants and oral information, refers to an agreement made between the sons of Witiza and Tāriq. These three sons of Witiza, still youths, may well have considered Roderic to have usurped the throne to which, in their opinion, one of them was rightly entitled. They were therefore aggrieved and, according to Ibn al-Qūtīya, consented to betray Roderic on the night of the battle, in return for the confirmation of their entitlement to 3,000 estates in al-Andalus. There are no specific details as to the actual dates of the meeting, and one may speculate that preliminary negotiations, at least, took place in the summer months prior to Roderic’s arrival on the battlefield. At some stage, the sons sought ratification of the agreement both from Mūsā in Qairawān and from the Caliph himself in Damascus. Walīd is said to have provided a document for each of them, corroborating the arrangement with Tāriq. As the journey from the Iberian Peninsula to Damascus is unlikely to have been undertaken in a short period of time, it makes sense to assume that Witiza’s sons probably did not go the Middle East until after the decisive battle. Indeed, it has been suggested that if they went at all, then it was among the triumphal cortège of Mūsā on his recall to Damascus.7 If Ibn al-Qūtīya’s testimony is to be relied upon, then it indicates that the Caliph was au fait with affairs in al-Andalus and, indeed, that he regarded the affirmation of rights to coalescent members of the deposed regime to be essential in the transfer of power to Islam. It in no way suggests that he authorised the invasion, through the intermediary of his governor Mūsā, nor that the latter instructed Tāriq. In respect of the battle itself, the Muslim army may have numbered around 12,000, but there is simply no agreement as to the size of Roderic’s force. What can be determined is that sections of his battle line, probably the flanks, were composed of troops led by contingents in support of the cause of the sons of Witiza. On his expedition south in the summer of 711, he may have communicated with delegates of his political opponents, persuading them to join him in the common cause of repelling the invaders. If there was a night-time meeting\n\nThe invasion of the Iberian Peninsula 21\n\nbetween the sons of Witiza and Tāriq during the course for the battle, that may have spread over seven days, then the former must have thought that that this was a heaven-sent opportunity to rid the country of their rival. It follows that they may well have believed that Tāriq’s mission was solely for booty, and that he and his troops would return to North Africa once this was accomplished. When Roderic was deprived of both flanks at a crucial stage of the battle, he was no doubt far outnumbered by his adversaries, and defeat was inevitable. There was plentiful booty to be had by the Muslims after the victory, but it was divided, again according to al-Maqqarī, among 9,000, indicating that a quarter of Tāriq’s troops perished. The Visigothic losses are not known, but certain noblemen took refuge, no doubt with their paid troops and retinue, in various cities in the south. When the Muslims started to move up country, reinforced with up to 5,000 new arrivals from across the Straits, it would have become apparent to the Visigoths that the Muslims, far from satisfied with their initial gains, intended conquest and, with it, inevitable settlement. The Visigothic state had fallen, and another era in the history of the Iberian Peninsula had begun.\n\nThe eighth century: settlement and adjustment Whether Tāriq was guided by Julian or whether he employed the use of local guides, he veered north and away from the obvious target of Seville, famed Roman port on the river Guadalquivir. His objective was the town of Écija, perhaps because he had information that some of his enemies, survivors of the initial battle, had fortified themselves there, or perhaps because of its strategic importance, as it lay on the Roman road between Seville and Cordoba, and had a road from it leading north to the centre of the Peninsula. Its fortifications comprised two solidly built ramparts, an inner and an outer one.8 After a siege and a battle in which the Muslims suffered many dead and wounded, according to the Akhbār Majmū‘a, in sufficiently notable numbers to be commented upon by a number of sources, the defenders were defeated.9 Al-Maqqarī appends an anecdote to his brief account, mentioning a secret pact that was made with the governor of the town, whereby if hostilities ceased, the remaining inhabitants would be spared further strife and, subject to the statutory tribute being paid, they could live in peace.10 Similar terms of submission were common practice as the Muslims made their way into the interior of the Peninsula, but this may be a later embellishment, inserted in order to call attention to the fact that the procedure of surrender on terms was a feature of Muslim practice in their early campaigns. On the other hand, there are a number of texts for the treaty (‘ahd), made between ‘Abd al-‘Azīz and Tudmīr in the spring of 713, which may be regarded as a testimony of procedures. There are various extant versions of this treaty, which echo those employed in other regions of the Islamic world. The treaty itself has been extensively studied in part because the terms agreed upon\n\n22 Muslim Spain reconsidered\n\nsuggest that, at least in one particular area of the Iberian Peninsula, the Muslims intended a permanent presence. Tudmīr is covered by a covenant or pact which Allah guarantees neither he nor any of his companions can set aside. He will not be deposed from his position of authority, nor shall either he or they be killed or reduced to slavery, nor separated from their wives and children. They (the beneficiaries of the pact) should not be forced against their inclinations in the matter of religion. Their temples will not be burnt; neither will objects of value (sacred objects, perhaps crosses) be removed from them (ad-Dabbī has mulk (realm), and this would suggest that this specification applied to whatever kind of shrine in whatever location).11 This treaty relates to seven named cities which are to be ceded to the Muslims. These cities cannot all be identified with certainty but they extend from Alicante to Lorca, themselves about 100 miles from each other, and include Orihuela and Mula. It is also specified that Tudmīr himself is responsible for the continued observation of the terms of the treaty. Furthermore, he will not harbour any refugee or enemy of the Muslims; neither will he harm anyone under their protection. He must not withhold any information that he should hear about their enemies. In return for these conditions, he and his companions must pay the annual jizya, comprising one dinar (of gold), four bushels (amdād, measures) of wheat, four of barley, four measures of must (grape juice before fermentation), one of honey and one of olive oil. Each farmer, settler or slave should pay half this amount. The reference to slaves (al-‘abīd) testifies to an existing distinction within society; the category of ‘slaves’ may have comprised those who did not enjoy the privileges of the Visigothic caste, and therefore include those engaged in agricultural or pastoral pursuits. One is tempted to make the conjecture that there was an urban payment and a rural payment; the gold dinar would form the payment made by city dwellers whereas the other items, which seem more patently associated with the countryside, would constitute the tax burden on the rural communities. There follows a list of Arab names, witnesses to the document. It may be ascertained from the terms of this treaty which do not coincide in every version that Tudmīr was a man of standing in the Levant of the Peninsula, a former Visigothic nobleman with ascendancy over extensive domain, sufficiently important for ‘Abd al-‘Azīz, Mūsā’s son, to negotiate with in person. The payment of the jizya allowed the existing economic structure to continue to function. Taxes had been paid under the previous regime, and for the rural communities these fiscal demands did not represent any change from time immemorial. They had no say in the matter. Indeed, there is a further argument here, in that they had endured restrictive practices that had adversely affected their trade since the middle of the seventh century, and which had come close to throttling it entirely after the Council of the Church in Toledo in 694. Produce of whatever kind needed to be sold at specific times of the year, and sanctions against those who were engaged in this trade, notably the Jewish middlemen,\n\nThe invasion of the Iberian Peninsula 23\n\nwould have had a deleterious knock-on effect. The south-east of the Iberian Peninsula is where they seem to have been particularly active, and it was here that they were reckoned to pose the greatest threat, perhaps going so far as conspiring to form their own state. Even rumours of this would have been sufficient to justify Egica persuading the bishops to confiscate their property, to deprive them of their homes and to reduce them to slavery. These savage measures may not have been enacted upon, at least not in every part of the Peninsula, but their impact would have been felt by many rural communities who had relied on the Jewish intermediaries to dispose of their products. When, under the new administrative regime, sanctions against the Jewish communities were abolished, they would have found themselves free to trade as their ancestors had done and, in the light of this, the new system of taxation to which Tudmīr had subscribed was barely more than an acceptable annual inconvenience. One may further deduce from the terms of the treaty that it was essentially an urban pact. In return for the pacific transfer of authority of strategic cities, Christians and Jews could go on practising their religions unmolested in their churches and synagogues. Thus, they enjoyed the status of ahl adh-dhimma, which afforded them protection within Islam. Theoretically, this also applied to Tudmīr’s rural subjects. I say theoretically because there is scant, if any, evidence of the religion that they practised. The sites of very few churches have been located in rural areas in what constituted al-Andalus. One has testimony of Bobastro in the Province of Málaga in the ninth century and of Santa María de Melque in the region of Toledo, but apart from these two, evidence for the existence of others is not, to date, forthcoming.12 As churches up until the eleventh century were protected for those with dhimma status, it seems unlikely that there was any systematic demolition of them. There may be an argument that churches fell into disuse through neglect, ‘because of the changing demographic patterns subsequent to the Islamicization of al-Andalus in later centuries’, but the more reasonable alternative is that they did not exist in the first place and that, in consequence, Christianity was not firmly implanted in areas away from urban centres.13 What was in place were local beliefs based on traditional lore, superstitions and age-old cults. This claim is at the heart of the fundamental assumption that the most significant distinction in al-Andalus from the beginning of the eighth century until the tenth century was between town and country, urban and rural. A picture can be built up of the nature of existence in the cities of al-Andalus under Islam, but only an outline may be glimpsed of the circumstances of the majority of the population, those who lived in the rural areas. In sum, then, this treaty would seem to demonstrate that peaceful submission brought with it immediate entry into the category of dhimmī for the indigenous communities both urban and rural. Where a formal religion, Judaism or Christianity, pre-existed, that is to say in urban environments, this was allowed\n\n24 Muslim Spain reconsidered\n\nto persist. Elsewhere, the rural economy was encouraged to prosper, without any further interference than the annual visitations by the tax gatherers. In the cities, the signs of Islam would soon become evident, but elsewhere, the indigenous population would have been largely unconscious of the change in regime. They would have been aware of an improvement in their commercial transactions now that the sanctions on the Jewish communities had been removed, but any knowledge of the growth of an Islamic state would have passed them by. For around 200 years, until the emergence of the Umayyad Caliphate in Cordoba in the first half of the tenth century, the majority of the population within the Iberian Peninsula, that is to say those who lived in rural areas, would have been almost wholly unaffected by Islam.\n\nUrban Islam It is natural to consider first how Islam became established in the cities of alAndalus, as most of the available documentation, both Arabic and Latin, relates in an unvarnished manner to city dwellers. The principal city in the Visigothic state was Toledo, situated as it was more or less in the centre of the Peninsula, and it is therefore no surprise that Tāriq, after his victory over Roderic, should set his sights on Toledo, prompted to do so perhaps by Julian, and perhaps by tales of the untold wealth that was to be found there. In 712, Tāriq occupied the city, abandoned by its inhabitants according to some Arabic accounts, most likely members of the former Visigothic nobility, whither he was followed by Mūsā who had moved his retinue of around ten thousand Arabs from Qairawān to the Peninsula. This significant act of moving the governorship of his province further west was an indication that a permanent Muslim presence was intended. The Muslims, contrary to what those Visigothic nobles who had collaborated with the venture in the previous year had anticipated, were planning to settle there in anticipation of the establishment of a Muslim state. Envy is mentioned as a motive for Mūsā’s entry in a number of Arabic sources: envy of what Tāriq had achieved in such a short period of time, and fear on Mūsā’s part that if the Caliph al-Walīd should hear of the success of the conquest, he would be replaced by Tāriq;14 but stories of untold wealth, described in great detail in the sources, may also have acted as an incentive. It also does well to recognise that the procedure prosecuted by Mūsā echoed a pattern that had held good for the Arabs since the early expansion of the Islamic Empire. His incursion into the Peninsula brought Arabs in conflict with non-Arab Muslims, notably the Berbers, one of many sources of conflict that was to blight al-Andalus. By the time the two protagonists met, the main inland cities in the south of the Peninsula had been captured by Muslims, and much of the northern sector was in the process of subjugation. If the stories recounted in Arabic histories that Toledo possessed fabulous wealth are well founded, then the riches which\n\nThe invasion of the Iberian Peninsula 25\n\nMūsā took back with him to Damascus in 714 could have originated from here. In any event he met with Tāriq, if not in Toledo itself then en route for that city, perhaps near Talavera, as he had come from Mérida, which he had captured. A number of Arabic sources, independent of one another, relate that Tāriq came to meet Mūsā, as a subordinate officer might greet his commander-in-chief. Some say that Mūsā struck him on the head with a whip,15 from which one may infer that he was demonstrating to those in his retinue that he was now master of what had turned into the conquest. He would furthermore have asserted, with this gesture, that he, an Arab, was in command, as opposed to Tāriq, a Berber mawlā. It is equally plausible that Mūsā should want to appropriate and secure whatever treasure there was in Toledo, before moving on to further conquests. Toledo was a well fortified city, remarkable for the strength and height of its ramparts, situated on the river Tagus with its famous bridge. Writing much later, an Arab geographer commented upon its dominant position visà-vis its environs; how it was encircled by gardens, irrigated by water channels and orchards; of ancient foundation, already constructed when the Romans arrived.16 In short, it was a prestigious city in a central location, an ideal choice, one would have thought, as capital of the newly conquered territory. Yet, Mūsā’s interest in Toledo appears to have been singularly mercenary. Once he had taken Tāriq with him to Toledo and had been shown the bejewelled table, probably a legendary embellishment which is nonetheless celebrated in such extravagant terms in the Arabic sources, he appears to have been reconciled with Tāriq, reinstating him; with combined armies, they proceeded to campaign together. Toledo was then plundered, and the property assembled by the Visigoths presumably conveyed by the rearguard of his army further north. There is no mention of the land being devastated, so the economy of the region was unaffected, or at least not adversely affected, suggesting that the city could be considered as a possible location for an Arab settlement once the conquests had been concluded. Their route from Toledo would have been initially to the north-west to join the main Roman road that traversed the centre of the Peninsula from Mérida to Saragossa, passing through the old Roman town of Sigüenza (Seguntia), before arriving at Saragossa, then still a navigable inland port on the river Ebro. As was the case with the Muslim occupation of Toledo by Tāriq, there appears not to have been any armed resistance on the part of its inhabitants to the inexorable passage of Mūsā and his troops through the Peninsula. Now Saragossa was a larger city than Toledo, laid out on a rectangular grid with four gates in Roman times and had been essential to the maintenance of Roman power in the north.17 It was situated in the fertile Ebro valley, was at the junction of the Roman road communication network and was evidently a strategic base for future forays north. In his overview of Saragossa, written during the fifteenth century, al-Himyarī was quite clearly impressed by what he had read and what\n\n26 Muslim Spain reconsidered\n\nhe had heard of the ‘White City’, named because of the profusion of white marble. The mosque was founded before 718, therefore signifying the city’s importance to the recently arrived Muslims.18 It was about a month’s distance from Cordoba, was very much self-sufficient and thrived in circumstances that clearly lent themselves to political independence. It seems, though, that the destiny of the Arabs in the Peninsula lay with the Caliph in Damascus, as Mūsā was recalled in 714 to give an account of his conquests. By the time of his departure, delayed partly to ensure that the major portion of what had formerly been the Visigothic kingdom was under Muslim control and partly, perhaps, because he was apprehensive about the reception that awaited him on his return, the remnants of the Visigothic nobility would have been aware that the Muslims were intending to consolidate their presence in the Peninsula through settlement. A detail from al-Maqqarī reveals that some of Mūsā’s army ‘preferred remaining in the towns where they had settled and fixed their domicile’ to making the long trek back to Damascus.19 These urban dwellers would have been Arabs, marking in effect the beginning of a permanent Arab Islamic presence in the Peninsula. Initially, the new governor, ‘Abd al-‘Azīz, a son of Mūsā, left in charge of al-Andalus by his father, made his residence in Seville. The reasons for this choice of location may be readily deduced. Not only was this populous city located on the navigable river Guadalquivir, near to the sea ‘and to that part of the coast where the troops coming from Africa usually landed’,20 but it was prosperous and set within a fertile zone. Seville had been the Roman Hispalis, well known for its trade in olive oil which, even as late as the fifteenth century, was recognised by al-Himyarī for its superior quality. Although there were more churches in Cordoba and Toledo, Seville was the metropolitan city of the Peninsula, with two, perhaps three, churches testified as being in existence at that time.21 One of these may have been the church dedicated to the saints Justa y Rufina, martyred in 287 ad, next to which ‘Abd al-‘Azīz is said to have had constructed a small mosque. This point may have added significance when one takes into reckoning the marriage of ‘Abd al-‘Azīz to Egilona, in the Arabic texts Aīla, the widow of Roderic. There is no unanimity in the sources about the relationship of this person to the last Visigothic king, but what is significant is the intermarriage with a member of the indigenous population. It may be regarded as a political union, one of mutual benefit: for ‘Abd al-‘Azīz, the tie with the former royal line and the consequent hamstringing of dynastic opposition from the defeated regime; and for Egilona, power and influence, taking on an Arabic name in recognition of her position. The sources reveal that ‘Abd al-‘Azīz was an able governor who deployed his troops in various parts of the Peninsula, including Galicia, Navarra and Aragón, without actually being present in the field. Whilst dwelling in the city, he improved the infrastructure there by causing to be built ‘casas mui buenas et mui ricas’.22 Furthermore, they make it absolutely apparent that there\n\nThe invasion of the Iberian Peninsula 27\n\nwas opposition to him personally, culminating in his assassination in his mosque in 716 at the hands of an Arab, one of those who chose to remain behind after Mūsā’s departure, after he had been in sole charge of the Islamic state in the Iberian Peninsula for about two years. Reasons for this hostility are given, but they are by no means uniform. The obvious one is that under the influence of his wife, he was in the throes of denying Islam and becoming an apostate. This is baldly stated in ar-Rāzī’s chronicle: ‘se apartaron todos á fablar entre si, et dixeron que se tornara christiano, et obieron consejo que lo matassen’.23 This presumed apostasy would have been understandably resented by Arabs of standing, but as he was at prayer in the mosque at the time of his killing, this seems an unlikely motive. A different motive is propounded in the Chronicle of 754 whose author alleged that ‘Abd al-‘Azīz presumed to throw the Arab yoke off his neck and to hold on to the invaded kingdom of Iberia for himself.24 This is a cogent alternative but the assumption that the Caliph Sulaymān ordered his death from Damascus because he intended to rebel has to remain uncorroborated. In his brief tenure of the office of governor, ‘Abd al-‘Azīz had consolidated Islamic presence in the Peninsula, exte"
