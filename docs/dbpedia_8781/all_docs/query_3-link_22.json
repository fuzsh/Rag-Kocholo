        "text": "ARJONA'S VOYAGE TOUR IS US-BOUND!\n\nGuatemalan singer Arjona has won two Grammy Awards and now brings his Circo Soledad tour to the US/Canada markets, in what is anticipated to be one of the biggest Latin musical concert tours in 2017. This is one Latin hero that we'd travel anywhere for!\n\nMUSICAL STYLE\n\nArjona's music covers an extensive range including ballads, Latin pop, rock, pop rock and even Cuban music. More recently he has branched out into a cappella performances and a mixture of Tejano music and Norteno music, combining these with Afro-American and Latin sounds. Whilst noted for his lyrical style, his songs and activism often addresses topics such as love, sexuality, violence, racism and immigration, which has garnered him a huge following in Latin America, and now the States and Canada."
