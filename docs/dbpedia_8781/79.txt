The Taifa of Arjona (Arabic: طائفة أرخونة) was a medieval Islamic taifa Moorish kingdom of Al-Andalus that ruled from 1232 to 1244. It followed Almohad Caliphate control of the area, and was superseded by the Christian Kingdom of Castile rule. The Taifa was ruled by the Arab tribe of Banu Khazraj which had its origin in the Hejaz region of Arabia.

Its capital was in Arjona, which is in the present day Province of Jaén, in Andalusia, southern Spain.
