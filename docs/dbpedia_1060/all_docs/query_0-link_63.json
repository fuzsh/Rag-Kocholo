Today, we are all here to discuss this small but important line,” said ARUN C RAO, Founder- ASLI.\n\nThroughout the day, we heard some amazing stories, learned about the best practices in companies and experienced how technology can help create inclusive spaces.\n\nDivyanand Raj showed us how we can make a difference by being ‘inclusive’ and ‘responsive’ in companies. Sangeetha Gera spoke about SGGSC India introducing 250 words in sign language that are specific to the world of finance. Tarun Sarwal demonstrated the SignAble app and how it helps the deaf and hearing communicate easily with each other.\n\nAs Mohan Sundaram said, “Lack of communication has resulted in lack of opportunities. My dream is that one day we have a deaf CEO and the hearing make the effort to communicate with them.”\n\n\"They wanted me to sit at the back, but I went and took a seat right in front,\" said Rupmani Chhetri.\n\nWhether it was Rupmani Chhetri’s determination to be a part of the UN or Priti Soni’s focus to create awareness about the challenges faced by the deaf, we were given a glimpse into how the deaf can do anything provided they are given a chance. A. S. Narayanan President, National Association of the Deaf was unfortunately ill and could not attend but was ably represented by the General Secretary of National Association of the Deaf Mr Saju Stephen.\n\nMr. Saju highlighted the issues faced by deaf across India in terms of access. “Access to education is where it starts, we don’t have any access to education” he said shocking the crowd. “When we are denied the basic rights of education is it any wonder that our other rights are trampled over and denied? It goes to show how important this conference is and thank you all for highlighting it.”\n\nIn Rashmi Vikram’s words, the journey to create accessible workplaces is possible only if all are willing to take a step.\n\nThank you, Nidhi Bhasin, Roy C Thomas, Rashmi Vikram, and ARUN C RAO, for starting the conference off today.\n\nThank you, Saju Stephen, Rupmani Chhetri, Priti Soni and Leon Dsouza for sharing those wonderful stories!\n\nWe thank you all for being a part of our one-day conference on 𝗘𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗲𝗮𝗳 𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲: 𝗔𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲!

Narayanan, President, NAD; Mr. Anuj Jain, Joint Secretary and Mr. Vishal Arora, Treasurer met Mr. Shinan PS, who is a deaf bike rider from Thrissur, Kerala, on 14th August 2017 at the India Habitat Centre, Lodhi Road, New Delhi.\n\nMr. Narayanan asked him a few questions while there were other people gathered there watching the interview unfold.\n\nFirst question put up to him was, “Does he have a driving license and what’s his goal for the journey?” He did indeed have a driving license but it wasn’t easy to get it as the licensing authority rejected him because he was deaf the first time he went to get the license. He added that, “Hearing people have so many opportunities and I would look at that and think how I can also do the same. Then the thought struck me that yes a deaf person like me can also ride the bike, travel this far and break every barrier. Both the deaf and hearing communities should be equal on the same level.”\n\nMr. Shinan PS told him that he started his journey with a hearing bikers group from Kerala and his first stop was Goa. From Goa he rode alone by himself to Pune then Mumbai. In Mumbai, NIHH felicitated him. They were impressed to see a deaf biker. A few people in Mumbai supported me and made me part of their club. In Nasik, their deaf association supported me and provided place to stay. Then I went to Vadodara in Gujrat. I interacted with the people and got their support too. In Ahmedabad, I met a lot of deaf people and it was fun. I got donation from a few individuals there. Later went to Udaipur in Rajasthan. I met the deaf people and they were surprised and impressed at the same time to meet me. I also received govt. recognized certificate. In Jaipur, we got pictures clicked and my name was in the print news. From there I went to Agra and finally arrived here in Delhi.”\n\nMr. Narayanan then told the audience, “Wonderful, thank you. You all must not think that this much travelling on bike is easy. It is quite hard. Food, fuel and other expenses are there. If I was in his place managing all that won’t be possible for me. So, it is very commendable and brave of him. I request you all let’s come together and support him, sharing a one time donation.”\n\nMrs. Reena Jain, NAD’s North India Deaf Women Committee, asked a question on how he manages all the expenses, to which Mr. Shinan answered,” I welcome any kind of donations and also happily accept invitations to stay the night to sleep. At one place I was hanging out with the deaf group and they said we will pay for your food.”\n\nMr. Shinan had a glass cutting business which he managed himself but left it 2 months ago when he embarked on this journey. People would stop him and get pictures clicked with him and meeting deaf people from different states also extended his time.\n\nNAD Treasurer, Mr. Vishal Arora asked the people there that who would like to join him and ride like him to which there were a few hands raised interested for the same!\n\nMr. Anuj Jain, Joint Secretary, NAD told that, “So as you go ahead in your journey and finish it safely without accident, we will make a proof report and present it to the Ministry of Road and Transport of India and show them that a deaf person can drive and ride and hopefully the government passes law to give driving license to the deaf.”\n\nNext he travels to Kashmir then Nepal to Bhutan to Assam to Kolkata to Orissa to Hyderabad to and finally back to his hometown Thrissur, Kerala. He feels safe and confident going ahead and in case of any trouble he has hearing friends and Whatsapp group of bike riders. He’s careful and follows a strict time rule too. Morning 6am to evening 6pm only.\n\nWhen asked about has the police ever stopped him, he said that yes just once in Mumbai but he showed the blue sign which says the driver is deaf and police let him go, no other happening like that.\n\nMr. Narayanan concluded, “That’s sweet and beautiful he has that sign board on the bike, travelling all over India.” And everyone went for a group photo session.\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nThe Week Health Magazine\n\nIndia on 30th August 2015\n\nLink:- http://www.theweek.in/health/cover/indias-sign-language-is-crying-for-recognition.html\n\nCOVER STORY\n\nListen...\n\nBy Mandira Nayar| August 30, 2015\n\nMillions of hearing-impaired Indians fail to communicate for want of a fully-evolved vocabulary of their own. India's sign language is crying for recognition\n\n\"The idea of signing to communicate in public was forbidden. If I ever tried to talk to them [parents] outside, they used to hold my hands. I was taught that signing was somehow shameful\"- Anuj Jain, who is part of the National Association of the Deaf\n\nA.S. Narayanan has never had a conversation with his family. He spent the first 15 years of his life in silence. Narayanan is like over a million Indians who are defined by their inability to hear. But if you are hearing impaired in India—it is worse than children of a lesser god that all differently-abled are lumped in with—the discrimination is a little more fundamental: it is the denial of a language.\n\nStanding in front of the flea market lane of Janpath at Connaught Place in Delhi, Narayanan, much older now, laughs. “I grew up alone,’’ he says. “At most, they would ask me if I had eaten. Or, if I was okay? I brought myself up.’’ Surabhi, a student of Jamia Millia Islamia, is his translator. Signing came naturally to her. “It was the first language I learnt,’’ she says. “My parents are deaf. I learnt English later.”\n\nIt was years later that the idea of conversation, even communication that wasn’t just functional, came into being for Narayanan. He is now the office-bearer of the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) in India and is off to Chandigarh for the weekend to hold a workshop on training with young students. It has become easier to communicate with cellphones and computers, but the language is still borrowed.\n\nSo far, the Indian sign language is still at a nascent stage. “There are millions of words in a language. In India, we only have a few thousands,” says Narayanan. “The language has not even evolved.” The Indian sign language comprises rudimentary signs, mostly instinctive, but it is far from the codified recognised language like the American sign language.\n\nFor the past few months, the NAD has been advocating for an autonomous Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre. The idea is to explore, expand and foster the Indian sign language. This centre was allotted in the 11th Five-Year Plan but is yet to see the light of day. The project was moved to the Indira Gandhi National Open University. Eighteen months ago the government chose to move the centre from IGNOU to the Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of the Hearing Handicapped. This, as one activist from NAD put it, is like “asking a wolf to raise a lamb’’. The institute believes in an oral approach to deaf education, virtually denying the deaf a chance to build a language that is rooted in their own culture.\n\nThe idea that the deaf need a separate language is alien in India. Instead, children are discouraged from signing. Anuj Jain, who is also part of NAD, grew up with his four sisters who were all deaf. His fifth sibling, a sister, is not. “She used to feel left out,’’ he says, laughing. “We would have these conversations and she couldn’t keep up.’’\n\nA bond Beyond words: Anuj Jain with his daughter Ananta | Arvind Jain\n\nChildren who are born deaf are still ‘taught’ how to speak. They are given hearing aids to amplify the sound. Geeta Sharma remembers being forced to speak as a child. She spent years being shuttled from school to school. “The approach was oral,’’ she says. “They tried to get me to talk.” Forcing children to talk and hear isn’t unusual. Sharma is in her 40s. But even now, this is standard practice.\n\nThe Lady Noyce School is one of the biggest institutions for the hearing impaired in Delhi. There are 600 students who flock into the cramped classrooms to learn. At the centre of the school is a courtyard. This, open-to-the-sky bit of paved brick, is probably the biggest space the children have. Once there was a cricket field, now the social welfare department occupies most of the area. Kids here spend years learning how to read and write. Knowing the sign language is not compulsory for the teachers. It is something that they pick up. The hearing impaired kids, of course, have to learn how to speak.\n\nIt is not unusual. Teachers in deaf schools are not trained in the sign language. Nor is it considered essential. There is a brief orientation of a day or so on sign language. For the most part, the idea is to integrate the kids and teach them, but in a language—English or Hindi—that is not their own. Nor are hearing impaired teachers hired to teach. The idea that sign language can exist even in the hearing world does not exist.\n\nThe emphasis, for four years, is on preparing the kids to learn how to speak or communicate in the same way as is done in the hearing world. “They want to fit cochlear implants so that we could hear,” says Narayanan. “We are deaf. This is not communication.’’ It is like forcing a left-handed person to write with his right hand. A bit medieval and cruel.\n\nFor women, being hearing impaired means literally being invisible. “Girls are often never allowed to leave home,’’ says Sharma. “They have no opportunities and no one to communicate with. Imagine a life where there is no entertainment, no conversation, nothing.”\n\nHands-on Approach: A class in progress at Lady Noyce school, Delhi | Arvind Jain\n\nTechnology has brought in a revolution. The cell-phone and the internet has made the world a smaller place and for the deaf it has brought with it the gift of communication. Text, Facetime, Skype chats, Hike, video chats have made it possible for the sound barrier to be breached. Meeting people who don't know sign language, asking for directions, even talking with each other has become possible. “I remember when I used to get a phone call from a friend,’’ says Anuj. “My sister would pick up the phone and seem to speak for ages. When I would ask what the other person said, she would always give me just the gist. I would think why she would talk for so long when the answer was monosyllabic,’’ he laughs.\n\nOver the years, Ananta, his daughter has become the voice he never had. Jain remembers the time when his parents spent a year trying to clap loudly to get his daughter’s attention. “They were convinced she was deaf,’’ says Jain. “She would never react when they clapped their hands. But when she turned one, she started talking. Then they knew,’’ he laughs. His son, a toddler, is also learning the language.\n\nRaising a voice: A.S. Narayanan with his translator Surabhi | Arvind Jain\n\nAnanta can speak the sign language fluently. It came easily to her. Even now when Jain's sister visits, she is the outsider, for she hasn’t learnt the sign language yet. “She communicates through me,” says Ananta. \"She will call and ask me to pass on a message to my father.\"\n\nThe idea of signing to communicate in public was forbidden, says Ananta, translating for her father: “If I ever tried to talk to them [parents] outside, they used to hold my hands. I was taught that signing was somehow shameful.’’ He apparently retorted in sign that they should then ask the people who can hear to never speak.\n\nSitting in McDonald’s in Janpath, the father-daughter duo is having an animated conversation. Things have changed. In several countries today, the sign language has gained legal recognition, but in India, it is still not recognised as anything but a few gestures for the hearing impaired to communicate.\n\nIt isn’t a language. It needs to be. Language is much more than just communication. It is about being heard; about laughter; about the triviality of life; it is about poetry; it is about anger; fear; joy; disappointment and the shades in between. Even blue has more colour in other languages. Growing up as a hearing impaired person in India, where 18 million people are still waiting to talk, it is more than just about being mute, it is being deprived of expression—forever.\n\nDocuments\n\nDownload Sr. Topic Description File Type / Size 1 The Week Health Magazine India PDF / (1.21 MB)\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nMr. Vijay Dev (IAS), Chief Electoral Officer, Delhi invited AADI (NGO) Nidhi, Muskaan (NGO), other 7 Disabled Group and Mr. Anuj Jain, Joint Secretary of National Association of the Deaf attended the meeting on 13th March, 2014 at Chief Electoral Officer, Kashmiri Gate, Delhi for accessible for polling stations upcoming Lok Sabha General Election in Delhi on 10th April, 2014.\n\nSummary of discussions noted down:\n\nMany disabled people were unable to access polling stations for booths.

HC gave a verdict last February allowing totally deaf people to take the test, though it clarified that any further privilege as a special category could not be granted.\n\n\"We are obliged to certify that if an applicant is totally deaf, he has to be called for the test if he applies for a learner's licence without the medical certificate. And if he passes the test as required under Rule 11, he shall be granted the learner's licence,\" says the order. It adds, \"If a person belonging to the said category satisfies the necessary criteria, he shall be allowed to obtain the licence.\"\n\nOne and a half years have elapsed but the order has not been complied with. Though the Delhi transport department said the Central Motor Vehicles Rules 1989 needed to be changed for implementation of the order, the road and highways ministry said the HC order was binding.\n\nIn the meantime, hearing-impaired people continue to face discrimination. For example, Anuj Jain, 41, was not allowed to take the test despite fulfilling all the criteria. \"I applied for a driver's licence at the Surajmal Vihar RTO on November 2. I filled all the forms and submitted an ID proof, medical certificate and documents. I then sat for biometric registration, moving on to the driving test section,\" explained Jain in sign language, which was interpreted by his aide.\n\nBut he was in for a rude shock. \"At the time of the test, my interpreter was asked to leave. When she insisted that I had hearing impairment, they rejected my application, saying I was not eligible,\" Jain said. Jain had produced the HC order but it was brushed aside by the officials, who said there had been no communication from the higher-ups.\n\nFive other hearing-impaired people shared the same grievance. Zorin Singha, president of theNational Association of the Deaf, said this problem is faced by most of their members. \"Every tenth hearing-impaired person has complained of the same problem,\" said Singha.\n\nWhen TOI spoke at an RTO office in the city, the officials admitted that they did not allow deaf people to take a driving test. \"We allow people with locomotive disability to take the test, provided they bring their customized vehicle, but not hearing-impaired people,\" said an official on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn the 2011 order, the prosecution had submitted a response by Delhi Police on queries related to safety. Delhi Police cited a court order which states \"due to lack of auditory distraction the deaf have far better focus and concentration needed to drive the vehicle\".\n\nYet, when TOI contacted the Delhi transport department, officials said implementation of the order would require a change in legislation. \"The Delhi Motor Vehicles Act is based on the Central Motor Vehicle Rules. Unless there is a change in that, the DMV Act remains the same,\" said a spokesperson of the transport department.\n\nHowever, a senior Union transport ministry official said, \"The provision in the Central Motor Vehicle Rules does not prohibit anyone with disability from taking a driving test. If they are then found to be unfit, they may be refused a licence.\"\n\n(From Times of India, New Delhi on 24th November, 2012)\n\nThe 3rd National Deaf Conference was jointly organized by The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) & Deaf Welfare Association (DWA) at the Indian Institute of Management, Dehradun (Uttarkhand) on the 13th and 14th of June 2010.\n\nThe Chief Guest for the occasion was Shri. Matbar Singh Kandar, who is the Minister of Social Welfare from Uttarakhand. The other prominent persons present there included the Mayor Shr Vinod Chamoli; Shri. Zorin Singha, the President of National Association of the Deaf (NAD); Shri A.S. Narayanan, General Secretary of NAD and Shri Umesh Grover, General Secretary of Deaf Welfare Association. The conference was inaugurated by the Guest of Honour Shri. Matbar Singh Kandar.\n\nMany Deaf leaders and Deaf persons from across the country participated in the conference to make it a big success. .A total of 125 deaf people and leaders attended the conferece.\n\nShri. A. S. Narayanan, General Secretary of NAD shared about the background of the Sign Language Institute which has been approved by the Finance Minister, Shri. Pranab Mukherjee. This has been included in the 11th Five Year Plan after the Deaf community had done several demonstrations and conducted strike on four occasions at various places in New Delhi.\n\nShri. Zorin Singha, the President of National Association of the Deaf (NAD), shared about the paper on Social Justice and Empowerment (SJE) drafted by the Deaf leaders and made an appeal to the Minister to remove the Persons with Disabilities Act and force the SJE to draft and pass a new law instead. There have been many recommendations to get a new law since there are many problem areas in the PWD Act. It is insufficient in dealing with the problems of the disabled appropriately.\n\nShri. T.K.M. Sandeep, Treasurer of NAD made a presentation on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and made comparisons with the current PWD Act.\n\nThe Conference instilled a lot of confidence in all the participants as they were better informed on the opportunities available for the Deaf and many of them stated that they would spread this information on Deaf Rights to many more people. They expressed their happiness at having gained so much through this conference.\n\nThis is to inform you that a Seminar on DEAF RIGHTS under United Nations Convention of Rights for People with Disabilities (UNCRPD) was organized by National Association of the Deaf, Delhi (INDIA) from 26th and 27th June, 2010 in Vyattla, Ernakulam, district in Kerala State, South India for first time. The NAD invited to two deaf leaders came from each district of Kerala.They were interested to learn things from us through India Sign Language. Shri A.S.Narayanan, Secretary, National Association of the Deaf, Delhi made presentation to the deaf participants about UNCRPD. He explained that the India Government has already ratified UNCRPD on 1st OCT, 2007. He also gave examples to them about PWD Act 1995. This disability law the India Government already has, but still not have implemented yet. There has been no benefits for the deaf through PWD ACT since its passage in 1995. It is wonderful to good news from India Govt announced about pasting a New Disability Law in the month of April this year. We must give our Hearty congratulation to Mr. Mukul Wasnik, Minister for Social Justice and empowerment, Government of India, for paving the way to opening the New Disability Law.\n\nFinally, Good News! After a long time, the need to establish an India Sign Language Research and Training Institute is being addressed. Mr.Pranab Mukherjee, Finance Minister announced for India Sign Language last month of Feb 26th, 2010.India Sign Language Institute is established very soon! We need you in support and unity in work for the deaf in India.\n\nPhoto Gallery"
