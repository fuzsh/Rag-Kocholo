The Approach to School Readiness means that children are ready for school, families are ready to support their children’s learning, and schools are ready for children. Head Start 0 to 5 is a leader in the early childhood field with a strong, clear, and comprehensive focus on healthy development, including physical, cognitive, language, literacy, social and emotional development, all of which are essential to children getting ready for school. We promote belonging for all infants, toddlers, and pre-school age children, and their families. Head Start 0 to 5 parents and staff create and build meaningful partnerships over time through daily interactions. Relationships are central to the Head Start School Readiness approach designed to be responsive and inclusive to the cultural diversity and language of families and children within our community. With a shared commitment and focus on each families’ strengths, we build positive goal-oriented relationships for the child’s well-being. Early relationships have long-term implications for all infant, toddlers, and preschool aged children’s development and their ability to learn and succeed in school.\n\nWhat would be my child’s experience in a Head Start 0 to 5 program?\n\nRoutines in our Head Start 0 to 5 program are planned according to each child’s needs and occur in a timely and predictable manner. When environments are engaging, they support children’s participation in activities that promote development and learning. In our classrooms, we maintain a consistent and flexible Visual Daily Schedule. As time is blocked out in an orderly and consistent fashion, children tend to feel secure and become increasingly independent. Within the Daily Schedule, there is a balance of active and quiet times as well as a range of child initiated experiences, and teacher planned activities that provide opportunities for play, exploration, and problem solving. Activities offered occur in well-designed physical spaces or Interest Areas such as Blocks, Dramatic Play, Toys, Games, Art, Library, Discovery, Sand and Water, Music and Movement, Nutrition, and Outdoors. We include a balance of large group and small group activities. The schedule includes Choice Time, allowing children to choose the Interest Area in which they would like to play, with whom they want to play, and materials to use. As children move from one activity to another, transitions can be relaxed and provide opportunities for learning reinforcing concepts and skills. Transitions can be a challenge for some children; we provide individualized support and cues to build good habits. Mealtimes are more than just nourishing our bodies. Meal times in early infancy is different from toddlers, preschoolers, or even late infancy. Feeding can provide learning opportunities. When a caregiver holds a baby and makes eye contact, they are building social and emotional development. In preschool this includes the children and teacher sitting together to share a meal or snack and promotes learning and development such as expanding social skills, improved fine motor skills, increase self-confidence and using proper table manners. In the first five years of life, all young children learn in the context of caring, responsive, and stimulating relationships as they explore the world around them.\n\nHEALTH SERVICES\n\nSchool readiness starts with health and Health Services ensuring all enrolled children have timely immunizations and screenings for basic health, hearing, vision and dental health.

Johnson declared The War on Poverty in his State of the Union speech. Shortly thereafter, Sargent Shriver took the lead in assembling a panel of experts to develop a comprehensive child development program that would help communities meet the needs of disadvantaged preschool children. Among these experts were Dr. Robert Cooke, a pediatrician at John Hopkins University, and Dr. Edward Zigler, a professor of psychology and director of the Child Study Center at Yale University.\n\nPart of the government’s thinking on poverty was influenced by new research on the effects of poverty, as well as on the impacts of education. This research indicated an obligation to help disadvantaged groups, compensating for inequality in social or economic conditions. Head Start was designed to help break the cycle of poverty, providing preschool children of low-income families with a comprehensive program to meet their emotional, social, health, nutritional and psychological needs. A key tenet of the program established that it be culturally responsive to the communities served, and that the communities have an investment in its success through the contribution of volunteer hours and other donations as nonfederal share.\n\nIn the summers of 1965 and 1966, the Office of Economic Opportunity launched an eight-week Project Head Start. In 1969, under the Nixon administration, Head Start was transferred from the Office of Economic Opportunity to the Office of Child Development in the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Dr. Edward Zigler, who had served on the planning committee to launch Project Head Start, was appointed Director of the Office of Child Development. In 1977, under the Carter administration, Head Start began bilingual and bicultural programs in about 21 states. Seven years later, in October 1984 under the Reagan administration, Head Start’s grant budget exceeded $1 billion. In September of 1995, under the Clinton administration, the first Early Head Start grants were given and in October of 1998, Head Start was reauthorized to expand to full-day and full-year services.\n\nHead Start was most recently reauthorized again in 2007, under the George W. Bush administration, with several provisions to strengthen Head Start quality. These include alignment of Head Start school readiness goals with state early learning standards, higher qualifications for the Head Start teaching workforce, State Advisory Councils on Early Care and Education in every state, and increased program monitoring, including a review of child outcomes and annual financial audits. The Head Start training and technical assistance system was redesigned to support programs through six National Centers and a state-based system to ensure success.\n\nThe statute also included a provision that regulations be promulgated to move programs from an indefinite project period to a five-year grant cycle. Programs would be required to demonstrate they are of high quality or a competitive grant opportunity would be made available within the community. In 2009, under the Obama administration, the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act added more than 64,000 slots for Early Head Start and Head Start programs.\n\nHead Start has served more than 30 million children since 1965, growing from an eight-week demonstration project to include full day/year services and many program options. Currently, Head Start is administered by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) in the Department of Health and Human Services. Head Start serves over a million children and their families each year in urban and rural areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories, including American Indian, Alaska Native, and Migrant and Seasonal communities.\n\nFor more information on the history of Head Start, please visit: Head Start History | ECLKC (hhs.gov)\n\nFRESNO EOC HEAD START HISTORY\n\nFresno Economic Opportunities Commission (Fresno EOC) Head Start Preschool has successfully provided comprehensive child development services for low-income preschool children and their families since 1965.
