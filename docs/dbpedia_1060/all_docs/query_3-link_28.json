        "text": "English Braille is also known as the Grade-2 braille. It contains nearly 250 letters. Braille is not a language -- it is rather a script (alphabet) which can be used to write any language. Grade-1 braille goes letter-by-letter while transcribing a language. However, Grade-2 braille makes use of contractions in order to reduce the number of cells. Grade-3 braille is essentially a personal shorthand used by some people. It is never used in publications.\n\nUnified English Braille (UEB) is a unified standard for English Braille. UEB was proposed to the Braille Authority of North America (BANA) in 1991. The need of UEB was felt because there were many specialized braille standards which conflicted with each in many ways. Such a scenario was threatening the braille-literacy as well as the viability of English braille itself.\n\nThis English to Braille Translation tool uses UEB to translate the English text both in Grade-1, Grade-2 braille and Braille ASCII.\n\nLouis Braille: Inventor of the Braille Script\n\nModern Braille script was invented by a French inventor named Louis Braille. Louis was born in Coupvray, France on 04 January 1809. His father was a leather-maker. At the age of three, little Louis was playing in his father's workshop and he accidentally stuck a stitching awl in one of his eyes. Later, his injured eye got infected. Due to lack of antibiotics, soon, the infection spread to his other eye too. Gradually, by the age of five, the Louis Braille lost sight in both of his eyes.\n\nLouis Braille studied at the Royal Institute for Blind Youth in Paris. There he met Charles Barbier -- the inventor of the night writing script (also a tactile script). Braille began working on a tactile script as an improvement over night writing. It took him two years but, in 1824, he finally created the Braille script with a six-dot system, in 1824, just at the age of 15 years. His headmaster gave him a dictation to test his new script. Louis wrote the entire article being dictated from the newspaper in his newly developed script and then read it back word-to-word.\n\nBraille Alphabet: 6-dot Cell\n\nThe braille script designed by Louis Braille uses tactile patterns made with six raised dots arranged in a 3 x 2 matrix, called the braille cell. One or more braille cells may represent a letter, number, punctuation or a symbol. The following table shows the Unicode Braille characters representing various braille cells.\n\nbraille alphabet uses these cells⠀------⠁1⠃12⠉14⠙145⠑15⠋124⠛1245⠓125⠊24⠚245⠈4⠘45⠄3⠅13⠇123⠍134⠝1345⠕135⠏1234⠟12345⠗1235⠎234⠞2345⠌34⠜345⠤36⠥136⠧1236⠭1346⠽13456⠵1356⠯12346⠿123456⠷12356⠮2346⠾23456⠬346⠼3456⠠6⠡16⠣126⠩146⠹1456⠱156⠫1246⠻12456⠳1256⠪246⠺2456⠨46⠸456⠀⠂2⠆23⠒25⠲256⠢26⠖235⠶2356⠦236⠔35⠴356⠐5⠰56"
