        "text": "The word “deaf-blind” may seem as if a person cannot hear or see at all. The term actually describes a person who has some degree of loss in both vision and hearing. The amount of loss in either vision or hearing will vary from person to person. The combination of losses limits access to auditory and visual information. This can severely limit an individual’s natural opportunities to learn and communicate with others.\n\nOverview of Deafblindness\n\nDeaf-Blindness\n\nHow does someone become deaf-blind?\n\nAbout 50 percent of people in the deaf-blind community have Usher Syndrome.

Other common causes include birth trauma, optic nerve issues, accident/ injury, and CHARGE syndrome.\n\nFAQ on Deaf-Blindness\n\nWhat help is available?\n\nDeafBlind Central (DB Central): Michigan’s Training & Resource Project, provides free services, year-round, for both families and professionals who support students who have combined vision and hearing loss from ages birth to 26.
