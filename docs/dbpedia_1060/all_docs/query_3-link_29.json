        "text": "WELCOME TO EBU, the united voice of millions of blind and partially sighted Europeans.\n\nEBU works towards an accessible and inclusive society with equal opportunities for blind and partially sighted people to fully participate in all aspects of life.\n\nEBU currently has 42 member countries; it aims to protect and promote the interests of all blind and partially-sighted people in Europe\n\nOur vision is that of a Europe which supports and empowers blind and partially sighted people, in which we can be self-determining and which fully includes us in all aspects of society, in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n\nThe Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled.\n\nIt was adopted on June 27, 2013 in Marrakesh. The treaty marks a breakthrough in enabling blind, partially sighted and other print-handicapped persons to access the printed word. EBU is campaigning for full ratification and implementation at European level.\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (UNCRPD).\n\nIt is one of the key texts providing a legal framework for the equality and inclusion of all people with disabilities. It is of course a cornerstone of much of EBU's ongoing work, and we actively promote, disseminate and encourage its use by all of our members."
