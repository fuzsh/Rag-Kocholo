        "text": "EDITORIAL\n\nIn 2009, the World Blind Union and its associate organizations observed the 200th anniversary of the birth of Louis Braille. The revelry evolved into World Braille Day. In 2018, the UN General Assembly made it an official observance by proclaiming January 4 as World Braille Day. January 4 observes the birthdate of Louis Braille. The UN celebrated the first official World Braille Day in 2019. Every year on January 4, World Braille Day reminds us of the significance of accessibility and freedom for those who are blind or visually impaired. Blindness is a state where a person can not see objects due to injury, disease, or a congenital condition. At the same time, vision impairment suggests that a person’s vision is blurred and can not be restored to normalcy.\n\nAbout 36 million people around the world are blind. The figure may extend to 115 by the year 2050 by 2050. It is an alarming situation and requires the utmost care of the world. Vision is the greatest blessing of nature. Those who are blind or have severe vision impairments encounter numerous challenges in life. These challenges include navigating new environments, operating a computer, handling cash, and organizing clothes.\n\nBlind people have ways to deal with many of these situations successfully. In today’s world, cutting-edge technology and voice activation construct a blind person’s life much more manageable. But one invention, in particular, has helped countless blind people. This invention is called Braille, and it was developed nearly 200 years ago. Braille delivers blind people the ability to read and even write letters. The system consists of raised dots that constitute letters and words. The blind or visually impaired people can read them by touch.\n\nLouis Braille invented the reading system of raised dots in 1824. He was born on January 4, 1809, in France. He lost sight after encountering an accident in his father’s harness shop at only three. He later attended the National Institute for Blind Children in Paris. There, his nosiness in music benefitted him when he met Charles Barbier, a captain in Napolean’s army. The captain guided the students about a communication code employing dots called Night Writing. Combining his knowledge of music and the inspiration of code communication, Louis Braille designed a six-dot fingertip reading system when he was only 15 years old.\n\nLouis died in 1852, two years before France’s Royal Institute for the Blind Youth adopted a braille curriculum. By 1916, schools in the United States taught Braille to their blind students.\n\nIt has been one of the most excellent inspirational stories of all time; as they say, necessity is the mother of invention. The day reminds us to take care of blind and visually impaired people. There is a dire need to facilitate all the special people. It includes paying attention to ATMs, elevators, calculators, signs, and Braille. There is a need to learn more about Louis Braille and the history of Braille. Moreover, there is a need to know about famous people who are blind or visually impaired, including Helen Keller, Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, and Andrea Bocelli. Hence, If you know someone blind, ask how Braille has benefited them. Lastly, try to inspire all the blind and visually impaired people by quoting Braille and how he fought with his blindness and paved the way for the betterment of humanity.\n\nThe day is also celebrated in Pakistan, like all other countries. The day reminds us of the imaginative success of humans. Man has always empowered the weaknesses through rehabilitations. Then, there is a need to improve all social behaviors towards blind and visually impaired people. Their rehabilitation into society must be the priority of the nation and state."
