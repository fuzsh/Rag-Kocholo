        "text": "Snap AR x Lenslist AR Asset Hackathon | WINNERS ANNOUNCEMENT https://lnkd.in/efHKebUD via Lenslist \"After weeks of patient anticipation, the day has finally come. The winners announcement for the Snap Inc. AR x #LenslistAR Asset Hackathon is here! The choice, of course, was incredibly hard to make, especially with so many powerful assets in all categories. But don‚Äôt worry: however difficult, the winners‚Äô selection was finally made. The Judges‚Äô sharp eyes made sure to reward all of the best projects and their #Creators. This #hackathon holds a special place in our digital hearts, as it is the first one focusing on assets, not #Lenses. We asked you to think outside the box this time: what‚Äôs the tool that could make your work easier? What‚Äôs missing in the #LensStudio Asset Library? What could help both the novice and experienced Lens Creators create even more inspiring Lenses? And ‚Äì as always ‚Äì you stepped up to the challenge!\"\n\nI'm thrilled to announce that our team for the TELUS x BrainStation Industry 24 Hour Hackathon project was selected as the winning project! There was definitely a lot of stiff competition among the other 4 teams that make up my cohort so well done everyone for everyone's hard work. Thank you to David Iancu and Michael Jiang for the tremendous learning experience and feedback. Some key takeaways I learned are: -The power of clear and polished mockups for demonstrating a website to clients. -The importance of not skipping steps in planning, setup, task identification and design, even in a time crunch. -The value of doing research on any available data that may support or contradict the design of any project. This point in particular was definitely something we could have improved on. I will be paying close attention to this moving forward. Thank you to Mel Greene, Jack Whelton and Meaghen Gutelius for organizing. Thank you to Jim Bennett, Logan Masniuk, Leevon Levasseur, Mandeep Sharma, Yifei Ma, Tomoki Yoshizawa, and Mark Babirad for the breadth of knowledge shared to us. And for my amazing team: Thank you to Sarah Gee, the Figmagician, for your terrific work on creating and presenting the wonderful mockups. The mockups provided a strong north star for development while also adding greatly to the presentation. Thank you to Mary (Xin) Chen for creating the component for displaying a channel/show. The shows now have a bigger impact to attract potential customers. Thank you Elaine Lin for creating the components to display themepacks (collections of shows). Your contribution made the website look like a high quality streaming service. (Also thank all three of you for doing a great job presenting, articulating and picking up the pace for your parts of the presentation after i fumbled my way through the intro. You all continued and ended the presentation on a high note) And thank you Henry Nguyen for your clutch front end development skills. Your skills got the skeleton of the website up quickly so that the rest of us could build components on top of it.\n\nHere are some results and emotions from attending my first hackathon Protothon 2024 by DubsTech and Design Buddies last weekend: üìö Preparation is everything. Timeline is so tight, that most of the time you just function on adrenaline and it is important to have something to keep you and the team on track. For me personally it was a visual timeline of team members availability (working from 3 parts of the world: the US, Germany and Thailand) and a roadmap with the tasks. I also went through each and every task and thought ahead how the work can be distributed in the way to align with our personal strengths and weaknesses. üìû As a team, we didn‚Äôt have any experience working together before the hackathon, so we had an intro videocall, where we got to know a little bit about each other, making sure that communication would go smoothly. Plus, we discussed some organisational moments. ‚åõ It was challenging to get the work done on time. We spent more time on the project, than was expected. Each team member did EVERYTHING AND BEYOND to get their part done. No words to describe how grateful I am to every person in the team üíõ üìà After other teams‚Äô submissions were released, I spent some time looking through it. Not to compare our work to others, but to understand where I personally can do better next time and what are the growth points. To keep it short: I was so focused on delivering on time and the functionality of the project that I completely forgot to have a step back and think thoroughly about the target audience. I should have spent more time on user persona and user journey. With all this being said, I see the hackathon as an amazing experience for designers, especially if they are just starting their career path like I do. It helps to understand design process in a team better and to practice working under the pressure. üîó Here is the link to the prototype as it was submitted: https://bit.ly/4afc5Zn üîó And the link to the final presentation: https://bit.ly/3JVoJBZ We chose challenging, but fun track of time & space travelling mobile app. I will share this project as a case study again once I am done with all the iterations I plan to implement.\n\nüåç Happy Global Accessibility Awareness Day with Cephable! Today, like every day, we stand together to champion inclusion, diversity, and empowerment for all. At Cephable, accessibility isn't just a feature; it's at the core of everything we do. In honor of GAAD, we share our commitment to revolutionizing assistive technology and accessibility everywhere. Our platform empowers individuals to control their technology on their terms using adaptive voice commands, facial expressions, head movements, virtual buttons, and more. With Cephable, we're breaking barriers and opening doors to a world where everyone has equal access and opportunity. But our mission doesn't stop there. We're dedicated to supporting developers in integrating these innovative adaptive controls into their apps, games, devices, and beyond. There's no one-stop shop for accessibility, no perfect point solution, and no easy button. We believe a path toward real inclusion starts with both the user and the developers creating solutions that should be more accessible. Innovating in accessibility doesn't just benefit those with disabilities; it enhances usability for everyone. By designing with diverse needs in mind, we're creating products and experiences that are more intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable for all users. I'm also excited to unveil a video that highlights the impact of Cephable in transforming lives and fostering accessibility. Join us, the Cephable team and our users, in celebrating the power of technology to create a more accessible and inclusive world. So, Happy #GAAD to all! Let's continue to raise awareness, spark conversations, and drive positive change. Together, we can build a future where accessibility is the baseline and we all play on a truly level playing field. #GAAD #AccessibilityMatters #InclusionRevolution #a11y #GAAD2024 #Cephable #assistiveTech Video description: This video features an interview-style presentation where Cephable's CEO/Founder Alex Dunn, Sarah Todd Hammer, Vasant Patel, Hogan Vansickle, and others discuss the impact of Cephable's accessible technology. Throughout the video, various users are shown utilizing Cephable's features, including adaptive voice controls, head motion, virtual buttons, and facial controls. They are shown engaging with multiple digital platforms: gaming, word processing, muting a video call, posting on social media, creating artwork in Photoshop, and even turning a page of music.\n\nHi everyone!

This was my first, and probably the last, Smart India hackathon I have participated in. I learned about this hackathon from my college Raghu Engineering College. This could be an amazing opportunity to meet amazing people, compete with them with our ideas and learn how to look at things from a different angle to improvise our solutions. And when I heard it was the last chance for the final years to participate in the hackathon, I thought of giving myself everything to win it. I shared my thoughts on this hackathon with my friends and they have encouraged me to take part in it, thus forming a group. Even though I got offers from other teams to become one of their members, I rejected them for my own team. As the group leader, I went through almost all of the problem statements and selected a handful of them to pick one after a brief discussion. Thus we ended up choosing the problem statement, \"AI-based Legal document assistant\". Then we chose roles and started working on a prototype design for the end application. We were ready for the internal Hackathon that filters for the external/Actual SIH hackathon. It went better than we expected, and then we improvised our base design and the business model of the current design. It was one month from the final submission for the external hackathon and I thought it was more than enough to submit our idea with additional attachments. But, I gave in full-time to Grow-with-Open-Source as the repos were not done within the schedule. I couldn't focus on SIH or discipline my team to work while I was away. And we all ended up as participants, I really wish I could have done more and yet I failed. This was a good experience and it taught me many valuable lessons i.e., the importance of time management, work-life balance and most importantly responsibility for disciplining the team and choosing the right people for the team. I really appreciate all your efforts Sisir Goljana, Shashiranjan Singh, Ravindra Kora, pabbaraju Bharadwaj and Greeshma Mukkapati and trying to do your best. I'm sorry that I failed you as a Leader, thank you for being a team till the end. #sih2023 #smartindiahackathon #smartindiahackathon2023 #hackathon #hackathon2023 #certificate #certificateofparticipation #failed\n\nAfter two exhausting days, it all proved to be worthwhile! You might be wondering what I‚Äôm referring to. ü§î I always wanted to participate in hackathons but I couldn‚Äôt make it happen during my undergrad. Now pursuing a Masters in an intense program, I always had an assumption that finding extra time for activities like hackathons would be difficult (which to some extent is true). Despite a lot going on with coursework and upcoming deadlines, I took a chance and participated in the Dover Fueling Solutions 2024 Hackathon, organized in collaboration with the Texas McCombs School of Business. This decision turned out to be highly rewarding, as my team (Kapish Krishna Bodapati, Dinesh Bandaru, Vaishnavi Ganesh, Santhosh Kumar Ramkumar) and I secured the second prize. The hackathon kicked off on the evening of Friday, February 2, 2024, and wrapped up on Sunday afternoon, February 4, 2024. It was filled with leadership talks, final presentations, and the winner announcement ceremony. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it. I had the opportunity to explore what Dover Fueling Solutions (DFS) is currently developing, interact with the Anthem dispenser‚Äîa kiosk built into a fuel pump‚Äîand engage in detailed discussions with DFS mentors. These mentors were exceptionally knowledgeable, patiently answering all my questions and thoroughly explaining the operations. Guidance and insights from Mark Kobayashi and Rohith Chinnaswamy enabled our team to devise a multi-faceted solution aimed at improving customer experience, increasing sales for convenience stores, and, most crucially, speeding up the adoption of Anthem through dynamic advertising on Anthem UI using machine learning. This was my first hackathon, and I was initially worried about lasting through the two full days. But the organizers excelled in providing everything we needed, from private spaces for teams to brainstorm and develop their ideas, to ample food and places to relax. The event‚Äôs organization and schedule were particularly impressive to me. This experience has shown me that stepping outside my routine can lead to positive outcomes, such as my success at the hackathon. I am now more eager than ever to participate in future events of this kind for several reasons. First, it taught me a very valuable lesson; second, even if I hadn't been part of a winning team, it would still have been a great learning experience; and third, all participants were invited to the DFS User Conference 2024, happening from March 25 to March 28, 2024, which has excited me even more. For those interested in attending the conference, you can reserve your spot at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gxDeTK5K I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Dover Fueling Solutions (Hob Hairston, Sara Venkatachalam, Ubeda Sawda, PMP¬Æ, SPC¬Æ, Aseem Mankotia) for an amazing opportunity to participate in the hackathon and for being such gracious hosts. #hackathon #dfs #mccombs #innovation"
