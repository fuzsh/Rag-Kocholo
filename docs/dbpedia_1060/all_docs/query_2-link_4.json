        "text": "I want to share one of my mistakes that I’ve been reflecting on since getting back from a trip to Nairobi last week. In 2005 I was fortunate to go up Mount Kilimanjaro with 8 blind climbers from around the world. While there we visited schools for the visually impaired. I’ll never forget opening cupboards to find piles of broken braille machines. It summed up the attitude towards the country’s blind children, thousands of whom were being denied a basic education. My wife Kim Polman and I founded the Kilimanjaro Blind Trust Africa to repair and replace braille machines in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. It sounds like a noble cause doesn’t it? But it wasn’t anywhere near enough. In fact, the more machines we put into use, the clearer all the other problems became. There wasn’t enough braille paper, or teachers with the right training, or curricula that had been adapted. Corruption meant the working machines were often stolen and sold. Anti-blind stigma was everywhere, including in government where funding was prioritised for so-called (and yes I did really hear this) “more productive” members of society. For ten years we tried to work on all of this. We repaired and replaced 35,000 machines, started a paper company, trained teachers, got the publishing world to release key texts in braille, and did many more things. But we were still failing to have the impact we hoped. Many of the blind young people we supported still couldn’t get jobs. For some it felt even worse, because they had the frustration of having an education they couldn’t use. So we changed our approach again, this time with more emphasis on advocacy and technology. Crucially, this has meant helping scale the Orbit, which is a kind of electronic reader roughly the size of two iphones, that can house full curriculum including Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM). I left Nairobi seeing that finally we have a model that works. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of Suparna Biswas and the team, and the amazing young people themselves, many more are getting into secondary and higher education. We just agreed a programme in Kenya to support hundreds of visually impaired graduates take the step into work, and to help more companies welcome in these amazing and talented individuals. There are two morals to this story. First, don’t just fix the braille machine. If you’re not working the whole system, you’re not fixing the problem. Second, systems change is hard. It’s ok to fail and try again, but it’s not ok to give up. What mistakes have you made that the rest of us can learn from?"
