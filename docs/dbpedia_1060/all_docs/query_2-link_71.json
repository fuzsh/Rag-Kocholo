Your arteries are the vessels (tubes) that carry blood from your heart to your brain and the rest of your body. You need a certain amount of pressure to get the blood moving around your body.\n\nYour blood pressure naturally goes up and down throughout the day and night, and it’s normal for it to go up while you’re moving about. It’s when your overall blood pressure is always high, even when you are resting, that you need to do something about it.\n\nBlood pressure is measured using two numbers:\n\nSystolic pressure: this is the higher of the two numbers. It’s the pressure against your arteries when your heart is pumping blood around your body.\n\nDiastolic pressure: this is the lower of the two numbers. It shows how much pressure is in your arteries when your heart relaxes between beats.\n\nLearn what normal blood pressure readings look like.\n\nThe medical term for high blood pressure is ‘hypertension’, and it means your blood pressure is always too high. This means your heart is working harder when pumping blood around your body.\n\nRisks of high blood pressure\n\nHigh blood pressure is a serious condition.\n\nYour arteries are normally stretchy, so they can cope with your blood pressure going up and down. But with high blood pressure, your arteries lose their stretchiness, becoming stiff or narrow.\n\nThis narrowing makes it easier for fatty material (atheroma) to build up. This narrowing and damage to the arteries lining your heart or brain could trigger a life-threatening heart attack or stroke.\n\nIf left untreated, high blood pressure can also lead to complications such as:\n\nkidney failure\n\nheart failure\n\nproblems with your sight\n\nvascular dementia.\n\nLearn more about how high blood pressure is treated.\n\nWe’re here for you with information and support\n\nOur fortnightly Heart Matters newsletter includes the latest updates about medications and treatments, as well as support for healthy eating, staying active and your emotional wellbeing.\n\nI’d like to sign up\n\nCauses of high blood pressure\n\nIn most cases, there isn't a specific reason for the cause of high blood pressure, but most people develop it because of their diet, lifestyle or medical condition.\n\nYou might be more at risk if you:\n\nare over the age of 65\n\nhave someone in your family with high blood pressure\n\nare someone who smokes\n\ndrink too much alcohol\n\neat too much salt and not enough fruit and vegetables\n\ndon't get enough exercise\n\nare overweight, especially around your mid-section.\n\nPeople living in deprived areas are also at higher risk of having high blood pressure, as well as people who are of black African or black Caribbean descent. Changes in your diet and increasing activity levels will help improve your blood pressure.\n\nFor some people, a cause of high blood pressure is found. This is known as ‘secondary hypertension’.\n\nExamples of secondary hypertension include:\n\nkidney disease\n\ndiabetes\n\na condition called obstructive sleep apnoea, which can lead to disturbed sleep\n\nsome medicines, such as oral contraceptives\n\nsome over-the-counter and herbal medicines.\n\nIf you are worried that any medicine or remedy might affect your blood pressure, ask your doctor or pharmacist about it.\n\nVisit the NHS website for more information about the causes of secondary hypertension.\n\nSymptoms of high blood pressure\n\nMost people don't know they have high blood pressure because there aren't obvious symptoms. That's why it's so important to get your blood pressure checked regularly.\n\nRarely, it can cause symptoms like blurred vision, headaches and nosebleeds.\n\nFind out more about the symptoms of high blood pressure.\n\nWhere to measure or check your blood pressure\n\nAs many as 5 million adults in the UK have undiagnosed high blood pressure and don’t know they are at risk. The only way to know whether you have high blood pressure is to have it measured.\n\nYou can get your blood pressure checked at:\n\nGP surgeries\n\nsome pharmacies\n\nsome workplaces.\n\nIf you’re a healthy adult aged 40 to 74, and live in England or Wales, you’ll be invited to a free NHS Health Check every 5 years, which will include a blood pressure check.\n\nYou can also check your blood pressure at home. In England, a scheme called Blood Pressure @home is in place to support people with this, which you can ask your GP about. There is also a similar scheme in Scotland called the Scale-Up BP initiative.\n\nHow to measure or check your blood pressure\n\nYour blood pressure is usually measured using a blood pressure monitor. This is usually an electronic monitor connected to an inflatable cuff, which is wrapped around your upper arm.\n\nWhen you have your blood pressure measured, the reading is written as two numbers. The first is when the pressure is at its highest (or systolic pressure), and the second at its lowest (or diastolic pressure).\n\nFor example, your reading might be something like 140/90 mmHg, which you would say as “140 over 90” (mmHg is a unit for measuring blood pressure).\n\nDiagnosing high blood pressure\n\nYour blood pressure will usually need to be checked more than once to confirm a diagnosis of high blood pressure.\n\nThis is because blood pressure can go up and down a lot during the day. When people have their blood pressure checked in the clinic it can be higher than expected, especially if they feel nervous or anxious.\n\nIf your blood pressure is high in the clinic, you might be advised to:\n\nTake additional readings at home using a 24-hour monitor that checks your blood pressure throughout the day (called ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, or ABPM).\n\nRecord additional readings at home using your own blood pressure monitor (called home blood pressure monitoring, or HBPM). You can also ask your GP practice if they are part of any schemes where you can loan a blood pressure monitor from them.\n\nIf you’ve been asked to monitor your blood pressure at home, your GP will ask you to check your blood pressure over several days. This can include taking a series of recordings (at least two), twice a day, in the morning and evening.\n\nBy looking at all your blood pressure readings over a few days, your GP can work out what your 'average’ blood pressure is.\n\nIn some cases, your GP might want to run other tests as well. For instance, they might want to do blood tests to check your cholesterol levels and kidney function, or check your heart rhythm with a test called an electrocardiogram (ECG).\n\nBlood pressure readings\n\nHealthy or normal blood pressure\n\nThere are two categories of normal blood pressure:\n\nNormal blood pressure is usually considered to be between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg. For over-80s, because it’s normal for arteries to get stiffer as we get older, the ideal blood pressure is under 150/90 mmHg (or 145/85 mmHg at home).\n\nHigh-normal blood pressure, sometimes called ‘pre-hypertension’, is when you don’t have an ideal blood pressure but you also don’t have high blood pressure. It’s usually considered to be between 120/80 mmHg and 140/90 mmHg. Being at this level might prompt you to live a healthier lifestyle so you don’t develop high blood pressure.\n\nThe NHS has a handy tool to show where your blood pressure is on a chart.\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nThere are three different stages of high blood pressure:\n\nStage one: this is when your blood pressure is between 140/90 mmHg and 160/100 mmHg in the clinic, or 135/85 mmHg to 150/95 mmHg at home.\n\nStage two: this is when your blood pressure is between 160/100 mmHg and 180/120 mmHg in the clinic, or over 150/95 mmHg at home.\n\nStage three: this is when your systolic blood pressure is over 180 mmHg or your diastolic blood pressure is over 120 mmHg in the clinic. This stage is also called ‘severe hypertension’, and your GP will need to assess you urgently for further investigations.\n\nDiscuss your readings with your healthcare team and ask any questions you have. Together, you might want to set a target blood pressure that’s right for you and your health goals.\n\nTreating high blood pressure\n\nHow your high blood pressure is managed depends on a range of things, such as your health goals and the stage of your condition. The healthcare team at your GP practice will help you create a plan to reduce your blood pressure.\n\nBy making lifestyle changes, you can lower your blood pressure and keep it at a healthy level. Recent evidence shows that tackling obesity and staying active are especially important. You'll feel the benefits right away with improved sleep, more energy, and a better mood. This useful tool developed by the NHS helps you make a plan that you can discuss with your GP.\n\nIf your blood pressure is high or very high, your GP will usually offer you medicines on top of lifestyle changes.\n\nFind out more about medications and treatment for high blood pressure.\n\nWhen you should check your blood pressure\n\nIf you’re a healthy adult aged 40 to 74, it’s a good idea to get your blood pressure checked every five years (during an NHS Health Check if in England or Wales). If you’re near the threshold for high blood pressure, your healthcare team may ask to monitor you more often.\n\nIf your blood pressure is well controlled, you’ll normally be monitored yearly, along with reviewing any medication you take. When you start new medications or have dose changes to existing ones, your blood pressure will need to be checked more than once a year.\n\nCheck with your healthcare team how often to measure your blood pressure at home if you have your own monitor. Try keeping a diary of your readings – this will help your healthcare team spot patterns, and it might be motivating to see how your blood pressure improve over time.\n\nHelp and support"
