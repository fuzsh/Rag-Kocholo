I just wanted to make art out something I wanted to learn. This is more of a dedicated vent than a profit. Plus, I am not doing anything official or commercial with this. I just was bored and thought: Make blind people a font on braille.\n\nDEDICATED TO BLIND PEOPLE\n\nPeople every day are blinded or born blinded. Not in a sense of \"you are stupid\" type blind. They are actually blind and need symbols popping out as dots to read. They feel the words. This is known as Braille. I am kinda learning the alphabet of braille and its importance.\n\nSo, one day, I sat down and thought: Why not make a font for braille?\n\nI know they might never see this or feel this, but I wanted to make something to show how I thought since every language gets their front, why not braille?\n\nUsing \"Fractal\" and several other sources for braille, here is my font of braille.\n\nIt is known as The DiRECTOR\n\nDirects blind people to know where they are going and helps them dive into books and imagine worlds they might have not ever seen. The \"I\" is short to look like the hand touching the braille in our normal next just like I went and touch the text they read.\n\nMess with this and surprise your friends and learn braille similar to how I am and how they are by typing with this font.\n\nLike I stated before:\n\nDEDICATED TO BLIND PEOPLE\n\nPublished: 17th June, 2018\n\nLast edited: 18th June, 2018\n\nCreated: 17th June, 2018\n\nWith Simbraille, is easier to see the where the dots are placed in the 6-dot cell. It may be used to teach about dot placement.\n\nIf you typed Braille with Perky Duck, you can copy and paste it into a Word Editor, like Microsoft Word. Then you just change the font to be this font, Unicode Braille Font. 16 pt font size is recommended.\n\nYou can also take text, copy and paste it into an online braille translator, and take that brailled text, and use that text in Microsoft Word. Then change the font type.\n\nYou might need to adjust height spacing if it's too cramped. In Microsoft Office, you can right click, and go to Paragraph, and change the Line spacing to 2. That would make it easier to read.\n\nYou may adjust margins to give more space as well."
