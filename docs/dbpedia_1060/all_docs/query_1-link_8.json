        "text": "To have another language is to possess a second soul.\n\n– Charlemagne\n\n(1) Of film actors\n\nIn the movie, a young Shah Rukh Khan sits on brown flagstones. He sings in desperation because he’s in love with a girl from a rich family. He’s too poor for her. One of those old Bollywood productions from the early 2000s, where he’s wearing a white Punjabi suit with sandals. Shah Rukh has aged since then, but you still feel most alive when you’re watching Bollywood movies. As Shah Rukh sings about his girl in Hindi, you read the lyrics in white (sometimes yellow) subtitles, while his voice shouts down to you from the home theatre system perched above the mantelpiece. The parts you love most are the ones that don’t translate exactly but being bilingual, you know what they mean. Words are just things that hover lightly above ideas.\n\n(2) Of erasures, replacements\n\nThe opposite being foreign language movies with voice-overs. Those over dramatic novelas on Telemundo where an unknown person speaks over the actor’s voice. A vivacious young woman with a name like Yessica speaks but the woman speaking over her sounds sober and middle-aged. You call the owner of this voice Harriet. You imagine, for some odd reason, pale white toes and a ginger cat belonging to this voice — knitting needles and grey hair caught up in a bun. The sedate voice Harriet erases Yessica. The same way going to a private school erased you. There was a rule against speaking vernacular. There was a rule that said black girls had to have their hair plaited. There was a rule that said… well, there was a rule for everything. Even your name became homogenized, got skewered in all those white throats. They didn’t roll the r’s right.\n\n(3) Of double identities\n\nTo learn another language is to acquire another soul personhood. Sometimes you feel you have two separate identities. Your English soul erases suffocates your Shona soul. In a nightmare, the one soul seeps out until only the other remains. Whenever a girl bleaches her skin, a native soul is suffocated. Whenever a Harriet speaks over a Yessica, an other¹ soul is deleted. You imagine the day when a nation full of souls will be erased.\n\n4. Of liminal spaces (refuge)\n\nTHIS DIALECT WILL NEVER BE SPOKEN AGAIN, a headline. Soon all of the suffocating souls languages will be dead. Harrowing yes, but easily overtaken by global warming, the war on terror, stock markets plunging. But when Shah Rukh sings and you read the subtitles, both your souls are living — none suffocates the other. This is a sort of Braille.\n\n1. Other here refers to people of colour"
