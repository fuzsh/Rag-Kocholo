        "text": "It's World Braille Day - and RNIB Braille Name Generator is back by popular demand! This year the team can spread the word much wider about braille, thanks to a brilliant developer, Matt Eason, who offered to build us an automated name generator tool after watching us do it manually for the last few years! If you want to share your name in braille just reply to the RNIB World Braille Day posts on Twitter, Threads or Linkedin by 2pm today. [Image description - My name - Charlotte - in text with a visual representation of the braille above, separated by a pink line. The text \"Remember - braille is read by touch, this is just a visual representation\" and the RNIB See Differently logo are below.]\n\nWe celebrate World Braille Day every year on January 4th because it’s Louis Braille’s birthday. He’s the inventor of braille! Louis was born in 1809 in France and became blind after a childhood accident. But he quickly mastered his new way of living. When Louis was only 15 years old, he created a reading and writing system based on Charles Barbier’s night writing system. We know Louis’ system today as braille. Adjusted over time, braille is now easier to read and used worldwide! World Braille Day is a reminder of the importance of accessibility and independence for people who are blind or visually impaired. Today’s reality is that many establishments, such as restaurants, banks, and hospitals, don’t offer braille versions of their print materials like menus, statements, and bills. Because of this, people with blindness or visual impairments often don’t have the freedom to choose a meal on their own or keep their finances private. This day spreads awareness about braille and other accessible forms of communication. Everyone deserves (and is legally entitled to) the same accommodations and services, regardless of ability. Let’s remember that and do our part to make our workplaces more accessible for everyone. Braille is often a preferred method for reading certain documents. For example, having a menu to read on one’s own allows braille readers to participate in conversations while browsing food options. Also, having a braille bank statement to review — and reread when there’s a potential discrepancy — provides convenience that other accessible formats don’t offer. Every individual will indeed have their accessible format preference, but braille seems to win over others in many cases. #brailleday\n\nIn honor and celebration of #WorldBrailleDay, I wanted to share with you 10 simple ways in which #Braille can be useful. (Credit for this list goes to the National Federation of the Blind.) 1.) Reading 2.) Monopoly and other board games 3.) Memorizing choral works 4.) Provides equity 5.) Locating the right rooms in buildings 6.) On rulers or meter sticks to measure anything 7.) Locating the right restroom 8.) Reading restaurant menus 9.) Identifying medication 10.) Using computerized Braille devices This is just a small portion of their full list, which includes 215 ways in which Braille is useful. I encourage you to take a moment to explore the full 215 ways, whether you're new to Braille or a seasoned enthusiast. It's not just a list, but rather a testament to the incredible power of braille in transforming lives and empowering our visually impaired friends to access information and pursue their passions. Check out the rest at www.Braille.day #WorldBrailleDay #BrailleEmpowers #AccessibilityMatters\n\nToday is World Braille Day! While many people think of Braille as a language or as similar to sign language, it's actually considered a code. There are six dots in each Braille cell, and the different combinations of raised dots are used to show letters, numbers, punctuation, and similar. Learning Braille gives people with sight loss independence, literacy, and the enjoyment of reading. It is one way of ensuring that you can read private correspondence, such as bank statements and hospital appointments, which otherwise might have to be read by someone else.
