        "text": "All India Confederation of the Blind (AICB) convened a Conference on the status of Braille in the Asian region in New Delhi on 22nd and 23rd December, 2008. 119 delegates from 21 States of the country, 16 representatives from 11 countries of the Asian region and officers from leading International Organizations like International Council of Educators for Visually Impaired, Norwegian Association of the Blind and Partially Sighted and Sight Savers International participated in the Conference. The Conference deliberated upon various aspects relating to Braille development, co-ordination, Braille production, Braille teaching, awareness generation etc. All the ABU affiliates agreed on a comprehensive plan of action in the concluding session of the conference to implement in their respective regions. The complete plan of action has been given in appendix II of this report. According to this plan the affiliates agreed to initiate the efforts to achieve the following objectives: • An independent National Braille Authority will be set up in every participating country to oversee all aspects of Braille development and production; • Uniform Braille mathematics and Science code will be adopted for every participating country; • All blind children in every participating country will get all textbooks in Braille, free of cost for elementary and secondary stages of education within the next five years and the use of audio material in place of Braille textbooks will be avoided; • Braille production centers will be suitably strengthen and networked to have a much larger number of books in Braille; • Government-run mainstream libraries should have a Braille section and these should be suitably enriched; • Inclusive education programmes must ensure that Braille is properly taught to all visually impaired children; • New and progressive methods and techniques of Braille teaching should be introduced in schools; • Teachers of Braille should be provided opportunities of updating their knowledge through orientation courses from time to time devised in the concluding session of the conference. In order to achieve these objectives, all the ABU affiliates were requested time to time to forward the Plan to the concerned Government Authorities and organizations in their countries and meet their officers personally also to persuade them for implementing the action-points agreed in the plan of action. In order to monitor the progress ABU accepted the responsibility to contact its affiliates time to time and ask them for the periodical reports. Part 2: the objectives of the research • To investigate the status of implementation of the plan of action adopted during the concluding session of the conference on status of Braille in the Asian region in New Delhi on 22nd and 23rd December, 2008. • To develop a course of action for ABU for the improvement in the plan of action. A questionnaire was designed to investigate the status of efforts being made by the ABU affiliates to achieve the above objectives. . This research tool was sent to all the 28 participating organizations out of which only 10 organizations returned the filled questionnaire. In spite of the fact that the research tool was made available in three languages like English, Arabic and Russian to facilitate the affiliates with the proper understanding of the tool, only ten organizations responded after ten periodical reminders..."
