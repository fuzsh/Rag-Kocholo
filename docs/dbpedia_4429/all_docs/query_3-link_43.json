        "text": "Short-term lets legislation changes in Scotland\n\nRead guidance and advice on the changes to Scotland's short-term lets legislation – impacting operators and hosts.\n\n0 min read\n\nWhat is the short-term let legislation?\n\nThe Scottish Government has introduced a licensing regime for short-term lets in Scotland. The scheme requires all local councils to establish a short-term let licensing scheme.\n\nPlease note that this web page includes a summary of the law relating to short-term lets. You should take further advice on how the law applies to specific circumstances.\n\nPage last updated: 3 October 2023\n\n1. Who needs a short-term lets licence?\n\nIf you, as a host, provide residential accommodation to a guest in the course of business, you might operate a short-term let. The new legislation will consider a property a short-term let if the guest does not:\n\noccupy the property as their main home and they are not an immediate family member of the host\n\nprincipally use the property to facility work or services to the host\n\nshare the property with the host as part of an educational arrangement\n\nSee if the legislation applies to your business\n\nTypes of accommodation that could be considered a short-term let Common exclusions to the scheme\n\nStill not sure?\n\nFind out whether you need a licence\n\nCompleting the following questionnaire will also lead you to the relevant local council webpage. There you will find more information about the scheme in your area and how to apply.\n\nTip: open the questionnaire in a new tab. This way, you can refer back to our short-term lets page more easily.\n\nTake the questionnaire on mygov.scot Browse more information about the scheme\n\n2. When do I need to have a licence?\n\nExisting host / operator\n\nThose operating short-term lets before 1 October 2022 should have applied for a licence by 1 October 2023. You can continue to receive guests and accept bookings while your application is being determined.\n\nOperators who did not apply for a licence by 1 October 2023 must not take bookings, deposits or have guests to stay until a licence has been awarded. This includes businesses which establish new short-term let accommodation not covered by an existing licence. Please note the application process may take several months.\n\nNew host / operator\n\nNew hosts starting a short-term let need a licence before they can start operating. You may advertise, but not take any bookings, deposits, or have guests to stay.\n\nThis also applies to existing operators who establish new short-term let accommodations.\n\n3. How to apply for a licence\n\nYou'll need to apply for a short-term lets licence through your local council. They have the information and application forms available on their websites.\n\nBefore starting your application, it's worth reviewing whether you need planning permission.\n\nIt's also good to check whether you adhere to the mandatory conditions set for every short-term let in Scotland. Please review the following steps to see how you can get ready.\n\nPreparing for your application\n\n1\n\nReview mandatory conditions\n\nThere are mandatory conditions that every short-term let in Scotland will need to follow. These relate to the safety of the activity. Licensing councils can also set extra conditions according to local needs and circumstances.\n\nFind supplementary guidance for licensing authorities, letting agencies, and platforms on gov.scot.\n\nRead guidance for hosts and operators on gov.scot\n\n2\n\nCheck if you need planning permission\n\nLocal councils may also choose to designate short-term let Planning Control Areas (PCAs). This means that you need planning permission to let out whole accommodation in these areas. This is in addition to a short-term let licence.\n\nYou may wish to contact your local council for advice if you are unsure whether you need planning permission.\n\nRead more about Planning Control Areas (PCAs).\n\n3\n\nContact your local council\n\nLocal councils have information and application forms needed to apply for a short-term lets licence on their websites.\n\nGetting your application right first time will help councils in processing it and it may also help you to get a decision quicker. The timescales for determination are dependent on various factors including licensing council workloads.\n\nYour licensing council will set out the detail and format of any documentation that you need for your application on its website.\n\nView the full list of local councils on mygov.scot\n\n4\n\nPay the fee and await the outcome\n\nLocal councils will charge a fee for making a licence application. Fees differ across local councils and for different types of licence, e.g. home sharing, home letting and secondary letting. If you need to apply for planning permission, there will also be a fee for making a planning application.\n\nCouncils will generally have 12 months to decide on applications from existing hosts. They have nine months for applications from new hosts. But extensions are possible.\n\n4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nWe know there are many questions related to this new legislation. That's why we’ve pulled some of the key questions – and more importantly answers – to make it a little easier for you.\n\nGetting a short-term let licence\n\nWhat is considered a short-term let? When do I need to have a licence? What types of licences are there?\n\nThere are four types of licence:\n\n1\n\nHome sharing\n\nThis means using all or part of your own home for short-term lets while you are there.\n\n2\n\nHome letting\n\nThis means using all or part of your own home for short-term lets while you are absent, for example whilst you are on holiday.\n\n3\n\nSecondary letting\n\nThis means the letting of property where you do not normally live, for example a holiday let.\n\n4\n\nHome letting and home sharing\n\nThis means you operate short-term lets from your own home. This is both while you are living there but also for periods when you are absent.\n\nWho can apply for a licence? How do I apply for a licence? How many licences will I need? How long will a licence last? How much does a licence cost? What happens if I refuse to apply for a licence? Should I apply for a temporary licence?\n\nExisting hosts\n\nAre you an existing operator before 1 October 2022 and have you made your licence application before 1 October 2023? Then you don't need a temporary licence to continue operating.\n\nNew hosts\n\nIf you're a new host, you may consider applying for a temporary licence. You can make a full application for the same premises as the temporary licence. In this case, your temporary licence remains valid until your full licence application is processed.\n\nPlease check with your council:\n\nif you can apply for a temporary licence\n\nhow long it will take to issue them\n\nhow long they are valid (usually six weeks)\n\nif there are any fees involved\n\nRead more about the cost of a short-term let licence on the Scottish Government website.\n\nPlanning permission\n\nWhat is a Planning Control Area (PCA)? Do I need planning permission before I apply for a licence? My short-term let is not in a Planning Control Area. Do I still need planning permission? If I get planning permission, can I still be refused a licence? How do I submit my planning application?\n\nOnline\n\nyou can submit on ePlanning.scot\n\nyou'll need to set yourself up as a user first\n\nthe system is fairly easy to use, but does require a basic level of understanding of the planning process\n\nOn paper\n\ngo to ePlanning.scot\n\nscroll down until you get to \"Can I still make an application using paper forms if I want to?\"\n\nyour local council may also have paper forms to download on their websites\n\nRead the guidance note from Heads of Planning Scotland (HOPS) on how to successfully submit an application.\n\nHow long does it take to get a planning application? What are the fees for a planning application or certificate of lawfulness?\n\nOther questions\n\nHow will the legislation impact businesses that work with VisitScotland? As an existing operator, can I take bookings – not knowing whether a licence will be granted? As a new operator, can I take bookings after October 2022 – not knowing whether a licence will be granted? If you take a booking but your licence is refused or revoked, how does the operator administer the booking? Are licences transferable? If my certification expires part way through the licence period, what should I do? What happens with complaints – is there an appeals process? If I have a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO) licence, do I need a short-term let licence? How does a new operator evidence “intention to let”?\n\nQuestions?
