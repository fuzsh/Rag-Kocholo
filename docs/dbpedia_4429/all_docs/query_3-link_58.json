For example, active financial services clients may include those with active credit or savings accounts (excluding remittances or other financial transactions) or clients who have had transactions with microfinance institutions (MFI) during the reporting period. The definition of active may vary by product. For example, for traditional services, “active” typically includes all individuals who have accounts registered in their names for at least six months and who have used their accounts to make transactions within the prior six months. For digital services, “active” typically includes individuals who have had accounts registered in their names for at least three months and who have used their accounts to make transactions within the prior three months.\n\nSources: CGAP’s Number of Active Clients definition and the GIIN's Navigating Impact project.\n\nThe combination of policies, mechanisms, and governance arrangements (entitlements, licenses, permits, etc.) used to determine who is allowed to abstract water from a resource pool, how much may be taken and when, as well as how much must be returned (of what quality), and the conditions associated with the use of this water.\n\nSource: OECD.

Simply stated, assets represent ownership of value that can be converted into cash (although cash itself is also considered an asset).\n\nSource: International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nBarren land is land of limited ability to support life and in which less than one-third of the area has vegetation or other cover. In general, it is an area of thin soil, sand, or rocks. Vegetation, if present, is more widely spaced and scrubby than that in the Shrub and Brush category of Rangeland. Unusual conditions, such as a heavy rainfall, occasionally result in growth of a short-lived, more luxuriant plant cover. Wet, nonvegetated barren lands are included in the Nonforested Wetland category.\n\nBarren land subcategories identified in the Anderson Land Classification system include: dry salt flats, beaches, and sandy areas other than beaches; bare exposed rock; strip mines, quarries, and gravel pits; transitional areas; and mixed barren land.\n\nSource: Anderson Land Classification System\n\nA carbon credit, or a carbon offset, is a financial unit of measurement that represents the removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) from the atmosphere. Carbon credits, also known as Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), enable businesses to compensate for their emissions, meet their carbon reduction goals, and support the move to a low carbon economy. Carbon offsetting markets were created as a mechanism to achieve the targets set within the Kyoto Protocol, adopted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC).\n\nCarbon offsetting delivers financing to essential renewable energy, forestry, and resource conservation projects which generate reductions in Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions. Projects can be validated and verified to demonstrate that they are generating GHG reductions and can be monitored on a regular basis through independent third parties.\n\nOrganizations can refer to the following resources for additional guidance on carbon offsets:\n\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n\nCarbon Neutral\n\nNatural Resources Defense Council\n\nCaregiver health professionals -- a subgroup of caregivers -- provide preventive, curative, rehabilitative, and promotional health services based on an extensive body of theoretical and factual knowledge in diagnosis and treatment of disease and other health problems. They may conduct research on human disorders/illnesses and ways of treating them, as well as supervise other workers.\n\nCaregiver professionals are distinct from the larger group of caregivers in that their knowledge and skills are the result of study at a higher educational institution in a health-related field for a period of 3-6 years leading to the award of a first degree or higher qualification. This includes general and specialist medical practitioners, nurses, dentists, paramedics, etc.\n\nSources: Adapted from the World Health Organization and the International Labor Office's International Standard Classification of Occupations\n\nThe geographical zone in which water is captured, flows through and eventually discharges at one or more points. The concept includes both surface water catchment and groundwater catchment. A surface water catchment is defined by the area of land from which all precipitation received flows through a sequence of streams and rivers towards a single river mouth, as tributary to a larger river, or to the sea. A groundwater catchment is defined by a geological structure of an aquifer and groundwater flow paths. It is replenished by water that infiltrates from the surface. Depending on local conditions, surface and groundwater catchments may be physically separate or interconnected.\n\nSource: Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.

Gland, Switzerland: Ramsar Convention Secretariat, 2018.\n\nA contract is an agreement with specific terms between two or more persons or entities in which there is a promise to do something in return for a valuable benefit, such as payment. The existence of a contract requires that there be a proposed and accepted offer, a promise to perform by one entity as well as a promise to provide a valuable benefit by the other (payment), and a time or event by which performance must occur.\n\nCritical equipment or facilities are those fixed assets necessary for the organization to provide its products and services in the sense that they are materially necessary. Materially necessary means that if the equipment were destroyed, degraded, or compromised, it would make it difficult or impossible for the organization to provide its services/products. It is also typically equipment that has a maximum utilization that is a limiting factor on the units produced or services provided. For example, a hospital might cite patient beds, an MRI machine, or sterile surgical rooms as critical equipment/facilities.\n\nLand area under the organization's direct control is land for which the organization completely controls land use through direct operation or management. This includes situations where the organization's employees cultivate the land directly.\n\nNote that land ownership is not always equivalent to control. For example, in situations where land is leased to another entity or individual to cultivate, land is only directly controlled if the lease is accompanied by exhaustive land use criteria. If this land use criteria still allows the organization to have financial control and management over the land, the land is still considered to be directly controlled by the organization.\n\nDiversity includes all the ways in which people differ, and it encompasses all the different characteristics that make one individual or group different from another. It is all-inclusive and recognizes everyone and every group as part of the diversity that should be valued. A broad definition includes not only race, ethnicity, and gender — the groups that most often come to mind when the term \"diversity\" is used — but also age, national origin, religion, disability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, education, marital status, language, and physical appearance. It also involves different ideas, perspectives, and values.\n\nSource:\n\n“Racial Equity Tools - Glossary.” Racial Equity Tools, n.d.\n\nEcological restoration is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed. An ecosystem has recovered - and is restored - when it contains sufficient biotic and abiotic resources to continue its development without further assistance or subsidy. It will sustain itself structurally and functionally. It will demonstrate resilience to normal ranges of environmental stress and disturbance. It will interact with contiguous ecosystems in terms of biotic and abiotic flows and cultural interactions.\n\nFor example, if the objective is to establish tree cover with a designated species composition and species abundance on former cropland, one intervention could be to plant sapling trees of the designated species at specified densities. Refer to Society for Ecological Restoration Guidelines for Developing and Managing Ecological Restoration Projects for additional background information.\n\nSource: Society for Ecological Restoration\n\nThe benefits people obtain from ecosystems. These include provisioning services such as food and water; regulating services such as regulation of floods, drought, land degradation, and disease; supporting services such as soil formation and nutrient cycling; and cultural services such as recreational, spiritual, religious, and other non-material benefits.\n\nProvisioning services are goods provided by ecosystems and include crops, timber, and livestock as well as genetic resources for medicines. Regulating services maintain healthy ecosystem functioning and include water purification, pollination, water regulation, and climate regulation. Cultural services are intangible and non-material value people derive from nature and include spiritual and aesthetic benefits as well as recreation and tourism. Supporting services are the natural processes that maintain the three other ecosystem services.\n\nOrganizations can refer to the following sources for additional information on ecosystem services:\n\nUnited Nations Environment Programme\n\nMillenium Ecosystem Assessment\n\nForest lands have a tree-crown areal density (crown closure percentage) of 10 percent or more, are stocked with trees capable of producing timber or other wood products, and exert an influence on the climate or water regime. Lands from which trees have been removed to less than 10 percent crown closure but which have not been developed for other uses also are included; for example, lands on which there are rotation cycles of clear cutting and block planting are part of Forest Land. Note: The technical defintion of \"forest land\" may vary by country.\n\nLands that meet the requirements for Forest Land and also for an Urban or Built-up category should be placed in the latter category. The only exceptions in classifying forest land are those areas which would otherwise be classified as Wetland if not for the forest cover. Since the wet condition is of much interest to land managers and planning groups and is so important as an environmental surrogate and control, such lands are classified as Forested Wetland.\n\nForest Land subcategories identified in the Anderson Land Classification system include: Deciduous, Evergreen, and Mixed.\n\nSource: Anderson Land Classification System\n\nGender refers to the socially constructed characteristics of women and men – such as norms, roles and relationships of and between groups of women and men. It varies from society to society and can be changed. While most people are born either male or female, they are taught appropriate norms and behaviors – including how they should interact with others of the same or opposite sex within households, communities and work places. When individuals or groups do not “fit” established gender norms they often face stigma, discriminatory practices or social exclusion – all of which adversely affect health. It is important to be sensitive to different identities that do not necessarily fit into binary male or female sex categories.\n\nSource: World Health Organization\n\nRefers to the equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities of women and men and girls and boys. Equality does not mean that women and men will become the same but that women’s and men’s rights, responsibilities and opportunities will not depend on whether they are born male, female, or another gender. Gender equality implies that the interests, needs and priorities of all genders are taken into consideration, recognizing the diversity of different groups of women and men. Gender equality is not a women’s issue but should concern and fully engage men as well as women. Equality between genders is seen both as a human rights issue and as a precondition for, and indicator of, sustainable people-centered development.\n\nSource: UN Women\n\nHistorically marginalized people due to race and/or ethnicity is a term used to identify groups of individuals who have been excluded from power, resources, and stability by dominant, often white groups as a result of socially constructed ideas like race and ethnicity (see IRIS+ Glossary terms on these points for further detail).\n\nIn many—but not all—contexts, this term is synonymous with \"people of color,\" which is often the preferred collective term for referring to non-white racial groups. Racial justice advocates have been using the term “people of color” since the late 1970s as an inclusive and unifying frame across different racial groups that are not white, to address racial inequities. While “people of color” can be a politically useful term, and describes people with their own attributes (as opposed to what they are not, e.g., “non-white”), it is also important whenever possible to identify people through their own racial/ethnic group, as each has its own distinct experience and meaning and may be more appropriate.\n\nPartial source: Race Forward, “Race Reporting Guide” (2015).\n\nRefers to two types of workers who carry out paid work in or around their homes:\n\nHomeworkers: Dependent, subcontracted workers who work directly or indirectly for employers or their intermediaries, usually on a piece-rate basis, also known as piece-rate workers, outworkers, or workers in the putting-out system.\n\nSelf-employed, own-account workers: Independent workers who design, produce and market their own products but who cannot be considered to be running small businesses.\n\nThe terms home-based work and home work do not include:\n\nUnpaid care work in one’s own home.\n\nPaid domestic work and care work in the households of others.\n\nSubsistence production for household consumption.\n\nSource: \"Home-based Workers: Decent Work and Social Protection Through Organization and Empowerment.\" ILO, 2015.\n\nThemes in Agriculture include strategic objectives and delivery models that aim to provide individuals and enterprises with consistent access to the materials, knowledge, market connections, and other supports needed to prepare for, adapt to, and recover from challenges that arise from dependence on land for subsistence, nutrition, and profit. Themes in Agriculture also include strategic objectives and delivery models that seek to minimize over-consumption of land-based raw materials by conserving natural resources, ensure that consumptive and non-consumptive uses are restorative, do not impair the long-term sustainability of that use by negatively affecting the ecosystem, ecosystem services, and species on which the use depends and the sharing of benefits arising out of these activities equitably.\n\nSource: IRIS+ Thematic Taxonomy\n\nThemes in Climate include strategic objectives and delivery models that seek to limit the magnitude of climate change effects on the planet through activities that mitigate the results of human (anthropogenic) emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), reduce the vulnerability of social and biological systems to sudden changes in the climate and thus offset the effects of global warming. Themes in Climate may also include strategic objectives and delivery models that seek to improve people’s and the planet’s ability to maintain function in the face of external stresses imposed upon it by climate change and/or adapt systems leaving them better prepared for future climate change impacts and the sharing of benefits arising out of these activities equitably.\n\nSource: IRIS+ Thematic Taxonomy\n\nThemes in Real Estate include strategic objectives and delivery models that seek to provide housing projects, services, and infrastructure for which the associated financial costs are at a level that do not threaten or compromise the occupants’ enjoyment of other human rights and basic needs and that represents a reasonable proportion of an individual's overall income. Themes in Real Estate also include strategic objectives and delivery models that seek to develop or rehabilitate buildings in a way that minimizes or reduces negative environmental impacts and the sharing of benefits arising out of these activities equitably.\n\nSource: IRIS+ Thematic Taxonomy\n\nIRIS+ uses impact themes to classify the types of strategic objectives or approaches investors or enterprises employ to achieve the primary social and/or environmental effect they intend to deliver. Each thematic category is designed to aid in describing a purpose-driven approach to contribute to impact within a broader impact category. Each theme is based on macroeconomic topics and/or trends that an investor can use to identify and assess strong investment opportunities or that an enterprise can use to frame and communicate its work. Under the IRIS+ taxonomy, impact themes have been classified within the list of industries noted above.\n\nImpact themes included in IRIS+ include:\n\nAccess to Quality Education\n\nAccess to Quality Health Care\n\nAffordable Quality Housing\n\nBiodiversity & Ecosystem Conservation\n\nClean Air\n\nClean Energy\n\nClimate Mitigation\n\nClimate Resilience and Adaptation\n\nEnergy Access\n\nEnergy Efficiency\n\nFinancial Inclusion\n\nFood Security\n\nGender Lens\n\nGreen Buildings\n\nLand Conservation\n\nLand Restoration\n\nMarine Resources Conservation & Management\n\nNatural Resources Conservation\n\nNutrition\n\nPollution Prevention\n\nQuality Jobs\n\nResilient Infrastructure\n\nSmallholder Agriculture\n\nSustainable Agriculture\n\nSustainable Land Management\n\nSustainable Forestry\n\nSustainable Water Resources Management\n\nWaste Management\n\nWater, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)\n\nSource: IRIS+ Thematic Taxonomy\n\nIndigenous populations are composed of the existing descendants of the peoples who inhabited the present territory of a country wholly or partially at the time when persons of a different culture or ethnic origin arrived there from other parts of the world, overcame them and, by conquest, settlement, or other means, reduced them to a non-dominant or colonial condition.\n\nThese groups often now live more in conformity with their particular social, economic, and cultural customs and traditions than with the institutions of the country of which they now form part, but under a State structure which incorporates mainly national, social, and cultural characteristics of other segments of the population which are predominant. For example, indigenous groups include Maori in territory now defined as New Zealand; Mexicans in territory now defined as Texas, California, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, and parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, and Oklahoma; and Native American tribes in territory now defined as the United States.\n\nIndigenous peoples are inheritors and practitioners of unique cultures and ways of relating to people and the environment. They have retained social, cultural, economic and political characteristics that are distinct from those of the dominant societies in which they live. Despite their cultural differences, indigenous peoples from around the world share common problems related to the protection of their rights as distinct peoples. Indigenous peoples have sought recognition of their identities, way of life and their right to traditional lands, territories, and natural resources for years, yet throughout history, their rights have consistently been violated. Indigenous peoples today are arguably among the most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of people in the world.\n\nSource:\n\n“Indigenous Peoples at the United Nations For Indigenous Peoples.” United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Indigenous Peoples.

Each cross-thematic lens is designed to describe a purpose-driven approach to contribute to impact using the lens within any IRIS+ impact theme to which it is applied. Each lens is based on macroeconomic topics and/or trends that an investor can use to identify and assess strong investment opportunities or that an enterprise can use to frame and communicate its work.\n\nLenses included in IRIS+ include:\n\nRacial Equity\n\nEncompasses formal and informal learning from early childhood and basic education through to adult learning, combining foundational skills, social and cognitive skills (such as learning to learn), and the skills needed for specific jobs, occupations, or sectors. Lifelong learning involves more than the skills needed to work; it also concerns developing the capabilities needed to participate in a democratic society. Lifelong learning offers a pathway to inclusion in labor markets for youth and the unemployed and has transformative potential: investment in learning at an early age facilitates learning at later stages in life, linked in turn to intergenerational social mobility, expanding the choices of future generations.\n\nSource: \"Work for a Brighter Future.\" ILO Global Commission on the Future of Work, 2019.\n\nLow-income people are individuals or households living above the poverty line but below the national median income. Organizations should clearly footnote the poverty and median income thresholds used and the sources referenced, as the definition for “low income” is dependent on the economic status of the country they live in. For more information about poverty lines and Purchasing Power Parity visit: Poverty Index.\n\nFor U.S. individuals, some sources define low-income as: individuals whose annual (gross) income does not exceed 80% of the median family income for the area (adjusted for family size). Please refer to HUD standards.\n\nCommonly used tools to help determine the poverty level of households include:\n\nPoverty Probability Index® (PPI®): The PPI consists of a short set of easy-to-answer questions, which are scored and then converted to a likelihood that the household is below an established poverty line.\n\nFINCA Client Assessment Tool (FCAT): The FCAT uses survey instruments tailored to FINCA’s mission to collect data directly from a representative sample of randomly chosen borrowers. FCAT data includes income sources and dependents, monthly household expenditures, and daily per capita expenditures and poverty levels.\n\nEquityTool: The EquityTool is a simple tool to measure relative wealth. Using a short survey, the EquityTool allows you to compare the wealth of your respondents to the national or urban population in over 30 countries based on the Wealth Index. This tool provides results in terms of relative poverty (in quintiles).\n\nAs many poverty estimation tools require sampling or other estimation techniques, organizations that rely on assumptions should footnote details used in the calculation process. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns via a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of poor clients based on government data on poverty levels based the geography of units sold. Details on how and why these assumptions were made should be footnoted.\n\nThe lowest wage permitted by law or by a special agreement (such as with a labor union). Note that a minimum wage differs from a living wage, which also takes into account external factors such as the local cost of living and number of dependents.\n\nSince the minimum wage varies according to geography, IRIS does not define a minimum wage. Organizations can refer to the following resources for further guidance on defining their local minimum wage:\n\nWageIndicator.org: The Wage Indicator website aims to provide real, strong wage data for operations in all countries. Its nation-based web pages function as online, up-to-date labor market libraries.\n\nFair Wage Guide: The Fair Wage Guide provides access to wage and pricing information for various countries. It helps users calculate local wages and compare them to local and international standards.\n\nNote that organizations can cite other sources that provide more accurate information based on more immediately local circumstances and laws. Organizations should specify the industry/city/country for which they are citing the minimum wage and should reference the source of the minimum local wage they use. Organizations should footnote details used in the calculation process.\n\nOften the preferred collective term for referring to non-white racial groups, particularly in the United States (though the term is used elsewhere as well). Racial justice advocates have been using the term “people of color” since the late 1970s as an inclusive and unifying frame across different racial groups that are not white, to address racial inequities.\n\nWhile “people of color” can be a politically useful term and describes people with their own attributes (as opposed to what they are not, e.g., “non-white”), it is also important whenever possible to identify people through their own racial/ethnic group, as each has its own distinct experience and meaning and may be more appropriate.\n\nIn some geographies, “people of color” may be a less apt term than “historically disadvantaged,” “previously excluded,” or “minority groups.”\n\nSource:\n\n“Race Reporting Guide.” Race Forward, March 20, 2017.\n\nSee also the IRIS+ definitions on White Supremacy, Racial and ethnic identity, and Race.\n\nUsing a consumption-based approach to measure poverty, the poor are defined as individuals or households living below a recognized poverty line. Poverty lines establish the minimum income or expenditure that would meet a household’s basic needs. Commonly recognized poverty lines include (1) the national poverty line set by the national government and (2) the international US $3.20 per person per day expenditure at 2011 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP).*\n\nCommonly used tools to help determine the poverty level of households include:\n\nPoverty Probability Index® (PPI®): The PPI consists of a short set of easy-to-answer questions, which are scored and then converted to a likelihood that the household is below an established poverty line.\n\nFINCA Client Assessment Tool (FCAT): The FCAT uses survey instruments tailored to FINCA’s mission to collect data directly from a representative sample of randomly chosen borrowers.

Relative poverty is measured against other households rather than against an absolute standard.\n\nAn organization is qualified if it is a government entity or a publicly recognized charity or social purpose organization. The organization must be committed to ensuring the conservation purpose of the land. For example, qualified conservation organizations will generally have an established monitoring program such as annual property inspections to ensure compliance with the conservation goals or terms of the legal encumbrances on the land. The organization must also have the resources to enforce the restrictions of the conservation easement. Resources do not necessarily mean cash. Resources may be in the form of volunteer services such as lawyers who provide legal services or people who inspect and prepare monitoring reports.\n\nSource: Adapted from the United States Internal Revenue Service\n\nPeer review/supervision: formal quality performance assessment of staff, either through peer review mechanisms or supervision. Assessments often focus on documentation and record keeping. Emphasizing outcomes measurement and providing structured assessment criteria and forms improve the reliability of these mechanisms.\n\nAudit and feedback: involves assessing how well staff are meeting accepted guidelines or standard practice, often by reviewing patients' charts or other documentation. The most common types of audit and feedback systems are (a) clinical error tracking, (b) guideline adherence monitoring, and (c) stocking and storage monitoring.\n\nChecklists and logs: checklists, prompts, and log sheets are common tools for quality assurance in healthcare. Common examples are safety checklists for surgery and equipment maintenance logs.\n\nElectronic monitoring systems: these systems collect and organize patient health and organizational performance data. They can be used to track patient outcomes, client flows, and manage equipment utilization.\n\nCommunication and education: structured learning and a focus on communication, human factors, and systematized ways of interacting. The most common techniques include classroom or small group-based training methods, conducting practical activities, and work based learning. Communication and education programs can target staff or patients.\n\nGuidelines, protocols, and registries: these tools help provide more integrated, continuous, and evidence-based care. They provide recommendations and instructions for patient management and care.\n\nRace is a made-up social construct, and not an actual biological fact.\n\nRace designations have changed over time. Some groups that are considered “white” in the United States today were considered “non-white” in previous eras, in U.S. Census data and in mass media and popular culture (for example, Irish, Italian, and Jewish people). The same is true in other countries and contexts.\n\nThe way in which racial categorizations are enforced (the shape of racism) has also changed over time. For example, the racial designation of Asian American and Pacific Islander changed four times in the 19th century. That is, they were defined at times as white and at other times as not white. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, as designated groups, have been used by whites at different times in history to compete with African American labor.\n\nSOURCE: Racial Equity Tools Glossary citing PBS, “Race: The Power of an Illusion” (2018–2019 relaunch of 2003 series) and Paul Kivel, Uprooting Racism: How White People Can Work for Racial Justice (Gabriola Island, British Columbia: New Society Publishers, 2002), page 141.\n\nSee also the IRIS+ definition on ethnicity.\n\nRacial justice is the systematic fair treatment of people of all races, resulting in equitable opportunities and outcomes for all. Racial justice—or racial equity—goes beyond “anti-racism.” It is not just the absence of discrimination and inequities, but also the presence of deliberate systems and supports to achieve and sustain racial equity through proactive and preventative measures.\n\nOperationalizing racial justice means reimagining and co-creating a just and liberated world and includes:\n\nunderstanding the history of racism and the system of white supremacy and addressing past harms,\n\nworking in right relationship and accountability in an ecosystem (an issue, sector, or community ecosystem) for collective change,\n\nimplementing interventions that use an intersectional analysis and that impact multiple systems,\n\ncentering Blackness and building community, cultural, economic, and political power of Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC), and\n\napplying the practice of love along with disruption and resistance to the status quo.\n\nIn IRIS+, “justice” is used as a shorthand for equitable outcomes for historically marginalized groups.\n\nSource: Racial Equity Tools Glossary citing Race Forward, “Race Reporting Guide” (2015), Maggie Potapchuk, “Operationalizing Racial Justice in Non-Profit Organizations” (MP Associates, 2020), and Rinku Sen and Lori Villarosa, “Grantmaking with a Racial Justice Lens: A Practical Guide” (Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equity, 2019).\n\n(1) The ability of a system and its component parts to anticipate, absorb, accommodate, or recover from the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner, including through ensuring the preservation, restoration, or improvement of its essential basic structures and functions.

Revenue includes only the gross inflows of monies received and receivable by the organization on its own account. Amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes, goods and services taxes, and value added taxes are not economic benefits which flow to the entity and do not result in increases in equity. Therefore, they are excluded from revenue. Similarly, in an agency relationship, the gross inflows of economic benefits include amounts collected on behalf of the principal and do not result in increases in equity for the entity. The amounts collected on behalf of the principal are not revenue. Instead, revenue is the amount of commission.\n\nSource: Alexander, David, Anne Britton, and Ann Jorissen.

The traditional distinction between urban and rural areas within a country has been based on the assumption that urban areas, no matter how they are defined, provide a different way of life and usually a higher level of living than are found in rural areas. In many industrialized countries, this distinction has become blurred and the principal difference between urban and rural areas in terms of the circumstances of living tends to be a matter of the degree of concentration of population. Although the differences between urban and rural ways of life and standards of living remain significant in developing countries, rapid urbanization in these countries has created a great need for information related to different sizes of urban areas. This is when classification by size of locality can usefully supplement the urban-rural dichotomy or even replace it depending on the circumstances in the country.\n\nSource: United Nations Statistical Commission, Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System, 2013\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are non-subsidiary, independent firms which employ fewer than a given number of employees. This number varies across countries. The most frequent upper limit designating an SME is 250 employees, as in the European Union. However, some countries set the limit at 200 employees, while the United States considers SMEs to include firms with fewer than 500 employees.\n\nSmall firms are generally those with fewer than 50 employees, while micro-enterprises have at most 10, or in some cases 5, workers.\n\nFinancial assets are also used to define SMEs. In the European Union, a new definition came into force on 1 January 2005 applying to all Community acts and funding programmes as well as in the field of State aid where SMEs can be granted higher intensity of national and regional aid than large companies. The new definition provides for an increase in the financial ceilings: the turnover of medium-sized enterprises (50-249 employees) should not exceed EUR 50 million; that of small enterprises (10-49 employees) should not exceed EUR 10 million while that of micro firms (less than 10 employees) should not exceed EUR 2 million. Alternatively, balance sheets for medium, small and micro enterprises should not exceed EUR 43 million, EUR 10 million and EUR 2 million, respectively.\n\nSource: OECD glossary\n\nSmallholder farmers are marginal and sub-marginal farm households constrained in size and resources. Some sources define smallholder farmers as those who cultivate between 1 hectare to 10 hectares (for more semi-arid areas) of land. While they will vary in farm size and crop/livestock distribution according to their activity and region, common characteristics of smallholder farmers are that they have low access to technology, limited resources in terms of capital, skills, and risk management, depend on family labor for most activities, and have limited capacity in terms of storage, marketing, and processing.\n\nOrganizations should detail the characteristics of the smallholders they reference, including the size of land managed.\n\nSource: United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization\n\nSolidarity Group lending refers to the use of groups for disbursement of funds and collection of repayment on loans to either the group as a whole or to the individual members of that group. Borrowers of such groups often bear joint and several liability for the repayment of all loans to the group and its members. This group liability may also determine credit decisions made by the institution. Solidarity Groups vary in the degrees to which they use groups for credit decisions, disbursement, collection, or to reduce credit risk. For IRIS, loans are considered to be of the Solidarity Group methodology when some aspect of loan consideration depends on the group, including credit analysis, liability, guarantee, collateral, and loan size and conditions.\n\nSource: Microfinance Information Exchange\n\nA supportive environment includes physical space, equipment and materials, daily structure and planning, as well as positive and engaged relationships between adults and children. The environment needs to be carefully planned based on knowledge of typical development of children, as well as the specific developmental needs of the population. Many factors influence children’s learning and behavior. Thus, the environment should be thoughtfully designed to be responsive to children’s needs, and should provide opportunities for learning and growth in all developmental domains and curriculum areas. One critical element of a supportive learning environment is active engagement with a parent or caretaker, also known as “serve and return.” For more on serve and return, see Harvard University's Center for the Developing Child, and for more on responsive learning environments, see Teacher Time.\n\nSource: State Government of Massachusetts. “Building Supportive Learning Environments.”\n\nSource: Harvard University's Center for the Developing Child\n\nSustainable cultivation/farming practices commonly include: crop rotations that mitigate weeds, disease, insect, and other pest problems, provide alternative sources of soil nitrogen, reduce soil erosion, and reduce risk of water contamination by agricultural chemicals. Common practices also include pest control strategies that are not harmful to natural systems, farmers, their neighbors, or consumers. This includes integrated pest management techniques that reduce the need for pesticides by practices such as: scouting, use of resistant cultivars, timing of planting, biological pest controls, increased mechanical/biological weed control, more soil and water conservation practices, strategic use of animal and green manures, and use of natural or synthetic inputs in a way that poses no significant hazard to man, animals, or the environment.\n\nSource: United States Department of Agriculture Dictionary\n\nSustainable stewardship is a holistic approach intended over the long term to: enhance environmental quality and the natural resource base; make the most efficient use of nonrenewable resources and integrate, where appropriate, natural biological cycles and controls; sustain the economic viability of working landscapes; and enhance the quality of life for those living and working on the land and society as a whole. Stewardship refers to land management practices as opposed to legal restrictions on the use of the land. Economic activities that take place on sustainably stewarded land may include sustainable farming, ranching, forestry, and recreation. More specifically:\n\nSustainable cultivation: see Sustainable Cultivation.\n\nSustainable forestry: Stewardship and use of forests and forest lands that maintains biodiversity, productivity, and regeneration capacity and fulfills relevant ecological, economic, and social functions. Land use practices typical of sustainable forestry include minimal and highly controlled clear cutting, replanting with native species, and conservation-oriented management of old growth forests.\n\nSustainable ranching: Ranching practices and use of grazing lands that enhance the environmental quality and natural resource base, for example, maintaining biodiversity, productivity, and regeneration capacity and fulfilling relevant ecological, economic and social functions. Sustainable ranching practices include managing grazing patterns to reduce surface compaction, water runoff, and maintain diverse plant communities, riparian habitat, stream stability, soil structure, and nutrient cycles.\n\nSustainable recreation: Hectares open to recreational use, including hunting, fishing, hiking, biking, paddling, winter sports, and other activities in ways that ensure long term maintenance of biodiversity and natural resources. Sustainable recreation management practices include educating visitors on appropriate practices to limit their impact and identifying carrying capacities for visitors and visitor activities such that environmental impacts are within limits of acceptable change, which may include limiting the number of visitors, planning campsites, and restricting vehicles.\n\nSource: IRIS Land Conservation Working Group\n\nThe theory of change (also referred to as the Theory of Value Creation or Logic Model) is an expression of the sequence of cause-and-effect actions or occurrences by which organizational and financial resources are assumed to be converted into the desired social results. It provides a conceptual road map for how an organization expects to achieve its intended impact and is often displayed in a diagram. A framework built around concepts of activities, inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impacts is called a logic model or impact value chain.\n\nSources:\n\nGlobal Steering Group for Impact Investment\n\nBridgespan\n\nAnnie E.

The term threatened is an umbrella term for a group of categories that captures various levels of threat to the species, ranging from vulnerable species to endangered species to critically endangered species.\n\nOrganizations can refer to the following sources for further guidance and for clarification on the classification definitions cited herein:\n\nInternational Union for the Conservation of Nature\n\nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora\n\nTundra is the term applied to the treeless regions beyond the limit of the boreal forest and above the altitudinal limit of trees in high mountain ranges. The timber line which separates forest and tundra in alpine regions corresponds to an arctic transition zone in which trees are increasingly restricted to the most favorable sites. The vegetative cover of the tundra is low, dwarfed, and often forms a complete mat. These plant characteristics are in large part the result of adaptation to the physical environment (one of the most extreme on Earth), where temperatures may average above freezing only one or two months out of the year, where strong desiccating winds may occur, where great variation in solar energy received may exist, and where permafrost is encountered almost everywhere beneath the vegetative cover.\n\nThe Anderson Land Classification System includes the following subcategories of Tundra: shrub and brush tundra, herbaceous tundra, bare ground tundra, wet tundra, and mixed tundra.\n\nSource: Anderson Land Classification System\n\nUsing a consumption-based approach to measure poverty, the very poor are individuals or households living below a recognized extreme poverty line. Poverty lines establish the minimum income or expenditure that would meet a household’s basic needs. The $1.90 per person per day 2011 PPP line is the World Bank’s current definition of extreme poverty. Another commonly used measure of very poor is individuals or households in the bottom 20% of the national population.\n\nCommonly used tools to help determine the poverty level of households include:\n\nPoverty Probability Index® (PPI®): The PPI consists of a short set of easy-to-answer questions, which are scored and then converted to a likelihood that the household is below an established poverty line.\n\nFINCA Client Assessment Tool (FCAT): The FCAT uses survey instruments tailored to FINCA’s mission to collect data directly from a representative sample of randomly chosen borrowers. FCAT data includes income sources and dependents, monthly household expenditures, and daily per capita expenditures and poverty levels.\n\nEquityTool: The EquityTool is a simple tool to measure relative wealth. Using a short survey, the EquityTool allows you to compare the wealth of your respondents to the national or urban population in over 30 countries based on the Wealth Index. This tool provides results in terms of relative poverty (in quintiles).\n\nOrganizations should clearly footnote the poverty thresholds used, the sources referenced, and ensure that the unit of measure (individual or household) matches the organization’s definition of target stakeholders. As many poverty estimation tools require sampling or other estimation techniques, organizations that rely on assumptions should footnote details used in the calculation process. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns via a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of poor clients based on government data on poverty levels based the geography of units sold. Details on how and why these assumptions were made should be footnoted.\n\n*Sourced from The World Bank and their World Development Indicators.\n\nEconomic viability allows for a triple bottom line impact, including an array of social and environmental factors. These enterprises tend to be the sole, or an important, contributor to the owners’/operators’ family income once past the start-up stage, and they must be profitable in order to do so. Owners/operators of viable enterprises understand and can articulate their mission and vision, know in what direction they want to take their businesses, and are successful in meeting their goals, even if those goals shift over time with changing markets, competition, family situations, etc. This definition does not exclude non-profit–owned enterprises. Such enterprises must still cover their costs in order to be viable, but the non-profit may bring in funds to subsidize educational activities or other mission-based programming that complements the farm or food enterprise.\n\nSource:\n\n“The Blueprint: Building a Business Assistance Network for Farm and Food Businesses.” Hudson Valley AgriBusiness Development Corporation, the Vermont Farm & Forest Viability Program, The Carrot Project, The Joyce and Irving Goldman Family Foundation, The John Merck Fund, October 2018.\n\nVillage Banking and Self-Help Groups refer to methodologies that provide access to credit and savings services through group or community managed associations. Loans from microfinance institutions (MFIs) are considered of this type when the MFI lends to the group, which in turn uses this money to lend to its members. Loans to the Village Bank or Self-Help Group are made under the collective guarantee of the group. Loans may also be made from the retained profits of the group or from group members' savings. These loans are considered internal to the Village Bank or Self-Help Group.\n\nSource: Microfinance Information Exchange\n\nWater conservation refers to efforts made to preserve, control, develop water resources, and prevent pollution. This may include reducing the total amount of water needed to carry out current processes or tasks but does not include overall reduction in water consumption from reduced organizational activities (e.g., partial outsourcing of production). Conservation efforts include organizational or technological innovations that allow a defined process or task to consume water more efficiently. This includes improved water management practices, process redesign, the conversion and retrofitting of equipment (e.g., water-efficient equipment), or the elimination of unnecessary water use due to changes in behavior.\n\nSource: Adapted from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\n\nAn imbalance between the supply and demand of freshwater as a result of a high level of demand compared to available supply, under prevailing institutional arrangements (including price) and infrastructural conditions.\n\nPhysical water scarcity occurs when natural water bodies have insufficient water, whether caused by natural conditions (for example, in arid regions) or by excessive water abstraction for human use. Economic water scarcity occurs when supply to humans is insufficient despite water being naturally abundant. This results from under-investment in water supply infrastructure, whether due to poverty or mismanagement.\n\nSources: OECD. Water Resources Allocation: Sharing Risks and Opportunities.

For groundwater, it may be a natural spring, a borehole or water well. For surface water, it is a ‘water intake’. It can also include the immediate surrounding zone of the main water body, in effect, the zone that feeds the point of abstraction. It may apply to multiple abstraction points where they are associated, for example, a wellfield.\n\nSource: Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Global Wetland Outlook: State of the World’s Wetlands and their Services to People. Gland, Switzerland: Ramsar Convention Secretariat, 2018.\n\nWetlands are those areas where the water table is at, near, or above the land surface for a significant part of most years. The hydrologic regime is such that aquatic or hydrophytic vegetation is usually established, although alluvial and tidal flats may be nonvegetated. Wetlands are frequently associated with topographic lows, even in mountainous regions. Examples of wetlands include: marshes, mudflats, and swamps situated on the shallow margins of bays, lakes, ponds, streams, and manmade impoundments such as reservoirs. They also include wet meadows or perched bogs in high mountain valleys and seasonally wet or flooded basins, playas, or potholes with no surface water outflow. Shallow water areas where aquatic vegetation is submerged are classified as open water and are not included in the Wetland category.\n\nExtensive parts of some river flood plains qualify as Wetlands, as do regularly flooded irrigation overflow areas. These do not include agricultural land where seasonal wetness or short-term flooding may provide an important component of the total annual soil moisture necessary for crop production. Areas in which soil wetness or flooding is so short-lived that no typical wetlands vegetation is developed properly belong in other categories.\n\nCultivated wetlands such as the flooded fields associated with rice production and developed cranberry bogs are classified as Agricultural Land.\n\nUncultivated wetlands from which wild rice, cattails, wood products, and so forth are harvested or wetlands grazed by livestock are retained in the Wetland category. Wetland areas drained for any purpose belong to other land use and land cover categories such as Agricultural Land, Rangeland, Forest Land, or Urban or Built-up Land. When the drainage is discontinued and such use ceases, classification may revert to Wetland. The Anderson Land Classification System includes two subcategories of Wetland: Forested and Nonforested.\n\nSource: Anderson Land Classification System\n\nThe idea (ideology) that white people and the ideas, thoughts, beliefs, and actions of white people are superior to people of color and their ideas, thoughts, beliefs, and actions.\n\nWhile most people associate white supremacy with extremist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the neo-Nazis, white supremacy is ever-present in our institutional and cultural assumptions that assign value, morality, goodness, and humanity to the white group while casting people and communities of color as worthless, immoral, bad, and inhuman and \"undeserving.\" Drawing from critical race theory, the term \"white supremacy\" also refers to a political or socio-economic system where white people enjoy structural advantage and rights that other racial and ethnic groups do not, both at a collective and an individual level.\n\nSource:\n\n“Racism Defined.” dRworksBook, n.d.\n\nSee also the IRIS+ definition on Structural Racism.\n\n(1) workers whose contract of employment leads to classification as belonging to the groups of “casual workers,” “short-term workers,” or “seasonal workers\"; (2) workers whose contract of employment allows employing enterprise or person to terminate the contract at short notice and/or at will, with the specific circumstances determined by national legislation and custom. In the first case, workers may be classified as “employees” or “own-account workers” according to the characteristics of the employment contract.\n\nWorkers under the first category include:\n\n● Casual workers: contracts are not expected to continue for more than a very short period.\n\n● Seasonal workers: contract duration is influenced by seasonal factors, such as climate, public holidays, and agricultural season.\n\n● Short-term workers: contracts are expected to last for a short period, but longer than those of casual workers.\n\nSource: \"Decent Work Indicators - Guidelines for Producers and Users of Statistical and Legal Framework Indicators.\" ILO, 2013."
