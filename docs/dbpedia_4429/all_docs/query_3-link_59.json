        "text": "Guidance\n\nGeneral background\n\nAlmost 40% of the UK’s energy consumption and carbon emissions come from the way our buildings are heated and used. Even comparatively small changes in energy performance and the way a building is used will have a significant effect in reducing energy consumption.\n\nThe principle underlying the energy performance of buildings is to make the energy efficiency of buildings transparent through the provision of energy certificates and to show how the energy efficiency of the building can be improved.\n\nRegulatory context\n\nThe requirement for domestic and non-domestic EPCs and DECs was introduced in stages from 2007. Apart from a few exempted buildings, a building must have an EPC when constructed, sold or let. Larger buildings occupied by a public authority and frequently visited by the public must have an energy certificate (referred to as a Display Energy Certificate (DEC) in England and Wales). Regulatory and administrative amendments made since the requirements came into effect have altered the content, format and accessibility of data lodged on the Energy Performance of Buildings Register (the register) for England and Wales.\n\nThe requirement for buildings over 1,000 square meters occupied by public authorities and frequently visited by the public to have a DEC came into effect on 1 October 2008. This size threshold was lowered to buildings over 500 square meters on 9 January 2013. In July 2015 the floor area size threshold was lowered to include buildings over 250 square meters.\n\nCoverage\n\nThe department transitioned to a new register service in September 2020. This service now exports the data from a single register. Data is drawn from EPCs issued for domestic and non-domestic buildings constructed, sold or let since 2008. Data from DECs issued for buildings occupied by public authorities also dates to 2008. It provides information on the energy efficiency ratings of domestic and non-domestic buildings during the energy assessment process. This data release includes data for buildings with multiple EPCs or DECs as well as for buildings where only a single energy certificate has been issued. The register does not hold data for every domestic and non-domestic building, or every building occupied by public authorities, in England and Wales. This data should, therefore, not be interpreted as a true representation of the whole of the building stock in England and Wales but be viewed as part of a wider package of Government’s provision of information on the energy efficiency of buildings.\n\nDECs that can be identified as ‘voluntary’, some private sector organisations may choose to have a DEC even though they are not mandated by the regulations, may affect statistical and data outputs. Therefore, ‘voluntary’ DECs are excluded from the published dataset.\n\nTechnical notes about the data\n\nOriginally, for domestic buildings accredited energy assessors had the option of lodging the underlying data used to produce the energy certificate in addition to the PDF document of the final energy certificate itself. After September 2008, lodging the data became a mandatory requirement. For non-domestic buildings the lodgement of data has always been a mandatory requirement. The department has, therefore, chosen only to publish data from 1 October 2008.\n\nThe department has also chosen not to publish any data where:\n\n• the holder of the energy certificate has ‘opted-out’ of disclosure\n\n• energy certificates are excluded on grounds of national security\n\n• energy certificates are marked as ‘cancelled’ or ‘not for issue’\n\n• DECs that can be identified as ‘voluntary’ (some organisations choose to have a DEC produced even though they are not required to do so by the regulations) are also excluded\n\nThe department will publish register data every four to six months for new EPCs and DECs or where the status of the EPC or DEC has changed.\n\nDue to third-party intellectual property rights, address level data is published under a copyright and database right information notice which defines the purposes for which the data can be used.\n\nAs part of the November 2021 publication, we have allocated UPRNs (Unique Property Reference Numbers) to the data and shall endeavour to release UPRNs as part of future publications. Whilst we have confidence in the UPRNs we release, errors might occur resulting in incorrectly assigned or missing UPRNs. Please read our blog post for more details.\n\nData quality\n\nPrimary responsibility for the robustness of the data in relation to individual buildings lies with the energy assessor who carried out the energy assessment and the energy assessor’s accreditation scheme. Additional validation checks are undertaken as the data is lodged on the register and improved quality assurance procedures for energy assessor accreditation schemes have been introduced.\n\nThe data cannot be altered once it has been lodged on the register, although it can be marked at ‘not for issue’ or ‘cancelled’ for a range of reasons by the energy assessor’s accreditation scheme. The data has been published without any changes or alterations.\n\nUsers are asked to recognise that there may be anomalies in the published data. In the short term, DLUHC is unable to rectify any anomalies in the existing published datasets. However, we are considering ways in which to correct any anomalies in the long term.\n\nPotential anomalies may include the following:\n\nIssue Definition ‘INVALID’ fields Invalid reports are where the value provided is out of bounds, e.g. a negative energy rating of -1199 or a non-integer, there is no valid energy band for this, so it is marked as INVALID! ‘NO DATA!’ When the energy certificate was first lodged on the register there was no requirement to lodge this data item, i.e. a non-mandatory item. ‘N/A’ Input value supplied by the software which has produced the energy certificate. ‘Not recorded’ A value generated by the register to account for a data item that was not mandatory when the lodgement of the energy certificate occurred. When the data item became mandatory the register operator, for backwards compatibility purposes, populated the data field with a value of ‘not recorded’ to ensure that the energy certificate retrieval process is successfully completed. Mandatory data items cannot be applied retrospectively to energy certificates lodged before the date of the change. Operational Ratings equal to ‘9999’ The data also contains DECs with an operational rating of ‘9999’ (a ‘default’ DEC). The production of a ‘default’ DEC value was allowed to enable building occupiers, with poor quality or no energy data, the opportunity to comply with the regulations. From April 2011 the ability to lodge a ‘default’ DEC was no longer allowed. ‘Blank’ Building Emission Rate The Building Emission Rate (BER) data field for non-domestic buildings may contain a ‘blank’ value. The BER was only lodged on the register from 7 March 2010. Data containing the words ‘for backward compatibility only’ Where values in a ‘pick’ list that have been superseded by another value. For example, where a value for ‘pitched roof’ has been replaced by three sub-categories of pitched roof. The original value is retained but ‘for backward compatibility only’ it is appended to ensure that the energy certificate retrieval process can be successfully completed. Replacement data items cannot be applied retrospectively to energy certificates lodged on the register before the date of the change. Local Authority ‘NULL’ value There are currently just over 8,600 records where the local authority identifier is ‘null’. This is due to the Register Operator not being able to match the building address in the Markermap Ordinance Survey (GB) lookup tables or OS MasterMap Address Layer 2 data. The majority of these addresses have been requested manually by energy assessors for inclusion by the Register Operator in the registers (e.g. new builds, etc). These records are being published for completeness. An ongoing process to manage these manually added addresses will take time to develop to deal with these and future anomalies. Multiple field ‘NULL’ values There are several fields within the lodged data where it is possible to enter multiple entries to cater for different types of build within a single property, i.e. extensions. This results in multiple entries for the description fields for floor, roof and wall. For the purposes of this data release only the information contained within the first of these multiple entries is being provided. As there are no restrictions on the value in this first field it means that sometimes the first field in a multiple entry description field may contain a ‘null’ value. A resolution to correct these anomalies will be considered for future data releases. Extreme values Higher than expected values for certain data variables, such as CO2 emissions; current and potential heating costs, may be caused by a combination of anomalous data entries and functionality issues with proprietary software. Although it’s not possible to identify what proportion of extreme values are anomalous, to account for this, data users may wish to apply the ‘median’ when looking at averages in their analysis, as a way of quality assuring the ‘mean’ to account for any extreme values\n\nIn spite of these data quality issues, we are publishing this information because we believe it to be of value to the public.\n\nUser engagement\n\nUsers are encouraged to provide feedback on how this data are used and how well they meet user needs. Comments on any issues relating to this publication are welcomed and encouraged. Comments about the published data and other data enquiries should be sent to: EPC.Enquiry@communities.gov.uk\n\nAny questions about the quality of the data or the reasons for multiple EPCs may be referred to the appropriate accreditation scheme as these issues cannot be resolved by the data publication team.\n\nGlossary of Terms\n\nThis section provides provides a mapping between the displayed field name and the COLUMN_NAME in the downloads, along with a description (where available).

To do so, would mean DLUHC would be in contravention of its own regulations.\n\nWhy do I need to sign up to use this site?\n\nThe data available contains personal information covered by the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation, as well as data under a restrictive licence. DLUHC is required to confirm that users have understood and agreed to these, as well as collecting the details of those who have requested access.\n\nHow can I use the data?\n\nThe guidance notes provide some background on this data release. If you're a software developer, we have an API for accessing the data programmatically.\n\nWhy don't I have a password?\n\nOnce you've signed up, each time you use the site thereafter, you can just enter your email address to receive a link which will provide you with a session in the application. We didn't want to ask users to have to remember yet another password, so we opted for a password-free approach.\n\nWhy can't I search by property type on Display Energy Certificates (DECs)?\n\nFor Display Energy Certificates, the property type field contains a wide variety of data, which makes it difficult to provide a user-friendly search widget.\n\nWhat are the licence and copyright restrictions on the data?\n\nThe details of the licence and copyright for the data are covered in the licence & copyright page.\n\nWhy are you publishing personal data?\n\nThe department appreciates the value of information about the energy performance of buildings to researchers, local authorities and environmental organisations and believes it is in the public interest to make this information available. The department has carefully considered the privacy risk and will keep the data privacy impact assessment under review.\n\nWho will you share my sign-up details with?\n\nYour information is collected during the user registration process and will be held in accordance with the Privacy Policy notice. It will not be disclosed to any third party except where we may be required to share information with Royal Mail in relation to the licensing conditions.\n\nCan you give me some advice on what I'm allowed to do with the data?\n\nThe Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities (DLUHC) cannot provide legal advice. Therefore, it is important to read the information in the Data Protection Act 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation and the copyright and database right information notice. It will be for individuals themselves to take a view on how they are able to use the data and in cases of doubt should seek their own legal advice. Please note that this data contains personal data. If processing falls within the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation, or the Data Protection Act 2018, you will become a data controller and must comply with the data protection legislation.\n\nWhat can I do if I suspect someone has misused my personal data?\n\nAnyone who suspects that personal data has been misused, for example you may have been the recipient of unwanted direct marketing, should report their concerns to DLUHC and to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).\n\nHow do I associate a certificate with its recommendations in the downloads?\n\nDLUHC provides a field called LMK_KEY which they use to identify the certificates, and to associate recommendations with their certificates. These are used in the URLs of this application, the downloads and API. We have made changes to the data and API which will result in a unique LMK KEY. You can read more about the changes here.\n\nHow do I uniquely identify a certificate?\n\nWe have made changes to the data and API which will result in a unique LMK KEY. You can read more about the changes here.\n\nOur intention is to update data monthly, typically during the final working week of each month. Please note that there may be instances where this isn't possible due to issues beyond our control.\n\nWhy does some data look incorrect or missing?\n\nThis service republishes the data as supplied by DLUHC. The data on this site is refreshed periodically, and EPC holders can opt out of having their data published.\n\nWhere can I opt out my EPC?\n\nHolders of EPCs may opt-out by contacting the helpdesk: email: mhclg.digital-services@communities.gov.uk or phone: 020 3829 0748. Requests to opt-out on the register will be processed as soon as possible. However, in respect of the data on this site your EPC can only be opted-out from a future data release, which are expected to be updated monthly.\n\nWhere can I find more information about opt out?\n\nThe EPC opt-out of public disclosure guidance provides more information.\n\nWhy are the search results sometimes limited?\n\nWe've pre-prepared downloads of the full register, and for individual authorities, but all other requests are served dynamically by our database and application. We've chosen to limit the size of dynamic queries to help us maintain a stable and responsive service. If you need to retrieve more than our limit, we suggest you download the entire register and filter the results offline in your software of choice.\n\nIs it possible to download certificates for a single local authority?\n\nYes. As the full register (especially for domestic EPCs) is very large, we've pre-prepared downloads of the certificate data by each local authority. If you filter by local authority only, the results download will contain the full set of certificates for that authority.\n\nWhat changes have you made to the API?\n\nWe have removed the CERTIFICATE_HASH field in favour of using a new set of LMK_KEYs to uniquely identify certificates. Please read our blog post for more details.\n\nWill some buildings have more than one EPC?\n\nA building may have more than one EPC for valid reasons.\n\nWhy isn’t the most recent EPC being published for each building?\n\nIt has been decided to publish all EPCs for the same building to enable data users to easily identify improved energy efficiency trends. It will also enable data users to identify unusual lodgement patterns.\n\nWhy aren’t multiple EPCs removed from the register?\n\nThe regulations do not permit the department or the register operator to remove data that has been lodged on the registers.\n\nWhat action is being taken to reduce the number of multiple EPCs?\n\nEnergy assessors and the energy assessor’s accreditation scheme are responsible for reducing the number of multiple EPCs. We will work with energy assessor accreditation schemes to identify why some buildings have multiple EPCs and, where an error has been identified, to mark the EPCs as ‘not for issue’ or ‘cancelled’.\n\nDo all public authority buildings require a DEC?\n\nNo, a DEC is only required for buildings occupied by public authorities over 250 square meters where that building is frequently visited by the public.\n\nDoes the DEC dataset include ‘voluntary’ DECs?\n\nDECs that can be identified as ‘voluntary’, some private sector organisations may choose to have a DEC even though they are not mandated by the regulations, may affect statistical and data outputs. Therefore, ‘voluntary’ DECs are excluded from the published dataset.\n\nWhat is the Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN)?"
