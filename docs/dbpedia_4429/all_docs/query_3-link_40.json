        "text": "Area-Based Energy Efficiency Schemes\n\nDepending on where you live, there may be support available to you in order to improve the energy efficiency of your home.\n\nEnergy Company Obligation (ECO)\n\nThe Energy Company Obligation (ECO) is a UK government energy efficiency scheme led by the private sector in Great Britain to tackle fuel poverty and help reduce carbon emissions. Funded by major energy suppliers, the 4th version of this project, ECO4, will help householders save on their energy bills and reduce carbon emissions. The scheme will operate until 2026.\n\nScarf deliver the scheme on behalf of participating Local Authorities and manage the referral process to our Approved Framework of ECO4 contractors.\n\nIn order to benefit from ECO4 your property will need to require energy efficiency upgrades. The specific measures that would benefit your home would be determined by a retrofit assessment. You must own your own home or have permission from your landlord. Eligible households may be entitled to free or low-cost measures to improve the energy efficiency of their home.\n\nUnder the ECO4 Flexibility programme, participating local authorities can refer private tenure households that it considers to be living in fuel poverty or on a low income and vulnerable to the effects of living in a cold home.\n\nIf the household is eligible, supporting evidence will be collected. After that participating Councils will provide the sign-off (declaration).\n\nFull Eligibility criteria are outlined in the Local Authorities Statement of Intent:\n\nAberdeen City\n\nAberdeenshire\n\nAngus\n\nPerth & Kinross\n\nDundee City\n\nMoray\n\nEligibility to be referred forward for a contractor survey is generally based upon a gross household income of Â£31,000 or less and must have an energy efficiency rating of D or less: (https://www.scottishepcregister.org.uk/ ).\n\nThe inclusion of a household in a local authority declaration/referral does not guarantee a measure will be installed in their home by an energy supplier. Decisions by energy suppliers on whether to install a measure may depend on:\n\nA survey carried out by suppliers, or their agents/contractors and installation costs calculated,\n\nThe energy savings that can be achieved for a property,\n\nWhether suppliers have achieved, or are close to achieving, their targets, and\n\nOther commercial considerations.\n\nSuppliers will carry out an assessment to decide which measures their property should receive. Residents will likely expect to receive multiple measures due to Minimum Requirements.\n\nReferrals for ECO4 will only be accepted from Home Energy Scotland (HES)/ Scarf/ Council/ Approved ECO 4 Framework Contractor.\n\nScarf and HES telephone advisors can answer questions about heating and insulating your home, saving money and cutting costs.
