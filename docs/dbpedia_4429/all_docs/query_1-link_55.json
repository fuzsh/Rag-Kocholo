        "text": "The National Emergency Plan for Fuel (NEP-F) is produced by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). It sets out government’s options, priorities and principles in responding to a major fuel supply disruption in Great Britain. The NEP-F details a wide range of measures, both statutory and non-statutory, that can be implemented by government to support industry in responding to any disruption. The principal aim is to maintain fuel supplies as close to normal levels as possible. As with all decisions concerning the use of Emergency Plans, there are clear objectives which lie behind it and which the possible measures are designed to address, namely to:\n\nprotect human life and, as far as possible, property\n\nalleviate suffering\n\nsupport the continuity of everyday activity and the restoration of disrupted services at the earliest opportunity\n\nuphold the rule of law and democratic process\n\nThe majority of potential fuel supply disruptions can be addressed by measures to help industry maintain fuel supply; these would be deployed by DESNZ in co-ordination with industry and other government departments. However, the government does have emergency powers under the Energy Act 1976, which it can use to control supply and demand of petroleum products. It should be noted that use of these emergency powers is reserved for the most severe of disruptions.\n\nOnly when an incident has the potential to cause significant and widespread disruption to oil supply will government consider activating measures within the NEP-F. The decision to activate the measures in the NEP-F can only be taken at a national level and would be led by DESNZ, as the government department responsible for energy resilience. Local Resilience Fora and relevant organisations providing essential services are expected to have robust business continuity plans in place that take into account of their own local and organisational context. Business continuity plans should align in principle to the NEP-F but not rely on early activation of the NEP-F measures.\n\nThe main tools within the NEP-F are summarised below. Which measures are activated will depend on the specific disruption scenario, with a preference for the least invasive measure first.\n\nMeasures to maintain fuel supply\n\nDownstream Oil Industry Protocol: which, when activated, temporarily exempts industry from the Competition Act 1998 for the purpose of optimising supply in the event of a disruption and allows for information sharing, joint planning and co-ordinated supply action.\n\nReserve Tanker Fleet: Government has access to a reserve fleet of fuel tanker vehicles that can be deployed at short notice to provide additional capacity to industry contingency arrangements.\n\nReserve Tanker Drivers: Government works with the downstream oil industry, including haulage companies, to maintain a capability within the Armed Forces to make fuel deliveries in the event of a serious disruption to normal deliveries. This work ensures that military personnel could be efficiently and safely deployed.\n\nRelaxation of drivers’ hours: This is usually in response to a specific incident and would be limited to specific transport operations within a confined time period. This must be requested by industry and can only be approved by Department for Transport (DfT).\n\nOil stocks release: The UK is obligated to hold emergency oil stocks. These can be released to provide additional supply. This would only be used in the event of a significant disruption to global supply to calm the market.\n\nMeasures to control supply and demand of fuels\n\nThese measures would only be activated in the event of a severe national fuel supply shortage.\n\nDesignated Filling Station scheme: Emergency and critical service vehicles would be given priority access to road fuel from filling stations designated by the relevant Local Resilience Forum (Resilience Partnership in Scotland).\n\nBulk Distribution Scheme: Oil companies and fuel distributors can be directed to prioritise the delivery of bulk petroleum products to critical services such as emergency services, utilities and public transport.\n\nCommercial Distribution Scheme: Oil companies and fuel distributors can be directed to prioritise the supply of road diesel to the commercial vehicles sector to support the operation of key supply chains, such as food and health.\n\nMaximum Purchase Scheme: This restricts the sale of road fuels at retail filling stations to the public to a maximum amount per visit to ensure that all motorists have access to some fuel. The scheme can also limit the hours in which road fuels can be sold."
