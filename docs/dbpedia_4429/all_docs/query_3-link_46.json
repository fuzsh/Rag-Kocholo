        "text": "It's the responsibility of our Energy and Sustainability service to:\n\nmanage, control and monitor energy and water usage throughout the council\n\nto promote energy efficiency to our employees and partners\n\nThe team contributes to the creation of a 'cleaner, greener, safer community' for North Ayrshire, through their dedication to reducing the council's carbon emissions.\n\nFind out what we are doing to tackle climate change and meet the Scottish Government's 2050 carbon gas reduction target of 80%, in our Environmental Sustainability & Climate Change Strategy 2021-23 (PDF, 697KB).\n\nWe have implemented a programme of solar panel and biomass boiler installations across our schools and public buildings.\n\nLocal Heat and Energy Efficiency Strategy\n\nOur Local Heat and Energy Efficiency Strategy (LHEES) and Delivery Plan has been developed in line with Scottish Government guidance to identify North Ayrshire’s heat demand, set actions on decarbonising heat and poor energy efficiency.\n\nOur LHEES is primarily driven by Scotland's national statutory targets:\n\nto achieve net zero emissions by 2045 with a 75 per cent reduction by 2030\n\nby 2040, as far as reasonably possible, that no more than 5 per cent of households will be in fuel poverty and no more than 1 per cent of households in Scotland in extreme fuel poverty\n\nThe Local Heat and Energy Efficiency Strategy (PDF, 7.5mb) sets out the council’s long-term plan for decarbonising heat and improving the energy efficiency of both domestic and non-domestic buildings throughout North Ayrshire. Further background information is available in the LHEES Strategy Appendix (PDF, 7.8mb).\n\nThe LHEES Delivery Plan (PDF, 168kb) sets out the proposed actions that the council will aim to progress. It is a working document with actions to assist the delivery of net zero and reduce fuel poverty across North Ayrshire.\n\nIf you require any further information, please contact the council’s Sustainability Team.\n\nEnergy Smart: Energy Efficiency Measures\n\nThe Council’s Energy Smart programme of energy efficiency measures supports privately-owned and private tenant households in North Ayrshire on low incomes to boost insulation within their properties.\n\nThe Energy Smart funding pot of £1.5 million is part of the Council’s Cost-of-Living Crisis support, and is available now on a first-come-first-served basis.\n\nThe range of measures available include:\n\nCavity wall insulation\n\nHard-to-treat cavity wall insulation\n\nUnder-floor insulation\n\nHeating controls and programmers\n\nLoft insulation\n\nHigh heat retention storage heaters\n\nDraught proofing and\n\nLED bulbs\n\nTo be eligible for Energy Smart funding your household’s gross income must be less than £43,662 and proof of income will be required. Multiple measures can be installed but there is a limit to the grant per household.\n\nTo register your interest please complete the Council’s project managing agent M-Four’s online form or call 0800 471 4738.\n\nDetails on how your information will be used and stored for this project is available within the Energy Smart Privacy Policy.\n\nHeat and Energy Efficient Scotland – Area Based Scheme\n\nNorth Ayrshire Council has successfully secured funding from the Scottish Government’s Heat and Energy Efficiency Scotland: Area Based Schemes (HEES:ABS) programme to enhance the energy efficiency of privately owned properties within North Ayrshire.\n\nAll project areas are identified in line with guidance issued by the Scottish Government.\n\nTo deliver this scheme the council are working with Managing Agents, M-Four, and the Scottish Government's Home Energy Scotland to engage with homeowners. Homeowners within eligible areas will receive a letter from M-Four inviting them to register their interest in the scheme. M-Four will then assess if they are eligible for assistance from this fund or other funding routes.\n\nIf you have further questions relating to the Area Based Scheme, please contact M-Four:\n\nby telephone - 0800 471 4738\n\nby email - contact@m-four.org\n\nOtherwise, please contact Home Energy Scotland on 0808 808 2282 to register your interest.\n\nDetails on how your information will be used and stored for this project is available within the HEES:ABS Privacy Policy.\n\nECO4 Flexibility and Great British Insulation Scheme (ECO4 Flex and GBIS)\n\nNorth Ayrshire Council continues to support our residents by accessing external funding where possible. The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) is an obligation on energy suppliers aimed at helping households cut their energy bills and reduce carbon emissions by installing energy saving measures.\n\nAs part of ECO, ECO4 Flex and GBIS allow the council to refer private households on low incomes and those vulnerable to the cold for support with energy efficiency measures. The council has a legislative requirement to publish a Statement of Intent (SoI) which defines qualifying criteria. Our current SoI, along with superseded statements, are available to view below:\n\nStatement of Intent ECO4 Flex\n\nECO4 Flex Privacy Notice\n\nStatement of Intent ECO4 Flex V1 - superseded\n\nApplying for ECO4 LA Flex\n\nApplications for ECO4 Flex will only be accepted from North Ayrshire Council ECO4 Flex approved installers.\n\nGreen Home Systems, 7 Ailsa Rd, Irvine Industrial Estate, Irvine, KA12 8LL. Phone: 0800 783 3373\n\nValley Group, Block 14 Unit B, Queenslie Industrial Estate, Glasgow, G33 4DB. Phone: 0141 404 0244\n\nResidents\n\nTo check if you are eligible for ECO4 Flex or GBIS funding please contact our approved installers directly. Alternatively, if you would like further information on this or other government schemes, please visit Home Energy Scotland's website or call 0800 808 2282. Home Energy Scotland is funded by the Scottish Government and offer free impartial energy advice and support.\n\nTo check eligibility, householders will be asked, by the installer, to supply income and health information. This information will be passed to the council to assess. We have no other role in the process of ECO-funded works.\n\nInstallers undertaking ECO-funded work for householders do not work for the council. Any works undertaken are a private arrangement between the householder and their chosen installer in the same way as any other works they may decide to have carried out in their home.\n\nNotice to installers\n\nNorth Ayrshire Council undertook a Prior Identification Notice (PIN) on 30 November 2022 and from this has identified partnership installers. The council will not include any additional installers to the approved list at this time or accept declaration requests from contractors not stated above.\n\nComplaints\n\nAll complaints or issues regarding the ECO4 Flex and GBIS scheme in the first instance should be referred to the installer company. Please follow the dispute resolution process as set by Trustmark, the UK Government endorsed quality scheme for home improvements.\n\nComplaints can be registered with Trustmark through the Trustmark website. Please also inform the council by emailing North Ayrshire Council's Energy and Sustainability Department.\n\nCommunity Renewable Energy Generation Fund (CREGF)\n\nNorth Ayrshire's CREGF scheme invites applications from community organisations to support renewable energy projects in North Ayrshire.\n\nThe CREGF aims to:\n\nincrease the level of local community owned renewable energy generation opportunities\n\nsupport North Ayrshire’s target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2030\n\naccelerate community benefit from local renewable energy generation"
