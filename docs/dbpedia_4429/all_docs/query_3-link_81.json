        "text": "Browse our connections glossary of terms for descriptions and definition of acronyms, abbreviations and commonly used terms.\n\nA\n\nAllowed interruption\n\nWhere a customer is interrupted or tripped off within the parameters and provisions of their contract.\n\nAppendix G\n\nAppendix G is an Appendix to the Bilateral Connection Agreement of a Distribution Network Owner.\n\nThe Appendix G gives visibility to the DNO, TO and NGESO of the capability of their connection sites, available GSP capacity and an increased view of Embedded Generation levels.\n\nAttributable works\n\nNetwork reinforcement works between the point of connection and the nearest MITS.\n\nAttributable works are secured by the customer under CMP192 and listed in the Appendix MM of the Construction Agreement where applicable.\n\nATV (Agreement to Vary)\n\nThe legal document signed to affect a change to your contracted position.\n\nB\n\nBackfeed\n\nBackfeed will be required if you need to take power from the National Electricity Transmission System (NETS) to support your commissioning and build programme ahead of your connection date.\n\nBalancing services\n\nA range of services that are available for customers to provide to the ESO to assist in the operation and flexibility of the system.\n\nBCA (Bilateral Connection Agreement)\n\nThis is an agreement required for any direct connections to the Transmission system.\n\nIt sets out requirements under relevant codes and is applicable to all types of direct connection e.g. generation, demand, DNO etc...\n\nBEGA (Bilateral Embedded Generation Agreement)\n\nA BEGA sets out requirements under the Grid Code, Connection and Use of System (CUSC) and Balancing and Settlement Code (BSC).\n\nA BEGA will also provide you with Transmission Entry Capacity (TEC) and the right to operate in the electricity balancing market and export onto the NETS.\n\nBELLA (Bilateral Embedded License exemptible Large power station Agreement)\n\nThis is a generator agreement in relation to an embedded connection to one of the Distribution networks in Scotland. The connection must be over a certain size in order to be eligible (10MW Northern Scotland or 30MW Southern Scotland). The agreement sets out requirements under relevant codes.\n\nBM (Balancing Mechanism)\n\nThe balancing mechanism (BM) is a tool which we use to balance electricity supply and demand.\n\nIt allows generation customers to set prices for which they will increase or decrease their output if requested by the ESO.\n\nAll large generators must participate in the BM, whereas it is optional for smaller generators.\n\nThe process for participating will form part of the connections process after you have signed your offer. This will specify all the necessary communications equipment that you need to install to allow participation in the BM.\n\nBSC (Balancing Settlement Code)\n\nThe Balancing and Settlement Code contains the rules and governance arrangements for electricity balancing and settlement in Great Britain.\n\nThe code covers the metering of the physical production and demand for electricity from generators, suppliers and interconnectors in relation to their contracted positions. And it also covers the calculating and settling of any imbalances when delivery or offtake doesn’t match those positions.\n\nThe BSC sets out a framework for making a submission to buy or sell electricity into or out of the market at close to real time.\n\nBSUoS Charges (Balancing and Use of System Charges)\n\nThe BSUoS charge recovers the cost of day-to-day operation of the transmission system.\n\nC\n\nCancellation charge\n\nThe charge that will be payable should a customer terminate their Construction Agreement ahead of connection.\n\nCancellation charges are visible for the coming 6 month period via bi-annual estimate statements sent by your ESO Contract Manager under both CMP192 and Final Sums methodology.\n\nCapital contribution\n\nA full or partial payment in respect of charges in your connection agreement, usually in relation to connection asset charges.\n\nCapital contributions can be made via a set of payments pre-commissioning or a single payment on the Charging Date.\n\nThis is an alternative to paying charges over the life of a project.\n\nCBA (Customer Build Agreement)\n\nAn Agreement between the customer and the relevant TO whereby the customer will procure and install certain transmission connection assets.\n\nAlso known as a User Self Build (USB) Agreement.\n\nCEC (Connection Entry Capacity)\n\nThe CEC is the maximum potential output onto the system based on the capability of the plant equipment, which can be higher than the TEC.\n\nIt is often set higher than TEC to allow for changes over the years, without needing a change to the infrastructure or system, which leads to higher costs.\n\nCfD (Contracts for Difference)\n\nContracts for Difference (CfDs) is intended to provide long-term revenue stabilisation to low-carbon Generators, allowing investment to come forward at a lower cost of capital and therefore at a lower cost to consumers.\n\nCharging date\n\nNormally the day after the connection date and the date upon which charges either become due or start e.g. one-off charges, TNuOS charges if applicable.\n\nCION (Connections Infrastructure Options Note)\n\nThe CION process evaluates the respective transmission options required which leads to the identification and development of the overall efficient, coordinated and economical connection point, onshore connection design and, where applicable, offshore transmission system / interconnector design.\n\nClock start\n\nThe date on which your application & DRC data submission is deemed technically competent and your fee is paid (the latter of the two dates).\n\nClock start signifies the start of the 3 month offer period as defined in CUSC.\n\nCMP192 (CMP192 – Enduring User Commitment Arrangements)\n\nCMP192 is the CUSC modification code for User Commitment and became effective in April 2013.\n\nAlong with CUSC section 15 it explains the framework for customer security and applies to all customers categorised as generation or embedded generation.\n\nDirectly connected demand customers and DNOs secure under another methodology called Final Sums.\n\nCMP192 principles include security requirements reducing as a connection becomes more certain and hits key milestones, the ability to fix attributable securities and the securing of a wider liability applicable to all parties.\n\nConnection assets\n\nA connected asset which has one sole user. These assets can be built, owned and maintained by the relevant TO Company and paid for by the customer or built and owned by the customer themselves dependent upon the agreed ownership boundary.\n\nConnection date\n\nThe date by which a User can Connect to or make use of the Transmission Network following the completion of all necessary works.\n\nConnection site\n\nThe point on the transmission system at which you connect (a substation or GSP).\n\nConsAg (Construction Agreement)\n\nThis agreement sits beside the BCA throughout the construction period of a project and contains the required works, key milestones and costs.\n\nThe construction agreement falls away on connection.\n\nContracted background\n\nAll contracted projects both connected and future.\n\nContracted party\n\nOnce an offer is signed and countersigned by NGESO the customer becomes a contracted party and will appear on the relevant registers dependent on the type of connection.\n\nCUSC (Connection and Use of System Code)\n\nThis code that sets out the process for connection to and use of the transmission systems.\n\nIt contains all relevant commercial concepts in relation to the formation of your contract e.g charges, security.\n\nIt also contains the templates for the legal agreements used.\n\nCUSC accession agreement\n\nAny party with either a connection or generator agreement from NGESO is required to accede to the CUSC.\n\nThis agreement must be signed along with the other offer documents and all provisions under the CUSC will then apply to the contracted customer.\n\nCUSC offer period\n\nThe 3 month period triggered by clock start in which NGESO has to issue an offer.\n\nD\n\nDirectly connected\n\nAny party physically connected to the transmission system rather than through a distribution network.\n\nDNO (Distribution Network Operator)\n\nDNO companies own and operate the power lines and infrastructure that connect homes and commercial properties to the NETS.\n\nDRC (Data Registration Code)\n\nThe data registration code sets out the data that is required at each stage of the connections process.\n\nThere is also a DRC tool that can be populated using Excel for ease.\n\nE\n\nElexon\n\nElexon are an external entity who are responsible for administering the Balancing and Settlement Code (BSC), which states the rules and governance around balancing electricity in Great Britain.\n\nThey compare how much electricity generators and suppliers say they will produce and consume with actual volumes, helping to balance any differences.\n\nEmbedded generator\n\nGeneration projects connected to (embedded in) a distribution network.\n\nEnabling works\n\nAny works the relevant TO company must carry out on the transmission system to facilitate a customer connection.\n\nEON (Energisation Operational Notification)\n\nIssued by your compliance manager and required for first energisation of a new connection.\n\nF\n\nFID (Final Investment Decision)\n\nThis is the point at which your project is approved or sanctioned to go ahead(Customer side).\n\nFinal sums\n\nCustomers on Final Sums methodology for their security requirements secure all the TO spend for their project.\n\nThe security requirement is detailed in Appendix M to the Construction Agreement and updated bi-anually by your ESO Contract Manager.\n\nThis methodology applies to directly connected demand and DNO customers.\n\nFirm\n\nUnrestricted ability to export the maximum amount of contracted MW under any conditions.\n\nFON (Final Operational Notification)\n\nIssued by your compliance manager when all compliance activities have been resolved.\n\nG\n\nGrid Code\n\nThe Grid Code details the technical requirements for connecting to and using the National Electricity Transmission System (NETS).\n\nCompliance with the Grid Code is one of the requirements of the Connection and Use of System Code (CUSC).\n\nGSP (Grid Supply Plant)\n\nA point of supply from the NETS to the local system of the DNO, or Connection Point at which the Transmission System is connected to a Distribution System.\n\nI\n\nIntertrip\n\nAn Intertrip is a piece of equipment that will automatically disconnect a generator from the transmission system, if it detects a specific event such as a system fault.\n\nThis is to relieve localised circuit overloads. There are two types of Intertrips:\n\nOperational Intertrip: those that are a condition of connection to the transmission system\n\nCommercial Intertrip: these may be specified at the time of connection or agreed on an adhoc basis. Within your connection offer, you may be required to install an Intertrip due to the location where you are connecting.\n\nION (International Operational Notification)\n\nIssued by the Compliance team and required for first export on to the system.\n\nIONs for Offshore connections come in two parts.\n\nK\n\nKey consents\n\nIt is the customer's responsibility to obtain the relevant planning consents for a project from the appropriate body.\n\nObtaining key consents will be a key project and milestone and will also impact on the level of security you will be required to place (CMP192 only).\n\nL\n\nLARF (Local Asset Reuse Factor)\n\nA term related to the User Commitment methodology.\n\nThe LARF is the proportion of an asset or scheme that can be reused should a customer terminate once construction has commenced or spend has been committed.\n\nLDTEC (Limited Duration Transmission Entry Capacity)\n\nAny customer who has already connected to our transmission network can apply for LDTEC, this means a TEC increase or decrease for a period of up to six months.\n\nLEEMPS (Licence Exemptible Embedded Medium Power Station)\n\nLEEMPS is a classification of embedded generators that are ’medium’ (between 50-99 MW), and are therefore only applicable in England and Wales. LEEMPS generators do not have to have an agreement with NGESO but the relevant DNO company must have additional technical conditions and parameters added to their BCA.\n\nLON (Limited Operation Notification)\n\nIssued where a user was previously on a FON but the connection has been modified to a fault has occurred where the customer has an agreed limited amount of time to resolve the issue.\n\nM\n\nModification application\n\nA formal CUSC request to make changes to your existing agreement.\n\nThis will incur a fee and will follow the same offer process as your original application.\n\nN\n\nNETS (National Electricity Transmission System)\n\nThe high voltage transmission system operated by NGESO.\n\nNGET (National Grid Electricity Transmission)\n\nOnshore Transmission Owner in England & Wales.\n\nNon-firm\n\nNon-Firm contracts contain restrictions that limit a user being able to export their full capacity under certain conditions.
