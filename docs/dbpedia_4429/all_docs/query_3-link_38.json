        "text": "Behind the Grid: a look inside our electricity systems\n\nOur lives are powered by electricity; it lets us talk to friends, listen to music, travel to work, cook our meals and so much more. When we flick a switch, the electricity is just… there. But do you ever wonder how that happens? In our video series ‘Behind the Grid’ we take you behind the scenes of the UK’s electricity system to discover how it all works, from where the electricity is generated right up to where it’s used.\n\nTake a look 'Behind the Grid'\n\nInvesting for growth\n\nWe’ve announced plans to invest around £60 billion across the next five years – a near doubling in investment compared to the prior period.\n\nThis significant scale of investment in our energy networks will unlock economic growth and enable the increasingly digital, electrified and decarbonised economies of the future. By the end of the decade, National Grid will support more than 60,000 more jobs in the UK and northeast US.\n\nTo finance this unprecedented scale of investment and growth, we have announced a comprehensive financing plan, including a £7 billion fully-underwritten rights issue.\n\nFind out more\n\nThe Clean Energy Revolution podcast is back for a third season\n\nJoin Dr. Carolyn Kissane and Laura Young (aka Less Waste Laura) to uncover the big stories in clean energy and the role it plays in tackling the negative effects of climate change.\n\nFrom AI to infrastructure, communities to climate policy, expect conversations with experts, industry leaders and passionate individuals as we discover how our lives will be powered as we work towards a net zero future.\n\nListen now\n\nWhat happens when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining?\n\nTo achieve net zero carbon emissions, more of our electricity needs to be generated from renewable energy sources – two of the most popular being wind power and solar power.\n\nBecause energy generation from these sources can be intermittent, we receive a lot of questions about where clean electricity will come from when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.\n\nFind out what happens\n\nWhy invest in National Grid?\n\nNational Grid is one of the world’s largest publicly listed utilities focused on transmission and distribution of electricity and gas. We play a vital role in connecting millions of people to the energy they use safely, reliably and efficiently.\n\nWe aim to be a low-risk business that generates shareholder value through dividends and asset/equity growth.\n\nView our Annual Report\n\nCareers at National Grid\n\nWe’re looking for people with enthusiasm to help us build and run a cleaner energy system for the future. Wherever you are on your career journey there are lots of exciting opportunities to explore, including apprenticeships.
