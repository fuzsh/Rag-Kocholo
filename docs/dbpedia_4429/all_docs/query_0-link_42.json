        "text": "The 1973 ‘oil shock’ inaugurated a decade of energy policy activism by the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).Footnote 2 Key aims were to fight inflation and to avoid the risk of a repetition of the 1974–5 economic recession.Footnote 3 This was to be achieved by reducing dependence on OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) oil, by diversifying energy sources and by improving energy efficiency. Some sectors of the western European left also pushed for a new development model aimed at limiting ‘maximum growth’ and consumerism while focussing on resource conservation and investing in ‘collective goods’ such as public transport.Footnote 4 The oil shock triggered initiatives to secure petroleum supply through state to state deals with the newly-formed national oil companies of oil-exporting countries.Footnote 5 Western European governments looked, even beyond petroleum, into schemes to stabilise raw material prices, so as to guarantee at the same time security of supply for industrialised consumers as well as income stability for commodity exporters.Footnote 6\n\nThis article deals with the prominent role played by the British Conservative government, guided since 1979 by Margaret Thatcher, in re-launching an energy model based on cheap oil (between 1980 and 2010 global oil consumption increased by 50 per cent!) by leveraging the newly available petroleum extracted in the North Sea.Footnote 7 North Sea oil represented a crucial, if never openly acknowledged, ally for Thatcher (according to Robert Skidelski, it was the first of her ‘strokes of luck'), serving more than one strategic goal at once.Footnote 8\n\nThe advent of North Sea oil weakened the market power of OPEC exporters and torpedoed the already uphill negotiations over the establishment of a New International Economic Order (NIEO) aimed at a global redistribution of wealth towards the developing countries and raw materials exporters of the Global South.Footnote 9 Brent crude, a quality of oil extracted in the British North Sea, would become the most important benchmark for global oil trade, with ‘paper barrels’ taking over the price structure based since the early 1970s on OPEC ‘basket price’.Footnote 10 At the same time, the North Sea allowed the British Conservatives to forward their cherished ‘de-nationalisation’ (later referred to as ‘privatisation’) of the commanding heights of the economy. British privatisations during the Thatcher government were the most important in the world by value, with those in the hydrocarbons sector alone accounting for half of the total revenues.Footnote 11 This was especially important given that British ‘nationalisations’, particularly in the energy sector, had been a key episode of the advent of the ‘mixed-economy’ in western Europe.Footnote 12 North Sea hydrocarbons were also instrumental in the victorious battle against the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), the most powerful trade union in the United Kingdom, and thus in the weakening of labour power in general."
