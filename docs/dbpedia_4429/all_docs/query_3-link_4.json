You must pay an amount which is in proportion to what we have done in comparison with the total amount due under the contract.\n\nWhere we repay you, we will use the same method of payment you used to pay (unless you agree otherwise); we will not charge you any fees to repay you. If we are allowed to charge you for any Services we have provided we may either take this out of what we repay you or ask you to pay the amount to us.\n\n6.10 If you need emergency repair services from us:\n\nIf, during the Term, your Boiler fails to function correctly then you may call the emergency call out number set out in your Pack (or visit our website for contact details certasenergy.co.uk) to request the provision of Emergency Repairs.\n\nOur ability to undertake Emergency Repairs is subject to the availability of our engineers, though we will endeavour to ensure that one of our engineers is available to review the situation and attempt to remedy the problem(s) during our normal operating hours (which are 8am to 5:00pm Monday to Friday and 9am to 12 noon on Saturday).\n\nBoiler during our initial visit but if we are unable to do so, or we need to order Parts, then we will arrange for one or more follow-up visits as required.
