        "text": "Foreword\n\nThis Economic and fiscal outlook (EFO) sets out our central forecast and the uncertainties that surround it for the five years to 2028-29, taking account of recent data and government policies announced up to and including the Spring Budget 2024. The forecasts presented in this document represent our collective view as the three independent members of the OBR’s Budget Responsibility Committee (BRC). We take full responsibility for the judgements that underpin them and for the conclusions we have reached.\n\nAs always, we have been greatly supported in our work by the staff of the OBR. We are very grateful for their commitment, professionalism, and expertise. We have also drawn on the analysis of numerous officials across government in preparing these forecasts, including in HM Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, the Department for Education, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, the Home Office, the Department for Transport, the Department of Health and Social Care, Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, North Sea Transition Authority, the Office for National Statistics, the UK Debt Management Office, National Savings and Investments, the British Business Bank, the BBC, Homes England, UK Government Investments, the Government Actuary’s Department, the Insolvency Service, the Scottish Government, the Scottish Fiscal Commission, the Welsh Government, the Department for Communities and the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland, Transport for London, and various public service pension schemes. We also held helpful discussions with various departmental finance directors. We are grateful to all of them for their engagement and insights.\n\nOutside government we have held useful discussions with the Bank of England, National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Resolution Foundation and Institute for Government. We have also benefitted from discussions with: Hamish Low, Madeleine Sumption, Alan Manning and Tessa Hall. We are also grateful to our labour market and migration, and macroeconomics and econometrics, advisory panel subgroups for sharing their insights.\n\nThe date for the Budget and this forecast was announced on 27 December, giving exactly the required ten weeks’ notice for fiscal events specified in the Memorandum of understanding between the Office for Budget Responsibility, HM Treasury, the Department for Work and Pensions and HM Revenue and Customs (MoU). But the earlier-than-usual March Budget date, and the publication of key ONS population and labour market releases in early February, effectively constrained the window for the pre-measures forecast process to five weeks. As a result, we only completed two, rather than the usual three, rounds of pre-measures forecasts. This made the forecast process more challenging than usual, but it has not impaired the final forecast.\n\nWe published the timetable of the key stages of the forecast on 25 January, once it had been agreed by signatories of the MoU. On this occasion, the timetable was adjusted to permit 23 working days instead of 21 between our final pre-measures economy forecast and the Budget date. This was to accommodate a Treasury request to extend the initial window for major Budget policy decisions from five to six days following the delivery of our final pre-measures fiscal forecast. The window for the preparation of our pre-measures economy forecast was also extended by a day, to give sufficient time for us to consider fully the implications of the latest ONS data. We are grateful to ONS for providing us with pre-release access to these datasets, which made this forecast timetable feasible. Within the constraints of this compressed timetable, the overall process operated effectively and deadlines were adhered to at each stage. The forecast timetable for this EFO has been:\n\nOBR staff prepared an initial economy forecast, incorporating latest interest rates and other market determinants and data released since our previous forecast in November 2023. This first economy forecast was sent to the Chancellor on 17 January.\n\nUsing the economic determinants from this forecast (such as the components of nominal income and spending, unemployment, inflation, and interest rates), we commissioned forecasts from the relevant government departments for the various tax and spending items that in aggregate determine the position of the public finances. We discussed these in detail with the officials producing them, which allowed us to investigate proposed changes in forecasting methodology and to assess the significance of recent tax and spending outturn data. In many cases the BRC requested changes to methodology and/or the interpretation of recent data. This first fiscal forecast was sent to the Chancellor on 30 January.\n\nWe then produced a second and final pre-measures economy forecast, in which we took on the latest ONS population projections and reweighted LFS data, and incorporated judgements embodied in our first fiscal forecast. This economy forecast included energy and financial market data based on the average over the 10 working days to 23 January and was sent to the Treasury on 5 February. Where we thought it would be helpful, we commissioned analysis from the relevant teams in the Treasury to inform our views and discussed general forecast issues, though not specific judgements, with experts from external organisations.\n\nThis second economy forecast provided the basis for the next round of fiscal forecasts. Discussions with HMRC, DWP and other departments gave us the opportunity to consider further analysis, methodological changes, and alternative forecast judgements. We sent our second and final pre-measures fiscal forecast to the Chancellor on 14 February.\n\nIn parallel, we undertook a process of engagement and analysis to assess the set of policy measures to be announced in the Budget that we deemed could have specific effects on our economy forecast, to inform our forecast judgements. This involved several rounds of engagement with the Treasury and other departments as both the specification of policy packages and our assessment of their impact were refined.\n\nWe also scrutinised the costing of individual tax and spending measures announced since the November 2023 forecast. As usual, OBR staff and the BRC requested further information and/or changes to almost all the draft costings prepared by departments. We have certified all policy measures in the forecast as reasonable and central.\n\nAlongside the development of the final economy forecast we made an initial assessment of the economic and fiscal effects of the emerging policy package. This built on earlier analysis that allowed us to factor in an initial package of measures that was provided by the Treasury on 16 February. We incorporated this package into a preliminary post-measures forecast, in order to provide an early view on the effect of Budget measures on the economy and public finances, which we sent to the Chancellor on 20 February. This forecast round was produced using our internal ready-reckoner models (rather than being sent to departmental forecasters).\n\nIn line with the agreed timetable, on 22 February the Treasury provided the final package of measures that we judged would cause movements in our economy forecast. We sent the resulting final economy forecast to the Treasury on 27 February and a near-final fiscal forecast on 28 February. Final policy decisions, that would not be material for the economy forecast, were provided by the Treasury on 29 February and our fiscal forecast was then finalised on 1 March and sent to the Treasury on the same day.\n\nThe Treasury made a written request, as provided for in the MoU between us, that we provide the Chancellor and an agreed list of his special advisers and officials with a near-final draft of the EFO on 1 March. This allowed the Treasury to prepare the Chancellor’s statement. We also provided pre-release access to the full and final EFO on 4 March.\n\nDuring the forecasting period, the BRC held dozens of scrutiny and challenge meetings with officials from other departments, in addition to numerous further meetings at staff level and those with external stakeholders. We have been provided with all the information and analysis that we requested and have come under no pressure from Ministers, advisers, or officials to change any of our conclusions as the forecast has progressed. The BRC met with the Chancellor on three occasions to discuss the forecast over the course of its production (on 1 February, 13 February and 27 February). A full log of our substantive contact with Ministers, their offices and special advisers can be found on our website. This includes the list of special advisers and officials who received the near-final draft of the EFO on 1 March.\n\nOur non-executive members, Bronwyn Curtis OBE, Baroness Hogg, and Dame Susan Rice provide additional assurance over how we engage with the Treasury and other departments. This includes reviewing any correspondence that OBR staff feel either breaches the MoU requirement that it be confined to factual comments only or could be construed as doing so. That review takes places as soon as practicable after each EFO has been published. Any concerns our non-executive members have will be raised with the Treasury’s Permanent Secretary or the Treasury Select Committee if they deem that appropriate.\n\nWe would be pleased to receive feedback on any aspect of the content or presentation of our analysis. This can be sent to [email protected].\n\nThe Budget Responsibility Committee\n\nRichard Hughes, Professor David Miles CBE and Tom Josephs\n\nChapter 1: Executive summary\n\nOverview\n\n1.1 The UK economy has emerged from the twin global shocks of the pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine into a period of declining inflation but stagnating output. Inflation has receded more quickly than we expected in November and markets now expect a sharper decline in interest rates. This strengthens near-term growth prospects and should enable a faster recovery in living standards from last financial year’s record decline. But the medium-term economic outlook remains challenging. One of the biggest changes to our economy forecast is an increase in the size and growth of the UK population. But higher and rising levels of inactivity offset its impact on the overall size of the workforce, leaving our forecast for the level of GDP in five years virtually unchanged from the autumn, and the level of GDP per person slightly lower.\n\n1.2 The overall outlook for the public finances is also similar to November. Lower inflation and interest rates reduce the Government’s projected debt servicing and welfare costs, but they also reduce revenues. These pre-measures forecast changes result in a £20 billion fiscal improvement over the next two years but leave borrowing largely unchanged in five years’ time. The Budget announces a package of net tax cuts, including a further 2p cut to the main rates of employee and self-employed national insurance contributions, the cost of which is partially recouped by tax rises in later years. Borrowing is still projected to fall in each of the next five years thanks to tax as a share of GDP rising to near to a post-war high, debt interest costs falling, and per person spending on public services being held flat in real terms. This is just enough to meet the Government’s fiscal rules on our central forecast with underlying debt falling as a share of GDP in 2028-29 by a historically modest margin of £8.9 billion.\n\n1.3 This margin is a small fraction of the risks around that central forecast. Inflation could rebound and remain higher for longer if the conflict in the Middle East were to widen or if domestic wage pressures do not subside as quickly as we assume. There is also uncertainty around several key drivers of medium-term economic growth including net migration, labour market participation, and productivity growth. The fiscal forecast is highly sensitive to movements in interest rates which have been unusually volatile recently. Since November, market expectations for medium-term Bank Rate have been both 1 percentage point higher but also ½ a percentage point lower than assumed in this forecast. The fiscal forecast is also conditioned on the tax take rising to near record highs, including through planned rises in fuel duty that have not, in practice, been implemented since 2011. It also assumes the Government will stick to assumptions which imply no real growth in public spending per person over the next five years, despite committing to increase spending on some major public services in line with or faster than GDP.\n\nEconomic outlook\n\n1.4 CPI inflation was 4.2 per cent in the final quarter of last year, 0.6 percentage points lower than we forecast in November. We now expect it to fall further to an average of 2.2 per cent this year and 1.5 per cent in 2025 before gradually returning to target at the end of the forecast period. Our lower central forecast for inflation is partly driven by larger anticipated falls in global energy prices. We also expect domestically generated inflation to be weaker, as falling energy prices pass through into lower economy-wide costs and the labour market continues to loosen. Our central forecast assumes current disruptions in the Red Sea make only a small (0.2 percentage points) upward contribution to inflation. But we also consider the risks of a widening conflict in the Middle East, through a scenario in which a sharp rise in energy prices causes inflation to spike back up to an annual peak of almost 6 per cent.\n\nChart 1.1: CPI inflation\n\n1.5 Alongside easing inflationary pressures, market participants now expect a sharper fall in interest rates than in the autumn. Bank Rate is expected to fall more steeply this year from its current peak of 5.25 per cent to 4.2 per cent in the final quarter of 2024. In the medium term, Bank Rate falls further to 3.3 per cent, almost ¾ of a percentage point lower than in our November forecast. With gilt yields also around ½ a percentage point lower across maturities, the cost of debt interest for the Government is significantly lower than expected in November. But expectations remain volatile, as shown by expectations for Bank Rate in 2028 oscillating between 2.7 and 4.2 per cent since our November forecast.\n\n1.6 There has been important news since November about the size and projected growth of the UK population. Based on updated outturn data and January ONS population projections, we now expect the total UK adult population to rise from 55 million in 2023 to 57 million by the end of the forecast, 1¾ per cent larger (or 1 million more people) than in November. About two thirds of this increase is due to a higher estimate of the current UK population, which takes account of the 2021 Census and net migration since then, with the remainder largely from higher net migration over the forecast. Having reached a record high of 745,000 in 2022, net migration stood at 670,000 in the year to mid-2023, around 70,000 higher than assumed in our November forecast. Supported by the policy measures announced since our last forecast, our central forecast assumes annual net migration falls back to 315,000 in the medium term, up from 245,000 in our November forecast. We also explore scenarios in which annual net migration is around 200,000 higher or lower, which could raise or lower the level of GDP in 2028-29 by around 1½ per cent but would have a small impact of uncertain direction on GDP per person.\n\n1.7 The latest data also suggest that the post-pandemic rise in economic inactivity is likely to prove more persistent than we previously thought. The number of inactive working-age adults is no longer declining from its post-pandemic peak, as previous data suggested, and has instead rebounded to 9.3 million. This keeps it around its highest level in over a decade and 700,000 more than before the pandemic. Around one third of the working-age inactive population cite long-term illness as their principal reason for not being in the labour force. We estimate that the policies on childcare expansion, welfare reform, and personal tax cuts announced over the past three fiscal events will increase total labour supply by over 300,000 people in full-time equivalent terms. But the ongoing ‘fiscal drag’ from frozen personal tax thresholds will also weigh on work incentives, offsetting over a third of this rise for an overall change of close to 200,000. But after taking account of all of the factors discussed above, we now expect the labour participation rate to continue falling from its pre-pandemic quarterly peak of 64.3 per cent to 62.8 per cent by 2028, 0.5 percentage points below our November forecast.\n\nChart 1.2: Net migration and participation rate\n\n1.8 With a larger population but lower labour participation, our forecast for potential output growth over the next five years is largely unchanged from November at around 1⅔ per cent a year. Higher net migration, lower interest rates, and lower energy prices boost population growth, business investment, and productivity respectively. But the latest data on labour participation, demographic and other factors have led us to revise down the overall trend participation rate and average hours worked. The net effect of these changes leaves the level of output 0.1 per cent lower in 2028 than forecast in November, but 0.1 per cent higher after accounting for the policies in this Budget that boost labour supply.\n\n1.9 The profile of output is slightly weaker in the near term but slightly stronger in the latter part of the decade. GDP grew by only 0.1 per cent in 2023, undershooting our November forecast by 0.4 percentage points. But we expect output growth to pick up to 0.8 per cent in 2024 as interest rates fall and real household incomes recover. GDP growth picks up to around 2 per cent in the middle of the decade as slack in the economy is taken up, before falling back towards its assumed trend rate of around 1⅔ per cent by 2028. Policies announced in this Spring Budget provide a small temporary boost to demand in the near term and to supply in the medium term which raises the level of real GDP by 0.2 per cent in 2028-29. Risks to our medium-term real GDP forecast remain elevated. The outlook for productivity growth is our most important and uncertain forecast judgement, and there is significant uncertainty over both our migration and participation forecasts.\n\nChart 1.3: Real GDP and real GDP per person\n\n1.10 Having steadily declined since early 2022, real GDP per person is forecast to trough at 1¼ per cent below its pre-pandemic peak in the first half of 2024. Persistent weakness in per person output has been driven by rises in inactivity and subdued productivity growth, which has remained well below its pre-financial crisis average in recent years, even after accounting for the rebound from the pandemic. We expect real GDP per person to begin to recover later this year and regain its pre-pandemic level in 2025. Real GDP per person increases to around 4½ per cent above its pre-pandemic peak by the forecast horizon, but remains around ¾ of a per cent lower than we forecast in November.\n\n1.11 The recovery in output is largely driven by a pick-up in household consumption growth to around 2 per cent from 2025 to 2028. That growth is stronger than in November due to higher household disposable incomes, a sharper slowdown in inflation, and lower interest rates. In contrast, business investment is expected to contract by around 5 per cent this year as past increases in interest rates raise the cost of capital and weigh on capital spending. Investment then strengthens as interest rates fall and demand picks up. Recent trade data have been volatile and subject to large revisions. Nevertheless, we forecast that trade volumes will continue to be subdued in the next few years due to sluggish growth in the UK and global economies, and the evolving impact of Brexit. From 2024 to 2028, we expect export and import volumes to average growth of 0.3 per cent and 0.1 per cent a year, respectively. As a result, net trade makes a negligible contribution to growth over the forecast period.\n\n1.12 Weak near-term GDP growth drives a modest rise in the unemployment rate in 2024, which then falls back as the recovery gathers pace. The latest ONS data suggest that unemployment fell to 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023. In contrast, claimant count data measuring the number of people on unemployment benefits has remained flat in recent months, while the redundancy rate has been on a slow upwards trend since the middle of 2022. We therefore judge that this and wider evidence is consistent with a moderate rise in the unemployment rate, peaking at 4.5 per cent in the last quarter of 2024, in line with our forecast for subdued economic growth and increasing spare capacity in the economy. The peak in unemployment of around 1.6 million people is marginally lower (by about 40,000 people) than in our November forecast, though it comes half a year sooner. The unemployment rate is then forecast to decline to its estimated structural level of 4.1 per cent by 2028.\n\n1.13 From a thirty-year high of close to 7 per cent, we expect nominal average pay growth to halve in 2024 as inflation falls and the labour market loosens. Nominal earnings growth is slightly weaker than our November forecast as inflation is less persistent. In terms of total labour income, this weaker nominal earnings growth is partly offset by faster growth in the number of employees. That leaves the level of nominal wages and salaries, a key determinant of our fiscal forecast, 0.3 per cent lower at the forecast horizon than in November. This is broadly in line with our revision to nominal GDP.\n\n1.14 Living standards are expected to recover more quickly than we forecast in November and grow by around 1 per cent a year on average over the forecast. 2022-23 remains the fiscal year with the largest year-on-year drop in living standards since ONS records began in the 1950s. But we now forecast real household disposable income per person to recover its pre-pandemic peak by 2025-26, two years earlier than in our November forecast. The faster recovery in living standards arises because the negative terms of trade shock brought about by the rise in the price of imported energy has unwound more quickly and fully than expected. Policies in this Budget provide an additional boost to household incomes, with the further reduction in the main rates of national insurance contributions alone providing a direct boost of ½ a per cent.\n\nChart 1.4: Real household disposable income per person\n\n1.15 Nominal GDP is forecast to grow by an average of 3.3 per cent a year over the forecast period, slightly less than expected in November due to the lower inflation outlook. The slower growth in the GDP deflator, combined with a little-changed path for real GDP, leaves the level of nominal GDP 0.3 per cent lower in the medium term than in our last forecast. In terms of the other key nominal tax bases, both profit and nominal consumption growth are weaker in the near term but rise faster in the medium term. By the forecast horizon, the change in both tax bases is broadly in line with that of nominal GDP.\n\nFiscal outlook\n\n1.16 The fiscal position remains very challenging due to high debt, subdued economic growth, and the highest interest rates for over a decade. Economic and market conditions mean the Government needs to run a primary surplus (revenues minus spending, excluding interest) of around 1.3 per cent of GDP just to stabilise debt in the medium term. By comparison across the 2010s, on average, debt could be stabilised while running a primary deficit of 2.1 per cent. Based on its current policies, we forecast that the Government achieves a primary surplus and falling debt by 2028-29, through a 1.1 per cent of GDP increase in primary receipts, and a 1.7 per cent fall in primary spending as a share of GDP. However, the fiscal deficit is the difference between two very large numbers (total revenues and total spending both now exceed £1 trillion), and the uncertainty around our central forecast for the trajectory of both borrowing and debt over the next five years is substantial.\n\n1.17 Relative to our November forecast, the underlying pre-measures fiscal outlook is slightly better in the near term but largely unchanged by the end of the forecast period. Borrowing is expected to be £10.1 billion lower this year and around £10 billion lower over each of the next two years. This is largely due to lower interest rates and inflation which reduce debt interest and welfare costs. But lower inflation also lowers nominal tax receipts by increasing amounts over the forecast. Overall, before taking account of Budget policy measures, this leaves borrowing in 2028-29 only £0.8 billion lower than we forecast in November.\n\n1.18 Against this fiscal backdrop, the Government has announced a frontloaded package of measures, including significant net tax cuts, estimated to increase borrowing on average by £8.0 billion a year. Overall, the direct and indirect effects of the measures raise borrowing by £12.7 billion in 2024-25, tapering down to £5.2 billion in 2028-29. This results in slightly higher post-measures borrowing in every year of the five-year forecast period than in November, peaking at £4.4 billion more in 2028-29.\n\nChart 1.5: Public sector net borrowing: change since November\n\n1.19 The Budget measures with the largest estimated direct fiscal impact are:\n\na further reduction in rates of national insurance contributions (NICs), including a 2p cut in the main rate of employee and self-employed NICs from April 2024, which costs £10.7 billion by 2028-29;\n\nreform of the current non-domicile regime from April 2025, which raises £3.1 billion on average from 2026-27 to 2028-29;\n\na number of new taxes and other revenue raising measures, including the introduction of vaping duty and the carbon border adjustment mechanism, HMRC anti-avoidance and compliance measures, and a one-year extension to the energy profits levy, which collectively raise £3.9 billion by 2028-29; and\n\n£0.9 billion more departmental capital spending per year on average between 2025-26 and 2027-28 on a public sector productivity programme focused on the NHS, and £0.8 billion per year less departmental resource spending from 2025-26 onwards.\n\n1.20 The indirect effects of these policies on the economy deliver a modest boost to demand in the near term and to labour supply in the medium term.\n\nThe demand boost is primarily driven by the increase to household incomes provided by the near-term tax-cuts. The cut in NICs and reform to the high-income child benefit taper also increase labour supply by improving work incentives. By the end of the forecast around half of the fiscal benefit from these effects is offset by the additional debt interest spending on the borrowing required to fund the policy package.\n\n1.21 Tax as a share of GDP is forecast to rise to 37.1 per cent of GDP in 2028-29, 4.0 per cent of GDP higher than the pre-pandemic level. Of this rise, we estimate 2.9 per cent will have taken place by the end of 2023-24, with the remaining 1.1 per cent forecast to take place thereafter to 2028-29. Over the whole period, major tax-raising policy decisions since March 2020 raise the tax take by 2.0 per cent of GDP, of which the freezes to income tax thresholds account for 1.3 per cent of GDP. These are partially offset by major tax cuts amounting to 0.9 per cent of GDP, of which the cuts to NICs announced in this Budget and in November 2023 account for 0.7 per cent of GDP.\n\n1.22 Spending is forecast to fall steadily as a share of GDP from 44.5 per cent this year to 42.5 per cent in 2028-29, but remains around 3 per cent of GDP above its pre-pandemic level. Debt interest costs account for around 0.4 per cent of GDP of the reduction from this year to 2028-29. The single largest contribution to the decline comes from the assumed 1.0 per cent of GDP reduction in departmental spending on public services over the next five years. Partially offsetting this, welfare spending is forecast to increase by 0.4 per cent of GDP as rising caseloads drive higher spending on health and disability-related benefits, and a combination of an ageing population and the triple lock drive higher pension spending.\n\n1.23 In our central forecast, borrowing as a share of GDP is expected to fall steadily from 4.2 per cent this year to 1.2 per cent of GDP in 2028-29. Of this 2.9 per cent of GDP reduction, the forecast rise in receipts contributes 0.9 per cent of GDP, while the forecast decline in spending contributes 2.1 per cent of GDP. In cash terms, borrowing is forecast to fall from £114.1 billion in 2023-24 to £39.4 billion in 2028-29. Compared to our November forecast, borrowing is slightly higher by 0.1 per cent of GDP on average over the five-year forecast period. As illustrated by Chart 1.6, there are a wide range of risks around our central borrowing forecast, which are discussed further below.\n\nChart 1.6: Public sector net borrowing\n\n1.24 Public sector net debt (excluding the Bank of England) in the central forecast rises from 88.8 per cent of GDP this year to a peak of 93.2 per cent of GDP in 2027-28, before falling slightly to 92.9 per cent of GDP in 2028-29. This is a very similar path to that in our previous forecast. The wider measure of headline debt rises from 97.6 per cent of GDP this year to 98.8 per cent in 2024-25, then falls to 94.3 per cent of GDP in 2028-29.\n\nChart 1.7: Public sector net debt excluding the Bank of England\n\nPerformance against the Government’s fiscal targets\n\n1.25 The Government’s primary fiscal target is for public sector net debt excluding the Bank of England to fall in the fifth, and final, year of the forecast. In our central forecast, this rule is met by a margin of £8.9 billion (0.3 per cent of GDP), down from the £13.0 billion (0.4 per cent of GDP) margin in our November forecast. As the pre-measures forecast is broadly unchanged by 2028-29, the reduction in headroom is mostly due to the impact of policy measures.\n\n1.26 Headroom of £8.9 billion is lower than the average of £26.1 billion that Chancellors have set aside against their fiscal rules since 2010.\n\nAnd it is very low compared to the risks around our forecast, which are summarised below. Based on historical forecast errors at the five-year horizon, we estimate there is a 54 per cent probability that the fiscal target would be met on current policy. This compares to a 56 per cent probability in our November forecast. Our forecast incorporates £4.8 billion of extra revenue in 2028-29 from the Government’s stated policy of reversing the 5p cut and increasing fuel duty rates in line with RPI inflation. If, as at this Budget and at all fiscal events since 2011, duty rates were instead held at the current rate, then almost half of the headroom in 2028-29 would be removed.\n\nChart 1.8: Underlying debt falling headroom: changes since November\n\n1.27 The supplementary target of public sector net borrowing being below 3 per cent of GDP in 2028-29 is also met in our central forecast. It is met by a larger margin than the fiscal mandate: £56.8 billion, or 1.8 per cent of GDP (down by £4.8 billion since November). History suggests that this margin would be consistent with a 72 per cent chance of meeting the supplementary target.\n\nRisks and uncertainties\n\n1.28 Historically large changes in energy prices, interest rates, wage growth, and population growth have driven significant revisions to our recent economic and fiscal forecasts. We continue to emphasise the uncertainties around our forecasts and the possibility that any of our key judgements could prove too optimistic or pessimistic. Key risks for this forecast include:\n\nWhile our central forecast is for inflation to return to target this year, the outlook remains highly uncertain. Externally, conflict in the Middle East poses risks to global goods and energy markets. The scenario in Box 2.2 illustrates how a widening of the current conflict in the Middle East could significantly reduce energy supply from the region and further disrupt global supply chains for goods. In this scenario, quarterly inflation spikes back up to over 7 per cent. We estimate that this could raise borrowing by £23.1 billion on average over the five-year forecast and leave underlying debt 0.8 per cent higher as a share of GDP by 2028-29. Domestically, our central projection is for wage growth to slow over the coming year, but wages may prove stickier and keep inflation higher for longer.\n\nOur forecast is based on market expectations for Bank Rate and gilt yields, and, while these have fallen significantly as inflation has dropped, they remain unusually volatile (see Box 4.3). Since we closed our November forecast, expectations for medium-term Bank Rate have moved between 2.7 and 4.2 per cent and 10-year gilt spot yields have oscillated between 3.5 and 4.7 per cent. If effective interest rates on all central government debt were just 0.3 percentage points higher or lower, this would eliminate the headroom to debt falling in 2028-29, or increase it by around £9 billion, respectively.\n\nA major change in our forecast since November has been incorporating updated net migration projections and Labour Force Survey data from the ONS. Future migration levels are highly uncertain and difficult to forecast, particularly given policy changes announced since November. Our scenarios show that if annual net migration was around 200,000 higher or lower than the ONS projection of 315,000 in the medium term, it might raise or lower GDP by around 1½ per cent in 2028-29, respectively. But the impact on GDP per person is much smaller and its direction unclear. In our higher migration scenario, borrowing is £19.9 billion lower by the forecast horizon, and underlying debt 3.1 per cent lower as a share of GDP. Our downside scenario is symmetric, with borrowing up by £19.9 billion and underlying debt up by 3.1 per cent of GDP.\n\nIn our November 2023 Economic and fiscal outlook we estimated that ½ per cent higher or lower annual productivity growth would reduce or raise borrowing by more than £40 billion by 2028-29. Productivity growth across the forecast is little changed from November, but the starting level is ½ a per cent lower as revised data shows a larger population producing a similar amount of output.\n\nThe level of economic inactivity remains significantly higher than before the pandemic. Our July 2023 Fiscal risks and sustainability report considered upside and downside scenarios for future inactivity levels. The downside scenario assumed the working-age participation rate fell 1.2 percentage points by 2027-28, leading to a 1½ per cent fall in GDP, £21.3 billion higher borrowing, and a 3.4 percentage point rise in debt as a share of GDP. The upside scenario was broadly symmetric, but with slightly smaller decreases in borrowing and debt.\n\n1.29 There are also significant risks attached to the implementation of the Government’s stated fiscal policies. Over the medium term, these risks include:\n\nThe fiscal forecast is conditioned on the tax-to-GDP ratio increasing by a further 1.1 percentage points from its current level to close to a post-war high of 37.1 per cent of GDP by 2028-29. Around two thirds of that increase comes from freezes to personal tax allowances which deliver around £7 billion of extra revenue for each additional year of the freeze. It also relies on the seldom-implemented indexation of fuel duty which delivers around £4.8 billion in additional revenue by 2028-29.\n\nThe lack of detailed department-by-department spending plans beyond the current Spending Review period, which ends in 2024-25. Departmental spending over the subsequent four years of our forecast follows two overall assumptions set by the Government. These now imply no real growth in departmental spending per person over the next five years. Within this envelope the Government has committed to, among other things, an NHS workforce plan that implies real growth of 3.6 per cent each year and holding defence spending constant at 2 per cent of GDP with ambitions to raise it to 2½ per cent of GDP. Meeting these and other commitments on schools, childcare, and overseas aid spending would imply a real cut in all other departments’ budgets of 2.3 per cent a year from 2025-26. In the run-up to the Spending Reviews in November 2015 and October 2021, governments topped up the current departmental expenditure envelope by an average of £39 billion and £32 billion a year respectively.\n\nChapter 2: Economic outlook\n\nIntroduction\n\n2.1 This chapter describes our latest economy forecast, summarised in Table 2.1, including:\n\nour conditioning assumptions, including those related to commodity prices, monetary and fiscal policy, and the global economy and exchange rate (from paragraph 2.2);\n\nprospects for inflation (from paragraph 2.9);\n\nour revised forecast for potential output, taking account of the latest population and labour force data (from paragraph 2.14);\n\nprospects for real GDP and the output gap (from paragraph 2.22);\n\nthe outlook for the labour market including the projected path of employment, unemployment, and earnings (from paragraph 2.31);\n\nour forecasts for household incomes, the saving rate and the housing market (from paragraph 2.39);\n\nthe outlook for the current account and nominal GDP (from paragraph 2.45); and\n\nhow our forecast compares to recent external forecasts (from paragraph 2.48).\n\nTable 2.1: Key economy forecast assumptions and judgements\n\nKey metric\n\n(per cent unless otherwise stated)November\n\n2023March\n\n2024ChangeGas pricesAverage in 2024 (£ a therm)1.20.8↓Oil pricesAverage in 2024 ($ a barrel)8277↓Bank RateFinal quarter of 20244.94.2↓Gilt yields10-year maturity (spot)4.53.9↓InflationRate in final quarter of 20242.81.4↓Output gapLevel in third quarter of 20230.1-0.1↓Potential outputGrowth average from 2024 to 20281⅔1⅔– Net migrationCumulative 5-year total from 2023-24 (mn)1.51.8↑ Participation rate (16+)Average in 202863.362.8↓Real GDPGrowth in 20240.70.8↑Real GDP per personLevel in 2028 (Index, 2019=100)105.5104.7↓UnemploymentPeak4.64.5↓Nominal earningsGrowth average from 2024 to 20282¾2½↓RHDI per personLevel in 2028 (Index, 2019=100)102.3103.4↑Nominal GDPLevel in 2028 (£bn)3,1903,179↓Key: ↑ Higher, ↓ Lower, – Unchanged\n\nKey forecast assumptions\n\nMonetary policy and gilts\n\n2.2 The expected path for Bank Rate is significantly lower than in our November forecast (left panel, Chart 2.1).

Bank Rate then reaches a lower level of 3.3 per cent at the forecast horizon, 0.7 percentage points than in our last forecast. The shallower near-term profile for Bank Rate is a counterpart to lower-than-expected inflation outturns. But expectations remain volatile, as shown by expectations for Bank Rate in 2028 oscillating between 2.7 and 4.2 per cent since our November forecast.\n\n2.3 Gilt yields are also lower across all maturities relative to November (right panel, Chart 2.1). When we closed our market window, the 10-year gilt yield stood at 3.9 per cent, 0.6 percentage points lower than in November. Similarly, 25-year gilt yields have fallen to 4.6 per cent, 0.4 percentage points lower than our November forecast. Despite these recent falls, 10-year gilt yields are still four times higher than their level of 0.9 per cent before the invasion of Ukraine.[1]\n\nPartly driven by changes in Bank Rate expectations, gilt yields have also remained volatile since our November forecast, with 10-year gilt yields ranging from 3.5 per cent to 4.7 per cent.\n\nChart 2.1: Bank Rate and gilt yields by years to maturity\n\nCommodity prices\n\n2.4 Since our November forecast, market expectations for natural gas prices have continued to fall towards levels last seen before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (left panel, Chart 2.2). Our forecast is conditioned on wholesale gas prices averaging 76 pence a therm in 2024 and 84 pence a therm in 2025. These figures are 46 and 32 pence lower, respectively, than we assumed in November. In the medium term, wholesale natural gas prices are now assumed to settle at around 78 pence a therm by 2028. This is 20 pence lower than in November, but still 28 pence higher than the pre-pandemic average of 50 pence a therm.\n\n2.5 Market expectations for Brent crude oil prices in 2024 have also fallen relative to our November forecast, down 7 per cent to $77 a barrel (right panel, Chart 2.2). In sterling terms, oil prices in 2024 have fallen by 10 per cent to £61 a barrel reflecting the strengthening of the pound since our November forecast. In recent months, the price of crude oil has seen relatively low levels of volatility. Market expectations for 2024 prices have ranged from $74 to $86 a barrel, despite the conflict in the Middle East posing a significant risk to oil and gas markets. Box 2.2 explores the potential impact of a widening of the conflict in the Middle East on energy, goods, and economy-wide prices in the UK.\n\nChart 2.2: Gas and oil prices\n\nWorld economy and the exchange rate\n\n2.6 Global economic conditions have improved since our November forecast, as growth has proved more resilient to higher energy prices and interest rates than previously expected. In line with the IMF’s January World Economic Outlook Update, we expect slightly stronger global GDP growth of 3.1 per cent in 2024, with medium-term growth unchanged at around 3 per cent (left panel, Chart 2.3). Conflict in the Middle East has emerged as a major risk to the global outlook, particularly if disruption to major shipping routes fuels further inflation (see Box 2.2). The trade weighted sterling effective exchange rate has strengthened by around 2 per cent since our November 2023 forecast (right panel, Chart 2.3). As of the 10 working days to 23 January, the pound had strengthened 4 per cent against the dollar, 1 per cent against the euro and 3 per cent against the yen.\n\nChart 2.3: World GDP growth and the exchange rate\n\nFiscal policy\n\n2.7 The large-scale fiscal support to households, firms, and public services provided during the pandemic and subsequent energy crisis has now mostly been withdrawn as both shocks have receded. Borrowing continues to fall over the forecast period as the remaining elements of crisis-related support are withdrawn, net tax continues to rise (largely through ongoing freezes to personal tax thresholds), and departmental spending falls as a share of GDP. Together, these reduce headline borrowing by 3 per cent of GDP over our forecast (with the reduction largest in 2024-25), which, on our central forecast, by 2028-29 puts the underlying debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path. The support to demand from fiscal policy wanes over our forecast, although the combined fiscal and monetary policy mix brings output to potential and inflation to 2 per cent by our forecast horizon.\n\n2.8 Relative to November, the path of headline borrowing is little changed across our forecast. Lower debt interest spending is offset by a modestly higher primary deficit, particularly in the final year of this Parliament. Around half of this reflects the discretionary fiscal loosening in the Spring Budget, which itself increases the primary deficit by 0.2 per cent of GDP on average over the forecast. As described in Box 2.1, we estimate the policy measures in this Budget to provide a small, temporary boost (0.2 per cent of GDP) to demand in the near term, and a similar, but permanent, boost (0.2 per cent of GDP) to supply over the medium term. The measures slightly lower near-term inflation and then raise it very slightly.\n\nBox 2.1: The economic effects of policy measures\n\nOur economy forecast accounts for the economic impacts of the latest announced government policies. This includes the demand-side impacts of the package as a whole, calculated using a set of fiscal ‘multipliers’ which are drawn from the empirical literature and reviewed periodically.a These capture wider effects of fiscal policy measures on output over and above their direct effects on government expenditure, through changes to private incomes and spending. The impact of policies on the supply side of the economy is also accounted for if credible evidence suggests that measures will have a material, additional, and durable impact on potential output.\n\nPolicies announced in this Spring Budget are estimated to add £14 billion to borrowing in 2024-25, and an average of £8 billion a year from 2025-26. We estimate that these policies raise GDP by an average of 0.3 per cent across the forecast period through their impacts on both the demand and supply sides of the economy (Chart A). The near-term stimulus to demand (blue bars) almost entirely reflects the further permanent cuts to NICs and a temporary fuel duty freeze boosting post-tax real incomes. Two Budget measures are expected to have lasting supply-side effects. The additional cuts to NICs (yellow bars) and changes to the high income child benefit charge (HICBC) (green bars) are estimated to raise GDP by a total 0.1 per cent in 2024-25. The impact rises to 0.2 per cent from 2025-26 onwards as more people adjust their labour supply in response to changes in financial incentives. Box 3.2 sets out a summary of our labour supply modelling.\n\nChart A: Impact of policy measures on real GDP\n\nThese two Budget measures are estimated to increase labour supply by around 100,000 (in full-time equivalent (FTE) terms) in the final year of the forecast. This is additional to the roughly 200,000 estimated combined final-year boosts from the NICs, childcare, welfare reform and other measures announced at the last two fiscal events. All of these estimates are highly uncertain and subject to revision. And, as discussed in Box 3.2, the net effect of recent fiscal policy changes on labour supply also needs to take account of the negative effect of the ongoing freeze to personal tax thresholds. As we also discuss in Box 3.2, recent upward revisions to the size of the population have increased our estimates for both the cost and labour supply impact of the Autumn 2023 NICs cut (those revisions are also reflected in the impacts of frozen thresholds). Non-tax measures, in the areas of childcare and welfare reforms, are also subject to delivery risk. The expansion of free childcare from April, which we estimated would boost employment by 60,000, has received additional funding to support delivery.\n\nWe expect this Budget’s measures to reduce CPI inflation by 0.2 percentage points in 2024-25, almost entirely reflecting the effect of maintaining the 5p cut to fuel duty for one more year and freezing alcohol duty. Part of this effect unwinds in 2025-26, when the planned increase in fuel duty adds 0.1 percentage points to CPI inflation. The fiscal stimulus raises inflation by a small amount – a cumulative 0.1 percentage points by 2028-29 – which leaves the overall level of CPI broadly unchanged by the end of our forecast horizon. The cut in capital gains tax for properties increases property transactions by around 2 per cent in the near term, before tapering away over the remainder of our forecast.\n\na) See our 2019 Forecast evaluation report and November 2020 Economic and fiscal outlook.\n\nb) A recent online article also set out the mechanics of our labour supply model, and how we applied it to the Autumn 2023 NICs cuts: OBR, The labour supply effects of the Autumn 2023 National Insurance Contributions cut, 2024. We also published the workings and recent application of our cost of capital model: OBR, The economic effects of full expensing, 2024.\n\nInflation\n\n2.9 Inflation has fallen more sharply than we expected in November. CPI inflation dropped from a 41-year high of 11.1 per cent in October 2022 to 4.2 per cent in the final quarter of 2023, 0.6 percentage points lower than we expected in November. The surprise fall in November monthly inflation represented the largest undershoot against the industry consensus since at least 2014.[2]\n\nGas and electricity bills, food, and fuel were broadly in line with our expectations in the final quarter of 2023. The downside surprise was split between lower inflation in other tradable and non-tradable goods and services. The easing in domestic inflationary pressures relative to our November forecast is consistent with our revised view that the economy is operating with slightly more spare capacity than we previously assumed (see paragraph 2.26).\n\n2.10 We now expect inflation to fall faster than in our November forecast over the coming two years. Our central forecast sees quarterly inflation falling to the 2 per cent target in the second quarter of 2024, around one year sooner than we expected in November. We expect inflation to average 2.2 per cent over 2024, then slow to 1.5 per cent in 2025 before rising to the target rate of 2 per cent in 2028. But there is considerable uncertainty around this forecast from both domestic and external inflationary pressures, especially around energy prices. To quantify this uncertainty, we construct a fan chart that illustrates the range of possible inflation outcomes if past forecast errors were a reasonable guide to future ones (Chart 2.4). For 2025 as a whole, it suggests that there is roughly a 1 in 10 chance that average inflation will exceed 4 per cent and a roughly 1 in 10 chance that average inflation will fall below -1 per cent.\n\nChart 2.4: CPI inflation\n\n2.11 The reduction in our forecast for inflation in 2024 from 3.6 to 2.2 per cent is mainly driven by significantly lower market expectations for energy prices since November. Our forecast is conditioned on the Ofgem price cap falling to £1,620 in April and averaging £1,550 between April and the end of the year, around 20 per cent lower than in our November forecast.[3]\n\nThe direct effect of lower energy prices reduces CPI inflation by slightly under 1 percentage point on average this year and explains around two thirds of our lower inflation forecast in 2024. From late 2024 onwards, we expect the indirect effects of lower energy prices to continue to put moderate downward pressure on CPI inflation. This more than offsets a modest upward adjustment in 2024 and 2025 from the impact of the current Red Sea shipping disruptions, peaking at 0.2 percentage points in the first half of 2025. We explore the inflationary and other economic implications of a widening of the conflict in the Middle East in Box 2.2. We expect domestically generated inflation to be slightly lower over 2024 and 2025, but slightly higher in 2026 and 2027, in line with our revised output gap forecast.\n\nChart 2.5: Contributions to CPI inflation\n\nBox 2.2: Economic implications of further instability in the Middle East\n\nThe prospect of a widening of the current conflict in the Middle East poses a significant risk to the global economy. So far, the economic impact has primarily been from disruption to Red Sea shipping. Shipping costs from China, measured by the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index, have risen to over twice the historical average, but remain less than half their pandemic peak. The impact on global energy markets appears modest to date. But given the region’s importance to global oil and gas supply, a surge in energy prices is a key risk in a more adverse scenario.\n\nTo explore the potential impact of further instability in the region, we use the World Bank’s October 2023 ‘large scale disruption’ scenario. This involves a cut to Middle East energy supplies comparable to the 1973 oil embargo.a In this scenario, wholesale oil and gas prices both rise to 75 per cent above our central forecast. Gas prices peak in early 2025 and oil prices peak in mid-2024 at an all-time nominal high. After a year, prices of both commodities quickly fall back to our central forecast. We also assume that disruption to global supply chains for goods intensifies and peaks in the final quarter of 2024.b\n\nIn this scenario, CPI inflation reaches a peak of 7.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2025 (Chart B). Informed by the recent energy shock and our analysis of its pass through to inflation, we assume inflation falls back towards baseline more slowly than it rose.c By the end of the forecast period, the price level is 6 per cent higher than baseline. The impact is driven by:\n\nDirect effect of energy prices (yellow bars). Higher oil prices feed quickly into consumer prices for fuel and raise the cost of oil intensive goods such as food and transport. The Ofgem price cap slows the impact of gas prices on consumer utilities prices, which peak in mid-2025.\n\nIndirect effect of energy prices (green bars). The second-round effects of the energy shock then dominate. Higher energy prices pass through into tradables and non-tradables prices, with a peak effect in mid-2025, keeping inflation above baseline until the beginning of 2026.\n\nImpact of supply chain disruptions (purple bars). To estimate the inflation impact of further disruption to global goods trade, we compute an impulse response based on IMF research, adapted to the UK economy.d The impact peaks in mid-2025 then fades over the next two years.\n\nChart B: CPI inflation in the adverse scenario\n\nBased on a modified version of our small model,e we assume Bank Rate would rise quickly in response to the shock, and that higher inflation and interest rates lead to a recession lasting just over a year, starting in the first half of 2025. The output gap troughs at around -5 per cent in mid-2026. Growth under this scenario quickly rebounds as inflation eases and Bank Rate falls below our central forecast. But by 2028, the economy remains around 1½ per cent smaller as some spare capacity remains. Over a longer period, we would expect the output gap to close and real GDP and Bank Rate to return to our central forecast as the effects of the shock fade. We explore the fiscal implications of this inflation scenario in Chapter 5.\n\nAs this scenario would entail a second large upside shock to inflation in quick succession, there is a risk that households and businesses begin to expect higher medium-term inflation. Should that happen, it would push domestically-driven inflation even higher, potentially prompting a stronger Bank Rate response and weaker GDP growth.\n\na) World Bank, Potential Near-Term Implications of the Conflict in the Middle East for Commodity Markets, October 2023.\n\nb) As measured by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index. The index reaches the same level as at the height of the pandemic, before falling back to the historical norm over the following year and a half.\n\nc) For more information see Box 2.1 of our 2023 Forecast evaluation report.\n\nd) Andriantomanga, Z., et al., Global Supply Chain Disruptions: Challenges for Inflation and Monetary Policy in Sub-Saharan Africa, February 2023.\n\ne) Given recent demand responses to changes in monetary policy, we have modified the small model so that the output gap responds to changes in the nominal Bank Rate. For more information see Working paper No.4: A small model of the UK economy, July 2012.\n\n2.12 RPI inflation has also fallen more sharply than we expected in our November forecast. It fell from a peak of 13.9 per cent in the final quarter of 2022 to 5.5 per cent in the final quarter of 2023. This was 1.2 percentage points lower than we expected in November. In our central forecast, RPI inflation falls to 1.7 per cent by the first quarter of 2025, as CPI inflation slows and growth in mortgage interest payments eases. We then expect RPI to increase steadily in line with CPI inflation, averaging 2.0 per cent in 2025, 2.5 per cent in 2026 and 2.9 from 2027 onwards.\n\n2.13 Annual growth in the GDP deflator, which measures the price of all domestically produced goods and services, was 7.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2023. This was 0.3 percentage points higher than we expected in November. The difference is largely explained by faster growth in the price of UK exports relative to imports. As with CPI and RPI, we expect GDP deflator growth to slow in the near term. We forecast 1.5 per cent growth in 2024 and 1.2 per cent in 2025, both around ½ a percentage point lower than our November forecast. GDP deflator growth then rises broadly in line with CPI inflation, leaving the level of the GDP deflator 0.4 per cent lower than in our November forecast in 2028-29.\n\nPotential output\n\n2.14 Our overall potential output forecast is little changed since November, but there have been significant revisions to its components. Chart 2.6 summarises the changes, and we describe each component in more detail in the rest of this section:\n\nThe level of potential output in 2023 is 0.1 per cent lower than in our November forecast. This is because we judge that around half the weakness in GDP outturns since November reflects structural factors. In terms of components, while the reweighted Labour Force Survey (LFS) indicates a larger adult population, this is offset by lower trend labour force participation and average hours worked. The latter are due to the updated demographic profile in the LFS and our analysis of the effects to date of fiscal drag (see Box 3.2). Overall, our estimate for potential total hours worked in 2023 is 0.4 per cent higher. With potential output slightly lower, the level of trend productivity in 2023 is 0.5 per cent lower.\n\nPotential output growth from 2024 to 2028 is unchanged from our November forecast on a pre-Budget measures basis, reflecting offsetting factors. Higher net migration over the forecast raises population growth. But this is offset by a lower trend participation rate and average hours worked in the UK adult population. The latter changes are driven by updated analysis of the demographic composition of the working-age population (see paragraph 2.18). The new data show the UK population is more concentrated in lower-participation groups (under-25s and women). Ongoing effects of fiscal drag also cut potential average hours.\n\nMeasures at this Budget raise potential output growth by a cumulative 0.2 percentage points over the forecast. As outlined in Box 2.1 this is largely from the impact of additional cuts to NICs, with changes to the high income child benefit charge making a small additional contribution.\n\nTaken together, these changes leave the level of potential output in 2028 marginally higher, up 0.1 per cent from November.\n\nChart 2.6: Potential output growth and level changes since November\n\nLabour supply\n\n2.15 Our forecast for potential labour supply incorporates findings from the reweighted LFS published in February. We have used this data as a guide to the UK’s current population and demographics. But there remains significant uncertainty around recent labour market data given the ONS will switch to its Transformed LFS survey later this year. This may have further implications for our understanding of labour supply and potential output.\n\n2.16 By the forecast horizon, we expect trend total hours worked to be 0.7 per cent higher than in November (Chart 2.7). This reflects a slightly higher starting point in the latest LFS outturn, followed by slightly higher forecast growth compared to November. On a pre-Budget measures basis, growth in trend total hours worked is broadly unchanged due to offsetting factors. The adult population grows more quickly across the forecast due to our updated migration assumptions. However, the latest data on the demographic composition of the working population and updated analysis of the impact of fiscal drag on work incentives mean we expect the participation rate and average hours to fall more quickly than in November. Budget measures offset this and raise total hours worked by 0.3 per cent by the forecast horizon (Box 2.1). Assumed future levels of net migration are a key source of uncertainty around our forecast for total hours worked, and the swathe in Chart 2.7 shows how hours worked would change under our alternative migration scenarios (Box 2.3).\n\nChart 2.7: Trend total hours worked\n\nAdult population\n\n2.17 Our forecast for the adult population of 57.3 million at the end of the forecast is a million people (1.8 per cent) higher than in November, mainly driven by higher net migration. Reweighted LFS outturn data now incorporate the historically high levels of migration from the last two years and the detailed results of the 2021 Census. The UK adult population in 2023 is now estimated to have been 54.8 million, almost 700,000 people larger (1.3 per cent) than the data suggested in November. We have also incorporated a higher future path for net migration, informed by recent data outturns and updated ONS population projections published in January. As a result, net migration falls from its mid-2023 level of 670,000 to settle at the ONS’s latest medium-term estimate of 315,000 at the forecast horizon, 70,000 higher than the 245,000 assumed in November. Box 2.3 discusses our latest forecast for net migration, and its potential economic impact, in more detail.\n\nBox 2.3: Net migration forecast and its impact on the economy\n\nUpdated ONS data published shortly after our November 2023 forecast showed large upward revisions to net migration – now estimated to have peaked at 745,000 in 2022, 140,000 higher than the initial estimate. The latest Home Office data show that visas granted (excluding visitors and temporary visas) peaked at around 1.4 million in the year to the first quarter of 2023, then fell back somewhat over the rest of the year (right panel, Chart C). Within this, work and especially dependant visas continued to grow in 2023, while student visas came down slightly and humanitarian visas fell sharply. New migrants come largely from non-EU countries, with EU net migration having fallen from over 250,000 in 2016 to turn negative in 2021 (left panel, Chart C). The large numbers and varying dynamics for types of visas create uncertainty for the path of net migration, whose potential effects we quantify in our scenarios below.\n\nChart C: Net migration by nationality and visas granted by type\n\nIn January, the ONS published updated net migration projections which assume net inflows follow a linear path downward from the latest outturn of around 670,000 in the year to mid-2023 to a medium-term level of 315,000 from 2027-28. This is 70,000 higher than the steady state level of 245,000 assumed in their last set of projections and used in our November 2023 forecast. The ONS based this new assumption on a 10-year historical average to mid-2023, with the choice of horizon reflecting consultation with an expert panel.a\n\nWe use the new ONS medium-term net migration projection as the end point of our five-year forecast. While there remains considerable uncertainty about this projection, we judge that it is a reasonable estimate of the steady state level of net migration informed by consultation with migration experts. However, we have adjusted the near-term path of net inflows to incorporate a sharper short-term decline than the ONS straight-line path (Chart D). This reflects two factors:\n\nFirst, the recent rise in immigration, especially among students, should lead to higher emigration in the short term.b\n\nSecond, immigration policy changes announced shortly after our November 2023 EFO will likely significantly reduce inflows in the near term.c The Home Office estimated those policies, together with those previously announced in May 2023, would cut immigration by 300,000 (mostly among dependants) under a hypothetical scenario where they were applied in the year to September 2023.d Most of the policies will have been introduced by April 2024, so we expect significantly reduced immigration levels from that point.\n\nThis means we now expect net migration to average around 350,000 a year over the forecast period, up from 290,000 in our November forecast. Cumulatively, this adds a further 350,000 people (around 300,000 adults) to the UK population over the next five years. However, these estimates are highly sensitive to alternative assumptions for future immigration levels, the share of previous immigrants that stay in the UK and the impact of government policy.\n\nChart D: Net migration forecast and scenarios\n\nIn constructing our economic forecast, we estimate that migrants coming to the UK over our forecast period have a slightly higher average participation rate than the adult UK resident population over our five-year forecast. This reflects a combination of three factors:\n\nAge: Migrants are more likely to be of working age (16-64) when they arrive.\n\nComposition: The post-Brexit composition of migrants has shifted more towards groups that have historically had lower participation rates (e.g. students and dependants). However, those groups have seen rising participation rates under the new migration system. For example, LFS data suggest that migrants coming to the UK to study are now more likely to be economically active, with their participation rate increasing from 30 per cent in 2019 to 48 per cent in the year to June 2023.e This is likely the result of the graduate route making it easier for students to enter the labour market after their studies.\n\nDynamics: In the medium term, the longer migrants stay, the more likely they are to participate. While this tends to reverse after 10 years, that is beyond our forecast horizon.\n\nGiven the uncertainty around future migration flows, we explore two alternative scenarios where net migration is 200,000 higher or lower in the medium term and the total population in 2028-29 is one million higher or lower than in our central forecast (Chart D).f In each scenario, we explore the implications of alternative assumptions for migrants’ productivity and participation in the labour force.\n\nIn the high migration scenario, net migration falls by around 160,000 from its current level to settle at 515,000 a year in 2028-29. Looking at its potential economic implications:\n\nThe blue bars assume the additional migrants have the same productivity per hour worked as the existing population.g This could reflect either investment responding so capital per worker is unchanged, or lower capital per worker offset by higher TFP growth. We also assume additional migrants have the same participation rate as the existing population. Based on these assumptions, GDP is 1.5 per cent higher in 2028-29, but GDP per person is largely unchanged.\n\nThe yellow triangles show what would happen if the capital stock did not adjust at all in response to higher migration, making less capital available per worker and reducing overall productivity. GDP in 2028-29 is still higher but by a smaller amount (1 per cent), but GDP per person is then 0.4 per cent below our central forecast.\n\nThe green diamonds show the impact of assuming additional migrants have a much higher participation rate than the adult UK population (around 90 rather than 63 per cent), consistent with a scenario where almost all adults arrive on work visas. This boosts the impact on GDP to 2.2 per cent in 2028-29 and raises GDP per person 0.8 per cent above our forecast.\n\nThe impacts in the lower migration scenario, in which net migration settles at 115,000 in 2028-29, are symmetric. These scenarios show that while additional (fewer) migrants generally boost (reduce) the level of aggregate output in the economy, the size of this impact and the effect on per person living standards is highly uncertain. The age, education, skill level, and participation rate of migrants, alongside the investment response of businesses, are all factors that determine the impact of migration on per person output. We explore the fiscal implications of net migration in Chapter 4.\n\nChart E: Real GDP and real GDP per person differences from our central forecast\n\na) The panel meeting took place on 12 December 2023, after the Government’s latest migration policies were announced.\n\nb) This is consistent with recent academic literature, as in: Hall, T., A.

Sumption, Projecting UK net migration, Centre for Economic Performance, Occasional Paper No.60, October 2023.\n\nc) These policies included: restricting social care workers from bringing dependants; requiring social care firms to be Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered to sponsor visas; raising the salary threshold for skilled worker visas; changes to the shortage occupation list; and raising the minimum income required for family visas. These were in addition to previously announced policies that restricted the majority of students from bringing dependants.\n\nd) Home Office, Legal migration statement: estimated immigration impacts, 21 December 2023.\n\ne) Based on LFS data shown in Box 2.3 in our November 2023 Economic and fiscal outlook.\n\nf) In line with the ONS projections, we have assumed around 85 per cent of those arriving are aged 16 or older.\n\ng) See Migration Advisory Committee, A points-based system and salary thresholds for immigration, January 2020, which concluded “the evidence base on the impact of migration on productivity is not as strong as it is for other areas of impact… the MAC view is that there is no strong evidence for there being large effects”.\n\nTrend participation in the labour force\n\n2.18 We have lowered our estimates of the historical and forecast trend participation rate relative to November. It is now broadly flat at 62.8 per cent over the forecast period and, by 2028, 0.5 percentage points lower than in November. This reflects the interplay of several factors:\n\nThe changing demographic composition of the population weighs on participation. The recent reweighting of the LFS increased the share of the 16- to-24-year-olds and women in the population. Also, ONS projections suggest that the share of the population aged 16-24 and over 65 is set to rise over the forecast period. As those groups have lower-than-average participation rates, this drags down on the overall participation rate both over history and over the forecast.\n\nWe also expect rising health-related inactivity to continue weighing on the participation rate of prime-age adults, as well as contributing to the rise in incapacity benefit caseloads (see Chapter 4). Reweighted LFS data show the long-term sick accounted for around 30 per cent of the inactive population, on average 0.4 percentage points more than previously estimated, or around 130,000 more people.\n\nPreviously announced measures over the fiscal events in 2023 (including the NICs, welfare and childcare reform measures) boost participation at the forecast horizon by around 0.6 per cent (for more information, see Box 3.2). Policies announced in this Budget boost participation by 0.1 per cent. Taken together, these outweigh the 0.2 per cent effect of fiscal drag.\n\nNet migration also raises the participation rate due to the age profile of new migrants. Recent immigration has seen a high concentration of students and dependants, who are less likely to participate than the overall population. But this is outweighed in our forecast by the age composition of migrants skewing towards prime working age, along with evidence that in the near term the longer migrants stay, the more likely they are to work.\n\nChart 2.8: Trend participation rate\n\nAverage hours worked\n\n2.19 Trend average hours worked also falls over our forecast due to the same demographic and policy effects that drive participation lower. Relative to our November forecast, trend average hours start 0.4 per cent lower in 2023 due to the updated demographics of the adult population in the reweighted LFS. On a pre-Budget measures basis, growth in average hours worked over the forecast is also slightly weaker (0.1 percentage points cumulatively) due to the impact of fiscal drag on work incentives. However, this is offset by the 0.2 percentage points boost from measures in this Budget (Box 2.1). As a result, trend average hours end the forecast 0.3 per cent lower than we expected in November.\n\nTrend productivity\n\n2.20 With the latest data indicating that the working population was larger, but output was slightly lower, our estimate of the starting level of trend productivity in 2023 is 0.5 per cent lower than in November. However, our forecast for average trend productivity growth over 2024 to 2028 is largely unchanged at 0.9 per cent. Productivity growth is composed of capital deepening – proxied by the change in the capital stock per hour worked – and total factor productivity (TFP) – the economy’s efficiency at combining capital and labour to produce output:\n\nCapital deepening contributes 0.2 percentage points to average annual productivity growth over 2024 to 2028, broadly unchanged from November.\n\nTFP contributes 0.7 percentage points to average productivity growth over 2024 to 2028, also unchanged from November. There are two small offsetting factors. We estimate that recent TFP growth has been weaker than expected, but lower medium-term gas prices add marginally to forecast TFP growth.\n\n2.21 The net effect of these changes leave the level of trend productivity 0.6 per cent lower in 2028 than in November, mostly reflecting recent data showing more hours worked within a largely unchanged level of output.\n\nReal GDP and the output gap\n\nReal GDP\n\n2.22 Real GDP grew by 0.1 per cent in 2023, 0.4 percentage points weaker than anticipated in our November 2023 forecast. This reflects ONS revisions, which lowered growth in the third quarter of 2023, and weaker-than-expected GDP growth in the fourth quarter (released after we finalised our forecast). Timely survey indicators generally suggest economic activity has stabilised and may be picking up slightly. For example, the S&P Global/CIPS UK composite PMI points to an expansion in activity in recent months, and the flash estimate for February edged up to around the historical average.\n\n2.23 We therefore forecast GDP growth to pick up only slightly to 0.8 per cent in 2024, as the economy continues to be constrained by weak real wage growth, the ongoing effects of recent interest rate rises and fading fiscal support. We expect growth to accelerate to around 2.0 per cent in 2026 as interest rates decline and spare capacity in the economy is used up. The output gap closes at the end of 2027 and growth then returns towards our estimate of potential, averaging 1.8 per cent in 2027 and 2028. At the end of the forecast period, the level of GDP is 0.1 per cent higher than in November.\n\n2.24 Risks to our real GDP forecast remain elevated. As always, the outlook for productivity growth is our most important and uncertain forecast judgement. The effects of subdued investment, the energy price shock and Brexit compound the ongoing weakness seen since the financial crisis. There are also significant risks to our participation and average hours forecasts from the effects of an ageing population and the outlook for long-term sickness among those of working age. As demonstrated by the scenarios in Box 2.3, there is also significant uncertainty around the level and composition of net migration over the forecast. The financial crisis, pandemic and energy price shock also showed that there is always the risk of an unforeseen external shock having a large impact on the UK. If past forecast errors are a reasonable guide to future ones, then the likelihood that annual GDP growth will be negative in 2024 is 2 in 5.\n\nChart 2.9: Real GDP growth forecast\n\n2.25 Real GDP per person has fallen continuously since the first quarter of 2022 (the longest sustained decline since records began in 1955) and fell by 0.7 per cent in 2023. In our central forecast, it troughs 1¼ per cent below its pre-pandemic peak in 2024 and only recovers to that peak in 2025. The level of real GDP per person is expected to be ¾ a per cent lower in 2028 than in our November forecast. This is driven by downward revisions to the starting point of GDP per person by the ONS, due to higher population outturns, and our lower forecast for trend participation. Our migration scenarios also demonstrate that while higher net migration has been a key driver of GDP growth in recent years, under plausible assumptions, it may not have a substantial impact on output per person.\n\nChart 2.10: Level of real GDP and real GDP per person\n\nOutput gap\n\n2.26 We judge that the economy has been operating with slightly more slack than we expected in November. This is consistent with the faster-than-expected drop in domestically generated inflation and widening survey indicators of spare capacity. We now estimate that the output gap was -0.1 per cent in the third quarter of 2023, 0.2 percentage points lower than in November. But the directly unobservable nature of the output gap means estimates of its size are extremely uncertain. We therefore use several models to inform our estimate (Chart 2.11). Most of our models suggest the output gap was around zero in the second half of 2023, with business surveys suggesting there is still some excess demand in the economy.\n\n2.27 The output gap is now forecast to widen from close to zero to trough around -1 per cent at the end of 2024. Policy measures in the Budget that boost demand are expected to lift the trough in the output gap by 0.1 percentage points. As GDP growth in our forecast picks up above potential in 2025, the negative output gap closes in the second half of 2027. This is around half a year earlier than estimated in November, largely due to lower market expectations for interest rates.\n\nChart 2.11: Output gap\n\nExpenditure composition of GDP growth\n\n2.28 Real consumption was weaker than forecast in the second half of 2023 and is expected to remain subdued in the near-term, growing 0.7 per cent in 2024. We forecast household spending growth to pick up from 2025, reaching an average of 2.0 per cent in 2025 and 2026, around ⅔ a percentage point higher than in November. The stronger consumption profile reflects higher household disposable incomes, a sharper slowdown in inflation, and lower interest rates. In the central forecast we assume the saving ratio will remain elevated in the near term before slowly declining to its long-run average (see paragraph 2.41). There are risks in both directions around our consumption forecast, reflecting uncertainty around future real wages, household saving and house prices.\n\n2.29 Business investment is volatile and has historically seen large revisions but was 3.0 per cent higher at the end of 2023 than we expected in November. We expect business investment to contract in the near term as past increases in interest rates raise the cost of capital and weigh on spending. Investment then strengthens as interest rates fall and economic demand picks up. Despite stronger medium-term growth, the nearer-term weakness means that cumulative investment over 2024 to 2028, and therefore the increase in the capital stock, is largely unchanged from November.\n\n2.30 We forecast that trade volumes will be subdued in the next few years due to sluggish growth in the UK and global economies, alongside the evolving impact of Brexit. Recent trade data have been volatile and subject to large revisions. However, they remain broadly consistent with our assumption that Brexit will reduce the UK’s trade intensity (exports plus imports as a share of GDP) by 15 per cent in the long term (see Box 2.4). From 2024 to 2028, we expect export volumes to grow by an average of 0.3 per cent, 0.1 percentage points higher than November. Import volumes are expected to rise 0.1 per cent a year on average over 2024‑2028, 0.4 percentage points higher than November, consistent with higher domestic demand. Recent disruptions in the Red Sea present a risk to global trade and energy prices (see Box 2.2), but our central forecast does not include a material impact on UK trade.\n\nChart 2.12: Contributions to real GDP growth\n\nBox 2.4: How are our Brexit trade forecast assumptions performing?\n\nSince the June 2016 EU referendum, our forecasts have assumed that the volume of UK imports and exports will both be 15 per cent lower than if we had remained in the EU. We assume that the resulting reduction in the trade intensity of GDP will lead to a 4 per cent reduction in the potential productivity of the UK economy (relative to remaining in the EU), with the full effect felt after 15 years. A decline in trade intensity plausibly lowers productivity because trade, among other channels, fosters competition and allows countries to specialise in activities where they are relatively more efficient.a This box assesses these assumptions against the latest evidence.b\n\nThe Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), signed in December 2020, set the terms of the post-Brexit trading relationship between the UK and EU. However, the application of the TCA remains ongoing, with the UK implementing physical inspections on imports from the EU from April 2024 and further declaration requirements from October 2024.\n\nOverall trade intensity in the UK and the rest of the G7\n\nTrade volumes in all advanced economies declined sharply at the height of the pandemic in 2020. However, UK trade intensity (exports plus imports as a share of GDP) has not recovered in line with other G7 countries since then (Chart F). In the third quarter of 2023, UK trade intensity remained 1.7 per cent below its pre-pandemic level from 2019. By contrast, it had risen 1.7 per cent above pre-pandemic levels on average in the rest of the G7.\n\nChart F: Trade intensity in the UK and rest of the G7\n\nMore stringent regulation of trade flows, the expectation of further regulatory tightening, and uncertainty over future trade policy may all have weighed on trade between the UK and EU over this period. Goods trade between EU countries and goods trade between the EU and the rest of the world grew more than a third between 2019 and 2022 in current prices. Meanwhile, goods trade between the UK and EU only grew by only around 10 per cent over the same period. An ONS survey of businesses from early 2024 indicates around half of exporting firms and two thirds of importing firms have reported extra costs associated with the changes in regulation since the end of the transition period. Similarly, the Bank of England Agents’ survey suggests EU trade frictions have weighed on export demand and may compound as new UK-EU regulations come into operation this year.c\n\nComposition of trade in the UK and the rest of the G7\n\nWithin UK trade, there has been a significant and growing divergence between the performance of goods and services since the pandemic (Chart G).\n\nGrowth in UK goods trade (exports plus imports) has fallen well behind the rest of the G7. At the end of 2023, UK goods trade was around 10 per cent below 2019 levels, while it was around 5 higher on average for the rest of the G7 in the third quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, UK services trade growth has been the strongest in the G7. It reached around 12 per cent above 2019 levels at the end of 2023, versus around 9 per cent above in the rest of the G7 in the third quarter.\n\nThe UK’s differential performance between goods and services trade post-Brexit likely reflects several factors. First, global trade in services, where the UK has a relative comparative advantage, has grown faster than global goods trades since 2008. Second, post-Brexit trade barriers have created more significant frictions for goods than services. Third, the UK is less dependent on the EU for services exports than goods exports – around a third of UK service exports go to the EU, compared to roughly half for goods.d Fourth, digitalisation makes trade in some services easier and less dependent on physical proximity than in the past.e\n\nChart G: Goods and services trade in the UK and rest of the G7\n\nWhat is driving the growth in UK services trade?\n\nUK services trade has continued to grow strongly, including with the EU, despite the increase in trade barriers post-Brexit. Looking at its sectoral composition, around two thirds of the growth in services trade volumes since 2019 has been driven by the ‘other business services’ sector, which includes management consulting, research & development, and advertising (Chart H). By contrast, exports of financial services and transport have lagged other sectors, declining 5.9 per cent and 2.0 per cent respectively. These are also sectors which are more likely to have been impacted by Brexit frictions.f\n\nThe recent strong growth in the UK’s exports in ‘other business services’ could reflect several factors. First, trade barriers with the EU may be lower for these kinds of services than goods or other, more highly regulated, services such as banking.g Second, there has been particularly strong growth in service exports to the US, possibly capturing US firms outsourcing work to the UK, supported by the recent weakness in the pound.h Finally, there is some evidence that services firms may have circumvented trade barriers by selling through foreign affiliates.i\n\nChart H: Breakdown of growth in UK service exports since 2016\n\nOverall, our assumptions about the impact of Brexit appear to be broadly on track and recently published studies are also broadly consistent with these estimates.j However, it remains hard to draw firm conclusions given the challenges of disentangling the simultaneous impacts of Brexit, the pandemic, and other geopolitical developments affecting UK and global trade. Trade data are also volatile and prone to revision, particularly trade in services. Moreover, the full implementation of the TCA will further increase barriers to trade in goods with the EU. We expect the total impact of Brexit to be realised several years after full implementation of these barriers. In the meantime, we will keep our Brexit assumptions under review.\n\na) OBR, Brexit and the OBR’s forecasts, October 2018.

Goldman Sachs, UK – The structural and cyclical costs of Brexit, February 2024 estimates a GDP impact of 5 per cent since the referendum.\n\nLabour market\n\n2.31 Our forecast incorporates the reweighted ONS LFS estimates, released in February, of the size and composition of the UK population. While this improves the representativeness of the data, problems with low sample sizes and volatility in recent periods will take longer to resolve.[4] We have therefore placed less weight on the LFS data for the last six months when thinking about the near-term outlook. Instead, we look at a wider range of indicators such as administrative data sources and surveys.\n\nParticipation\n\n2.32 Following the pandemic, the number of inactive working-age people rose by around 750,000 to its peak in mid-2022 and remained close to these levels at the end of 2023. Previous LFS estimates had suggested a fall in inactivity in early 2023. But in the new data, inactivity increased by 120,000 from the end of 2022 to the end of 2023 to return to an 11-year high of 9.3 million (left panel, Chart 2.13). Inactivity due to long-term sickness reached 2.8 million, around a third of the total (right panel, Chart 2.13) and a rise of 200,000 over the year to 2023. This picture ties in with the sharp rise in the number of incapacity benefit claimants,[5] which rose 20.3 per cent between 2019-20 and 2022-23, from 2.5 million to 3.1 million. Inactivity for other reasons in the reweighted LFS is also different to previous estimates. The shares of students and carers in the inactive population are now respectively 0.6 and 0.3 percentage points higher, while the share of retirees is 0.5 percentage points lower.[6]\n\nChart 2.13: Inactivity of 16-to-64-year-olds\n\n2.33 The reweighted LFS data show the participation rate was 62.8 per cent in the final quarter of 2023. This is 1.5 percentage points below its peak of 64.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2020 and 0.5 percentage points below our November forecast. A combination of demographic effects and the impact of Budget policies outlined in paragraph 2.14 mean the participation rate remains broadly flat across the forecast. At 62.8 per cent in 2026, our forecast is very close to the Bank of England’s forecast of 62¾.\n\nUnemployment and employment\n\n2.34 From a post-pandemic trough of 3.6 per cent in the three months to August 2022, the LFS unemployment rate increased to 4.3 per cent in the three months to July 2023. According to the reweighted LFS data, unemployment has since fallen to 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023. In contrast, claimant count data measuring the number of people on unemployment benefits have remained flat in recent months, while the redundancy rate has been on a slow upwards trend since the middle of 2022. The number of vacancies per unemployed has also fallen further over the last year, and recent surveys suggest that recruitment and retention are now less of an issue for firms.\n\n2.35 We judge that this and wider evidence is consistent with some further loosening in labour market conditions. We expect a moderate rise in the unemployment rate, peaking at 4.5 per cent in the last quarter of 2024, in line with our forecast for subdued economic growth and increasing slack. The peak in unemployment, which represents a total of around 1.6 million people looking for work, is marginally lower than in our November forecast, though it comes half a year sooner. The unemployment rate is then forecast to decline to its estimated structural level of 4.1 per cent in 2028.\n\n2.36 LFS reweighting has increased the level of employment, but the employment rate remains close to post-pandemic lows and employment growth has been weakening across a range of indicators. The employment rate is expected to fall from 60.2 per cent in the final quarter of 2023 to 60.0 per cent in the final quarter of 2024. By the end of the forecast, we expect the employment rate to reach 60.1 per cent, 0.5 percentage points lower than in our November forecast, reflecting a lower medium-term participation rate. This leaves the employment rate 0.6 percentage points lower than its post-pandemic peak of 60.8 per cent.\n\nChart 2.14: Unemployment and employment rates\n\nAverage earnings\n\n2.37 From a thirty-year peak of close to 7 per cent in 2023, we expect nominal average pay growth to slow to 3.6 per cent in 2024. This is 0.2 percentage points lower than our November forecast, pulled down by a more rapid slowdown in inflation and some loosening in labour market conditions. There is some stickiness in pay settlement expectations, which remain between 5 and 5½ per cent for 2024. But we do not expect repeats of the strong bonus growth and one-off cost of living payments seen last year. As inflation falls below target and slack remains in the labour market, we expect nominal earnings growth to fall to around 2 per cent in 2025 and 2026. In our central forecast earnings growth rises to around 2½ per cent in the final year as the output gap closes and inflation returns to target. The level of wages and salaries, a key determinant of our fiscal forecast, is 0.3 per cent lower at the forecast horizon than in November, broadly in line with our revision to nominal GDP. Weaker nominal earnings growth in the medium term more than offsets modestly faster growth in employees.\n\n2.38 In real terms, we expect earnings to grow 1.4 per cent in 2024, 1.1 percentage points stronger than we forecast in November, as wage settlement expectations have held up despite falling inflation. Real earnings growth then slows to 0.3 per cent in 2026 before gradually recovering closer to productivity growth of 1 per cent at the forecast horizon. A key risk to the near-term outlook is if the labour market proves tighter than expected, keeping pay settlements higher over the coming year. As well as posing an upside risk to our forecast for inflation, this is also a key sensitivity for our fiscal forecast. Higher-than-expected wage growth would, all else equal, drive stronger tax receipts.\n\nChart 2.15: Nominal and real earnings growth\n\nHousehold income and saving\n\n2.39 Based on ONS outturn to the third quarter of 2023, we estimate that real household disposable income (RHDI) per person, a measure of living standards, grew 0.8 per cent in the 2023-24 fiscal year. This follows a fall of 2.2 per cent in 2022-23 – the largest year-on-year drop in living standards since records began in the 1950s. And rather than continue falling in 2024-25 as we forecast in November, we now expect RHDI per person to continue its rebound and grow on average by 1 per cent a year over the forecast period. Falling inflation in 2023-24 and 2024-25 (blue bars in Chart 2.16) partly reflect lower commodity prices which reverse the terms of trade hit seen in 2022-23 and provide a boost to RHDI per person growth. While the pass-through to deposit rates of increases in interest rates supported the growth in RHDI per person in 2022-23 and 2023-24, we expect this to reverse over the course of 2024-25 as higher rates feed through into most fixed-term mortgage contracts (purple bars). Tax and benefits policy contributes to RHDI growth in 2024-25 but, over the forecast period, lower uprating of indexed welfare payments acts as a drag on growth (yellow bars).\n\n2.40 With RHDI per person growing from 2023-24 rather than falling for three consecutive years, we now expect it to regain its pre-pandemic peak in 2025-26, two years earlier than in the November forecast. This is largely driven by a faster recovery from the terms of trade shock and a higher share of whole-economy income going to labour in the near term. At the forecast horizon, RHDI per person is around 1 per cent higher than in our November forecast. Lower consumer prices raise RHDI per person by 1.3 per cent relative to November. Consistent with lower inflation, labour incomes per person subtract 0.7 per cent by 2028-29 (the offset is not complete due to the improvement in the terms of trade). And forecast and policy changes to household benefits and taxes raise RHDI per person by 0.6 per cent. The 2 pence cut to the main rates of NICs announced in this Budget alone is expected to directly boost real household incomes by 0.5 per cent. This adds to a boost of similar size from the NICs cut announced in the Autumn Statement 2023. These estimates do not account for behavioural responses to the policy or fiscal drag arising from frozen tax thresholds in combination with strength in nominal earnings growth (described in Box 3.2).\n\nChart 2.16: Real household disposable income per person\n\n2.41 We expect the adjusted household saving rate (excluding pensions) to remain above 4 per cent in the near term, before declining slightly to 3½ per cent at the forecast horizon. We estimate saving as a share of household disposable income was 4.3 per cent in 2023, 1.1 percentage points higher than expected in November, as consumption was somewhat weaker and incomes higher. In the near term, a weakening labour market should motivate higher precautionary saving, while elevated deposit rates encourage savings that yield interest returns. In the final years of the forecast, adjusted household saving is projected to return only slowly towards its long-run average as interest rates remain high. The headline saving ratio, which also accounts for pension fund accumulation, is estimated to have reached 9.1 per cent in 2023 and is forecast to fall to just below 8 per cent by 2028. This is similar to the November forecast as higher non-pension saving is offset by lower pension valuations given recent movements in interest rate expectations.\n\nCredit conditions and the housing market\n\n2.42 Average interest rates on the stock of mortgages are expected to rise to a peak of 4.2 per cent in 2027. This is up from a low of 2 per cent at the end of 2021 and above the average mortgage interest rate in the 2010s of around 3 per cent. But it is 0.8 percentage points lower than our November forecast, driven by substantial falls in market expectations for Bank Rate. However, there are significant risks to our mortgage rate forecast, demonstrated by the large movements in Bank Rate expectations since November. This also poses a risk to household incomes, residential housing transactions and house prices.\n\n2.43 As Bank Rate rose to reach its current level in the third quarter of 2023, housing transactions fell to 256,000, down more than 40 per cent from the post-pandemic peak. Leading survey indicators from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors suggest that the market will remain weak, but there are signs that demand is beginning to recover as interest rates on new mortgages continue to fall in anticipation of cuts in Bank Rate. Our central forecast is for residential property transactions to be broadly flat 2024, compared to a fall of 7 per cent in our November forecast. Transactions then recover in our forecast, reaching pre-pandemic levels in early 2025, two years before we expected in November.\n\n2.44 In our central forecast, we expect house prices to fall around 2 per cent in 2024, slightly under half of the 5 per cent we expected in November. This is mainly due to our lower mortgage rate forecast. The average house price in the UK is forecast to fall to slightly under £275,000 in the final quarter of 2024. Supported by falling new mortgage rates, we then expect house prices to grow around 2 per cent in 2026, and around 3½ per cent in 2027 and 2028. That would see nominal house prices surpass their historical peak in the first quarter of 2027.\n\nChart 2.17: Mortgage rates and house prices\n\nThe current account and sectoral net lending\n\n2.45 The current account deficit narrowed from 3.1 per cent of GDP in 2022 to an estimated 2.6 per cent in 2023. This was driven by a narrowing in the trade deficit due to a recovery in the UK’s terms of trade – the price of exports relative to imports."
