        "text": "(i) USA\n\nA series of studies of employees of the Exxon (also known as Humble and Esso) Company in the USA began with a report published in 1940 describing cancer mortality and incidence among male employees of a petroleum refining company who were enrolled in a sickness benefit plan between 1933 and 1938 (Gafafer & Sitgreaves, 1940). A total of 70 cases of cancer were observed among men who contributed about 60 000 person-years of risk during the study period. There were 46 deaths from cancer; 19 were stomach cancer and 13 were cancers of other abdominal organs. The authors noted that the proportion of digestive cancer deaths observed in the study group (69.6%) was higher than that observed in the general US population (57.8%); however, this comparison was not adjusted for age.\n\nCancer mortality among 15 437 employees of the Humble Oil Company in the Gulf Coast states was examined for a 29-year period ending in 1963 (Baird, 1967). This study included plants previously studied by Gafafer and Sitgreaves (1940), Hendricks et al. (1959) and Wade (1963) and consisted of workers in exploration, pipeline, production, refining and sales operations. The proportion of cancer deaths for the period 1935–55 among Humble Oil employees was 12.1% compared with 13.8% for the USA in 1945, unadjusted for age. The proportion of cancer deaths among the 6239 company employees who had worked in petroleum refining was 11.2%. The author concluded that there was no relative excess of cancer deaths among Humble Oil Company employees. [The Working Group noted that there was no adjustment for age, sex or race, and that cancer mortality was not presented by site, length of service or work category (e.g., production, maintenance, office workers).]\n\nAn elevated risk for cancer of the scrotum was observed among wax pressmen who had been employed for ten years or more during the period 1 January 1937 through 31 December 1956 in an Esso oil refinery (Exxon) in Baton Rouge, LA, where paraffin wax was manufactured (Hendricks et al., 1959; Lione & Denholm, 1959). Cancer incidence among all workers in the refinery was compared with that for the US general white male population at the midpoint of the 20-year study period (Hendricks et al., 1959). Although the overall cancer incidence rate for the refinery workers in general did not exceed that for the USA, wax pressmen who had worked for ten or more years had an overall cancer incidence rate that was more than four times that of US men. Among the 82 pressmen, the rate of scrotal cancer was 806/100 000 (11 cases) compared to a rate of 0.15/100 000 expected on the basis of the experience of US white men. In addition, three cases of stomach cancer and three of cancers at other digestive sites were observed among the wax pressmen; however, expected numbers were not calculated. The scrotal cancer cases occurred only among men who had skin contact with crude wax saturated with aromatic oils.\n\nA cohort of 8666 workers at the Exxon Baton Rouge, LA, petroleum refinery and chemical plant, some of whom may have been included in the study of Baird (1967), comprised workers who had been employed for at least one month between 1 January 1970 and 31 December 1977 and retirees who were alive on 1 January 1970 (Hanis et al., 1982). About 24% of the employees had begun work at the refinery prior to 1940, and another 24% in 1940–44; however, no information was presented on duration of employment. The mortality experience of the cohort from 1970 to 1977 was compared with that of the total US population, and SMRs adjusted for sex, age, calendar period and race were calculated; 835 employees (9.6%) were lost to follow-up; 85% of those lost were under 40 years of age. There was a significant deficit of all causes of death. The SMRs for pancreatic and renal cancers were elevated, but not significantly so. The renal cancer cases were seen only among employees who had worked as operators, mechanics or labourers and had been hired before 1956. [The Working Group noted the short follow-up period, and that there was no analysis by duration of employment. All of the persons studied are included in the following report.]\n\nA cohort mortality study of employees of three Exxon refineries and chemical plants in Baton Rouge, LA, Bay way/ Bayonne, NJ and Baytown, TX, included 15 437 employees who had worked for at least one month during the period 1 January 1970 to 31 December 1977 and followed through 1977, and 6261 retired employees who were alive on 1 January 1970 (Hanis et al., 1985a). More than 50% of the workers had first been employed in 1949 or earlier; 98.7% of workers were followed up. The mortality experience of the Exxon employees was compared with that of the total US population, adjusting for age, sex, race and calendar period. The SMR for all causes of death was significantly less than 1.0. Slight excess mortality was reported for cancers of the liver/gall-bladder/bile ducts, kidney and brain (ICD8 191, 192), primarily among employees hired prior to 1956. At the Baytown, TX, plant, there were elevated SMRs for cancers of the bone, kidney and brain, but none was significant. Among workers at the Bay way/Bayonne, NJ, plant, SMRs were elevated for cancers of the stomach, large intestine, lung and kidney. No analysis was shown by job class (blue-collar, white-collar) or job title. [The Working Group noted the short period of follow-up for many of the employees.]\n\nIn further analyses of the Exxon refineries and chemical plants in Baton Rouge, LA, Baytown, TX, and Bayway/Bayonne, NJ, mortality was examined by occupation and work site (Hanis et al., 1985b). Directly adjusted death rates for each subgroup of interest and for the total US population were calculated using the age, sex, race and calendar year distribution of the total cohort as a standard; thus, direct comparisons could be made between mortality rates in cohort subgroups and in the US population by calculating ratios of the directly adjusted rates. Workers were classified as having been ‘potentially exposed’ or ‘unexposed’ on the basis of their longest-held job. The ‘exposed’ category included those who had worked as process operators, mechanical workers and labourers (75% of the study population); while the ‘unexposed’ category included primarily white-collar office workers (22% of the population). Cause-specific cancer rates were higher among potentially exposed workers than among the unexposed for every cancer site except brain, but none of the site-specific rate ratios was significantly different from 1.0. Directly adjusted death rates were consistently greater than those for the total US population only for renal cancer in each of the three plants. The death rates for pancreatic cancer were higher than the US rates among employees at the Baton Rouge and Baytown plants only, and elevated rates of large intestinal cancer occurred at the Baytown and Bayway/Bayonne plants.\n\nA series of investigations of mortality has been performed among members of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers international union (OCAW) in Texas (Thomas et al., 1980, 1982a,b, 1984). In all of these reports, proportionate mortality among male members of the OCAW was compared with that among US men, adjusting for age, race and calendar period.\n\nThe first report concerned 3105 Union members in Texas whose deaths in 1947–77 while actively employed were reported to OCAW and whose death certificates could be located (90%; Thomas et al., 1980). Of the white OCAW members, 1722 had held blue-collar jobs in petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants, primarily in maintenance and production (Thomas et al., 1982a), and had significant excess frequencies of deaths from cancers of the digestive and respiratory systems, skin and brain (ICD8 191, 192).\n\nSubsequent analyses were limited to three petroleum refineries located in the Beaumont/Port Arthur area of the Texas Gulf Coast (Thomas et al., 1982a,b, 1984) and included 1194 retired workers as well as those who had died while actively employed between 1943 and 1979. Among 2509 deceased men who had been employed by the three refineries combined (Thomas et al., 1982a,b), the adjusted PMRs using national rates for all causes of death were significantly elevated for all cancers as well as for cancers of the stomach, pancreas, skin (ICD8 172, 173), prostate and brain (ICD8 191, 192) and for leukaemia. Nine deaths from multiple myeloma were observed and 4.6 were expected, but the PMR was not significant. When national cancer rates were used to calculate proportionate cancer mortality ratios (PCMRs), these ratios were also elevated but significantly so only for brain and leukaemia in whites. When county cancer mortality rates were used, none of the PCMRs was significantly raised. A detailed examination of brain tumour mortality in whites indicated that OCAW members had had elevated frequencies of mortality from benign and unspecified tumours of the brain as well as those specified on death certificates as malignant. [The Working Group noted that, of the 2509 deaths studied, 1161 had also been included in the previous study (Thomas et al., 1980) and that the completeness of records for retired workers is unknown.]\n\nIn a nested case-control study, complete work histories of decedents with brain cancer, stomach cancer and leukaemia (31, 52 and 34 cases, respectively) were compared with those of a (1:3) control series of decedents matched by age, sex, date of death, date of first union membership and refinery (Thomas et al., 1984). Cancer-specific relative risks by occupational category were estimated by calculating maximum likelihood estimates of odds ratios using a procedure for matched data. An elevated risk for brain cancer was seen among men who had been involved in intraplant pumping and transport of bulk liquids; however, the median duration of employment in these jobs was shorter for the cases than for the controls. The risk for stomach cancer mortality was elevated among men who had worked in the manufacture of lubricating oils and in refinery maintenance work. Mortality from leukaemia was slightly elevated among men who had worked in operations that involved alkylation, polymerization, the reduction of sulfur constituents of petroleum products and the blending of additives (treating category) and among men who had worked as boiler makers. There was no significant trend by duration of employment for any work category.\n\nIn a retrospective cohort study (Divine et al., 1985), standardized mortality among 19 077 white men who had been employed for a minimum of five years by the Texaco company in refinery, petrochemical or research facilities was determined for the period 1 January 1947 to 31 December 1977. Of these, 14 609 (76.6%) were alive on 31 December 1977, and 4024 (21.1%) were dead, and for 444 (2.3%) vital status was unknown. Death certificates were not obtained for 152 (3.8%) of the decedents. Expected mortality was calculated using rates for US white men, adjusting for age and calendar period. There was no significant excess of mortality for any cancer site; however, SMRs were slightly elevated for cancers of the pancreas and brain, leukaemia, cancer of‘other lymphatic tissues’ and a category of benign neoplasms which included brain tumours. [The Working Group noted that the cohort included workers in refinery, petrochemical and research facilities; that data were not shown by duration of employment or time since first employment; and that 1008 workers at refinery A in the study of Thomas et al. (1980,1982a,b, 1984) who had died between 1947 and 1977 were included in this study.]\n\nA second investigation of mortality among Texaco employees included 18 798 white men from the earlier analyses for whom complete work histories were available (Divine & Barron, 1986). The cohort was followed for an average of 19 years. Among men who had worked as refinery operators for more than one year, there were nonsignificant excesses of brain cancer, leukaemia, cancer of other lymphatic tissues (ICD7 202, 203, 205) and benign neoplasms; these excesses were smaller in men with five or more years' employment as an operator. Men who had been employed as maintenance workers for at least five years had elevated SMRs for cancer at the following sites: pancreas, kidney, skin (ICD7 190), brain (ICD7 193), Hodgkin's disease, cancer of other lymphatic tissues and benign neoplasms. Among subjects who had worked as laboratory workers for at least five years, there was a slight excess of mortality from brain cancer (ICD7 193) and benign neoplasms (ICD7 210–239). The only significant cancer excess noted in this study was for leukaemia among men employed as pipe fitters and boiler makers for more than five years. No consistent pattern of increasing mortality was seen by time since first employment or duration of employment for brain tumours among laboratory workers or leukaemia among pipe fitters and boiler makers.\n\nIn a cohort study at the Gulf Port Arthur, TX, refinery, all 15 095 men employed for more than one day between 1 January 1937 and 1 January 1978 were followed for vital status on 1 January 1978. Of these, 972 (6.4%) were lost to follow-up; death certificates were not available for 277 (6.5%) of the 4269 male decedents. The average follow-up was 24.7 years. Expected mortality was determined from rates in the US general population, adjusted for age, race and calendar period. Excesses were seen for cancers of the bone, skin, kidney, Hodgkin's disease, leukaemia and cancer of ‘other lymphatic tissue’. Only the result for cancer of the bone was significant. When white, blue-collar employees were evaluated separately, SMRs greater than 1 were observed for cancers of the pancreas, lung, bone, skin, prostate, eye and kidney, and for Hodgkin's disease and leukaemia; however, only the SMR for cancer of the bone was significant (Wen et al., 1983). [The Working Group noted that the ICD8 code cited to describe the category ‘cancer of other lymphatic tissue’ is probably in error and should have been reported as 202–203, 208.]\n\nSMRs for kidney cancer were examined in a separate publication by time since first employment and duration employed; no trend was observed (Wen et al., 1984a).\n\nA separate analysis with regard to employment status (retired, terminated before retirement age, actively employed) was performed on the white men in this cohort. The number of such employees was 12 526; 730 (5.8%) were lost to follow-up, 724 of whom were in the terminated group in which 88% were followed-up successfully (Wen et al., 1984b). Among those who had been actively employed, nonsignificant excess mortality was observed for cancers of bone and kidney and for leukaemia. Among white men who had terminated their employment at the refinery prior to retirement, there was excess mortality from cancers of the lung, bone, skin (ICD8 172, 173) and prostate and from Hodgkin's disease. Mortality among retired men was elevated for cancers of the lung, bone, skin (ICD8 172, 173), prostate, kidney and brain, leukaemia and cancer of ‘other lymphatic tissues’ (ICD8 202–203, 208). None of the results was significant. Data were not shown by duration of employment, but retirees were assumed to have worked a minimum of 15 years.\n\nIn an interim report on 15 698 male and 1823 female workers employed on 15 June 1935 and followed until 31 December 1979 (4766 deaths; 87% follow-up), nonsignificant excess mortality from brain tumours (malignant, benign and unspecified combined) was observed among men who had been employed for 20 or more years (Wen et al., 1982). No variation in SMR was reported for specific cancer sites by calendar period of employment (Wen et al., 1986). [The Working Group noted that the 882 employees at refinery B in the study of Thomas et al., (1980,1982a,b, 1984) who had died between 1947 and 1977 were included in the studies of Wen et al.]\n\nMortality among 1008 men who had worked at any time between 15 June 1935 and 1 January 1978 in the lubricating oil department at the Gulf Port Arthur, TX, refinery was examined separately (Wen et al., 1985). In this department, lubricating oil was manufactured, and wax was separated from the product using a solvent dewaxing process. A mixture of benzene and methyl ethyl ketone was used in the dewaxing process until 1945, when toluene replaced the benzene. There was a significant excess of bone cancer (SMR, 10.3) based on three deaths; nonsignificant excesses were seen for cancers of the stomach, pancreas and prostate and for all lymphopoietic cancer. Mortality for cancer of the prostate increased with duration employed and was excessive only after 20 years of employment. Seven of the eight prostatic cancer deaths occurred among men who had worked in the lubricating oil department but had not been involved in the solvent dewaxing process.\n\nRefinery C studied by Thomas et al. (1980, 1982a,b, 1984) was included in a report by Wong and Raabe (1989). A cohort of all individuals employed at the Mobil Beaumont, TX, petroleum refinery for at least one year between 1 January 1945 and 1 January 1979 was comprised of 6139 employees (1582 deaths; 123 354 person-years). Also included in this report were the Mobil refineries in Paulsboro, NJ (1946–79: number of employees, 4263; number of deaths, 1164) and Torrance, CA (1959–78: number of employees, 1621; number of deaths, 250). Observed mortality in the study cohorts was compared with that expected on the basis of rates for the general US population, adjusted for age, calendar period, sex and race. At the Beaumont, TX, refinery, SMRs were elevated for cancers of the pancreas, skin (ICD8 172,173), prostate and brain, but were not significant; mortality from lymphatic and haematopoeitic cancer was significantly elevated, due to excess mortality from lymphosarcoma, reticulosarcoma, leukaemia and cancer of ‘other lymphatic tissues’(ICD8 202–203, 208). Mortality from lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers increased with duration of employment at the Beaumont, TX, refinery. Mortality from leukaemia was significantly elevated among white men with 30 years' service or more and with 20–39 years' latency. A nonsignificant excess of prostatic cancer was reported at the Paulsboro refinery, and the SMR was significantly elevated among white male employees who had worked for at least 20 years (SMR, 1.6). The SMR for cancer of ‘other lymphatic tissues’ (ICD8 202–203, 208) was also slightly elevated at the Paulsboro refinery but was not significant. Slight excesses of mortality from stomach and brain cancer were reported at the Torrance refinery.\n\nWhite male employees (blue-collar and white-collar) of the Shell Oil Wood River refinery in southern Illinois who had worked for at least one day during the period 1 January 1973 to 31 December 1982 and retirees who were alive on 1 January 1973 comprised a cohort of 3976 men, 8% of whom had left employment for reasons other than retirement and were lost to follow-up (McCraw et al., 1985). Using mortality rates for US white men as a comparison, the SMR for all causes of death was 0.76 (640 observed). SMRs were shown separately only for lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasms; all other cancers were grouped. The SMR for leukaemia was significantly elevated. Mortality from cancer of ‘other lymphatic tissues’ (ICD8 202–203, 208) was slightly, but not significantly, elevated. There was no excess of other cancers combined. The expected number of deaths from acute myeloid leukaemia was estimated from data on cell-type-specific mortality from US cancer registries, and a significant excess was seen. The authors determined that none of the 14 men who had died from leukaemia were known to have worked in jobs with potentially high exposure to benzene; however, five of the men had been maintenance employees who had worked in numerous plant locations, and their potential exposure to benzene was unknown.\n\nNo analysis was shown by duration of employment or job category. A nested case-control study was conducted to evaluate the work histories of the 14 leukaemia deaths observed in this study (Austin et al., 1986), which were compared with those of 50 controls matched on year of birth. Cases did not appear to be clustered in any particular job or work area, and there was no evidence that the cases had had greater opportunity for exposure to benzene than had the controls. [The Working Group noted the short period of follow-up and the small size of the cohort.]\n\nAll employees who had worked for at least one year between 1 January 1950 and 31 December 1980 at the Chevron refineries in Richmond and El Segundo, CA, comprised a cohort of 14 179 workers (Wong et al., 1986). In all, 2292 deaths were identified; death certificates were obtained for 98%. Cause-specific SMRs adjusted for age, race, sex and calendar year were calculated using the US general population rates as standard. The SMRs for all causes of death were significantly low for both refineries, individually and combined. The only site-specific cancer excesses noted were for cancer of the brain (ICD8 191, 192), for lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma and for cancer of ‘other lymphatic tissues’ (ICD8 202–203, 208), none of which was significant. SMRs for these cancer sites were elevated among people who had been employees at the Richmond refinery, but not among those at the El Segundo refinery. Employees were classified into three work categories — laboratory, maintenance, operating — on the basis of their first and last jobs. Excess mortality from brain cancer occurred only among employees who had worked in maintenance or as operators. Mortality from cancers of ‘other lymphatic tissues’ was elevated among cohort members who had worked in any of the three subcategories of blue-collar workers. None of the results by work category was significant. SMRs for cancer of the brain and of ‘other lymphatic tissues’ were highest ten to 19 years after first employment and decreased after 20 years since first employment. The SMR for brain cancer was highest among workers who had been employed for five to 14 years, but decreased after 15 years of employment. The SMR for lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma increased with duration of employment to 1.6 (14 observed) among employees who had worked for 15 or more years.\n\nA cohort mortality study of all Amoco Oil Company employees who had worked for at least six months between 1 January 1970 and 31 December 1980 in any of ten refineries included 9192 white male workers, followed until 31 December 1982 (Nelson et al., 1987). Approximately 2% were lost to follow-up. The mortality experience of refinery workers was compared with that of US white men, adjusting for age and calendar period. The SMR for all causes of death was significantly less than 1. The SMR for all digestive cancers was slightly, but not significantly, elevated. SMRs for cancers at several digestive sites including stomach, large intestine and rectum were elevated among men who had worked as operators; the SMR for rectal cancer was also elevated in maintenance workers. Mortality from skin cancer (ICD8 172,173) was significantly elevated, and the excess occurred almost exclusively among men who had worked in maintenance jobs. There was also significant excess mortality from skin cancer among men whose exposure to refinery processes was considered to have been routine.\n\nA Conoco plant in the USA which began as a small petroleum refinery in 1915 and was converted to a petrochemical plant between 1947 and 1949 was the subject of a report by Decouflé et al., (1983). During the period that the plant was a petroleum refinery, the products were gasolines, light oils, bunker oils, lubricating oils and wax. After conversion to a petrochemical plant, the primary products were alkyl benzene compounds. The study cohort included 259 men (blue-collar and white-collar) employed between 1 January 1947 and 31 December 1960. The cohort was followed for vital status through 31 December 1977, and observed mortality was compared with the expected rates of US white men, adjusting for age and calendar period. Mortality from lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers among the 194 subjects who had been employed for at least one year at the plant was significantly elevated; one of the cases had multiple myeloma, one had acute monocytic leukaemia, one had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and the fourth had multiple myeloma (treated with radiotherapy and melphalan) followed by acute myelomonocytic leukaemia two years later. The first three cases had begun their employment at the plant prior to 1947, and, thus, had worked there during both the refinery and petrochemical phases.\n\nA cohort of 19 991 male workers who had worked for at least one year between 1 January 1962 and 1 December 1980 in one of 17 US refineries (Wong & Raabe, 1988), 51.3% of whom had been hired between 1940 and 1954 and 17.2% before 1940, was followed for vital status through 31 December 1980, and the mortality experience of the cohort was compared with that of US men, adjusting for race, age and calendar period (Kaplan, 1986). Altogether, 3349 deaths were observed; 707 (3.5%) persons were lost to follow-up. The only site-specific cancer for which excess mortality was noted was that of ‘other lymphatic tissues’ (ICD 202–203, 208), but this was not significant; 16 of the 30 deaths in this category were due to multiple myeloma. [The Working Group noted that no analysis was shown by duration of employment or latency.]\n\nA prospective cohort study conducted by Schottenfeld et al., (1981) gave morbidity and mortality among men who had been petroleum industry employees in 19 US companies. A total of 55 007 white male petroleum refinery workers who had been working at any time between 1 January 1977 and 31 December 1979 were included in the analyses; 30 769 were first employed in 1960 or after. Mortality rates during the study period were compared with those of US white men in 1977. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for cancer were calculated using rates for US white men obtained from cancer registry data. Among refinery workers, the SMR for all causes of death was significantly less than 1, and significant deficits were noted for many individual causes of death. There was a slight, nonsignificant excess of mortality from brain tumours. There was a significantly elevated incidence of lymphocytic leukaemia, and incidence was slightly elevated for cancers of the larynx and brain and for melanoma. The authors noted that there was underreporting of deaths. [The Working Group noted the short follow-up period (average, 1.6 years), which can result in either higher or lower figures. No analysis by duration of employment was shown.]"
