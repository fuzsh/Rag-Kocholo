        "text": "The Convener\n\nBefore we begin item 3, I put on the record my thanks to all those people who came to meet us at Lochee community hub in Dundee to talk about their experiences of fuel poverty. Alongside hearing from experts such as the witnesses we have before us today, we also hear from those who have lived experience. We are grateful that so many people took the time to come to meet us on Monday.\n\nToday is the first day of stage 1 of the Fuel Poverty (Target, Definition and Strategy) (Scotland) Bill, and we will be taking evidence on the bill from now until the end of December before reporting to Parliament early in the new year.\n\nI welcome today’s witnesses: Elizabeth Leighton, director of the Existing Homes Alliance Scotland; Craig Salter, a policy officer at Citizens Advice Scotland; Linda Corbett, an energy adviser at East Ayrshire citizens advice bureau; Norman Kerr, director of Energy Action Scotland; and Dion Alexander, the chairman of the Highlands and Islands housing associations affordable warmth group. I thank you all for your submissions. We go straight to questions.\n\nWhat is your view on the main drivers of fuel poverty and the degree to which each driver contributes to overall fuel poverty rates and levels?\n\nNorman Kerr (Energy Action Scotland)\n\nWe have mainly talked about three drivers. We have only really started to consider the fourth driver within the past year or two. The extent to which how energy is used in the home is a contributory factor has not been well measured or defined, although we know that behaviour change can reduce bills by around 10 per cent if people amend how they use appliances or set their heating. It is a contributory factor.\n\nThe measurement of energy efficiency across Scotland has been drawn from the Scottish house condition survey. We have seen energy efficiency levels rise over a period of time.\n\nScottish Government statistics have shown that increasing income has a better outcome than increasing energy efficiency in the shorter term. However, given that fuel prices continue to increase, we need to—pardon the pun—insulate homes against rising costs. The more energy efficient the home, the less energy it will use.\n\nThe Convener\n\nYou are allowed to make one pun per visit.\n\nNorman Kerr\n\nGood. I declare that as my pun.\n\nIt is a complex interaction and, just because we sort one element, that does not mean that the others will fall into line.\n\nCraig Salter (Citizens Advice Scotland)\n\nI second what Norrie Kerr has just said. I will give a bit of insight into the impact of behaviour change. In the past year, we have carried out a lot of research into the support needs of people who are in fuel poverty, particularly the forms of support that people who rely on electric heating require. We know that there are high levels of fuel poverty among people who have electric heating because of high costs.\n\nOne of the things that we see in that research is that how a lot of people use their heating has a big impact on their heating bills. We see a lot of people who have storage heating but do not necessarily know how to use it, and a lot of people who have time-of-use tariffs and dynamically teleswitched tariffs and meters that they do not necessarily understand, so they use their heating at the wrong times. That perhaps tells us that behaviour change is complex and can apply differently in different circumstances. It is definitely an area in which we need to get more evidence, but it has a big impact on certain groups.\n\nElizabeth Leighton (Existing Homes Alliance Scotland)\n\nWe welcome the fact that the strategy is looking at all four drivers of fuel poverty. We particularly welcome the Government’s commitment to removing poor energy performance as a driver of fuel poverty. Doing that is within the powers of the Scottish Government and it is high time that poor energy performance is removed as a reason for fuel poverty. We can do that; there is no technical reason why it is not possible. It is a matter of investment, planning and, as we know, working on behaviour change to maximise the impact of whatever measures are put in place.\n\nAt the same time, we recognise that work has to be done across all the drivers of fuel poverty, which is why we have argued that any progress reports, measurements and targets should reflect the four drivers and should report on outcomes across the board.\n\nThe Convener\n\nBefore I bring anyone else in, I want to mention something that you talked about. The Scottish Government has limited powers in areas such as fuel prices and household income. Is it wise to set a fuel poverty target when we do not have control of all the drivers?\n\nElizabeth Leighton\n\nThe Scottish Government can push the boundaries of its powers, which have grown in the past few years. It has more powers in social security and it is exploring how it can affect energy prices through supporting community energy or a publicly owned energy company. There are areas—even reserved areas—where we can push the boundaries. The Government can set those targets, and ambitious targets drive innovation and investment and provide certainty for the supply chain to invest, which can help to drive down prices in the longer run. We believe that ambitious targets are achievable.\n\nThe one thing that I thought that I had to say today is that we have to be sure that this bill will mean that this is the last generation that will live in fuel poverty. If we cannot walk away from this session confident that that is what we are setting out to achieve with the bill, we will have failed.\n\nLinda Corbett (East Ayrshire Citizens Advice Bureau)\n\nI would like to talk about fuel prices. At Citizens Advice Scotland we very much welcome the cap on the charges for prepayment customers and the safeguard tariff that is being rolled out, particularly for those on the priority services register. However, I think that it falls short of the mark, when it could actually be a very useful tool to help to pull people out of fuel poverty. At the moment, when someone is on the priority services register, it is because of vulnerabilities in relation to health conditions. However, we are doing a disservice to those who are financially vulnerable but who do not necessarily have health conditions by not allowing them to be included in the register which, as I said, opens up access to the safeguard tariff. There is definitely work to be done on our understanding and definition of vulnerability. We should look not only at health and age but at how quickly people can move from one state of vulnerability to another, and at how that can compound their experience of fuel poverty.\n\nNorman Kerr\n\nI want to mention a couple of things. The Scottish Government is now taking more powers over social security and—although it does not control energy price—over the energy company obligation and through that, over the warm home discount scheme. The Scottish Government administers, and could change, that scheme. For example, it might want to lift the level that is applied in a remote and rural area and reduce it in an urban area, so that the same amount of money is spent. There can be a recognition that, in certain parts of Scotland, it is more difficult to heat your home.\n\nThe second thing that I want to mention is not particularly new. The social security powers in the mid-1980s acknowledged the needs that are associated with certain house types. Some members may be familiar with bits of Glasgow and, in particular, with the Barrowfield estate, which was designated as a hard-to-heat estate; everyone on that estate received an uplift per week over the winter season through their social security payments. Therefore, there is a recognition that additional payments can be made using social security powers to mitigate fuel prices in winter.\n\nThe Scottish Government may not have access to all the drivers, but it has access to some that would certainly mitigate fuel costs in particular.\n\nDion Alexander (Highlands and Islands Housing Associations Affordable Warmth Group)\n\nI have one specific response on the wisdom of fuel poverty targets. In our submission, we say that it would be helpful to continue to measure extreme fuel poverty. At the moment, there is basic fuel poverty which, under the old definition, is having to spend 10 per cent of income to keep your home warm, as you know. Extreme fuel poverty is having to spend twice that or more. In our submission, we ask that extreme fuel poverty should continue to be measured, because it will provide a guide to what is going on in the elimination of the worst forms of fuel poverty. We say very firmly that extreme fuel poverty is intolerable in a civilised society and that it should be eradicated as quickly as possible—within five years.\n\nAs for the main target on fuel poverty, we completely take the point that not all the drivers are within the powers of the Scottish Government. Nevertheless, we think that it should be possible to reduce the level to about 5 per cent. You are always going to have people popping in and out of fuel poverty, no matter where you get to, so 5 per cent is not an unreasonable figure for basic fuel poverty.\n\n10:15\n\nTo go back to the main drivers of fuel poverty, I imagine that we will discuss in more detail the question that we have raised in the rural and remote rural context about the level of disposable income and why the definition of fuel poverty needs to reflect that properly through the minimum income standard, which we support. A driver of fuel poverty is the lack of trusted local support in some areas, particularly remote rural areas. It is quite revealing to look at the map that the Scottish Government produced of the home energy efficiency programmes for Scotland area-based schemes—HEEPS ABS—successes and otherwise for 2015-16, for example. That shows some surprising gaps in areas where we would have expected there to have been high activity.\n\nTo say that there is a lack of trusted local support does not mean that the support is not excellent where it exists or that there are not good, helpful national services. However, what works best in solving the problems in remote rural areas is having people available to go into the homes of people who would not otherwise think that they deserved any help at all, such as the old lady who lives in a croft house at the end of a lane somewhere. I hear many such examples in which that availability has made a difference.\n\nThat begs a question about the lack of reliable funding to maintain trusted support. People are looking around for funding in a hand-to-mouth way—there is a lot of that going on. An effective new fuel poverty strategy should look seriously at the public funding commitment to ensure that the proper outreach is provided in areas in which it is most needed.\n\nGraham Simpson (Central Scotland) (Con)\n\nBefore I get to the questions that I wanted to ask, I want to ask Linda Corbett a follow-up question. She mentioned the safeguard tariff. As the convener said, three of us visited Dundee this week. We met a lot of people who prepay their electricity and gas, and we heard about issues relating to that. What is the safeguard tariff?\n\nLinda Corbett\n\nIt is a tariff that is set for credit customers. Prepay is slightly different. With prepay, there is a cap on the maximum amount that can be charged per unit of gas and electricity. The safeguard tariff is essentially the same, but it is for people on a credit meter as opposed to a prepay meter.\n\nGraham Simpson\n\nThat is useful.\n\nI have a couple of linked questions about the bill, so the witnesses can answer them in a linked way. What do you think of the 5 per cent target? Should the target be more ambitious? That target has to be achieved by 2040, which is 22 years away. I think that all of you said in your written evidence that that is not ambitious enough. The two issues are linked. What do you think about the 5 per cent target and the date of 2040?\n\nElizabeth Leighton\n\nIn our evidence, we came out very strongly in favour of a much more ambitious target. As I said earlier, the bill should ensure that the generation that is now living in fuel poverty is the last. We have called for the date to be moved forward to 2032. That aligns with work that is being done in relation to the Climate Change (Emissions Reduction Targets) (Scotland) Bill and the climate change plan. We have also called for the target to be zero per cent—to eradicate fuel poverty as far as is reasonably practicable. We acknowledge that there are people who move in and out of fuel poverty and that we might not be able to get that down to absolute zero. There will be particular times when that is not possible, but we think that that is a reasonable position and that that is an achievable and credible target for us to strive for.\n\nI support what Di Alexander said. Levels of extreme fuel poverty should continue to be measured. We may be able to look for examples from the Child Poverty (Scotland) Act 2017, which talks about “persistent poverty”. The risk is that, if we allow for 5 per cent, those people will be the most difficult, hardest and most expensive to reach, and they will just be left behind. We cannot be in a position where we say that it is okay for that 5 per cent to continue to live in fuel poverty in 2040—surely that is unacceptable.\n\nCraig Salter\n\nI agree with what Elizabeth Leighton just said. We understand the logic of the 5 per cent target. As Dion Alexander said, there is a transient element to fuel poverty. However, if that is the target to be met, there has to be a commitment to an ambition to continue or even step up work to reduce the percentage of households in fuel poverty to zero. If that 5 per cent of households are hard to reach or have a greater support need, more resource has to be put towards supporting them.\n\nWe agree that the 2040 target date is too far in the future. It would mean a reduction of 1 per cent per year, which does not reflect the progress that we have seen in recent years and it is 22 years in the future. We, too, would support a target date of 2032. That would bring the fuel poverty target in line with some of the ambitions that have been set out around energy efficiency, such as improving the energy efficiency of social housing and improving general energy efficiency standards.\n\nAs discussed, there are four drivers of fuel poverty. If we have a target, for all intents and purposes, to remove poor energy efficiency as a driver of fuel poverty by around 2032 and then, eight years later, there is a target to completely eradicate fuel poverty, we risk an undue focus—as there has been in the past, to an extent—on energy efficiency alone, so that the other drivers of fuel poverty are left until later.\n\nAs has been pointed out already, all the drivers of fuel poverty interact. They all have a significant impact and, as a result, they all need to be addressed together. If we are saying that we can achieve improvements in energy efficiency by 2032, work should be on-going alongside that to address the other drivers too. In that regard, 2032 is an achievable target.\n\nNorman Kerr\n\nIn 2016, the level of fuel poverty was at 27 per cent. If you apply the proposed new definition, it comes down to 24 per cent, so there is a 3 per cent drop by changing the definition. If we start with that 24 per cent figure and we aim to meet the 5 per cent target for 2042, a further 19 per cent of people need to be brought out of fuel poverty. If we keep to a 20-year programme that starts in 2020, that is less than a 1 per cent improvement every year.\n\nThat is certainly not ambitious. That target could be achieved through business as usual, if we continue to change how we measure people who are in fuel poverty. The Scottish house condition survey has already changed its methodology three times—in 2011, 2014 and 2016. We continue to change the methodology and each time we have seen fuel poverty figures drop. Our worry is that changes will continue to be made that do not actually mean anything, other than that we are not providing enough support to homes. We could manage down the apparent levels of fuel poverty by continuing to change the definition and manipulating the data we collect.\n\nLinda Corbett\n\nI will reflect on some of the comments from the other panel members. I agree with the 5 per cent target and with the 2032 target, again with a secondary target stretching to 2040. That is because I would like fuel poverty strategies to be embedded and not simply removed once a target is reached—it must be an on-going thing, particularly for rural and outlying areas, where there are small communities that learn from each other. Behaviours are a learned thing and we would like to see fuel poverty strategies enter education. We want to look at how we can support young people to understand energy efficiency and how to behave in an energy efficient way so that, rather than needing to remove them from fuel poverty in the future, we can avoid their getting into fuel poverty in the first place. I welcome the 2040 target, but there should be a bit more ambition. As Craig Salter and Norrie Kerr said, 2032 would probably be more realistic.\n\nNorrie Kerr talked about the 19 per cent figure. By the time that we come to 2020, a reduction of a lot more than 19 per cent will be needed. The 24 per cent fuel poverty figure has been skewed by the massive fluctuations in energy prices, and particularly the drop around the time that the house condition survey was done. Obviously, we have had massive increases since then, particularly in standing charges, so I expect that there will be a bit more work to do than dealing with 19 per cent.\n\nDion Alexander\n\nWe, too, support a programme of 14 years, which matches the one that the Parliament instigated in 2001-02 and which terminated in 2016. We see no good reason for the period to be any longer than that. I have referred to extreme fuel poverty and the good grounds that exist for there being a target on that as well, and for eliminating it pronto.\n\nWith my Highlands and Islands hat on, I make the point that the Scottish house condition survey statistics for local authorities show that, under the existing, or so-called old, definition, 50 per cent—a half—of all households in the Highlands and Islands are in fuel poverty. There has to be a concerted attempt to recognise the places that have the highest levels of fuel poverty and the difficulties that have been faced in eliminating fuel poverty in those areas. In effect, the figures have been flatlining for years in those areas, which suggests that a new and better approach is needed to ensure that the target is reached there.\n\nNorman Kerr\n\nMr Simpson asked about the safeguard tariff. We need to bear it in mind that that is a temporary measure. Our worry about the safeguard tariff and the prepayment tariff caps is that those will in some way amend household behaviour in the wrong direction. In other words, people will think that the Government is protecting them by applying a cap, and they will be less likely to switch supplier, to shop around for a better deal or to change their payment method. The safeguard tariff is a short-term measure and even Ofgem—the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets—admits that it is not sure of the impact on switching rates. If we want people to find better deals and lower prices, we have to recognise that any tariff cap can be only a temporary measure and we must continue to support householders to view their energy bills and consider how to reduce them rather than simply sit back and think that they are protected, when they may be paying far too much.\n\nGraham Simpson\n\nI want to go back to the 2040 target. It is a long way away but, in the policy memorandum, the Government says that achieving it\n\n“will require the use of cost-effective low carbon heating”.\n\nAs you all know, most homes do not have that, so to roll it out nationwide would be a massive project, which I presume is why the Government has picked 2040. Under those circumstances, is that date not reasonable? I can see that Mr Kerr is itching to come in. You have all said that it should be 2032. Either that is plucked out of thin air or it is based on something. Perhaps you can explain where you got the date of 2032 from and why the Government is wrong, given that it will take an awful lot of work to get low-carbon heating in all homes.\n\nThe Convener\n\nBefore the witnesses respond, I ask them to keep their answers a bit shorter, because we have a lot to get through and we have only an hour to get through it.\n\n10:30\n\nNorman Kerr\n\nWe do not necessarily need to put low-carbon heat and fuel poverty together. A low-carbon heat source will not in itself solve fuel poverty. The electricity grid in Scotland is now mainly low carbon. We will have our gas grid for many years to come and we will not replace it, although we are looking at technologies that reduce the amount of carbon in the gas mix, such as biofuels and a range of other mixes, including hydrogen. However, simply giving someone low-carbon heat does not take away the fact that they are fuel poor. It may actually contribute to their fuel poverty if there is a significant additional cost of the technology that is applied to gain that low-carbon heat, such as completely stripping out the gas grid and moving to electricity alone for heating.\n\nWe need to scale up the ambition. We could all say that 2040 sounds absolutely fine, but that would not give a step change in productivity levels or in the number of homes that are tackled each year. In all honesty, it condemns another generation to live in fuel poverty. The 2032 target is based on what we can reasonably expect in a number of parliamentary sessions and with an increase in the budget. I am sorry that my answer is exceptionally longer than you had hoped for, convener, but, if we maintain the budget at its current levels, that is what we will get. Some time ago, Energy Action Scotland talked about a need for £200 million a year. That is a very old figure, but we have never achieved that level of expenditure. We are way behind and we need to raise our game significantly.\n\nThe Convener\n\nWe will move on. Alexander Stewart has a question.\n\nAlexander Stewart (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con)\n\nThere has been lots of discussion of the new definition of fuel poverty, and it has been mentioned this morning. What is your view on the new definition? Is it an improvement? If so, why? If it is not an improvement, why not?\n\nDion Alexander\n\nIt is a bit like a curate’s egg, in that it is good in parts. We welcome the fact that we have a fuel poverty bill, and we are more than happy to have a re-examination of the definition, because the definition logically underpins the work that flows from it to give the evidence base to show what is happening across the board in relation to fuel poverty. It will therefore enable the proper evidence-based development of policies and programmes to address the problems and all but eliminate fuel poverty in a way that previous fuel poverty strategies have failed to do.\n\nWe welcome the fact that the minimum income standard is being used to underpin and inform the evidence-based understanding of poverty and the amount of disposable income that people have. However, for us in the Highlands—many other organisations have made exactly the same point—it falls down badly and radically undermines the whole approach, by not using all the available minimum income standard evidence.\n\nAs you are aware, evidence has been gathered for remote rural Scotland on exactly the same basis as for the minimum income standard UK data. It was first gathered in 2013 and refreshed in 2016. We are saying, “Please, please use this evidence.” The independent panel of academics that came up with the new fuel poverty definition recognised that there was a particular problem in remote rural areas of Scotland and suggested an uplift, in the same way, for example, that we have a London uplift on the MIS UK data when it is used to inform the living wage. We are asking people to do the same thing for remote rural Scotland, because we know from the MIS remote rural Scotland data that, depending on their household type and location, families in remote rural areas need between 10 and 35 per cent more income to achieve the same basic level of income as those in households elsewhere. That has to be a fundamental contributor to fuel poverty; it is not the only contributor, but it must be recognised in any definition if that definition is to have credibility and serve the purpose for which it is designed.\n\nCraig Salter\n\nDi Alexander is absolutely right. We support the new definition, with the proviso that the minimum income standard for remote rural areas must be included. Our research has backed up a lot of what organisations such as Highlands and Islands Enterprise have come out with, which is that, as Di Alexander says, incomes that are 10 to 40 per cent higher are required.\n\nLast year, CAS commissioned qualitative research on the support needs of households that were defined as being fuel poor. One of the interesting things that came out of that was that the groups that self-identified as having a significant need for fuel poverty support corresponded quite closely with the groups that were more likely to be defined as fuel poor under the Scottish Government’s impact assessment, based on the new definition. There was one exception to that, which was households in rural areas. Households in remote rural areas, in particular, said that they needed all sorts of advice and financial support. The fact that that was the one group that did not correspond with what was in the impact assessment suggests that that is the one area where there is a need for fundamental change.\n\nAlexander Stewart\n\nYou believe that if that change is not made to the definition, it will be flawed because it will not include people in remote rural locations.\n\nCraig Salter\n\nI think so, yes.\n\nKenneth Gibson (Cunninghame North) (SNP)\n\nI have so many questions that I will not have time to ask them all. I represent more than 6,000 island constituents and I support the position on the minimum income standard. Does the panel believe that when we look to tackle fuel poverty there should be additional emphasis on island and rural communities to bring them down, if you like, to the average proportion of people that suffer from fuel poverty? Some local authorities might have 10 or 15 per cent fuel poverty, but in Highland and remote authorities it might be 30 or 40 per cent. Should there initially be a specific focus on putting additional resources into those areas to reduce the level of fuel poverty at least to the Scottish average? Would the panel support such a measure?\n\nLinda Corbett\n\nIn East Ayrshire, we are not remote rural, but we certainly have some rural areas, and we see particular difficulties with access to support services. One of the main difficulties for people in rural areas is access to finances in order to travel; another is access to transport to make the journey to reach the support services. Such people often end up living in isolation. They look to neighbours, friends and family for support, but those people tend to be in exactly the same position. We need something in the strategy that identifies that people in those groups potentially need extra support.\n\nKenneth Gibson\n\nElizabeth Leighton and others on the panel said that the Scottish Government needs to be more ambitious, but the Scottish Government does not have much control over income, pensions being an obvious example.\n\nEven if the Scottish Government set up its own energy company and sold fuel at cost, we would still be subject to world prices. How realistic is it to reduce fuel poverty year on year? The previous strategy was not successful, and despite its best efforts the Scottish Government is buffeted by external factors.\n\nThe panel members have all said that the Scottish Government is aiming to reduce fuel poverty by only 1 per cent a year. However, if we reduce the number of people in fuel poverty from 600,000 to 140,000, that will be a 77 per cent reduction. That is more like 4 per cent per year.\n\nElizabeth Leighton\n\nOn the ambition, although I commend the Scottish Government and this Parliament for having such a strong commitment to the eradication of fuel poverty and for having had, over the years, a series of programmes to address the issue, which have mainly addressed energy efficiency, I argue that we should learn from the lessons of the past and consider why fuel poverty has not reduced as much as it should have done.\n\nLet us learn from programme evaluation, which has not been done until fairly recently. Let us look at how forming the types of partnership that the strategy envisages could make programmes more effective, and let us consider greater investment—yes, it comes down to numbers in the budget—not just in delivering measures but in before and after care, in helping people to understand how to manage their energy more effectively, by switching and so on. If we seriously want to eradicate fuel poverty, it will require greater investment.\n\nAs Norrie Kerr said, we have to up our game. It requires a step change. If we are going along with a business-as-usual budget and a business-as-usual strategy, we will have business-as-usual results. The whole point of the bill and the strategy, following the work of the Scottish rural fuel poverty task force and the Scottish fuel poverty strategic working group, is to change our approach, building on what we have been doing and improving.\n\nKenneth Gibson\n\nThe submission from the Existing Homes Alliance was excellent, as are all the submissions. You said:\n\n“We ... note the positive results from research undertaken by the Energy Agency and NHS Ayrshire and Arran”—\n\nthat is my area—\n\n“where preliminary analysis of the health impacts of the area-based solid wall insulation schemes suggests lower hospital admission rates for respiratory and cardiovascular related conditions in these areas compared with a control group of postcodes who had not yet participated in the scheme.”\n\nHave you had discussions with the Scottish ministers about, for example, the possibility of switching national health service resources into fuel poverty reduction? You have proposed a budget increase from £110 million to £234 million a year, which looks quite ambitious on the face of it, but we might save the NHS money by investing in fuel poverty. I know that Norrie Kerr has talked about that over the years. Have you discussed the issue with ministers and had a positive response? Is it being considered?\n\nElizabeth Leighton\n\nIt is certainly something that we have raised, in that we have asked whether we should be looking more globally at the budget. Fuel poverty should not just come under housing; we need to consider more broadly where the other benefits come from and who else should be investing in reducing fuel poverty. It goes beyond health, of course, to economy, because of all the jobs that could be created and sustained if we had an ambitious programme, just on the energy efficiency side of things.\n\nYou are right, in that we are starting to see hard evidence of the health benefits. NHS Ayrshire and Arran has been a leader, working with the Energy Agency, in demonstrating that. We need more of that evaluation to be done, so that we have the evidence and can cost the benefits to the NHS. Previous research has indicated that there could be savings to the NHS of up to £80 million a year—let alone the health and wellbeing benefits to individuals.\n\nThat is why we were so disappointed by the financial memorandum, which fails to look at the cost of reaching the target, whether we are talking about a target to have 5 per cent of households in fuel poverty by 2040 or a target of true eradication. What is the cost, and how will we meet it, through public investment and private investment, and by bringing in other Government policies and portfolios? We are disappointed that the Finance and Constitution Committee is apparently not going to report on the financial memorandum, although that is one of the questions that we think it should look at—not just the amount of the budget, but where it comes from.\n\n10:45\n\nKenneth Gibson\n\nMy final question—I thank the convener for his indulgence—is also for Elizabeth Leighton. I am sorry that I am focusing on one individual, but I want to discuss a point that is made in the Existing Homes Alliance Scotland submission. It says:\n\n“the Scottish Government has stated in the Draft Fuel Poverty Strategy that it will develop ‘...if appropriate, a wider Energy Efficient Scotland Bill for later in this Parliament, and this would be the vehicle for any further legislative changes needed to support Energy Efficient Scotland, beyond the fuel poverty provisions contained in the Fuel Poverty (Target, Definition and Strategy) (Scotland) Bill’.”\n\nDo you feel that the bill represents a missed opportunity and that it should be much more rounded? Other members of the panel may wish to comment on that, too. Instead of our looking to have another bill a year or two from now, should everything be contained in one bill? If possible, would you like additional provisions in the bill that we are discussing?\n\nElizabeth Leighton\n\nThe bill’s genesis was as a warm homes bill. It was about warm, low-carbon, affordable homes for everybody in Scotland, so we were disappointed when a decision was taken to make it focus only on fuel poverty. We welcome the focus, but it is limited. The opportunity has been missed to support it by providing a complementary statutory underpinning for the energy efficient Scotland programme, which is very much needed in order to provide ambition to deliver on the removal of poor energy performance as a driver of fuel poverty.\n\nWe know that there is consideration of a possible energy efficient Scotland bill. Perhaps we will hear more about that on Thursday, when, I believe, the minister will make a statement to Parliament. It will be positive if there is a firm commitment to such a bill and information on what it will contain. Failing that, the bill that we are discussing provides a perfect opportunity to take the matter forward in a timely fashion and in a way that supports achievement of the targets.\n\nAndy Wightman (Lothian) (Green)\n\nOn that point, we have written evidence from the energy poverty research initiative and Common Weal, which says that they are\n\n“disappointed that the Scottish Government has chosen to ignore the consensus at the expert workshop”\n\nin 2017\n\n“that the finalisation of the new definition should be postponed for two to three years to allow the development and inclusion of a robust Scottish definition of vulnerability in the new definition of fuel poverty.”\n\nWe have some conflicting evidence, but we will need to deal with that.\n\nDion Alexander said that the definition should underpin everything that will flow from it. It should be the evidence base for, I presume, the strategy, the implementation and delivery against the target. I have a general question about how we go about measuring fuel poverty. Information comes from the Scottish house condition survey and there is a modelling exercise that, as far as I can see, measures fuel poverty by local authority area. We have a map in the Scottish Parliament information centre briefing that shows that.\n\nDion Alexander has asked for an uplift to the minimum income standard in relation to remote rural Scotland, and he mentions in his submission a better alignment with the urban/rural classification. First, how well can the current measurements of fuel poverty align with the geography of Scotland? Secondly, if the bill is passed as it stands, will it help us to prioritise and to plan where and how we are going to spend money?\n\nDion Alexander\n\nDoes it align with the geography of Scotland? It could do better, particularly in relation to the way that information is gathered according to the Scottish Government’s sixfold urban/rural classification system. In effect, categories 1 and 2 are the cities, categories 3 and 4 are towns and categories 5 and 6 are rural settlements—that is to say, settlements of 3,000 people or fewer. Category 5 settlements are within half an hour’s drive time from a major conurbation and category 6 is remote rural areas that are more than half an hour’s drive time from a major conurbation.\n\nInformation is gathered to an extent on those two rural categories but, often—as has been the case in relation to fuel poverty—it is globalised, as it were, and presented as being to do with rural areas in general rather than with category 5 and category 6. It is aggregated. We are saying that, henceforth, all information should be gathered so that we can see clearly what is happening in category 5 and in category 6—in other words, in accessible rural areas and remote rural areas. It is commonly recognised, not least by the panel of academics who came up with the new definition, that remote rural areas are where the greatest problems are.\n\nMy colleagues have already made the point that we need a much better understanding of outcomes. A lot of assumptions are made on the basis of inputs—that is to say, people assume that energy efficiency inputs will necessarily equate to affordable warmth outcomes. However, that is not the case. Experience shows that, too often, an energy efficiency input does not necessarily mean that the person who is living in the house ends up achieving warmth at a price that they can afford, so they still have a problem.\n\nTo complement the much better understanding of what is going on in remote rural Scotland as well as accessible rural Scotland, we need an improved understanding of the outcomes. I hope that the new fuel poverty strategy will take that question seriously so that we can have a much better understanding of what works and what does not work. One of the major weaknesses of the fuel poverty strategy is that it has not looked nearly closely enough at real outcomes in terms of affordable warmth.\n\nForgive me, but I have forgotten the second part of your question.\n\nAndy Wightman\n\nOthers can answer the second part of my question, too, if they like. If I am a policy maker in the Scottish Government in five years’ time and I want to eradicate fuel poverty on Skye, will I be in a better position to do that after this bill is enacted than I am today?\n\nDion Alexander\n\nYou will not be, unless you really think hard about it from the perspective of the people who need the help and work out what kind of help works best for them. The experience of the Highlands and Islands—I have come across the issue in other places, but that is the place that I know best—shows that what works best is tackling the problem on the front line by having skilled and trusted fuel poverty alleviation people based in the community, such as those in the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association’s energy advice service, so that they can find people and ensure that nobody is missed out.\n\nThey do that by building trust, using word of mouth and by going into someone’s house and looking at all the things that are causing that household to have difficulty, which can involve the fact that the fabric of the property needs improving; that more insulation is needed; that the heating system needs changing; that there is a problem with the electricity tariff, which is a feature of remote rural areas, as they are, essentially, off the gas grid; or that they are not using the system as well as they could be. The fuel poverty alleviation people can provide the handholding support that someone might need, particularly if they are elderly and independent-minded or if they simply do not understand what the system can offer them.\n\nWhere such a service can provide a mix of technical advice and a form of support that is almost like social work—I do not mean that in a demeaning way, but it is a fact that some people need a lot of handholding—that works extremely well. That is the way to get to grips with the problem. That requires resourcing and revenue funding to ensure that that effective outreach takes place.\n\nAndy Wightman\n\nIn effect, you are saying that the bill will not make a difference to that; it is about how we implement things on the ground.\n\nDion Alexander\n\nThat is right. Clearly, there is—\n\nThe Convener\n\nKeep it short, Mr Alexander.\n\nDion Alexander\n\nSorry, convener.\n\nAndy Wightman\n\nThat is fine. Just on—\n\nThe Convener\n\nMr Kerr wants to come in.\n\nNorman Kerr\n\nMr Wightman talked about measurement. The Scottish house condition survey uses BREDEM 2012—Building Research Establishment domestic energy model 2012—which has a number of anomalies. For example, in calculating fuel costs, it uses a Scottish average for oil, although oil prices in remote and rural areas are very different from inner-city oil prices. I suggest that, if we are going to use the house condition survey as our main touchstone, we must amend BREDEM to take into account a number of issues.\n\nAnother issue is that, as Mr Wightman rightly said, the survey results are by local authority area, which is difficult in a huge area such as the Highlands. However, using proxies—we will always use proxies—we can apply additional work that will get good figures down to ward level in certain areas.\n\nThe bill itself will not make it easier to target resources to fuel-poor households. When the minister talked about introducing the bill, he was looking for a doorstep tool, so that someone on the doorstep of a household could make an assessment of its fuel poverty. Given the complexity of the definition, that doorstep tool is nigh on impossible. It would have to take into account a person’s income and fuel costs and then work out the MIS. Therefore, a doorstep tool for an individual house is a non-starter, but we can amend BREDEM and we can do additional work that will move the information down to ward level, which would be more useful for local authorities.\n\nAndy Wightman\n\nI would be grateful if Mr Kerr could write to the committee with further thoughts on what that work would involve. That would be useful.\n\nNorman Kerr\n\nCertainly, I will do that.\n\nCraig Salter\n\nI agree with that point, but there is also something to be said around how the definition is used in budgeting. Obviously, if we have a more accurate definition, that could play a role in aligning fuel poverty budgets. How do we do that more effectively with the new definition compared to the old one? There is nothing in the bill that would make that easier. One solution could be a more in-depth requirement, either for a third party or for ministers, to report on the impact of each individual driver of fuel poverty, as well as the impact of measures to address those drivers individually, so that we can understand where the money needs to be spent. If we see that energy prices are holding back progress, we will know that money needs to go to innovation on that. That is a more general point, but a more accurate and detailed definition can play a role in budgeting.\n\nAndy Wightman\n\nWe will come back to reporting and accountability, so I will leave it there.\n\nThe Convener\n\nLiam McArthur has a couple of questions on that.\n\nLiam McArthur (Orkney Islands) (LD)\n\nAs someone with the dubious honour of representing the part of the country with the highest levels of fuel poverty—Orkney—that is of particular interest. I congratulate the panel on the distinction of gathering such compelling evidence that the Government saw fit to issue its retaliation first, with an explanatory note. Even in that note, the Government appears to accept that the combined impact of the new definition and targets will be a greater reduction in the fuel poverty rate in urban areas when compared to rural areas.\n\nThe committee has heard concerns from everyone about the absence of the rural MIS, which goes against the advice of the rural fuel poverty task force and the independent expert panel, and against the wishes of pretty much every organisation that is involved in housing and fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands. From the note, that decision appears to be based on the potential costs of including a rural MIS and the delays in implementing the system. What is the panel’s response to those two concerns, which the Government appears to be using to justify its position on the issue?\n\n11:00\n\nDion Alexander\n\nThe figure that is quoted in the paper is a cost of £0.5 million over four years. From my conversations with Professor Donald Hirsch of Loughborough University, who is the key person responsible for gathering minimum income standard data and who led the work on the MIS for remote rural Scotland, I think that he is surprised that it would need to cost that much, but I respectfully suggest that the only way in which the committee can bottom that out is to invite Professor Hirsch to give evidence and discuss the matter.\n\nThat raises the question as to whether it would be money well spent. Our view is that it would.\n\nNorman Kerr\n\nOn the figure of £0.5 million over four years, if we amend BREDEM—there is a reference to the need to amend BREDEM—that will not be free, but that has not been costed. I think that the figure has been given to demonstrate why we should not apply a remote rural uplift, rather than why we should. In the great scheme of things, £0.5 million over four years is a drop in the ocean to get more accurate reporting that will enable us to dedicate resources to a particular area. I am sorry, but I think that the figure is a smokescreen.\n\nLiam McArthur\n\nIn his written submission to the committee, Professor Hirsch said:\n\n“Were this matter of a remote rural variation to be reconsidered in the course of the Bill, I can confirm that ongoing measurement of such a variation would be feasible with a modest amount of ongoing research to keep it up to date.”\n\nHe does not quantify that, but what he says suggests the order of magnitude that we are talking about.\n\nMr Salter talked about budgeting. Do you agree that, if we do not get the criteria right, we will not direct resources in the most efficient way?\n\nCraig Salter\n\nI absolutely agree. I cannot comment on the figure that the Scottish Government has put on that but, as Norrie Kerr and I both said, if we start from the wrong point, we will not be able to budget effectively and we will not get the outcomes that the bill tries to achieve.\n\nI absolutely agree that it would be money well spent, if it ultimately meant that fuel poverty support got to the people who are in greatest need, in particular those who have, historically, found it harder to access support.\n\nLiam McArthur\n\nWe have touched on the cost, but what about the delay? Do you envisage a delay, given what you have said about the need to crack on and have more ambitious targets?\n\nCraig Salter\n\nI have not seen any great detail from the Scottish Government about exactly what the delay would be and what would cause it. As far as I am aware, and as Di Alexander said, a lot of the work has already been done. There is Professor Hirsch’s work, and Highlands and Islands Enterprise has done extensive research on the matter.\n\nSuch exceptions or uplifts are already applied in other parts of the country, such as London. It appears to me that the problem should not be insurmountable. As Norrie Kerr rightly pointed out, in the Scottish house condition survey, methodologies are revised and applied retroactively so, even if there were a short delay, there is no reason why a remote rural uplift should not then be applied once the information is ready. A delay is not a reason not to do it.\n\nAlex Rowley\n\nWhat are the panel’s views on the principle of having a fuel poverty strategy and the timetable for producing it, given that it will probably come out in 2019, after the bill has been passed? What do you think of the draft fuel poverty strategy that was published alongside the bill?\n\nThe Convener\n\nPlease make your answers as brief as possible.\n\nNorman Kerr\n\nI will make a start. The strategy needs to be in place—the question is whether lessons have been learned from the previous schemes that will impact on it. The strategy is more focused on removing poor energy efficiency as the main driver, and we would like to see a lot more built into it for support services such as Citizens Advice Scotland that are doing the handholding. It is important that we have a strategy, but I do not think that it is wide enough. It is very narrowly focused.\n\nDion Alexander\n\nIn our submission, we spell out what we would like to see included in the preparation of the fuel poverty strategy. A lot of work has already been done on this by both the strategic working group, for which Elizabeth Leighton provided the secretariat, and the rural fuel poverty task force, which the Scottish Government convened and which I chaired. There is a lot of information available.\n\nThat said, a useful way of ensuring that the strategy delivers for remote rural Scotland is to island proof it, as per the requirements of the Islands (Scotland) Act 2018, which is all but in place now—I think that it has a few small stages still to go through. As I understand it, the minister, Kevin Stewart, has indicated that he is happy for the bill and the strategy to be island proofed as soon as possible, and I urge the committee to support that view, because that would be useful in making sure that the bill and the strategy do what they are required to do in practice.\n\nElizabeth Leighton\n\nI have a couple of points. First, on the consultation requirements, we welcome the specific reference to getting the views of\n\n“those with lived experience of fuel poverty”.\n\nWe think that that is positive, but their views should be gathered in order to report on progress, too. The consultation should be more co-designed instead of being a passive request for some input, with feedback wrapped in. Indeed, we have made extensive comments on that aspect.\n\nSecondly, with regard to the content—and this goes back to my previous comments about business as usual—does the strategy contain specific policies or programmes that are different from those that we have now? We should build on what we have now, which has been successful, but if we are to make the step change towards accelerated progress, the strategy should contain new programmes and policies that use certain levers such as regulation or incentives or look at how explicit links are being made with other strategies such as the child poverty strategy or public health strategies. Those things should be evidenced in the fuel poverty strategy, so that we know that this will be mainstreamed across all of Scotland and not follow the current pepper-pot approach, which means that, if you are lucky, you might have funding for a year-long project to provide the kinds of services—the handholding and so on—that others have talked about. If you are not lucky, you do not have anything. We would like to see the strategy developed so that it moves on from where we are today.\n\nLinda Corbett\n\nOn the consultation requirements and the reference to the “lived experience”, we would very much like front-line workers to be consulted, too, as it might give a good indication of the trigger points for when consumers approach a trusted intermediary, which includes organisations such as Energy Action Scotland, Home Energy Scotland, the Energy Saving Trust and, obviously, Citizens Advice Scotland. There is already a vast wealth of knowledge, and I am quite sure that many front-line workers in those organisations will be more than happy to pipe up and talk about their experience, too.\n\nCraig Salter\n\nI agree. There is also a lot of scope and a lot of options for setting out in more detail how the\n\n“lived experience of fuel poverty”\n\nis measured. As Linda Corbett has said, it is very important to speak to front-line workers, and quite a lot of work has already been done through the Scottish household survey. That could be expanded on to get more fuel poverty data.\n\nThe strategy sets out a commitment to addressing all four drivers of fuel poverty but, as I have said before, we need a lot more detail on how that will be done. We have talked a lot today about some of the limitations on Scottish Government powers; because of that, the strategy needs a lot more detail on what it will do to bring down energy prices and increase incomes.\n\nWe also had some thoughts on the vulnerability criteria. The academic review panel recommended that there should be on-going work to define vulnerability and produce a set of criteria that would include things such as health and disability as indicators of vulnerability. There would be benefit in the strategy if there was a clear commitment to establishing something like a permanent panel of public health experts to review the criteria on an on-going basis. Vulnerability is a complex issue that changes a lot over time for society and individuals, and its definition should be reviewed regularly.\n\nOn the vulnerability criteria, the strategy assumes 75 as the age at which people require an enhanced heating regime, but that is potentially too high. Vulnerability is not just a health issue. After retirement age, people become more financially vulnerable and spend more time at home, and the same goes for people with children under five. At least until the first stage of work is undertaken to set out the vulnerability criteria, it would be beneficial to include households with children under five and to bring the assumed age for requiring an enhanced heating regime in line with the pension age.\n\nAndy Wightman\n\nElizabeth Leighton correctly identified that the financial memorandum merely reflects the costs of implementing the bill—for example, the costs of printing a strategy, the time that it takes to write it and so on. You have highlighted other bills such as the Climate Change (Emissions Reduction Targets) (Scotland) Bill that contain more detailed costs for achieving the targets. It would be unreasonable to expect that we can assess the full costs of achieving the target, but what can reasonably be done to assess the broad costs of eradicating fuel poverty either though the bill as it stands or in any amended target that we might have?\n\nElizabeth Leighton\n\nIn our evidence, we suggested that some projections could be made about the costs and gave some examples of research on energy efficiency that has been carried out over the past few years by Consumer Focus—which is now Consumer Futures. Its estimate of the cost of alleviating fuel poverty is an example of how such projections can be made in order to indicate what it would cost to achieve, for example, the energy efficient Scotland accelerated targets for fuel-poor homes.\n\nThose figures indicated that at least double the current annual budget for energy efficiency and fuel poverty programmes has to be made available. I stress that phrase “at least”, because the research looked at only one driver and is a little bit dated. If public health officials were spoken to and front-line workers consulted, it would be possible to project how we could address the other drivers, too. I would not say, therefore, that it would be unreasonable to do a projection—an estimate—of the costs as has been done for the climate change plan and the climate change bill. Importantly, the wider benefits of action on climate change were also looked at, and the same could be done for fuel poverty.\n\nThe arguments have been well rehearsed about the benefits for health, wellbeing, jobs, the economy and improved energy security as well as, of course, the energy savings, which go into people’s pockets and get spent in the local economy. Again, there has been research in all those areas, and it could be documented to evidence why investment in this area is well worth our while. You could look again at other Government budgets that could contribute to this effort.\n\n11:15\n\nDion Alexander\n\nSome time ago now, the Highlands and Islands housing associations affordable warmth group drew up a proposal for what we called an “energy carer” based model of delivery, which I have described in my previous answers. Although the Scottish Government never formally responded, the proposal was picked up and advocated for by the Scottish Government’s rural fuel poverty task force, so there is work out there that goes into detail on what it would cost to deliver the kind of personalised outreach service that would be required to tackle the problems in the Highlands and Islands.\n\nAndy Wightman\n\nAnother matter that we have skipped over is monitoring. The Climate Change Act 2008 established the Committee on Climate Change, which produces reports and is an independent, statutory adviser to Government. Section 6 of this bill says that periodic reports are to be prepared by Scottish ministers and laid before Parliament. I think that, in your evidence, you have all said something about the need for enhanced reporting and scrutiny to help future parliamentarians and policy makers assess whether we are on track; Craig Salter, for example, has talked about reporting on each of the individual drivers. I know that we have your written evidence, but it would be useful to hear any brief comments that you might have about how important you think that might be.\n\nDion Alexander\n\nMonitoring is very important, and it is also very important that the major reviews are done sooner rather than later; there could be one five years from now, or if you started counting from 2019, there would be major reports in 2024 and 2029. I reiterate that annual interim reports are required in order to keep proper tabs on what is really happening and try to avoid repeating the problem with the previous fuel poverty strategy, when we were always looking back to find that things were not really improving very much and it appeared as though not enough effective action was being taken to alter the direction of travel.\n\nCraig Salter\n\nIt would be beneficial if a third-party organisation had the statutory role of monitoring and producing frequent reports on the progress that was being made on each of the four drivers of fuel poverty. I say “each of the four drivers”, but I mean each of the recognised drivers, as they could change over time. That would give a more robust level of scrutiny, similar to that of the Committee on Climate Change.\n\nThere would also be a benefit from ministers being required to respond to the reports in Parliament and on each of the drivers of fuel poverty. It is important and beneficial to have a statutory requirement at least to measure and look at each driver to ensure that we do not focus only on one aspect of fuel poverty. Even if it ends up that not every driver can be tackled to the same extent, we need to understand why that is and where the sticking points are.\n\nNorman Kerr\n\nVery briefly, the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995, which came into force in 1996, requires local authorities to report every two years on progress towards their statutory targets. That was to allow scrutiny of progress and, if needed, to allow the target to be amended and guidance to be given on change. A review every five years seems far too long to allow for significant change or for guidance to be given. If we do it every five years, and then take a year to publish, that will run into six years, so the information will already be five years behind. The house condition survey used to be carried out every five years, but now it models every year and becomes statistically valid every three years, although the figures are put out every year. There is a precedent for gathering that information and reporting to Parliament.\n\nElizabeth Leighton\n\nWe have argued that the fuel poverty advisory panel should be established on a statutory basis so that it is independent, goes beyond one Administration, can respond to reports and can provide advice to Parliament. Annual reporting, which would involve shorter reports than five-yearly ones, provides an opportunity to consider whether any corrective action should be taken if progress is not sufficient and whether the approach is adequately resourced. This is not just about the strategy and having nice ideas and plans; it is about considering whether that strategy is adequately resourced to deliver what it says it is going to do. That is what is being done with the child poverty and climate change legislation.\n\nGraham Simpson\n\nI want to go back to the strategy, which is set out in part 3 of the bill. In considering the Planning (Scotland) Bill, the committee agreed to an amendment on enhanced parliamentary scrutiny of the national planning framework. Should that also apply to the fuel poverty strategy? In other words, should the Parliament have a greater role in the strategy so that it is not just left to ministers to publish it, show us it and then move on?\n\nDion Alexander\n\nTo give the briefest of answers, I say yes.\n\nThe Convener\n\nI see that there is unanimity. I wish that all the questions had been like that.\n\nAndy Wightman\n\nI have a small final question. The bits at the end of bills, which might seem to be boring, are often the most interesting. Section 13 is on commencement, while section 14 tells us what the act will be called once it is enacted. Section 13 says:\n\n“This section”—\n\nthat is, the commencement section—\n\n“and section 14 come into force on the day after Royal Assent.”\n\nIn other words, when the Queen signs the bill and it becomes an act, all that we will have is a name and the fact that that name comes into force on that day—and nothing else. We will have to wait for ministers to commence everything else in what will then be an act, including section 3, which some of you have talked about the need to commence. Should we strengthen the commencement provisions so that we have a timetable for doing that rather than just leave it to ministers?\n\nI see that no one has a view. It does not matter.\n\nThe Convener\n\nI see that Dion Alexander has a view. You spoiled it, Mr Alexander—it was going so well. [Laughter.]\n\nDion Alexander\n\nI could not agree more that a timetable is needed. Indeed, the same point was made in many of the responses to the fuel poverty consultation document earlier in the year rather than the submissions to the committee. We need milestones and a much clearer way of understanding what is planned, and we need that sooner rather than later.\n\nAndy Wightman\n\nTo be fair, the bill contains the milestones, but the trigger point or the point when the clock starts ticking for virtually the whole bill is in the gift of ministers. Should we set some of those dates in the bill? Perhaps it should say, for example, that some provisions shall be triggered a year after royal assent.\n\nElizabeth Leighton\n\nYou have taken the words out of my mouth. We have suggested 12 months from the date of royal assent, which we think would be reasonable, given that we already have a draft strategy. A 12-month timetable would ensure that the bill did not languish. I do not think that the Scottish Government intends that to happen, but such a timetable would give assurance that the momentum will be maintained.\n\nThe Convener\n\nGraham Simpson wants to come in with a final point.\n\nGraham Simpson\n\nIt is actually a final question. The bill is an incredibly flimsy document. If we did not have it, would anyone lose out?\n\nNorman Kerr\n\nThe simple answer to that is yes, because we would have nothing that said what we want to do. We would have an energy efficiency programme that trundled on to no end, and we would simply continue to provide people with some help without knowing how effective it was. The bill will help to bring that into focus. We on this side of the table all disagree with the 2040 date, but the bill lays out what we intend to achieve. If we do not have that, there will be no focus for future work or programmes.\n\nThe Convener\n\nDoes anyone have any final comments?\n\nLinda Corbett\n\nI have prepared two case studies of people in fuel poverty, which I will leave with the committee. The first involves a person with whom we worked closely to bring them out of fuel poverty—she was in a local authority property and had plenty of options—while the second is about a lady who has worked very hard to be energy efficient. Although she engaged with two separate programmes—warmer homes Scotland for external wall insulation and, historically, the green deal, although I know that that is reserved to Westminster—she is now, despite that work, in fuel poverty. I have no strategies left to pull her out of it other than give it time and hope for a change of circumstances. The point of including that relates to the 5 per cent target, and the fact that there are some people who just cannot move out of fuel poverty. I will leave those case studies with the committee for members’ perusal.\n\nThe Convener\n\nI appreciate that very much—that is very kind of you.\n\nElizabeth Leighton\n\nOn the question whether the bill will make any difference, we certainly welcome it, although we have said that it needs a lot more in it and that it is only half a bill. We have given a starter list of amendments that can be made or areas where the bill can be supplemented so that we can put in place the relevant powers and commitments to allow us to move on from where we are. That would remove barriers and create opportunities to be more ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty across all the drivers. The list is not complete, but it gives examples of where the bill could make a difference if it were amended.\n\nThe Convener\n\nOn that note, I thank our witnesses for their time and their useful answers. I suspend the meeting briefly to allow the witnesses to leave.\n\n11:27 Meeting suspended.\n\n11:31 On resuming—\n\nThe Convener (James Dornan)\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the 34th meeting in 2018 of the Local Government and Communities Committee. I remind everyone present to turn off their mobile phones. As meeting papers are provided in digital format, members may use their tablets during the meeting.\n\nAgenda item 1 is evidence taking on the Fuel Poverty (Target, Definition and Strategy) (Scotland) Bill at stage 1. This is our third day of evidence on the bill, and we will hear from two panels of witnesses. We will have one further evidence session on the bill before the end of December, which will be with the Minister for Local Government, Housing and Planning, and we will report to Parliament on the bill early in the new year.\n\nI welcome to the meeting our first panel: Dr Keith Baker, who is a co-founder of the energy poverty research initiative, and Professor Donald Hirsch, who is director of the centre for research in social policy at Loughborough University. I thank you for your submissions. We will go straight to questions from members, starting with Graham Simpson.\n\nGraham Simpson (Central Scotland) (Con)\n\nI have some questions for Dr Baker, but if Professor Hirsch wants to jump in, he should feel free to do so.\n\nDr Baker, what do you mean by a “folk-first approach” to tackling fuel poverty? What is wrong with the Government’s current approach?\n\nDr Keith Baker (Glasgow Caledonian University)\n\nI blame my colleague Dr Ron Mould for coming up with that phrase, but it is just a nice, catchy way of saying that until now—and under the current proposals and measures—fuel poverty policies have been driven largely by technical solutions. That includes the use of energy performance certificates, which we argue are, as currently produced, flawed as drivers of tackling fuel poverty. We fundamentally do not believe that the proposals as they stand, with EPCs as a driver, will have anywhere near the desired effect.\n\nIn our work, we are reconceptualising fuel poverty to show how the current Scottish definition—that is, the Boardman-based definition—can be reconciled with a wider conceptualisation of vulnerability. That approach was supported by the expert panel workshop on 1 August last year. We feel—we say this as building scientists—that the whole problem should be turned on its head, with human factors such as vulnerability being seen as drivers of fuel poverty and tackled primarily. That might well lead us to recommend technical solutions, but we are suggesting that a much more holistic approach to the way in which we deal with householders be considered.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nGraham Simpson\n\nI think that it kind of does. It actually leads to my second question, which is about the reference to—in fact, almost a criticism of—the fabric-first approach in your submission. I must admit that I did not quite follow your argument, but I will come on to why that was, if you can respond to my first point and explain what you mean by that phrase.\n\nDr Baker\n\nAt the moment, we use a very limited number of measures—predominantly income and technical performance—to decide what we need to put into houses when we go and see householders. What we are saying and showing is that, although there are groups of householders in fuel poverty for whom the building is the main problem and who can therefore be treated in that way, we have found that, in most cases—particularly in rural and island areas, which I am sure we will come on to—the real drivers are actually human factors such as the vulnerability of householders and their ability to understand the information and to manage their future energy circumstances. It is behavioural and contextual stuff.\n\nWe can treat houses—as a building scientist, I have been doing that for decades. I can go into a household and say what technical measures need to be introduced, but the occupants need to be engaged and have to understand what needs to be done. We also need the technical measures to be correct, and I argue that EPCs themselves are not a driver in that respect. In a policy paper that I am bringing out with Common Weal on 18 December, I propose an alternative approach to the development of EPCs, but that is probably a bit tangential to what the committee is considering at the moment.\n\nGraham Simpson\n\nIt is not, really. The committee has looked at the issue before, and I would certainly be interested in seeing that paper.\n\nDr Baker\n\nThe key driver in it is the modelled data that we use. This relates to the fuel poverty problem and the energy efficiency problem. At the moment, almost all policy making relies on using modelled data from, for example, the home energy efficiency database, which we argue is incredibly poor and is probably detrimental to solving the fuel poverty problem. We have accessed and used real and accurate household data—technical, household composition and household characteristics data—from local authorities, housing associations and other such trusted intermediaries that have the authority to process that data, to show that the rural energy spend and the urban-rural energy spend gap is significantly greater. When we normalise all the other variables and underlying factors, it is clear that it is the human, social, behavioural and environmental problems that are driving that big gap rather than the technical issues.\n\nGraham Simpson\n\nWhat if we treat someone’s house and make it as energy efficient as possible? Let us say that the ultimate goal is the passive house standard. Surely if something is built to that standard, we could almost eliminate fuel poverty. Would you disagree with that?\n\nDr Baker\n\nIt depends on what we measure and how we measure it. At the moment, if we improve a dwelling, the improvements will be directed by what comes out of an energy performance certificate, or a standard assessment procedure. There are huge volumes of evidence going back several decades that show that the accuracy of EPCs for selecting and driving those improvements is not good—they are hugely inaccurate. There are studies that say that SAP and EPCs are unfit for that purpose.\n\nIt is great to install technical measures, but it is important to ensure that they are installed on a proper technical basis, which we are currently not doing. Another issue is that among vulnerable lower-income householders, those measures will not deliver the savings that we expect, because we do not have the correct baseline for those householders. We are not dealing with things such as self-limiters, or people who switch their heating off. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets has admitted that it does not have that data, so we do not know what numbers are out there.\n\nGraham Simpson\n\nLet me put it in layman’s terms. If we make a house as energy efficient as possible and it is really well insulated and airtight, there is no need to put the heating on. If we build a new house to the passive house standard, we do not actually need radiators, so that would slash fuel bills. If we slash fuel bills, we cut fuel poverty.\n\nDr Baker\n\nAs a building scientist, I would not say that the passive house standard is the only route to go down. The passive house standard has its uses in Scotland—in certain areas and certain places—but there is also the natural design approach. That is the school of building science that I am from, and that approach is maybe more appropriate in Scotland. That is a matter for building standards, and building standards have improved.\n\nHowever, we are not necessarily going to take that approach because of the other factors that are involved. That is our view, as building scientists, having looked at the evidence. We do not want to stand around and say, “Please don’t give money to our field and don’t support what we do,” but we are saying that the interventions that have been done are largely not as successful, particularly among poorer and more vulnerable householders, as the modelled data would suggest. When we go and look at those households in real life and get measured data, we do not get the savings that we would expect. That is partly due to things such as the rebound effect and the prebound effect in relation to how householders use energy.\n\nIf a nice middle-class household gets insulation installed, it will get close to the expected savings. However, once we go beyond that standard household archetype, the uncertainty and variation become highly significant, so we cannot make assumptions about savings.\n\nThe other point to mention is on the way in which householders change behaviour before and after intervention. We make the assumption that, just because we put energy efficiency measures into a household, people will necessarily start to behave in ways that make the household more resilient to fuel poverty. However, that is based on an assumption rather than any evidence.\n\nGraham Simpson\n\nYou are using a lot of jargon.\n\nDr Baker\n\nSorry.\n\nGraham Simpson\n\nI am not very clear whether you are in favour of taking energy efficiency measures or not. Not one member of the committee would deny that people have to be educated on how to use systems in their homes, but do you not agree that we have to make the home as energy efficient as we possibly can?\n\nDr Baker\n\nYes—we have to make the home efficient and educate people. We are in favour of energy efficiency measures, but we do not believe, and our analysis supports this view, that the energy efficiency proposals under the bill—using EPCs as a driver and bringing all households up to band C or D—will have the projected and desired effect on reducing fuel poverty levels because of the uncertainty about how those measures are likely to affect household energy consumption and spend, particularly by poorer and more vulnerable householders and those in the Highlands and Islands.\n\nIt is a simple case of the data becoming a lot more uncertain. A nice middle-class household living in the centre of Edinburgh that starts to insulate can probably achieve the savings and benefits that the models suggest. However, once we get away from a standard household—an archetype—the inaccuracy becomes significant.\n\nThe approach will work, and we can and should be driving energy efficiency in households in which it will have those effects. However, for the majority of fuel-poor householders, it is clear that the real problems are their incomes and their ability to manage their lifestyles and understand their energy bills.\n\nWe have a paper coming out next year about a study in Renfrewshire, which shows that more than two thirds of more than 7,000 interventions that were carried out by the local authority and the housing association largely involved showing poor and vulnerable householders how to use their central heating systems.\n\nIt is great that we are making technical improvements—assuming that we are getting them right; that is another question—but we have shown that we will get much more benefit for those who are most in need by tackling the whole house. That is also supported by the work of Christine Liddell, who was on the review panel.\n\nHouseholds might need insulation, as well, but what they really need is somebody to show them how to use their boiler and other simple energy-saving measures. Perhaps we can give them an energy meter and say that they should try using the kettle to boil just one cup of water or whatever for a couple of weeks and appreciate how much that saves on their energy bills.\n\nIf those householders are told that they can save £10 on their energy bill this week or £100 in the future, they will take the £10 now—we know that from basic human psychology. It is about building in that resilience. Technical solutions will certainly reduce energy use and put that buffer zone in, but they will not necessarily develop that resilience in households. That human approach is needed.\n\nKenneth Gibson (Cunninghame North) (SNP)\n\nYou mentioned the rebound effect. You are suggesting that, when a poor household has their house insulated, they may feel that they can put the heating on, whereas they maybe did not put it on quite as much previously. Is that what you mean?\n\nDr Baker\n\nYes. The rebound effect will occur in other ways, as well. The classic middle-class example is the person who saves money on their energy bills and then takes an extra flight. However, we do not know what a poor or vulnerable householder will do. We could be dealing with someone who has not had their heating on significantly for years. Will they choose to adopt a very high heating-energy regime? They could be up to their eyes in debt. A classic example of what we deal with is somebody who is so far in debt that, when they get heating improvements, they decide to have their house at 26°C because that feels comfortable, and they will service the debt whenever.\n\nKenneth Gibson\n\nI do not know many people who would want their house at 26°C. We have taken a lot of evidence that says that, if a house is much warmer, it reduces respiratory and other illnesses, for example. If people feel able to keep their house warmer, even if the energy consumption does not decline, it is much more efficiently and effectively used, and the person is warmer and feels healthier. Surely that is a benefit in itself.\n\nI understand what you are saying about behavioural changes, but we have very mobile households now, particularly in the private rented sector. If houses are insulated, bills will still be lower. People have to move around. If someone moves into a house, does that mean that someone should go in and explain all the implications that you explain to people?\n\nDr Baker\n\nYes.\n\nKenneth Gibson\n\nSurely technical measures are core to that.\n\nDr Baker\n\nThey are, but you have to recognise that there are different types of technical measures. Boiler replacement is among the most common, and that will need somebody to go in for some of the householders whom we are talking about. Organisations such as Govanhill Housing Association will do that. Govanhill Housing Association works with the charity South Seeds. It covers a lot of people from the Romanian community. It will go in, set people up, and show them how to use their heating systems from the start. A lot of housing associations will do that. However, as you have said, that will largely not capture the private rented sector. It will capture housing associations, but we know that the energy performance of housing association properties is generally higher than that of the rest of the housing stock anyway. It will not capture owner-occupiers unless they seek that help.\n\nI am just trying to remember where you were going with the other part of the question.\n\n10:00\n\nKenneth Gibson\n\nLet us move on to something else. You say that the new targets represent a significant step backwards. You say that the Scottish Government’s ambition of reducing the number of households in fuel poverty from 600,000 to 140,000 by 2040 is a backward step. Why is it a backward step?\n\nI would also like to hear from Professor Hirsch, because he has been very quiet so far.\n\nDr Baker\n\nThe original target was to eliminate fuel poverty as far as practicable by November 2016. We would accept that, within that, probably 3 per cent of households that were captured by that definition were fuel poor, based on the problem with the definition. The large, rich household can be classed as fuel poor because it has a large area to heat and a relatively low income; the little old lady in the castle in the Highlands would be a very stereotypical example.\n\nWe have gone from the question of eliminating fuel poverty under the current definition by 2016 to a question of using energy efficiency as the main driver for reducing fuel poverty significantly by 2032. If you are adding 16 or more years to where we were, that is effectively a reset.\n\nKenneth Gibson\n\nWhen the Lib-Lab Executive set the target, I do not think that it realised that fuel prices were going to go up by 155 per cent while incomes would go up by 38 per cent over the piece. Clearly, that has had a serious impact.\n\nThe committee has often discussed how we do not have control of energy prices or, indeed, income levers. Given that, do you not think that it is pretty ambitious of the Scottish Government, working under those constraints, to still be determined to reduce the number of people who are in fuel poverty?\n\nDr Baker\n\nGiven the timescale for the implementation of the proposals—2032 to 2040—there is absolutely no guarantee that that will not happen again, or happen again more than once.\n\nKenneth Gibson\n\nWe do not think that there is such a guarantee. However, there is a determination and all political parties are committed to it, but external shocks can sometimes derail things. We cannot insulate the country from such things, certainly not with the devolved powers that we have.\n\nDr Baker\n\nNo, but the latest Scottish house condition survey’s initial key findings from 2017 show that there has already been a substantial rise. The increase in fuel poverty is being seen largely among households using electricity, households using liquefied petroleum gas, and households using oil. We have therefore seen a statistically significant increase during the past year.\n\nObviously, we have not had a big oil spike or a big gas spike, but that sort of thing could be on the cards because it has happened before.\n\nProfessor Donald Hirsch (Loughborough University)\n\nI have not looked in the round at whether the target is more or less ambitious. Having looked at some of the committee’s deliberations and what witnesses have been saying, I would say that a key issue is whether you accept that a significant level of fuel poverty will remain over the long term and whether that creates a disincentive to deal with certain aspects of the problem.\n\nA lot of the debate has been about the remote rural issue. On a purely numbers-based or target-based perspective, the risk is that there is no incentive to make progress in sparsely populated areas where interventions do not have the same economies of scale as they would have if you were refitting an urban terrace—\n\nKenneth Gibson\n\nMay I just interrupt you there?\n\nProfessor Hirsch\n\nThat would be the particular thing that you would want to be careful about.\n\nKenneth Gibson\n\nI am sure that we will go on to talk about that. I wanted to hear your opinion on the matters that we have discussed so far.\n\nThe committee is going to Stornoway tomorrow. I am sure that all committee members are keen to ensure that rural areas are not left out, that it is not just a numbers game and that every community in Scotland has the opportunity to address fuel poverty. We will impress that upon the Scottish Government. We have to discuss the mechanisms of that, but we are taking evidence on the issue tomorrow and Friday.\n\nProfessor Hirsch\n\nI accept that.\n\nKenneth Gibson\n\nWhat is your response to the issues that we have discussed so far?\n\nProfessor Hirsch\n\nThe earlier question was a technical one that is not within my area of expertise.\n\nAnnabelle Ewing (Cowdenbeath) (SNP)\n\nGood morning, gentlemen. I will pick up on some of Dr Baker's comments, because I remain a bit confused. If you do not think that the Scottish Government should proceed with, in your words, a fabric-first approach, where would you rank the need to tackle fabric issues? From my perspective as the MSP for the Cowdenbeath constituency, everything else is theoretical for constituents who live in damp houses; they want that problem solved first and foremost as they do not want to live in damp houses. I am not clear about what you are saying or how it would help my constituents in the short term.\n\nDr Baker\n\nThere are two issues here: the practical issue of how to identify and tackle matters in the field, and the issue of the data that we use. We recommend improvements based on modelled data, but I should warn you that anyone who says that modelled data is good probably has a vested interest in producing it. We can direct improvements, as the academic panel recommended, by making more and better use of real data that is available. That in itself would drive better technical solutions. We certainly see technical solutions as part of the process, but we have to get data on householders and use the time to get better technical data as well, so that we can assess what improvements are most suitable for the individual.\n\nI have just done a bit of work on householders who are in fuel poverty and who have dementia, for example. Someone might not want to put in their gold standard measures for that sort of householder, because they might not have the capacity to use them optimally. It is therefore about appropriate solutions as well.\n\nWe recommend improvements based on modelled data and project savings from modelled interventions, but they will not necessarily deliver the benefits that the models would show. In some cases, they might be higher, but we need to be as accurate as possible. If we tell somebody that, by putting in whatever intervention, they will save X amount of money and then they do not, that will have a negative effect. At the same time, if we tell them that they will get Y amount of savings and they end up with more, they will be less incentivised to adopt further behavioural measures. The paper that we have coming out expands on that.\n\nIf we are going to recommend technical interventions, they have to be right and the benefits that we say each household will accrue have to be predicted reasonably accurately; otherwise, there will be negative consequences one way or the other. We can improve how we do that by putting the householders first and saying, for example, that they might need help with their bills or they might need an energy meter in the house to monitor their energy consumption over the next couple of months; that would give us a much better idea of the technical measures, the social measures and, possibly, the income support measures that that household will need so that we can treat them as a whole. We start with the people, but we do not exclude those technical solutions. However, by putting the people first, we end up with better technical solutions and cost effectiveness.\n\nAnnabelle Ewing\n\nI remain a bit confused. Someone who is living in a damp house wants that problem to be solved in the short term. Everything else—such as work on behaviour or managing household income—would flow from that, notwithstanding the fact that we do not control the key levers in that regard, as Kenny Gibson said.\n\nI am a very practical person and would not want to live in a damp house, so I do not find it acceptable to see anybody else living in a damp house. Dampness is a technical issue that can be sorted, then things can come in off the back of that. The other issues do not exclude tackling at source the first, fundamental problem. With respect, I am not convinced by what you have said. I agree that we should use the most relevant, appropriate and up-to-date data, but if a housing officer in Fife goes into a house and sees dampness, that needs to be sorted.\n\nDr Baker\n\nBut even with technical solutions, thinking that the dampness is the only problem that needs to be solved—and limiting the treatment to that—might cause other problems.\n\nI will give you a classic example from a study that we did a few years ago of a household containing a single-parent woman in a flat in Glasgow. The flat had a damp problem but also an insulation problem. Her child had asthma and she was told by the local authority that she needed to keep her windows closed to save on energy bills, and that extra insulation or whatever would be put in when the local authority got round to it. At the same time, however, her general practitioner was saying that if her kid had asthma, she needed to keep the windows open. That high-rise flat could be insulated, but that would not happen overnight; it could take months if not a year or two, depending on contracts. However, as you said, you want to get that person the best solutions first. There may therefore be other ways in which that person could be supported as part of a more holistic intervention.\n\nWe have to be careful not to create other technical or social problems in tackling a damp or high-energy problem; we have to put in the right solutions.\n\nAnnabelle Ewing\n\nI think that everyone would wish to see the right solutions. With respect, the issues that you talked about are not mutually exclusive. It is a question of working out the first problem to be tackled and taking things from there. If a home is damp, to me, that would require treating the dampness issue first; management and holistic approaches and so forth would follow thereafter. I am afraid, therefore, that I beg to disagree.\n\nThe Convener\n\nThank you for making your position clear, Annabelle. I will come in at this point, then I will take questions from Andy Wightman and Alex Rowley.\n\nYou talked about a holistic approach, Dr Baker, but surely the bill is already facing up to that in saying that education has to be a key component. I am sure that what you say makes sense theoretically and without the theory we do not get the practice—everybody has to agree with that. However, surely the way that you seem to be undermining the fabric-first approach with your folk-first approach—I accept that that was not your name for it—does not help. Others have already said that and my colleague, Alex Rowley, last week gave the example of a woman who got the interventions and went from spending 25 per cent of her income on bills to 5 per cent, which also helped her child with his chest problems and stopped him being admitted to hospital.\n\nAlthough I accept your point that some things cause another and that people have a responsibility to make sure that knock-on effects are dealt with, surely the first priority has to be that, if a house is in bad physical condition and a family is staying in it and suffering, you go in there and intervene. Members of the committee who were in Dundee and other places have seen examples of that and how, on the back of that, other services would be in there, too. Surely that is the right way forward.\n\nDr Baker\n\nFirst, I stress that I am not an academic sat in an ivory tower.\n\nThe Convener\n\nThat is not what I am suggesting at all.\n\nDr Baker\n\nI am not saying that you are, but a lot of the work that we do is with housing associations, community groups and local authorities in people’s homes. I do not just sit out here and collect the data; I work with people who go into people’s homes.\n\nI will take a step back from what you first said and use the example of a community project. The first thing that you can do is get somebody into a person’s household straight away—that could be at odd hours—and give them the reassurance that their problem will be solved. One problem that we have at the moment is the relative lack of support for and investment in face-to-face and in-home delivery. It might be that someone walks into somebody’s household late at night or early in the morning and a problem is dealt with straight away——I could probably find an example of that.\n\nGiving that bit of reassurance that help is on its way might lead to some early technical interventions, but the whole household can also be looked at while they are there and, if more intervention is needed down the line, a plan can be set out and the person can be engaged from the moment that that first contact is made. They can say, “I’m going to do this for you now, but I’ll come back in a couple of days, or you can come into our office, and we will sort out your energy bills and maybe look at a longer-term plan to replace your glazing or make more significant improvements.” A key issue is that we do not pass people from pillar to post and refer them from one service to another all the time, because they will drop out.\n\nThe Convener\n\nI do not think that there is a person here who would disagree with that; it is eminently sensible. However, the very early outcome of that has to be that the problem in the house is dealt with. We must deal with whatever the practical issue is—making the house warmer or dealing with the damp—and all the other things will flow from that first meeting.\n\nThere are already people doing that, and I accept that there may have to be an enlargement of that field, but I do not think that it is helpful almost to denigrate the fabric-first approach, when there is no doubt that we cannot improve people’s living standards without, in many cases, improving the fabric of their houses.\n\n10:15\n\nDr Baker\n\nThat is fine if the fabric interventions that are delivered end up delivering the savings that the models say that they will, and which the person is told that they will.\n\nTo throw the question back at you, if you are treating mould, what do you do? Do you go in, as I have just done with a flat, and spray a bit of mould spray around, which kills the mould temporarily? Or is the solution not just spraying the mould, but telling the person that their walls need to be stripped back? That cannot be done overnight. You might be dealing with a mould problem and you might think that a mould problem is quick and easy to solve, but—\n\nThe Convener\n\nI will use a politician’s answer. This session is not about questions to me; we are here to ask you questions. However, I will answer. We have already said that the whole situation has to be dealt with in the round, but we must deal with the problem that is causing the child’s asthma or whatever the case may be. We must look and see if there is a knock-on effect that will still cause the child problems. That has to be dealt with.\n\nI will let Kenny Gibson in briefly.\n\nKenneth Gibson\n\nIn work done in partnership with the Energy Agency, NHS Ayrshire and Arran has shown that\n\n“in areas where wall insulation has been installed there is a reduction in hospital admissions and GP visits.”\n\nThe committee has discussed the submission that the Energy Agency made. Does Dr Baker not agree with that?\n\nDr Baker\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nKenneth Gibson\n\nThat is with all else being equal, regardless of the other issues that we have talked about. The submission suggested that that measure alone has had an impact in reducing the number of hospital admissions and GP visits. Therefore, fabric first works—not entirely, but to an extent.\n\nDr Baker\n\nIt will lead to a reduction, but in most cases it will not lead to a change in the end point of that person’s health condition. I was one of the authors of the built environment report that supported the Scottish Government’s climate change plan—RPP3. The report said that there would be a reduction in GP appointments, but that, in most cases, a fabric-first intervention pushes back the trigger point when somebody will seek help from their GP. The classic situation is that an elderly person goes from their nice, warm living room to the bathroom, has a heart palpitation, then goes to see their GP. If their whole house is insulated, the point at which they consult their GP will be pushed back. That could mean that they make several fewer visits and there would be savings as a result. We have not yet done the maths on what those savings are to the national health service; that needs to be done. That is one of the things that supports our argument. If we could get proper data on those figures and savings, we could use that as a justification for more in-home advice and support. That would drive technical solutions, but it would also put householders first.\n\nAndy Wightman (Lothian) (Green)\n\nI will direct some questions at Professor Hirsch. The bill that we are scrutinising sets a target and gives a definition, and it makes provision for a fuel poverty strategy and some reporting. Dr Baker, early on in your evidence, you talked about the inadequacies of the EPC ratings. The bill does not make any provision on that. To be clear, the references that you made were just about delivery, which will be dealt with through the strategy and all the rest of it.\n\nThe definition of fuel poverty is now more complex. The first thing that I want to clarify is that the definition is used along with the Scottish household survey and other statistics to come up with a national figure of the proportion of the population that is living in fuel poverty. We had the latest data yesterday.\n\nTo what extent could the definition be used when designing delivery programmes? As I understand the bill, the purpose of the definition is to provide headline statistics for the country. Would you agree that how Glasgow City Council, Argyll and Bute Council or any other authority goes about reducing fuel poverty—and deciding where to target its approach—is a separate question?\n\nDr Baker\n\nYes, I would.\n\nProfessor Hirsch\n\nIn itself, the definition could not be used in that way, because it is a heterogeneous problem: there are different drivers in different areas. The way in which the definition is designed and the incentives that that produces could influence the emphasis that is put on different interventions. For that reason, how you phrase your definition matters.\n\nAndy Wightman\n\nDr Hirsch, you are critical of modelled data. What is the fundamental problem with that? Is it a problem regarding getting an accurate assessment of the proportion of people who live in fuel poverty, or is it a problem in relation to ensuring that the programmes that are designed to reduce fuel poverty are well designed?\n\nProfessor Hirsch\n\nI am not quite sure what you meant when you said that I am “critical of modelled data.”\n\nAndy Wightman\n\nI am sorry—I meant Dr Baker.\n\nDr Baker\n\nThe simple answer is both. It has become quite clear—particularly from our work, but also from the Scottish house condition survey stats—that there is a question about whether we need a remote rural adjustment in the definition. Is the condition of fuel poverty in rural areas and, in particular, re"
