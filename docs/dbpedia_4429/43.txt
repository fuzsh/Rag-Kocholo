Some customers are supplied by us because we organise their local oil club. Others choose to benefit from our smart monitoring technology. Some like speaking to Nicola in the office, or appreciate that Russell comes out to check on their tank. There are plenty who order their oil from us because for as long as they can remember they’ve never been let down on service or price.

Whatever your reason for using Johnston Oils, we’ll make sure you speak to local sales people and receive your delivery from an experienced tanker driver - just as we have been since we made our first delivery in 1965.

Based at our Head Office in Bathgate, we have Depots and Distributors covering Scotland and parts of England.

With over 50 years experience in oil distribution, you can rely on Johnston Oils to deliver.
