        "text": "T1. Evaluating the Effects of C-Reactive Protein Overexpression and Risk for PTSD-Like Behaviors in Mice Exposed to Trauma\n\nSamantha Friend*, Sorana Caldwell, Rahul Nachnani, April Crossan, Mei Hua Gao, Ngai C. Lai, H. Kirk Hammond, Victoria Risbrough\n\nUniversity of California, San Diego School of Medicine, San Diego, California, United States\n\nBackground: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains a growing and often debilitating psychiatric disorder resulting from severe trauma. Increasing evidence suggests a role for systemic and neurological inflammation in the pathophysiology of fear and trauma exposure based psychiatric disorders (Micholpoulos et al., 2017; Haroon et al., 2012). Several large case-control and prospective studies have shown associations with PTSD diagnosis and elevated serum peripheral inflammatory markers, including the acute phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP) (Spitzer et al., 2010; Passos et al., 2014). Moreover, one prospective study demonstrated that marines who were diagnosed with post-deployment PTSD previously had a two-fold higher baseline serum CRP levels prior to deployment (Eraly et al., 2014). CRP genetic mutations have also been positively correlated with increased PTSD symptoms, further suggesting CRP may confer risk for PTSD pathogenesis (Michopoulos et al., 2015). We tested the hypothesis that increased CRP after gene transfer using an adeno-associated virus (AAV8) encoding murine CRP may confer a higher risk for PTSD-like behaviors after predator stress.\n\nMethods: Male C57BL6J mice received a single intrajugular injection of 1011 genome copies (gc) of either AAV8.CRP or AAV8.Null. Four weeks after infection, mice were exposed to either predator stress (10 minutes roomed with a laboratory cat) or handled (stress control). After one week, mice were tested for avoidance behaviors by open field and light-dark box testing. Two weeks post predator stress, we assessed avoidance of trauma cues by measuring exploration of a cue scented with dirty cat litter. Mice where cheek-bled one day after the trauma reminder to measure differential peripheral CRP protein expression post trauma reminder. We further assessed fear conditioning by pairing five separate twenty-second tones (75 dB, 4 kHz) with terminal shocks (0.7 mAmps, 1 second) and forty second inter-trial intervals (ITI). Twenty-four hours later, contextual fear was assessed by exposing mice to the chambers for 16 minutes without tones or shocks. After a final twenty-four hours, mice were exposed again to thirty-two tones (20 seconds, 5 second ITI) within chambers containing altered visual, tactile, and odor dimensions to minimize contextual fear. Following fear conditioning, mice were sacrificed for further brain and peripheral tissue analysis.\n\nResults: 6 weeks post AAV8.CRP infection, and subsequent to predator stress and trauma reminder behavioral testing, levels of plasma CRP were almost three-fold higher in animals who had received AAV8.CRP (~18,300 ng/mL, n = 29) compared to AAV8.Null (~6,500 ng/mL, n = 32, p < 0.0001). Predator stress did not significantly alter CRP levels in either group (n = 17-19). A composite avoidance score (average of Z-scores across open field, light-dark box, and trauma reminder) demonstrated a main effect of increased avoidance behaviors by two-way ANOVA (Fstress = 9.10, p = 0.0036), though CRP overexpression had no effect either in baseline avoidance or in response to predator stress. Predator stress also increased conditioned fear acquisition as evidence by increased freezing (Fstress = 4.21, n = 11-13, p = 0.006), overall there was no effect of either predator stress or CRP on either contextual freezing or in freezing with altered context. CRP expression across peripheral organs and brain will also be discussed.\n\nConclusions: This preliminary study indicated that CRP overexpression exposure did not induce increase risk for avoidance behaviors or conditioned fear after trauma exposure through predator stress, despite high levels of protein. Further investigation is still required to determine if there are sex-specific differences. These data indicate that when limited to adulthood, high CRP loads representing physiological levels in humans do not appear to be sufficient to alter susceptibility to trauma. These results suggest that either CRP gene mutations are required to increase risk or that CRP may only be a marker of immune pathology but is not itself directly contributing to PTSD pathogenesis.\n\nKeywords: PTSD, Inflammation, CRP\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT2. Olfactory Memory Codes in the Dentate Gyrus\n\nNick Woods*, Fabio Stefanini, Mazen Kheirbek\n\nUniversity of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States\n\nBackground: A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how sensory stimuli are encoded within ensembles of neurons, and how these representations are modified by learning. The hippocampus (HPC) has a well-documented function in encoding spatial information, however, it also encodes non-spatial information crucial for memory formation. Granule cells (GCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus receive input from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), which is known to process olfactory information. This is of interest as these structures are known to be involved in memory generalization, a process impaired in individuals with post-traumatic stress, and are vulnerable to ageing and age-related memory decline. If and how the DG encodes and discriminates olfactory information, and how this information is stored into memory is currently unknown. Here, we identified the DG as a critical hub for generating odor-outcome associations, encoding odor identity using a population code. In addition, we identify how representations change in response to fear learning, defining both stability and dynamism in populations of DG GCs.\n\nMethods: We used in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging combined with behavior to determine the mechanisms by which DG GCs represent odor information and how learning alters these representations. We first developed a fear conditioning task in which mice discriminate between three odorants, two similar (methyl butyrate (CS + ) and ethyl butyrate (CS-)) and one distinct (isoamyl acetate (CS-)). After conditioning to CS + , mice are tested to each odor and freezing is assessed to measure how well the mice can discriminate between odors. In a separate context, we performed head-fixed calcium imaging of odor responses in DG GCs in awake mice, before and after odor learning. We blocked synaptic transmission in the LEC-DG pathway using AAV-expressing tetanus toxin light chain (TeLC), and measured effects on learning and neural population odor responses.\n\nResults: In both imaging sessions (pre and postconditioning), a subset of DG GCs show odor-selectivity, responding to individual or pairs of odors, as well as odor offset. Analysis of the population code in DG GCs showed high similarity in the ensembles of neurons representing repeated presentations of the same odor, with little overlap in the similarity between separate odors. Using machine learning techniques, we were able to predict odor identity from DG GC activity with very high accuracy ( > 80%) for three odor cues. Moreover, decoding accuracy was just as high in deciphering similar odors as between distinct odor pairs, supporting the notion that the DG is a structure involved in pattern separation. Up to six odors were tested in a given imaging session, and decoding performance remained significant, suggesting DG ensembles can flexibly encode many stimuli and each can be detected as a unique identity. Valence classes were not encoded at the level of DG population responses. Mice were fear conditioned to one of the odors and discrimination scores were taken for freezing to the conditioned odorant and a highly similar odorant. Remarkably, odor classification accuracy before conditioning predicted the animal’s behavioral discrimination between similar odor pairs. To determine how neural representations change with learning, we tested two groups of mice, one was conditioned to an odorant with a footshock, and a control group that did not receive a shock, and tracked activity in the same neurons before and after conditioning. We trained our decoder with neural data from the preconditioning session and tested on the data after conditioning. This revealed accurate decoding of all odors across in both groups of mice, indicating that the neural population code for odor identity is stable across time regardless of conditioning. However, changes in single cell responses could be detected in the conditioned animals. We found that the small population of cells tuned to the CS + odor before learning were more likely to maintain their selectivity to the CS + compared to animals that did not receive footshock. In addition, cells tuned to the CS- similar odor in the preconditioning day shifted selectivity toward the CS + odor after conditioning only in the animal receiving a footshock. These results suggest that learning can produce dynamic changes in the small population of selective cells, but the population level response is stable, maintaining odor identity across timescales of days and regardless of conditioning.\n\nConclusions: These results demonstrate a population code for odor identity in an LEC to DG circuit and the stability of that code despite a robust learning event and individual cells altering responsivity. Uncovering the code for odor memories in the DG could offer new insights as to how the DG encodes information and discriminates between incoming information. These studies pave the way to generating new targeted approaches for improving memory generalization deficits often seen in anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress or with cognitive decline in ageing.\n\nKeywords: In Vivo Calcium Imaging, Dentate Gyrus, Olfactory\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT3. MicroRNA Regulation of Persistent Stress-Enhanced Memory\n\nStephanie Sillivan*, Sarah Jamieson, Laurence de Nijs, Meghan Jones, Clara Snijders, Torsten Klengel, Nadine Joseph, Julian Krauskopf, Jos Kleinjans, Christiaan Vinkers, Marco Boks, Elbert Geuze, Eric Vermetten, Kerry Ressler, Bart Rutten, Gavin Rumbaugh, Courtney Miller\n\nTemple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States\n\nBackground: Mechanisms supporting long-lasting, remote memory are largely unknown, yet highly relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders of memory, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a chronic, debilitating disorder in which patients exhibit memories of trauma that are heightened, perseverant and extinction-resistant. Nearly everyone experiences at least one traumatic event in their lifetime, but only 10-20% will later display enduring symptoms of PTSD. We previously developed a stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL) paradigm in inbred C57BL/6 mice that results in PTSD-like characteristics, including persistently enhanced memory in a subset of mice termed stress stress-susceptible (SS). Importantly, this SEFL protocol allows for the study of molecular phenotypes associated with selective vulnerability, as SS mice can be identified from training data, avoiding mechanistic confounds introduced by additional phenotyping. Relative to stress-resilient animals (SR), SS mice have heightened cFos activation in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC) upon retrieval of the remote stress memory (30 days post-training) and differential BLC expression of genes with known polymorphisms in human PTSD genomic studies. Disruption of persistent, stress-associated memories is relevant for treating PTSD and microRNAs (miRNAs) are excellent remote memory candidate regulators. miRNAs are endogenous ~20-24 nucleotide RNAs that act as translational repressors through direct binding to the 3’-UTR of target mRNAs and noncleavage degradation of the target mRNA via deadenylation. miRNAs have a wide genomic range of potential target proteins that confers a complexity capable of handling the intricacies of memory but the contribution of miRNAs to long-lasting, remote ( > 30 days) memory is unknown.\n\nMethods: We performed small-RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics on BLC tissue from SEFL animals collected one month after training. Bioinformatic pathway analysis was used to identify candidate miRNAs and target proteins persistently regulated by traumatic memory. In vivo functional manipulation of a candidate miRNA in SEFL animals was performed to further delineate the role of the miRNA in long-lasting memory expression. Levels of the miRNA were measured in postmortem human amygdala tissue with qPCR and in human serum samples from a well-characterized Dutch PTSD military cohort with small-RNA sequencing.\n\nResults: We identified persistently changed miRNAs, including mir-135b-5p, and predicted target proteins associated with PTSD-like heightened fear expression. 18 (24%) of predicted mir-135b-5p protein targets detected in the BLC were differentially regulated between SS and SR animals. Pathway analysis of these 18 mir-135b-5p putative targets that were changed by SEFL identified annotations related to learning and synaptic plasticity. Functional manipulations of BLC mir-135b-5p with short hairpin inhibition or viral-mediated overexpression bidirectionally modulated stress-associated memory in SEFL animals without impacting baseline anxiety levels. mir-135b-5p is expressed in human amygdala and its passenger strand was selectively elevated in members of the military diagnosed with PTSD relative to members without the diagnosis and non-trauma exposed healthy military controls.\n\nConclusions: miR-135b-5p may be an important therapeutic target for dampening persistent, stress-enhanced memory and its passenger strand a potential biomarker for responsivity to a mir-135-based therapeutic.\n\nKeywords: Stress Resilience, MicroRNA, Remote Memory\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT4. Precision Medicine and Noradrenergic Biomarkers in PTSD: Preliminary Methods and Validation Data for an Aggregated N-Of-1 Clinical Trial Design Using Pupillometery and Cardiovascular Biomarkers\n\nRebecca Hendrickson*, Steve Millard, Shofer Jane, Nicholas Schork, Murray Raskind\n\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States\n\nBackground: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a clinical diagnosis that is likely to contain multiple subtypes, with distinct pathophysiological profiles. This unmeasured heterogeneity may contribute to the inconsistent results of pharmacologic treatment trials, where the efficacy of both serotonergic and noradrenergic pharmacotherapies (e.g. SSRI/SNRIs and prazosin) appears to vary both from trial to trial and from person to person. Precision medicine is an approach to clinical research and practice that is designed to address this traditionally unmeasured heterogeneity. Here, we present the preliminary methods and validation data for a new precision medicine trial using pupillometric and cardiovascular biomarkers in PTSD.\n\nPrecision medicine seeks to identify patient characteristics that can be measured upfront in order to more effectively match a particular patient to a treatment that is more likely to be efficacious. Previously published post hoc data have suggested that in young males, pre-treatment measurements of cardiovascular biomarkers of peripheral noradrenergic signaling may be able to predict who will have a clinically significant decrease in PTSD symptoms in response to the α1 noradrenergic antagonist prazosin. However, this finding has not been prospectively tested, and is unlikely to generalize to women, older individuals, or those with medical comorbidities. Pupillary dilation, which is also an α1 noradrenaline receptor mediated reflex, may represent an alternative biomarker with wider generalizability.\n\nAn additional challenge in precision medicine is that the traditional parallel-group randomized controlled trial is poorly optimized to test hypotheses about predictive biomarkers. They also require that many participants spend the full duration of the study on placebo, which can limit the enrollment of patients with acute symptoms, particularly when the intervention being tested is already widely available. An alternative approach is the use of N-of-1 trial design, where each individual participant spends time in multiple treatment conditions, such as active treatment and placebo; in aggregated N-of-1 trials, a cohort of individuals move through this same type of trial design, and their outcomes are analyzed together to answer questions about e.g. the relationship of a baseline characteristic to the magnitude of treatment response.\n\nHere, we describe the preliminary methods and validation data for a novel aggregated N-of-1 clinical trial designed to test whether pupillometeric and cardiovascular biomarkers predict clinical response to prazosin in treatment-seeking Veterans with PTSD. In addition to preliminary data regarding our biomarkers, we present a set of statistical simulations comparing the power of the selected versus alternative trial designs.\n\nMethods: Pupillometric biomarkers measured include maximal dark-adapted pupil diameter, average dilation velocity (ADV) of the pupil following cessation of a brief light pulse, and peak pupillary dilation following phenylephrine ophthalmic application (PPD). Pupillometric biomarkers were measured using a NeurOptics PLR-3000 handheld device. Cardiovascular biomarkers included systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured two minutes after standing and the change in SBP from supine position to seated.\n\nFor the statistical simulations of the clinical trial designs, R statistical software was used to simulate the data from: (1) an open-label trial; (2) an open-label phase followed by a blinded discontinuation phase; (3) a traditional crossover trial; and (4) an open label phase, followed by a blinded discontinuation phase and a brief crossover phase. Results were analyzed using a linear mixed effects model.\n\nResults: Pupillometric and cardiovascular measurements were well tolerated by participants. In very preliminary results (N = 3), but consistent with predictions, total PTSD symptom severity was positively associated with peak pupillary dilation (PPD, p = .03), and change in SBP from supine to seated appeared positively associated with ADV (p = .09). Trial designs 3 & 4 had substantially higher power with fewer subjects than open label and open label plus blinded discontinuation designs, a pattern maintained across a substantial number of permutations of the modeling assumptions.\n\nConclusions: Assessment of pupillometric and cardiovascular biomarkers is well tolerated, and feasible for a clinical trial or clinical practice setting. The preliminary results from biomarker measurements were consistent with their predicted relationships to PTSD symptom expression. The results of the statistical simulations suggest that both a cross-over trial design, and an aggregated N-of-1 trial design beginning with an open label titration phase, provide superior power over an open label or open label plus discontinuation design in detecting an association between a predictive biomarker and the clinical response to the PTSD pharmacotherapeutic prazosin. These results provide support for a prospective test of whether noradrenergic biomarkers can provide clinically significant predictions of the likelihood of an individual having a meaningful response to prazosin for PTSD, using an aggregated N-of-1 trial design. This framework for approaching precision medicine goals in psychiatric research is expected to have utility for a range of specific research topics.\n\nKeywords: PTSD, Noradrenaline, Clinical Trial Design, Biomarkers, Prazosin\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT5. Unconditioned Responses During a Fear-Conditioning Paradigm Predict Physiological and Neural Correlates of Fear Extinction Recall in Anxious Individuals\n\nMarie-France Marin*, Mira Hammoud, Mohammed Milad\n\nUniversité du Québec à Montréal, Research Center of the Montreal Mental Health University Institute, Montreal, Canada\n\nBackground: Fear conditioning and extinction paradigms are used in the laboratory to better understand how individuals learn fear and safety associations. In this type of paradigm, a neutral stimulus (e.g., a colored lamp, conditioned stimulus, CS + ) is presented along with an aversive stimulus (e.g., shock), which in itself provokes a physiological reaction (named unconditioned response, UCR). Eventually, a similar physiological response can be induced with the presentation of the CS + alone, what is called a conditioned response. Following this fear-conditioning phase, extinction learning takes place where the CS + is presented multiple times without any reinforcement, which gradually decreases the physiological reaction. Extinction recall memory also be tested after a delay in order to examine whether the safety memory trace, formed during extinction learning, has been properly consolidated and/or can be adequately retrieved. Previous studies have shown that individuals suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and from anxiety disorders exhibit deficient extinction recall, either at the neural and/or physiological level. This being said, beyond the identified group differences, there is a need to identify biomarkers that could be used as predictors of extinction recall. Here, we tested whether UCRs to an aversive stimulus during fear learning could predict psychophysiological and neural responses during extinction learning and extinction recall.\n\nMethods: Eighty-seven individuals suffering from an anxiety disorder were recruited and exposed to a 2-day fear conditioning and extinction protocol in a fMRI environment. On day 1, three colored lamps were presented, two of which were partially reinforced with a mild electric shock (CS + ) and the third one was never reinforced (CS-). Immediately after, extinction learning took place where one of the CS + was presented along with the CS-. The next day, extinction recall was tested by presenting all three cues again. For each phase, skin conductance responses (SCR) were measured. UCRs to the shock presentations were computed for each individual. Four groups were generated based on their UCRs (from very low to very high UCRs). Between-groups comparisons were tested for skin conductance responses and for BOLD signal during early and late extinction learning and during early extinction recall. For each fMRI contrast mentioned above, we looked for a main effect of group in the following regions of interests (ROIs) known to be involved in the fear circuitry: amygdala, hippocampus, insular cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Significant clusters (p < 0.005) identified within the masks (based on ROIs) were tested for small-volume corrections. Beta-weights were extracted in order to conduct post-hoc analyses.\n\nResults: Groups did not differ in terms of education, shock intensity, and sex distribution. They did however differ on age. Therefore, all analyses presented below controlled for that variable. For extinction learning, a significant Time X Group interaction was found for SCR, F(3,70) = 3.32, p = 0.025. Decomposing the interaction, we found that the group exhibiting the highest UCR during fear conditioning had higher SCR to CS + during early extinction learning relative to all other groups. Importantly, no group differences were found during late extinction learning (p = 0.74), suggesting that all groups reached similar physiological fear levels at the end of extinction learning. The fMRI analyses yielded no significant group differences in the ROIs. For extinction recall, a Stimulus X Group interaction was revealed, F(3,67) = 3.98, p = 0.011, with the group with the highest UCR exhibiting higher fear levels to the CS + relative to the other groups. No group effects were found for the CS-. Moreover, a significant correlation was revealed between UCR and SCR to the CS + during extinction recall (r = 0.499, p < 0.001). At the neural level, a main effect of Group was found in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (pfwe = 0.048). Post-hoc analyses on the extracted beta-weights revealed lower dACC activation in the group with the lowest UCR relative to the group exhibiting the highest UCR (p = 0.017).\n\nConclusions: Our results suggest that unconditioned responses, assessed via skin conductance responses, during a fear-learning paradigm could inform about fear reactivity during extinction recall, assessed both with physiological and neural measures. Importantly, this result is specific to extinction recall, given that all groups had similar fear levels, in terms of SCR and BOLD signal, at the end of extinction learning. Given that deficits in extinction recall have been shown to characterize multiple fear-based and anxiety disorders, these results point to a potential biomarker that could be used to predict later expression of fear. Future studies in anxiety patients should assess whether unconditioned responses could be predictive of response to exposure-based therapy, which relies on fear extinction learning principles.\n\nKeywords: Unconditioned Responses, Fear Extinction, Extinction Memory Recall, Skin Conductance Responses, Anxiety Disorders\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT6. Neural Mechanisms of Spatial Attention Deficits in Trauma\n\nAbstract not included.\n\nT7. Longitudinal Investigation of Advanced Epigenetic Age and Change in Peripheral Biomarkers of Inflammation and Metabolic Syndrome\n\nFilomene Morrison*, Hannah Maniates, Mark Logue, Annjanette Stone, Steven Schichman, Regina McGlinchey, William Milberg, Mark Miller, Erika Wolf\n\nBoston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: Epigenetic age estimations based on DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles can be used to predict human chronological age with a high level of accuracy. These DNAm age profiles can also be used to index advanced cellular age, when estimated DNAm age exceeds chronological age. The goal of the present study was to understand the biological changes associated with advanced epigenetic age over time, given that accelerated cellular age has previously demonstrated association with a variety of diseases and early death.\n\nMethods: We investigated associations between two measures of epigenetic age acceleration (Hannum and Horvath) and changes in peripheral metabolic and inflammatory markers in a longitudinal cohort of 179 veterans who were assessed over the course of two years. The cohort was enriched for PTSD and other psychopathology and we have previously demonstrated that trauma-related psychopathology is associated with advanced epigenetic age (Wolf et al., 2016), making this cohort particularly relevant for understanding the biological correlates of advanced epigenetic age over time.\n\nResults: Analyses revealed that, controlling for chronological age, sex, race, education, PTSD, and baseline biomarkers, advanced DNAm age at baseline was associated with residualized change in metabolic syndrome (MetS) severity at T2, suggestive of worsening MetS pathology (p < .001). Follow-up analyses found that this association was specific to worsening obesity (as measured by lipid panels and indicators of abdominal obesity: p = .001). Advanced Hannum DNAm age at T1 was nominally associated with residualized change in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and total white blood cells at T2 (for CRP: p = .058; for white blood cells: p = .051). We also found that PTSD symptom severity at T1 predicted decreasing (i.e., worsening) CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios at T2 (p = .015). There were no significant associations between baseline Horvath DNAm age and change in any of the biological variables at T2.\n\nConclusions: Results suggest that advanced epigenetic age may hasten pathological metabolic and inflammatory processes, which could be one mechanism linking advanced epigenetic age to morbidity and mortality.\n\nKeywords: DNA Methylation, Metabolic Syndrome, C-Reactive Protein, PTSD\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT8. Functional Impacts of Acute Stress on Negative Affective Circuit Function in Anxiety and Depression\n\nAndrea Goldstein-Piekarski*, Leonardo Tozzi, Keith Sudheimer, Alan Schatzberg, Leanne Williams\n\nStanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States\n\nBackground: Dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and negative affective circuit, which includes the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC), have independently been associated with mood and anxiety disorders. Consistent with these relationships, both disorders are conceptualized within a vulnerability-stress framework in which stress is thought to cause long-term alterations in the function of affective circuitry which in turn, sensitizes the stress response. Threat-elicited hyper-activity of the amygdala along with hypo-activity of the prefrontal cortex has been observed in individuals with mood and anxiety disorders and with high-trait anxiety. Mood and anxiety disorders have also been associated with HPA dysfunction assayed by diurnal cortisol profiles (most consistently elevated), and by abnormal negative feedback of stress hormones indexed by the dexamethasone suppression test. HPA stress responses are modulated by input from the amygdala and PFC. Conversely, baseline levels of stress hormones (including cortisol) as well as the release of stress hormones in response to stressors are also both associated with amygdala and PFC reactivity and connectivity. Despite the above evidence of abnormal negative affective circuit profiles in nodes such as the amygdala and PFC that are critically involved in and influenced by stress responding, it remains unexplored how HPA dysregulation may contribute to and/or explain these neuroimaging phenotypes. Addressing this issue, we tested the contribution of abnormal stress responding in the negative affective circuit and clinical profiles by using a repeated-measures design in which a commonly used MRI stress induction paradigm is interleaved between emotional face probes, in combination with cortisol assays.\n\nMethods: 16 unmedicated individuals experiencing anxiety and depression symptoms completed the same standardized imaging procedure twice under two conditions (stress induction, control) separated by at least once week. Negative affective circuit function was assessed using an established emotional face task. Regions of interest (ROIs) included bilateral amygdala and the medial PFC (mPFC). During the stress visit, the emotion task was preceded by a stress induction paradigm (Montreal Neuroimaging Stress Task). In contrast, on the control visit, the emotion task was preceded by a neutral control task. Subjective stress and cortisol levels were acquired at multiple time points across the imaging sessions. Cortisol trajectories were visually inspected and used to classify participants into those who did and did not have the expected stress response following induction. Mean contrast estimates for the anger versus neutral face contrast were extracted for each of the ROIs and entered into subsequent analyses. Linear mixed models were then used to assess the impact of condition (stress induction, control) and stress response status (stress response, no stress response) on negative affective circuit function.\n\nResults: As a group, the stress induction significantly increased cortisol levels as measured by the area under the curve (t = 2.43; p = 0.028). However, there was significant variation across individuals: six participants elicited the expected cortisol stress response while ten did not. Negative affective circuit function did not differ between the two conditions (all p’s = > 0.05) nor between the stress response status groups (all p’s > 0.05). Importantly, there was a significant interaction between condition and stress response status for amygdala activation (left: F = 10.22, p = 0.006; Right: F = 5.93; p = 0.029). Those who elicited a cortisol stress response following the stress induction also saw an increase in amygdala activation across conditions (left: t = 2.28, p = 0.039; Right: t = 1.96, p = 0.060). Conversely, those who did not elicit a cortisol response saw a decrease in amygdala activation across conditions (left: t = -2.28, p = 0.039; Right: t = -1.44, p = 0.022). No effects were found for the PFC (all p > 0.05).\n\nConclusions: Our results advance our understanding of how HPA axis dysfunction may be associated with abnormal negative affect circuit function in anxious and depressed individuals.\n\nKeywords: Amygdala, HPA Axis, Cortisol, Anxiety, Depression\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT9. Childhood Maltreatment is Associated With White Matter Alterations in Temporal Pathways Regardless of PTSD Diagnostic Status: A Probabilistic Tractography Analysis\n\nElizabeth Olson*, Caroline Ostrand, Tate Overbey, Scott Rauch, Isabelle Rosso\n\nMcLean Hospital - Harvard Medical School, Belmont, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: Consistent with a large body of literature demonstrating white matter tract abnormalities including reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in temporal tracts in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), our group previously found reduced FA in the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) in PTSD patients compared with trauma-exposed controls (Olson et al., 2017). However, because childhood maltreatment and PTSD diagnosis were statistically overlapping, it was unclear whether those group differences could be attributable to childhood adverse experiences. Choi et al (2012) previously found that witnessing inter-parental violence was associated with reduced FA in the left ILF, a part of the visual limbic pathway involved in processing visual and auditory stimuli related to emotion, learning, and memory. They theorized that exposure to threatening facial expressions and voices may result in an over-activation of visual-limbic cortices connected by the ILF, so that repeated exposure to violence ultimately inhibits the development of this pathway. Given these findings, we attempted to replicate our study demonstrating reduced FA in the ILF in PTSD, in a new sample including controls reporting a broad range of childhood adverse event exposure. We hypothesized that reduced FA would be associated with PTSD diagnostic status and also with total exposure to childhood maltreatment. Previous studies have demonstrated that forms of maltreatment including emotional abuse and emotional/physical neglect that do not meet DSM-IV criterion A for PTSD are also associated with white matter tract abnormalities. Therefore, we hypothesized that non-criterion A childhood maltreatment (emotional abuse, emotional and physical neglect) would yield similar effects on ILF FA as forms of childhood abuse that are consistent with criterion A exposure (physical and sexual abuse).\n\nMethods: This sample included 93 participants, age 20-50 (M = 33.50, SD = 8.37): 32 with DSM-IV lifetime PTSD (19 F, 13 M), 27 trauma-exposed non-PTSD controls (TENC: 15 F, 12 M), and 34 healthy controls (17 F, 17 M). Participants completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV I/P), the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). The CTQ generates scores on 5 subscales (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect). Scores were summed to generate a total abuse exposure variable. We also summed the physical and sexual abuse categories to create a combined criterion-A-type exposure score and summed the neglect and emotional abuse categories to create a combined non-criterion-A-type exposure score. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was collected on a Siemens 3.0 T Trio (TR, 7300 ms; TE; 80 ms; 72 directions at b = 1000 plus 8 b = 0 images). Data were preprocessed in FSL and automatic probabilistic tractography was performed using FreeSurfer’s TRACULA to measure DTI metrics (FA, mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD)) within the ILF bilaterally.\n\nResults: In contrast to our previous report, after controlling for age and sex, there was no significant effect of diagnostic status on ILF FA, F(4,176) = 1.107, p = 0.355, partial eta squared = 0.025. Across the entire sample, after controlling for age and sex, greater total childhood trauma exposure was associated with reduced ILF FA, F(2,87) = 3.656, p = 0.030, partial eta squared = 0.078. This effect was significant bilaterally (left ILF, F(1,88) = 6.788, p = 0.011, partial eta squared = 0.072; right ILF, F(1,88) = 5.350, p = 0.023, partial eta squared = 0.057). The association between childhood trauma exposure and reduced ILF FA persisted after additionally controlling for diagnostic group, F(2,85) = 4.118, p = 0.020. The effect of childhood maltreatment on ILF FA was significant for criterion-A-type exposures (i.e., physical and sexual abuse), F(2,87) = 3.230, p = 0.044, as well as for non-criterion-A-type exposures (i.e., emotional abuse and emotional and physical neglect), F(2,88) = 3.519, p = 0.034. The effect of total childhood trauma exposure also was significantly associated with reduced ILF FA within the combined TENC and PTSD groups, F(2,53) = 3.545, p = 0.036. Despite associations between FA and childhood trauma exposure, childhood trauma was not associated with alterations in the other DTI metrics (MD, RD, AD).\n\nConclusions: Total exposure to childhood maltreatment was associated with reduced FA in both left and right ILF independent of PTSD diagnostic status. Furthermore, both criterion A type maltreatment and non-criterion A type maltreatment were correlated with reduced FA in this tract. In contrast to our previous report, these results suggest that differences in the structural integrity of white matter in the ILF may be due to exposure to childhood maltreatment rather than diagnostic status. Considering the involvement of the ILF in processing visual and auditory information, exposure to adverse early life events may be implicated in abnormal sensory processing. Our results suggest that reduced ILF FA (and possibly associated sensory processing abnormalities) is associated with childhood maltreatment broadly, including neglect and emotional abuse as well as more violent forms of exposure.\n\nKeywords: PTSD, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Childhood Maltreatment, Child Abuse and Neglect\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT10. The Role of Respiratory Noradrenergic Projections to the Basal Lateral Amygdala in Anxiety-Related Behavior\n\nVena Martinez*, Jenny Sun, Russell Ray\n\nBaylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States\n\nBackground: The most commonly reported symptom of panic attacks is respiratory dysfunction, such as hyperventilation. It has been shown that subsets of patients with anxiety disorders have a greater sensitivity for carbon dioxide level imbalances, and exposure to high levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) can induce anxiety-like behavior, such as panic attacks. The false suffocation alarm hypothesis posits that inappropriate activation of respiratory chemoreceptors, sensors of carbon dioxide levels, in response to benign indices triggers an alarm of suffocation danger and may contribute to anxiety and panic disorders. Two potential candidates that may link anxiogenic and respiratory circuitry are the central noradrenergic (NA) system and the basal lateral amygdala (BLA), both of which have been shown to play roles in both breathing and anxiety. Therefore, we hypothesize that projections from the brainstem NA nuclei to the BLA play a functional role in modulating the hypercapnic ventilatory response and anxiety-like behavior in mice.\n\nMethods: To test this hypothesis, we targeted NA neurons that project to the BLA by using a Cre-expressing retrograde virus applied to the BLA of our intersectional DBH-p2a-FLPo; RR5, multicolor reporter line to conduct projection mapping of NA neurons that project to the BLA and DBH-p2a-FLPo; RR1 and RR2 DREADD mice to specifically inhibit or stimulate, respectively, NA neurons that project to the BLA in vivo. In these mice, we measured respiratory output using whole-body plethysmography and anxiety-like behavior using open field, light dark and elevated plus maze.\n\nResults: Anatomical projection mapping reveal that NA neurons that project to the BLA are highly collateralized, projecting to additional brainstem and forebrain regions associated with respiration and negative affective disorders, and that these NA projections are primarily derived from the locus coeruleus (LC). Upon stimulation of NA neurons that project to the BLA, there was no change in hypercapnic response (n = 9, p > 0.5). However, we observed increased distance traveled in the center (n = 9, p < 0.5), decreased distance traveled in the perimeter (n = 9, p < 0.5) and decreased latency to enter the center of the open field. Additionally, there was decreased distance traveled in the dark zone of the light dark assay (n = 9, p < 0.5), but no change in anxiety-related behavior in elevated plus maze. Conversely, upon inhibition of NA neurons that project to the BLA, there was a decrease in the hypercapnic response (n = 7, p > 0.5), although not significant. We observed a decrease in distance traveled in the center of the open field (n = 7, p < 0.5) and an increased distance traveled in the illuminated region of the light dark assay (n = 7, p < 0.5). There was also decreased distance traveled in the enclosed arms (n = 7, p < 0.5), as well as increased latency to first entry of enclosed arms in the elevated plus maze (n = 7, p < 0.5). Respiratory data was analyzed using a linear mixed-effects regression model, significance at an alpha = 0.05. Behavior data was analyzed using multiple t-tests, assuming samples from populations with same scatter (SD) and corrected using Holm-Sidak method, significance at an alpha = 0.05.\n\nConclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that NA neurons that project to the BLA may play a role in both the hypercapnic response and anxiety-related behavior, beginning to illustrate the role of respiratory circuitry in negative affective disorders, suggesting that further study of NA subpopulations based on efferent target should greatly advance our current understanding of related psychopathologies.\n\nKeywords: Amygdala, Noradrenaline, Anxiety, Respiration, DREADD Receptor\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT11.

Determining the Role of the Central Amygdala in Modulating Complex Fear States\n\nMaria Dorofeikova, Ryan Martin, Alexis Resendez, Jonathan Fadok*\n\nTulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States\n\nBackground: Anxiety disorders are debilitating psychiatric illnesses that are characterized by maladaptive responses to perceived threat. Threatening stimuli cause alterations in neuronal circuits that act to elicit adaptive defensive responses. Importantly, associative learning causes plastic changes in these neuronal circuits that allow organisms to use predictive cues to adequately respond to danger. Deficits or abnormalities in the ability to express appropriate defensive behavior in response to learned cues could underlie anxiety disorders such as specific phobia, panic, and post-traumatic stress disorder; however, the neuronal processes that regulate defensive response intensity are poorly understood. Associative learning related to aversive experience is modeled in the laboratory with Pavlovian fear conditioning. Freezing is the dominant behavioral response elicited in this paradigm and has therefore become the standard experimental readout of aversive learning. However, defensive responses are highly complex and there is a critical need to move beyond reductionist readouts of learned fear towards methods that capture the full range of behavioral adaptations to perceived threat. Indeed, we need to establish a better understanding of the neurophysiological changes that drive defensive responding if we are to develop better therapeutics.\n\nMethods: We recently developed an associative learning paradigm in which auditory stimuli elicit scalable intensities of defensive behavior in a context-dependent manner. We are using this conditioned flight paradigm to establish robust behavioral profiles of different fear states as well as investigations into the neurophysiological underpinnings of complex responding. Our hypothesis is that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) is a critical site that controls the intensity of defensive responses.\n\nWe are utilizing extracellular recordings in freely moving mice to record the activity patterns of CEA neuronal populations. We are also using a “phototagging” approach in which opsins are expressed in specific populations of genetically defined CEA neurons to allow for optogenetic identification of recorded neurons. These approaches allow us to obtain temporally precise correlations of neurophysiology with defined fear states, with a primary goal of identifying activity patterns that predict shifts in defensive responding.\n\nResults: To date, we have recorded 177 CEA neurons in 19 mice subjected to the conditioned flight paradigm. Approximately 20% of these units are response specifically to the footshock (the unconditioned stimulus, US), 50% are responsive to conditioned auditory stimuli (CSs), and 30% are unresponsive to either the US or CSs. Among the CS-responsive neurons, 30% respond to the cue that drives flight and 20% respond to the cue that drives freezing. There were also populations of neurons that were inhibited by each of the CSs. Among the US-responsive units, we found two main categories of response – transient ( < 3 s) and sustained ( > 3 s), with both populations containing subpopulations with excitatory or inhibitory responses.\n\nUsing the context-dependence of the flight paradigm, we have also tracked the activity of CeL-ON and CeL-OFF neurons in high and low fear states. We find that CeL-OFF neurons (n = 9) are strongly inhibited throughout the flight paradigm. Cel-ON neurons (n = 6), however, are excited during the CS eliciting freezing and inhibited by the CS inducing flight, but only in the flight context. Finally, using the phototagging approach in PKCδ-Cre mice, we found that 5/10 PKCδ neurons could be identified as CeL-OFF. These PKCδ + CeL-OFF neurons were neither excited nor inhibited during the conditioned flight paradigm.\n\nConclusions: The proposed experiments are providing vital information about the neurobiological basis of complex fear states. We are currently performing analyses aimed at identifying neuronal populations with activity that is predictive of switching between high and low fear states. We believe that this will build a foundation for identifying and verifying novel therapeutic targets aimed at improving understanding and treatment of the brain dysfunction underlying debilitating mental disorders that negatively affect the lives of millions.\n\nKeywords: Fear, Amygdala, Electrophysiology, Anxiety Disorders, Central Amygdala\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT13. Parallel Circuits From the Bed Nuclei of Stria Terminalis to the Lateral Hypothalamus Drive Opposing Emotional States\n\nWilliam Giardino*, Ada Eban-Rothschild, Daniel Christoffel, Shi-Bin Li, Robert Malenka, Luis de Lecea\n\nStanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States\n\nBackground: The mechanisms underlying aversion and reward are beginning to be uncovered, with substantial efforts focused on the intricate connectivity of the lateral hypothalamus (LH). LH neurons containing the neuropeptide hypocretin (Hcrt; orexin) modulate affective components of arousal, yet the precise synaptic inputs linking Hcrt-LH activity and emotional behavior remain to be fully defined. We set out to uncover how Hcrt-LH neurons respond to ethologically salient stimuli, generate hedonically-valenced behavioral states, and integrate diverse synaptic inputs from specific upstream cell types.\n\nMethods: Here, we used modified rabies monosynaptic input mapping to identify major sources of long-range input onto Hcrt-LH neurons originating from neuronal populations in the bed nuclei of stria terminalis (BNST; a heterogeneous structure of the extended amygdala). To functionally interrogate BNST-- > LH circuitry, we used viral, optical, chemogenetic, and slice electrophysiological methods for monitoring and manipulating neural activity with genetically-defined and pathway-specific resolution in mice.\n\nResults: Specifically, we characterized two non-overlapping and spatially-segregated GABAergic BNST cell groups that both exhibit axonal projections to the LH, but express distinct neuropeptide markers (corticotropin-releasing factor, Crf; and cholecystokinin, Cck). We found that Crf-BNST and Cck-BNST neurons provide differentially abundant synaptic inputs onto Hcrt-LH neurons, display discrete physiological responses to salient stimuli, drive opposite emotionally-valenced behaviors, are differentially required for appetitive behavioral approach, and receive synaptic inputs from unique upstream neural networks.\n\nConclusions: Together, the data provide an advanced model for how parallel genetically-defined BNST-- > LH pathways promote divergent emotional states via distinct connectivity patterns of circuit-specific neuronal subpopulations. Our novel findings suggest a mechanistic framework for BNST-- > LH circuit dysregulations in psychiatric disorders and will therefore be broadly relevant to the fields of neuroscience and mental health, as future studies will inform development of improved therapeutic approaches.\n\nKeywords: Lateral Hypothalamus, Extended Amygdala, Hypocretin, Orexin, CRF\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT14. Epigenetic Programming of Chromatin Accessibility by Stress During Puberty\n\nKathleen Morrison*, Tracy Bale\n\nUniversity of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: Adverse childhood experiences are one of the greatest predictors for affective disorder presentation for women. However, few animal models exist that address female-specific risk factors or unique periods across the lifespan. As the pubertal transition is marked by dynamic hormonal changes and ensuing reorganization of the brain, it represents a window of sex-specific vulnerability to adverse experiences. Periods of hormonal flux in the female lifespan, including pregnancy, exacerbate the risk for affective disturbances and promote stress dysregulation, a key feature of affective disorders. We have established a translationally relevant mouse model in which pubertal adversity leads to broad stress dysregulation in adulthood that is dependent upon hormonal status. Our previous work in humans and mice has shown that increases in allopregnanolone are necessary to produce the blunted HPA axis response in stressed females. Allopregnanolone likely acts on a reprogrammed GABA system within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), as RNA-Seq analysis of the PVN during pregnancy revealed alterations to GABA system gene expression by pubertal stress. However, it is unclear what is responsible for long-term reprogramming of the GABA system. Prior RNA-Seq also revealed that females stressed during puberty had increased expression of a host of immediate early genes at baseline during pregnancy. Immediate early gene expression requires that their promoters be accessible to the intracellular cascades that initiate their transcription. Therefore, we hypothesize that, even at baseline, the chromatin in the PVN of pubertally stressed females is in a more open, permissive state.\n\nMethods: Female mice were exposed to chronic variable stress from postnatal days 21-34. At 10-12 weeks old, females were sacrificed, either in virgin or pregnant state. Brains were frozen until the PVN could be extracted. PVN tissue was subject to ATAC-Sequencing, a technique which allows for the direct assessment of chromatin openness and interrogation of which genes are available for transcription, to assess pubertal stress-induced epigenetic programming.\n\nResults: ATAC-Seq signal intensity in the PVN was assessed for effects of pubertal stress and hormonal state, allowing for the identification of alterations to the chromatin accessibility landscape by pubertal stress, pregnancy, or requiring both. Rigorous quality analysis was done to account for factors such as duplicate reads and mitochondrial reads that can impact analysis.\n\nConclusions: Together, these studies support a role for long-term alterations in chromatin accessibility in the PVN in the stress dysregulation phenotype that is observed only in adult female mice that had both experienced stress during puberty and were pregnant. This translationally-relevant mouse model provides the opportunity to understand the molecular underpinnings of risk for stress dysregulation, a central endophenotype of affective disorders.\n\nKeywords: GABA, Allopregnanolone, Chromatin, ATAC-seq, Stress Models\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT15. Increase GABAergic Neurons in Brain Organoids Derived From Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder\n\nEunice Yuen*, Anahita Amiri, Noor Small, Cindy Nguyen, Flora Vaccarino\n\nYale Child Study Center, New Haven, Connecticut, United States\n\nBackground: Aberrant gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, is highly implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Aberrant gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, is highly implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, mechanisms are essentially unknown.\n\nMethods: To study the proposed questions, we reprogram fibroblasts that are terminally differentiated back to pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) allows the investigation of human neurodevelopment in vitro. The iPSCs are developed into three-dimensional organoids that resemble human brain tissue.\n\nResults: We found that control non-affected organoids show neuronal differentiation potential with cortical and cell type-specific markers and display functional voltage-gated channels and neuronal excitability. Moreover, qPCR and immunocytochemistry concomitantly suggest the increase of GABAergic neuronal markers in ASD organoids, such as DLX, vGAT and GAD67.\n\nConclusions: We conclude that there is an increased GABAergic neuronal fate in cortical organoids derived from children with ASD.\n\nKeywords: Autism, GABA, Brain Organoids\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT16. Neural Abnormalities During Successful and Failed Stopping in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Meta-Analysis Using Whole-Brain Statistical Parametric Maps\n\nLuke Norman*, Stephan F. Taylor, Claire L. Morrison, Joaquim Radua, Shivani A. Kaushal, Andre Chevrier, Catharina A. Hartman, Tieme W.P. Janssen, Steve Lukito, Isabelle Massat, Jaap Oosterlaan, Philippe Peigneux, Katya Rubia, Russell J. Schachar, Alexandre Sebastian, Philip Shaw, Gustavo Sudre, Oliver Tüscher, Daan van Rooij, Kate Fitzgerald\n\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States\n\nBackground: Patients with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often demonstrate abnormalities in brain functioning during tasks of inhibitory control. However, most individual neuroimaging studies have been small. Moreover, previous meta-analyses of functional magnetic imaging studies (fMRI) of inhibitory control in ADHD have the following limitations: (i) they have been based on peak-coordinates rather than whole-brain data; (ii) they have not considered behavioral performance; (iii) they have focused on between-group findings and have not observed within-group patterns of activation/deactivation; (iv) they have included data from different inhibitory tasks and used multiple contrasts; (v) and they did not examine both successful and failed inhibition. To overcome these limitations, we thus meta-analyzed whole-brain and task performance data from 10 studies that used the same probe of successful and failed inhibitory processes (the stop signal task).\n\nMethods: A preliminary meta-analysis (n = 834) was performed on 10 studies comparing patients with ADHD (n = 379; age range = 8-50, 269 males) and controls (n = 455; age range = 8-50, 273 males) on the stop signal task using event-related fMRI. Performance data was analyzed using a random-effects meta-analysis implemented in the Metafor package for R. Seed-based d Mapping was used to perform within-group and between-group fMRI meta-analyses based on whole-brain statistical parametric maps from the original studies. The examined contrasts were successful-stop > go and failed-stop > go. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018095365).\n\nResults: There was no significant group difference in mean stop signal reaction time (d = 0.24 p = .11). During successful stopping, patients with ADHD showed underactivation relative to controls in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)/orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left amygdala and bilateral thalamus/right caudate, but reduced deactivation relative to controls in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). During failed stopping, patients showed underactivation in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and left IFG/OFC/anterior insula, but reduced deactivation in PCC and bilateral putamen (all SDM-Z > 2, p < .005).\n\nConclusions: During both successful and failed stopping, patients with ADHD showed reduced activation in the predominantly left hemisphere salience network (SN) and reduced deactivation in posterior default mode network (DMN). The SN has been implicated in shifts between DMN and task positive networks that follow upon the detection of stimuli which indicate the need for greater externally focused attention and executive control. Thus, our central finding of greater DMN and reduced left SN activation provides further evidence that patients have deficits in performing dynamic adjustments between interoceptive and exteroceptive attention. In unaffected controls, deactivation within dopamine-innervated dorsal striatum during failed stopping has been hypothesized to represent a learning signal that guides improvements to future performance. Failures of deactivation within bilateral putamen in ADHD are therefore in line with recent suggestions of impaired dopaminergic functioning and prediction error signaling in the disorder.\n\nKeywords: ADHD, Response Inhibition, Functional MRI (fMRI), Stopping, Meta-Analysis\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT17. Neurocognitive Correlates of Resilience in Youth With a History of Traumatic Stress Exposure\n\nRan Barzilay*, Christeen Samuel, Monica Calkins, Tyler Moore, J. Cobb Scott, Raquel Gur, Ruben Gur\n\nChildren’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States\n\nBackground: Children and adolescents often grow up experiencing significant stress at a sensitive period of brain development. For some susceptible individuals, this stress exposure is associated with increased risk for mental health disorders, especially depression. Yet many individuals exposed to traumatic stress do not show significant psychopathology. These individuals are often characterized as resilient. Significant research has been dedicated to identifying risk factors and studying mechanisms of developmental psychopathology, but there is limited understanding of the mechanisms that underpin resilience in developing humans. We have recently reported detrimental clinical and cognitive correlates of childhood trauma exposure in the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). The PNC includes ~9,500 genotyped community youths (ages 8-21), some with significant trauma exposure, who have been robustly phenotyped for psychopathology and neurocognitive functioning. In this study, we aimed to identify neurocognitive measures that are associated with resilience in PNC youth.\n\nMethods: Traumatic stress exposure was assessed through screening of eight potentially traumatic events that include situations in which the participant (1) experienced a natural disaster; (2) experienced a bad accident; (3) thought that s/he or someone close to him/her could be killed or hurt badly; (4) witnessed someone getting killed, badly beaten, or die; (5) saw a dead body; or if s/he ever was a victim of one of the following assaults: (6) attacked or badly beaten, (7) threatened with a weapon, or (8) sexually forced (including but not limited to rape). Psychopathology was assessed using a mood-anxiety factor score, calculated using factor analysis of item-wise (i.e. symptom-level) psychopathology responses from clinical assessment. Neurocognitive functioning was evaluated by the 1-hour Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB). The CNB includes multiple tests assessing 4 cognitive domains: 1) executive function; 2) episodic memory; 3) complex reasoning; 4) social cognition. To identify correlates of resilience, we employed a 2 × 2 factorial design: high/low traumatic stress exposure; high/low psychopathology. Resilient individuals represent youths with high traumatic stress exposure and low psychopathology. Associations among trauma exposure, psychopathology, and their interaction (independent variables) with neurocognitive functioning (dependent variable) were studied using linear regression models controlling for age, sex, and socioeconomic status.\n\nResults: In youths with high traumatic stress exposure, those with low psychopathology (resilient, N = 732) showed superior overall cognitive efficiency compared to those with high psychopathology (N = 1595), while no such differences were observed comparing high and low psychopathology in low traumatic stress exposure individuals (exposure X psychopathology interaction t = 2.274, p = .023). Follow-up analyses to break down overall cognitive efficiency to specific cognitive domains revealed a similar pattern in complex reasoning efficiency (exposure X psychopathology interaction t = 2.168, p = .03), with no significant interactions in other cognitive domains.\n\nConclusions: Resilient youths who exhibit low mood-anxiety psychopathology in the face of high traumatic stress exposure show a distinct neurocognitive efficiency pattern that is characterized by superior complex reasoning, independent of sex, age, and socioeconomic status. While a cross-sectional design does not allow causal inference, results may shed light on specific cognitive mechanisms underpinning resilience.\n\nKeywords: Risk and Resilience, Childhood Trauma, Cognitive Functioning, Developmental Psychopathology\n\nDisclosure: Taliaz Health, Advisory Board, Taliaz Health, Stock / Equity\n\nT18. The Importance of Prefrontal Regions in Frustration Tolerance in Children With ADHD\n\nKaren Seymour*, Keri Rosch, Deana Crocetti, Kathryn Hirabayashi, Colleen Buckless, Stewart Mostofsky\n\nJohns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: Emotion dysregulation, particularly low frustration tolerance, is a key impairment in children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Observational and behavioral studies of frustration tolerance in children with ADHD have shown that compared to typically-developing (TD) children, children with ADHD show greater levels of frustration, are more likely to quit a frustrating task, exhibit greater attention to the negative aspects of a task and display less constructive patterns of emotional coping when frustrated. Taken together, this literature stresses the clinical importance of elucidating the mechanisms underlying poor frustration tolerance in children with ADHD.\n\nHowever, to date, few studies have examined the neural mechanisms of frustration in children with ADHD. Frustration has been theorized to involve: (1) core limbic and reward regions (amygdala [AMG], orbitofrontal cortex [OFC], ventral striatum) involved in the assessment of emotional/reward salience and generation of emotion responses; (2) frontal cortical (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC]) and dorsal striatal regions involved in the cognitive control of emotional responses, and (3) regions involved in the interface between emotional and cognitive control circuitry (medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC] and anterior cingulate cortex [ACC]).\n\nThe objective of this study is to examine the relationship between cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs) and frustration using a novel behavioral paradigm in children with ADHD with and without comorbidity compared to TD children.\n\nMethods: Participants included 102, 8-12 y.o. children: typically-developing controls (TD, n = 38), children diagnosed with DSM-5 ADHD (ADHD, n = 32) or children diagnosed with ADHD plus a comorbidity including Oppositional Defiant Disorder, anxiety or depressive disorders (Comorbid, n = 32).\n\nParticipants completed a novel Frustration Go/No Go paradigm with performance-based incentives delivered across three blocks including a “frustrative” second block involving 50% “rigged” Go trials in which the stimuli did not move to the target. To assess frustration during the task, participants completed affect ratings at four points (baseline and after each block).\n\nHigh resolution MPRAGE images were acquired for all participants. Frontal lobe volumes were extracted using an atlas developed by our Center and employed within FreeSurfer including: dlPFC, ACC, OFC, and mPFC. Subcortical volumes were extracted using a validated in-house pipeline and included: AMG, hippocampus, caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus. Left and right ROIs were averaged.\n\nGroups were compared on ROI volumes and brain-behavior correlations were conducted to examine the relationship between frustration exhibited during the task and ROI volumes. All analyses included age and Total Cerebral Volume (TCV) as covariates. Findings related to behavioral task performance and neuroimaging measures are not reported due to space limitations.\n\nResults: Behavioral results showed that across all participants, the task elicited frustration from baseline to the frustrative block, t(101) = -10.96, p ≤ .001; however, controlling for age, groups did not differ in change in frustration, F(2,98) = .219, p = .804\n\nControlling for age, groups differed in TCV, F(2,76) = 3.49, p = .035, such that the TDs had greater TCV compared to the Comorbid group (p = .05). Results of a MANCOVA examining all cortical ROI volumes revealed a significant multivariate main effect of Group, λ = .800, F(8,148) = 2.19, p = .032, due to reduced ACC volume in ADHD vs. TDC (p = .003) and reduced dlPFC volume in Comorbid vs. TDC (p = .093). For subcortical measures, the multivariate effect was not significant, λ = .833, F(10,146) = 1.40, p = .186; therefore, univariate tests were not examined.\n\nAcross all groups, partial correlations showed a significant negative association of dlPFC and mPFC volumes (respectively) with frustration at Baseline (r = -.245, p = .028; r = -.327, p = .003), after the frustrative block (r = -.246, p = .028; r = -.276, p = .013), and in change in frustration across the task (r = -.240, p = .032; r = -.255, p = .023). Further, partial correlations showed a significant positive relationship between baseline frustration and caudate volume (r = .234, p = .037).\n\nConclusions: Compared to TDCs, children with ADHD showed reduced volumes in prefrontal regions including the ACC and dlPFC. Moreover, on a novel frustration GNG task, reduced dlPFC and mPFC volumes and greater caudate volume were negatively associated with self-reported frustration suggesting the importance of neural circuitry involved in reward and cognitive control in frustration tolerance.\n\nKeywords: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Frustration Tolerance, Emotion Regulation, Affective Neuroscience, Irritability\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT19. Differences in Brain Structure and Functioning in Children With the FTO Obesity Risk Allele\n\nClaudia Lugo-Candelas*, Yajing Pang, Lisa Ranzenhofer, Rachel Korn, Haley Davis, Hailey McInerny, Janet Schebendach, Chung Wendy, Leibel Rudolph, Walsh B. Timothy, Jonathan Posner, Michael Rosenbaum, Laurel Mayer\n\nColumbia University Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York, United States\n\nBackground: The prevalence of obesity (defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 95th percentile) in the US is estimated at 39% in adults and 18% in youth, highlighting the need to identify risk factors (Hales et al. 2017). In recent years, polymorphisms in the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) have been associated with higher BMI and risk for obesity (Frayling et al. 2007). In the FTO gene, (intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1421085), CC and CT genotypes are considered at-risk genotypes compared to the TT genotype (Wang et al. 2013; Hudek et al. 2018; Albuquerque, Nóbrega, and Manco 2013). Whereas the mechanism underlying the association between FTO gene and obesity is not fully understood, individuals carrying risk alleles show higher food intake, regardless of BMI (Cecil et al. 2008; Wardle et al. 2008). As FTO is highly expressed throughout the brain, a growing body of literature has started to examine brain function and structure across FTO genotypes (McTaggart et al. 2011). Thus far, studies find volumetric reductions (Melka et al. 2013), differences in activation in response to food stimuli (Heni et al. 2014; Wiemerslage et al. 2016; Melhorn et al. 2018) and differences in connectivity in the default mode and salience networks (Olivo et al. 2016). However, studies have examined FTO genotype differences mostly in adult populations. Given that weight status has been shown to impact brain functioning (Doucet et al. 2018), the mechanisms leading to weight gain are better examined in children at risk for obesity, rather than in adults who are already overweight. The one existing child study supports a potential mechanistic role of brain function in the relation between FTO and weight gain, documenting stronger responses to food stimuli in regions involved in reward processing in risk allele carriers (Rapuano et al. 2017). However, the study sample had significant differences in BMI across FTO genotypes. We thus examined associations between FTO genotypes and brain structure and function in a sample of children with comparable BMIs.\n\nMethods: Saliva was collected and DNA was extracted using DNA Genotek™ kit. Children were genotyped for the C/T alleles at rs1421085 by the pyrosequencing (PSQ96 Biotage, LLC. Westborough, MA). PCR reactions consisted of 6 pmol of each of the appropriate forward and reverse primer, 0.75 U GoTaq, 1xGoTaq buffer, 0.2 mM dNTP’s and 50 ng of genomic DNA in a 30 μλ reaction volume for 35 cycles at an annealing temperature of 50°C. Genotype brain differences were examined in 93 children (15 with CC genotype, 31 with CT genotype, and 47 with TT genotype) ages 6-11 (mean age = 9.12 ± 1.17 years). Grey matter (GM) morphology, white matter (WM) fiber density, and resting-state functional connectivity (rsfMRI), were assessed using deformation-based GM morphometry, fixel-based morphometry (Raffelt et al. 2017), and seed-based analyses, respectively.\n\nResults: Age [F(2,90) = 0.38, p = 0.69], sex [χ2(2) = 0.37, p = 0.83], and BMI [F(2,90) = 0.47, p = 0.63] distributions did not vary across genotypes. GM morphology analyses demonstrated that C allele carriers showed significant GM volume expansions bilaterally in the cerebellum and temporal gyrus and in the right occipital cortex (whole brain corrected p < 0.05; adjusted for sex, age at scan, and BMI). Given these findings, we examined cerebral WM structural and functional connectivity. Fixel-based morphometry analyses showed a significant relationship between C alleles and increased WM fiber density in the inferior cerebellar peduncle tract (FWE corrected p < 0.05, adjusted for the aforementioned covariates). Finally, cerebellum seed-based rsfMRI analyses showed that C alleles predicted increased positive connectivity between the left cerebellum (lobule VI) and left superior frontal gyrus and right thalamus as well as increased negative connectivity between the cerebellum (Crus II) and the temporal fusiform cortex and lateral occipital cortex (thresholded at voxel level p < 0.001 (uncorrected) and at cluster level p < 0.05 (FDR corrected); adjusted for the aforementioned covariates).\n\nConclusions: In line with prior research, the present study suggests that the FTO gene may impact brain structure and functioning. We document that FTO genotype differences occur independently of BMI and can be detected during childhood. Our multimodal analyses suggest a prominent role for the cerebellum in FTO genotype differences. Animal and human studies document that the FTO gene is widely expressed in the cerebellum (Fredriksson et al. 2008) and a prior adult study found genotype by reward sensitivity interactions such that for homozygote risk allele carriers, higher punishment sensitivity was related to increased rsfMRI cerebellar activity (Olivo et al. 2016). Given the cerebellum’s role in reward based-learning (Thoma et al. 2008), and reports of increased cerebellar activity as a function of BMI (Park, Seo, and Park 2016), our results lend premilitary support to the hypothesis that FTO risk allele carriers may present atypical food-related learning and sensitivity, even prior to developing obesity and other adiposity-related conditions. However, further study is required to better elucidate the effects of the FTO genotypes on brain development, food intake, and obesity susceptibility.\n\nKeywords: Obesity, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FTO, Children\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT20. Developmental Origins of Adult Prefrontal Cortical Parvalbumin Interneuron Functional Dysconnectivity\n\nSarah Canetta*, Eric Teboul, Alan Brown, Christoph Kellendonk\n\nColumbia University, New York, New York, United States\n\nBackground: Abnormalities in prefrontal cortical parvalbumin-expressing (PFC PV) interneurons are believed to contribute to cognitive and affective deficits in schizophrenia (SCZ), as well as other neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about whether developmental alterations in PV inhibitory interneuron maturation and integration into cortical circuitry could be contributing to disease onset. We have recently shown that mice exposed to an early environmental risk factor for SCZ—prenatal maternal immune activation (MIA)—show decreased functional inhibitory connectivity between PFC PV interneurons and pyramidal cells in adulthood, and that these physiological changes result in impairments in cognitive flexibility and anxiety. Therefore, we decided to utilize this model to investigate changes in PFC PV interneuron function during development that may precede and precipitate these long-term functional and behavioral alterations observed in the adult.\n\nMethods: We used slice electrophysiology to record from PFC PV interneurons from MIA and control offspring at different time points during development and in adulthood. We then utilized a viral and genetic approach to express the pharmacogenetic receptor, hM4D, in developing PV interneurons and administered the agonist for hM4D, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), during the postnatal window (P14-P50) to mimic the physiological changes in excitability we observed in MIA offspring during development. Twenty-four hours following the end of this transient pharmacogenetically-induced reduction in excitability, we measured the strength of GABAergic connectivity in the PFC by recording spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents.\n\nResults: We discovered that PFC PV interneurons in MIA offspring show decreased intrinsic excitability transiently during early development, corresponding to a window during which extensive pruning of synaptic connections occurs. This change in excitability appears due to an increase in an inward conductance active around resting membrane potential and at more hyperpolarized potentials in PFC PV interneurons. Our pharmacogenetic studies reveal that transiently reducing the excitability of PFC PV interneurons early in development is sufficient to reduce the strength of functional GABAergic connectivity between these interneurons and pyramidal cells 24 h following normalization of PV interneuron excitability. Persistent effects on GABAergic connectivity in adulthood are also detected. Ongoing studies are examining the effects of this developmental manipulation on PFC PV interneuron-dependent behaviors such as attentional set-shifting and anxiety.\n\nConclusions: Our results indicate a sensitive developmental period during which alterations in PFC PV interneuron excitability are able to affect the strength of GABAergic functional connectivity, even after excitability has returned to normal. This may have consequences for establishing the strength of prefrontal GABAergic connectivity in adulthood as well as for prefrontal PV-dependent behaviors. From a therapeutic perspective, this may indicate a developmental period during which the brain would be particularly susceptible to interventions that engage the prefrontal cortex and thereby naturally enhance activity.\n\nKeywords: Parvalbumin Interneurons, Brain Development, Prefrontal Cortex, Excitability\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT21. Neural Coding of Explore-Exploit Decisions in Macaque Prefrontal Cortex\n\nVincent Costa*, Bruno Averbeck\n\nDivision Intramural Research Program, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: The explore-exploit dilemma describes agents’ decisions to forego immediate rewards and explore an unknown option, to learn if it is better than something they already experienced. Previous studies find that cortical regions encode exploratory choices when primates deviate from specified decision policies. However, without explicit task constraints it is difficult to tell if off policy-choices reflect exploration, decision noise, or poor learning. Novelty seeking is an evolved solution to the explore-exploit dilemma and of interest because it is computationally tractable.\n\nMethods: In the present study we combined high channel count single-unit recordings (768 electrodes; > 3000 neurons) from macaque prefrontal cortex (Area 9/46) with computational modeling of two monkeys’ behavior on a multi-arm bandit task. The monkeys learned to choose between three, probabilistically rewarded images. Periodically one of the choices was replaced with a novel image the monkey had not yet associated with reward. This induced an explore-exploit tradeoff, forcing the monkeys to either explore the novel option or exploit their existing knowledge about the two remaining familiar options. We used a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model to quantify the value of choosing each option based on the likelihood that choice would be rewarded on the current trial (immediate expected value) the overall richness of the reward environment (future expected value), and the relative difference in the total number of future rewards to be gained by choosing to explore or exploit novel versus familiar options (exploration bonus).\n\nResults: Prefrontal neurons encoded each of these value computations, however, there were key differences in when these value signals were encoded. We observed both tonic encoding of the immediate and future expected value of choices during the inter-trial interval, as well as phasic encoding of these values at the time of choice. Whereas, the exploration bonus tied to novelty seeking was only encoded after the monkeys chose to explore or exploit particular options. Prefrontal neurons also encoded the identity of the chosen stimulus and choice outcomes. This is important because the immediate expected value, stimulus identity, and outcome of choices defines the state and the state transition in the POMDP algorithm we used to derive choice values. Interestingly, choice location which was task irrelevant but important for action selection, was also strongly encoded.\n\nConclusions: Overall, these results suggest that prefrontal cortex is important in resolving uncertainty about the value of unexplored, novel options to efficiently manage the explore-exploit dilemma.\n\nKeywords: Reinforcement Learning, Prefrontal Cortex, Explore-Exploit Dilemma, Probabilistic Reward Learning, Computational Models Of Decision-Making\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT22. Contributions of Parallel Nigrostriatal Dopamine Circuits to Reward Learning and Habit Formation\n\nTalia Lerner*, Caitlin Cosme, Jillian Seiler\n\nNorthwestern Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, United States\n\nBackground: Habit formation, a process by which behavior becomes fluid and automatic, is an essential survival strategy in a complex world, freeing cognitive resources for other purposes. The process of habit formation depends on the striatum and inputs to the striatum from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Our recent work has shown that dopamine neurons in SNc are divisible by their efferent projections to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) or dorsolateral striatum (DLS), striatal subregions that play distinct roles in operant learning: the DMS mediates early goal-directed action-outcome learning, while the DLS mediates later habit formation. Now, we are asking whether changes in nigrostriatal dopamine circuits’ structure and function are altered by habit formation and how these different classes of efferent-defined dopamine neurons differentially contribute to reward learning and the transition to habit.\n\nMethods: To address the question of how nigrostriatal dopamine circuits change over the course of habit formation, we are using both optogenetic circuit mapping in ex vivo slices and in vivo fiber photometry recordings during behavior. We injected ChR2-YFP into either the DMS or DLS and red retrobeads into either the DMS or DLS. This preparation allows us to identify DMS-projecting or DLS-projecting dopamine neurons in ex vivo slices to target for our recordings. We can then stimulate ChR2-expressing axons with blue light and test the connectivity of the DMS and DLS onto these efferent-defined dopamine neuron populations. We are currently comparing the connectivity in mice that have been trained to form habits with cagemates that are similarly handled and food restructure, but untrained. For fiber photometry recordings, we injected DIO-GCaMP6s into the SNc of DAT-cre mice to express GCaMP6s in SNc dopamine neurons. Fiber optic implants were placed in both the DMS and DLS, allowing us to simultaneously measure the activity of dopaminergic axons in these two striatal subregions as mice trained on an operant task designed to elicit inflexible behavior. Since individual mice acquire habits are different rates, these experiments allow us to identify the dopaminergic circuit signatures of habit formation vs changes that are independent of habit formation. These preliminary experiments are ongoing, with statistical analyses forthcoming. Both sexes are being examined and we will test for sex-dependent effects in our analyses.\n\nResults: In our preliminary studies, we have observed selective alterations of striatal inputs onto DLS-projecting dopamine neurons following habit training. The strength of DMS inputs onto DLS-projecting dopamine neurons increases, whereas the strength of DLS inputs onto these neurons decreases. In our fiber photometry recordings, we have observed that dopamine signals in the DLS preferentially evolve over the course of habit training, in particular showing a prolonged increase in activity in response to salient events, independent of reward outcome.\n\nConclusions: So far, our preliminary results suggest that plasticity of inputs onto DLS-projecting dopamine neurons plays a key role in habit formation. Future experiments will address the timeline and mechanisms by which this plasticity occurs. We also plan interventional optogenetic experiments to test whether the timecourse of habit acquisition and consolidation can be altered via temporally precise manipulations of the DLS-projecting dopaminergic system.\n\nKeywords: Dopamine, Dorsal Striatum, Habit, Reward Learning, Optogenetics\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT23. Perimenstrual Exacerbation of Symptoms in Female Suicide Attempters With Current Ideation: Examining RDoC Mechanisms of Steroid Withdrawal in a Crossover Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nTory Eisenlohr-Moul*, Mitchell Prinstein, David Rubinow, Steven Young, Savannah Bowers, Susan Girdler\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States\n\nBackground: The perimenstrual weeks of the menstrual cycle (i.e., weeks before and during menses, when ovarian steroids 17β-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) fall rapidly), have been linked to suicide attempts and deaths. Our recently-completed crossover double-blind trial of perimenstrual E2/P4 stabilization in female outpatients with a history of suicide attempt (and current ideation) provides evidence that perimenstrual withdrawal from E2 and P4 causes increases in suicidality, which can be prevented using exogenous steroid stabilization. Now, candidate mechanisms require exploration. In preclinical models, ovarian steroid withdrawal provokes a variety of behavioral phenotypes (depression, impulsivity) related to affective and suicide risk. Using data collected during the trial referenced above, the present work examines candidate RDoC mediators of the observed therapeutic effect. We hypothesized that prevention of perimenstrual steroid withdrawal would prevent deterioration of RDoC systems known to influence acute suicidality, including loss, potential threat, reward processing, behavioral disinhibition, social affiliation and attachment, and disturbed sleep.\n\nMethods: Procedures were approved by the UNC Chapel Hill Ethics Board. In a crossover double-blind placebo-controlled trial, female participants (n = 25) with a history of suicide attempt and current ideation were recruited for a study on “the biology of depression and suicide” via social media. Participants completed two 14-day conditions in counterbalanced order: In the active condition, they were treated with 14 days (starting 7 days following positive urine LH test) of transdermal E2 (.1 mg/day) patches plus oral micronized P4 (200 mg) pills; in the other condition, they received identical placebos in the same perimenstrual timeframe. A washout cycle separated the conditions. Participants (ages 18-45) had normal BMI, no premenstrual dysphoric disorder (luteal phase symptom confinement), serious medical conditions, dysmenorrhea, pregnancy/breastfeeding, hormone use, or history of mania or psychosis.\n\nParticipants reported daily suicidality and indicators of loss (“I felt sad”, “I felt hopeless”), potential threat (“I felt anxious”, “I felt worried”), blunted reward processing (“I had little motivation or interest”, “I did not enjoy things”), cognitive/behavioral disinhibition (“I did something impulsive I regret”, “I acted without thinking”), impaired social affiliation and attachment (“I felt I did not belong with others”, “I felt I was a burden to others”, number of social interactions), and poor sleep (“I had trouble falling or staying asleep”, number of hours of sleep reported). Composites were calculated as the daily mean of within-person z-scores. Multilevel models were used to test hypotheses. Physical symptoms and medications were covaried.\n\nResults: All participants demonstrated a 30% perimenstrual exacerbation of at least one emotional symptom. suggesting high risk of cyclical exacerbation in this population. Serum measures across each condition confirmed that the manipulation extended the mid-luteal phase hormone profile, preventing E2/P4 withdrawal relative to perimenstrual steroid withdrawal under placebo. Blinding was successful, with no condition differences in condition beliefs (p = .58).\n\nConsistent with previously-reported beneficial effects on suicidality in this trial, we observed condition X phase interactions predicting composite outcomes related to loss (Estimate = -.74, SE = .25, t(905) = -2.96, p = .03), blunted reward processing (Estimate = -.60, SE = .24, t(902) = -2.50, p = .012), cognitive/behavioral disinhibition (Estimate = -.50, SE = .22, t(907) = -2.27, p = .023), impaired social affiliation (Estimate = -.48, SE = .11, t(905) = -4.36, p < .0001), and poor sleep (Estimate = -.84, SE = .20, t(905) = -4.20, p < .0001). During placebo, these outcomes worsened one to one-and-a-half person-standard-deviations from the midluteal to the perimenstrual week but showed no increase during stabilization. Further, there were significant condition X phase effects on these outcomes during the medication withdrawal week; delayed withdrawal from active E2/P4 caused a delayed increase in symptoms relative to midluteal baseline (not observed during placebo withdrawal). There were no significant condition or condition X phase effects on potential threat (Estimate = -.07, SE = .26, t(901) = -.26, p = .79).\n\nConclusions: In addition to exacerbating daily suicidality, ovarian steroid withdrawal (both natural perimenstrual and experimental withdrawal) provoked heightened sadness, hopelessness, anhedonia, impulsivity, social disconnection, and trouble sleeping in a sample of female suicide attempters with current suicidal ideation. Anxiety was not affected and may not be a key mechanism. Studies should probe whether disturbed sleep may represent a mechanism between steroid withdrawal and psychiatric symptoms.\n\nPerhaps due to shared risk factors, chronic suicidality in females seems to correlate with psychiatric sensitivity to perimenstrual steroid withdrawal. This withdrawal mechanism stands in contrast to those observed in premenstrual dysphoric disorder, where symptoms are triggered by post-ovulatory neurosteroid changes rather than perimenstrual steroid changes. Serum from the present study is currently being assayed to examine possible molecular mechanisms, such as GABAergic neurosteroid withdrawal.\n\nKeywords: Suicide, Gonadal Hormones, Sex Hormones, Women’s Mental Health, Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT24. Social Cognition Remediation for Bipolar Disorder - A Path to Better Clinical Outcomes\n\nAnna Van Meter*, Joel Stoddard\n\nThe Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Glen Oaks, New York, United States\n\nBackground: Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with poor emotion recognition (Samamé, 2013). Misinterpreting others’ emotions may exacerbate disordered mood; for people with BD, who tend to have a negative emotion bias, noticing and focusing on negative emotions in others may maintain depressed mood (Leppanen, 2006). This effect on mood could be due, in part, to the social functioning deficits associated with misinterpreting others’ emotions (Fulford et al, 2014; Michalak et al., 2006).\n\nThis emotion recognition deficit – and associated consequences – appear to be specific to faces; recently completed work by our group suggests that people with BD perform as well as others when asked to interpret emotional body language (Lee & Van Meter, 2018). Remediating the face emotion recognition deficit could (1) reduce depressed mood in people with BD, (2) improve social functioning, and (3) increase treatment engagement.\n\nPrevious research has indicated that a computer-based cognitive bias modification intervention designed to modify emotion perception biases may positively influence mood and behavior in depressed and aggressive individuals (Penton-Voak et al., 2012; 2013). Our goals are to determine whether this intervention can shift emotion processing biases in people with BD and demonstrate clinical benefits (lower depressed mood, improved social function, greater treatment engagement).\n\nMethods: Young adults (16-25) with BD were recruited for a three weekly sessions of Interpretation Bias Training (IBT), a computer-based intervention that trains sad/happy judgments of ambiguous face emotions on a linear morph continuum of faces between sad and happy (Penton-Voak et al., 2012). Active IBT targets negative emotion bias by training towards more happy judgments of ambiguous faces on the sad/happy continuum, relative to a person’s native bias. Feedback during sham IBT is consistent with a person’s native bias. Exclusion criteria were minimal. Participants were interviewed to assess eligibility and completed mood and social functioning self-reports. Participants were randomized to the active or sham condition. Two months after intervention sessions, emotion recognition, mood (General Behavior Inventory, (Depue, 1981), and social functioning (Perceived Social Support – Family and Friends (Procidano & Heller, 1983) were evaluated. Changes in treatment (start/stop medication or therapy) were also assessed to account for engagement.\n\nA small subset of participants (n = 7) in the active condition underwent neuroimaging pre- and post-intervention to assess within-person changes in neural activation during a separate emotion processing task (participants viewed faces exhibiting different emotions and were asked to identify the gender of the face).\n\nResults: Forty-three participants (average age 21.89, SD = 2.4, 70% female) completed at least one intervention session, 79% completed all four sessions. The most common subtype was BD I (n = 29) followed by BD II (n = 9). At baseline, 59% were in psychotherapy, 60% were currently taking medication for their BD. The active group had higher depression scores than the sham group (t = 2.30, p = .027), other measures were equivalent.\n\nThe negative emotion bias shifted more in the active than in the sham group (Cohen’s d = 1.49, p < .001), indicating the training was effective.\n\nIn a linear mixed model, with random intercepts for participant and a random slope for the measure of negative emotion bias, fixed effects for group (p = .027) and group-by-time (p = .031) were significant; the intervention group had a larger decrease in depressed mood from baseline to two-month follow-up. (p = .027). Related, the intervention group had a larger increase in perceived social support from family members (p = .011). There were no main effects for group, time, or their interaction on mania scores or treatment status (initiating medication or participating in psychotherapy).\n\nAmong those participants who underwent neuroimaging pre- and post-intervention, at baseline there was significant activation in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) when observing the emotional faces (happy, sad). Following the intervention, there was no significant activation in this area.\n\nConclusions: A computer-based cognitive bias intervention shifted emotion perception in people with BD, which may have contributed to decreased depression scores and the perception of greater familial support, consistent with the “virtuous cycle” theory that seeing others’ emotions more positively can lead to enhanced interactions and improved mood (Penton-Voak, 2012; Penton-Voak et al., 2013). A reduction in DMPFC response after intervention provides preliminary support for it as a neural treatment target and is consistent with its role in emotion regulation, identification, and learning (Bakker et al., 2015).\n\nThese results converge with prior work demonstrating IBT may reduce depressed mood in healthy individuals (Penton-Voak et al., 2012). On average, people with BD spend more time depressed than manic, and depressed mood tends to be more difficult to treat (Baldessarini et al., 2010; Van Meter et al., 2013). The results of this study suggest that cognitive remediation could augment treatment with medication and/or therapy targeting BD depression through emotion processing and social pathways. Importantly, this computer-based intervention can be more easily disseminated, at lower cost, than traditional interventions, creating an opportunity to benefit under-served populations.\n\nKeywords: Bipolar Disorder, Social Cognition, Non-Pharmacological Interventions, Mobile Health\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT25. Using Resting State Intrinsic Network Connectivity to Identify Suicide Risk in Mood Disorders\n\nJonathan Stange*, Lisanne Jenkins, Stephanie Pocius, Kayla Kreutzer, Katie Bessette, Sophie DelDonno, Leah Kling, Runa Bhaumik, John Keilp, K. Luan Phan, Scott Langenecker\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States\n\nBackground: Little is known about the neural substrates of suicide risk in mood disorders. Improving the identification of biomarkers of suicide risk in mood disorders could lead to more targeted treatments to reduce risk. The aim of this study was to use resting-state intrinsic network connectivity to identify individuals at risk for suicide, as indicated by a history of suicide-related behavior (SB).\n\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at two urban communities with medical centers. Resting-state functional connectivity was examined within intrinsic networks, including the cognitive control network (CCN), a system involving frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks that is critical for problem-solving and executive functioning; the salience and emotional network (SEN), which is active in response to stimuli relevant to current goals, including emotional stimuli, and involves limbic and ventral attention networks; and the default mode network (DMN), which is active during self-focused thought and when not engaged with external stimuli. Two fMRI scans were conducted approximately two months apart to examine stability and reliability of group differences over time. Participants (Mean age = 21.88, SD = 2.70; 67% female) were 112 individuals with a mood disorder with no history of suicide-related behavior (NSB), 18 young adults with a mood disorder who had a history of SB (as indicated by endorsing a past suicide attempt), and 82 healthy comparison participants (HC). Strength of resting-state connectivity of intrinsic networks was compared between SB, NSB, and HC groups.\n\nResults: Several regions (k > 57, p < .005) were identified in the three networks in connectivity to fronto-parietal regions, including right middle and inferior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, that were significantly different in SB relative to NSB and HC groups for both within-network connectivity (in the CCN) and cross-network connectivity (DMN-CCN and DMN-SEN). Furthermore, deficits in connectivity (exhibited by the SB group) between the right middle frontal gyrus and the CCN were associated with poorer inhibitory control on a behavioral go/no-go task, and deficits in connectivity between the right middle frontal gyrus and DMN were associated with higher levels of self-reported rumination. Intrinsic network connectivity effects were stable over time and identified group membership with good accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nConclusions: These results suggest that individuals with a history of SB may show distinct patterns of intrinsic network connectivity, even when compared to those with mood disorders and no history of SB. These deficits may underlie candidate behavioral risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior, including rumination and inhibitory control deficits. Resting-state fMRI may serve as a promising tool for identifying subtypes of patients with mood disorders who are at risk for suicidal behavior.\n\nKeywords: Suicide, Resting-State fMRI, Depression, Intrinsic Connectivity, Cognitive Control Network\n\nDisclosure: NIMH, Grant, BBRF, Grant\n\nT26.
