        "text": "Gladiators’ American guard, David Sloan, has been listed in the British Basketball League Team of the Year. He had an impressive rookie campaign, proving to be one of the best guards in the league, and one of the top young players.\n\nUndoubtedly, Sloan’s top moment was the corner 3-pointer that sealed the BBL Trophy for Gladiators in an end-to-end battle with Cheshire Phoenix which went down to the final possession – finishing 73-70. He provided an unforgettable moment for all Gladiators fans, new and old, in the franchise’s first season since rebranding from Glasgow Rocks.\n\nIn BBL Championship action, the rookie out of East Tennessee State University averaged 17.9 PPG (5th in the league) and 4.9 APG (6th in the league) in an outstanding campaign. His season high in points came near the start of the season, when in an away trip to Bristol, he dropped 37 points on the Flyers in a huge 71-93 win.\n\nSloan was a huge part of the Scottish side’s success this season in all competitions, reaching fourth place in the Championship. He remained a starter throughout the majority of fixtures, playing solid minutes and contributing great numbers.\n\nThe American was selected alongside Lions’ Sam Dekker, VJ King of Flyers, and the Giants duo of Dirk Williams and Tajh Green.\n\nSpeaking on his season, David Sloan said: “I think the season went great for myself in my first year as a professional, despite a lot of changes throughout the season I feel like I stayed consistent and showed I was capable. The game winning shot is a moment I’ll never forget and it will live with me throughout my life, it’s a story I’ll forever enjoy telling others.”\n\nHead Coach Gareth Murray added: “David established himself as one of the best young scorers in the league. As a rookie, he came in with a high level of confidence, and I’m pleased that his hard work has been recognized this season.”"
