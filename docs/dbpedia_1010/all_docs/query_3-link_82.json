        "meta_description": "Abstract. Greenspaces within broader ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction\n(Eco-DRR) strategies provide multiple benefits to society, biodiversity, and\naddressing climate breakdown. In this study, we investigated urban growth,\nits intersection with hazards, and the availability of greenspace for\ndisaster risk reduction (DRR) in the city of Quito, Ecuador, which\nexperiences multiple hazards including landslides, floods, volcanoes, and\nearthquakes. We used satellite data to quantify urban sprawl and developed a\nworkflow incorporating high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) to\nidentify potential greenspaces for emergency refuge accommodation (DRR\ngreenspace), for example, following an earthquake. Quito's historical urban\ngrowth totalled â¼â192âkm2 for 1986â2020 and was primarily on\nflatter land, in some cases crossed by steep ravines. By contrast, future\nprojections indicate an increasing intersection between easterly\nurbanisation and steep areas of high landslide susceptibility. Therefore, a\ntimely opportunity exists for future risk-informed planning. Our workflow\nidentified 18.6âkm2 of DRR greenspaces, of which 16.3âkm2\nintersected with potential sources of landslide and flood hazards,\nindicating that hazard events could impact potential âsafe spacesâ. These\nspaces could mitigate future risk if designated as greenspaces and left\nundeveloped. DRR greenspace overlapped 7â% (2.5âkm2) with\nmunicipality-designated greenspace. Similarly, 10â% (1.7âkm2) of\nmunicipality-designated âsafe spaceâ for use following an earthquake was\nclassified as potentially DRR suitable in our analysis. For emergency\nrefuge, currently designated greenspaces could accommodate â¼â2â%â14â% (depending on space requirements) of Quito's population within 800âm. This increases to 8â%â40â% considering all the potential DRR greenspace\nmapped in this study. Therefore, a gap exists between the provision of DRR\nand designated greenspace. Within Quito, we found a disparity between access\nto greenspaces across socio-economic groups, with lower income groups having\nless access and further to travel to designated greenspaces. Notably, the\naccessibility of greenspaces was high overall with 98â% (2.3Â million) of\nQuito's population within 800âm of a designated greenspace, of which 88â%\n(2.1Â million) had access to potential DRR greenspaces. Our workflow\ndemonstrates a citywide evaluation of DRR greenspace potential and provides\nthe foundation upon which to evaluate these spaces with local stakeholders.\nPromoting equitable access to greenspaces, communicating their multiple\nbenefits, and considering their use to restrict propagating development into\nhazardous areas are key themes that emerge for further investigation.",

Our results show that proglacial lakes are a main contributor to recent lake evolution in HMA, accounting for 62.87 % (56.67 km2) of the total area increase. Regional geographic variability of debris cover, together with trends in warming and precipitation over the past few decades, largely explains the current distribution of supra- and proglacial lake area.\n\nGlacial and geomorphic effects of a supraglacial lake drainage and outburst event, Everest region, Nepal Himalaya\n\nEvan S.

Elliott, Vitor Silva, MabÃ© Vilar-Vega, and Deborah Kane\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 1533–1555, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-1533-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-1533-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany of the rapidly expanding cities around the world are located near active tectonic faults that have not produced an earthquake in recent memory. But these faults are generally small, and so most previous seismic-hazard analysis has focussed on large, more distant faults. In this paper we show that a moderate-size earthquake on a fault close to the city of Santiago in Chile has a greater impact on the city than a great earthquake on the tectonic boundary in the ocean, about a 100 km away.\n\nGlacial and geomorphic effects of a supraglacial lake drainage and outburst event, Everest region, Nepal Himalaya\n\nEvan S.

To assess their potential impact and design mitigation solutions, a detailed understanding of the slope is required. We tested if the use of machine learning, combined with satellite remote sensing data, would allow us to forecast deformation. Our results on the Vögelsberg landslide, a deep-seated landslide near Innsbruck, Austria, show that the formulation of such a machine learning system is not as straightforward as often hoped for.\n\nFixed photogrammetric systems for natural hazard monitoring with high spatio-temporal resolution\n\nXabier Blanch, Marta Guinau, Anette Eltner, and Antonio Abellan\n\nNat.

The paper outlines the components, assembly, and programming codes required. The systems utilize prime cameras to generate 3D models and offer comparable performance to lidar for change detection monitoring. Real-world applications highlight their potential in geohazard monitoring which enables accurate detection of pre-failure deformation and rockfalls with a high temporal resolution.\n\nA neural network model for automated prediction of avalanche danger level\n\nVipasana Sharma, Sushil Kumar, and Rama Sushil\n\nNat.

This threat can be reduced by accurate prediction of the danger levels. The development of mathematical models based on past data and present conditions can help to improve the accuracy of prediction. This research aims to develop a neural-network-based model for correlating complex relationships between the meteorological variables and the profile variables.\n\nBrief communication: Landslide activity on the Argentinian Santa Cruz River mega dam works confirmed by PSI DInSAR\n\nGuillermo Tamburini-Beliveau, SebastiÃ¡n Balbarani, and Oriol Monserrat\n\nNat.

This allowed us to assess the integrity of the construction, providing a new and independent dataset. We have been able to identify ground deformation trends that put the construction works at risk.\n\nExploiting radar polarimetry for nowcasting thunderstorm hazards using deep learning\n\nNathalie Rombeek, Jussi Leinonen, and Ulrich Hamann\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-551,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-551, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSevere weather, such as hail, lightning and heavy rainfall can be hazardous to humans and property. Dual-polarization weather radars provide crucial information to forecast these events by detecting precipitation types. This study analyzes the importance of dual-polarization data for predicting severe weather during the next 60 min using an existing deep learning model. The results indicate that including these variables improves the accuracy of predicting heavy rainfall and lightning.\n\nInform@Risk.

A living lab sought to develop an integrated EWS in a landslide exposed neighborhood in Medellín. Findings indicate that technical aspects can be manageable, lesser social and political dynamics. A resilient EWS for informal settlements has to achieve sufficient social and technical redundancy to maintain basic functionality in a reduced support scenario.\n\nImpact of topography on in situ soil wetness measurements for regional landslide early warning â a case study from the Swiss Alpine Foreland\n\nAdrian Wicki, Peter Lehmann, Christian Hauck, and Manfred StÃ¤hli\n\nNat.

Here, we assessed the ability of monitoring sites at flat locations to detect critically saturated conditions compared to if they were situated at a landslide-prone location. We found that differences exist but that both sites could equally well distinguish critical from non-critical conditions for shallow landslide triggering if relative changes are considered.\n\nEarthquake building damage detection based on synthetic-aperture-radar imagery and machine learning\n\nAnirudh Rao, Jungkyo Jung, Vitor Silva, Giuseppe Molinario, and Sang-Ho Yun\n\nNat.

Information on locations and extent of past erosion can help anticipate where erosion might occur in the upcoming monsoon season and to take preventive measures. In our study, we show how time series of radar satellite imagery can be used to retrieve information on past erosion events shortly after the monsoon season using a novel interactive online tool based on the Google Earth Engine.\n\nQuantifying unequal urban resilience to rainfall across China from location-aware big data\n\nJiale Qian, Yunyan Du, Jiawei Yi, Fuyuan Liang, Nan Wang, Ting Ma, and Tao Pei\n\nNat.

However, urban resilience varies significantly by region. The northwestern arid region and the central underdeveloped areas are very fragile, and even low-intensity rains can trigger significant human activity anomalies. By contrast, even high-intensity rains might not affect residents in the southeast.\n\nComparison of machine learning techniques for reservoir outflow forecasting\n\nOrlando GarcÃ­a-Feal, JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez-Cao, Diego FernÃ¡ndez-NÃ³voa, Gonzalo Astray Dopazo, and Moncho GÃ³mez-Gesteira\n\nNat.

This study analyzes the efficiency of different machine learning techniques to predict reservoir outflow. The results obtained showed that the proposed models provided a good estimation of the outflow of the reservoirs, improving the results obtained with classical approaches.\n\nDevelopment of black ice prediction model using GIS-based multi-sensor model validation\n\nSeok Bum Hong, Hong Sik Yun, Sang Guk Yum, Seung Yeop Ryu, In Seong Jeong, and Jisung Kim\n\nNat.

Using spatial and meteorological data from the study area (Suncheon–Wanju Highway in Gurye-gun), the amount and location of black ice were modelled based on system dynamics to predict black ice and then simulated with the geographic information system (m2). Based on the model results, multiple sensors were buried at four selected points in the study area, and the model was compared with sensor data.\n\nForecasting vegetation condition with a Bayesian auto-regressive distributed lagsÂ (BARDL) model\n\nEdward E.

Using historical information from precipitation, soil moisture, and vegetation health data, we developed a model that can forecast vegetation condition and the probability of drought occurrence up till a 10-week lead time with an accuracy of 74 %. Our model can be adopted by policymakers and relief agencies for drought early warning and early action.\n\nA dynamic hierarchical Bayesian approach for forecasting vegetation condition\n\nEdward E. Salakpi, Peter D. Hurley, James M. Muthoka, Andrew Bowell, Seb Oliver, and Pedram Rowhani\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2725–2749, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2725-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2725-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe impact of drought may vary in a given region depending on whether it is dominated by trees, grasslands, or croplands. The differences in impact can also be the agro-ecological zones within the region. This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) for forecasting vegetation condition in spatially diverse areas. Compared to a non-hierarchical model, the HBM proved to be a more natural method for forecasting drought in areas with different land covers and agro-ecological zones.\n\nUsing a single remote-sensing image to calculate the height of a landslide dam and the maximum volume of a lake\n\nWeijie Zou, Yi Zhou, Shixin Wang, Futao Wang, Litao Wang, Qing Zhao, Wenliang Liu, Jinfeng Zhu, Yibing Xiong, Zhenqing Wang, and Gang Qin\n\nNat.

We have proposed a procedure to calculate the key parameters of these dams that uses only a single remote-sensing image and a pre-landslide DEM combined with landslide theory. The core of this study is a modeling problem. We have found the bridge between the theory of landslide dams and the requirements of disaster relief.\n\nGridded flood depth estimates from satellite-derived inundations\n\nSeth Bryant, Heather McGrath, and Mathieu Boudreault\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 1437–1450, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-1437-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-1437-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe advent of new satellite technologies improves our ability to study floods. While the depth of water at flooded buildings is generally the most important variable for flood researchers, extracting this accurately from satellite data is challenging. The software tool presented here accomplishes this, and tests show the tool is more accurate than competing tools. This achievement unlocks more detailed studies of past floods and improves our ability to plan for and mitigate disasters.\n\nProbFire: a probabilistic fire early warning system for Indonesia\n\nTadas Nikonovas, Allan Spessa, Stefan H.

Sci., 22, 303–322, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-303-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-303-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExtreme fire episodes in Indonesia emit large amounts of greenhouse gasses and have negative effects on human health in the region. In this study we show that such burning events can be predicted several months in advance in large parts of Indonesia using existing seasonal climate forecasts and forest cover change datasets. A reliable early fire warning system would enable local agencies to prepare and mitigate the worst of the effects.\n\nIndex establishment and capability evaluation of spaceâairâground remote sensing cooperation in geohazard emergency response\n\nYahong Liu and Jin Zhang\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 227–244, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-227-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-227-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThrough a comprehensive analysis of the current remote sensing technology resources, this paper establishes the database to realize the unified management of heterogeneous sensor resources and proposes a capability evaluation method of remote sensing cooperative technology in geohazard emergencies, providing a decision-making basis for the establishment of remote sensing cooperative observations in geohazard emergencies.\n\nBrief communication: Monitoring a soft-rock coastal cliff using webcams and strain sensors\n\nDiego Guenzi, Danilo Godone, Paolo Allasia, Nunzio Luciano Fazio, Michele Perrotti, and Piernicola Lollino\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 207–212, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-207-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-207-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the Apulia region (southeastern Italy) we are monitoring a soft-rock coastal cliff using webcams and strain sensors. In this urban and touristic area, coastal recession is extremely rapid and rockfalls are very frequent. In our work we are using low-cost and open-source hardware and software, trying to correlate both meteorological information with measures obtained from crack meters and webcams, aiming to recognize potential precursor signals that could be triggered by instability phenomena.\n\nMultiscale analysis of surface roughness for the improvement of natural hazard modelling\n\nNatalie BroÅ¾ovÃ¡, Tommaso Baggio, Vincenzo D'Agostino, Yves BÃ¼hler, and Peter Bebi\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 3539–3562, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-3539-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-3539-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSurface roughness plays a great role in natural hazard processes but is not always well implemented in natural hazard modelling. The results of our study show how surface roughness can be useful in representing vegetation and ground structures, which are currently underrated. By including surface roughness in natural hazard modelling, we could better illustrate the processes and thus improve hazard mapping, which is crucial for infrastructure and settlement planning in mountainous areas.\n\nEUNADICS-AV early warning system dedicated to supporting aviation in the case of a crisis from natural airborne hazards and radionuclide clouds\n\nHugues Brenot, Nicolas Theys, Lieven Clarisse, Jeroen van Gent, Daniel R. Hurtmans, Sophie Vandenbussche, Nikolaos Papagiannopoulos, Lucia Mona, Timo Virtanen, Andreas Uppstu, Mikhail Sofiev, Luca Bugliaro, Margarita VÃ¡zquez-Navarro, Pascal Hedelt, Michelle Maree Parks, Sara Barsotti, Mauro Coltelli, William Moreland, Simona Scollo, Giuseppe Salerno, Delia Arnold-Arias, Marcus Hirtl, Tuomas Peltonen, Juhani Lahtinen, Klaus Sievers, Florian Lipok, Rolf RÃ¼fenacht, Alexander Haefele, Maxime Hervo, Saskia Wagenaar, Wim Som de Cerff, Jos de Laat, Arnoud Apituley, Piet Stammes, Quentin Laffineur, Andy Delcloo, Robertson Lennart, Carl-Herbert Rokitansky, Arturo Vargas, Markus Kerschbaum, Christian Resch, Raimund Zopp, Matthieu Plu, Vincent-Henri Peuch, Michel Van Roozendael, and Gerhard Wotawa\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 3367–3405, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-3367-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-3367-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe purpose of the EUNADICS-AV (European Natural Airborne Disaster Information and Coordination System for Aviation) prototype early warning system (EWS) is to develop the combined use of harmonised data products from satellite, ground-based and in situ instruments to produce alerts of airborne hazards (volcanic, dust, smoke and radionuclide clouds), satisfying the requirement of aviation air traffic management (ATM) stakeholders (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/723986).\n\nAre sirens effective tools to alert the population in France?\n\nJohnny Douvinet, Anna Serra-Llobet, Esteban Bopp, and G. Mathias Kondolf\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 2899–2920, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2899-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2899-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study proposes to combine results of research regarding the spatial inequalities due to the siren coverage, the political dilemma of siren activation, and the social problem of siren awareness and trust for people in France. Surveys were conducted using a range of complementary methods (GIS analysis, statistical analysis, questionnaires, interviews) through different scales. Results show that siren coverage in France is often determined by population density but not risks or disasters.\n\nUAV survey method to monitor and analyze geological hazards: the case study of the mud volcano of Villaggio Santa Barbara, Caltanissetta (Sicily)\n\nFabio Brighenti, Francesco Carnemolla, Danilo Messina, and Giorgio De Guidi\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 2881–2898, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2881-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2881-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper we propose a methodology to mitigate hazard in a natural environment in an urbanized context. The deformation of the ground is a precursor of paroxysms in mud volcanoes. Therefore, through the analysis of the deformation supported by a statistical approach, this methodology was tested to reduce the hazard around the mud volcano. In the future, the goal is that this dangerous area will become both a naturalistic heritage and a source of development for the community of the area.\n\nTimely prediction potential of landslide early warning systems with multispectral remote sensing: a conceptual approach tested in the Sattelkar, Austria\n\nDoris Hermle, Markus Keuschnig, Ingo Hartmeyer, Robert Delleske, and Michael Krautblatter\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 2753–2772, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2753-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2753-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMultispectral remote sensing imagery enables landslide detection and monitoring, but its applicability to time-critical early warning is rarely studied. We present a concept to operationalise its use for landslide early warning, aiming to extend lead time. We tested PlanetScope and unmanned aerial system images on a complex mass movement and compared processing times to historic benchmarks. Acquired data are within the forecasting window, indicating the feasibility for landslide early warning.\n\nCHILDA â Czech Historical Landslide Database\n\nMichal BÃ­l, Pavel RaÅ¡ka, LukÃ¡Å¡ DolÃ¡k, and Jan KubeÄek\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 2581–2596, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2581-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2581-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe online landslide database CHILDA (Czech Historical Landslide Database) summarises information about landslides which occurred in the area of Czechia (the Czech Republic). The database is freely accessible via the https://childa.cz/ website. It includes 699 records (spanning the period of 1132–1989). Overall, 55 % of all recorded landslide events occurred only within 15 years of the extreme landslide incidence.\n\nReview article: Detection of actionable tweets in crisis events\n\nAnna Kruspe, Jens Kersten, and Friederike Klan\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 1825–1845, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1825-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1825-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMessages on social media can be an important source of information during crisis situations. This article reviews approaches for the reliable detection of informative messages in a flood of data. We demonstrate the varying goals of these approaches and present existing data sets. We then compare approaches based (1) on keyword and location filtering, (2) on crowdsourcing, and (3) on machine learning. We also point out challenges and suggest future research.\n\nLong-term magnetic anomalies and their possible relationship to the latest greater Chilean earthquakes in the context of the seismo-electromagnetic theory\n\nEnrique Guillermo Cordaro, Patricio Venegas-Aravena, and David Laroze\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 1785–1806, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1785-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1785-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a methodology that generates free externally disturbed magnetic variations in ground magnetometers close to the Chilean convergent margin. Spectral analysis (~ mHz) and magnetic anomalies increased prior to large Chilean earthquakes (Maule 2010, Mw 8.8; Iquique 2014, Mw 8.2; Illapel 2015, Mw 8.3). These findings relate to microcracks within the lithosphere due to stress state changes. This physical evidence should be thought of as a last stage of the earthquake preparation process.\n\nHazMapper: a global open-source natural hazard mapping application in Google Earth Engine\n\nCorey M. Scheip and Karl W. Wegmann\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 1495–1511, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1495-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1495-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor many decades, natural disasters have been monitored by trained analysts using multiple satellite images to observe landscape change. This approach is incredibly useful, but our new tool, HazMapper, offers researchers and the scientifically curious public a web-accessible cloud-based tool to perform similar analysis. We intend for the tool to both be used in scientific research and provide rapid response to global natural disasters like landslides, wildfires, and volcanic eruptions.\n\nOpportunities and risks of disaster data from social media: a systematic review of incident information\n\nMatti Wiegmann, Jens Kersten, Hansi Senaratne, Martin Potthast, Friederike Klan, and Benno Stein\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 1431–1444, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1431-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1431-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we study when social media is an adequate source to find metadata about incidents that cannot be acquired by traditional means. We identify six major use cases: impact assessment and verification of model predictions, narrative generation, recruiting citizen volunteers, supporting weakly institutionalized areas, narrowing surveillance areas, and reporting triggers for periodical surveillance.\n\nOnline urban-waterlogging monitoring based on a recurrent neural network for classification of microblogging text\n\nHui Liu, Ya Hao, Wenhao Zhang, Hanyue Zhang, Fei Gao, and Jinping Tong\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 1179–1194, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1179-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1179-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe trained a recurrent neural network model to classify microblogging posts related to urban waterlogging and establish an online monitoring system of urban waterlogging caused by flood disasters. We manually curated more than 4400 waterlogging posts to train the RNN model so that it can precisely identify waterlogging-related posts of Sina Weibo to timely determine urban waterlogging.\n\nPredicting power outages caused by extratropical storms\n\nRoope Tervo, Ilona LÃ¡ng, Alexander Jung, and Antti MÃ¤kelÃ¤\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 607–627, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-607-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-607-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPredicting the number of power outages caused by extratropical storms is a key challenge for power grid operators. We introduce a novel method to predict the storm severity for the power grid employing ERA5 reanalysis data combined with a forest inventory. The storms are first identified from the data and then classified using several machine-learning methods. While there is plenty of room to improve, the results are already usable, with support vector classifier providing the best performance.\n\nNear-real-time automated classification of seismic signals of slope failures with continuous random forests\n\nMichaela Wenner, ClÃ©ment Hibert, Alec van Herwijnen, Lorenz Meier, and Fabian Walter\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 339–361, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-339-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-339-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMass movements constitute a risk to property and human life. In this study we use machine learning to automatically detect and classify slope failure events using ground vibrations. We explore the influence of non-ideal though commonly encountered conditions: poor network coverage, small number of events, and low signal-to-noise ratios. Our approach enables us to detect the occurrence of rare events of high interest in a large data set of more than a million windowed seismic signals.\n\nAssessing the accuracy of remotely sensed fire datasets across the southwestern Mediterranean Basin\n\nLuiz Felipe Galizia, Thomas Curt, Renaud Barbero, and Marcos Rodrigues\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 73–86, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-73-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-73-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper aims to provide a quantitative evaluation of three remotely sensed fire datasets which have recently emerged as an important resource to improve our understanding of fire regimes. Our findings suggest that remotely sensed fire datasets can be used to proxy variations in fire activity on monthly and annual timescales; however, caution is advised when drawing information from smaller fires (< 100 ha) across the Mediterranean region.\n\nResponses to severe weather warnings and affective decision-making\n\nPhilippe Weyrich, Anna Scolobig, Florian Walther, and Anthony Patt\n\nNat.

The datasets incorporate various variables of ï¬ood hazard, exposure, vulnerability and direct tangible damage at properties from several economic sectors. This paper presents HOWAS 21 and highlights exemplary analyses to demonstrate the use of HOWAS 21 flood damage data.\n\nA spaceborne SAR-based procedure to support the detection of landslides\n\nGiuseppe Esposito, Ivan Marchesini, Alessandro Cesare Mondini, Paola Reichenbach, Mauro Rossi, and Simone Sterlacchini\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 2379–2395, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-2379-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-2379-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this article, we present an automatic processing chain aimed to support the detection of landslides that induce sharp land cover changes. The chain exploits free software and spaceborne SAR data, allowing the systematic monitoring of wide mountainous regions exposed to mass movements. In the test site, we verified a general accordance between the spatial distribution of seismically induced landslides and the detected land cover changes, demonstrating its potential use in emergency management.\n\nGIS-based DRASTIC and composite DRASTIC indices for assessing groundwater vulnerability in the Baghin aquifer, Kerman, Iran\n\nMohammad Malakootian and Majid Nozari\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 2351–2363, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-2351-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-2351-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe present study estimated the Kerman–Baghin aquifer vulnerability using DRASTIC and âcomposite DRASTIC (CDRASTIC) indices with the aid of geographic information system (GIS) techniques. The aquifer vulnerability maps indicated very similar results, âidentifying the north-west parts of the aquifer as areas with high to very high vulnerability. According to the results, parts of the studied aquifer have a high vulnerability and ârequire protective measures.\n\nReview article: The spatial dimension in the assessment of urban socio-economic vulnerability related to geohazards\n\nDiana Contreras, Alondra Chamorro, and Sean Wilkinson\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 1663–1687, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-1663-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-1663-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe socio-economic condition of the population determines their vulnerability to earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, landslides, soil erosion and land degradation. This condition is estimated mainly from population censuses. The lack to access to basic services, proximity to hazard zones, poverty and population density highly influence the vulnerability of communities. Mapping the location of this vulnerable population makes it possible to prevent and mitigate their risk.\n\nDesign and implementation of a mobile device app for network-based earthquake early warning systems (EEWSs): application to the PRESTo EEWS in southern Italy\n\nSimona Colombelli, Francesco Carotenuto, Luca Elia, and Aldo Zollo\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

The app represents a powerful tool for informing in real time a wide audience of end users and stakeholders about the potential damaging shaking in the occurrence of an earthquake.\n\nCCAF-DB: the Caribbean and Central American active fault database\n\nRichard Styron, Julio GarcÃ­a-Pelaez, and Marco Pagani\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 831–857, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-831-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-831-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Caribbean and Central American region is both tectonically active and densely populated, leading to a large population that is exposed to earthquake hazards. Until now, no comprehensive fault data covering the region have been available. We present a new public fault database for Central America and the Caribbean that synthesizes published studies with new mapping from remote sensing to provide fault sources for the CCARA seismic hazard and risk analysis project and to aid future research.\n\nEvaluation of a combined drought indicator and its potential for agricultural drought prediction in southern Spain\n\nMarÃ­a del Pilar JimÃ©nez-Donaire, Ana Tarquis, and Juan Vicente GirÃ¡ldez\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 21–33, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-21-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-21-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new combined drought indicator (CDI) is proposed that integrates rainfall, soil moisture and vegetation dynamics. The performance of this indicator was evaluated against crop damage data from agricultural insurance schemes in five different areas in SW Spain. Results show that this indicator was able to predict important droughts in 2004–2005 and 2011–2012, marked by crop damage of between 70 % and 95 % of the total insured area. This opens important applications for improving insurance schemes.\n\nStudy on real-time correction of site amplification factor\n\nQuancai Xie, Qiang Ma, Jingfa Zhang, and Haiying Yu\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 2827–2839, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-2827-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-2827-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper evaluates a new method for modeling the site amplification factor. Through implementing this method and making simulations for different cases, we find that this method shows better performance than the previous method and JMA report. We better understand the advantages and disadvantages of this method, although there are some problems that need to be considered carefully and solved; it shows good potential to be used in future earthquake early warning systems.\n\nThree-dimensional rockfall shape back analysis: methods and implications\n\nDavid A. Bonneau, D. Jean Hutchinson, Paul-Mark DiFrancesco, Melanie Coombs, and Zac Sala\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 2745–2765, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-2745-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-2745-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn mountainous regions around the world rockfalls pose a hazard to infrastructure and society. To aid in our understanding and management of these complex hazards, an inventory can be compiled. Three-dimensional remote sensing data can be used to locate the source zones of these events and generate models of areas which detached. We address the way in which the shape of a rockfall object can be measured. The shape of a rockfall has implications for forward modelling of potential runout zones.\n\nEffects of high-resolution geostationary satellite imagery on the predictability of tropical thunderstorms over Southeast Asia\n\nKwonmin Lee, Hye-Sil Kim, and Yong-Sang Choi\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 2241–2248, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-2241-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-2241-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study examined the advances in the predictability of thunderstorms using geostationary satellite imageries. Our present results show that by using the latest geostationary satellite data (with a resolution of 2 km and 10 min), thunderstorms can be predicted 90–180 min ahead of their mature state. These data can capture the rapidly growing cloud tops before the cloud moisture falls as precipitation and enable prompt preparation and the mitigation of hazards.\n\nInSAR technique applied to the monitoring of the QinghaiâTibet Railway\n\nQingyun Zhang, Yongsheng Li, Jingfa Zhang, and Yi Luo\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 2229–2240, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-2229-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-2229-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBefore the opening of the railway, the deformation of the Qinghai–Tibet Railway was very small and considered stable. After opening, the overall stability of the railway section was good. The main deformation areas are concentrated in the areas where railway lines turn and geological disasters are concentrated. In order to ensure the safety of railway operation, it is necessary to carry out long-term time series observation along the Qinghai–Tibet Railway.\n\nUnderstanding the spatiotemporal development of human settlement in hurricane-prone areas on the USÂ Atlantic and Gulf coasts using nighttime remote sensing\n\nXiao Huang, Cuizhen Wang, and Junyu Lu\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 2141–2155, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-2141-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-2141-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of nighttime satellite-derived human settlement in response to different levels of hurricane proneness in a period from 1992 to 2013. It confirms the Snow Belt-to-Sun Belt US population shift trend. The results also suggest that hurricane-exposed human settlement has grown in extent and area, as more hurricane exposure has experienced a larger increase rate in settlement intensity.\n\nPre-disaster mapping with drones: an urban case study in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada\n\nMaja Kucharczyk and Chris H. Hugenholtz\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 2039–2051, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-2039-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-2039-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe performed pre-disaster 3-D mapping with a drone in downtown Victoria, BC, Canada. This was the first drone mapping mission over a Canadian city approved by Canadaâs aviation authority. We were legally constrained to using a specific drone. The goal was to assess the quality of the 3-D map. Results indicate that the spatial accuracies achieved with this drone would allow for sub-meter building collapse detection, but the non-tilting camera was insufficient for mapping buildings in 3-D.\n\nNew approaches to modelling of local seismic amplification susceptibility using direct characteristics of influencing criteria: case study of Bam City, Iran\n\nReza Hassanzadeh, Mehdi Honarmand, Mahdieh Hossienjani Zadeh, and Farzin Naseri\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

This database has enabled the reconstruction of 3008 cases of flooding on a municipal scale between 1960 and 2015. The data analysis reveals a growing trend in the frequency and area affected by flood cases. The main novelty lies in the fact that we have detected a clear latitudinal gradient of growing intensity and severity of flood cases with a north–south direction.\n\nStatistical analysis for satellite-index-based insurance to define damaged pasture thresholds\n\nJuan JosÃ© MartÃ­n-Sotoca, Antonio Saa-Requejo, RubÃ©n Moratiel, Nicolas Dalezios, Ioannis Faraslis, and Ana MarÃ­a Tarquis\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 1685–1702, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-1685-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-1685-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVegetation indices based on satellite images, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), have been used for damaged pasture insurance. The occurrence of damage is usually defined by NDVI thresholds mainly based on normal statistics. In this work a pasture area in Spain was delimited by MODIS images. A statistical analysis of NDVI was applied to search for alternative distributions. Results show that generalized extreme value distributions present a better fit than normal ones.\n\nCited articles\n\nAirbus Defence and Space: PlÃ©iades Imagery User Guide, https://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/en/8718-user-guides (last access: 29Â OctoberÂ 2019), 2012.â\n\nAllan, P., Bryant, M., Wirsching, C., Garcia, D., and Rodriguez, M.
