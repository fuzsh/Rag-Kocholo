There's some really exciting cricket ahead for our lot in WBBL|10 so I'm looking forward to that already.\"\n\nWareham, 24, a top-class spin bowler who's often called upon to bowl in crucial overs, finished with a WBBL-best 14 wickets for the season.\n\nBut it also her batting which received plenty of plaudits, delivering her best season with the bat since her WBBL|01 debut.\n\nWareham amassed 295 runs, including a half-century and two high-pressure 40s, to finish third in the Renegades run tally behind some international quality in Harmanpreet Kaur (321) and Tammy Beaumont (296).\n\nWBBL Player of the Season Honour Roll\n\nWBBL|01 - Molly Strano\n\nWBBL|02 - Molly Strano\n\nWBBL|03 - Amy Satterthwaite\n\nWBBL|04 - Sophie Molineux\n\nWBBL|05 - Jess Duffin\n\nWBBL|06 - Courtney Webb\n\nWBBL|07 - Harmanpreet Kaur\n\nWBBL|08 - Sophie Molineux\n\nWBBL|09 - Georgia Wareham"
