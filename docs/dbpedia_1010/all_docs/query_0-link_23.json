We Happily Return To Fall and Football September arrives and we return after a lazy summer vacation to fall and school. What new sights greet our eyes? A hole in the quad where green grass once grew. Three thou- sand new faces and four thousand new bikes. A flying saucer being erected near the stadium. MRH girls. Illi buses. Lovely fall, where girl meets boy, and boy meets girls ; where professors meet students and intel- lects meet instructors. But after we've battled the registration lines, had a last laugh at our new ID cards and a last cry at our bills from the book stores, we peer out among the fallen leaves and everything's the same: Eight o'clock classes are still offered only in the Natural History Building; Ox is still working toward his degree ; ROTC is still here ; it still rains every day; the undergrad li- brary is still not the place to study; and Homecoming, Dad's Day, and ev- erything fall is still fun. Fall is the time to renew old friendships and make new acquaintances. Registration Dilemma Reaches All Time High Students doggedly await their turn to engage in the battle to obtain a desired section — \"Not quiz every Friday at five!\" Armory guide Joan Schmidt, junior in LAS, points out proper stations to perplexed coeds during registration. During Registration Week students get into the groove of college life. Even though everyone has heard about the massive confusion and tired feet, it takes a firsthand experience in this endurance test to really initiate the new school year. The required standard equipment for the event is the student's I.D. number, comfortable shoes and per- severence, with an emphasis on the latter. The first step involves meeting an appointed college adviser to secure approval of the trial reg- istration form. Now the student tentatively sched- ules the courses and sections which he has planned. At set of IBM cards, the first of many, are filled out with schedule, housing, I.D. number, and other general information. Departmental ap- proval for each course is the succeeding project. The student proceeds to the Armory, where the sectioning areas are located, in order to obtain a class card for each of his courses. The big prob- lem now is to beat the clock and to register for the scheduled course section before the section closes. This is the longest and most nerve-racking process in registration. After submitting the cards to clerks for final checking, the student passes on to a specified sta- tion where the cards are exchanged for a fee card, then proceeds to the cashier's window. The bonus is a free trip to the photographic section for an I.D. picture, which captures the end product of an encounter with registration. 10 if :iSt :: illllMlljB 1 m-- . -I 1P**H*BS b m. <4b* IHfl \"^^Rftk ■9(9 Finding a secluded spot, a couple takes a break. Annual pledge dances initiate newcomers into casual campus life. Ann Shipley is held captive by Gary Danna, who sits as a pompous ruler, playing parts dictated by the costuming. While Pledge Dances Alleviate Early Pressure The house decorations and the costumes carry out the pledge dance themes. This fall Tau Kappa Epsilon adopted a \"Psycho\" theme, awarding keys to \"cabin 1\" as favors. Getting into the spirit of the dance are Carol Ann Huszar and Mary Morehart. r m 1 _ ,.Ji . -, & • ^^ j — ~s— n M ^m\"' t 11 Annual Pajama Races Are Rowdy As Ever The term \"pajama race\" generally includes various other activities as one can tell by this scene at Alpha Rho Chi. Pledges not only have to run in the pajama race, but they also have to advertise the annual event all over campus. Readying for the race sometimes involves a good deal more excitement than the actual participation itself, as is shown here. 12 The Illi Bus is a great service to many students. In bad weather, it can't be beat. Lost? Try standing here a while. The Illi Bus is a New Service for the films The Illi Bus is the newest service on the University of Illinois campus. For five cents a student or staff member can ride anywhere on the route from Men's Residence Halls near the Stadium on the west to Illini Grove or to Women's Residence Halls on the east. One can get on or leave close to any of one hundred buildings. Thirty stops have now been marked by signs. Buses run every seven minutes from 7:17 a.m. to 5:20 p.m Mondays through Fridays, except during vacations. Any point can be reached in not more than fourteen minutes. Service began on a trial basis November 14, 1960, and is still in its birth stages. It is to become permanent if demand supports the project. This could very well be so. In the first week the number of buses had to be in- creased from three to six. The number of passengers tripled by the end of the first week. The big test for the Illi Bus will come in the Spring, when walking ceases to be chore. We hope that sights as this will be uncommon. 13 Autos No Longer Are the Most Important 14 Transportation As Bikes Increase in Number With the opening of the fall semes- ter, many new sights were to be seen on campus. One of the major innova- tions was the bicycle lanes on Wright and Gregory Streets. These paths were erected for the ever-increasing bicycle population on campus. Now when crossing streets, in addition to facing many automobile dangers, stu- dents must beware of the treacherous bicycle lanes. These bicycle lanes were inaugu- rated by the University Civil Engi- neering in order to segregate bicycles from the many cars on campus. During the fall, a survey was taken on the number of bicycles which used these lanes ; it was found that within a twenty-four hour period forty-three hundred bicycles passed Greg Hall. Within a fifteen minute break be- tween classes, three hundred bikes were ridden by this area. On Gregory Drive, forty-two hundred cyclists pedaled past the Armory within twen- ty-four hours. At the other end of the campus twenty-nine hundred bi- cycling enthusiasts wended their way past Altgeld Hall. Bicycles, bicycles, and more bicycles come to campus. Collisions as the one above were once few and far between, but over the past year, they have become everyday sights. However, as shown at the left, bicycles are not always a menace. 15 Setting out for the stadium, this crowd leaves one of the six Homecoming Special trains from the Illinois Central Railroad.

Homecoming held here on campus. Alums returned to observe the same Illini ingenuity which inspired the development of homecom- ings. The 1960 Stunt Show, a traditional home- coming event for eighteen years, presented twelve semi-finalist acts on Friday night. The table of \"Firsts\" in the front of the pro- gram included \"1960, First contemporary Stunt Show program.\" Also more \"Firsts,\" some in a contemporary mode, were displayed in house decorations of the organized houses on campus. Alums joined in a pep rally Friday night on the Illini Union Terrace, where Miss Judy Stephenson was named Homecoming Queen. The opening kick-off, reunions after the game, open houses, and creating memories . . . thus, the 50th Homecoming is complete. 16 '•MHH1 Intently watching the Homecoming football game in which the Fighting Illini were pitted against Ohio State, crowds expectantly await this outcome.

Traditional Dad's Day Weekend, on October During half-time ceremonies at the Penn State football game, Dad's Day, the Marching Illini Band pays tribute to King Dad. 20 Between halves at the Penn State game, Chief Illini leans across Sherry Enoch, a senior in high school, in order to congratulate King Dad, Mr. Woodrow Enoch. Sheila Enoch, a sophomore at the University, and Mrs. Enoch witness the procedure. 22 and 23, Found Illini Dads \"Raisin' Cane // On October 22 and 23 Illini Dads descended on the campus prepared for Raisin' Cane at the annual Illini Union sponsored Dad's Day Weekend. Inaugurated forty years ago by the first Dean of Men, Thomas A. Clark, it has grown into an annual event involving organized house functions, Dad's Day Coffee Hour, Illini Dad's Association Meeting, the Illini Varsity and Northwestern Men's Glee Club concert, Dolphin water show, and MIA- WGS Dad's Day Review. In 1948 a King for a Day was added to the agenda. This year's king, Woodrow Enoch, is the father of Sheila Enoch, a sophomore. The King's weekend began with a banquet in his honor Friday evening in the Union. Then he went to his coronation at the Pep Rally. The rest of the weekend King Enoch spent making appearances with his daughter. This year, with the help of the cheering Dads, the Illini defeated Penn State 10-8. With this victory adding an incentive, the Illini Dads went out in full force to enjoy the campus by Raisin' Cane. At the annual Dolphin Show, presented on Dad's Day Weekend, Charles Younger and Sue Bach salute the Illini Dads with \"How!\" 21 M tm wjj f 1 KrSJ( ' ,te tB\" -i-'\" • ' ft ■ - ■ ^M Arse \"» Moving down a busy street, carrying banners, and shouting with enthusiasm, this group stopped a moment to add more loyal Illini to their numbers. They continued their snake dancing toward the pep rally in the quad in front of the Illini Union. Spirits Soar as We Await Tomorrow's Game The 1960 football season, though a success- ful one, was not as fruitful as it was intended. Ranked as number two power in the nation by preseason polls, the Fighting Illini ended with a well-deserved 5 and 4 season. After opening with impressive wins over West Vir- ginia and Indiana, the team lost two in a row to powerful Ohio State and Minnesota. On Day's Day Penn State was the next victim, followed by Purdue, and then the Illini suf- fered a heartbreaking defeat at the hands of Michigan and lost 8 to 7. The Illini came back strong to beat Wisconsin, only to drop the finale to Northwestern at Dyche Stadium. The 1960 team was truly a fine one indeed, combining the qualities of spirit and morale with sportsmanship, alertness, and the all- important element needed for great football teams — good coaching. Once again the nu- cleus of the squad was the seniors, shown by many postseason bowl bids and honors they received. Again, our congratulations to the team and Mr. Elliott and staff for carrying on a tradition that has made Illinois great. Getting into the mood for Saturday's game, the students display their Illini spirit with loud response to the chant at the rally. 23 Much time is spent in organizing the equipment for Block \"I\" patterns. The students above are passing out cards. On Dad's Day Week End the Illini were really \"Raisin Cane.\" Block I did their share in this terrific stunt Block I Provides the Half-time Entertainment The camera caught this unusual Block I upheaval at the last home game. It was one big final flip of the cards until next year as the Block I unexpectedly tossed their multi-colored cards into the air during a wild moment at the end of the game. 24 The Fighting Ulini line up on West Virginia's two yard line during the first game of the season. The Illini won 34 to 0. and Then All Eyes Are on the Fighting Illini Three vivacious Pom Pom Girls, Julann Powell, Peginne Lynn, and Brenda Payne (from left to right) wait anxiously for the next play. These girls give zest to the game. What do you mean, your leg hurts ? Get in there before the next play! 25 Marching Mini Supply The Entertainment The marching band continues practicing well into the afternoon, working to perfect their performance for the Saturday game. Halftime at Illinois football games would be in- complete without the performance of the Marching Illini, one of the finest marching, playing, and sing- ing groups in the nation. Composed of over 175 men students from the Concert and First Regimental Bands, and selected members of the Second Regi- mental Band, the Marching Illini thrilled the crowds at this year's five home games and at an away game at Northwestern University. At each game, the band, under the direction of Everett Kisinger, is led onto the field in \"ILLINI\" formation by Rick Jarrard, drum major. Then Chief Illiniwek, portrayed by Ben Forsyth, adds to the spirit and tradition by performing his well- known war dance, after which the band plays the Alma Mater. The crowd enjoys joining them in song. In addition to providing entertainment at halftime, the Marching Illini play after touchdowns and dur- ing timeouts, which add to the enthusiasm of the fans. The band is also known for its \"different\" yells, including \"Blood Call,\" \"Resist Them, Resist Them,\" and \"Ricketty Ricketty Ree.\" The members practice forty to fifty formations a year in order to give a unique and exciting perform- ance at every game. Each precise exhibition is the result of almost eight hours practice a week. For a change of pace, the band plays one semi- classical or classical number at every performance. The Marching Illini are truly the pride of the Uni- versity of Illinois. 26 After Hours of Practicing to Attain Precision l> ^ •Ilillillili. ■ ■ \"^^ 4HMc 1 TP'^v • 4\\\\ \\ <PI / ' .\"£,:. - '§ 1 m * lUr * ' J -* ffi • ' ifc ^Mfll^ Relaxing on the lawn, members of the Illini band take out their instruments in preparation for their daily practice. The performance requires even more equipment. These two band members do their part by wheeling over the kettledrums. Maybe cotton in the ears would help solve this fellow's problem. Practicing for Saturday's big event, Kirby Johnson plays among French horn players. Could this be the new uniform for Illini glockenspiel players? 27 And The Band Presents the Final Production The Marching Mini highlight another home football game with a special performance during the halftime i MB intermission. \"Hail to the Orange\" rings out from the stadium as the band stands in \"ILLINI\" formation in a salute to the alma mater. 28 Band leader Everett Kisinger strives for perfection as he directs the band during one of the frequent practice sessions. 29 Campus in the Cold of Winter Can Be Dreary; One must be in the right place at the right time to capture a sight such as the one above. The quad seems almost on fire. A seemingly lonely student crosses the quadrangle on his way to Noyes Lab; the cold and the snow keep his pace a meager one. i r- Also It Can Be Bright and Can Be Elegant Winter, for the Illini, can be very rough. With the snow comes the cold feet, the messy halls, the crash to the ground, and the snowball in the face. And with the wind comes the biting cold, the long walk home, the chill in the room, and the uncombed hair. With the freezing temperatures come the long socks, the car that won't start, and the aching fin- gers. But this is only a part of winter. On the other hand, winter can be rather enjoyable. The first snow, the extra lift when you step outside, the Christmas tree, the Christmas parties, and that Yuletide cheer are the things that make winter worthwhile. These are, a least, some of the things. TGIFing takes on a new high during the cold months. \"Biddies,\" \"Kam's,\" \"Thunderbird,\" and \"Stan's\" are always teeming with bright faces, smoke, and noise. Winter formals break through the snow and wind to give that \"something different\" touch to the year. Then we have the serenades that can so innocently remove any desire to study which you might have had. And International Week is al- ways a topic of much conversation. It's a fine way of acquainting the foreign students with the rest of the undergraduates and also the faculty and the people from the surrounding area. In the winter, plans are drawn up for the waterfight, and for that long trip to \"where the boys are.\" Winter is a time to be in- side, to be warm, and to be comfortable. And as al- ways, winter is a time to talk about that favorite sub- ject of ours. What is it? Why, the spring, of course ! The elegance of winter can make remarkable changes in the campus sights. As shown below these changes are for the good only. II i — I ■ - ■ HHBk 31 Good Students Try Anything To Stay Awake What's he doing? Your guess is as good as mine. Perhaps after reading his psychology, he's analyzed his true personality. Here Carla Fox tries to persuade Lawrence Levy that he is not a polar bear and that he just has to get rid of that psych book. When the snows begin to fall, students flock outdoors to enjoy the crisp weather. An escape from an overly-warm room into the great outdoors gives one a good study break and a breath of fresh air at the same time. Carla Fox and Lawrence Levy take advan- tage of the nice weather and, at the same time, find an excuse to stop their studying. Of course, Lawrence is only joking when he reads his psychology book in the snow, but perhaps his method is not such a bad one. At least he escapes the danger of falling asleep instead of studying. Now that the campus has been strewn with construction equipment and bulldozers, the snow is a help, for it covers the rubble. The campus looks uniformly white instead of being torn apart. Besides providing good study breaks and fun, the snow is a sign of winter — the passing of the old year and coming of the new. 32 Ford Rollo and Marty Neet (left) and Fran Musil and Jacki Finley (right) drink coffee and play bridge on Friday afternoon.

Stretching out the arms is one of the many typical gestures of the native Hawaiian dance of Anne Lum. While the clerk points out facts about the native pottery, weaving, and jewelry display, this group gazes in rapt attention. ^ >£t&> 34 About Foreign Nations, Was Held in Union On December 2 and 3, 1960, the \"World of Iambo\" was held at the Illini Union. This theme of the International Fair, when trans- lated, means \"That All May Be One.\" Spon- sored by the Illini Union, the fair attempted to carry out this idea. Varied displays from a number of nations showed different facets of the lives of the peoples. These booths were tended by the natives from each country. This lended itself to being more realistic. Consisting of facets of life, from the Sweet Shoppe of pastries to an Italian sportscar, there were twenty-two exhibits in all. Each drew crowds of college students who were interested in learning about foreign customs. In the line of entertainment, the Pageant was held in the auditorium on the preceding Wednesday. Ten countries represented their cultures. Copacabana, Latin American, and an oriental teahouse were held at the fair. Intricately weaving the patterns of a native dance, these gaily dressed dancers entertain patrons of the Copacabana. Determining the proper position for their sign, these Arabs prepare their display concerning the population of the Arab World. 35 Christmas is One of the Most Enjoyable Times What is more fun at Christmas than sitting on Santa's lap? One little girl is telling Santa her wants for Christmas. Karen Kassube, sitting on the floor at the left, talks to two of the boys as they all enjoy brownies and hot cocoa. Bobby smiles as he sits on Ox's back. Ox seemed to be the center of attention, except for Santa and his bag of gifts. These four smiling youngsters stand in front of the Christ- mas tree and display their gifts — pairs of woolen mittens. 36 Especially When We Take the Time to Share It This year, many groups on campus decided to entertain smaller children by giving them Christmas parties. At this particular party, the two groups combined an exchange and a Christmas celebration. Their guests were the members of a first grade class from a nearby school. After the children arrived, they inspected the huge decorated Christmas tree, which was decorated a few days before. There was some tinsel left, which they hung. They especially enjoyed OX, the well-known Saint Bernard, who patiently endured the evening. When Santa arrived, the tree was forgotten, and the children lined up to sit on Santa's lap and receive their gifts from his sack. Everyone present had fun. The best part of Christmas should be the giving. The group of children sing one of the three Christmas carols which they prepared as a surprise for their delighted hosts and hostesses. Kay Peters (left) helps one of the boys put on his coat, as Harriet House bends over to tell one of the children goodbye. The tired Santa Claus, Phil Kellogg, takes his beard down to sit and relax for a few minutes after the children have gone. 37 Carole receives a phone call and accepts an invita- tion for Friday night and the Registration Dance. Carole's question is, \"What should I wear?\" She asks friends Sandra Ervin (left) and Betty Borling (right) their opinions. We're Lost in a Swirl of Parties and Dances It's Friday night, and Carole rummages through her drawers for various items and says, \"But it was here only yesterday!\" Carole brushes her hair and anticipates the oncoming evening. She wonders about her date for the evening. 38 Rita Meiers (right) watches Carole come down the stairs and checks to make sure all's well. It is, and Carole goes to meet her date. Carole smiles as she and her date, Carl Massa. leave for the dance; her worries are gone. In the Wintertime-And Also in Other Seasons He's a good dancer, too! Carole enjoys her evening, as one can see from her smile as she and Carl dance. At home again, Carole describes the dance to Rita and shows the dance bid to Rita, who is sleepy, but interested in her account. 39 Spring Came and We Donned Our Shades In the spring, it sometimes feels good to just get out and take a relaxing walk. This is a scene from atop Altgeld Hall. These two students walk hand in hand and enjoy the beauty of spring on the Illinois campus. In spring, all spirits lighten. 40 and Went Out Into That Good Ole Sunshine University of Illinois students fill the quadrangle to watch twilight concerts nearly every Wednesday evening of the spring. Spring is the time when spirits lift and students like to forget about their books. The campus takes on a freer, lighter atmosphere; this feeling seems to be magnetic and soon reaches nearly all students. Spring offers a variety of events which lighten moods even more. Sheequon, though much work, is enjoyed and attended by many students. The Ar- mory is transformed into a different world, the type of world depending upon the theme for the year. Spring concerts, held nearly every Wednesday eve- ning, draw many Illini to the quadrangle, where they spread their blankets out and listen. Nearly every year a water fight occurs, and pent- up tensions are released. Although many regula- tions prohibit water fights, they occur yearly. Mother's Weekend, falling usually the first week- end in May, brings thousands of mothers tc the campus. During the weekend, the Women's Glee Club entertains ; Shi-Ai-Sachem Sing and Spring Mu- sical thrill both Illini and their mothers alike. Many a proud mother watches her son or daughter during the Honor's Day ceremony. Many spring formals take place each weekend, as well as swimming parties and picnics. One can look around and see all the convertible tops down; this is a sure sign of the spring. Many honoraries hold tappings in the spring se- mester. The last, but not least, important event is graduation. It is hard to decide whether the weather or the exciting events make spring so grand. 41 Spring Musical Presents \"Guys and Dolls u With those lovely legs high, and those pretty smiles wide, these young ladies hypnotize almost everyone watching their dance. This jumble of bodies looks like mass confusion. Just what these fellows are doing is uncertain, but it looks like fun. The Illini Union Spring- Musical, \"Guys and Dolls,\" has been rated as one of the best shows ever. The east for the show given on Mother's Day Weekend was as follows : Sara Brown, Nancy Voor- hies; Nathan Detroit, Charles Heimerdinger; Miss Adelade, Joyce Friedman; Sky Masterson, John Ewing and Roger Cowen; General Matilda B. Cart- wright, Helen Curley; Nicely Nicely Johnson, Ed- ward Levy; Benny Southstreet, Howard Bluestone; Rusty Charlie, Arthur Ricordati; Harry the Horse, Larry Gittleson; Lieutenant Brannigan, Bruce Kri- viskey; Angie the Ox, Tony Zeppetella; Joey Bilt- more, Jeff Foote; Mimi, Bonnie Winston; Big Jule, Dick Dresser; and Arvide Abernathy, Jack Bert. In the mission band were Lois Harris, Tom Dolan, Betty Zinser, Deanna Davis and Pat Eichelberger. Members of the chorus were Karen Crane, Deanna Davis, Pat Eichelberger, Lois Harris, Sonja Hanson, Haven Palmquist, Betty Zinser, John Reynolds, How- ard Bluestone, Ray Delong, Tom Dolan, Jeff Foote, and Bruce Kriviskey. 42 OK, girls, just keep going. The audience may he in for a thrill as these girls disrobe in a lively scene from Guys and Dolls. HP! jam ^M ww Am K'v'ln W Mr *Mwfi ^m^ <IV™ Their solemn expressions hardly corresponded with the way they could dance. Their movement represents much practice. He's up! let's hope he comes down! The dancing in Guys and Dolls took many forms as is shown by these young males. 43 One will very often find himself in strange positions in preparing for Sheequon. This position takes the load off vonr feet Nn matter what poS1t10n we get ourselves into, the goal is to have a bigger and better Sheequon thar -the one the year before Sheequon Explodes In Sixty With Fantastic Booths must be built to enclose the activities that will be displayed during the Armory events on Saturday evening. Paint is dabbed and smeared from booth to booth and float to float in hopes of giving Sheequon that finished touch. 44 During Sheequon preparation, the artist comes out in all of us. Many of our accomplishments show signs of artistic ingenuity. Here the TKE's display one of their creations. Such a creation is only a small sample of the creations designed all over campus. Rendition of Those Rip Roaring Twenties // Sheequon exploded this year in usual splendor, bigger and better than ever before. Up until just this spring, we were all under the impression that Sheequon had come to a climax; however, after much discussion in Student Senate, Sheequon was assured of a return visit. What is Sheequon? It is the release of pent-up energy. It is the time and money spent in making each float and show just a little bit better. Shee- quon is hard work and at the same time loads of fun. For those who take part in shaping Shee- quon into its final mold, it is the pride we feel after seeing a job well done. Although all students do not take part in planning Sheequon, everyone enjoys the frantic fun that arises during this gala event. The Sheequon celebration began after classes were dismissed on Friday, and officially ushered in the new spring season that we had been waiting for all winter. The crowd, parade, and fireworks served to keep our minds off the high winds and exceptionally brisk weather that still persisted. In the armory skit competition, the spectators witnessed and laughed at the many different ver- sions given to this year's theme, \"The Roaring Twenties.\" 45 The floats are definitely the most elaborate displays of the big Sheequon weekend. Everyone loves the beautiful parade. Kftv SfM' <«■' ^ >-•-.' \" ' ;*j. v Gary Miner, student co-chairman of the Engineering Open House activities, is doing a perf, ormance test on a gas turbine.

The event is the annual Engi- neering Open House, held this year on the weekend of March 11 and 12. The Open House enables all the schools of engineering from Aeronautical to Nuclear to display their goods under one broad heading: Engineering. This year along with the multi- tude of ingenious exhibits, Tau Beta Pi, the all-engineering scholastic honorary frater- nity, displayed many of the textbooks used in the College of Engineering for anyone who was inspired enough to look inside and find out the principles behind one exhibit and the next. After two filling days of looking at tech- nical exhibits, the weekend is climaxed with a contrasting air at the St. Pat's Ball. This year the theme for the annual Farm and Home Show was Progress for Better Liv- ing. Many exhibits demonstrated the fact that in the College of Agriculture, \"Progress is our most important product.\" Everything from home furnishings to a Feed Automation system was shown to interested viewers at this year's show. • t 47 Sometimes, the University Police become the brunt of the many tensions supposedly released each year through the Watertight. Studyday Means Watertight for Almost All The rioting masses pause at Allen Hall during their wild and sometimes destructive march across their water-soaked campus. He has got one of them; he has 3000 more to go. What starts out in good wet fun can sometimes end up in pretty hot trouble. 48 Weather Change Brings a Change in Mood In the spring, when study conditions under the sun are far superior to those inside, scenes like this are not uncommon. This couple has slipped off for a few moments together. Ah yes, love is even more beautiful in the softness of spring! As the wind begins to blow and the clouds muster, we don our trench coats and prepare ourselves for the oncoming monsoons. 49 Handicapped Students Jeri Christensen participates in this study by the Univer- sity to determine the pitch and length of wheelchair ramps. Members of the Gizz Kids demonstrate that wheelchairs do not hinder their enthusiasm and skill for basketball. Ronald O'Fallon displays to his wife and baby the trophy he won as outstanding wheelchair athlete in Rome's paralympics. The University of Illinois Student Rehabilita- tion Program, a pioneering Illini activity which has received international recognition, provides opportunities in almost every area for any of the 160 handicapped students presently on campus. In sports, the \"Rolling Illini,\" better known as the \"Gizz Kids,\" live up to the best traditions of the \"Fighting Illini\" — the only thing left out is the use of feet! Whether it be football, softball, basketball, bowling, archery, or track and field, playing accuracy, energy, and enthusiasm leave nothing to be desired. In scholarship and in many other activities, handicapped students vie with able-bodied, who give scarcely a thought to the wheelchairs. One of last year's salutatorians was a wheelchair coed. Many others have won scholastic honors. Handi- capped students have been prominent in publica- tions, house organizations, professional societies, and other fields. They have well demonstrated that their abilities, not disabilities, count. Illinois has given them every educational oppor- tunity. It encourages their personal, social, and physical development. Facilities include the Stu- dent Rehabilitation Center providing therapy, counseling, and other services; residence halls planned for either handicapped or able-bodied; ramps on ground floor entrances to buildings; and elevator-equipped buses for long travel on the wide Illini campus. Research is also being carried out in subjects such as space needed for wheel- chairs, and wheelchair ramp pitch and length. Core of the program, providing direction, help, and encouragement, is the staff of the Center, headed by Professor Timothy J. Nugent. Receive Every Opportunity (or Independence The University's four lift-equipped busses facilitate long- distance travel as from residence halls to classroom areas. Handicapped students feel right at home in the resi- dence halls which provide many facilities to assist them. Members of the Gizz Kids join in an entertaining evening of square dancing. This organization is sponsored by Delta Sigma Omicron, a co-educational service fraternity for disabled students, and also participates in a number of sports activities. 51 Students Who Worked Way Through School Scurrying to keep up with the demands of their jobs, Norm Tana and John Ball, Illini Union waiters, carry trays to tables. Thoroughly scrubbing an Illini Union table, Charles Summers, helps to maintain clean dining rooms for Union customers. Another facet of the waiter's job is to serve meals. Here Carl Few places a portion of Jane Heid's meal before her. 52 Found Jobs To Help Out With Their Finances Many University of Illinois students need to put themselves either completely or partially through college. Since summer jobs do not supply all the necessary money for education, these students work during the class year at various jobs. The job opportunities for men are more numerous and more varied than those for women. Among the jobs which men may hold down, the most common are meal jobs. The meal jobs consist of waiters, dish washers, and kitchen boys. In return for work- ing at least two meals a day, these men receive their meals without paying. The Union provides many job opportunities in the fields of check room clerks, candy counter clerks, and cashiers. The libraries on campus are another source of employment for men. Women have less varied job opportunities. They may serve as waitresses in the University Women's Residence Halls, work in the University libraries, or find employment in the numerous college offices. As fewer women than men need to work, there is an adequate number of jobs for all who need them. Carefully dishing food into a serving bowl is part of the kitchen job of Sue Swanson, Jill Andrews, and Meg Adamson. Wayne Ahrens places a coat on a hanger in the Union cloak room. Besides coats, he checked books, hats, and parcels. Pouring coffee from the standard coffee urn facilitates the job of Susan Boy, who serves in the capacity of a waitress. 53 John F. Kennedy, candidate for President of the United States, here speaks before an enormous crowd of University students. National Politicians Compete for llliru Vote Kennedy signs autographs for a few members of the enthusiastic crowd that greeted hi T greeted him. Illinois' Senator Douglas waits patiently. 54 Politics comes to us in many forms. Here a group of students protest the somewhat controversial dismissal of Dr. Leo F. Koch. John Kennedy, Cabot Lodge are Speakers Henry Cabot Lodge speaks to approximately 6000 students. He spoke of his grounds for the candidacy of Vice-President. Eleanor Roosevelt, the World's First Lady, visits the campus to help promote the Presidential campaign of John Kennedy. 55 Compulsory ROTC, Subject of Controversy Honors Day is celebrated with a parade of ROTC Cadets each year. Above, a few officers prepare themselves for the big event. 56 Is With Us Now, May Not Be in the Future Company \"H\" of the Army ROTC receives a ribbon to display on its Guide-on for winning first place in the parade competition. Compulsory ROTC is probably the most widely discussed topic on the campus. Some like the idea, some don't, and some really don't care. Regardless of what your opinion may be, ROTC is here; from the looks of things it's going to be here for a while. So buck up, freshmen and sophomores; it's not that bad. The Army Reserve Officer Training Corps, pictured above, is divided into seven branches: Signal Corps, Infantry Corps, Quartermaster Corps, Ordnance Corps, Ar- tillery Corps, Army Corps, and the Corps of Engineers. The Senior Cadets from each of the seven groups make up Army Council, which is the governing body of the Army. This board is in charge of all Army ROTC affairs on the campus. The different corps sponsor two military parades in the fall and three in the spring. One of the spring parades is the Honors Day event in which outstanding men in the Army are awarded for their service. \"Eyes right,\" is the command given here as this ROTC company passes the \"reviewing stand\" to be graded for their parading performance. 57 It seems like Gaila simply doesn't have enough hands. As the deadline approaches, the staff works frantically. It's Marion Bloemer coping- with the cropping machine or is it coping with her? Oh, well, it looks like fun. Activities Provide Useful Service and Occupy I guessall actors aren't dignified; these three don't appear to be. Barb Hermling and Gay Porter are supervising Sally Heinzel as she removes the hardware, preparing a flat for storage. They seem to be enjoying\" this work, hard as it may be. 58 There are many activities on campus to allow stu- dents to do something constructive with their spare time. Often, an activity offers an opportunity for the students to further their education in an infor- mal atmosphere. Some examples of this are Theatre for speech majors, Daily Illini and Illio for jour- nalism majors, Terrapin for Physical Education Ma- jors, and Orchesis for those majoring in dance. Of course, anyone may join an activity, not just those who are majoring in the related field. Besides serving the students, activities allow the students to serve, also. Many activities, such as Star Course, which brings big-name talent to campus, and the Daily Illini, which publishes a newspaper daily, the Illio, which provides the students with one of the largest yearbooks in the world, offer services and privileges to students, faculty, and townspeople. Spare Time of Students Freshman in Theatre Sally Heinzel examines a model set used by the Technical Director for a production. Busy organizing, counting, and sorting tickets, Don Quest makes preparations for a Star Course Concert. Don, as senior man- ager, has his hands kept full serving as an over-all director and providing a working pattern for the activities of Star Course, 59 Karol Thomas takes time out from her studying to take care of those \"ornery\" dishes. She is enjoying herself. Chuck seems to be supervising. Surely he's not worried! Many students at the University of Illinois com- bine marriage with education. Many times there is even a family to care for, along with studying for the hour exams. The University does provide some housing for married students, but many of them re- side in private homes or apartments. Social events on campus provide entertainment for them. Students Combine Married Life and Education Quiet moments like these are rare, and even now Karol has to work on an art project while Chuck reads the paper. It' shame that fireplace isn't put to better use as the songs suggest. Karol and Chuck are envied by several couples on camt s a campus. 60 Away from Classes, U. of I. Instructors Relax Engrossed in his favorite hobby, Professor Leal relaxes from teaching Spanish and proudly shows his wife his stamp album. Intently viewing his scale model building, Jack Baker, in- structor of architecture, checks his project for mistakes. Reading a story book to his young daughter, John Mar- tin, Rhetoric instructor, relaxes from the University. 61 The Episcopal Church serves both students and faculty mem- bers. Canterbury House, next door, is devoted to students. St. John's Catholic Church offers students activities through Newman Foundation and Newman Hall men's dorm. Student Foundations Develop Religious Life Taking advantage of the many facilities offered by the Presbyterian Church, Don Williamson speaks in the chapel of McKinley. 62 This Congregational Church has a wide program of services, spiritual and recreational, for members of the Illini student body on campus. Under the auspices of the Methodist Church, Wesley Foundation offers numerous activities for students. 63 Increased Enrollment Necessitates Expansion: / A swimming pool to be built in the middle of the quad? No, it's just the foundation being dug for the new Union. The University of Illinois opened in 1868 in a second-hand building with an enrollment of 50 students. Today, the University has grown in size to accommodate its 22,000 students and is continually expanding for the future. Rising on a 39-acre site immediately south of Memorial Stadium, a much-needed facility for the University is under construction. This new bowl-shaped Assembly Hall, a somewhat radical departure from contemporary architecture, will have facilities for a multitude of activities and will be able to accommodate a larger portion of the student body than is presently possible. Pro- visions have been made for areas to hold sports events, conventions, musical and theatrical pro- ductions, and exhibitions, as well as space for meeting rooms, offices, lounges, and kitchens. Also being planned is a new addition to the Illini Union. Although actual construction will not start until some time in the near future, the quadran- gle is at present a mass of excavations, bulldozers, and laborers as the foundation is being dug and pipes are being laid. Completed late this fall, the three additions to the cluster of Men's Residence Halls are the new- est buildings on campus. Like the halls built two years ago in the same style, they present a strik- ing effect with their picture window walls and landscaped courtyards. Also to be finished soon are the new graduate student residence halls. With bulldozers roaring, fences blocking our path to classes, and mud, the quad is a far cry from the grassy area we once knew. The First Stages of the Union Addition Begin The doubts and dislikes of pessimistic students for the new Union have been expressed on this workmen's toolshed. The Union addition is still in its early stages of con- struction; the foundation is being dug and pipes laid. Extensive as it seems, construction on campus is only in the preliminary stages. The Union is just one of the expansions being planned, others including housing projects, additions to the library, and considerations for an Education Building. 65 An Invaluable Assembly Hall Will Benefit All F™m this structure will soon emerge a much needed facility for the University, an all-purpose Assembly Hall. This bowl- shaped building will have provisions for activities ranging from sports events to conventions and theatrical productions. With so much building taking place on campus, construction workers are a familiar sight to all of us. To accommodate our increasing enrollment, residence halls such as this new grad dorm were built this year or are being planned. 66 Wayne Ahrens, a member of Alpha Delta Phi frater- nity, realizes the importance of daily studying. Deeply engrossed in a copy of Outline of Shakespeare's Plays is Betty Lawler, a student who takes an interest in her work.

The second shot depicts the ideal situation, while the third shows which one has the greater power of concentration to fight off sleep. 68 The devastating fire roared through several buildings. Champaign and Urbana firemen fought the blaze through the night and early morning. No sooner had the fire been put out than the Illio staff arrived to begin sorting out ruins and saving what was left to be saved. With the photo deadline two days off, the Illio found itself without even so much as an office. What wasn't destroyed by fire was dam- aged by smoke and water. The staff worked for two days straight attempting to get things organized. In the midst of the con- fusion, the Tekes graciously offered their downstairs as temporary headquarters for the Illio. The Illio accepted and the Teke house became the new office. It was the office until the new one was obtained on the crowded second floor of a frame house on Sixth Street. A new office will be sought for the future. The fire not only left the Illio office in ruin, but swept through six business establish- ments in Campus Town. Destroyed or dam- aged in the blaze were the Campus Florist, Genung Jewelry Store, York Travel Ex- change, Illini Currency Exchange, Fairchild Camera Shop, and McBride's Drugstore. io Editorial Office Struck by Raging Fire These firemen examine carefully the ruins of the various offices so as to prevent the damaging blaze from starting again. 70 These firemen attempt to reach the inside of the burning office to stop the fire from spreading. Robert Telleen, Editor of the ILLIO, picks the office sign up out of the rubble. It was the first thing recovered when the salvaging job began.

Industriously washing dishes, Charlene Hammering discovers that cooking a meal is only half of the job in a kitchen. Dean L. B. Howard of the College of Agriculture makes sure that everything is running smoothly. 72 and Extension, Aids University, State, Nation The College of Agriculture not only pro- vides a teaching program for the students at the University of Illinois, but serves the state and the nation in research and exten- sion work. Through its research work, the University has carried on extensive studies to meet the problems of farmers and homemakers. As new materials and information develop, they are released to the state and nation through news stories, bulletins, periodicals, radio and television dispatches and photographs. The Cooperative Extension Service extends the boundaries of the college to the whole state. Extension workers supply new meth- ods and information to the people of Illinois. Teaching, the third division, serves two purposes. One, it provides the students at the University with the chance to become ed- ucated in their particular interests. Second, it provides the state with some trained lead- ers in Agriculture and Home Economics. The College continually is changing so to meet the needs in its field. Beginning this year the college offered two new course ma- jors, Agriculture Industries, and Agriculture Communications. Trying to develop the coordination of John Boat and Sue Snow, Miss Carla Krauss demonstrates the use of carpentry materials. Making use of the facilities offered by the child development center, Penny Alexander, Tom Fross, and Bob Boom happily play in the yard. This child development center enables students to observe the reactions of normal pre-school aged youngsters. 73 The Institution of Aviation Expanded Rapidly Although the student enrollment is relatively small, Direc- tor Leslie Bryan has a job with the growing department. The Institute of Aviation, directed by Leslie A. Bryan, offers a program of flight maintenance, avia- tion instruction, and a professional pilot curriculum to one hundred students in the school and to three hundred fifty others in the University. The airport and the institute were established in 1945. The airport has expanded now so that it is larger in area than Chicago's Midway Airport. The Institute has gained a national reputation for its many advances. Research at the University airport has improved methods of flight instruction and has pioneered new safety practices. Airport facilities have been used for research by the Departments of Agriculture, En- gineering, and Psychology, and other departments. An expansion program is underway that includes the building of a one-half million dollar terminal building and control tower. The building will pro- vide office space for the Ozark Airlines; the tower will operate as a part of the Interstate Air Traffic System of the Untied States. Used during the day and night, the rapidly growing University of Illinois Airport is larger in area than Midway Airport of Chicago. A. Spottke, P. Mennekan, W. Laird, and J. Hinklhause are undertaking a hard job in aircraft maintenance. 74 The College of Commerce and Business Admini- stration, located in David Kinley Hall, was called the College of Commerce in 1867 ; three courses were offered that first year of operation. To provide educational experiences for students who are to hold positions in business, government, teaching, and research, is the purpose of the College of Commerce. The college provides a study of basic aspects of business and prepares the student for the specialized and professional career in the fields of business. Some of the many organizations in the School of Commerce are the Business Education Club, the Fi- nance Club, and the Commerce Council. These organ- izations aim to promote interests in these various fields of work in commerce and to broaden the stu- dent's knowledge of his field. Beta Alpha Psi is a scholastic honorary organiza- tion encouraging the ideal of service as the basis of an accounting profession. Delta Sigma Pi is a pro- fessional fraternity. Dean Paul Green serves as the Dean of Commerce and Dean of the Graduate School of Business Administration at Illinois. College of Commerce Offers Good Training Here we see a group of students hurrying- to their next class at \"D.K.H.,\" as it is commonly called by the Illini students. This is a typical commerce classroom. The instructor shows the students the proper position of both hands when typing. 75 The College of Education Trains the Teacher The door of Education is always open for those who wish to walk through it. The door leads students into many areas of teaching. \"The College of Education certainly lives up to its fine reputation,\" says Alonzo G. Grace, new dean of the College. The school has gained its reputation not only by providing students with the proper backgrounds in elementary education, indus- trial education, home economics education, and education for exceptional children, men- tally handicapped, deaf, and hard of hearing, but it also has established and operates many research and educational services. The Bu- reau of Educational Research conducts stud- ies in tests and measurements, educational psychology, educational sociology, guidances, and school administration. The Council on Teacher Education plans teacher education programs and is responsible for student teaching and placement. The Office of Field Services offers a number of free services to schools of the state. The Institute for Re- search on Exceptional Children is the world's first institute for research on the education of both handicapped and gifted children. Uni- versity High School serves as a laboratory school for the college. Dean Grace also says a study redefining the purposes of the College has been initiated. Possibilities for the development of a sound junior college in the state are being investi- gated. Dean Grace, Dean of the College of Education is ready to give advice and encouragement to the students enrolled in his college. ~ ...... ^ ;.:, of Tomorrow for Various Specialized Fields Practice teaching is by far the most practical way to give students in education experience for their future teaching careers. Under such an arrangement, students and teachers both profit, for while the students learn, the teachers are learning also. Student teachers take their jobs very seriously, and feel a sense of accomplishment when a child learns to spell a new word. When a student begins to ask questions, a feeling of closeness arises and the barriers between pupil and teacher disappear. 77 Two IT. of I. students, T. S. Govindan (left) from India and D.

Engineering -a College with a Dual Purpose- Professor Marvin Wyman and Gerald Beck, Reactor Super- visor, admire the newly completed Nuclear Reactor Labora- tory. The College of Engineering aims to prepare men for professional work in engineering and for re- sponsible positions of a technical and semi-techni- cal character in industry, commerce, and govern- ment. The college provides training in mathemat- ics and the physical sciences and their applications to the design, construction, and operation of indus- trial plants and public and private works of all kinds. The principal departments of the College of Engineering are Aeronautical, Electrical, Civil, Physics, General, Mechanical, Metallurgical, Cer- amic, and Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. The undergraduate curricula are administered by these departments. The curriculum in Chemical Engi- neering is directed by the Colleges of Agriculture and Engineering. Enrollment in the college is presently approaching four thousand undergradu- ates. W. L. Everitt has been the dean of the col- lege since 1949. While each student pursues a curriculum of his own choice, according to the field of his particular interest, during the first and second years all en- gineering students are required to take the basic courses in mathematics, chemistry, physics, rhet- oric, and drawing. In spite of a specialized curric- ula, third and fourth year students must take courses outside their fields. 78 One of the students (left) in an advanced Mechanical Engineering class reviews a problem at the board for his classmates, while his instructor, Professor R. P. Strout, stands (at right) at the rear of the classroom watching the young man at work. Trains Engineers and Conducts Vital Research One of the College's main purposes is to conduct research. The Engineering Experiment Station is the research organization of the College. The Sta- tion was originally organized to aid industry ; this aid remains a big part of its job. The operating budget of the Station's research activities totals over $6,000,000 a year, most of it from the spon- sorship of projects by industry and government agencies. The Engineering Experiment Station is administered by a director, Professor Ross J. Mar- tin, and an Executive Staff composed of the heads of the departments and the professor in charge of chemical engineering. The Station's research program is largely deter- mined by the interests of the research staff, which consists of full-time research professors, members of the teaching staff, and graduate research as- sistants. Not counting technicians and office per- sonnel, nearly six hundred people are carrying on research at the Station. The presence of the Sta- tion strengthens the educational program and pro- vides positions for graduate students. At the same time, the opportunity to take part in a large and varied research program helps the teaching staff keep up with the latest developments in their spe- cial fields, while helping them keep their teaching at the highest level of quality. Dean William L. Everitt, the man with the large task of head- ing this college, switches on a vacuum tube voltmeter. 79 Extension Spreads Benefits Throughout State The Hott Memorial Center was presented to the University of Illinois in September of 1960. This center will be used by the University Extension Service as an education resource facility. Adult conferences are to be scheduled in the near future. During the dedication of Allen Hall, Associate Dean Robinson and son admire a striking piece of proudly displayed sculpture. The Division of University Extension of- fers educational benefits in the state to adults and other qualified people who can't come to the campus as students but who are entitled to the services rendered by their state uni- versity. The sections by which the depart- ments carries on its work number nine: (1) Short Courses, Conferences, and Institutes; (2) Correspondence Studies; (3) The Extra- mural Classes; (4) Audio- Visual Aids Serv- ice; (5) Music Extension; (6) Engineering Extension, which includes Firemanship Training; (7) Police Training Institute; (8) Vocational Testing and Counseling for the Adults; (9) Information Services. There are 35,000 students registered in the exten- sion. To these are added the many who bene- fit from music and audio-visual services. 80 Institute Service Keeps Public Well Informed In addition to the many Colleges on the campus, the University of Illinois also provides services to many organizations. One of these services is the Institute of Government and Public Affairs. It is designed to furnish information and collective data to individuals and groups and government and state officials requesting various types of aggregate data. Graduate students are employed by this office to do field research and process the data to the different levels of government, as well as other groups. A feature beneficial to students looking for em- ployment in government is given by the Institute. Often, the Institute acts as an agent between gov- ernmental jobs and interested students by providing pertinent information about the jobs. Director G. Y. Steiner assumes many responsibilities as the head of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs. U. of I. Studies Labor-Management Problems The University of Illinois Board of Trustees estab- lished the Institute of Labor and Industrial Rela- tions in 1946 to \"inquire faithfully, honestly, and im- partially into labor-management problems of all types, and secure the facts which will lay the foun- dations for future progress\" in the field of labor relations. The three main divisions of the Institute are cor- related. In the first area, resident instruction, the degree of Master of Arts in labor and industrial re- lations is offered. In the second area, research, fac- ulty members study many of the basic problems in the field of labor and industrial relations. In the third area, extension services, adult education pro- grams are offered, through the Division of Univer- sity Extension, to labor, management, and public groups throughout the State. The Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations, stressing the inter-disciplinary approach to the study of labor and industrial relations, draws upon the contributions of several academic disciplines — economcis, psychology, sociology, history, law, and political science. Director Martin Wagner supervises the many programs sup- ported by the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations. 81 After many years of classes in the Architecture Building', students in art recently moved into this new building. Their proudest claim, the Krannert Art Museum, will exhibit the University's art collection, never before shown for lack of space. New Fine Arts Building and Krannert Art Dean Weller, the head of the College of Fine and Applied Arts, takes time out from his many duties to enjoy a piece of sculpture. A contrast in the college of FAA is sym- bolized by its buildings. The recently com- pleted, modern Krannert Art Museum and Fine Arts Building exemplify the progres- sion and leadership in the fields of architec- ture, art, and city planning and landscape architecture. Similarly, the classical struc- ture of Smith Music Hall represents the gran- deur and tradition in music. Also included in the college administered by Dean Allen S. Weller are the Small Homes Council and the Bureau of Community Plan- ning, both of which are devoted to research and extension ; the University Bands ; and a variety of music organizations which present concerts frequently throughout the year. Activities of the college are prominently featured in the Festival of Contemporary Arts, held biennially in March. Concerts, ex- hibitions, lectures, demonstrations, and con- ferences within the diverse areas of art are presented, and many outstanding profession- als in the field participate. The highlight of this year's festival was the opening of the Krannert Art Museum. Contemporary work by many eminent artists was displayed and plans for future showings were made. 82 The School of Music is proud of its Men's Glee Club, as well as the director Harold Decker. An outstanding choral organiza- tion, they have in the past few years made many concert tours across the United States and in several European countries. Museum Are the Pride of the College of FAA Ken Neumann, an aspiring architecture student, works diligently on a project but at the same time has an apple handy for his professor. Still-life painting provides many difficulties but a lot of fun for this art student. 83 This pretty little typesetter carefully selects another let- ter of 12 point Century type from the California Job Case. Dean Peterson is the head of our School of Journalism, which graduates some of the finest advertising men in the country. Our Journalism College Is One of the Finest This sweet young miss seems to be putting her entire heart into her work. She is busily learning the tedious process of editing film. The College of Journalism and Communica- tions offers academic instruction, public serv- ice, and research. Instruction is carried out by the Departments of Advertising, Journal- ism, and Radio and Television. The student is closely associated to public service and re- search through the Division of University Broadcasting and the Institute of Communi- cation Research, both of which are under the jurisdiction of the college. Among the facilities of the college are a library of 7000 books, a newspaper file of fifty publications, and a current subscription of 120 magazines. Latest equipment aids students with real- istic training in the newsrooms, photography laboratory, printing laboratory, radio and television studio WILL, and advertising lay- out laboratory. Included in this training is the editing of wire copy from the press services, the setting of type, and the printing of self-designed work and also the editing of film stripping. 84 College of Law Produces Experienced Men This view of the law building would impress anyone. Its new design makes it one of the most noted buildings on the campus. By correlating the problems of our ever- changing society with the tradition charac- teristic of the legal profession, the College of Law aims to train men and women for the practice of law. The training is based largely on the case method of instruction in which the students deal directly with court decisions and legis- lative acts instead of relying on textbook in- formation. Also incorporated in this train- ing is the learning of the skills of the profes- sion. To facilitate this, courses are offered in legal writing and trial procedure and ad- vocacy. The subject matter of the school encom- passes the public nature of law as well as its private aspects in such courses as admin- istrative law, labor law, trade regulations, atomic energy law and correspondingly, con- tract torts and property. The college also provides a well equipped library. To promote a sense of professional respon- sibility, the college uses an honor system gov- erned by Junior Bar Ethics Council. Dean R. N. Sullivan is the head of our School of Law which has graduated many of the finest lawyers and judges in the country. 85 As part of the teacher-training program Eileen Riccomi checks with her adviser, Professor Joseph S. Flores, her credits and hours which she needs before beginning to practice teach. Professor Flores advises all teacher-training students in Spanish. LAS: Striving to Achieve Improvement in Its Advising Eileen Riccomi in the use of a language laboratory, Professor Flores points out parts of a control tape recorder. Dean Peltason from the college of Liberal Arts and Sciences prepares to begin another day at his desk. 86 Intently concentrating on keeping his experiment over the bunsen burner, Ray Jasinski manipulates tongs in Physics. In his Chemistry laboratory, Ronald Coats carefully measures a portion of material on a balance scale. Four Major Departments In 1913 the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences was established on the Illinois campus. Since its founding it has grown into the largest college in the University. It is composed of the departments: hu- manities, physical science, social science, and life science. These in turn are comprised of some twen- ty-four specific fields of study. The largest of these four departments is that of life sciences. It has grown into such a large division that it now is a department in itself. But, it is still under the aus- pices of the college of LAS. Established in Lincoln Hall, the office of the Col- lege of Liberal Arts and Sciences handles a great number of students. Some are specializing in fields of study, and some are getting backgrounds of courses in order that they may enter a professional school. Endeavoring to improve the facilities for study, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences has initiated the language laboratories and honor sections. These laboratories help the students to speak and to under- stand the foreign languages. Hundreds of students weekly use the modern facilities offered. In the honor sections, the more advanced students have an op- portunity to study accelerated courses. During one of his astronomy classes, Raymond White, emphasises a theory by pointing it out on a model. 87 Dr. Halvor O. Halvorson, dean of the School of Life Sciences, has a big job in overseeing the expansion of the new school. School of Life Sciences Erects Research Unit Pipetting in preparation for the making of a series of dilutions for agglutenation, this student takes advantage of the new microbiology laboratory. The second unit of the School of Life Sciences is in the process of being built in the area immediately south of the present building. Financed by the Na- tional Institute of Health and by appropriations from the state, the two million dollar building will be used for research into arthropod-born diseases. With the erecting of two more units in the near future, the building will be able to house the Zoology, Botany, and Entomology departments. Next fall the school will inaugurate an undergrad- uate curriculum in biology, leading to a Bachelor of Science degree. Students obtaining this degree will be qualified to go into work in any one of the special- ized fields of biology. Located in Burrill Hall, the present School of Life Sciences was inaugurated in 1959 to facilitate coor- dination between the various departments, the col- lege of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and divisions out- side the University. The building is named in honor of the famous botanist, Dr. Thomas J. Burrill, who spent many years on the Illinois campus doing re- search. Following in his steps, the School of Life Sciences intends to have an extensive and varied research program. 88 Qualified Professionals-Library School Goals The University of Illinois Graduate School of Li- brary Science is one of four such institutions which originated in the initial decade of education for li- brarianship in the United States, being an outgrowth of the first established in the Middle West. Founded at Armour Institute in Chicago in 1893, the school moved to Urbana when a new building was available. The purpose of the Graduate School of Library Science is to equip young men and women for pro- fessional work in public libraries, school libraries, college, university, and research libraries. Prepara- tion rests mainly on basic studies which are essential for any library position, although the emphasis in particular directions is possible through the in- dividual projects such as field work. Field work con- sists of practice assignments in the various depart- ments of the University Library, and in the school and public libraries of Champaign and Urbana. At least one field trip to a metropolitan center is ar- ranged. More specialized work may be pursued in advanced courses. Programs of study are on the graduate level and lead to the degrees of Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy. Dean Lancour, dean of the Graduate School of Li- brary Science, thumbs through the card catalogue. Industriously preparing for classes, these Graduate School of Library Science students take advantage of specially de- signed library facilities. This library contains more than twenty thousand bound volumes and twenty-eight thousand reports. 89 These swimmers are not only trying to develop their leg muscles, but are practicing for their annual Terrapin Mother's Day Program. These gymnasts work many hours to develop skills. This year they put on an exhibition with the Russians. Physical Mental Fitness Go Hand in Hand Dean Staley of the School of Physical Education heads the schools of Physical Education, Recreation, Dance, and Health-Safety Education. Physical Education offers many job oppor- tunities to those who choose to major in it. Some of the possibilities are being a physical education instructor at the high school, grade school, or college level, a teacher of health education, or many varied opportunities in the field of recreation and dance. Other than the regular courses offered to students, the College of Physical Education offers numerous programs of intercollegiate and intramural sports for both graduate and undergraduate students. The college also offers a Student Rehabili- tation Center which is the largest of its kind in the world. It aids the handicapped stu- dents in getting an education by helping them with their housing, eating, recreation, transportation, and the like. For all students, the school tries to develop an interest for physical fitness and recrea- tional sports to be used in adult life. 90 Social Work Offers Many Chances for Service In the School of Social Work, one may minor in the social work curriculum, then take two years of graduate study leading to the professional degree of Master of Social Work. To be admitted into this school, applicants must be screened and reviewed by an admissions committee which has been formed. Qualifications for entering are good scholastic achievement, mastery of the English language, and a mini- mum of twenty hours in social science courses. Also the appli- cant's personality has to be suited for such work. Students may specialize ei- ther in group or in case work. Students specializing in group work have classes on the campus of the Professional Colleges in Chicago. The students specializ- ing in case work have classes ei- ther on the Urbana or Chicago campus, with field placement in nearby agencies. Some of the agencies with which the school is affiliated are Family Welfare, Child Welfare, and others. Director Marietta Stevenson coordi- nates classroom and field work in the school. A graduate student plays with a small boy at the Mental Health Clinic. The undergraduate courses serve as an introduction to such case and group work. This student in the School of Social Work and his small friend are getting plenty of target practice at the Mental Health Clinic on the Urbana campus. 91 Vet Med— Medical Research, Public Service Dr. C. A. Brandley, Dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine, is busy heading instruction, and public service of his department. The school of Veterinary Medicine trains men and women in the fields of medicine in- volving the animal kingdom. This knowledge is used not only in the cure of disease, but in the eradication, prevention, and control of diseases in animals, especially those trans- missible to man. The veterinarian is also concerned with the numerous problems of public health, particularly those which are connected directly with animal health. Two years of pre-veterinary instruction are required for admission to the school. Ap- proximately two-thirds of the fourth year is in clinical and laboratory practice, allowing the student to become familiar with the prob- lems he will come into contact with after graduation. The college is affiliated with the Agricultural Experiment Station and Exten- sion Service which allows for a great deal more practical experience, and a chance to offer more service to others. This student is performing a difficult experiment in the chemistry laboratory with all his equipment. Scissors and more scissors! These two men in the masks are performing an operation as a part of their in-service training. 92 The awarding of advanced degrees is the main distinction between a \"university\" and a \"college.\" The main purpose of undergrad- uate instruction in any field is to acquaint the student with present knowledge in that field. The basic aim of graduate instruction, on the other hand, is to prepare each student for adding knowledge in his particular field. Con- sequently, the nucleus of a graduate study is the student's research, conducted under the auspices of an already established scholar and written in a thesis. The University of Illinois Graduate Col- lege has jurisdiction over all programs that lead to advanced degrees excepting profes- sional degrees in the medical sciences. In re- cent years its enrollment has grown to the point of being one of the University's two largest colleges. Illinois, drawing people from all over the nation, now ranks third in the country in doctoral degrees awarded. Dean F. T. Hall overlooks a part of the Illinois Graduate School from his office up in the Administration Building. Illinois' Graduate College Enrollment Is High These graduate architect students are looking at a model of the Illinois State Capitol Building as it might appear in 1980. This model also includes a very detailed design of a section of Springfield that is a proposed area for the re-development. 93 J Deans of Women Help Coeds Solve Problems Coordinating many jobs is the Dean of Women, Miriam Sheldon. Assistant Dean Eunice Dowse devotes most of her time to Residence Hall planning and staff choice. Assistant Dean Joan Cochran di- rects women in the Panhellenic sys- tem. 4t ^ Assistant Dean Mary Harrison directs all Residence Counseling. All the social aspects of university life are un- der the direction of Assistant Dean Morene Kelly. Ann McNamara keeps busy with the job of Assistant Dean of Freshmen Women. 94 Services Rendered By Our Deans Are Many V Robert M. Crane, Associate Dean of Men, holds a conference with one of the many troubled students he meets each day. Carl Knox, Dean of Men, takes a break from one of the many problems that are brought to his attention through the day. Carl Knox, Dean of Men, and his staff are a busy lot through the year as they perform duties of their respective positions. They act as advisers and help students with problems of personal adjustment to campus life, how to register, how to locate suitable housing, how to find part-time employment, how to budget expenses, what loans, funds, and scholarships are available, questions about the Greek system and pledging, and interpretation of University rules. The offices of these advisers are open through the day, and staff members are always on call for emergen- cies. Any student may go to them, and inquiries from parents and guardians are welcomed. The Student Counseling Serivce provides students with the opportunity to receive some of the best pro- fessional counseling and scientific aptitude testing services available. Through these services, the stu- dent can secure information about his abilities, inter- ests, and personality, which will enable him to select more wisely a course of study and to determine what his vocation is to be. Robert O'Leary, Dean of M.I. A., and Eldon Park, Dean of Fra- ternity Men, here hold counsel with a troubled undergraduate. 95 Student Welfare Is the Dean's First Interest Dean of Students Fred H. Turner has the responsibility for making many decisions which are most important to Illini. Associate Dean of Students Edward E. Stafford takes time out from his busy schedule of appointments for relaxation. Dean R. A. Schuiteman, Assistant Dean of Foreign Students, tries to solve some of the student's problems by telephone. Behind the scenes our deans perform a great many services for us and do their utmost to facilitate higher education. Although most of us recognize Dean Turner's name and associate him with a large desk in the admin- istration building, too few of us really know what his job encompasses, and how we are affected by the decisions made in this office. Many times during our years at the University of Illinois, we benefit from the work done by Dean Fred H. Turner and his com- petent staff. Under his immediate direction are Dean R. A. Schuiteman, assistant dean of foreign students, and Dean Edward E. Stafford, associate dean of stu- dents. Student welfare is the chief concern of the Dean of Students, his office handling services from the is- suing of final approval of disapproval to a CSA bill to the solving of the various problems of foreign students. As the administrator and co-ordinator of his en- tire staff, Dean Turner handles the many technical problems of the student outside of the classroom. The University, through this office, is promoting a well balanced and organized life for each student. 96 Charles W. Sanford, Dean of Admissions and Records points to statistics map which explains, in part, the high enrollment. As Admissions Office Shows High Enrollment This last fall, enrollment in the University of Illi- nois reached a record high of 32,129 students. The Champaign-Urbana campus admitted 21,955; the Chicago Undergraduate Division at Navy Pier ad- mitted 4,516. Chicago Professional College enrolled 2,103 students, and extramural extension courses fa- cilitated 3,555. Eighty-seven per cent of the students come from the state of Illinois; all counties are represented. Students also attend from forty-nine of the fifty states, Alaska not represented, and from the terri- tories and possessions of the United States. Eighty foreign countries are represented by 1,098 students. Over twenty per cent of the students on this campus are married. Besides providing living facilities and learning equipment, the University must send out transcripts and handle other records. This past year the Office of Admissions sent out over 45,000 transcripts and handled more than 5,000 records. Applications for admission, numbering close to 17,000, were proc- essed with the help of time-saving machines. Over 300 women were turned away due to lack of living facilities. In fall of 1961, the University will inaugurate a new progressive admissions plan. Because of the limited facilities, only the best qualified of the appli- cants will be admitted, possibly the top twenty per cent of in-state high school students and the top ten per cent of out-of-state students. 97 Meeting to discuss projects of the Alumni Association, board members from left to right are — Eugene Vance, executive director and secretary; Stewart D. Daniels, president; Paul Bresee, treasurer; and not pictured is Roger Pogue, second vice-president. Association Brings Illinois Alumni Together Eugene E. Vance, secretary and executive director of the Alumni Association, handles many important transactions. After graduation from the U. of I., each graduate is invited to join the Alumni Association, the organi- zation whose purpose is to bring together Illini to work on projects for the betterment of the Univer- sity of Illinois. As a graduation present, the Asso- ciation offers a free two-year membership. There are now over 19,500 dues-paying alumni. Founded in 1873, the Alumni Association is one of the largest and oldest of its kind. One of the princi- ple functions of the Association is to keep accurate data on the 100,000-plus Illini scattered throughout the world. Illini Alumni Clubs, sponsored by the As- sociation, have been started in a great number of cities. The \"Alumni News,\" published eight times a year, is the Association's newspaper. This paper gives cov- erage to news of Illini and current events and hap- penings at the University. Eugene Vance is now the president of the Alumni Association which has its offices in the Illini Union Building on the second floor. 98 While U. of I.

Thomas, vice president; Joseph Camp- bell, director Standing, left to right: James Dilorio, secretary; Joseph Ator, director; Amos Watts, president; George Donoghue, director; James Colvin, executive director; Hjalmar Johnson, director The University of Illinois Foundation, organized in 1935, assists the University in its business affairs. Services of three kinds are performed. First among these services is acting as financial agent of the University, chiefly in borrowing money for buildings and other major improvements. Many buildings, both on the Chicago and Champaign- Urbana campuses, have been financed in this manner. Secondly, the Foundation conducts a patent pro- gram. The faculty inventions which seem to have commercial value are released to the Foundation for the seeking of patents and working out of licensing agreements with industrial firms. Returns are put into basic research. The third service is that of encouraging gifts and bequests from alumni and other friends of the Uni- versity. A program of annual giving was established in 1949 and has grown consistently due to generous support. Besides providing scholarships, fellowships, and loan funds for deserving graduate and undergradu- ate students, the Foundation, a non-profit organiza- tion, also sets up memorial funds for deceased mem- bers of the University staff and gathers volumes to enrich the University Library. The Foundation aids the University Student Rehabilitation Center as an- other project. Research in the fields of medicine, dentistry, phys- ics, chemistry, engineering, and agriculture often receives the Foundation's financial support. 99 These Men Supervise Many U of I Programs Mr. Charles Flynn handles all publicity for the University. Mr. Charles S. Haven takes charge of the physical plant. Director Miodrag Muntyan evaluates a publication of the University Press. Intercollegiate Athletics are directed by sports-minded Douglas Mills. O. S.

David Dodds Henry was born on October 21, 1905, in East McKeesport, Pennsylvania. From Pennsylvania State University Dr. Henry received three degrees. His early appointments include di- rector of the School of Liberal Arts at Battle- Creek College, Assistant Superintendent for Higher Education at the Michigan State Depart- ment of Public Instruction, and Executive Vice President of Wayne University. Doctor Henry served as president of Wayne University in De- troit from 1945 until 1952, when he was made Ex- ecutive Vice-Chancellor of New York University. On September 1, 1955, Dr. Henry became president of the University of Illinois. In national education affairs, Dr. Henry has been president of the National Commission on Ac- crediting and president of the Association for Ur- ban Universities. At present, he is a member of the noted Electoral College of the Hall of Fame for Great Americans. President Henry holds hon- orary degrees from twelve institutions, and be- longs to eleven honor societies. Dr. and Mrs. Henry like to see their team win, so they are in attendance at the football games. Pres. Henry feels that the aca- demic standards are of the utmost importance in such an institution as ours, but activities are a large part of college. 102 Writer, Instructor, Politician, and Executive Prime Minister Nehru of India is greeted by Dr. Henry at a garden party given by the President of India in New Delhi. This painting was done of Dr. Henry while he was serving as president of Wayne State University from 1945-1952. As executive of the university, Pres. Henry supervises its clinics, conferences, and off-campus extension activities. Occasionally, Dr. Henry takes time from his busy schedule to enjoy life. Here, Dr. and Mrs. Henry are shown in Hawaii. 103 BEAUTIES 104 Sylvia Johnson Photos by Heller's Studio 105 Merle List ILLIO BEAUTIES 106 Karen Olson Photos by Heller's Studio 107 Judith Schlieper ILLIO BEAUTIES 108 Marsha Smithson Photos by Heller's Studio 109 ACTIVITIES Mortar Board Ma-Wan-Da Shorter Board Torch Wa-Na-See Sachem Who's Who ini Use Variety of Activities to Add Spice and Interest to Complete Their Student Lives As important as any other aspect of campus life are the various activities, for around them revolves much of the activity necessary to make our college experiences complete. While no one should doubt the fact that we are primarily at college to receive an education and training for future jobs, just as im- portant to our future lives as good citizens are our abilities to take part in civic, religious and govern- mental affairs. The best experience for the future lies in experience gained now . . . activities fill an im- portant role in helping us to gain that experience. The importance which employers take in the idea of participation in other activities for their employees besides their jobs is shown in their interest in an ap- plicant's activities and organizations in college as well as his grades and technical knowledge. Unlike organizations, activities normally are not allied with a particular profession or group. Men from every campus background join together in the Men's Glee Club because of their joy in singing and love for good fellowship. Theatre, Star Course, ILLIO, YWCA, to mention only a few, serve this same purpose ... all afford the opportunity for stu- dents with like interests to find satisfaction through uniting in common projects and goals. Activities are an excellent place to meet other peo- ple outside of classes and residences. Many life-long friendships, and even romances, are formed through associations in campus activities. Besides active par- ticipation in sports, no other diversification from classes and studies can help to release so much en- ergy and create the relaxation needed from the rig- ors of studying. So varied are the activities offered at Illinois that there is little excuse for any student not finding at least one to his particular liking. Besides those al- ready mentioned, there are those centered around housing groups such as Panhellenic and Women's Group System, Interfraternity Council, Men's Inde- pendent Association and Men's Residence Halls As- sociation. There is Student Senate with its important representative body for the entire campus. Campus Chest, WPGU, music organizations, the DAILY IL- LINI, all give satisfaction to those participating and to those benefitting from the services rendered. Here lies one of the points most in favor of activi- ties . . . that while giving satisfaction to the indi- vidual for his efforts, a great deal is given to others. Foremost of the examples of this is the Illini Union. Perhaps no other activity offers a more varied list of opportunities for student participation. From dances, to music hours, to Stunt Show and Spring Musical . . . International programs, movies, social fo- rums . . . over thirty major campus events help stu- dents utilize their leisure hours. Also important is the YMCA with its interesting and dynamic pro- gram of forums, speeches and debates on almost any current subject of controversy and interest to us as students of an intellectually aware community. Certainly there are criticisms offered as to the worth of some activities and to the time required by some of them. All aspects of our life need re-evalua- tion and consequent changes to be made. Activity leaders are striving to make changes for the good of their particular activity and for activities as a part of student life. It is up to each person to figure out exactly how much time he can spend and then find an activity to fit. Criticisms, yes, but rewards and values are cer- tainly more important . . . values not only for the person involved, but for the university community as well. As in all aspects of a student's life . . . sports organizations, residence groups, social . . . activities at their best can be found at Illinois. 113 ■ MORTAR BOARD Jean Ratcliffe, President Marie Anderson Brenda Braun Marianna Brown Sharon Crowley Sandra Curtis Beth Dohme Carolyn Franks Edwina Garner Martha Gilkerson Lisa Grable Judith Hildenbrand Beverly Kimes Janet Meadors Janet Monier Ann Morgan Katherine O'Brien Karen Person Virginia Seiler Martha Solomon Linda Wall Elissa Weaver 114 MA-WAN-DA David Rademacher, President Robert Armstrong Paul Arneson William Brown Charles Coane Harold D'Orazio Dale Dufour John Easterbrook Richard Hutchison David Kuhn Gregory Liptak Harry Mathews Raymond Pitton Donald Quest Robert Reger Harold Roos Simon Sheridan James Shonkwiler Thomas Sykes Robert Telleen Frank Voris illiam Sawtell William Yontz 115 Shorter Board Gail Pierce, President Margaret Allen Sally Smith Andersen Sandra Ayres Margaret Belsley Melissa Blanke Melinda Bresee Mary Brown Carolyn Curtis Joan Dilatush Sue Divan Mary Sue Drendel June Fritsch Julia Gates Mary Geissman Jean Goodmon Janet Greenberg Phoebe Kosfeld Margaret LaBarre Elizabeth Lawler Judith Lyman Carol Marvin Sharon O'Neill Diane Parks Lois Rose Deborah Rothholtz Judith Roudez Frances Swartz Carol Ufkes Virginia Weibel Sally Williamson Janice Wright Susan Sterrett# President Marilyn Austin Julia Bodman Ann Brown Bonnie Brown Karen Bunde Marianne Burgbacher Bonnie Byrns Diane Courtright Louise Darby Mary Ehler Linda Evans Sheryl Fiester Margaret Fleming Sharon Garman Gaila Grubb Joyce Hale Terry Heads Barbara Hodam Barbara Hutchens Martha Huxtable Donna Johnston Linda Joy Linda Kahn Annemarie Klink Nance Kohlenberger Ann Macke Dawn Mathre Mary Ann McGuire Barbara Meyers Judith Miller Jacquelyn Moore Martha Mulliken Lois Nestle Carol Ostrom Virginia Pagels Linda Passent Penny Peterson Sue Potts Barbara Rashbaum Ellen Reimann Helen Rodemer Lynore Rossetti Roberta Sax Patricia Smith Margaret Sprehe Judith St. Clair Barbara Sternaman Sharon Sweeney Mary Theobald 116 Wa-Na-See Joseph Atkinson Theodore Beastall Richard Brent Mark Buch Bruce Bueschel Charles Campbell Edwin Epstein Hugh Fogler Donald Friedman John Goodrich Donald Hartter Richard Jarrard William Kubitz John Lesak Russell Lloyd Lawrence Kuzela -

The first snow storm at Illinois this year found the Union as busy as ever. As usual, the back entrance received many busy activity leaders, faces red from the cold, penetrating wind. Since then, the construction of the new addition has begun.

The Union serves all Illini as the activity cen- ter. In addition to the organized Illini Union Student Activities found in Room 322 of the Union, other campus organizations use the Union's facilities for committee meetings and general office area. In fact, the need for enlarged facilities at the Illini Union has been felt severely, and this year the new addition was begun. Both the Union Board, consisting of student direc- tors and the advisers, and the Building Staff have planned carefully so that a maximum of efficiency in spacing and arrangement may be reached. The new addition will double the amount of space now available for the Union and other organizations. It is being built directly south of the present struc- ture and will be separated from it by a long, patio- like section. The date for completion has been set for the fall of 1963. and Home of IUSA, Begins Building Addition Building Staff — Standing: Arthur Sawyer, Charles Wertz, Robert McNabb, Kermit Clark, Clarence Leverenz, John Balogna Seated: Carolyn Cabalek, Irene Pierson, Earl Finder, Stella Cameron, Marjorie Arkwright Assistant Social Directors — Standing: John Carroll, Barbara Reed Ettabelle Schwartz Seated: Jo Anne Kirk, Irene Pierson, Irene Pierson, social director Social Directors, Student Directors, and Many Because of the many activities which the Union sponsors, committees and directors execute their responsibilities according to a definite structure. The directors deal with formulation of policies, long-range planning, budget studies, and continuous evaluation. Directly responsible to them are the de- partment heads who supervise the administration of a designated group of Illini Union sponsored pro- grams and events. Each of these program commit- tees is headed by a major chairman who plans and delegates the work to be done in connection with his specific program. Each major chairman has a corps of committee chairmen who work with one particular facet of the program such as costumes, publicity, or programs. Committee members then work directly with details.
