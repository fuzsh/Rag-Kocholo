The loss was very bitter for The Deutsche Bank Skyliners after a close four point loss in the 2005 final in Bamberg, this time, it came down to a few seconds between winning and losing. 'The way we played tonight is the way we have played the whole season. We are very disappointed since we have worked very hard for many years to get to this point. However at the same time, we know that we had a super season. The team gave 200%. In the last minutes, it was the little things that decided the game. A rebound and missed free throw is what was missing from a win, but that is how sport is', stressed Skyliner sports director Kamil Novak/a> For The Brose Baskets Bamberg, it was a mission fulfilled as they had been playing exceptional basketball since their cup win in Frankfurt and were without doubt the best team in the BEKO BBL. 'We are so happy that we won. This was the biggest win in my career. We played very hard and never gave up. Frankfurt fought hard as well, but we held up against them. In the last minutes, we had better nerves than Frankfurt', commented Anton Gavel (189-G-84, agency: Pro One Sports). 'Bamberg came out strong and hit big shots and free throws all game long', expressed Skyliner American Grayson Moyer (196-G-86, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Humboldt St.). 'We showed all season our fighting spirit and heart. When things werent going well, we never gave up. We seemed to play better with our backs to the wall', said Skyliner forward Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.).\n\n500 faithful Skybembel fans of The Deutsche Bank Skyliners had travelled to Bamberg to game five which added to the already very active and loud atmosphere in the Jako arena. One of the biggest problems in the Bamberg series had been the inability of The Deutsche Bank Skyliners to come out of the starting blocks quickly as The Brose Baskets Bamberg jumped out on a 10-0 lead. Predrag Suput (200-F-77, agency: Beo Basket) got Bamberg on the board with a three pointer from the wing and then scored on a layup getting a quick pass from Casey Jacobsen (198-G/F-81, college: Stanford) off the penetration. John Goldsberry (191-G-82, agency: Pro One Sports, college: NC-Wilmington) hit two free throws and made then a three pointer at the top of the key. Frankfurt was having problems with the Bamberg zone defense. Bamberg had a high intensity on offense and defense and Frankfurt seemed a bit nervous and were taking to quick shots on offense. Frankfurt then finally got on the board as Greg Jenkins (206-F/C-82, college: Iona) tip toed around Suput. Frankfurt knew that they would not be able to play set offense for 40 minutes, but would need to run on offense as well. Frankfurt wasnt able to run early, but got a Derrick Allen (203-F-80, agency: Pro One Sports, college: Mississippi) lay up after he and Quantez Robertson (190-G-84, college: Auburn)n got offensive rebounds as Frankfurt trailed only 12-4. Bamberg had a quick rhythm on offense and were hitting their shotsAnton Gavel (189-G-84, agency: Pro One Sports) nailed a three pointer from the wing and Brian Roberts (188-G-85, agency: Arik Krayn Services) from the top of the key as Bamberg led 18-6. Bamberg was showing early that they wanted to win the game a bit more as they were diving on the floor for any loose ball. Roberts and Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.) traded baskets at the end of the first quarter as The Brose Baskets Bamberg led 22-8. 'Bamberg had a good start like in game three. Frankfurt had problems finding a rhythm on offense', stated BEKO BBL chef Jan Pommer. The Brose Baskets Bamberg were shooting 54% from the field and 50% from outside while The Deutsche Bank Skyliners were shooting 21% from the field and 0% from outside. Frankfurt had the slight edge under the boards 9-8, but had four turnovers and Bamberg zero.\n\nThe game of basketball continues to be a sport of runs as The Brose Baskets Bamberg showed in the first quarter, now it was time for The Deutsche Bank Skyliners to get back into the game and did with a 9-0 run cutting the Bamberg lead to 22-17. Frankfurt knew that they would have to get started on offense or suffer and have Bamberg extend their lead to more. Allen started the run with a hook shot over Elton Brown (206-F/C-83, agency: Elfus-Siegel Management (ESM), college: Virginia), captain Pascal Roller (180-G-76) made a pull up jumper and Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.) a bomb from the top of the key. Suput reacted by scoring in the zone over Doliboa and Roller hit another three pointer now from the wing cutting the Bamberg lead to 24-20. One big strength in this series for Bamberg was their ability to draw many fouls and the other was their relentless penetrations in the zoneAnton Gavel scored in the lane coming hard to the glass, Jacobsen made two free throws and Roberts a fade away jumper for the 30-20 Bamberg lead. Frankfurt gained some momentum in the last minutes going on a 7-2 run to trail 32-27 after two quarters. After Jenkins and Roberts traded free throws, Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.) scored inside. With four seconds to play, Pascal Roller (180-G-76) brought the ball up court and attempted a buzzer beater three pointer in traffic and nailed it as he led his team back into the dressing room with a big Boris Becker fist and roar as loud as the king of the jungle. 'Frankfurt started to fight more and were defending better while Bamberg lost some intensity', stated BEKO BBL chef Jan Pommer. The Brose Baskets Bamberg were shooting 40% from the field and 30% from the three point line while The Deutsche Bank Skyliners were shooting 33% from the field and 36% from the three point line. Frankfurt had the rebounding lead 18-15, but had seven turnovers and Frankfurt only three.\n\nIn the third quarter, The Brose Baskets Bamberg started strong and put The Deutsche Bank Skyliners into a hole as they trailed by as much as 16 points. Frankfurt seemed asleep as Bamberg was scoring at ease and taking advantage of the mistakes of the opponent. Gavel started the scoring binge cutting into the lane getting a nice pass from Suput. Elton Brown (206-F/C-83, agency: Elfus-Siegel Management (ESM), college: Virginia) got busy as he got away from Dragan Labovic (207-C/F-87) and got a nice feed from Goldsberry for two quick points. Jacobsen and Suput hit free throws as Bamberg led 43-29 and the Frankfurt dreams of a second BEKO BBL title seemed about as distant again as South Africa winning the 2010 World Cup. The Brose Baskets Bamberg were able to keep their big comfortable lead for a few more minutes. Aubrey Reese (183-G-78, agency: Interperformances, college: Murray St.) made a catch and pop jumper and Elton Brown (206-F/C-83, agency: Elfus-Siegel Management (ESM), college: Virginia) got his own offensive rebound and scoring as Frankfurt trailed 45-31. Allen then scored retrieving a quick pass from Jenkins, but Frankfurt couldnt give themselves any favors on defense as Bamberg kept scoring easily as Gavel sprinted around Jenkins and scored on a lay up as Bamberg led 47-35. However Frankfurt kept their best for last going on a 11-2 run to cut the Bamberg lead to 49-46. Aubrey Reese (183-G-78, agency: Interperformances, college: Murray St.) really took command and the offense into his own hands. Reese started scoring on the penetration and then gave Doliboa a pretty pass for an easy layup. Reese then made a fade away jump shot banking it in off the back board. Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.) had some misfortune making only 2/4 free throws as Bamberg only led 49-43. Reese then hit a three pointer from the top of the key as Frankfurt only trailed 49-46 and suddenly the Frankfurt title chances seemed about as good as those of Germany and Argentina at the World Cup at the moment. Frankfurt then got unlucky as Greg Jenkins (206-F/C-82, college: Iona) fouled John Goldsberry (191-G-82, agency: Pro One Sports, college: NC-Wilmington) behind the three point line and Goldsberry buried all three free throws as Bamberg led 52-46. 'Bamberg came out hot hitting their shots which were contested and once we got our rhythm, we started getting more stops', said San Diego native Grayson Moyer (196-G-86, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Humboldt St.). The Brose Baskets Bamberg were shooting 41% from the field and 33% from the parking lot while The Deutsche Bank Skyliners were shooting 37% from the field and 31% from the parking lot. Frankfurt led the rebound duel 27-24, but had eight turnovers while Bamberg had only five.\n\nThe Deutsche Bank Skyliners were only trailing by six points after three quarters and anyone who knew just a little about basketball knew that a comeback would be happening sooner or later. Tibor Pleiss started the scoring in the fourth quarter with a lay in and Jimmy Mckinney hit a wide open three pointer as Bamberg still led 54-49. After Suput made one of two free throws, it was Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.) that nailed a three pointer. Doliboa who had gotten less and less minutes in the playoffs under new coach Gordie Herbert came to life in the last quarter. Frankfurt trailed only 55-52. 'I was not happy with my missed free throws at the end, but nice to go out on a solid game, but I would rather have sacrificed a bad game for the title', stressed Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.). Frankfurt continued to fight as Mckinney made another jumper cutting the Bamberg lead to 57-54. Bamberg kept working on the weak spot of Frankfurt getting into the zone on hard penetrations as Jacobsen scored with his left hand as Bamberg led 59-54. Frankfurt then had nice ball movement as Roller came into the zone from the wing and kicked out the ball to an open Doliboa at the wing and he drowned a three pointer as Frankfurt trailed only 59-56. However Frankfurt continued to have breakdowns on defense as Tibor Pleiss was left all alone under the hoop and got a dunk, but it was Doliboa with the hot hand again with a three pointer from the wing as Frankfurt trailed only 61-59. Bamberg was doing a super job not succumbing to the Frankfurt comeback pressure, but getting points on offense. Mark Worthington scored inside after cutting to the hoop and getting a pass from Jacobsen, but it was Pascal Mr reliable Roller that nailed a three pointer after Mckinney penetrated nicely from the wing finding the captain as Bamberg led only 63-62.\n\nPleiss then made a fade away jumper over Doliboa and Reese made 2/3 free throws as Frankfurt trailed only 65-64. Doliboa then missed two free throws and Gavel let Frankfurt pay with a tough contested three pointer as Bamberg led 68-64 with 34 seconds to play. Frankfurt did a good job only taking three seconds off the clock as Roller penetrated into the zone surprising Bamberg with a reverse layup as Frankfurt only trailed 68-66 with 30 seconds to play. After two Goldsberry free throws, it was Pascal Roller (180-G-76) that hit a tough three pointer runner as Bamberg only led 70-69. Goldsberry then made free throws as Frankfurt trailed 71-69. Roller then made only free throws as Frankfurt trailed 71-70. 'Roller was not fault at the end for missing the free throw. Without him, we would never have been able to have the chance of winning this game at the end', stressed Dominik Bahiense de Mello (190-G-85, agency: Pro One Sports). Goldsberry then got fouled with six seconds to play. He made the first free throw, but intentionally missed the second leaving a high rebound that skipped near the sideline which Goldsberry saved, but threw high into the air. When it came down there were a few seconds remaining as a maze of players were lunging for the ball as time elapsed giving Bamberg the 2010 BEKO BBL title. 'The last play was very smart by Goldsberry as he got a high rebound and then saved the ball and then threw the ball high in the air. I really like his game. He is the floor general and played outstanding', stressed Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.). The fourth quarter was a dog fight. Seth was hitting big shots and unfortunately we came up a bit short, commented Grayson Moyer (196-G-86, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Humboldt St.).\n\nThe Brose Baskets Bamberg were led by Anton Gavel with 16 points. John Goldsberry (191-G-82, agency: Pro One Sports, college: NC-Wilmington) added 15 points. Tibor Pleiss chipped in with 10 points and 12 rebounds and Predrag Suput (200-F-77, agency: Beo Basket) contributed 10 points. The Deutsche Bank Skyliners were led by Pascal Roller (180-G-76) with 20 points, ive rebounds and five assists. Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.) contributed 19 points and 11 rebounds. Aubrey Reese (183-G-78, agency: Interperformances, college: Murray St.) chipped in with 13 points.\n\nThe difference were two points between a win and loss and the team stats also showed that there was little difference between both teams. The Brose Baskets Bamberg shot 43 from the field and 33% from outside while The Deutsche Bank Skyliners shot 43% from the field and 42% from outside. Bamberg won the rebounding duel 35-32 and had eight turnovers while Frankfurt had nine. Both teams had ten assists, but Bamberg won the points in the paint 30-20. 'We had good team focus on defense. We also played good offense from the eight minute of the game until the end executing well and getting open shots', stressed Skyliner sport director Kamil Novak. It was a long season and some things will never be forgotten for this so successful season. 'We went through a lot together and I will always remember the togetherness and how we helped each other out', said Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.). 'We had many ups and downs and it is amazing how we went from a team fighting for the last playoff spot to losing by only two points in game five of the final', expressed Grayson Moyer (196-G-86, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Humboldt St.). 'I will always remember the 12 crazy guys that never gave up. Often the opponent thought we were on the ground, but we always came back, because we had a huge heart', warned Kamil Novak\n\nThe Deutsche Bank Skyliners Allow Predrag Suput To Get Hot And Get Foiled In Their Comeback Attempt In The Last Seconds Losing The 2010 BEKO BBL Cup Final 76-75 To The Brose Baskets Bamberg -\n\nThe comeback attempts by The Deutsche Bank Skyliners this season have been as often and usual as Paris Hilton changing her shoes, Tiger Woods coming up with a new apology for his wife each day, sadly Lindsay Lohan running around drunk as if it was a home work assignment and Mark Mcgrath being mistaken for Ethan Hawke, so with four minutes remaining in the BEKO BBL cup final and the club back 74-63, there was no surprise that they would stage a comeback, but were denied in the last seconds their third club title as The Brose Baskets Bamberg prevailed 76-75. Playing back to back and only having 18 hours to recuperate from the thrilling 61-59 win in the semi final against The Eisbaeren Bremerhaven might of played a toll on the total effort of the team as fatigue was something that couldnt be erased. 'We had no energy today. We gave all our focus yesterday. Our problem is that we have problems starting tough and aggressive against top teams. If we dont do this, it is always difficult to win. There was a perfect atmosphere and I am just very unhappy for the fans. We wanted to give the fans the cup. We will have to win it for them next season', stressed Skyliner assistant coach Engin Gencoglu/a> . Frankfurt has lost the last three games by a total combined score of five points and it was no surprise that the players were disappointed and reserved after the loss. Even captain Pascal Roller (180-G-76) who is not only the best interview partner for the Skyliners, but it sometimes seems like he could start his own school of speech because of his fluid and solid rhetoric was very terse with his answer. 'There isnt to much one can say after a game like this except that we didnt reach our goal of winning the cup', stressed Pascal Roller (180-G-76). For The Brose Baskets Bamberg, it was their first title again since the 2007 BEKO BBL title and for coach Chris Fleming it was his second cup win after the Artland Dragons victory in 2008. 'Each title is different. With Artland, we had been having a consistent season, but with Bamberg this season, we had a tough start and had high expectations and were struggling. But in the last 25 games, we have a 20-5 record, so we have showed that we are a good team and results can be achieved with hard work', warned Chris Fleming .\n\nEven though The Deutsche Bank Skyliners never led in the game, they never gave up and continued fighting back, the game remained exciting and with the NCAA March Madness just having ended and the loud arena and faithful fan support of all teams in the BEKO BBL Cup, it seemed like the March Madness had returned for a weekend to Germany. 'It is hard to rate this game to a certain exciting game, but I would say that you could compare the BEKO BBL Cup to the NCAA tournament with all the different fan groups of the teams rooting on their teams', stated Bamberg coach Chris Fleming . Skyliner Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.) loved the atmosphere as he easily saw how big a difference there was from a regular BEKO BBL game and a cup game. 'This was another typical exciting game and was different from a regular game, because it was a championship game. You could see how much passion was involved in this game and if I had to compare the excitement to a game then I would have to go with my home team the Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers', stressed Skyliner forward Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.). About an hour after the excitement of the game had been over, a new excitement started for the players of Bamberg as they were going back to their team bus and getting celebrated by the fans. Bamberg guard Brian Roberts (188-G-85, agency: Arik Krayn Services) was thrilled with the win carrying a little green frog and having much respect for their teddy bear mascot. 'This was a very exciting game and one of the most exciting games that I have ever played in. The atmosphere was just crazy. The little green frog is from my daughter and it is for good luck and I bring with me wherever we play. Our teddy bear mascot may be soft, but he knows when to get food to be strong. He helped us today eating and being strong for us in this win', added Brian Roberts (188-G-85, agency: Arik Krayn Services).\n\nThe atmosphere in the BEKO BBL final in the sold out Ballsporthalle seemed to be a tick higher than in the semi final. As the arena got dark and the players were introduced, one saw the flashing dark blue lights of the necklaces that were blinking all throughout the arena giving a faint reminder of some big city skyline like New York with the glitter bringing an added special flair to the placeMurat Didin (agency: Interperformances ) started Dominik Bahiense de Mello (190-G-85, agency: Pro One Sports) for Frankfurt for a second time as it seemed like he had practiced very well the last week taking the spot from American Grayson Moyer (196-G-86, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Humboldt St.) Frankfurt knew that they could not allow a slow start, but in the first minutes, both teams were on separate pages as The Brose Baskets Bamberg came out with more intensity and right away got Serb forward Predrag Suput (200-F-77, agency: Beo Basket) inserted into the offense. He scored the first five points of the game scoring an open three pointer and then making a lay in as only 33 seconds had elapsed. Frankfurt got on the scoreboard as Derrick Allen (203-F-80, agency: Pro One Sports, college: Mississippi) snuck past the Bamberg defense scoring on the transition. Bamberg continued to run their offense like a clock work going on a 15-5 run. Frankfurt had problems finding their rhythm, Allen was getting the ball in the low post, but was a bit unlucky scoring and the team was living off individual plays. Bamberg continued to get the motor of Suput running as he made a fade away jumper of Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.) and a three pointer. Quantez Robertson (190-G-84, college: Auburn) scored twice on hard penetration moves including a spin dance to the hoop. Suput now took a short rest on offense as now it was time for ex Giessen 46er Anton Gavel (189-G-84, agency: Pro One Sports) to score six unanswered points scoring a nice lay in after a feed from Tibor Pleiss, an off balance jumper and a tip in.\n\nThe Brose Baskets Bamberg were leading 20-7 as the Frankfurt faithful Skybembel fans were already getting a sour taste of Freak city basketball. In the last minutes of the first quarter, Frankfurt suffered many unneeded fouls and ex Skyliner Robert Garrett (193-G-77, agency: SportsTalent) silenced the Ballsporthalle except for the corner where the Bamberg fans were with a first quarter buzzer beater hitting a three pointer as Bamberg led 25-12 after 10 minutes. 'It was really important that Bamberg established Predrag Suput (200-F-77, agency: Beo Basket) in the offense quickly. Frankfurt couldnt get their offense going and had too many individual plays', stressed Ratiopharm Ulm coach Mike Taylor. 'We had a bad start and we were unable to control Suput and it hurt even more that he got going', said Pascal Roller (180-G-76). The Brose Baskets Bamberg were shooting 63% from the field and 43% from outside while The Deutsche Bank Skyliners were shooting 33% from the field and 0% from outside. The rebounds were deadlocked at nine, but Frankfurt already had four turnovers and Bamberg only one.\n\nIn the second quarter, Murat Didin opted to finally get the Frankfurt inside game established after he had been subbing centers Dragan Labovic (207-C/F-87) Marius Nolte (206-C-81, agency: Limelight Hoops) and Greg Jenkins (206-F/C-82, college: Iona) in frequently, it was Dragan Labovic who drew fouls and even did like a guard stepping up and making a steal and scoring and Pascal Roller (180-G-76) nailed a three pointer bringing Frankfurt back to 20-28. The Frankfurt onslaught continued as Derrick Allen (203-F-80, agency: Pro One Sports, college: Mississippi) hit another three pointer and before any one really realized the team had gone on a 12-3 run to cut the Bamberg lead to 28-24. Bamberg had had a small lull on offense as Frankfurt was contesting many shots, but Bamberg was hitting their open jumpers as John Goldsberry gave Bamberg the 33-26 lead with a three pointer. Captain Pascal Roller (180-G-76) dropped another three pointer cutting the Bamberg lead to 33-29. Frankfurt was threatening on offense, but were too lack luster on defense as Bamberg found ways to get to the line as Suput and Elton Brown (206-F/C-83, agency: Elfus-Siegel Management (ESM), college: Virginia) got fouled inside. Bamberg was able to get away a bit again and lead 40-30 with a Suput three pointer. Both teams then traded baskets as Dragan Labovic made a fade away jumper and Suput a beautiful reverse lay up. In the last minute, the emotions of both teams heightened as Aubrey Reese (183-G-78, agency: Interperformances, college: Murray St.) suffered a unsportsmanlike and technical foul and Elton Brown (206-F/C-83, agency: Elfus-Siegel Management (ESM), college: Virginia) a technical foul, but it didnt really matter since The Brose Baskets Bamberg led43-32 at half time. 'Frankfurt had more intensity in their game and were settling in their offense. The Roller three pointers were big', added Ratiopharm ulm coach Mike Taylor. The Brose Baskets Bamberg were shooting 50% from the field and 43% from the three point line while The Deutsche Bank Skyliners were shooting 45% from the field and 43% from the three point line. Frankfurt had the 16-14 rebound edge, but seven turnovers while Bamberg had only four.\n\nThe Brose Baskets Bamberg came out fresh from the intermission going on a 5-0 run as Mr everything Beckham Wyrick (198-F-83, agency: Pro One Sports, college: NC-Wilmington) blocked Labovic and then sprinted out to the corner and made a jump shot, and Anton Gavel (189-G-84, agency: Pro One Sports) nailed a three pointer. Frankfurt then responded with their own 5-0 run as Derrick Allen (203-F-80, agency: Pro One Sports, college: Mississippi) made a lay up over Pleiss and Aubrey Reese (183-G-78, agency: Interperformances, college: Murray St.) made a three pointer to cut the Bamberg lead to 48-37. Bamberg extended their lead to 52-37 with Mark Worthington free throws and a Pleiss shot hard to the glass over Labovic. Frankfurt had suffered some untimely turnovers, but Jimmy McKinney (192-G-83, agency: Strategic Sports, college: Missouri) and Derrick Allen (203-F-80, agency: Pro One Sports, college: Mississippi) missed key lay ups. Frankfurt had gas in their tank on offense as Mckinney hit a three pointer, but the offense of Bamberg continued to be solid that if the inside was closed, then they went outside and continued to hit their shots with consistency as Anton Gavel (189-G-84, agency: Pro One Sports) dropped a three pointer for the 55-42. Bamberg center Elton Brown (206-F/C-83, agency: Elfus-Siegel Management (ESM), college: Virginia) made a spin move and basket and Allen a free throw as The Brose Baskets Bamberg led 58-44. Frankfurt was unable to get some consecutive stops as the Bamberg offense was very versatile and they always found ways to score which Frankfurt couldnt turn off. 'Our game flow was better, but we were still stagnant and giving up easy baskets', said Ohio native Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.). The Brose Baskets Bamberg were shooting 46% from the field and 40% from the parking lot while The Deutsche Bank Skyliners were shooting 35% from the field and 36% from the parking lot. Frankfurt was leading the rebound battle 27-24 and both teams had eight turnovers.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, The Deutsche Bank Skyliners gave The Brose Baskets Bamberg a first taste of a first mini comeback by starting with a 6-0 run as Derrick Allen (203-F-80, agency: Pro One Sports, college: Mississippi) got the ball in the low post went to the hoop and scored with a mini hook shot, Reese then made a three pointer and Doliboa a free throw cutting the Bamberg lead to 58-50. Bamberg finally got out of their funk and went on a 4-0 run doing damage inside as Elton Brown (206-F/C-83, agency: Elfus-Siegel Management (ESM), college: Virginia) made a lay up and Suput made a nice fake and move around De Mello as Bamberg led 62-52 again. Brown made a turn around shot over Greg Jenkins (206-F/C-82, college: Iona) and Gavel a three pointer as Bamberg had another big 67-52 lead and slowly bringing the Skyliner faithful back to reality about the possibilities of a loss creeping slower. Dragon Labovic sometimes takes too many three pointers than needed for a big man, but who will complain when the team is down by 15 points when he hits one. Reese then followed with a jumper cutting the Bamberg lead to 68-57. Frankfurt still seemed far far away from ever finding the lead, but giving up was not in their mind frame. After a Suput jumper from the wing, Allen followed with a lay in and Labovic with a lay up after getting a pretty pass from Mckinney as Frankfurt trailed only 70-61.\n\nSeth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.) had fouled out, but Frankfurt kept pushing, but Bamberg wasnt making life easy. After a Labovic lay in over Suput, Roller came down with his classic pull up jumper, but was surprised as Brian Roberts (188-G-85, agency: Arik Krayn Services) came out of no where with a block leading to a jumper from him as Bamberg led 74-63. The time and point score brought back memories to the away game in MBC as Frankfurt came back to win. 36 minutes had elapsed, but Frankfurt still had energy and started their comeback as Reese scored and then Super Tez Robertson made a steal and lay up as Frankfurt only trailed 74-67. After a Bamberg stop, captain Pascal Roller (180-G-76) once gain showed why he is the teams most reliable shooter as he nailed a three pointer as Frankfurt only trailed 74-70. Suput then missed two free throws giving Frankfurt another golden opportunity to score with a minute left as Jimmy McKinney sprinted down the court and scored on a lay up cutting the Bamberg lead to 74-72. Frankfurt had a 28-16 quarter point lead at this point. Frankfurt then fouled Suput, but this time he hit both shots. Bamberg led 76-72 and with less than 20 seconds, Frankfurt came back on offense and Reese hit an open three pointer as Frankfurt trailed only 76-75 with four seconds. Bamberg quickly made a long in bounds pass and Frankfurt didnt get the ball back thus losing by one point. 'We had good looks in the comeback and they missed more shots. We had the momentum, but ran out of time', stressed Seth Doliboa (203-F-80, agency: Hart Sports Mngm, college: Wright St.). 'Frankfurt never gave up at the end. We were not so strong with the ball and suffered turnovers and were fortunate to win at the end', commented Brian Roberts (188-G-85, agency: Arik Krayn Services). 'We gave good hustle at the end, but it simply wasnt enough against a top team like Bamberg', warned Engin Gencoglu . 'We always believed that we could win the game even as Frankfurt was coming back. We stayed confident and got the job done', stated Bamberg coach Chris Fleming .\n\nThe Brose Baskets Bamberg were led by Predrag Suput (200-F-77, agency: Beo Basket) with 26 points, eight rebounds and three assists. Anton Gavel (189-G-84, agency: Pro One Sports) chipped in with 13 points and four assists. Elton Brown (206-F/C-83, agency: Elfus-Siegel Management (ESM), college: Virginia) added 12 points and four rebounds. The Deutsche Bank Skyliners were led by Dragan labovic with 20 points and four rebounds. Derrick Allen (203-F-80, agency: Pro One Sports, college: Mississippi) chipped in with 16 points and six assists. Aubrey Reese (183-G-78, agency: Interperformances, college: Murray St.) added 14 points, three rebounds and five assists.\n\nThe Deutsche Bank Skyliners never led in this 2010 BEKO BBL final and lost with only one point. If one dissects the stats, one quickly comes to the conclusion how one could have lost this game. Frankfurt never led, but their stats werent worse then their opponent Bamberg. Frankfurt shot 44% from the field and Bamberg only 46%. Frankfurt shot 41% from outside and Bamberg 36%. Frankfurt won the rebounding duel 38-32 and had only eight turnovers while Bamberg had 10. If there were any reasons to how Frankfurt could have lost this game despite the better stats then it is assistant coach Engin Gencoglu . 'On defesne, we let up easy points in the paint. We also were unable to stop Suput at the start. We let him get going and we were behind until the end', stressed Engin Gencoglu . On Monday April 12th, all of Freak city will be in the Jako arena at 18:00 to celebrate the Bamberg title and for some players it was their first win. 'This is my first title and its a great feeling. We have a great group of guys and I hope that there will be more to come', warned Brian Roberts (188-G-85, agency: Arik Krayn Services). It is never easy losing to the Brose Baskets Bamberg, but what is worse when they win by one point on your home court in a title game. The comeback was a highlight in the game, but in the end no one will remember the comeback, but moreover the cup win by Bamberg. 'The comeback was great. We showed again the strength and moral of team, but in the end it doesnt matter if we lost by one point or 10 points, because we lost the title and that is all that counts', stressed Pascal Roller (180-G-76). Frankfurt is currently in 8th place and have teams like the Artland Dragons, MBC Wolves and EnBW Ludwigsburg breathing down their necks and have four games remaining where three will be real tough. Now Frankfurt will have to show their character in staying in the playoffs boundry. The Deutsche Bank Skyliners host BG Goettingen onApril 18th at 17:00.\n\nGoettingen win EuroChallenge tournament -\n\nFinal Goettingen - Krasnie Krilya 83-75\n\nGoettingen claimed the 2010 EuroChallenge title.
