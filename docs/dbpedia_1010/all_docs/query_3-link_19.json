While the PD-1 pathway has received considerable attention for its role in contributing to the maintenance of T cell exhaustion in chronic infection and cancer, the PD-1 pathway plays diverse roles in regulating host immunity beyond T cell exhaustion. Here, we discuss emerging concepts in the PD-1 pathway, including (1) the impact of PD-1 inhibitors on diverse T cell differentiation states including effector and memory T cell development during acute infection, as well as T cell exhaustion during chronic infection and cancer (2) the role of PD-1 in regulating Treg cells, NK cells, and ILCs, and (3) the functions of PD-L1/B7-1 and PD-L2/RGMb/neogenin interactions. We then discuss the emerging use of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade in the treatment of early-stage cancers and how the timing of PD-1 blockade may improve clinical outcomes. The diverse binding partners of PD-1 and its associated ligands, broad expression patterns of the receptors and ligands, differential impact of PD-1 modulation on cells depending on location and state of differentiation, and timing of PD-1 blockade add additional layers of complexity to the PD-1 pathway, and are important considerations for improving the efficacy and safety of PD-1 pathway therapeutics.\n\nKeywords: PD-1 pathway, cancer immunotherapy, immune regulation, neoadjuvant, T cell exhaustion\n\nI. Introduction:\n\nThe inhibitory receptor Programmed Death-1 (PD-1 or CD279) was discovered in a T cell hybridoma undergoing cell death in 1992 [1], hence its name. The structural similarity of PD-1 to CTLA-4, CD28, and KIRs led to the hypothesis that the ligand for PD-1 might be a B7 or MHC class I family member. The discovery of new B7 gene family members and the search for their CD28/CTLA-4 like binding partners led to the identification of the interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1 (CD274; B7-H1) in 2000 and PD-L2 (CD273; B7-DC) in 2001, thereby defining the PD-1 pathway [2-5].\n\nThough its name comes from the belief that it would be involved in T cell death during thymic selection, studies in the PD-1 knockout showed no change in thymic T cell death [6]. Further work revealed that PD-1 does not directly regulate the induction of apoptosis or programmed cell death, but instead is a negative regulator of T cell responses. The PD-1 inhibitory receptor has been named an “immune checkpoint”, referring to its role as a gatekeeper of immune responses. Decades of basic research have contributed to dissecting the cellular and molecular functions of the PD-1 pathway to understand how inhibitory signals through this pathway control immune functions and homeostasis, and we are still continuing to unravel the specific impact of this pathway in both preclinical and clinical settings.\n\nFollowing the discovery of the immunoinhibitory function of the PD-1 pathway [3, 4, 7] and the immunostimulatory effects of blocking the PD-1 pathway on T cell activation and anti-tumor immune responses [8, 9], a key advance in our conceptualization was the discovery that PD-1 was actively involved in suppressing the functions of exhausted T cells [10]. T cell exhaustion develops in the setting of chronic antigen stimulation, characteristic of chronic infections and cancer, and is characterized by a progressive loss of effector functions [11-13]. Importantly, blockade of the PD-1 pathway using monoclonal antibodies against either PD-1 or the ligand PD-L1 could at least partially restore functions to these T cells. This checkpoint-induced “reinvigoration” of the exhausted T cell response can subsequently lead to control of chronic pathogen or tumor [8, 10, 13-18]. Antibodies blocking either PD-1 or PD-L1 (anti-PD-1: nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab; anti-PD-L1: atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab) are now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating over 20 types of cancer [19-22]. Despite these clinical successes, the majority of patients do not show complete responses, and a number of patients experience pathogenic immune-related adverse events, highlighting the need to better understand how to safely and effectively modulate the PD-1 pathway in patients. Additionally, PD-1 inhibitors have become a cornerstone of diverse combination therapies (including combinations with other immunotherapies, chemotherapies, radiation therapies, small molecule targeted therapies, and surgeries [23, 24][25]. Further knowledge of how PD-1 blockade works as a single agent and in these various types of combination is becoming increasingly important.\n\nThe goal of this Review is to discuss emerging concepts in the PD-1 field, including advances in basic research as well as developing areas in clinical research. We will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the complexity of the binding partners for PD-1 and its ligands, including cis vs. trans interactions, and novel binding partners and interactions. We will also provide an update on our understanding of how PD-1 regulates T cell exhaustion in chronic infection and cancer, with an emphasis on where PD-1 inhibitors act to boost T cell functions. Additionally, we will summarize recent developments in our understanding of how the functions of the PD-1 pathway depend on the differentiation state of T cells, and controls not only exhausted T cells, but also effector and memory T cells, regulatory T cells (Treg) cells, and NK cells. Lastly, we will discuss emerging concepts in PD-1 checkpoint blockade in cancer patients, particularly the use of checkpoint inhibitors in the management of early-stage disease and the potential for improved outcomes when PD-1 inhibitors are utilized in the neoadjuvant setting.\n\nII. Receptor:Ligand interactions in the pathway\n\nThe identification of additional binding partners for the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, has expanded the cellular interactions and immunoregulatory functions of the PD-1 pathway. PD-L1 and PD-L2 differ in their expression patterns. PD-L1 is expressed widely on both hematopoietic (T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, and bone marrow-derived mast cells) and non-hematopoietic (vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells, epithelial cells, keratinocytes, mesenchymal stem cells and syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta) cells, and is heavily regulated by inflammation [26-29]. PD-L2 is more limited in its expression than PD-L1, being restricted mainly to hematopoietic cells including dendritic cells, macrophages, bone marrow-derived mast cells [30], B cells [31], Th2 cells [32], and activated T cells [33], though some non-hematopoietic expression has been observed (e.g. nasal epithelial cells) [34]. PD-L1 is also expressed by tumor cells from a wide variety of tumor types, and in some tumor types such as NCSLC, PD-L1 expression within the tumor is associated with better responses to PD-1 checkpoint blockade [21, 35]. PD-L2 has also been observed on tumor cells (including esophageal adenocarcinoma) [36], though is much more limited than PD-L1.\n\nWhile PD-L1 and PD-L2 share PD-1 as a binding partner, they each have a second, distinct binding partner. PD-L1 can also bind B7-1 (CD80), while PD-L2 can also bind Repulsive Guidance Molecule b (RGMb) [37, 38]. The PD-L1 binding partner B7-1 is mainly expressed by hematopoietic cells and antigen presenting cells [39] while the PD-L2 binding partner, RGMb, is expressed on macrophages including lung interstitial macrophages, alveolar epitherlial cells, neural tissues and various organs [38, 40]. In this section of the Review we provide an update on emerging themes in these receptor-ligand interactions, with a focus on advances regarding the B7-1/PD-L1 interaction as well as the PD-L2-RGMb-neogenin interaction.\n\nPD-1 interacts with PD-L1 on the same cell surface in cis\n\nThe canonical PD-1 pathway interactions occur in trans between PD-1 expressed on an activated T cell and PD-L1 on a tumor, antigen presenting cell (APC) or non hematopoietic cell, and results in inhibition of T cell activation [4]. Interactions between PD-1 and PD-L1 can also occur in cis if both are expressed on the same cell surface and this interaction has a similar affinity to the trans interaction [41]. In tumors such as NSCLC, PD-1 can be co-expressed with PD-L1 on a subpopulation of tumor infiltrating macrophages, MDSCs, and dendritic cells as well as some tumor cells. The cis interaction competes with the trans interaction, resulting in less PD-L1 available to transduce an inhibitory PD-1 signal into T cells [41]. Given the expression of PD-L1 on some tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), the cis interaction likely also occurs between PD-L1 and PD-1 on the surface of T cells. Moreover, PD-1 can be expressed on tumor associated macrophages in colorectal cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [42, 43]. PD-1 engagement on the macrophage with PD-L1 on the tumor decreases macrophage phagocytic capacity while increasing their pro-tumor M2-like phenotype [42, 43]. The relative importance of trans vs cis PD-1/PD-L1 interactions likely depends on their relative abundance on the same or different cell surfaces and needs further careful assessment.\n\nPD-L1 can interact with B7-1 in cis but not in trans\n\nPD-L1 can bind to B7-1 with an affinity of 1.4 μM, about 3-fold higher than the affinity of B7-1 for CD28 (4 μM) but weaker than the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 (0.77 μM) or B7-1 with CTLA-4 (0.2 μM) [37, 44] ( ). Initially this was presumed to be an interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 on two cell surfaces in trans, but cell binding studies showed the trans interaction did not take place [45]. Instead, the interaction occurred only in cis between a PD-L1 and B7-1 on the same cell surface. Competitive binding studies and mutational analysis showed PD-1 and B7-1 bind to an overlapping region on PD-L1 [45-49]. Consequently, B7-1 binding to PD-L1 prevents PD-L1 interaction with PD-1, thereby reducing the PD-1 inhibitory signal. Surprisingly, B7-1 binding to PD-L1 does not interfere with the binding of B7-1 to CD28; consequently, they can form a trimeric complex which engages the CD28 costimulatory signal. [46, 47, 49]. B7-1 exists as a back-to back non-covalent homodimer in equilibrium with monomer on the cell surface. The homodimer interface is composed of the DEB face of the B7-1 IgV domain while the CD28 and CTLA-4 binding site is on the opposite AGFCC’C” face of the IgV domain [50]. PD-L1 binds to the B7-1 dimer interface and converts a B7-1 homodimer into a B7-1/PD-L1 heterodimer. Since CD28 binds monovalently to B7-1, the interaction can take place whether B7-1 is monomeric or dimeric and the CD28 costimulatory interaction is unchanged. One report found that an enforced B7-1 dimer was less costimulatory than the natural form [51]. The effect of PD-L1 binding to B7-1 upon CTLA-4 binding to B7-1 is more subtle. CTLA-4 homodimers can bind to B7-1 homodimers in a high avidity lattice, leading to trans-endocytosis of B7-1 by a Treg [47]. PD-L1 binding to B7-1 reduces the CTLA-4 interaction to a monovalent one, drastically reducing the avidity. This prevents the removal of B7-1 and reduces any T cell intrinsic CTLA-4 signal [47].\n\nFunctional significance of cis PD-L1-B7-1\n\nBoth PD-L1 and B7-1 are upregulated on antigen presenting cells upon activation [27]. The co-expression and engagement of PD-L1 and B7-1 on the surface of antigen presenting cells have been recently described [45-47]. The relative levels of PD-L1 and B7-1 will influence the outcome. PD-L1 is expressed more abundantly than B7-1 on DCs in cancer patients with about a 20-fold molar excess of PD-L1 over B7-1 [48]. This excess of PD-L1 would sequester B7-1 in cis on DCs, reducing the removal of B7-1 by CTLA-4, but unbound PD-L1 should be available for a PD-1 immunoinhibitory signal. In situations or on cells where B7-1 is in excess over PD-L1, the sequestration of PD-L1 by B7-1 would reduce the PD-1 signal and the excess B7-1 could homodimerize and be removed by CTLA-4, making CTLA-4 a dominant checkpoint. Sugiura et al. isolated mutants of PD-L1 that can bind PD-1 but not B7-1 and mutants of B7-1 that can bind CD28/CTLA-4 but not PD-L1, thereby eliminating the cis interaction. They made knock-in mice expressing these mutants and tested APC function. Either mutation led to reduced immune responses to vaccination and decreased autoimmunity in EAE, which was due to increased PD-1 activity [46].\n\nBlockade of cis PD-L1 B7-1 interactions\n\nMost PD-L1 mAbs and all the clinically approved PD-L1 mAbs block both the PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/B7-1 interactions. Zhao et al found that in tumor immunotherapy, this type of PD-L1 mAb led to a reduced level of B7-1 expression on APC through enhanced CTLA-4 mediated removal of presumably homodimeric B7-1 [47]. They propose this provides a good rationale for clinical trials of combined PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockade.\n\nHaile et al. first noted the interplay of PD-L1 with B7-1 on the same cell but initially interpreted this as interference with movement to the cell surface [52-54]. Transfection of PD-L1 expressing tumor cells with B7-1 prevented PD-1 binding and restored T cell activation. They also noted that binding of some PD-L1 mAbs was reduced following B7-1 transfection, indicating that PD-L1 immunohistochemistry with mAbs against the extracellular domain might not report total PD-L1 but the levels of PD-L1 not in complex with B7-1. This suggests that immunohistochemistry with PD-L1 mAb that recognize the cytoplasmic domain may more accurately measure total PD-L1 [55].\n\nTwo groups have made PD-L1 mAbs that block the PD-L1/B7-1 interaction but not the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction [37, 44, 56]. Cis-blocking PD-L1 mAb enhanced T-cell expansion, prevented T-cell anergy and oral tolerance induction and restored T-cell responsiveness to antigen previously tolerized by the oral route [56]. Cis-blocking PD-L1 mAb accelerated the development of diabetes in NOD mice, particularly at late stages [57]. This indicates that blockade of only the cis interaction increases pathogenic self-reactive effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in vivo. Cis-blocking PD-L1 mAb aggravated chronic injury of bm12 allografts in B6 recipients and increased the frequency of alloreactive IFN-g, IL-4, and IL-6 producing T cells while decreasing the percentage of regulatory T cells [58]. In vitro, treatment of dendritic cells with cis-blocking PD-L1 mAb increased IFN-g production from alloreactive CD4+ T cells [58]. These results show the cis interaction is an important regulator in the induction and maintenance of T-cell tolerance.\n\nPD-L2-RGMb-neogenin\n\nPD-L2 engagement with PD-1 on T cells inhibits T cell activation [3]. The binding affinity of PD-L2-PD-1 is three-fold higher than of PD-L1-PD-1 [59, 60]. PD-L2 and PD-L1 compete for binding to PD-1 as they bind at a similar region on the PD-1 IgV domain [61]. Though the binding affinity of PD-L2 is higher than PD-L1, its lower expression levels gives a competitive advantage to PD-L1-PD-1 [62]. Similar to PD-L1, PD-L2 expression is up regulated by IFN-y but in contrast, can also be upregulated by IL-4 [3, 63].\n\nThe role of PD-L2 is highlighted in studies of allergy and tolerance. Asthma is exacerbated by PD-L2 but not PD-1 blocking antibodies [64] suggesting a second binding partner of PD-L2. The second binding partner of PD-L2 was discovered as RGMb and this interaction had a binding affinity similar to PD-L2-PD-1 [38]. The interaction of PD-L2-RGMb regulates respiratory tolerance, as blockade of PD-L2-RGMb prevented the induction of tolerance, thereby increasing IL-4 production and T cell proliferation on antigen exposure [38].\n\nRGMb is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein and is one of three members of the repulsive guidance molecule family (RGMa/b/c). RGMb can be expressed on the surface of cells but a considerable amount can be sequestered inside the cell [38, 65]. RGMb can be cleaved from the cell surface by phospholipases, releasing a soluble form [66]. RGMb, also known as DRAGON, functions in neuronal differentiation [67], and binds to two receptors, bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 4 (BMP) and neogenin, in addition to PD-L2 [38, 68]. BMPs belong to the TGFβ superfamily and regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, patterning and migration [69]. BMPs are secreted cytokines [70] and RGMb can function as a coreceptor for BMP engagement with Type I and Type II BMP serine threonine kinase receptors which initiates Smad activation followed by Smad translocation into the nucleus resulting in context dependent transcription [71]. Separately, a dimer of RGMbs can bring together two Neogenin molecules [72]. BMPs bind to a protruding domain of the RGMb structure, termed the wing, and a dimer of BMPs can bridge two RGMb-Neogenin complexes and initiate Neogenin signaling [72]. Following engagement with BMP, RGMb inhibits IL-6 secretion in macrophages through downstream activation of p38/MAPK and ERK pathways [40]. PD-L2 and BMP can simultaneously bind to RGMb at distinct binding sites to form a trimeric complex [38]. Moreover, PD-1 and RGMb have distinct binding sites on PD-L2 [38]. Based on the complex interaction between the shared binding partners, Xiao et al. [38] proposed a model of the RGMb interactions; RGMb binds to the BMP-BMPR complex to signal the downstream pathways such as MAPK and ERK pathways [40, 73]. Since RGMb binds to neogenin in cis, this may result in a supercomplex of BMP-BMPR-RGMb-Neogenin. PD-L2 may bind in trans with the RGMb supercomplex to regulate downstream pathways [38]. The functional role of PD-L2 in this supercomplex and its influence on BMP-RGMb-neogenin interactions need further study.\n\nNeogenin belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, and in addition to RGMs also binds with netrin. The neogenin-netrin axis regulates angiogenesis and cell adhesion, while the neogenin-RGM interaction regulates neural cell differentiation and neural cell proliferation [74]. In models of allergic asthma, RGMb is expressed by activated eosinophils, interstitial macrophages and airway epithelial cells [65]. Following induction of airway inflammation, RGMb positive macrophages co-express neogenin and secrete IL-5, IL-13, and low levels of IL-4, hallmark cytokines of Type 2 inflammation, which is reduced by RGMb mAb treatment. This shows that the RGMb-neogenin axis contributes to Type 2 diseases and their associated inflammation. RGMb mAb blocked the development of airway inflammation and airway hyperreactivity in a mouse model of asthma, even when administered only during the challenge (effector) phase [65]. Thus, there is a context-specific role of RGMb based on the receptor it interacts with: RGMb-neogenin enhances inflammation [65] while PD-L2-RGMb-BMP axis regulates tolerance [38]. In addition, BMP-4 also upregulates PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression on dendritic cells [75]. As if all these interactions were not complex enough, RGMb has been shown to bind to the monomeric soluble form of CTLA-4 (sCTLA-4) but not to dimeric, membrane CTLA-4 [76]. RGMb strengthens the binding of sCTLA-4 to B7-1, allowing sCTLA-4 to more effectively block the costimulatory interaction of B7-1 with CD28.\n\nRGMb has also been reported to have a role in cancer progression. Reduced RGMb expression was associated with poor overall survival in NSCLC [77]. Knockdown of RGMb in NSCLC and breast cancer cell lines and in a mouse model resulted in enhanced proliferation, adhesion, and migration of tumor cells and enhanced metastasis and tumor cell survival [77, 78]. RGMb overexpression suppressed cancer progression.\n\nIII. The diverse regulatory roles of the Pd-1 pathway\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of the PD-1 pathway is the breadth of its impact on adaptive immune responses. While the pathway has received considerable attention for its role in regulating T cell exhaustion in cancer, it is well established that PD-1 can regulate T cell functions at most stages of conventional T cell differentiation. In addition to its role in controlling the maintenance of T cell dysfunction during chronic infection and tumors, PD-1 regulates: (1) effector and memory T cell responses following acute antigen exposure, (2) the induction and maintenance of peripheral T cell tolerance to self antigens [18, 79-81], and (3) humoral immunity through regulating CD4+ T follicular helper (TFH) and T follicular regulatory (TFR) cell responses [82, 83]. Moreover, the PD-1 pathway can act both in secondary lymphoid organs and non-lymphoid tissues (including tumors), a feature that has uniquely positioned PD-1 as a central regulator of adaptive immunity both during initial T cell priming and differentiation as well as after migration into effector sites. The following section will review the role of the PD-1 pathway in regulating conventional αβ T cell functions during the diverse stages of differentiation in infection and cancer, as well as emerging data on the role of the PD-1 pathway in regulating other immune populations including Treg cells, NK cells, and others.\n\nHigh and sustained levels of PD-1 in chronic infection and cancer contribute to T cell exhaustion\n\nThe PD-1 pathway has received considerable attention for its role in maintaining T cell exhaustion. T cell exhaustion is a discrete state of T cell differentiation caused by chronic exposure to antigen and inflammation. Exhausted T cells arise from precursors that have become adequately primed and first acquired an effector state. This feature distinguishes exhaustion from other forms of dysfunction like anergy, where full effector differentiation is not achieved prior to tolerance induction [11, 13]. Antigenic stimulation through the TCR is a critical driver of PD-1 expression on T cells. Consistent with this, high and sustained levels of PD-1 are observed on T cells during chronic infection and cancer [13]. While PD-1 signaling is not required for the induction of CD8+ T cell exhaustion [84], this pathway plays a critical role in maintaining the exhausted state [10]. Importantly, blocking the PD-1 pathway after the onset of exhaustion can at least temporally enhance the effector functions of a subset of CD8+ T cells, a process termed reinvigoration [10, 85-90]. The ability to boost T cell functions has been translated to the clinic with tremendous success. Despite these clinical successes, the majority of patients do not show complete responses, and a number of patients experience pathogenic immune-related adverse events, highlighting the need to better understand how to safely and effectively modulate the PD-1 pathway in diverse patient populations. In this section, we will discuss recent advances in three key areas that have had significant implications for the way we think about the functions of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in cancer: (1) heterogeneity of exhausted T cell populations, (2) the epigenetic landscape of exhaustion, and (3) location of PD-1-mediated regulation during chronic antigen encounter.\n\nRecent advances in our understanding of exhausted CD8+ T cell heterogeneity have had important ramifications for PD-1-based immunotherapies, supporting a model where only a subset of exhausted CD8+ T cells proliferates in response to PD-1 blockade. Work in preclinical models of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection established that there is heterogeneity in the exhausted anti-viral CD8+ T cell population [85, 86, 88, 91-93]. Within the exhausted CD8+ T cell pool are at least two subsets, one that serves as a progenitor-like population which retains the ability to proliferate in response to antigen and produce inflammatory cytokines, and the other which is more terminally differentiated and is less proliferative, but is more cytotoxic. The progenitor-like population can self renew and possesses stem-like properties, dividing to give rise to more progenitor cells as well as the terminally differentiated population. The progenitor-like population is defined by high levels of the transcription factor T cell factor-1 (TCF-1) and intermediate levels of PD-1, while the terminally-exhausted population lacks TCF-1 but expresses high levels of PD-1 and other inhibitory receptors including T-cell Immunoglobulin And Mucin Containing Protein-3 (TIM-3) [85, 86, 92, 93].\n\nAdditional studies are further refining our understanding of the diversity of exhausted T cell subsets, including the addition of more effector-like populations that diverge from the exhausted population early during infection, additional layers of transcriptional regulation early during subset development, as well as transitory populations that exist between the progenitor-like subset and terminally-exhausted subset [90, 94-97]. Some of these subpopulations have also since been described in both preclinical cancer models and patients with a number of different types of cancer including NSCLC, melanoma, prostate, kidney, and bladder cancer [89, 98-104], suggesting that the presence of these dysfunctional subpopulations is a common feature that is shared between exhausted CD8+ T cells in chronic infection and cancer. Although the progenitor-like subpopulation expresses lower levels of PD-1 than the terminally-exhausted subset, the progenitor-like subpopulation is preferentially responsive to PD-1 pathway blockade, showing a stronger degree of reinvigoration following PD-1 loss than the terminally-exhausted subset [85-88]. Preliminary findings in patients have suggested that higher frequencies of the progenitor-like subset are associated with better responses to immune checkpoint blockade [87, 89]. While our understanding of exhausted CD8+ T cell heterogeneity has progressed rapidly, several outstanding questions need to be addressed for translation of this knowledge to therapy: Is it possible to generate more of the progenitor-like population? Does functionality of the progenitor-like population erode over time similarly to the terminally exhausted population? How can the regenerative properties of the progenitor population be best balanced with the improved cytotoxicity of the terminally exhausted population, which is also critically important for direct killing of tumor cells?\n\nOne proposed mechanism for the lack of durable reinvigoration following PD-1 blockade is the fixed epigenetic landscape of T cell exhaustion. It is well established that epigenetic regulatory mechanisms are critically involved in regulating gene expression programs within cells, and the state of T cell exhaustion is largely fixed at the epigenetic level. The epigenetic program of exhaustion diverges from functional effector and memory cells early following chronic infection (as early as day 7) [105, 106]. Importantly, at a population level, PD-1 blockade does not substantially change this fixed epigenetic landscape of exhaustion [107, 108]. Rather, PD-1 blockade allowed exhausted T cells to reengage with effector-like transcriptional programs operating within these open chromatin regions in an exhausted T cell [107]. Because the epigenetic state of exhaustion appears to be a major barrier to durable reinvigoration of CD8+ T cells, there is now increasing interest in therapeutically targeting populations at the epigenetic level to boost T cell functions. One approach supported by studies in mouse models is global modulation of epigenetic regulators. For example, targeting de novo DNA methylation (using either conditional knockout of the DNA methyltransferase Dntm3a or DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2’deoxycytidine) synergized with PD-1 blockade to provide enhanced CD8+ T cell reinvigoration in chronic LCMV infection in mice [109]. An alternative approach is a more targeted manipulation of individual genes at the epigenetic level, which could be possible in adoptive cell transfer therapies like chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. There has been significant interest in epigenetically targeting PD-1 because it is highly regulated at the epigenetic level. For PD-1, studies examining DNA methylation status [110], histone modifications [111], and chromatin accessibility regions (ChARs) (using Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing or ATAC seq) [105, 107, 108, 112, 113] have demonstrated the dynamic nature of epigenetic-mediated regulation of Pdcd1 during acute and chronic antigen exposures. During chronic LCMV infection and HIV-infected individuals, the PD-1 locus remains demethylated in virus-specific CD8+ T cells, consistent with the elevated expression of PD-1 in these settings [110]. Work in chronic LCMV infection in mice first described a unique open chromatin region 23.8 kB upstream of the transcriptional start site of Pdcd1 [105]. Using CRISPR to delete this regulatory region reduced expression of PD-1 [105], though additional work is needed to clarify the impact of manipulating this region in vivo. Within the epigenetic framework regulating the Pdcd1 locus, there are at least ten transcription factor/complexes that can modulate PD-1 expression (NFATc1, c-fos/AP-1, FoxO1, STAT3, STAT4, Notch, ISGF3, and NF-κB as positive regulators; Blimp-1 and T-bet as negative regulators) [114]. As with PD-1, a number of studies have found that epigenetic modifications are critical in PD-L1 regulation. Work in multiple cancer types including NSCLC, glioblastoma, glioma, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell cancer has shown that PD-L1 expression and DNA methylation levels in the PD-L1 promoter are inversely correlated [115]. Histone modifications have also been associated with control of the gene encoding PD-L1, with acetylation being involved with increased PD-L1 transcription and trafficking [115, 116]. PD-L1 expression is also heavily regulated by a number of transcription factors and other signaling pathways, including PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, MYC, AP-1, NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and HIF-1α [115]. Collectively, these factors represent opportunities for modulating the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, and represent potential targets for cancer immunotherapy.\n\nLastly, an important factor that critically influences outcomes following PD-1 modulation is T cell location ( ). One hallmark of the PD-1 pathway is its ability to regulate T cells both in the secondary lymphoid organs and in non-lymphoid tissues; however, CD8+ T cell populations residing in non-lymphoid tissues and tumors are not necessarily going to respond the same way to blockade of PD-1 signals as CD8+ T cells residing in secondary lymphoid organs. Early work in tumors led to predictions that a main mechanism of action of PD-1 blockade was directly reinvigorating T cells in the tumor microenvironment itself, where levels of PD-1 are often high on T cells, and PD-L1 can be high in the tumor [20]. However, it is now well appreciated that the systemic immune response is impacted by PD-1 blockade, and plays a critical role in improved anti-tumor immunity in this setting [117-125]. In patients, recent data suggest that recruitment of new CD8+ T cell clones from the blood into the tumor, a concept termed “clonal replacement”, is associated with better responses to checkpoint blockade [122, 126, 127]. Preclinical studies have shown that removal of the tumor draining lymph node (LN) [117] or treatment with FTY720 to block LN egress [125] abrogates the efficacy of PD-1 blockade, suggesting that recruitment of anti-tumor T cells from the periphery into the tumor is an important aspect of how PD-1 enhances anti-tumor immunity. Moreover, PD-L1 on dendritic cells plays a critical role in anti-tumor immunity, and this is at least partially due to the ability of PD-1 to regulate T cells at the priming stage in the tumor draining LN [128]. Finally, work in chronic viral infection has shown that the progenitor-like exhausted CD8+ T cell population in chronic viral infection is preferentially located in the secondary lymphoid organs, while most of the CD8+ T cells in non-lymphoid tissues display a terminally exhausted phenotype, consistent with the notion that PD-1 blockade may have a more dramatic impact on the expansion of exhausted CD8+ T cell subpopulations in secondary lymphoid organs than non-lymphoid tissues [96, 129]. Collectively, these studies highlight the importance of considering the effects of anatomical location on response to PD-1 blockade, and the role of the systemic immune response in productive anti-tumor immunity ( ).\n\nPD-1 tempers the activation program during T cell priming in secondary lymphoid organs and controls the magnitude of the effector response\n\nPD-1 is at least transiently expressed on all T cells following acute activation, positioning this pathway to play a critical role in shaping the effector response and subsequently the memory response [10]. PD-1 engagement antagonizes the positive signals received through the TCR and CD28 [4, 130-133] rapidly acting as a brake to counterbalance the activation program. During acute activation, PD-1 can inhibit cell cycle progression through the G1 phase, as well as inhibit PI3K/Akt signaling [3, 130, 131, 134]. Additionally, PD-1 can alter T cell motility [135-137], further acting to counter productive T cell activation. Together, these effects of PD-1 signaling early during T cell activation act to dampen effector T cell responses in secondary lymphoid organs, resulting in diminished proliferation, effector cytokine production, and cytotoxic capacity [18].\n\nFollowing acute antigen exposure, TCR signal strength and the formation of self-renewing central memory T cells are inversely correlated: Stronger TCR signals skew the response towards better effector T cell differentiation, while weaker TCR signals favor the development of central memory T cells [138-144]. Since PD-1 signaling reduces the TCR and CD28 signals [4, 130-133], PD-1 engagement during priming can limit the effector response. Many studies have shown that a loss of PD-1 signals leads to improved early control of diverse types of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi [145-151]. This enhanced pathogen control is associated with improved effector T cell responses in these settings [84, 146, 148-151]. One fundamental role of the PD-1 pathway is tempering over activation of the adaptive immune response to mitigate immunopathology. The augmented effector responses that arise in the absence of PD-1 signals can come at the expense of increased immunopathology and damage to host tissues [148, 149, 152]. In PD-1 deficient mice in settings like LCMV [10, 84, 149] and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [153], the immunopathology caused by an overactive effector response can be fatal, highlighting the importance of restraining the effector activities of the immune system to protect self tissues. Collectively, these studies highlight the importance of PD-1 as a regulator of the balance between protective anti-pathogen immune responses and aberrant immunopathology, a role of the PD-1 pathway that is becoming increasingly relevant in therapeutic settings of PD-1 pathway blockade.\n\nRegulation of memory T cell responses by the PD-1 pathway\n\nOne of the hallmarks of adaptive immune responses is the formation of immunological memory upon antigen clearance. Productive memory responses allow the host to respond faster upon reencounter of the same antigen due to the increase in quantity and quality of resting memory T cell populations compared to their naïve counterparts, as well as positioning of memory T cells in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues [144, 154, 155]. PD-1 signaling can impact memory responses by a number of different mechanisms. First, the cues that CD8+ T cells receive during the priming and effector phases of an immune response shape the quantity and quality of the ensuing memory response. Consequently, loss of PD-1 early during the response can alter the balance between productive effector versus memory responses. As discussed above, the strength of TCR signaling is inversely correlated with the formation of long-lived central memory T cells [138-143]. Consequently, loss of PD-1 during the effector phase would result in a stronger TCR signal, and thereby would lead to impaired memory T cell responses. In acute influenza infection, this improved effector response in the complete absence of PD-1 pathway signals resulted in a more severe contraction of the number of antigen-specific T cells and poor memory CD8+ T cell responses [150]. Mechanistically, recent work suggests that a population of memory precursor cells expressing high levels of CD62L and heightened ability to respond to DNA damage are important for formation of long lived memory populations, and that inhibitory receptors including PD-1 and Lymphocyte Activating Gene-3 (LAG-3) are important in maintaining this population [156]. In contrast, some studies in acute LCMV [151] and intranasal Vaccinia virus infection models [157] have shown that loss of PD-1 signals early can potentially skew towards a central memory phenotype (increased CD62L). Further work is needed to better understand how PD-1 regulates the generation of different memory T cell populations including central, effector and resident memory T cells.\n\nThe PD-1 pathway has distinct roles in regulating the differentiation of naive T cells into memory T cells, and modulating the responses of existing memory T cell populations. For example, studies using antibodies against the PD-1 pathway at different stages of the CD8+ T cell response to influenza infection have shown that blockade of the PD-1 pathway later during infection (starting at day 21) caused an increase in memory T cell numbers and production of the inflammatory cytokines interferon gamma (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) [152]. Moreover, blocking PD-1 during rechallenge with intranasal Vaccinia virus responses overcame memory defects resulting from a lack of CD4+ T cell help [158]. Likewise, PD-1-deficient cells had improved recall capacity following rechallenge with intranasal Vaccinia virus [157]. Interestingly, blocking PD-1 using antibodies only during the priming stage of influenza did not result in the same memory defect as complete PD-1 pathway knockout [150], suggesting that the PD-1 pathway can continue to shape the memory response after the initial priming phase of infection. Additional work is needed to clarify the impact of PD-1 on the formation and maintenance of CD8+ T cell memory in different settings.\n\nHow the PD-1 pathway impacts memory T cell maintenance and functional capacity likely depends on context. For example, during acute systemic LCMV infection, virus is very rapidly cleared, and antigen does not persist long term. Early work in the acute LCMV model showed that antigen was not required for the long term maintenance of memory CD8+ T cells, since these cells could persist upon transfer into a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I-deficient host [159]. However, for other types of infections, local antigen recognition is critical for the generation and maintenance of memory CD8+ T cell responses [160-164]. This is particularly well described in the lung, where numerous intranasal infections including influenza virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and Sendai virus in mice have all shown some degree of prolonged antigen presentation [162, 165-168]. Whether the ability of PD-1 to continue shaping the memory response in the lung during later stages of influenza may be tied to prolonged antigen presentation, and whether similar results would be seen in a setting like acute systemic LCMV where antigen is not required for the long term maintenance of memory cells is unclear. Further clarifying the host factors that contribute to the involvement of the PD-1 pathway in host immunity will be critical for continuing to improve PD-1-based immunotherapies in patients.\n\nRegulating the regulators – PD-1 suppresses Treg cell functions\n\nIt is now appreciated that PD-1 can regulate a number of cell types beyond conventional αβ T cells. Treg cells are a population of particular interest because these cells play a critical role in immune regulation. At least a fraction of Treg cells express elevated levels of the PD-1 receptor, poising the PD-1 pathway to regulate this population [169, 170]. By isolating PD-1hi and PD-1− cells from peripheral blood of healthy individuals, Lowther and colleagues controlled for differences in microenvironment to study the intrinsic impact of PD-1 expression on human Treg cells. Human Treg cells that expressed higher levels of PD-1 tended to have reduced suppressive capacity and increased IFNγ production [171]. Work in mouse models has shown that Treg cells from either PD-1-deficient or anti-PD-1-treated mice have improved suppressive capacity, consistent with a model that PD-1 inhibits Treg cell activation and function [172, 173]. In tumors, PD-1 blockade leads to both increased PD-1+ CD8+ T cell function as well as enhanced PD-1+ Treg cell-mediated immunosuppression [174]. The ratio of PD-1+ CD8 T cells to PD-1+ Treg at the outset of treatment may direct the outcome of the final immune response [174]. Consequently, the collective effects of PD-1 inhibitors on the functions of these opposing cell populations (effector cells versus regulatory cells) is important to consider when examining the impact of these therapies on overall patient outcomes. Collectively, these studies highlight an important role for the PD-1 pathway in modulating Treg cell activations and function.\n\nRecent work has implicated an over activation and expansion of Treg cells in patients with hyperprogressive disease (HPD) compared to non-hyperprogressive disease in a cohort of gastric cancer patients [173]. HPD following treatment with checkpoint inhibitors is defined as a rapid increase in tumor size shortly after initiation of therapy, and this is coupled with accelerated disease and poor survival [175]. While the concept of HPD is still debated within the field and the precise parameters used to define HPD are not well established, there have been a number of well documented reports of HPD following treatment with checkpoint inhibitors [175]. Importantly, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear, including how the checkpoint inhibitor might potentiate disease progression [175]. Kamada and colleagues propose that PD-1 blockade may activate and expand tumor-infiltrating PD-1+ Treg cells to overwhelm PD-1+ CD8+ T cells [173]. In this study, comparison of gastric cancer samples before and after anti-PD-1 therapy showed that patients who developed HPD had a marked increase in proliferation of Treg in the post-therapy sample compared to pre-therapy. In contrast, patients who did not develop HPD showed a reduction in proliferation of Treg following anti-PD-1 [173]. Since PD-1 blockade can also increase the suppressive capacity of Treg cells, increasing the number and/or activity of Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment may serve to tip the balance between regulatory and effector immune populations in favor of immune downregulation and tumor progression. Additional work is needed to define the underlying biological mechanisms contributing to HPD following checkpoint blockade, including how checkpoint inhibitors impact diverse regulatory versus effector immune populations. The ratio of PD-1+ CD8 T cells to PD-1+ Treg at the outset of treatment may be a biomarker for clinical response to PD-1 blockade [174].\n\nRole of PD-1 in modulating non-T cell populations including innate lymphoid populations and tumor cells\n\nInnate lymphoid populations including innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and NK cells are important contributors to protective immunity, but have germ line encoded receptors instead of the antigen receptors present in T cells and B cells that require V(D)J recombination for assembly. Some reports have shown that PD-1 can act as an immune checkpoint for these innate lymphoid populations, though there have been mixed reports on the extent to which PD-1 actively contributes to the regulation of these populations that have varied depending on disease context. PD-1 expression has been described on NK cells in some types of cancer, including RMA-S, RMA, TRAMP, and KP sarcoma in mice and Kaposi sarcoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarian carcinoma, and lung carcinoma in humans [176], and some studies have shown that modulating PD-1 can impact NK cell functions [177, 178]. However, other work suggests minimal expression of PD-1 on NK cells in tumor-bearing mice (including B16, C1498, MCA) and patients (including melanoma, round cell sarcoma, and colon cancer) [177, 179-181]. Consequently the extent to which PD-1 on NK cells can contribute to regulating host immunity remains an active area of investigation. In ILCs, PD-1 expression can be found on ILC committed progenitor cells, but is down regulated upon differentiation [182, 183]. Re-expression of PD-1 has been observed on KLRG1+ ILC2 cells during lung inflammation in both mice and humans, and loss of PD-1 increased expansion of these cells [184]. PD-1 can also be expressed by ILC2 cells that infiltrate pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, and PD-1 blockade can expand these tumor ILC2 cells and promote anti-tumor immunity [185]. Lastly, some ILC3 cells can express PD-1 in pleural effusions during cancer [186] as well as pregnancy [187], highlighting the potential inhibitory role of PD-1 on ILC3 cells in these settings.\n\nIn addition to innate lymphoid populations, the PD-1 receptor has been shown to be expressed by some tumor cells in both mice and humans [188]. Kleffel and colleagues showed that in melanoma, a subset of the tumor cells themselves can express the PD-1 receptor, and PD-1 signaling had promoted tumorigenesis in a cell intrinsic manner. Inhibiting the PD-1 pathway suppressed tumor cell growth [188]. The ability of PD-1 inhibition to directly impact the tumor cells and lead to suppressed growth could be one mechanism by which these inhibitors contribute to the positive clinical outcomes in melanoma patients. Additional studies are needed to determine if this tumor cell-intrinsic ability of PD-1 to suppress tumor cell growth is generalizable to other tumor types beyond melanoma.\n\nIV. Emerging uses of PD-1 pathway inhibitors in the clinic: toward earlier blockade\n\nAntibodies blocking PD-1 were first approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced or metastatic melanoma in 2014. Since that time, antibodies blocking PD-1 or PD-L1 have been approved for over 20 types of advanced-stage cancer including NSCLC, RCC, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer (MSIhi), hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, cervical cancer, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, small-cell lung cancer, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, endometrial cancer, cancer of the esophagus, triple negative breast cancer and mesothelioma [19]. Response rates in approved indications range from 13% (gastric/gastroesophageal junction) to 69% (Hodgkin lymphoma) with the common solid tumors generally in the 20-30% overall response rate (ORR) range. PD-1 or PD-L1 agents have limited success in glioblastoma, microsatellite stable colon cancer, pancreatic, or prostate cancer.\n\nIn light of this success, there is interest in expanding the use of PD-1 pathway inhibitors in early-stage cancers, where treatment is with curative intent. Perioperative PD-1 inhibition is being investigated in both the neoadjuvant (presurgical) and adjuvant (postsurgical) settings. In neoadjuvant therapy, PD-1 therapy is initiated and about two-three weeks later, the tumor is surgically removed. The primary tumor is leveraged as a source of tumor antigen and TILs that can be primed and/or expanded into anti-tumor T-cells following PD-1 blockade [189]. The hope is that following neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade, a substantial number of tumor-specific T cells will traffic into the blood before surgical removal of the tumor and function to eliminate residual tumor. The effect of PD-1 inhibitors on the anti-tumor immune response is quite rapid with a single dose of PD-1 inhibitor leading to brisk increases in TILs before surgery at three weeks in 10 of 20 melanoma patients. This increase in TIL was associated with major pathologic response and longer disease-free survival [118]. Moreover, as discussed previously in this review, preclinical studies have shown that removal of the tumor draining LN abrogates the efficacy of PD-1 blockade [117]. This finding argues that the ability of PD-1 inhibitors to promote an effective anti-tumor immune response might be enhanced when they are administered prior to surgery. While the addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors has the potential to improve therapeutic efficacy and outcomes, this must be balanced against the risk of immune-related adverse events (irAE), which occur in a significant minority of patients receiving PD-1 pathway inhibitors. This is particularly relevant in the neoadjuvant setting, where the development of irAE has the potential to interfere with timely surgical resection necessary for curative treatment.\n\nNeoadjuvant PD-1 blockade was first evaluated for the treatment of early-stage NSCLC in a small phase-II trial of 21 patients with resectable early-stage (I, II, or IIIA) NSCLC [189]. A major pathologic response, defined as the presence of less than 10% viable tumor cells in the surgical sample, was seen in 9 of 20 (45%) of patients. The diversity of T-cell clones identified in the tumor and the blood increased after PD-1 inhibition in eight of nine patients evaluated. Just as importantly, neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibition in this study was associated with few side effects and was not associated with delays in surgery. These results prompted a number of additional phase-II studies investigating neoadjuvant PD-1 pathway inhibition either alone or in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapies [190-192], which have demonstrated similar findings, although the rate of major pathologic response has varied. Several larger phase-III studies investigating PD-1 inhibition alone or in combination with standard of care chemotherapies are underway including CheckMate 816, KEYNOTE-671, and IMpassion030.\n\nPhase-II trials have demonstrated improved rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) when PD-1 inhibitors are administered to patients with locally advanced melanoma in the neoadjuvant setting. In an early trial of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade in combination with a BRAF/MEK inhibitor cocktail in melanoma patients with mutated BRAF, a pCR rate of 58% was achieved and impressive improvements in event-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] of 0.016) and distant metastasis-free survival (HR of 0.025) compared with standard-of-care surgery were seen [193]. A subsequent trial investigating neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibition alone or in combination with CTLA-4 inhibition enrolled 23 patients with locally advanced melanoma regardless of BRAF mutational status [194]. Combination PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade resulted in an impressive ORR of 73% and a pCR rate of 45%, but this was accompanied by substantial toxicity with 73% of patients developing grade 3 irAE. Monotherapy with PD-1 blockade was associated with an ORR of 25% and a pCR rate of 25% and had a much lower 8% rate of irAE; however, two of the patients in this group developed early disease progression preventing surgical resection during neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor treatment. The trial was stopped early due to the high rate of irAE in the combination PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibitor group and due to the low ORR in the PD-1 monotherapy group. This trial highlights the potential of neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitor therapy to improve outcomes but also emphasizes the relevance of irAE and the need to prioritize and preserve timely surgical resection when checkpoint inhibitors are used in the neoadjuvant setting with curative intent. Similar results were seen in another phase-II trial with combination neoadjuvant PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibition for locally advanced melanoma [195].\n\nMore recently, analyses from the International Melanoma Consortium (INMC) and the OpACIN-neo trial have confirmed high rates of pathologic response in patients with locally advanced melanoma receiving neoadjuvant PD-1 or combination PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade [196, 197]. The INMC pooled analysis found that, in the 52% of patients achieving either a pCR or near pCR, the 2-year relapse-free survival was 96% and overall survival was 100%. This represents a significant improvement over the 60% 2-year relapse-free survival in patients receiving PD-1 or combination PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade in the adjuvant setting. The magnitude of this benefit can be further appreciated when one considers that the majority of relapses in stage III melanoma occur within the first two years following surgery [198]. The OpACIN-neo trial similarly reported a 97% 2-year relapse-free survival in patients achieving a pathologic response after neoadjuvant combination PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade. Moreover, the OpACIN-neo tested three dosing schedules and found that a treatment regimen with a lower ipilimumab dose was associated with a much lower 20% rate of grade 3-4 irAE while maintaining a high pathologic response rate of 77% [199]. Higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and a high IFN-γ-related gene signature expression in pre-treatment biopsies were independently associated with attainment of pathologic response and a lower risk of recurrence [197]. Taken together, these data not only support the use of neoadjuvant PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade in locally advanced melanoma, but their comparison with outcomes from adjuvant studies provide real-world evidence that administration of checkpoint blockade before rather than after surgery may meaningfully enhance outcomes.\n\nNeoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy are commonly used in early-stage breast cancer treatment and it is well established that attainment of a pCR is associated with a superior prognosis in this disease. Recent studies have examined the addition of PD-1 pathway inhibition to these regimens. In one trial enrolling stage II and stage III patients, the rate of pCR at the time of surgery in patients with triple-negative (hormone receptor negative and ERBB2/Her2 negative) cancer was 60% in those receiving the PD-1 inhibitor and chemotherapy compared with 22% in those receiving chemotherapy alone [200]. Those with hormone receptor positive cancer had a 30% rate of pCR when PD-1 inhibition was included compared with 13% in those who received chemotherapy alone. Similar results were seen in other trials [201] and additional phase-III trials evaluating PD-1 inhibition in the perioperative management of early-stage breast cancer are now underway.\n\nDual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade is highly effective in advanced-stage mismatch repair deficient (MMRd) colorectal cancer. In a recent study examining neoadjuvant PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade in early-stage (I-III) MMRd colorectal cancer, a pathologic response was observed in 20 out of 20 MMRd patients and 19 of 20 patients had a major pathologic response (<10% viable tumor) [202]. This study also included patients with mismatch repair proficient (MMRp) colorectal cancer, a tumor type which does not respond to PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibition in the metastatic setting. Surprisingly, a pathologic response was seen in 4 out of 15 (27%) early-stage MMRp patients and three of these patients had a major pathologic response. Double-positive CD8+ PD-1+ T-cell infiltration appeared to be predictive of response in MMRp tumors.\n\nPD-1 blockade has demonstrated efficacy against a subset of advanced-stage metstatic urothelial cancers. A recent phase-II study investigated two cycles of neoadjuvant anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy before cystectomy in 95 patients with muscle-invasive urothelial cancer and found that 31% of patients attained a pCR [203]. Interestingly, although TMB is associated with response to checkpoint inhibition in meststatic urothelial cancer, it did not appear to predict outcome in the neoadjuvant setting. Similarly, PD-L1 positivity was not predictive of outcome. The degree of CD8 T-cell infiltration and the activation state of these T-cells as measured by the percentage of CD8+ granzyme-B+ T-cells did correlate with response.\n\nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a uniformly fatal malignancy that has suffered from a dearth of effective therapies [204, 205]. So far, trials of PD-1 inhibitors in recurrent glioblastoma, have failed to show a survival benefit over standard-of-care bevacizumab in newly diagnosed patients following surgery in combination with radiation, or in combination with radiation and temozolomide [205]. However, recent results suggest a potential benefit for PD-1 inhibition in the neoadjuvant setting. In a recent phase-II study, 35 patients with surgically-resectable, recurrent GBM were randomized to receive neoadjuvant plus adjuvant PD-1 inhibition or adjuvant PD-1 inhibition alone [127]. Patients receiving neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibition had a significantly longer median overall survival (13.7 months versus 7.5 months, HR 0.39, p=0.04) and a longer progression-free survival (3.3 months versus 2.4 months, p=0.03). Up regulation of T-cell and interferon gamma-related gene expression signatures and increased focal induction of PD-L1 was seen in resected tumors from the group that received neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibition. Additionally, enhanced clonal expansion of circulating T-cells was seen in patients from the neoadjuvant group when compared with those treated only in the adjuvant setting. Similar modulation of the inflammatory milieu of the tumor microenvironment was seen in a separate phase-II study with neoadjuvant plus adjuvant PD-1 inhibition in surgically-resectable recurrent GBM [206]. Neoadjuvant nivolumab resulted in higher immune cell infiltration and increased TCR clonal diversity among tumor-infiltrating T-cells. The median overall survival in this single-arm study was 7.3 months, which is in line with the historical prognosis for recurrent GBM [127, 206]. The primary endpoints of these studies were focused on biomarker investigation and future studies designed to prove clinical efficacy with adequate sample size calculations and clear clinical endpoint definitions will be necessary to determine whether neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibition is indeed beneficial in GBM [207]. Corticosteroid use should be minimized if possible to avoid deleterious effects on the anti-tumor immune response [208].\n\nV. Concluding Remarks and Outstanding Questions\n\nSince its initial discovery, we have come a long way in unraveling the complexity of the PD-1 pathway. Elucidation of the binding partners for PD-1 and its ligands, and the differential ability of PD-1 to regulate T cells in varying differentiation states and anatomical locations provides deeper understanding of the multifaceted functions of this important immunoregulatory pathway. These insights also raise important questions of fundamental and translational significance. The answers to these questions will continue to shape our understanding of the PD-1 pathway and how to effectively and safely apply PD-1 modulation to diverse patient populations.\n\nWhat is the optimal timing of administering PD-1 inhibitors relative to other therapies and/or surgery? Will use of PD-1 inhibitors in earlier stage disease and/or in the neoadjuvant setting improve patient outcomes? Administering PD-1 inhibitors in the neoadjuvant setting has the potential advantage of targeting anti-tumor immune responses when more antigen is present, which may be beneficial for expanding these immune responses. Additionally, preclinical data suggest that PD-1 inhibition may be most effective if administered when the tumor draining LN remains intact, which offers another potential advantage of administering PD-1 inhibitors in the neoadjuvant setting. As the clinical data begin to mature, it will be important to evaluate whether PD-1 inhibitors show increased efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting compared to the adjuvant setting, and whether this altered timing impacts the incidence or severity of irAEs.\n\nWhere are the most useful location and cell populations to sample for biomarker assessment? New insights into the locations where PD-1 inhibitors are acting raise questions about the ideal locations to sample to monitor responses to checkpoint-based immunotherapies. Further work is needed to determine the predictive value of sampling the tumor or the bloodas well as both PD-1+ CD8+ T cells and Treg.\n\nCan alternative methods of manipulating the PD-1 pathway be useful in cancer patients? To date, PD-1 manipulation in cancer patients has largely relied on use of PD-1 inhibitors in the form of monoclonal antibodies. The use of bispecific antibodies, which target PD-1 together with another receptor (e.g. CTLA-4, Tim-3, etc.) or cell type is an active area of investigation. Recent studies showing the opposing effects of PD-1 blockade on CD8+ T cells and Treg cells suggests that selective targeting of PD-1 to CD8+ T cells may be beneficial. In addition to use of PD-1 inhibitors, there is increasing interest in genetic manipulation of the PD-1 pathway in the setting of adoptive cell transfer therapies (e.g. CAR T cells, engineered T cells, etc.) Recent work has shown that complete PD-1 silencing impairs the anti-tumor function of CAR T cells [209], consistent with previous studies showing that complete genetic absence of PD-1 promotes terminal exhaustion in the preclinical setting [84]. It will be interesting to determine whether fine tuning PD-1 expression by targeting regulators of the receptor (e.g. epigenetic regulation) will be able to more durably improve functions.\n\nThe complexity added by the PD-L1/B7-1 interaction suggests several new therapeutic opportunities. One would be to combine PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockade. A second is to target the B7-1 dimerization surface, which might lead to enhanced PD-1 engagement of PD-1. Alternatively, this might be achieved with engineered B7-1 fusion proteins. A third might be to clinically test PD-L1 mAbs that block only the PD-L1/ B7-1 interaction.\n\n​\n\nThe PD-1 pathway plays multifaceted roles in regulating immune responses.\n\nPD-1 can modulate effector and memory T cells, Treg cells, NK cells, and ILCs.\n\nPD-1 regulates anti-tumor T cells in the draining lymph node as well as in the tumor.\n\nTiming of PD-1 inhibition may be important for durable anti-tumor immunity.\n\nPD-L1/B7-1 and PD-L2/RGMb/neogenin interactions broaden the impact of the pathway.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe apologize to those whose papers were not cited due to space constraints. was created with BioRender.com.
