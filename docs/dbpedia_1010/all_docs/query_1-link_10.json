We performed a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of related cohort studies published up to October 2022 investigating post-diagnosis a priori (diet quality indices) and a posteriori (data-driven) dietary patterns (DPs) in relation to all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using random-effects meta-analyses comparing highest versus lowest categories of adherence to DPs. We assessed heterogeneity and risk of bias in the selected studies. A total of 19 cohort studies with 38,846 adult CS, some assessing various DPs, were included in the meta-analyses. Higher adherence to a priori DPs was associated with lower all-cause mortality by 22% (HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.73–0.83, I2 = 22.6%) among all CS, by 22% (HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.73–0.84, I2 = 0%) among breast CS and by 27% (HR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.62–0.86, I2 = 41.4%) among colorectal CS. Higher adherence to a “prudent/healthy” DP was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64–0.97 I2 = 49.3%), whereas higher adherence to a “western/unhealthy” DP was associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.26–1.74, I2 = 0%) among all CS. Results for cancer-specific mortality were less clear. In conclusion, higher adherence to a “healthy” DP, either a priori or a posteriori, was inversely associated with all-cause mortality among CS. A “healthy” overall diet after cancer diagnosis could protect and promote longevity and well-being.

Notably, the occurrence of suicide frequently coincides with depressive episodes. Suicide is as a paramount global health concern that demands efficacious preventive strategies. Current psychiatric approaches heavily rely on pharmacological interventions but have had limited success in addressing the global burden of mental health issues. Suboptimal nutrition, with its impact on the neuroendocrine system, has been implicated in the underlying pathology of depressive disorders. Folate, a group of water-soluble compounds, plays a crucial role in various central nervous system functions. Depressed individuals often exhibit low levels of serum and red blood cell folate. Multiple studies and systematic reviews have investigated the efficacy of folic acid and its derivative, L-methylfolate, which can cross the blood–brain barrier, as stand-alone or adjunct therapies for depression. Although findings have been mixed, the available evidence generally supports the use of these compounds in depressed individuals. Recent studies have established links between the one-carbon cycle, folate–homocysteine balance, immune system function, glutamate excitation via NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, and gut microbiome eubiosis in mood regulation. These findings provide insights into the complex neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of folate and related compounds in depression. Through a comprehensive review of the existing literature, this study aims to advance our understanding of the therapeutic potential of folic acid and related compounds in depression treatment. It also seeks to explore their role in addressing suicidal tendencies and shed light on the neurobiological mechanisms involved, leveraging the latest discoveries in depression research.

However, postoperative gastrointestinal symptoms and insufficient nutritional intake are likely to occur, which are not conducive to physical health. A retrospective study aimed to investigate changes in nutritional status and associated factors in patients after sleeve gastrectomy. Data were collected from the medical records of patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy at a teaching hospital in Taiwan. Data from 120 patients who met the eligibility criteria were included in the analysis. The results show that sleeve gastrectomy has a strong weight loss effect. Within 12 months, the average body mass index of the patients decreased by 13.47 kg/m2. The number of morbidly obese patients decreased from 62 (51.7%) to 3 (2.5%). However, surgery is also associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and the threat of malnutrition. The number of patients with moderate to severe nutritional risk increased from 4 (3.3%) before surgery to 24 (20%) at 12-month follow-up. Likewise, the number of patients with anemia increased from 11 (9.2%) to 29 (24.17%). Gender, constipation, and diarrhea affected postoperative nutritional status. These findings suggest that patients after sleeve gastrectomy are at risk of malnutrition and require regular monitoring. Special attention should be given to women and patients with constipation or diarrhea, as they are at a particularly high risk of malnutrition.

This multifactorial skin disease is caused by complex interactions between various factors including genetics, environment, lifestyle, and diet. In eczema, apart from using an elimination diet, the adequate content of fatty acids from foods (saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids) plays an important role as an immunomodulatory agent. Different aspects regarding atopic dermatitis include connections between lipid metabolism in atopic dermatitis, with the importance of the MUFA levels, as well as of the omega-6/omega-3 balance that affects the formation of long-chain (C20 eicosanoic and C22 docosaenoic) fatty acids and bioactive lipids from them (such as prostaglandins). Impair/repair of the functioning of epidermal barrier is influenced by these fatty acid levels. The purpose of this review is to drive attention to membrane fatty acid composition and its involvement as the target of fatty acid supplementation. The membrane-targeted strategy indicates the future direction for dermatological research regarding the use of nutritional synergies, in particular using red blood cell fatty acid profiles as a tool for checking the effects of supplementations to reach the target and influence the inflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance of lipid mediators. This knowledge gives the opportunity to develop personalized strategies to create a healthy balance by nutrition with an anti-inflammatory outcome in skin disorders.

This network meta-analysis aimed to compare and rank the outcome-specific efficacy of different probiotic strains or combinations in adults with IBS. We searched the literature up to June 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy of probiotics in IBS were included. A frequentist framework was used to perform this study. In total, 9253 participants from 81 RCTs were included in the study. Four probiotic strains and five mixtures were significantly superior to placebo in improving IBS Symptom Severity Scale, among which Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1 ranked first (surface under the cumulative ranking, SUCRA, 92.9%). A mixture containing five probiotics (SUCRA, 100%) ranked first in improving the IBS-Quality of life. Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 (SUCRA, 96.9%) and Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2 (SUCRA, 92.6%) were among the most effective probiotics for improving abdominal pain. Three probiotic strains and two mixtures were effective in alleviating abdominal bloating. Four probiotic strains and a mixture were significantly superior to placebo in reducing the bowel movement frequency in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 (SUCRA, 99.6%) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 (SUCRA, 89.7%) were among the most effective probiotics for improving the Bristol stool form scale of IBS-D. Only some probiotics are effective for particular outcomes in IBS patients. This study provided the first ranking of outcome-specific efficacy of different probiotic strains and combinations in IBS. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.

The antioxidant potential of T. esculenta extracts obtained from leaves and fruit peels was investigated using biochemical and 3T3 cell line assays as well as in vivo assays using an organism model Tenebrio molitor. Four extracts were tested: hydroethanolic extracts from leaves (HF) and from fruit peels (HC), and infusion extracts from leaves (IF) and from fruit peels (IC). The biochemical assays demonstrated an antioxidant capacity verified by TAC, reducing power, DPPH, and copper chelating assays. None of the extracts exhibited cytotoxicity against 3T3 cells, instead offering a protection against CuSO4-induced oxidative stress. The antioxidant activity observed in the extracts, including their role as free radical scavengers, copper chelators, and stress protectors, was further confirmed by T. molitor assays. The CLAE-DAD analysis detected phenolic compounds, including gallic acid, rutin, and quercitrin, as the main constituents of the samples. This study highlights that leaf and fruit peels extracts of T. esculenta could be effective protectors against ROS and copper-induced stress in cellular and invertebrate models, and they should be considered as coadjutants in the treatment and prevention of diseases related to oxidative stress and for the development of natural nutraceutical products.

This review highlights the need for standardized criteria and explores nutraceuticals as potential therapeutic agents. Sarcopenic obesity is associated with insulin resistance, inflammation, hormonal changes, and reduced physical activity. These factors lead to impaired muscle activity, intramuscular fat accumulation, and reduced protein synthesis, resulting in muscle catabolism and increased fat mass. Myostatin and irisin are myokines that regulate muscle synthesis and energy expenditure, respectively. Nutritional supplementation with vitamin D and calcium is recommended for increasing muscle mass and reducing body fat content. Testosterone therapy decreases fat mass and improves muscle strength. Vitamin K, specifically menaquinone-4 (MK-4), improves mitochondrial function and reduces muscle damage. Irisin is a hormone secreted during exercise that enhances oxidative metabolism, prevents insulin resistance and obesity, and improves bone quality. Low-glycemic-index diets and green cardamom are potential methods for managing sarcopenic obesity. In conclusion, along with exercise and dietary support, nutraceuticals, such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin K, and natural agonists of irisin or testosterone, can serve as promising future therapeutic alternatives.

Postpartum depression may negatively affect maternal sociodemographic and anthropometric parameters and lifestyle factors. Nutrition has recently been identified as a crucial factor for the management and co-treatment of postpartum depression. This survey aims to determine the possible association of postpartum depression with mothers’ socio-demographic and anthropometric characteristics, perinatal outcomes, breastfeeding practices, and Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence. Methods: This is a cross-sectional survey, which was performed on 3941 women during the postpartum period. Postpartum depression was assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Anthropometric parameters and perinatal outcomes were retrieved from mothers’ medical records. Sociodemographic data and breastfeeding practices were recorded by face-to-face interviews between enrolled mothers and trained personnel. Mediterranean diet adherence was assessed by MedDietScore. Both univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression were applied for analyzing our data. Results. Postpartum depression was significantly associated with lower educational level, Greek nationality, higher prevalence of multiparity and overweight/obesity postpartum, higher incidence of caesarean section and not breastfeeding, and lower levels of MD adherence. In multivariate analysis, postpartum depression was independently associated with mothers’ educational level, postpartum BMI status, type of delivery, breastfeeding practices, and MD adherence after adjusting for multiple confounding factors. Conclusions: This study has provided evidence that elevated MD compliance was related to a decreased risk of postpartum depression.

Accumulating evidence suggests that certain probiotic strains exert beneficial effects on age-related cognitive decline. Our previous study revealed that Lactobacillus helveticus WHH1889 attenuated symptoms of anxiety and depression in depressed mice via shaping the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) metabolism and gut microbial community, indicating the psychobiotic potential of WHH1889. In the present study, the effects of WHH1889 on age-related cognitive decline were investigated. WHH1889 was orally administrated (1 × 109 CFU/day) for twelve weeks in aged mice, and their cognitive behaviors, neurochemical factors, cognitive-related gene expressions, neuroinflammation, and serum tryptophan pathway-targeted metabolic profiling, as well as gut microbiome composition were assessed. WHH1889 demonstrated improvement of the cognitive behaviors via the novel object recognition test (NORT), the active shuttle avoidance test (ASAT), the Y-maze test, and the passive avoidance test (PAT). The hippocampal neuronal loss; the declined concentrations of BDNF, 5-HT, and 5-HTP; the decreased gene expressions of neurodegeneration biomarkers; and the increased production of hippocampal inflammatory cytokines in aged mice were restored by WHH1889. In addition, WHH1889 increased the 5-HT/5HTP levels and decreased the serum levels of tryptophan-derived metabolites (e.g., kynurenine, xanthurenic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid). Furthermore, WHH1889 was revealed to shape the gut microbiota community by reversing the relative abundances of Bacteroidota and Firmicutes. The present findings suggest that L. helveticus WHH1889 exerted cognitive improving effects on aged mice, which was associated with the modulation of 5-HT and 5-HTP metabolism and gut microbial composition. The supplementation of WHH1889 may therefore be a promising therapeutic agent for age-related cognitive deficits.

Despite growing public interest in orthorexia, its classification as a distinct eating disorder remains a subject of ongoing debate in the mental health community. This paper comprehensively reviews the current literature on orthorexia nervosa, exploring the prevalence rates, risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment options. The paper offers an overview of orthorexia and its historical context and explores the challenges and considerations in diagnosing orthorexia and orthorexia nervosa. Specifically, the distinction between “orthorexia” and “orthorexia nervosa” is a debated issue in eating disorder research due to a lack of clear diagnostic criteria, making it challenging to accurately differentiate between an obsession with healthy eating and a more severe form with potential distress and impairment. Given the absence of formal diagnostic criteria, developing valid and reliable assessment tools is crucial to accurately identify and treat individuals experiencing these disorders. The paper’s final section covers the existing treatment approaches for orthorexia nervosa. Overall, the paper highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of orthorexia nervosa. This review contributes to the ongoing discourse surrounding orthorexia and provides valuable insights for clinicians, researchers, and stakeholders in the mental health and eating disorders fields.

This study aimed to investigate the polygenic variants associated with hypothyroidism risk and the interaction of polygenic risk scores (PRS) with dietary patterns in influencing disease risk in 56,664 participants aged >40 in a hospital-based cohort. The participants were classified as having hypothyroidism (n = 870) diagnosed by a physician and no hypothyroidism (n = 55,794). Genetic variants associated with hypothyroidism were identified using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Genetic variants interacting with each other were selected using a generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis, and the PRS generated was evaluated for interaction with lifestyle parameters. Coffee, alcohol, meat intake, and a Korean balanced diet were inversely associated with hypothyroidism risk, as were selenium, copper, and manganese intakes. White blood cell (WBC) counts and serum alkaline phosphatase and triglyceride concentrations were positively associated with hypothyroidism risk, as were osteoporosis and thyroid cancer. The GMDR analysis generated a three-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) model comprising dual oxidase-1 (DUOX1)_rs1648314; thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR)_rs75664963; and major histocompatibility complex, class-II, DQ Alpha-1 (HLA-DQA1)_rs17426593. The PRS derived from the three- and seven-SNP models were associated with a 2.11- and 2.32-fold increase in hypothyroidism risk, respectively. Furthermore, the PRS from the three-SNP model showed interactions with WBC counts, wherein the positive association with hypothyroidism risk was more pronounced in participants with low WBC counts than those with high WBC counts (≥4 × 109 /L). Dietary patterns, such as the plant-based diet (PBD) and the Western-style diet (WSD), along with smoking status, exhibited interactions with the PRS, influencing hypothyroidism risk. In participants with a high PRS, those in the high-PBD, low-WSD, and smoker groups had a higher proportion of hypothyroidism than those in the low-PBD, high-WSD, and non-smoker groups. In conclusion, genetic variants related to immunity and thyroid hormone secretion were linked to hypothyroidism risk, and their PRS interacted with PBD and WSD intake and smoking status. These results contribute to a better understanding of hypothyroidism and its prevention strategies for precision medicine intervention.

Fruit consumption has been associated with a decrease in blood pressure. Lemon juice, which contains antihypertensive compounds, may exert antihypertensive effects. However, no research has verified the antihypertensive effects of citric acid, the most abundant ingredient in lemon juice. In the present study, we demonstrated the antihypertensive effects of citric acid and lemon juice by performing single oral administration tests and the aortic ring assay using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Single oral doses of both agents markedly reduced the systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the SHRs. In addition, both these agents relaxed the thoracic aorta from the SHRs; however, these effects were notably attenuated by the removal of the aortic endothelium. Orally administered citric acid was rapidly absorbed and metabolized in vivo. Among the functional compounds in lemon juice, citric acid was identified as the primary antihypertensive component. Although more detailed studies are required to validate our findings, the novel functional attributes of citric acid can achieve the normalization of blood pressure when it is consumed via diet.

The intake of Boswellia + AvailOm® improved the quality of life (QoL) (WOMAC index) and some variables of muscle strength. Statistically significant differences between the AvailOm® and the placebo groups in the decrease of pain intensity were found. Weekly VAS scores showed a significant decrease in pain perception when comparing the AvailOm® product to the placebo, with the lowest VAS scores at week 8. Consumption of Boswellia improved sleep latency. The time to perform the Up and Go test decreased after the intake of AvailOm®. There was an increase in the omega-3 fatty acids, with the greatest increase in the Boswellia + AvailOm® group.

Outpatient treatment of severe acute malnutrition requires ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs), but concerns have been raised about the acceptability of globally available products. Culturally acceptable RUTFs could be locally developed, but data are lacking on RUTF preferences in Lao PDR. Methods: In a crossover-designed study, four different RUTFs were tested for short-term acceptability and organoleptic qualities (two globally available: peanut-based, which is the current standard, and wheat–milk-based RUTFs; two regionally produced: a mung-bean-based and a fish–rice-based RUTF). Organoleptic properties were evaluated by 83 caretaker–child pair participants through a taste test and a 30 min consumption test. Short-term acceptability was assessed through a 3-day intake test. The study sites were in Phongsaly (North Laos) and Attapeu (South Laos). Focus group discussions were conducted at the beginning and the end of the study. Results: The mung bean RUTF was the favorite among caretakers, with an acceptability percentage of 96.2%, and scored better (p-value < 0.05) for all organoleptic variables than the other three RUTFs. Overall, 3 days after receiving take-home rations, the mean percentage of consumption was above 80% for all the RUTFs, with the mung bean product being the most consumed. Conclusions: The regionally produced mung bean RUTF was the most accepted, whereas the other regionally produced fish-based RUTF was the least accepted, showing the complexity of finding culturally acceptable solutions to fight malnutrition. For Lao PDR, a mung-bean-based RUTF seems the way forward, even if the current standard peanut-based RUTF appeared to be acceptable, albeit not the most preferred.

The aim of this study was to characterise the effect of three probiotic strains on CFRGD by means of a dynamic in vitro simulation of the colonic fermentation (SHIME®). The configuration of the system included three bioreactors colonised with the faecal inoculum of a child with cystic fibrosis. For 20 days, each bioreactor was supplied daily with either Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103 TM), Limosilactobacillus reuteri (DSM 17938) or Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (DSM 22266). The baseline microbiota was characterised by a high abundance of Prevotella, Faecalibacterium and Acidaminococcus genera. After 20 days of supplementation, L. rhamnosus and L. plantarum reduced Prevotella significantly, and the three strains led to increased Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium and decreased Acidaminococcus, with some of these changes being maintained 10 days after ceasing supplementation. The metabolic activity remained unaltered in terms of short-chain fatty acids, but branched-chain fatty acids showed a significant decrease, especially with L. plantarum. Additionally, ammonia decreased at 20 days of supplementation, and lactate continuously increased with the three strains. The effects on colonic microbiota of L. rhamnosus, L. reuteri or L. plantarum were established, including increased beneficial bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium, and beneficial metabolites such as lactate; and on the other hand, a reduction in pathogenic genera, including Prevotella or Acidaminococcus and branched-chain fatty acids, overall supported their use as probiotics in the context of CFRGD.

Particularly notable is traditional Taiwanese-style thick soup, where the incorporation of vinegar plays a fundamental role in imparting distinct flavors. In the context of this experimental investigation, the foundational base of Taiwanese-style thick soup serves as the platform for a meticulously planned sensory and dietary behavior evaluation. Our research methodology combines the use of survey questionnaires and experimental techniques, employing purposive sampling and snowball sampling methods to recruit participants. The central focus of this study is to understand consumers’ culinary preferences when presented with a choice between two contrasting types of vinegar—specifically, black vinegar and balsamic vinegar—as alternative gastronomic enhancements. This precise orchestration of data collection and systematic evaluation provides a perceptive window into participants’ culinary inclinations and food choices, resulting in a detailed and profound understanding of their taste preferences. The empirical findings stemming from this experimentation reveal notably significant differences in the sensory assessments among participants engaging in diverse culinary experiences. Notably, distinct variations are observed in terms of visual perceptions, olfactory distinctions, and overall sensory satisfaction. This study occupies a crucial position within existing research paradigms by strategically expanding the scope of sensory investigations within the realm of Taiwanese-style thick soup. This introduces an innovative aspect represented by the introduction of balsamic vinegar as a compelling alternative to the customary black vinegar. As a result, the emerging findings not only offer compelling insights into the nuanced food choice and taste preferences of consumers, but also open up new and innovative directions within the complex tapestry of Chinese gastronomy.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of a child’s respiratory tract infection on the cellular composition of breast milk (neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and their subpopulations). Twenty-six breastfeeding mothers whose children were hospitalized for respiratory tract infections were enrolled in the study. The control group consisted of 23 mothers of healthy children. Regarding the children, baseline laboratory blood tests were performed, and nasal swabs were taken for the presence of RS virus. In the next step, milk samples were collected from the mothers to assess the cellular composition of the milk, including neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and their subpopulations. Significantly higher percentages of T lymphocytes (helper and cytotoxic lymphocytes) were observed in the milk of the studied mothers. There was a significantly higher percentage of milk lymphocytes in the group of affected children with confirmed RSV etiology than in children with excluded RSV etiology. A significant positive correlation was observed between the duration of infection and the percentage of milk NK cells and between milk CD19 lymphocytes and the child’s serum leukocytosis. This study may provide evidence of a link between cells in breast milk and disease in the breastfed infant. The severity of the infection, its duration, and the etiological agent of the infection may affect the cellular composition of milk.

We randomized the participants (n = 60) into equal groups receiving either a beverage containing cacao flavanols (240 mg/200 mL/day) or a placebo for 8 weeks. Before and after the 8-week treatment, we determined the participants’ Chalder fatigue scale (CFS) scores, various mood states, autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity levels, and their ANS balance. The results demonstrated that among the mood states, the indicators of negative mood (e.g., depression, fatigue, and anger) and the total mood disturbance score were significantly lower in the cacao group compared to the placebo group after the treatment (p < 0.05). The change in the index of positive mood (i.e., vigor) from baseline to 8 weeks was significantly higher in the cacao group versus the placebo group (p < 0.05). There were no significant between-group differences in the changes in the CFS score or ANS activity level. The consumption of flavanol-rich cacao extract both suppressed negative moods and promoted positive moods in healthy middle-aged women. These results suggest that cacao flavanols may be a useful food material that can improve variable mood conditions in middle-aged women and support their active lives.

Conversely, low 25(OH)D status increases susceptibility to infections and developing autoimmunity. This systematic review examines vitamin D’s mechanisms and effects on enhancing innate and acquired immunity against microbes and preventing autoimmunity. The study evaluated the quality of evidence regarding biology, physiology, and aspects of human health on vitamin D related to infections and autoimmunity in peer-reviewed journal articles published in English. The search and analyses followed PRISMA guidelines. Data strongly suggested that maintaining serum 25(OH)D concentrations of more than 50 ng/mL is associated with significant risk reduction from viral and bacterial infections, sepsis, and autoimmunity. Most adequately powered, well-designed, randomized controlled trials with sufficient duration supported substantial benefits of vitamin D. Virtually all studies that failed to conclude benefits or were ambiguous had major study design errors. Treatment of vitamin D deficiency costs less than 0.01% of the cost of investigation of worsening comorbidities associated with hypovitaminosis D. Despite cost-benefits, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency remains high worldwide. This was clear among those who died from COVID-19 in 2020/21—most had severe vitamin D deficiency. Yet, the lack of direction from health agencies and insurance companies on using vitamin D as an adjunct therapy is astonishing. Data confirmed that keeping an individual’s serum 25(OH)D concentrations above 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) (and above 40 ng/mL in the population) reduces risks from community outbreaks, sepsis, and autoimmune disorders. Maintaining such concentrations in 97.5% of people is achievable through daily safe sun exposure (except in countries far from the equator during winter) or taking between 5000 and 8000 IU vitamin D supplements daily (average dose, for non-obese adults, ~70 to 90 IU/kg body weight). Those with gastrointestinal malabsorption, obesity, or on medications that increase the catabolism of vitamin D and a few other specific disorders require much higher intake. This systematic review evaluates non-classical actions of vitamin D, with particular emphasis on infection and autoimmunity related to the immune system.

The excessive consumption of sweetened non-alcoholic beverages represents an important risk factor for health, especially when it is accompanied by an unbalanced diet and a disordered lifestyle. In order to evaluate the consumption of non-alcoholic beverages correlated with the evaluation of the main lifestyle factors that can affect the state of health among Romanians, a cross-sectional observational study was carried out based on a questionnaire. The results of the study indicate that among the most consumed non-alcoholic drinks are coffee and sweetened carbonated and non-carbonated drinks, which are indicated as being responsible for the development of consumption addictions: 44% for coffee, 16.5% for sweetened or tonic carbonated drinks and 12% for sweetened non-carbonated drinks. Considering that the consumption of coffee is usually associated with sweeteners, there is a risk of excessive caffeine and caloric intake in a context where a lack of exercise predominates (59.98%) among respondents declaring that they do sports rarely or not at all, which can lead, in the long term, to the appearance of imbalances either of a psycho-emotional nature or of a metabolic nature. A significant link was found between sports activity and the environment in which they work (χ2 = 51.33, p = 0.05). Respondents with a daily activity that involves movement (working outdoors, working on a construction site) are also those who usually do sports, while 60.67% of the respondents who work a lot in front of the computer declared that they do sports very rarely or not at all. Reducing the excessive consumption of sweetened drinks can be achieved through an appropriate consumption of water and fruits and by intensifying physical activity as a way of counterbalancing the excess caloric intake.

Our objective was to identify the health needs of elderly people living in extreme poverty in Requena (Peru) by means of a geriatric assessment of the nutritional and functional spheres to design, in the future, a cooperation project appropriate to the needs detected. This is an observational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study. Sixty participants were included, and sociodemographic and functional status variables were analyzed using the MNA and Barthel scales and the Get Up and Go test. The mean age of the participants was 79 ± 6.67 (women 55% and men 45%), where 60% had frailty. A statistically significant relationship was found between the MNA scores and Barthel test. Eighty-five percent were malnourished or at risk and thirteen percent had total or moderate dependence. We conclude that the nutritional status of the elderly was deficient. The high degree of living alone in which they live forces them to maintain their independence and their walking stability is normal. The situation of frailty exceeds the national average, a situation that has repercussions for their quality of life. We found a statistically significant association between nutritional status, dependence, and frailty. The better-nourished elderly are less frail and less dependent.

Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: supplemented with vitamin D3 (VitD, n = 15) and treated with vegetable oil (PL, n = 21). Administration lasted for 12 weeks. The isotope dilution method by LC-MS/MS was applied to measure KP and vitamin D metabolites. Serum concentrations of cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α were measured using ELISA kits. After administration, the serum concentration of TNF-α decreased in PD patients with DBS. Moreover, in KP: 3-hydroksykynurenine (3-HK) was increased in the PL group, picolinic acid was decreased in the PL group, and kynurenic acid tended to be higher after administration. Furthermore, a negative correlation between 3-HK and 25(OH)D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 was noticed. Our preliminary results provide further evidence regarding a key link between the KP substances, inflammation status, and metabolites of vitamin D in PD patients with DBS. These findings may reflect the neuroprotective abilities of vitamin D3 in PD patients with DBS.

Methods: Children with newly diagnosed Crohn’s disease (CD) who had MRI enterography (MRE) and BIA and had at least 12 months of follow-up were included. Total psoas muscle area (TPMA) and total paravertebral muscle (TPVM) were measured and compared to subjects’ lean mass and the lean mass body index (LMBI) was assessed by BIA. Results: 30 newly diagnosed children with CD were included (mean age 14.2 years, 53% male). Sarcopenia was found in 13 (43%) children; mean TPMA was 15.2 (1.1 SD) cm2 and TPVM 30.95 (1.7 SD) cm2. A highly positive correlation was shown for lean mass assessed by BIA and TPMA (0.706, p < 0.001) and TPVM (0.75, p < 0.001). Sarcopenia was more prevalent in boys (77% vs. 24%, p = 0.004), patients with the perianal disease (69% vs. 29%, p = 0.03), and children with sarcopenia were likely to receive anti-TNF (77% vs. 41%, p = 0.05). During the follow-up period, 16 (53%) children experienced a relapse. TPMA (HR 0.99, p = 0.018) and TPVM (HR 0.99, p = 0.031) values were statistically significant risk factors for relapse. Conclusion: A high proportion of patients with CD have sarcopenia at the time of the diagnosis. There is a good correlation between muscle mass assessed by MRI and BIA. Because MRI is performed in a great proportion of newly diagnosed CD patients it can also be used to assess the presence of sarcopenia.

While there is a relatively robust body of evidence on health and nutrition labelling, less is known about the effectiveness of sustainability labelling in facilitating sustainable food choices. This paper investigates the impact of sustainability labelling on consumer understanding, attitudes, and behaviour to support a more nuanced, detailed, and holistic understanding of the evidence. Using a narrative literature review methodology, the paper assesses studies covering environmental, social, and/or animal welfare aspects of sustainability labelling on food products. We found that consumer understanding of sustainability information is often limited, which could hinder behaviour change. While sustainability labelling can influence consumer attitudes and purchasing behaviours, evidence from real consumer settings tends to show small effect sizes. Consumers are generally willing to pay more for sustainability-labelled products, and organic labelling often leads to the highest reported willingness to pay. The review emphasises the importance of trust, suggesting a preference for labelling backed by governments or public authorities. Sustainability labelling that uses intuitively understandable cues has an increased impact, with visual aids such as traffic light colours showing promise. We conclude that further research is needed in real-world settings, using representative populations and exploring the influence of demographic factors, values, and attitudes.

However, brief validated measures of disordered eating in Indian contexts are scarce. This study adapted and validated a culturally appropriate English language version of the Child Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (ChEDE-Q) among 385 adolescents (mean age = 13.42 years; 47.3% girls) in urban India. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a two-factor eight-item solution had an acceptable fit to the data across gender: an ‘Eating Concerns and Restraint’ subscale and a ‘Weight and Shape Concerns’ subscale. Further, the questionnaire can be utilised as both a unidimensional and multidimensional tool. This allows for the computation of a total score on the primary factor of ‘Child Eating Pathology’, as well as the two subscales. Internal consistency of the ‘Weight and Shape Concerns’ subscale (α = 0.825) and ‘Eating Concerns and Restraint’ subscale (α = 0.649) was satisfactory. Concurrent validity was established through medium significant correlations with measures of body image and broader mental health. The results support the use of the ChEDE-Q for assessing disordered eating among urban Indian adolescents, thus providing the research community and practitioners with a measure to investigate the nature and scale of disordered eating among adolescents in India.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and smartphone technologies have enabled applications to conduct automatic nutritional assessment from meal images, providing a convenient, efficient, and accurate method for continuous diet evaluation. We now extend the goFOODTM automatic system to perform food segmentation, recognition, volume, as well as calorie and macro-nutrient estimation from single images that are captured by a smartphone. In order to assess our system’s performance, we conducted a feasibility study with 50 participants from Switzerland. We recorded their meals for one day and then dietitians carried out a 24 h recall. We retrospectively analysed the collected images to assess the nutritional content of the meals. By comparing our results with the dietitians’ estimations, we demonstrated that the newly introduced system has comparable energy and macronutrient estimation performance with the previous method; however, it only requires a single image instead of two. The system can be applied in a real-life scenarios, and it can be easily used to assess dietary intake. This system could help individuals gain a better understanding of their dietary consumption. Additionally, it could serve as a valuable resource for dietitians, and could contribute to nutritional research.

Some of the impacts of the pandemic were increased psychological distress, emotional eating, higher consumption of high-sugar foods and drinks, and a more sedentary lifestyle. This study examined BMI changes over time and their associations with psychological distress and lifestyle changes. This population-based cohort study had 24,968 baseline participants and 15,904 and 9442 one- and two-year follow-ups, respectively. Weight, height, psychological distress, high-sugar foods and drinks, physical activity, and emotional eating were assessed. These factors and BMI were examined at baseline and over time. We used mediation analyses and structural equation modeling to determine how psychological distress affects BMI. The mean BMI was 25.7 kg/m2 at baseline and 26.2 kg/m2 at two years. High psychological distress, daily emotional eating, and low physical activity were associated with higher BMI at baseline and higher yearly increases in BMI compared to reference levels. Emotional eating mediated 33% of the psychological distress BMI effect. Overall, BMI increased during the pandemic. Psychological distress during the pandemic was linked to weight gain partly through emotional eating. This association remained strong over time during different stages of the pandemic.

The objective of this study was to determine the cost of acute malnutrition treatment and how it is influenced by treatment protocol and programme size. We conducted a costing study in Kabléwa and N’Guigmi, Diffa region, where children with acute malnutrition aged 6–59 months were treated either with a standard or simplified protocol, respectively. Cost data were collected from accountancy records and through key informant interviews. Programme data were extracted from health centre records. In Kabléwa, where 355 children were treated, the cost per child treated was USD 187.3 (95% CI: USD 171.4; USD 203.2). In N’Guigmi, where 889 children were treated, the cost per child treated was USD 110.2 (95% CI: USD 100.0; USD 120.3). Treatment of moderate acute malnutrition was cheaper than treatment of severe acute malnutrition. In a modelled scenario sensitivity analysis with an equal number of children in both areas, the difference in costs between the two locations was reduced from USD 77 to USD 11. Our study highlighted the significant impact of programme size and coverage on treatment costs, that cost can differ significantly between neighbouring locations, and that it can be reduced by using a simplified protocol.

This online cross-sectional survey aimed to explore the health behaviours, attitudes and beliefs of adults of reproductive age in regard to preconception health and care. The survey was developed by reviewing the previous literature and engaging with those from the target group. It is one of the first surveys to assess the attitudes and beliefs of adults of reproductive age across the Island of Ireland regarding preconception health and care. Results from 386 individuals with a mean age of 29.9 ± 10.3 years were included. A variety of health behaviours, attitudes and beliefs were investigated, with differences being identified between women and men and between participants with or without children (i.e., in the preconception or interconception stage). The majority of respondents held beliefs that preconception care was important, but there was greater emphasis on women than men in terms of the need to engage in health-promoting preconception health behaviours. This study highlights the need to improve preconception health awareness in women and men in the preconception and interconception stage. Findings indicate that efforts to improve preparation for pregnancy among adults of childbearing age are needed, to ensure optimal engagement in preconception health behaviours, with efforts being tailored based on sex and parental status.
