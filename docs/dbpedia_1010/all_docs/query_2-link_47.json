        "text": "May 20, 2024—As we make headway into 2024, several trends continue to shape the aesthetics industry, driven by innovative technologies and shifting consumer preferences. In this fast-changing industry, offering treatments that align with consumer preferences is crucial for aesthetic practices looking to succeed in today’s competitive market.\n\nJoin us as we uncover some of Sciton’s most sought-after solutions for today’s top aesthetic trends.\n\nNon-invasive procedures: Minimal downtime, visible results\n\nData from the Aesthetic Society reveals a notable surge in the demand for non-invasive energy-based procedures.1 The trend is substantiated by findings from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) Procedural Statistics Release report, which shows that non-invasive procedures, such as laser treatments, continue to gain traction. According to the ASPS report, skin resurfacing treatments, pulsed light treatments, and combination laser treatments were among the top five cosmetic procedures.2\n\nThe demand for non-invasive treatments stems from a broader cultural transition towards prejuvenation treatments, which offer “preventative” care.2 Embraced by younger patients, prejuvenation treatments, such as Sciton’s MOXI™ laser, aim to delay or circumvent the need for more invasive procedures in the future.\n\nMeet the rising demand for prejuvenation with MOXI™\n\nAs the demand for prejuvenation treatments increases among millennials, aesthetic practices can capitalize on this opportunity with Sciton’s 1927 nm fractionated, non-ablative laser, MOXI.\n\nMOXI is ideal for patients who want to maintain beautiful skin with little to no downtime or discomfort or those looking to delay the appearance of aging skin.\n\nBenefits of MOXI\n\nQuick and convenient: The MOXI laser treatment is a swift 12–15-minute lunchtime procedure for skin revitalization, light correction, and overall skin health maintenance for all skin types and ages.\n\nIn a recent NewBeauty article, Dr. Quenby Erickson, DO, FAAD, FACMS, a board-certified Chicago-based dermatologist, says MOXI is the perfect treatment for maintaining youthful and healthy skin. “While most lasers are for correcting various skin conditions, MOXI is perfect for keeping your skin looking young and healthy. It is also great for stubborn pigment and even safe and effective for melasma.”3\n\nAddress melasma symptoms: The MOXI laser effectively targets the dermal pigment associated with melasma. While it can’t treat the underlying cause of melasma, MOXI targets water within pigmented cells, causing them to denature. The body then naturally eliminates these cells and replaces them with pigment-free ones.\n\nWhile a permanent cure for melasma remains elusive, providers can effectively manage the condition’s visible signs with a series of MOXI treatments and a yearly skin maintenance regimen.\n\n“If you are trying to correct something like melasma, pigmentation, or red spots, we usually recommend a series of MOXI treatments, sometimes in combo with BBL [BroadBand Light]. Usually, three to four treatments spaced six to eight weeks apart, and then yearly maintenance to maintain results,” says Dr. Lesley Loss, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in Rochester, NY. 3\n\nSkyrocketing brand awareness: Since its debut in June 2020, MOXI has gained traction as a highly desired ‘Hollywood treatment,’ with celebrities and bloggers touting its effectiveness on social media. Consequently, MOXI’s brand awareness has grown immensely.\n\nRecent data reveals that MOXI’s online search demand has surged by 900%, treatment volume has increased by 117%, and, according to QSight data, MOXI has achieved a 48% market share in the industry. The MOXI laser also boasts a 91% RealSelf.com Worth It Rating and was recently awarded New Beauty’s 2024 Best Low-Downtime Laser Treatment.\n\nSocial media’s impact on current beauty trends\n\nThe rise in prejuvenation treatments is closely tied to social media’s influence on beauty trends.\n\nThe ASPS report reveals that the uptick in cosmetic procedures is driven by the pervasive influence of social media and the prevalence of selfies. As individuals frequently see themselves and others online, there’s a growing desire to improve their appearance. Influencers and celebrities are also becoming more transparent about their cosmetic enhancements on social media, further fueling the increase in cosmetic treatments.2\n\nAccording to an article by McKinsey & Company, consumers are shifting away from the polished “Instagram face” to the more expressive “TikTok face,” highlighting the impact of social media on current beauty trends. 4\n\nInstagram face, as described by The New Yorker magazine, is “a young face … with poreless skin and plump, high cheekbones. It has catlike eyes, long, cartoonish lashes, a small, neat nose, and full, lush lips.” 5 In contrast, TikTok face embraces a more natural aesthetic, forgoing a filtered or edited appearance in favor of authenticity, in line with the spontaneous nature of TikTok’s content.\n\nThe transition towards more natural-looking results reflects a larger cultural trend that values authenticity and personal expression in cosmetic choices.\n\nTweakments: The burgeoning trend sweeping the beauty industry\n\nReflecting the current trend of a more natural and authentic aesthetic, ‘tweakments,’ such as Botox®, fillers, and laser treatments, are rising in popularity.\n\nTweakments appeal to consumers seeking quick, subtle enhancements with the flexibility to customize for more dramatic transformations. Gaining popularity due to their minimal to no downtime, tweakments can be easily integrated into patients’ busy schedules.\n\nAccording to the ASPS report, the demand for tweakments among men has grown 253% since 2019, highlighting their broadening appeal. 2\n\nPractices that include tweakments in their service menu have the potential to earn more revenue. According to Matt Taranto, president of Mint Aesthetics, a leading med spa training and consulting company, tweakments like neurotoxins, dermal fillers, and laser and light therapies, including Sciton’s Broad Band Light® technology and HALO® laser treatment, account for nearly 60% of revenue in his top clinics.6\n\nHere are some of today’s most popular tweakments:\n\nLaser treatments\n\nHALO®, Sciton’s hybrid fractional laser, stands out for its unique dual-wavelength capabilities. By combining non-ablative and ablative wavelengths in a single pass, HALO allows providers to tailor the depth of treatment, effectively addressing a broad range of skin concerns.\n\nBenefits of HALO\n\nSkin revitalization for all skin types: HALO simultaneously targets the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, acne scars, enlarged pores, skin dullness, and pigmented lesions in all skin types. The treatment achieves a visible improvement in the appearance of aged or damaged skin, often in just one to two treatments.\n\nOptimal ROI and lucrative revenue: Sciton’s highest net revenue fractional procedure generates over $20,000 monthly revenue for top-performing practices in states like Ohio, Washington, North Carolina, Michigan, and Montana. This demonstrates HALO’s broad patient appeal and revenue potential across diverse locations.7\n\nHigh brand recognition and demand: HALO is consistently awarded accolades for outstanding results and high patient satisfaction. Most recently, this iconic treatment was named 2023’s Best Multitasking Laser by New Beauty for its ability to address skin pigmentation, tone, and texture in as little as one treatment session with minimal downtime.\n\nPulsed light treatments\n\nBBL® HEROic™, Sciton’s newest groundbreaking pulsed light technology effectively targets a broad spectrum of skin conditions to enhance tone, texture, elasticity, and skin’s overall appearance. The treatment is a powerful minimal-to-no-downtime solution for sun damage, rosacea, redness, dullness, pigmented lesions, vascular issues, and other skin quality issues.\n\nBenefits of BBL HEROic\n\nSwift full-body treatments: With sessions typically lasting 20–30 minutes, BBL HEROic significantly enhances patient flow and drives substantial revenue growth for practices.\n\nAccording to Erin Hennessey, DNP, APRN, FNP-C, owner of Blush Aesthetics in Toledo, OH, HEROic‘s quick and consistent treatment times significantly increase treatment volume. “Somebody can come in on their lunch hour, get their makeup off, get treated, put their makeup right back on, and go out into the world. We can turn that room over and do four treatments in one room during a lunch hour,” says Hennessey.\n\nNEW 532+™ BBL® Filter: HEROic is the latest evolution in Sciton’s best-selling BroadBand Light (BBL) product line. With a new 532+ BBL narrowband filter, HEROic can now treat vascular and pigmented lesions, such as thready vessels around the nose and low-contrast, recalcitrant pigmented lesions like seborrheic keratoses.\n\nDr. Sherrif Ibrahim, MD, Ph.D., a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Rochester Dermatologic Surgery in Rochester, New York, uses the new filter to address vascular and pigment skin concerns. “I use the HEROic 532+ BBL filter for both vascular and pigment, such as small vessels or redness, but there is nothing like it for the small seborrheic keratoses lesions.”\n\nStreamlined training: HEROic’s automated intelligence flattens the learning curve for providers and their staff, eliminating common user technique errors, such as double pulsing and alignment gaps. Kaitlyn Jones, board-certified PA-C in Nashville, TN, delegates HEROic to her staff with confidence. “HEROic is so much easier … I can delegate it to staff without being concerned about striping, gaps, or double pulsing. It’s been a game-changer in our practice.”\n\nStacked treatments with radiofrequency (RF) microneedling\n\nRF microneedling has gained popularity in recent years as a minimal downtime skin revitalization treatment for all skin types. Combining RF microneedling with other energy-based treatments is one of today’s dominant aesthetic trends.\n\nWhen combined with MOXI or BBL HEROic, RF microneedling significantly improves skin health by targeting different layers of the skin. For example, while MOXI works on the skin’s surface layers to improve the appearance of tone and texture, fine lines, uneven pigmentation, sun damage, and mild scarring, RF microneedling penetrates deeper into the skin, addressing skin concerns like the appearance of enlarged pores, skin laxity, and deeper scars.Combining both treatments can address a wide range of skin concerns, yielding more noticeable, longer-lasting results.8\n\nDr. Jason Emer, MD, a board-certified dermatologic surgeon says both BBL and microneedling can be performed together in the same session. “These treatments [BBL and microneedling] can be done on the same day … Keep in mind, a combination approach is needed for the most improvement of sunspots and pigmentation,” he says. Read his full response on RealSelf.com here.9\n\nPersonalized skincare through combination therapy\n\nPatients no longer want a one-size-fits-all method; they want customized solutions that cater to their unique skin types, skin concerns, and lifestyles. The concept of personalized skincare is often achieved through layering or stacking treatments.\n\nA study published in the Journal of Lasers in Medical Science concluded that combination laser therapies outperformed monotherapies in clinical improvement, reduced adverse events such as pain and erythema, and elevated patient satisfaction.10\n\nAnother study in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology found that a combination of fractional ablative and non-ablative laser resurfacing treatments improves wrinkles and pigment, similar to purely ablative approaches. Reduced side effects make the combined procedure an attractive option for facial rejuvenation.11\n\nSciton’s combination therapy brand: ScitonStaX™\n\nSciton’s exclusive combination therapy brand, SctionStaX, meets the demand for personalized skincare through synergistic treatments. StaX combines two or more modalities on a Sciton platform to address multiple skin concerns and deliver stunning outcomes in a single session.\n\nCombining treatments with StaX gives patients the best results for the most reasonable price in the amount of downtime they can handle, says Dr. Rebecca Gelber, MD, owner of Tahoe Aesthetic Medicine in Incline Village, NV. This saves both you and the patient time and allows you to streamline your schedule.\n\nSciton is the only system that can be customized with multiple high-quality modules on one platform, says Dr. Gelber. Having several award-winning stackable treatments on one platform gives you a major competitive advantage over non-Sciton users, she adds.12\n\nDiscover trending StaX combinations in this blog post.\n\nLaser hair removal: A lasting trend\n\nLaser hair removal remains one of the most popular and consistently growing categories in the aesthetic market, ranking among the top three requested aesthetic procedures over the last decade.15 16\n\nLaser hair removal can generate more prospective patients for your practice, potentially opening the door to a new patient base that includes the fastest-growing millennial and prejuvenation demographic, as well as men.17 Considered a “gateway treatment,” it often leads first-time patients to explore additional aesthetic procedures.\n\nBARE HR™\n\nSciton’s BARE HR laser hair removal platform is known for its long-term durability, high peak power, and lightening fast speeds.\n\nBenefits of BARE HR\n\nUnrivaled speed and effectiveness: BARE HR is renowned for its rapid treatment of large areas, proven 3x faster and more effective than common competitor devices. With 4800 watts of power and extra-large spot sizes, it can treat large body parts in just minutes.\n\nPatient comfort: BARE HR’s built-in system cooling at 5 degrees C enhances patient comfort and minimizes post-treatment downtime and side effects.\n\nCustomizable platform: The BARE HR platform can be configured to meet the unique needs of every patient year-round. It offers two handpieces—one delivering the traditional 810 nm wavelength and another ‘blend’ handpiece simultaneously delivering 810, 940, and 1060 nm wavelengths. This versatility makes BARE HR ideal for a wide range of skin tones, including darker or tanned skin (Fitzpatrick skin types 4-6), even during summer.\n\nA new virtual reality in aesthetics\n\nAccording to the Allergan Aesthetics Global Trends Report, the idea of a ‘metaverse,’ has captured worldwide attention. With a 500% spike in Google searches, billion-dollar investments from global tech and gaming giants like Microsoft and Epic Games, and a re-branding of Facebook into Meta, the metaverse is poised to be the next iteration of the Internet, says Mark Zuckerberg. The metaverse is set to profoundly impact the world, including the aesthetics industry.18\n\nDescribed as a network of continuous, three-dimensional virtual spaces where physical and digital worlds merge, the metaverse offers a platform for users to interact and explore. Virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are allowing for new forms of self-expression and interaction. For example, the idea of ‘meta-clinics’ is gaining traction, enabling potential clients to explore treatments in a virtual setting before committing in person. Some practices have even adopted cryptocurrency payments, potentially enhancing engagement and convenience.18\n\nProfessionals in the field are discovering numerous benefits of remote engagement and education through virtual conferences and meetups, which facilitate networking, learning, and collaboration regardless of physical location. VR and AR allow professionals to attend live demonstrations from anywhere in the world, providing a close-up view of cutting-edge techniques and treatments. 18\n\nThis fusion of real and virtual reality is redefining the beauty and aesthetics world in 2024 and beyond.\n\nShaping the future for a better tomorrow\n\nThe aesthetic industry is rapidly evolving, fueled by the pervasive influence of social media and broader technological advancements. Sciton’s cutting-edge technology meets today’s demands for innovative, non-invasive, and customizable cosmetic treatments, offering versatile solutions for a diverse range of aesthetic needs.\n\nBy continuously pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, Sciton sets a new standard for excellence and innovation in the aesthetic landscape.\n\nReferences\n\n12022 Aesthetic Plastic Surgery National Databank Statistics\n\n22022 American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) Procedural Statistics Release report\n\n3New Beauty: Moxi Laser 101: Everything to Know About the Skin-Perfecting Laser\n\n4Here to stay: An attractive future for medical aesthetics | February 1, 2024 | McKinsey & Company Article\n\n5The New Yorker: Age of Instagram Face, How social media, FaceTune, and plastic surgery created a single, cyborgian look\n\n6Webinar: Smart Business Tips for Purchasing & Positioning Energy-based Technology\n\n7Data from Sciton iQ™, a proprietary, real-time treatment analytics system, is for illustrative purposes only and is not a guarantee.
