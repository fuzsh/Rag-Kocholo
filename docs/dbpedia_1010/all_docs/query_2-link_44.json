        "text": "The accolade comes after an undefeated month for Flyers, which saw them beat London Lions, Caledonia Gladiators, Cheshire Phoenix, and Manchester Giants.\n\nThe wins have led Bristol to the top of the BBL Championship and through to the Cup Semi-Finals.\n\nOn receiving the award, coach Kapoulas said: “I’m honoured, but really this is a team award and full credit goes to our players and our staff for putting us in this position.\n\n“Our focus is to keep on getting better every week, we’ve been talking about that throughout the season. We’re very appreciative of the recognition, however we want to keep going and we want to take our form into December, starting from the Sheffield game on Saturday.”\n\nDespite a 100 percent win rate in November, Coach Kapoulas feels there’s plenty more to come from the Flyers this season: “I thinks it’s important to keep on doing the things that have got us to this point. We’re still not the finished product, we have areas to improve on and we’re fully aware of that as a team and are working on that on a daily basis.\n\n“We take confidence from the results we’ve had and the performances that we’ve had so far, but at the same time we want to keep on looking forward. We want to be a team that is playing for things in April and May. We don’t want to be looking back in any way, we want to be looking forward and improving as a group.”\n\nKapoulas highlighted the teams’ attitude as a key for recent success: “Overall, it’s a team approach for us, we have a lot of guys that will step up in different moments. I think that’s one of our real strengths. We’ve had to battle through injuries and guys have had to step up on occasions. I can see very often we have four or five guys in double digits, and different guys have those big games when we need them.”"
