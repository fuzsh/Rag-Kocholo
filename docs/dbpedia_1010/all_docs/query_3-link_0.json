        "text": "Luck and success sometimes come and go like the scoring ability of a Thomas Mueller that has been successful at the World Cup the last two years or the misfortune for a Wayne Rooney in 2010 and 2014 and that happens just the same in the game of basketball where teams go on winning and losing streaks. It isn´t known if every member of the Miami Heat Summer League team sat through the incredible World Cup win of Germany last Sunday, but if they did, the players were unable to transport some of the German winning vibe on to the court for themselves as the club hasn´t been able to get a victory in two tries since Germany won their fourth World Cup game. Miami lost to the Clippers on Monday and a nail bitter against the Washington Wizards on Tuesday. Barthel had the chance to get some revenge against his teammate from the Fraport Skyliners Aziz Ndiaje who plays for the Los Angeles Clippers. However the Senegal big man didn´t get inserted again this time after getting a DNP on Monday. He did play the night after in a 83-60 losing cause against the Houston Rockets. In that game N Diaye played 8,53 minutes scoring two points, hauling down three rebounds, blocking one shot and getting a turnover. His problem continues to be fouls where he had four and his inaccuracy at the free throw line(2/4). With the 2014 NBA Summer League slowly coming to an end , it was the perfect chance for the players on both squads to get in some more good plays and woo the coaches and men in high places. However NDiaye sat on the bench again and had to wonder if he would ever face Barthel again in a game or a practice down the road.\n\nTournament time had arrived in the NBA Summer League at Las Vegas with a do or die game between the two teams. Earlier in the day it has been reported by media outlets that James Ennis had been signed to a contract by Miami. Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra was in the stands looking relaxed checking out the action and possibly looking to add some more talent to his NBA roster as was Sam Cassell. The Miami Heat were without 2014 number one draft pick Shabazz Napier who was allowed to have the day off as he was off at the ESPY awards, but the club did get a top team contributer back with Justin Hamilton who had been out a few days. Danilo Barthel didn´t start the game, but witnessed from the bench as Hamilton got off to a quick start as did Tyler Johnson who was inserted into the starting lineup as the mini human highlight film is usually good for one or two memorable actions that are packed into a ESPN moment just as Rajon Rondo does with one or two major fancy passes per game. Barthel came into the game at the 4.00 minute mark of the first quarter and got going right away scoring on a shuffle move and soon after hitting a catch and pop shot as it seems like his rainbow shot is getting brighter and brighter as the tournament progresses. On defense, he didn´t always have an easy time against Keith Benson. Clipper Cameroun Clark hit a buzzer beater at the end of the first quarter as they had the 21-20 advantage. In the second quarter, Barthel was in from the start, but played only until the 8.34 minute mark. Barthel wasn´t a factor on offense, but played solid defense. Miami went on a 10-0 run early, but the Clippers came back with big shots from Suggs and Nunnally. At the break the game was dead locked at 41-41.\n\nIn the third quarter, Barthel was on the bench as he watched the pace of the game improve and get quicker. There had been 10 lead changes in the game and five ties, but overall in the third quarter, the Miami Heat were able to heighten their offense a bit more as it was even more fluid. Miami really did a great job getting everyone involved and Shabazz Napier fill in Larry Drew was doing a superb job running the point and was clicking nicely with Justin Hamilton who he played with before in the D-League. In the last minute of the third quarter, the Los Angeles Clippers got some key buckets from Benson and Clark and trailed Miami only 69-65. In the fourth quarter, Danilo Barthel kept his red Miami Heat practice top on and at that point it seemed like his day was over on the court and he could sit back and await the Tyler Johnson “What highlight play do you want next” to finally commence. The Miami Heat continued to get unselfish play from Frank Gaines who chipped in with big baskets off the bench and the Miami Heat kept the lead and would never relinquish it. Towards the end of the game, it wasn´t one massive high light play that had fans with major topic material to converse about on the ride home, but three massive plays that keeps one wondering if it is early enough for the rookie to get a NBA training camp invite. The first highlight was when Drew found Johnson cutting to the hoop and finding him for the dunk as he floated to the hoop without problem. The second play, he wasn´t far from center court and he somehow riffled a bullet pass to Suggs for the easy hoop and the third play he found Hamilton back door for the easy connection. In the end, the Miami Heat advanced with a 96-87 win and next play Washington on Thursday. Miami was led by Justin Hamilton with 18 points. Tyler Honeycutt had a huge game with 11 points and 15 boards and Larry Drew had 10 points and 10 rebounds. The Clippers were led by Keith Benson with 18 points and Deandre Liggins with 14 points. The final stat line for Danilo Barthel was five points, one rebound, one block and one turnover on 2/3 shooting in 5.26 minutes."
