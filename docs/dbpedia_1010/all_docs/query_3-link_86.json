        "text": "- Thursday -\n\nThu 1 A: Potential clinical candidates for purine receptors\n\nNew regenerative medicine via P2Y and P2Y-like receptors: the case of GPR17, a new target for remyelination\n\nMaria P. Abbracchio\n\nLaboratory of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology of Purinergic Transmission, Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Milan, Via Balzaretti 9, 20133 Milan, Italy\n\nP2Y receptors (P2YRs) have established roles in the cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory and immune systems [1]. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that the coordinated action of multiple P2YRs crucially orchestrates both acute remodelling events after tissue injury and the subsequent repair and regeneration. Some P2YRs indeed act as sensors of phagocytosis and participate to clearance of dying cells and debris after damage (e.g., P2Y6 [2]), or to the uptake and degradation of toxic endogenous substances, as shown for microglial P2Y2 toward the amyloidogenic Aβ1-42 peptide [3]. Moreover, several other P2YRs (e.g., P2Y1, P2Y12 and the P2Y-like receptor GPR17) have been implicated in the proliferation, differentiation and migration of adult multipotent stem/progenitor cells [4–6]. Globally, these findings open up new perspectives in the exploitment of P2YRs for new regenerative therapies. In this respect, GPR17 has recently emerged as a new target for demyelinating disorders. GPR17 is closely related to P2Y and CysLT receptors [7,8] and can be activated by both uracil nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotrienes, as well as by new synthetic ligands [9,10]. Under physiological conditions, GPR17 is transiently expressed by oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in transition to pre-immature oligodendrocytes and markedly downregulated in mature myelinating cells [11,12]. In vivo, increased levels of GPR17 at the site of brain injury, indicate a role in post-damage events [13,14]. Targeted inhibition of GPR17 markedly affected OPC differentiation in vitro, suggesting a potential role in myelin repair [11] (see also Abbracchio et al., poster at this meeting). In silico modeling and virtual screening, followed by functional and pharmacological in vitro confirmation have identified additional GPR17 ligands [9] that may represent prototypic molecules for new regenerative medicine therapies. Based on these and other findings [15], in 2012, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society USA has officially proposed GPR17 as a “model receptor” for new re-myelinating therapies in multiple sclerosis.

It was known at the onset of the program that an appropriately 2-substituted adenosine analog [1] could impart selectivity for A2A AdoR selectivity over A1 AdoR, so we designed series exemplified by acetylene 1, and N-pyrazole 2 (regadenoson). Critical to the success of our program was the choice of measuring the vasodilatation induced by our A2A AdoR agonist in an isolated heart model (rat) attempting to match the duration of effect of adenosine [2]. The acetylene 1 had too long of a vasodilatory effect (23 min) that was attributed to the high affinity for the A2A AdoR. Regadenoson 2 had a modest duration of effect (11 min) more closely matching the duration of effect of adenosine (8 min), and a modest A2A AdoR affinity (1.2 uM h A2A AdoR). Regadenoson is 10 fold selective over A1 AdoR binding affinity, but more than 100 fold functionally selective for coronary vasodilation over A1 AdoR mediated negative dromotropic effects, and highly selective over peripheral vasodilatory effects (hypotension). The latter tissue selectivity may be due to the partial A2A AdoR agonism (cAMP), and the high receptor reserve of the coronary arterial circulation, hence requiring only a smaller percentage of A2A AdoR occupancy to cause near-maximal vasodilatation. The hypothesis that a short acting functionally selective A2A AdoR agonist would have fewer side effects was answered in the clinic with a decrease in the % and the severity of the side effects observed with regadenoson, fewer cases of first degree A-V block (3 versus 7 % for Ado) and second degree A-V block (0.1 vs 1 % for Ado) [3].\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Albrecht-Küpper\n\nBayer Healtcare AG, Global Drug Discovery, D-42096 Wuppertal; Cardiology Research, Department of Heart Diseases\n\nThere are several options for new cardiovascular therapies involving adenosine A1 receptor activation in e.g. angina pectoris, control of cardiac rhythm, ischemic injury during acute coronary syndrome or heart failure. The main issue of using A1 receptor agonists in therapies is the broad spectrum of physiological A1 effects. Desired cardiovascular effects such as cardioprotection can be counter-regulated by undesired ones like pronounced bradycardia (AV-block) or decreased glomerular filtration rate and diuresis. This restriction for the use of A1 receptor agonists as therapeutic target can be overcome by tailoring compounds only to the desired pharmacological efficacy by the development of partial adenosine A1 receptor agonists.\n\nThere are now several partial A1 agonists described in the literature like GS-9667 and VCP-103 with different degrees of partiality and resulting pharmacological activity. Bayer has identified the first non-adenosine like partial A1 agonists like Capadenoson which are suitable for an oral once daily treatment of patients. Capadenoson has an EC50 of 0.1 nM on human A1 receptors and a selectivity factor of 1,800 vs. A2a, 900 vs. A2b and no activity on A3 receptors [1]. It shows an efficacy of only 75 % in comparison to the full adenosine A1 receptor agonist CPA on A1 receptors prepared from human cortex membranes. In consistency with the predicted pharmacological effects of a partial A1 receptor agonist, Capadenoson showed reduced bradycardic effects and no AV block. In preclinical models of acute myocardial infarction and heart failure the partial A1 agonist reduced infarct size and significantly improved heart function [1,2].\n\nIn clinical studies the compound did not reduce heart rate at rest in healthy subjects or patients with stable angina pectoris, but reduced heart rate at peak exercise compared with placebo [3]. A single dose of Capadenoson resulted in a significant increase of exercise time. Clinical studies with a follow-up compound are currently ongoing in patients with heart failure.\n\nFuture studies will show which benefits partial adenosine A1 receptor agonists will have in cardiovascular and other diseases.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Ford\n\nAfferent Pharmaceuticals, San Mateo, CA, USA\n\nPatients with somatosensory & visceral disorders experience chronic pain, discomfort & irritative symptoms driven by hypersensitized primary afferent neurons. Despite decades of innovation, therapeutic options remain limited, and research attention has turned to targeting excitatory channels localised preferentially to primary afferents (e.g., TRP, NaV, P2X), to suppress peripheral inputs driving sensitization. One such approach is blocking P2X3 channels (P2X3 homotrimers), expressed selectively by large proportions of neural crest derived C-fibers, deletion of which in mice led to findings consistent with attenuated sensitization [1], including urinary bladder hyporeflexia, and reduced hyperalgesia [2].\n\nDevelopable “drug-like” inhibitors of P2X3 channels have been widely sought, and the first such molecule, AF-219, has successfully progressed to clinic: completed studies include four Ph 1 studies, & four Ph 2 studies in patients with a range of common clinical conditions. AF-219 is a novel (MWt. ~ 350) 2,4-diaminopyrimidine which allosterically blocks human P2X3 homotrimeric channels (IC50 ~ 30 nM) with selectivity over P2X2/3 heterotrimers & no effect on other channels studied.\n\nClinical experience with AF-219 reveals a favorable safety profile to date from inhibition of P2X3 & P2X2/3 receptors, with one tolerability finding of altered taste perception [anticipated given reduced taste sensibility of P2X2-, P2X3- & double-KO mice [3]] reflecting high dose inhibition of heteromeric P2X2/3 channels that dominate transduction in the placodal gustatory afferents. In the first completed patient study, a high POC dose of AF-219 given over a 2 week period, was shown to dramatically reduce cough frequency & severity in refractory patients [4]. Clinical potential and additional findings will be presented.\n\nFig. 1 AF-219 (600 mg BID) reduces daytime cough frequency 84 % (p < 0.001 vs. PLA) in patients with treatment refractory cough\n\nReferences\n\n1.

In the brain, adenosine and its receptors are presents in high levels, and it has been shown to be involved in both normal and pathological processes including arousal, motor control, neuroprotection, mood, learning and memory. Its effects are transmitted by four distinct receptor subtypes designated A1, A2a, A2b, and A3 belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Adenosine A1 and A3 receptors are coupled to inhibitory G proteins, while A2a and A2b receptors are coupled to stimulatory G proteins. A2a receptors (A2aR) show a restricted distribution, being characteristic of the dopamine enriched areas, the highest concentration being in the caudate-putamen. This anatomical selection suggests a unique role in neuronal signaling with this region and potential involvement in neurologic disease of extrapyramidal origin.\n\nIn fact, A2a antagonism appeared to be a promising pharmacological target in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Furthermore, an increasing number of studies suggest that pharmacological or genetic blockade of A2aR might be of great interest in Alzheimer’s disease as it reduces β-amyloid deposits, τ-phosphorylation and neurodegeneration. Currently, only three compounds are still being tested in clinical phase for PD treatment. Even if they show good affinities for the receptor, there is still a need for improving their ADME properties by keeping their selectivity towards other adenosine receptors.\n\nBased on the published crystalline structure of the A2A receptor complexed with the selective and high-affinity antagonist ZM241385 [1] and on a pharmacophoric model [2], we have designed new ligands using in silico docking studies starting from a preliminary hit that we recently identified in our group. Then, using original chemical pathways, three new families of compounds have been synthesized and tested for their affinity towards A2a receptor.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

We are particularly interested in adenosine-regulated glutamate signaling in the striatum and cortico-striatal circuit in addictive ethanol seeking behaviors. In the nucleus accumbens (NAc), we found that ENT1 expression regulates EAAT2 (excitatory amino acid transporter type 2; Slc1a2), an astrocyte-specific glutamate transporter, which is known to be responsible for over 90 % of glutamate uptake in the striatum. Reduced EAAT2 expression in ENT1 null mice dampens glutamate uptake activity, and thereby increases synaptic glutamate levels, which constitutively activate NMDA glutamate receptors (NMDAR) in the NAc. Ceftriaxone, an antibiotic compound known to increase EAAT2 expression and function, reduced ethanol drinking in ENT1 null mice. Recently, we discovered that ceftriaxone treatment reduced ethanol withdrawal symptoms (AWS) in alcohol preferring P rats and Wistar rats. In the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), ENT1 deficiency dampens adenosine A2AR function, which promotes the transition from goal-directed to habitual behaviors. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of DMS A2AR increases goal-directed behavior and increases both sucrose and ethanol seeking in operant self-administration experiments. Decreased A2AR signaling appears to causally decrease PKA activity in the DMS, which is consistent with the fact that inhibition of A2AR is coupled to decreased adenylyl cyclase activity and PKA activity. Moreover, ENT1 null mice showed a higher rate of initial acquisition and increased vulnerability toward habitual behavior in operant instrumental conditioning tests. Thus, hypo-A2AR function in the DMS of ENT1 null mice may lead to increased goal-oriented behavior. Using circadian locomotor activity, we found that ENT1 null mice were hyperactive compared to wild-type mice at night. Moreover, adenosine signaling regulates cellular and behavioral circadian timing and influences alcohol intake during chronodisruption. In summary, ENT1-regulated adenosine signaling plays an essential role in ethanol-seeking behaviors.\n\nSupports: NIH, Samuel C.

Ross\n\nDepartment of Chemistry and Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA\n\nAdenosine is a neuromodulator in the brain that regulates cerebral blood flow and neurotransmission. Our lab has developed a rapid electrochemical sensing method that allows us to measure adenosine release on the subsecond time scale. We have discovered spontaneous, transient adenosine release in the prefrontal cortex and caudate-putamen that lasts for only 3 s [1]. The mechanism and function of this transient adenosine release is not known. Thus, we have performed a series of studies to understand the regulation of these adenosine transients. Pharmacological tests indicate that spontaneous adenosine release is self-regulated by A1 but not A2a receptors. Both metabolism and nucleoside transporters are responsible for clearing adenosine from the extracellular space. In brain slices, we have observed the mechanism of formation and function of transient adenosine release. Adenosine is transiently released due to mechanical stimulation, which is not due to cell death [2]. This mechanosensitive release is dependent on ATP breakdown and is calcium and tetrodotoxin dependent. The rapid adenosine can transiently modulate phasic dopamine release in brain slices. Adenosine transiently released 2–5 s before dopamine stimulation inhibits dopamine release via A1 receptors, but adenosine released over 10 s before stimulation has no effect. Thus, our research has shown that there is a rapid mode of adenosine signalling that lasts only a few seconds in the brain. This signalling may be important for transient modulation of dopamine neurotransmission.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Nguyen MD, Lee ST, Ross AE, Ryals M, Choudhry VI, Venton BJ (2014) PLoS One 9:e87165\n\n2.

Coe\n\nDepartment of Chemistry and Biology, Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, M5B 2K3, Canada\n\nEquilibrative Nucleoside Transporters (ENTs) comprise the SLC29 family of integral membrane proteins which are responsible for the uni- or bi-directional flux of the purine nucleoside adenosine, and other nucleosides and nucleobases, across cell membranes. Compared to other members of the purinome such as purinergic receptors and enzymes, very little is known about the role of ENTs in purinergic physiology, signaling and metabolism. In addition, the role of ENTs in determining impact and efficacy of nucleoside analog drugs is still not clearly defined. Using a variety of biochemical, physiological and pharmacological approaches, we have investigated the structure, function and regulation of ENTs. We have determined that the prototypic equilibrative nucleoside transporter, ENT1, plays an integral role in modulating the effects of adenosine in a number of physiological settings. The absence of ENT1, in knockout mouse models, leads to enhanced adenosinergic responses in the cardiovasculature and the renal system [1,2]. To better understand the role of ENT1 within the purinome and the contribution of ENT1 to the regulation of purinergic activities, we have investigated and described the post-translational modifications of ENT1 undergoes and are gradually elucidating the regulatory roles of these modifications. We have also investigated the regulatory roles of a variety of interacting proteins that appear to be involved in modulating ENT1 function. In addition, it is increasingly clear that there are multiple levels of regulation of ENT1, from gene to protein, which affect the function of this transporter [3]. Taken together, our data suggest that ENT1 is an integral member of the purinome and activity of the transporter is regulated to optimize and coordinate purinergic signaling in complex and unexpected ways.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Wall\n\nSchool of Life Sciences, University of Warwick, UK\n\nThe purine adenosine is a potent neuromodulator involved in many physiological and pathological CNS processes. Although much is known about its cellular actions less is known about the mechanisms of release and the spatial/temporal properties of adenosine signalling. There is accumulating evidence that only small numbers of actions potentials, fired at a low frequency, are sufficient to release adenosine and thus adenosine release occurs during physiological activity. The mechanism of release differs in different brain regions with release occurring from neurones and glia either directly or indirectly, as ATP. Using electrophysiology, biosensors and simulations we have begun to characterise the properties of adenosine signalling during neocortical network activity.\n\nIn the neocortex, although the frequency of population spikes is modulated by blocking A1 receptors, adenosine release cannot be directly measured with adenosine biosensors. From simulations and experimental data we have determined that released adenosine is rapidly diluted and is therefore only detectable very close to release sites. This is consistent with data from paired recordings, were the degree of A1 receptor activation differs between proximal synapses within a slice. During pathological activity, when adenosine release occurs from many release sites inosine is detected rather than adenosine. This is consistent with the local uptake of adenosine, deamination by adenosine deaminase, and efflux out of the cells.\n\nFunctions and regulation of erythrocyte equlibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) in acute hypoxia mediated tissue injury\n\nAnren Song1, Yujin Zhang1, Jessica Lee1, Almut Grenz2, Michael R. Blackburn1, Holger Eltzschig2, Rodney E. Kellems1 and Yang Xia1\n\n1University of Texas-Medical School, Houston, TX, USA;2University of Colorado-Medical School, Denver, USA\n\nEqulibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) on erythrocytes have been long speculated to regulate extracellular adenosine concentrations under hypoxic conditions. Thus, we hypothesize that erythrocyte ENT is likely a key molecule responsible for elevated circulating adenosine levels and protects tissues from hypoxia induced injury. To test this hypothesis, we first conducted western blot analysis to compare expression profiles of ENTs on erythrocyte. We found that ENT1 is the major ENT expressed on both mouse and human erythrocytes. Using genetic approach combined with functional adenosine uptake assay, we demonstrated that ENT1 1) is the major adenosine transporter in erythrocyte and 2) red blood cell (RBC) is the major cell type involved in regulating circulating adenosine levels. Next, we performed pharmacological studies to determine the exact role of ENT1 in erythrocyte. We found that treatment with dipyridamole or an ENT1 specific inhibitor (NBMPR) enhanced adenosine-induced elevation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), an erythrocyte specific metabolite known to decrease hemoglobin O2 binding affinity, in cultured mouse RBCs. Using Hemox Analyzer, we found that co-treatment of adenosine with either dipyridamole or NBMPR resulted in a further right shift of oxygen equilibrium curve (OEC) and further increase in P50 compared to the cells treated with adenosine alone. Similar to our pharmacological studies, we found that genetic deletion of ENT1 further enhanced adenosine-induced 2,3-BPG production in cultured erythrocytes, additional right shift of OEC and increased P50. Finally, we found that, during acute hypoxia treatment, genetic ablation of erythrocyte ENT1 significantly reduced the speed of adenosine uptake and promoted 2,3-BPG production, triggered more oxygen release, and protected acute hypoxia-mediated tissue injury. Overall, our studies demonstrate that 1) ENT1 is a major adenosine transporter expressed by RBCs and RBCs are the major cell type responsible for regulating circulating adenosine. 2) Inhibition or deletion of erythrocyte ENT1 results in enhanced adenosine-mediated 2,3-BPG induction and hemoglobin deoxygenation in RBCs when hypoxia is encountered. Therefore, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of erythrocyte ENT1 in hypoxia-mediated tissue damage by regulating extracellular adenosine and provide new therapeutic possibility to prevent hypoxia-induced tissue damage.\n\nThu 1 C: ATP-mediated talk between microglia, astrocytes and neurons\n\nRole for ATP receptors in astrocyte-neuron communications in neocortex\n\nYuriy Pankratov, Seyed Rasooli-Nejad and Ulyana Lalo\n\nSchool of Life Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK\n\nCommunication between neuronal and glial cells is very important for brain function. Astrocytes enwrap neurons and therefore can be exposed to various neurotransmitters. In response, astrocytes can modulate synaptic signaling via vesicular release of gliotransmitters, such as D-serine, glutamate and ATP. Our recent work highlighted an important role played by ATP in bi-directional glia-neuron communications in the brain.\n\nFirstly, we have shown that cortical astrocytes express ionotropic receptors to ATP, composed of P2X1 and P2X5 subunits. Astroglial P2X1/5 receptors mediate fast electrical and Ca2+ -signals triggered by stimulation of neuronal afferents.\n\nSecondly, we have demonstrated that vesicular release of ATP from cortical astrocytes can be activated via various pathways including Ca2+-permeable ionotropic receptors or UV-uncaging of Ca2+. We have not observed release of ATP from astrocytes of dnSNARE mice in which SNARE proteins were selectively impaired in astroglial cells. We found out that glia-derived ATP down-regulated both synaptic and tonic inhibitory currents in the neocortical neurons; this effect was mediated by phosphorylation of GABAA receptors. Furthermore, modulation of neuronal inhibition by astrocyte-driven ATP affected the synaptic plasticity in the neocortex.\n\nThese findings demonstrate an importance of SNARE complex-dependent exocytosis of ATP for glia-neuron interaction in the neocortex. Our results also show a novel pathway of glia-neuron communication involving release of ATP and modulation of postsynaptic GABA receptors. Importantly, ATP-mediated communication between astrocytes and neurons in the neocortex can undergo remodeling during brain ageing and decrease in the ATP release from astrocytes may contribute to the age-related impairment of synaptic plasticity.\n\nATP-mediated communication between astrocytes and neurons at lowPO2\n\nAlexander V. Gourine1 and Sergey Kasparov2\n\n1University College London, London, UK;2University of Bristol, Bristol, UK\n\nAstrocytes are the most abundant type of brain glial cells. They are closely associated with cerebral blood vessels—all penetrating and intracerebral arterioles and capillaries are enwrapped by astrocytic endfeet. By having contacts with cerebral vasculature as well as multiple neurons, astrocytes are in a position to ‘taste’ the chemical composition of the arterial blood entering the brain and integrate this information with that of brain parenchyma. Does it reflect their functional importance for the operation of brain interoceptors, which monitor key homeostatic parameters including pH, PCO2 and possibly PO2 levels? We found that astrocytes which reside within the brainstem chemoreceptor areas located near the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata are highly chemosensitive. They respond to small physiological decreases in pH or PO2 with vigorous elevations in intracellular Ca2+ and release of ATP. ATP spreads astroglial Ca2+ excitation within the neuropil, activates key respiratory neurons of the medullary rhythm-generating circuits and induces adaptive increases in breathing. During systemic hypoxia ATP is also released and acts to maintain respiratory activity in conditions when hypoxia-induced depression of respiration occurs. Mimicking astroglial pH-evoked Ca2+ responses by selective light stimulation of astrocytes expressing channelrhodopsin-2 activates chemoreceptor neurons via ATP-dependent mechanism and triggers robust respiratory and sympathetic responses in vivo. Thus, medullary astrocytes appear to be highly sensitive to physiological chemosensory challenges and have the ability to impart chemosensory information onto a modified pattern of cardiorespiratory activity via release of ATP.\n\nIschemic tolerance mediated by glia purinergic system\n\nSchuichi Koizumi* and Yuri Hirayama\n\nUniversity of Yamanashi, Department of Neuropharmacology, Yamanashi, Japan\n\nThe use of a preceding sub-lethal ischemic insult, preconditioning, is an attractive strategy for protecting neurons by inducing ischemic tolerance in the brain. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms have been studied extensively, almost all experiments have been performed on neurons. Here, we show that activation of glial cells by sub-lethal brain ischemia is essential for induction of ischemic tolerance using a middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model. The lethal middle cerebral artery occlusion-evoked damage was significantly reduced when mice received preconditioning 3 or 6 days earlier, i.e., induction of ischemic tolerance, whereas preconditioning 1 day prior had no effect on brain damage. Interestingly, the region where ischemic tolerance occurred correlated well with where astrocytes were activated. Fluorocitrate, a metabolic inhibitor of astrocytes, inhibited the preconditioning-induced activation of astrocytes, which was associated with the disappearance of ischemic tolerance, suggesting an indispensable role of activated astrocytes to the ischemic tolerance. Minocycline, an inhibitor of microglial activation, had no such effect. As for the mechanisms, we found that upregulation of P2X7 receptors by preconditioning was responsible for astrocyte-mediated ischemic tolerance. Using P2rx7-EGFP mice, we analyzed preconditioning-induced changes on the spatiotemporal pattern of P2X7 receptor expression. P2X7 receptors were expressed mainly in microglia in naive mice. However, upon receiving preconditioning, they were dramatically upregulated in activated astrocytes rather than in microglia. The preconditioning-induced ischemic tolerance was abolished in P2X7 receptor knockout (P2X7−/−) mice, although there was no significant difference in the activation of astrocytes between wild-type and P2X7−/− mice. Moreover, hypoxia inducible factor-1α and its target gene erythropoietin, well-known mediators of oxygen homeostasis in neurons, were upregulated in astrocytes following preconditioning in wild-type mice, but expression was suppressed in P2X7−/− mice. However, neuronal hypoxia inducible factor-1α was not affected by P2X7 deficiency. Taken together, upregulation of P2X7 receptors in preconditioning-activated astrocytes should be essential for glia-mediated ischemic tolerance.\n\nRegulation of gliotransmission by microglial cells\n\nCamille Philippot, Naura Chounlamountri and Olivier Pascual\n\nCentre de Recherche en Neuroscience de Lyon (CRNL), Lyon, France\n\nPurines are involved in cellular communication throughout the central nervous system (CNS). In particular ATP, that is an important extracellular messenger involved in the communication between astrocytes, a subtype of glial cells. Astrocytes stimulation by ATP has been found to modulate the probability of glutamate release by hippocampal neurons through a pre synaptic regulation involving the the release of glutamate by astrocytes. This ATP mediated signaling pathway is part of the gliotransmission a term that refers to the capacity of glial cells to release gliotransmitter (ATP, Glutamate, D-serine…) to modulate synaptic activity. We recently demonstrated that microglia release ATP to modulate synaptic transmission using astrocytes as intermediate. We now report that microglia regulates the astrocytic process of gliotransmission. Indeed we found that gliotransmission triggered by P2Y1 agonist is impaired in slices from transgenic mice devoid of microglia. To better understand the mechanisms involved in this process, we further studied the cellular mechanisms of gliotransmitter release. We found that the lack of microglia alter neither P2Y1 receptor expression nor intracellular calcium responses following ATP stimulation. However using TIRF imaging we found that the vesicular release of gliotransmitter was slightly different in cultures lacking microglia compared to vesicular release in mixed cultures. Indeed vesicular release kinetics appears to be faster in pure astrocyte cultures when compared to mixed cultures with more vesicles close to the membrane. The results we obtained suggest an altered anchoring of ATP containing vesicles to the membrane in absence of microglia potentially leading to a defective gliotransmission.\n\nRole of adenosine A2Areceptors in cerebral ischemia\n\nFelicita Pedata1,*, Alessia Melani1,2, Lucrezia Cellai1, Ilaria Dettori1 and Anna Maria Pugliese1\n\n1Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health (NEUROFARBA), University of Florence, Viale Pieraccini, 6, 50139 Florence, Italy;2Fellow of the Fondazione Umberto Veronesi, Milan, Italy\n\nThe extracellular concentration of adenosine in the brain increases dramatically during ischemia due to degradation of extracellularly released ATP in the first minutes after stroke and to adenosine released per se from cells [1]. Adenosine A2A receptor is expressed in neurons and glial cells and in peripheral inflammatory cells (lymphocytes and granulocytes). Adenosine A2A receptor emerged as a potential therapeutic attractive target in ischemia. Ischemia is a multifactorial pathology characterized by different events evolving in the time. After ischemia the early massive increase of extracellular glutamate is followed by activation of resident immune cells, i.e. microglia, and production or activation of inflammation mediators. Proinflammatory cytokines, that upregulate cell adhesion molecules, exert an important role in promoting recruitment of leukocytes that promote expansion of the inflammatory response in ischemic tissue. Protracted neuroinflammation is recognized as the predominant mechanism of secondary brain injury progression. Adenosine A2A receptors present on central cells and on blood peripheral cells account for important effects depending on the time-related evolution of the pathological condition. Evidence indicate that A2A antagonists provide early protection via centrally-mediated control of excessive excitotoxicity [2], while A2A agonists provide protection by controlling massive blood cell infiltration in the hours and days after ischemia [3].\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Haanes1,2,* and Ivana Novak1\n\n1Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark;2Clinical Experimental Research, Copenhagen University Hospital, Glostrup, Denmark\n\nATP is released from pancreatic acini in response to cholinergic and hormonal stimulation. The same stimuli cause exocytosis of ZG (zymogen granules) and release of digestive enzymes. Our aim was to establish the role of the vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT), SLC17A9, in storage and release of ATP. We determined that ZG stored ATP and our findings indicated that VNUT may be responsible for the ATP uptake into ZG [1]. We further used freshly prepared acini from mice and AR42J rat acinar cells. We illustrate that in AR42J cells, quinacrine (an ATP store marker) and Bodipy ATP (a fluorescent ATP analogue) co-localized with VNUT-mCherry to vesicles/granules. Furthermore, in acini and AR42J cells, a marker of the zymogen granule membranes, Rab3D, and VNUT co-localized. Dexamethasone treatment of AR42J cells promoted formation of acinar structures, paralleled by increased amylase and VNUT expression, and increased ATP release in response to cholinergic stimulation [2]. In conclusion ATP is stored together with digestive enzymes in ZG, where it is taken up by VNUT. VNUT-dependent ATP release pathway is associated with agonist-induced secretion process. We propose that co-released ATP would regulate P2 receptors in pancreatic ducts and, thus, ductal secretion, and this would aid delivery of enzymes to the duodenum.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The secretory response to glucose stimulation begins with a first phase of rapid insulin release and is typically followed by a second phase of slower release that is sustained until stimulation ceases. Intracellular ATP elevated in response to glucose is a key mediator of insulin secretion through closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels and consequent depolarization- and calcium induced granule exocytosis. We have now uncovered a new molecular mechanism that regulates insulin secretion by controlling ATP release from pancreatic β cells. Vesicular Nucleotide Transporter (VNUT) is a vesicular membrane protein that mediates ATP uptake into secretory vesicles. We found that VNUT is expressed in pancreatic β cells [1], where VNUT is found in both insulin secretory granules and plasma membrane. In the secretory granules VNUT regulates granule ATP uptake and consequently its release by β cells. In addition to ATP secretion [1], VNUT regulates insulin secretion as suppression of VNUT expression in both mouse and human islets significantly attenuates glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) [1]. Specifically, we found that the first phase of GSIS was significantly decreased in islets from islet-specific VNUT knockout mice. The effect of VNUT on insulin secretion is mediated by extracellular ATP as exogenous ATP treatment recovers impaired insulin secretion induced by abrogating VNUT function. Taken together, VNUT is expressed in pancreatic β cells and plays a critical role in regulating glucose-induced insulin secretion.\n\nReference\n\n1.

In a previous study [1], we found that ADP regulates beta cell apoptosis. Using MIN6c4 cells as a model system, we investigated if autocrine/paracrine mechanisms of ADP and purinergic receptors are involved in this process. High glucose (16.7 mmol/l) and palmitate (100 μmol/l), but not mannitol, rapidly and potently elevated ATP release. Tolbutamide and diazoxide were both without effect, while the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, the Cl− channel/ VRAC inhibitor NPPB, and the pannexin inhibitor carbenoxolone could inhibit both effects. Similarly, silencing the MDR1 gene also blocked nutrient-generated ATP release. These results indicate that calcium channels and VRACs might be involved in the ATP release mechanism. Furthermore, high glucose and palmitate inhibited cAMP production, reduced cell proliferation in MIN6c4 and increased activated Caspase-3 cells in mouse islets and in MIN6c4 cells. The P2Y13-specific antagonist MRS2211 antagonized all these effects. Further studies showed that blocking the P2Y13 receptor resulted in enhanced CREB, Bad and IRS-1 phosphorylation.\n\nPreliminary results, using HFD fed P2Y13 KO mice, indicate a tendency to reduced insulin production in pancreas and a significant protective effect on HFD stimulated enteric neural-loss.\n\nReference\n\n1.

These actions involve the enzyme 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic regulator that is a target for treatment of type 2 diabetes [1]. In MIN6 β-islet cells, treatment with a potent and selective P2Y6R dinucleotide agonist MRS2957 (500 nM) activated AMPK, which was blocked by P2Y6R-selective antagonist MRS2578. Also, MRS2957 induced phosphorylation of acetylcoenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), a marker of AMPK activity. Calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) inhibitor STO-069 and IP3 receptor antagonist 2-APB attenuated P2Y6R-mediated AMPK phosphorylation revealing involvement of intracellular Ca2+ pathways. P2Y6R agonist induced insulin secretion at high glucose, which was reduced by AMPK siRNA. In target cells (C2C12 skeletal muscle cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes), MRS2957 significantly increased glucose uptake compared to control, which was antagonized by MRS2578. MRS2957-treatment resulted in significant phosphorylation of AMPK in both cell lines, which was abolished by pre-incubation with MRS2578. Also, MRS2957 (30 min incubation) increased glucose transporter GLUT4 recruitment to the cell membrane, which was blocked by MRS2578 or AMPK inhibitor (Compound C). Glucose uptake in primary mouse adipocytes from WT but not P2Y6R KO mice was stimulated by P2Y6R activation. Our results indicate that the P2Y6R is involved in controlling glucose metabolism at multiple levels, and this may be mediated through AMPK signaling.\n\nReference\n\n1.

However, very few drugs have actually made a clinical impact yet.\n\nAims of the Round-Table: In this Round-Table discussion, we call on preclinical and clinical investigators as well as pharmaceutical industries and private no-profit research and Patients’ Foundations to: (i) identify major hurdles for the development of pharmacological compounds that target purine signaling, (ii) envisage new effective operational drug development models to best synergize basic/clinical researchers, pharmaceutics and Foundations.\n\nWe anticipate that this Round-Table will stimulate the discussion on some critical issues in this topic:\n\ni) What are the greatest challenge in developing purine ligands for specific clinical applications?\n\nii) What are general lessons we learned from these late stages of clinical trials?\n\niii) How can we dissect out the complexity of purinergic signaling to reduce debilitating side effects?\n\niv) Are there specific/unique factors that should be taken into consideration for clinical trials design for purine-based therapy?\n\nNew operational models in drug discovery and development: the role of patients’ foundation\n\nPaola Zaratin* and Mario Alberto Battaglia\n\nItalian MS Society Foundation, Genoa, Italy\n\nDiscovering and developing new disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative diseases hinges on innovative research and new operational models promoting multidisciplinary and integrated efforts of all stakeholders involved. Traditional Industry or Biotech-based models do no longer always represent the best possible option to keep science moving forward the development of innovative therapies. Given the challenges presented, for the benefit of people with Multiple Sclerosis, the Italian Multiple Sclerosis Society Foundation is committed to play a role in contributing to filling this translational gap, often also referred to as the ‘Valley of Death’ [1]. During the past years, as other Patients’ Foundations, we have been taking on the role of ‘venture philanthropists’ by contributing to bridge the gap between promising discoveries and the commercial expertise to move them forward. We will present the case of the GPR17 research project that aims at developing new re-myelinating therapies. However, it is only the shared responsibility of the stakeholders involved in every stage of drug discovery and development—at any phase, in the public, non-profit and private sector—to contribute to filling the translational gap [2]. It is urgent to conceive new collaborative operational models to create a bioinnovation ecosystem that fosters collegial interactions among all the relevant stakeholders on non-competitive research. We will present our experience towards expediting the discovery and development of therapies for Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS) [3] for the benefit of patients of the estimated 1 million people worldwide who have Progressive MS. Despite great progress in relapsing MS, much work is needed to achieve similar successes for the neurodegenerative progressive forms of MS.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

In spite of well-understood features on the signaling cascade after stimulation of the purinoreceptors, the mechanism of how ATP is released from the purinergic cells is less characterized. ATP is released through at least three distinct pathways: vesicular secretion, channel-mediated release and simply cell breakdown. Recent studies have revealed two membrane proteins which play an essential role in these pathways: vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) that is responsible for vesicular storage of ATP, and pannexin 1 that is responsible for ATP release through plasma membrane. In this symposium, we focus on VNUT and pannexin 1, and discuss the significance of the two membrane proteins in purinergic chemical transmission. After introducing the overall feature of mechanism of ATP release, three young Japanese researchers will talk about frontier of VNUT study: Dr. Hiasa is going to talk the role of VNUT in platelet, Dr. Sakamoto will talk about the effect of VNUT knock out on the neuroendocrine functions, and Dr. Nakagomi will talk about the effect of VNUT knock out on physiological and pathological aspects of bladder epithelium. Then, Dr. Isakson will talk about role of pannexin 1 in vascular ATP release. Finally Dr. Lazarowski will overview of progress of ATP release and talk about recent work on nucleotide release from airway epithelial cells as a good model of coordinated participation of both VNUT and pannexin 1.\n\nVesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) in platelets\n\nMiki Hiasa\n\nDepartment of Membrane Biochemistry, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan\n\nExtracellular nucleotides function as intercellular messengers and cause various physiological or pathological responses upon binding to purinoceptors on the target cells. In platelets, nucleotides are stored in the dense granules and their release facilitates platelet aggregation through purinoceptors and that in consequence, platelets play an essential role in hemostasis and thrombosis. However, the mechanism of how platelets store nucleotides in the granules is far less understood.\n\nIn 2008, Dr. Moriyama and colleagues identified Vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT, SLC17A9 protein) that is responsible for the vesicular storage and subsequent exocytosis of ATP [1]. VNUT transports nucleotides such as ATP and ADP using the membrane potential established by vacuolar proton ATPases. The ATP uptake requires low concentrations of Cl− and inhibited by Evans Blue, DIDS and keton bodies. In analogy to other vesicular neurotransmitter transporters, VNUT is also a potential molecular probe for identifying the sites of vesicular ATP storage and secretion.\n\nIn the present study, we investigated the possible involvement of VNUT in the vesicular storage and release of nucleotides in platelets. We demonstrated that VNUT was expressed in human platelets and associated with dense granules and detected VNUT transport activity in platelet membrane vesicles. RNA interference suppressed both VNUT expression and Ca2+-dependent release of nucleotides in clonal human megakaryoblastic cells. Furthermore, identification of glyoxylate as a reversible inhibitor of VNUT provided a clue for development of selective modulator of VNUT activity to control nucleotides release in vivo [2].\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Although the vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) has been shown to be involved in vesicular storage and release of ATP, its physiological relevance in vivo is far less well understood. In Vnut knockout (Vnut−/−) mice, we found that the loss of functional VNUT in adrenal chromaffin granules and insulin granules in the islets of Langerhans led to several significant effects. Vesicular ATP accumulation and depolarization-dependent ATP release were absent in the chromaffin granules of Vnut−/− mice and the synthesis and exocytosis of adrenaline and noradrenaline were significantly decreased. Glucose-responsive ATP release was also absent in pancreatic β-cells in Vnut−/− mice, while glucose-responsive insulin secretion was enhanced to a greater extent than that in wild-type tissue. Vnut−/− mice exhibited improved glucose tolerance and low blood glucose upon fasting due to increased insulin sensitivity. These results demonstrated an essential role of VNUT in vesicular storage and release of ATP in neuroendocrine cells in vivo and suggest that vesicular ATP and/or its degradation products act as feedback regulators in catecholamine and insulin secretion, thereby regulating blood glucose homeostasis.\n\nThe role of VNUT in bladder epithelium\n\nHiroshi Nakagomi1,*, Tsutomu Mochizuki1, Mitsuharu Yoshiyama1 Youichi Shinozaki2, Keisuke Shibata2, Tatsuya Miyamoto1, Masayuki Takeda1, Yoshinori Moriyama3 and Schuichi Koizumi2\n\n1Department of Urology, Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Medicine and Engineering, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan;2Department of Neuropharmacology, Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Medicine and Engineering, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan;3Department of Membrane Biochemistry, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan\n\nThe urothelium of urinary bladder functions not only a passive barrier against ions and infections, but also functions as a sensor responding to various types of stimuli including physical stimulation by bladder filling. Urothelial cells release ATP as well as other chemical mediators in response to stretch-stimulation. Among these, ATP plays a central role because it activates P2 receptors on primary afferent fibers to transmit sensation of micturition to the CNS. However, the mechanisms underlying ATP release in response to various stretch stimuli remain largely unknown. Here we show that the urothelial cells exocytose ATP via a VNUT-dependent mechanism. Immunostaining studies showed that VNUT signals were highly expressed in all urothelial cell layers in mouse bladder and cultured urothelial cells. The VNUT signals labeled by RFP were co-located with the fluorescent ATP analogue mant-ATP and quinacrine. We visualized the real-time dynamics of ATP release using quinacrine, and found that they were exocytosed. The stretch-evoked ATP release was significantly reduced by the treatment of VNUT siRNA or several inhibitors of vesicular exocytosis. These findings suggest that VNUT plays an important role in stretch-elicited ATP release from urothelium. Recently we have succeeded in generating VNUT-KO mice. We have started to analyze phenotypes of these mice both in vivo and in vitro experiments, including the stretch-evoked ATP release from urothelium, bladder functions and urination behaviors. I will also present these results obtained from VNUT-KO mice in this symposium.\n\nPannexin 1 channels on smooth muscle cell regulates α1-adrenergic vasoconstriction and blood pressure\n\nBrant E. Isakson\n\nRobert M. Berne Cardiovascular Research Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville Virginia USA\n\nWe recently demonstrated a key role for pannexin (Panx1) in α1-adrenergic receptor (α1-AR) stimulation of resistance arteries (Billaud et al., Circ Res 2012). However, the participation of Panx1 in other contractile pathways has not been investigated. Therefore, we stimulated resistance arteries with endothelin-1, serotonin, AngII, ATP, noradrenaline and phenylephrine (PE). Only noradrenaline and PE responses were altered by pharmacological pannexin inhibitors. In addition, release of ATP and Panx 1 currents could only be detected when PE or noradrenaline was used. These results were verified using proximity ligation assays demonstrating α1-AR/Panx1 interaction, but no Panx1 interactions with any of the other vasoconstrictor receptors. Using a heterologous expression system expressing α1-AR and Panx1, we created mutations in the Panx1 intracellular loop and found tyrosine 198 conversion to alanine inhibited ATP release and channel current after PE or noradrenaline. Custom antibodies were created which demonstrated specific phosphorylation of Panx1 at tyrosine 198 only after noradrenaline or phenylephrine stimulation of resistance arteries. To further evaluate the potential role for Panx1 in smooth muscle, a novel transgenic mouse that had specific deletion of Panx1 in the smooth muscle (Panx1fl/fl/Cre+) cells under the control of tamoxifen was created. Functionally, these mice after tamoxfien injection had significantly decreased responses to noradrenaline and phenylephrine, but the vasoconstrictions to endothelin-1 or serotonin were unchanged. Importantly, Panx1fl/fl/Cre+ +tamoxifen mice were significantly hypotensive. Our results show that Panx1 has an exclusive interaction with α1-AR in smooth muscle of resistance arteries that together can regulate vascular tone and blood pressure.\n\nPannexin 1 and vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) contribute to airway epithelial nucleotide release\n\nJuliana I. Sesma, Barbara R. Grubb, Catharina van Hesden, Silvia M. Kreda and Eduardo R. Lazarowski*\n\nCystic Fibrosis/Pulmonary Research & Treatment Center University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA\n\nExtracellular ATP and its metabolic product adenosine regulate ion channel/fluid secretion activities necessary for mucin hydration via activation of airway epithelial P2Y2 and A2B receptors. In spite of the pathophysiological relevance of the responses triggered by extracellular nucleotides in the lung, the mechanisms of airway epithelial nucleotide release in normal and inflamed airways has only recently begun to be addressed. Insights into these mechanisms emerged from the identification of (i) pannexin 1 as a plasma membrane ATP channel and (ii) solute carrier (SLC) transporters that control the uptake and storage of nucleotides in secretory vesicles/granules. Our recent studies suggest that, in the airways, pannexin 1 mediates ATP release from ciliated cells-dominated airway epithelia, whereas VNUT controls nucleotide levels within mucin granules and contributes to the release of ATP from mucin secreting cells. Notably, primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells exposed to inflammatory factors from cystic fibrosis (CF) airways exhibited enhanced hypotonicity-evoked ATP release, relative to non-inflamed cultures. ATP release from inflamed cells was sensitive to inhibitors of the secretory pathway, but was not accompanied by mucin secretion. Thus, vesicular mechanisms, additional or alternative to mucin granules, contribute to the release of ATP from CF-like inflamed airway epithelia. Current studies in our lab are addressing the contribution of VNUT and pannexin 1 to mucociliary clearance activities and inflammation in mouse models of obstructed lung diseases.\n\nThu 2 C: Purinergic control of synaptic transmission\n\nPurinergic signalling in neuronal-glial networks\n\nAlexei Verkhratsky\n\nFaculty of Life Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK\n\nPurinergic transmission is one of the most ancient and widespread extracellular signalling systems. In the brain, purinergic signalling plays a unique role in integrating neuronal and glial cellular circuits, as virtually every type of glial cell possesses receptors to purines and pyrimidines. These receptors, represented by metabotropic P1 adenosine receptors, metabotropic P2Y purinoceptors and ionotropic P2X purinoceptors, control numerous physiological functions of glial cells and are intimately involved in virtually every form of neuropathology.\n\nKey words: P2X receptors, NMDA receptors, Ca2+ signalling; Na+ signalling\n\nModulation of GABAergic inhibition in the hippocampus by adenosine\n\nAna M. Sebastião1,*, Diogo M. Rombo1, Karri P. Lamsa2 and Joaquim A. Ribeiro1\n\n1Institute of Pharmacology and Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine and Unit of Neurosciences, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Lisbon, Portugal;2Department of Pharmacology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK\n\nAdenosine is an endogenous antiepileptic substance, with well known modulatory actions upon excitatory transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus [1]. However, in spite of the relevance of GABAergic inhibitory transmission to control seizures, little is known about the role of adenosine on this system. We recently reported that adenosine can interfere with the life-span of GABA at synapses, by regulating the activity of GABA transporters. At nerve endings only A2A receptors (R) are involved [2], but in astrocytes A1R and A2AR act as tetramers that signal via two different G proteins, Gs and Gi/0, to fine-tune GABA uptake [3]. We now focused upon the action of adenosine at inhibitory synapses, distinguishing between modulation of inhibitory inputs to excitatory neurons and modulation of inhibitory inputs to inhibitory neurons.\n\nWe recorded GABAAR-mediated currents in pyramidal neurons and in interneurons of the CA1 area in hippocampal slices, and found that activation of A1R inhibits GABAAR currents both in pyramidal cells and in specific interneurons expressing cannabinoid receptor type 1. Interestingly, the A1R-mediated suppression was only detected in GABAergic currents generated at perisynaptic/extrasynaptic site. Regarding adenosine A2ARs, we found, in contrast, that they operate presynaptically at parvalbumin expressing neurons to facilitate GABAergic inputs to other inhibitory neurons.\n\nWe conclude that cell type-specific localization and function of A1R and A2AR control phasic (A2AR) and tonic (A1R) GABAergic transmission in the hippocampus. In addition, the finding that adenosine modulation of inhibition is synapse-specific indicates that it operates at key points of the hippocampus to control network excitability.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Our recent work was focused on the interaction of postsynaptic P2X and NMDA receptors.\n\nInteraction between P2X and NMDA receptors was studied in the pyramidal neurons of neocortical slices and in the individual synapses. Advanced technique of acute cell isolation allowed cells to retain the proximal dendrites with attached synaptic boutons. The presence of functional synapses was confirmed by activity-dependent staining with FM1-43 and recording of miniature spontaneous mEPSCs resembling those recorded in slices. This preparation enabled to elicit synaptic currents in single bouton by stimulation with external electric field applied via micropipette. Excitatory synaptic currents, recorded both in the individual synapses and in neurons in slice, exhibited two components: glutamatergic and purinergic, mediated by P2X receptors. The co-localization of P2X and glutamate receptors was verified by immunolabeling of living cells with P2X and GluN antibodies.\n\nWe found out the ATP can be co-released with glutamate and activate P2X receptors causing a decrease in the NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents via Ca2+-dependent de-phosphorylation. P2X-activated down-regulation of NMDA receptors was abolished in the mutant mice, lacking the PDZ-domains of PSD-95 complex. Abolishing of purinergic regulation of NMDA receptors either by knock-out of P2X receptor or by PDZ mutation or pharmacologically lead to substantial increase in the long-term potentiation induced by weaker tetanic stimulation. Combined, these results suggest an important physiological role for postsynaptic P2X receptors in central synapses.\n\nSynaptic effects of adenosine A2ARs: interactions with other receptors and possible implications for CNS diseases\n\nPatrizia Popoli\n\nDepartment of Therapeutic Research and Medicines Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Roma, Italy\n\nAdenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) are highly expressed in the striatum and, thanks to their ability to establish functional and molecular interactions with many other receptors, they play a pivotal role in the modulation and integration of striatal neurotransmission.\n\nBesides the recently reported regulatory role of striatal A2ARs on the synaptic effects of BDNF and cocaine [1,2], their interaction with cannabinoid CB1 receptors seems to be particularly intriguing, since A2ARs can exert both a permissive and an inhibitory influence on CB1-dependent effects [3]. To further investigate such a complex interaction, we studied, by extracellular field potential recordings in corticostriatal slices, the synaptic effects of the CB1R agonist WIN 55212,2 (WIN) in wild type (WT) and transgenic rats overexpressing A2ARs, TGR(NSEhA2A) [4]. While WIN (2 μM) induced a marked depression of synaptic transmission in both genotypes, it was significantly less effective in transgenic (−40 % of basal amplitude) than in WT rats (−70 % of basal, P < 0.001). Such an impairment of CB1-mediated effects could depend on the overexpression of pre-synaptic A2ARs, since the inhibition exerted by WIN on K+-evoked glutamate efflux was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in striatal synaptosomes from TGR(NSEhA2A) than WT rats. Furthermore, TGR(NSEhA2A) rats showed a significantly reduced hypolocomotion in response to WIN (5 mg/kg i.p., P < 0.05). These data confirm the strong modulatory role exterted by A2ARs on CB1-mediated effects. The different role of pre- vs. postsynaptic A2ARs, their interaction with other receptors, the role of A2ARs-CB1 heteromers, and the potential relevance of the A2AR-CB1R interaction to neurodegenerative diseases will be further evaluated.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Vienna, Vienna, Austria\n\nWhile the roles of P2X receptors in autonomic and sensory neurons have been elucidated to a great extent, the functions of P2Y receptors in the peripheral nervous system remained largely controversial. In dorsal root ganglion neurons, nucleotides increased excitability simultaneously via P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors. The underlying mechanisms involved an inhibition of Kv7 channels and a facilitation of TRPV1 channels. Both effects relied on activation of phospholipase C and increases in intracellular Ca2+. The facilitation of TRPV1, but not the inhibition of Kv7 channels, required protein kinase C. In the presence of blockers of Kv7 and TRPV1 channels, nucleotides did not affect the excitability of sensory neurons [1]. In postganglionic sympathetic neurons, nucleotides co-released together with noradrenaline mediate feedback regulation of transmitter output: through presynaptic P2Y12 receptors, nucleotides caused an inhibition of transmitter release via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins; through presynaptic P2Y1 receptors, nucleotides caused an enhancement via phospholipase C. Activation of P2Y1 receptors also led to an inhibition of Kv7 channels in sympathetic neurons, as did the activation of P2Y6 [2]. However, neither activators nor inhibitors of Kv7 channels did affect transmitter release. Phorbol esters and diacyl glycerol analogues occluded facilitatory effects of nucleotides, but PKC inhibitors had no effect. Long lasting phorbol ester treatment down regulated munc13 and prevented facilitatory effects of nucleotides. Thus, the facilitation of sympathetic transmitter release via P2Y1 receptors appears to be mediated by munc13 isoforms. In summary, in peripheral autonomic and sensory neurons various P2Y receptors cooperate to tightly control excitability and neurotransmitter output.\n\nThis study was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Topical application of selective adenosine A2A receptor agonists promotes wound closure in both healthy and diabetic animals1. Despite the poor granulation tissue formation observed in A2A receptors deficient mice, re-epithelialization was not compromised2. Examination of adenosine receptor expression in foreskin keratinocytes confirmed that the A2B subtype is most prominently expressed, followed by the A2A receptor, while subtypes A1 and A3 were undetectable. Both the non-selective adenosine receptor agonist 5′-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (NECA) and the selective A2B agonist BAY 60-6583 decreased keratinocyte proliferation and increased cAMP production and intracellular calcium levels. In contrast, the selective A2A agonist CGS-21680 promoted cell proliferation and failed to increase cAMP, but dose-dependently inhibit TNFα production by stimulated keratinocytes. Pretreatment with CGS-21680 (5 μg per site) prevented the epidermal hyperplasia and inflammatory response induced by topical application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 2 nmol/site) for three consecutive days, while promoted dermal fibroblasts proliferation and collagen deposition in dermis. Interestingly, in epidermis from psoriatic patients we found decreased A2B receptors expression and increased A2A receptor expression. We could reproduce this pattern by treating keratinocytes from healthy donors with the cytokine IFNγ. Additionally, TNFα and IL-1β also increased A2A receptor expression, whereas IFNα and TPA decreased A2B receptor expression. Our results suggest that adenosine plays an important role regulating epidermal inflammation and keratinocyte function, and thus may constitute an interesting therapeutic strategy in inflammatory hyperproliferative skin diseases such as psoriasis.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

New York, NY, USA\n\nBone is a dynamic organ that undergoes continuous remodeling whilst maintaining a balance between bone formation and resorption. Various types of orthopedic procedures, including spinal fusion and repair of bone defects due to trauma, infection or metastatic disease, require formation of new bone. We have previously reported that A2AR stimulation inhibits osteoclast differentiation but only A2BR stimulation affects osteoblast differentiation or function. Here we report on the role of A2AR in promoting bone regeneration and healing both in vitro and in vivo and explore the mechanisms by which A2AR stimulates bone regeneration.\n\nAdenosine receptors and tissue fibrosis\n\nBruce N. Cronstein1, Miguel Perez Aso2 and Jessica Feig1\n\n1NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA; 2Barcelona, Spain\n\nRecent studies have clearly demonstrated the role of adenosine and its receptors in promoting wound healing and tissue repair. Indeed, overabundant tissue repair and fibrosis are consequences of adenosine generation and receptor ligation in the skin and such organs as the liver, lungs and peritoneum [1]. In our recent studies we have found that adenosine A2A receptor ligation plays a critical role in diffuse dermal fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, scars in the skin and, more recently, radiation dermatitis. Here we will review recent studies demonstrating the central role of adenosine, generated as a result of extracellular nucleotide hydrolysis, and adenosine A2A receptors in promoting dermal and hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, we have recently found that agents that diminish extracellular adenosine levels inhibit fibrosis in mice and there is evidence from clinical studies that some of these agents may be useful for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis. Adenosine receptor blockade and diminished adenosine generation may be useful approaches to the treatment of fibrosing diseases, currently an unmet medical need.\n\nReference\n\n1.

From being viewed as a possible evolutionary rudiment, today the primary cilium has achieved the noble status of a physiologically relevant cellular structure. Its prime function in renal epithelium appears to be its ability to sense urinary flow. Much is still lacking to understand how the primary cilium senses flow. Transducer proteins, such as specific mechano-sensory ion channels, have been identified and are necessary for flow-dependent increases of epithelial [Ca2+]i. A flow-induced increase of [Ca2+]i has been observed in all renal and other ciliated epithelial cells. Work over the last 5 years has addressed the mechanism underlying the flow-induced increase of [Ca2+]i. It has become apparent that an initial Ca2+ influx triggers a global increase of epithelial [Ca2+]i. Eventually, it is also clear that mechanical stimulation of the epithelial cells triggers the release of ATP. Intriguingly, ATP is an auto-and paracrine signaling molecule that regulates electrolyte and water transport in the nephron by binding to apical and basolateral purinergic receptors. ATP inhibits transport at almost all sites from the proximal to the distal tubule and thus elicits a diuretic response. In this perspective, the primary cilium is a sensory structure and the adequate stimulus is the mechanical deflection. The output signal is the released ATP, a paracrine factor that ultimately modulates the main function of the kidney, i.e. the enormous task of absorbing some 180 l of filtrate every day.\n\nThu 3 A: New technologies in purine receptor research\n\nSingle molecule detection at adenosine receptors\n\nStephen J. Hill\n\nCell Signalling Research Group, School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, UK\n\nOur previous work, using fluorescent adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists, has provided novel insights into the allosteric regulation of adenosine A3 and A1 receptors by allosteric ligands and homodimerisation [1,2]. We have also used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to investigate ligand binding to A1 and A3 receptors in small microdomains of single living cells [3,4]. FCS studies with a fluorescent A3-agonist has enabled high affinity labeling of the active conformation (R*) of the receptor. We have now used a fluorescent adenosine A3-antagonist ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CA200645\",\"term_id\":\"35234116\",\"term_text\":\"CA200645\"}}CA200645) to study the binding characteristics of antagonist-occupied receptor conformations (R) in membrane microdomains of individual cells. FCS analysis of {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CA200645\",\"term_id\":\"35234116\",\"term_text\":\"CA200645\"}}CA200645-occupied A3-receptors revealed two species (τD2 and τD3) that diffused at 2.29 ± 0.35 and 0.09 ± 0.03 μm2/s, respectively. FCS analysis of a GFP-tagged A3-receptor exhibited a single diffusing species (0.087 μm2/s) that was not altered by pre-treatment with A3-agonists or A3-antagonists. The binding of {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CA200645\",\"term_id\":\"35234116\",\"term_text\":\"CA200645\"}}CA200645 to τD3 was antagonized by nanomolar concentrations of the A3-antagonist MRS 1220, but not by NECA (up to 300 nM) consistent with labeling of the inactive conformation (R) of the receptor. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CA200645\",\"term_id\":\"35234116\",\"term_text\":\"CA200645\"}}CA200645 normally dissociated slowly from the A3-receptor but inclusion of the allosteric ligand VUF 5455, or the orthosteric ligand xanthine amine congener, during washout markedly accelerated the reduction in the number of particles exhibiting τD3 characteristics consistent with an allosteric effect. The potential for FCS analysis of ligand-occupied receptors to provide a powerful and unique means to monitor ligand residence times, and the impact of allosteric regulators on them, will be discussed.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

To address the central question whether A2AR activation in hippocampus is sufficient to impair memory function and to begin elucidating the intracellular pathways operated by A2AR, we have developed a chimeric rhodopsin-A2AR protein (optoA2AR), which retains the extracellular and transmembrane domains of rhodopsin (conferring light responsiveness and eliminating adenosine binding pockets) fused to the intracellular loop of A2AR to confer specific A2AR signaling. The specificity of the optoA2AR signaling was confirmed by light-induced selective enhancement of cAMP and phospho-MAPK (but not cGMP) levels in HEK293 cells, which was abolished by a point-mutation at the C-terminal of A2AR. Supporting its physiological relevance, optoA2AR and the A2AR agonist {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CGS21680\",\"term_id\":\"878113053\",\"term_text\":\"CGS21680\"}}CGS21680 produced comparable and additive activation of cAMP and phospho-MAPK signaling in HEK293 cells and of c-Fos in the mouse brain. Remarkably, optoA2AR and {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CGS21680\",\"term_id\":\"878113053\",\"term_text\":\"CGS21680\"}}CGS21680 triggered a preferential phosho-CREB signaling in hippocampusor phospho-MAPK signaling in nucleus accumbens. Importantly, light optoA2AR activation of CREB signaling in the hippocampus impaired spatial memory performance while optoA2AR activation of MAPK signaling in the nucleus accumbens modulated locomotor activity. This shows that the recruitment of intracellular A2AR signaling in hippocampus is sufficient to trigger memory dysfunction. Furthermore, the demonstration of the intracellular control of biased A2AR signaling and behaviors prompts the possibility of targeting the intracellular A2AR interacting partners to selectively control different neuropsychiatric behaviors.\n\nScreening in academia. A case for P2X7 allosteric modulators\n\nMichael Schaefer*, Christoph Hempel, Melanie Kaiser, Tanja Plötz, Helga Sobottka, Wolfgang Fischer and Wolfgang Nörenberg\n\nRudolf-Boehm-Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Leipzig, Haertelstr. 16-18, 04107 Leipzig, Germany\n\nP2X receptors are plasma membrane-resident, ligand-gated cation channels that feature an extracellularly exposed ATP binding pocket that may be addressed by orthosteric ligands. In addition, the complex structure of P2X receptors offers many opportunities to bind small drug-like molecules that may affect the ligand binding or gating properties in an allosteric manner. Applying libraries of known biologically active molecules and an academic-scale screening assay, we found that human P2X7 (hP2X7) is modulated by a plethora of chemically diverse molecules, including perazine-type tricyclic antipsychotics, first generation antihistamines, an unexpected modulation by the otherwise P2X4-specific ivermectin, natural compounds and semisynthetic drugs. Mechanistically, all novel modulators that we have identified act in an allosteric fashion, but display distinct properties with regard to the positive or negative mode of P2X7 modulation, as well as the underlying biophysical mechanisms. Clemastine stabilizes the open state of the channel and increases the potency of ATP. The perazines PCP and TFP change the channel’s activation and deactivation times, causing a suppression of P2X7 currents and Ca2+ fluxes. Ivermectin causes higher maximal current amplitudes without affecting the ligand binding potency. Tanshinone IIA sulfonate inhibits hP2X7 in a voltage-dependent manner, presumably by binding to the intracellular moiety of the channel protein. Even more intriguingly, the majority of allosteric P2X7 modulators were not only isotype-selective, but also discriminated between species variants of P2X7. In agreement with recent work of Anton D. Michels group, we found that exchanging few amino acid residues in a region that corresponds to the top of the outer vestibule in P2X4 dramatically changes the impact of allosteric modulators on the ATP-induced P2X7 gating. We conclude that the unique susceptibility of P2X7 to allosteric modulation is an isotype- and species-specific phenomenon.\n\nThe value of label-free biosensors for deciphering signaling and function of orphan P2Y-like purinoreceptors\n\nEvi Kostenis\n\nInstitute of Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Bonn, Nussallee 6, 53115 Bonn, Germany\n\nFor a number of GPCRs, primary messengers are known and these have often aided in understanding their biological function. Orphan GPCRs, on the contrary, are receptors which are targets for undiscovered transmitters and this lack of knowledge often precludes assignment of a precise biological role. Nevertheless, orphan receptors may create excitement in academia and the drug discovery industry, if, for example, knockout mouse models reveal an intriguing phenotype.\n\nGPR17 is such an orphan receptor. It is a member of the rhodopsin-family of GPCRs phylogenetically related to receptors of the purinergic cluster. In line with this notion, uracil-nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotrienes have been proposed as endogenous ligands [1]. However, we and several other laboratories failed to confirm activation of GPR17 by the proposed natural ligands [2–6]. In this talk I will initially illustrate the efforts we made to recapitulate activation of GPR17 by the proposed endogenous modulators and then present the strategy we applied to identify a surrogate agonist for GPR17 taking advantage of the cutting edge label-free technology platforms based on dynamic mass redistribution and bio-impedance, respectively, which resolve cellular signaling irrespective of the receptor’s primary signaling pathway. I will then exemplify how we utilized the novel ligand to decipher the biological role of orphan GPR17 and its therapeutic potential [6].\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Heitman*, Dong Guo, Tamara A. M. Mocking and Ad P. IJzerman\n\nDepartment of Medicinal Chemistry, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR), Leiden University, The Netherlands\n\nThe molecular mechanism of how ligands dissociate from their receptors remains to be determined. We therefore performed long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations of a prototypic GPCR, the adenosine A2A receptor, to identify amino acid residues that influence the dissociation of the antagonist ZM241385 from the receptor. We selected 12 amino acids that were mutated to alanine and experimentally determined ZM241385’s affinity and binding kinetics. Several mutants significantly affected the kinetics of the antagonist ZM241385, despite minimally influencing its binding affinity. These mutants include E1695.30Q, H2646.66A and T2566.58A accelerating ZM241385’s egress from the receptors and I662.64A, S672.65A, K153ECL2A and L2677.32A retarding the process. We conclude that ZM241385 follows a multi-step dissociation pathway, consecutively interacting with topographically distinct domains in the receptor. We speculate that this multi-step dissociation process may be common to other GPCRs as well.\n\nThu 3 B: Purinergic signaling in the cardiovascular system\n\nNovel protective role of endogenous cardiac myocyte P2X4 receptors in heart failure\n\nTiehong Yang1, Jian-Bing Shen1, Ronghua Yang1, John Redden1, Kimberley Dodge-Kafka1, James Grady1, Kenneth A Jacobson and Bruce T. Liang1,*\n\n1University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, USA;2National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA\n\nBackground: Heart failure (HF), despite continuing progress, remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. P2X4 receptors (P2X4R) have emerged as potentially important molecules in regulating cardiac function and as potential targets for HF therapy. Transgenic (Tg) P2X4R overexpression can protect against HF, but this does not explain the role of native cardiac P2X4R.\n\nObjective: Our goal is to define the physiological role of endogenous cardiac myocyte P2X4R under basal conditions and during HF induced by myocardial infarction or pressure overload.\n\nMethods and Results: Mice established with conditional cardiac-specific P2X4R knockout (KO) were subjected to left coronary ligation-induced post-infarct or transverse aorta constriction-induced pressure overload HF. KO cardiac myocytes did not show P2X4R by immunoblotting or by any response to the P2X4R-specific allosteric enhancer ivermectin. KO hearts showed normal basal cardiac function but depressed contractile performance in post-infarct and pressure overload models of HF by in vivo echocardiography and ex vivo isolated working heart parameters. P2X4R co-immunoprecipitated and co-localized with nitric oxide synthase 3 (eNOS) in wild type cardiac myocytes. Mice with cardiac-specific P2X4R overexpression had increased S-nitrosylation, cGMP, NO formation, and were protected from post-infarct and pressure overload HF. Inhibitor of eNOS L-NIO blocked the salutary effect of cardiac P2X4R overexpression in post-infarct and pressure overload HF as did eNOS knockout.\n\nConclusions: This study establishes a new protective role for endogenous cardiac myocyte P2X4R in HF and is the first to demonstrate a physical interaction between the myocyte receptor and eNOS, a mediator of HF protection.\n\nExtracellular adenosine production in human coronary arteries\n\nA. Deussen1, P. Dieterich1, C. Mehnert1, C. von Klitzing1, V. Thom1 and K.

In particular, ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD73) has attracted much notice in the past as its activity is typically rate limiting for the conversion from ATP to adenosine. However, in addition to CD73 many tissues exhibit expression and activity of alkaline phosphatase which also hydrolyses 5′-AMP to adenosine. In previous cell studies (endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells) we could not find evidence for significant alkaline phosphatase activity. Similarly, isolated guinea pig heart did not show evidence of alkaline phosphatase activity. However, more recent experiments conducted on isolated mouse hearts exhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in addition to CD73 activity. This prompted us to address the question whether alkaline phosphatase activity is also active in human vessels. For this purpose we studied human internal mammary arteries and coronary vessels obtained from tissues removed during cardiac surgery. In addition to expression, immunohistochemistry and enzyme activity measurements (etheno(ε)-AMP conversion to ε-adenosine) in a flow-through vessel preparation we performed a mathematical model analysis based on the activity measurements. Whereas isolated human umbilical vein endothelial cells did not exhibit alkaline phosphatase activity, isolated human arteries exhibited expression of both, alkaline phosphatase and CD73. In addition, similar enzymatic activities of alkaline phosphatase and CD73 were found. While CD73 expression was confined to the endothelial cells layer, alkaline phosphatase was attributed to the vessel media (immunostaining). When the endothelial layer had been removed from vessels, AOPCP was ineffective to inhibit AMP conversion to adenosine whereas levamisole was still active. The experiments reveal that in human arterial vessels alkaline phosphatase activity needs to be taken into account. The mathematical model analysis allows quantifying adenosine formation through both pathways. The model results show that the flux through the alkaline phosphatase pathway is quantitatively similar to that catalyzed by CD73.\n\nRole of A2Badenosine receptors in differentiation of infiltrating mononuclear leukocytes during myocardial infarction\n\nIgor Feoktistov and Sergey Ryzhov\n\nVanderbilt University, Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA\n\nAdenosine is a part of pathological microenvironment in ischemic myocardium and as such may participate in the regulation of various stages of events triggered by myocardial infarction (MI). Our previous studies have demonstrated an important role of A2B adenosine receptors (A2BR) in upregulation of paracrine factors in cardiac stem cell antigen-1-positive cells and promoting repair after MI. These data were in agreement with the current view of adenosine as a cardioprotective agent. We have now discovered that A2BR signaling also profoundly affects the response of mononuclear phagocyte system early after MI. We found that MI induced an acute accumulation of Ly6Chi monocytes in the injured myocardium of wild-type (WT) mice, with high and relatively stable numbers seen on days 3–5 post-MI. These myocardium-infiltrating monocytes eventually differentiated into mature myeloid mononuclear cells (MMCs) with a peak by day 7. In A2BR knockout (KO) mice, MI also induced accumulation of monocytes by day 3 in numbers comparable to those seen in WT hearts. However, the lack of A2BR resulted in accelerated differentiation of monocytes into MMCs, which numbers were greater and peaked earlier (by day 5) compared with WT animals. Analysis of the expression of pro-inflammatory (iNOS) and pro-angiogenic (VEGF) markers on day 5 post-MI revealed that Ly6Chi monocytes express high levels of iNOS but not VEGF. In contrast, MMCs expressed VEGF but significantly lower levels of iNOS. These data suggest that, whereas myocardium-infiltrating monocytes have a pro-inflammatory phenotype, their differentiation into MMCs may promote cardiac repair. To study the role of A2BR signaling in these cells in vitro, we generated Ly6Chi monocytes from bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells and incubated in a differentiating medium for 2 days in the absence or presence of the stable adenosine analog NECA. NECA significantly decreased the proportion of differentiated MMCs. In contrast, NECA had no effect on differentiation of HPC-derived monocytes obtained from A2BR KO mice. Importantly, populations of HPC-derived monocytes and MMCs recapitulated also the expression pattern of iNOS and VEGF seen in their in vivo counterparts. To determine if Gαs- or Gαq-linked pathways could contribute to A2BR-dependent regulation of monocyte differentiation, we compared the effects of their selective activators forskolin and Pasterela multocida toxin (PMT) to those of NECA. We found that, similar to stimulation of A2BR with NECA, direct stimulation of Gαq with PMT inhibited generation of MMCs, whereas stimulation of Gαs with forskolin had no effect. In summary, our new data suggest a surprisingly important role for A2BR-Gαq-mediated regulation of monocyte differentiation in the myocardium that represents a novel mechanism, by which these receptors may in fact worsen cardiac injury and delay reparative phase of MI.\n\nRole of CD73-derived adenosine and A2A/A2Breceptors on T-cells in cardiac remodeling after ischemia/reperfusion\n\nNadine Borg1,*, Florian Bönner2, Christoph Jacoby2, Nicole Görldt1, Zaoping Ding1, Daniela Friebe1, Sebastian Temme1, Ulrich Flögel1 and Jürgen Schrader1\n\n1Institute of Molecular Cardiology, Heinrich-Heine-University of Düsseldorf, Universitätsstr. 1, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany;2Department of Cardiology, Pneumology and Angiology, Heinrich-Heine-University of Düsseldorf, Moorenstr. 5, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany\n\nMyocardial infarction leads to a massive release of pro-inflammatory nucleotides, the extracellular degradation of which is controlled by a cascade of ectoenzymes. The final conversion to adenosine, a potent anti-inflammatory local autacoid, is catalyzed by Ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD73). We recently found, that global deficiency of CD73 results in impaired cardiac function after severe ischemia and subsequent reperfusion (I/R), accompanied by a prolonged cardiac inflammatory response, enhanced fibrosis, and immature scar formation. Experiments with chimeric mice demonstrate that CD73 present on cardiac immune cells can fully account for the observed phenotype. Since CD73 expression and activity was upregulated on infiltrating T-lymphocytes we explored the functional role of this ecto-nucleotidase on T-cells in the process of cardiac healing after I/R by using T-cell specific CD73−/− mice. Surprisingly, ventricular impairment and immature scar formation was found to be the same in the global and T-cell-specific CD73−/− mice as determined with cine 1H MRI and histology. To gain further mechanistic insights, we isolated T-cells from control and T-cell specific CD73−/− mice hearts and found that lack of CD73-derived adenosine triggers the formation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines, which may serve as instructive signals for the observed changes in phenotype. Gene expression analysis revealed that cardiac T-cells express both A2A and A2B adenosine receptors after I/R, while the A2B receptor was not expressed on respective blood cell controls.\n\nIn summary our findings provide first evidence, that adenosine formed by CD73 on T-cells plays a central role in the healing process after myocardial infarction.\n\nEffects of adenosine A2Breceptor blockade on atherosclerosis\n\nJoel Linden1,*, R.
