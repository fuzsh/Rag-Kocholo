        "text": "In the fall of 2023, Nashville Glasshaüs opened its doors. FRA alumnus Wyatt Maxwell '15 established a place where Nashvillians can grow, create, and dream. Wyatt is excited to tell the story of how his business began and how FRA has been instrumental in bringing this establishment to life. Glasshaüs offers a variety of unique experiences for everyone, including glass-blowing classes, event venue rentals, an art gallery, glassware for purchase, and even a coffee café. At the heart of Glasshaüs is a mission that mirrors FRA’s commitment to inclusiveness, inviting all to be a part of something special. Long-time mentor and former FRA faculty member Coach David Tucker and FRA alumnus Paul Nelson '88 have partnered with Wyatt, using their skills and passions to help Glasshaüs grow and become an integral part of Music City’s fabric. Read the open conversation among Wyatt, Paul, and David as they share God’s penmanship in shaping Glasshaüs’ story.\n\nWHAT IS THE ORIGIN STORY OF EACH OF YOU CREATING OR BECOMING A PART OF GLASSHAÜS?\n\nWyatt Maxwell: Back in 7th and 8th grade at FRA, my focus was solely on sports. That changed when Coach Tucker encouraged me to explore art, shifting my trajectory. After FRA, I attended Centre College, where Paul Nelson, another pivotal figure in my journey, taught guest lessons in my classes. Paul was the connecting piece, deepening my engagement with the art world, particularly glasswork. I eventually transferred to Belmont University, pursuing a business degree while continuing my passion for art. Then, the idea struck me: why wasn't there any glass blowing in Nashville? It wasn't just about art but about infusing entertainment into the creative process. Dissatisfied with a job I wasn't passionate about, I embarked on the journey to bring this vision to life with unwavering support from my parents. The pivotal \"who?\" question led me back to Paul Nelson and Coach Tucker, reigniting our collaborative efforts. Inspired by both men in ways I couldn’t fully explain, I knew we could transform any space into a hub of creativity and community through our partnership.\n\nPaul Nelson: Performative art has always captivated me, and Nashville seemed like the perfect canvas to bring this vision to life. When Wyatt first approached me with the idea, I was immediately drawn back to Nashville, recognizing the incredible opportunity it presented. That's why I returned in 2021, eager to contribute to the city's vibrant arts scene and create something extraordinary. Rapid fundraising and meticulous research, spearheaded by Wyatt, fueled the momentum for this project. Recognizing Nashville's experiential essence and seizing an opportunity zone, Wyatt secured a prime location, capitalizing on the rising property values, including the development of the soccer stadium.\n\nDavid Tucker: Wyatt's timing was perfect when he presented the idea to me. I had just decided to retire from teaching and coaching at FRA. Together, we started small, creating just 60 coffee mugs for the coffee shop. Getting my hands back on the wheel again and creating felt invigorating. Teaching classes at FRA was not only about sharing skills but also a personal journey for me. After retiring, there were aspects of art I had yet to explore. Now, I can delve into those uncharted territories and having both Paul and Wyatt as former students adds another layer of significance. We all share a common history, and now we're embarking on this new chapter to establish a needed place in Nashville.\n\nHOW DO YOU SEE FRA CONNECTED TO THE NEW STORY UNFOLDING AT GLASSHAÜS?\n\nWM: Learning from Coach Tucker in sports and arts instilled in me the profound value of positively impacting the community. It's not just about optimizing a business; it's about uplifting people and helping them grow into their best versions. Our logo, a smile, symbolizes our mission: to impact each person who walks through our doors positively. We're constantly experimenting with new ideas to inspire and empower those who engage with our space. Located in a neighborhood, we prioritize the people more than anything else, signaling, \"We are here, and we're here for you.\" With its steadfast foundation in a city constantly in flux, FRA is our example of being an anchor. We strive to mirror that adaptability, continually evolving to meet the needs of our community and the ever-changing landscape of Nashville.\n\nPN: God's hand has been evident in every step of this venture. Our roots at FRA, where God was central, have profoundly influenced our approach. When you enter our space, you'll feel His presence, unmistakably woven into the fabric of our environment. The mentorship and lessons learned from our time at FRA have been instrumental in shaping how we welcome those coming through our doors. Our logo, the smile, is a tangible representation of the joy and faith that underpins everything we do. It serves as a reminder of the positivity and hope we aim to spread to everyone interacting with us.\n\nDT: Since Wyatt first shared his vision for this space, he has intentionally brought Jesus into this business. Every person he hired has connections to a non-profit, Young Life, or his church. He allows churches to use this space for events and consistently says yes to the right opportunities. He listens to how God can use him, us, and this space. God is writing the story, and it’s evident in how the three of us have been brought together again to bring Him glory.\n\nWHAT ASPECTS OF GLASSHAÜS, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, EXCITE YOU THE MOST?\n\nWM: The highlight for me has been witnessing the magic unfold in our classes. These moments are extraordinary, from families bonding over pottery to unforgettable birthday parties. It's heartwarming to see people returning repeatedly, drawn in by our unique experience. With the upcoming addition of ceramics, we're thrilled to bridge the gap between clay and glass, offering even more immersive experiences. People crave hands-on opportunities, and ceramics provide the perfect avenue for that. We're focused on optimizing our experiences to ensure we meet people where they are and nurture their attachment to our craft. Having another FRA alum, Matt Ward ‘16, join us to teach weekend classes adds another layer of authenticity and connection. Local involvement is at the heart of everything we do, making each interaction personal and meaningful. I am excited to see this commitment now and in years to come.\n\nPN: Being part of this new venture has been incredibly exciting and educational. We're continuously refining our business model, focusing on recruiting talented artists and providing them with a platform to display their work. It's not just about highlighting art; it's about involving the community in every step of the process. We're dedicated to featuring diverse productions, always keeping things fresh and captivating for the public. With over 30 years of experience, I feel honored to oversee the studio and collaborate with artists from all over, introducing the art of glass to Nashville in an entirely new light. The response has been phenomenal with returning buyers and customers who appreciate our unique experiences and pieces. We're beginning to attract glass enthusiasts who are discovering the beauty and craftsmanship of our pieces. Whether it's an intimate and personal experience or simply enjoying coffee while watching the artists at work, there's something here for everyone. We strive to create moments that resonate with our guests, whether locals or visitors passing through.\n\nDT: It's fascinating how life can sometimes lead us down unexpected paths. When I had the chance to try glass blowing, it was a completely new experience for me. I had no prior knowledge or idea about it, but I saw it as an incredible opportunity to learn new skills and expand my horizons. Paul and Wyatt have played a crucial role in my journey, transitioning from being my students to becoming my teachers. This has allowed me to carve out a space to freely create and delve into the artist I want to become, which has been invaluable. This journey has opened doors to new possibilities and allowed me to explore my passion for art in ways I never imagined possible.\n\nWYATT, WHAT EXCITES YOU THE MOST ABOUT THE FUTURE OF GLASSHAÜS?\n\nWM: It feels like we're building on a solid foundation. It's not just about the art; it's about creating a space where individuals can grow and connect personally. I'm eager to see how this community evolves and continues to inspire one another, always striving to welcome others in, just as FRA has done for Coach Tucker, Paul, and myself.\n\nCAN YOU SHARE WITH US HOW YOU'VE SEEN THE HEART AND MISSION BEHIND FRA MIRROR YOUR PERSONAL LIFE MISSION?\n\nHal: It's been truly inspiring to witness how the mission of FRA aligns so closely with my own personal values and ethos in life. FRA is genuinely committed to making a positive impact, both within the school community and beyond its walls. One aspect that stands out to me is the Turner Fellows program. It's remarkable to see how this initiative has become deeply ingrained in FRA’s culture. The emphasis on leadership, service, and global awareness truly resonates with me. It's incredibly inspiring to watch members of the FRA community embrace this mindset and actively seek ways to make a difference in the world.\n\nWHAT IS A MANTRA YOU LIVE BY AND HOW DOES IT TIE INTO THE WORK YOU ARE DOING NOW AT THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION?\n\nHal: My personal North Star for the last 25 years has been about creating opportunities for others to live a hopeful and rewarding life. There's no greater satisfaction for me than knowing I've helped someone reach their full potential and experience greater happiness and fulfillment. At the Community Foundation, my personal mission is about connection – building relationships with people and places to foster genuine impact. I find immense fulfillment in forging meaningful relationships and leveraging them to make a positive difference in others' lives. I'm passionate about educating people on issues and communities they may not know about. The world is vast and filled with diverse experiences and perspectives; by expanding our knowledge and understanding, we can become more empathetic and effective agents of change.\n\nWHAT HAS BECOME IMPORTANT TO YOU SINCE STEPPING INTO YOUR POSITION AS CEO AT THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION?\n\nHal: I believe that one of the most powerful ways to awaken a sense of purpose in philanthropists is through conversations. By engaging in open and honest dialogues, we can help individuals articulate their values and passions, reflect on their legacy, and discover where their hearts truly lie. These conversations serve as a catalyst for developing a giving strategy that reflects not only their financial means but also their personal convictions and aspirations. It's important to recognize that philanthropy isn't solely about writing a check. While financial contributions are undoubtedly valuable, the thoughtfulness and attention behind those donations are what truly make a difference. Whether it's volunteering time, sharing expertise, or leveraging connections, there are countless ways to contribute meaningfully to the causes we care about.\n\nWHAT PERSONAL PASSIONS FOUND OR MOMENTS REMEMBERED FROM YOUR TIME AT FRA HAVE HELPED GUIDE YOU TO WHERE YOU ARE TODAY?\n\nHal: My personal passion has always been advocating for the underdog, those who often go unnoticed. This was sparked in fourth grade at FRA, during a visit to a retirement home. I was drawn to spending quiet time with an older woman who was alone rather than participating in group activities. Although I didn’t know it at the time, the seeds were planted that bloomed into a vocation focused not on standing in the spotlight but shining the spotlight on those that society would rather not see. This passion only grew stronger over the years. Aftercollege, I was drawn to volunteer work, particularly with Meals on Wheels. As I became more involved, I began recruiting friends and acquaintances to join me in making a difference. This grassroots effort eventually evolved into Hands On Nashville, officially starting in 1991. Looking back, I believe God ignites the fire within us. I know I was put on this earth to make things better, not for myself, but for others.\n\nGIVEN YOUR TIME IN LEADERSHIP ACROSS NASHVILLE, HOW HAVE YOU SEEN GENEROSITY IN NASHVILLE CHANGE?\n\nHal: Nashville has always had a generous spirit, but the approach to giving has evolved. Previously, it was more about meeting obligations or succumbing to social pressure rather than strategically investing in passions. However, in recent years, I've observed a shift towards a more intentional and thoughtful approach to philanthropy. There's now a growing conversation and curiosity surrounding the act of giving that wasn’t around before. Giving circles, for instance, have emerged as a platform for individuals to come together, learn from one another, and collectively support causes they are passionate about. People are asking more questions, seeking to understand the impact of their contributions and how they can make a meaningful difference.\n\nSO, WHEN DID THIS SHIFT OCCUR AND WHY?\n\nHal: I believe it's a combination of factors. First, there's the reality that we can’t rely solely on the government to solve all societal problems. Philanthropists are stepping forward, challenging the norms, and leveraging their resources and influence to enact positive change in their communities. Curiosity holds significant power. As people become more curious about their community challenges, they feel empowered to act and make a difference. This curiosity often leads to students immersing themselves, actively engaging, and understanding the needs of those around them. By getting closer to these issues, individuals are better equipped to address them effectively and create lasting change. I’m encouraged by the increased involvement of younger generations involved in philanthropy, as they ask questions and engage actively. In Nashville, people are seeking hope and purpose, and many find it within the non-profit sector.\n\nWHAT PROGRAMS, TEACHERS, OR MEMORIES HAVE HELPED GUIDE YOUR CAREER JOURNEY?\n\nHal: During my time at FRA, I was surrounded by remarkable mentors and role models like Carole Pieratt, Brenda Gideon, Coach Zab, and Sissy Wade. Coach Zab particularly stands out in my memory as someone who truly honored and celebrated who I was in high school. Sissy Wade was also pivotal in encouraging and helping me believe in myself. That sense of inclusivity and acceptance has stayed with me throughout my career, shaping how I approach my work every day. The spring musicals at FRA were also incredibly special. Despite our differences in interests, whether we were the quietest students, academic achievers, or star athletes, we all united to create something magical behind the scenes. It wasn't just about putting on a play; it was about the camaraderie and sense of belonging that came from collaborating for a common purpose.\n\nThis ethos of collaboration and inclusivity is a guiding principle in all my endeavors today. Everyone possesses unique strengths, and by recognizing and celebrating each individual’s gifts, we can cultivate a stronger, more vibrant community for everyone. Whether through mentorship, volunteering, or simply offering a helping hand, I'm committed to touching as many lives as possible and making a positive impact wherever I go."
