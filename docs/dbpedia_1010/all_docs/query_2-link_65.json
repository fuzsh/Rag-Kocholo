        "text": "Leadership Comments\n\nBIOCON GROUP\n\n“Biocon delivered Consolidated Revenue of Rs 4,519 crore for Q3FY24, driven by 65% growth in Biosimilars and 9% growth in Research Services. Consolidated EBITDA at Rs 1,492 crore grew by 106%. Net Profit, boosted by other income, stood at Rs 660 crore.\n\n“A key milestone this quarter was the successful conclusion of the transition of the acquired business by Biocon Biologics and a pre-payment of ~USD 200 million towards the acquisition-related debt reduction. Steady market shares for key biosimilars in the U.S. and EU were complemented by the Emerging Markets performance which saw a number of new product launches and tender wins.\n\n“We continue to make steady progress towards strengthening the foundation for a sustainable growth across all three business segments.”\n\n— Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Executive Chairperson, Biocon and Biocon Biologics\n\nBIOCON GENERICS\n\n“The Generics business delivered 4% sequential revenue growth in the third quarter, driven by higher API sales.\n\n“The year-on-year performance, however, was muted on account of continued pricing pressure that impacted customer offtake in our API business, compared to the previous fiscal. This was partially offset by growth in our Generic Formulations portfolio. While we expect pricing pressure in the API business to persist, we continue our focus on driving cost and execution efficiencies throughout the business, to mitigate future impact.\n\n“We received a tentative approval of our ANDA for Dasatinib tablets from the U.S. FDA recently, which reinforces our strategy to vertically integrate complex, difficult-to-make products.”\n\n— Siddharth Mittal, CEO & Managing Director, Biocon Limited\n\nBIOCON BIOLOGICS\n\n“Biocon Biologics successfully completed the complex, accelerated integration of the entire acquired business across 120+ countries, one year ahead of plan, transforming us into a unique, fully integrated, ‘lab-to market’ leading global biosimilars player. Our focus has been on preserving value, business continuity and ensuring a seamless experience for our patients, customers, and partners across the world. This success is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team and advisors.\n\n“During the quarter, the business delivered 65% year-on-year growth as we continued to see robust demand for our products with market shares increasing across geographies. We onboarded new customers and won several key tenders.”\n\n— Shreehas Tambe, CEO & Managing Director, Biocon Biologics Limited\n\nSYNGENE\n\n“Syngene reported a revenue growth of 9% year-on-year in the third quarter on the back of good performance by Dedicated Centers, Development and Manufacturing divisions. Though demand in our Discovery Services division was impacted during the quarter by headwinds in the U.S. biotech segment, we are starting to see early signs of funding levels stabilizing. Our business model remains resilient, and we are continuing to invest in scientific capabilities and important enterprise projects as industry fundamentals for pharma outsourcing remain positive for the medium-to-long term.”\n\n— Jonathan Hunt, CEO & Managing Director, Syngene\n\nCORPORATE HIGHLIGHTS\n\nBoard Announcements\n\nBiocon Biologics Limited\n\nNicholas Robert Haggar has been appointed as an Independent Director on the Board of Biocon Biologics Limited for a period of three years with effect from February 6, 2024.\n\nHe has over 30 years of experience in leading and building pharmaceutical and healthcare enterprises and has been successfully guiding innovation and increasing access to medicines with deep commitment to patients, compliance, quality and sustainability.

The subdued year-on-year performance was due to pricing pressure in the API business that impacted customer offtake, which was partially offset by sustained growth across most of the Generic Formulation products.\n\nThe Company received its first Generic Formulations approval in China for Mycophenolate Sodium (MPS), an immunosuppressant used to help prevent organ transplant rejection. This paves the way for the Company’s finished dosage formulations foray into China, a key strategic market.\n\nBiocon also received a tentative approval for Dasatinib tablets, for 20 mg, 50 mg, 70 mg, 80 mg, 100 mg, and 140 mg strengths, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recently. Dasatinib is indicated for use in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia in adults. It is also used to treat Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.\n\nTGA Australia completed an inspection of the Company’s API facility in Visakhapatnam with no critical observations. The API facility at Hyderabad also underwent a remote inspection by Cofepris, Mexico, with two observations, for which responses have been submitted.\n\nPost completion of process validation at the Company’s greenfield immunosuppressants facility in Visakhapatnam, the site obtained a Certification of Suitability (CEP) from the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM). The Company expects the site to be inspected and qualified by other regulatory authorities during the next fiscal, enabling commercialization of its products across geographies.\n\nProcess validation at the Company’s large volume peptides facility at Bengaluru was successfully completed during the quarter. At the Synthetic API facility in Hyderabad, process validation was initiated.\n\nBIOSIMILARS: Biocon Biologics Limited (BBL)\n\nQ3FY24 Revenue at Rs 2,483 Crore, up 65% (YoY) from Rs 1,507 Crore in Q3FY23.\n\nReduced the acquisition debt by USD 200 million.\n\nPreserved, consolidated and built business post successful integration.\n\nServed 5.5+ million patients (MAT December 2023) ##\n\n##12-month moving annual patient population (January 2023 to December 2023)\n\nBusiness Performance\n\nBiocon Biologics reported a YoY growth of 65% for Q3FY24 with revenue at Rs 2,483 crore, demonstrating its ability to maintain its growth momentum while completing the complex and accelerated integration of the acquired biosimilars business. In this quarter, Biocon Biologics successfully completed its transition to a fully integrated, ‘lab-to-market’ global biosimilars enterprise with a presence across 120+ countries.\n\nDuring this time of rapid operational transformation, the Company successfully maintained business continuity while seamlessly serving patients, partners, and customers worldwide and securing new customers and tenders in both Advanced and Emerging Markets.\n\nEBITDA for the quarter reported a growth of 98% at Rs 714 crore, representing an EBITDA margin of 29%.\n\nDuring the quarter, Net R&D investments stood at Rs 265 crore, representing 11% of Biocon Biologics’ revenue for the quarter, reflecting the advancement of our biosimilars pipeline.\n\nCore EBITDA at Rs 587 crore, with Core EBITDA margins at 28%, were impacted on account of a series of transition related expenses and one-off costs.\n\nBiocon Biologics prepaid ~USD 200 million towards reducing the acquisition-related debt during the quarter.\n\nAdvanced Markets\n\nNorth America@\n\nBiocon Biologics sharpened its focus on a self-led commercial model in North America, following the seamless integration of people and business operations.\n\nThe Company’s products maintained momentum and showed resiliency in a dynamic market in the immediate quarter post the integration of the acquired biosimilars business. It expanded market access across all therapeutic segments in the U.S., making strides in insulins and oncology portfolios and securing several immunology formulary wins.\n\nBiocon Biologics drove an uptick in sales of unbranded bGlargine with a closed-door pharmacy network even as unbranded bGlargine along with Semglee® held market share steady at ~12%.\n\nFulphila® (bPegfilgrastim) maintained ~18% market share in the U.S. The Company won three new contracts, including a sole-source contract from a large group purchasing organization (GPO) for the pre-filled syringe presentation of its bPegfilgrastim.

It pursued new growth avenues by winning several tenders for its products, including for the acquired business in territories like Tunisia, Libya and Ukraine, in addition to obtaining numerous approvals for key biosimilars across EMs.\n\nWith the launch of Abevmy® (bBevacizumab), Biocon Biologics has initiated its ‘direct to market’ journey in Brazil, which is the largest market for this molecule in LATAM. Innovator sales for Bevacizumab in Brazil are over USD 175 million^^^. The Company is seeing positive traction for Abevmy® despite the presence of multiple players in the market.\n\nExpanding Insulins Access\n\nBiocon Biologics is addressing the challenge of insulin inequity through its Market Access programs in several countries.
