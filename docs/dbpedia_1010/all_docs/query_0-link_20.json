Current state-of-the-art methods can yield models with high variance, rendering them unsuitable for a number of practical applications including QSAR. In this paper we describe and evaluate best practices which improve reliability and increase confidence in selected models. A key operational component of the proposed methods is cloud computing which enables routine use of previously infeasible approaches. We describe in detail an algorithm for repeated grid-search V-fold cross-validation for parameter tuning in classification and regression, and we define a repeated nested cross-validation algorithm for model assessment. As regards variable selection and parameter tuning we define two algorithms (repeated grid-search cross-validation and double cross-validation), and provide arguments for using the repeated grid-search in the general case. We show results of our algorithms on seven QSAR datasets. The variation of the prediction performance, which is the result of choosing different splits of the dataset in V-fold cross-validation, needs to be taken into account when selecting and assessing classification and regression models. We demonstrate the importance of repeating cross-validation when selecting an optimal model, as well as the importance of repeating nested cross-validation when assessing a prediction error.\n\nEmpirical Performance of Cross-Validation With Oracle Methods in a Genomics Context\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMartinez, Josue G.; Carroll, Raymond J.; MÃ¼ller, Samuel; Sampson, Joshua N.; Chatterjee, Nilanjan\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWhen employing model selection methods with oracle properties such as the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and the Adaptive Lasso, it is typical to estimate the smoothing parameter by m-fold cross-validation, for example, m = 10. In problems where the true regression function is sparse and the signals large, such cross-validation typically works well. However, in regression modeling of genomic studies involving Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP), the true regression functions, while thought to be sparse, do not have large signals. We demonstrate empirically that in such problems, the number of selected variables using SCAD and the Adaptive Lasso, with 10-fold cross-validation, is a random variable that has considerable and surprising variation. Similar remarks apply to non-oracle methods such as the Lasso. Our study strongly questions the suitability of performing only a single run of m-fold cross-validation with any oracle method, and not just the SCAD and Adaptive Lasso.

Supervised cross-validation, i.e., selection of test and train sets according to the known subtypes within a database has been successfully used earlier in conjunction with the SCOP database. Our goal was to extend this principle to other databases and to design standardized benchmark datasets for protein classification. Hierarchical classification trees of protein categories provide a simple and general framework for designing supervised cross-validation strategies for protein classification. Benchmark datasets can be designed at various levels of the concept hierarchy using a simple graph-theoretic distance. A combination of supervised and random sampling was selected to construct reduced size model datasets, suitable for algorithm comparison. Over 3000 new classification tasks were added to our recently established protein classification benchmark collection that currently includes protein sequence (including protein domains and entire proteins), protein structure and reading frame DNA sequence data. We carried out an extensive evaluation based on various machine-learning algorithms such as nearest neighbor, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, random forests and logistic regression, used in conjunction with comparison algorithms, BLAST, Smith-Waterman, Needleman-Wunsch, as well as 3D comparison methods DALI and PRIDE. The resulting datasets provide lower, and in our opinion more realistic estimates of the classifier performance than do random cross-validation schemes.

However, experimental assessment of such local friction is difficult because it does not manifest itself as an independent experimental observable. Herein, we demonstrate, using the miniprotein trp-cage as a testbed, that it is possible to selectively increase the local mass density in a protein and hence the magnitude of local friction, thus making its effect directly measurable via folding kinetic studies. Specifically, we show that when a helix cross-linker, m-xylene, is placed near the most congested region of the trp-cage it leads to a significant decrease in both the folding rate (by a factor of 3.8) and unfolding rate (by a factor of 2.5 at 35 Â°C) but has little effect on protein stability. Thus, these results, in conjunction with those obtained with another cross-linked trp-cage and two uncross-linked variants, demonstrate the feasibility of using a nonperturbing cross-linker to help quantify the effect of internal friction. In addition, we estimate that a m-xylene cross-linker could lead to an increase in the roughness of the folding energy landscape by as much as 0.4-1.0k(B)T.\n\nCo-Translational Folding Trajectory of the HemK Helical Domain.\n\nPubMed\n\nMercier, Evan; Rodnina, Marina V\n\n2018-06-26\n\nProtein folding begins co-translationally within the restricted space of the peptide exit tunnel of the ribosome. We have already shown that the N-terminal Î±-helical domain of the universally conserved N 5 -glutamine methyltransferase HemK is compacted within the exit tunnel and rearranges into the native fold upon emerging from the ribosome. However, the exact folding pathway of the domain remained unclear. Here we analyzed the rapid kinetics of translation and folding monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and photoinduced electron transfer using global fitting to a model for synthesis of the 112-amino acid HemK fragment. Our results suggest that the co-translational folding trajectory of HemK starts within the tunnel and passes through four kinetically distinct folding intermediates that may represent sequential docking of helices to a growing compact core. The kinetics of the process is defined entirely by translation. The results show how analysis of ensemble kinetic data can be used to dissect complex trajectories of rapid conformational rearrangements in multicomponent systems.\n\nAn adaptive bias - hybrid MD/kMC algorithm for protein folding and aggregation.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeter, Emanuel K; Shea, Joan-Emma\n\n2017-07-05\n\nIn this paper, we present a novel hybrid Molecular Dynamics/kinetic Monte Carlo (MD/kMC) algorithm and apply it to protein folding and aggregation in explicit solvent. The new algorithm uses a dynamical definition of biases throughout the MD component of the simulation, normalized in relation to the unbiased forces. The algorithm guarantees sampling of the underlying ensemble in dependency of one average linear coupling factor ãÎ±ã Ï . We test the validity of the kinetics in simulations of dialanine and compare dihedral transition kinetics with long-time MD-simulations. We find that for low ãÎ±ã Ï values, kinetics are in good quantitative agreement. In folding simulations of TrpCage and TrpZip4 in explicit solvent, we also find good quantitative agreement with experimental results and prior MD/kMC simulations. Finally, we apply our algorithm to study growth of the Alzheimer Amyloid AÎ² 16-22 fibril by monomer addition. We observe two possible binding modes, one at the extremity of the fibril (elongation) and one on the surface of the fibril (lateral growth), on timescales ranging from ns to 8 Î¼s.\n\nA hybrid MD-kMC algorithm for folding proteins in explicit solvent.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeter, Emanuel Karl; Shea, Joan-Emma\n\n2014-04-14\n\nWe present a novel hybrid MD-kMC algorithm that is capable of efficiently folding proteins in explicit solvent. We apply this algorithm to the folding of a small protein, Trp-Cage. Different kMC move sets that capture different possible rate limiting steps are implemented. The first uses secondary structure formation as a relevant rate event (a combination of dihedral rotations and hydrogen-bonding formation and breakage). The second uses tertiary structure formation events through formation of contacts via translational moves. Both methods fold the protein, but via different mechanisms and with different folding kinetics. The first method leads to folding via a structured helical state, with kinetics fit by a single exponential. The second method leads to folding via a collapsed loop, with kinetics poorly fit by single or double exponentials. In both cases, folding times are faster than experimentally reported values, The secondary and tertiary move sets are integrated in a third MD-kMC implementation, which now leads to folding of the protein via both pathways, with single and double-exponential fits to the rates, and to folding rates in good agreement with experimental values. The competition between secondary and tertiary structure leads to a longer search for the helix-rich intermediate in the case of the first pathway, and to the emergence of a kinetically trapped long-lived molten-globule collapsed state in the case of the second pathway. The algorithm presented not only captures experimentally observed folding intermediates and kinetics, but yields insights into the relative roles of local and global interactions in determining folding mechanisms and rates.\n\nPartial wave analysis for folded differential cross sections\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMachacek, J. R.; McEachran, R. P.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe value of modified effective range theory (MERT) and the connection between differential cross sections and phase shifts in low-energy electron scattering has long been recognized. Recent experimental techniques involving magnetically confined beams have introduced the concept of folded differential cross sections (FDCS) where the forward (Î¸ â¤ Ï/2) and backward scattered (Î¸ â¥ Ï/2) projectiles are unresolved, that is the value measured at the angle Î¸ is the sum of the signal for particles scattered into the angles Î¸ and Ï - Î¸. We have developed an alternative approach to MERT in order to analyse low-energy folded differential cross sections for positrons and electrons. This results in a simplified expression for the FDCS when it is expressed in terms of partial waves and thereby enables one to extract the first few phase shifts from a fit to an experimental FDCS at low energies. Thus, this method predicts forward and backward angle scattering (0 to Ï) using only experimental FDCS data and can be used to determine the total elastic cross section solely from experimental results at low-energy, which are limited in angular range.\n\nU-folds as K3 fibrations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBraun, Andreas P.; Fucito, Francesco; Morales, Jose Francisco\n\n2013-10-01\n\nWe study four-dimensional flux vacua describing intrinsic non- perturbative systems of 3 and 7 branes in type IIB string theory. The solutions are described as compactifications of a G(ravity) theory on a Calabi Yau threefold which consists of a fibration of an auxiliary K3 surface over an S 2 base. In the spirit of F-theory, the complex structure of the K3 surface varying over the base codifies the details of the fluxes, the dilaton and the warp factors in type IIB string theory. We discuss in detail some simple examples of geometric and non-geometric solutions where the precise flux/geometry dictionary can be explicitly worked out. In particular, we describe non-geometric T-fold solutions exhibiting non-trivial T-duality monodromies exchanging 3- and 7-branes.\n\nThe force-dependent mechanism of DnaK-mediated mechanical folding\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPerales-Calvo, Judit; Giganti, David; Stirnemann, Guillaume; Garcia-Manyes, Sergi\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIt is well established that chaperones modulate the protein folding free-energy landscape. However, the molecular determinants underlying chaperone-mediated mechanical folding remain largely elusive, primarily because the force-extended unfolded conformation fundamentally differs from that characterized in biochemistry experiments. We use single-molecule force-clamp spectroscopy, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, to study the effect that the Hsp70 system has on the mechanical folding of three mechanically stiff model proteins. Our results demonstrate that, when working independently, DnaJ (Hsp40) and DnaK (Hsp70) work as holdases, blocking refolding by binding to distinct substrate conformations. Whereas DnaK binds to molten globuleâlike forms, DnaJ recognizes a cryptic sequence in the extended state in an unanticipated force-dependent manner. By contrast, the synergetic coupling of the Hsp70 system exhibits a marked foldase behavior. Our results offer unprecedented molecular and kinetic insights into the mechanisms by which mechanical force finely regulates chaperone binding, directly affecting protein elasticity.

Yet even with its widespread acceptance, there are still questions about its validity and adequacy, about the proper procedure for calculating the potential scattering cross section, {sigma}{sub p}, for uranium and plutonium, and about the concept of resonance self shielding and its impact on cross sections. This paper attempts to address these questions. It provides a brief background on the Hansen-Roach cross sections. Next is presented a review of resonances in crossmoreÂ Â» sections, self shielding of these resonances, and the use of {sigma}{sub p} to characterize resonance self shielding. Three prescriptions for calculating {sigma}{sub p} are given. Finally, results of several calculations of k{sub eff} on low-enriched uranium systems are provided to confirm the validity of the Hansen-Roach cross sections when applied to such systems.Â«Â less\n\nA new fold-cross metal mesh filter for suppressing side lobe leakage in terahertz region\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLu, Changgui; Qi, Zhengqing; Guo, Wengao; Cui, Yiping\n\n2018-04-01\n\nIn this paper we propose a new type of fold-cross metal mesh band pass filter, which keeps diffraction side lobe far away from the main transmission peak and shows much better side lobe suppression. Both experimental and theoretical studies are made to analyze the mechanism of side lobe. Compared to the traditional cross filter, the fold-cross filter has a much lower side lobe with almost the same central frequency, bandwidth and highest transmission about 98%. Using the photolithography and electroplating techniques, we experimentally extend the distance between the main peak and diffraction side lobe to larger than 1 THz for the fold-cross filter, which is two times larger than the cross filter while maintaining the main peak transmissions of 89% at 1.25 THz for the two structures. This type of single layer substrate-free fold-cross metal structure shows better design flexibility and structure reliability with the introduction of fold arms for metal mesh band pass filters.\n\nCross Validation Through Two-Dimensional Solution Surface for Cost-Sensitive SVM.\n\nPubMed\n\nGu, Bin; Sheng, Victor S; Tay, Keng Yeow; Romano, Walter; Li, Shuo\n\n2017-06-01\n\nModel selection plays an important role in cost-sensitive SVM (CS-SVM). It has been proven that the global minimum cross validation (CV) error can be efficiently computed based on the solution path for one parameter learning problems. However, it is a challenge to obtain the global minimum CV error for CS-SVM based on one-dimensional solution path and traditional grid search, because CS-SVM is with two regularization parameters. In this paper, we propose a solution and error surfaces based CV approach (CV-SES). More specifically, we first compute a two-dimensional solution surface for CS-SVM based on a bi-parameter space partition algorithm, which can fit solutions of CS-SVM for all values of both regularization parameters. Then, we compute a two-dimensional validation error surface for each CV fold, which can fit validation errors of CS-SVM for all values of both regularization parameters. Finally, we obtain the CV error surface by superposing K validation error surfaces, which can find the global minimum CV error of CS-SVM. Experiments are conducted on seven datasets for cost sensitive learning and on four datasets for imbalanced learning. Experimental results not only show that our proposed CV-SES has a better generalization ability than CS-SVM with various hybrids between grid search and solution path methods, and than recent proposed cost-sensitive hinge loss SVM with three-dimensional grid search, but also show that CV-SES uses less running time.\n\nCommunication: nanosecond folding dynamics of an alpha helix: time-dependent 2D-IR cross peaks observed using polarization-sensitive dispersed pump-probe spectroscopy.\n\nPubMed\n\nPanman, Matthijs R; van Dijk, Chris N; Meuzelaar, Heleen; Woutersen, S\n\n2015-01-28\n\nWe present a simple method to measure the dynamics of cross peaks in time-resolved two-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy. By combining suitably weighted dispersed pump-probe spectra, we eliminate the diagonal contribution to the 2D-IR response, so that the dispersed pump-probe signal contains the projection of only the cross peaks onto one of the axes of the 2D-IR spectrum. We apply the method to investigate the folding dynamics of an alpha-helical peptide in a temperature-jump experiment and find characteristic folding and unfolding time constants of 260 Â± 30 and 580 Â± 70 ns at 298 K.\n\nApproximate l-fold cross-validation with Least Squares SVM and Kernel Ridge Regression\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nEdwards, Richard E; Zhang, Hao; Parker, Lynne Edwards\n\n2013-01-01\n\nKernel methods have difficulties scaling to large modern data sets. The scalability issues are based on computational and memory requirements for working with a large matrix. These requirements have been addressed over the years by using low-rank kernel approximations or by improving the solvers scalability. However, Least Squares Support VectorMachines (LS-SVM), a popular SVM variant, and Kernel Ridge Regression still have several scalability issues. In particular, the O(n^3) computational complexity for solving a single model, and the overall computational complexity associated with tuning hyperparameters are still major problems. We address these problems by introducing an O(n log n) approximate l-foldmoreÂ Â» cross-validation method that uses a multi-level circulant matrix to approximate the kernel. In addition, we prove our algorithm s computational complexity and present empirical runtimes on data sets with approximately 1 million data points. We also validate our approximate method s effectiveness at selecting hyperparameters on real world and standard benchmark data sets. Lastly, we provide experimental results on using a multi-level circulant kernel approximation to solve LS-SVM problems with hyperparameters selected using our method.Â«Â less\n\nDesign and 4D Printing of Cross-Folded Origami Structures: A Preliminary Investigation.\n\nPubMed\n\nTeoh, Joanne Ee Mei; An, Jia; Feng, Xiaofan; Zhao, Yue; Chua, Chee Kai; Liu, Yong\n\n2018-03-03\n\nIn 4D printing research, different types of complex structure folding and unfolding have been investigated. However, research on cross-folding of origami structures (defined as a folding structure with at least two overlapping folds) has not been reported. This research focuses on the investigation of cross-folding structures using multi-material components along different axes and different horizontal hinge thickness with single homogeneous material. Tensile tests were conducted to determine the impact of multi-material components and horizontal hinge thickness. In the case of multi-material structures, the hybrid material composition has a significant impact on the overall maximum strain and Young's modulus properties. In the case of single material structures, the shape recovery speed is inversely proportional to the horizontal hinge thickness, while the flexural or bending strength is proportional to the horizontal hinge thickness. A hinge with a thickness of 0.5 mm could be folded three times prior to fracture whilst a hinge with a thickness of 0.3 mm could be folded only once prior to fracture. A hinge with a thickness of 0.1 mm could not even be folded without cracking. The introduction of a physical hole in the center of the folding/unfolding line provided stress relief and prevented fracture. A complex flower petal shape was used to successfully demonstrate the implementation of overlapping and non-overlapping folding lines using both single material segments and multi-material segments.

The CAIT has been cross-culturally adapted into other languages for use in non-English speaking populations. However, there are no valid questionnaires to assess CAI in individuals who speak Korean. The purpose of this study was to translate, cross-culturally adapt, and validate the CAIT, for use in a Korean-speaking population with CAI. Cross-cultural reliability study. The CAIT was cross-culturally adapted into Korean according to accepted guidelines and renamed the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool-Korean (CAIT-K). Twenty-three participants (12 males, 11 females) who were bilingual in English and Korean were recruited and completed the original and adapted versions to assess agreement between versions. An additional 168 national level Korean athletes (106 male, 62 females; ageâ=â20.3âÂ±â1.1 yrs), who participated inââ¥â90 minutes of physical activity per week, completed the final version of the CAIT-K twice within 14 days. Their completed questionnaires were assessed for internal consistency, test-retest reliability, criterion validity, and construct validity. For bilingual participants, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC2,1) between the CAIT and the CAIT-K for test-retest reliability were 0.95 (SEM=1.83) and 0.96 (SEM=1.50) in right and left limbs, respectively. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients were 0.92 and 0.90 for the CAIT-K in right and left limbs, respectively. For native Korean speakers, the CAIT-K had high internal consistency (Cronbach's Î±=0.89) and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC2,1â=â0.94, SEM=1.72), correlation with the physical component score (rho=0.70, pâ=â0.001) of the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin score was 0.87.

The objective of this study was to estimate marker effects to derive prediction equations for direct genomic values for 16 routinely recorded traits of American Angus beef cattle and quantify corresponding accuracies of prediction. Deregressed estimated breeding values were used as observations in a weighted analysis to derive direct genomic values for 3570 sires genotyped using the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip. These bulls were clustered into five groups using K-means clustering on pedigree estimates of additive genetic relationships between animals, with the aim of increasing within-group and decreasing between-group relationships. All five combinations of four groups were used for model training, with cross-validation performed in the group not used in training. Bivariate animal models were used for each trait to estimate the genetic correlation between deregressed estimated breeding values and direct genomic values. Accuracies of direct genomic values ranged from 0.22 to 0.69 for the studied traits, with an average of 0.44. Predictions were more accurate when animals within the validation group were more closely related to animals in the training set. When training and validation sets were formed by random allocation, the accuracies of direct genomic values ranged from 0.38 to 0.85, with an average of 0.65, reflecting the greater relationship between animals in training and validation. The accuracies of direct genomic values obtained from training on older animals and validating in younger animals were intermediate to the accuracies obtained from K-means clustering and random clustering for most traits. The genetic correlation between deregressed estimated breeding values and direct genomic values ranged from 0.15 to 0.80 for the traits studied.

Conclusions These results suggest that genomic estimates of genetic merit can be\n\nCriterion for evaluating the predictive ability of nonlinear regression models without cross-validation.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaneko, Hiromasa; Funatsu, Kimito\n\n2013-09-23\n\nWe propose predictive performance criteria for nonlinear regression models without cross-validation. The proposed criteria are the determination coefficient and the root-mean-square error for the midpoints between k-nearest-neighbor data points. These criteria can be used to evaluate predictive ability after the regression models are updated, whereas cross-validation cannot be performed in such a situation. The proposed method is effective and helpful in handling big data when cross-validation cannot be applied. By analyzing data from numerical simulations and quantitative structural relationships, we confirm that the proposed criteria enable the predictive ability of the nonlinear regression models to be appropriately quantified.\n\nCross-Cultural Validation of the Korean Version of the Chalder Fatigue Scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nHa, Hyeju; Jeong, Donghee; Hahm, Bong-Jin; Shim, Eun-Jung\n\n2018-06-01\n\nUniversity students are vulnerable to fatigue. If not adequately dealt with, fatigue might develop into various health problems and negatively affect quality of life (QOL). The present study examined psychometric properties of the Korean version of the Chalder Fatigue Scale (K-CFQ) in university students. Data were obtained from two samples of undergraduate students in Korea. The first dataset (Nâ=â557) was collected in a cross-sectional survey in 2015 and the second dataset (Nâ=â338) from a longitudinal survey with three time points over a semester period in 2016. Participants completed measures of fatigue, QOL, depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. Three-factor model (physical fatigue, low energy, and mental fatigue) rather than the original two-factor model (physical and mental fatigue) provided a better goodness of fit indices to the data. Internal consistency of the K-CFQ was satisfactory, with Cronbach's Î± value of 0.88 for the total scale and those of subscales ranging from 0.73 to 0.87. Its convergent validity was supported by its significant association with anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and QOL. Significant association between T1 K-CFQ with physical QOL at T2 and T3 supported its predictive validity. Its known-group validity was proven with higher K-CFQ scores observed in the participants with depression and those with poor sleep quality. Current results suggest that K-CFQ is a valid and reliable measure of fatigue, and a better model fit of the three-factor structure of the K-CFQ implies potential cross-cultural differences in the dimensionality of fatigue.\n\nTranslation, Cross-cultural Adaptation and Psychometric Validation of the Korean-Language Cardiac Rehabilitation Barriers Scale (CRBS-K).\n\nPubMed\n\nBaek, Sora; Park, Hee-Won; Lee, Yookyung; Grace, Sherry L; Kim, Won-Seok\n\n2017-10-01\n\nTo perform a translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Barriers Scale (CRBS) for use in Korea, followed by psychometric validation. The CRBS was developed to assess patients' perception of the degree to which patient, provider and health system-level barriers affect their cardiac rehabilitation (CR) participation. The CRBS consists of 21 items (barriers to adherence) rated on a 5-point Likert scale. The first phase was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the CRBS to the Korean language. After back-translation, both versions were reviewed by a committee. The face validity was assessed in a sample of Korean patients (n=53) with history of acute myocardial infarction that did not participate in CR through semi-structured interviews. The second phase was to assess the construct and criterion validity of the Korean translation as well as internal reliability, through administration of the translated version in 104 patients, principle component analysis with varimax rotation and cross-referencing against CR use, respectively. The length, readability, and clarity of the questionnaire were rated well, demonstrating face validity. Analysis revealed a six-factor solution, demonstrating construct validity. Cronbach's alpha was greater than 0.65. Barriers rated highest included not knowing about CR and not being contacted by a program. The mean CRBS score was significantly higher among non-attendees (2.71Â±0.26) than CR attendees (2.51Â±0.18) (p<0.01). The Korean version of CRBS has demonstrated face, content and criterion validity, suggesting it may be useful for assessing barriers to CR utilization in Korea.\n\nTranslation, Cross-cultural Adaptation and Psychometric Validation of the Korean-Language Cardiac Rehabilitation Barriers Scale (CRBS-K)\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjective To perform a translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Barriers Scale (CRBS) for use in Korea, followed by psychometric validation.

Identifying common motifs between coregulated transcripts may therefore yield significant insight into their binding partners and mechanism of regulation. However, as most methods for clustering structures are based on folding individual sequences or doing many pairwise alignments, this results in a tradeoff between speed and accuracy that can be problematic for large-scale data sets. Here we describe a novel method for comparing and characterizing RNA secondary structures that does not require folding or pairwise alignment of the input sequences. Our method uses the idea of constructing a distance function between two objects by their respective distances to a collection of empirical examples or models, which in our case consists of 1973 Rfam family covariance models. Using this as a basis for measuring structural similarity, we developed a clustering pipeline called NoFold to automatically identify and annotate structure motifs within large sequence data sets. We demonstrate that NoFold can simultaneously identify multiple structure motifs with an average sensitivity of 0.80 and precision of 0.98 and generally exceeds the performance of existing methods. We also perform a cross-validation analysis of the entire set of Rfam families, achieving an average sensitivity of 0.57. We apply NoFold to identify motifs enriched in dendritically localized transcripts and report 213 enriched motifs, including both known and novel structures.

J. 97 12-19). In contrast to the direct simulation approach, in which the protein undergoing folding is simulated along with crowders, the postprocessing method requires only the folding simulation without crowders. The influence of the crowders is then obtained by taking conformations from the crowder-free simulation and calculating the free energies of transferring to the crowders. This postprocessing yields the folding free energy surface of the protein under crowding. Here the postprocessing results for the folding of three small proteins under ârepulsiveâ crowding are validated by those obtained previously by the direct simulation approach (Mittal and Best 2010 Biophys. J. 98 315-20). This validation confirms the accuracy of the postprocessing approach and highlights its distinct advantages in modeling biochemical processes under cell-like crowded conditions, such as enabling an atomistic representation of the test proteins.\n\nTranspressional folding and associated cross-fold jointing controlling the geometry of post-orogenic vein-type W-Sn mineralization: examples from Minas da Panasqueira, Portugal\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJacques, Dominique; Vieira, Romeu; Muchez, Philippe; Sintubin, Manuel\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe world-class W-Sn Panasqueira deposit consists of an extensive, subhorizontal vein swarm, peripheral to a late-orogenic greisen cupola. The vein swarm consists of hundreds of co-planar quartz veins that are overlapping and connected laterally over large distances. Various segmentation structures, a local zigzag geometry, and the occurrence of straight propagation paths indicate that they exploited a regional joint system. A detailed orientation analysis of the systematic joints reveals a geometrical relationship with the subvertical F2 fold generation, reflecting late-Variscan transpression. The joints are consistently orthogonal to the steeply plunging S0-S2 intersection lineation, both on the regional and the outcrop scale, and are thus defined as cross-fold or ac-joints. The joint system developed during the waning stages of the Variscan orogeny, when already uplifted to an upper-crustal level. Veining reactivated these cross-fold joints under the conditions of hydraulic overpressures and low differential stress. The consistent subperpendicular orientation of the veins relative to the non-cylindrical F2 hinge lines, also when having an inclined attitude, demonstrates that veining did not occur during far-field horizontal compression. Vein orientation is determined by local stress states variable on a meter-scale but with the minimum principal stress consistently subparallel to fold hinge lines. The conspicuous subhorizontal attitude of the Panasqueira vein swarm is thus dictated by the geometry of late-orogenic folds, which developed synchronous with oroclinal buckling of the Ibero-Armorican arc.\n\nTest-retest reliability and cross validation of the functioning everyday with a wheelchair instrument.\n\nPubMed\n\nMills, Tamara L; Holm, Margo B; Schmeler, Mark\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to establish the test-retest reliability and content validity of an outcomes tool designed to measure the effectiveness of seating-mobility interventions on the functional performance of individuals who use wheelchairs or scooters as their primary seating-mobility device. The instrument, Functioning Everyday With a Wheelchair (FEW), is a questionnaire designed to measure perceived user function related to wheelchair/scooter use. Using consumer-generated items, FEW Beta Version 1.0 was developed and test-retest reliability was established. Cross-validation of FEW Beta Version 1.0 was then carried out with five samples of seating-mobility users to establish content validity. Based on the content validity study, FEW Version 2.0 was developed and administered to seating-mobility consumers to examine its test-retest reliability. FEW Beta Version 1.0 yielded an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) Model (3,k) of .92, p < .001, and the content validity results revealed that FEW Beta Version 1.0 captured 55% of seating-mobility goals reported by consumers across five samples. FEW Version 2.0 yielded ICC(3,k) = .86, p < .001, and captured 98.5% of consumers' seating-mobility goals. The cross-validation study identified new categories of seating-mobility goals for inclusion in FEW Version 2.0, and the content validity of FEW Version 2.0 was confirmed. FEW Beta Version 1.0 and FEW Version 2.0 were highly stable in their measurement of participants' seating-mobility goals over a 1-week interval.\n\nAromatic Cluster Sensor of Protein Folding: Near-UV Electronic Circular Dichroism Bands Assigned to Fold Compactness.\n\nPubMed\n\nFarkas, Viktor; JÃ¡kli, Imre; TÃ³th, GÃ¡bor K; Perczel, AndrÃ¡s\n\n2016-09-19\n\nBoth far- and near-UV electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra have bands sensitive to thermal unfolding of Trp and Tyr residues containing proteins. Beside spectral changes at 222â nm reporting secondary structural variations (far-UV range), L b bands (near-UV range) are applicable as 3D-fold sensors of protein's core structure. In this study we show that both L b (Tyr) and L b (Trp) ECD bands could be used as sensors of fold compactness. ECD is a relative method and thus requires NMR referencing and cross-validation, also provided here. The ensemble of 204 ECD spectra of Trp-cage miniproteins is analysed as a training set for \"calibrating\" TrpâTyr folded systems of known NMR structure. While in the far-UV ECD spectra changes are linear as a function of the temperature, near-UV ECD data indicate a non-linear and thus, cooperative unfolding mechanism of these proteins. Ensemble of ECD spectra deconvoluted gives both conformational weights and insight to a protein foldingâunfolding mechanism. We found that the L b 293 band is reporting on the 3D-structure compactness. In addition, the pure near-UV ECD spectrum of the unfolded state is described here for the first time. Thus, ECD folding information now validated can be applied with confidence in a large thermal window (5â¤Tâ¤85âÂ°C) compared to NMR for studying the unfolding of TrpâTyr residue pairs. In conclusion, folding propensities of important proteins (RNA polymerase II, ubiquitin protein ligase, tryptase-inhibitor etc.) can now be analysed with higher confidence.

Typically, a rectangular film folds along its short axis when forming a tube; folding along the long axis has been seen only in rare instances when the film is constrained. Here, we report a case where the same free-swelling gel film folds along either its long or short axis depending on the concentration of a solute. Our gels are sandwiches (bilayers) of two layers: a passive layer of cross-linked N,N'-dimethylyacrylamide (DMAA) and an active layer of cross-linked DMAA that also contains chains of the biopolymer alginate. Multivalent cations like Ca2+ and Cu2+ induce these bilayer gels to fold into tubes. The folding occurs instantly when a flat film of the gel is introduced into a solution of these cations. The likely cause for folding is that the active layer stiffens and shrinks (because the alginate chains in it get cross-linked by the cations) whereas the passive layer is unaffected. The resulting mismatch in swelling degree between the two layers creates internal stresses that drive folding. Cations that are incapable of cross-linking alginate, such as Na+ and Mg2+, do not induce gel folding. Moreover, the striking aspect is the direction of folding. When the Ca2+ concentration is high (100 mM or higher), the gels fold along their long axis, whereas when the Ca2+ concentration is low (40 to 80 mM), the gels fold along their short axis. We hypothesize that the folding axis is dictated by the inhomogeneous nature of alginate-cation cross-linking, i.e., that the edges get cross-linked before the faces of the gel. At high Ca2+ concentration, the stiffer edges constrain the folding; in turn, the gel folds such that the longer edges are deformed less, which explains the folding along the long axis. At low Ca2+ concentration, the edges and the faces of the gel are more similar in their degree of cross-linking; therefore, the gel folds along its short axis.

Some of the examined cross section models are available in general purpose Monte Carlo systems, while others have been implemented and subjected to validation tests for the first time to estimate whether they could improve the accuracy of particle transport codes. The validation process identifies Scofield's 1973 non-relativistic calculations, tabulated in the Evaluated Photon Data Library (EPDL), as the one best reproducing experimental measurements of total cross sections. Specialized total cross section models, some of which derive from more recent calculations, do not provide significant improvements. Scofield's non-relativistic calculations are not surpassed regarding the compatibility with experiment of K and L shell photoionization cross sections either, although in a few test cases Ebel's parameterization produces more accurate results close to absorption edges. Modifications to Biggs and Lighthill's parameterization implemented in Geant4 significantly reduce the accuracy of total cross sections at low energies with respect to its original formulation. The scarcity of suitable experimental data hinders a similar extensive analysis for the simulation of the photoelectron angular distribution, which is limited to a qualitative appraisal.\n\nCross-Validation of the Africentrism Scale.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKwate, Naa Oyo A.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nCross-validated the Africentrism Scale, investigating the relationship between Africentrism and demographic variables in a diverse sample of individuals of African descent.

Cross validation is a technique to avoid overfitting resulting from overly complex BNs. Overfitting reduces predictive skill. Cross-validation for BNs is known but rarely implemented due partly to a lack of software tools designed to work with available BN packages. CVNetica is open-source, written in Python, and extends the Netica software package to perform cross-validation and read, rebuild, and learn BNs from data. Insights gained from cross-validation and implications on prediction versus description are illustrated with: a data-driven oceanographic application; and a model-emulation application. These examples show that overfitting occurs when BNs become more complex than allowed by supporting data and overfitting incurs computational costs as well as causing a reduction in prediction skill. CVNetica evaluates overfitting using several complexity metrics (we used level of discretization) and its impact on performance metrics (we used skill).\n\nDynamics of one-state downhill protein folding.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Peng; Oliva, Fabiana Y; Naganathan, Athi N; MuÃ±oz, Victor\n\n2009-01-06\n\nThe small helical protein BBL has been shown to fold and unfold in the absence of a free energy barrier according to a battery of quantitative criteria in equilibrium experiments, including probe-dependent equilibrium unfolding, complex coupling between denaturing agents, characteristic DSC thermogram, gradual melting of secondary structure, and heterogeneous atom-by-atom unfolding behaviors spanning the entire unfolding process. Here, we present the results of nanosecond T-jump experiments probing backbone structure by IR and end-to-end distance by FRET. The folding dynamics observed with these two probes are both exponential with common relaxation times but have large differences in amplitude following their probe-dependent equilibrium unfolding. The quantitative analysis of amplitude and relaxation time data for both probes shows that BBL folding dynamics are fully consistent with the one-state folding scenario and incompatible with alternative models involving one or several barrier crossing events. At 333 K, the relaxation time for BBL is 1.3 micros, in agreement with previous folding speed limit estimates. However, late folding events at room temperature are an order of magnitude slower (20 micros), indicating a relatively rough underlying energy landscape. Our results in BBL expose the dynamic features of one-state folding and chart the intrinsic time-scales for conformational motions along the folding process. Interestingly, the simple self-averaging folding dynamics of BBL are the exact dynamic properties required in molecular rheostats, thus supporting a biological role for one-state folding.\n\nValidity Evidence in Scale Development: The Application of Cross Validation and Classification-Sequencing Validation\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAcar, TuÂ¨lin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn literature, it has been observed that many enhanced criteria are limited by factor analysis techniques.

[Subjects and Methods] One hundred and thirty eight community-dwelling elderlies, 32 males and 106 female, participated in the study. All participants were asked to fill out a fifty-one item questionnaire measuring perceived difficulty in the activities of daily living (ADL) for the elderly. One-parameter model of item response theory (Rasch analysis) was applied to determine the construct validity and to inspect item-level psychometric properties of 51 ADL items of the K-PAM. [Results] Person separation reliability (analogous to Cronbach's alpha) for internal consistency was ranging 0.93 to 0.94. A total of 16 items was misfit to the Rasch model. After misfit item deletion, 35 ADL items of the K-PAM were placed in an empirically meaningful hierarchy from easy to hard. The item-person map analysis delineated that the item difficulty was well matched for the elderlies with moderate and low ability except for high ceilings. [Conclusion] Cross-cultural adapted K-PAM was shown to be sufficient for establishing construct validity and stable psychometric properties confirmed by person separation reliability and fit statistics.\n\nReplica exchange molecular dynamics simulation of structure variation from Î±/4Î²-fold to 3Î±-fold protein.\n\nPubMed\n\nLazim, Raudah; Mei, Ye; Zhang, Dawei\n\n2012-03-01\n\nReplica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulation provides an efficient conformational sampling tool for the study of protein folding. In this study, we explore the mechanism directing the structure variation from Î±/4Î²-fold protein to 3Î±-fold protein after mutation by conducting REMD simulation on 42 replicas with temperatures ranging from 270 K to 710 K. The simulation began from a protein possessing the primary structure of GA88 but the tertiary structure of GB88, two G proteins with \"high sequence identity.\" Albeit the large CÎ±-root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the folded protein (4.34 Ã at 270 K and 4.75 Ã at 304 K), a variation in tertiary structure was observed. Together with the analysis of secondary structure assignment, cluster analysis and principal component, it provides insights to the folding and unfolding pathway of 3Î±-fold protein and Î±/4Î²-fold protein respectively paving the way toward the understanding of the ongoings during conformational variation.\n\nCross-validation to select Bayesian hierarchical models in phylogenetics.\n\nPubMed\n\nDuchÃªne, SebastiÃ¡n; DuchÃªne, David A; Di Giallonardo, Francesca; Eden, John-Sebastian; Geoghegan, Jemma L; Holt, Kathryn E; Ho, Simon Y W; Holmes, Edward C\n\n2016-05-26\n\nRecent developments in Bayesian phylogenetic models have increased the range of inferences that can be drawn from molecular sequence data. Accordingly, model selection has become an important component of phylogenetic analysis. Methods of model selection generally consider the likelihood of the data under the model in question. In the context of Bayesian phylogenetics, the most common approach involves estimating the marginal likelihood, which is typically done by integrating the likelihood across model parameters, weighted by the prior. Although this method is accurate, it is sensitive to the presence of improper priors. We explored an alternative approach based on cross-validation that is widely used in evolutionary analysis. This involves comparing models according to their predictive performance. We analysed simulated data and a range of viral and bacterial data sets using a cross-validation approach to compare a variety of molecular clock and demographic models. Our results show that cross-validation can be effective in distinguishing between strict- and relaxed-clock models and in identifying demographic models that allow growth in population size over time. In most of our empirical data analyses, the model selected using cross-validation was able to match that selected using marginal-likelihood estimation. The accuracy of cross-validation appears to improve with longer sequence data, particularly when distinguishing between relaxed-clock models. Cross-validation is a useful method for Bayesian phylogenetic model selection. This method can be readily implemented even when considering complex models where selecting an appropriate prior for all parameters may be difficult.\n\nAbsolute absorption cross sections of ozone at 300 K, 228 K and 195 K in the wavelength region 185-240 nm\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nYoshino, K.; Parkinson, W. H.; Freeman, D. E.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nAn account is given of progress of work on absorption cross section measurements of ozone at 300 K, 228 K and 195 K in the wavelength region 185-240 nm. In this wavelength region, the penetration of solar radiation into the Earth's atmosphere is controlled by O2 and O3. The transmitted radiation is available to dissociate trace species such as halocarbons and nitrous oxide. We have recently measured absolute absorption cross sections of O3 in the wavelength region 240-350 nm (Freeman et al., 1985; Yoshino et al., 1988). We apply these proven techniques to the determination of the absorption cross section of O3 at 300 K, 228 K and 195 K throughout the wavelength region 185-240 nm. A paper titled 'Absolute Absorption Cross Section Measurements of Ozone in the Wavelength Region 185-254 nm and the Temperature Dependence' has been submitted for publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research.\n\nPolymer Uncrossing and Knotting in Protein Folding, and Their Role in Minimal Folding Pathways\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMohazab, Ali R.; Plotkin, Steven S.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe introduce a method for calculating the extent to which chain non-crossing is important in the most efficient, optimal trajectories or pathways for a protein to fold. This involves recording all unphysical crossing events of a ghost chain, and calculating the minimal uncrossing cost that would have been required to avoid such events. A depth-first tree search algorithm is applied to find minimal transformations to fold , , , and knotted proteins. In all cases, the extra uncrossing/non-crossing distance is a small fraction of the total distance travelled by a ghost chain. Different structural classes may be distinguished by the amount of extra uncrossing distance, and the effectiveness of such discrimination is compared with other order parameters. It was seen that non-crossing distance over chain length provided the best discrimination between structural and kinetic classes. The scaling of non-crossing distance with chain length implies an inevitable crossover to entanglement-dominated folding mechanisms for sufficiently long chains. We further quantify the minimal folding pathways by collecting the sequence of uncrossing moves, which generally involve leg, loop, and elbow-like uncrossing moves, and rendering the collection of these moves over the unfolded ensemble as a multiple-transformation âalignmentâ. The consensus minimal pathway is constructed and shown schematically for representative cases of an , , and knotted protein. An overlap parameter is defined between pathways; we find that proteins have minimal overlap indicating diverse folding pathways, knotted proteins are highly constrained to follow a dominant pathway, and proteins are somewhere in between. Thus we have shown how topological chain constraints can induce dominant pathway mechanisms in protein folding.

M.; Cogley, Jeremy; Morris, Tony; Mosek, Erez; Watt, Anthony P.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbsorption has been identified as readiness for experiences of deep involvement in the task. Conceptually, absorption is a key psychological construct, incorporating experiential, cognitive, and motivational components. Although, no operationalization of the construct has been provided to facilitate research in this area, the purpose of this research was the development and examination of the psychometric properties of a sport-specific measure of absorption that evolved from the use of the modified Tellegen Absorption Scale (MODTAS; Jamieson, 2005) in mainstream psychology. The study aimed to provide evidence of the psychometric properties, reliability, and validity of the Measure of Absorption in Sport Contexts (MASCs). The psychometric examination included a calibration sample from Scotland and a cross-validation sample from Australia using a cross-sectional design. The item pool was developed based on existing items from the modified Tellegen Absorption Scale (Jamieson, 2005). The MODTAS items were reworded and translated into a sport context. The Scottish sample consisted of 292 participants and the Australian sample of 314 participants. Congeneric model testing and confirmatory factor analysis for both samples and multi-group invariance testing across samples was used. In the cross-validation sample the MASC subscales showed acceptable internal consistency and construct reliability (â¥0.70). Excellent fit indices were found for the final 18-item, six-factor measure in the cross-validation sample, Ï(120)2 = 197.486, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.957; TLI = 0.945; RMSEA = 0.045; SRMR = 0.044. Multi-group invariance testing revealed no differences in item meaning, except for two items. The MASC and the Dispositional Flow Scale-2 showed moderate-to-strong positive correlations in both samples, r = 0.38, p < 0.001 and r = 0.42, p < 0.001, supporting the external validity of the MASC.

This investigation extended this work by establishing an automated HSV-based framework to quantify 3 categories of vocal fold vibratory asymmetry. HSV-based analysis provided for cycle-to-cycle estimates of left-right phase asymmetry, left-right amplitude asymmetry, and axis shift during glottal closure for 52 speakers with no vocal pathology producing comfortable and pressed phonation. An initial cross-validation of the automated left-right phase asymmetry measure was performed by correlating the measure with other objective and subjective assessments of phase asymmetry. Vocal fold vibratory asymmetry was exhibited to a similar extent in both comfortable and pressed phonations. The automated measure of left-right phase asymmetry strongly correlated with manually derived measures and moderately correlated with visual-perceptual ratings. Correlations with the visual-perceptual ratings remained relatively consistent as the automated measure was derived from kymograms taken at different glottal locations. An automated HSV-based framework for the quantification of vocal fold vibratory asymmetry was developed and initially validated. This framework serves as a platform for investigating relationships between vocal fold tissue motion and acoustic measures of voice function.\n\nCross-cultural adaptation and clinical evaluation of a Korean version of the disabilities of arm, shoulder, and hand outcome questionnaire (K-DASH).\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Joo-Yup; Lim, Jae-Young; Oh, Joo Han; Ko, Young-Mi\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe developed a Korean version of the disabilities of arm, shoulder, and hand outcome questionnaire (K-DASH) by performing cross-cultural adaptation and evaluated the reliability and validity of the K-DASH. The K-DASH, SF-36, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain were administered to 161 patients with arm, shoulder, and hand problems. The internal consistency of the disability/symptom scores of the K-DASH was high (Cronbach's alpha 0.94). The retest assessed 131 of the 161 patients. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.91. The construct validity was evaluated using the correlations between the K-DASH and the SF-36 and VAS. The physical and mental component summary scales of the SF-36 and the VAS at rest and during activity were significantly correlated with the DASH disability/symptom scores. Despite the linguistic and cultural differences, the reliability and validity of the K-DASH were just as excellent as those of the original DASH.\n\nBatch Effect Confounding Leads to Strong Bias in Performance Estimates Obtained by Cross-Validation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDelorenzi, Mauro\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground With the large amount of biological data that is currently publicly available, many investigators combine multiple data sets to increase the sample size and potentially also the power of their analyses. However, technical differences (âbatch effectsâ) as well as differences in sample composition between the data sets may significantly affect the ability to draw generalizable conclusions from such studies. Focus The current study focuses on the construction of classifiers, and the use of cross-validation to estimate their performance. In particular, we investigate the impact of batch effects and differences in sample composition between batches on the accuracy of the classification performance estimate obtained via cross-validation. The focus on estimation bias is a main difference compared to previous studies, which have mostly focused on the predictive performance and how it relates to the presence of batch effects. Data We work on simulated data sets. To have realistic intensity distributions, we use real gene expression data as the basis for our simulation. Random samples from this expression matrix are selected and assigned to group 1 (e.g., âcontrolâ) or group 2 (e.g., âtreatedâ). We introduce batch effects and select some features to be differentially expressed between the two groups. We consider several scenarios for our study, most importantly different levels of confounding between groups and batch effects. Methods We focus on well-known classifiers: logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and Random Forests (RF). Feature selection is performed with the Wilcoxon test or the lasso. Parameter tuning and feature selection, as well as the estimation of the prediction performance of each classifier, is performed within a nested cross-validation scheme. The estimated classification performance is then compared to what is obtained when applying the classifier to independent data.

It is known that with more than one kinetic k-field one can possibly construct dark energy models whose equation of state parameter w{sub X} crosses -1 (the phantom barrier) at recent red-shifts, as indicated by the Supernova Ia and other observational probes. However, such models may suffer from cosmological instabilities, as the effective speed of propagation c{sub X} of the dark energy density perturbations may become imaginary while the w{sub X} =moreÂ Â» -1 barrier is crossed. Working out the expression for c{sub X} we show that multiple kinetic k-essence fields do indeed lead to a w{sub X} = -1 crossing dark energy model, satisfying the stability criterion c{sub X}{sup 2} {>=} 0 as well as the condition c{sub X} {<=} 1 (in natural units), which implies that the dark energy is not super-luminal. As a specific example, we construct a phantom barrier crossing model involving three k-fields for which c{sub X} is a constant, lying between 0 and 1. The model fits well with the latest Supernova Ia Union data, and the best fit shows that w{sub X} crosses -1 at red-shift z {approx} 0.2, whereas the dark energy density nearly tracks the matter density at higher red-shifts.Â«Â less\n\nCross-Validation of Survival Bump Hunting by Recursive Peeling Methods.\n\nPubMed\n\nDazard, Jean-Eudes; Choe, Michael; LeBlanc, Michael; Rao, J Sunil\n\n2014-08-01\n\nWe introduce a survival/risk bump hunting framework to build a bump hunting model with a possibly censored time-to-event type of response and to validate model estimates.

We developed a cross-culturally adapted Korean version of the RMDQ (RMDQ-K) and validated its use for assessing disability in Korean patients with low back pain. Two hundred thirty-one patients with low back pain were assessed using the RMDQ-K, visual analog scale (VAS) during rest and activity, and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The results of 40 patients were used to evaluate the test-retest reliability. The correlations of the RMDQ-K with the VAS and ODI were used to assess validity. The reliability of the RMDQ-K estimated using the internal consistency reached a Cronbach's alpha of 0.893. Test-retest trials showed a high intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.837 (95% CI 0.833-0.953). The RMDQ-K was significantly correlated with the ODI (r=0.738) and VAS during rest (r=0.450) and activity (r=0.412). This study demonstrates that the RMDQ-K is a reliable, valid instrument for measuring of disability in Korean patients with low back pain.\n\nCross sections for the Î³pâK*+Î and Î³pâK*+Î£0 reactions measured at CLAS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTang, W.; Hicks, K.; Keller, D.; Kim, S.

A 50-item FFQ was interviewer-administered and compared with data previously obtained from 5-day food records. Thirty-nine community-dwelling healthy men and women aged 65 to 85 years were recruited from the MontrÃ©al metropolitan area. Absolute and relative agreements between methods were assessed. Vitamin K intake measured by the vitamin K FFQ (mean+/-standard deviation; 222+/-186 microg/day) was significantly higher than that obtained by food records (135+/-153 microg/day; P<0.001). Bland-Altman analysis on log(10)-transformed data indicated that vitamin K intake from vitamin K FFQ was 2.26 times (95% confidence interval: 1.90 to 2.67) higher than food records, limits of agreement ranging from 0.80 to 6.35. However, correlation between methods was strong and highly significant (r=0.83; P<0.001). Cross-classification also showed that 72% of participants were correctly classified into thirds and only 8% were grossly miscategorized. Weighted kappa value (kappa=0.60) also indicated a good relative agreement. In light of these results, the vitamin K FFQ is a valid tool for ranking individuals according to their vitamin K intake. The poor absolute agreement likely results from the inability for food records to adequately measure the usual intake of episodically consumed foods, particularly those high in vitamin K. The vitamin K FFQ will be useful in large-scale, population-based research on vitamin K and disease as well as in clinical practice, especially that focusing on anticoagulant therapy.\n\nGeometry and Kinematics of Fault-Propagation Folds with Variable Interlimb Angles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDhont, D.; Jabbour, M.; Hervouet, Y.; Deroin, J.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nFault-propagation folds are common features in foreland basins and fold-and-thrust belts. Several conceptual models have been proposed to account for their geometry and kinematics. It is generally accepted that the shape of fault-propagation folds depends directly from both the amount of displacement along the basal decollement level and the dip angle of the ramp. Among these, the variable interlimb angle model proposed by Mitra (1990) is based on a folding kinematics that is able to explain open and close natural folds. However, the application of this model is limited because the geometric evolution and thickness variation of the fold directly depend on imposed parameters such as the maximal value of the ramp height. Here, we use the ramp and the interlimb angles as input data to develop a forward fold modelling accounting for thickness variations in the forelimb. The relationship between the fold amplitude and fold wavelength are subsequently applied to build balanced geologic cross-sections from surface parameters only, and to propose a kinematic restoration of the folding through time. We considered three natural examples to validate the variable interlimb angle model. Observed thickness variations in the forelimb of the Turner Valley anticline in the Alberta foothills of Canada precisely correspond to the theoretical values proposed by our model. Deep reconstruction of the Alima anticline in the southern Tunisian Atlas implies that the decollement level is localized in the Triassic-Liassic series, as highlighted by seismic imaging. Our kinematic reconstruction of the Ucero anticline in the Spanish Castilian mountains is also in agreement with the anticline geometry derived from two cross-sections. The variable interlimb angle model implies that the fault-propagation fold can be symmetric, normal asymmetric (with a greater dip value in the forelimb than in the backlimb), or reversely asymmetric (with greater dip in the backlimb) depending on the shortening\n\nA photo-cross-linking approach to monitor folding and assembly of newly synthesized proteins in a living cell.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiyazaki, Ryoji; Myougo, Naomi; Mori, Hiroyuki; Akiyama, Yoshinori\n\n2018-01-12\n\nMany proteins form multimeric complexes that play crucial roles in various cellular processes. Studying how proteins are correctly folded and assembled into such complexes in a living cell is important for understanding the physiological roles and the qualitative and quantitative regulation of the complex. However, few methods are suitable for analyzing these rapidly occurring processes. Site-directed in vivo photo-cross-linking is an elegant technique that enables analysis of protein-protein interactions in living cells with high spatial resolution. However, the conventional site-directed in vivo photo-cross-linking method is unsuitable for analyzing dynamic processes. Here, by combining an improved site-directed in vivo photo-cross-linking technique with a pulse-chase approach, we developed a new method that can analyze the folding and assembly of a newly synthesized protein with high spatiotemporal resolution. We demonstrate that this method, named the pulse-chase and in vivo photo-cross-linking experiment (PiXie), enables the kinetic analysis of the formation of an Escherichia coli periplasmic (soluble) protein complex (PhoA). We also used our new technique to investigate assembly/folding processes of two membrane complexes (SecD-SecF in the inner membrane and LptD-LptE in the outer membrane), which provided new insights into the biogenesis of these complexes. Our PiXie method permits analysis of the dynamic behavior of various proteins and enables examination of protein-protein interactions at the level of individual amino acid residues. We anticipate that our new technique will have valuable utility for studies of protein dynamics in many organisms.

Our model employs a natural coordinate system for describing proteins and a search strategy inspired by the observation that real proteins fold in a sequential fashion by incrementally stabilizing nativelike substructures or âfoldons.â Comparable folding pathways and structures are obtained for the twelve proteins recently studied using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations [K. Lindorff-Larsen, S. Piana, R. O. Dror, D. E. Shaw, Science 334, 517 (2011)], with our calculations running several orders of magnitude faster. We find that nativelike propensities in the unfolded state do not necessarily determine the order of structure formation, a departure from a major conclusion of the molecular dynamics study. Instead, our results support a more expansive view wherein intrinsic local structural propensities may be enhanced or overridden in the folding process by environmental context. The success of our search strategy validates it as an expedient mechanism for folding both in silico and in vivo.\n\nScreening for postdeployment conditions: development and cross-validation of an embedded validity scale in the neurobehavioral symptom inventory.\n\nPubMed\n\nVanderploeg, Rodney D; Cooper, Douglas B; Belanger, Heather G; Donnell, Alison J; Kennedy, Jan E; Hopewell, Clifford A; Scott, Steven G\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo develop and cross-validate internal validity scales for the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI). Four existing data sets were used: (1) outpatient clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI)/neurorehabilitation database from a military site (n = 403), (2) National Department of Veterans Affairs TBI evaluation database (n = 48 175), (3) Florida National Guard nonclinical TBI survey database (n = 3098), and (4) a cross-validation outpatient clinical TBI/neurorehabilitation database combined across 2 military medical centers (n = 206). Secondary analysis of existing cohort data to develop (study 1) and cross-validate (study 2) internal validity scales for the NSI. The NSI, Mild Brain Injury Atypical Symptoms, and Personality Assessment Inventory scores. Study 1: Three NSI validity scales were developed, composed of 5 unusual items (Negative Impression Management [NIM5]), 6 low-frequency items (LOW6), and the combination of 10 nonoverlapping items (Validity-10). Cut scores maximizing sensitivity and specificity on these measures were determined, using a Mild Brain Injury Atypical Symptoms score of 8 or more as the criterion for invalidity. Study 2: The same validity scale cut scores again resulted in the highest classification accuracy and optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity in the cross-validation sample, using a Personality Assessment Inventory Negative Impression Management scale with a T score of 75 or higher as the criterion for invalidity. The NSI is widely used in the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs as a symptom-severity assessment following TBI, but is subject to symptom overreporting or exaggeration. This study developed embedded NSI validity scales to facilitate the detection of invalid response styles. The NSI Validity-10 scale appears to hold considerable promise for validity assessment when the NSI is used as a population-screening tool.\n\nCross-Validating Chinese Language Mental Health Recovery Measures in Hong Kong\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBola, John; Chan, Tiffany Hill Ching; Chen, Eric HY; Ng, Roger\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjectives: Promoting recovery in mental health services is hampered by a shortage of reliable and valid measures, particularly in Hong Kong.

Deformation is partitioned in SW directed folding and thrusting of the sediments and NW-SE to N-S trending dextral strike slip faults. The sub-cylindrical doubly-plunging fold trains with wavelengths of 5 - 10 km host more than half of the world's hydrocarbon reserves in mostly anticlinal traps. Generally the Zagros is divided into three NW-SE striking tectonic units: the Zagros Imbricate Zone, the Zagros Simply Folded Belt and the Zagros Foredeep. This work presents a balanced cross-section through the Simply Folded Belt, NE of the city of Erbil (Kurdistan, Iraq). The regional stratigraphy comprises mainly Cretaceous to Cenozoic folded sediments consisting of massive, carbonate rocks (limestones, dolomites), reacting as competent layers during folding compared to the incompetent behavior of interlayered siltstones, claystones and marls. Although the overall security situation in Kurdistan is much better than in the rest of Iraq, structural field mapping was restricted to asphalt streets, mainly because of the contamination of the area with landmines and unexploded ordnance. In order to extend the structural measurements statistically over the investigated area, we used a newly developed software tool (www.terramath.com) for interactive structural mapping of spatial orientations (i.e. dip direction and dip angles) of the sedimentary beddings from digital elevation models. Structural field data and computed measurements where integrated and projected in NE-SW striking balanced cross-sections perpendicular to the regional trend of the fold axes. We used the software LithoTect (www.geologicsystems.com) for the restoration of the cross-sections.

Applicants and regulatory reviewers have been constrained by both a scarcity of data and a lack of clear technical basis or approach for use of the data. In this study, this paper describes a validation approach for commercial spent nuclear fuel (SNF) criticality safety (k eff) evaluations based on best-available data andmoreÂ Â» methods and applies the approach for representative SNF storage and transport configurations/conditions to demonstrate its usage and applicability, as well as to provide reference bias results. The criticality validation approach utilizes not only available laboratory critical experiment (LCE) data from the International Handbook of Evaluated Criticality Safety Benchmark Experiments and the French Haut Taux de Combustion program to support validation of the principal actinides but also calculated sensitivities, nuclear data uncertainties, and limited available FP LCE data to predict and verify individual biases for relevant minor actinides and FPs. The results demonstrate that (a) sufficient critical experiment data exist to adequately validate k eff calculations via conventional validation approaches for the primary actinides, (b) sensitivity-based critical experiment selection is more appropriate for generating accurate application model bias and uncertainty, and (c) calculated sensitivities and nuclear data uncertainties can be used for generating conservative estimates of bias for minor actinides and FPs. Results based on the SCALE 6.1 and the ENDF/B-VII.0 cross-section libraries indicate that a conservative estimate of the bias for the minor actinides and FPs is 1.5% of their worth within the\n\nCross validation issues in multiobjective clustering\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBrusco, Michael J.; Steinley, Douglas\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe implementation of multiobjective programming methods in combinatorial data analysis is an emergent area of study with a variety of pragmatic applications in the behavioural sciences. Most notably, multiobjective programming provides a tool for analysts to model trade offs among competing criteria in clustering, seriation, and unidimensional scaling tasks. Although multiobjective programming has considerable promise, the technique can produce numerically appealing results that lack empirical validity. With this issue in mind, the purpose of this paper is to briefly review viable areas of application for multiobjective programming and, more importantly, to outline the importance of cross-validation when using this method in cluster analysis.

To validate the psychometric properties of the condom self-efficacy scale (CSE) originally developed for American adolescents and young adults after translating the scale to Korean (CSE-K) to determine its suitability for cross-cultural research among Korean college students. A cross-sectional, correlational design was used with an exploratory survey methodology through self-report questionnaires. A convenience sample of 351 students, aged 18 to 25 years, were recruited at a university in Seoul, Korea. The participants completed the CSE-K and the intention of condom use scales after they were translated from English to Korean using a combined translation technique. A demographic and sex history questionnaire, which included an item to assess actual condom usage, was also administered.
