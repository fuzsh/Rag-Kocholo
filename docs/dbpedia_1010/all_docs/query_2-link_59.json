The event, now in its third occurrence in the vibrant city, promises to be a celebration of football excellence, as the best men’s and women’s players, coaches, and goalkeepers from the last season will be recognized.\n\nThe nominations, announced in September 2023, were determined through a meticulous process involving an international jury consisting of national team coaches, captains, specialist journalists, and passionate fans who cast over a million votes worldwide on FIFA’s official website.\n\nThe Best Awards, often likened to the prestigious Ballon d’Or, saw Lionel Messi clinch the Best Men’s Player accolade last year after leading Argentina to victory in the World Cup held in Qatar. This year, Messi finds himself among the finalists once again, competing against prolific Manchester City striker Erling Haaland and the dynamic PSG and France forward Kylian Mbappe.\n\nFor the Best Women’s Player category, Spain’s Women’s World Cup winner Aitana Bonmati emerges as the favorite. The Barcelona midfielder faces competition from her teammate Jenni Hermoso and Real Madrid’s Linda Caicedo.\n\nThe awards ceremony, scheduled for Monday, January 15, 2024, at 7:30 pm GMT in London, will be accessible for free streaming on the FIFA website and through FIFA+. Fans worldwide can eagerly anticipate the live coverage of this prestigious event, highlighting the global interest in the sport.\n\nApart from the player awards, the ceremony will also recognize outstanding coaches and goalkeepers in both the men’s and women’s categories. The finalists for these categories include renowned figures such as Pep Guardiola, Simone Inzaghi, Luciano Spalletti, Jonatan Giraldez, Emma Hayes, Sarina Wiegman, Yassine Bounou, Thibaut Courtois, Ederson, Mackenzie Arnold, Cata Coll, and Mary Earps.\n\nAdditionally, the much-coveted Puskas Award for the best goal of the year will be contested between Julio Enciso’s strike for Brighton against Manchester City and Guilherme Madruga’s exceptional goal for Botafogo-SP against Novorizontino.\n\nFootball enthusiasts around the globe eagerly await the FIFA Best Awards 2024, anticipating an evening filled with excitement, recognition, and celebration of the beautiful game."
