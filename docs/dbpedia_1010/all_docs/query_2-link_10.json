        "text": "Rahmon Fletcher has been recognised by BBL coaches for his outstanding work in pulling the strings for Esh Group Eagles Newcastle by being voted the Molten BBL Most Valuable Player for 2015-16.\n\nThe playmaker was at the forefront of his team’s quest for silverware and his latest individual honour arrives off the back of landing the MVP accolade at the 2016 BBL Cup Final, where he inspired his team to success in front of over 9,000 fans at the Barclaycard Arena in Birmingham.\n\nFeaturing in his second campaign in the BBL, the guard was one of the season leaders in terms of weekly All-Star five appearances and averaged more minutes than any other Eagles player. Fletcher used that time to corral 14.3 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.6 steals per game.\n\nHe also did his utmost to try and inspire his team in the Play-Offs, but the second seeds bowed out at the first hurdle in the Quarter-Finals – despite a 32-point and nine assist contribution from Fletcher in the first-leg.\n\nThe MVP award lands on Tyneside for a second season in a row, with his Eagles’ team-mate Charles Smith named MVP for 2014-15.\n\nFletcher fought off stiff competition from his fellow Molten BBL Team of the Year members in the form of Drew Sullivan (Leicester Riders), Jerrold Brooks (Sheffield Sharks), Kieron Achara (Glasgow Rocks) and Neil Watson (Leicester Riders)."
