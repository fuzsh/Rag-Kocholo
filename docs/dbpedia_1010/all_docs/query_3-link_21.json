        "text": "Basketball, as a medal sport, has been part of the Olympics since 1936.\n\nLeading into the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which was postponed to 2021 (Jul. 25 - Aug. 7) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States of America have dominated the gold medal tally in both the men's and women's categories.\n\nIn the men's, Team USA has won 15 of a possible 19 gold medals and will be gunning to bag their fourth consecutive gold in Tokyo. On the other hand, Team USA has won eight of a possible 11 since 1976 in the women's category and will be looking to win their seventh consecutive.\n\nHow will things pan out in Tokyo?\n\nCompetition Format\n\nThe 12 teams are divided into three groups of four. After the group phase, the top two teams from each group and the two best third-place teams qualify for the Quarterfinals.\n\nBelow, find an in-depth look at the history, form, roster, groups and schedule of every one of the 12 participating teams.\n\n(Stay tuned for the preview of the women's bracket)\n\nPreview: Japan | Argentina | Australia | Czech Republic | France | Germany | Iran | Italy | Nigeria | Slovenia | Spain | USA\n\nJapan (host)\n\nForm and History\n\nQualifying for the tournament as the host, Japan is the lowest-ranked squad from the FIBA men's rankings among the final 12. This is their first participation in Olympic men's basketball since 1976, when they went winless and finished 11th of 12.\n\nThe team is coming off a winless 0-5 record in the 2019 FIBA World Cup.\n\nRoster\n\nYudai Baba, Gavin Edwards, Rui Hachimura, Tenketsu Harimoto, Makoto Hiejima, Kosuke Kanamaru, Avi Schafer, Daiki Tanaka, Yuki Togashi, Leo Vendrame, Hugh Watanabe, Yuta Watanabe.\n\nNotable NBA players\n\nThe team's roster is headlined by NBA players in 23-year-old Rui Hachimura, a 6-foot-8 second-year wing for the Washington Wizards, and 26-year-old Yuta Watanbe, a 6-foot-9 third-year wing for the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe next biggest star on the team is Yudai Baba, a 25-year-old guard for Melbourne United in Australia's National Basketball League.\n\nAdditionally, Hachimura was named the flag bearer for Japan's delegation for the July 23rd opening ceremony.\n\nGroup and Schedule\n\nThey are pooled in Group C which includes two top-four ranked squads in Spain (2), Argentina (4) and Slovenia.\n\nDate Day Opponent Jul. 26 Monday Spain Jul. 29 Thursday Slovenia Aug. 1 Sunday Argentina\n\nArgentina\n\nForm and History\n\nThis Argentina squad, which is ranked fourth in the FIBA Men's ranking, is coming off a silver-medal finish at the 2019 FIBA World Cup. They are the only nation, that still exists, to have won a basketball gold medal in the men's category apart from the USA.\n\nTheir 2004 gold medal in Athens is arguably their national basketball team's greatest achievement. The only other medal they have won at the Olympics is the bronze at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.\n\nRoster\n\nLautaro Berra, Leandro Bolmaro, Nicolas Brussino, Francisco Caffaro, Facundo Campazzo, Gabriel Deck, Marcos Delia, Juan Francisco Fernandez, Maximo Fjellerup, Tayavek Gallizzi, Patricio Garino, Nicolas Laprovittola, Luis Scola, Juan Pablo Vaulet, Lucas Vildoza.\n\nNBA players\n\nAt the age of 41, Luis Scola - a former 10-year NBA veteran from 2007 to 2017 - will be playing in his fifth Olympics, the most ever by an Argentian basketball player.\n\nA key member of the team reaching the final of the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Scola's expertise and experience will be huge. Apart from him, there are four NBA players on the roster: Facundo Campazzo (Denver Nuggets), Leandro Bolmaro (No. 23 overall pick 2020 NBA Draft with the Minnesota Timberwolves), Gabriel Deck (Oklahoma City Thunder) and Lucas Vildoza (New York Knicks).\n\nGroup and Schedule\n\nArgentina is grouped with Spain, who they played in the Final of the 2019 FIBA World Cup, in Group B alongside Slovenia and the hosts, Japan.\n\nDate Day Opponent Jul. 26 Monday Slovenia Jul. 29 Thursday Spain Aug. 1 Sunday Japan\n\nAustralia\n\nOne of the most talented rosters in the 12-team field, Australia is looking to bag its first-ever medal. It came mighty close in Rio in 2016 when it lost the bronze medal game to Spain by just the one point (89-88).\n\nThree years later, at the FIBA World Cup in 2019, they finished fourth and finished agonizingly close once again to their first-ever international medal for basketball. However, that fourth-place finish allowed them to directly qualify for the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nRoster\n\nChris Goulding, Patty Mills, Joshua Benjamin Green, Joe Ingles, Matthew Dellavedova, Nathan Sobey, Matisse Thybulle, Dante Exum, Aaron Baynes, Jock Landale, Duop Thomas Reath, Nic Kay.\n\nNotable NBA players\n\nThe Boomers squad is headlined by veteran NBA players in Mills (San Antonio Spurs) and Ingles (Utah Jazz). Mills, who is competing in his fourth Olympics, is the flag bearer for the Australian contingent. Thus, becoming the first Indigenous Australian to carry the flag at an Olympic Games\n\nOther former or current NBA players who are also part of the roster include Aron Baynes (Toronto Raptors), Matthew Dellavedova, Dante Exum (Houston Rockets), Josh Green (Dallas Mavericks) and Matisse Thybulle (Philadelphia 76ers).\n\nGroup and schedule\n\nThe Australian Boomers were drawn alongside Nigeria, Italy and Germany in Group B for Tokyo Olympics.\n\nDay Date Opponent Sunday Jul. 25 Nigeria Wednesday Jul. 28 Italy Saturday Jul. 31 Germany\n\nCzech Republic\n\nForm and History\n\nHaving finished sixth in the 2019 FIBA World Cup, the Czech Republic needed to win their qualifying tournament in Victoria, Canada. They did just that, rebounding from an opening game loss at the hands of Turkey to winning it all, courtesy of a dominant performance over Greece.\n\nHowever, their run to the Finals of the qualifying tournament needed some heroics in the first game of the knockout stage against Canada.\n\nWinning the tournament sealed the Czech Republic's first-ever appearance at the Olympics since the separation of Czechoslovakia.\n\nRoster\n\nPatrik Auda, Ondrej Balvin, Jaromir Bohacik, Lukas Palyza, Martin Peterka, Patrick Samoura, Tomas Satoransky, Blake Schilb, Ondrej Sehnal, Jakub Sirina, Jan Vesely, Tomas Vyoral.\n\nNotable NBA players\n\nTheir squad only includes the lone NBA player and that is guard Tomas Satoransky. The Chicago Bulls representative came up huge for the Czechs as it was his shot that propelled the team to the final of the qualifying tournament.\n\nGroup and Schedule\n\nAfter winning their qualifiers in Canada, Czech Republic were slotted against Iran, France and World No. 1-ranked USA.\n\nDate Day Opponent Sunday Jul. 25 Iran Wednesday Jul. 28 France Saturday Jul. 31 USA\n\nFrance\n\nForm and History\n\nFinishing third in the 2019 FIBA World Cup, France directly qualified for the Tokyo Olympics along with winners Spain as one of the two teams from Europe. This is their third consecutive Olympics, their longest such streak since 1960.\n\nHaving finished sixth in the previous two editions – 2012 at London and 2016 in Rio – the French squad will be keen to get among the medals once again. In the history of this competition, they only have two medals to show for and both are Silver (1948, 2000).\n\nRoster\n\nAndrew Albicy, Nicolas Batum, Petr Cornelie, Nando de Colo, Moustapha Fall, Evan Fournier, Rudy Gobert, Thomas Heurtel, Timothé Luwawu Kongbo, Frank Ntilikina, Vincent Poirier, Guerschon Yabusele.\n\nNotable NBA players\n\nThe French national squad includes five current NBA players, headlined by the reigning NBA Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert.\n\nOther NBA players include LA Clippers forward Nicolas Batum, Boston Celtics guard Evan Fournier, New York Knicks guard Frank Ntilikina and Brooklyn Nets guard Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot.\n\nApart from these current stars, there are also a couple of former NBA players in Nando de Colo, Guerschon Yabusele and Vincent Poirier.\n\nGroup and Schedule\n\nFrance is slotted in Group A alongside Czech Republic, Iran and the World's No. 1 squad - Team USA.\n\nDate Day Opponent Sunday Jul. 25 USA Wednesday Jul. 28 Czech Republic Saturday Jul. 31 Iran\n\nGermany\n\nForm and History\n\nThis is Germany's sixth appearance in the men's basketball tournament at the Olympics. It is their first since the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and after their 18th placed finish at the 32-team 2019 FIBA World Cup, it took winning a qualifying tournament in Croatia to seal it.\n\nRoster\n\nDanilo Barthel, Robin Benzing, Isaac Bonga, Niels Giffey, Justus Hollatz, Leon Kratzer, Moado Lo, Andres Obst, Joshiko Saibou, Johannes Thiemann, Johannes Voigtmann, Moritz Wagner, Lukas Wank, Jan Niklas Wimberg.\n\nNotable NBA players\n\nWith Los Angeles Lakers guard Dennis Schroder not participating, the German national team includes only two NBA players: Orlando Magic forward Moritz Wagner and Washington Wizards guard Isaac Bonga.\n\nGroup and Schedule\n\nAfter winning their qualifying tournament in Croatia, they were slotted in Group B alongside Italy, Australia and Nigeria, the only team from Africa in the Olympics.\n\nDay Date Opponent Sunday Jul. 25 Italy Wednesday Jul. 28 Nigeria Saturday Jul. 31 Australia\n\nIran\n\nForm and History\n\nThe only team from Asia in the Tokyo Olympics, this is just Iran's third appearance in the Olympics with the previous qualifications in 1948 and 2008. The three-time Asia Cup Champions (2007, 2009, 2013) are coming off a 23rd place finish in the 2019 FIBA World Cup, which was their third consecutive World Cup – the most they have played in a row in the country's history.\n\nRoster\n\nYet to confirm; No NBA players.\n\nGroup and Schedule\n\nIran is slotted in Group A alongside Czech Republic, France and the World's No. 1 team in the USA.\n\nDay Date Opponent Sunday Jul. 25 Czech Republic Wednesday Jul. 28 USA Saturday Jul. 31 France\n\nItaly\n\nForm and History\n\nCurrently ranked 12th in the FIBA rankings, the Italians qualified for the Olympics by winning the Qualifying Tournament in Serbia, Belgrade.
