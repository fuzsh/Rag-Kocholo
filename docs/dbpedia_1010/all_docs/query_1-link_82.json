This applies mostly to the straight bands, and not bands with specialty people added. A booking meeting will be held next week in which the importance of how material will be emphasized for next season. It is the consensus of opinion among the bookers vaudeville is now suffering from an overdose of too much similarity in material. A popular song that clicks will be Bung to death within a month, and the same fate follows a new gag that becomes popular. New acts appear occasionally without one original line, piece of business or dialog. Although many bf this type secure bookings in the neighborhood houses, they can never attain the best bookings Where a sophisticated audience re- fuses to accept the hackneyed mate- rial. This condition keeps the big time regulars going along year in and year out with very few new faces. iThe public like to see newcomers of ability, but they are few and far between. The small time for these reasons has not developed enough new acts to replace those practically playing themselves out and others who have lost their value through lack of pro- gresslveness and showmanship. It Is currently rumored that a time limit may be placed on acts of a certain type to insure a new act each season. JUBILEE N. G.

Four floors of the Grand Central Palace are to be devoted to the wholesale and manufacturing end of the trade, while the 69th Regiment Armory will be turned over to the ready-to- wear garment manufacturers. There is a possibility that still another building also on Lexington avenue may be taken over for one of the added attractkuis in conjunction with the exposition. The affair is to be the biggest of its kind that has ever been held in New York City by the garment trade. It will attract a tremendous number of out-of-town buyers.

AMAZES MEETING Annual Gathering of Equity Fails to Disclose Financial Statement — Many Ques- tions Asked by Frank Sheridan — Unsatisfactory Answers by Emerson and Gillmore — Plead Delay Caused by Los Angeles Branch — Benefits Unprof- itable — Queries on Ex- penditures — Officers and Councilmen Re-elected SMALL CROWD ATTENDS At the annual meeting of Equity Monday in New York a gasp could be heard throughout the attendance when it was announced 12,081 mem- bers had been suspended for non- papment of dues. Grant Stewart had given out the following statistics: New members for the past yr, 2,045; life mem- bers, 6; resignations, 206. The next announcement was of the suspensions. Frank Gillmore explained that these had not been expelled, but can be placed in good standing again by payment of back dues. But the effect was dispelled by this statement. Stewart sensed this and hastened to read that there had been no ex- pulsions, but 73 deaths, and asked those present to stand in silence while he read the names. The attendance at the annual meeting Monday of Equity was far from satisfactory to the officials and decidedly illuminating as to the calibre of members in attend- ance. There were barely 400 pres- ent, mostly well on in years, and not 10 recognized standard actors amongst them, not counting those on the platform. The meeting, scheduled to open at 2 p. m., got under way .it 2 : 4f> and concluded at 4:15. Most of the time was consumed with matters usually considered foreign to an Important business meeting. This may or may not have been under expert advice. There were IS men and three TERROR OF THE BORDER RUNNERS UNDER ARREST AS BOOTLEGGER Ralph Hackmeister, Former Customs Guard.

There was hardly a dry eye in the group of almost 300 people when Will, fol- lowing a speech by Gene Buck, stood on a chair to make his fare- well address. Will cried openly and admitted to the company that he finally had to confess what he had been trying to conceal for a long time, that he is effeminate. The tears, said Will, proved It. The first tear of the night came when the audience gave a spon- taneous farewell to Will just before the last curtain fell. It seemed that everyone in the audience knew he was leaving, In spite of the fact that no public announcement had been made. As the curtain fell with Will in the center, the orchestra played \"Old Lang Syne\" and the audience stood and cheered and yelled for a speech. Tears rolled down Will's cheeks as he bowed his acknowl- edgements, and Ma.-y Baton kissed him. Will had to have an hour alone In his dressing room before he trusted himself to come down to Join the party on the stage. He felt the tears coming again, however, and stayed In the property room until Buck dragged him out to the centre of the stage.

He was detained by federal men at West Mountain. ■near here, and a car full of liquor alleged to have belonged to him was seized. It's not the usual rum running case. Hackmeister not so long ago was a U. S. Customs guard at Rouse's Point, where he was known to the bootleggers as the terror of the border. Among the bootleggers of those days it was conceded that no one could get to Hackmeister, and anyone running the Canadian line was more fearful of the fearless Customs guard than any other man or thing along the border. Hackmeister was looked upon as a two-gun man, a dead shot, and his gun was said to have h\"Id several notches that denoted drivers of fl«e- ing cars Hackmeister had gone after. / A story known to but a few mil never published Is of a New York bootlegger who decided that If Hackmeister could be detained in conversation at a given point, liquor could pass him on another road meanwhile. To aceomplish his end the bootlegger engaged a young woman from the stage in New York, an attractive-looking girl of bright mind and hair (rod head) as his assistant. They drove to Canada In a car, meeting Hackmeister on the way and waved to him at close range with the girl smiling. On their way back In a roadster again Hackmeister spied and hailed them. The girl, in her most engag- ing manner, held him in conversa- tion until the bootlegger's trucks had gone south on another road. It was claimed by the bootlegger and the girl It was the only time a rum runner had ever put over my- thing on Hackmeister, who. while In the service, bore an unblemished reputation.

A. F. Member Gives Version Why Equity Post- poned Its Vaudeville Intentions Until June, 1924 — Some Direct Remarks 4, The story that Equity, through ito council, had decided not to In- terfere in the vaudeville situation until (at the earliest) June, 1924, whfii the P. M. A. contract Jssuc will have to be decided one way or the other, reached the officials and hoard of directors of the A. A. F. (Vaudeville Branch) and it found tbem in no receptive or grateful frame of mind. Equity's Vove was classified by A. A. P. representatives as a well developed Cfise of cold feet, induced by the knowledge that Mountford, FitzPatrick and their supporters were preparing to carry the war to Equity, instead of waiting for Equi- ty's first move. Fearful of what revelations might be made, the A. A. V. claim, the Equity crowd quit cold, and not through any consider- ation for the A. A. F. ' \"Equity knew that arrangements had been made by the A. A. F. to hold an open meeting in a Times square theater next Thursday (to- day), at which the whole story was to have been told to the actors or anyone else who cared to hear it. Also that it was the intention of the A. A. F. to force the Equity to open its books by court action, in answer to Paul Dulzell's statement that Equity had over 2,000 vaudeville actors in its membership. 'If this is true, Equity has over $24,000 of our money, which belongs to uh and which we want. \"This matter will have to be ad- justed in any case, but we have called the meeting off. \"The Equity crowd has made a ridiculous exhibition of themselves with their bluffs at the Pla/.a hotel meeting, and their published state- ments in s<»me papers,\" an A. A. F. member said. \"These fellows who talk about fighting the managers, why are they afraid to give the A. A. F. a battle? \"They started on up,\" he contin- ued, \"and while it only takes one to start a light, it takes two to quit. The A. A. F. is not doing any quit- ting.. \"Equity does not want to forget how the 1910 strike was engineered, and by whom. Also how at critical times, instead of sturdy action, the supposed leaders of the strike burst into tears and ask what must be done. If they have learned to fight on their own since then, and want a fight with the A. A. F., wo are more than willing to accommodate them, and if we are licked we'll at leant go down with our colors fly- ing,\" the same member concluded.

Codsol and Gabriel Hess have arrived here in the interests of the Goldwyn suit against the Stoll Film Co. The action is based on a split be- tween the two firms which occurred three years ago when Goldwyn stopped delivering pictures to Stoll for British distribution. Stoll in turn ceased payments to Goldwyn on previous releases. Eminent counsel lias been re- tained by both sides, with the ac- tion to be heard this week. 'OLIVER CROMWELL'UNLIKELY London, June 6. John Drink water's \"Oliver Crom- well\" was presented May 29 at His Majt sty's by Henry Ainley by ar- rangement with George Grossmith and J. A. E. Malone.

BERNARD SHAW REVIVED Paris, June 6. The sarcastical dramatic fable bearing the title locally of \"An- drocles et le Lion\" in a prolog and two acts by Bernard Shaw, adapted to the French stage by' Henriette and Augustin Hamon, was revived by Jacques Hebertot at the Comedie des Champs Elysees last week and obtained fairly good notices. The title role of Androcles is held by a corpulent looking comedian, Evseef, with the Russian-Swiss actor George Pitoeff as Caesar and hia wife Ludmilla Pitoeff as Lavinia. Pierre I'rondaie's four-act melo- drama from the novel of Claude Farrere, \"L'Homme qui Assassina,\" was revived at the Theatre dc Paris last Friday, with Andre Brule, Jules Toulout, Paul Escoffler, Gaston Sev- erin, Madeleino Lely (role of Lady Falkland), Marie Marcilly.

In the face of all hits it is safe to say Van Hovert is one of the inggest things the United States ever vcr.t to England. He ranks with the big- native stars and can play in and around London for life, though he i.s considered one of the biggest draws in the provinces.

MAURDU'S COMEDY Odeon Unsuited for This Romantic Melodrama The initial presentation of Pierre Maurdu's three-act comedy entitled \"Madame La Societaire\" was fairly well received at the Odeon May 30. The 'Odeon is unsuited -or this ro- mantic type of melodrama. The title signifies a leading mem- ber of the Comedie Francaise named Juliette, who has an illegitimate daughter she educates as her niece. A friend makes love to both mother and daughter. The latter prefers a nephew and marries him. The actress marries her son-in-law's father. Andrce Megard is in the actress role with Renee Devillers as the daughter.

The second half is given over en- tirely to colored players (from the \"Plantation\" cabaret, New York) in a plantation revue and was received tumultuously with every indication Florence Mills and company have established themselves here. At the conclusion of the perform- ance the pit started booing, but it was impossible to determine wheth- er it was intended for the colored artists, entire entertainment or first part. The pit generously applauded throughout the second half. Hannen Swaffer, a theatrical pjir- agrapher for the \"Daily Graphic\" and \"Sunday Times,\" was refused admittance to the Pavilion by Charles B. Cochran on the opening night. Cochran took trie newspaper man by the arm, informing him he could not come in and returned the money for the purchased tickets.

Some Weeks ago Variety's London correspondent received and trans- mitted to America a cable to the effect Roscoe ('\"Fatty\") 'Arbuckle was in London. The report ema- nated from a man called Charles H. Johnson, who said be was the first officer of the steamship \"President Adams\" and Arbuckle had ero on her under an alias. The story was borne out by the appearance in London of a man who might ♦•a«i!y have l»» « n taken for Arbuckle. Apparently this man was support- ing the story and doing well on his likeness to the famous comedian. The sequel has been written in police court records to the effect that Johnson had not been to sea for two years, was not the first of- ficer of the American steamship, •President Adams,\" and had lived for some time by forging sailing masters' advance pay notes.

THE TILLER SCHOOLS OF DANCING 143 Charing Cress Road LONDON Director, JOHN TILLER WILETTK KERSHAW OITARANTY TRUST CO. 122 Fifth Avenue j.fw Thursday, June 7, 1923 VAUDEVILLE SEE KELLEY WINS GOOD WILL CASE; PRECEDENT FOR SHOW BUSINESS Treasury Department Ruling Saves $200,000 to Ring- ling Heirs — Rule Applies to All Inheritances in Amusement Field By a decision of the Board of Ap- peals and Review of the Inheritance Tax Division of the U. S. Treasury Department, handed down late last week, it is ruled on the argument of John M. Kelley that the good will of a circus is without ascer- tainable or taxable value in refer- ence to transfer as an inheritance. This complete victory for the Ringling attorney not only makes a saving of from $150,000 to $200,000 to the heirs of the late Henry and Alf T, Ringling. but it creates a precedent which will probably be followed in the settlement of all estates and properties transferred under the inheritance tax regula- tions where show property is in- volved. j Mr. Kelley wrote a brilliant argu- ment involving a detailed history of the circus business, a record not obtainable anywhere else. He nought to impress the point that there is good will in the amusement business and that element is enor- mously valuable. But the good will attaches to the personality and in- dividuality of the manager and dies with him. That, by Mr. KelleV's argument, is why there \"is only one Ringling Circus, one Ziegfeld 'Fol- lies.' etc.\" The brief also presents a history of circus failures to prove that cir- cus good will is not an asset that auVvives a deceased showman. Mr. Kelley traced a trail of broken and bankrupt shows to the tomb of ex- pired circuses, the wreckage plant of William P.

W. Cole's New Colossal Shows. Came into prominence around 1870-71. Cole brought to his show the heritage of birth and associa- tion. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Cook, presented the first Imported circus in America In 1836. His mother was an accomplished show woman. W. W. Cole built his show to a highly successful institution, and exhibited throughout the United States, Canada, Australia and the South Sea Islands. The Cole Show was the first to go on rails in America and the first show to cross the continent on rails. W. W. Cole, with the possible exception of Bailey, gathered more money from the circus, investment considered, than any other show- man. Finally he retired. His show was disposed of at auction at New Orleans in 1885. For many years ambitious showmen sought to benefit by Cole's well-founded reputation. Time and again under different owners a show went out feat- uring the name Cole, traveling through the same territory where Cole had made a fortune; but • lacking Cole's personal skill, fore- sight and leadership, it proved a failure. After struggling under different owners for fifteen years or more, it closed a failure and was sold at auction. No name in circus history died Imrder than the name Cole. It was the objective in exploitation among nmbltlous showmen for a Kent ration. Cole's financial suc- cess made it so. To Others than Cole himself, the original builder, the good will or trade name never proved a profitable investment. Among others who traded upon the name Cole in fruitless at- tempts to pet something of value from it. we mention the following: Cole Brothers World -Toured Shows. Martin J. Downs put out the circus in 1906. The same outfit had pre- viously carried with disastrous re- sults the name — Sells & Orey Cir- cus. Downs built the show to a 30 car circus and operated it up to 1909. The outfit, never a success, was upon the death of Downs closed out at Corry, Pa., in February, 1910, through agents, Fiss, Doerr & Carroll. Cole Brothers World -Toured Shows. We find this show again on the road in 1912. Put out by Wade H. Coulter and AI. O. Campbell (of Campbell Bros. Circus). The property comprising what was formerly Coulter's Shows was leased from Wm. P. Hall. At Albany, Missouri. February 1, 1913, Coulter died. The circus proved a failure. In 1913 the circus went out again in the hands of Al. G. Campbell. Ed. Campbell, Virg. Campbell and Fred. Hatfield. Again It spelled failure and was taken over finally by Wm. P. Hall. The season of 1916 saw the cir- cus on the road again as a 16 car show, put out by J. Augustus Jones. In 1917 Jones continued the circus as a 20-car show. Failure. In 1918 Jones put the show out reduced to 11 cars. Late in the season Jones died. A short time afterward the circus closed and was shipped to Shreveport, La., concluding the last sad chapter in the Cole experiment. It is important to note that those who succeeded Cole in the use of his name were not purchasers of a fractional interest in a trade name, and were not limited 'to a fractional interest of a deceased owner, and were not subject to competition of previous owners simultaneously operating under the name. Carl Hagenbeck Trained Animal Circus. At the St. Louis expo- sition. 1904, Carl Hagenbeck pre- sented his splendid exhibition of trained wild animals. The next year many of the acts were ex- hibited with success in theatres. 1905 the circus was put out as a brand new railroad show by Hagenbeck and his associates, Frank R. Tate, John H. Havlin, C. Lee Williams and C. N. Tl. .np- son. The show was splendidly equipped, well organized, backed by ample capital and managed by experienced showmen. It lost heavily from the day it opened. In the venture Havlin is reported to have lost $260,000 and Tate $75,000. Great Wallace Shows. B. R. Wal- lace of Peru, Indiana, was pur- chaser of the remains of the Carl Hagenbeck Trained Animal Cir- cus. Wallace, a man of long and varied circus experience, , was identified with various shows, such as Cook & Whitby's, Wallace & Anderson — always making money, always giving close personal at- tention to details and always pur- suing a \"policy peculiarly his own.\" He followed the conserva- tive code. A few horses from a livery stable end equipment pur- chased from broken-down . circus outfits was the beginning. The wagon show was made over into a railroad show. At the time of the Hagenbeck failure the Wal- lace Circus was next in size to the Ringling enterprises. Carl Hagenbeck A. Great Wallace Shows Combined— was the name put upon the show by Wallace. In emphasizing the point that It is the personal service and skill of the manager that is the chief feature in circus success, it is im- portant to note that Wallace, when he combined these shows in many ways subordinated his own name and featured the Hagenbeck Trained Wild Animal name— a name which had in other hands met with complete failure. Wal- lace, giving this enterprise his direct personal management, made of it a success. He sold out July 1, 1913. to a corporation con- trolled by John O. Talbot, Charles F. Cory, Charles Hagemon, J. \\\\\\ Warren and Ed. Ballard. Charles Cory, nephew of Wal- lace, was a successful traction railroad man. Cory ha. I beCn ld< n- lified from childhood with his uncle in the management of the Wallace circus and Talbot had even been business manager for the Wallace circus. The new management did not. enjoy ihe measure of succ< achieved by Wallace, Note. During all of ihese yeai i the Ringling circuses were oper- ating with tremendous success from every viewpoint every year (Continued on page 2%) HARRY HOLMAN Just finished my annual tour over Keith and Orpheum Circuits.

WEEK OF DRIFTING IN AMUSEMENT STOCKS Price Changes Narrow and Trading Small and With- out Significance It was a dull and featureless week in the amusement stocks with aim- less drifting of prices within nar- row range and transactions at so low* a volume that trading was without significance. The listed theatre issues held close to levels that have come to be regarded as their resistance points, or just above. The market seems to have gone into its regular summer phase. There never has been a major upswing in prices in June and July and the public seems to have reconciled It- self to a period of waiting, leaving the list to the tender mercies of the professional operators. What they will do is, of course, uncertain, but the logic of the situation would seem to be that If prices won't go up they are likely to go down. At least that la the brokerage idea, for margin calls were sent out whole- sale early in the week asking for pretty substantial reinforcement of accounts. Orpheum gave way to 18 after presenting a solid front during the heaviest of the pressure, but deal- ings were so small as to be negligi- ble. Reports from Chicago Indicate a particularly strong position of the stock. It Is said profits for the first quarter were more than suffi- cient to care for the preferred divi- dends and even the first week In June gave the business a profit. In the other stocks dealings ap- parently represented the surrender of small accounts under pressure and no disposition to support prices on the part of insiders.

ON CONCERT TOUR, WM EXPOSE SPIRITUALISM Master Magician Arranging to Spreadeagle Country on Educational Tour — May Also Expose Other Fakes for Credulous — Has New Thumb Trick YOUNG FRENCH POET IS SENT BACK HOME Claims Against Clarke Silver- nail Countered by Manager; Young and Temperamental Maurice Aubret, a young French poet who arrived in New York in the first cabin of the \"Olympic\" two weeks ago, left in the third class on the \"Ohio\" Inst Saturday with a deep-seated grudge in his artistic soul against America and all things American, particularly American actors who endeavor to present their native plays in the language of France. Aubret was discovered riding down Fifth avenue in a taxi with about $2 in his pockets by some American girls who had known him during his student days in Paris. After buying the 22-year-old poet a dinner- and obtaining free lodging and board for him with some kindly French people, they consented to listen to the story of his alleged per- secutions and trials. He claimed that he had been brought to this country by Clarke Silvernall, who had made a verbal contract with him to coach the New York presen- tation of \"Ofgcer 6CC\" in French at a guaranteed salary of $50 a week. Once on this side, he anys, the pro- ducer ditched him. leaving him without funds, resources, or any re- muneration for the work he claims to have done on the trip over. Si** er nail says that Beverly Slt- graves became interested in the struggling young poet shortly after the war and persuaded him to aid the boy in various wnys. Silvernall recognized the conspicuous promise shown in Aubert's poems, and kept up a correspondence with him after returning to this country. On his last visit to Paris, the manager says that he came across the poet living in pitiful poverty and extremely anxious to find picture work in America> Silvernall stresses the claim that, after lending the boy over $150, he made no contract, but agreed to bring him to America in return for some personal tutoring in the finer points of the French language. He also 'says he had promised to re- ward the poet liberally for Ave hours a day work on this side, but when they arrived the boy shirked his duties and remained unsatisfied, even though Silvernall tried to place him with several film com- panies and other theatrical con- cerns. The last straw, according to Sil- vernall, was when suddenly enter- ing his office one morning he found the Frenchmen ransacking a trunk. After walloping the poet's jaw, the producer claims that he threw him out of his office, alt further sym- pathy and aid going with him. Aubret continued to live with the French couple for a few days, but they soon tired of his temperamen- tal and \"borrowing\" ways and sent him down to the French Consul, who advanced him the money for passage home. He has had two or three books of poems published, re- ceiving rather favorable reviews on both sides of the Atlantic. He also has a good light tenor voice and ha* appeared in many Paris con- certs. Before leaving New York, Aubret claimed that he has enough theatrical influence in the French capital to Mop Silvcrnail from pro- ducing there. The American man- ager is inclined to laugh at this statement. EDDIE CANTOR DOUBLING Eddie Cantor will open a two- week engagement at the Palace, New York, next week (June 11). The Comedian, who followed Will Rogers into Ziegfeld \"Follies.\" will double Into the Palace from the muaical comedy the weeks of Jun«» It and 18. Cantor will play about four weeks for the Keith office in Greater New- York I Harry HoudinI, the master musician, is arranging to spread- eagle the country next season on a concert -educational tour in an ex- pose of spiritualism. HoudinI will do the triaks of the mediums and offer to duplicate any spirit manifestation a local medium will do ahead of him on the same stage or elsewhere. To educate the public into the possible trickery of fake \"spirits\" has long been a slumbering ambition of Houdini's. His recent contro- versy with Sir Conan Doyle, the em- inent Englisman who became a con- vert, has led to Houdini's determina- tion to proceed with his cherished plan. While accepted aa an \"escape artist\" until his name has grown to be a by -word in that connection, HoudinI ranks with the master magicians of the world. There la no trick In magic he does not know of, and knows many other magi- cians are unaware of. In addition he is super-proficient in illusion* and escapes, and besides his com- plete knowledge of the methods of mediums, HoudinI la Intimately up in the lore of the \"mental telepath- lsts\" or \"mind readers,\" and their equipment. It Is within the probabilities HoudinI may add to his educational tour a short synopsis on \"mind reading\" aa at present practiced, when so performed for deceptive purposes. Houdini's latest magic trick is biting off his thumb. Bending his thumb forward and backward while apparently cutting It with a knife blade, the magician placet the thumb in his mouth as though to bite It, and when withdrawing the member It looks to be severed*, It may be what la known as a \"table trick\" (not adaptable to stage pres- entation), but Is thoroughly mystify- ing and has puxsled several news- paper people on the dailies in New York of late. ROSCOE ARBUCKLE IS ACCEPTED IN CHICAGO Opens at Prominent Restau- rant to Capacity Crowd in Exclusive Neighborhood Chicago, June •. If nothing untoward crops up for the remaining three weeks of Kos- coe Arbuckle's cabaret debut at Marigold Gardens, there will be no question left to the fact Chicago has accepted the former film come- dian. Monday night's business at the Gardens, where a now revue also opened, broke all records for this prominent cabaret, located In one of Chicago's most exclusive neigh- borhoods. Conservative press work and good Judgment In handling Arbuckle prior to his debut marked his en- trance into the limelight once again as a public entertainer. Nat Roy- ster is locally given much credit for the able manner In which Ros- coe was handled from both angles. He had to line up sis dailies, ar- ranging a dinner nightly forgone of the representatives of sach\". at which Arbuckle acted as host. Din- ners were also given to well known nati\\es of social and financial stand- ing, patrons of the Gardens, and Arbuckle again graced the affairs. Arbuckle is leading a couple of i numbers in the show and doing J some comedy falls. The brat obtainable InitrurUon at STUDIOS OF SYAfiE DAIKINC 1841 Broadway NORTHWEST C6s. COth i>T I M*M , >.l . '.

REGULATED ! 50.000 ON BRAVES FIELD Managers' Association in Receipt of Complaints from Acts — Month's Trial of Material Suggested — V. M. P. A. Will Protect Authors Loew Starting Night Shows Dancing June 11. ind The Vaudeville Managers' Pro- tective Association is to Investigate the royalties and advance fees charged i>y vaudeville authors in an effort to protect artist-, from paying 1750 to $1,000 for Material that after purchase Is often f*<nr,i\\ worthless and unplayable. The nianaK^r«' association has been investigating the condition fol- lowing complaints from arcs ami has concluded many tarns are go- ing along with old hackneyed ma- terial after experiencing a ioxs of money following the purchase of worthless material. The \"advance royalty\" practise is the bane of the whole evil accord- ing to the artists who have appealed to the V. M. P. A. to Invent some it) stem which win give an act a chance to ascertain whether now material is i.p to vaudevil' stand- ards before the a.tist is asked to pay retainers, in addition to the ad- ditional outlaj for special scenery and costur.ies when necessary. The vaudeville bookers' have been aware of the worthlcssness of the material for a ong time ai.d have often advised standard acts against producing ^ new turn for that rea- son. They prefer to play the old one to taking a chance on an un- known quantity. This has restilt« d in |ht similar- ity of acts complained so mo h about and the numbers of act* that go along year in and year out with- out changing a xintf'.e line. One of vaudeville's best known character comedians has wanted to experi- ment with a new Vehicle for the past two seasons, but has 1 en ad- vised agXlnst it by the booking men. The \"gypping authors\" in many Instances are said to wo-k hand in glove with cosu era and scenic artists. The author writes an act < ailing for special scenery and new., costumes, then recommends cer- tain costumeri and scenery out- fitters from whom he collect a com- mission. A suggestion luafcad upon with favor by the V. M. P. A. is to aMot a' trial period to a new act of about four weeks in which time the ar- tist will be enabled to ascertain just what his new vehicle amounts to. If the artist decides to con- tinue with the act, the V. M. P. A. will see that the author is paid in full f »r the number of weeks worked if on a royalty basis, and in the event it is an outright sale, will also protect the writer. If th« act after the month's ex- periment finds the turn is not going 1 o be acceptable to the vaudeville bookers, he is to be at lilwrt.y to return the act to the author with a royalty charge based upon the ac- tual time worked. The \"advance royalty'' for ma- terial that is unseen until deliv- ered is labelled as the worst form of gypping with which modern vaudeville artists have to contend, ft is discouraging the production of new acts, thereby hurting vaudeville bills l.y too mj ny \"repeats\" with the public clamoring for new ■material each season. Braves Field, Boston, will open Monday, June 27. as a popular priced vaudeville and picture out- door amusement and dancing center.

There must be some effeminate trait in me that never came out before. It's a shame for me to stand up here and admit that, but I'm crying now, and a real man wouldn't do that. \"I'm going away from here with the sweetest feelings in the world for all of you. If I .nought that my going would make the slightest dif- ference to the show, or would stop its run, or knock any of you out of work, 1 wouldn't leave. You know that. 'Von know, I'm not a Christian, but I'm a gentile, aaid every gen- tile has his pet Jew. It seems mighty strange that of all the Jews in the world Mr. Ziegfeld should pick my pet Jew to con\\c in h^re and take my place. That's Eddie Cantor. He's my pet, and I'm mighty glad he's coming in. You folks know that my family Is out there in California, and my kids, and I want to go back for their sake.

Albert de Courville had engaged the Astaires and Williams and Wolf us for his Empire show while in New York, but both teams failed to sail for London. Williams and Wolf us are an unknown \"quantity here, but the Astaires can now write their own ticket. The colored players of \"Plantation Days\" returned from London last week. Only some of the company were aboard the Cedric. third-class, while at least six arrived on the Majestic, first class. Leanord Harper, of Harper & Blanks, who originally organized the show for Jimmy O'Neill in Chi- cago, displayed a receipt from the Cunard Line for 23 pounds 10 shil- lings, the difference paid between first and third class. He explained Sir Alfred Butt's contract called for return transportation without stip- ulation as to what class passage was to be supplied. The \"Plantation\"' company played but 15 minutes in the Butt-de Cour- ville show \"Rainbow,\" the main ob- ject of the revue appearance being to advertise the \"Plantation\" cafe, which never opened. The authori- ties refused to pass the decorations because of failure to tireproof the materials. O'Neil and Irving Tish- man, who had the colored show, are credited with having made about $800 weekly on the- contract. They received $3,000 for \"Plantation Days,\" the total overhead of which, including commissions, was about $2,200. , \"From Dover Street to Dixie,\" the C B. Cochran revue, which will have Florence Mills and the show from the Plantation Cabaret, New York, was billed to open in London this week.

These new oombos are mainly recruited from Shubert units, members of the act splitting in order to lose their identity as former \"Shubert* acts'* And securing new faces as partners. One male member purposely joined a Brooklyn, N. Y., amateur theatrical organization, something heretofore despised by him, al- though in his Immediate residential neighborhood, and after a month's watchful waiting, proposed a promising, young woman for a vaudeville possibility. The hard- boiled author doing the skit en- thuses over possibility A number of authors admit their Indebtedness for advance royalties and tasks of writing to order over the summer to the flopping of the Shubert unit style of entertain- ment. Last year it was the reverse. Standard acts that ordinarily would have needed new material for the past season on the big time did not bother to rejuvenate their stuff for the Shuberts, deeming it sufficient and tried. Now, with many aiming for a comeback, every means is being resorted to, starting with an absolute new act. A veteran vaudeville writer, who has been a trouper for years before taking to the typewriter profes- sionally, conservatively states this presages a betterment as concerns vaudeville generally. ORGANIST WEDS RUTH DENNIS St. Louis, June, 6. The marriage of Ruth Dennis (Dennis Sisters) to Stuart Barrie took place June 4 in Clayton, Mo. The bridegroom is featured organist at the Missouri Theatre, St. Louis. Their romance started about three years ago when Barrie was organist at the Chicago Theatre, Chicago. Shortly after the meeting Barrie came to St. Louis and did not again see Miss Dennis until she with her sisters appeared here at the Grand Central, about four weeks ago. The friendship was renewed. The sis- ters played the Central two weeks, then left to fill other engagements. Ruth returned Monday morning. Barrie recently was divorced on the ground of desertion by the widow of George S. Nixon, former multi-millionaire United States Senator of Nevada. Last October, when Barrie accepted services of notice of the divorce suit, he stated he left his wife because she failed to install a $50,000 organ in their home as she promised.

HARRY COOPER RETIRING Popular Comic Taking up Life Insurance. i Vaudeville is losing In Harry Cooper one of its most popular com- edians. Mr. Cooper has taken up the sale of life insurance, a voca- tion his extended acquaintance and popularity naturally equips him for. Of the original Empire City Quar- tet, Harry (not Harry L. Cooper) for years enjoyed the fayor of the highest class vaudeville. He was known throughout the confines of the states. Upon the dissolution of the quartet, Mr. Cooper reap- peared In vaudeville as a single act, often taking dips Into production work. TWO SUMMER SHOWS CLOSING THIS WEEK Where Kilbane Trained The report that Johnny Kilbane, who was supposed to have trained for the Criqui bout at Summit, N. J., did not do so is confirmed by a $1,000 action which Mary Greene has instituted against the ex-feath- er-weight champ. Miss Greene, who Is an indepen- dent booking agent, claims that amount as damages for erecting a ring and establishing training quar- ters for the. battler, of which Kil- bane did not avail himself.

The days when the greatest stars on the stage jaxzed up the old street have given way to sedate) business men and thoughts of dollars and cents. The days of the old Vaudeville Con\\edy Club, when George Cohan and Willie Collier led the> procession, have passed. I remember one night Dick Carle and myself hired a couple of hacks at 4 o'clock In the morning and raced them around Columbus circle, while Cohan sat in the window of Chllds' and was the judge. Now Cohan is a country gentleman and Sam Harris is a big manager. Guess Felix Adler and I will have to reform.\" The \"Dew Drop Inn\" company is still laughing at the result of an argument between one of the delicate chorus boys In the show and a stage hand. The latter socked the former, and the chorus boy rushed out In the street and dragged In the traffic cop from 45th street, \"Do you want him arrested?\" asked the cop. \"Oh, no,\" said the victim, '1 want you to make him apologize.* The Broadway comic needed a shave. It looked as If he was starting a beard. Rubbing his chin, he said, \"I think I'll give up the Hou*** \"-< David. That guy's wrong, anyway.\" Two of the three Columbia wheel shows playing summer engagement I will close Saturday. They arc the Jlmmfe Cooper \"Beauty ri.vue\" which winds up a five weeks run at the Ca ino, Boston, and the Dave Marion show which stops at the Columbia, New York. The Barney Gerard show \"Follies of the Day\" continues at the Gayety, Boston. It had been the original inten- tion of the Marion show to con- tinue for at leas: another week at the Columbia, and negotiations had practically been completed for the appearance of Eva Ttttiguay as an extra attraction. A sudden rush of hot weather this week changed the decision U> continue, and the Tanguay date was called off. This week Is the fifth of the show's Co- lumbia engagement. La*t week the Marlon sh-v/ did around $5,900 at the Columbia, with Mike McTlgue, the light heavy- weight champion, as an added at- traction. The. previous week the Marion show did $5,700. The Sil- ver Jubilee looked upon to help business failed to live up to expec- tations. The Cooper show in Boston ' ist week did around $6,1000. Cooper was ordered to take 9 rest by his physician, his vocal c' rds going back on him a couple of weeks ago. Hot weather hit the Boston businc j a whack last week, and the urrent week's business it Is expected will drop much lower than any week of the run. G< rd's \"Follies\" at the Gayety, Boston, did approxl: itely $5,900 last week. The show is running along at an even pace, and will likely h Id out for some tl.-.ie un- less the weather conditions grow worse. The closing of the Mariori show at the Columbia, means the house will close. There is a remote pos- sibility' the Columbia might re-open again in two or tr ee v/eekj vith the Gerard \"Follies\" aa the attrac- tion, but nothing definite has been settled. Jack Wilson gave a \"house warming\" at his new apartment on 86th street a few nights ago. His guests were many, and distinguished. Eddie Darling was there, and Edgar Allan Wolf, and Lou Tellegen, all dressed up. Will Morrissey entertained a policeman from the corner, a fello#- Irishman, who fell asleep on his stories at 8 o'clock in the morning. Mile. Juliet was there, and Reed Albee, and La Sylflhe. together with Pansy Maness and Hasel Jennings of the \"Follies,\" and Bert Savoy. The warm weather is making it an open season in more ways than one, for the gang which hangs out at 50fh street and Seventh avenue, and the conductors and motormen at the barn across the street have a great time laying off. The reason for it is the desire of the Winter Garden chorus girls for fresh air. They open the windows these warm evenings and make trouble for the police, who have to chase the crowds away from the opposite sides of the street. The girls don't know they have an un- profitable audience, or else don't care. A few nights ago the police had to disperse a crowd of 200. But the tenants In the Earl Carroll theatre building are seriously considering renting night privileges, with the use of opera glasses. It seems the girls simply won't keep their windows shut. It seems to be a choice between revelation or suffocation — and they like fresh air. Eddie Cantor looked gloomy as \"O Creamy San'' was being played at the Lambs' Gambol. Four young gentlemen, dressed In elaborate Jap- anese kimonas, were disporting themselves more or less gracefully about the stage. \"They should send those kimonas out to be refilled,\" said Eddie. It was a night of closings and goodbys on Broadway Saturday. The party the stage crew of the Amsterdam gave Will Rogers topped every- thing else. John Steele got a big send-off from the \"Music Box\" com- pany, and took the same train as Rogers did Sunday for Chicago, where he opened Monday at McVlcker's. Steele will play Los Angeles and San Francisco, and return to the new show in the fall. The Moscow Art The- atres closed also. Everybody kissed everybody else, and all kissed Mor- ris Gest. so he fled to the shelter of the Will Rogers party at the Amster- dam, where he found all the girls crying and kissing Will Rogers. Eddie Dowllng closed in \"Sally, Irene and Mary,\" after almost a year on Broad- way. He sails for France shortly with Murray Hulburt on the \"Paris.** In the fall he will take out his show again and do another one, he has written, called \"Whistling Tim,\" at matinees. Eddie Buxzell also left \"The Gingham Girl\" last week after an all-season run on Broadway. Will Page, rotund publicity director for Zlegfeld, stood in the lobby of the Earl Carroll Theatre Sunday night as Jack Haszard came by, wear- ing a huge clown hat, a broadbrlmmed straw affair. Will tossed a ribald remark in the general direction of the comic, and got this reply. \"Lay off that hat. I wore that In shows long before you were even/ a press agent, to say nothing of a publicity director.\" The Lambs razzed themselves in a couple of spots at that Gambol. In one scene a detective turned to one of the members in a sketch and said, \"Your prospective son-in-law Is a movie actor, not a crook.\" \"Perhaps it would -have been better had he remained a crook,\" came the answer.

S. Bentham has the act. Harry Puck replaced Johns in \"Jack and Jill\" Tuesday night. The show closes Saturday at the Globe. Two years ago Belle Rutland was an established single with a beautiful soprano voice. She suddenly lost it, and spent a whole year and all her money trying to regain it. Nothing was effective, and she took a position with Nat Lewis. She worked hard, and Is now In entire charge of his professional department. Her voice suddenly returned, stronger and bet- ter than ever, but Miss Rutland prefers to stick to her new business. A chorus girl in White's \"Scandals\" dashed hurriedly out of the Al- gonquin dining room. She dropped something, something light which fluttered to the floor. A waiter, passing, picked it up and chased her through the lobby, holding the delicate fabric at arm's length. Every- body looked. The girl took the article, confused. It was a pair of green silk bloomers. Ruth White and her sister, Lillian, have been two of the best known of Dillingham chorus girls for several years. Both retired from shows last fall, and Ruth, one of the prettiest girls on Broadway, developed a re- markable ability to sew lamp shades and pillows. She has saved enough money to go to Europe, and sailed this week with Lillian, for a summer abroad, with a two months' stay in Paris, studying voice. Ruth had been signed for pictures by Max Kargerjust before that director's sudden death. Ruth says she'll go back to the stage only when she can go back as a principal. Meantime her unique ability has given her a comfortable livelihood.

Foreign, including Canada, $2L0Qu r VAUDEVILLE Thursday, June 7, 1928 HORWITZ FRANCHISE REVOKED, AGENT LIABLE FOR CONTEMPT Loew's Booking Chief Cancels Horwitz* Office — Secured Transportation on Credit — Wife Wins in Court Proceedings The Loew office this week revoked the booking franchise held by Arthur J. Horwitz following further evidence of his irregular business methods. J. H. Lubin, Loew booking chief, issued the ultimatum Tuesday after complaint had been made to the Loew people that Horwitz had se- cured two tickets from a railroad for California and Chicago. The tickets were advanced by the rail- road people on account of Horwitz' connection with the Iibew office an an agent. Horwitz' flight from jurisdiction hereabouts is the culmination of a series of incidents that completed the wreck of one of the most pros- perous of the independent small time vaudeville agencies in Greater New York. Coming here* from Chi- cago he formed a partnership with Lee Kraus which developed into the largest local independent agency. After a year or so Horwitz split with Kraus, both attempting to op- erate alone, with disastrous results. Kraus rejoined Horwitz a short time ago, just in time to witness the final disintegration of the remains of the once prosperous Horwitz & Kraus combination. Mrs. Edythe Livingston-Horwitz's motion to punish Arthur J. Horwitz, the Loew agent, for contempt for failure to pay his alimony regularly was granted by New York Supreme Court Justice Lehman this week. An order for Horwitz's arrest has been issued but cannot be served before Thursday (today) because of the regular court procedure neces- sary to settle an order. Horwitz is reported having cleaned out his Loew Annex building office, includ- ing all ledgers and accounts. The agent opposed the motion on the ground his wife agreed to accept $125 weekly for the summer season instead of the $200 a week allowed her by court order. Horwitz is $2,112.50 in arrears. This was Arthur's last legal stand in his divorce imbroglio with his wife. The trial of the action is due shortly, having been on the calendar for some weeks. Benjamin F. Spell - man still is Mrs. Horwitz's attorney. The defendant has gone through six law offices unsuccessfully in the course of his defense. Judgment for over $1,200 on a $1,410 loan due Dwight W. Fisher, owner of a circus act, was entered this week against Arthur J. Hor- witz-Lee Kraus, Inc., and Horwitz individually. The defendants bor- rowed the money from Fisher, who was routed over the Pan time by the Horwitz-Kraus agency and only received $228.57 in return. Another judgment for $47.09 has been entered against Horwitz per- sonally by the Graphic Photo En- graving Co., Inc. MAE and ROSE WILTON \"Talented Vocalists'* What tho HuffRlo \"Courier\" said: \"Tho gifted Wilson sisters, talented vocnlihts, who popsesa that valued a»set for • singer, a regard for correct pitch, and who have, really beautiful voices, sing a regular program, lengthened by a demand for extras, with comedy hits that win enthusiastic applause.\" Playing B.

Albee came to Rochester last week to inspect the Temple, which the Keith interests • recently pur- chased, with the Detroit Temple, from J. H. Moore. Previous to his visit it was not entirely settled that the house would not be available for a stock company. Earlier in the season Vaughan G laser had tried to rent it for the summer, but receiv- ing no encouragement he went to Mr. Albcc expressed dissatisfac- tion with the condition of the house and decided to redecorate it at once. He was scheduled to go from Roch- ester to Syracuse, but telephoned to the latter city cancelling the en- gagement and left for New York to confer with his architects and deco- rators. It is still undecided whether J. II. \"Mickey\" Finn will be con- tinued as manager. A decision is expected soon. The custom of telling an act Wednesday night where it goes Thursday is stil' being practised in the Fox booking office, and is be- ing severely criticized by the ar- tists. Acts playing the Fox time are, in most cases, booked for three days at a time. The usual practice accord- ing to the act is to inform the act Wednesday or Sunday night where it plays the following half week. According to the acts this leaves the Fox reople in a posi-'oii where they can quickly dispense with the services of an act if a cheaper turn is suddenly available. It also makes it possible for the Fox people to induce an act to cut salary for the following week because the act has no chance to fill in the time else- where on such short notice. Some acts receive blanket con- tracts for the entire Fox time, but they are also subject to the Wednes- day and Sunday night notice, ac- cording to the acts. VAUDEVILLE, ONLY, FOR ACKERMAN & HARRIS Releasing Theatres With Oth- er Policies — Century and Casino Go to Others San Francisco, June 6. Ackerman & Harris are forfeiting their leases on the Casino and Cen- tury theatres here and will confine their activities solely to the chain of vaudeville theatres that bears their name. In other cities, with the exception of two, Ackerman & Harris like- wise will relinquish houses main- tained other than' for vaudeville purposes. The two exceptions are the Century, Oakland, where Russell and his musical comedy company are playing, and the Heillg, Seatle, now housing Will King's musical comedy aggregation. The new policy was ordered into effect this week. The Century reverts to Louis Lurle, who plans to run it as a straight picture theatre. The Casino goes back to G. M. (Bronco Billy) Anderson, who al- ready is preparing a musical revue to be staged there. \"Our future activities,\" said Sam Harris, in discussing the matter, \"will be confined entirely to vaude- ville. We are no longer to be in- terested in any way with houses that play pictures or other attrac- tions with the exception of the Russell company in Oakland and the King company in Seattle.\" 12 IN OHIO Keith's Building House in Columbus Will Seat 3,500 A new Keith house to seat 3,500 with office building and stores is to be built in Columbus, O., on West Broad street by the Keith Circuit before next season. E. F. Albee, J. J. Murdock and Senator Walters completed all ar- rangements with the American In- surance Union for the erection of the house on their recent trip west. The Insurance Union is to erect the office building and the Keith people the theatre. A 13-story office building and a five-story building, housing the theatre are planned. It will be the largest structure in Columbus on the block that now contains the Colonial, A. L. U. and other build- ings. The latest Keith super-house will give the Keith Circuit 12 theatres of modern construction in the state of Ohio. MISS KERSHAW HERE Legit Star Without Any Intention of Leaving The cabled report from abroad that Willette Kershaw might mnke London her home has no basis. It may have been inspired through a possible visit Miss Kershaw will make to the other side this season. The star will retain her perma- nent residence In New York and will appear over here in a new play next season. KEITH'S MIDDLE-WESTERN BOOKINGS CHANGED ABOI Reported Glen Burt Will Not Return to Keith'i Booking Staff — Features to Be Booked Out ol New York Office JUDGE URGES HARMONY; NO. 802 LOSES DECISION Court Upholds Membership in Both Musical Organi- zations The test case of Benjamin Berko- witz, a trap drummer, against Ed- ward Canavan, * chairman of the board of directors of Local 902, has resulted in a victory for the Mu- sical Mutual Protective Union. The decision of Justice Lazan- sky in the Queens County Su- preme Court grants Berkowitz an injunction restraining Canavan from suspending members of M. M. P. U. Berkowitz, like many other musicians, is a member of both or- ganizations. His grievance is that whe.n he appeared before Canavan to pay up his quarterly dues and 25 per cent, penalty for b'Bing in ar- rears, Canavan refused to accept the money unless Berkowitz paid a $10 fine and resigned his member- ship in the M.M.P.U. The M.M.P.U., organized in 1864, carries with it certain valuable privileges such as death benefits and relief for indigent members, owning over $1,000,000 worth of property. Local 802 controls the metropolitan employment situation as concerns dance hall and theatre work. Practically every musician is a member of both bodies. The non- recognition of a musician by the local practically ostracizes a player from any union orchestra and de- stroys his means of securing a live- lihood. One musician in a parallel situation to that of Berkowitz held a* 21 weeks' contract as cellist with the Chicago Opera Co., which he could not fulfil without a Local 802 membership card. The decision by Justice Lazansky reinstates all musicians suspended by 802 a short time ago. The jurist in a lengthy opinion advises both bodies to get together*and adjust their differences, stating It looks much like an argument between two labor leaders at the expense of the members. He concludes: \"Well might one interested in the welfare of the members of these organiza- tions, reading the papers, exclaim to the leaders of both organizations, 'a plague o' both the houses.\" It would be sensible, indeed, if a truce were declared and the members per- mitted to play their parts In har- mony.\" HOUSES CLOSING Sheridan, East Liverpool, O., closes June 25 for repairs.

Under pressure of the heat wave five vaudeville theatres closed Sat- urday in Philadelphia, and three more will join the dark group at the end of this week. Starting next week, the only vaudeville houses lighted will be Keith's, Nixon and the Globe. It is doubtful if the Nixon will attempt summer con- tinuance. Pell's, Bridgeport.

When the houses switched froi. Chicago to New York, Burt came east to book several of the small] time houses in conjunction witL Collins and Dempsey. The KeitbJ people wanted to consolidate the bookings of all of the middle west- ern houses to avoid repeats in the towns and to route acts for the entire time. Burt has been associated with the Keith organization for ten years, during which time his activities as a booker were confined to Chicago. Arthur Denman. it is reported, may succeed Glen Burt in Chicago. NEW \"FAMILY\" TITLE Keith's Office Will Find Anoth< Name for Small Tims Division The present name of the \"Fam- ily Department\" of the Keith office, as that division has been called since its Inception about 16 years ago, will be changed shortly. The name \"Family\" came about through the small time houses of the perod of 1907-8 and thereabouts catering to family trade, with the j theatres being dubbed \"family the* atres.\" The Sullivan-Considine cir- cuit was the first to use the tlWe, Since then the field has widened and the name has outgrown its original meaning. Just what the new name of the Keith small time booking dlvison will be has not be*n decided, but t is definite the Family name will be dropped.

Members of the \"Girls a la Carte\" company, stranded and sweating in the heat of one of the most torrid days Cincinnati has ever expe- rienced, were impatiently waiting for their salaries from the Mutual Burlesque Wheel. The People's Theatre, where they played here last week. cloBed Saturday, following an attachment levied on every tangi- ble object, to satisfy a claim for $443.25 made by the Runey Show Print Co. of this city. Simultaneous attachments were made for the fol- lowing urnoi nts at these houses: — Broadway Theatre, Indianapolis. %i 10.3J: Gaycty. Louisvll!?, *2S0.1«; New Kmpirc. Cleveland, $225.75; Garden Theatre. Buffalo. $M. The Indianapolis and Louisville houses closed some days ago. The plain- tiff In each case was the ltuney company. Joseph Jermon, manager of Peo- ple's, told the actors they would be paid at 1 o'clock Monday. At that j hour the money was not forthcom- ing, so Jermon promised they would get it tomorrow. The delay, he said, was due to the fact that executives of the Mutual had been in New York attending a meeting of wheel chiefs and wer*» unable to sign checks at headquarters in Cleveland. The Runey company not only tied up the box office receipts at People's but seized the scenery, costumes and baggage of the company. Benny Moore and Busby Nate are stars of the troupe. At the headquarters of the Mutual Burlesque Wheel in New York it wa9 stated the \"Girls a la Carte.\" which played at the People's. Cin- cinnati, last week was not a Mutual wheel show, and that the Mutual wneel had nothing to do with its management. The title. \"Girls a la Carte.\" was used by another show on the Mutual wheel it was said, earlier in the season. The Mutual season closed several weeks ago, the Mutual wheel rep- resentative in New York said, and the Mutual circuit had no connec- tion in any way with the \"Girls a la Carte\" at the People's, Cin- cinnati. The Burlesque Club of America will hold its annual meeting and election of officers at its ciubrooms on 44th street, New York, Thursday, June 14. at 8:50 p. m. Considerable controversy has arisen over the question of whether the \"opposition.\" which nominated five candidates for the board of gov- ernors can withdraw the nomina- tions. These were made -y petition in the usual way, the five candi- dates being Dan Dody. Phil Dalton, Lou Reals, Wm. S. Clark and Meyer Harris, for two years, and Henry Kurtzman for one year. The board of governors' candi- dates were nominated a couple of weeks ago. Otherwise tie regular and opposition tickets are identical, with Bobby Clark, nominee for president; John G. Jermon, vice- president; James C. Sutherland, treasurer; Harry Rudder, financial secretary, and Lou Lesser, record- ing secretary. John G. Jermon was a member of the board of governors at the time the nominations for both tickets were made, but a couple of days ago resigned from the board, due to his candidacy for the vice-nresi- dency.

SMALLER CITIES LOCATED OLYMPIC SET Columbia's Now Chisago House with Jake Isaacs, Manager NO MIDNIGHT SHOW Only $30 in House When Columbia Called It Off. The scheduled midnight show to have been g^ven by the Dave Marion show at the Columbia. New York, last Wednesday was called off at 11:50. At that hour there was about $30 in the house. As the stage hands and musicians were ready for work, the latter had to be paid an extra one-twelfth pro rata of a week's salary, in accord- ance with the stage union's rules. Wednesday was a generally ob- served holiday in Now York last week, being Memorial Day, or Dec- oration Day. Considerable bally- hooing was done by the Columbia announcing the midnight show. The failure of the midnight idea to take hold for burlesque in New York as it lias in Boston, where the Casino baa packed 'em in with an early morning matinee for the last three weeks, means the abandon- ment of the idea as far as the Co- lumbia. New York, is concerned. Last Wednesday's proposed mid- night show was to have been in the nature of an experiment, and if showing anything at all would have been the means of starting the mid- night thing >;oing here.
