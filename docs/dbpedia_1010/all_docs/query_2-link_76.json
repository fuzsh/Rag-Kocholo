        "text": "Forever Young BBL™ therapy is an advanced version of intense pulsed light (IPL) technology. Research at Stanford University has shown that people who have had two or more Forever Young BBL™ treatments each year have actually reversed the signs of aging skin, and the skin cells behave more like young cells. This means that they produce more elastin and collagen than aged cells.\n\nFor years, IPL has been used for cosmetic and medical procedures to improve the appearance of skin for aesthetic and therapeutic purposes. It is used for hair removal and rejuvenation of skin that has sun damage, thread veins and hyper-pigmentation.\n\nForever Young BBL™ is an advanced IPL technique used to treat or slow down damaged facial skin, as well as skin problems on other parts of the body, including the chest, arms, neck and hands. Because of the broadband light technology, it is the most effective form of IPL skin therapy.\n\nThe procedure is performed by trained technicians. Unlike laser technology that uses only one color wave, Forever Young BBL™ uses various wavelengths that treat a variety of issues. The light modifies the molecular structure of damaged cells and stimulates the body’s natural healing process.\n\nSun-damaged skin and other brown spots are pushed to the surface and naturally flake off over time. It also treats diffused redness and broken capillaries.\n\nAfter the treatment, the skin has a more even color and texture, looks brighter and feels softer. When collagen is stimulated, it works to thicken the skin, creating a more youthful and healthy appearance.\n\nUnhealthy ultraviolet rays from the sun cause damage to the deep layers of skin, not only on the surface. It depletes collagen levels, but also alters the DNA of the skin cells. This results in changes of skin texture, uneven pigmentation loss of elasticity and, in some cases, skin cancer.\n\nThe Stanford University study showed that Forever Young BBL™ treatments might restore the gene pattern of aged skin to resemble young, healthy skin. The collagen deposits become uniform, and the elasticity is improved. Along with sun-damaged skin, other skin conditions that Forever Young BBL™ can treat are:\n\n• Rosacea\n\n• Acne\n\n• Freckles\n\n• Mild acne scars\n\n• Uneven pigmentation\n\n• Dull skin\n\n• Age spots\n\n• Liver spots\n\nAfter a consultation with our expert at ProMD Health, you can plan for Forever Young BBL™ therapy. Recovery time is minimal, but we recommend that you have therapy, at least, seven days before a big event. The number of treatments will depend on your particular condition.\n\nWith locations in Annapolis, Arlington, or Baltimore, ProMD Health proudly offers Forever Young BBL™ treatments as an effective way for patients to say goodbye to aging skin. We can evaluate your situation and determine if this incredible therapy treatment is right for you. Contact us today to schedule your appointment.\n\nBeginning as a pre-med major, Ashley transitioned to nursing in 2009 with a clear goal of entering the aesthetics industry. Since then, she has relentlessly pursued this ambition. After earning a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) from the University of Delaware in 2014, she dedicated eight years to working as a Registered Nurse in both bedside care and the operating room, all the while striving to delve deeper into aesthetics. Despite facing setbacks, she took the bold step of launching her own practice while concurrently pursuing a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) at Maryville University, successfully completing her studies in 2023. A pivotal moment arose when Ashley seized the opportunity to become an independent injector at Attitudes Medi Spa in Milford, DE, a move that marked a significant breakthrough in her career journey, allowing her to realize a long-held aspiration.\n\nAshley places a high value on her education, continuously refining her skills through mentorship from leading figures in the aesthetics field. She has traversed the nation, seeking knowledge from some of the most reputable aesthetic providers. Now, as a Certified Registered Nurse Practitioner (CRNP) in healthcare, Ashley steps into her new role armed with a wealth of experience and expertise.\n\nMario is the Chief Growth Officer of ProMD Health and is primarily responsible for driving the growth of the ProMD Development Group by launching new franchise locations and identifying opportunities to strategically grow ProMD’s footprint nationwide.
