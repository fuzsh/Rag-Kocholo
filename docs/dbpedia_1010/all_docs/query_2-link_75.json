        "text": "Mitch Marsh has been awarded the Allan Border Medal in front of an all-star cast during cricket's most glamorous night of the year at the Australian Cricket Awards in Melbourne.\n\nIn the women's game, Ashleigh Gardner scooped the Belinda Clark Award for the second time in her career after another stellar year.\n\nMitch Marsh wins Allan Border Medal at Australian Cricket Awards 2024\n\n\"I thought I was done and dusted,\" an emotional Marsh said at the podium.\n\nMORE: Race to World Test Championship Final 2025 - Latest updated WTC points table\n\nMarsh returned to the Test side after a four-year absence to play a starring role for the Aussies in the third Ashes Test in England.\n\nHe blasted a century in that match and hasn't looked back since, as he's gone on to average 66 with the bat while also claiming five wickets during a brilliant year for the national side in red-ball cricket.\n\nHis confidence at an all-time high, Marsh also made some stunning ODI contributions as Australia went on to claim the World Cup with the all-rounder belting two centuries in the tournament.\n\n\"I often spoke to my wife and told her that I just wanted to get one more crack at it, and it's been amazing,\" Marsh said.\n\n\"I hope me winning this isn't like Covid and we look back in three years time and think, 'that was a weird time'.\"\n\nPrior to the ceremony, Marsh was touted by many as the favourite to claim the prestigious medal after impressing throughout the year.\n\n\" I'd love to see Mitchy get it,\" Pat Cummins - who was also in the frame for the award - said before the winner was announced.\n\n\"He's banged down the door and demanded a spot in all three formats.\"\n\nThe skipper was named as one of three finalists alongside Marsh and four-time recipient of the Allan Border Medal, Steve Smith.\n\nAustralia's new Test opener had a shot at history with a win as he could have become the first man to pick up five Allan Border Medals to take him above fellow former captains Michael Clarke and Ricky Ponting, who also sit on four medals.\n\nHowever, Marsh topped the count with 223 votes, with Cummins polling 144 and Smith 141.\n\nAsh Gardner wins her second Belinda Clark Award\n\nMeanwhile, Gardner beat out competition from Ellyse Perry and Annabel Sutherland to win the Belinda Clark Award.\n\nThe all-rounder, who previously won the award in 2022, was named Player of the Tournament in the womenâ€™s T20 World Cup as she claimed ten wickets at 12.50 and scored 110 runs.\n\nHer crowning achievement for the year coming during the Ashes Test at Trent Bridge when she made history with 12 wickets for the match.\n\nGardner won 147 votes to take home the award with Perry not far behind on 134 and Sutherland rounding out the top three with 106 votes.\n\nAustralian Cricket Awards 2024 results\n\nEarlier in the night, Cameron Bancroft put the disappointment of missing out on Test selection behind him by claiming the Men's Domestic Cricketer of the Year award.\n\nThe opener was rewarded for his fine form in Sheffield Shield, as he notched 299 runs at 49.83.\n\n\"I'm really proud to receive this prestigious award,\" the 31-year-old said.\n\n\"To be recognised by other players around the country is very special and I feel honoured.\n\n\"There have been a lot of great players win this award and in years gone by, they were the players I've looked up to and aspired to.\n\n\"The award is a recognition of a lot of hard work, and a nice checkpoint to keep working towards what I want to achieve in cricket.\"\n\nElsewhere, Sophie Day and Elyse Villani were unable to be split as the duo were jointly awarded the Women's Domestic Cricketer of the Year award.\n\n\"It's something a little bit unexpected - to be voted by my peers means a lot to me,\" Day said after starring for Victoria and the Melbourne Stars.\n\n\"Cricket is a roller coaster and having unwavering support throughout my career has allowed me to continue to love this wonderful game and for that, I will be forever grateful,\" Villani said as she thanked her family and friends for their support.\n\nIn the Big Bash League, it was another night to remember for opener Matthew Short as he bagged the Player of the Tournament award for the second consecutive year after starring for the Adelaide Strikers with 541 runs.\n\nIt completed a successful night for the Victorian, who was also named captain of the BBL Team of the Tournament.\n\n\" Getting the opportunity a few years ago at the top of the order is something I'm really grateful for and something that really took off and suits my game,\" the 28-year-old said.\n\n\"A lot of hard work has been put in for this moment and I'm really looking forward to the opportunities I'm getting in the next couple of weeks in the Australian team.\"\n\nChamari Athapaththu won the WBBL|09 award, which was revealed last year, after the Sri Lankan starred for Sydney Thunder.\n\nAustralian Cricket Awards 2024 results: Full list of winners\n\nAllan Border Medalist -
