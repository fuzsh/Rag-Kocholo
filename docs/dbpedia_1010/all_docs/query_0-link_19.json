It remains unclear, however, whether activity of the mirror neuron system is also associated with the observer's motor experience in sports game. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate differences in activation of the mirror neuron system during action observation between experts and non-archer control subjects. We used video of Western-style archery in which participants were asked to watch the archery movements. Hyperactivation of the premotor and inferior parietal cortex in expert archers relative to non-archer control subjects suggests that the human mirror neuron system could contain and expand representations of the motor repertoire. The fact that dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was more active in expert archers than in non-archer control subjects indicates a spontaneous engagement of theory of mind in experts when watching video of Western-style archery. Compared with the non-archer control subjects, expert archers showed greater activation in the neural system in regions associated with episodic recall from familiar and meaningful information, including the cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus. The results demonstrate that expertise effects stimulate brain activity not only in the mirror neuron system but also in the neural networks related to theory of mind and episodic memory.

Archer's theory of reflexivity holds that conscious 'internal conversations' are the motor of society, central both to human subjectivity and to the 'reflexive imperative' of late modernity. This is established through critiques of Bourdieu, who is held to erase creativity and meaningful personal investments from subjectivity, and late modernity is depicted as a time when a 'situational logic of opportunity' renders embodied dispositions and the reproduction of symbolic advantages obsolete. Maintaining Archer's focus on 'ultimate concerns' in a context of social change, this paper argues that her theory of reflexivity is established through a narrow misreading and rejection of Bourdieu's work, which ultimately creates problems for her own approach. Archer's rejection of any pre-reflexive dimensions to subjectivity and social action leaves her unable to sociologically explain the genesis of 'ultimate concerns', and creates an empirically dubious narrative of the consequences of social change. Through a focus on Archer's concept of 'fractured reflexivity', the paper explores the theoretical necessity of habitus and illusio for understanding the social changes that Archer is grappling with. In late modernity, reflexivity is valorized just as the conditions for its successful operation are increasingly foreclosed, creating 'fractured reflexivity' emblematic of the complex contemporary interaction between habitus, illusio, and accelerating social change.

These injuries are mostly seen as muscle pain. The vast majority of injuries occur in training. In archers, shoulder, neck, and back areas should be more strengthened to reduce injuries. Extra warm-up programmes special to muscles in these sections should be especially applied in trainings and competitions. Shooting techniques are to be correctly applied.\n\nHydrodynamics of vertical jumping in Archer fish\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTechet, Alexandra H.; Mendelson, Leah\n\n2017-11-01\n\nVertical jumping for aerial prey from an aquatic environment requires both propulsive power and precise aim to succeed. Rapid acceleration to a ballistic velocity sufficient for reaching the prey height occurs before the fish leaves the water completely and experiences a thousandfold drop in force-producing ability. In addition to speed, accuracy and stability are crucial for successful feeding by jumping. This talk examines the physics of jumping using the archer fish as a model. Better known for their spitting abilities, archer fish will jump multiple body lengths out of the water for prey capture, from a stationary position just below the free surface. Modulation of oscillatory body kinematics and use of multiple fins for force production are identified as methods through which the fish can meet requirements for both acceleration and stabilization in limited space. Quantitative 3D PIV wake measurements reveal how variations in tail kinematics relate to thrust production throughout the course of a jumping maneuver and over a range of jump heights. By performing measurements in 3D, the timing, interactions, and relative contributions to thrust and lateral forces from each fin can be evaluated, elucidating the complex hydrodynamics that enable archer fish water exit.\n\nEspecial Skills in Experienced Archers.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNabavinik, Mahdi; Abaszadeh, Ali; Mehranmanesh, Mehrab; Rosenbaum, David A\n\n2017-09-05\n\nEspecial skills are skills that are distinctive by virtue of massive practice within the narrow contexts in which they are expressed. In the first demonstration of especial skills, Keetch, Schmidt, Lee, and Young (2005) showed that experienced basketball players are better at shooting baskets from the foul line, where they had massive amounts of practice, than would expected from their success at other locations closer to or farther from the basket. Similar results were obtained for baseball throwing. The authors asked whether especial skills hold in archery, a sport requiring less movement. If the emergence of especial skills depends on large-scale movement, one would expect archery to escape so-called especialism. But if the emergence of especial skills reflects a more general tendency for highly specific learning, experienced archers should show especial skills. The authors obtained evidence consistent with the latter prediction. The expert archers did much better at their most highly practiced distance than would be expected by looking at the overall function relating shooting score to distance. We offer a mathematical model to account for this result. The findings attest to the generality of the especial skills phenomenon.\n\nJustine user`s manual\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLee, S.R.\n\n1995-10-01\n\nJustine is the graphical user interface to the Los Alamos Radiation Modeling Interactive Environment (LARAMIE).

The poor prominence that for many centuries was granted to the archers in the warlike context, was going to give an unexpected draft with the explosion of the Persian Wars. Later, the playwright Euripides was going to turn Herakles, one of the most famous archer of the hellenic world, into the spokesman of the change that was going to bring with it the acceptance and the definitive incorporation of these soldiers as contingent of considerable value inside the greek armies.\n\nThe ARCHER project (Advanced High-Temperature Reactors for Cogeneration of Heat and Electricity R&D)\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKnol, S., E-mail: knol@nrg.eu [Nuclear Research and consultancy Group (NRG), PO Box 25, NL-1755 ZG Petten (Netherlands); FÃ¼tterer, M.A. [Joint Research Centre, Institute for Energy, Petten (Netherlands); Roelofs, F.

Here we examined the lingering effect of hot tub relaxation after training on performance-associated measures and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) in junior archers. Ten national level archers, aged 16.6 Â± 0.3 years (M = 8, F = 2), participated in a randomized counter-balanced crossover study after baseline measurements. In particular, half participants were assigned to the hot water immersion (HOT) group, whereas another halves were assigned to the untreated control (CON) group. Crossover trial was conducted following a 2-week washout period. During the HOT trial, participants immersed in hot water for 30 min at 40Â°C, 1 h after training, twice a week (every 3 days) for 2 weeks. Participants during CON trial sat at the same environment without hot water after training. Performance-associated measures and salivary DHEA-S were determined 3 days after the last HOT session. We found that the HOT intervention significantly decreased shooting performance (CON: -4%; HOT: -22%, P HOT: -16%, P HOT: -60%, P < 0.05) of archers, compared with untreated CON trial. No group differences were found in motor unit recruitment (root mean square electromyography, RMS EMG) of arm muscles during aiming, autonomic nervous activity (sympathetic and vagal powers of heart rate variability, HRV), and plasma cortisol levels after treatments. Our data suggest that physiological adaptation against heat exposure takes away the sources needed for normal training adaptation specific to shooting performance in archers.\n\nThe identification of high potential archers based on relative psychological coping skills variables: A Support Vector Machine approach\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTaha, Zahari; Muazu Musa, Rabiu; Majeed, A. P. P. Abdul; Razali Abdullah, Mohamad; Aizzat Zakaria, Muhammad; Muaz Alim, Muhammad; Arif Mat Jizat, Jessnor; Fauzi Ibrahim, Mohamad\n\n2018-03-01\n\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) has been revealed to be a powerful learning algorithm for classification and prediction. However, the use of SVM for prediction and classification in sport is at its inception. The present study classified and predicted high and low potential archers from a collection of psychological coping skills variables trained on different SVMs. 50 youth archers with the average age and standard deviation of (17.0 Â±.056) gathered from various archery programmes completed a one end shooting score test. Psychological coping skills inventory which evaluates the archers level of related coping skills were filled out by the archers prior to their shooting tests. k-means cluster analysis was applied to cluster the archers based on their scores on variables assessed. SVM models, i.e. linear and fine radial basis function (RBF) kernel functions, were trained on the psychological variables. The k-means clustered the archers into high psychologically prepared archers (HPPA) and low psychologically prepared archers (LPPA), respectively. It was demonstrated that the linear SVM exhibited good accuracy and precision throughout the exercise with an accuracy of 92% and considerably fewer error rate for the prediction of the HPPA and the LPPA as compared to the fine RBF SVM. The findings of this investigation can be valuable to coaches and sports managers to recognise high potential athletes from the selected psychological coping skills variables examined which would consequently save time and energy during talent identification and development programme.\n\nThe application of k-Nearest Neighbour in the identification of high potential archers based on relative psychological coping skills variables\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTaha, Zahari; Muazu Musa, Rabiu; Majeed, Anwar P.

Psychological coping skills inventory which evaluates the archers level of related coping skills were filled out by the archers prior to their shooting tests. k-means cluster analysis was applied to cluster the archers based on their scores on variables assessed k-NN models, i.e. fine, medium, coarse, cosine, cubic and weighted kernel functions, were trained on the psychological variables. The k-means clustered the archers into high psychologically prepared archers (HPPA) and low psychologically prepared archers (LPPA), respectively. It was demonstrated that the cosine k-NN model exhibited good accuracy and precision throughout the exercise with an accuracy of 94% and considerably fewer error rate for the prediction of the HPPA and the LPPA as compared to the rest of the models. The findings of this investigation can be valuable to coaches and sports managers to recognise high potential athletes from the selected psychological coping skills variables examined which would consequently save time and energy during talent identification and development programme.\n\nSugar Free with Justin T.: Diabetes Education through Community Partnerships\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nThomas, Justin B.; Donaldson, Joseph L.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis article describes the design, development, and delivery of an Extension community cable television program, \"Sugar Free with Justin T.,\" in Roane County, Tennessee.

EMG is used to detect muscle signals during any particular activity. There were two types of data recorded which were maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and archery activity. The skilled archer was found to produce 280 N of biceps brachii, 213.9 N of the deltoid, 123.4 N of trapezius forces compare to that of the recreational archer with 371.1 N, 164.9 N and 163.8 N, respectively for the draw arm during drawing phase. It is concluded that the recreational archer tends to a muscle fatigue phenomenon thus may contribute to possible serious injuries.\n\nARCHER, a new Monte Carlo software tool for emerging heterogeneous computing environments\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nXu, X.

Existing Monte Carlo codes and methods must be strategically upgraded to meet emerging hardware and software needs. In this paper, we describe the development of a software, called ARCHER (Accelerated Radiation-transport Computations in Heterogeneous EnviRonments), which is designed as a versatile testbed for future Monte Carlo codes.

The code treats an arbitrary three-dimensional configuration of materials in geometric cells bounded by first- and second-degree surfaces and fourth-degree elliptical tori. Justine is the graphical user interface and problem setup tool for the Los Alamos Radiation Modeling Interactive Environment (LARAMIE). Its purpose is to serve as a convenient and very general interface for setting up physics calculations and linking together the disparate radiation transport codes under a single front-end. Currently, the LARAMIE system includes MCNP and the deterministic transport code suit DANTSYS (ONEDANT, TWODANT, and THREEDANT, for one-, two-, and three-dimensional geometries, respectively). Justine is currently available through the Radiation Safety Information Computational Center to members of the criticality safety community for evaluation and use. The authors will demonstrate the capabilities of both codes for visualization of geometries and results from a variety of criticality problems\n\nThe Archer’s Tale: An Examination of English Archers during the Hundred Years War and Their Impact on Warfare and Society\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2015-06-12\n\nCOVERED (From - To) AUG 2014 â JUNE 2015 4.

However, the application of SVM for prediction and classification in specific sport has rarely been used to quantify/discriminate low and high-performance athletes. The present study classified and predicted high and low-potential archers from a set of fitness and motor ability variables trained on different SVMs kernel algorithms. 50 youth archers with the mean age and standard deviation of 17.0â¯Â±â¯0.6â¯years drawn from various archery programmes completed a six arrows shooting score test. Standard fitness and ability measurements namely hand grip, vertical jump, standing broad jump, static balance, upper muscle strength and the core muscle strength were also recorded. Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis (HACA) was used to cluster the archers based on the performance variables tested. SVM models with linear, quadratic, cubic, fine RBF, medium RBF, as well as the coarse RBF kernel functions, were trained based on the measured performance variables. The HACA clustered the archers into high-potential archers (HPA) and low-potential archers (LPA), respectively. The linear, quadratic, cubic, as well as the medium RBF kernel functions models, demonstrated reasonably excellent classification accuracy of 97.5% and 2.5% error rate for the prediction of the HPA and the LPA. The findings of this investigation can be valuable to coaches and sports managers to recognise high potential athletes from a combination of the selected few measured fitness and motor ability performance variables examined which would consequently save cost, time and effort during talent identification programme.

Methods: We have developed a nuclear medicine dosimetry module for the fast Monte Carlo code ARCHER. The coupled electron-photon Monte Carlo transport kernel included in ARCHER is built upon the Dose Planning Method code (DPM). The developed module manages the radioactive decay simulation by consecutively tracking several types of radiation on a per disintegration basis using the statistical sampling method. Optimization techniques such as persistent threads and prefetching are studied and implemented. The developed module is verified against the VIDA code, which is based on Geant4 toolkit and has previously been verified against OLINDA/EXM. A voxelized geometry is used in the preliminary test: a sphere made of ICRP soft tissue is surrounded by a box filled with water. Uniform activity distribution of I-131 is assumed in the sphere. Results: The self-absorption dose factors (mGy/MBqs) of the sphere with varying diameters are calculated by ARCHER and VIDA respectively. ARCHERâs result is in agreement with VIDAâs that are obtained from a previous publication. VIDA takes hours of CPU time to finish the computation, while it takes ARCHER 4.31 seconds for the 12.4-cm uniform activity sphere case. For a fairer CPU-GPU comparison, more effort will be made to eliminate the algorithmic differences. Conclusion: The coupled electron-photon Monte Carlo code ARCHER has been extended to radioactive decay simulation for nuclear medicine dosimetry. The developed code exhibits good performance in our preliminary test. The GPU-based Monte Carlo code is developed with grant support from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering through an R01 grant (R01EB015478)\n\nAbject Magic: Reasoning Madness in Justine Larbalestier's \"Magic or Madness\" Trilogy\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPotter, Troy\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis paper explores the representation of magic and madness in Justine Larbalestier's \"Magic or Madness\" trilogy (2005-2007).

However, the possibility of punishment of the co-players can result in antisocial punishment, the punishment of those players who contribute the most in the group. To better understand why antisocial punishment exists, it must be determined who are the anti-social punishers and who are their primary targets. Methods For resolving these questions we increased the number of players in a group from usual four to twelve. Each group played six rounds of the standard Public Goods Game and six rounds of the Public Goods Game with punishment. Each player in each round received 20 CZK ($ 1.25). Players (Nâ=â118) were rematched after each round so that they would not take into consideration opponents' past behavior. Results The amount of the punishment received correlated negatively with the contribution (Ïâ=ââ0.665, ppunishment obtained was U-shaped (R2â=â0.678, ppunishment was present in all groups, and in eight out of ten groups the Justine Effect (the positive correlation between the contribution to the public pool and the risk of suffering punishment in the subpopulation of altruistic players) emerged. In our sample, 22.5% subjects, all of them Free riders and low contributors, punished the altruistic players. Conclusions The results of our experimental game-study revealed the existence of the Justine effect â the positive correlation between the contribution to the public pool by a subpopulation of the most altruistic players, and the amount of punishment these players obtained from free-riders.

Justin Biddle argues that Longinoâs account presupposes individuals that are completely open to any criticism; as such individuals are in principle able to criticise their beliefs on their own, Longino's account is not really social. In the first part of my paper I argue that even for completely open individuals, criticism for maintaining objectivity is only possible in community. In the second part I challenge Biddleâs interpretation of Longinoâs conception of the individual. I conclude that Longinoâs account is necessarily social.\n\nQual capacidade crÃ­tica? Relendo Luc Boltanski Ã luz de Margaret Archer\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLuiz Augusto Campos\n\nFull Text Available Resumo A chamada âsociologia da capacidade crÃ­ticaâ de Luc Boltanski vem se tornando um dos principais paradigmas teÃ³ricos de interpretaÃ§Ã£o das relaÃ§Ãµes sociais. ContrÃ¡rio ao modo como a sociologia crÃ­tica Ã la Bourdieu entende a reflexividade humana, Boltanski propÃµe tratar os indivÃ­duos como seres reflexivos, plenamente capazes de julgar e criticar o mundo. No entanto, essa âcapacidade crÃ­ticaâ funciona em sua sociologia mais como premissa teÃ³rica do que como objeto concreto de investigaÃ§Ã£o. Diante disso, este texto argumenta que uma sociologia interessada na capacidade crÃ­tica dos sujeitos nÃ£o pode apenas âsupÃ´-laâ, deve constituÃ­-la em objeto de estudo sociolÃ³gico. Para tal, propÃµe-se reconceituar a capacidade crÃ­tica como competÃªncia reflexiva, no sentido dado Ã expressÃ£o pela sociÃ³loga inglesa Margaret Archer. O recurso Ã s categorias de Archer nÃ£o apenas ajuda a identificar os limites da sociologia de Boltanski, mas, sobretudo, permite ampliar o seu alcance.\n\nAn fMRI study of differences in brain activity among elite, expert, and novice archers at the moment of optimal aiming.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKim, Woojong; Chang, Yongmin; Kim, Jingu; Seo, Jeehye; Ryu, Kwangmin; Lee, Eunkyung; Woo, Minjung; Janelle, Christopher M\n\n2014-12-01\n\nWe investigated brain activity in elite, expert, and novice archers during a simulated archery aiming task to determine whether neural correlates of performance differ by skill level. Success in shooting sports depends on complex mental routines just before the shot, when the brain prepares to execute the movement. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 40 elite, expert, or novice archers aimed at a simulated 70-meter-distant target and pushed a button when they mentally released the bowstring. At the moment of optimal aiming, the elite and expert archers relied primarily on a dorsal pathway, with greatest activity in the occipital lobe, temporoparietal lobe, and dorsolateral pre-motor cortex. The elites showed activity in the supplementary motor area, temporoparietal area, and cerebellar dentate, while the experts showed activity only in the superior frontal area. The novices showed concurrent activity in not only the dorsolateral pre-motor cortex but also the ventral pathways linked to the ventrolateral pre-motor cortex. The novices exhibited broad activity in the superior frontal area, inferior frontal area, ventral prefrontal cortex, primary motor cortex, superior parietal lobule, and primary somatosensory cortex. The more localized neural activity of elite and expert archers than novices permits greater efficiency in the complex processes subserved by these regions. The elite group's high activity in the cerebellar dentate indicates that the cerebellum is involved in automating simultaneous movements by integrating the sensorimotor memory enabled by greater expertise in self-paced aiming tasks.

George, E-mail: xug2@rpi.edu [Nuclear Engineering Program, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York 12180 (United States); Yang, Youming; Bednarz, Bryan [Medical Physics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706 (United States); Sterpin, Edmond [Molecular Imaging, Radiotherapy and Oncology, UniversitÃ© catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium 1348 (Belgium)\n\n2014-07-15\n\nPurpose: Using the graphical processing units (GPU) hardware technology, an extremely fast Monte Carlo (MC) code ARCHER{sub RT} is developed for radiation dose calculations in radiation therapy. This paper describes the detailed software development and testing for three clinical TomoTherapyÂ® cases: the prostate, lung, and head and neck. Methods: To obtain clinically relevant dose distributions, phase space files (PSFs) created from optimized radiation therapy treatment plan fluence maps were used as the input to ARCHER{sub RT}. Patient-specific phantoms were constructed from patient CT images. Batch simulations were employed to facilitate the time-consuming task of loading large PSFs, and to improve the estimation of statistical uncertainty. Furthermore, two different Woodcock tracking algorithms were implemented and their relative performance was compared. The dose curves of an Elekta accelerator PSF incident on a homogeneous water phantom were benchmarked against DOSXYZnrc. For each of the treatment cases, dose volume histograms and isodose maps were produced from ARCHER{sub RT} and the general-purpose code, GEANT4. The gamma index analysis was performed to evaluate the similarity of voxel doses obtained from these two codes. The hardware accelerators used in this study are one NVIDIA K20 GPU, one NVIDIA K40 GPU, and six NVIDIA M2090 GPUs. In addition, to make a fairer comparison of the CPU and GPU performance, a multithreaded CPU code was developed using OpenMP and tested on an Intel E5-2620 CPU. Results: For the water phantom, the depth dose curve and dose profiles from ARCHER{sub RT} agree well with DOSXYZnrc. For clinical cases, results from ARCHER{sub RT} are compared with those from GEANT4 and good agreement is observed. Gamma index test is performed for voxels whose dose is greater than 10% of maximum dose. For 2%/2mm criteria, the passing rates for the prostate, lung case, and head and neck cases are 99.7%, 98.5%, and 97.2%, respectively.

In so doing, it places the latter, in the first place, within the conception of quixotism characteristic of the Victorian age and, in the second place, within the previous tradition of female quixotes, particularly as a response to George Eliotâs Middlemarch. Then, the text studies the novelâs originality within the English quixotic tradition, which lies in the way it relates quixotism to both philanthropy and feminism, not just by means of the heroine but also of some quixotic secondary figures, and argues the authorâs conservative position in the debate on womenâs rights known as the woman question. Finally, the paper illustrates such a position and its ideological context by presenting another âDonna Quixote,â in this case a satiric cartoon on the so-called new woman.\n\nAn Unusual Stress Fracture in an Archer with Hypophosphatasia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nUmut Yavuz\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available We report a 45-year-old male archer with stress fracture in his left ulna on the background of adult type of hypophosphatasia. The patient presented to several medical centers for pain around the left elbow and received medical treatment upon diagnosis of tenosynovitis. History of the patient revealed that he had had diagnosis of hypophosphatasia ten years ago and underwent percutaneous screwing for stress fracture on both of his femoral necks. Upon finding nondisplaced stress fracture on proximal metaphysis of the ulna on X-ray, the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI in order to exclude pathological causes. No additional pathology was observed in MRI scanning. The patientâs sportive activities were restricted for 6 weeks and he received conservative management with arm slings. Adult type of hypophosphatasia is a disease manifesting with widespread osteoporosis and presenting with low serum level of alkali phosphatase (ALP. Stress fracture should definitely be considered in the patients with history of hypophosphatasia and refractory extremity pain.\n\nTU-AB-BRC-10: Modeling of Radiotherapy Linac Source Terms Using ARCHER Monte Carlo Code: Performance Comparison of GPU and MIC Computing Accelerators\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLiu, T; Lin, H; Xu, X [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY (United States); Su, L [John Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD (United States); Shi, C [Saint Vincent Medical Center, Bridgeport, CT (United States); Tang, X [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, West Harrison, NY (United States); Bednarz, B [University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)\n\n2016-06-15\n\nPurpose: (1) To perform phase space (PS) based source modeling for Tomotherapy and Varian TrueBeam 6 MV Linacs, (2) to examine the accuracy and performance of the ARCHER Monte Carlo code on a heterogeneous computing platform with Many Integrated Core coprocessors (MIC, aka Xeon Phi) and GPUs, and (3) to explore the software micro-optimization methods. Methods: The patient-specific source of Tomotherapy and Varian TrueBeam Linacs was modeled using the PS approach. For the helical Tomotherapy case, the PS data were calculated in our previous study (Su et al. 2014 41(7) Medical Physics). For the single-view Varian TrueBeam case, we analytically derived them from the raw patient-independent PS data in IAEAâs database, partial geometry information of the jaw and MLC as well as the fluence map. The phantom was generated from DICOM images. The Monte Carlo simulation was performed by ARCHER-MIC and GPU codes, which were benchmarked against a modified parallel DPM code. Software micro-optimization was systematically conducted, and was focused on SIMD vectorization of tight for-loops and data prefetch, with the ultimate goal of increasing 512-bit register utilization and reducing memory access latency. Results: Dose calculation was performed for two clinical cases, a Tomotherapy-based prostate cancer treatment and a TrueBeam-based left breast treatment. ARCHER was verified against the DPM code. The statistical uncertainty of the dose to the PTV was less than 1%. Using double-precision, the total wall time of the multithreaded CPU code on a X5650 CPU was 339 seconds for the Tomotherapy case and 131 seconds for the TrueBeam, while on 3 5110P MICs it was reduced to 79 and 59 seconds, respectively. The single-precision GPU code on a K40 GPU took 45 seconds for the Tomotherapy dose calculation.

Fusion gene detection using a next-generation sequencing-based anchored multiplex PCR technique (Archer FusionPlex Sarcoma Panel) was used to identify the novel fusion breakpoints of this CIC-DUX4 sarcoma using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumour material. This CIC-DUX4 sarcoma has a novel fusion breakpoint between exon 20 of the CIC gene and exon 1 of the DUX4 gene. This case report describes an additional case of CIC-DUX4 sarcoma with a novel fusion breakpoint, and demonstrates the value of this next-generation sequencing-based anchored multiplex PCR technique (Archer FusionPlex Sarcoma Panel) in both diagnosis for patient care and in identification of a novel fusion breakpoint in this tumour type.

Margaret Archer, in particular, is highlighted as a key proponent of this thesis. Archer argues that late modernity is characterized by reflexivity but, in our view, this position neglects the impact of more enduring aspects of agency, such as the routinization of social life and the role of the taken-for-granted. These concepts were pivotal to Bourdieu and Giddens' theorization of everyday life and action and to Foucault's understanding of technologies of the self. We offer Bourdieu's habitus as a more nuanced approach to theorizing agency, and provide an alternative account of reflexivity. Whilst accepting that reflexivity is a core aspect of agency, we argue that it operates to a backdrop of the routinization of social life and operates from within and not outside of habitus. We highlight the role of the breach in reflexivity, suggesting that it opens up a critical window for agents to initiate change. The article suggests caution in over-ascribing reflexivity to agency, instead arguing that achieving reflexivity and change is a difficult and fraught process, which has emotional and moral consequences. The effect of this is that people often prefer the status quo, rather than to risk change and uncertainty.

Its association with a rapid increase of social and material inequality is beyond dispute. This article opens with a brief summation of contemporary British trends in economic inequalities, and finds an echo of these trends in health inequalities. It is suggested that the sociology of health inequalities in Britain lacks an analysis of agency, and that such an analysis is crucial. A case is made that the recent critical realist contribution of Margaret Archer on 'internal conversations' lends itself to an understanding of agency that is salient here. The article develops her typology of internal conversations to present characterizations of the 'focused autonomous reflexives' whose mind-sets are causally efficacious for producing and reproducing inequalities, and the 'dedicated meta-reflexives' whose casts of mind might yet predispose them to mobilize resistance to inequalities.\n\nArcher Fire and Safety - reducing risk in the offshore\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nTodd, K\n\n2000-06-01\n\nProtecting the lives and safety of offshore oil and gas workers is the business of Newfoundland-based Archer Fire and Safety.

Ukpong, the Nigerian New Testament scholar. In inculturation hermeneutics, argued Ukpong, the past of the biblical text is not supposed to be studied as an end in itself, but as a means to an end. Ukpong (2002 could thus argue: âThus in inculturation hermeneutics, the past collapses into the present, and exegesis fuses with hermeneuticsâ (p. 18. What does Ukpongâs concept of inculturation hermeneutics actually entail? Which implications does his notion of the fusion of exegesis and hermeneutics have for the theory and praxis of African Biblical Hermeneutics particularly on the African continent today? The preceding questions will be engaged with in this article.\n\nApplications of the models of Archer and TBC in the determination of thickness of barriers for radiological rooms\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCosta, Paulo R.; Salvador, F.C.; Nersissian, D.Y.; Caldas, L.V.E.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nTBC models for simulation of X-ray spectra and Archer for the determination of attenuation properties of materials have been applied according to the methodology set out in the publication NCRP 147 for obtaining radiological rooms protective barriers. The methodology used information from a survey of actual workload distributions of radiological rooms of the city of Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil as well as a similar survey conducted in the United States. The results of the application of the methodology demonstrate the possibility of reduction of barriers necessary for the protection of radiological rooms when compared to the direct application of the NCRP 147. The method developed serves both for estimation of shielding requirements in radiological rooms using up-to-date methodologies, as well as for training of professionals for design of shields\n\nModeling of Radiotherapy Linac Source Terms Using ARCHER Monte Carlo Code: Performance Comparison for GPU and MIC Parallel Computing Devices\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLin, Hui; Liu, Tianyu; Su, Lin; Bednarz, Bryan; Caracappa, Peter; Xu, X.

Several experimental and numerical studies have been performed to investigate how complex maneuvers are executed and develop bioinspired strategies for aquatic robot design. We will discuss recent numerical advances toward the development of a computational framework for performing turbulent, two-phase flow, fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) simulations to investigate the dynamics of aquatic jumpers. We will also discuss the integration of such numerics with high-speed imaging and particle image velocimetry data to reconstruct anatomic fish models and prescribe realistic kinematics of fish motion. The capabilities of our method will be illustrated by applying it to simulate the motion of a small scale archer fish jumping out of the water to capture prey. We will discuss the rich vortex dynamics emerging during the hovering, rapid upward and gliding phases. The simulations will elucidate the thrust production mechanisms by the movement of the pectoral and anal fins and we will show that the fins significantly contribute to the rapid acceleration.\n\nCultura da celebridade, fÃ£s e aÂ nova mÃ­dia: um estudo sobre a promoÃ§Ã£o da imagem e trabalho de Justin Bieber\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nCamyla da Silva Oliveira; Renata Prado Alves Silva\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEste artigo se propÃµe a analisar as dinÃ¢micas de comunicaÃ§Ã£o entre Justin Bieber e seus seguidores na web, buscando compreender as formas de promoÃ§Ã£o da imagem e trabalhos do artista nas novas mÃ­dias.

Dengan instalasi software open source Wirecast dan Desktop presenter digunakan untuk membuat video pembelajaran Streaming, disiarkan secara real time melalui media broadcast justin.tv (internet TV Channel, diharapkan dapat lebih mendukung konsep pembelajaran kapan dan dimana saja. Masalah terbesar dari teknologi ini adalah keterbatasan bandwidth. Bandwidth adalah parameter penting untuk melakukan streaming dalam jaringan. Sedangkan proses komunikasi menggunakan video digital ini menghabiskan resource yang cukup besar. Sehingga penggunaan wireshark di sini sangat diperlukan untuk menganalisis bandwidth pada paket yang diterima oleh client. Dari hasil pengukuran video dengan standar H.264 resolusi (720 x 540, dengan rata-rata 20 menit dalam pengambilan sampel, sebanyak 30 pengujian sampel streaming video menggunakan wireshark, diperoleh rata-rata throughput keseluruhan 0,343 Mbps, rata-rata throughput terendah 0,309 Mbps dan throughput tertinggi 0,372 Mbps. Dapat disimpulkan bahwa jika dihasilkan throughput yang lebih besar maka kualitas video streaming akan lebih baik, tetapi jika throughput dihasilkan semakin kecil maka kualitas video streaming akan menurun\n\nARCHER-Advanced System for RPVH Inspection and Repair\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTomasic, Tomislav; Vukovic, Igor; Bakic, Ante\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe reactor pressure vessel head (RPVH) is an integral part of the reactor coolant pressure boundary. Its integrity is important for the safe and reliable operation of the nuclear power plant (NPP). After detection of the leakage and cracks in French NPP, followed by another that occurred in NPP in USA, methods and frequency of inspection were defined, and are strictly regulated by the US NRC Order EA-03-009 (substituted lately by ASME Code Case N-791-1) since 2003. Usual scope of inspection from inner side of RPVH comprises of visual inspection of the surface, ultrasonic testing (UT) and eddy current testing (ET) of the penetration nozzle and ET of the J-groove weld and nozzle outside surface below the weld. ARCHER, new INETEC's manipulator, is designed to provide full scope inspection of the RPVH, by use of various test modules and by performing the surface repair action on J-groove weld. It is adjustable to work with different types of penetration nozzles and thermal sleeves on both VVER and PWR type of NPP. Due to complex geometry each module is specially designed for particular type of examination. Modules are exchanged through the docking system without need for personnel to enter under the head region, thus reducing the personnel's exposure to the ionizing radiation. The end effectors are used to determine the surface flaws or cracks on inner diameter surface of penetration nozzle gap. It guides a slim sword-like probe which carries a pair of TOFD transducers for detection and sizing of circumferential and axial cracks, an eddy current cross-wounded coil, and a zero-degree UT probe through a gap between the penetration nozzle and thermal sleeve. In case of a non-sleeved penetration nozzle, an open housing module is used. J-groove module is designed to fit geometry of the J-groove weld of penetration nozzle, vent pipe and funnel guide. The whole weld area (2' mm on shell side and 1/2' on nozzle side) is covered by two specially designed\n\nParticle deposition and resuspension in gas-cooled reactorsâActivity overview of the two European research projects THINS and ARCHER\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBarth, T., E-mail: t.barth@hzdr.de [Institute of Fluid Dynamics, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Bautzner LandstraÃe 400, 01328 Dresden (Germany); Lecrivain, G.

Within the framework of two European research projects, namely Thermal Hydraulics of Innovative Nuclear Systems (THINS) and Advanced High-Temperature Reactors for Cogeneration of Heat and Electricity R&D (ARCHER), a series of investigations was performed to investigate the transport, the deposition and the resuspension of aerosol particles in turbulent flows. The experimental and numerical tests can be subdivided into four different parts: (1) Monolayer particle deposition, (2) Monolayer particle resuspension, (3) Multilayer particle deposition and (4) Multilayer particle resuspension. The experimental results provide a new insight into the formation and removal of aerosol particle deposits in turbulent flows and are used for the development and validation of numerical procedures in gas-cooled reactors. Good agreement was found between the numerical and the experimental results.\n\nCultura da celebridade, fÃ£s e aÂ nova mÃ­dia: um estudo sobre a promoÃ§Ã£o da imagem e trabalho de Justin Bieber\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCamyla da Silva Oliveira\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Este artigo se propÃµe a analisar as dinÃ¢micas de comunicaÃ§Ã£o entre Justin Bieber e seus seguidores na web, buscando compreender as formas de promoÃ§Ã£o da imagem e trabalhos do artista nas novas mÃ­dias.

The approach followed was to create a techno-economic baseline for an existing CTL process using mass and energy balances determined with Aspen Plus chemical modelling software. The economic performance of a typical 80,000 barrels per day synthetic crude oil plant was determined from first principles. The techno-economic baseline model was validated with reference to published product output data and audited financial results of a Sasol CTL plant located at Secunda, South Africa, as reported for the 2011 financial year. A number of schemes were identified to couple the European HTR plant to the CTL case study. Two schemes were studied in detail, while the remaining coupling schemes will be studied as part of the follow-on project NC2I-R (Nuclear Cogeneration Industrial Initiative â Research). Two Key Performance Indices were of interest, namely the Internal Rate of Return of a Nuclear supported CTL plant and the reduction of CO_2 emissions. The case where nuclear co-generation replaced electrical power bought from the grid, and also replaced all the steam currently produced by the burning coal with nuclear steam, yielded interesting conclusions: â¢ The case study plant would need a total of 16 HTRs, each with a capacity of 265 MWth. â¢ The coupling scheme would reduce CO_2 emissions by approximately 14.5 million ton/annum or 51 % of the current emissions of a 80,000 bbl/d plant. â¢ The economic feasibility challenge for large scale deployment of nuclear energy in a Coal-to-Liquid application - where steam and electricity are to be generated from Nuclear energy, is to construct such a facility at an all -inclusive overnight cost not exceeding $3400/kWe.

Growth pattern by length-weight relationship (W=aL(b)) for the sexes differed, and exhibited positive allometric growth (male, female and combined sexes of T. chatareus; female and combined sexes of T. jaculatrix) and isometric growth (male samples of T. jaculatrix only). Trophic levels of both species were analyzed based on 128 specimens. The results show that, in both species, crustaceans and insects were the most abundant prey items, and among crustaceans the red clawed crab Sesarma bidens and Formicidae family insects were the most represented taxa. The estimated mean trophic levels for T. chatareus and T. jaculatrix were 3.422+/-0.009 and 3.420+/-0.020, respectively, indicating that they are largely carnivores. Fecundity of T. chatareus ranged from 38 354 to 147 185 eggs for females with total length ranging from 14.5 to 22.5 cm and total body weight from 48.7 to 270.2 g, and T. jaculatrix 25 251 to 150 456 eggs for females with total length ranging from 12.2 to 23.0 cm and total body weight from 25.7 to 275.0 g.

Substantial research confirms the role of psycho-social and environmental influences on this transition, but objective research examining the role of puberty hormones, testosterone in males and oestradiol in females (as biomarkers of puberty on adolescent events is lacking. Neither has the tempo of puberty, the time from onset to completion of puberty within an individual been studied, nor the interaction between age of onset and tempo. This study has been designed to provide evidence on the relationship between reproductive hormones and the tempo of their rise to adult levels, and adolescent behaviour, health and wellbeing. Methods/Design The ARCHER study is a multidisciplinary, prospective, longitudinal cohort study in 400 adolescents to be conducted in two centres in regional Australia in the State of New South Wales. The overall aim is to determine how changes over time in puberty hormones independently affect the study endpoints which describe universal and risk behaviours, mental health and physical status in adolescents. Recruitment will commence in school grades 5, 6 and 7 (10â12âyears of age. Data collection includes participant and parent questionnaires, anthropometry, blood and urine collection and geocoding. Data analysis will include testing the reliability and validity of the chosen measures of puberty for subsequent statistical modeling to assess the impact over time of tempo and onset of puberty (and their interaction and mean-level repeated measures analyses to explore for significant upward and downward shifts on target outcomes as a function of main effects. Discussion The strengths of this study include enrollment starting in the earliest stages of puberty, the use of frequent urine samples in addition to annual\n\nPerformance Study of Monte Carlo Codes on Xeon Phi Coprocessors â Testing MCNP 6.1 and Profiling ARCHER Geometry Module on the FS7ONNi Problem\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiu, Tianyu; Wolfe, Noah; Lin, Hui; Zieb, Kris; Ji, Wei; Caracappa, Peter; Carothers, Christopher; Xu, X. George\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThis paper contains two parts revolving around Monte Carlo transport simulation on Intel Many Integrated Core coprocessors (MIC, also known as Xeon Phi). (1) MCNP 6.1 was recompiled into multithreading (OpenMP) and multiprocessing (MPI) forms respectively without modification to the source code. The new codes were tested on a 60-core 5110P MIC. The test case was FS7ONNi, a radiation shielding problem used in MCNP's verification and validation suite. It was observed that both codes became slower on the MIC than on a 6-core X5650 CPU, by a factor of 4 for the MPI code and, abnormally, 20 for the OpenMP code, and both exhibited limited capability of strong scaling. (2) We have recently added a Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) module to our ARCHER code to provide better support for geometry modelling in radiation shielding simulation. The functions of this module are frequently called in the particle random walk process. To identify the performance bottleneck we developed a CSG proxy application and profiled the code using the geometry data from FS7ONNi. The profiling data showed that the code was primarily memory latency bound on the MIC. This study suggests that despite low initial porting e_ort, Monte Carlo codes do not naturally lend themselves to the MIC platform â just like to the GPUs, and that the memory latency problem needs to be addressed in order to achieve decent performance gain.\n\nLoovlinn - kultuuriga vÃ¤Ã¤ristatud turismitoode / Triin Ojari\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nOjari, Triin, 1974-\n\n2005-01-01\n\nPanu Lehtovuori ja Justin O'Connoriga kultuuritÃ¶Ã¶stusest ja loovate linnade loomisest.

Korobeynikova\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The issue of attention is one of the leading in sports psychology. Quite often, athletesâ failures in competitions are ultimately connected with the attention processes, i.e. distraction, switching or loss of concentration. Simultaneously, each particular kind of sport is distinguished by a specific competitive situation and accordingly presents a number of requirements to athletes, including attention features. Archery is no exception. Thus, in shooting sports, concentration and stability of attention are often deemed as the most significant features of attention. The paper is devoted to the study of the attention dynamic properties in archers. Attention features of athletes were assessed depending on the sports major, gender, age, experience and level of competence. 65 archers from different regions of Russia took part in the study, including 34 males and 31 females, the average age being 16.29 Â± 1.74. Experience ranges from 1 year to 8 years, average experience is 4.46 Â± 1.93. The research results showed that archers are characterized by high indicators of stability of attention, and also high efficiency of solving attention problems. The professional success of archery was associated with the ability to distribute attention when necessary. At the same time, there were no significant differences in the features of attention for recurved and compound archers, which indicates the uniformity of tasks related to attention in the sporting practice of archers. Summing up, it is necessary to include skills in the distribution of attention in the program of psychological training of archers.\n\nDeveloping Army Leaders: Lessons for Teaching Critical Thinking in Distributed, Resident, and Mixed-Delivery Venues\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2014-01-01\n\nArulampalam, Naylor, and Smith, 2004; Cantwell, Archer, and Bourke , 2001; Hoskins, Newstead, and Dennis, 1997); race (Miller and Ewell, 2005; Talbert...1996, pp. 26â48.

This paper describes the application of ARCHERRT on patient-dependent TomoTherapy and patient-independent IMRT. It also conducts a 'fair' comparison of different GPUs and multicore CPU. Methods: The source input used for patient-dependent TomoTherapy is phase space file (PSF) generated from optimized plan. For patient-independent IMRT, the open filed PSF is used for different cases. The intensity modulation is simulated by fluence map. The GEANT4 code is used as benchmark. DVH and gamma index test are employed to evaluate the accuracy of ARCHER{sub RT} code. Some previous studies reported misleading speedups by comparing GPU code with serial CPU code. To perform a fairer comparison, we write multi-thread code with OpenMP to fully exploit computing potential of CPU. The hardware involved in this study are a 6-core Intel E5-2620 CPU and 6 NVIDIA M2090 GPUs, a K20 GPU and a K40 GPU. Results: Dosimetric results from ARCHER{sub RT} and GEANT4 show good agreement. The 2%/2mm gamma test pass rates for different clinical cases are 97.2% to 99.7%. A single M2090 GPU needs 50~79 seconds for the simulation to achieve a statistical error of 1% in the PTV. The K40 card is about 1.7â¼1.8 times faster than M2090 card. Using 6 M2090 card, the simulation can be finished in about 10 seconds. For comparison, Intel E5-2620 needs 507â¼879 seconds for the same simulation. Conclusion: We successfully applied ARCHER{sub RT} to Tomotherapy and patient-independent IMRT, and conducted a fair comparison between GPU and CPU performance. The ARCHER{sub RT} code is both accurate and efficient and may be used towards clinical applications.\n\nFinantsteenistus / Stephen C Archer\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nArcher, Stephen C\n\n2004-01-01\n\nIlmunud ka: 2003 : annual report : [Eesti Raudtee]. - Tallinn, 2004, lk. 46-65; 2003 : godovoi ottshjot : [Eesti Raudtee]. - Tallinn, 2004, lk. 46-65.
