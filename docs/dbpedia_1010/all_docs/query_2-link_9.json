        "text": "Following the conclusion of the 2018-19 NBA season, Greek forward Giannis Antetokounmpo became only the fourth player from outside of the United States to receive the prestigious NBA Most Valuable Player Award (MVP), typifying Europe’s growing presence in the world’s premier basketball league. In the same season, Slovenian guard Luka Dončić claimed the Rookie of the Year award with on-court play far beyond his age.\n\nNext up is Killian Hayes, expected to be among the lottery picks in the NBA draft next month, and described as “the 2020 NBA Draft’s Top Prospect” by The Ringer’s Kevin O’Connor. The 19-year-old French point guard, who grabbed attention last year with his impressive footwork, is the latest talent developed by Basketball Bundesliga side ratiopharm Ulm to make it to the NBA, following the likes of Boston Celtics duo Daniel Theis and Javonte Green.\n\nAnd Hayes is unlikely to be the last Ulm player to find their way to the NBA. In September, the club will open the doors to its new $25 million development complex, a facility designed to take Ulm’s player development strategy to the next level.\n\nWith the OrangeCampus, Thorsten Leibenath, Sports Director for Ratiopharm Ulm, believes the club can create the “top development program” in Europe. The club’s success won’t be determined by the quality of the complex, but how the club utilizes it:\n\nGiving young players the opportunity to grow is a key part of the development program at Ulm, regardless of the risks. With the backing of the club’s owner, players like Theis and Hayes could be guaranteed playing time despite their age, allowing them to progress at a greater pace.\n\n“We as an organization like to take bigger chances, like to take bigger risks when it comes to giving players responsibility,” Leibenath says.\n\nWith the development of OrangeCampus, Ulm will be able to provide greater support to future talents as they adjust to playing at a higher level.\n\nVideo analysis will play a significant role in that process. Spiideo cameras will be utilized at the new facilities to record and tag games and practice sessions for both the professional and youth teams, providing vital footage that encourage the club’s talents to grow both individually and as a team.\n\nUlm’s investment in its new state-of-the-art facilities is testament to the club’s commitment to putting player development first. Rather than winning titles, the club chooses to prioritize the development of its players above all else.\n\n“For us as a professional club, the first priority isn’t to win the title. The first priority is to develop players,” Leibenath explains. “When you have 18 teams in the BBL and all 18 teams want to win the championship, 17 teams will fail. You need to create further goals.”\n\nRather than disappointment, Ulm can mark each season off as a success, having seen talents such as Theis, Green, and most recently Hayes, emerge.\n\nLeibernath acknowledges that players may be able to earn more money playing elsewhere. Yet, few clubs can offer a better place for talent to develop."
