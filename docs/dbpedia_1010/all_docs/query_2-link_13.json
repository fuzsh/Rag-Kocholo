        "text": "Australian Cricket Awards\n\nThe Australian Cricket Awards are an annual event held to honour the best talent in the Australian cricketing community. The Allan Border Medal and Belinda Clark Award are presented to the most outstanding Australian male and female cricketer of the season. The Australian Cricket Awards, formerly known as the Allan Border Medal awards, began in 2000, honouring Australia's best cricketers. Players vote for their most outstanding male and female, international and domestic players, including their young players of the year.\n\nCommunity Champion Award\n\nPresented at the Australian Cricket Awards, the award, developed in partnership between Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketersâ€™ Association, marks the latest evolution of the Australian Cricket Awards to better recognise and celebrate the performances of elite cricketers, both on and off the field. The Community Champion Award acknowledges the contribution current Australia players make to the broader community and is awarded to a state or national player who has gone above and beyond in charity or community work during the award period.\n\nKerry Packer Award\n\nThe Kerry Packer Award is the Australian Cricketers' Association's highest honour. It provides honorary life membership to the ACA, and is presented to members and non-members who are deemed to have served the ACA in an outstanding capacity. This award is judged by the ACA Board of Directors and a relative of the late Kerry Packer, and has a rich history of former winners.\n\nAll*Star Teams of the Year\n\nAt the conclusion of every competition or tournament, players vote for their 12 most valuable players. The ACA All*Star Teams of the Year include; Sheffield Shield, WNCL, Marsh Cup WBBL and BBL."
