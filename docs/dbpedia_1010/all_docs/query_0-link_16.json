DE MILLE Studio Production SCREENLAND Easy to Banish Fat Try This Modern Way Not always by abnormal exercise or diet. That is hard and slow. Most people who try it lack the patience to continue. Another method has in late years at- tained enormous use. Itis easy, pleasant, scientific, based on modern research. The slender figures now so common are largely due to that. That method is embodied in Marmola prescription tablets. People have used them for 20 years — millions of boxes of them.They have told the results to others. Now in almost every circle there are people who can show you what they do. Marmola contains a substance which, in the body, turns food into fuel and energy rather than into fat. The com- plete prescription is stated in every box. Also the reasons for results. This to ban- ish any fear of harm and to let you know just why you get the benefits that come. Go try Marmola, as myriads of people for two decades have done. Not only for new beauty, but new health and vitality. Simply take four tablets daily until you get the results desired. Then, in kind- ness to your friends, tell them what Marmola does. Go order before you forget it and watch the delightful change. Marmola prescription tablets are sold by all druggists at £1 per box.

Love — the exalted, the all-con- suming emotion, is tested in an era of cynical sophistication. The struggle of love against the hardened crust of futility and dillusionment that armors the hearts of the present generation of youth — that is the story of 'White Hands. Companionate Marriage, one of the most daring and discussed problems of modern sscial history is a motivating force in this drama. Not a preachment against the new solu' tion of the divorce evil, White Hands is a scientific dissection of the 'old tie that binds,' and the new companionate agree- ment that works like an optional contract. I was sincerely happy with Paramount's decision to produce 'White Hands as an Esther Ralston starring vehicle. I am in- trigued by this story of youth's triumph, and I am more than passingly interested in the companionate marriage doctrine. The story opens with the battle of age and youth. A thoroughly modern daughter has decided that companionate marriage will solve her problems. A thoroughly old fashioned father is shocked into vio- lence. He kidnaps his own child with the assistance of the captain of his yacht, and the group sets sail for Alaska to 'clear the modern rubbish' from the daughter's brain. The daughter, a product of today's free- dom, rebells actively against this unfair advantage of physical strength. She hates the young captain for his part in the con- spiracy to ruin her adventure into a com- panionate marriage. She reprimands her father for his lack of sportsmanship. Days become weeks — weeks months. Amid the wild beauty of the Alaskan wilderness the daughter remains unrelenting. In a desperate attempt to beat these two male creatures at their own game and get back to civilization, the girl succeeds in stealing away in a small launch. A sudden storm complicates matters. From shore the captain sights the tossing, pitching boat and struggles to save the .lone occupant before the sea claims her. The captain reaches the launch safely and finds his terror stricken captive at the wheel. The boat is carried out to sea by the storm and tossed upon an unexplored island of the Alaskan coast. A man and woman suddenly find it necessary to continue life in an unknown, uncivilised corner of the earth. Existence becomes an unbelievable battle. Habits of a lifetime — eating, clothing the body, keeping warm — develop into all-ab- sorbing problems, demanding the entire strength and ingenuity of the man and the woman. A child of luxury is reduced to a life of stark simplicity. Her complicated phi- losophy of life slowly unravels. And slowly, very slowly love — the unadulterated, un- tampered love of woman for man — man for woman — makes itself known to her. An unreasoning emotion, primitive but beau- tiful, that needs no man-made laws to make it sacred grows between a boy and girl — both products of the sophisticated age. Marriage, divorce, companionate ties dis- solve into meaningless theories before the onrush of unquestioning devotion. The story ends with the daughter and captain transplanted once more amid the dangers of civilization. But this young couple is serenely certain of love and mar- riage. An uncompromising adventure with nature has given this girl and boy a clear vision and a true sense of the values of life. To me, the strongest chapters of this story deal with the development of twen- tieth-century youth in stone-age environ- ment. The dawn of love in the midst of chaos and struggle is one of my pet per- sonal theories for I have always maintained that a man and woman must face disaster, disappointment, tragedy and suffering to- gether before they can face the world and say, 'Our love has been put to the test, and was not found wanting.'

Yet behind all the emotional raculously a little round worsted cap and his enthusiasms that compose crowd worship big brown eyes were always very earnest. I think there is a spark of real sincerity in the world's affection for Lindy. At the Astor theatre where King Vidor's The Crowd is running there is a 'short' of His face when he smiled, which wasn't often, was suddenly transformed into a burst of sunshine. How he got on the lot you can read in the screen news from Broadway Lindy billed as \"40,000 miles with Lind- article on page 30 but his first job was as an bergh.\" It shows Lindy's preparation actor. Then, rather than leave the atmo- of the famous flight of 'We' to Paris and sphere that he loved, he stayed on as an ends with the finale of the South American office boy until there was another opening tour. When it was over the applause was for him as an actor. He was a good office deliberate and strong. And the greatest boy too, he gave the best he had to the job proof of its deep sincerity was the complete that meant to him the gateway to paradise. As lack of hysteria that usually dominates such he grew older he found many things around a demonstration. Some of this sturdy lad's own fine quality is transmuted to the thou- sands who cheer him on. In the Square rests a recruiting plane, such as Lindy used to fly himself in his air mail work and thousands gather round it day and night. The police have a fine time to keep the small boys from climbing over and through it to see what makes it work, and a philosopher could learn a lot about his fellow human if he stood around for an hour and listened to the various com- ments of the people. Broadway welcomed many stars this month but the one that had the greatest interest for me was the newest star, well practically the newest star, in pictures. His name is Nick Stuart and all of a sudden the lot that he could do. He became an assistant cameraman, an assistant director and even helped with the continuity of the stories. He eagerly drank in all the knowledge he could, not only because it interested him but because he knew that the more angles he had on this work that he loved the better he would be when his time came to act. And now it has come, and I could wish that even a third of the aspir- ants now storming the gates of Hollywood were half as well prepared as Nick. There's nothing to stop him from rising to the top and sticking there, chiefly because he has a level head and I really think Nick will keep it. And what do you think he did while in New York?

G[ If it wasn't for Broad- way, what would Holly wood do? OST stories of sue cess, be it success in the movies or any other enter- prise, finish with a moral or some such subtle advice of 'go thou and do likewise.' The story about to be told is different in that it starts with a moral. It's this: Short- hand is often the shortcut to fame. Of course, one shouldn't generalize from a small number of instances; there are any number of girls to whom shorthand is a working art and fame a distant meteorite. Yet not a few girls in the movies were introduced by Isaac Pitman. One young person in particular is the subject of this interview— Blanche Mehaffey, who, at the present writing, is completing a honeymoon trip to New York, Miami, Havana and the Bahamas. In January she married George J. Hausen, millionaire oil and steel man, and when we were first ushered into their suite at the Ambassador Hotel Miss Mehaffey was taking down a tew of Mr. Hausen's notes— in shorthand. Not so many years ago Blanche Mehaffey a high school girl of fifteen, used to com- mute from Rye, N. Y., to Manhattan. Her story rests here for a few brief moments. Quite a few years before Blanche's hum- ble entry into the business world, a lad of sixteen, the son of a New York lawyer, took the advice of his father, an adherent ({Just a honey mooning movie girl now, but once upon a time she was a little piece of Broadway her- self. By C A. Leonard of Horace Greely, and went West. His money gave out when he reached the oil fields of Texas, and the only thing that stood between him and star- vation was a job as a pipe- liner. Either he lifted steel pipes weighing two hundred and fifty pounds or he went hungry. and, although it almost killed this boy of sixteen, he lifted them. He can still lift them today, even though he is a million- aire and doesn't have to. Now we may leave off George Hausen's story for the time being and return to that of Blanche Mehaffey, his wife. The point to be remembered, however, is that both started to wrest a livelihood from the world at a very tender age. When George Hausen was already direct- ing the activities of several oil gushers, Blanche's childish beauty was blossoming forth into womanly perfection. Through the kind offices of several friends she ob- tained an interview with Florenz Ziegfeld, glorifier of America's finest femininity. No time was lost thereafter. Blanche was up- rooted from the secretarial notebook and transplanted to the first line of human flowers that swayed in the breezy music of the Follies of 1923. There her beauty shone until Hal Roach uprooted her again, to implant her in his comedies. No need to retrace the steps of her picture career. She SCREENLAND 11 has since advanced to that point of ability and popularity where she can afford to free' lance, that is, choose the company to work for and the kind of roles she likes to play. A few months ago she was the guest of friends at a party given in the Cocoanut Grove. Also in the party was George J. Hausen. They were dancing when the head waiter interrupted with a telegram for Mr. Hausen. It was a very important message and had to be answered immedi- ately. Mr. Hausen conducted Miss Me- haffey to their table, excused himself and went out into the lobby. Presently he came back. He had to have a stenographer im- mediately, he said, and there was none available in the hotel at the moment. He would have to leave the party and go in search of one at that late hour of the night. It was past one. Blanche looked up at him regretfully, sympathetically. Was the nature of the business very confidential, she asked. It wasn't. Then, would he like her to do his shorthand for him? George Hausen was confused. The thought of a movie star taking down his notes about oil wells made him blush. But he took her up. And that, dear friends, was the way the romance began. Now Blanche returns to Broadway, and Alice in Wonderland never had a happier time. For a few days after her arrival as the wife of George J. Hausen, Mr. Ziegfeld sent a telegram from Washington, where he was trying out his production of The Three Musketeers. In it he proclaimed her 'the ideal Ziegfeld Girl,' added that she has the most beautiful eyes he, the greatest judge of feminine beauty, has ever seen, and offered her a part in any of his big shows, The Three Musketeers, Show Boat, Rio Rita or Rosalie, if she would only re- turn to the stage. Will she? Well, per- haps. Maybe if George Hausen made his headquarters in New York instead of Los Angeles. For Blanche still likes to take his notes down in shorthand. Broadway is not the only part of New York that has seen Blanche Mehaffey during her honeymoon visit. Ask the standees on the bread lines of the Madonna House, 173 Cherry Street. They know. On the coldest day of the year, an early Sunday morning too, the Hausens journeyed down to the lower east side and shared their happiness with several hundred unemployed. Their hands, feet and noses freezing, they distributed cigarettes, tobacco, candy and woolen mittens to the poor unfortunates on the bread lines of the city. That's one way of celebrating a honeymoon, and to the re- cipients of their gifts a most excellent way. One concluding note. Blanche Mehaffey observes that New York is getting to re- semble Hollywood. Once upon a time elaborate picture openings, with tickets boosted sky-high, was a genius peculiar only to Hollywood. Now it is quite the thing in the eastern metropolis, she finds. Then too, Broadway used to be a street of stage plays. Now every big theatre on what is known as the 'main stem' houses a special picture production. But the things on Broadway that hold her entranced are the huge electric letters and displays used to advertise the film attractions. She could stare at them for hours. . j — r' ~ Rupert Hughes, Rob Wagner and De- light Evans — scattered through this number like plums in a pudding. SCREENLAND is the fastest growing fan magazine.

BOHEMIA in ojpi ctureland (\\The Alleyways of Hollywood are the high roads of Ambition. Hollywood has no Latin Quarter, no Washington Square- but it has its alleys. These alleys are filled with friendly cats, a mouse or two and much atmosphere. For every alley boasts at least one or two struggling geniuses who live in a fairly happy way most of the time on less than fifteen dollars a week. Lean to houses, or shacks, built up against the sides of more pros- perous garages shelter them. Unplastered rooms over these garages make splendid studios. Knock out a board or two if there is no north light — for it is eternal Spring in Hollywood, except when the rainy season descends, and when it does rain — why, put up a canvas. Rents are low — as low as ten dollars a month for shacks not much bigger or more carefully finished inside than hencoops — and again they soar as high as forty dollars a month, but the forty dollar studios are only for the very prosperous. The problem of eating is a grave matter. To be sure one can always dine well for ten cents on coffee and doughnuts in almost any coffee shop along the boulevard. Dinners are the worst struggle. But if one genius has a handful of potatoes — another has a bit of meat — it's no trouble at all to find an onion. And so Irish stew is the most pop- ular dish in bohemian Hollywood. Sometimes somebody sells a story, or a painting — or gets two weeks of extra work — or maybe a tiny check from home — or better still someone's birthday brings a box from home — then the goose hangs high in the alleyways. A girl, only lately sprung into prominence on the screen, came to Hollywood a year or two back with a small legacy of four hundred dollars. It was soon spent and fame was as yet only a vision. The girl took an 'apartment1 in one of the alleyways. She managed to get enough extra work to keep body and soul together.

Have you ever lamented over the old wheeze, 'Beauty is skin deep, but ugliness goes to the bone?1 Have you ever wept hot, salty tears into a hot and crumpled pillow in acceptance of it when you have seen your best young man walk out with the town beauty? Well, dry your eyes, because it needn't happen again. Not if you buck up and go in for preparedness of a constructive type. V. E. Meadows says so, and he ought to know. Do I hear you grumble, 'Who's this V. E. Meadows guy and how does he get that way?' Well, tune in and listen to the Hollywood dirt.

And that's where you come in. Preserve the beauty God gave you to start with, and if you say He didn't give you any you're a pessimist.

She has just been signed to a two year contract at a fine salary, for one of the biggest companies. She has made the hit of the season in one of the new 'big' pictures. She is the latest Hollywood sensation. Who is she? Not an ingenue. Not a Follies girl or a bathing beauty. But a white-haired woman of sixty, who never did any act' ing in her life until ten years ago. Mar- garet Mann is the latest and the greatest screen mother; you have heard of her success in Four Sons. And now she is a star. Here is one of the most romantic of all the romances of the movies. Not all romances are of young love. Mar- garet Mann's is the much more poignant romance of a woman whose dreams didn't even begin to come true until the twilight of her life. A woman who has worked hard for sixty years — and whose eyes are as bright and as clear as a girl's. A wonderful woman, Mar- garet Mann. Only the movies could have rewarded her as she deserved. She is an inspiration when she says: \"It only goes to show that if you have it in you, someday, somehow, your halo.

Nothing! Some day, Fate will open a door and beckon you in. Though you may be old and hope- less, tired and disappointed, you will obey the sum- mons just the same, and you will have your reward for all those years of weary waiting. And it's worth waiting for — take Margaret Mann's word for it! No flapper could be getting a bigger, more satisfying 'kick1 out of success than this woman, at sixty. She is mellow and tolerant and kindly. She has learned her lessons and she can enjoy her success. She is happy because she can look back and know that she has done it all herself. There has never been a screen star who fought harder for success. A year ago she was making the rounds of the studios, an extra. Just the other night — at the Broadway opening of her picture, Four Sons, the Archduke Leopold of Austria came up to r C[ Margaret Mann came from Scot- land where hearts ire braw and faces bonny. her and kissed her hand and told her he was proud to have played a small part in the same picture with her! Fifty years or so ago, back in Scot- land, little Margaret Mann stood on tiptoe to watch the Queen ride by, on her way to Balmoral — Queen Victoria, her childhood idol. Today, people are telling her how much she looks like that same queen, in some of the closeups in Four Sons. Audiences whisper that the motion pic- ture actress has the poise and dignity associated with the memory of the great ruler. Yes — Margaret Mann has travelled a long way in those fifty years. She has come through hazards and privation and often heart-ache. But, as she says gallantly, it's been worth it! This woman whose portrayal of mother-love has been acclaimed one of the finest characterizations ever seen on the screen, is far from the movie mother of tradition. She is not bent and broken, or faded and frail. She is jolly, and broad and buxom, and straight and strong. She re- vives memories of mothers and grandmothers in gay ging- ham aprons in cheerful kitchens, cutting out cookies in queer amusing shapes for young hands to grab. She will remind you of childhood holidays — Christmas tree and chocolate cake and colored Easter eggs. And — although she was born in Scotland, and makes her big hit in a German role — she is the embodiment of James Whitcomb Riley's homely, American poem, Old Aunt Mary. Margaret Mann has beautiful snow-white hair, a clear skin, bright clear eyes. She looks successful — prosoerous 23 — happy. Only her hands have a story to tell — large, capable hands, work-worn and wrinkled. She has made a living with those hands. Once she was a dress-maker. Again, she started a tea-shop when times were bad, and made Scotch short-bread and other delicacies and served them herself. She has cooked, mended and scrubbed. And she still cooks her own and her husband's breakfast before she leaves for the studio, and cooks their dinner when she comes home at night! When you see her in the picture, you will notice that in her big scenes she never indulges in the hysterics associ- ated with screen motherhood. Bereaved of three sons, she expresses agony and grief of the deepest feeling, but without a tear. All the poignancy and beauty and tenderness of true motherhood is revealed on that screen, and it is the audiences who weep. You forget most previous screen mothers when you see her. She was talking about her work in the picture when some- body asked her how many chil- dren she has in real life. \"I am sorry,\" she said. \"I haven't any.\" She smiled a little, sadly. 'All mothers don't have chil- dren,\" she added. She would rather not talk about the two babies she had, who died. She loved them, and if they had lived she would probably not be playing mothers on the screen. As it is, she lavishes all her mother-love on her picture sons and daughters. Like Mary Pickford, she loves all children, having none of her own to love. She is called 'Mother' by the whole studio. She started in mothering extras; now she is mothering stars. (Incidentally, she still mothers the extras, too). If anyone had told Maragaret Mann forty years ago that she would be an actress some day, all her Scotch ancestors would have risen up in wrath. She was never even inside a theatre until pretty she was a woman. Her family, strict Scots, frowned on play-acting. Margaret, one of ten sisters and brothers, had to leave school when she was ten years old, and go to work. She was one of the props of the family; she moth- ered the younger ones and helped to feed them all. By the time she was twenty she was an expert dress-maker. Imagine her amazement then if anyone had suggested that in another forty years she would be buying expensive gowns in one of the deluxe shopping streets of the world — for herself! That she would be earning almost a thousand dollars a week, every week! The little dressmaker wouldn't even have laughed. It wouldn't have seemed funny to hear such things, when she was sewing away on pretty things for other girls to wear! She had the pioneer spirit, this little Scotch girl. She decided she could do better away from her home town of Aberdeen. South Africa appealed to her imagination — and one day, she up and sailed for Johannesburg! It was, although she didn't realize it at the time, her first step toward fame and fortune. That trip picked her right up out of the rut and set her on the right track — the broad highway of ambition. In Johannesburg she met James F. Smythe, an Englishman, and they were married. Seven years in South Africa — and the pioneer urge exerted itself again. Margaret Mann Smythe suggested that they pull up stakes — and seek their fortune in a new land — America! They lived in Seattle, Washington, U. S. A., where James Smythe found work in his capacity as accountant. There they stayed for years, and they might be there today if — once more that little pricking imp of ambition hadn't teased the wife. She had heard so much about California. It called her with a siren call that couldn't be resisted. It seems strange to her, looking back, that she should have answered it. But she did. And almost as soon as she and her husband set foot in that sunny, fragrant state, her career began! Her real career, that she had been waiting for all those years. Perhaps because of her gra- cious manner and her poise, and that beautiful white hair, she was asked to impersonate Martha Washington in a pag- eant at San Diego Commemo- rating the father of his country. Of course, she accepted — and made such an impression that everybody began to urge her to try the movies. Armed with the brand of Scotch confidence that doesn't come out of a bot- tle, and one lone picture of herself, Margaret Mann went to a film studio to apply for work. And she was given extra work immediately! At first it was as easy as that. Extra work, as well as bits, came her way. Then a real part — the mother in Allen Holubar's Hearts of Humanity, one of the first of the big war pictures. Margaret Mann loved the work from the start. She liked the people she met — young people, for the most part, Marion Davies must whom she could encourage, and stay a comedienne. pat, and cheer along. From have so few the first she realized that she 'belonged.' She ones- was a born actress, although it took her forty years to find it out! She can forget herself, the director, the camera and the carpenters and the lights, and submerge herself in her character. In the very first 'bit' she ever played, she was so much engrossed in it that the director had to make retakes.

She was sur- prised when she heard the director shout: \"That's fine — that's great! But next time for gosh' sake turn toward the camera, not away from it!\" To this day she prefers not to face the camera if she can help it.

Q The Screen News from Broad- way is always about the Suc- cessful Stars. You must make your mark before Broadway can see you. Hail — 'the coming of Spring' — and all that sort of thing! Just like little crocuses, the screen stars bob up on Broadway — to say nothing of Fifth and Park Avenues. Wherever there's a shop, or a theatre, or a smart restaurant, there you'll be sure to find at least two or three celebrities dis- porting themselves — spending their hard-earned Hollywood money, and as happy as children on a candy spree. The good little girls and boys of Hollywood ask nothing better than a trip to Our Town between pictures. Even a location trip east is not to be sneered at — not even in these days of spring sniffles. Look at Sally Phipps and Nick Stuart — just look at them. They won't hurt your [Patsy Ruth Miller is one of the most ultra' modern of the Holly wood flappers. eyes, not at all. Maybe you think these two kids didn't enjoy their so- journ among the bright lights! It was their first trip, and they were just plain thrilled. You'd like Sally and Nick. Like so many of the Hollywood ingenues, Sally sports a gold anklet; but when you ask her whose name is engraved on it, though it's none of your business, she says: 'Nobody's. I bought it myself — and one for mother, too.' And she adds: 'Nobody would have me!' You don't believe that, of course, for Sally has the softest big, brown eyes you ever saw, and the Vi prettiest wavy red hair, and the pearliest teeth. She's only 18, and she was going to be a lawyer, like dad. But one day she went to the Fox Studio to watch her family friend, Frank Bor- zage, directing Seventh Heaven; and while she was there, somebody suggested a test; and of course, it turned out to be a wow, and before she knew it, Sally was in pictures! As the hero- ine of The High School Hero she made a hit. Now she and Nick are together again in The J\\[ews Parade, a story of the adventures of a news-reel cameraman. It was this picture which brought the troupe, under David Butler's direc- tion, to New York, and from there took them to such paradises as Palm Beach, Lake Placid, and Havana, Cuba. Nick is just twenty -two, and very handsome. He looks like a typical American youth, but as a matter of fact he was born in Roumania, and his real name is Nicholas Prata. Once he was a shipping clerk in a Hollywood sporting goods store. His idol, Tom Mix, walked in one day to make a purchase. Nick begged to be allowed to deliver the goods to the studio, where he worked so fast that he landed a job as office-boy, then rose to assistant cameraman and finally was promoted to acting, and he's been delivering the goods ever since. Young Nick is a nice lad; he can still blush.

She's one Follies beauty who can say 'Suc- cess!' and not ex- aggerate. From the time she left the Fol- lies, where her Ti- tian tresses were much appreciated, for the movies, where she started as a Hal Roach come- dienne, she has made good. Blanche had graduated into drama and was doing well, thank you, when a million- aire oil man came a- wooing. He won, and Blanche came east on the first lap of her honeymoon. From here they will go to Havana, Cuba. The lucky man is George J. Hansen. Mr. Ziegfeld wired her an offer to come back to the stage, but Blanche will stick to the screen, although she and her husband will probably take a trip to Africa first. Maybe she'll do a Mrs. Martin Johnson. * * * Mr. and Mrs. Irving Thalberg were in town only a week-end before they hopped on the Mauretania for a Mediterranean cruise. It's their honeymoon, long dc layed because the groom had (Cont. on page 99) 11 (\\A Father's Fame may be a load upon youth's shoulders. CfThe inimitable Douglas Fair- banks himself. 1 'nJHERE is an old biblical wheeze to the effect that 'the sins of the father shall be visited upon the children, etc.1 But how about the old man's virtues? Fame, for instance. Paternal fame is a pretty heavy load to visit upon any son. I recall an article Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr. wrote, entitled: \"It's hard to be a rich man's son.\" Well, if you ask me, it's harder to be a great star's son. And if you don't care to ask me, ask Douglas Fairbanks Jr. One day down at the Beach Club I was wrestling on the sand with my two boys when a fine-looking lad ^f^T ^ with the body of a young god came up. \"You don't re- InTde^before °hl member me, Mr. Wagner, but I'm Douglas Fairbanks' stepped out alone. 32 S 1 C[ Douglas Fairbanks Jr. drawn from life by Rob 'Wagner the author of this article. son, and I sure would like to learn some of those holds.\" So we 'rasseled' around until the boy was sand-scratched from toes to forehead. \"Well, Doug, you are certainly the son of your father,\" I said as we finally sat up to rest. \"Paramount doesn't think so,\" he replied solemnly. \"Why, I thought they were starring you!\" I exclaimed. \"Were is right. But not now. I flopped miserably. It was a terrible blunder to send me out in father's shoes, for I couldn't fill them. I was merely a young upstart trading on a famous name. No, I'm through with pictures. Mother and I are going to Europe so that I can study art. I want to stand on my own pins.\" It was a fine enthusiasm, but an expensive one. Mother and son spent nearly a year abroad when they suddenly discovered their capital was rapidly diminishing. Douglas decided to go to work. Even if he couldn't star, he could get some sort of a job in pictures. Yes, Paramount would take him back, but he would have to play in stock at half his former salary, and take what small parts he could get. He was no longer the son of his father, but merely one of many hacks who had to make good on his own merit. Just as the studio had blundered in prematurely raising the boy to stardom, it blundered again in the opposite direction, now finding no merit whatsoever in him. This was eloquently indicated by again cutting (Cont. on page 78) every inch of the son can be seen the poise and individuality of his discriminating father. 33 viting us to lunch!\" ex- claimed Patsy in delight, as she danced about with a little note in her hand. \"And Harry Crocker is going to be there too!\" It is never of course a question of acceptance when Charlie in- vites you to his wonderful house atop the hill, be- cause you always know that you will have a won- derful time. \"Charlie has such a way of concentrating all his charm on you — as though you were just the only person in the world,\" re- marked Patsy as we motored up there on the picturesque winding road through the California sunshine and past Corinne Griffith's house and Tom Mix's house and quite close to Jack Gilbert's Spanish home.

I didn't even plant many flowers. I didn't know how I would feel about too much color. The green grass and trees are so restful. Trees always seem like companions to me.\" So we were ushered into the library which opens onto the rear lawn, and Charlie came at once and took our wraps himself. The comedian is always doing these nice little things. \"There's such harmony in this house,\" whispered Patsy, \"that I don't know how anybody ever quarreled in it.\" The library has the effect of a high chamber in a castle, and the big pipe organ carries out a sort of cloistered effect, while a lighter note, but entirely harmonious, is carried out in a couple of small bay windows with up- holstered seats and white curtains. There are rows and rows of fascinating books. We went into the drawing room, where we found a 34 (\\The picture girls first make the occasion, then celebrate it. had the birds in it, raw. cheerful fire in a big fireplace, and where there is a disarming effect of ivory white, the proportions of the place being restfully big, and all the sofas and chairs making for cheerfulness and peace. We chatted about The Circus, and about Charlie's plans for his next picture, but of course it isn't at all certain what that picture will be. \"Let's just get a cop and begin!\" suggested Harry Crocker humorously. Harry is working with Charlie in all his stories nowa'days. At any rate the picture won't be Napoleon's life, said Charlie. \"There won't be much real love interest in the story when I make it,\" he suggested. \"Because I do not think Napoleon took love very seriously. It was only another manifestation of his power to have women in love with him, that's all.\" Lunch was served in the dining room, which is fitted up with some sort of dark polished wood, and with exquisite table accessories and service. After lunch we went out and surveyed the grounds, and wandered about the interesting paths that lead under the trees down the side of the hill. Presently we came to a kind of little summer house on the slope. \"This is where I thought out The Gold Rush,\" Charlie told me. \"I'd walk up and down this little path,\" — he illustrated his distraught tramping up and down in his own funny pantomimic way.

Screen- LAN D has been given permission to give wider distribu- tion to this fine article from the first issue of ^Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.' T \"sJH E art C[ Rupert Hugh moving-picture -or industry — or what you may call it — has a term of its own for what the poet Gray bewailed in his Elegy: the gem of purest ray serene hidden in the dark, unfath- omed caves of ocean; the flower born to blush unseen; the noble rage repressed, the mute, inglorious Milton. The mute, inglorious mov- ies call it 'the Face on the Cutting Room Floor. 1 It is one of those we-laugh-lest-we' that actor a joke, but a brave flippanc weep cynicisms. For among all the countless tragedies that fill the life of the studios and break the hearts of the makers of pic tures, none are more poignant than the piles of celluloid shavings that fill the metal waste-baskets in the cutting rooms. Even the producers suffer, since the clippings represent wasted fortunes; the camera-men sigh as they find their most beautiful shots thrust back into the dark. But the directors, the authors and the actors suffer most. The public suffers, too, but never knows what it has missed. Much of the stuff that reaches the screen had far better have been left in the discard, but that fact merely renders the loss of the beautiful things more regret- able. Sometimes the omissions are due to in- exorable necessity, as when a picture is shot in twice or more the necessary number of reels. This is one of the most expensive sins of the business, and a sheer waste of annual millions of dol- lars which must be retrieved in the dimes and quarters slipped through the ticket- sellers' little round windows. But the spiritual loss is incal- culable. Mr. Jack Dempsey says that the blows that miss take more life out of a fighter than those that land. And the cli- maxes of emotion a director* and an achieve and never see in the finished pictures take the heart out of them more than the contemptuous press- notices or the studio jibes they receive for their manifest failures. There is something so peculiarly harrowing about the excision of beautiful scenes from a pic- j ture that it seems almost a crime to have shot them at all. We do not blame people for not falling in love and not having children, but to commit infanticide is singularly horrible. Projection-room psychology and box-office success are most dangerous guides to conduct. People who have seen a picture dozens of times are the poorest possible judges of what the public will feel on seeing the result for the first time. Consequently, success is often due to popular reac- tions of the very opposite sort from those that have been planned. Last year in New York I saw a very successful picture, exploiting a very prominent actor and a very prominent actress. The film drew immense crowds everywhere and the pro- fits would seem to silence criticism. The famous stars played love scens of the utmost in- tensity. They gave unre- strained lessons in what Lewis Carroll called 'reel- Hollywood's moSf famous writer tells the Story of 40 By Rupert Hughes ing and writhing.' Yet the more ar- dently they em- braced, the more frenzied their amorous con- tortions, the more the audi- ence howled with laughter. While the heroine and the hero shuddered with desire, the audi- \\ ence whooped with ridicule. The crowds flocked to the picture, because of the magnetism of the stars and perhaps because of the word-of- mouth propaganda proclaimed it one of the funniest pictures ever seen. It provoked, indeed, far more hilarity than half the intentional comedies by the best clowns. Perhaps if the scenes had been played honestly and had inspired the love-sorrow implied, the pic- ture would have brought in less money. Yet surely one could not draw from it a lesson that famous stars should be made ludicrous in their love-scenes. The pity of the omitted scenes is that one can never know whether their omission was wise cr not. The successful pictures might have been more successful, or might not have succeeded at all if they had been included. The failures might have been more dire, or might have been turned into triumphs if the cuts had not been made. One thing is well-known, though the knowl- edge is not often of much use: pictures that are gripping and delightful in fifteen or more reels are often dull as dishwater {Com. on page 86) C The Patent Leather Kid' that brought Barthelmess bac\\ to \\ success was one of Rupert Hughes stories. -4 \"The Face on the Cutting Room Floor\" 41 Relight R.EVI C[ King Vidor has done it again ^ Crowd (\\Step Lively, Pull— ease! i \"n^his isn't just a picture. It's an experience don't know whether you'll like it or not. It isn't the rousing entertainment that The Big Parade was. I'm not sure that it's entertainment at all. But King Vidor has done it again, whether you like it or not. The Crowd is his own idea. It is probably more nearly a complete artistic expression of this young director than any other picture. It's naive at times; it is curiously amateur- ish at others, but there are moments of such great power and understanding that you're willing to swear it's great. You'll see yourself and your next-door neighbor in The Crowd — and you know how much fun that is. The Boy and the Girl are too much like you and me to make it entirely pleasant to sit through eight reels or so of their trials and troubles. It's an experience, nevertheless, that mustn't be missed. The Boy's father was sure he'd be president some day. Instead, he gets a job as a clerk, goes to Coney Island, meets a girl, marries her, becomes a father — twice, loses his job, and has a hard time landing another. That's all there is to it — yes, that's all. But it is more than enough for Mr. Vidor. You can take his picture anyway you want to. According to a sub' title, once you lose step with the Crowd it goes hard with you until you get back into step again. According to an advertisement for the picture, you've got to rise above the Crowd if you want to get anywhere. Maybe Mr. Vidor would be content to call it the epic of Everyman and his Wife, and let it go at that. At times The Crowd out-stroheims Mr. Von in its realism. There's a Sennett touch in some of the comedy. It begins to look as. if Mr. Vidor is all of the 'big' directors rolled into one. At any rate, he does wonders with his actors. James Murray is amazingly good as the Boy. Eleanor Boardman is even better as the wife. I don't know any other actress who could have played this part. Submerging her delicate beauty, Miss Boardman achieved a portrait of a middle- class lady that she should be proud of. This girl should be starred. If her husband is a composite of all directors, she's all actresses in one small package. Some girls can play wives, some can play mothers, while others excel as sweeties. Eleanor can play 'em all. Darned clever, these Vidors! C[ A great mother picture- — dramatic without being mushy or morbid FOUR SONS Q \"One, two, three, four- Oh, how I wish there were more.,) rjr'LL be frank with you. I didn't want to go to see this picture. I fought against it. Another mother picture! I have nothing to say against mothers as a rule; and a whole lot to say for them. I have a pretty good one myself and I know a lot of other folks who are proud of theirs. But I don't like to see them on the screen. They aren't Mothers; they're monstrosities in shawls and bonnets; they cry all the time. So I thought I wouldn't go to see Four Sons. Then I thought, 'Well, Jimmy Hall is in it;' and the minute I think of Jimmy Hall I want to see him again to decide whether I like him or don't like him. Well, I went. And I wouldn't have missed it for anything, not just because it made up my mind for me about Jimmy Hall (the answer is: Yes; I do.) But it showed me a real Mother on the screen. Margaret Mann plays her, and she's more like a mother really is than I'd ever hoped to see in pictures. She doesn't whine or weep. She makes cookies, and keeps the home-fires burning. Miss 42 Mann and Director John Ford have given us a great per- formance, in a picture that is emotional without being mushy, and dramatic without turning morbid. Four Sons is a war picture with only one war scene. What self 'control this director must have! It's a great little plea for peace, for it takes us on the other side of the trenches and introduces us to the enemy — three of whom are Mother Bernle's stalwart sons. The fourth, played by James Hall, is fighting with the Yanks. But they're all brothers. After the war, Mother Bernle leaves the old country for the new. She has to 'learn her letters\" first, and her struggles with a new tongue amid strange Sadi OW to spend your rainy afternoon: watch Gloria Swanson as the heroine of W. Somerset Maugham's best story. Gloria does one of the greatest come-backs in history. Give this girl a role she likes and she has a good time and gives every- body else the same. Acting from contented stars is what this industry needs. Miss Swanson is one of the most fascinating personalities in pictures, but when she appears in a badly-fitting part, she loses her lustre. Mr. Maugham is a good tailor. His Sadie Thompson is just what Gloria needed. It's her best part — the sort of thing we want to see her do. Gloria as a 'good' girl is Gloria wasted. She's one of the few film idols we like to see cut loose. The more exotic her part, the better we like her. And so — Sadie Thompson offers her everything. Besides, it's a good picture. This is Gloria's lucky year. Raoul Walsh has directed in just the right high spirits, and himself H ho doesn't enjoy fairy tales? WTho's too old? Oh, you aren't either. You just think you are.

Everybody in the cast is splendid, but Miss Mann and Mr. Hall are outstanding. It's Jimmy's first chance to act, and he will surprise you. I've never seen more exquisite photography. John Ford has done some beautiful things in his direction, too. I like the way he creates characters instead of depending upon 'types.' He offers his comic relief with a deftness that Shakespeare would have loved. And speaking of Shakespeare — if his plays are ever, by accident, put on the screen, John Ford is just the director to do it, if he keeps up the high standard he sets in his Four Sons. plays the important part of Sergeant O'Hara with gusto and virility. Sadie has had rather a bad reputation in film circles since Will Hays exiled her; but as a matter of fact the little girl is going to do a lot of good in the world or I miss my guess. She makes a great sermon for tolerance, and stages an exciting tirade against hypocrisy. Her heart is big, her manners are careless and her morals are nobody's business. When she appears in Pago-Pago in the South Seas she excites the interest of a detachment of Marines and the animosity of one Hamilton, a virulent reformer. He attempts to wreck her life, which she is striving to mend, and almost succeeds. Sadie fights back and wins, aided by the wholesome Sergeant O'Hara. Gloria's just great. You'll like the picture. It isn't so often we're treated to a swell star in a picture worthy of her. But Sadie Thompson is it, and plenty of it. ' OAT summer resort. Of course she meets the Prince — in dis- guise. And of course, he loves her for herself alone. She goes back to the lunch-wagon just long enough to find her happy ending. Miss Moore has some charming comedy scenes. She's abetted by Larry Kent, whom I'd like to announce right now as my favorite leading man for 1928 — so far. He's the only actor I've ever seen who is really reminiscent of Wally Reid, with all of Wally's ingratiating good looks and humor. You watch Larry Kent. On second thought, don't bother.

She's a peasant girl whose hut is her castle, and just let any man try to crash the gate. Down comes the whip, and out goes the man. But there's always an ex- ception, or there wouldn't be many motion pictures. This time the exception is Tony Moreno. The whip girl beats him up, then picks him up and carries him home. After that, the picture just goes all to pieces. Sometimes she loves him, sometimes she whips him. It doesn't make much sense finally. Especially when you see the gorgeous Hedda Hopper trailing around as Mr. Moreno's widowed mother. That's funny. Miss Taylor gives a glowing performance as the whip woman. But at that, she revives the hope that some day, some how, the producers are going to for- get that she ever played a Borgia and just let her be her charming, sociable self. Oh well — we're all happier close to nature ROSE MARIE in the H, you Rose-Marie! Some kid! This little French- Canadian girl has had quite a career, all the way from musical comedy to the movies. She's almost as famous as Abie's Irish Rose. Up there north west where men are mounties she has all 'the males at her feet, but of course the one she picks — she would — is a fugitive from justice, so she has to go trudging up and down mountains and get buffeted about by the elements — all for him. Fortunately she is played by Joan Crawford, who is one of those lucky girls who always looks beautiful under any given set of circumstances. She's especially radiant as Rose-Marie, displaying more dash, or verve, or whatever you want to call it, in a simple little blouse and a wisp of skirt than she ever did all dolled up. Oh, well — we're all happier close to nature. James Murray, House Peters and Creighton Hale are the men in the case, and I give you the usual three guesses as to which one Rose-Marie fastened her affections on. Wrong the first time. James Murray, not House Peters.

I'm all for it, myself. I like the rough-and-ready atmos- phere of such a picture as A Girl in Every Port. My boy friend does, too. Tip to girls: if you want to be The Girl in your particular port, don't turn up your nose at the pictures of the What Price Glory school, unless you want to pay your own way to the movies. You may prefer to see the smiling face of your pet actor to the scowling countenance of Victor McLaglen, but don't you let on. And when you see one girl after another parade on the screen, smile, darn you, smile! It seems that no longer must movie men be beautiful. McLaglen and Robert Armstrong, his team mate, will certainly never win any prises for pulchritude, but the boys are there with the wallop just the same. They're a great combination, artists at fisticuffs or kisses, getting away with murder and everything but matrimony in every port. Don't pity the poor sailors any more; don't waste your pity. Although there are gobs of girls in this sailor's paradise, there is not a single Heroine, or even a married one. Louise Brooks, Leila Hyams, and many, many more are present, to liven things up; but not even Louise makes more than a dent in the big, big heart of the two sailor- boys. They're soon off on another cruise, and — there's a girl in every port.

Also, she is assisted in her latest set of escapades by a new young man, named Lane Chandler, who is, believe it or not, an entirely original type of leading juvenile.

The one-reelers were made with Jannings playing op- posite Ossi Oswaldi. A young man who had been acting C[ Emil and Ernst — from mutual suspicion to un- bounded confidence in each other. in the German Theatre was given his first directorial chance in making them. The young man was Ernst Lubitsch. Emil Jannings played in them. He was merely a ghost, a shadow, unnamed on the screen, a phan- torn of nothing, although he was one of the foremost stage actors of Germany. So unimportant were motion pic tures — so far from importance were those who played in them at that time. Indeed, long after, with the filming 46 of Passion, afterwards world famous and its makers also, Jannings still remained a shadow, nameless on the screen, just one of the players. Lubitsch was little better known. But not for long. The German studio hired a secretary' to open and answer wires from every corner of the globe, asking \"Who is the man who plays the role of Louis XV in Passion?' Lubitsch too. And Pola Negri. All three of them — and UFA — and Para- mount, who released the film in America. There was glory and to spare for every- one who had the least thing to do with Passion. Exhibitors basked in box-office cream. UFA responded graciously and gave Louis XV a name. The name was Jannings. But the Passion affair was after- wards. Back beyond Passion, was pain, persistence, patient, plodding perfecting of a pantomimic art which eventually led to the full light of the place in the sun Jan- nings occupies today. Likewise Lubitsch. When they met in the one reeler darkness, Jannings looked down from his lofty six feet three or pain_ persistence, and six or whatever patience resulted in the perfection of pantomimic art that gives Jannings his place in the sun to- day.

That was before Jannings had any respect for motion pictures or the men who made them. It was also before Lubitsch had come to know that Jannings was a great harp for his master fingers to play upon with such genius that it is doubtful if there are two such men in the motion picture industry today. It was the day of small things, beginnings, nothings. Jannings was getting forty marks a day — Lubitsch got less, very much less. So much less that sometimes it (Com on page 101) 47 Posed especially for SCREENLAND by Miss Mary Philbin ^ODES (^Fashion Favors the Frial, and the star of 'Drums of Love' ij finds the latest styles express her natural simplicity.

Did you see her in Drums of Love? Do you remember the first closeup of Mary in the wedding scene where she wears that luscious lace veil and looks like an angel straight from heaven? Well, on the opening night in New York the audience, that had not been demon- strative up to that point, broke into wild applause when this closeup of Mary appeared. You'd think she'd get the habit and want to wear old world clothes all the time — they are so full of beauty and romance — but not Mary. She can't wait to zip into tennis togs or a simple, cool, untraily frock of the variety shown above, 'something that doesn't take all your strength to carry about,' says the diminutive young star.

(Lucila Mendez, Rudolph Cameron and Eugene Strong) CONEY ISLAND OOK, Look: Don't you know what that is? That's the Giant Dip- j per. The Coney Island Roller Coaster. It dips so deep you think you'll never come up again. Watch Lucila Mendez. Did you see her give the villain a kick — on the shin? Well, I should say not. On the chin. A high and fast little kicker that girl. Ralph Ince's new film, Coney Island has one fight after another. And the best of all when Lucila starts to — never mind, now. Never mind. Not so fast. That's one I'm not going to give away. Clowns and a millionaire. Carnivals and a political boss. A sweet, modest ticket taker and a bunch of gangsters. Plenty of Ballyhoo. Of the finest grade. This is the best film I've seen this month — or this year, for that matter. And not the least of the credit is due to J. J. O'Neill who wrote this crackling good story.
