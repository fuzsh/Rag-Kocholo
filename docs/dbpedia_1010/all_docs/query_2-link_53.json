        "text": "In 2014, British basketball claimed it had been left to fend for itself after being stripped of millions of pounds of Olympic funding by government agency UK Sport.\n\nIt was a decision taken on the back of London 2012, an event that it was claimed would create a lasting legacy for basketball in the host nation but in reality delivered another blow in a long list of setbacks that have hindered the game’s development. But it was also a decision that failed to take into account the participatory power of the sport in the UK, its enduring impact in minority and low socio-economic communities, and the value of having something to aspire to.\n\nIn many ways the move summed up the attitude to basketball from those responsible for supporting it. The story of the sport in the UK to date has been one of chronic underinvestment, disjointed thinking and curbed potential. And yet despite an overwhelming sense of neglect, the most recently available Sport England data shows that the game is the second most-played team sport in a market where it also competes with the likes of rugby, soccer and cricket.\n\nSo where, exactly, has it all gone wrong?\n\nFew people are better versed in the politics of British basketball than Kevin Routledge, who was present in the Manchester United boardroom when the British Basketball League (BBL) was formed in 1987 and today serves as a director on the professional competition’s board.\n\nIt is therefore of little surprise to hear the Canadian refer to basketball in the UK as “a great unrealised asset”.\n\n“It has a lot going for it in terms of addressing playing sport, physical activity, but actually wider social issues,” says Routledge, who has been involved with the game in the UK in various guises since 1974. “But one place it is not played at any amount is public schools. And ultimately, who makes the decisions on what we all do and where the money gets spent in this country? We’ve never had a great deal of political support overtly or behind closed doors in the smoke-filled rooms where it all gets decided what we do and how much is spent on it.\n\n“There’s been several goes at it. But what’s never happened is there’s never been targeted investment at the league level. So you’re depending on clubs, and then you’re depending on the owners of sports clubs, getting on and sharing a common vision. That’s really difficult.”\n\nBritish basketball saw its funding cut in the wake of the London 2012 Olympic Games\n\nThere is optimism, though, that a deal announced just before Christmas can apply the shot in the arm that British basketball so desperately needs. That agreement has seen the BBL sell a 45 per cent stake to private investment firm 777 Partners, which in return will put UK£7 million (US$9.5 million) towards an ambitious plan that it hopes will, over time, fuel further funding that touches every level of the sport.\n\nYet British basketball has been victim to several false dawns over the years when it comes to developing the professional game. In late 2012, the Euroleague announced it would bring its final four to London and claimed that the champion-crowning event would be one of several initiatives designed to help grow interest in the BBL. A year later, plans were rolled out for the British Basketball Association (BBA), a new competition backed by retired National Basketball Association (NBA) star John Amaechi that aimed to rival both the BBL and other leagues in Europe.\n\nRoutledge also reveals that the BBL previously held talks with Liberty prior to the media giant’s takeover of Formula One, while discussions were ongoing with a Middle Eastern group before Miami-based 777 entered the fray in June 2020.\n\nOne place it is not played at any amount is public schools. And ultimately, who makes the decisions on what we all do and where the money gets spent in this country?\n\nKevin Routledge, Director, British Basketball League and Chairman, Leicester Riders\n\nIt’s worth noting at this stage that 777 is no stranger to British basketball. Among its portfolio of professional sports team investments, which include Italian soccer club Genoa and LaLiga outfit Sevilla, are the London Lions, the BBL side who, under their new owners, have aspirations of becoming a force in European basketball. That may raise questions over a conflict of interest, but Routledge says he is “satisfied” that updates to league rules will ensure that the clubs jointly retain the majority of control.\n\nWhat’s more is that there appears to be an acknowledgement on the investor side that the Lions can only grow if the league grows with them.\n\n“We’re pretty bullish for a number of reasons that this should be the second biggest basketball league behind the NBA,” Lenz Balan, a vice president at 777, tells SportsPro. “That is not because we think that we’re some geniuses that can figure out something that nobody’s figured out before, but because we’ve seen it done before.”\n\nTo illustrate that point, Balan highlights Australia’s National Basketball League (NBL), which itself was on a road to nowhere in 2015 before then Melbourne United owner Larry Kestelman paid AUS$7 million for a controlling stake in the competition. Now, a little over five years later, the NBL has a AUS$45 million (US$32 million) domestic television deal and is widely considered to be one of the top professional leagues outside the US.\n\n“We just happen to think that the UK is an even better market for the same kind of turnaround story,” Balan continues. “And we happen to think that, in this sort of digital age, where content matters the most and being able to tell stories matters the most, you can accelerate the process that the NBL went through. So we think from a return perspective, it makes a lot of sense.”\n\n777 Partners believes that the BBL can emulate the success of Australia’s NBL, which has experienced exponential growth since being acquired by Larry Kestelman (right)\n\nThose are lofty aspirations, especially for a league which was granted a government bailout a little over 12 months ago. That was also the case for competitions in other sports to aid their Covid recovery, but few of those are starting from as far back as the BBL, which has seen a carousel of clubs come and go over the years simply because they haven’t been able to keep up with the costs of operating a team.\n\nRoutledge doubles as the owner of the Leicester Riders, the oldest club in the BBL and one of only a handful in the league that plays at its own venue. Others stage their games at either owned or rented arenas which range from 750 seats to 6,500 in capacity. With that in mind, it is no surprise that improving arenas and training facilities was one of several objectives outlined in a press release detailing 777’s investment, which will also contribute towards a digital transformation strategy, the creation of an expanded leadership team and the adoption of new technologies, as well as developing officials, upskilling gameday delivery teams and supporting clubs on operational, content and marketing initiatives.\n\nThe ten-team league has also set itself the target of adding at least four new franchises within the next five years. It was recently revealed that a consortium led by former BBL commercial director Bob Hope is looking to bring a professional outfit back to Birmingham, whose Utilita Arena hosted the recent BBL Cup final in front of a record crowd. Routledge also acknowledges Edinburgh and Liverpool as possible destinations, but adds that there are “a number of other places” the league is looking at, stressing that “we are not in a hurry”.\n\nClearly, though, there is a to-do list with many boxes to tick. So is UK£7 million really enough to deliver all that and correct the many years of underinvestment in the sport?\n\n“UK£7 million is never going to meet our ambitions, there’s no way it’s enough,” Routledge admits. “The way the world works is you get a good idea, you get investment, you deliver, then other people want to invest off the back of it. So what we are looking to do is invest, show success, and encourage other investments at the franchise level.\n\n“As well as having money, 777 have access to lots of people with money because they move in those circles. They’re tied into people. And again, the beauty of basketball and the UK is there’s all these Americans who will be encouraged. And if they see success, they’ll want to latch onto it.”\n\nOne option, of course, would be for 777 to increase its stake further down the line, but Balan says it is too early to think about that, declaring that the company is “focusing on executing what’s in front of us”. According to Routledge, that will involve meeting some “very aggressive revenue targets”. And in terms of how future turnover might be shared, Balan reveals that 777 will be reinvesting any profits back into the league “immediately”.\n\n“We’re in this for the long run,” he adds. “So if that means we have to continue to make further investments than that, then that’s exactly what we’ll do and try to do what we can to grow the league.”\n\nThe Leicester Riders are one of a handful of BBL clubs who play at their own arena\n\nRoutledge says the BBL has mapped out both a 120-day plan and a five-year plan, and there are some areas that it will be easier to upgrade sooner than others. Appointing a chief executive will therefore no doubt be a priority, while the league last week started advertising for a broadcast and content manager.\n\nYet where the BBL is hoping to be more aggressive is in enhancing its digital infrastructure. A domestic broadcast deal signed with pay-TV network Sky Sports in late 2020 put an end to several years of sporadic television coverage of the competition, but that alone, coupled with the BBL Player streaming service, will only do so much to grow reach. A cursory glance across both league and team social media accounts returns modest followings and little in the way of eye-catching, original content, so there is plenty of room for the league to think about how it can market itself to a wider audience.\n\nThat is one obvious area where 777’s expertise should prove invaluable. The company’s eclectic portfolio of investments in media and entertainment includes businesses such as over-the-top (OTT) platform provider Nunchee and Liquid Light, a production firm that specialises in creating digital content around celebrities and athletes like football quarterback Cam Newton and comedian Kevin Hart.\n\n“We’ve got lots of opportunities vertically and horizontally,” Balan considers. “The BBL is a unique thing in that it’s kind of a blank slate in a lot of ways, it hasn’t really gotten there yet. And that can be a testbed for all the other assets that we own.\n\n“Between what we have from a content perspective, the expertise we have with Liquid Light Studios in terms of building that content, what we have with that vertically integrated OTT platform, which is Fanatiz, the rights management business, Nunchee, BBL Player, I think that there’s a lot of interesting synergies that the league can sort of attach itself to and benefit from.”\n\nIf the BBL truly wants to emulate the journey of the NBL in the long run then the focus will eventually need to shift towards securing and attracting the talent that will convince more people to watch and attend its games. The Australian league’s Next Stars programme has played a huge role in recruiting up and coming players – both LeMelo Ball and R J Hampton have been through the system – who would otherwise likely be playing college basketball stateside. That, in turn, has helped grow international interest in the NBL.\n\nRoutledge and Balan believe a strong BBL would be appealing to American players given the cultural similarities, but the professional game in the UK has long struggled to keep hold of its own talent, let alone tempt some of the best from overseas. That is largely down to the absence of basic infrastructure in the UK, where a lack of indoor facilities means there are fewer opportunities for youngsters to continue playing basketball compared to other sports after they leave school.\n\nThen there is the issue of pay. According to the Independent, middle-tier players at high-profile BBL clubs could earn up to UK£4,000 (US$2,870) a month, but that figure reportedly falls as low as UK£900 (US$645) at other teams. Historically that has meant that British players seek out opportunities at other European clubs or academies – or even further afield.\n\nOne now-retired player to take that route was Steve Bucknall, who became the third English-born player to compete in the NBA when he turned out for the Los Angeles Lakers after graduating from the University of North Carolina. His career also included stints at teams in Greece, France and Italy, as well as the UK.\n\nThe former shooting guard says more money is needed “to actually make a long-term difference”, but believes 777’s investment is “a good start” and something that aspiring British players will start to take notice of.\n\n“I’m sure players would see that as something that could be life-changing, for them to be able to play at home,” Bucknall tells SportsPro. “I had the opportunity to do that on one or two occasions, but obviously financially you have to look to secure as much money as you can while you can play.\n\nThe BBL hopes it will be able to attract talent both locally and from overseas (photo credit: Mansoor Ahmed)\n\n“So until they [the BBL] can get to that level, the better players will have to seek alternative teams. But at least there will be players who play low down the leagues in other countries who can now think to themselves, ‘you know what, I don’t need to go to Spain division three or Germany division two, I could probably play here for the same money now, be close to home and maybe help myself possibly make some more revenue doing other things outside the sport.’ Sometimes when you’re in other countries, it’s impossible because of the language and because people don’t know you, so you don’t have any traction there.\n\n“So I think it’s important all round. I just think it will take time to get to that level where it’s drawing in our best players.”\n\nIndeed, patience will be essential if the BBL and its new investors are to achieve their goals. Balan reiterates his desire for the BBL to become the second biggest league in the world and says the aim is “not more complicated than that”. Routledge, meanwhile, is hopeful that the investment will lead to the sport being better recognised at the national level, help British teams play in European competition and ultimately result in a more competitive national team, as well as create a clearer pathway from the grassroots to the elite level.\n\nWe’re pretty bullish for a number of reasons that this should be the second biggest basketball league behind the NBA.\n\nLenz Balan, Vice President, 777 Partners\n\nBut for now those hopes remain precisely that. British basketball has been here before and it will need all stakeholders – clubs, national governing bodies and government – pulling in the same direction if the BBL is to succeed in growing the wider game. While 777’s investment can certainly be viewed as a start, it feels like a standing one because of what has gone before.\n\n“If we achieve three of these goals,” Balan says, “let’s say world class management team, digital infrastructure and improved broadcasts – I’m just taking three of them – that will be transformational for the sport.\n\n“I know owners get a lot of criticism but these people care, and their livelihoods are on the line with all of this. So I think all of that is a recipe for success: you’ve got partners who care, who want to see the league grow and change in a positive direction. And you really have a blank slate.\n\n“So if we execute on three of those things – and we fully intend to execute on all of them – and all of the other basketball stakeholders get that momentum and benefit from that momentum, I think we can have huge change.”"
