The winner will also receive new club equipment provided by the BBL, as well as new club branding assets.\n\nCommenting on the campaign, British Basketball League Head of Marketing and Communications, Joe Edwards said: \"We are delighted to be teaming up with Basketball England to celebrate basketball coaches across the UK. Coaches play such a pivotal role in inspiring the future generation of basketball players and their development, and I know many of our BBL players are continually inspired by both current and former coaches.\"\n\nAnthony Jepson, Marketing and Communications Director at Basketball England said: \"This is a really exciting campaign which gives coaches the recognition they so deserve and we want as many people to be involved as possible. We’re looking for those coaches who go above and beyond for their team, who help their players both on and off the court, and who make playing basketball at any level a great experience. Your post can be anything from a picture of your team, a selfie, or a video of your coach in action. Don’t forget to use the hashtags #KnowOurName and #YourCoach.\"\n\nTo enter, individuals or clubs can upload images/videos onto either Instagram or Twitter with a caption explaining why their coach deserves to be the ‘Community Coach Of The Year’ alongside the hashtags #YourCoach and #KnowOurName."
