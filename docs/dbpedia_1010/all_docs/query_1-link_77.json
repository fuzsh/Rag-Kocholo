        "text": "Cyberbehavior, as the object of study of cyberpsychology, refers to the set of human behaviors that require an electronic device with Internet access to interact with other persons in both synchronous and asynchronous ways. Although the first studies of cyberbehavior took place with the popularization of the so-called aper aims to provide a bibliometric review of the scientific publication on cyberbehavior by analyzing all the documents published by four of the most representative international journals on the topic. The results show that in spite of the growth of the scientific community, the research has focused on the use of Facebook and other social media, while relevant subject matters for psychologists (e.g., motivation, personality, Internet addiction, cyberbullying or self-expression) remain little explored.\n\nE-therapy is a new form of counselling that is arising the last years. E-therapy, cyber therapy, webcounseling, and Internet counselling are often used interchangeably. The question that arises on the ethical dilemmas since the licensing laws have not yet caught up with the rapid pace of technology. The salient ethical dimensions of e-therapy include competence, credentialing, informed consent, exceptions to confidentiality, as well as privacy and security limits (Corey, Corey, & Callanan, 2007). The informed consent (written and verbal) including the potential risks, consequences and benefits of telemedicine, or competence to practice, confidentiality, doing no harm, and on how terminations, interruption of service and payment arrangements need to be discussed. In addition, when using these technologies, it's important to conduct an initial assessment of each client to determine his or her appropriateness for telepsychology. Other factors to consider include making sure you have provided adequate emergency contact information in case your distance client faces a crisis, and ensuring that your patient's privacy and confidentiality are adequately protected by encrypting electronic transmissions and records. Furthermore the APA “Ethics Code applies to these activities across a variety of contexts, such as in person, postal, telephone, internet, and other electronic transmissions” (p. 1061). In other words, the ethical standards contain language designed for psychologists who provide services in person, via electronic media, or by other forms of communication.\n\nAbstract: Rapid and far-reaching technological advances are changing the ways in which people relate, communicate, and live. Technologies that were hardly used ten years ago, such as the Internet, e-mail, and video teleconferencing are becoming familiar methods for diagnosis, therapy, education and training. This is producing an emerging field–cybertherapy–whose focus is the use of communication and information technologies to improve the health care processes."
