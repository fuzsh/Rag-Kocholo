They can be natural, derived from animal or plant tissues, synthetic like bioceramics, or a combination of both. Natural biomaterials include substances from animal or plant tissues like dentin, bone, and collagen, while synthetic ones include materials like bioceramics, bioactive glass, and polymers. These materials are used in various dental treatments such as direct pulp capping, indirect pulp capping, partial and total pulpotomy, and pulp regeneration. This method aims to promote pulp healing and the formation of a mineralized tissue barrier, avoiding more invasive and extensive treatments. The formation of mineralized tissue is considered a favorable response of the exposed pulp tissue, showing its ability to recover. Different biomaterials, their mechanisms of action, clinical indications, applications, and future perspectives will be described in this chapter.",

        "text": "2.2.1 Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA)\n\nIt is a biomaterial derived from Portland cement, its main components consist of tricalcium silicate, dicalcium silicate, and tricalcium aluminate, supplemented with bismuth oxide to improve radiopacity [23]. Initially developed for apical perforation repair procedures, it is currently a versatile material with bioactive properties that have expanded its use to regenerative dentistry due to its ability to form a dentin barrier, stimulate the formation of hard tissues, and exhibit low cellular toxicity [24, 25, 26]. This material presents the following beneficial properties for pulp repair:\n\nExceptional biocompatibility when applied to the pulp wound\n\nSealing capacity that facilitates excellent cell/material adhesion\n\nLow solubility\n\nPrevents bacterial infiltration\n\nStimulation of mineralized matrix formation [24].\n\nMechanism of action:\n\nIt exhibits physicochemical properties due to the release of calcium ions and the alkalinity of the material, inducing the formation of reparative dentin by attracting and activating cells responsible for the formation of hard tissues, thus contributing to the development of a matrix and the mineralization process [27, 28].\n\nIt triggers the migration of progenitor cells (specifically fibroblasts) from the central pulp to the site of exposure. This process helps improve their replication and specialization into odontoblast-like cells while avoiding the induction of apoptosis in pulp cells [27].\n\nMTA initiates a time-dependent pro-inflammatory environment that facilitates wound regeneration through positive regulation of cytokines. Positive regulation of cytokines is responsible for stimulating biomineralization, achieved by the production of collagen fibrils or apatite-like groups at the interface between dentin and MTA. The release of calcium ions by MTA induces antibacterial effects and promotes mineralization in the area beneath the exposed pulp, potentially preserving pulp vitality. When used in conjunction with a sealed restoration, MTA prevents bacterial leakage and may help preserve pulp tissue, facilitate healing, and maintain pulp vitality [29, 30]. The primary calcium ion released by MTA participates in a reaction with phosphates present in tissue fluid, resulting in hydroxyapatite formation. This process makes the material biocompatible and capable of ensuring sufficient sealing [31, 32].\n\nAdvantages:\n\nThe inflammatory response triggered by MTA is transient and less severe compared to that induced by CH [33].\n\nIt has the ability to decrease levels of inflammation, hyperemia, and pulpal necrosis, while also being able to dissolve the bioactive proteins involved in the tooth repair process [28].\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nExtended setting time, which can be several hours.\n\nDifficult material manipulation.\n\nDiscoloration, currently countered with new presentations (MTA WHITE).\n\nHigh cost [17, 26, 34].\n\nClinical application of MTA in pulp-dentin regeneration:\n\nPulpotomy and partial pulpotomy\n\nApexification and periapical Surgery: Used to promote apical formation and closure in cases of open apices or periapical lesions.\n\nRetroapical filling and endodontic surgery: Preferred material for retrograde filling in endodontic surgery [35].\n\nDirect pulp capping in situations of pulp exposure, for its ability to promote reactive dentin formation [36].\n\nEfficiency\n\nEfficiency in apexification, with positive results in root apex regeneration [37]. Recent research studies have presented findings indicating that MTA demonstrates a higher rate of clinical success, induces a lower degree of pulpal inflammatory response, and facilitates the formation of mineralized tissue barriers compared to CH in DPC [38, 39, 40]. A comprehensive study involving 49 teeth with carious pulp exposure in 37 patients, where MTA was used, revealed an overall success rate of 97.96% after a span of 9 years [31]. The authors of this study claimed that MTA, when used in a two-visit treatment protocol, shows potential as a pulp capping material for direct exposures in permanent teeth [31]. In another study covering 122 teeth with caries and mechanical exposure in 108 patients, both MTA and CH were used for capping. The overall success rate of MTA for carious and mechanical exposure was 80% and 70%, respectively, while for CH it was 62% and 50%, respectively, after a duration of 1 to 6.6 years. The study concluded that after DPC, MTA appears to be more effective than CH in maintaining long-term pulpal vitality [41].\n\nA recent study conducted on 229 teeth with mechanical and carious exposure in 205 patients, using MTA and CH, revealed an overall success rate of 80% and 84% for MTA in cases of mechanical and carious exposure, respectively, while for CH, it was 57% and 70%, respectively, after a duration of 2 to 10 and 25 year. The findings of this study suggested that when used as a DPC agent, MTA provides better long-term results compared to CH, and immediate placement of a permanent restoration after DPC was recommended. Within the parameters of these studies, MTA appears to be a suitable substitute for CH in DPC [11]. Therefore, it can be stated that MTA has been established as a suitable protective agent and a reliable treatment option for exposed pulp, with a certain degree of predictability in DPC [5].\n\n2.2.2 Biodentine – dentin substitute\n\nBiodentine, a biomaterial developed by Septodont in Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France [26], has emerged as a prominent choice for dentin-pulp complex regeneration. It is a mixture of powder and liquid components containing tricalcium silicate, tricalcium aluminate, calcium carbonate, and water, demonstrating notable bioactive characteristics by releasing calcium and silicate ions [41]. Unlike other materials, it does not contain inorganic compounds such as calcium aluminate, calcium sulfate, or bismuth oxide [26, 42].\n\nThe documented efficacy of Biodentine in the dentin-pulp complex for mechanically exposed pulps is comparable to that of MTA [32].\n\nAdvantages:\n\nIt has better mechanical properties.\n\nImproved color stability.\n\nSimpler application process.\n\nFaster initial setting time compared to MTA [4, 39, 43, 44, 45].\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nIt has limitations in terms of radiopacity and achieving the desired or optimized consistency.\n\nControlled release and regeneration of ions with Biodentine may not meet all clinical needs.\n\nDespite its limitations, Biodentine remains a valuable option in dentistry for a variety of procedures, thanks to its bioactive properties and its ability to promote dentin-pulp tissue regeneration.\n\nControlled release of ions by Biodentine promotes mineralization and hard tissue formation, favoring dentin-pulp regeneration, emphasizing Biodentine’s ability to induce reparative dentin formation and its excellent biocompatibility. Biodentine has been found to release significantly higher amounts of calcium compared to CH cement and MTA [46, 47, 48, 49]. An increase in the amount of released calcium indicates a simultaneous increase in hydroxyl ions. The antibacterial properties of Biodentine are attributed to its high pH, achieved through the action of hydroxyl ions on the surrounding tissue [19]. Due to the elevated pH, a thin layer of coagulative necrosis forms between the vital pulp tissue and the pulp capping material [50]. This necrotic zone acts as a barrier between the alkaline substance pH and the pulp cells beneath it. Additionally, a reparative dentin bridge will form adjacent to it. Furthermore, Biodentine has been observed to release silicon ions into the surrounding dentin. It is hypothesized that these silicon ions produced by Biodentine aid in the formation of dentin bridges and accelerate mineralization [42]. Studies have shown that after applying Biodentine for DPC, a complete dentin bridge forms, accompanied by a less inflammatory pulpal response and well-arranged layers of odontoblasts and odontoblast-like cells [51].\n\nClinical application of biodentine in dentin-pulp regeneration\n\nThe clinical application of Biodentine in dentin and pulp restoration has been extensively studied. Research has compared the efficacy of Biodentine as a direct DPC material with that of MTA. In a 6-month evaluation, 24 teeth with carious pulp exposure were treated with MTA or Biodentine, resulting in overall success rates of 91.7% and 83.3%, respectively. Another experiment involving 68 teeth with carious pulp exposure in 54 patients showed that after 6 months of treatment, both MTA and Biodentine exhibited overall success rates of 93.5% and 93.1%, respectively. After a duration of 12 months, the achievement rates of MTA and Biodentine were 100% and 96%, respectively. A subsequent 3-year study revealed overall success rates for MTA and Biodentine of 96% and 91.7%, respectively. These findings imply that when used as materials for dental pulp coverage in fully mature permanent teeth with carious exposure, both Biodentine and MTA demonstrate favorable and comparable success rates. However, the long-term achievement of dental pulp coverage may depend on the amount of remaining healthy dental structure and the resistance of the coronal restoration [52]. Nevertheless, further evidence from clinical trials with extended follow-up periods is needed to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of Biodentine in covering exposed dental pulp.\n\nPulpotomy and partial pulpotomy: Biodentine has been shown to be effective in pulpotomies, where it is applied in the pulp chamber to preserve the vitality of the affected pulp tissue. Significant success rates have been demonstrated in pulpotomies with Biodentine, with reparative dentin formation and a favorable pulpal response.\n\nDirect pulpal sealing: In cases of direct pulp exposure during cavity preparations, Biodentine has been used for direct pulpal sealing. Its sealing capacity and compatibility with pulp tissues have been noted [6, 26].\n\nDirect pulpal capping: In situations of indirect pulp exposure, Biodentine has been applied as a direct pulp capping material, yielding positive pulpal responses and reactive dentin formation when used as a direct capping agent [26].\n\nThe efficacy and prognosis of this therapy depend on variables such as age, type of exposure, site of exposure, and degree of pulp exposure. It is worth noting that MTA has undergone more extensive evaluation as a direct pulp capping substance compared to Biodentine. Furthermore, prevailing research on Biodentine has involved a smaller number of participants compared to MTA research [42]."
