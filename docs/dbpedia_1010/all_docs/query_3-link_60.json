        "text": "FC Barcelona have gotten the upper hand in their head-to-head encounters with Real Madrid this season, having beaten their rivals five straight times across all competitions.\n\nHowever, Sarunas Jasikevicius thinks that the third-ever EuroLeague semi-final clash between the two teams will bear no resemblance to what has preceded it.\n\nAsked about the particularities of the game, the Lithuanian coach said \"it always helps to have a good start, but the game is 40 minutes. You need to know how to react. There are many ups and downs and you need to be mentally strong for 40 minutes.\"\n\n\"You have to know how to react,\" he continued.\n\n\"It will be a bit like the Cup match, in a another gym. There are usually ups and downs and you have to know how to endure the bad times and go for more in the good times.\n\nThe Lithuanian coach relativized the importance of the previous duels against Real Madrid.\n\n\"I don’t think you can forget about what happened. Tomorrow, it’s going to be a new game. We have to take into consideration what went well and what didn’t.\n\nTomorrow it’s a new story, a different situation. We have to be ready for the challenge, we can't be less hungry because we've beaten Madrid a couple of times,\" added Barca's coach.\n\nFor Jasikevicius , facing the eternal rival in the FinalFour does not add importance to the game.\n\n\"The 'El Clasico' is a huge game, but it's a EuroLeague Final Four semi-final. So it doesn't matter if it's a clasico or not. Both teams are here for the same goal, which is to reach the final\".\n\nThe 2022 Final Four in Belgrade will probably be Giorgos Printezis' career-last.\n\nThe emblematic Olympiacos Piraeus' captain is competing in his sixth tournament, which could hand him his third EuroLeague trophy. In order for his side to do that, they must get past reigning champs Anadolu Efes Istanbul in Thursday's semi-final.\n\nPrintezis joined Olympiacos in 2002 and when presenter Joe Arlauckas mentioned it at the beginning of the inaugural press conference, the 36-year forward joked about it.\n\n\"After 20 years, it doesn’t sound so good,\" he said with a smile.\n\n\"It’s a very big honor and privilege to be here. Also,for our fans. Of course, it’s not so easy because our first goal wasn’t the Final Four. We had to fight hard to get here. I am happy, like my team,\" he said.\n\nOlympiacos have won the last five semifinal games, starting from 2010. Printezis was a part of the team in 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2017, when the Reds eliminated Barcelona and CSKA Moscow the other three times to reach the final game.\n\n\"Sometimes, we used to talk about Final Fours. But all players know what they mean and what it takes to being the team here. Our coach, Sloukas and Papanikolaou have the Final Four experience and give others some advice, but I think they know the way.\"\n\nOlympiacos' captain was asked about the differences between every Final Four he's been a part of.\n\n\"Every Final Four is different,\" he replied.\n\n\"There’s always anxiety and you have to reach your goal. One difference is that Olympiacos have had three different version. First, we had a very big budget and renown players. Then, in 2012-13, we had a low budget and got back-to-back EuroLeagues.\n\nNow, we have a young new team, with the exception of me, Kostas Sloukas and Papanikolaou, we started from scratch to get to the Final Four.\"\n\nOlympiacos' fans are expected to be the overwhelming majority at the Final Four and Printezis knows how big of an impact their support can have on the team.\n\n\"Fans will give us more energy. They have done it all season long. They haven’t put any pressure on us,\" he said.\n\nFans became the protagonists in Game 5 against AS Monaco that sealed the Red's Final Four ticket.\n\n\"It was amazing. I understand that it wasn’t the right way for the game to finish, but the emotions after two years of COVID were very intense. I hope that we will give them more positive feelings in this Final Four,\" Printezis concluded.\n\nWhen Pablo Laso won the EuroLeague last time, he had Luka Doncic at his disposal.\n\nLaso is in Belgrade with Real Madrid again to win his first EuroLeague title in four years.\n\nBut the difference is that Doncic is on a different campaign now, fighting for the NBA title with the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nNBA people doubted Doncic despite winning the EuroLeague season and Final Four MVP awards in 2018.\n\nBut once again, his former coach in Madrid Pablo Laso said he didn't have any doubts on Luka's success in the NBA.\n\nHe also explained what made Luka so good.\n\n\"Luka has been a great player since he came to Madrid at age of 13. But he was a great person from that day. That makes him so big,\" Laso started.\n\n\"When people talk about NBA and how he was going to play there, I didn't have any doubts. No doubts that he's going to play good. Probably the best thing that he has as a person and as a player is that he's able to adjust to any situation. That's something you have as a person. And Luka has it. I'm very happy for him. I wish him luck for sure.\"\n\nIn an official ceremony in Belgrade, the EuroLeague Final Four officially started the process that will lead to the final winner. But before that, it was time to announce all the winners of the EuroLeague season awards.\n\nSince some of those awards were announced before the ceremony and others were only revealed during the show, we thought it was the right time to make some clarity.\n\nFor this reason, here's a quick recap of all the EuroLeague season awards and the winners of every single trophy.\n\n2021-2022 Turkish Airlines EuroLeague MVP: Nikola Mirotic (Barcelona)\n\nEuroLeague Coach of The Year: Georgios Bartzokas (Olympiacos Piraeus)\n\n2021-2022 EuroLeague Best Defender: Kyle Hines (AX Armani Exchange Milan)\n\n2021-2022 Alphonso Ford Trophy: Vasilije Micic (Anadolu Efes)\n\nRising Star Trophy: Rokas Jokubaitis (Barcelona)\n\nEuroLeague 7Day Magic Moment of the Season: Kostas Sloukas (Olympiacos)\n\n2021-2022 All-EuroLeague First Team: Mike James (Monaco), Shane Larkin (Anadolu Efes), Sasha Vezenkov (Olympiacos), Nikola Mirotic (Barcelona), Walter Tavares (Real Madrid)\n\n2021-2022 All-EuroLeague Second Team: Vasilije Micic (Anadolu Efes), Kostas Sloukas (Olympiacos), Shavon Shields (AX Armani Exchange Milan), Vladimir Lucic (Bayern Munich), Georgios Papagiannis (Panathinaikos)\n\nEuroLeague CEO Jordi Bertomeu officially opened the Final Four in Belgrade by giving opening remarks in Stark Arena.\n\nUnfortunately, it had to be started by paying respects to the German basketball legend Ademola Okulja, who passed away on Tuesday.\n\nAfter that, Bertomeu sent a message to the fans and cities of Berlin and Belgrade.\n\n\"After such a long time, we will have Final Four with fans again,\" Bertomeu said. \"The fans are exactly the reason why we are in Belgrade. As everyone knows, Final Four should have been in Berlin, but until January, we weren't sure if we'll be able to celebrate this moment with fans.\"\n\n\"And the fans are the reason why we are doing it. We couldn't have another event without fans. I want to thank the cities. First of all, Berlin and the Mercedes-Benz Arena for understanding such a difficult situation.\n\nSecondly, Belgrade and its mayor and municipality. They amazingly have been able to turn everything around in such a short time,\" added Bertomeu.\n\nEuroLeague CEO also emphasized that the competition continues to grow, adding the reason why everyone loves EuroLeague basketball.\n\n\"It's been a joy to see our arenas filling progressively after restrictions were lifted. Arenas became full of the color and energy, what makes EuroLeague what it is,\" Bertomeu said.\n\n\"Over those two years, despite everything, we still feel passion, who continue to support and cheer for our teams and players in different ways,\" he continued. \"We are extremely happy that in these times, our fanbase continues to grow, and we continue to attract devotion to new people for what they believe is the most competitive basketball competition in the world.\"\n\n\"These two years have proven that EuroLeague has an enormous resilience and is a solid and strong property which the support of the fans continues to overcome difficulties,\" Bertomeu noted.\n\nBertomeu also touched on the topic of the ongoing war in Ukraine, saying that he expects that all the unrest will end soon.\n\n\"Today's difficult time continues with the terrible ongoing war in Ukraine. We remain hopeful that peace will come soon.\n\nWe cannot forget that for the first time in 22 years, some teams that started the competition in October won't be available to finish it. This situation brings many challenges and uncertainties for everybody, which surely will last some time.\n\nDespite these challenges, this week in Belgrade, we will throw the biggest celebration in European basketball. Full of emotion, bringing people together around one passion – passion for basketball. That's why it's important to celebrate the Final Four with our fans in Belgrade and from all around the world,\" Bertomeu concluded.\n\nBarcelona star forward Nikola Mirotic was officially named EuroLeague MVP for the 2021-2022 season in an official ceremony in Belgrade.\n\nThe Montenegrin forward was the main factor behind Barcelona's success in the regular season, which ended with the Catalan side at the very top of the standings.\n\nMirotic averaged 16.6 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 1.2 assists per game during the EuroLeague regular season while also shooting an impressive 45% from 3-point. Now in his third season with Barcelona, this is the first MVP award for Mirotic.\n\nHe was also named in the first All-EuroLeague team of this season.\n\n\"It's been a big pleasure for me to receive this award from our greatest coach Zeljko Obradovic,\" Mirotic said after receiving the award. \"I would like to thank my team FC Barcelona, an entire organization, coaching staff, and all the players.\"\n\nIn the end, this is a team job. A couple of weeks ago my dear friend Nick Calathes said: 'In case you win MVP, please remember me in your speech.' I said to him I will. I want to thank Nick because he makes my life way easier on the court.\n\nHe's been an amazing teammate and friend. In the end, I want to say a couple of words about who's here today. My personal coach Vujacic, who was my first coach since I started basketball. He really pushed me very hard to get to this point, working hard all summers together. He was the person who believed in me. This trophy also goes to him,\" Mirotic added.\n\nIn 2019, the forward decided to return to European basketball despite receiving very lucrative offers to remain in the NBA.\n\nDuring the official ceremony in Belgrade, there was the official announcement for the Coach of The Year Award. For Greek head coach Georgios Bartzokas it was his second Coach of The Year award after the one that he won back in 2013.\n\nOlympiacos ended the regular season in the second place and in the playoff series they overcame the French side AS Monaco in 5 games.\n\nCoach Bartzokas returned to Olympiacos back in 2020 after spending two seasons with Russian side Khimki.\n\nBartzokas already won a EuroLeague title with Olympiacos back in 2013 and now hopes to win another one in Belgrade.\n\nEuroLeague Final Four participants are finally here in Belgrade. BasketNews share the most thrilling moments of team arrivals on Tuesday night.\n\n\"We've arrived in a thunderstorm. We will depart with the cup in a thunderstorm,\" Ergin Ataman threw another bold statement entering the hotel in Belgrade that hosts all Final Four participants.\n\nAtaman, who had his son Sarp in the hotel next to him, was more reserved giving an interview to EuroLeague TV.\n\n\"Now it's time to be calm. So far, we played great, and I made great announcements,\" Ataman smiled. \"Four, three, now two, but we have to think about Olympiacos now with all the respect.\"\n\nAmerican big man Alex Tyus is one of the veterans of European basketball. At 34, he has already achieved some great goals in his career but the majority of his great moments in European basketball are linked to Maccabi Tel Aviv. With the Israeli powerhouse, he won a EuroLeague title back in 2014 and three Israeli league championships.\n\nThis season, Tyus is playing in Turkey for Pinar Karsiyaka but in an interview with the Israeli website 'Israel Hayom' he didn't hide the fact that he would love to play again for Maccabi Tel Aviv.\n\n\"The only team that I'd play for in Israel is Maccabi Tel Aviv\", Tyus stated. \"I don't see myself returning to Israel if it's not there. If Maccabi calls, I'd be happy to come\".\n\nTyus has also an Israeli passport, which always makes him more attractive in the local market for the Israeli teams.\n\n\"There have been some talks in recent years about a potential return to Maccabi but in the end, it didn't work out\", Tyus continued. \"I'd love to return and finish my career in Tel Aviv, but even if I won't return, I'll always have good memories of my time there. The best moments in my career were with Maccabi\".\n\nTyus talked about the beautiful atmosphere of the club and the amazing support that he received from the fans.\n\n\"At Maccabi, everything is been taken care of\", Tyus explained. \"The conduct of the club is amazing and as a player, you only need to concentrate on basketball. You are always paid on time and the fans are amazing, they always create an atmosphere that pushes you to give the best\".\n\n\"Ajde, Doncic,\" the Nikola Tesla's airport staff member made way for BasketNews daily editor when he noticed him wearing Luka Doncic jerseys.\n\nOn his way to the Final Four city, Edvinas Jablonskis saluted Doncic's spectacle in Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals vs. the Phoenix Suns, where Luka went off for another remarkable 35-point performance.\n\nBut Doncic's name also has another meaning for the upcoming EuroLeague fiesta in the Serbian capital.\n\nApparently, Doncic played his last EuroLeague game in the previous Final Four that Belgrade hosted in 2018.\n\nHe left the EuroLeague floor in style as the EuroLeague champion, the Final Four MVP, and the season 2017-18 MVP.\n\nOn top of that, he made history, becoming the youngest EuroLeague season and Final Four MVP at the age of 19.\n\nWith the EuroLeague season coming to an end, the two All-EuroLeague teams were announced last week, creating some buzz as usual.\n\nWhile for the players involved in the selection, it's always a good recognition for what they did during the season, most of the talks are often dedicated to the ones left out of the two teams.\n\nWith Mike James, Shane Larkin, Sasha Vezenkov, Nikola Mirotic, and Walter Tavares forming the All-EuroLeague first team, the All-EuroLeague second team was composed of Vasilije Micic, Kostas Sloukas, Shavon Shields, Vladimir Lucic, and Georgios Papagiannis.\n\nSo now it's time to switch the conversation to the names of other players who might have been involved in the selection but, for various reasons, were left out.\n\nWho are the biggest All-EuroLeague teams snubs? Let’s try to find out some candidates.\n\nScottie Wilbekin (PG, Maccabi Tel Aviv)\n\nAfter a disappointing first part of the season that led to the decision to part ways with coach Ioannis Sfairopoulos, Maccabi Tel Aviv bounced back with coach Avi Even on the bench, winning 8 of the last 10 games played in the regular season and gaining a spot in the EuroLeague playoffs.\n\nScottie Wilbekin was hands down one of the main factors for that great final part of the season. Once again, the American point guard took most of the team's offensive load on his shoulders and delivered in the most important moments.\n\nReal Madrid will play against Barcelona in one of the most anticipated versions of 'El Clasico' in the EuroLeague semifinal in Belgrade. Yesterday, Real Madrid forward Gabriel Deck spoke to Radio Marca and talked about his feelings for this Final Four.\n\n\"I'm calm and I'm just waiting for the games\", Deck said. \"We have enjoyed the previous days, personally I'm happy to be in another Final Four, now it's time to enjoy and give it all when it'll be the time\".\n\nDeck also talked about the previous games against Barcelona during the season. Los Blancos lost both regular-season games against the Catalan side but the Argentinian forward is sure that the next one will be a very different game.\n\n\"I think everyone learned from the mistakes of the past games, it'll serve as experience for this game\", Deck explained. \"This is of course where we wanted to be, we know how dangerous they are, but it's not only about one player, it's not only Mirotic, he's surrounded by very good players, we have to work together to stop them\".\n\n\"This is the best part of the season\", Deck continued. \"The players love these moments because are unique, It's everyone's dream and desire to raise the cup. We know that we have to play with the same mentality that we had in the playoffs\".\n\nLuka Doncic led the Dallas Mavericks to the Western Conference finals where they'll face the Golden State Warriors. The matchup against Steph Curry and Klay Thompson is definitely an interesting topic but the Slovenian start believes that the real key to the Warriors is another player: Draymond Green.\n\n\"I have so much respect for Draymond as a guy, you know\", Doncic said to the reporters before Game 1 of the Western Conference finals. \"Obviously, Steph and Klay are two incredible offensive players but I think that the key to the Warriors' team is Draymond\".\n\n\"He's just unbelievable, man, I mean everything he does on the court, I really respect him\", Doncic added. \"He's not the best offensive player but he impacts the game in every other category, so I really have a lot of respect for him\".\n\nDoncic also explained that he enjoys trash-talking with Green.\n\n\"Obviously, we're gonna have some words\", Doncic said. \"But I love that part of the game, you know, it's the fun part\".\n\nAs reported by Shams Charania of The Athletic, the NBA Board of Governors is considering making a change to the transition take foul rule. The new rule would award the offensive team with one free throw and retaining possession.\n\nThe board of governors will vote on the matter in July but during the meeting that they had in Chicago there was widespread support for this change, Charania added in his report.\n\nOver the past few months, in fact, the NBA, the NBPA, and the Competition Committee had already discussed the matter to propose a change to the current rule.\n\nThe type of foul occurs when a player on defense attempts to stop a fast break by intentionally making contact with the offensive player in order to stop their momentum down court to the basket.\n\nThe NBA Draft Lottery took place last night and now we know the order for the upcoming NBA Draft. The Orlando Magic will select with the no.1 pick and the quest to understand who'll be selected as the no.1 pick now is officially on.\n\nDuke alumn Paolo Banchero was interviewed by ESPN right after the lottery and shared his thoughts about why he should be the no.1 pick in the upcoming NBA Draft.\n\n\"I feel like I'm the no.1 pick in the draft just because overall I'm the best player in the draft, I feel like I check all the boxes\", Banchero explained. \"Whether it's being a great teammate, being a star player, or doing whatever the coach needs. I've been aware of that my entire life, and when I'm going to the NBA it's not gonna change\".\n\nThe Orlando Magic won the first overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft in Tuesday night's lottery held in Chicago.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder will pick No. 2. The Houston Rockets were No. 3, and the Sacramento Kings and Detroit Pistons rounded out the top five.\n\nJimmy Butler scored 17 of his 41 points in an epic third-quarter uprising to help the host Miami Heat rally for a 118-107 (25-28, 29-34, 39-14, 25-31) victory over the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals on Tuesday night.\n\nButler also contributed nine rebounds, five assists, four steals and three blocked shots to help Miami overcome a 13-point, second-quarter deficit. The Heat outscored Boston 39-14 in the third quarter to seize a 93-76 lead entering the final stanza.\n\nTyler Herro registered 18 points and eight rebounds and Gabe Vincent scored 17 points for Miami.\n\nJayson Tatum recorded 29 points, eight rebounds, six assists and four steals for the Celtics. Jaylen Brown had 24 points and 10 rebounds, Robert Williams III added 18 points and nine rebounds and Payton Pritchard also scored 18 points for Boston.\n\nGame 2 is Thursday night in Miami.\n\nBoston Celtics big man Al Horford entered COVID-19 health and safety protocol Tuesday and will miss Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals against the host Miami Heat.\n\nThe Celtics also ruled out point guard Marcus Smart, who was considered a game-time decision due to a right mid-foot sprain.\n\nHorford is averaging 13.0 points, 9.4 rebounds and 1.4 blocks across 11 playoff games (all starts). The 35-year-old played a crucial role in Game 4 of the Celtics' second-round series with the Milwaukee Bucks, when he scored a playoff career-best 30 points on 11-for-14 shooting to help Boston even that series at two games apiece.\n\nSmart is averaging 15.0 points and 6.2 assists per game in 10 playoff games (all starts), slightly up from his regular-season averages of 12.1 points and 5.9 assists.\n\nHe had an MRI exam on Monday that detected a mid-foot sprain, which he suffered during Sunday's Game 7 triumph over the Bucks.\n\nWhen Smart missed Game 2 of the Milwaukee series with a thigh contusion, Derrick White started at point guard. Center Robert Williams III, now at full health, could draw back into the starting five in Horford's absence.\n\n--Field Level Media\n\nLuka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks will be looking to continue their regular-season mastery of Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors when the Western Conference finals tip off Wednesday night in San Francisco.\n\nOnly one game separated the teams in the regular season, and it's because of the Warriors' 53-52 edge in wins -- rather than the Mavericks' 3-1 triumph in the season series -- that Golden State has earned the home-court advantage in the best-of-seven.\n\nThe disparity in win totals is a far cry from the last time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs. That historic event 15 years ago saw the eighth-seeded Warriors, who won 25 fewer games than the Mavericks, shock top-seeded Dallas in six games in what has become known in San Francisco as the \"We Believe\" series.\n\nThe Warriors won all three of their home games in that series, and home court could be critical this time as well, with Golden State yet to lose in six games on its home floor this postseason.\n\nThe Mavericks have won five straight at home after a series-opening loss to Utah.\n\nBoth teams upset better-seeded opponents to arrive at just their second-ever meeting in the postseason. Fourth-seeded Dallas took out Phoenix, the Western Conference regular-season champ, in seven games, while third-seeded Golden State disposed of No. 2 Memphis in six games.\n\nDoncic, who averaged 32.6 points in the series against Phoenix, outscored Curry in all four regular-season head-to-heads this season. In fact, their personal duel wasn't close, with the Dallas star running up 26-14, 25-18, 34-27 and 41-21 scoring advantages.\n\nThe Mavericks didn't see the Warriors at their best, with Draymond Green missing the last three meetings and Klay Thompson missing two of the first three.\n\nThen again, the Warriors saw the Mavericks only twice after Dallas' headline-grabbing trade of Kristaps Porzingis at midseason, with newcomer Spencer Dinwiddie leading the Mavericks to wins in the last two meetings with a total of 41 points.\n\nBased on their history of having made the Western Conference finals six times in the past eight seasons and owning the home-court advantage, the Warriors go into the series as the favorite, even with coach Steve Kerr warning them not to think that way.\n\n\"Every opponent at this stage is going to pose a huge threat because only the best teams are left,\" said Kerr, who missed the last three games of the Memphis series with COVID. He has been cleared for the start of this series.\n\n\"It's all about figuring it out,\" he continued, \"and I thought our team and our staff did a really good job over the course of Games 4, 5 and 6 (against Memphis) of making that adjustment to the way the series had shifted and kind of finding a way to get through.\"\n\nThe Warriors have had two extra days of rest, having wrapped up their second-round series on Friday while the Mavericks were going the distance to a Game 7 in Phoenix on Sunday.\n\nDoncic appeared to pull from Warriors-Mavericks history when gushing over the elimination of the Suns, declaring: \"We came here with a statement in Game 7. We believed. So I'm just happy.\"\n\nBoth teams will be without one of their most famous names, with the Mavericks having lost Tim Hardaway Jr. for the season to a broken foot, while the Warriors likely will remain without Gary Payton II, who fractured his left elbow in Game 1 against the Grizzlies.\n\nGolden State expects to have veteran Otto Porter Jr. (sore foot) back for Game 1, but awaits a re-evaluation of Andre Iguodala's neck injury on Thursday before projecting his potential entry into the series.\n\n--Field Level Media\n\nAX Armani Exchange Milan and Virtus Segafredo Bologna jumped to a 2-0 lead in their best-of-five quarterfinal series of the Lega Basket Serie A playoffs.\n\nMilan crushed Pallacanestro Reggiana 91-65 (27-14, 30-18, 21-13, 13-20).\n\nLuigi Datome led the route with 16 points (2/2 2PT, 3/5 3PT, 3/3 FT), 5 rebounds, 2 assists, and 22 PIR.\n\nArmani Exchange: Luigi Datome 16 (5 REB), Sergio Rodriguez 14 (5 AST), Shavon Shields 9 (5 REB).\n\nReggiana: Andrea Cinciarini 19, Stephen Thompson 15, Mikael Hopkins 9.\n\nWith nine matches played in the last round, the LNB Pro A regular-season standings were set.\n\nLDCL ASVEL Villeurbanne (26-8) prevailed over Limoges (20-14) 79-70 (28-16, 21-19, 9-15, 21-20) and secured the first spot in the league.\n\nEuroLeague's squad will meet eight-seeded Cholet in the first playoffs stage.\n\nYoussoupha Fall guided his team to victory with 17 points (6/8 2PT, 5/7 FT) and 8 rebounds.\n\nASVEL: Youssoupha Fall 17 (8 REB), Chris Jones 13 (5 AST), Dylan Osetkowski 12, Elie Okobo 11, William Howard 10 (6 REB).\n\nLimoges: Demonte Harper 17 (7 REB), Nicolas Lang 16 (5 REB), C.J. Massinburg 15.\n\nGary Payton II could still return during the Western Conference finals, but the defensive whiz will not play in Game 1 against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday due to his elbow injury.\n\nHead coach Steve Kerr said the Warriors are encouraged by Payton's activity, which was largely limited to right-hand dominant work at practice on Tuesday.\n\nPayton could play in the best-of-seven series, but the Warriors plan to take his availability game-to-game. However, he's not expected to return this week.\n\nPayton has a fractured left elbow and ligament damage and was originally projected to return for the NBA Finals.\n\nHe was hurt in Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals series at Memphis on a rough foul that led to a suspension for Grizzlies guard Dillon Brooks.\n\nThe journeyman found a home with the Warriors as a role player who earned Kerr's endorsement for his play in tight games.\n\nPayton, 29, averaged career-highs of 7.1 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 1.4 steals in 71 regular-season games (16 starts).\n\nFrutti Extra Bursaspor eased past Fenerbahce Beko Istanbul 97-77 (21-15, 19-17, 28-29, 29-16) and tied the Turkish League quarterfinals series at one win apiece.\n\nThe decisive Game 3 is set to take place in Istanbul.\n\nEven though Bursa had plus 14 (67-53) in the third tally, Fenerbahce came within 7 points before the decisive 10 minutes of the match (61-68).\n\nNevertheless, the hosts arranged a game-deciding 10-0 spurt at the start of the fourth and gained a 15-point advantage (78-63), which was too much to handle for Fener.\n\nAndrew Andrews and Onuralp Bitim were outstanding for the winners.\n\nAndrews finished the duel with 23 points (0/5 2PT, 7/9 3PT, 2/2 FT), 6 rebounds, 4 assists, 3 steals, 1 turnover, and 28 PIR, while Bitim had 22 points (2/3 2PT, 6/9 3PT), 8 rebounds, 3 assists, 2 steals, 1 turnover, and 31 PIR.\n\nPoint guard Marcus Smart remains questionable hours before Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals and the Boston Celtics expect the decision on his availability just before tipoff in Miami on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Heat are relatively healthy but are again without point guard Kyle Lowry because of a hamstring injury.\n\nSmart, the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, continues to experience soreness in his right foot.\n\n\"The swelling is there, the soreness is there,\" Celtics coach Ime Udoka said after Tuesday's shootaround. \"We'll monitor him, how he reacts to treatment today. Long day, he has an extra hour (before tipoff) or two. He tested it out a little bit here. We'll see how it goes. It's very sore. Legitimately questionable.\"\n\nAn MRI exam on Monday detected a right midfoot sprain. Smart was injured Sunday in the Celtics' Game 7 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\n\"He took a pretty bad fall, got bent up,\" Udoka said. \"It's pretty tender and sore right now. We'll get him round-the-clock treatment.\"\n\nSmart is averaging 15.0 points and 6.2 assists per game in 10 postseason games, besting his average of 12.1 points and 5.9 assists during the regular season.\n\nHe might be most important in helping the Celtics contain Heat All-Star Jimmy Butler. Butler enters the series as the player with the most playoff experience on the Miami roster (90 games).\n\nButler said he expected to be a focal point of Boston's defense, but spared any care for the topic of how he'll be defended.\n\n\"I really don't care, honestly,\" he said.\n\nButler averaged 22 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 2.0 assists in two regular-season games against Boston this season.\n\nDante Exum grabs the rebound and waits for another opportunity to pass a ball to deadly shooter Kyle Kuric. Swish. One time. Twice. Six in a row after a shot from Michael Caicedo hit the ball to avoid the basket.\n\n\"He can't miss,\" said the Australian guard looking at BasketNews journalist during the FC Barcelona's Media Day ahead of the EuroLeague Final Four.\n\nExum and Kuric have become good friends in Barca. Both are important in Sarunas Jasikevicius' plans. When Cory Higgins was sidelined, Exum erupted as a key piece for the Blaugranas.\n\nMeanwhile, Kuric is still the best executor for the Lithuanian playbook. Despite some injury problems in the last few days, the American sharpshooter will be ready to rumble at Belgrade.\n\nExum attended the media after the practice in the middle of Palau Blaugrana's court.\n\n\"I am excited to play the Final Four. We are waiting to get out of there and show what we are capable of. We want to win. It won't be easy, but we are ready,\" stated Dante, while Kuric was next to him nodding his head.\n\nOn the verge of a historical title-defense journey in Euroleague, Ergin Ataman answered the question of Ismail Senol from Bein Sports. If Anadolu Efes win, they will be only the third team to complete a back-to-back in the competition after Maccabi Playtika Tel Aviv and Olympiacos Piraeus.\n\n\"I don't feel much pressure about winning back to back based on the fact that there are so few teams managing to do so,\" says Ataman.\n\n\"The only pressure will come from being required to play in front of 20,000 fans in Belgrade and playing against a good team. I don’t get fazed by historical milestone achievements,” he added.\n\nThe defending champions did not have an easy path to the semi-finals as many people had serious doubts about Anadolu Efes repeating previous years’ success. Efes won half of their first 18 games, and the prospects were not bright.\n\n\"If we got these results early in the season in my first year at Efes, I would not be able to keep my position on the bench, which would be normal,\" Ataman admits. \"There is a great amount of investment here, and anything less than Final Four would be a failure. But of course, I had some credit from the previous seasons.\"\n\nPablo Laso will be in his 7th EuroLeague Final Four as Real Madrid's head coach. No other coach has been it more times in the last decade.\n\nThe Spanish mastermind attended the media in the press conference ahead of Belgrade, some hours before the Blancos took off to the Serbian capital.\n\nLaso confirmed that only Carlos Alocen will be sidelined at the event, but he will travel with the team too.\n\n\"I see my team prepared for the Final Four. Everyone is ready except Alocen,\" Laso said.\n\nReal Madrid struggled as never before during March, downgrading from 2nd seed to 4th in the EuroLeague regular season. An unexpected streak that turned on all the alarms in the Casa Blanca.\n\nFar from sinking, Madrid bounced back as they used to, improving the offensive fluency. They will face FC Barcelona in the semifinals with a nine-game winning streak. More than a month without a loss.\n\n\"I understand that a month ago no one believed in us. I did. I don't think we were that bad, but it's also true that in the last month we have competed very well and that the series against Maccabi gave us confidence,\" Laso admitted.\n\nSergio Scariolo has explained his contractual situation with Virtus Segafredo Bologna and the Spanish national team, following the reports about his departure from the NT at the end of EuroBasket 2022.\n\nThe 61-year-old Italian specialist gave an official statement to AS.com.\n\n\"I don't know where certain rumors come from. I don't usually comment on them, but maybe it's worth clarifying that my contract with Virtus explicitly allows me to participate in the National Team Windows.\n\nMy deal with the Spanish Basketball Federation runs until the end of the 2024 Olympic Games. I find it extremely offensive to doubt about credibility and seriousness of my directors as if they can consider anything other than complying with the letter of the contract.\n\nWith good logistical work and calendar harmonization, we can do exactly what Igor Kokoskov did for two years at Fenerbahce. That could limit the coincidence of my presence in the club and the national team to the maximum,\" Sergio Scariolo stated.\n\nOn November 5, following Olympiacos Piraeus' home win over AS Monaco (86-65), coach Giorgos Bartzokas provided a comment on his team's latest addition.\n\n\"We would have signed Quincy Acy, even if he was point guard,\" the Greek tactician emphasized.\n\nWell, in hindsight, Bartzokas might just as well have said that the Reds would have picked Acy even if he was going to play only in the Greek League.\n\nBecause that's what really happened. Seven months after the NBA veteran first set his foot in Piraeus, he has only appeared in four EuroLeague regular-season games.\n\nOver a total playing time of roughly 10 minutes, Acy made only one 3-point shot, which ironically came in the only one Olympiacos home loss against Crvena Zvezda.\n\nIn the Greek League, the 31-year-old forward has played 14 games, with an average of 10 minutes per contest. That's still three minutes less than guard Michalis Lountzis, the 12th man on the Reds' roster. Somewhat surprisingly, Acy has gone over 50% from distance in domestic competition, boasting an astounding team-best 15/29 shooting beyond the arc.\n\nThe forward from Texas came to Olympiacos to bolster their defensive prowess, carrying 337 NBA games with seven different teams (Raptors, Kings, Knicks, Mavericks, Nets, Suns) under his belt.\n\nBut more importantly, a very promising EuroLeague rookie season with Maccabi Tel Aviv (2019-20), which was cut short by COVID in March 2020.\n\nDespite measuring only 2.01 m. Quincy Acy's ability to support the switch-all defense that Giorgos Bartzokas like to play made him even more attractive.\n\nBeing a second-round pick in the 2012 NBA Draft (No. 37), Acy quickly realized that he would need to do whatever it takes for his team to get the win without paying any attention to his individual stats.\n\nWith him on the court, Maccabi conceded only 0.79 points per possession when Acy guarded his personal opponent one-on-one; 0.86 points per possession in post-up situations, and 1.0 points when he went to the perimeter.\n\nHis 2019-20 campaign generated 4.8 points and 3.5 rebounds per outing over 27 appearances, including 19 starts, in Europe's premier club competition.\n\nBrooklyn Nets superstar Kevin Durant will be the main protagonist of a one-on-one interview with legendary David Letterman. The full interview will be available as a part of the new series of Letterman's show 'My Next Guest Needs No Introduction' on Netflix from May 20.\n\nA small conversation segment between Durant and Letterman has already been released. Durant focused on his involvement as an advocate for the legalization of marijuana, which is already legal in 18 states around the USA.\n\nMarijuana is still considered a prohibited substance in the NBA, although the league decided not to test the players for marijuana during the bubble in Orlando, and for this season, they suspended the random testing.\n\nDuring the interview, Durant revealed that he started to smoke weed when he was 22 years old, and that helps him to clear his mind, especially during very stressful moments.\n\n\"For me, it's like having a glass of wine,\" Durant said.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets star actually confessed to Letterman that he had smoked right before the interview and that he was high at that moment.\n\nDurant is involved in the cannabis business with some partners and hopes to de-stigmatize the narrative surrounding marijuana and athletes.\n\nEuroleague Basketball and the 2022 Turkish Airlines EuroLeague Final Four's participating teams would like to provide the following recommendations to all fans who will be traveling to Belgrade.\n\nEuroLeague Final Four 2022 will take place from 19-21 May in Belgrade.\n\nDO arrive early to the arena so that you can enter the arena comfortably on time to cheer for your team. Gates will be open 2h45min before the start of the game.\n\nDO follow all instructions of the organizers and local authorities to make sure everyone has an enjoyable experience in the arena.\n\nDO stay in your seats for the games and for the trophy ceremony to make sure you don’t miss any of the action on the court.\n\nMoving outside of the assigned areas is not allowed and, if not following the recommendations of the arena staff, may result in being invited to leave the arena and reported to the local authorities.\n\nDO bring a good attitude, have fun cheering for your team in an enjoyable and respectful way. Any offensive acts or messages may result in the perpetrator being invited to leave the arena and reported to the local authorities.\n\nDON’T bring in flags that are larger than 2sqm; they are not allowed by Serbian law.\n\nDON’T bring in any pyrotechnics; they are not allowed by Serbian law.\n\nDON’T come to the Final Four if you don’t have a ticket to enter the arena.\n\nSemifinal schedule:\n\nOlympiacos vs Anadolu Efes at 6 pm CET (19 May)\n\nBarcelona vs Real Madrid at 9 pm CET (19 May)\n\nIn his first season with Barcelona, Rokas Jokubaitis has already proved his value. The 21-year-old Lithuanian guard was named Rising Star of the season in EuroLeague and gained an important role inside coach Jasikevicius' rotations.\n\nBut the future of Jokubaitis isn't linked only to Barcelona and Spain but also to New York and the NBA.\n\nIn the 2021 NBA Draft, Rokas Jokubaitis was selected with the 34th pick overall by the Knicks and there's the general expectation that the Lithuanian guard will end up playing in the NBA sooner rather than later.\n\nDespite the good performances of this season, Jokubaitis is not expected to join the Knicks next season.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, the Knicks are leaning towards letting Jokubaitis stay in Europe for at least another season so that he can have more minutes and a stable role.\n\nAccording to the NY Post, the Knicks are also skeptical that Barcelona will allow Jokubaitis to play in the Summer League during the offseason.\n\nThe Lithuanian guard averaged 7.2 points and 2.8 assists per game in EuroLeague.\n\nIf you still want to experience the Final Four in Belgrade, prepare to pony up some cash.\n\n\"The prices are even higher than for the New Year's Eve,\" the Airbnb host told the BasketNews crew during the check-in.\n\nIn some particular cases, one night's stay for the standard Saturday night compared to the Final Four weekend could rise from €88 to €647. In most cases, the prices go up 4-7 times.\n\nMost of the hotels offer the last available rooms for this week.\n\nMoreover, the upcoming EuroLeague Final Four in Belgrade affected the ABA League playoffs in a way no one expected.\n\nThe pricing alone is not the only problem for ABA League teams - there are simply no physical rooms or hotels left where visiting teams could stay.\n\nThat's mainly because the entire Belgrade is packed with EuroLeague representatives and fans who came for the biggest event of the European basketball season.\n\nBuducnost Podgorica and Cedevita Olimpija Ljubljana forced ABA League Game 3 against Partizan and Crvena Zvezda in the best of three series.\n\nThese do-or-die games are expected to be played after the EuroLeague Final Four, sources say BasketNews.\n\nAccording to sources, Partizan is expected to host Buducnost Podgorica on Sunday, and Crvena Zvezda should host Cedevita Olimpija Ljubljana on Monday.\n\nBelgrade will be colored in red this week.\n\nAccording to Giorgos Kyriakidis, Olympiacos Piraeus could see up to 10,000 - or even more- of their fans cheer for them in the Stark Arena, where the allowed capacity will be around 15,500.\n\nVirtus Bologna secured a spot in the next EuroLeague after winning the EuroCup title against Bursaspor. This was great news for Virtus and the city of Bologna, it was less good news for the Spanish national team though.\n\nWith Virtus Bologna playing in EuroLeague next season, in fact, it'll be very difficult for coach Sergio Scariolo to coach both teams, especially during the FIBA windows for the national teams.\n\nAccording to Encestando, the Spanish federation already knows that coach Scariolo will leave his job as head coach of the national team at the end of EuroBasket. Although there might be even the possibility of him leaving his role before EuroBasket since Virtus Bologna would love to have the coach at his full capacity already during the pre-season in September.\n\nOne of the names that the Spanish federation is considering as a potential replacement for coach Scariolo is Joan Penarroya, the current head coach of Valencia.\n\nPenarroya, though, is on an expiring contract and the general expectation is that he'll leave the club at the end of the season.\n\nTurkish powerhouse Anadolu Efes will fight for a new EuroLeague title this week in Belgrade, but before heading to Serbia, they took some time to remember and celebrate their 2021 EuroLeague victory.\n\nOn Monday, Anadolu Efes unveiled a monument to remember their last season's victory in front of the Sinan Erdem Arena.\n\nTurkey sports minister Mehmet Kasapoglu attended the ceremony, while all the official ranks of Anadolu Efes were also present, including president Tuncay Ozilhan, all players, and coach Ergin Ataman.\n\nThe Turkish sports minister Mehmet Kasapoglu stated that the EuroLeague title won by Efes last season will be a driving force for the Turkish basketball movement moving forward.\n\n\"I have absolute faith that the EuroLeague title that brought us together here today will be a new driving force for Turkish basketball,\" said Kasapoglu.\n\nThe 4th seeded Dallas Mavericks delivered a surprising victory by 33 points in Game 7 over the Phoenix Suns. They won the series 4-3 against the regular-season leaders, who went to a league-best 64-18 record this campaign. With this Game 7 victory, Mavs tied the 5th biggest win in an entire NBA history, and now Dallas is set to face the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference final.\n\nArgentinian guard Nicolas Laprovittola has been hands down one of the best players for Barcelona this season. After joining the Catalan side from Real Madrid, some were skeptical about his potential impact on coach Jasikevicius' side but Laprovittola quickly became one of the key pieces for Barcelona.\n\nThe player gave an interview to the Spanish website AS and talked about his impressive season and the upcoming EuroLeague Final Four.\n\n\"I feel well but now a big challenge is coming, this will be my first Final Four, what can I tell?\", Laprovittola said during the interview.\n\n\"We had different injuries throughout the season, you know, between Calathes and Higgins, but even without them we kept playing well and winning, we reacted in the right way. Now they're back and they'll be available but I'm still playing well and I feel comfortable\", Laprovittola continued.\n\nTalking about his impressive season, the Argentinian guard confessed that it's going even better than he expected.\n\n\"I think that this season exceeded my expectations\", Laprovittola revealed. \"Both my personal ones and the club's ones. But I always trusted my game, I knew what I could give. Today I'm in a different role, I play more like a guard, as a scorer. I think I found my game\".\n\nLaprovittola also talked about the Final Four and the chances of Barcelona winning the Euroleague.\n\n\"The feeling that I had since I arrived at this team has always been the same, that the EuroLeague is the most important goal for this club. We've arrived here in Belgrade but the job is not done yet\".\n\nNikola Mirotic was not included in the All-ACB team announced by the Spanish league on Sunday.\n\nFor that reason, FC Barcelona have expressed their disagreement with the All-ACB team of the season through Josep Cubells - an executive responsible for the Blaugranas basketball team, sources told BasketNews.\n\nThe Catalan club does not understand how it could be possible that a player who has been elected to the All-EuroLeague First Team is not included in the domestic league's one.\n\nCubells expressed his discomfort to the ACB for Mirotic's absence, requesting a review and a turnaround of the voting systems.\n\nInstead, Dzanan Musa (Rio Breogan), Marcelinho Huertas (Lenovo Tenerife), Nico Laprovittola (Barcelona), Chima Moneke (BAXI Manresa), and Giorgi Shermadini (Lenovo Tenerife) were included in the All-ACB team.\n\nThroughout the regular ACB season, Mirotic averaged 14.8 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 16.7 EFF.\n\nMeanwhile, in the EuroLeague, his numbers were 16.7 points, 5.1 rebounds, 1.3 assists, and 19.4 PIR.\n\nThe votes for the All-Team ACB are divided into four branches: fans, players, coaches, and media. Each of them has a 25% in the final saying.\n\nDespite some difficulties that the French side ASVEL lived this season, president Tony Parker has no intention to make a change on the bench.\n\nThe former NBA star, in fact, stated that he wants to extend the contract of T.J. Parker at least until 2026, as he revealed to the French newspaper 'Le Progres'.\n\nT.J. Parker became the head coach of ASVEL back in 2020 and since then he won one French league title and one French cup.\n\nWith the intention of extending his brother's contract until 2026, Tony Parker puts to the rest the rumors of a potential NCAA coaching job for T.J. Parker that have been circulating in the past few weeks.\n\nASVEL finished the EuroLeague regular season at the bottom of the standings, together with Zalgiris Kaunas, with a record of 8 wins and 20 losses.\n\nIt's gonna be an interesting summer for Phoenix Suns big man Deandre Ayton. After failing to reach an agreement with the Suns on a contract extension last summer, Ayton will become a restricted free agent this offseason and his future might be away from Phoenix after all.\n\nAccording to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, Ayton didn't feel valued enough by the Suns last summer, when the franchise decided to not offer him a max contract extension. Ayton didn't want to move from the max offer request so the two sides, in the end, decided to wait for the restricted free agency.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers and San Antonio Spurs are two teams mentioned by Wojnarowski with enough cap space to make a suitable offer for Ayton when the free agency will begin.\n\nBut even teams without enough cap space available to sign Ayton right away are studying sign & trade possibilities that might be intriguing for the Suns if the franchise will decide to move away from Ayton and they would want to be compensated with some future assets.\n\nThe big man averaged 17.2 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game this season with the Suns.\n\nOn the eve of the Euroleague Final Four in Belgrade, you might be coming across Bryant Dunston's name mostly in the context of EuroLeague's record books. As he is the current holder of the all-time blocks record of the competition, it is all legit.\n\nBut actually, he has a much bigger place in European basketball than just numbers.\n\nAs he is getting ready for his 3rd Final Four and a potential championship game, Dunston revealed his thought in an interview with Ismail Senol from Bein Sports Turkey.\n\n\"I am not someone who cares about the stats that much,\" Dunston admits.\n\nSome shots were fired yesterday in the ESPN studios. Minnesota Timberwolves point guard Pat Beverley was a guest on the show 'Get Up', which is co-hosted by former NBA player J.J. Redick.\n\nDuring the show, Pat Beverley heavily criticized Chris Paul for his lack of performance in the series that the Suns lost to the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference semifinals.\n\nThose comments, though, didn't sit well with Matt Barnes, another former NBA player and now an analyst for ESPN.\n\nBarnes, during ESPN Today, called Beverley a clown for his comments regarding Chris Paul, saying that the Minnesota Timberwolves guard was way out of the line.\n\n\"I feel like what Pat Beverley did today to Chris Paul was completely disrespectful and out of the line\", Barnes said during the show.\n\n\"Beverley is talking like he's that guy, well, you're not that guy, plain and simple\", Barnes continued. \"Chris Paul played terrible in this series and his numbers are still better than your career numbers have ever been\".\n\n\"All he needed was the red clown nose cause he was out there talking like a clown today\", Barnes said of Beverley. \"CP3 is a legend of this game, we were role players in this game, so have some respect for the guy. He played terribly but he'd be the first to tell you that, Bev's comments were out of the line\".\n\nSometimes NBA contract clauses can be a bit wild. Just look at what might happen to Spencer Dinwiddie. The Dallas Mavericks guard, who joined the team at the deadline from the Washington Wizards, has a very particular clause in his contract.\n\nIf the Dallas Mavericks will win the NBA title, Dinwiddie will receive the bonus, which is something not very uncommon, but the particular aspect of that clause is actually the amount of the bonus.\n\nThe shooting guard will receive a $1 dollar bonus if the Dallas Mavericks will win the title. Yep, just one single dollar, not a million, just one dollar.\n\nAfter signing the original contract with the Washington Wizards, as noted by reporter Fred Katz of The Athletic, Dinwiddie actually joked about the clause and said: 'I want it to be paid in pennies\".\n\nThe American guard is averaging 13.7 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 5.2 assists per game.\n\nAlthough their relationship had some ups and downs, especially in their last season together, former Dallas Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle, now with the Indiana Pacers, has very few doubts about the future of Mavs star Luka Doncic.\n\nCoach Carlisle spoke to a radio show and talked about the amazing impact that Doncic is having on the Mavericks during the NBA playoffs and how great his career will be moving forward.\n\n\"I don't have any question in my mind that there'll be multiple MVPs in his future\", coach Carlisle said of Doncic. \"There'll be championships in his future. He has a real, great, natural sense for the moment\".\n\nCoach Carlisle also praised the changes that current Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd was able to bring in this season, especially on the defensive end.\n\n\"Jason was able to bring an attitude that was needed\", coach Carlisle commented.\n\nAfter defeating the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference semifinals, the Dallas Mavericks will now face the Golden State Warriors in the conference finals.\n\nDuring these playoffs, Luka Doncic is averaging 31.5 points, 10.1 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 2 steals per game, while shooting 34.7% from three-point.\n\nAn emergency protector order was granted by Jefferson County Family Court in Louisville on Friday, two days after the alleged incident occurred.\n\nAccording to the woman's court filing, per WDRB.com in Louisville, Rondo \"became enraged\" after she asked him to stop playing video games with a child in her home so the child could assist with doing the laundry.\n\nAfter the child stopped playing, Rondo allegedly ripped the video game from the wall, destroyed several items in the home and left, saying to the woman, \"You're dead.\"\n\nRondo allegedly returned to the home with a gun, demanding to see the children, but the woman didn't let him back into the house. The children reportedly were \"visibly upset and clearly scared that Rajon continued to brandish a gun.\"\n\nThe woman then called former interim Louisville Metro Police chief Yvette Gentry, who reportedly came to the scene.\n\nPer multiple media reports, the court order issued Friday against Rondo prohibits him from getting within 500 feet of the woman and the children and prevents him from trying to communicate with her.\n\nAccording to ESPN, an NBA spokesman said the league is investigating the incident and is \"in the process of gathering more information.\" Rondo's representatives didn't reply to a request for comment, ESPN reported.\n\nRondo, 36, split the current season between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Cleveland Cavaliers, averaging a combined 4.8 points, 4.4 assists and 2.8 rebounds in 39 games (one start).\n\nA four-time All-Star, Rondo earned championship rings with the Boston Celtics in 2008 and the Lakers in 2020. He has career averages of 9.8 points, 7.9 assists and 4.5 rebounds in 957 games (733 starts) for the Celtics, Dallas Mavericks, Sacramento Kings, Chicago Bulls, New Orleans Pelicans, Lakers, Atlanta Hawks, Los Angeles Clippers and Cavaliers.\n\nA Louisville native, Rondo played at the University of Louisville before Boston selected him with the 21st overall pick in the 2006 draft.\n\n--Field Level Media\n\nFive-star Oregon commit Marquis \"Mookie\" Cook, one of the top prospects in the Class of 2023, will star as a young LeBron James in an upcoming movie about James' time as a high school basketball star.\n\n\"Shooting Stars\" will be a film adaptation of a book by the same name co-authored by James and Buzz Bissinger that tells the story of James and his friends playing for a high school national championship. It is set for a 2023 release on Peacock.\n\nCook committed to Oregon on March 31, choosing the Ducks over Gonzaga and Kentucky. He is the fifth-ranked prospect in the class, according to the 247Sports composite rankings.\n\nLike James, Cook plays small forward. He is listed at 6-foot-7, not far off from James' 6-9.\n\nAnother up-and-coming prospect will star alongside Cook. Scoot Henderson, who plays in the G-League Ignite and will be eligible for the 2023 NBA Draft, will play the role of James' friend Romeo Travis.\n\n--Field Level Media\n\nThe Miami Heat on Monday listed guard Kyle Lowry as out for Tuesday's Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Boston Celtics.\n\nLowry has missed six of Miami's 11 playoff games thus far with a nagging hamstring injury. He missed the first two games of the Heat's semifinal series against the Philadelphia 76ers before returning for Games 3 and 4.\n\nIn those two games, he combined for six points on 3-for-14 shooting before missing Games 5 and 6. Miami won the series 4-2.\n\nLowry averaged 13.4 points, 7.5 assists and 4.5 rebounds per game in 63 games (all starts) in the regular season, his first with Miami.\n\nThe Heat also listed four players as questionable for Tuesday's Game 1 in Miami: Caleb Martin (sprained left ankle), Max Strus (strained right hamstring), PJ Tucker (strained right calf) and Gabe Vincent (strained left hamstring).\n\n--Field Level Media\n\nPallacanestro Varese officially announced the club's CEO Luis Scola expressed the desire to the directors and team's owners to exercise the option of acquiring 51% of the club shares, as required by the contract signed last summer.\n\nThe operation will become official only after all the required bureaucratic procedures have been completed. The terms of the agreement are and will remain private and confidential, via the report.\n\n\"I am extremely happy with this possibility. I am confident that this solution can lead to major success in the future,\" Scola said.\n\nThe legendary Luis Scola began a new chapter in his life last September.\n\nThe 42-year-old finished his playing career after Argentina lost to Australia in the Tokyo Olympic Games quarterfinals and ended their quest for the medals.\n\nVarese was the last team in Scola's professional basketball career.\n\nThroughout his journey, Scola became the Spanish League winner (2002), three times Spanish Cup (2002, 2004, 2006), and three times Spanish Supercup winner (2005, 2006, 2007). He was also named Spanish League MVP twice (2005, 2007).\n\nWith his country, Scola won the gold medal in Athens Olympic Games in 2004 and a bronze medal in Beijing in 2008.\n\nHe also has two silver medals from FIBA World Cup in 2002 and 2019. Moreover, Scola won two gold (2001 and 2011), four silver (2003, 2007, 2015, 2017), and three bronze (1999, 2009, 2013) medals in FIBA AmeriCup tournaments.\n\nFinally, Scola also won the gold medal in Pan American Games in 2019.\n\nTwo-time NBA champ Rajon Rondo allegedly pulled a gun on the mother of his children and threatened to kill her during a heated altercation, while the woman claims their kids witnessed the whole thing, according to TMZ Sports.\n\nThe alleged incident occurred on May 11, while Rondo was playing video games with their son and Ashley Bachelor (Rondo's former partner and mother of his two kids) asked the boy to help fold laundry.\n\nAs reported by TMZ, Bachelor says Rajon became enraged and ripped the game console out of the wall in front of the kid. The NBAer then continued the destructive behavior, smashing everything from a teacup to outdoor lights and trash cans.\n\nThe kids were upset after witnessing their dad losing it, so Bachelor tried to \"deescalate\" the situation. Though, she says Rajon responded by making a death threat, saying, \"You're dead.\"\n\nAfter leaving the premises briefly, Rondo allegedly returned with a gun.\n\nWith his mom and dad both arriving at home, Rondo eventually left the scene.\n\nIn her emergency order of protection, Bachelor wrote that Rondo \"has a history of volatile, erratic, explosive behavior\" and is \"verbally, emotionally, and financially abusive.\"\n\n\"He physically hits our son and calls him names like 'p***y' and accuses him of acting like a 'b**ch'.\n\nRajon verbally assaults our daughter. He calls her names like 't**t, b**ch, and d**khead'. Rajon has made several threats on my life, saying at various times he will shoot me or shoot up my car,\" Ashley Bachelor stressed.\n\nRondo has yet to be arrested and charged with any crime, via TMZ. The 36-year-old point guard split time between the Los Angeles Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2021-22 season."
