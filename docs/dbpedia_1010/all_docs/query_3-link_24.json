Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-243,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-243, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated the influence of anthropogenic water withdrawals and climatic changes on streambed drying the Dreisam valley (24 km²) in Germany by means of physical modeling. The model was able to reproduce streambed drying at 50 % of locations. Our results show that groundwater withdrawals intensifiy riverbed drying on short timescales during phases with low groundwater levels at specific locations. At some upstream locations however, climatic preconditions are the primary influencing factor.\n\nDrought intensityâdurationâfrequency curves based on deficit in precipitation and streamflow for water resources management\n\nYonca Cavus, Kerstin Stahl, and Hafzullah Aksoy\n\nHydrol.

Every drop of water is more valuable than before when drought is experienced particularly. We developed drought intensity–duration–frequency curves using physical indicators, the deficit in precipitation and streamflow, for a more straightforward interpretation. Tests with the observed major droughts in two climatologically different catchments confirmed the practical applicability of the curves under drought conditions.\n\nPanta Rhei benchmark dataset: socio-hydrological data of paired events of floods and droughts\n\nHeidi Kreibich, Kai SchrÃ¶ter, Giuliano Di Baldassarre, Anne F.

We present a dataset containing data of paired events, i.e. two floods or two droughts that occurred in the same area. The dataset enables comparative analyses and allows detailed context-specific assessments. Additionally, it supports the testing of socio-hydrological models.\n\nAssessing agriculture's vulnerability to drought in European pre-Alpine regions\n\nRuth Stephan, Stefano Terzi, Mathilde Erfurt, Silvia Cocuccioni, Kerstin Stahl, and Marc Zebisch\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 45–64, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-45-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-45-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study maps agriculture's vulnerability to drought in the European pre-Alpine regions of Thurgau (CH) and Podravska (SI). We combine region-specific knowledge with quantitative data mapping; experts of the study regions, far apart, identified a few common but more region-specific factors that we integrated in two vulnerability scenarios. We highlight the benefits of the participatory approach in improving the quantitative results and closing the gap between science and practitioners.\n\nDifferent drought types and the spatial variability in their hazard, impact, and propagation characteristics\n\nErik Tijdeman, Veit Blauhut, Michael Stoelzle, Lucas Menzel, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2099–2116, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2099-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2099-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe identified different drought types with typical hazard and impact characteristics. The summer drought type with compounding heat was most impactful. Regional drought propagation of this drought type exhibited typical characteristics that can guide drought management. However, we also found a large spatial variability that caused distinct differences among propagating drought signals. Accordingly, local multivariate drought information was needed to explain the full range of drought impacts.\n\nAn inventory of Alpine drought impact reports to explore past droughts in a mountain region\n\nRuth Stephan, Mathilde Erfurt, Stefano Terzi, Maja Å½un, BoÅ¡tjan Kristan, Klaus Haslinger, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 2485–2501, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2485-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2485-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Alpine Drought Impact report Inventory (EDIIALPS) archives drought impact reports across the European Alpine region with an increasing number of impacts over time. The most affected sectors are agriculture and livestock farming and public water supply, for which management strategies are essential for future climate regimes. We show spatial heterogeneity and seasonal differences between the impacted sectors and between impacts triggered by soil moisture drought and hydrological drought.\n\nHydrological response to warm and dry weather: do glaciers compensate?\n\nMarit Van Tiel, Anne F. Van Loon, Jan Seibert, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 3245–3265, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3245-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3245-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlaciers can buffer streamflow during dry and warm periods, but under which circumstances can melt compensate precipitation deficits? Streamflow responses to warm and dry events were analyzed using long-term observations of 50 glacierized catchments in Norway, Canada, and the European Alps. Region, timing of the event, relative glacier cover, and antecedent event conditions all affect the level of compensation during these events. This implies that glaciers do not compensate straightforwardly.\n\nGroundwater and baseflow drought responses to synthetic recharge stress tests\n\nJost Hellwig, Michael Stoelzle, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 1053–1068, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1053-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1053-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPotential future groundwater and baseflow drought hazards depend on systems' sensitivity to altered recharge conditions. With three generic scenarios, we found different sensitivities across Germany driven by hydrogeology. While changes in drought hazard due to seasonal recharge shifts will be rather low, a lengthening of dry spells could cause stronger responses in regions with slow groundwater response to precipitation, urging local water management to prepare for more severe droughts.\n\nThe CH-IRP data set: a decade of fortnightly data on Î´2H and Î´18O in streamflow and precipitation in Switzerland\n\nMaria Staudinger, Stefan Seeger, Barbara Herbstritt, Michael Stoelzle, Jan Seibert, Kerstin Stahl, and Markus Weiler\n\nEarth Syst.

CH-IRP contains fortnightly time series of stable water isotopes from streamflow grab samples complemented by time series in precipitation. Sampling conditions, catchment and climate information, lab standards and errors are provided together with areal precipitation and catchment boundaries.\n\nTropical drought risk: estimates combining gridded vulnerability and hazard data\n\nAlexandra Nauditt, Kerstin Stahl, Erasmo RodrÃ­guez, Christian Birkel, Rosa Maria Formiga-Johnsson, Kallio Marko, Hamish Hann, Lars Ribbe, Oscar M.

We used gridded drought hazard and vulnerability data sets to map drought risk in four mesoscale rural tropical study regions in Latin America and Vietnam/Cambodia. Our risk maps clearly identified drought risk hotspots and displayed spatial and sector-wise distribution of hazard and vulnerability. As results were confirmed by local stakeholders our approach provides relevant information for drought managers in the Tropics.\n\nA multidisciplinary drought catalogue for southwestern Germany dating back toÂ 1801\n\nMathilde Erfurt, Georgios Skiadaresis, Erik Tijdeman, Veit Blauhut, JÃ¼rgen Bauhus, RÃ¼diger Glaser, Julia Schwarz, Willy Tegel, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 2979–2995, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-2979-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-2979-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDroughts are multifaceted hazards with widespread negative consequences for the environment and society. This study explores different perspectives on drought and determines the added value of multidisciplinary datasets for a comprehensive understanding of past drought events in southwestern Germany. A long-term evaluation of drought frequency since 1801 revealed that events occurred in all decades, but a particular clustering was found in the mid-19th century and the most recent decade.\n\nStress testing as complement to climate scenarios: recharge scenarios to quantify streamflow drought sensitivity\n\nMichael Stoelzle, Maria Staudinger, Kerstin Stahl, and Markus Weiler\n\nProc. IAHS, 383, 43–50, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-43-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-43-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe role of recharge and catchment storage is crucial to understand streamflow drought sensitivity. Here we introduce a model experiment with recharge stress tests as complement to climate scenarios to quantify the streamflow drought sensitivities of catchments in Switzerland. We identified a pre-drought period of 12 months as maximum storage-memory for the study catchments. From stress testing, we found up to 200 days longer summer streamflow droughts and minimum flow reductions of 50 %–80 %.\n\nThe challenges of hydrological drought definition, quantification and communication: an interdisciplinary perspective\n\nKerstin Stahl, Jean-Philippe Vidal, Jamie Hannaford, Erik Tijdeman, Gregor Laaha, Tobias Gauster, and Lena M. Tallaksen\n\nProc. IAHS, 383, 291–295, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-291-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-291-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNumerous indices exist for the description of hydrological drought, some are based on absolute thresholds of overall streamflows or water levels and some are based on relative anomalies with respect to the season. This article discusses paradigms and experiences with such index uses in drought monitoring and drought analysis to raise awareness of the different interpretations of drought severity.\n\nBeyond binary baseflow separation: a delayed-flow index for multiple streamflow contributions\n\nMichael Stoelzle, Tobias Schuetz, Markus Weiler, Kerstin Stahl, and Lena M. Tallaksen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 849–867, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-849-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-849-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDuring dry weather, different delayed sources of runoff (e.g. from groundwater, wetlands or snowmelt) modulate the magnitude and variability of streamflow. Hydrograph separation methods often do not distinguish these delayed contributions and mostly pool them into only two components (i.e. quickflow and baseflow). We propose a method that uncovers multiple components and demonstrates how they better reflect streamflow generation processes of different flow regimes.\n\nEffects of univariate and multivariate bias correction on hydrological impact projections in alpine catchments\n\nJudith Meyer, Irene Kohn, Kerstin Stahl, Kirsti Hakala, Jan Seibert, and Alex J. Cannon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1339–1354, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1339-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1339-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSeveral multivariate bias correction methods have been developed recently, but only a few studies have tested the effect of multivariate bias correction on hydrological impact projections. This study shows that incorporating or ignoring inter-variable relations between air temperature and precipitation can have a notable effect on the projected snowfall fraction. The effect translated to considerable consequences for the glacio-hydrological responses and streamflow components of the catchments.\n\nAn assessment of trends and potential future changes in groundwater-baseflow drought based on catchment response times\n\nJost Hellwig and Kerstin Stahl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 6209–6224, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-6209-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-6209-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDue to the lack of long-term observations, insights into changes of groundwater resources are obscured. In this paper we assess past and potential future changes in groundwater drought in headwater catchments using a baseflow approach. There are a few past trends which are highly dependent on the period of analysis. Catchments with short response times are found to have a higher sensitivity to projected seasonal precipitation shifts, urging for a local management based on response times.\n\nTechnical note: Representing glacier geometry changes in a semi-distributed hydrological model\n\nJan Seibert, Marc J. P. Vis, Irene Kohn, Markus Weiler, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2211–2224, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2211-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2211-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn many glacio-hydrological models glacier areas are assumed to be constant over time, which is a crucial limitation. Here we describe a novel approach to translate mass balances as simulated by the (glacio)hydrological model into glacier area changes. We combined the Δh approach of Huss et al. (2010) with the bucket-type model HBV and introduced a lookup table approach, which also allows periods with advancing glaciers to be represented, which is not possible with the original Huss method.\n\nHuman influences on streamflow drought characteristics in England and Wales\n\nErik Tijdeman, Jamie Hannaford, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 1051–1064, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1051-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1051-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, a screening approach was applied on a set of streamflow records for which various human influences are indicated to identify streamflow records that have drought characteristics that deviate from those expected under pristine conditions. Prolonged streamflow drought duration, a weaker correlation between streamflow and precipitation, and changes in streamflow drought occurrence over time were related to human influences such as groundwater abstractions or reservoir operations.\n\nThe role of glacier changes and threshold definition in the characterisation of future streamflow droughts in glacierised catchments\n\nMarit Van Tiel, Adriaan J. Teuling, Niko Wanders, Marc J. P. Vis, Kerstin Stahl, and Anne F. Van Loon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 463–485, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-463-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-463-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlaciers are important hydrological reservoirs. Short-term variability in glacier melt and also glacier retreat can cause droughts in streamflow. In this study, we analyse the effect of glacier changes and different drought threshold approaches on future projections of streamflow droughts in glacierised catchments. We show that these different methodological options result in different drought projections and that these options can be used to study different aspects of streamflow droughts.\n\nDeveloping drought impact functions for drought risk management\n\nSophie Bachmair, Cecilia Svensson, Ilaria Prosdocimi, Jamie Hannaford, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nNat.

In terms of low flow magnitude, a region around the Czech Republic was most affected, with return periods > 100 yr. In terms of deficit volumes, the drought was particularly severe around S. Germany where the event lasted notably long. Meteorological and hydrological events developed differently in space and time. For an assessment of drought impacts on water resources, hydrological data are required in addition to meteorological indices.\n\nControls on hydrologic drought duration in near-natural streamflow in Europe and the USA\n\nErik Tijdeman, Sophie Bachmair, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nHydrol.

Drought can be alleviated or made worse by human activities and drought impacts are dependent on a myriad of factors. In this paper, we identify research gaps and suggest a framework that will allow us to adequately analyse and manage drought in the Anthropocene. We need to focus on attribution of drought to different drivers, linking drought to its impacts, and feedbacks between drought and society.\n\nEstimating drought risk across Europe from reported drought impacts, drought indices, and vulnerability factors\n\nVeit Blauhut, Kerstin Stahl, James Howard Stagge, Lena M.

We therefore exploited text-based data from the European Drought Impact report Inventory (EDII) to evaluate drought indicators, empirically determine indicator thresholds, and model drought impacts. A quantitative analysis using Germany and the UK as a testbed proved to be a useful tool for objectively appraising drought indicators.\n\nAttribution of European precipitation and temperature trends to changes in synoptic circulation\n\nA.

Using a Europe-wide survey of water managers, we examine four areas: increasing drought risk, impacts, drought management strategies, and their evolution. Despite growing risks, management remains fragmented and short-term. However, signs of improvement suggest readiness for change. We advocate for a European Drought Directive.\n\nReview article: Drought as a continuum: memory effects in interlinked hydrological, ecological, and social systems\n\nAnne F.

In this paper we review the literature and discuss five cases, where drought, its impacts and responses develop differently over time. We look at the hydrological, ecological and social system and their connections. And we provide suggestions for further research and for monitoring, modelling and management.\n\nHESS Opinions: Drought impacts as failed prospects\n\nGermano G. Ribeiro Neto, Sarra Kchouk, Lieke A. Melsen, Louise Cavalcante, David W. Walker, Art Dewulf, Alexandre C. Costa, Eduardo S. P. R. Martins, and Pieter R. van Oel\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4217–4225, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4217-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4217-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPeople induce and modify droughts. However, we do not know exactly how relevant human and natural processes interact nor how to evaluate the co-evolution of people and water. Prospect theory can help us to explain the emergence of drought impacts leading to failed welfare expectations (“prospects”) due to water shortage. Our approach helps to explain socio-hydrological phenomena, such as reservoir effects, and can contribute to integrated drought management considering the local context.\n\nMind the Gap: Misalignment Between Drought Monitoring and Community Realities\n\nSarra Kchouk, Louise Cavalcante, Lieke A. Melsen, David W. Walker, Germano Ribeiro Neto, Rubens Gondim, Wouter J. Smolenaars, and Pieter R. van Oel\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2726,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2726, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDroughts impact water and people, yet monitoring often overlooks impacts on people. In Northeast Brazil, we assess official data against local experiences, finding data mismatches and blindspots. Mismatches occur due to the data's broad scope missing finer details. Blindspots arise from ignoring diverse community responses and vulnerabilities to droughts. We suggest enhanced monitoring by technical extension officers for both severe and mild droughts.â\n\nInferring reservoir filling strategies under limited-data-availability conditions using hydrological modeling and Earth observations: the case of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD)\n\nAwad M. Ali, Lieke A. Melsen, and Adriaan J. Teuling\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4057–4086, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4057-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4057-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a new approach based on a combination of modeling and Earth observation, useful information about the filling of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam can be obtained with limited data and proper rainfall selection. While the monthly streamflow into Sudan has decreased significantly (1.2 × 109–5 × 109 m3) with respect to the non-dam scenario, the negative impact has been masked due to higher-than-average rainfall. We reveal that the dam will need 3–5 more years to complete filling.\n\nAn investigation of anthropogenic influences on hydrologic connectivity using stress tests\n\nAmelie Herzog, Jost Hellwig, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-243,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-243, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated the influence of anthropogenic water withdrawals and climatic changes on streambed drying the Dreisam valley (24 km²) in Germany by means of physical modeling. The model was able to reproduce streambed drying at 50 % of locations. Our results show that groundwater withdrawals intensifiy riverbed drying on short timescales during phases with low groundwater levels at specific locations. At some upstream locations however, climatic preconditions are the primary influencing factor.\n\nDrought intensityâdurationâfrequency curves based on deficit in precipitation and streamflow for water resources management\n\nYonca Cavus, Kerstin Stahl, and Hafzullah Aksoy\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3427–3445, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3427-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3427-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWith intensified extremes under climate change, water demand increases. Every drop of water is more valuable than before when drought is experienced particularly. We developed drought intensity–duration–frequency curves using physical indicators, the deficit in precipitation and streamflow, for a more straightforward interpretation. Tests with the observed major droughts in two climatologically different catchments confirmed the practical applicability of the curves under drought conditions.\n\nLinking reported drought impacts with drought indices, water scarcity and aridity: the case of Kenya\n\nMarleen R. Lam, Alessia MatanÃ³, Anne F. Van Loon, Rhoda A. Odongo, Aklilu D. Teklesadik, Charles N. Wamucii, Marc J. C. van den Homberg, Shamton Waruru, and Adriaan J. Teuling\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2915–2936, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2915-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2915-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere is still no full understanding of the relation between drought impacts and drought indices in the Horn of Africa where water scarcity and arid regions are also present. This study assesses their relation in Kenya. A random forest model reveals that each region, aggregated by aridity, has its own set of predictors for every impact category. Water scarcity was not found to be related to aridity. Understanding these relations contributes to the development of drought early warning systems.\n\nIndicator-to-impact links to help improve agricultural drought preparedness in Thailand\n\nMaliko Tanguy, Michael Eastman, Eugene Magee, Lucy J. Barker, Thomas Chitson, Chaiwat Ekkawatpanit, Daniel Goodwin, Jamie Hannaford, Ian Holman, Liwa Pardthaisong, Simon Parry, Dolores Rey Vicario, and Supattra Visessri\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2419–2441, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2419-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2419-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDroughts in Thailand are becoming more severe due to climate change. Understanding the link between drought impacts on the ground and drought indicators used in drought monitoring systems can help increase a country's preparedness and resilience to drought. With a focus on agricultural droughts, we derive crop- and region-specific indicator-to-impact links that can form the basis of targeted mitigation actions and an improved drought monitoring and early warning system in Thailand.\n\nPropagation from meteorological to hydrological drought in the Horn of Africa using both standardized and threshold-based indices\n\nRhoda A. Odongo, Hans De Moel, and Anne F. Van Loon\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2365–2386, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2365-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2365-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe characterize meteorological (P), soil moisture (SM) and hydrological (Q) droughts and the propagation from one to the other for 318 catchments in the Horn of Africa. We find that propagation from P to SM is influenced by soil properties and vegetation, while propagation from P to Q is from catchment-scale hydrogeological properties (i.e. geology, slope). We provide precipitation accumulation periods at the subbasin level that can be used as a proxy in drought forecasting in dryland regions.\n\nSnowâvegetationâatmosphere interactions in alpine tundra\n\nNorbert Pirk, Kristoffer Aalstad, Yeliz A. Yilmaz, Astrid Vatne, Andrea L. Popp, Peter Horvath, Anders Bryn, Ane Victoria Vollsnes, Sebastian Westermann, Terje Koren Berntsen, Frode Stordal, and Lena Merete Tallaksen\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2031–2047, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2031-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2031-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measured the landâatmosphere exchange of CO2 and water vapor in alpine Norway over 3 years. The extremely snow-rich conditions in 2020 reduced the total annual evapotranspiration to 50 % and reduced the growing-season carbon assimilation to turn the ecosystem from a moderate annual carbon sink to an even stronger source. Our analysis suggests that snow cover anomalies are driving the most consequential short-term responses in this ecosystemâs functioning.\n\nPanta Rhei benchmark dataset: socio-hydrological data of paired events of floods and droughts\n\nHeidi Kreibich, Kai SchrÃ¶ter, Giuliano Di Baldassarre, Anne F.

We present a dataset containing data of paired events, i.e. two floods or two droughts that occurred in the same area. The dataset enables comparative analyses and allows detailed context-specific assessments. Additionally, it supports the testing of socio-hydrological models.\n\nLarge spread in the representation of compound long-duration dry and hot spells over Europe in CMIP5\n\nColin Manning, Martin Widmann, Douglas Maraun, Anne F. Van Loon, and Emanuele Bevacqua\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 4, 309–329, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-309-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-309-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate models differ in their representation of dry spells and high temperatures, linked to errors in the simulation of persistent large-scale anticyclones. Models that simulate more persistent anticyclones simulate longer and hotter dry spells, and vice versa. This information is important to consider when assessing the likelihood of such events in current and future climate simulations so that we can assess the plausibility of their future projections.\n\nPersistent La NiÃ±as drive joint soybean harvest failures in North and South America\n\nRaed Hamed, Sem Vijverberg, Anne F. Van Loon, Jeroen Aerts, and Dim Coumou\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 255–272, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-255-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-255-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSpatially compounding soy harvest failures can have important global impacts. Using causal networks, we show that soy yields are predominately driven by summer soil moisture conditions in North and South America. Summer soil moisture is affected by antecedent soil moisture and by remote extra-tropical SST patterns in both hemispheres. Both of these soil moisture drivers are again influenced by ENSO. Our results highlight physical pathways by which ENSO can drive spatially compounding impacts.\n\nA data-driven model for Fennoscandian wildfire danger\n\nSigrid JÃ¸rgensen Bakke, Niko Wanders, Karin van der Wiel, and Lena Merete Tallaksen\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 65–89, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-65-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-65-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we developed a machine learning model to identify dominant controls of wildfire in Fennoscandia and produce monthly fire danger probability maps. The dominant control was shallow-soil water anomaly, followed by air temperature and deep soil water. The model proved skilful with a similar performance as the existing Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI). We highlight the benefit of using data-driven models jointly with other fire models to improve fire monitoring and prediction.\n\nAssessing agriculture's vulnerability to drought in European pre-Alpine regions\n\nRuth Stephan, Stefano Terzi, Mathilde Erfurt, Silvia Cocuccioni, Kerstin Stahl, and Marc Zebisch\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 45–64, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-45-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-45-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study maps agriculture's vulnerability to drought in the European pre-Alpine regions of Thurgau (CH) and Podravska (SI). We combine region-specific knowledge with quantitative data mapping; experts of the study regions, far apart, identified a few common but more region-specific factors that we integrated in two vulnerability scenarios. We highlight the benefits of the participatory approach in improving the quantitative results and closing the gap between science and practitioners.\n\nInferring surface energy fluxes using drone data assimilation in large eddy simulations\n\nNorbert Pirk, Kristoffer Aalstad, Sebastian Westermann, Astrid Vatne, Alouette van Hove, Lena Merete Tallaksen, Massimo Cassiani, and Gabriel Katul\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 7293–7314, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-7293-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-7293-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we show how sparse and noisy drone measurements can be combined with an ensemble of turbulence-resolving wind simulations to estimate uncertainty-aware surface energy exchange. We demonstrate the feasibility of this drone data assimilation framework in a series of synthetic and real-world experiments. This new framework can, in future, be applied to estimate energy and gas exchange in heterogeneous landscapes more representatively than conventional methods.\n\nSpatiotemporal changes of drought area as input for a machine-learning approach for crop yield prediction\n\nVitali Diaz, Ahmed A. A. Osman, Gerald A. Corzo Perez, Henny A. J. Van Lanen, Shreedhar Maskey, and Dimitri Solomatine\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci.

The hypothesis is that the spatiotemporal change of drought area is a good input to predict CY. A step-by-step approach for predicting CY is built based on two types of machine learning models. Drought area was found suitable for predicting CY. Since it is currently possible to calculate drought areas within drought monitoring systems, the prediction of drought impacts can be integrated directly into them.\n\nLessons from the 2018â2019 European droughts: a collective need for unifying drought risk management\n\nVeit Blauhut, Michael Stoelzle, Lauri Ahopelto, Manuela I.

We therefore questioned the existence and effect of current drought management strategies on the actual impacts and how drought is perceived by relevant stakeholders. Over 700 participants from 28 European countries provided insights into drought hazard and impact perception and current management strategies. The study concludes with an urgent need to collectively combat drought risk via a European macro-level drought governance approach.\n\nDifferent drought types and the spatial variability in their hazard, impact, and propagation characteristics\n\nErik Tijdeman, Veit Blauhut, Michael Stoelzle, Lucas Menzel, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2099–2116, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2099-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2099-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe identified different drought types with typical hazard and impact characteristics. The summer drought type with compounding heat was most impactful. Regional drought propagation of this drought type exhibited typical characteristics that can guide drought management. However, we also found a large spatial variability that caused distinct differences among propagating drought signals. Accordingly, local multivariate drought information was needed to explain the full range of drought impacts.\n\nInvited perspectives: A research agenda towards disaster risk management pathways in multi-(hazard-)risk assessment\n\nPhilip J.

In the international research and policy community it is recognised that risk management could benefit from a more systemic approach. In this perspective paper, we argue for an approach that addresses multi-hazard, multi-risk management through the lens of sustainability challenges that cut across sectors, regions, and hazards.\n\nEducation, financial aid, and awareness can reduce smallholder farmers' vulnerability to drought under climate change\n\nMarthe L. K. Wens, Anne F. van Loon, Ted I. E. Veldkamp, and Jeroen C. J. H. Aerts\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 1201–1232, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-1201-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-1201-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we present an application of the empirically calibrated drought risk adaptation model ADOPT for the case of smallholder farmers in the Kenyan drylands. ADOPT is used to evaluate the effect of various top-down drought risk reduction interventions (extension services, early warning systems, ex ante cash transfers, and low credit rates) on individual and community drought risk (adaptation levels, food insecurity, poverty, emergency aid) under different climate change scenarios.\n\nA geography of drought indices: mismatch between indicators of drought and its impacts on water and food securities\n\nSarra Kchouk, Lieke A. Melsen, David W. Walker, and Pieter R. van Oel\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 323–344, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-323-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-323-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe aim of our study was to question the validity of the assumed direct linkage between drivers of drought and its impacts on water and food securities, mainly found in the frameworks of drought early warning systems (DEWSs). We analysed more than 5000 scientific studies leading us to the conclusion that the local context can contribute to drought drivers resulting in these drought impacts. Our research aims to increase the relevance and utility of the information provided by DEWSs.\n\nImpacts of compound hotâdry extremes on US soybean yields\n\nRaed Hamed, Anne F. Van Loon, Jeroen Aerts, and Dim Coumou\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 1371–1391, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1371-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1371-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoy yields in the US are affected by climate variability. We identify the main within-season climate drivers and highlight potential compound events and associated agricultural impacts. Our results show that soy yields are most negatively influenced by the combination of high temperature and low soil moisture during the summer crop reproductive period. Furthermore, we highlight the role of temperature and moisture coupling across the year in generating these hot–dry extremes and linked impacts.\n\nMachine-learning approach to crop yield prediction with the spatial extent of drought\n\nVitali Diaz, Ahmed A. A. Osman, Gerald A. Corzo Perez, Henny A. J. Van Lanen, Shreedhar Maskey, and Dimitri Solomatine\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci.

The hypothesis is that the drought spatial extent is a good input to predict CY. A machine learning approach to predict crop yield is introduced. The use of drought area was found suitable. Since it is currently possible to calculate drought areas within drought monitoring systems, the direct application to predict drought effects can be integrated into them by following approaches such as the one presented or similar.\n\nThe UNESCO FRIEND-Water program: accelerates, shares and transfers knowledge and innovation in hydrology across the world in the frame of the Intergovernmental Hydrological Program (IHP)\n\nGil MahÃ©, Gamal Abdo, Ernest Amoussou, Telesphore Brou, Stephan Dietrich, Ahmed El Tayeb, Henny van Lanen, Mohamed Meddi, Anil Mishra, Didier Orange, Thi Phuong Quynh Le, Raphael Tshimanga, Patrick Valimba, Santiago Yepez, Andrew Ogilvie, and Oula Amrouni\n\nProc.

Wendt, John P. Bloomfield, Anne F. Van Loon, Margaret Garcia, Benedikt Heudorfer, Joshua Larsen, and David M. Hannah\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 3113–3139, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-3113-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-3113-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nManaging water demand and supply during droughts is complex, as highly pressured human–water systems can overuse water sources to maintain water supply. We evaluated the impact of drought policies on water resources using a socio-hydrological model. For a range of hydrogeological conditions, we found that integrated drought policies reduce baseflow and groundwater droughts most if extra surface water is imported, reducing the pressure on water resources during droughts.\n\nNumerical daemons of hydrological models are summoned by extreme precipitation\n\nPeter T. La Follette, Adriaan J. Teuling, Nans Addor, Martyn Clark, Koen Jansen, and Lieke A. Melsen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 5425–5446, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-5425-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-5425-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHydrological models are useful tools that allow us to predict distributions and movement of water. A variety of numerical methods are used by these models. We demonstrate which numerical methods yield large errors when subject to extreme precipitation. As the climate is changing such that extreme precipitation is more common, we find that some numerical methods are better suited for use in hydrological models. Also, we find that many current hydrological models use relatively inaccurate methods.\n\nAn inventory of Alpine drought impact reports to explore past droughts in a mountain region\n\nRuth Stephan, Mathilde Erfurt, Stefano Terzi, Maja Å½un, BoÅ¡tjan Kristan, Klaus Haslinger, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 2485–2501, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2485-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2485-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Alpine Drought Impact report Inventory (EDIIALPS) archives drought impact reports across the European Alpine region with an increasing number of impacts over time. The most affected sectors are agriculture and livestock farming and public water supply, for which management strategies are essential for future climate regimes. We show spatial heterogeneity and seasonal differences between the impacted sectors and between impacts triggered by soil moisture drought and hydrological drought.\n\nStreamflow drought: implication of drought definitions and its application for drought forecasting\n\nSamuel J. Sutanto and Henny A. J. Van Lanen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 3991–4023, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3991-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3991-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper provides a comprehensive overview of the differences within streamflow droughts derived using different identification approaches, namely the variable threshold, fixed threshold, and the Standardized Streamflow Index, including an analysis of both historical drought and implications for forecasting. Our results clearly show that streamflow droughts derived from different approaches deviate from each other in terms of drought occurrence, timing, duration, and deficit volume.\n\nHydrological response to warm and dry weather: do glaciers compensate?\n\nMarit Van Tiel, Anne F. Van Loon, Jan Seibert, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 3245–3265, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3245-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3245-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlaciers can buffer streamflow during dry and warm periods, but under which circumstances can melt compensate precipitation deficits? Streamflow responses to warm and dry events were analyzed using long-term observations of 50 glacierized catchments in Norway, Canada, and the European Alps. Region, timing of the event, relative glacier cover, and antecedent event conditions all affect the level of compensation during these events. This implies that glaciers do not compensate straightforwardly.\n\nSeasonal discharge response to temperature-driven changes in evaporation and snow processes in the Rhine Basin\n\nJoost Buitink, Lieke A. Melsen, and Adriaan J. Teuling\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 387–400, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-387-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-387-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigher temperatures influence both evaporation and snow processes. These two processes have a large effect on discharge but have distinct roles during different seasons. In this study, we study how higher temperatures affect the discharge via changed evaporation and snow dynamics. Higher temperatures lead to enhanced evaporation but increased melt from glaciers, overall lowering the discharge. During the snowmelt season, discharge was reduced further due to the earlier depletion of snow.\n\nClimate change impacts model parameter sensitivity â implications for calibration strategy and model diagnostic evaluation\n\nLieke Anna Melsen and BjÃ¶rn Guse\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 1307–1332, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1307-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1307-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCertain hydrological processes become more or less relevant when the climate changes. This should also be visible in the models that are used for long-term predictions of river flow as a consequence of climate change. We investigated this using three different models. The change in relevance should be reflected in how the parameters of the models are determined. In the different models, different processes become more relevant in the future: they disagree with each other.\n\nThe impact of hydrological model structure on the simulation of extreme runoff events\n\nGijs van Kempen, Karin van der Wiel, and Lieke Anna Melsen\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 961–976, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-961-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-961-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we combine climate model results with a hydrological model to investigate uncertainties in flood and drought risk. With the climate model, 2000 years of current climate was created. The hydrological model consisted of several building blocks that we could adapt. In this way, we could investigate the effect of these hydrological building blocks on high- and low-flow risk in four different climate zones with return periods of up to 500 years.\n\nBehind the scenes of streamflow model performance\n\nLaurÃ¨ne J. E. Bouaziz, Fabrizio Fenicia, Guillaume Thirel, Tanja de Boer-Euser, Joost Buitink, Claudia C. Brauer, Jan De Niel, Benjamin J. Dewals, Gilles Drogue, Benjamin Grelier, Lieke A. Melsen, Sotirios Moustakas, Jiri Nossent, Fernando Pereira, Eric Sprokkereef, Jasper Stam, Albrecht H. Weerts, Patrick Willems, Hubert H. G. Savenije, and Markus Hrachowitz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 1069–1095, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1069-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1069-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantify the differences in internal states and fluxes of 12 process-based models with similar streamflow performance and assess their plausibility using remotely sensed estimates of evaporation, snow cover, soil moisture and total storage anomalies. The dissimilarities in internal process representation imply that these models cannot all simultaneously be close to reality. Therefore, we invite modelers to evaluate their models using multiple variables and to rely on multi-model studies.\n\nGroundwater and baseflow drought responses to synthetic recharge stress tests\n\nJost Hellwig, Michael Stoelzle, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 1053–1068, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1053-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1053-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPotential future groundwater and baseflow drought hazards depend on systems' sensitivity to altered recharge conditions. With three generic scenarios, we found different sensitivities across Germany driven by hydrogeology. While changes in drought hazard due to seasonal recharge shifts will be rather low, a lengthening of dry spells could cause stronger responses in regions with slow groundwater response to precipitation, urging local water management to prepare for more severe droughts.\n\nImproving the representation of high-latitude vegetation distribution in dynamic global vegetation models\n\nPeter Horvath, Hui Tang, Rune Halvorsen, Frode Stordal, Lena Merete Tallaksen, Terje Koren Berntsen, and Anders Bryn\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 95–112, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-95-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-95-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluated the performance of three methods for representing vegetation cover. Remote sensing provided the best match to a reference dataset, closely followed by distribution modelling (DM), whereas the dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) in CLM4.5BGCDV deviated strongly from the reference. Sensitivity tests show that use of threshold values for predictors identified by DM may improve DGVM performance. The results highlight the potential of using DM in the development of DGVMs.\n\nFlood spatial coherence, triggers, and performance in hydrological simulations: large-sample evaluation of four streamflow-calibrated models\n\nManuela I. Brunner, Lieke A. Melsen, Andrew W. Wood, Oldrich Rakovec, Naoki Mizukami, Wouter J. M. Knoben, and Martyn P. Clark\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 105–119, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-105-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-105-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAssessments of current, local, and regional flood hazards and their future changes often involve the use of hydrologic models. A reliable model ideally reproduces both local flood characteristics and regional aspects of flooding. In this paper we investigate how such characteristics are represented by hydrologic models. Our results show that both the modeling of local and regional flood characteristics are challenging, especially under changing climate conditions.\n\nCreative practice as a tool to build resilience to natural hazards in the Global South\n\nAnne F. Van Loon, Imogen Lester-Moseley, Melanie Rohse, Phil Jones, and Rosie Day\n\nGeosci. Commun., 3, 453–474, https://doi.org/10.5194/gc-3-453-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gc-3-453-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Global South is vulnerable to natural hazards like floods and droughts, but creativity could support community preparedness. We mapped 267 papers that use a variety of art forms. They aim to raise the public's awareness or instigate adaptation by participants. In our pilot in South Africa, community members developed stories about preparing for future drought. This led to an imagination of future events, conversations about adaptation, intergenerational exchange, and increased awareness.\n\nA distributed simple dynamical systems approach (dS2 v1.0) for computationally efficient hydrological modelling at high spatio-temporal resolution\n\nJoost Buitink, Lieke A. Melsen, James W. Kirchner, and Adriaan J. Teuling\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 6093–6110, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-6093-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-6093-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a new distributed hydrological model: the distributed simple dynamical systems (dS2) model. The model is built with a focus on computational efficiency and is therefore able to simulate basins at high spatial and temporal resolution at a low computational cost. Despite the simplicity of the model concept, it is able to correctly simulate discharge in both small and mesoscale basins.\n\nThe 2018 northern European hydrological drought and its drivers in a historical perspective\n\nSigrid J. Bakke, Monica Ionita, and Lena M. Tallaksen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 5621–5653, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5621-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5621-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study provides an in-depth analysis of the 2018 northern European drought. Large parts of the region experienced 60-year record-breaking temperatures, linked to high-pressure systems and warm surrounding seas. Meteorological drought developed from May and, depending on local conditions, led to extreme low flows and groundwater drought in the following months. The 2018 event was unique in that it affected most of Fennoscandia as compared to previous droughts.\n\nThe CH-IRP data set: a decade of fortnightly data on Î´2H and Î´18O in streamflow and precipitation in Switzerland\n\nMaria Staudinger, Stefan Seeger, Barbara Herbstritt, Michael Stoelzle, Jan Seibert, Kerstin Stahl, and Markus Weiler\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 12, 3057–3066, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-3057-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-3057-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe data set CH-IRP provides isotope composition in precipitation and streamflow from 23 Swiss catchments, being unique regarding its long-term multi-catchment coverage along an alpine–pre-alpine gradient. CH-IRP contains fortnightly time series of stable water isotopes from streamflow grab samples complemented by time series in precipitation. Sampling conditions, catchment and climate information, lab standards and errors are provided together with areal precipitation and catchment boundaries.\n\nTropical drought risk: estimates combining gridded vulnerability and hazard data\n\nAlexandra Nauditt, Kerstin Stahl, Erasmo RodrÃ­guez, Christian Birkel, Rosa Maria Formiga-Johnsson, Kallio Marko, Hamish Hann, Lars Ribbe, Oscar M. Baez-Villanueva, and Joschka Thurner\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2020-360,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2020-360, 2020\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecurrent droughts are causing severe damages to tropical countries. We used gridded drought hazard and vulnerability data sets to map drought risk in four mesoscale rural tropical study regions in Latin America and Vietnam/Cambodia. Our risk maps clearly identified drought risk hotspots and displayed spatial and sector-wise distribution of hazard and vulnerability. As results were confirmed by local stakeholders our approach provides relevant information for drought managers in the Tropics.\n\nA multidisciplinary drought catalogue for southwestern Germany dating back toÂ 1801\n\nMathilde Erfurt, Georgios Skiadaresis, Erik Tijdeman, Veit Blauhut, JÃ¼rgen Bauhus, RÃ¼diger Glaser, Julia Schwarz, Willy Tegel, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 2979–2995, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-2979-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-2979-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDroughts are multifaceted hazards with widespread negative consequences for the environment and society. This study explores different perspectives on drought and determines the added value of multidisciplinary datasets for a comprehensive understanding of past drought events in southwestern Germany. A long-term evaluation of drought frequency since 1801 revealed that events occurred in all decades, but a particular clustering was found in the mid-19th century and the most recent decade.\n\nAsymmetric impact of groundwater use on groundwater droughts\n\nDoris E. Wendt, Anne F. Van Loon, John P. Bloomfield, and David M. Hannah\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 4853–4868, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-4853-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-4853-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGroundwater use changes the availability of groundwater, especially during droughts. This study investigates the impact of groundwater use on groundwater droughts. A methodological framework is presented that was developed and applied to the UK. We identified an asymmetric impact of groundwater use on droughts, which highlights the relation between short-term and long-term strategies for sustainable groundwater use.\n\nGlobal distribution of hydrologic controls on forest growth\n\nCaspar T. J. Roebroek, Lieke A. Melsen, Anne J. Hoek van Dijke, Ying Fan, and Adriaan J. Teuling\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 4625–4639, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-4625-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-4625-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVegetation is a principal component in the Earth system models that are used for weather, climate and other environmental predictions. Water is one of the main drivers of vegetation; however, the global distribution of how water influences vegetation is not well understood. This study looks at spatial patterns of photosynthesis and water sources (rain and groundwater) to obtain a first understanding of water access and limitations for the growth of global forests (proxy for natural vegetation).\n\nHydrological Drought Characteristics Based on Groundwater and Runoff Across Europe\n\nSamuel Jonson Sutanto and Henny A. J. Van Lanen\n\nProc. IAHS, 383, 281–290, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-281-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-281-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper aims to analyze hydrological drought characteristics in the pan-European region based on past drought events from 1990 to 2017. Our study shows that the most severe droughts during our study period were observed from 1992 to 1997, where on average Europe experienced drought events, which lasted up to 4 months. Slow responding variables, such as groundwater, are better in showing extreme drought compared to fast responding variables such as runoff.\n\nStress testing as complement to climate scenarios: recharge scenarios to quantify streamflow drought sensitivity\n\nMichael Stoelzle, Maria Staudinger, Kerstin Stahl, and Markus Weiler\n\nProc. IAHS, 383, 43–50, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-43-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-43-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe role of recharge and catchment storage is crucial to understand streamflow drought sensitivity. Here we introduce a model experiment with recharge stress tests as complement to climate scenarios to quantify the streamflow drought sensitivities of catchments in Switzerland. We identified a pre-drought period of 12 months as maximum storage-memory for the study catchments. From stress testing, we found up to 200 days longer summer streamflow droughts and minimum flow reductions of 50 %–80 %.\n\nDrought monitoring and early warning in China: a review of research to pave the way for operational systems\n\nLucy J. Barker, Jamie Hannaford, and Miaomiao Ma\n\nProc. IAHS, 383, 273–279, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-273-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-273-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDrought monitoring and early warning are critical aspects of drought preparedness and can help mitigate impacts on society and the environment. We reviewed academic literature in England and Chinese on the topic of drought monitoring and early warning in China. The number of papers on this topic has increased substantially but the most recent advances have not been operationalised. We identify the methods that can be translated from the experimental to national, operational systems.\n\nLinking drought indices to impacts in the Liaoning Province of China\n\nMiaomiao Ma, Juan Lv, Zhicheng Su, Jamie Hannaford, Hongquan Sun, Yanping Qu, Zikang Xing, Lucy Barker, and Yaxu Wang\n\nProc.

Bloomfield, David M. Hannah, Christopher Jackson, Ben P. Marchant, Benedikt Heudorfer, Anne F. Van Loon, HÃ©lÃ¨ne BessiÃ¨re, Bo Thunholm, and Gerhard Schubert\n\nProc. IAHS, 383, 297–305, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-297-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-297-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn Europe, ca. 65% of drinking water is groundwater. Its replenishment depends on rainfall, but droughts may cause groundwater levels to fall below normal. These groundwater droughts can limit supply, making it crucial to understand their regional connection. The Groundwater Drought Initiative (GDI) assesses spatial patterns in historicârecent groundwater droughts across Europe for the first time. Using an example dataset, we describe the background to the GDI and its methodological approach.\n\nThe challenges of hydrological drought definition, quantification and communication: an interdisciplinary perspective\n\nKerstin Stahl, Jean-Philippe Vidal, Jamie Hannaford, Erik Tijdeman, Gregor Laaha, Tobias Gauster, and Lena M. Tallaksen\n\nProc. IAHS, 383, 291–295, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-291-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-291-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNumerous indices exist for the description of hydrological drought, some are based on absolute thresholds of overall streamflows or water levels and some are based on relative anomalies with respect to the season. This article discusses paradigms and experiences with such index uses in drought monitoring and drought analysis to raise awareness of the different interpretations of drought severity.\n\nPreface: Hydrological processes and water security in a changing world\n\nZhongbo Yu, Chunhui Lu, Jianyuan Cai, Dazheng Yu, Gil Mahe, Anil Mishra, Christophe Cudennec, Henny A. J. Van Lanen, Didier Orange, and Abou Amani\n\nProc. IAHS, 383, 3–4, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-3-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-383-3-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe 8th Global FRIEND conference highlighted the advance in hydrological science and innovation in water management. 52 accepted papers cover study areas in precipitation and climate impact; observation, analysis and simulations of hydrologic processes; floods in the changing environments; drought monitoring and analysis; water resources and environmental impacts. The outcome of the conference presented in the proceedings will be shared and discussed widely among UNESCO IHP networks.\n\nFuture streamflow regime changes in the United States: assessment using functional classification\n\nManuela I. Brunner, Lieke A. Melsen, Andrew J. Newman, Andrew W. Wood, and Martyn P. Clark\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 3951–3966, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3951-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3951-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStreamflow seasonality is changing and expected to further change under the influence of climate change. We here assess how annual streamflow hydrographs will change in future by using a newly developed classification scheme. Our comparison of future with current annual hydrograph classes shows that robust changes are expected only for currently melt-influenced regions in the Rocky Mountains. These upstream changes may require the adaptation of management strategies in downstream regions.\n\nSkill of large-scale seasonal drought impact forecasts\n\nSamuel J. Sutanto, Melati van der Weert, Veit Blauhut, and Henny A. J. Van Lanen\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 1595–1608, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-1595-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-1595-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPresent-day drought early warning systems only provide information on drought hazard forecasts. Here, we have developed drought impact functions to forecast drought impacts up to 7 months ahead using machine learning techniques, logistic regression, and random forest. Our results show that random forest produces a higher-impact forecasting skill than logistic regression. For German county levels, drought impacts can be forecasted up to 4 months ahead using random forest.\n\nReview article: Natural hazard risk assessments at the global scale\n\nPhilip J.

In doing so, we examine similarities and differences between the approaches taken across the different hazards and identify potential ways in which different hazard communities can learn from each other. Finally, we discuss opportunities for learning from methods and approaches being developed and applied to assess natural hazard risks at more continental or regional scales.\n\nLinking drought indices to impacts to support drought risk assessment in Liaoning province, China\n\nYaxu Wang, Juan Lv, Jamie Hannaford, Yicheng Wang, Hongquan Sun, Lucy J. Barker, Miaomiao Ma, Zhicheng Su, and Michael Eastman\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 889–906, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-889-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-889-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDue to the specific applicability of drought impact indicators, this study identifies which drought indicators are suitable for characterising drought impacts and the contribution of vulnerability factors. The results show that the relationship varies across different drought impacts and cities; some factors have a strong positive correlation with drought vulnerability. This study can support drought planning work and provide background for the indices used in drought monitoring applications.\n\nBeyond binary baseflow separation: a delayed-flow index for multiple streamflow contributions\n\nMichael Stoelzle, Tobias Schuetz, Markus Weiler, Kerstin Stahl, and Lena M. Tallaksen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 849–867, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-849-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-849-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDuring dry weather, different delayed sources of runoff (e.g. from groundwater, wetlands or snowmelt) modulate the magnitude and variability of streamflow. Hydrograph separation methods often do not distinguish these delayed contributions and mostly pool them into only two components (i.e. quickflow and baseflow). We propose a method that uncovers multiple components and demonstrates how they better reflect streamflow generation processes of different flow regimes.\n\nHistoric hydrological droughts 1891â2015: systematic characterisation for a diverse set of catchments across theÂ UK\n\nLucy J.

In this study we use the standardised streamflow index for 1891–2015 to systematically identify, characterise and rank hydrological drought events for 108 near-natural UK catchments. Results show when and where the most severe events occurred and describe events of the early 20th century, providing catchment-scale detail important for both science and planning applications of the future.\n\nA multi-objective ensemble approach to hydrological modelling in the UK: an application to historic drought reconstruction\n\nKatie A. Smith, Lucy J. Barker, Maliko Tanguy, Simon Parry, Shaun Harrigan, Tim P. Legg, Christel Prudhomme, and Jamie Hannaford\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3247–3268, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3247-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3247-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper describes the multi-objective calibration approach used to create a consistent dataset of reconstructed daily river flow data for 303 catchments in the UK over 1891–2015. The modelled data perform well when compared to observations, including in the timing and the classification of drought events. This method and data will allow for long-term studies of flow trends and past extreme events that have not been previously possible, enabling water managers to better plan for the future.\n\nMerits of novel high-resolution estimates and existing long-term estimates of humidity and incident radiation in a complex domain\n\nHelene Birkelund Erlandsen, Lena Merete Tallaksen, and JÃ¸rn Kristiansen\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 11, 797–821, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-797-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-797-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRobust estimates of runoff, snow, and evaporation rely on high-quality estimates of incoming solar and thermal radiation at the surface and near surface humidity. Taking advantage of the physical soundness of a numerical weather reanalysis and the preciseness and spatial resolution of a national gridded temperature data set, new estimates of these variables are presented for Norway. Further, existing data sets and observations are compared, emphasizing daily correlation, trends, and gradients.\n\nUsing paired catchments to quantify the human influence on hydrological droughts\n\nAnne F. Van Loon, Sally Rangecroft, Gemma Coxon, JosÃ© AgustÃ­n BreÃ±a Naranjo, Floris Van Ogtrop, and Henny A. J. Van Lanen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1725–1739, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1725-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1725-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe explore the use of the classic paired-catchment approach to quantify human influence on hydrological droughts. In this approach two similar catchments are compared and differences are attributed to the human activity present in one. In two case studies in UK and Australia, we found that groundwater abstraction aggravated streamflow drought by > 200 % and water transfer alleviated droughts with 25–80 %. Understanding the human influence on droughts can support water management decisions.\n\nEffects of univariate and multivariate bias correction on hydrological impact projections in alpine catchments\n\nJudith Meyer, Irene Kohn, Kerstin Stahl, Kirsti Hakala, Jan Seibert, and Alex J. Cannon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1339–1354, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1339-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1339-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSeveral multivariate bias correction methods have been developed recently, but only a few studies have tested the effect of multivariate bias correction on hydrological impact projections. This study shows that incorporating or ignoring inter-variable relations between air temperature and precipitation can have a notable effect on the projected snowfall fraction. The effect translated to considerable consequences for the glacio-hydrological responses and streamflow components of the catchments.\n\nStreamflow forecast sensitivity to air temperature forecast calibration for 139 Norwegian catchments\n\nTrine J. Hegdahl, KolbjÃ¸rn Engeland, Ingelin Steinsland, and Lena M. Tallaksen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 723–739, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-723-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-723-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFlood forecasting relies on high-quality meteorological data. This study shows how improved temperature forecasts improve streamflow forecasts in most cases, with the degree of improvement depending on season and region. To improve temperature forecasts further, catchment-specific methods should be developed to account for these seasonal and regional differences. In short, for climates with a seasonal snow cover, higher-quality temperature forecasts clearly improve flood forecasts.\n\nAn assessment of trends and potential future changes in groundwater-baseflow drought based on catchment response times\n\nJost Hellwig and Kerstin Stahl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 6209–6224, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-6209-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-6209-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDue to the lack of long-term observations, insights into changes of groundwater resources are obscured. In this paper we assess past and potential future changes in groundwater drought in headwater catchments using a baseflow approach. There are a few past trends which are highly dependent on the period of analysis. Catchments with short response times are found to have a higher sensitivity to projected seasonal precipitation shifts, urging for a local management based on response times.\n\nPositive and negative human-modified droughts: a quantitative approach illustrated with two Iranian catchments\n\nElham Kakaei, Hamid Reza Moradi, Ali Reza Moghaddam Nia, and Henny A.

P. Vis, Irene Kohn, Markus Weiler, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2211–2224, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2211-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2211-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn many glacio-hydrological models glacier areas are assumed to be constant over time, which is a crucial limitation. Here we describe a novel approach to translate mass balances as simulated by the (glacio)hydrological model into glacier area changes. We combined the Δh approach of Huss et al. (2010) with the bucket-type model HBV and introduced a lookup table approach, which also allows periods with advancing glaciers to be represented, which is not possible with the original Huss method.\n\nMapping (dis)agreement in hydrologic projections\n\nLieke A. Melsen, Nans Addor, Naoki Mizukami, Andrew J. Newman, Paul J. J. F. Torfs, Martyn P. Clark, Remko Uijlenhoet, and Adriaan J. Teuling\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 1775–1791, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1775-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1775-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLong-term hydrological predictions are important for water management planning, but are also prone to uncertainty. This study investigates three sources of uncertainty for long-term hydrological predictions in the US: climate models, hydrological models, and hydrological model parameters. Mapping the results revealed spatial patterns in the three sources of uncertainty: different sources of uncertainty dominate in different regions.\n\nHuman influences on streamflow drought characteristics in England and Wales\n\nErik Tijdeman, Jamie Hannaford, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 1051–1064, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1051-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1051-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, a screening approach was applied on a set of streamflow records for which various human influences are indicated to identify streamflow records that have drought characteristics that deviate from those expected under pristine conditions. Prolonged streamflow drought duration, a weaker correlation between streamflow and precipitation, and changes in streamflow drought occurrence over time were related to human influences such as groundwater abstractions or reservoir operations.\n\nThe role of glacier changes and threshold definition in the characterisation of future streamflow droughts in glacierised catchments\n\nMarit Van Tiel, Adriaan J. Teuling, Niko Wanders, Marc J. P. Vis, Kerstin Stahl, and Anne F. Van Loon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 463–485, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-463-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-463-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlaciers are important hydrological reservoirs. Short-term variability in glacier melt and also glacier retreat can cause droughts in streamflow. In this study, we analyse the effect of glacier changes and different drought threshold approaches on future projections of streamflow droughts in glacierised catchments. We show that these different methodological options result in different drought projections and that these options can be used to study different aspects of streamflow droughts.\n\nDeveloping drought impact functions for drought risk management\n\nSophie Bachmair, Cecilia Svensson, Ilaria Prosdocimi, Jamie Hannaford, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 17, 1947–1960, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-17-1947-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-17-1947-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study tests the potential for developing empirical drought impact functions based on hydro-meteorological drought indicators as predictors and text-based reports on drought impacts as a surrogate variable for drought damage. We showcase three data-driven modeling approaches and assess the effect of impact report quantification method.\n\nEffects of shrub and tree cover increase on the near-surface atmosphere in northern Fennoscandia\n\nJohanne H. Rydsaa, Frode Stordal, Anders Bryn, and Lena M. Tallaksen\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 4209–4227, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-4209-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-4209-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the atmospheric sensitivity to an expansion in shrub and tree cover in the northern Fennoscandia region. We applied a regional weather and climate model in evaluating biophysical effects of increased shrub cover at a fine resolution. We find that shrub cover increase causes a warming that is sensitive to the shrub and tree heights. Cooling effects include increased snow cover, cloud cover, and precipitation. We show that the net warming will likely increase in the future.\n\nHumanâwater interface in hydrological modelling: current status and future directions\n\nYoshihide Wada, Marc F. P.

Awareness of potential water scarcity led to first global water resource assessments; however, few hydrological models considered the interaction between terrestrial water fluxes and human activities. Our contribution highlights the importance of human activities transforming the Earth's water cycle, and how hydrological models can include such influences in an integrated manner.\n\nFrequently used drought indices reflect different drought conditions on global scale\n\nNiko Wanders, Anne F. Van Loon, and Henny A. J. Van Lanen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2017-512,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2017-512, 2017\n\nRevised manuscript has not been submitted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper investigates the similarities between frequently used drought indicators and how they should be used for global drought monitoring. We find that drought indicators that should monitor drought in the same hydrological domain show high discrepancy in their anomalies and thus drought detection. This shows that the current ways of monitoring drought events is not sufficient to fully capture the complexity of drought events and monitor the socio-economic impact of these large-scale events.\n\nThe EuropeanÂ 2015 drought from a hydrological perspective\n\nGregor Laaha, Tobias Gauster, Lena M.

Van Loon, Luis Mediero, Marzena Osuch, Renata Romanowicz, Eric Sauquet, James H. Stagge, and Wai K. Wong\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 3001–3024, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-3001-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-3001-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn 2015 large parts of Europe were affected by a drought. In terms of low flow magnitude, a region around the Czech Republic was most affected, with return periods > 100 yr. In terms of deficit volumes, the drought was particularly severe around S. Germany where the event lasted notably long. Meteorological and hydrological events developed differently in space and time. For an assessment of drought impacts on water resources, hydrological data are required in addition to meteorological indices.\n\nHydrology of inland tropical lowlands: the Kapuas and Mahakam wetlands\n\nHidayat Hidayat, Adriaan J.

This study offers a view of the hydrology of two tropical lowlands in Indonesia. Both lowlands exhibit the important role of upstream wetlands in regulating the flow downstream. We expect that this work facilitates a better prediction of fire-prone conditions in these regions.\n\nTesting the use of standardised indices and GRACE satellite data to estimate the European 2015 groundwater drought in near-real time\n\nAnne F. Van Loon, Rohini Kumar, and Vimal Mishra\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 1947–1971, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-1947-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-1947-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSummer 2015 was extremely dry in Europe, hampering groundwater supply to irrigation and drinking water. For effective management, the groundwater situation should be monitored in real time, but data are not available. We tested two methods to estimate groundwater in near-real time, based on satellite data and using the relationship between rainfall and historic groundwater levels. The second method gave a good spatially variable representation of the 2015 groundwater drought in Europe.\n\nThe European 2015 drought from a climatological perspective\n\nMonica Ionita, Lena M. Tallaksen, Daniel G. Kingston, James H. Stagge, Gregor Laaha, Henny A. J. Van Lanen, Patrick Scholz, Silvia M. Chelcea, and Klaus Haslinger\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

It discusses the main contributing factors controlling the occurrence and persistence of the event: temperature and precipitation anomalies, blocking episodes and sea surface temperatures. The results represent the outcome of a collaborative initiative of members of UNESCOâs FRIEND-Water program.\n\nMulti-method assessment of reservoir effects on hydrological droughts in an arid region\n\nSally Rangecroft, Anne F. Van Loon, HÃ©ctor Maureira, Koen Verbist, and David M. Hannah\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam.

Using a case study of the introduction of a reservoir in a Chilean river basin and a new methodology, we established the most effective way forward for quantifying human activities on hydrological drought: the \"threshold level\" method with an \"undisturbed\" time period as the threshold. This will increase our understanding on how human activities are impacting the hydrological system.\n\nControls on hydrologic drought duration in near-natural streamflow in Europe and the USA\n\nErik Tijdeman, Sophie Bachmair, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nHydrol.

Drought can be alleviated or made worse by human activities and drought impacts are dependent on a myriad of factors. In this paper, we identify research gaps and suggest a framework that will allow us to adequately analyse and manage drought in the Anthropocene. We need to focus on attribution of drought to different drivers, linking drought to its impacts, and feedbacks between drought and society.\n\nEstimating drought risk across Europe from reported drought impacts, drought indices, and vulnerability factors\n\nVeit Blauhut, Kerstin Stahl, James Howard Stagge, Lena M.

We therefore exploited text-based data from the European Drought Impact report Inventory (EDII) to evaluate drought indicators, empirically determine indicator thresholds, and model drought impacts. A quantitative analysis using Germany and the UK as a testbed proved to be a useful tool for objectively appraising drought indicators.\n\nFrom meteorological to hydrological drought using standardised indicators\n\nLucy J.
