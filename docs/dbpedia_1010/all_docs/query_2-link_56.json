        "text": "Focusing on cosmetic surgery of the breast with procedures like Breast Augmentation and Breast Lift, and body procedures like liposuction and tummy tuck, Dr. David Sieber is one of few double board-certified plastic surgeons in the San Francisco Bay Area with specialized fellowship training in cosmetic surgery. He has completed further training in the latest non-surgical procedures including dermal fillers, botulinum toxins, and laser skin rejuvenation.\n\nDr. Sieber is a graduate of Loyola University-Stritch School of Medicine and completed a five-year residency in general surgery at Loyola University Medical Center. Board certified by the American Board of Surgery, he then went on to complete an additional three-year residency in plastic and reconstructive surgery at the University of Minnesota as well as a one-year aesthetic surgery fellowship at the top-ranked University of Texas Southwestern program in Dallas under the mentorship of some of the most highly regarded and world-renowned plastic surgeons. With this strong foundation, Dr. Sieber went on to become certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.\n\nIn order to provide his patients with the best possible care, Dr. Sieber is adamant about understanding and investigating the latest trends and technologies in plastic surgery. He received the award for best research paper during the 2015 calendar year by the Aesthetic Surgery Journal editorial board and serves on committees for the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) and Aesthetic Surgery Education and Research Foundation (ASERF). He is also a peer reviewer for both the Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery as well as the Aesthetic Surgery Journal. Dr. Sieber was the recipient of the inaugural Frederic Brandt, MD Memorial Scholarship in recognition of his commitment to the ongoing education and training of aesthetic physicians.\n\nDr. Sieber, his wife, and two dogs now call San Francisco home. In his free time, he enjoys photography, exercising, hiking, and travel. One of the most rewarding aspects of his career has been the opportunity to treat underserved patients who severely lack health care. To date, he has provided life-changing medical care to patients in Nepal, Peru, and Armenia. Dr. Sieber continues to volunteer his time and medical skills in order to help those most in need.\n\nDr. Sieber recognizes that each patient is unique. He works closely with his patients, listening to their concerns. His goal is to create the ideal treatment plan for each patientâ€™s individual needs. His gentle bedside manner, calm demeanor, and outgoing disposition make his patients feel at home. His philosophy has always been that the patient comes first and that great medical outcomes always start with excellent patient care."
