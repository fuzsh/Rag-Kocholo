        "text": "In recent years, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has witnessed a surge in the popularity of T20 cricket leagues within its borders. Looking at one of the major leagues which were granted official status even before the second season started. üèè The International League T20 (ILT20), also known as DP World ILT20, stands out as the premier tournament in the region. Sanctioned by the Emirates Cricket Board, this professional cricket league debuted in January 2023. The inaugural season featured six competing teams: Abu Dhabi Knight Riders, Dubai Capitals, Desert Vipers, Gulf Giants, MI Emirates, and Sharjah Warriors. üëë The team names might seem familiar as many of these teams are backed by familiar names from the Indian Premier League (IPL) ownership roster, alongside newcomers like the Adani Group and the Glazer family, known for their majority stake in Manchester United. Interestingly, 3 original IPL franchise owners (i.e. the owners of Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals) got the additional advantage of signing up to four players from their current IPL squads. üè¢ The ILT20's calibre has earned it List A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC) just a month before its second season, marking a significant milestone as the first Associate nation's T20 league to receive such recognition. This means that all statistics from the tournament are now officially recognized. üí± An interesting aspect of this tournament is its Wildcard rule. This allows each team to add two players to their squad, over and above the permissible 22 players. But the catch lies in the salary cap, which makes it mandatory that each team can only spend a maximum of $2.5 million. If they have done so, then they can only spend a maximum of 10% of the salary cap, which is $250,000 for their wildcard players. ‚úà A variation in the foreign player quota sees nine overseas players out of eleven, much higher than the 4/5 overseas player limit for other major T20 leagues. Two players on each team must be a UAE player and a player from an Associate Member nation respectively üì∫ A landmark deal in May 2021 saw the revival of Zee Entertainment Enterprises in the sports sector as it secured the league's media rights for a decade, spanning from 2023 to 2032, at a staggering cost of US$120 million.

As the sport is played in a much smaller area than normal cricketing fields, it is important to strategize the placement of players on the field to maximize each team's chances of success. Some of the key tactics to consider include the location of boundary riders, which can be used to save runs and stop batsmen from getting established; the placement of bowlers, which can be used to create the maximum pressure; and the placement of a deep fielder, used to provide a last-ditch run-saving tactic. Additionally, adjusting the field during a dramatic batsman switch may also help teams in certain situations. When it comes to successful field placement in indoor cricket, the key is to be strategic, tactically aware, and alert.

Lutf-ur-Rahim Tahir Fizza Naeem Atif Tahir\n\nThe expansion of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to a five-Test series is a welcome decision, but ignores the plight of other Test-playing nations, writes Ritam Mitra. This summer heralds what will be a first in many cricket fans‚Äô lifetimes: a five-match #Test series between Australia and India. It‚Äôs been 32 years since the last five-match Test series between the two nations, and the move from the four- (and occasionally two-) Test format demonstrates the value placed on the rivalry by fans, broadcasters and administrators alike. It‚Äôs indisputable that India v Australia is the jewel in Test cricket‚Äôs slipping crown. While the #Ashes may carry the weight of history, from both a commercial and cricketing perspective, the Border-Gavaskar Trophy leaves the Ashes dead and buried. And yet, to some, the five-test announcement will be a bittersweet pill. Let‚Äôs hope it‚Äôs not the latest example of the #ICC fiddling while Rome burns. #cricketaustralia #BCCI #BorderGavaskarTrophy #IndVAus #TeamIndia #ViratKohli #PatCummins #RohitSharma #IPL #jayshah Pawan Luthra | Tracey Holmes | Nick Hockley | Dipen Rughani GAICD | Renesh Krishnan | Gurnam Singh | Sanjiv Dubey | Sagar Mehrotra\n\nThe recent chatter regarding the proposal by cricket's 'Big Three' to revive the #CLT20 competition is the latest nail in the coffin of Test cricket as we know it. As I wrote in Indian Link Media Group last week, while the imminent expansion of the #BorderGavaskarTrophy to a five-Test series is good news for fans of Test cricket, unless you‚Äôre Australia, India or England, the format appears destined to continue dying a slow death without drastic intervention. Test cricket is bigger than the Big Three. It's easy for multi-millionaires like Virat Kohli to commit to the format when their livelihoods and futures are not at stake, but it's neither fair nor realistic to expect players from other nations to simply ‚Äúput their country first‚Äù when they could be earning life-changing amounts for significantly less work. There are several tools at the International Cricket Council's disposal which would go some way towards redressing the slide of the longest format for other nations, whether through carving out a dedicated Test cricket window (or a shortened IPL window), subsidising match payments for players representing countries other than the Big Three, or guaranteeing each Test nation a minimum number of tests in each cycle. Of course, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has a huge role to play in making these options commercially viable. A five-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy is certainly an exciting development, but one can only hope it‚Äôs not the latest example of the ICC fiddling while Rome burns (or a Trojan horse masking the ICC's ambition to support the proliferation of more T20 leagues...).\n\nüáÆüá≥üÜöüáµüá∞ October 14 - today, Contest Alert!

The BCCI‚Äôs net worth is close to $2.25 bn which is upwards of Rs. 18,000 cr. The next biggest board is Cricket Australia at $ 79 mn or ~ Rs. 650 cr (< 4%) of BCCI‚Äôs scale. Well, what‚Äôs more astonishing is that BCCI is valued at 250 times of the NZ Cricket Board. Talking about revenue, the BCCI is set to receive 38.5% of ICC‚Äôs revenue share during the 2024-27 cricketing cycleüí∞ Further, BCCI‚Äôs annual revenue in the past decade has been growing at a healthy double digit CAGR, largely thanks to the IPL. The BCCI‚Äôs main sources of own revenue include streaming rights (TV and Digital), in addition to advertisement and sponsorship fees. In fact, the recently concluded Cricket World Cup is set to inject Rs. 22,000 cr into the country‚Äôs GDP. This has been on the back of streaming, ads, gains in travel, hospitality, food, ticket sales and merchandise‚úàÔ∏è If the BCCI were a listed company, it would be one of the biggest companies in the country and definitely be a favourite across everyone‚Äôs portfolio. With BCCI getting the lion‚Äôs share of global cricket revenue, where do you think our sport is headed?

It is a great way to stay active and bring people together and can be played either indoors or outdoors. Indoor cricket is typically played on a smaller court with shorter boundaries, and the game is usually shorter in duration. This makes it ideal for those who prefer a more fast-paced game. It also allows for more creative shot-making, as the ball can be hit in any direction to score a run. Outdoor cricket is usually played on a larger field with more boundaries, and the game can take quite a bit longer to finish. This is often seen as the more classic form of the game, and is ideal for those who prefer a more strategic approach. No matter which you choose, cricket is a fantastic way to bond with friends and family members of all ages. It is a sport steeped in tradition and history, and will continue to be enjoyed for generations to come.
