        "text": "Maximizing Gateway-Course Improvement by Making the Whole Greater than the Sum of the Parts\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKoch, Andrew K.; Prystowsky, Richard J.; Scinta, Tony\n\n2017-01-01\n\nDrawing on systems theory, this chapter uses two different institutional examples to demonstrate the benefits of combining gateway-course improvement initiatives with other student success efforts so that the combined approach makes the whole greater than the simple sum of the pieces.\n\nImplementing new care models: learning from the Greater Manchester demonstrator pilot experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nElvey, Rebecca; Bailey, Simon; Checkland, Kath; McBride, Anne; Parkin, Stephen; Rothwell, Katy; Hodgson, Damian\n\n2018-06-19\n\nCurrent health policy focuses on improving accessibility, increasing integration and shifting resources from hospitals to community and primary care. Initiatives aimed at achieving these policy aims have supported the implementation of various 'new models of care', including general practice offering 'additional availability' appointments during evenings and at weekends. In Greater Manchester, six 'demonstrator sites' were funded: four sites delivered additional availability appointments, other services included case management and rapid response. The aim of this paper is to explore the factors influencing the implementation of services within a programme designed to improve access to primary care. The paper consists of a qualitative process evaluation undertaken within provider organisations, including general practices, hospitals and care homes. Semi-structured interviews, with the data subjected to thematic analysis. Ninety-one people participated in interviews. Six key factors were identified as important for the establishment and running of the demonstrators: information technology; information governance; workforce and organisational development; communications and engagement; supporting infrastructure; federations and alliances. These factors brought to light challenges in the attempt to provide new or modify existing services. Underpinning all factors was the issue of trust; there was consensus amongst our participants that trusting relationships, particularly between general practices, were vital for collaboration. It was also crucial that general practices trusted in the integrity of anyone external who was to work with the practice, particularly if they were to access data on the practice computer system. A dialogical approach was required, which enabled staff to see themselves as active rather than passive participants. The research highlights various challenges presented by the context within which extended access is implemented. Trust was the\n\nGreater Proptosis Is Not Associated With Improved Compressive Optic Neuropathy in Thyroid Eye Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nNanda, Tavish; Dunbar, Kristen E; Campbell, Ashley A; Bathras, Ryan M; Kazim, Michael\n\n2018-05-18\n\nDespite the paucity of supporting data, it has generally been held that proptosis in thyroid eye disease (TED) may provide relative protection from compressive optic neuropathy (CON) by producing spontaneous decompression. The objective of this study was to investigate this phenomenon in patients with bilateral TED-CON. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 67 patients (134 orbits) with bilateral TED-CON at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Significant asymmetric proptosis (Hertel) was defined as â¥ 2 mm. Significant asymmetric CON was defined first, as the presence of an relative afferent pupillary defect. Those without an relative afferent pupillary defect were evaluated according to the TED-CON formula y = -0.69 - 0.31 Ã (motility) - 0.2 Ã (mean deviation) - 0.02 Ã (color vision) as previously established for the diagnosis of TED-CON. A difference in the formula result â¥ 1.0 between eyes was considered significant. Patients were then divided into 4 groups. Forty-one of 67 patients demonstrated asymmetric CON (29 by relative afferent pupillary defect, 12 by formula). Twenty-one of 67 patients demonstrated asymmetric proptosis. Only 5 of 12 (41.6%) of the patients who had both asymmetric proptosis and asymmetric CON (group 1) showed greater proptosis in the eye with less CON. Twenty-nine patients (group 2) showed that asymmetric CON occurred despite symmetrical proptosis. Seventeen patients (group 3), showed the inverse, that asymmetric differences in proptosis occurred with symmetrical CON. Despite commonly held assumptions, our results suggest that greater proptosis is not associated with improved TED-CON. Combining groups 1 to 3-all of which demonstrated asymmetry of either proptosis, CON, or both-91.4% of patients did not show a relationship between greater proptosis and improved CON.\n\nGreater Use of Exemplary Education Programs Could Improve Education for Disadvantaged Children.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1981-09-15\n\nThe Congress OF THE UNITED STATES Greater Use Of Exemplary Education Pograms Could Improve Education for Disadvantaged Children.

A novel reattachment system is proposed with the aim of improving fixation stability. It consists of a Y-shaped fixation plate combined with locking screws and superelastic cables to reduce cable loosening and limit greater trochanter movement. The novel system is compared with a commercially available reattachment system in terms of greater trochanter movement and cable tensions under different greater trochanteric abductor application angles. A factorial design of experiments was used including four independent variables: plate system, cable type, abductor application angle, and femur model. The test procedure included 50 cycles of simultaneous application of an abductor force on the greater trochanter and a hip force on the femoral head. The novel plate reduces the movements of a greater trochanter fragment within a single loading cycle up to 26%. Permanent degradation of the fixation (accumulated movement based on 50-cycle testing) is reduced up to 46%. The use of superelastic cables reduces tension loosening up to 24%. However this last improvement did not result in a significant reduction of the grater trochanter movement. The novel plate and cables present advantages over the commercially available greater trochanter reattachment system. The plate reduces movements generated by the hip abductor. The superelastic cables reduce cable loosening during cycling. Both of these positive effects could decrease the risks related to grater trochanter non-union. Copyright Â© 2012 IPEM.

Final report\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSippel, M.A.\n\nThe purpose of this project was to demonstrate targeted infill and extension drilling opportunities, better determinations of oil-in-place, and methods for improved completion efficiency. The investigations and demonstrations were focussed on Red River and Ratcliffe reservoirs in the Williston Basin within portions of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota. Both of these formations have been successfully explored with conventional 2-dimensional (2D) seismic. Improved reservoir characterization utilizing 3-dimensional (3D) seismic was investigated for identification of structural and stratigraphic reservoir compartments. These seismic characterizations were integrated with geological and engineering studies. The project tested lateral completion techniques, including high-pressure jetting lance technologymoreÂ Â» and short-radius lateral drilling to enhance completion efficiency. Lateral completions should improve economics for both primary and secondary oil where low permeability is a problem and higher-density drilling of vertical infill wells is limited by drilling cost. New vertical wells were drilled to test bypassed oil in ares that were identified by 3D seismic. These new wells are expected to recover as much or greater oil than was produced by nearby old wells. The project tested water injection through vertical and horizontal wells in reservoirs where application of waterflooding has been limited. A horizontal well was drilled for testing water injection. Injection rates were tested at three times that of a vertical well. This demonstration well shows that water injection with horizontal completions can improve injection rates for economic waterflooding. This report is divided into two sections, part 1 covers the Red River and part 2 covers the Ratcliffe. Each part summarizes integrated reservoir characterizations and outlines methods for targeting by-passed oil reserves in the respective formation and locality.Â«Â less\n\nA collaborative project to improve identification and management of patients with chronic kidney disease in a primary care setting in Greater Manchester.\n\nPubMed\n\nHumphreys, John; Harvey, Gill; Coleiro, Michelle; Butler, Brook; Barclay, Anna; Gwozdziewicz, Maciek; O'Donoghue, Donal; Hegarty, Janet\n\n2012-08-01\n\nResearch has demonstrated a knowledge and practice gap in the identification and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In 2009, published data showed that general practices in Greater Manchester had a low detection rate for CKD. A 12-month improvement collaborative, supported by an evidence-informed implementation framework and financial incentives. 19 general practices from four primary care trusts within Greater Manchester. Number of recorded patients with CKD on practice registers; percentage of patients on registers achieving nationally agreed blood pressure targets. The collaborative commenced in September 2009 and involved three joint learning sessions, interspersed with practice level rapid improvement cycles, and supported by an implementation team from the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care for Greater Manchester. At baseline, the 19 collaborative practices had 4185 patients on their CKD registers. At final data collection in September 2010, this figure had increased by 1324 to 5509. Blood pressure improved from 34% to 74% of patients on practice registers having a recorded blood pressure within recommended guidelines. Evidence-based improvement can be implemented in practice for chronic disease management. A collaborative approach has been successful in enabling teams to test and apply changes to identify patients and improve care. The model has proved to be more successful for some practices, suggesting a need to develop more context-sensitive approaches to implementation and actively manage the factors that influence the success of the collaborative.\n\nDemonstrating bias and improved inference for stoves' health benefits.\n\nPubMed\n\nMueller, Valerie; Pfaff, Alexander; Peabody, John; Liu, Yaping; Smith, Kirk R\n\n2011-12-01\n\nMany studies associate health risks with household air pollution from biomass fuels and stoves. Evaluations of stove improvements can suffer from bias because they rarely address health-relevant differences between the households who get improvements and those who do not. We demonstrate both the potential for bias and an option for improved stove inference by applying to household air pollution a technique used elsewhere in epidemiology, propensity-score matching (PSM), based on a stoves-and-health survey for China (15 counties, 3500 households). Health-relevant factors (age, wealth, kitchen ventilation) do in fact differ considerably between the households with stove improvements and those without. We study the resulting bias in estimates of cleaner-stove impacts using a self-reported Physical Component Summary (PCS). Typical stoves-literature regressions with little control for non-stove factors suggest no benefits from a cleaner-fuel stove relative to a traditional biomass stove. Yet increasing controls raises the impact estimates. Our PSM estimates address the differences in health-relevant factors using 'apples to apples' comparisons between those with improved stoves and 'similar' households. This generates higher estimates of clean-stove benefits, which are on the order of one half the standard deviation of the PCS outcome. Our data demonstrate the potential importance of bias in household air pollution studies. This results from failure to address the possibility that those receiving improved stoves are themselves prone to better or worse health outcomes. It suggests the value of data collection and of study design for cookstove interventions and, more generally, for policy interventions within many health outcomes.\n\nVentures in Community Improvement.

Men and women aged 35 years or older with moderate-to-severe perioral lines were recruited for this randomized controlled, rater-blinded, 2-arm trial. The primary endpoint was a comparison of rater-assessed responder rates by the validated 4-point Perioral Lines Severity Scale at Month 6; responders were those who showed a â¥1 point improvement. A secondary endpoint was subject-assessed change in perioral lines measured by the Global Assessment of Change Scale. A total of 136 subjects received treatment and 132 completed the trial (mean age: 58 Â± 8 years). Total volume injected was 1.18 mL (HYC-24L) and 1.32 mL (CPM-22.5). At Month 6, a significantly greater proportion of HYC-24L subjects responded to treatment (87%) than CPM-22.5 subjects (72%) (p < .04). At all time points, HYC-24L subjects reported significantly greater improvement in their perioral lines than CPM-22.5 subjects, with the greatest difference at Month 6. No unexpected adverse events occurred. HYC-24L subjects showed a higher response rate and a greater improvement in their perioral lines than CPM-22.5 subjects for up to 6 months.\n\nChanges over time in hip fracture risk: Greater improvements in men compared to women.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmith, Roger; Perera, Buddhini K; Chan, Daniela W C\n\n2018-06-09\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine whether there has been a change in the mean age and age-standardized incidence of minimal trauma hip fractures in the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie population of Australia between 1998 and 2015. Patients with neck of femur fractures over 50 who presented to the regional referral centre were retrospectively identified using the ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding system. There were 233 and 308 eligible patients in 1998 and 2015, respectively. For females, the mean age for hip fracture of 83.2Â years in 1998 was not significantly different from the mean age of 84.5Â years in 2015 (PÂ =Â .16). For males, the mean age for hip fracture was significantly older at 84.6Â years in 2015 compared to 80.4Â years in 1998 (PÂ =Â .005). For females, the decrease in the rate of hip fracture from 1998 to 2015 was 13% and was weakly statistically significant (IRRÂ =Â 0.86, PÂ =Â .05). For males, there was a statistically significant decrease in the rate of hip fractures from 1998 to 2015 by 33% (IRRÂ =Â 0.67, PÂ =Â .001). Our study shows a decrease in age-standardized rates of hip fractures for men and women and suggests that men are demonstrating a greater improvement in bone health compared to women.

This article explores whether engagement in improvement activities within a HEN affected quality measures. Data were drawn from 1174 acute care hospitals. A composite quality score was created from 10 targeted topic area measures multiplied by the number of qualifying topics. Scores improved from 5.4 (SD = 6.8) at baseline to 4.6 (5.9) at remeasurement; P < .0001. Hospitals with higher baseline scores demonstrated greater improvement ( P < .0001) than hospitals with lower baseline scores. Hospitals with larger Medicaid populations ( P = .023) and micropolitan ( P = .034) hospitals tended to have greater improvement, whereas hospitals in the West ( P = .0009) did not improve as much as hospitals in other regions. After adjusting for hospital characteristics, hospitals with improvement champions ( P = .008), a higher level of engagement with their state association ( P = .001), and more leadership involvement ( P = .005) in HEN demonstrated greater improvement.\n\nApplication of design sensitivity analysis for greater improvement on machine structural dynamics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nYoshimura, Masataka\n\n1987-01-01\n\nMethodologies are presented for greatly improving machine structural dynamics by using design sensitivity analyses and evaluative parameters. First, design sensitivity coefficients and evaluative parameters of structural dynamics are described. Next, the relations between the design sensitivity coefficients and the evaluative parameters are clarified. Then, design improvement procedures of structural dynamics are proposed for the following three cases: (1) addition of elastic structural members, (2) addition of mass elements, and (3) substantial charges of joint design variables. Cases (1) and (2) correspond to the changes of the initial framework or configuration, and (3) corresponds to the alteration of poor initial design variables. Finally, numerical examples are given for demonstrating the availability of the methods proposed.\n\nAn Improved Brome mosaic virus Silencing Vector: Greater Insert Stability and More Extensive VIGS.\n\nPubMed\n\nDing, Xin Shun; Mannas, Stephen W; Bishop, Bethany A; Rao, Xiaolan; Lecoultre, Mitchell; Kwon, Soonil; Nelson, Richard S\n\n2018-01-01\n\nVirus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is used extensively for gene function studies in plants. VIGS is inexpensive and rapid compared with silencing conducted through stable transformation, but many virus-silencing vectors, especially in grasses, induce only transient silencing phenotypes. A major reason for transient phenotypes is the instability of the foreign gene fragment (insert) in the vector during VIGS. Here, we report the development of a Brome mosaic virus (BMV)-based vector that better maintains inserts through modification of the original BMV vector RNA sequence. Modification of the BMV RNA3 sequence yielded a vector, BMVCP5, that better maintained phytoene desaturase and heat shock protein70-1 ( HSP70-1 ) inserts in Nicotiana benthamiana and maize ( Zea mays ). Longer maintenance of inserts was correlated with greater target gene silencing and more extensive visible silencing phenotypes displaying greater tissue penetration and involving more leaves. The modified vector accumulated similarly to the original vector in N. benthamiana after agroinfiltration, thus maintaining a high titer of virus in this intermediate host used to produce virus inoculum for grass hosts. For HSP70 , silencing one family member led to a large increase in the expression of another family member, an increase likely related to the target gene knockdown and not a general effect of virus infection. The cause of the increased insert stability in the modified vector is discussed in relationship to its recombination and accumulation potential. The modified vector will improve functional genomic studies in grasses, and the conceptual methods used to improve the vector may be applied to other VIGS vectors.

A model that captures increasingly complicated phenomena, such as plasticity, temperature and strain rate effects, is analyzed. Predictive maturity is defined, here, as the accuracy of the model to predict multiple Hopkinson bar experiments. A statistical discrepancy quantifies the systematic disagreement (bias) between measurements and predictions. Our hypothesis is that improving the predictive capability of a model should translate into better agreement between measurements and predictions. This agreement, in turn, should lead to a smallermoreÂ Â» discrepancy. We have recently proposed to use discrepancy and coverage, that is, the extent to which the physical experiments used for calibration populate the regime of applicability of the model, as basis to define a Predictive Maturity Index (PMI). It was shown that predictive maturity could be improved when additional physical tests are made available to increase coverage of the regime of applicability. This contribution illustrates how the PMI changes as 'better' physics are implemented in the model. The application is the non-linear Preston-Tonks-Wallace (PTW) strength model applied to Beryllium metal. We demonstrate that our framework tracks the evolution of maturity of the PTW model. Robustness of the PMI with respect to the selection of coefficients needed in its definition is also studied.Â«Â less\n\nProvider-Based Research Networks Demonstrate Greater Hospice Use for Minority Patients With Lung Cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPenn, Dolly C.; Stitzenberg, Karyn B.; Cobran, Ewan K.; Godley, Paul A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPurpose: The Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) and Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MBCCOP) are provider-based research networks (PBRN) that improve minority enrollment in cancer-focused clinical trials. We hypothesized that affiliation with a PBRN may also mitigate racial differences in hospice enrollment for patients with lung cancer. Methods: We used the SEER-Medicare data, linked to the National Cancer Institute's CCOP program data, to identify all patients (â¥ age 65 years) with lung cancer, diagnosed from 2001 to 2007. We defined clinical treatment settings as CCOP, MBCCOP, academic, or community-affiliated and used multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine factors associated with hospice enrollment. Results: Forty-one thousand eight hundred eighty-five (55.1%) patients with lung cancer enrolled in hospice before death. Approximately 55% of CCOP, 57% of MBCCOP, 57% of academic, and 52% of community patients enrolled. Patients who were more likely to enroll were female (odds ratio [OR], 1.36; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.40); â¥ age 79 years (OR, 1.11; 95%CI, 1.06 to 1.16); white; lived in more educated areas; had minimal comorbidities; and had distant disease. Asian and black patients in academic (41.1% and 50.4%, respectively) and community practices (35.2% and 43.4%, respectively) were less likely to enroll in hospice compared with white patients (academic, 58.8%; community, 53.1%). However, hospice enrollment was equivalent for black and white patients in MBCCOP (59.5% v 57.2%) and CCOP (52.2% v 56.3%) practices. Conclusion: Minority patients with lung cancer receiving treatment in cancer-focused PBRN- affiliated practices have greater hospice enrollment than those treated in academic and community practices.

The main objective of the program was to accelerate development and commercialization of automotive gas turbines. The benefits from the installation of this engine in a transit coach were expected to be reduced weight, cleaner exhaust emissions, lower noise levels, reduced engine vibration and maintenance requirements, improved reliability and vehicle performance, greater engine braking capability, and superior cold weather starting. Four RTS-II advanced design transit coaches were converted to gas turbine power using engines and transmissions. Development, acceptance, performance and systems tests were performed on the coaches prior to the revenue service demonstration.\n\nDemonstrating PQS Effectiveness and Driving Continual Improvement: Evidence-Based Risk Reduction.\n\nPubMed\n\nRamnarine, Emma; O'Donnell, Kevin\n\n2018-04-18\n\nProduct knowledge grows and evolves during the life of a product. In order to maintain a state of control and deliver product with consistent quality throughout its commercial life, continuous improvement and product lifecycle management become essential. The practical link between product and process knowledge, risk-based control strategies, and continual improvement and innovation can be made stronger through evidence-based risk reduction. Regulatory relief and flexibility in post approval change management and overall product lifecycle management will only be possible with effective application of science and risk-based concepts and demonstrated effectiveness of the PQS in assuring a state of control.

Participants were 4-year-old children (n = 510) attending preschools in South Australia. Children's level of self-regulation was assessed using the parent-completed Devereux Early Childhood Assessment when children were aged 4, 5, and 6. Children's level of behavioral problems was assessed using total, internalizing, and externalizing scores on parent- and teacher-rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQs) when children were 6 years old. Random effects regression was used to describe the changes to children's self-regulation between 4 and 6 years. Linear regression models were then used to determine the strength of the association between the extent of self-regulation improvement and level of behavioral problems. Greater improvement in self-regulation, adjusted for family characteristics and baseline self-regulation scores, was associated with lower levels of parent- (B = -3.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-4.49, -2.65]) and teacher-rated SDQ total difficulties scores at 6 years (B = -2.42, 95% CI [-3.50, -1.34]). These effects remained after adjustment for level of parent-rated behavioral problems at 4 years. Similar effects were found for internalizing and externalizing scores at age 6 years. The results highlight the importance of improvements in self-regulation from 4-6 years for childhood behavioral problems during the early school years. Children with lower levels of improvement in self-regulation early in life are at risk for higher levels of behavioral problems both at home and at school.

Extended biopsy improves diagnostic accuracy and provides more reliable prognostic information. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that greater biopsy core number should result in improved treatment outcome through better tailoring of therapy. Methods and Materials: From April 1995 to May 2006, 1,613 prostate cancer patients were treated with permanent brachytherapy. Patients were divided into five groups stratified by the number of prostate biopsy cores ({<=}6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-20, and >20 cores). Biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluatedmoreÂ Â» as a function of core number. Results: The median patient age was 66 years, and the median preimplant prostate-specific antigen was 6.5 ng/mL. The overall 10-year bPFS, CSS, and OS were 95.6%, 98.3%, and 78.6%, respectively. When bPFS was analyzed as a function of core number, the 10-year bPFS for patients with >20, 13-20, 10-12, 7-9 and {<=}6 cores was 100%, 100%, 98.3%, 95.8%, and 93.0% (p < 0.001), respectively. When evaluated by treatment era (1995-2000 vs. 2001-2006), the number of biopsy cores remained a statistically significant predictor of bPFS. On multivariate analysis, the number of biopsy cores was predictive of bPFS but did not predict for CSS or OS. Conclusion: Greater biopsy core number was associated with a statistically significant improvement in bPFS. Comprehensive regional sampling of the prostate may enhance diagnostic accuracy compared to a standard biopsy scheme, resulting in better tailoring of therapy.Â«Â less\n\nGreater improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness using higher-intensity interval training in the standard cardiac rehabilitation setting.\n\nPubMed\n\nKeteyian, Steven J; Hibner, Brooks A; Bronsteen, Kyle; Kerrigan, Dennis; Aldred, Heather A; Reasons, Lisa M; Saval, Mathew A; Brawner, Clinton A; Schairer, John R; Thompson, Tracey M S; Hill, Jason; McCulloch, Derek; Ehrman, Jonathon K\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe tested the hypothesis that higher-intensity interval training (HIIT) could be deployed into a standard cardiac rehabilitation (CR) setting and would result in a greater increase in cardiorespiratory fitness (ie, peak oxygen uptake, (Â·)VOâ) versus moderate-intensity continuous training (MCT). Thirty-nine patients participating in a standard phase 2 CR program were randomized to HIIT or MCT; 15 patients and 13 patients in the HIIT and MCT groups, respectively, completed CR and baseline and followup cardiopulmonary exercise testing. No patients in either study group experienced an event that required hospitalization during or within 3 hours after exercise. The changes in resting heart rate and blood pressure at followup testing were similar for both HIIT and MCT. (Â·)VOâ at ventilatory-derived anaerobic threshold increased more (P < .05) with HIIT (3.0 Â± 2.8 mLÂ·kgâ»Â¹Â·minâ»Â¹) versus MCT (0.7 Â± 2.2 mLÂ·kgâ»Â¹Â·minâ»Â¹). During followup testing, submaximal heart rate at the end of stage 2 of the exercise test was significantly lower within both the HIIT and MCT groups, with no difference noted between groups. Peak (Â·)VOâ improved more after CR in patients in HIIT versus MCT (3.6 Â± 3.1 mLÂ·kgâ»Â¹Â·minâ»Â¹ vs 1.7 Â± 1.7 mLÂ·kgâ»Â¹Â·minâ»Â¹; P < .05). Among patients with stable coronary heart disease on evidence-based therapy, HIIT was successfully integrated into a standard CR setting and, when compared to MCT, resulted in greater improvement in peak exercise capacity and submaximal endurance.\n\nImproving Demonstration Using Better Interaction Techniques\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1997-01-14\n\nProgramming by demonstration (PBD) can be used to create tools and methods that eliminate the need to learn difficult computer languages.

The benefits of HIEs to payers and providers include lower cost, faster services, and better health outcome. However, most HIEs have configured the patient healthcare consent process to give all providers who sign up with the exchange access to PHI for all consenting patients, leaving no control to patients in customized what information to share and with who. This research investigates the impact of granting greater control to patients in sharing their personal health information on consent rates and making them active participants in the HIEs system. This research utilizes a randomized experimental survey design study. The study uses responses from 388 participants and structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the conceptual model. The main findings of this research include that patients consent rate increases significantly when greater control in sharing PHI is offered to the patient. In addition, greater control reduces the negative impact of privacy concern on the intention to consent. Similarly, trust in healthcare professionals leads to higher consent when greater control is offered to the patient. Thus, greater control empowers the role of trust in engaging patients and sustaining HIEs. The paper makes a theoretical contribution to research by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model. The findings impact practice by providing insights that will help sustain HIEs. Copyright Â© 2018.

The relationship between NDVI and the ratio vegetation index (RVI) at high NDVI values was investigated, and an empirical equation for estimating saturation-adjusted NDVI (NDVIsat_adjust) based on RVI was developed. A 10-year (2000â2009) NDVIsat_adjustÂ data set was developed using 250-m 7-day composite historical eMODIS (expedited Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI data. The growing season averaged NDVI (GSN), which is a proxy for ecosystem performance, was estimated and long-term NDVI non-saturation- and saturation-adjusted cropland performance (CPnon_sat_adjust, CPsat_adjust) maps were produced over the GPRB. The final CP maps were validated using National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) crop yield data. The relationship between CPsat_adjustÂ and the NASS average corn yield data (rÂ =Â 0.78, 113 samples) is stronger than the relationship between CPnon_sat_adjustÂ and the NASS average corn yield data (rÂ =Â 0.67, 113 samples), indicating that the new CPsat_adjustÂ map reduces the NDVI saturation effects and is in good agreement with the corn yield ground observations. Results demonstrate that the NDVI saturation adjustment approach improves the quality of the original GSN map and better depicts the actual vegetation conditions of the GPRB cropland systems.\n\nResidential Energy Efficiency Demonstration: Hawaii and Guam Energy Improvement Technology Demonstration Project\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nEarle, L.; Sparn, B.; Rutter, A.\n\n2014-03-01\n\nIn order to meet its energy goals, the Department of Defense (DOD) has partnered with the Department of Energy (DOE) to rapidly demonstrate and deploy cost-effective renewable energy and energy-efficiency technologies.

However, there has been little investigation of participant characteristics that may be associated with change in risk factors during such programs. The aim of this paper is to identify participant characteristics associated with improved waist circumference (WC) following participation in a four-month, pedometer-based, physical activity, workplace health program. 762 adults employed in primarily sedentary occupations and voluntarily enrolled in a four-month workplace program aimed at increasing physical activity were recruited from ten Australian worksites in 2008. Seventy-nine percent returned at the end of the health program. Data included demographic, behavioural, anthropometric and biomedical measurements. WC change (before versus after) was assessed by multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses. Seven groupings of potential associated variables from baseline were sequentially added to build progressively larger regression models. Greater improvement in WC during the program was associated with having completed tertiary education, consuming two or less standard alcoholic beverages in one occasion in the twelve months prior to baseline, undertaking less baseline weekend sitting time and lower baseline total cholesterol. A greater WC at baseline was strongly associated with a greater improvement in WC. A sub-analysis in participants with a 'high-risk' baseline WC revealed that younger age, enrolling for reasons other than appearance, undertaking less weekend sitting time at baseline, eating two or more pieces of fruit per day at baseline, higher baseline physical functioning and lower baseline body mass index were associated with greater odds of moving to 'low risk' WC at the end of the program. While employees with 'high-risk' WC at baseline experienced the greatest improvements in WC, the other variables associated with greater WC improvement\n\nGreater Working Memory Load Results in Greater Medial Temporal Activity at Retrieval\n\nPubMed Central\n\nQuiroz, Yakeel T.; Hasselmo, Michael E.; Stern, Chantal E.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nMost functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies examining working memory (WM) load have focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and have demonstrated increased prefrontal activity with increased load. Here we examined WM load effects in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) using an fMRI Sternberg task with novel complex visual scenes. Trials consisted of 3 sequential events: 1) sample presentation (encoding), 2) delay period (maintenance), and 3) probe period (retrieval). During sample encoding, subjects saw either 2 or 4 pictures consecutively. During retrieval, subjects indicated whether the probe picture matched one of the sample pictures. Results revealed that activity in the left anterior hippocampal formation, bilateral retrosplenial area, and left amygdala was greater at retrieval for trials with larger memory load, whereas activity in the PFC was greater at encoding for trials with larger memory load. There was no load effect during the delay. When encoding, maintenance, and retrieval periods were compared with fixation, activity was present in the hippocampal body/tail and fusiform gyrus bilaterally during encoding and retrieval, but not maintenance. Bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal activity was present during maintenance, but not during encoding or retrieval. The results support models of WM predicting that activity in the MTL should be modulated by WM load.

Objectives and Methods We report on a patient with HE and significant clinical improvement correlating with an increase in cerebral blood flow demonstrated by hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). HMPAO-SPECT was performed with 740 MBq of technetium-99m-HMPAO. To demonstrate the improvement in regional cerebral blood flow, individual regions of interest were drawn around visually diminished HMPAO uptake, the lesion to reference region ratio was calculated and transverse section images and semi-quantitative measurements were performed. Results We show a 5-year follow-up with significant clinical improvement, a 10-fold reduction in autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase and an approximately 20% improvement in cerebral blood flow with HMPAO-SPECT. Conclusion Adequate levothyroxine treatment achieving and maintaining euthyroidism should be considered as therapy to lower autoantibodies and improve clinical outcome in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and encephalopathy.

This project was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS) was the prime contractor and co-funder of the project. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America (MHIA) and AECOM were project team members. The overall project objective was to improve costs, energy requirements, and performance of an existing amine-based CO 2 capture process. This will occur via improvements inmoreÂ Â» three areas: 1. Reboiler design â The first objective of the program was to demonstrate performance of an integrated stripper/reboiler (termed Built-in Reboiler, or BIR) to reduce footprint, capital costs, and integration issues of the current technology. 2. Particulate management â The second objective was to carry out a Particulate Matter Management (PMM) test. This has the potential to reduce operating costs and capital costs due to the reduced or eliminated need for mechanical filtration. 3. Solvent â The third objective was to carry out a new solvent test plan (referred to as NSL) to demonstrate a new solvent (termed New Solvent A), which is expected to reduce regeneration steam. The bulk price is also expected to be lower than KS-1, which is the current solvent used in this process. NSL testing would include baseline testing, optimization, long term testing, solvent reclamation testing, and final inspection. These combine to form the Advanced Carbon Capture (ACC) technology. Much of this work will be applicable to generic solvent processes, especially in regards to improved reboiler design, and focused to meet or exceed the DOEâs overall carbon capture performance goals of 90% CO 2 capture rate with 95% CO 2 purity at a cost of $40/tonne of CO 2 by 2025 and at\n\nDemonstration Technique to Improve Vocabulary and Grammar Element in Teaching Speaking at EFL Learners\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHusnu, Muhammad\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis study aimed at examining the effectiveness of demonstration technique to improve vocabulary and grammar element in teaching speaking at EFL learners.

Wetlands have been shown to be efficient in particle removal, primarily through dry deposition and leaf accumulation. Thus, a more comprehensive understanding of PM2.5 removal by wetlands during urbanization processes could inform urban planning. In the current study, three wetland plots, Cuihu Lake Park (CL), Summer Palace (SP), and Olympic Park (OP), were selected as low, medium, and highly degrees of urbanization site respectively based on the proportions of building and traffic district areas to compare the removal efficiencies. Results show the average dry deposition velocity in OP was significantly higher than CL and SP. Dry deposition is mainly influenced by meteorological conditions. Buildings and other infrastructure make the meteorological conditions conducive to deposition, resulting in higher wind velocity, higher temperature, and more intense turbulence between buildings. Variation in leaf accumulation was not statistically significant between the three plots, and plant species was the major factor affecting the amount of accumulation. The dry deposition contribution to particle removal increases with degree of urbanization. The average dry deposition accounted for 39.74%, 52.55%, and 62.75% at low, middle and high level respectively. Therefore, Wetlands with greater degree of urbanization improve PM2.5 removal efficiency primarily by accelerating the dry deposition process. The result emphasizes the importance of wetlands in particle removal in highly urbanized areas and thus more wetlands should be preserved and/or created during urban expansion.

Timing of MCT operation has, until now, been inferred based on specific tectonic models, or with data not directly attributable to MCT movement, e.g., the debatable assertion that leucogranite formation is invariably related to crustal shortening, and therefore that the MCT must already have been in operation. However the tectonic evolution may have been more complex, e.g., at times involving horizontal extension. In any case, many different thrust systems operated during India-Asia convergence, and the MCT is only one of them. It is time to move away from models and to bring geology back into the equation. Here we apply 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to directly date highly strained, phyllonitized, muscovite in the MCT above the Kullu-Rampur tectonic window (NW Indian Himalaya), showing that the timing of the shear movement lasted from 15-9 Ma. We show that these ages have been preserved because the white mica was sufficiently retentive of argon to be able to inhibit its diffusional loss at the temperatures and pressures in question. Arrhenius data from ultra-high-vacuum diffusion experiments show that deformation occurred below the closure temperature of this muscovite, for moderate cooling rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microscopic shear bands associated with MCT operation overprinted an earlier decussate mica growth. This decussate growth had taken place prior to Ë 18 Ma. The decussate microstructure, together with foam textures in the host deformed quartzite, demonstrate that low deviatoric stress conditions applied during a prior period of static annealing under middle- to upper-greenschist facies conditions. In this region, therefore, the Greater Himalayan Crystalline had therefore already been significantly exhumed prior to the onset of MCT operation.

Secondary data analysis of 2001-2010 Medicare claims for 1,776,387 person years assigned to the ten participating provider organizations and 1,579,080 person years in the corresponding local comparison groups. We used a pre-post comparison group observational design consisting of four pre-demonstration years (1/01-12/04) and five demonstration years (4/05-3/10). We employed a propensity-weighted difference-in-differences regression model to estimate demonstration effects, adjusting for demographics, health status, geographic area, and secular trends. The ten demonstration sites combined saved $171 (2.0%) per assigned beneficiary person year (p<0.001) during the five-year demonstration period. Medicare paid performance bonuses to the participating PGPs that averaged $102 per person year. The net savings to the Medicare program were $69 (0.8%) per person year. Demonstration savings were achieved primarily from the inpatient setting. The demonstration improved quality of care as measured by six of seven claims-based process quality indicators. The PGP demonstration, which used a payment model similar to the Medicare Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program, resulted in small reductions in Medicare expenditures and inpatient utilization, and improvements in process quality indicators. Judging from this demonstration experience, it is unlikely that Medicare ACOs will initially achieve large savings. Nevertheless, ACOs paid through shared savings may be an important first step toward greater efficiency and quality in the Medicare fee-for-service program.\n\nSustainability Logistics Basing - Science and Technology Objective - Demonstration; Demonstration #1 - 50 Person Camp Demo\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2017-08-17\n\nsources: solar panels, two wind turbines , JP8/diesel genset, and alternating current (AC) shore power.

The program's legislatively-mandated purpose was to evaluate promising ideas for improving the quality of children's health care provided through Medicaid and CHIP. As part of the program's multifaceted evaluation, this study examined the extent to which states sustained key program activities after the demonstration ended. Methods We identified 115 potentially sustainable elements within states' CHIPRA demonstrations and analyzed data from grantee reports and key informant interviews to assess sustainment outcomes and key influential factors. We also assessed sustainment of the projects' intellectual capital. Results 56% of potentially sustainable elements were sustained. Sustainment varied by topic area: Elements related to quality measure reporting and practice facilitation were more likely to be sustained than others, such as parent advisors. Broad contextual factors, the state's Medicaid environment, implementation partners' resources, and characteristics of the demonstration itself all shaped sustainment outcomes. Discussion Assessing sustainment of key elements of states' CHIPRA quality demonstration projects provides insight into the fates of the \"promising ideas\" that the grant program was designed to examine. As a result of the federal government's investment in this grant program, many demonstration states are in a strong position to extend and spread specific strategies for improving the quality of care for children in Medicaid and CHIP. Our findings provide insights for policymakers and providers working to improve the quality of health care for low income children.\n\nSurgical treatment of high-standing greater trochanter.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakata, K; Maniwa, S; Ochi, M\n\n1999-01-01\n\nEleven patients with high-standing greater trochanter (13 joints) aged 13-36 years underwent surgery. Distal transfer of the greater trochanter (group T) was performed in 4 patients (5 joints) and lateral displacement osteotomy (group L) in 7 (8 joints). The average follow-up duration was 13.4 years in group T and 5.9 years in group L. Clinical results were evaluated by the hip score according to Merle d'Aubigne. The mean hip score in group T was 13.4 points before operation and 15.4 points after operation, and in group L, 12.8 and 17.4 points, respectively. The postoperative clinical results of group L were significantly better than those of group T (P = 0.0494). In radiological evaluation, although the articulo-trochanteric distance (ATD) increased in both groups in group L it improved remarkably from 9.8 to 24.3, indicating a large descending distance of the greater trochanter. The lever arm ratio (LAR) did not change significantly in group T, but it decreased from 1.97 to 1.60 in group L (P = 0.004). This means that the lever arm of the abductors can certainly be extended by lateral displacement osteotomy. Lateral displacement osteotomy is the most effective procedure for high-standing greater trochanter.\n\nAttendance Improvement and Dropout Prevention (AIDP) Demonstration and Replication Program 1989.

We test the hypothesis that among hypertensive individuals, those with greater social capital are more likely to have their hypertension detected, treated and controlled. Cross-sectional data from 21 countries in the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology study were collected covering 61â229 hypertensive individuals aged 35-70 years, their households and the 656 communities in which they live. Outcomes include whether hypertensive participants have their condition detected, treated and/or controlled. Multivariate statistical models adjusting for community fixed effects were used to assess the associations of three social capital measures: (1) membership of any social organisation, (2) trust in other people and (3) trust in organisations, stratified into high-income and low-income country samples. In low-income countries, membership of any social organisation was associated with a 3% greater likelihood of having one's hypertension detected and controlled, while greater trust in organisations significantly increased the likelihood of detection by 4%. These associations were not observed among participants in high-income countries. Although the observed associations are modest, some aspects of social capital are associated with better management of hypertension in low-income countries where health systems are often weak. Given that hypertension affects millions in these countries, even modest gains at all points along the treatment pathway could improve management for many, and translate into the prevention of thousands of cardiovascular events each year.\n\nMacro vs micro level surgical quality improvement: a regional collaborative demonstrates the case for a national NSQIP initiative.\n\nPubMed\n\nTepas, Joseph J; Kerwin, Andrew J; deVilla, Jhun; Nussbaum, Michael S\n\n2014-04-01\n\nThe Florida Surgical Care Initiative (FSCI) is a quality improvement collaborative of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and the Florida Hospital Association. In the wake of a dramatic decrease in complications and cost documented over 15 months, we analyzed the semiannual measures reports (SAR) to determine whether this improvement was driven by specific institutions or was a global accomplishment by all participants. Reports from NSQIP were analyzed to determine rank change of participants. Odds ratio (OR) of observed-to-expected incidence of the 4 FSCI outcomes (catheter-associated urinary tract infection [CAUTI], surgical site infection [SSI], colorectal, and surgery in patients older than 65 years) were used to assess individual and group performance. Data from SAR 2 (October 2011 to April 2012) were compared with data from SAR 3 (May to July 2012). Poorly performing hospitals were tracked to determine evidence of improvement. Individual facility performance was evaluated by determining proportion of hospitals showing improved rank across all measures. Fifty-four hospitals were evaluated. SAR 2 reported 28,112 general and vascular surgical cases; SAR 3 added 10,784 more. The proportion of institutions with OR < 1 for each measure did not change significantly. Only urinary tract infection and colorectal measures demonstrated increased number of hospitals with OR < 1. Each institution that was a significant negative outlier in SAR 2 demonstrated improvement. Three of 54 hospitals demonstrated improvement across all 4 measures. Of 15 hospitals with improved performance across 3 measures, all included elderly surgery. The increase in quality achieved across this population of surgical patients was the result of a quality assessment process driven by NSQIP rather than disproportionate improvement of some raising the bar for all.

These include next generation cloud and aerosol lidars that incorporates a UV channel, direct detection 3-D wind lidars, and ozone DIAL (differential absorption lidar) system. In previous SBIR funded work we developed techniques for increasing the survivability of components in high power UV lasers and demonstrated improved operational lifetimes. In this Phase III ESTO funded effort we are designing and building a TRL (Technology Readiness Level) 6 demonstrator that will have increased output power and a space-qualifiable package that is mechanically robust and thermally-stable. For full space compatibility, thermal control will be through pure conductive cooling. Contamination control processes and optical coatings will be chosen that are compatible with lifetimes in excess of 1 billion shots. The 1064nm output will be frequency tripled to provide greater than 100mJ pulses of 355nm light at 150 Hz. After completing the laser module build in the third quarter of 2015 we will initiate lifetime testing, followed by thermal/vacuum (TVAC) and vibration testing to demonstrate that the design is at TRL 6.\n\nDoes greater individual social capital improve the management of hypertension?

We test the hypothesis that among hypertensive individuals, those with greater social capital are more likely to have their hypertension detected, treated and controlled. Methods Cross-sectional data from 21 countries in the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology study were collected covering 61â229 hypertensive individuals aged 35â70 years, their households and the 656 communities in which they live. Outcomes include whether hypertensive participants have their condition detected, treated and/or controlled. Multivariate statistical models adjusting for community fixed effects were used to assess the associations of three social capital measures: (1) membership of any social organisation, (2) trust in other people and (3) trust in organisations, stratified into high-income and low-income country samples. Results In low-income countries, membership of any social organisation was associated with a 3% greater likelihood of having oneâs hypertension detected and controlled, while greater trust in organisations significantly increased the likelihood of detection by 4%. These associations were not observed among participants in high-income countries. Conclusion Although the observed associations are modest, some aspects of social capital are associated with better management of hypertension in low-income countries where health systems are often weak. Given that hypertension affects millions in these countries, even modest gains at all points along the treatment pathway could improve management for many, and translate into the prevention of thousands of cardiovascular events each year.

The programâs legislatively-mandated purpose was to evaluate promising ideas for improving the quality of childrenâs health care provided through Medicaid and CHIP. As part of the programâs multifaceted evaluation, this study examined the extent to which states sustained key program activities after the demonstration ended. Methods We identified 115 potentially sustainable elements within statesâ CHIPRA demonstrations and analyzed data from grantee reports and key informant interviews to assess sustainment outcomes and key influential factors. We also assessed sustainment of the projectsâ intellectual capital. Results 56% of potentially sustainable elements were sustained. Sustainment varied by topic area: Elements related to quality measure reporting and practice facilitation were more likely to be sustained than others, such as parent advisors. Broad contextual factors, the stateâs Medicaid environment, implementation partnersâ resources, and characteristics of the demonstration itself all shaped sustainment outcomes. Discussion Assessing sustainment of key elements of statesâ CHIPRA quality demonstration projects provides insight into the fates of the âpromising ideasâ that the grant program was designed to examine. As a result of the federal governmentâs investment in this grant program, many demonstration states are in a strong position to extend and spread specific strategies for improving the quality of care for children in Medicaid and CHIP. Our findings provide insights for policymakers and providers working to improve the quality of health care for low income children.

There are no controlled data demonstrating whether arterial obstruction status predicts the treatment effect of intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). We aimed to determine if the presence of arterial obstruction improves the treatment effect of IV tPA over placebo in attenuating infarct growth. We analyzed 175 ischemic stroke patients treated in the 3-6 hour time window from the Echoplanar Imaging Thrombolytic Evaluation Trial (EPITHET) trial (randomized to IV tPA or placebo) and Diffusion and perfusion imaging Evaluation For Understanding Stroke Evolution (DEFUSE) study (all treated with IV tPA). Infarct growth was calculated as the difference between baseline diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and final T2 lesion volumes. Baseline arterial obstruction of large intracranial arteries was graded on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Among the 116 patients with adequate baseline MRA and final lesion assessment, 72 had arterial obstruction (48 tPA, 24 placebo) and 44 no arterial obstruction (33 tPA, 11 placebo). Infarct growth was lower in the tPA than placebo group (median difference 26ml, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1-50) in patients with arterial obstruction, but was similar in patients with no arterial obstruction (median difference 5ml, 95%CI, -3 to 9). Infarct growth attenuation with tPA over placebo treatment was greater among patients with arterial obstruction than those without arterial obstruction by a median of 32ml (95%CI, 21-43, p < 0.001). The treatment effect of IV tPA over placebo was greater with baseline arterial obstruction, supporting arterial obstruction status as a consideration in selecting patients more likely to benefit from IV thrombolysis.

A meta-study of web-based vs. classroom instruction by Sitzmann et al (2006) discovered that the degree of learner control positively influences the effectiveness of instruction: students do better when they are in control of their own learning. In particular, web-based courses are more effective when they incorporate a larger variety of instructional methods. To address this need, we developed a series of online videos to demonstrate various astronomical concepts and provided them to students enrolled in an online introductory astronomy course at Penn State University. We found that the online students performed worse than the F2F students on questions unrelated to the videos (t = -2.84), but that the online students who watched the videos performed better than the F2F students on related examination questions (t = 2.11). We also found that the online students who watched the videos performed significantly better than those who did not (t = 3.43). While the videos in general proved helpful, some videos were more helpful than others. We will discuss our thoughts on why this might be, and future plans to improve upon this study. These videos are freely available on iTunesU, YouTube, and Google Video.\n\nIntegrated propulsion technology demonstrator. Program plan\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1994-01-01\n\nNASA and Rockwell have embarked on a cooperative agreement to define, develop, fabricate, and operate an integrated propulsion technology demonstrator (IPTD) for the purpose of validating design, process, and technology improvements of launch vehicle propulsion systems. This program, a result of NRA8-11, Task Area 1 A, is jointly funded by both NASA and Rockwell and is sponsored by the Reusable Launch Vehicle office at NASA Marshall Space flight Center. This program plan provides to the joint NASA/Rockwell integrated propulsion technology demonstrator (IPTD) team a description of the activities within tasks / sub tasks and associated schedules required to successfully achieve program objectives. This document also defines the cost elements and manpower allocations for each sub task for purpose of program control. This plan is updated periodically by developing greater depth of direction for outyear tasks as the program matures. Updating is accomplished by adding revisions to existing pages or attaching page revisions to this plan. In either case, revisions will be identified by appropriate highlighting of the change, or specifying a revision page through the use of footnotes on the bottom right of each change page. Authorization for the change is provided by the principal investigators to maintain control of this program plan document and IPTD program activities.\n\nQuantitative colorectal cancer perfusion measurement by multidetector-row CT: does greater tumour coverage improve measurement reproducibility?\n\nPubMed\n\nGoh, V; Halligan, S; Gartner, L; Bassett, P; Bartram, C I\n\n2006-07-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine if greater z-axis tumour coverage improves the reproducibility of quantitative colorectal cancer perfusion measurements using CT. A 65 s perfusion study was acquired following intravenous contrast administration in 10 patients with proven colorectal cancer using a four-detector row scanner. This was repeated within 48 h using identical technical parameters to allow reproducibility assessment. Quantitative tumour blood volume, blood flow, mean transit time and permeability measurements were determined using commercially available software (Perfusion 3.0; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) for data obtained from a 5 mm z-axis tumour coverage, and from a 20 mm z-axis tumour coverage. Measurement reproducibility was assessed using Bland-Altman statistics, for a 5 mm z-axis tumour coverage, and 20 mm z-axis tumour coverage, respectively. The mean difference (95% limits of agreement) for blood volume, blood flow, mean transit time and permeability were 0.04 (-2.50 to +2.43) ml/100 g tissue; +8.80 (-50.5 to +68.0) ml/100 g tissue/min; -0.99 (-8.19 to +6.20) seconds; and +1.20 (-5.42 to +7.83) ml/100 g tissue/min, respectively, for a 5 mm coverage, and -0.04 (-2.61 to +2.53) ml/100 g tissue; +7.40 (-50.3 to +65.0) ml/100 g tissue/min; -2.46 (-12.61 to +7.69) seconds; and -0.23 (-8.31 to +7.85) ml/100 g tissue/min, respectively, for a 20 mm coverage, indicating similar levels of agreement. In conclusion, increasing z-axis coverage does not improve reproducibility of quantitative colorectal cancer perfusion measurements.\n\nOn the Occurrence of Standardized Regression Coefficients Greater than One.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDeegan, John, Jr.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nIt is demonstrated here that standardized regression coefficients greater than one can legitimately occur.

We report large subsets of SNPs from the International HapMap Project that allow us to overcome these biases and to provide accurate measurement of a quantity of crucial importance for understanding genetic variation: the allele frequency spectrum. Our analysis shows that East Asian and northern European ancestors shared the same population bottleneck expanding out of Africa but that both also experienced more recent genetic drift, which was greater in East Asians.\n\nDoes Greater Autonomy Improve School Performance?

M.; Burian, S. J.; Lauer, J. W.; Mathisen, P. P.; Mays, D. C.; Olson, M. S.; Pomeroy, C. A.; Ruddell, B. L.; Sciortino, A.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nResearch has shown that the use of demonstrations and hands-on activities in the classroom enhances student learning. Students learn more and enjoy classes more when visual and active learning are incorporated into the lecture. Most college-aged students prefer visual modes of learning, while most instruction is conducted in a lecture, or auditory, format. The use of classroom demonstrations provides opportunities for incorporating visual and active learning into the classroom environment. However, while most instructors acknowledge the benefits of these teaching methods, they typically do not have the time and resources to develop and test such activities and to develop plans to incorporate them into their lectures. Members of the Excellence in Water Resources Education Task Committee of the Environmental and Water Resources Institute (EWRI) of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) have produced a publication that contains a collection of activities aimed to foster excellence in water resources and hydrology education and improve student learning of principles. The book contains forty-five demonstrations and activities that can be used in water-related classes with topics in fluid mechanics, hydraulics, surface water hydrology, groundwater hydrology, and water quality. We present examples of these activities, including topics such as conservation of momentum, buoyancy, Bernoulli's principle, drag force, pipe flow, watershed delineation, reservoir networks, head distribution in aquifers, and molecular diffusion in a porous medium. Unlike full laboratory exercises, these brief demonstrations and activities (most of which take less than fifteen minutes) can be easily incorporated into classroom lectures. For each demonstration, guidance for preparing and conducting the activity, along with a brief overview of the principles that are demonstrated, is provided. The target audience of the activities is undergraduate students, although the activities also may be\n\nThinspiration: Self-Improvement Versus Self-Evaluation Social Comparisons with Thin-Ideal Media Portrayals.\n\nPubMed\n\nKnobloch-Westerwick, Silvia\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMuch research has demonstrated negative impacts of idealized-body imagery exposure on body satisfaction. Yet, paradoxically, media with such imagery attract mass audiences. Few studies showed women's body satisfaction increased due to thin-ideal exposure. The kind of social comparison women engage in (self-evaluation vs. self-improvement) may explain these inconsistent findings and the paradoxical attraction to thin-ideal messages. Across 5 days, thin-ideal messages were presented to 51 women; self-evaluation and self-improvement social comparisons as well as body satisfaction were measured each day. A linear positive change in body satisfaction emerged. Greater self-improvement social comparisons increased this change, whereas greater self-evaluation social comparisons reduced it. Extent of both social comparison types changed during the prolonged exposure. A greater tendency to compare one's body with others' improved body satisfaction through self-improvement social comparisons and fostered weight-loss behaviors through self-evaluation social comparisons.\n\nGreater Occipital Nerve Decompression for Occipital Neuralgia.\n\nPubMed\n\nJose, Anson; Nagori, Shakil Ahmed; Chattopadhyay, Probodh K; Roychoudhury, Ajoy\n\n2018-05-14\n\nThe aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of greater occipital nerve decompression for the management of occipital neuralgia. Eleven patients of medical refractory occipital neuralgia were enrolled in the study. Local anaesthetic blocks were used for confirming diagnosis. All of them underwent surgical decompression of greater occipital nerve at the level of semispinalis capitis and trapezial tunnel. A pre and postoperative questionnaire was used to compare the severity of pain and number of pain episodes/month. Mean pain episodes reported by patients before surgery were 17.1âÂ±â5.63 episodes per month. This reduced to 4.1âÂ±â3.51 episodes per month (Pâ<â0.0036) postsurgery. The mean intensity of pain also reduced from a preoperative 7.18âÂ±â1.33 to a postoperative of 1.73âÂ±â1.95 (Pâ<â0.0033). Three patients reported complete elimination of pain after surgery while 6 patients reported significant relief of their symptoms. Only 2 patients failed to notice any significant improvement. The mean follow-up period was 12.45âÂ±â1.29 months. Surgical decompression of greater occipital nerve is a simple and viable treatment modality for the management of occipital neuralgia.\n\nReproduction and monogamy in captive flock of greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus Roseus).\n\nPubMed\n\nSandri, Camillo; Sammarini, Carolina; Regaiolli, Barbara; Spiezio, Caterina; Piccirillo, Alessandra\n\n2018-01-01\n\nDue to the great number of greater flamingos in captivity and their long life span, studying their behavior and welfare might be useful to improve the husbandry and breeding of this species in zoos. This study aimed to investigate factors affecting the breeding activity of captive greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) from 2012 to 2016. To estimate reproductive success, the number of pairs, eggs laid, and hatchlings were recorded. In addition, information on age, egg-laying history of the partners, and pair composition was collected. An increase in the number of pairs, eggs, and hatchlings was reported over the years. For each breeding season, there were pairs who laid more than once, especially in 2014 and 2015. Approximately 50% of pairs were monogamous between consecutive years; however, the percentage dropped gradually when comparing nonconsecutive years. Senescence and previous experience seemed to affect the reproductive success of the study flamingos. In conclusion, different factors can influence the reproduction of greater flamingos in zoos. All these factors are related to nonhuman animal welfare and need to be considered in developing and improving management practices.\n\nAEP Ohio gridSMART Demonstration Project Real-Time Pricing Demonstration Analysis\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWidergren, Steven E.; Subbarao, Krishnappa; Fuller, Jason C.\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThis report contributes initial findings from an analysis of significant aspects of the gridSMARTÂ® Real-Time Pricing (RTP) â Double Auction demonstration project.

In general, tele-seismic body wave contains information of overall rupture process of large earthquake, while the tele-seismic body wave is inappropriate for analyzing a detailed rupture process of M6 7 class earthquake. Recently, the quality and quantity of tele-seismic data and the inversion method has been greatly improved. Improved data and method enable us to study a detailed rupture process of M6 7 class earthquake even if we use only tele-seismic body wave. In this study, we demonstrate the ability of the improved data and method through analyses of the 2016 Rieti, Italy earthquake (Mw 6.2) and the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan earthquake (Mw 7.0) that have been well investigated by using the InSAR data set and the field observations. We assumed the rupture occurring on a single fault plane model inferred from the moment tensor solutions and the aftershock distribution. We constructed spatiotemporal discretized slip-rate functions with patches arranged as closely as possible. We performed inversions using several fault models and found that the spatiotemporal location of large slip-rate area was robust. In the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan earthquake, the slip-rate distribution shows that the rupture propagated to southwest during the first 5 s. At 5 s after the origin time, the main rupture started to propagate toward northeast. First episode and second episode correspond to rupture propagation along the Hinagu fault and the Futagawa fault, respectively. In the 2016 Rieti, Italy earthquake, the slip-rate distribution shows that the rupture propagated to up-dip direction during the first 2 s, and then rupture propagated toward northwest. From both analyses, we propose that the spatiotemporal slip-rate distribution estimated by improved inversion method of tele-seismic body wave has enough information to study a detailed rupture process of M6 7 class earthquake.\n\nFemoropopliteal Bypass with Varicose Greater Saphenous Vein\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMun, Yun Su; Cho, Byung Sun; Jang, Je-Ho; Lee, Moon-Soo; Kwon, Oh Sang\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSurgical bypass for peripheral arterial occlusive disease can be performed using different graft materials. Autogenous greater saphenous vein (GSV) is the treatment of choice because of its superior long-term patency.

Fourteen volleyball players were divided into 2 groups-returners (nâ=â7) and new players (nâ=â7)-who completed a 5-wk peaking phase prior to conference championships. Players were tested at baseline before the preseason on measures of the vastus lateralis cross-sectional area using ultrasonography, estimated back-squat 1-repetition maximum, countermovement jump height (JH), and relative peak power on a force platform. Jumping performance, rating of perceived exertion training load, and sets played were recorded weekly during the peaking phase. There were moderate to very large (Pâ<â.01, Glass Îâ=â1.74) and trivial to very large (Pâ=â.07, Îâ=â1.09) differences in JH and relative peak power changes in favor of returners over new players, respectively, during the peaking phase. Irrespective of group, 7 of 14 players achieved peak JH 2 wk after the initial overreach. The number of sets played (râ=â.78, Pâ<â.01) and the athlete's preseason relative 1-repetition maximum (râ=â.54, Pâ=â.05) were the strongest correlates of JH changes during the peaking phase. Returners achieved greater improvements in jumping performance during the peaking phase compared with new players, which may be explained by the returners' greater relative maximal strength, time spent competing, and training experience. Thus, volleyball and strength coaches should consider these factors when prescribing training during a peaking phase to ensure their players are prepared for important competitions.\n\nDoes Replacing Live Demonstration With Instructional Videos Improve Student Satisfaction and Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment Examination Performance?\n\nPubMed\n\nSeals, Ryan; Gustowski, Sharon M; Kominski, Carol; Li, Feiming\n\n2016-11-01\n\nInstructional videos for osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) are a potentially valuable resource for novice learners. To evaluate student experiences and the effectiveness of instructional videos in lieu of live faculty demonstration in a second-year osteopathic manipulative medicine course. Faculty created and produced written instructions and videos for selected Still and facilitated positional release techniques. These materials incorporated curricular design principles and psychomotor skills development strategies. During a second-year OMT skills laboratory session, students used the videos as the primary source for technique demonstration and instruction. Table trainers monitored and assisted students per their request or if errors were observed. Students completed surveys regarding their previous experiences in the OMT skills laboratory sessions (presession survey) and the video-based instructional one (postsession survey). One month after the survey, students were also asked to complete a postexamination survey. Student scores on the skills competency examination were compared with scores from the previous year. Of the 230 students, 162 (70%), 135 (59%), and 86 (37%) responded to the presession, postsession, and postexamination surveys, respectively. The majority of students indicated that the OMT videos helped them feel more prepared (98%) and more confident for their examination (78%), were a valuable addition to learning (97%), and would help increase confidence in using osteopathic manipulative medicine on patients (84%). Two-thirds of students indicated that the videos were superior to faculty demonstration from the stage. Compared with students from the previous year, no statistically significant improvement was noted on the total clinical competency examination scores. The faculty-created videos for teaching OMT techniques did not improve scores on the clinical competency examination but had subjective benefits as part of the OMT laboratory\n\nEngineered particles demonstrate improved flow properties at elevated drug loadings for direct compression manufacturing.\n\nPubMed\n\nTrementozzi, Andrea N; Leung, Cheuk-Yui; Osei-Yeboah, Frederick; Irdam, Erwin; Lin, Yiqing; MacPhee, J Michael; Boulas, Pierre; Karki, Shyam B; Zawaneh, Peter N\n\n2017-05-15\n\nOptimizing powder flow and compaction properties are critical for ensuring a robust tablet manufacturing process.

In studying a jet milled API (D 50 =24Î¼m) and particle engineered wet milled API (D 50 =70Î¼m and 90Î¼m), flow functions of all API lots were similarly poor despite the vast difference in average particle size (ff c <4).
