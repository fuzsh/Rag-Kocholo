        "text": "Under the revised contracting conditions for this season's Weber Women's Big Bash League and KFC Big Bash League, clubs are able to enter into one multi-year contract with an international player outside of the male and female international Player Drafts that will take place closer to the start of the season.\n\nKerr made her WBBL debut with the Heat in 2019 and aside from missing a season in 2021-22, has played 58 matches for the club, winning the Heat’s MVP award on three occasions.\n\nShe has scored 854 runs and taken 62 wickets for the Heat in her four seasons with the club, playing in the WBBL championship winning team in her first season in 2019-20 and being part of the club’s past two Finals campaigns including last season’s runners-up team.\n\nQueensland Cricket Head of Elite Cricket Joe Dawes said the club was sad to lose the 23-year-old.\n\n“The club has enjoyed having Melie in the group since she joined us, and it is always a challenge to move on from a player and a person who has contributed so much to our squad.\n\n“It was very rewarding to see her emerge from a tough period in her life a few years ago to then go onto make such a positive impact on her community through her off-field efforts around mental health.”\n\n“Our fans around the country will no doubt be very disappointed not to see her out on the field playing for Brisbane again this summer.\n\n“But we thank her and her family for trusting us back when she signed her first contract to play in the WBBL and certainly wish her all the best as she takes on a new challenge.\n\n“We have some opportunities now in the playing contracting space and will finalise those plans shortly,” Dawes said.\n\nThe Heat has announced the following signings so far for the Weber Women’s Big Bash League, the tenth season the competition has run."
