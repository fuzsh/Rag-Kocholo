These new awards are another example of this.\"\n\nQuick single: Five breakout stars of WBBL|02\n\nAustralian Cricketers’ Association Manager of Female Operations Jodie Fields said the new awards would serve as a well-deserved recognition of the domestic female game in Australia.\n\n\"The introduction of these awards is something that is extremely important to all players, and represents a fantastic opportunity to further celebrate female players at the Allan Border Medal awards night,\" the former Australian captain said.\n\nThe 2017 Allan Border Medal will be held on Monday night at The Star, Sydney.\n\nThe awards ceremony will be broadcast live by the Nine Network on GEM from 7.30pm and will also be streamed live on cricket.com.au and on the Cricket Australia Live app."
