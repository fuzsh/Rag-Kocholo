Difficulties in intraoperative visual assessment of nerve functional status necessitate intraoperative nerve conduction studies (INCSs) by neurosurgeons and neurologists to determine the presence of functioning axons in the zone of a PNI. This process, also referred to as nerve “inching”, uses a set of stimulating and recording electrode hooks to lift the injured nerve from the surrounding surgical field and to determine whether an electrical stimulus can travel through the zone of injury. However, confounding electrical signal artifacts can arise from the current workflow and electrode design, particularly from the mandatory lifting of the nerve, complicating the definitive assessment of nerve function and neurosurgical treatment decision-making. The objective of this study is to describe the design process and verification testing of our group’s newly designed stimulating and recording electrodes that do not require the lifting or displacement of the injured nerve during INCSs. Ergonomic in vivo analysis of the device within a porcine model demonstrated successful intraoperative manipulation of the device, while quantitative nerve action potential (NAP) signal analysis with an ex vivo simulated “inching” procedure on healthy non-human primate nerve tissue demonstrated excellent reproducible recorded NAP fidelity and the absence of NAP signal artifacts at all points of recording. Lastly, electrode pullout force testing determined maximum forces of 0.43 N, 1.57 N, and 3.61 N required to remove the device from 2 mm, 5 mm, and 1 cm nerve models, respectively, which are well within established thresholds for nerve safety. These results suggest that these new electrodes can safely and successfully perform accurate PNI assessment without the presence of artifacts, with the potential to improve the INCS standard of care while remaining compatible with currently used neurosurgical technology, infrastructure, and clinical workflows.

Acquired brain injury (ABI) has also been recognized as one of the main risk factors for VTE. Numerous epidemiological studies have been conducted to assess the risk factors for VTE in institutionalized polytrauma patients, although there is a lack of information about neurorehabilitation wards. Since VTE is often undiagnosed, this prospective study aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of lower-limb deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in ABI patients at neurorehabilitation admission. Methods: ABI patients were screened for DVT on admission to the intensive rehabilitation unit (IRU) with compression ultrasonography and basal D-dimer assay and were daily clinically monitored until discharge. A total of 127 consecutive ABI patients (mean age: 60.1 ± 17.6 years; 63% male; time from event: 30.9 ± 22.1 days; rehabilitation time in IRU: 84.6 ± 58.4 days) were enrolled. Results: On admission to the IRU, the DVT prevalence was about 8.6%. The mean D-dimer level in patients with DVT was significantly higher than in patients without DVT (6 ± 0.9 vs. 1.97 ± 1.61, p-value = 0.0001). ABI patients with DVT did not show any significant clinical characteristics with respect to ABI without DVT, although a prevalence of hemorrhagic strokes and patients originating from the Intensive Care Unit and Neurosurgery ward was revealed. During the rehabilitation period, patients with DVT showed a significant difference in pharmacological DVT prophylaxis (high prevalence of nadroparin with 27.3% vs. 1.7%, p-value = 0.04) and a prevalence of transfers in critical awards (36% versus 9.5% of patients without DVT, p-value = 0.05). The mortality rate was similar in the two groups. Conclusions: Our research offers a more comprehensive view of the clinical development of DVT patients and confirms the prevalence rate of DVT in ABI patients as determined upon IRU admission. According to our findings, screening these individuals regularly at the time of rehabilitation admission may help identify asymptomatic DVT quickly and initiate the proper treatment to avoid potentially fatal consequences. However, to avoid time-consuming general ultrasonography observation, a more precise selection of patients entering the rehabilitation ward is required.

Nonetheless, cancer patients of all ages are susceptible to such risks. Both cancer and its treatments contribute to significant risk factors for disturbances in walking and falls, encompassing muscle weakness, impaired balance, reduced proprioception, cognitive impairment, and functional limitations. Aim: to assess walking speed and the risk of falls among patients undergoing surgery for the most common malignancies: breast (BU), lung (P), colorectal (DS), and reproductive organs (G). Material and Methods: An observational study was conducted using a cohort design. A total of 176 individuals participated in the study, including 139 cancer patients, who were divided into four groups: BU (N = 30), P (N = 35), DS (N = 35), and G (N = 39), as well as 37 healthy volunteers in the control group (C, N = 37). All participants underwent an assessment of walking speed using BTS G-WALK® and an evaluation of the number of falls and the risk of falling using a Fall Control Card. Results: There was a significant decrease in walking speed after surgery compared to the time before surgery, from 2.7% in the BU group, through 9.3% in the P group, and 19.2% in the DS group, to 30.0% in the G group. At the same time, for groups G and DS, the average walking speed fell below 1.0 m/s, amounting to 0.84 m/s and 0.97 m/s, respectively, in the measurement after the surgery and 0.95 m/s and 1.0 m/s in the follow-up measurement. Falling occurred in all the groups except for the BU group. The created logistic regression model showed that increasing the walking speed measured after the procedure (study 2) by 1 m/s reduces the risk of falling by approximately 500 times (OR = 0.002). Limitations in daily activity were observed in the follow-up examination (study 3) in 75% of patients. Conclusions: Surgical intervention has an impact on walking speed, and being part of the study group influences the risk of falling. Further research is needed to determine the precise risk of falls in cancer patients.

The translation processes followed the international recommendations of the FACIT Measurement System. The study was a multicentre cross-sectional study conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 657 individuals who were above 18 years of age and able to write and comprehend Arabic completed the GLS SF5a. Rasch analysis was used to evaluate item fit, reliability indices, item difficulty, principal component analysis and local item dependency. WINSTEPS (v. 5.6.0) was used for the analysis. The translation process and cognitive defibring were completed with no issues. The rating scale categories had a disordered threshold. All items, except one, demonstrated a satisfactory fit to the Rasch model. The reliability of the person separation was 0.86. The scale was unidimensional, and no items showed local dependency. Overall, this study confirms the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the PROMIS GLS SF5a, which can be used as an instrument for measuring general life satisfaction in the general population. Further research is required to explore responsiveness, interpretability and feasibility in the clinical setting.

This retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify the complications of ITB treatment at a tertiary care rehabilitation facility. Various demographic and technical factors were analyzed, which are less often reported in the literature. All patients with ITB who had their refill at the ITB clinic between November 2019 and March 2020 were included. Of 48 patients, 17 patients had 18 (37.5%) ITB-related complications. Catheter-related complications were most common, whereas loss of efficacy (16.7%) and baclofen withdrawal (14.5%) were the most common outcomes of complications. Only catheter occlusion had a significant relationship with the pattern of spastic quadriparesis (p = 0.001). Gender, rehabilitation diagnosis, patients’ residence, and facility of ITB placement did not have significant association. Similarly, age, distance from hospital, disease onset, ITB therapy duration, and baclofen dose were not statistically significant in relation to ITB-related complications.

These impairments contribute negatively to children’s bimanual performance and quality of life. Intensive home-based therapies have been developed and have demonstrated their feasibility for children with US CP and their parents, especially when therapies are designed with the proper coaching of families. Mirror Therapy (MT) is being studied to become an approachable intensive and home-based therapy suitable for children with US CP. The aim of this study is to analyze the feasibility of a five-week home-based program of MT for children with US CP that includes coaching by the therapist. Six children aged 8–12 years old performed the therapy for five days per week, 30 min per day. A minimum of 80% of compliance was required. The feasibility included compliance evaluations, total dosage, perceived difficulty of the exercises, and losses of follow-ups. All children completed the therapy and were included in the analysis. The total accomplishment was 86.47 ± 7.67. The perceived difficulty of the exercises ranged from 2.37 to 4.51 out of 10. In conclusion, a home-based program of Mirror Therapy is a safe, cost-efficient, and feasible therapy for children with US CP when the therapist is involved as a coach during the entire program.

The data exist concerning head posture during increased salivation; however, little is known about muscle tightness during this process. This study aims to investigate whether or not any muscles are related to problems with eating, such as drooling in individuals with cerebral palsy; (2) Methods: Nineteen patients between the ages of 1 and 14 were examined prior to the physiotherapy intervention. This intervention lasted three months and consisted of: relaxing muscles via the strain-counterstrain technique, functional exercises based on the NeuroDevelopmental Treatment-Bobath method, and functional exercises for eating; (3) Results: the tone of rectus capitis posterior minor muscle on the left side (p = 0.027) and temporalis muscle on the right side (p = 0.048) before the therapy, and scalene muscle on the right side after the therapy (p = 0.024) were correlated with drooling behavior and were considered statistically significant. Gross motor function was not considered statistically significant with the occurrence of drooling behavior (p ≤ 0.05). Following the therapeutic intervention, the frequency of drooling during feeding decreased from 63.16% to 38.89% of the total sample of examined patients; (4) Conclusions: The tightness of the muscles in the head area can cause drooling during feeding.

Impairments related to mTBI include vertigo, dizziness, balance, gait disorders double or blurry vision, and others. The efficacy on acute or chronic phase and dosage of vestibular rehabilitation (VR) in reducing these symptoms is not clearly stated. To clarify these points, we performed a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: A systematic literature search was performed from 2015 to 2022 on PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Trial SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, and PEDRO. Eligibility criteria were RCTs which consider VR, participants with mTBI, and no gender or age restriction. Two blinded reviewers independently selected the study, and a third author was contacted in case of disagreements. Risk of bias was independently screened by two authors and successively checked by the other two authors. Results: Thirty-three full articles were read for potential inclusion and seven records met the inclusion criteria. The authors analysed different outcomes considering DHI, a meta-analysis was carried out, statistical difference was observed (p < 0.01), and a mean difference of −6.91 (−9.11, −4.72) in favour of VR was shown. Considering quality of life, the VR group reached a higher score on QOLIBRI. Controversial results were shown about balance and subjective symptoms questionnaire. Differently considering HiMAT, the authors showed a statistically important difference in favour of VR (p = 0.002). Conclusion: VR seems useful to reduce symptoms in patients with concussion; however, a huge heterogeneity of the studies and of the outcomes used were found. Therefore, a larger sample is necessary to assess the efficacy of VR.

Therefore, it is important to comprehensively assess ataxic symptoms and their impact on function. Recently, the movement disorders society recommended four generic ataxia rating scales: scale for assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), international cooperative ataxia rating scales, Friedreich’s ataxia rating scale (FARS), and unified multiple system atrophy rating scale (UMSARS). The aim of the study was to analyze and compare the content of the recommended ataxia rating scales by linking them to the international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF). A total of 125 meaningful concepts from 93 items of the four included scales were linked to 57 different ICF categories. The ICF categories were distributed in body structure (n = 8), body function (n = 26), activity and participation (n = 20), and environmental factors (n = 3) components. UMSARS and FARS were the only ones that have addressed the body structure or environmental factors component. The content analysis of ataxia rating scales would help clinicians and researchers select the most appropriate scale and understand ataxic symptoms and their impact on function. It seems that SARA is the optimal scale for rapid assessment of ataxia or in busy clinical settings. UMSARS or FARS are more appropriate for the investigating the impact of ataxia on overall health, and monitoring ataxia progression and disability.

Various studies have shown that patients with this condition may present cognitive deficits. To compensate for this, several therapeutic strategies have been developed, among them, the LEGO® Education sets, which use the pedagogic enginery to modify cognitive function by didactic material based on mechanics and robotics principles. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of cognitive habilitation by using LEGO®-based therapy in pediatric congenital heart disease patients. This was a quasi-experimental study; eligible patients were identified, and their general data were obtained. In the treatment group, an initial evaluation with the neuropsychological BANFE-2 test was applied; then, once a week, the interventions were performed, with a final test at the end of the interventions. In the control group, after the initial evaluation, a second appointment was scheduled for the final evaluation. Our results show that >50% of children presented cognitive impairment; nevertheless, there was an overall improvement in treatment patients, showing a significant increase in BANFE scores in areas related to executive functions. LEGO®-based therapy may be useful to improve cognitive abilities; however, future research should be performed to strengthen the data.

Studies have shown an association of SUI with nonspecific low back pain (NSLBP). The primary aim of the present study was to explore the long-term effects of a combined treatment of manual techniques and pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training in women suffering from SUI associated with NSLBP. The secondary aim was to evaluate which manual approach combined with PFM rehabilitation is more effective in improving symptoms related to SUI and in reducing pain perception related to NSLBP. Twenty-six patients suffering from SUI associated with chronic NSLBP were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the postural rehabilitation group (PRg) or the spinal mobilization group (SMg). Both groups performed a manual approach combined with PFM rehabilitation. All patients were evaluated before the treatment (T0), after 10 sessions (T1) and after 30 days from the end of the treatment (T2). The results showed an improvement in both groups in all of the investigated outcomes. Combining manual therapy and PFM training within the same therapy session may be useful for improving both SUI and NSLBP and increasing the quality of life of women suffering from SUI associated with NSLBP.

This study analyzed the clinical characteristics of geriatric patients with post-stroke at discharge/transfer after rehabilitation therapy in a chronic-phase hospital. Fifty-three patients (20 men, 33 women; mean age 81.36 ± 8.14 years) were recruited (the period analyzed: October 2013–March 2020). Clinical data were statistically analyzed among patients discharged to homes or facilities for older adults or transferred to another hospital. In addition, we analyzed the clinical items at discharge and transfer after rehabilitation therapy using a decision tree analysis. Twelve patients were discharged, eighteen were discharged to facilities for older adults, and twenty-three were transferred to another hospital. There were significant differences in the modified Rankin Scale, admission dates, functional independence measure (FIM) score, and Barthel Index score in the three groups (p < 0.05). Patients with motor subtotal functional independence scores of ≥14 (chronologically improved ≥5) after rehabilitation therapy for <291 days were more likely to be discharged home. Patients in a chronic-phase hospital who improved within a limited period were discharged to their homes, whereas those who were bedridden tended to be transferred to another hospital.

The aim of this work is to provide a theoretical framework and practical proposal for the management of sexual disability in individuals with LBP. Methods: Based on a literature review, a team of specialized physical therapists developed a pattern for the management of LBP-related sexual disability. Results: A patient reporting LBP-related sexual disability may be included in one of four clinical decision-making pathways corresponding to one of the following: #1 standard physical therapy (PT); #2 psychologically informed physical therapy (PIPT); #3 PIPT with referral; or #4 immediate referral. Standard PT concerns the management of LBP-related sexual disability in the absence of psychosocial or pathological issues. It includes strategies for pain modulation, stiffness management, motor control, stabilization, functional training, pacing activities comprising education, and stay-active advice. PIPT refers to patients with yellow flags or concerns about their relationship with partners; this treatment is oriented towards a specific psychological approach. “PIPT with referral” and “Immediate referral” pathways concern patients needing to be referred to specialists in other fields due to relationship problems or conditions requiring medical management or pelvic floor or sexual rehabilitation. Conclusions: The proposed framework can help clinicians properly manage patients with LBP-related sexual disability.

This condition may impact survivors’ quality of life and includes extensive pulmonary and respiratory outcomes. Respiratory rehabilitation is known for its effects in improving dyspnea, alleviating anxiety and depression, reducing complications, preventing and ameliorating dysfunctions, reducing morbidity, preserving functions and improving subjects’ quality of life. For this reason, respiratory rehabilitation may be recommended for this category of patients. Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and benefits produced by the adoption of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programs in COVID-19’s post-acute phase. Material and Methods: A search of relevant publications was conducted using the following electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, PEDro, and Cochrane Library. A single reviser selected pertinent articles that studied the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation during COVID-19’s post-acute phase in improving the respiratory function, physical performance, autonomy and quality of life (QoL). Results: After an initial selection, 18 studies were included in this systematic review, of which 14 concern respiratory rehabilitation delivered in conventional form and 4 concern respiratory rehabilitation provided in telehealth. Conclusions: Pulmonary rehabilitation combining different types of training—breathing, aerobic, fitness and strength—and not bypassing the neuropsychological aspects revealed itself to be capable of improving pulmonary and muscular functions, general health and quality of life in post-acute COVID-19 patients, besides increasing workout capacity and muscle strength, improving fatigue states and reducing anxiety and depression.
