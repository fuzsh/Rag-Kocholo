        "text": "This article aims to investigate and explore present rehabilitation technology. Through the accumulated results of this review, we will summarise the support and benefits that the emergence of technologies in medicine provides. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate how patient rehabilitation is evolving compared to traditional rehabilitation. The initial search identified 113 titles in the databases; 18 duplicate articles were removed automatically. The remaining 95 articles were examined by title and abstract, which resulted in the elimination of 59 studies. The full texts of the remaining 36 articles were read and evaluated; nine articles were excluded because they did not satisfy the inclusion criteria established for this study. At the evaluation stage, nine studies were thrown out because they did not fit into the medical fields that the research was looking into or because there was not enough data and information to analyse or rate the results. Other studies were excluded from the full-text evaluation because the study sample was not specified. Technology integration into rehabilitation presents obstacles such as high costs and limited accessibility. Researchers, medicinal professionals, and the technology industry must work together to develop more effective and cost-effective solutions. Nevertheless, these obstacles pale in comparison to the patient benefits of technology. In order to maximise the benefits and surmount the current challenges, it will be necessary to continue the research and development of these technologies in the future.\n\nThis article critically examines the integration of medical devices into physiotherapy, a paradigm shift in rehabilitation methods. Traditionally, physiotherapy has relied on manual techniques and exercise-based interventions. However, the advent of innovative medical devices has begun to transform the field, offering new opportunities for diagnosis, treatment, and patient engagement. This review delves into the historical evolution of physiotherapy, highlighting how technological advancements have been incorporated into practice. The benefits of this integration are explored, emphasizing enhanced diagnostic accuracy, improved treatment outcomes, and increased patient participation. Simultaneously, the article addresses the challenges and criticisms that accompany the use of medical devices in physiotherapy, including technical complexities, ethical concerns, and resistance from traditional practitioners. A comparative analysis between conventional methods and modern, device-integrated approaches is presented, evaluating their effectiveness and impact on patient care. The article also speculates on future developments in physiotherapy, considering the potential of emerging technologies and their implications for healthcare systems. In conclusion, while the integration of medical devices in physiotherapy presents challenges, it also offers significant opportunities for advancing patient care, warranting further exploration and acceptance in mainstream rehabilitation practices.\n\nRehabilitation is placing increasing emphasis on the construct of empowerment as the final goal of any treatment approach. This reflects a shift in focus from deficits and dependence to assets and independence. According to this approach, rehabilitation should aim to improve the quality of the life of the individual by means of effective support to his/her activity and interaction. Here we suggest that advanced technologies can play a significant role in this process."
