Was “Old Town Road” social media entertainment? One answer is an easy no. It may have been released independently, but it was quickly rereleased on a major record label. If that isn’t mass media entertainment, what is? But “Old Town Road” came from somewhere. Lil Nas X spent years refning his social media persona, making memes as a teen, spending time on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. By the time he bought a beat for thirty dollars on the internet, crafed “Old Town Road,” and hyped it through a series of TikTok memes, he already knew how to accrue the kinds of capital that social media value. He’d found the exact balance between being “authentic” and performative that social media audiences desire. He had millions of followers on multiple platforms. His “viral” hit took years of work. His mastery is better understood from a framework of social media entertainment than mass media entertainment. Te success of “Old Town Road” speaks to the liminal status of social media entertainment (for more on liminality, see Elaine Jing Zhao’s contribution in this volume). Its (continually updated re)mix of country, rap, rural, urban, meme, video, and song only hints at the boundary crossing at play in the feld at large. It’s not just genres that are blurring. Social media entertainment, as this volume shows, seems well on its way toward being an industry (or industries?) of its own, yet in many ways it appears as another iteration of (or feeder for) well-established industries. On the one hand, it seems to ofer the radical decentralization that can let a kid from a rural state in the United States achieve international fame through self-produced media. On the other hand, it is increasingly concentrated in a handful of corporations that, like media of old, make money by selling their users to advertisers. vii\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021.

Tis book and its predecessor, Stuart Cunningham and David Craig’s Social Media Entertainment (2019), along with much of the work cited therein, provide a foundation. We can begin to see the actors—human, corporate, and technical—and the connections between them. Tere are the creative workers, a category that belies an extraordinary range of motivations, ambitions, and practices. Tere are audiences, who have relationships not only with creators but with one another and who function as recipients, interlocutors, infuences, antagonists, and products that the creators are able to sell to advertisers (for more on this, see Brooke Erin Dufy and Megan Sawey’s contribution in this volume). Tere are communities, online and of, with their own norms, expectations, and modes of self-regulation. Tere are platforms and the many decision-makers within them, from those deciding business models to those implementing them through algorithms and interfaces and always-fraught content moderation. Tere are the ever-changing algorithms and the interfaces, continuously creating consequences their engineers didn’t anticipate. Tere are the data, some presented as metrics to infuence action, some captured and sold behind the scenes in ways neither creators nor audiences can see, let alone control. Tere are the old media—the record labels, the television stations, the radio, the flm industries, and more, all of which not only persist but exert tremendous regulatory infuence. Tere are new intermediaries, many already having their own rises and falls as mini-industries—the personality curators, the multichannel and multiplatform networks, the Patreons and the Kickstarters. Tere are the brands and the advertisers, still exerting the same infuences that have made creative professions viable while challenging artists’ “authenticity” for generations. Social media entertainment is a world of product placement, of sponsorships, of partnerships, of affliate relationships. Tere are the nations and governments, with their existing policies and laws, striving to fgure out whether and how to regulate this new realm with its slippery boundaries and propensities to make work look like play, to make play into work, and to let intellectual property serve as fodder for others’ creativity. And, of course, there are the billions of media artifacts created and circulated to form\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021.

We can also now start charting the industrial and spatial logics on and within which social media entertainment economies operate. We can begin to see diferent models of production, distribution, work, success, and failure. We can begin comparisons, asking how things work diferently when the genre is (to take a few examples from this book) video book reviews, style blogs, or game commentary. We can begin to compare contexts, from the communities that form around individuals and genres to the regions and nations within and across which they form. Most importantly, we can begin to see the dynamics through which power is exerted and claimed, and it is here where we must be most careful to remember that the approaches we’ve already built in our decades of understanding how media industries operate still provide insightful lenses for critical assessment. We can see how, despite rhetorics of democratization and examples of youths who fnd their way out of poverty through media they create on their phones, success in this realm is still elusive, while its pursuit inevitably benefts those who hold power. We see workers beholden to platforms’ recommendation systems, algorithmic discrimination, and changing afordances, interfaces, and terms of service into which they have little insight, let alone control, while the guilds and unions that helped create acceptable work conditions for their mass-media predecessors struggle to fnd footholds. We see the gendering, as the work of creation is dismissed as trivial, while the coding of the platforms on which the creations circulate is valorized as the skillset to which all would-be workers should aspire. We see how people’s very selves become products in this economy, as, regardless of what they produce, being “authentic” and forming relationships that feel intimate to audiences become germane to making a living (a topic I explore extensively in my book Playing to the Crowd). We see how being “real” can mean becoming a brand that algorithms will fnd legible. Ultimately, we can see how, as currently constructed, social media entertainment serves capitalist logics above and beyond logics of public good. Here, I hope, we will move beyond description and explanation and fnd ways to intervene before this new road takes us back to the same old town.\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021.

These structural changes in the media landscape have, in turn, contributed to the rise of an industry and culture populated by native social media entrepreneurs. Creators can be simply defined in the words of the social media entertainment (SME) thought leader Hank Green (2016) as any creator “making all or part of their living making stuff on the internet, or are working toward that goal.” Te term signifes a distinction from an earlier phase of online content creation characterized by “user-generated content” (UGC). UGC referred to any form of content generated by users of digital platforms, and early scholarly attention rarely entertained the possibility that such activity might give rise to viable entrepreneurial careers. We believe the term creator—which we defne rather more fully than Hank Green as commercializing and professionalizing native social media users who generate and circulate original content in close interaction and engagement with their communities on the major social media platforms as well as ofine—is the term that captures best what is at stake in this book’s mapping of approaches to this emerging culture. Creators are dubbed many things now: infuencers, bloggers and vloggers, gameplayers, livestreamers, camgirls, broadcast jockeys (Korea), and, in China, KOLs (key opinion leaders), zhubo, and wanghong, among others. Tey can be referred to by platform use: YouTubers, tweeters (Twitter), grammers (Instagram), and snappers (Snapchat). Scholars previously coined terms such as “micro-celebrities” (Senf 2008; Abidin 2016), although by now many of these creators have developed greater cultural infuence 1\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021.

Terminological profusion is an index of the increasing importance of this feld of study. Even Hollywood producers, writers, and showrunners routinely refer to themselves as “creators.” Nowadays, some of these terms have gone completely viral. Martha Lincoln (@heavyredaction) tweeted apropos an encounter in a classroom, “A student has just astonished me by writing ‘Infuencers such as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.’” Te creator culture that this volume seeks to defne and investigate draws on a range of scholarship in media and communication studies, science and technology studies, and social media, internet, and platform studies. We mapped its industrial dimensions in Social Media Entertainment: The New Industry at the Intersection of Hollywood and Silicon Valley (Cunningham and Craig 2019). Tere, we traced the emergence of a phenomenon emerging outside broadcasting and the digital streaming platforms (for example, Netfix, Amazon Prime Video, iQiyi, and Hotstar). Rather, these creators are native to social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitch, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and their Chinese counterparts Youku, Weibo, and WeChat. Conditions of labor are volatile and precarious but also more empowered, in contrast to early careerists in Hollywood and the media industries. SME also represented a signifcant space for new, and much more diverse, voices with the means for cultural assertion as much as commercial media production. Combined, these factors generated a diferent globalization dynamic that has scaled with great velocity, enabling multimodal content (posts, vlogs, tweets, grams, snaps, and streams) to travel the world without conventional intellectual property (IP) control and posing new challenges for established media companies and regulatory regimes. In this introduction, we elaborate briefy on the industrial underpinnings and global dimensions of creator culture and then introduce the chapters to follow. Te development of creator culture will have reached the ffeen-year mark by 2021, starting with the launch of YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook and their Chinese counterparts around 2005. YouTube has been a critical platform for creators, particularly afer acquisition in 2006 by Google, introducing features and services that empowered, and ofen inhibited, creators, but always in service of the shifing interests of the plat-\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021.

A short list includes content management systems, programmatic advertising, partnership agreements, programmable channels, mobility, subscription platforms, community pages, ecommerce and merchandise integrations, online mobile payment systems, and livestreaming. Tere are similar stories of strong growth of native content creation on platforms such as Twitch, Instagram, Facebook, and even Twitter. Te reality is multiplatform for most creators, although the materiality of platform afordances generates real diferences in practice: an Instagram beauty vlogger is diferent from a YouTube content creator, as is a Twitch gameplayer, a Snap storyteller, or a Momo showroom host. In turn, the commercializing practices of creators operating in this industry refect a diverse portfolio of revenue streams across platforms, in established media as well as of media. Vital to our understanding is that these conditions extend across all social media platforms, many of which have integrated comparable forms of modality (video), monetization (programmatic advertising), and partnership agreements with their native creators. China’s alternative creator industry is a wild card that may upset the accepted understanding of the way cultural infuence fows globally. Wanghong means “popular online” or “internet famous” and carries connotations that can embrace the entire industry or refer to celebritization as a problematic process, as well as describing the specifc subcomponent of Chinese creator culture on livestreaming platforms. China’s industry features a highly competitive platform landscape, incubated through regulatory protection and fueled by a rising middle class, and ofers more diverse and potentially lucrative opportunities for creators than its Western counterparts. When wanghong makes the leap past the Great Chinese Firewall, Western entertainment hegemony may be imperiled. And there are vibrant creator cultures in numerous places around the world that are little beholden to face-ofs with old Western hegemons or, for that matter, emerging Eastern ones.\n\nStudying the Social Media Entertainment Industry “Does the world really need one more field of study?” Jennifer Holt and Alisa Perren (2009) ask this question in introducing their field-setting volume Media Industries: History, Theory, and Method. Our answer\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press. All rights reserved.\n\n4\n\n| Stuart Cunningham and David Craig\n\nwould be that as industries and cultures change, so fields of study need to change. Creator Culture: An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment introduces readers to “ways of seeing” social media entertainment from perspectives that critically assess claims for its relation to, yet differentiation from, well-established media forms and institutions traditionally within scope for media studies, as well as differentiation from the agendas now established within social media studies. This volume does not seek to impose a uniform perspective; rather, our goal is to stimulate in-depth, globally focused engagement with this industry and establish a dynamic research agenda attractive to scholars, teachers, and students, as well as to creators and media professionals across the media, communication, and social media industries. Te scholarly foundations of the volume draw on diverse, interrelated disciplines, theories, analytic frameworks, and methodologies. Holt and Perren, in looking to defne media industries studies, argued that the feld relied on knowledge generated in cultural and creative industries, mass communication, sociology and anthropology, media economics and industrial analysis, political economy and cultural studies, journalism, flm and TV studies, and cultural policy. Together with these infuences, we suggest that studying the creator culture developed by social media entertainment requires disciplinary input from internet studies, social media studies, and science and technology studies. Tere are many productive diferences in approach and perspective in the chapters to follow. But what everyone agrees on is that social media entertainment (or whatever contributors call it) is a thing. But what sort of the thing is it? Is it an industry? And, if so, what kind of an industry? Nitin Govil poses an interesting question of great relevance to our project when he notes that “most studies proceed from a general understanding of what an industry comprises, with a tacit sense of its boundaries and capacities.” One of the “entrenched yet under examined presumptions” of studies of media industries is the “obviousness of its object” (Govil 2013, 173). Govil attributes the fact that the Indian flm industry was fnally granted ofcial industry status by government only afer decades of lobbying principally to the lack of reliable statistical data. An industry that innovatively made the most of its informality had ultimately to embrace formalization to advance. Popular and political ambivalence about the industry had to give way in order for it to be\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n5\n\nplaced on proper legal and fnancial footing. Govil argues that “we need to broaden the range of practices that count as industrial” and that we need “a more dynamic sense of industries as social and textual arrangements . . . and other dramaturgies of interaction, refection, and refexivity” (176). In this spirit, we posit three basic criteria for considering SME as an industry: size and scope, diferentiation from neighboring industries, and degree of formalization. Gaining authoritative, independent data on the scale and economic value that platforms and creators derive from SME is almost impossible at this stage of its evolution as an industry. And any data that can be derived will date quickly, given that growth year on year in these early growth stages is remarkable and remarkably global. Data that are made available are mostly from single platforms, whereas creators’ revenue sources typically involve multiple platforms and strategies including crowdfunding, licensing, and direct brand deal making. Platforms have more than one revenue stream from which creators may or may not beneft, but publicly revealing the full story would risk fights of, and fghts between, creators and expose platforms’ accounting practices. It is always better, think platforms, to impose nondisclosure agreements and deal separately or even purely algorithmically with creators. YouTube’s referencing of creator statistics is classic “spin.” A typical statement from Google CEO Sundar Pichai in 2019 touted the everincreasing monetization opportunities that YouTube provides for creators. “Te number of channels with more than 1 million subscribers doubled in 2018,” he said, “and the number of creators earning between $10,000 and $1 million from YouTube AdSense grew 40% year-overyear. (Currently, there are upwards of 5,000 channels with at least 1 million subscribers.)” (Weiss 2019). (Tat fgure had grown to more than 16,000 in late 2019.) Who qualifes to be a “partner” has changed semiregularly, programmatic advertising revenue splits vary between “premium” and “nonpremium” creators, and YouTube has introduced new revenue sources: subscriptions, memberships, e-commerce, and virtual goods. Compared to other platforms’ public accounting of creator practice, however, YouTube is relatively transparent. Another exception to the deep opaqueness may be Amazon-owned Twitch. Its platform blog ofers explicit dollar fgures for aspiring Twitch partners and de-\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021.

Attempts to track economic value across multiple platforms and allied funding sources are legion but almost always unverifable and must be taken under advisement, as they usually come from vested advertising and marketing interests. Business journalists’ accounts of the “infuencer economy” vary from $1 billion in 2018 (Adweek 2019) to $10 billion in 2020 (National Public Radio 2019). Researchers wanting to dig deeper into such fgures would need to ask if they are limited to infuencer marketing without programmatic advertising, focused exclusively on the brand-rich environment of Instagram only, and limited to the advertising verticals of beauty and lifestyle alone. It is possibly even more difcult to be assured of data clarity in China’s alternative creator universe. Te “wanghong economy,” according to industry data frms like CBNData, may have eclipsed China’s flm industry at near US$10 billion in 2016 and was worth US$15 billion a year later (Asia Pacifc 2018). Or this could even be the “$24 billion Chinese industry you’ve never heard of ” (Youmshajekian 2019). Te value proposition that third-party data frms such as Social Blade, Tubeflter, and Captive8 ofer to the industry is to combine data across platforms and revenue portfolios and package such information as the basis for creators’ sales strategies for securing paying customers. However, their estimates are limited without direct access to creators’ platform application programming interfaces (APIs), which are repositories of more sophisticated measures such as indicators of “engagement.” According to Social Blade, the leading DIY beauty vlogger and queer political activist Ingrid Nilsen makes between $155 and $2,500 a month, $2,000 to $30,000 a year, but none of these data points recognizes her multiyear “glambassadorships” with the likes of Clairol or bareMinerals, which are almost certainly orders of magnitude greater than these fgures. For nearly a decade, Forbes has tracked the highest paid infuencers, creators, and YouTubers via a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, in partnership with social insight frms, across multiple platform data sources, coupled with economic assessments of endorsements and ofine businesses. In 2011, Forbes generated a list of the top “social\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021.

By 2017, Forbes’s list had grown to over one hundred “infuencers” across multiple platforms and content verticals like pets, ftness, and gaming; the list was to be published quarterly (O’Connor 2017). Forbes’s eforts proved unsustainable. Its 2019 list was reduced to the top ten “YouTube Stars,” led by eight-year-old Ryan Kaji of Ryan’s World, with $26 million in revenue, based on “data from Captiv8, SocialBlade, and Pollstar as well as interviews with industry stars” (Berg 2019). Te dramatic changes in method and outcome in these lists refect the difcult conditions under which scholars and students must work to assess the scale and economic value of the industry. Creator advocates have also invested resources seeking to infuence political and policy understanding about the scale and scope of the industry on a (US) state-by-state basis. America’s New Creative Economy is a US-centric analysis of the creator economy funded by the Re:Create Coalition—a creator-focused NGO—prepared by a team of economists. While the lead economist informed us that the report is full of “heroic assumptions” (Shapiro 2018), nonetheless, the report suggests that upward of 10 percent of the US labor force is making some form of revenue by harnessing social media platforms (Shapiro with Aneja 2018). Te second report, published in 2019, revealed sustainable growth of creator income at a rate of more than 17 percent per year and growth to more than $1 billion in the size of this economy (Shapiro with Aneja 2019). (We revisit the Re:Create Coalition in chapter 14.) Comparing and differentiating SME from neighboring industrial formations is a constant challenge, as it morphs rapidly. Its history, as we see it (and as set out in Cunningham and Craig 2019, 37–62), shows three distinct phases. Its frst phase begins centrally with YouTube providing open access to share content and foster community, thus distinguishing itself from digital TV portals. A distinct second phase is marked by the increased competition from second-generation platforms and the rise of multiplatforming. Tese were the “New Tubes” consolidated, acquired, internally launched, and feature-enhanced by the SME majors, Google/ YouTube, Facebook/Instagram, Twitter/Periscope/Vine, Amazon/ Twitch, and Snapchat. In turn, this enhanced platform landscape fos-\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\n8\n\n| Stuart Cunningham and David Craig\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press. All rights reserved.\n\ntered new types of creators (for example, Snappers, Grammers, Viners). We are now in a third phase, arguably marked by the “Adpocalypse” in 2017 and the increased challenges confronting creators as the platforms face a rapidly growing crisis of governance, frst in the European Union, then in other jurisdictions, and now increasingly in the United States. Te 2019 backlash toward child creators was deemed the “second Adpocalypse,” signaling, for some observers, that the “Golden Age of YouTube is over” (Alexander 2020). In our previous work on the subject, we say, “Vital to grasping the signifcance of SME is understanding how social media entertainment platforms operated as both content delivery systems and networked communication technology” (Cunningham and Craig 2019, 32). SME creator culture is being developed and practiced at the intersection of the digital and the social, the interpersonal and the mass, and established and emerging media industries, and studying it means drawing on several disciplinary traditions, as we aim to show in this book. SME is both a content and a communication industry; creators both produce and distribute content and manage communities. Nancy Baym makes clear with respect to the broader phenomenon of new media that they blur boundaries between established communication subdisciplines (interpersonal, group, mass) as well as blurring the linear conception in mass communication media of one-to-many production-reception: One of the most exciting elements of new media is that they allow us to communicate personally within what used to be prohibitively large groups. Tis blurs the boundary between mass and interpersonal communication in ways that disrupt both. When people gather online to talk about a television show they are a mass communication audience, but the communication they have with one another is both interpersonal, directed to individuals within the group, and mass, available for anyone to read. If, as increasingly happens, conversations and materials these fans produce for one another are incorporated into the television show, the boundaries between the production and reception of mass media are blurred as well. (2015, 4)\n\nWe have distinguished SME from mass-media frameworks and mainstream screen industries in our previous work (Cunningham and Craig\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n9\n\n2019, 8–15). Tere, we stress the diferences between the “born digital,” “network native,” and “mobile friendly” social platforms on which SME operates, on the one hand, and traditional media, on the other. We point to the pro-am status of the SME creator, the new genres and formats invented, the open intellectual property protocols under which it circulates globally, and the centrality of community development and maintenance as the core work in creator culture. From the perspective of the interpersonal (and group) communication subdisciplines, SME can be viewed from the perspective of the perceived elitism of mass media and its “powerful subversion”: “the gatekeeping function of mass media is challenged as individuals use digital media to spread messages much further and more widely than was ever historically possible” (Baym 2015, 11). Just as synchronous personto-person and small-group communication developed early in the internet’s history (Baym 2015, 15), so the video log, or vlog, was, and has continued to be, fundamental to the early commercial internet and to SME. Te centrality of livestreaming to contemporary SME reafrms communication as much as content defnes creator culture. As we outline in the concluding chapter of this book, much scholarship has focused on the downsides of formalization of previously amateur content-production culture on social media platforms. (Chapters 5, 9, and 12 also engage with issues of industry formalization.) Instead, we argue there that SME has developed rapidly and that its current shape and future prospects require greater attention to industrial formalization. As we have just seen, one of the key distinguishing features of SME is the (previously) amateur status of creator culture. Tis has made SME one of the outstanding examples of what Ramon Lobato and Julian Tomas (2015) stress are the innovations that informal media practices have contributed to the institutionalized media industries. A formalizing industry that begins to regulate itself efectively and accepts, where appropriate, the necessity of state regulation is a sign of a maturing industry advancing from its days as the “Wild West” (Mann 2014). As Govil reminds us, one of the key dynamics that inhibit the advance of an industry through appropriate formalization is the degree of acceptance of its bona fdes in popular opinion and by the state. Critical scholarship can support this recognition and thus the sustainability of creator culture.\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\n10\n\n|\n\nStuart Cunningham and David Craig\n\nThe Chapters to Come The purpose of this book is to provide resources for understanding, studying, and researching creator cultures in the emerging industry of social media entertainment. We have organized the chapters under three broad heuristic domains, or approaches, through which readers can make sense of the formation of creator cultures in this new industry configuration and the theoretical, methodological, cultural, social, textual, policy, and political issues it raises. These approaches—“Frameworks and Methods,” “Genres and Communities,” and “Industries and Governance”—form the part structure of the book. Readers will find that there are inevitable and productive cross-referencing of these approaches within many of the chapters. As we introduce the contributing chapters here, we also suggest many links between and across these domains that will encourage you to explore deeper into the field and “connect the dots.”\n\nCopyright © 2021.

In part 1, several frameworks and methods are explored. Chapter 1, by Jean Burgess, introduces platform studies, establishing the importance of platforms to creator culture and giving an overview of the platformization of the web, the consequences for media power, and the sometimes supportive, ofen adversarial, but always political, relations between creators and platforms. It then gives an overview of the feld of platform studies before discussing three distinctive but complementary approaches to researching platforms in general and YouTube in particular. Tese approaches are characterized by critical and qualitative perspectives on issues such as the role of algorithms, computational digital methods using platform APIs, and hybrid methods such as the “app walkthrough.” Te chapter concludes with some guidelines on the way these methods can be combined to help empower creator communities by enhancing and amplifying their knowledge of how platforms work.\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021.

However, feminist YouTube creators have to navigate what are ofen contradictory pressures in order to gain visibility and earn a living, such as appealing to commercial brands while maintaining their political integrity and cultivating authenticity with their audiences. Te work of feminist content creators on YouTube is complex, and so a reductive explanatory frame is resisted. With the analytic of productive ambivalence, this chapter aims to complicate the dominance of popular feminism online by asking, to what extent are professional YouTube content creators able to present more radical versions of feminism or else pushed to ft into neoliberal brand culture in order to gain visibility and income? In chapter 3, Brent Luvaas discusses the afordances and limitations of autoethnography as a method of social media research. Describing his own experiences as a street style blogger, the chapter introduces the experiential modes of data gathering that autoethnography enables as well as the emotional toll that such methodologies can infict. Autoethnography provides embodied ways of knowing that no other form of social scientifc research can provide. But it also entails afective and existential risk. Becoming what we study is a process not easily undone. And it is one whose ending is not easy to predict. As Luvaas was becoming a blogger, bloggers were becoming something else: social media “infuencers” who leverage their personal brands across platforms. To perpetuate his blog, he had to become an infuencer too, an identity about which he remained deeply ambivalent. Carlos A. Scolari, Damián Fraticelli, and José M. Tomasena, in chapter 4, produce a case study of a SME genre rarely discussed: book reviewers on YouTube (“BookTubers”). Te case study traces the progressive professionalization of Spanish-language BookTubers and their battles with the book industry while at the same time engaging in a mas-\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\n12\n\n| Stuart Cunningham and David Craig\n\nCopyright © 2021.

Good examples of discourse analysis of creator production to compare and contrast with this chapter can be found in chapters 2, 7, 9, and 10. Critical media industry studies (CMIS) is a middle-range approach that seeks to account for both structure and agency, power and resistance, in media industries. Using CMIS as a framework, chapter 5, by David Craig, Stuart Cunningham, and Junyi Lv, adopts a creator-centric optic to illustrate the interdependencies among industrial, social, technological and economic, and political vectors in Chinese livestreaming. As a state-protected and surveilled industry, China’s livestreaming has more genres, revenue models, and participation compared with Western formats. Te authors fnd highly advanced e-commerce integration on platforms that have underpinned livestreamers’ economic sustainability. However, this enhanced sustainability has to be placed against the social and political precarity of the ever-present possibility of state action upholding “social morality.” Chapters in this section (and elsewhere) are careful to highlight the range of methods used to research SME and creator culture: document analysis, interviewing, and textual and discourse analysis are commonly used methods, but we also encounter ethnographic, autoethnographic, and computational digital methods as well as hybrid critical and qualitative methods such as the app walkthrough.\n\nGenres and Communities Apart from this section’s treatment of major SME genres gameplay, fashion and lifestyle, and toy unboxing, you will find analysis of other genres elsewhere in the book: book reviewing in chapter 4, livestreaming in chapter 5. Comedy, satire and prank formats are discussed in this section in chapters 9 and 10. Hector Postigo’s chapter 6 notes that scholars of media industries and other creative cultures have ofen reported research fndings through the lenses of qualitative data (interviews and participant observation), interpretation, and analysis. Tis chapter describes immersive research methods that Postigo used while studying creative communities on YouTube. But the chapter sits in this section because it also gives us one of the richest—dare we say, most authentic—accounts of the sheer skill,\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n13\n\ncommitment, and hard work demanded of creators in the genre of video gameplay commentary (one of the core SME genres). Postigo also says that the chapter yields fndings and methods that are transferable to studying other creator communities. Te chapter explores the concept of “authenticity” as a useful (or not) heuristic for understanding what exactly creative communities, like the one featured in this chapter, are trying to portray as they present themselves and their products to audiences. Chapters 3 and 6 make a compelling duet regarding the power and challenge of ethnographic method. Brooke Erin Dufy and Megan Sawey look at Instagram content creators and their main genre, fashion and lifestyle. Teir chapter 7 shifs the conceptual focus of social media infuence from labor to service. Instagram-based infuencers are beholden to three distinctive groups— audiences, advertisers, and the wider creator community—that exert competing demands on their time, energy, and creative output. Afer exploring how the provision of service to these groups shapes the cultural experiences and valuations of infuencers on Instagram, Dufy and Sawey ultimately locate the power in the hands of the platform itself. It is instructive to compare this account of creator agency with the strongly positive account in chapter 10 and the analytic of “productive ambivalence” advanced in chapter 2. Jarrod Walczer, in chapter 8, studies the way toy unboxing creator communities have survived the ElsaGate scandal and KidPocalypse of 2017 (in which trusted children’s brands were spoofed, satirized, and subverted on YouTube with much panic and scrutiny). To do this, they have had to self-organize and more radically brand themselves as progressive purveyors of quality YouTube-native content for kids. Nevertheless, questions remain as to whether these creator-centric communities are just a second coming of old-style multichannel networks. Tis chapter profles both pocket.watch and Family Video Network, asking whether these new organizations are bent on proftability and mass acquisition or whether they represent a new type of community-management and creator-governance formation. Creators seeking to take greater control over the volatile platform environments they work in through selfgovernance is a theme also taken up in chapter 14. Te creator cultures forming around social media entertainment are thoroughly global, regional, and nationally specifc in extent and diver-\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\n14\n\n|\n\nStuart Cunningham and David Craig\n\nsity. Chapter 9, by Sangeet Kumar, Sriram Mohan, and Aswin Punathambekar, insists on a regional frame “beyond the nation” as the primary organizing category for the production and circulation of SME culture. In the peninsular region of South India, there is a well-entrenched Hindi-Urdu circuit of cultural exchange between India and Pakistan on YouTube that has advanced a “regional imaginary,” ofen based on afnities of language, cultural idioms, and social similitude, and has enabled dialogue and cultural exchange across fractious national borders. Mohamed El Marzouki maps the feld of creator culture in the Middle East and North Africa in chapter 10. He begins by outlining social, political, and technological developments that furnished the conditions of possibility for the rise of youth digital media culture across the Arab world, including the deteriorating socioeconomic conditions of youth in light of decades of political authoritarianism and state monopolies on media and cultural institutions. Te chapter examines the political purchase of youth digital media culture in relation to the online and ofine microeconomic processes and monetization schemes that young social media creators engage in to sustain their digital media ventures.\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nIndustries and Governance In chapter 11, Elaine Jing Zhao exemplifies how a focus on creator culture can illuminate and ground an industrial framework. As the internet opens up pathways to fame and notoriety in an environment of supercharged transformation, wanghong (internet famous) has become arguably even more of a cultural and socioeconomic phenomenon in China than elsewhere and constitutes a rapidly growing part of Chinese social media entertainment. The chapter critically examines wanghong through multiple layers of liminality: between the professional and amateur, between authenticity and performance, between public and private, and between being celebrated and being disciplined. The theme of creator labor is a constant in the book, and you will encounter it in several chapters; the specificity of China is also considered in chapter 5. Chapter 12 is a study of the industrial culture of Chilean advertising as it is changing to accommodate SME creators. Deploying the Bourdieusian notion of cultural feld, Arturo Arriagada argues that creators and advertising agencies work together as dual markets within the industry.\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n15\n\nTese markets can be approached as a feld where actors compete to legitimize their forms of knowledge, expertise, and taste classifcations for the promotion of brands and products. Creators and advertising agencies appear to have a mutually constitutive infuence: while creators challenge the power of advertisers by confguring a type of labor, based on knowledge of platforms and promotion, that validates the online content-creation economy, advertisers must accommodate and learn to respect creator authenticity as the basis for extracting value from their relationships with follower communities. In chapter 13, Jeremy Shtern and Stephanie Hill place social media content creators in a historical frame and under the scrutiny of political economy. Te return to sponsorship as a popular model of funding social media entertainment revives a controversial media monetization practice that previously jeopardized consumer trust in advertising and attracted scrutiny from both the public and regulatory agents from as early as the 1930s. Tis chapter considers sponsored social media content in this historical context, examining how it creates power for advertisers by commodifying social media audiences and analyzing the ways in which media policy and industry regulation currently provide oversight. Te extent to which the viability of creator culture hinges on consumer trust, and how efective government and industry standards act as guarantor, quality assurer, and occasional regulator of trustworthiness, is at issue. Shtern and Hill’s approach to advertising and to regulation can be proftably compared to those in chapters 12 and 14, respectively. Stuart Cunningham and David Craig, in chapter 14, ofer a creatorcentric account of industrial, governance, and rights issues in SME. Social media entertainment is characterized by what appears as a gross power asymmetry between platforms and creators: world-leading and globe-spanning hegemonic organizations, weak intermediary structures, and a “workforce” that is young, globally dispersed, and composed of mostly sole traders. However, this chapter, theoretically framed by a Foucauldian understanding of power as relational and contingent and insights from network economics, suggests a more supple account of power and some progress in collective action and advocacy in the representation of creator rights. Te interests of creators are examined in the “top-down” context of the exercise of platform governance and efforts, by platforms and the state, to improve it. Tose interests are also\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\n16\n\n| Stuart Cunningham and David Craig\n\ncanvassed from the “bottom up”—how creators and creator advocacy are organizing and acting collectively to improve prospects for creators in this emerging industry.\n\nCopyright © 2021.

The pandemic has killed hundreds of thousands, wreaked economic havoc, and heightened political unrest, leaving our lives quarantined and social practices virtualized. Traditional media industries are both reeling and benefiting from such huge disruption. Live entertainment, theatrical distribution, theme parks, and scripted production are shuttered, while streaming video portals and online video games proliferate as vital services to locked-down populations across the globe. The SME industry has been boosted as audiences crowd online; chapter 5, for example, notes that China’s wanghong industry has become a vital engine for sustaining the growth of China’s digital economy. This book, introducing the emerging field of studies of creator culture in the SME industry, is supremely timely. As creator cultures evolve by responding during and after this crisis, the work we present here analyzes, questions, and contextualizes, while fundamentally registering the importance of, an emerging industry with digital participation and citizenship at its core.

From the 2010s on, online creators and communities have become increasingly dependent on a relatively small number of digital media platforms (or, in Chinese, ping tai), which are in turn owned by some of the largest companies in the world. The social media entertainment industry (Cunningham and Craig 2019) is coextensive and symbiotic with these proprietary platforms. The biggest players include Google and YouTube (owned by Alphabet), Tencent Video and WeChat (owned by Tencent), iQiyi (controlled by Baidu), Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram (owned by Facebook), and Facebook itself. They are all part of a commercial digital media ecosystem that is also populated by visual blogging platforms like Tumblr, livestreaming platforms like Twitch, short-video entertainment platforms like TikTok, and a plethora of niche content and crowdfunding platforms like Patreon. No doubt by the time you read this book there will be many new players, and some of the existing ones may well have departed the scene. With regard to technology, this platform-centered situation is a signifcant shif away from the relatively decentralized online ecosystem that characterized the Western digital media of the late 1990s through to the middle of the frst decade of this century, in which a variety of competing social networking services and DIY websites or blogs coexisted on a single, shared platform (the World Wide Web), built in turn on the public internet. Today, the most powerful digital media platforms are far more likely to run on their own, relatively closed quasi-operating systems, which tend to be used not on the open 21 Creator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021.

Tis dramatic shif is a consequence of what has been called platformization, defned by Anne Helmond as “the rise of the platform as the dominant infrastructural and economic model of the social web” (2015, 1), a rise that was achieved by extending the reach of and connections between social media platforms and by creating data fows and interfaces with other websites. It is through this process that a handful of companies have been able to diversify their services while concentrating their economic and cultural power over the internet. It is no exaggeration, for example, to say that in much of the world, Facebook has built a proprietary network of applications, data, and advertising that exists parasitically on top of the public internet. Te Chinese platformed digital media environment has developed largely in parallel to and apart from the global internet and has its own distinctive characteristics and modes of governance (Wang and Lobato 2019). But platformization goes beyond the internet and social media— indeed, much of the media and cultural environment now operates under a “platform paradigm” (Burgess 2015). As David Nieborg and Tomas Poell argue, platformization has resulted in “the penetration of economic, governmental, and infrastructural extensions of digital platforms into the web and app ecosystems” (2018, 4276) and hence into other industry sectors that rely on the web, especially the creative and cultural industries. In using the term platform paradigm, I mean not only that platforms like YouTube or Facebook have a lot of power within the information sector and creative content industries but also that their logics—their ways of operating and their systems of value— are more deeply reshaping our society and culture. Here I draw on José van Dijck and Poell’s (2013) idea of “social media logics,” in turn built on David Altheide and Robert Snow’s (1979) concept of “media logic,” defned by van Dijck and Poell as “a set of principles or commonsense rationality cultivated in and by media institutions that penetrates every public domain and dominates its organizing structures” (2013, 3). Van Dijck and Poell identify four principles for social media logics: programmability, popularity, connectivity, and datafcation. While all four of these principles or logics are relevant to content creators, of particular relevance to the rise of platforms is datafication—the extraction and collection of digital traces of cul-\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021.

Tese data are exploited and shared, not only internally by single platforms like Facebook and YouTube, but also across a far more extensive ecosystem of social media companies, advertisers, and third-party intermediaries. Metrics based on these data—measures of audience engagement compared across content items, for example— can in turn shape the activities of media organizations and content creators. In the context of news, recent research has explored how mainstream news organizations are transforming in response to the social media metrics on which they increasingly depend, in a process of “institutional isomorphism” (Caplan and boyd 2018). Tis process of institutional isomorphism is leading, among other things, to the new forms of explicitly social-media-centered journalism associated with outlets like BuzzFeed and Junkee (Hurcombe, Burgess, and Harrington 2018). I discuss later in this chapter how creators have played a major role in building the cultures and audiences of platforms, but it is also true that platforms have the power to make or break the careers of creators. Platform logics shape what counts as value (for example, in the form of audience attention or engagement) and how that value is measured (whether by clicks, subscriptions, watch time, or a combination of these). Platforms convert those measurements into semiautomated decisions about which content is pushed to audiences and the extent to which that content can attract advertising revenue. In order to maintain high levels of visibility, creators have to work out how to engage with each platform’s features, policies, audience analytics, and data tools. As well, they must understand how a platform’s various automated and semiautomated protocols for content presentation, curation, and moderation (ofen referred to by creators and commentators as “the algorithm”) afect how likely audiences are to encounter and engage with their work. In Crystal Abidin’s (2016) research with Singaporean infuencers on Instagram, for example, she discusses this work of optimizing for visibility as “visibility labour.” Tese symbiotic, afective, and ofen fraught relationships with platforms, data, and metrics are particularly signifcant for those creators whose activities are centered on a particular platform (for example, those who identify as YouTubers) as well as for those for whom social\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021.

Platforms, then, are powerful cultural shapers, and the workings of platforms are of material concern and intense interest to creators; but their architectures and operations are difcult to observe. Platforms also play a major role in governing the forms of creativity and social interaction that take place through them. Tey set rules about what content and behavior are allowed, even amplifed, and what content and behavior are not allowed or discouraged. Tey enforce and change these rules through a variety of technical and policy measures, for reasons that are not always explained and that do not always seem fair to creators and user communities (Gillespie 2018; Suzor 2019). Meanwhile, creators are busy interpreting, adapting to, and in some cases deliberately subverting and gaming these platform rules and their various mechanisms of enforcement. Te other side of the story is that platforms are also partly built, shaped, and infuenced by creator communities and the various creative practices and social norms they have developed. In fact, many of the features and conventions of social media platforms were collectively created by users and only later implemented by the platform. In YouTube, the vlog format, video replies, and hyperlinking between videos and channels are early examples (see Burgess and Green 2018); for Twitter, it is the hashtag, retweet, and reply feature (Burgess and Baym 2020). As other contributions to this volume show, while we cannot understand the dynamics of labor or content governance in creator cultures without taking platform power into account, creator communities are themselves by necessity very actively engaged in debates, discussions, and peer education about the hidden workings of the platforms on which their cultural practice—and, especially in the case of social media “entertainers,” their livelihoods—depend. Additionally, while the platform paradigm and its accompanying logics are general tendencies, not all platforms are the same. Te designs and features of particular platforms difer in important ways, and so too do the cultures of use (the social norms and creative conventions) that have come to be associated with each of them. We\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press.

Tese diferences between platform cultures are the result of the coevolution of particular user populations (with diferent combinations of ages, geographies, and identities), platforms’ business models (their ways of operating and generating revenue), and platforms’ afordances (their features and the practices these features invite). Twitter started as a geeky personal-statusupdate tool built for mobile and evolved into a global platform for news and debate, but its feature set has always focused primarily on text, news, and conversation; Instagram started out as a hip, mobile photography app and became a favored social platform for a diverse and global community of visual communicators. Tis particularity of platforms is why digital media scholars do not usually (or should not) discuss social media culture in general but instead work carefully to closely observe the distinctive cultures and conventions—the “platform vernaculars” (Gibbs et al. 2015)—of Twitter or of Instagram or of YouTube. To study creator cultures in digital media, then, is also inevitably to study how platforms work, how creator communities are shaped by or work with their specifc architectures, interfaces, and afordances, and how these creator communities in turn infuence, negotiate, and resist platform cultures. Focusing particularly on YouTube, the remainder of this chapter provides an overview of platform studies approaches, a detailed discussion of how such approaches can be used to study platformbased creator cultures, and some guidelines on how these methods can be combined to help empower creator communities by enhancing and amplifying their knowledge of how platforms work.\n\nCritical and Qualitative Approaches to Platform Studies Platform studies is an umbrella term for holistic approaches to those entities that are understood and represent themselves as digital media\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press. All rights reserved.\n\n26\n\n| Jean Burgess\n\nplatforms. Platform studies concern the technologies, interfaces, and affordances, ownership structures, business models, media- and selfrepresentations, and governance of these entities, positioning these elements in a coevolutionary relationship with the platform’s diverse cultures of use (for an extended example applied to Twitter, see Burgess and Baym 2020).1 Of course, even the labeling of entities like YouTube or Facebook or WhatsApp as platforms should be approached critically. As Tarleton Gillespie (2010) has so clearly shown, the power of the concept lies in its multivalence, or multiple meanings. Tat is, platforms are both computational architectures on which features and services (including advertising as well as third-party apps) can be built and discursive spaces for cultural expression and audience engagement. Exploiting these multiple meanings, the companies that own the platforms are able to appeal simultaneously to multiple sets of stakeholders, even those whose interests are not aligned—ofering value to advertisers, entertainment to audiences, and infrastructures and audiences to creators, while representing themselves to regulators as neutral intermediaries—as technology companies rather than media publishers (Napoli and Caplan 2017). Tese contradictory discursive appeals to diverse stakeholders reveal the struggles between competing interests within platform companies and user cultures—struggles in which the most actively involved creators are both literate and highly invested. Tere is also a growing number of book-length scholarly works that take particular platforms as their objects of analysis and take quite a holistic approach. Te Polity Press series Digital Media and Society is the source of several rich examples, including Instagram (Leaver, Highfeld, and Abidin 2019), Twitter (Murthy 2018), and my own book on YouTube (Burgess and Green 2009, 2018). In the study that led to that latter book, Joshua Green and I brought together media discourse analysis, document analysis of the YouTube company and platform itself, and an empirical exercise that, with the aid of a basic web scraper, collected thousands of videos and used them to explore the results and shaping efect of YouTube’s metrics of popularity. Using this video corpus as a base, we were able to use YouTuber video testimony to investigate how creators were engaging in debate and activism with respect to the platform’s emerging cultural economy. We could already see how creators\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nPlatform Studies\n\n| 27\n\nwere inventing new genres (from YouTube Poop to reaction videos), debating future directions (like YouTube’s partner program and deals with mainstream media), and contesting norms (whether to fan fame wars or to promote a more supportive participatory culture on the platform). In short, we saw how they, alongside the developing businesses of online video and internet advertising, were shaping and contesting YouTube’s distinctive creator cultures and user conventions—its platform vernaculars (Gibbs et al. 2015). Given the increased role of automation and data-driven systems in platform operations as well as advertising and their role in defning and extracting value, platform studies also increasingly incorporates various critical approaches to platform protocols and algorithms. Karin van Es’s theoretically driven forensic examination of the category of the “view” in the YouTube attention economy establishes that, “although content on YouTube is measured in various ways (through clicks and other forms of engagement), it is monetized through views” (2020, 234). Although “the view interconnects YouTube, advertisers, creators, and MCNs,” van Es argues, “it is YouTube that decides how to count views and which content to monetize”: “advertisers, creators, and MCNs have rather limited means to hold YouTube accountable for its procedures” (234–235). Van Es concludes that the view “helps to legitimize hierarchies on the YouTube platform,” and “these hierarchies concern, and impact, participation, fnancial compensation, visibility, and popularity” (235). Sophie Bishop (2018) has drawn on Taina Bucher (2017) and others to critically examine YouTube’s algorithms and their impact on creators (in this case, infuencers). Bishop very usefully outlines the two, intertwined approaches necessary to understand this aspect of how platforms shape culture: frst, “what algorithms are doing” and, second, “what content creators think an algorithm is doing, that is to say, how YouTubers believe the YouTube recommendation algorithm operates,” and thereby “how perceptions of its value systems are consciously or unconsciously incorporated into vlogging practices” (2018, 73). Bishop (2018) examines YouTube’s algorithmic logics of visibility, arguing that the platform works actively to make the vast proportion of its diverse content less visible. Connecting this approach with creator experiences, Bishop (2019) has also explored how vernacular understandings and public discourses about the YouTube algorithm, which she calls “algorithmic gossip,” work\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press. All rights reserved.\n\n28\n\n| Jean Burgess\n\nto shape individual creator “self-optimizing” practices and collective creator culture. As Bishop’s work shows, incorporating creator knowledges and experiences into platform studies is important, because their practices are visible and can be highly infuential, not only over other users but also over the platforms themselves. Bucher provides a concrete example of this in her study of the YouTube Reply Girls, “a group of young women who rose to a brief moment of YouTube fame in 2012 for using their cleavage-baring bodies as thumbnails to drive trafc” (2018, 127). Tis technique worked for a brief period of YouTube’s history, when one of the platform’s features was the ability to create video responses, thumbnails of which would appear on the website in the right-hand column, alongside the original video. While video replies originated as a social networking and fan practice, YouTube’s display algorithms would prioritize the more popular replies in the “related” or “recommended” videos section, incentivizing users to draw as many clicks to their video replies as possible. As Bucher explains, “the Reply Girls had found a way of exploiting the recommendation algorithm by employing various engine optimization tactics to drive trafc to their videos” (128): by displaying cleavage in the thumbnail (or “cover” image) for their videos and posting them as replies. Understandably, the videos attracted not only large numbers of clicks but also “massive down-votes by frustrated users who felt deceived or irritated by the proliferating cleavage-baring images popping up in the related feed” (128)—but the algorithm computed these down votes not as dislike but simply as “engagement” and promoted them even more. Te Reply Girls’ practices, intended to game the algorithm by feeding it what it seemed to want (clicks and views), may have played an important role in changing it: in 2012, YouTube announced it was changing its focus from clicks and view counts to maximizing for “watch time” and repeated viewing (Bucher 2018, 129). For Bucher, this case demonstrates the complex, dynamic, and multisided nature of power in algorithmic platforms: If one side of the story entails content creators having to monitor the systems while feeling like a “slave to the algorithm,” as the YouTuber Taryn Southern suggests, the fipside is that platform providers have to be alert as well. Power and resistance are part of the same operation, and\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nPlatform Studies\n\n|\n\n29\n\nthe question is, How and with what efects are they exercised by diferent actors in the algorithmic assemblage? (Bucher 2018, 139–140). As these examples show, in incorporating an understanding of creator activities, perspectives, and voices, interviews are very useful, but equally useful is public discussion about platform-specifc controversies (like the algorithm changes that Bucher discusses), which can ofen be found in the technology press or indeed in content posted by creators around particular events and controversies occurring on the platform. Direct-to-video testimony by YouTubers and other content creators is a rich source of insider perspectives and contested community norms around content standards and commercial dimensions of life as a YouTuber.\n\nCopyright © 2021.

These methods and tools make it possible to track large-scale patterns of platform use. For example, tracking the frequency of tweets over time on a particular hashtag can help us understand the intensity of public conversation on a topic; mapping the networks of links between Facebook pages can assist researchers in observing the emergence and clustering of political interest groups. Within critical media and communication studies, such approaches go beyond scientific observation: rather, they deliberately and reflexively use platforms’ own affordances and tools—that is, the “methods of the medium” (Rogers 2013)—to critically investigate and generate public oversight of their operations and societal influence. It is no surprise that people wanting to study platform cultures have turned to computational digital methods, because platforms are very large and complex and because they are internally ordered and structured, making large-scale data collection and analysis feasible. Tis makes it far easier to observe patterns across millions of tweets or YouTube videos than it was in earlier periods of web history, when simi-\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press.

Advances in sofware tools and the availability of training to use them have also made these methods accessible to humanities and social science scholars, and increasingly digital methods have become embedded and normalized in doctoral programs and even undergraduate courses. A key afordance of platforms for research purposes has been their application programming interfaces (APIs)—encoded protocols that instruct one sofware application about how and within what limits it can access data from another. In our case, a sofware program that wants to extract metadata about YouTube channels or videos can do so—and be reasonably confdent of complying with YouTube’s terms of service—by connecting directly to YouTube’s databases using one of the YouTube APIs. It is important to note here that while public APIs have been used extensively by researchers, they have been traditionally provided by platforms for commercial rather than public purposes. In the Web 2.0 era of the early to middle part of the frst decade of this century, APIs were ofered by social networking sites and user-created content platforms as a way to attract third-party tech developers to build additional features or external enhancements for the original websites, thereby improving the product and growing the audience overall. In doing digital methods, which requires deploying the “methods of the medium” in a critical way, it is very important to appreciate how the structures and strategies of platforms can shape the questions and methods that can be used to investigate them. Te choice of which kinds of information are encoded as data, the way that platform data is structured, and the rules attached to data access to public APIs both enable and inevitably infuence empirical research questions and analytical techniques—that is, diferent platforms not only have diferent afordances for creators and users but have diferent research afordances as well. Te Twitter APIs enable extensive research into time-series analyses of public discourse on a particular topic because they provide precise time stamps for each tweet and because they contain textual data that can easily be mined for hashtags. It is also common in Twitter research to map topical conversation networks because they provide data points relating to the identities of original posters, mentioned users, and replying users, with the tweet itself the unit of analysis. Te YouTube APIs\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nPlatform Studies\n\n|\n\n31\n\nenable research into the comparative popularity of videos and creators because they provide view and interaction counts on videos and subscriber counts on channels. Usable tools built on the Google-provided YouTube APIs, such as Bernhard Rieder’s (2015) YouTube Data Tools (YTDT), have made it relatively straightforward for nontechnical researchers to access and analysis metadata that can be used to observe and investigate YouTube as a cultural system. However, the real added value for studying creator cultures comes from interpreting these data with the aid of situated, critical knowledge about creator and audience practices in the context of specifc genres, communities, or issues. YouTube’s “ranking cultures” were studied by Bernhard Rieder, Ariadna Matamoros-Fernández, and Òscar Coromina (2018) using a large-scale computational analysis of which videos related to particular topics were ranked as most relevant by the YouTube search algorithm, combined with a qualitative analysis of the video content. Tey found that diferent topics exhibited very diferent patterns of video ranking trends (or “morphologies”), with some controversial topics looking more “newsy” and unstable with regard to which videos and creators ranked most highly and others looking more stable, with predictable actors ranking at the top. Te authors conclude that “YouTube’s search function is highly reactive to attention cycles” but that “YouTube-native” content and creators appear to successfully negotiate these attention cycles, with “the overall presence of ofen (far) right leaning YouTube personalities” indicating that the platform “arranges search ranking in a way that allows highly active ‘niche entrepreneurs’ to gain exceptional levels of visibility” by “feeding on controversy and loyal audiences.” Trough a combination of digital methods and literacy in YouTube’s platform vernaculars, the authors were able to “get a glimpse at complex ranking cultures that reward platform-specifc strategies and audience activation through strongly opinionated expression” (Rieder, Matamoros-Fernández, and Coromina 2018, 64). In another study, Dhiraj Murthy and Sanjay Sharma combined “social network analysis, qualitative coding, and thick data descriptive methods” to interpret comments posted on a small corpus of videos associated with the provocative music group Das Racist (2019, 191). Contrary to commonsense understandings of YouTube, in which “comments are ofen perceived as individual, random insults or only generalized ex-\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021.

Te authors’ fndings would not have been possible either through the use of network analysis or through a close reading of a sample of comments alone; both were needed. Digital-methods-enabled research has established shared approaches and methods, largely due to the shared reliance on platform APIs and the internal data structures of the social media platforms in question (as discussed earlier with regard to Twitter conversation networks and time-series analyses, for example). Tis has created some orthodox approaches and a common vocabulary, but it also entails an increasingly problematic dependency on free access to data provided by the same large proprietary platforms that we are attempting to study critically. For example, the new “computational legal studies” approaches developed by Nicolas Suzor and colleagues (2020) use Google/YouTube’s and Twitter’s own APIs to collect data on and observe the patterns in platforms’ content moderation and their public justifcations for these decisions— one of the most politically sensitive areas of platform governance and one that is very difcult to get data on in any other way. At the time of writing in 2020, the future of data-driven digital methods is far from certain. From the mid-2010s onward, the trend for corporate digital media platforms has been toward a far less open, more centralized approach to innovation, alongside the growth of user data markets—which has made the provision of open data access less appealing to platforms. At the same time, platforms are under increasing scrutiny both because of the cultural power they have and their role in extreme speech and the rise of Far Right subcultures and because of growing concern around the exploitation of user data for commercial ends without regard to privacy. As a result of these combined historical trajectories, platform companies have gradually been restricting access to their APIs or shuttering them altogether. Tese developments have had a negative impact on creative methods and tools development and, as we have argued elsewhere (Bruns et al. 2018), threaten public oversight of platforms at the very moment when societal concern about their reach and potentially harmful consequences is the highest it has ever been.\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nPlatform Studies\n\n| 33\n\nSince the operations of platforms are becoming such an acute issue of concern for creators, as well as a key site of public discourse and controversy, eforts to understand and maintain public oversight of platform protocols and algorithms are more important than ever. To forge ahead with platform studies, then, researchers will need to fnd ways of combining the systematic observation of platforms’ activities with insights into the experiences and vernacular expertise of creators, ideally delivering value back to creator communities by sharing knowledge and analytical tools. But given the progressive lockdowns and lockouts afecting data-driven digital methods, scholars will need to get creative and to deploy forensic investigative approaches that do not always depend on platform-provided data access via APIs. Te future of platform studies is hybrid digital methods.\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nHybrid Digital Methods Hybrid digital methods still use the “methods of the medium” to study platforms and their cultures of use, but they blur the boundaries between so-called quantitative and qualitative methods, use both computational and manual techniques for gathering and analyzing data and other materials, and do not necessarily rely on platform APIs. These hybrid methods are needed in order to follow the theoretical framework for the study of platforms that I established earlier in this chapter—that is, that platforms gain their distinctive characters, and change over time, through the coevolution of technologies, business models, and cultures of use (in terms of the focus of the present volume, this means creator cultures). It is therefore necessary that these different aspects be studied together and with regard to the relations among them and not separately. An example of a hybrid digital method is the app walkthrough (Light, Burgess, and Duguay 2018). Te app walkthrough allows researchers to systematically and forensically step through a platform or app interface, enabling the close observation of symbolic appeals to users, design logics, and traces of data fows, against the background of the platform’s ownership structures and business model. Te method can be very useful both for coming to grips with the particularities of a platform and for situating it in social, political, and economic contexts. For example, in Wang and Lobato’s (2019) discussion of how Chinese video-sharing\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press. All rights reserved.\n\n34\n\n| Jean Burgess\n\nservices throw into question some of the assumptions of Western platform studies, they used the app walkthrough method to examine the iQiyi interface, identifying and drawing out key distinctive elements of the platform for further critical discussion. Tey highlight that, contra many themes in Western critical platform studies, iQiyi does not demonstrate a trend to algorithmic personalization at an individual level and instead favors a busy aesthetic, presenting a plethora of content to users. Tis analysis leads the authors to observe that “iQiyi seeks to integrate its diverse audience into a common, shared, stable online television experience—in which all viewers are ofered the same news, current afairs and celebrity gossip—and to didactically guide viewers towards useful content” (Wang and Lobato 2019, 365). Tey point to an overarching cultural logic of paternalism rather than the more familiar (to Western observers) logic of individual cultural taste. Te authors conclude that “the structural integration between new and old media takes a visible form in iQiyi’s interface, which rejects the Silicon Valley model of algorithmic curation in favor of a newspaper and broadcast-like organizational structure,” providing “an important counterpoint to dominant strands of media theory in which platforms are associated with fragmentation, personalization, and individualization” (367). Tis insight is only made possible through the combination of media industry and interface analysis and requires close forensic investigations of the platform interface. Te app walkthrough can also be conducted in a qualitative social research setting, working with app users or, in the case of studying creator culture, with creators such as YouTubers or Instagram infuencers. Such approaches have been discussed and modeled in depth in the study of Facebook users by Brady Robards and Siân Lincoln (2017), as well as in the context of dating-app users by Kristian Møller Jørgensen’s (2016) “media go-along” method, which uses co-observation of users with mobile in hand as part of ethnographic work. In both cases, close attention is paid to the app’s features and afordances at the same time as research participants are encouraged to refect on their own practices and in particular the way those practices and the app or platform itself have changed together over time. In Twitter—A Biography (2020), Nancy Baym and I undertook such a project. We used a hybrid method called the “platform biography” to tell the story of how Twitter’s interface, business model, and architecture\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\nCopyright © 2021. New York University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nPlatform Studies\n\n|\n\n35\n\nboth shaped and was shaped by its user cultures. We gathered existing scholarly research on early Twitter’s features and users, and we mined tech-industry materials, Twitter’s ofcial blog, and hundreds of mainstream news articles about Twitter. We drew on popular company histories of Twitter, such as the journalist Nick Bilton’s book Hatching Twitter. We relied heavily on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine to uncover earlier iterations of the Twitter website’s interface and terms of service, as well as the many still-live blogs where early Twitter users discussed its culture, conventions, and norms in the early years. Most importantly, we undertook oral-history interviews with a small group of Twitter users, combining semistructured conversations with “scrollbacks” (Robards and Lincoln 2017) through their own archives. Trough this combination of methods, we discovered that Twitter’s distinctive platform culture and the struggles over that culture’s direction were intimately connected to its core features: the @ (reply or mention), the # (hashtag), and the RT (retweet). When we drew all these data sources together, we saw the dynamic and ofen fraught interplay among stakeholders and sociotechnical actors, working together to incrementally shape Twitter’s culture and to recast its possible futures. Our study showed that ideological struggles over whether the platform should be for socializing or for news have shaped the internal and external struggles over Twitter’s social purpose and transformed its technical architecture, in turn transforming it into a platform that prioritizes debate and news over intimacy and fun.\n\nConclusion One of the biggest challenges for researchers who want to understand the platformed media environment is also one of the biggest challenges for creators who rely on those platforms to make a living: platforms are by design relatively closed systems whose interfaces and user experiences are personalized to individual users, so it is difficult to achieve a shared or collective understanding of how they are operating and in whose interests. As some of the examples in this chapter have shown, artful combinations of critical interface analysis and ethnographic work can help to build a more holistic picture of platform culture and histories. There is much more yet-to-be-realized potential for hybrid methods— particularly the combination of ethnographic, creator- centered\n\nCreator Culture : An Introduction to Global Social Media Entertainment, edited by Stuart Cunningham, and David Craig, New\n\n36\n\n| Jean Burgess\n\napproaches with critical and computational digital methods—for example, conducting walkthroughs alongside creators to explore their metrics dashboards or using data visualizations of YouTube channel networks or patterns in video recommendations as prompts in interviews. The benefits to both researchers and creator communities could be significant: participatory, co-research approaches can empower creators with data about platform-wide trends and additional opportunities to engage in debates about platform logics and the broader political economy of digital media; at the same time, researchers have much to gain from being able to access the particular forms of insider knowledge about platform operations and logics that creators accumulate and share over time through their platformed labor, creative experimentation, and community-building activities.
