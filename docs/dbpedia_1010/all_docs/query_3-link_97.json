        "text": "Ever make a really dumb mistake on your job application and hit send before it's too late? What about an embarrassing mistake at work? You're not alone. Last week, in the Trulitica Community, a member shared how embarrassed they were about a mistake they had made on their job application. In our Slack channel, other members responded by sharing their own embarrassing stories too. 22 replies later, we had some stories that were keepers. I'll list out our top 3 below: 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝟭 First week on the job and you reply all to a group of 100+ people assuring them you're \"detail orientated\" 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝟮 You're excited for a virtual meetup with a contact high up in the organization. A last minute scheduling change means you're getting out of a surgery 2 hours before the call. You get out of surgery and while still on pain meds dial the number. You overestimate your ability to be professional, and effectively drunk dial your lead. 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝟯 You're on a Zoom call during the pandemic. Your colleague and science buddy is presenting something and sharing his screen during a meeting. You're in the meeting too. You forget he's screen sharing and send a DM trash talking someone else in the meeting. Your soul leaves your body, but somehow you don't die. ---------- Ok cool, so we're all embarrassing at some point or another. Why are you telling us this Ali? Because being on the job search in 2024 is an isolating, anxiety-inducing roller coaster ride. The job market is saturated, at least 50% of recruiters you talk to are ding dongs, and most startups have no idea what they actually want. The least you can do is have fun with it, build a community, share your burdens, and walk away feeling like less of an awkward turtle 🐢. At Trulitica Community, we do exactly that. We help each other, celebrate wins, are there for the losses, and occasionally laugh at ourselves. Best part? It's free for all coaching clients. Forever. No subscription charges. ---------- What's your most embarrassing work or job search story?
