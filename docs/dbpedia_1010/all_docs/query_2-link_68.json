        "text": "A remarkable year was recognised at the 2023 WA Sport Awards with WA Cricket dominating the honours, culminating with the inaugural Organisation of the Year.\n\nThe all-conquering WA Men’s outfit was named Team of the Year after winning the 2022-23 Marsh Sheffield Shield and Marsh One-Day Cup titles.\n\nThey became just the second side in the history of Australian domestic cricket to successfully defend the Shield and One-Day Cup double, outpointing Victoria (Shield) and South Australia (One-Day Cup) in each decider.\n\nHead Coach Adam Voges oversaw both titles as well as Perth Scorchers’ KFC BBL|12 championship, earning his second successive Coach of the Year award.\n\nVoges, whose new two-year deal with WA and the Scorchers was announced yesterday, is the first Head Coach to win all three Australian domestic championships in consecutive years.\n\n“I think there’s still plenty to achieve for our program,” Voges said.\n\n“We measure success in a number of different ways, from the achievements that we’ve been able to have on the field, through to bringing some of our younger players up the ranks.\n\n“We’re working to make sure Western Australian cricket is strong now, and that it will be in five years’ time as well.”\n\nIn a nod to the most successful 12-month period in the association’s history, WA Cricket took out the inaugural Organisation of the Year award.\n\nWA Cricket CEO Christina Matthews said receiving the award was a great honour.\n\n“To be selected as the inaugural recipient of this award is a special accolade for WA Cricket,” Matthews said.\n\n“Each and every person who works, plays and volunteers for our organisation has influenced our success on and off the field, and this award is deserving recognition of their outstanding contribution.”\n\nIn addition to winning the trio of men’s domestic titles, WA Cricket became the first Australian cricketing organisation to initiate a Pride-themed match, which was launched during the Weber WBBL|08 and KFC BBL|13 seasons.\n\nAdditionally, the WA Cricket Foundation is driving change in the lives of young women; fostering connections with Aboriginal communities; and creating safe spaces for young people of all abilities.\n\nWA Cricket Foundation partner Team Connect was named Sport Initiative of the Year, highlighting the Foundation’s ongoing work with young women in cricket.\n\nTeam Connect is a free community engagement program that supports teenage girls from traditionally low participation groups to play cricket at their local club.\n\nThe unique program connects local schools, clubs and communities in a simple model that has the potential to reduce social and emotional isolation for the participants and their families and, in turn, potentially improve educational and wellbeing outcomes."
