Barthel joined the club Istanbul last season after four consecutive campaigns with FC Bayern Munich. He averaged 6.3 points with very good shooting (57.8% 2FG, 41.2% 3FG, 88.4% FT) and 3.1 rebounds in 29 Turkish Airlines EuroLeague games in his first season with Fenerbahce. Before Sunday, however, Barthel had only played one game this season, spending less than 4 minutes on the floor in Round 2 against Panathinaikos OPAP Athens on October 7, 2021. He didn't even have time to shoot the ball. Almost five months later, Barthel is back in action and appears to be a solid contributor off the bench in his first games back.

He made his return in Round 27 against AS Monaco after practicing with the team a couple of times. Barthel saw a good chunk of playing time, more than 18 minutes, and made the most of it, finishing that game with 10 points. Two days later, in a rescheduled game from Round 19, Barthel had another good performance in a losing effort against Crvena Zvezda mts Belgrade with 15 points on near-perfect shooting - 5 of 6 inside the arc and burying his only three-point attempt and a pair of free throws. In the last two games, Barthel has averaged 12.5 points (87.5% 2FG, 100% 3FG, 88.9% FT) and a PIR of 15.0. It is a good sign for Fenerbahce to have an in-form Barthel back for the most decisive stretch of the regular season.
