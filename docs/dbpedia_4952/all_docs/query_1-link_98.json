        "text": "Plot\n\nThe majority of the film consists of Randy, Carl, and Dehling reciting their separate lovesick accounts of their experiences with Jewel, each narrating over what they consider to be the real version of the recent events. Scenes are often re-enacted twice, with different accounts contradicting each other for comedic effect. For example, when Dehling is narrating, he acts as if he were a completely fair, by-the-book police officer, and Randy is painted as a slimy, macho, abusive thug. When Randy is telling the story, he is the innocent victim and Dehling is shown as a suspicious, prying, hard-nosed cop; Carl is convinced that every woman is in love with him, and during his version of the tale, everyone acts accordingly.\n\nCast\n\nLiv Tyler as Jewel\n\nMatt Dillon as Randy\n\nPaul Reiser as Carl\n\nJohn Goodman as Detective Dehling\n\nMichael Douglas as Mr. Burmeister\n\nAndrew Silverstein as Utah / Elmo\n\nReba McEntire as Dr. Green\n\nRichard Jenkins as Father Jimmy\n\nLeo Rossi as Joey Dinardo\n\nAndrea Bendewald as Karen\n\nSandy Martin as Bingo vendor woman\n\nHelen Hunt (deleted scenes) as Truck driver\n\nProduction\n\nWriter Stan Seidel, who died prior to the film's release, drew much of the film's material from Randy Dana's days as a bartender at Humphrey's Restaurant & Tavern, a college bar located in the midst of St. Louis University.\n\nReception"
