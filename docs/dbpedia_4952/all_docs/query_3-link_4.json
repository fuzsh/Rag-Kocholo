Who are you writing for? How do you want them to feel when they see your post or read your Instagram caption? What actions do you want them to take?\n\nHere are a few more tips for creating Instagram captions that resonate.\n\n1. Give your audience more context\n\nA picture might say a thousand words, but your Instagram posts need captions to provide more context. Especially when sharing branded content, you need some copy to fully explain the point you‚Äôre trying to convey. The best advice for writing captions on Instagram? Front-loading your captions with valuable information. Instagram cuts off what your users see after a few lines of text, so cover the crucial things first.\n\nUse your caption to:\n\nDescribe to your audience the image you shared\n\nExplain why you‚Äôre sharing it and why it‚Äôs relevant\n\nGive your audience an action to take\n\nMost importantly, do so in a way that‚Äôs concise and to the point. Which brings me to my next tip.\n\n2. Keep captions short and sweet\n\nInstagram captions can be a maximum of 2,200 characters, which is between 310 and 550 words. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean every one of your captions should take up that much space.\n\nIn fact, it‚Äôs typically better to create a succinct, quick and easy-to-read caption over a large block of text‚Äîexcept for in rare circumstances when that space is needed to fully flesh out an offering, contest, giveaway or promotion. Sometimes, it might be best to only write a one-word Instagram caption.\n\n3. Write several drafts and AB test your Instagram captions\n\nAs with most writing, it‚Äôs important to write several drafts of a caption before you settle on one you‚Äôre satisfied with. Writing, reviewing and editing your content before you publish will improve your chances of spotting any mistakes.\n\nRemember, you can A/B test your captions with different phrases, hashtags, calls-to-action and even different lengths of content. To find out which captions give you the best result, track your metrics with a social media tool like Sprout Social and use your findings to guide your future Instagram captions.\n\n4. Stick to your tone of voice guidelines\n\nEvery brand should have standard brand voice guidelines to follow. This helps your marketing team be consistent, not only in every single Instagram caption but also everywhere else including your tweets, Facebook posts, blog content and email newsletters.\n\n5. Incorporate holidays, hashtags, emojis and acronyms\n\nEven for a business, Instagram is still a fun social media platform, so don‚Äôt be afraid to let loose a little. Celebrate your followers‚Äô favorite holidays and seasons. Incorporate emojis. Use a bit of slang. Throw in some popular acronyms (i.e., DM, IRL, IMO, FOMO). Of course, always be sure to use Instagram hashtags.\n\nRemember, hashtags in your Instagram caption improve your visibility. However, it‚Äôs essential to use the correct number of relevant hashtags. Measure the engagement levels of your audience with different amounts of tags to see what your magic number is.\n\n6. Drive engagement\n\nWhile someone may ‚Äúlike‚Äù your photo just because it‚Äôs high-quality or well-designed, as a brand you‚Äôre hoping for a bit more than that. Maybe a comment, a follow or‚Äîbest-case scenario‚Äîa purchase or signup.\n\nTo further engage your audience, use your caption strategically. Ask a question or tease a new product or feature using some of the examples we shared above.\n\nGuide your customers towards activities that are lucrative for your business. For instance, ask them to tag their friends in the comments to improve your brand reach, or visit the link in your bio.\n\nTake advantage of these Instagram caption ideas\n\nStart creating your own incredible Instagram posts with these Instagram caption ideas.
