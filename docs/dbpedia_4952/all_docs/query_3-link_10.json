This release combines a range of small additions across several areas of schema.org with an ongoing concern for cleanup and integration of existing vocabulary. Notable additions include ExhibitionEvent, Barcode, DataFeed, containsPlace, GeoCircle, geoRadius, geoMidpoint, providerMobility and actionPlatform. A number of changes improve our handling of Service description, including the deprecation of the ProfessionalService construct. We have kept all the specific types that were previously considered ProfessionalService but discourage the use of the type 'ProfessionalService' since it is easily confused with 'Service'.\n\nVocabulary\n\nIssue #773: Added actionPlatform as a simpler mechanism to specify the platform for EntryPoint targets.\n\nIssue #823: Marked homeLocation, workLocation as subproperties of location, and marked location as expecting textual values.\n\nIssue #818: Added OfferCatalog for specifying a catalog of offers by an Organization or Service.\n\nIssue #817: Added providerMobility to describe whether a service provider is at a fixed location or has a dynamic location.\n\nIssue #445: Added ExhibitionEvent and added a superproperty of workPresented and workPerformed to cover event-to-work relationships such as a work being exhibited.\n\nIssue #113: Added GeoCircle as a subtype of GeoShape, providing a more usable mechanism than circle structured text; added geoRadius, geoMidpoint to describe the size and location of these circular areas.\n\nIssue #323: Added locationCreated to CreativeWork.\n\nIssue #811: Renamed containedIn as containedInPlace, and added an inverse containsPlace.\n\nIssue #810: postalCode and addressCountry are now an expected property for GeoShape and GeoCoordinates. Adjusted addressCountry to allow textual values, matching the existing definition.\n\nIssue #801: Broadened award, category, offers to be applicable on Service. Extended itemOffered to expect Service as a possible value. Added LegalService as a supertype for Notary, Attorney. Marked ProfessionalService as deprecated, with some explanation, and added a brief account of the relationship with Service to some of the more service-oriented local business types e.g. LegalService, HomeAndConstructionBusiness. A cluster of construction-related local businesses formerly treated as ProfessionalService continue as HomeAndConstructionBusiness subtypes. Marked Attorney as deprecated in favor of LegalService per #784. Added hoursAvailable to Service.\n\nIssue #411 Clarification and cleanup around areaServed, now marked as a super-property of the more specific eligibleRegion and availableAtOrFrom properties. Cross-referenced eligibleRegion and ineligibleRegion. Marked serviceArea as supersededBy areaServed. Updated the associated types for areaServed to cover those used by its sub-properties.\n\nIssue #808: The address property now anticipates Text values, to support unstructured address data.\n\nIssue #802: Referenced World Geotic System from GeoCoordinates properties (elevation, longitude, latitude); made address an expected property for GeoCoordinates and GeoShape.\n\nIssue #796 Added offeredBy property to relate an Offer to a Person or Organisation.

Also added example for Library and linked it to openingHoursSpecification as a good example for that too.\n\nBulk update to examples: Various fixes to html syntax, missing quotes and <meta> tags that should be <link> tags.\n\nIssue #478: Replaced <meta> tags that should be <link> tags in periodical examples.\n\nSeveral small markup fixes to various examples.\n\nSee also issue list for this release.\n\n2.1\n\nsdo-ganymede\n\n(2015-08-06) Version 2.1 (working name 'sdo-ganymede') includes many small fixes, some new vocabulary, as well as the first release of the 'hosted extensions' mechanism, featuring bib(liographic) and auto(mobile) extensions for final review. A pre-release of this version of schema.org was available for review.\n\nVocabulary\n\nIssue #611: Added Person as expected value for publisher property.\n\nIssue #596: Documented that affiliation is a sub-property of memberOf.\n\nIssue #207: Added a Bridge type under CivicStructure.\n\nIssue #346: Added URL as expected value for genre property.\n\nIssue #374: Added Report type under Article, and a reportNumber property.\n\nIssue #577: Amended videoFormat to indicate that it is expected on BroadcastEvent and ScreeningEvent, rather than TelevisionStation.\n\nIssue #535: Broadened domain of parentOrganization to allow any Organization, rather than only LocalBusiness. Noted parentOrganization and subOrganization as inverses.\n\nIssue #531: Added the lyrics property to MusicComposition.\n\nIssue #518: Renamed paymentDue property to paymentDueDate. Changed paymentStatus property to expect an enumerated value of type PaymentStatusType in addition to Text. The options are: PaymentComplete, PaymentDue, PaymentPastDue, PaymentDeclined and PaymentAutomaticallyApplied.\n\nIssue #137: Deprecated UserInteraction and its children in favor of a new type: InteractionCounter. InteractionCounter allows for reporting aggregated statistics by service and type. Thanks elf Pavlik for collaboration.\n\nIssue #526: Added new types LiveBlogPosting, SocialMediaPosting, and DiscussionForumPosting, alongside supporting properties.\n\nIssue #334: Updated the controlled values for accessibilityHazard shown in examples to follow latest community recommendations: 'noFlashing' is now 'noFlashingHazard', 'noMotionSimulation' is 'noMotionSimulationHazard', and 'noSound' is 'noSoundHazard'.\n\nSite improvements\n\nIssue #429: Hosted extensions e.g. bib.schema.org are now enabled and linked from 'core' pages with appropriate navigation and styling.\n\nIssue #655: Extension definitions now include an isPartOf property to link them to the extension.\n\nIssue #527: Added materials from Kickoff Workshop in 2011.\n\nIssue #78: Multiple supertypes are now displayed properly. It is possible for several schema.org types to apply to a single thing, and for a type to have multiple parent types. This is relatively rare, but important to display. For example, anything that is a LocalBusiness is considered both an Organization and a Place; so all subtypes of LocalBusiness have both as supertypes. We can now show this more clearly, e.g. ElectronicsStore.\n\nAdded CSS for explicit styling ( ) in releases page during Steering Group review of candidate releases.\n\nIssue #557, #660, #695, #469: Several DataType-related navigation fixes, following recent modeling changes.\n\nIssue #548: Added a favicon.ico image.

This version features many updated definitions, type/property associations and term names that improve consistency and usability. It also introduces a new extension system. Version 2.0 adds various new terms including mainEntityOfPage and major contributions from the Automotive Ontology community.\n\nVocabulary\n\nIssue #262: Added new vocabulary for Car: The new vocabulary includes a number of properties such as: numberOfAirbags, numberOfAxles, numberOfForwardGears, fuelConsumption, fuelEfficiency vehicleEngine, EngineSpecification...\n\nThanks to Martin Hepp, Mirek Sopek, Karol SzczepaÅski and others in the Automotive Ontology community group. We anticipate substantial additions that build on this foundation will be contributed as an extension.\n\nIssue #301: Added a generic property/values mechanism, building upon PropertyValueSpecification, StructuredValue and value; added PropertyValue and additionalProperty. See examples for usage. This is a lightweight mechanism to allow markup of properties that are not easily mapped to existing schema.org properties. Whenever possible, it is generally better to use a dedicated schema.org property if one exists.\n\nIssue #301: Added mainEntityOfPage (and an inverse, mainEntity) to indicate which of the entities mentioned in a page is its primary topic.\n\nIssue #225: Added a schemaVersion property, for use by applications that require more precise referencing of schema versions.\n\nIssue #266: Added OrderItem to allow ParcelDelivery to be tracked per item, not just on an entire Order.\n\nIssue #170: Clarifying CommentAction, Comment by deprecating UserComments. Several mentions of UserComments removed from other terms. 'inLanguage' supersedes 'language'. Added a resultComment property. UserInteraction and sub-types will be deprecated.\n\nIssue #300: Answer is now a sub-type of Comment. The 'question' property expects 'Question' type for its values (rather than Text as in AskAction previously). Added resultComment on ReplyAction. Cleaned up examples.\n\nIssue #130: Amended True and False to be instances (rather than sub-types) of Boolean.\n\nIssue #218: Amended DataType to model it as a sub-class of Class, with each datatype e.g. Boolean, Text, Date, DateTime, Time etc. being classes that have a typeOf DataType. DataTypes can have sub-types, e.g. Integer and Float are subtypes of Number.\n\nIssue #328: Added ScreeningEvent to support movie/video screenings.\n\nIssue #314: Added MovieClip and VideoGameClip as parallels to TVClip and RadioClip.\n\nIssue #122: Added gtin12 property for Product.\n\nIssue #417: Renamed many types and properties, which had overly generic names. This is no cause for alarm, the superseded names can still be used, although we encourage consumers and producers of schema.org data to move towards the newer terminology. CreativeWorkSeason was Season, CreativeWorkSeries was Series, SoftwareSourceCode was Code, TaxiService was Taxi, actionApplication was application, actionOption was option, artMedium was material, artworkSurface was surface, availableOnDevice was device, branchOf was parentOrganization, broadcastTimezone was timezone, codeSampleType was sampleType, containsSeason was season, datasetTimeInterval was temporal, executableLibraryName was assembly, exerciseCourse was course, exerciseRelatedDiet was diet, incentiveCompensation was incentives, includedDataCatalog was catalog, isAccessibleForFree was free, jobBenefits was benefits, runtimePlatform was runtime, serviceArea was area, serviceOutput was produces, softwareRequirements was requirements, targetCollection was collection.\n\nSite improvements\n\nIssue #429: Implementation of new extension system.\n\nIssue #6: Improved 404 handler for missing pages, with support for old-style \"/Person/Minister\" extension URLs and Action-related \"/query-input\" pseudo-properties.\n\nIssue #318: Added an experimental JSON(-LD) view of the hierarchy.

Also weight/height on Person; Control and RSVP actions; Role names; Dated monetary values.\n\nVocabulary\n\nUpdated ItemList to allow for richer kinds of lists (including ordering), rather than just strings; added BreadcrumbList\n\nThe weight and height properties can now be with the Person type. Added netWorth to Person. Added EmployeeRole.\n\nAdded SportsOrganization as a super-type of SportsTeam, representing sports organizations, including sports teams, governing bodies, and sports associations. Added a sport property to indicate the associated sport(s) for a SportsOrganization; also added coach and athlete properties. Added numberedPosition property to OrganizationRole.

A property softwareHelp has also been added to SoftwareApplication to indicate supporting documentation.\n\nWhile integrating VideoGame an issue was raised around the need to describe series of games. As a result we have made some changes to the Series type, which previously emphasised only TV and Radio Series: added VideoGameSeries, BookSeries, and MovieSeries. The recently added Periodical type is also now modeled as a Series subtype. Some redundant type/property associations were also tidied up. The existing trailer property can now be used with VideoGame and VideoGameSeries.\n\nAdded ControlAction (previously proposed as OperateAction).
