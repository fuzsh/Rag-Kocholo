        "text": "Ideas for Employers and Employees\n\nThe workplace is an important part of National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM)\n\nThe ideas below are just a few ways employers and their employees can participate, during October and all year long. For additional inspiration, check out Beyond NDEAM: Year-Round Employer Strategies for Advancing Disability Inclusion.\n\nReview policies\n\nNDEAM is an opportune time to review your company's policies to ensure they convey a commitment to an inclusive workplace culture. For assistance in doing so, see Inclusion@Work (in particular the first section, \"Lead the Way: Inclusive Business Culture\").\n\nEstablish an employee resource group\n\nNDEAM is a perfect time to launch a disability Employee Resource Group (ERG). Sometimes referred to as Employee Networks or Affinity Groups, ERGs offer employees an opportunity to connect and receive support from others with similar backgrounds or interests. For more information, see A Toolkit for Establishing and Maintaining Successful Employee Resource Groups. If your company already has a disability ERG, consider using NDEAM to remind employees about it through displays, information tables or other communication channels.\n\nCreate a display\n\nNDEAM is a great time to freshen up bulletin boards in break areas or other locations that employees frequent by posting positive messages about your company's commitment to a disability-inclusive workforce. Start by putting up this year's NDEAM poster (English | Spanish). Additional display materials include the \"What Can YOU Do?\" poster series.\n\nTrain supervisors\n\nSupervisors are the individuals closest to an organization's workforce. As part of NDEAM, consider conducting training to ensure they understand their role in fostering an inclusive workplace culture. Such training may include a review of relevant policies, including the process for providing reasonable accommodations. One easy way to provide such training is to make use of available \"turn-key\" training modules and available materials, such as those available from the Campaign for Disability Employment.\n\nEducate employees\n\nIt is critical that companies committed to disability inclusion effectively and regularly reinforce that commitment to employees. NDEAM offers an opportunity to do this through disability training or informal educational events such as brown-bag lunch discussions. Several ready-to-use resources can assist in facilitating such activities, such as disability etiquette materials and videos with accompanying discussion guides. Another option is to contact local disability organizations to see if they offer workplace training programs.\n\nPublish articles\n\nNDEAM offers timely and fresh content for an employee newsletter or internal website. Articles could address a range of topics, such as general information about the company's commitment to an inclusive workplace, the process for requesting reasonable accommodations, or perhaps recognizing the contributions of employees with\n\ndisabilities—either in general or on an individual level. Your company's top executive could also issue a message to all employees recognizing NDEAM.\n\nFeature NDEAM in social media activities\n\nLikewise, NDEAM provides an interesting hook for social media platforms, including Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and X. Organizations are encouraged to include the hashtag #NDEAM. Sample key messages are available to assist in incorporating NDEAM into social media activities.\n\nIssue an NDEAM press release\n\nEmployers can also issue a press release to local media to announce their involvement in NDEAM. To assist, a \"fill-in-the-blank\" template is available that organizations can quickly customize and pitch to their local media.\n\nParticipate in Disability Mentoring Day\n\nDisability Mentoring Day promotes career development for youth with disabilities through hands-on programs, job shadowing and ongoing mentoring. The nationwide observance is the third Wednesday of each October, but companies may choose to host their own events on any day of the month (or year for that matter). The American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) offers information to assist in implementing a Disability Mentoring Day event.\n\nIdeas for Educators and Youth Service Professionals\n\nYouth serving professionals are a critical component of National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM).\n\nHold a discussion\n\nNDEAM presents an opportune time to discuss the topic of disability employment with students, particularly those at an age when they are considering career options and learning about the world of work. One easy way to do so is to use the \"I Can\" video and accompanying youth discussion guide.\n\nCreate a display\n\nNDEAM is a great time to freshen up bulletin boards. Start by putting up this year's NDEAM poster (English | Spanish). A customizable poster (English | Spanish) is also available to highlight an organization’s members. Additional display materials include posters from the Campaign for Disability Employment. Educational supply stores may also offer other materials with positive images featuring people with disabilities in various community and employment settings.\n\nOrganize an assembly\n\nAnother option is to hold an assembly addressing the topic of disability employment, with content tailored as appropriate for age. Such an assembly might feature guest speakers from local disability service organizations and/or people with disabilities in various professions willing to talk about their jobs, interests and experiences. Related to this, it is important to ensure that any career exploration event, such as a traditional career day (whether held during NDEAM or any other time of year), includes people with disabilities.\n\nImplement \"soft skills\" training\n\nInterpersonal skills, such as teamwork, decision-making and communications, are critical for success in all occupations and industries. Yet, many youth do not have exposure to training focused on such \"soft\" skills prior to entering the workforce. During NDEAM or anytime, you can address this gap with Skills to Pay the Bills: Mastering Soft Skills for Workplace Success, a series of interactive, hands-on activities to help youth prepare for employment, regardless of their interests or intended career paths. Although developed by ODEP, this curriculum's content is applicable to youth both with and without disabilities and is available in both English and Spanish.\n\nEducate about disability history\n\nDespite the number of people with disabilities in the U.S. and the fact that they represent all races, classes and cultures, many people are unaware of the rich history of the disability movement. To fill this gap, some states require schools to teach about disability history each year. For an overview of major milestones in disability history and resources for educators to enhance awareness of it, see Disability History: An Important Part of America's Heritage.\n\nEngage student leaders\n\nFaculty advisors to groups such as student councils and student-led publications or other media can suggest NDEAM as a possible hook for content during October. For example, a student council might invite a local community leader with a disability to a meeting to speak about their experiences. Likewise, student reporters might interview such an individual or write an article/produce a segment on the contributions of many famous people with disabilities throughout America's history.\n\nShare the \"Guideposts for Success\"\n\nThe Guideposts for Success represent what research and practice has identified as key educational and career development interventions that make a positive difference in the lives of all youth, including youth with disabilities. NDEAM is a perfect time to introduce (or reinforce) these important findings to educators and youth service professionals. Channels for doing so might include workshops, trainings or staff publications.\n\nTrain front-line staff\n\nIt is imperative that youth service professionals have the knowledge, skills and abilities to effectively serve youth with disabilities, especially those in transition. Key tools to assist in improving this capacity—during NDEAM and all year round—are available through ODEP's CAPE-Youth Center for Advancing Policy on Employment for Youth.\n\nOf course, as employers themselves, schools, school districts and youth service provider organizations are also encouraged to recognize NDEAM among their staff. For ideas on how to do so, see ideas for employers and employees.\n\nIdeas for State Governors, Legislators and Other Policymakers\n\nPolicymakers play a key role in advancing the spirit of National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM).\n\nThe ideas below are just a few ways governors, state legislators and other policymakers can participate during October and all year long.\n\nTake Your Legislator to Work Day (TYLTWD)\n\nExperience the power of community-integrated employment by shadowing an employee with a disability at their workplace. Take Your Legislator to Work Day (TYLTWD) is an extension of NDEAM that highlights the importance of Employment First policies and legislation. Georgia was one of the first states to participate and has a good model to emulate.\n\nLegislative Disability Awareness Day\n\nEstablish an annual Legislative Disability Awareness Day to explore bills that will help improve employment outcomes for people with disabilities. For example, the New York State Assembly has used the day to highlight disability rights and pass a package of bills aimed at empowering disabled people.\n\nCreate an NDEAM proclamation or statement\n\nRelease a proclamation or statement recognizing NDEAM that reaffirms your state's commitment to creating an inclusive workplace culture for job seekers and employees with disabilities. To help, see this sample NDEAM proclamation language.\n\nSign \"State as a Model Employer\" executive orders\n\nGovernors can sign executive orders to examine state policies and create task forces that study workforce development for people with disabilities. For examples of policy ideas to include, see the Employer Assistance and Resource Network on Disability Inclusion's (EARN) model framework, \"Joint Resolution or Executive Order for States as Model Employers of People with Disabilities.\"\n\nCreate a display\n\nNDEAM is a great time to freshen up bulletin boards in break areas or other locations that staff members frequent by posting positive messages about your office's commitment to a disability-inclusive workforce. Start by putting up this year's NDEAM poster (English | Spanish). Additional display materials include posters from the Campaign for Disability Employment.\n\nEducate staff members\n\nIt is critical that offices committed to disability inclusion effectively and regularly communicate and demonstrate that commitment to staff. NDEAM offers an opportunity to do this through disability training or informal educational events such as brown-bag lunch discussions. Several ready-to-use resources can assist in facilitating such activities, such as disability etiquette materials and videos with accompanying discussion guides Another option is to contact local disability organizations to see if they offer workplace training programs.\n\nFeature NDEAM in social media activities\n\nLikewise, NDEAM provides an interesting hook for social media platforms, including Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and X. Organizations are encouraged to include the hashtag #NDEAM. Sample key messages are available to assist in incorporating NDEAM into social media and other activities.\n\nIssue an NDEAM press release\n\nPolicymakers can also issue a press release to local media and distribute it through email lists to announce their involvement in NDEAM. To assist, a \"fill-in-the-blank\" template is available that policymakers can quickly customize and pitch to their local media.\n\nPost an NDEAM weblink\n\nAn NDEAM link on your website informs constituents and other visitors about information of interest to them while also helping to keep your website dynamic and up to date. To create a link, use the NDEAM poster thumbnail image or a simple text headline and link it to an article on your website.\n\nDevelop a disability employment webpage\n\nNDEAM is a great time to unveil a dedicated disability employment webpage listing tools and resources to help visitors understand related issues and implement steps to foster a disability-inclusive workplace. Two examples of resources to include are the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) and EARN. For additional ideas on things to include on such a page, visit the ODEP website.\n\nLaunch or sponsor a state apprenticeship, internship or fellowship program\n\nGovernors and state and local legislators can sign an executive order or pass legislation or resolutions establishing an apprenticeship, internship, or fellowship program within state or local agencies for students with disabilities. State and local officials can also recruit interns with disabilities to their own staff.\n\nParticipate in Disability Mentoring Day\n\nDisability Mentoring Day promotes career development for youth with disabilities through hands-on programs, job shadowing and ongoing mentoring. The nationwide observance is the third Wednesday of each October, but policymakers may choose to host their events on any day of the month (or year for that matter). The American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) offers information to assist in implementing a Disability Mentoring Day event.\n\nReach out to local media\n\nNDEAM presents an opportunity for organizations to increase their visibility through local TV, radio and print media. Ideas include writing an op-ed piece or letter to the editor about the value and talent people with disabilities have to offer in the workplace and community or encouraging local TV or radio news to run a feature on one or more local employers observing the month.\n\nIdeas for Associations and Unions\n\nYour organization can play an important role in promoting National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM)\n\nThe ideas below are just a few ways you can contribute.\n\nFeature NDEAM in your magazine or newsletter\n\nNDEAM offers timely and fresh content for magazines or newsletters. Articles can inform members about NDEAM and its purpose, as well as specific ideas for how members can implement relevant activities within their organization. For content ideas, see Ideas for Employers and Employees or simply use one of the NDEAM \"drop-in\" articles below that can be quickly tailored by inserting your organization's name where prompted.\n\nArticle for association publications\n\nArticle for union publications\n\nFeature NDEAM in social media activities\n\nLikewise, NDEAM provides an interesting hook for social media platforms, including Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and X.

NDEAM key messages are available to assist in incorporating NDEAM into social media activities.\n\nPost an NDEAM weblink\n\nAn NDEAM link on your website informs members and other visitors about information of interest to them while also helping to keep your website dynamic and up to date. To create a link, use the NDEAM poster thumbnail image or a simple text headline and link it to an article on your website or directly to the list of ideas for employers and employees.\n\nSend a \"president's message\" about NDEAM\n\nAssociation or union leaders can take advantage of NDEAM to send a special email to members encouraging them to participate and providing information about how they can do so. In addition, NDEAM can be incorporated into speeches or the president's column in your organization's monthly publication.\n\nHold an NDEAM \"brown-bag lunch,\" webcast or teleconference\n\nFor local organizations, such as chambers of commerce, NDEAM presents an opportune time to sponsor a brown-bag lunch or informal seminars on the topic of disability employment. For national organizations, webcasts or teleconferences may be more appropriate. Sources for speakers for such events include various national and state disability-related organizations.\n\nDevelop a disability employment webpage\n\nNDEAM is a great time to unveil a dedicated disability employment webpage for members listing tools and resources to help them understand related issues and implement steps to foster a disability-inclusive workplace. Two examples of resources to include are the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) and the Employer Assistance and Resource Network on Disability Inclusion (EARN). For additional ideas on things to include on such a page, visit the ODEP website.\n\nDistribute NDEAM posters\n\nIn today's world of electronic communication, sending something useful and tangible to members can make an impact and reinforce the value of association membership. Associations can use the occasion of NDEAM to send their members a poster (English | Spanish) to hang in employee break areas or other locations that employees frequent to promote a positive, inclusive message. Likewise, unions can send posters to their locals.\n\nOf course, as employers themselves, associations and unions are also encouraged to recognize NDEAM among their staff.

A template that organizations can easily customize is available to assist in soliciting such a proclamation. In addition, you can encourage community leaders to mention NDEAM during various public appearances leading up to and during October.\n\nHold an NDEAM \"management breakfast\" or \"brown-bag lunch\"\n\nNDEAM presents an opportune time to sponsor an informal seminar or panel presentation for local employers on the topic of disability employment and the benefits of a disability-inclusive workplace. Such an event also offers the opportunity for disability-related organizations to promote their overall efforts and possibly earn additional sponsorships and support from local businesses.\n\nHold a poster contest\n\nThe NDEAM theme (or any slogan used by your organization) could be the theme for a poster contest for local youth. Such a contest could have different levels for different age groups, and winning entries could be displayed at a central location in the community. In addition, winners could be recognized by community and business leaders at a reception or other event, and media could be invited.\n\nFeature NDEAM in your newsletter\n\nNDEAM offers timely and fresh content for organizational publications or social media activities.

For additional ideas on things to include on such a page, visit the ODEP website.\n\nOf course, as employers themselves, disability-related organizations are also encouraged to recognize NDEAM among their staff. For ideas on how to do so, see ideas for employers and employees.\n\nIdeas for Federal Agencies\n\nThe Federal Government is committed to becoming a model employer of people with disabilities\n\nFederal agencies are highly encouraged to take part in National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM). The ideas below are just a few ways they can do so, in addition to the general ideas for employers and employees.\n\nJoin FEED\n\nNDEAM is a great time to get involved in Federal Exchange on Employment & Disability (FEED), an interagency working group focused on information sharing, best practices and collaborative partnerships designed to make the Federal Government a model employer of people with disabilities. Membership is open to federal employees at any level whose job duties involve the inclusion of people with disabilities, including recruitment, hiring, retention and advancement.\n\nAccess the Workforce Recruitment Program\n\nThe Workforce Recruitment Program (WRP) connects federal and private-sector employers to qualified and pre-screened college students and recent graduates with disabilities. Coordinated by ODEP and the U.S. Department of Defense, it runs year-round, with the database of participants updated each December. During NDEAM, federal agencies can access the WRP to fill permanent jobs or plan to use it to fill summer and permanent positions for the coming year. More than 50 federal agencies already take advantage of the WRP; make sure yours is one of them!\n\nProvide federal-specific training\n\nAs with all employers, federal agencies can use NDEAM to provide training to all employees, making use of ready-to-use resources such as disability etiquette materials and videos accompanying with accompanying discussion guides. But NDEAM is also a natural time to offer refresher training for disability program managers, hiring managers, supervisors, Equal Employment Opportunity representatives and selective placement coordinators.\n\nStart a mentoring program\n\nLike all employers, federal agencies can participate in Disability Mentoring Day, which takes place the third Wednesday of October. The American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) offers information to assist in implementing a Disability Mentoring Day event. Federal agencies may also consider using NDEAM to launch a longer-term, ongoing mentoring program.\n\nFeature NDEAM in social media activities\n\nNDEAM provides an interesting hook for social media platforms, including Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and X. Agencies are encouraged to include the hashtag #NDEAM. Key messages are available to assist in incorporating NDEAM into social media and other activities."
