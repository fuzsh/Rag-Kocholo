        "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Syros Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: SYRS), a biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery and development of medicines to control the expression of genes, today announced that the Company and its collaborators from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute will present new preclinical data on SY-1365, a first-in-class selective cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) inhibitor currently in a Phase 1 trial in patients with advanced solid tumors, at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting taking place April 14-18, 2018 in Chicago.\n\nThe data, which will be presented in both a poster discussion session and a poster session, show that SY-1365 has significant anti-tumor activity in multiple models of treatment-resistant ovarian cancer. The data also identify potential biomarkers of response to SY-1365. Syros plans to open expansion cohorts in mid-2018 in its ongoing Phase 1 trial to evaluate SY-1365 in patients with ovarian cancer, as well as to evaluate these potential biomarkers (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03134638).\n\nDetails on the presentations are as follows:\n\nPresentation Title: SY-1365, a selective CDK7 inhibitor, exhibits potent anti-tumor activity against ovarian cancer models in vitro and in vivo\n\nSession Category: Molecular and Cellular Biology/Genetics\n\nPresenter: Panagiotis A. Konstantinopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\n\nAbstract Number: 1343\n\nPoster Discussion Session\n\nDate & Time: Sunday, April 15, 4:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. CDT\n\nSession Title: Targeting the Cell Cycle: Mechanism and Therapy – Poster Discussion\n\nLocation: McCormick Place South, Level 4, Room S402\n\nPoster Session\n\nDate and Time: Monday, April 16, 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. CDT\n\nSession Title: Targeting the Cell Cycle: Mechanism and Therapy\n\nPoster Session Location: McCormick Place South, Exhibit Hall A, Poster Section 23\n\nAbout Syros Pharmaceuticals\n\nSyros is pioneering the understanding of the non-coding region of the genome to advance a new wave of medicines that control expression of genes. Syros has built a proprietary platform that is designed to systematically and efficiently analyze this unexploited region of DNA in human disease tissue to identify and drug novel targets linked to genomically defined patient populations. Because gene expression is fundamental to the function of all cells, Syros’ gene control platform has broad potential to create medicines that achieve profound and durable benefit across a range of diseases. Syros is currently focused on cancer and monogenic diseases and is advancing a growing pipeline of gene control medicines. Syros’ lead drug candidates are SY-1425, a selective RARα agonist in a Phase 2 clinical trial for genomically defined subsets of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, and SY-1365, a selective CDK7 inhibitor in a Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with advanced solid tumors. Led by a team with deep experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization, Syros is located in Cambridge, Mass.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including without limitation statements regarding the Company’s ability initiate expansion cohorts in the Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-1365 in ovarian and breast cancer in mid-2018, whether potential biomarkers of response to SY-1365 will result in a successful patient selection strategy, and the benefits of Syros’ gene control platform. The words ‘‘anticipate,’’ ‘‘believe,’’ ‘‘continue,’’ ‘‘could,’’ ‘‘estimate,’’ ‘‘expect,’’ ‘‘intend,’’ ‘‘may,’’ ‘‘plan,’’ ‘‘potential,’’ ‘‘predict,’’ ‘‘project,’’ ‘‘target,’’ ‘‘should,’’ ‘‘would,’’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.
