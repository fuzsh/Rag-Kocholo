Hey folks, Harry here with some pics (by way of Norway) on ONE NIGHT AT McCOOL'S, which has technically been sitting in a can for quite some time awaiting release... now usually that means that the film sucks, but from what I hear... USA FILMS just didn't have a place to put it in its 2000 film schedule, so it got bumped to 2001. Also, I've heard from several people that have seen it that have said... while it isn't a great film, it is quite a bit of fun. SO... we'll have to wait and see, but for now, here's some pics to hold ya over...

Hello Harry!(My writing skills may suck but I come from Norway so who cares!) You said if we had any info at all about the movies you listed, we should send it. "One night at McCools" is one of many must-see films of 2001. It might have something to do with the fact that I think Harald Zwart is one hell of a director which deserves to be noticed, or that John Goodman, Liv Tyler and Matt Dillon in a Michal Douglas film has to make people smile. These are old pictures, taken from a newspaper in Norway, but I havent seen them anywhere on the net so...
