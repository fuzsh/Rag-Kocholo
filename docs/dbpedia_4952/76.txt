I feel like a broken record when I constantly and sarcastically refer to 2001 as the year of some of the worst movies ever made, but I've found yet another "shining gem" to place on the presitigious loser shelf.

One Night at McCool's is a comedy with no comedy, that is so ridiculous and boring that it doesn't even begin to entertain. Matt Dillon, who starred in the funny There's Something About Mary (which is also about a group of men falling in love with the same woman), is the main character here, but the stupidity of his character unfortunately does not transfer to laughter. Liv Tyler, who blew audiences away in Armageddon (and who might reprise herself in the upcoming The Fellowship of the Ring), is sexy the entire film, but not really. Her sexiness is so fake and ludicrous, and her character is so shallow and manipulative that it really isn't a joy to watch her at all. Paul Reiser, John Goodman, and even the venerable Michael Douglas can't bring anything to this picture.

One Night at McCool's really is amazing. Even the worst movies I have seen have had some redeemable moments, like a funny scene or something. I didn't laugh once during the entire course of this film, and what is even more pitiful is that I could tell that the film was trying to be funny. The script is awful and the acting isn't much better.

One Night at McCool's is the worst movie of the year.
