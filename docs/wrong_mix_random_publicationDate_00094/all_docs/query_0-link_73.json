        "text": "The City of Toronto held a ceremony on Sunday morning honouring firefighters who lost their lives in the line of duty.\n\nThe service was held at Toronto Fire Services Station 334 at the Toronto Harbourfront and honoured 21 firefighters by adding their names to the Memorial Honour Roll.\n\nThe annual ceremony of remembrance was attended by Toronto firefighters, their friends and families, and included remarks and the laying of wreaths by Mayor John Tory and Toronto Fire Chief Matthew Pegg.\n\n“They gave their lives in service to others, most of whom were complete strangers,” said Pegg. “I am fully confident that each of these firefighters, whose names are engraved on our monument would explain that they were just simply doing their job.\n\n“He was a great dad, great firefighter,” said Joanna – one of many family members of fallen firefighters who attended the service. She was there to pay tribute to Robert Alfred Chalmers, who died in November 2020 from an occupationally caused cancer.\n\n“We weren’t able to have a funeral for him in 2020 because of COVID, so this really means quite a lot to us – and I’m sure to every family that’s here.”\n\nChalmers widow was on hand as well, clutching her late husband’s helmet, reminiscing about his work and the man he was.\n\n“It was a great job, he loved it,” said Joan Chalmers. “All the guys that he worked with were all friends, we were all friends. We used to get together Christmas and New Years and have parties …It was just beautiful.”\n\n“They were brave and it was a difficult job and they took a great deal of pride in it,” added Joanna.\n\nThe city says there have been 319 firefighters who have died on duty since 1848.\n\n21 fallen firefighters added to the Memorial Honour Roll on June 12, 2022"
