        "text": "It’s been almost 30 years since William Gibson’s debut novel, Neuromancer, struck a chord with readers and won science fiction’s “triple crown” – the Hugo, Nebula and Philip K. Dick awards. Neuromancer popularized the concept of cyberspace (a word Gibson coined) long before the ubiquity of the Internet and virtual technologies. Often referred to as a “noir prophet,” Gibson is credited with predicting the rise of reality TV, video games and the Internet.\n\nBy the age of 12 Gibson had dreamed of becoming a science fiction writer, but it wasn’t until he enrolled in a science fiction literature course at UBC that he first attempted to write it. Although his first short story was published, Gibson didn’t seriously pursue writing until several years later. He assumed that the genre had become too inherently conservative to welcome the literary and pop influences he hoped to bring to it.\n\nClearly, his fears were unfounded.\n\nGibson is the author of nine novels, co‑author of one, and has also written screenplays and non‑fiction. He is lauded for breaking the science fiction mold and has been hailed as one of the most important and influential novelists of the past two decades.\n\nHe lives in Vancouver with his wife, Deborah, BA’74, MA’76, PhD’11.\n\nWhat is your most prized possession?\n\nI’d be terrified to have one, actually.\n\nWho was your childhood hero?\n\nSherlock Holmes.\n\nDescribe the place you most like to spend time.\n\nIf I could be anywhere, effortlessly, instantly, for two hours, once a year, I’d probably keep going back to Tokyo.\n\nWhat was the last thing you read?\n\nThe Teleportation Accident, by Ned Beauman, a novel.\n\nWhat or who makes you laugh out loud?\n\nPerfect strangers on Twitter, often as not.\n\nWhat’s the most important lesson you ever learned?\n\nThe fundamental undesirability of ranking things, including life lessons.\n\nWhat’s your idea of the perfect day?\n\nOne with my wife, without appointments. Except, possibly, a nice lunch.\n\nWhat was your nickname at school?\n\nNothing ever stuck, fortunately.\n\nWhat would be the title of your biography?\n\nThat would be up to my biographer, I suppose.\n\nIf a genie granted you one wish, what would it be?\n\nFor more of my fellow humans to accept that our species is responsible for global warming. I’d settle for about 80%.\n\nWhat item have you owned for the longest time?\n\nProbably some small cast‑metal trucks my father gave me as a child.\n\nWhat is your latest purchase?\n\nA large bag of quite expensive, super‑clumping cat litter.\n\nWhom do you most admire (living or dead) and why?\n\nThat ranking thing again. I don’t really think that way. I admire Jorge Luis Borges, but then I admire Elmore Leonard... I think more in terms of galaxies than lists.\n\nWhat would you like your epitaph to say?\n\nI wouldn’t want an epitaph. They’re like tattoos for the dead. Or monogrammed shirts. Name and dates, please!\n\nIf you could invent something, what would it be?\n\nSomething inexpensive, that makes the foulest water potable.\n\nIn which era would you most like to have lived, and why?\n\nThe past is better enjoyed as a tourist than as a resident, I imagine.\n\nWhat are you afraid of?\n\nFundamentalism. Of any sort whatever.\n\nName the skill or talent you would most like to have.\n\nCooking.\n\nWhich famous person (living or dead) do you think (or have you been told) you most resemble?\n\nI used to think I looked a bit like Samuel Beckett, but it’s getting harder to see.\n\nWhat is your pet peeve?\n\nThe inability to see that one’s own culture informs so much of what one sees that that is, in effect, the majority of what one sees."
