        "text": "We now conclude “Breaking News: 1923.” As the Lloyd Loar F-5s reach 100 years of age, I created these episodes to celebrate that milestone. I hope you have enjoyed reading and perhaps have new insight into the creation of the Master Model Instruments, and a better understanding of the men and women who built and/or played them.\n\nI wish to thank my faithful readers, and I am grateful for those who have replied with encouragement and/or information, and am especially grateful to those who sent photos and/or stories about their mandolins. I want to thank and acknowledge Roger Siminoff, who has just published his landmark book, “The Life and Work of Lloyd Allarye Loar.” Mr. Siminoff has been deeply involved with this topic for over half a decade, and continues to search for clearer understanding. I wish to thank our foreign correspondent, Mr. Stephen Gilchrist of Lake Gnotuck, Australia, for his keen insight into the most important primary source of all, the instruments themselves; Jeff Foxall, former Walter Kaye Bauer student, for documents and stories about his mentor; Randy Wood, who has, on countless occasions, allowed me to watch as he performed surgery on some of these instruments; and a big thanks to Scott Tichenor for his support and for sharing my episodes with his readers on Mandolin Cafe. Finally, I wish to thank the noted author and editor, Dr. Andrea Deyrup, MD., PhD., for casting an eye on my text and offering suggestions and corrections. To be clear, any mistakes that remain are mine and mine alone. I will now say goodbye until early next year when I plan to return with “Breaking News: 1924.” —Tony Williamson, December 20, 2023.\n\nWhat actually happened? Again, we are looking “through the glass darkly,” due to the lack of accurate records extant, and the primary source materials are as obscure as they are diverse. Also, none of the distinguished modern authors on the subject agrees on how events unfolded. After exhaustive search through various city directories, articles in Music Reports, Cadenza and Crescendo Magazines and many, many newspapers articles, we offer this report.\n\nThere were many factors at play on the world stage. The nation was still reeling from the pandemic of 1917-1918; the deflationary recession of 1920-1922 contributed to record unemployment; during World War I immigrants had flooded into Ellis Island and at the end of the war soldiers returned expecting their old jobs back; united workers’ unions threatened shutdowns and even riot; Prohibition continued to have a negative financial impact on legal establishments; organized crime in the North and the Ku Klux Klan in the south nurtured fear; easy access to new types of music by radio and phonograph recordings led to changes in musical taste, especially for a younger generation; and, innovations from Vega, Paramount, Washburn (formerly Lyon and Healy) and other musical instrument manufacturers offered stiff competition. All these factors led to red ink in the ledgers at Gibson.\n\nIn the autumn of 1923, in the most dramatic shake-up since they sent Orville home in 1906, the Board of Directors under the leadership of Judge John W. Adams hired Harry L. Ferris from Waukesha, Wisconsin, as “Secretary and General Manager,” and they changed the title of the corporation to “Gibson, Inc.,” dropping the words “Mandolin and Guitar.” In what some employees may have viewed as a painful stroke, they asked for the resignation of former General Manager and founding member Lewis A. Williams. In an extremely curious redundancy, Clifford V. Buttelman, formerly the advertising manager, was also given the title “General Manager.” Coinciding with this move, Lloyd Loar’s title was increased from “Acoustical Engineer” to “Superintendent and Acoustical Engineer” and sales and advertisement responsibilities were added to his role. Also, around the same time, they hired Guy Hart as accountant (a man who would figure prominently in the post-Loar era). (All these events are documented in articles in Music Trade Review except we do not have confirmation of the exact date of Ferris’ hiring, but the 1924 Kalamazoo City Directory, compiled at the end of 1923, lists him as resident and lists both Buttelman and Ferris as “Genl Mgr”)\n\nFerris has been lauded as “the man who saved Gibson.” Of course, the evidence that Gibson was in debt at the beginning of 1923 and was turning a profit during the Ferris reign supports the idea that hiring Ferris was an economically sound move. During the recession of 1920-1922, Gibson under Lewis Williams and Lloyd Loar poured energy and money into innovation rather than struggle with a depressed market. The fruits of their labors, like the luxury-priced F-5 mandolin, left the factory in surprising numbers in 1923. But those sales were either to artists, teachers or players, most of whom took advantage of payment plans. The actual remuneration for these innovations trickled in over time, and it wasn’t until 1924 that the project began to show profit. At that point, Ferris took all the the credit for the increase in solvency.\n\nWhat did Mr. Ferris actually do? He went on a cost cutting rampage, with the costliest project, the F-5, firmly in his cross-hairs. During October and November of 1923, large batches of mandolins that were signed in 1924 were being stamped. Under Ferris, discrimination toward choosing only the best materials for the F-5 seems to have been compromised. For example, in the ’24 mandolins, we occasionally find spruce tops not book-matched; mildly figured and even slab-cut backs; and orphan parts from discontinued ideas, like 3-piece necks and bodies with side-bindings. The amount paid to Geib and Schaefer for the “Faultless 440 SP” F-5 case was reduced by discontinuing the emerald green silk-plush lining (SP) and returning to the red velour of the pre-Loar era. The cost of the case to consumers remained the same. Projects that may have been on the table for development, like the A-5 mandolin and the 10-string mandolin-viola, were scrapped. Lewis Williams, whose early interest in electronics is documented in this journal, may have teamed up with Lloyd Loar to broach the idea of electric instruments, but Ferris would have none of that. The H-5 mandola and the K-5 mandocello were relegated to limited production. Fern inlays, originally earmarked for H-5s, were put into F-5s. The K-5 mandocello became a guitar. Ivoroid binding was replaced with plain white plastic. Virzi-tone producers already in stock were put into mandolins without waiting for a custom order.\n\nRick: Mike, when you came here to take lessons, you said maybe early 30s, it was in the house out back?\n\nMike: Yes, Mr. Griffith had that for his studio. His teaching was all done in that little house in the back. His wife and his two sisters, they did their teaching in the house. Mrs. Griffith taught harp and piano and Mrs. Dobbs and Mrs. Bedard taught the stringed instruments. In those days, I would get off the street car and come up the driveway and go to the house out back. I would walk up the driveway and Mr. Griffith would be waiting for me and we would walk out back. So, I didn’t get to come into the house as often as some [students did].\n\nRick: Did you come once a week?\n\nMike: Yes, once a week… and I was very unhappy to pay a dollar and a half an hour. My former teacher only charged a buck! And I had a 50% increase and I had to ride clear across Atlanta…this was the end of nowhere back then…a long way from where I lived. I thought that was an outrageous fee. My Dad said, “boy, that man’s expensive…a buck and a half an hour!’\n\nOwner: Is there any truth to the rumor that they only accepted cash?\n\nMike: That was the only way I ever paid.\n\nOwner: Did you pay them every time?\n\nMike. Every time. Yes.\n\nOwner: I have heard stories that every evening they would go to the room upstairs and have tea and split the take.\n\nMike: Yes, split the take! (laughter). Could well have been. But I know that was a lot of money. And that mandolin he played was $250 bucks!\n\nRick: Is that what you paid for yours?\n\nMike: I think it was. I bought that in the thirties. I bought it through Mr. Griffith. I pleaded with my Dad to buy it. It was a lot of money. But that was the going price for an F-5 back then. I think they are a little bit more now.\n\n(laughter)\n\nTony: Did Mrs. Griffith have a special mandolin that was built like an F-5 with f-holes but didn’t have the scroll and points? Did you ever see that mandolin?\n\nMike: I don’t remember ever seeing that. I would have remembered a special mandolin. Something like that would have stood out in my mind.\n\nTony. This school was a rare situation here in the South. There were teachers all over the Northeast who were Gibson dealers, but a mandolin community of this scope in this part of the country was really quite remarkable.\n\nRick; I think Mr. Griffith was one of the leading Gibson dealers.\n\nMike: Mr. Griffith had a beautiful F-5 mandolin himself. Such tone. It had a wonderful tone.\n\nRick: This wood work in here is so beautiful. Oh look, here in the parlor. There’s a sign that says “Griffith School”\n\nMike: We did recitals here in the house. This is where the performers would perform, in this room. The musicians would set up in here in front of the fireplace and mantle.\n\nRick: You played in one of his groups?\n\nMike: Oh yeah. We played in one of his groups, used to play in here, and we had a radio program. At one of the radio stations. We had a theme song… [Hums a tune]\n\nTony: When you played in here, how many instruments…musicians were playing?\n\nMike: Oh you know, solos, duets, quartets, sometimes even more would play. As many as fifteen or twenty. As many as we could squeeze in. This was not the stage for the full orchestra, of course.\n\nTony: Do you remember where that would have been?\n\nMike: No. I have no idea.\n\nOwner: I think there was also a school downtown.\n\nMike: There may have been a location on Peach Street, but this is the only location I was familiar with.\n\nOwner: I found this photo and some music.\n\nMike: (points to the photo): That’s me.\n\nOwner: That’s you?\n\nMike. Yes, I had hair then. I’m taking chemotherapy and lost my hair…I used to have hair… (pause)\n\nMike: …and there’s “My Old Kentucky Home.” We used to play that.\n\nThe group walks upstairs.\n\nMike: I only came up here rarely, but I know this is where Mrs. Dobbs taught. And this next room, Mr. Bedard taught mandocello and his wife L’Ella was over here. She could play everything.\n\nOwner: Look how thick these walls are. And every room has a magnificent fireplace.\n\nMike: This was a fine old home in its day.\n\nWe walk over to the window and see the cottage out back.\n\nOwner: I had been told that the Doctor that built this house lived there while the house was being built.\n\nMike: I always thought that those might have been the servants’ quarters in the old days.\n\nOwner: Evidently not. That’s one part of the history I am vague on.\n\nRick: Mike, were you a teenager when you took from Mr. Griffith?\n\nMike. Yes, I was 16 or 17.\n\nOwner: There is a pull down ladder to the attic and there is some sort of container in there. Something was up there for a long time. Yeah, we can go up there.\n\nMike: I don’t think I can go up there.\n\nTony climbs the ladder. “Maybe there’s another Lloyd Loar up here.” There is a large rectangular container made of a dense hardwood that may have been walnut. Inside were partitions that would have perfectly fitted cases for various size Gibson instruments. On the top right front edge was embossed “Gibson Co. / Kalamazoo, Michigan.” It was empty.\n\nWe go back downstairs and then to the outside. We are joined by another mandolin playing friend, Hal Jeanes.\n\nOwner: There was a deck here. It’s pretty much gone now, we would like to rebuild it.\n\nMike: Do you have a key to Mr. Griffith’s studio? I’d like to take one look in there, to remember how it looked. I spent a lot more time in there than I did the house.\n\nRick: She found the key, she’s got it open!\n\nWe go inside.\n\nMike: This is where we sat for our lessons. There was another door over here.\n\nTony: Mr. Griffith’s studio. Amazing feeling here. Was there a room here where he kept his music, photos … Look, here’s some trunks.\n\n(The trunks were empty)\n\nRick: No Loars in there. (laughter)\n\nTony: When Mr. Griffith gave you your lessons, did he use his F-5?\n\nMike: Oh yeah. We’d play, he’d play with me, show me. I saw it every week.\n\nTony: Did that make you want to have an F-5?\n\nMike: You bet! and I finally got one. And we would play them together.\n\nOwner: If we were real quiet, I wonder if we could still hear it reverberating.\n\nMike: You’d have to be awful quiet. Awful quiet. I don’t think we can get that quiet.\n\nNote: I am deeply indebted to Rick Taylor for his support of this project and for preserving this conversation; to Allen McCanless for help restoring photos; Steve Gilchrist for his support of the project and especially his amazing work on Mr. Griffith’s F-5; and Charlie Rappaport, who, as I recall, helped set up the tour but could not come due to his work schedule.\n\nWe know of 139 Master Model instruments that were produced and signed by Lloyd Loar by September 1 of 1923. Based on our examination of photographs, letters, documents and publications, we have identified 57 musicians who acquired those instruments new. Some were well-known professionals, like Dave Apollon, C. C. Rowden, Clyde Doerr and Loretta Tabaka; many were artist/teacher/agents like William Griffith, Marguerite Lavery and T. A. Miles, who not only received their personal F5s, but populated their area with countless Gibson instruments. Some were entrepreneurs, like Dennis E. Hartnett of New York City, who promoted “all things Loar” through his chain of stores, the “National Music Studios.” Some, like immigrant Loreto Chichiarelli, simply wanted the greatest happiness possible during a difficult time of life. By far, most were like Clarence Bass of Peoria, who did not play outside his home town. In fact, we only know his story from the memorabilia left in his instrument case. Considering that these local players are very difficult to trace, we think we have identified only a portion of those who acquired these mandolins in 1923 “with the smell of new varnish.” We find it reasonable to conclude that the Master Model was very well received, and, at least in the first year of production, remarkably successful. It is likely that many were sold by Gibson at wholesale prices to or through artist/teacher/agents, and it is possible that others were delivered with extended payment terms. We cannot speak to the financial welfare of the Gibson company as a result of this venture, as we have not found adequate costs/sales records, but we can conclude that any failure on the part of Gibson to be commercially successful during this time was not because the mandolin-playing public rejected the F-5. Quite the contrary, it appears that a significant number of the leaders of the mandolin community embraced the Master Models wholeheartedly and even more amateurs stepped up to make that purchase. In future installments, we hope to tell the stories of many of these musicians. In this episode, we profile Dennis Hartnett, Loreto Chichiarelli and Clarence Bass, three of the first generation of Loar owners.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Loreto Chichiarelli packed his mandolin and sailed to New York City just ahead of the horrific war that engulfed Europe. Born on December 13, 1897, in the hills overlooking the sea near Rosciolo, Italy, he grew up half way between Rome and Naples, two cities synonymous with the mandolin. Arriving in New York City on March of 1914, all his US documents list his occupation as “musician.” He was welcomed into his uncle’s family home at 216 Lookout Avenue in Butler, Pennsylvania. Thanks to Percy Lichtenfels and Russell Truit, that area was a hotbed of Gibson enthusiasts, and we suspect Chichiarelli had his first taste of the American mandolin there. Wandering minstrel that he was, he made his way to Little Italy in Chicago, after which he discovered the little town of Meredosia, Illinois, with its mussel beds and buttons factories. Continuing west, he landed a position teaching music at the Sacred Heart College in Denver, Colorado in 1917. Unfortunately, politics caught up with him even there, and he was drafted into the US army. He was mustered in at Camp Lewis in Tacoma, Washington, in 1918 and assigned to the 75th Infantry. During his time there he contracted tuberculosis. He was discharged from the US Army on January 13, 1920, 100% disabled, and was sent to the Phoenix Sanitarium in Maricopa, Arizona, where he registered (as a Democrat) to vote on June 2, 1920, before moving to a sanitarium in Fitzsimmons, Colorado. On June 30, 1920, he married his nurse, Anna Daniels, in Denver. We like to think that with Anna, he had found a modicum of happiness, which was indeed complete in the summer of 1923, when a mandolin arrived from Kalamazoo. He wrote to Gibson, “I have received my Gibson Master Model Mandolin, style F-5, and I am certainly proud to own such an instrument. It is a wonder.” Based on the timing of his letter, he would most likely have gotten a mandolin from the July 9, 1923 batch. In 1924, he and Anna moved to Tucson, and in March, he was finally granted naturalization as a US citizen. On May 18, 1925, with Anna and his mandolin by his side, he succumbed to a pulmonary hemorrhage brought on by his tuberculosis. Funeral services were held at the All Saints Church in Tuscon, and Anna accompanied his body back to Meredosia where he was laid to rest. He was only 27.\n\nTo understand what awaited the Gibsonians in Shelbyville, we have examined the national sensation, the “Mer Rouge Murders.” On August 24, 1922, in Bastrop, Louisiana, Samuel F. Richards and Filmore Watt Daniels were kidnapped by members of the Mer Rouge Ku Klux Klan and were never seen again. Almost a month later, two bodies were discovered in nearby Lake LaFourche. Since all the local authorities were members of the Klan, the United States Attorney in Louisiana sent A. E. Farland of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, to conduct an investigation. Agent Farland became convinced that the bodies were Richards and Daniels, and, in a detailed report, observed that the men had been “horribly tortured and then lynched.” Farland also uncovered evidence of numerous other crimes perpetrated by the KKK in that area, ranging from election fraud and assault to murder. The U.S. Attorney turned the case over to the Louisiana Attorney General who filed over 250 indictments under Section 241 of the Enforcement Act of 1870, in addition to murder charges for five of the Klansmen and a “Conspiracy to Commit Murder” charge for the man who allegedly ordered the murders, Captain J. K. Skipwell, leader of the Mer Rouge KKK. Over the next year, litigation dragged on. The New York Times published over 100 articles calling for justice. According to Times, Richards and Daniels, who were white, were targeted by the Klan because Daniels had a common law wife who was African American and that they were vocal opponents of the activities, authority and power of the Klan in that county. In their defense, the Klan sent speakers on public relations tours across the country. (“Murder At Mer Rouge” by Hannah Bethann Peterson, Honors Programs, Texas A & M University, April, 2004; “Mer Rouge Terror,” New York Times, November 27, 1922; and “Louisiana Klan Goes On Trial Today”, January 6, 1923).\n\nWhen the Gibsonians finally arrived at the Shelbyville Chautauqua Auditorium, they found Forest Park in an uproar. Their afternoon show had been usurped by impassioned speakers, all high level members of the Ku Klux Klan. Four thousand people filled the auditorium to capacity and another six thousand, many in hoods and robes, pressed in from outside. Heavy rains added to the confusion. Opponents of the Klan were forcibly evicted. The keynote speaker was Captain J. K. Skipwell himself.\n\nWho got on board in January of 1945? Fiddler Chubby Wise and bassist Howard Watts (“Cedric Rainwater”), were both from Florida and may have encouraged Bill to expand his range in that state. Dave “Stringbeans” Akemen (later changed to “Stringbean”), from Eastern Kentucky, was Monroe’s first banjo player and had been with him since 1942. Originally from New Mexico, Wilene “Billie” Russell Forrester, whom Bill introduced as “Sally Ann, the Kentucky Songbird,” sang and played accordion all through the war years. (Billie was the wife of champion fiddler Howard “Howdy” Forrester, who left Monroe’s band to join the Navy on March 6, 1943. He endured bitter fighting in the Pacific while serving on the USS Pennsylvania, and was finally discharged on November 21, 1945 after the ship was torpedoed off Okinawa that August. Monroe gave him his job back when he returned). Clyde Moody had been Bill’s duet partner all through the war, and had acquired a good following of his own. But when the recording ban was lifted, Moody made his own deal with Columbia Records and was scheduled to head to Chicago just a few days after the Bluegrass Boys. To fill the significant loss of Moody on guitar and lead vocal, Monroe hired Georgian Tex Willis, who had been recommended by Wise and Watts. Curly Bradshaw joined on second guitar on some numbers and did solo spots with his “mouth harp” in the style of African American harmonica master Deford Bailey. This is the band that Bill would take to Chicago for that first landmark Columbia session, and one imagines musical chemistry congealing on this tour. In addition to the Bluegrass Boys, Zeke Clements was along as well. He shared the bill with Monroe, promoting his new hit, “Smoke On The Water.” “Grand Pappy” George Wilkerson and comedians Jam-Up and Honey added their minstrel antics. Thus, Monroe was able present a full in-person “Grande Ole Opry” experience to audiences throughout the South.\n\nIn all probability, it happened in Miami. The stars lined up for an immeasurable impact on both Bill Monroe and the F-5 mandolin. On January 10, they arrived at Burdine Stadium, which filled the area between 6th and 3rd Streets in Little Havana just west of the Miami River. The first task was to erect the tent and arrange the bleachers and stage. Light rain commenced that night, and the temperature went down to 43 degrees Fahrenheit. It was a chilly night for folks in Miami, but they must have been snug inside the tent listening to their favorite Opry stars live for the first time. Without doubt, Monroe treated the audience to “Muleskinner Blues” and other powerhouse numbers that had made him a household name. The band was experiencing the excitement of a new configuration with the talented Tex Willis stepping into Clyde Moody’s place. As Moody was on the Opry with Monroe as late as December 2, this was most likely one of Willis’s first tours as a Bluegrass Boy. At some point he introduced a style of rhythm guitar playing that emphasized a strong back-beat. This perfectly complemented Monroe’s fast blues compositions like “Rocky Road Blues.” (Music scholars often cite this sound as an important root of Rock ’N Roll). We have no idea where the travelers found lodging for the night, but late 1940s Bluegrass Boy Jim Eanes told this author “he never saw the inside of a luxury hotel when he was with Monroe.” At best they might have arranged an inexpensive hotel or boarding house in Little Havana, which would have seemed luxurious after surviving on cat naps in the car. The morning of the 11th, they woke to a beautiful January day with a high of 64 that afternoon. If anyone wanted to get out for a walk, that morning or early afternoon would have been the best opportunity. Monroe often mailed correspondence, and the Main Post Office was located on the east side of the river on the block at 1st and 4th Streets. To go there from the stadium area, he would have walked across the bridge at 5th street and then turn down to 4th. There were any number of grand hotels along 4th, 5th and Biscayne: The Alcazar, the Floridian, and at 258 NE 4th Street, the brand new Liberty Hotel, just past the Post Office toward Bay Front Park.\n\nPlace had performed on the same venues as Lloyd Loar on a number of occasions, most recently in Atlanta in 1921 and New York in 1922. Place, like Loar, had played Gibson mandolins since the ‘teens. Most likely he would have known Loar, but whether or not they had had conversations about the new development in American mandolins we may never know. He was also a colleague of Walter Kaye Bauer, and may have seen the F-5 Walter had played in 1922. In any case, in the summer of 1923, he purchased F-5 73676, with the June 13th signature date. That instrument became his preferred mandolin for his entire career, and the Gibson catalog boasted that he used it exclusively. By the 1930s, he had moved Place Music to a larger building at 1350 Narragansett Blvd. in Cranston, Rhode Island, which became a Mecca for all stringed instrument endeavors, and the legacy of that center can still felt in that part of the country today. In addition to teaching, performing and procuring instruments for students and colleagues, “The William Place Method For The Mandolin, Volume I,” published by Joe Nicomede in 1934, became one of the most popular mandolin instruction manuals in America, with volumes two and three following in 1936. The method was kept in print through the 1950s by Belwin Mills Publishing Co., of Melville, NY., and can still be found in used book stores (and on eBay). Through talent, industry and business acumen, William and Vivian were able to leave public life in 1947 and retire to Martha’s Vineyard. For us today, Place commands a distinct “place” in the history of the American mandolin as only he joins Dave Apollon as a first generation Loar F-5 owner with a significant recording career. He made a number of records for Victor, beginning with a session in April of 1913 that yielded his most popular 10-inch disc, “Sing, Smile, Slumber,” available for 75 cents in record stores from Tampa to Vancouver. He continued to record for Victor, as well as for Columbia and Edison, and though his sales never competed with the great Samuel Siegal, he was constantly showcasing Gibson mandolins. The Gennett session of 1923 most certainly features F-5 #73676. Accompanied by Vivian on piano, here with the brand new F-5, is William Place, Jr. and the “Spanish Caprice!”\n\nF-5 73481 heralds a shift in the nature of the F-5. As the “Gibson Cremona Brown” darkens, so does the tone. The F-5s created earlier in 1923 all feature tightly focused projection and crisp clear highs. In late May, there seems to have been a conscious effort to begin a movement toward a darker, richly textured bass, greater complexity overall, while still keeping the characteristic power in all frequencies.\n\nAs the Gibsonians were not scheduled to begin their summer tour until July, Lloyd Loar was on duty at the Gibson factory in Kalamazoo during May and June of 1923. The Gibson contingent had just returned from the Guild Convention in Washington, DC (end of April, 1923), and as quite a few of the attendees of the convention became F-5 owners, there must have been optimism toward the project, if not an outright mandate to produce more of that model. It is also reasonable to assume that in addition to orders, there was feedback to be considered. Herman Von Bernewitz, a student of Walter Kaye Bauer, attended the convention as a member of the Nordica Club, the hosts of the convention and the orchestra that boldly performed Beethoven’s 5th Symphony on mandolin and banjo as the finale. Years later, Von Bernewitz recalled meeting Lloyd Loar at the convention and inspecting several F-5s there. He commented to us when we interviewed him in the late 1980s: “I told him they were too bright. I much preferred the sound of my F-4.” As an aside, Von Bernewitz and 7 others left the Nordica Club after the convention to form the Tacoma Mandoleers in hopes of adding lighter selections into their repertoire. The Mandoleers organization has endured, and are still performing 100 years later!\n\nIn Episode 4: Shape Brace To This,” we discussed the woodworkers of 1922. While most were still at work in 1923, two longtime Gibson workers seem to have moved into greater roles and may have led the team in new directions. One was George Altermatt, who, in 1925 became foreman and filed a patent for the Mastertone banjo tone ring (he is often attributed as the inventor of the Ball Bearing Ring, but the ball bearings were part of a patent by Victor Kraske and were already in use on the trapdoor banjo in 1922).\n\nWe also like to think that the man with the labels was an important ally to Loar. There has long been a controversy around the question of when and where the labels were attached. In our previous episode, we presented the theory that by identifying the person who filled in the serial number labels on the F-5, we may be able to create more understanding of the process of construction. This led us to examining the World War I draft cards from all the Gibson workers. Those cards, required for all men 18 to 45, were filled in by the applicant in cursive, thus giving a perfect handwriting sample! We eliminated workers who could not read and write English; then we found cards for over twenty-five woodworkers, six assemblers, twelve stringers, four finishers, two draftsmen, and a few foremen and managers (Loar, Johnstone and Lewis Williams, for example). (We are happy to share all these handwriting samples with interested parties). Sadly we do not have writing examples from the older employees such as Ted McHugh and Victor Kraske who were well past draft age, nor do we have any samples from the female staff. However, after closely examining all those handwriting samples, only one fits the flowing tail of the letter “F”; this sample also fits the slant and curve of the numbers. So now, we offer the identity of the man with the pencil.\n\nThe first Master Models appeared in 1922. It had been a long time coming, the result of a team of talented people infused with the work ethic that was often a hallmark of that era. Lloyd Loar had brought ideas and innovation as well as aggressive supervision and a demand for perfection; Lewis Williams, General Manager and founding member of Gibson Mandolin and Guitar Company, supported such innovation and was an inventor himself; in the factory, the foreman Victor Kraske had already put a violin-type f-hole into a Gibson mandolin almost twenty years earlier and we suspect he may have been a key element in the creation of the new mandolin. Superb craftsmen, many of them immigrants, commanded space at the workbenches: Hans Larsen, Adrian Glerum, John Patterson, John Voisine, and George Altermatt to name a few; Ted McHugh had moved from his position as foreman to construction engineer; Henry T. Reeves, draftsman, worked alongside McHugh; machine operator Joseph P. Curtiss may have played a key role; and Fred Miller and Cornelius Kivet, former painters in the automotive industry, created the “Gibson Cremona” varnish finish. (For a more complete list of woodworkers, machinist, draftsmen, finishers and inventors who worked for Gibson during the Loar Era, see “Breaking News 1922, April 5, 1922, ‘Shape Brace To This.’”) In the office, stenographer/musicians such as Dorothy Campbell and Nell VerCies helped design and reproduce advertisements, such as the one above, and kept up the correspondence with the teacher/agents across the country. (By night, these multi-talented young women performed on Gibson instruments in the all-girl orchestra, “The Gibson, Melody Maids.”) In a final operation unique in the annals of music manufacturing, The Gibsonians, professional musicians led by Lloyd Loar and including such brilliant instrumentalists as Walter Kaye Bauer, carried the first of these new instruments throughout the mid-west and Canada, playing over 100 engagements, testing, trying and approving them under the most extreme conditions. (See Breaking News 1922, August 4, 1922, “On The Road”) The Master Model was now ready for “the world to hear.”\n\nWhat did this mean for the professional mandolin player? The traditionalists continued playing the music as before, which was based on European tradition. Many agreed with the Illinois Vigilance Association, expressing rage at the loss of moral integrity and predicted a quick demise for the “noise” called jazz and a tragic end to those who participated in the primitive gyrations. Virtuosi like Samuel Segal and Giuseppe Pettine found audiences in Europe more receptive to their performances.\n\nOn the other hand, for many musicians, the situation created unprecedented opportunities for employment for those willing to take a walk on the wild side. Of course, this meant embracing the new sounds, and learning to play them, and in many cases, for the sake of volume, switching from mandolin to the tenor banjo, or mandolin banjo. Gibson stalwart, James P. Johnstone, was an early proponent of the new sounds and sought to bring other plectrum players along, finding a place for it in the existing system of mandolin clubs. His emphasis on banjo music and rhythm earned him the nickname, “Jumping Jazz Johnstone.” In an article for the Crescendo, Johnstone explains: “Jazz playing is nothing more or less than ragtime or syncopation only in a more intensified form. The various styles of syncopation are learned and then applied to any given melody. The book that I have written and published is, I believe, the only book of its type entirely devoted to jazz playing, and I’ve tried to illustrate, as far as can be done with printers ink, all the styles of syncopation and their method of application. The article covers the subject more or less without the aid of printed music. Jazz playing after all, is just stuttering, and the more you can stutter over a melody the more you were jazzing it. Foxtrots in 4/4 time are best adapted to jazz playing as there are more whole and half notes to stutter over.” James P. Johnstone, Crescendo, July 1920.\n\nOff to San Francisco by train, then ship to Australia, the Pacific Islands (where she worried incessantly about the distress of the humidity on her violin) and finally, South Africa in 1910, where she earned £10,000, reportedly the highest fee ever paid a violinist for a single tour.\n\nOften her diminutive size caused reviewers to refer to her as frail, and point out the contrast between her appearance and the majesty of the sounds coming from the violin. Everywhere her performance was praised and it was almost always pointed out that the sound of her violin was “magnificent,” “heard in every seat, even in the back of the third balcony.”\n\nWhat does Marie Hall and the “Viotti” Stradivarius violin have to do with Lloyd Loar and the F-5?\n\nOn December 18, 1905, Lloyd Loar’s younger brother Jonathan died at the Loar family home in Lewiston, Illinois. Lloyd left college and went to be with his family during this tragic time. Oberlin records show that he did not graduate in the spring of 1906 with the rest of his class, nor is there any indication he came back to school after New Year’s Day, 1906. By the spring of 1906, he was on tour full time with the Fisher Shipp Concert Company.\n\nAt the same time as the passing of the 17-year-old Jonathan Loar, in late December of 1905, Miss Fisher Shipp of Brookfield, Missouri, was absent from a number of engagements with the Oilenbein Male Quartet with whom she had appeared throughout the mid-west for the previous three years. She was already a regional star, and well known in Missouri society. By early 1906 Miss Shipp had signed with the Columbia Concert Company in Chicago, and had invited Lloyd Loar, mandola, and Freda Bethig, violin, to join her as they performed in many of the same towns and venues as Marie Hall.\n\nIn 1905, Victor Kraske was in Chicago building banjos and mandolins under his own name, and was associated with Orville Gibson. In 1906 Kraske left Chicago to work for Gibson in Kalamazoo when the first f-hole Gibson Artist Mandolin was built (See Shape Brace to This, Episode 4). What inspired him to put f-holes in one of Orville Gibson’s designs?\n\nIn a departure from our preferred adherence to primary source information, we cannot resist the following conjectures.\n\nWere Victor Kraske and Lloyd Loar—and perhaps even Orville Gibson— in the audience when Miss Hall took the stage in Chicago in 1905? Were they stunned with the power, tone and projection of the instrument? Did they meet her backstage for a chance to inspect the “Viotti” Stradivarius? Did this amazing instrument and brilliant young virtuosa inspire Loar to embark on a twenty-year journey to excel as musician and create a better mandolin as acoustical engineer?\n\nNow, consider Mrs. Andersons’ dinner party. At 10:30 pm. on February 5, 1906, thirty guests were treated to a private house concert by none other than Marie Hall. The hostess was Mrs. Ardell Anderson of Kansas City, Missouri, and her guest list included the crême de la crême of society. At midnight, they all dined in the grandest style. Shipp had already performed for President Roosevelt and had tremendous social standing in Missouri. This was a short distance from Miss Shipp’s home, where her 1906 concert group were most likely already rehearsing. Was Fisher Shipp one of the guests at Mrs. Anderson’s party? Were Lloyd Loar and Freda Bethig there?\n\nViolin makers Giuseppe and Giovanni Virzi from St. Agata, Messina, Sicily, learned their craft in the shop of their father, Rosario Virzi, master wood carver, cabinet maker and musical instrument maker. Younger brother Giovanni, who had made and played violins and mandolins in Sicily, arrived in New York City on May 4, 1907, and, according to immigration records, Giuseppe and his family were already settled there. On March 25, 1914, after a wood-buying trip to Italy, Giuseppe returned to New York on the ship “Hamburg.” At that point, the brothers began working in earnest at their workshop at 503 Fifth Avenue. They became celebrated for their high-quality violins modeled after a Stradivarius loaned to them by a “Mr. Betti.” They used old Italian wood exclusively and made an oil varnish of their own formula in either golden yellow or reddish yellow color. On July 30, 1920, the News Journal of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was first to announce the invention of a secondary vibrating surface to be suspended inside a violin top, which created a “striking quality of sound” even when installed in “ordinary, inexpensive instruments.” A US patent for a “Tone Amplifier for Stringed Instruments, Giuseppe Virzi, inventor,” was applied for October 21, 1920, and granted April 11, 1923. It is unclear exactly when Lloyd Loar became interested in their work, but by 1922 he was experimenting with the device in mandolin family instruments. It seems possible that, like so many of the outsourced appointments of Gibson instruments, that the actual “Amplifier” for mandolin that Gibson used may have been made at the Virzi shop in New York and shipped to Kalamazoo complete with label with serial number and Virzi logo. In addition to installing the device in new mandolins, Gibson created a revolving door approach, installing and/or removing the Virzi in existing mandolins at a charge of $15 for each operation. Many instruments from this period on through the 1930s show evidence of having had the back sawn off to facilitate this procedure. In 1923, a “Gibson” violin was marketed. Except for “The Gibson” label, it is our understanding that it was an instrument built by the Virzi Brothers in New York. Gibson’s relationship with Virzi continued through 1927, three years after Loar had left the company to work in publishing in Boston."
