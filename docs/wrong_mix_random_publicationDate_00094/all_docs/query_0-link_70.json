He is survived by his loving wife, Frances; his sister, Jean and his brother, Jack; his three children and their spouses, Ron (Carey), Marny, and Warren (Filomena); his five grandchildren, Doug (Tracy), Todd, James, Stephanie and Dianna and his two great- grandchildren, Joshua and Elizabeth. He was very much loved by everyone in his family and was married to Frances for over 71 years. Bill was a Navigator with the RCAF in WWII and retired from business as the Vice-President of Claims for Travelers Canada (now Zurich). He loved curling, golf, fishing, sailing, and the game of football. Many thanks to the staff at Amica at Bayview and Gibson LTC at Steeles for their care and kindness. Cremation will be followed by a private memorial. Donations to Alzheimer's research are welcome."
