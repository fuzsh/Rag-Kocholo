We trust this finds you well and everything going nicely. We are keeping about as usual. This past year has been a fairly good one in respect of business. David started attending the University of Alberta this fall. He wants to get a B. of Com. degree, which will require 4 years study. He has had quite a bit of practicle experience in accountancy; he has helped in my office a lot in the past, and all last summer did accounting work for a pipe laying concern. Faith is taking her last years of High School (Grade XII) and is continuing her musical studies. She also teaches piano to a number of pupils. She is frequently asked to play for special events of one kind or another. Thus she keeps very busy.\n\nTommy and Danny are in Grades V and iV respectively. tommy likes astronomy and space exploration, and Danny is forever 'inventing' something! both are getting to be big boys. We want to say thank you for forwarding the legacy under Uncle Charle's will. We appreciated his thought and love. Will close now as I have a number of letters to write. We send our love to you and Charles and Barbara and her husband. Yours lovingly Hattie and David, David, Faith, Tommy and Danny\n\n1964\n\nCharles GIBSON setting off to Chestertons Estate Agents.

For I have had to fix up a meet with a sub editor that day in Westminster and as I shall be leading a group discussion in the evening must try and hold myself in or I shall be staggering around like an old man?! But I'll drop you a line soon after Xmas when I've recovered from Xmas with my grandchildren!\n\nIt will be a rather shadowed Xmas for you all. But need not be less happy and we shall be thinking of you and send our greetings for Xmas and the New Year. I am, this Xmas, economising on printed greetings for the first time ever! Tho' reluctantly - for it means letter writing 'at the double'. Our best wishes again to Barbara - tell her there is a gleam of hope for her as she is marrying a Yorkshireman.\n\n* They are the salt of the earth - though of course, their nature modesty and lack of pride in their county, inhibits them badly and they don't recognise it!\n\nYour Uncle Jack\n\n* This considered opinion due to my early ministry at Eastbrook Hall, Bradford\n\nMy Mum met my Dad 'Dick' skiing in Sauze d'Oulx, Italy in 1963. She was on the way to Cyprus with 'Mad Mave' from St Thomas's. They were to meet with Dorothy her mother in Cyprus. They took the wrong boat from Italy and Dad thinks they ended up in Albania! In Greece Mum met Alberto who owned Orange Groves, Dorothy liked Alberto. Dad used to drive down to Croydon every weekend from his job at Mintex Brake Liners. Mintex had arranged a crammer 'Dictaphone' course in German for Dad in Bradford as they had bought into a German company and wanted Dad to oversee their overseas operations. Dad crashed out of the course. When Dad met up with mum at Newton Solney in a music club they played a record 'Et Maintenant' by Charles Aznavour\n\nThey married in Addington, Croydon a year later. Dad was very soon put in his place, when he bought a house in Derbyshire at auction. She took one look at it and made him sell it on to the next highest bidder for a £50 loss!\n\n1963 St Thomas's Hospital B GIBSON S.R.N. on left\n\nThey used Big Ben as the ward clock\n\n1963 St Thomas's Hospital\n\n1962_CH_GIBSON_Kingswood_School_Obituary.pdf\n\n1962_Death_Certificate_CH_GIBSON.pdf\n\n1962_08_13_GIBSON_B_Certificate_Registered_Nurse.pdf\n\nCirca 1960 CH GIBSON\n\nCirca 1960 B GIBSON on holiday somewhere\n\n1960 B GIBSON at Mary Louise wedding\n\n1960 B working at 'St Thomas', Westminster.\n\n1960 On holiday in Yugoslavia with other nurses from 'St Thomas', Westminster.\n\n1960 B GIBSON at Iona\n\n1960 Iona Charles, Jennifer, CH, B GIBSON\n\n1960 Iona CH, Charles, B & cousin Jennifer (Jack GIBSON's daughter)\n\n1960 Iona Dorothy & Jennifer GIBSON\n\n1959_CH_GIBSON_Passenger_List_Liverpool_to_Colombo.pdf\n\nCirca 1959 Charles GIBSON with Sarah the boxer\n\n1959_Letter_Jack_GIBSON_to_CH_GIBSON_18_Aug.pdf\n\n47, Bruce Avenue, Worthing, Sussex. 14 Aug 1959\n\nDear Chas, Delighted to learn that you and family - less one - are having a good break at Cannes.\n\nMy only criticism - which please pass on with my love to Dorothy - is that I am just horrified at the callous and almost brutal way in which you are all leaving poor little Barbara on her lonesome here in England. It seems to me a cruel desertion by the side of which the incidents of the Musgroves? (was that the name of your neighbours so carelessly treated by their children?), let alone the Clark Gibsons, being left to themselves whilst their family go about their lawful occasions, seem negligible.\n\nI'm thinking of writing to \"The Times\" about it, or even asking The Croydon Corporation to think again about the J.P.s they put in office. It's another sign of the now generally admitted decadence of the country.\n\nLove to you all, Jack\n\nCirca 1958 CH GIBSON at Iona, Radcliffe Road, Croydon\n\n1958_Newspaper_Alderman_Retires.pdf\n\n[Probably The Croydon Times or Croydon Advertiser]\n\nAfter 37 years' service to the town as a councillor, alderman and, for one year, as Mayor, Ald.

Gibson was elected to the council in 1921 and he soon made his mark as a man who was prepared to fight for any cause on which he felt strongly.

Gibson led the successful campaign soon after the last war which led to the trustees of the Crystal Palace, of whom he was one, reinstating a sports centre onthe derelict grounds.\n\nHe founded, in 1913, the building firm of C.H.

Gibson to be Mayor\n\nLONG YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE\n\nProminent business man and Croydon Council member since 1921, Ald. Lieut.-Col Charles Henry Gibson of Radcliffe Road, East Croydon, is to be Croydon's next Mayor. He will take office in May. Tall and lean, crisply effective as a speaker untiring as a champion, Ald. Gibson will wera the mayoral robes with dignity and effect.\n\nEducated at Kingswood School, Bath, he was articled to a firm of contractors and then joined a small firm of builders in Croydon 40 years ago. He started C.H. Gibson Ltd, (Contractors), in 1913, moving to the present London Road premises in 1928, and now employing 350 men. He has been a director of Stewart Klitz and Co. for 25 years.\n\nWAR SERVICE\n\nHe served overseas in both wars and has over ten years' commissioned active service to his credit. He was in France in 1940, and scrambled back from St. Malo in June with the loss of four officers and 91 men of the original company. Soon after his election to the council he became known as the \"chief tram scrapper\" for his trenchant advocacy of that policy. The Council then controlled the local service. He has served on several important committees and is chairman of the Planning and development Committee. He has many public interests outside the council. He is a Whitgift governor and chairman of the Foundation Finance Committee, member of the South-West Regional Hospital Board, chairmanof the Finance Committee of the Croydon group of hospitals, and a member of the Crystal Palace Trustees, in which capacity he engineered the successful campaign to reopen the grounds to the public.\n\nHe is a member of several professional bodies, and has been a Rotarian since 1923. He belongs to the Croham Hurst Golf Club. He is married.\n\nAld. Gibson's election as Mayor will have the support of the council's Labour group. His name was put forward by a selection committee on which labour is represented. Croydon Rotarians at their luncheon on Tuesday, warmly congratulated their collegue on his selection.\n\n1949_Newspaper_Next_Mayor_of_Croydon.pdf\n\nNext Mayor of Croydon\n\nALD. COL. C. H. GIBSON\n\nA man who has distinguished himself as a soldier, a builder and a civic administrator has been chosen as next Mayor of Croydon. The Mayoral Selection Committee on Monday night unanimously recommended Croydon Town Council to elect Alderman Colonel Charles Herbert Gibson to succeed Councillor Ernest Turner next May.\n\nBy profession, Colonel Gibson is a master builder and he is the founder of the well-known firm of C.H. Gibson Ltd., Thorton Heath. When he was first elected in November 1921 he was one of the youngest members of Croydon Town Council. He represented the Central Ward and was appointed a member of the Croydon Finance Committee in 1925.\n\nWORLD TOUR\n\nIn January 1930 he retired from the Town Council to go on a tour round the world. On his return, he took an active interest in various organisations in the town and at the Municipal Elections of November 1932, he was returned to the Town Council, again as a representative for Central Ward.\n\nHe has served on most of the principal committees of the Town Council and recently has been prominent as representative for Croydon on the board of the Crystal Palace trustees. It is largely through his efforts that plans have been prepared for the reopening of the Palace grounds as a sports and recreation centre.\n\nCol. Gibson first came to Croydon in 1908 and from 1914 to 1918 he was the Commanding Officer of a company in the Royal Engineers. He was wounded and spent eleven months in hospital.\n\nSoon after the outbreak of World War II, he was given leave of absence by Croydon Town Council foir the duration of the war to enable him to rejoin the Forces. He took a commission in the Royal Engineers and went to France, where he was quickly promoted from the rank of captain to major. In 1941 he was promoted from Deputy Commander to Commander in the Royal Engineers with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.\n\nIN DUNKIRK RETREAT\n\nDuring the fateful German advance and the Dunkirk retreat in June 1940, Col. Gibson brought his unit back from Rheims after an exciting journey via St. Malo, with a loss of four officers and 91 men from the original company.\n\nBoth Col. Gibson and his wife were on active service in World War II. Mrs. Gibson, who was in the A.T.S., was on the staff of Lady Lawrence.\n\nColonel Gibson is one of the senior members of Croydon Rotary Club and he has always been promiment in the social life of the town.\n\nHe serves as a member of the south West Regional Hospital Board and the Croydon Group Hospital Committee . He is a Whitgift Governor and chairman of Croydon Council Planning and Development Committee.\n\nIn his spare time Col. Gibson is a keen golfer, and a member of Croham Hurst Golf Club.\n\nCOUNCIL TRIBUTE\n\nA tribute to the work of Col. Gibson was paid at Monday's meeting of Croydon Town Council by alderman L.A. Asaton, chairman of the Finance Committee, who said: \"I am sure we owe a debt of gratitude to Col. Gibson for his efforts in bringing into public use a substantial area of land at the Crystal Palace. I hope he will continue his efforts and see that ultimately a building is put on the site worthy of the town of Croydon and the surrounding district.\"\n\n1949 Iona\n\nIona had been built by Mr KENNARD who was run over and killed by a bus while posting a letter.

I had walked along to the 'Times' Office to see the coloured photographs of Charles and yourself displayed in the window. Behind me two girls were also looking and I heard one say - 'Doesn't she look young! You could take her for Princess Elizabeth couldn't you. But it's like her isn't it.' Who these people were I don't know, but I felt fully in agreement with their observations. Moreover, I had all day been connecting you in my mind with another royal personage - The Duchess of Kent. When I looked at you, that is who I felt strongly reminded of. And I thought that even the Duchess of Kent at her very best could not have looked smarter. I think you struck a most perfect note, and nothing nicer could have been turned-out by even the like of Norman Hartnell you looked perfectly and truly 'swell'.\n\nThere were two other women I also admired. One was Mrs Marshall - to whom I would apply the word 'chic'. The other, I don't know who it was, but she was shortish, a little elderly and she was dressed in a soft blue. It was not the clothes, but the very beautiful triple row of pearls she was wearing. They were lovely.\n\nAltogether Dorothy I thought it was a grand day and very enjoyable. A very tiring one for you both and I expect you were glad when you were quietly back at home. If there is ever any little thing I can do such as minding house or anything at all, please know that I should only be too glad to help, and never hesitate to let me know.\n\nGood luck, good health and a very happy year to you both. with love, Reg\n\n1949_Croydon_Advertiser_Ald_GIBSON_21_Jan.pdf\n\n1949_Letter_Audrey_NESBITT_to_Dorothy_GIBSON_19_Jan.pdf\n\n1949_Letter_Audrey_NESBITT_to_Dorothy_GIBSON_19_Jan_Typed_Out.pdf\n\nAug 1948 Bovey Tracey, Devon\n\nThey went in two cars, so CH could do some independent touring.

Most of his fellow officers and men were already on board and some 5,000 died.

Needham, wished Alderman and Mrs. Gibson health and happiness in their married life.\n\n\"Now,\" he added, \"perhaps he will let us know why he did it.\"\n\nReplying, Ald. Gibson expressed thanks for the good wishes and congratulations.\n\n\"I had been thinking about this step for some time,\" he said, \"and I can assure youy that it came as no surprise to me\". (Laughter.)\n\n\"Having made up my mind, I did the deed very quickly, and I did it without having anyone present anyone except those absolutely essential for the wedding. Even my closest friends knew nothing about it until twenty-four hours before.\"\n\n1938_Newspaper_Wedding_Surprise_GIBSON_RERKINS.pdf\n\nA Croydon Newspaper Approx 8th Aug 1938\n\nWEDDING SURPRISE\n\nALD. C.H. GIBSON MARRIED\n\nA romantic secret, well kept for nearly a week, is revealed in the news that Ald. C. H. GIBSON was married at Croydon Register Office on Wednesday of last week.\n\nMrs Gibson is an Addiscombe resident and was Miss Dorothy Perkins before her marriage. The couple are now on their honeymoon in the South of France.\n\nAld. Gibson, who lives in Wellesley-road, is head of the well known firn of building contractors that bears his name, and which has been responsible for some of the most important of recent buildings in the centre of Croydon. He joined the Council in 1921 and was elected to the aldermanic bench last year.

His early religious training had its issue in his definite surrender to Christ at the age of twenty. In 186I he was accepted as a Candidate and was immediately sent into a circuit.\n\nHis ministry everyWhere bore gracious fruit. He had great success as an evangelist, and in one circuit the membership was doubled during his term.\n\nEvery part of his work was marked by thoroughness and fidelity. His pulpit ministry showed that he had disciplined himself to studious habits. He was a strong and wise administrator, having a sound judgment of men and things. As a pastor he loved his people with an absorbing devotion, and his self-detachment and sensitive sympathy quickly won their hearts.\n\nIn all circuits he is chiefly remembered for his transparent and radiant goodness. The years of his retirement were spent at Ealing, where many saw in his refined character the beauty of holiness. He entered into rest on March 5, J924, in the eighty-sixth year of his age and the sixty fourth of his ministry\n\n1924_Death_Certificate_Henry_GIBSON.pdf\n\nRegistration District Brentford\n\nDeath in the Sub-district of Ealing in the County of Middlesex.\n\nNo 379 | When and where died, Fifth March 1924, 13 Drayton Green Road, Ealing, U.D.\n\nName, Henry GIBSON | Male | 85 yrs | Occupation, Weslyan Minister (Retired)\n\nCause of death, 1.

So being able to project his otherwise gentle voice, vowel sounds and all, was important to compete with the traffic round Marble Arch.\n\n1921 CH GIBSON elected as a Croydon Council member.\n\n1921_10_17_Roll_British_War_&_Victory Medals_TNA-WO329.pdf\n\nHis entry in the roll of the Silver War Badge (given to officers and men discharged on medical grounds), which gives the unique number of his badge and his home address of 124 George Street, Croydon\n\nCirca 1920 John Clark (Jack), CHarles Herbert, Frank Speeding\n\nElla Mabel, Eliza Jane and Henry GIBSON in the garden at 13, Drayton Green Road, Ealing, Middlesex\n\n1919_04_22_London_Gazette_CH_GIBSON_Relinquished_Commission.pdf\n\nThe undermentioned temp.

Henry GIBSON and his children seems correct. I do not know much more except what I heard from my father. For instance that Henry used to line up his children in the study armed with a tuning fork and get them to sing Do, Ray, Me etc. which when all were present, left two spare! He also used to do chemical experiments with them, conduct magic lantern shows with the light provided with gas, in a leathern bag on which my grandmother was required to sit in order to keep up the pressure. At one point the whole thing caught fire and Henry bore it down the aisle and out of the church without anyone being much injured.\n\nOne of my father's earliest memories was at the age of about four sitting under the kitchen table and being almost overcome with the family excitement when a new parcel of books was being unpacked. I think Henry read Darwin, even though he probably disagreed with some of it.\n\n1882_Order_of_Methodist_Services.pdf\n\n1881_Birth_Certificate_Charles_Herbert_GIBSON.pdf\n\nRegistration District Tiverton\n\nBirth in the Sub-district of Tiverton in the County of Devon\n\nNo. 20\n\nBorn, Twenty Second November 1881, Twyford Place, Tiverton U.S.D.\n\nName, Charles Herbert | Boy\n\nName of Father, Henry GIBSON\n\nName of Mother, Eliza Jane GIBSON formerly CLARK\n\nOccupation of Father, Wesleyan Minister\n\nInformant, Henry GIBSON, Father, Twyford Place, Tiverton.\n\nWhen registered, Twenty Seventh December 1881.\n\nRegistrar, Arthur Cruwys SHARLAND.\n\n1881 Census\n\nRG11 | Piece 0885 | Folio 74 | Page 20 |\n\n3 Medway Terrace, Rochester St Nicholas, Kent.\n\nHenry J.W.
