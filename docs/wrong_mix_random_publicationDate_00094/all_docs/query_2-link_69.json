        "text": "James (J.W.) Gibson, 77, of Denver, NC passed away on December 19, 2023. He was born on October 11, 1946 to the late Monroe and Martha Gibson in Mooresville, NC.\n\nJW worked as a well driller, concrete worker, and truck driver until his retirement where he went into his own lawn care service.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 57 years, Julia (Judy) Sigmon Gibson of Denver, son J. Warren Gibson (Leigh) of Denver. Grandsons Greylen Gibson (Kaitlyn) of Charlotte, Weston and Locklen Gibson of Denver and Justin Taylor (Rebekah) of Flat Rock.\n\nHe is preceded in in death by his parents Monroe and Martha Gibson, sister and brother-in-law Mary and Johnny Holleman, niece Lynn Guice and nephew Joey Herron.\n\nThe world has lost a good man and our family has lost it's own personal Santa. He was a loving husband, father and grandfather who valued his family above all treasures.\n\nHe was an uncomplicated man who enjoyed being outside, working with his hands and performing acts of service for anyone who would let him. He was the walking definition of a jack-of-all-trades having a surprising amount of knowledge about an unreasonable amount of topics, especially when it comes to what we would call the blue-collar disciplines. There was almost nothing he couldn't build, make or fix.\n\nHe was a jokester that always tried to make people laugh. He had a joke for every occasion, no matter how corny.\n\nHe loved children and would take any opportunity to hold a baby or to interact with toddlers.\n\nHe was an animal lover, both wild and domestic. He cherished our family dogs and was deeply affected when it was time let them go. He regularly rehabbed any wild animals that needed help, from squirrels to pigeons to blue jays to purple martins, if it needed help to survive, he would do all he could to make that happen. He loved his deer herd. He would go out to the woods every evening regardless of weather and feed them. They were comfortable enough to come up and almost eat out of his hand.\n\nHe loved anything that moved, especially trains and anything that flies. A perfect Sunday afternoon for him was taking my mom on a road trip out through the middle of nowhere just following old train tracks and hopefully catching a glimpse of a train.\n\nOur lives will be greatly affected by his passing but not nearly to the extent that they were enriched by his presence. To our family he will always be the man that could do anything.\n\nVisitation will be held from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm Saturday, December 23, 2023 at Salem United Methodist Church, Denver. Funeral services will follow at 3pm in the church sanctuary."
