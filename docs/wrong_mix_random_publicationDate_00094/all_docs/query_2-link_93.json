        "text": "“Burning Chrome,” is an odd collection. A mix of many different cyberpunk themes-in-waiting. The best way to lay these themes out, in context, is to find them come to life in the stories.\n\nConsider “Johnny Mnemonic,” a story where Johnny, a data-courier, carries precious, and often illegal, data in a chip in his head. In theory, the information is protected even from his own access. But he takes on a job that requires him to peer inside his own head to understand what he’s carrying, which upends his whole life.\n\n“We’re an information economy. They teach you that in school. What they don’t tell you is that it’s impossible to move, to live, to operate at any level without leaving traces, bits, seemingly meaningless fragments of personal information. Fragments that can be retrieved, amplified …” (Gibson, 1986, Burning Chrome)\n\nIn this story, the power of information becomes clear. Not supplanting the value of other things, but a new economic layer. It’s a little chilling that this was written about forty years ago, but it feels even more pertinent today. Especially as we wrestle with the loss of both identity and privacy in the new morass of information war. Much of which is centred on information generated by our own activities.\n\nConsider the “Gernsback Continuum,” a photographer begins to daydream a future America that never was. Massive chrome multi-engined airplanes, gleaming city spires and the like. Worse, it’s a reality that seems to be bleeding into his own.\n\n“Ever so gently, I went over the Edge— And looked up to see a twelve-engined thing like a bloated boomerang, all wing, thrumming its way east with an elephantine grace, so low that I could count the rivets in its dull silver skin, and hear – maybe – the echo of jazz.” (Gibson, 1986 Burning Chrome, p. 33)\n\nIn this story, past, present and imagined futures merge. It’s a deep evocation of cyberpunk settings, which don’t start from a blank slate, but layer on top of older stuff until a richly layered backdrop is implied for each story.\n\nIn “Fragments of a Hologram Rose,” a lonely ’Apparent Sensory Perception’ content-maker, who makes and edits dreams that feel real, thinks about his former girlfriend and how she left him.\n\n“Let yesterday arrange itself around you in flat schematic images. What you said – what she said – watching her pack – dialling the cab. However you shuffle them they form the same printed circuit, hieroglyphs converging on a central component; you, standing in the rain, screaming at the cabby. The rain was sour and acid, nearly the colour of piss. The cabby called you an asshole; you still had to pay twice the fare. She had three pieces of luggage. In his respirator and goggles, the man… looked like an ant. He pedalled away in the rain. She didn’t look back…” (Gibson, 1986, Burning Chrome, p. 42).\n\nHere, dystopian, ‘spoiled’ settings surround all the characters and the stories they unwind. The environment is usually the thing that is in some way degraded, but this may also extend to the social, cultural and economic worlds. Everything is tinged with decay and sadness. This dystopianess isn’t a perfect universal, but it’s common. I don’t think it’s even about relishing the degredation, for its own sake, but a worry that the best times are already past.\n\nIn “New Rose Hotel”, a nameless grifter and thief faces his end as he remembers Sandii, the lover who betrayed both him and his partner-in-crime, the shadow soldier Fox.\n\n“Sandii, you left me here. You left me all your things. This gun. Your makeup, all the shadows and blushes capped in plastic. Your Cray microcomputer, a gift from Fox, with a shopping list you entered. Sometimes I play that back, watching each item cross the little silver screen. A freezer. A fermenter. An incubator. An electrophoresis system with integrated agarose cell and transilluminator. A tissue embedder. A high-performance liquid chromatograph. A flow cytometer. A spectrophotometer. Four gross of borosilicate scintillation vials. A microcentrifuge. And one DNA synthesiser, with in-built computer. Plus software.” (Gibson, 1986, Burning Chrome, p. 113-114).\n\nHere is a key aspect of cyberpunk world-building: the word-salad lists of technology. A well-written technology audit creates a sensation of an abundance of things old and new. It’s a patina of authenticity. Notably, none of the words have to be exactly correct. In fact, it’s probably better if they don’t. But they have to sound right and feel plausible. That subtle ring in the ear that feels like a character is telling you things you just ought to know automatically. As if the pieces of technology are so common and so well understood they don’t need description.\n\nIt’s a trick often imitated with modern cyberpunk writing, to the point of painful cliche. The thing is, it isn’t always done well. Gibson’s technological lists feel viable, even if the technology isn’t perfectly accurate. Stripping back the language and focusing only the items shows why this is. Consider the technology list from “New Rose Hotel,” with a basic definition beside each:\n\n…freezer (for cooling things), fermenter (for warming things to increase a bacterial reaction), incubator (for keeping things warm), agrose (a component of the growth medium agar), electrophoresis (moving particles in suspension), transilluminator (projecting light through translucent sample), chromatograph (technique for seperating mixtures), cytometer (measurement of cells), spectrophotometer (measuring reflection or transmission properties of materials), borosilicate (type of glass) scintillation (materials that emit light) vials (tube), microcentrifuge (small spinning device to seperate samples), DNA synthesiser (analyses DNA) and computer with software…\n\nNotice the pattern? Everything is a real thing, technique, tool or item. It may not be the right thing for what is being implied and many words that don’t belong together might be run together for effect. But it all sounds right, feels right, to anyone with an ear for the real words and concepts of our everyday world. Even if these tools and techniques date, they’ll still sound effective, because they’re echoing things that once were. When put together into this word salad, as a description as a casual array of equipment left behind by a thief and trickster, it sounds, well, cyberpunk.\n\n“New Rose Hotel,” also offers a first look at one of the common antagonists of cyberpunk, the multinational corporation.\n\n“The zaibatsus, Fox said, the multinationals. The blood of a zaibatsu is information, not people. The structure is independent of the individual lives that comprise it. Corporation as life form. (Gibson, 1986, Burning Chrome, p. 116).\n\nIn this case, the ‘zaibatsu,’ (財閥) from the Japanese word for ‘large financial group’, ‘money clique’ or ‘money club’. Today, we’d probably go with the term vertically integrated multinational or conglomerate. They were apparently common in Japan before World War II and controlled vast layers of Japanese society, marshelling extensive resources in multiple domains.\n\nAll of these stories offer fragments of the cyberpunk-to-be, but it’s in the title story, “Burning Chrome”, that all the pieces fall in place. The protagonist, Automatic Jack, describes his friend and fellow hacker and in doing so, paints the picture of the cyberpunk anti-hero.\n\n“Bobby was a cowboy, and ice was the nature of his game, ice from ICE, Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics. The matrix is an abstract representation of the relationships between data systems. Legitimate programmers jack into their employers’ sector of the matrix and find themselves surrounded by bright geometries representing the corporate data…Bobby was a cowboy. Bobby was a cracksman, a burglar, casing mankind’s extended electronic nervous system, rustling data and credit in the crowded matrix, monochrome nonspace where the only stars are dense concentrations of information, and high above it all burn corporate galaxies and the cold spiral arms of military systems.” (Gibson, 1986, Burning Chrome, p. 181).\n\nAutomatic Jack, with his cybernetic arm and Bobby, a pair of data-junkies, work to take down a local crime lord. Not with their fists or physical weapons, but a purloined computer virus.\n\n“Bodiless, we swerve into Chrome’s castle of ice. And we’re fast, fast. It feels like we’re surfing the crest of the invading program, hanging ten above the seething glitch systems as they mutate. We’re sentient patches of oil swept along down corridors of shadow…Chrome’s castle is dissolving, sheets of ice shadow flickering and fading, eaten by the glitch systems that spin out from the Russian program, tumbling away from our central logic thrust and infecting the fabric of the ice itself. The glitch systems are cybernetic virus analogs, self-replicating and voracious. They mutate constantly, in unison, subverting and absorbing Chrome’s defences. Have we already paralysed her, or is a bell ringing somewhere, a red light blinking? Does she know?” (Gibson, Burning Chrome, p. 184 - 186)\n\nBobby and Automatic Jack succeed in their destruction of Chrome’s enterprise. But, this is a cyberpunk story, which means their success is bittersweet. Hidden under the word salad of technology, the dystopian settings, the mistrust of authority, the anti-hero and other halmarks of cyberpunk is one of the lesser noticed themes of Gibson’s writing, the failed relationships.\n\nThe relationships under the punk\n\nIt might seem an odd contradiction. To have relationships at the core of stories that seem only about geeking out over technology. But cyberpunk isn’t that simple. I’d argue that cyberpunk is as much about relationships as any genre, perhaps even more. Granted, the relationships may be a character’s relationships with themselves, or a version of themselves, with a sentient piece of technology, with cyberspace itself, or something stranger.\n\nIn the case of the title story of Gibson’s collection, “Burning Chrome,” the relationship is between Bobby, Automatic Jack and Rikki, the woman situated between them. Ostensibly Rikki, is Bobby’s girlfriend. However, she is another in a long line of woman that Bobby courts, has intense relationships with and then abandons in his quest to prove something to himself.\n\nOver the course of the short story, it’s implied she cheats on Bobby, with Automatic Jack. Though, even as she does so, it comes out she’s playing her own game. Rikki is desperate to start working up the ‘upgrade ladder,’ to help her progress in the film and entertainment industry. Starting with new eyes and who knows what from there.\n\nShe is so intent on this goal, she works for periods of time in one of Chrome’s less savoury establishments, jacked in to Chrome’s systems and renting her body by the hour, while unconscious to whatever happens to her. It’s a terrible and manipulative idea, evoking the desperation of characters living in the margins. Everyone is using and being used.\n\n“Burning Chrome” is a melancholy story, with a downbeat ending. Neither Bobby nor Automatic Jack end up with Rikki, who may, or may not have reached the glittering heights of success that she aspires. At the end, Automatic Jack notes,\n\n“…and sometimes late at night I’ll pass a window with posters of simstim stars, all those beautiful, identical eyes staring back at me out of faces that are nearly as identical, and sometimes the eyes are hers [Rikki’s], but none of the faces are, none of them ever are, and I see her far out on the edge of all this sprawl of night and cities, and then she waves goodbye.” (Gibson, Burning Chrome, p. 203 - 204)\n\nCyberpunk never promises to uplift, but to expand thinking. If there is any relenting in the dystopian tone, it’s when a story focuses on the odd resiliancy of human spirit, that pushes through challenges, both internal and external to reach some form of acceptance, if not peace.\n\nThe situated impact of Burning Chrome\n\nTore Rye Andersen in a 2019 article for “Journal of American Culture,” has a really intersting take on the seeming originalness of the cyberspace brought to life in Gibson’s ”Burning Chrome.” In Andersen’s article, entitled, “Cyberspace Revisited: A Radial Reading of William Gibson’s “Burning Chrome” he notes:\n\n“[Gibson’s] conception of cyberspace was unusually innovative, and as a result of the strength of his vision the word has since become an integral part of our common vocabulary…But even acknowledging Gibson’s contribution to our culture and its understanding of itself, it is possible to be more precise… [and]…challenge the prevalent notion of Gibson as a prophet who out of the blue conjures something as unheard of and as unprecedented as cyberspace…“Burning Chrome” was rather published in a certain context in which Gibson’s core ideas already circulated, and that he condensed these ideas rather than creating them from scratch.…The future is densely represented in “Burning Chrome,” but it is also massively present in the advertisements, articles and visual elements of Omni, and a radial reading can reveal the remarkable parallels between Gibson’s story and its publication context and shed new light on the far from immaculate conception of cyberspace.” (Andersen, 2019)\n\nI’d agree with this reminder that Gibson was drawing from the materials of his time and that his ideas of cyberspace and cyberpunk are not some sort of prophetic immaculate artistic conception. Andersen notes that the Omni magazine was full of articles and advertisments about new movements in mobile or satellite communications, globalised data, cordless phones, printers. Obviously, Gibson wasn’t writing in a vaccum of technology. Trends were beggining to take shape.\n\nAndersen also makes significant links between Gibson’s conception of cyberspace and TRON, also mentioned in the Omni magazine the same issue that the story “Burning Chrome” was published. The thing is, TRON, that wonderful late 1980s film conception of glowing cyberspace / hyperspace seems a sterile and clean emptiness compared to the seething, heaving and busy offline and online worlds of Gibson’s cyberpunk.\n\nCyberpunk is gritty, invovled and populated and both thematic settings share an abundance of neon, but that’s about it for me. Granted, my view could be built around the film thematics TORN, the first formed when there wasn’t enough graphics technology to create a busy virtual world and the second following the aesthetics of the first.\n\nIn sum, Gibson, the antique-picker, assembled a fabric of everyday things, to elegantly paint a picture of an alternate history that feels like the future, but probably won’t be. Not exactly. Rather, it’s a hyper-condensation of a thousand ideas from the past and present, unified in such a way they create an overall of vision of cyberpunk where the sum is far greater than the parts and that was the founding synthesis that cyberpunk was built on.\n\nEdited 19 January 2023 - Light edits to shorten a few of the quotes, fix a few typos and upate the references to the correct format.\n\nEdited 14 February 2023 - Added a few extra lines about the Beats Generation and updated more references.\n\nReferences\n\nAndersen, T.
