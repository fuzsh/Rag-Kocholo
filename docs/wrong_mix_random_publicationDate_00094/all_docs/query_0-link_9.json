She passed away in 1965.\n\n\"In 1837 William Gibson with his wife, Sarah Yeoman, and two sons — Yeoman, aged nine years, and Judson, aged five — came from Yorkshire to Canada. They contracted small-pox on the vessel, but recovered and made their way to Toronto, where they remained about a year, Mr. Gibson engaging in the butchering business. On April 30th, 1838, he bought the farm of 75 acres, being parts of Lots 7 and 8, Con. 6, from Mr. James Munger. Another son and daughter were born to them on the farm, the former of whom died in infancy, and the latter was afterwards Mrs. B. Weatherill. In 1847, Mr. Gibson died suddenly from apoplexy. His widow survived him forty years. His eldest son, Yeoman, married Miss Belinda Hyfield and spent his life in Whitby. Judson married Miss Carrie E. Graham and lived on the farm till his death in 1910. The farm is still occupied by his son. Two daughters, Lena and Gertie, are now respectively Mrs. F. M. Chapman of Toronto and Mrs. F. W. Disney of Oshawa.\" [1]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Past Years in Pickering: Sketches of the History of the Community, William R. Wood, 1911\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/132432086"
