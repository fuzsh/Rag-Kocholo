        "text": "FAMILY OF ALEXANDER GIBSON, LABOURER, OF KIRCUBBIN:\n\nThe records suggest that there were two Alexander Gibsons living in Kircubbin and having children at the same time. As well as our ancestor, Alexander Gibson (1801-1848), who is usually referred to as a farmer, there was an Alexander Gibson who can only be distinguished by the imprecise criterion that he is referred to as a labourer. The family of this second Alexander Gibson:\n\nAlexander Gibson and Sarah McFerron (also remembered as McFarlane), both of Kircubbin, were married in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church on Feb.27, 1822 (Robert Finlay and Charles Carr were witnesses). Children of this other Alexander Gibson may be:\n\nMargaret Gibson was baptized in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church on Jan.19, 1823.\n\nAgnes Gibson was christened on Oct. 31, 1825, in the Kircubbin Church; her father was recorded as Alexander Gibson of Inishargy. On June 8, 1847, an Agness Gibson, aged 21 and a spinster of Inishargy whose father was Alexander Gibson, a labourer, married William Moreland, aged 21, a bachelor, of Fishquarter, Inishargy whose father was William Moreland, a soldier, in the Kircubbin Presbyterian Meetinghouse. William and Agnes moved to the Edinburgh area of Scotland about 1870. Agnes died in 1890 in Partick, Lanarkshire. We know of the following children of William and Agnes Moreland:\n\nIsaac John Moreland was born in 1850 in Ireland. He married Mary Brydie Drummond on Nov.10, 1876, in North Leith, Scotland. On Jan.10, 1882, at Grindley's Stables, 1869 Govan Road, Lanark, Scotland, where he was working as a funeral director's coachman, he died from a ruptured liver, the result of an accident. The death was registered by his father William Moreland. Isacc and Mary had the following children:\n\nMary Moreland was born about 1876 in Leith.\n\nAgnes Moreland was born about 1878 in Leith.\n\nJohn Moreland was born about 1880 in Leith.\n\nWilliam Alexander Moreland was born in 1853 in County Down. On Feb.28, 1888, in St.Mary's Church, Partick, Lanark, Scotland, he was married to Annie Paterson Anderson, born Jul.5, 1863, in Kilmarnock. William died on Nov.30, 1895, in Charters Towers, Queensland, and Annie on Jun.10, 1945, in Toronto, Canada. William and Annie had the following children:\n\nWilliam Alexander Moreland was born on Aug.6, 1888, in Charter Towers, Queensland, Australia. On Mar.10, 1911, in Greenock, Scotland, he was married to Sarah Logan. William died in Greenock in Sep. 1961.\n\nAgnes Moreland was born on Apr.21, 1890, in Charter Towers, Queensland, Australia.\n\nRobert John (Isaac) Moreland was born on Apr.17, 1892, in Charter Towers, Queensland, Australia. He married Elizabeth Florence Hinves. Isaac died on Jan.12, 1973, in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada. Isaac and Elizabeth had five children:\n\nFrederick Alexander Hinves Moreland. He is the father of Wendy Moreland, born about 1952, in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada. Wendy married and was divorced from a man named Prenty and had three children listed below. Wendy (ice_nana@hotmail.com) lives in Barrie, Ontario, and provided much of the information on this Moreland family.\n\nJames Derek Prenty was born on May 29, 1970, in St.Catherines, Ontario, Canada.\n\nChristopher Robert Prenty was born on Feb.17, 1973, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.\n\nLisa Michelle Prenty was born on Oct.29, 1976, in Windsor, Ontario, Canada.\n\nAnnie Moreland was born on Nov.12, 1895, in Charter Towers, Queensland, Australia. She married Alan Tyner. Alan died in 1895 just after his daughter Annie was born. Annie then went back to Scotland and, according to the 1901 Census, was living as the ``wife'' of John Campbell with whom she had two children, Hugh and James Campbell. Later Annie emigrates to Canada where the boys, Hugh and James, are now listed with the last name Moreland. Annie died on Aug.30, 1948, in Toronto, Canada. Her children:\n\nAnnie Moreland\n\nHugh Moreland\n\nJames Moreland\n\nEllen Jane Moreland was born in 1859 in County Down.\n\nRobert E. Moreland was born in 1861 in County Down. On Jul.4, 1891, in Belfast, he married Mary McCartney.\n\nMary Jane Moreland was born in 1863 in County Down and married James Graham in Scotland.

On Jan.10, 1896, in Partick, Lanark, he married Isabella Harland and they had five children.\n\nFAMILY OF JAMES GIBSON OF BALLYGARVIN:\n\nJames Gibson is mostly known to us from the baptismal records of Kircubbin Presbyterian Church. We list below the group of baptisms which may all be the children of a single James Gibson of Kircubbin:\n\nMargaret Gibson was baptized in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church on May 28, 1791, the daughter of James Gibson of Kircubbin.\n\nMary Gibson was baptized in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church on Jul.8, 1792, the daughter of James Gibson of Kircubbin.\n\nRobert Gibson was baptized in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church on Jul.15, 1794, the son of James Gibson of Kircubbin.\n\nMargaret Gibson was baptized in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church on Sep.4, 1796, the daughter of James Gibson of Kircubbin.\n\nJames Gibson was baptized in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church on Nov.23, 1798, and became a farmer in Ballygarvin. He married a woman named Jane. The James Gibson listed in the 1834 tithe applotment records as holding land in Ballygarvin is either James or his father. In the Griffith Valuation of about 1860, James Gibson is listed as holding a farm in Ballygarvin of about 30 acres with a house worth three pounds; it is rented from Hugh Montgomery. James and his wife Jane (1807-1879) are remembered on a gravestone in Kircubbin Presbyterian Graveyard which reads:\n\n``Erected by James Gibson, Ballygarvin, in memory of his beloved wife Jane Gibson who died 26th February 1879 aged 72 years. Also his grandson James McKee who died 14th July 1887(1857?) aged 1 year and 11 months. Also the above named James Gibson who departed this life 28th June 1895 aged 96 years. Also his son William Gibson who died 23rd August 1852 aged 17 years. Also his daughter Margaret A. Gibson who died 6th May 1852 aged 8 years. Also his son Andrew M. Gibson who died 23rd Novr. 1852 aged 2 years. Also his son Alexander Gibson who died 7th November 1931 aged 89 years.''\n\nThis stands with a modern McKee stone in a low-railed enclosure. It follows from this and another McKee gravestone that the children of James and Jane Gibson were:\n\nMary Ann Gibson was born about 1830. On Oct.9, 1852, in the Kircubbin Meetinghouse she was married to William McKee, a 21-year-old labourer from Ballyhemlin whose father was also a labourer called William McKee. A William McKee is listed as holding land in Ballygarvin in the 1834 tithe applotment records. Mary Ann died in 1859. Their children:\n\nSamuel McKee whose gravestone in the Kircubbin Presbyterian graveyard is next to the above gravestone of James Gibson of Ballygarvin was probably a son of William and Mary Ann McKee. The gravestone reads:\n\n``Erected by Samuel McKee of Belfast in loving memory of his children. James who died Jul.14, 1887, aged 2. Sarah Robina who died Apr.5, 1900, aged 11. Also his daughter Mary Jane who died Jun.10, 1924, aged 43. Also the above Samuel McKee died Dec.29, 1928, aged 77. Also his wife Mary Ann McKee who died Jun.16, 1944, aged 91. Also his daughter Martha who died Nov.10, 1947, aged 65.

On Feb.21, 1868, in the First Presbyterian Church, Ballywalter, he was married to Margaret Kerr whose father Charles Kerr was a farmer in Ballygarvin. Alexander Gibson and Eliza Anne Kerr witnessed the marriage. John and Margaret had at least two children listed below. In the 1901 Census John (aged 62) and Margaret (aged 63) are listed as living in Ballygarvin with their 24-year-old son John, a 70-year-old visitor Mary Kerr (a farmeress) and a 61-year-old boarder, William McQuoid(?), a pensioner from the Royal Irish Constabulary. A gravestone at Kircubbin Presbyterian Church commemorates John and Margaret and reads as follows:\n\n``Erected by John Gibson of Ballygarvin in loving memory of his wife Margaret who died Jul.17, 1915, aged 78. Also the above John Gibson who died Oct.11, 1925, aged 85. Their daughter-in-law Elizabeth loved wife of John Gibson who died Sep.11, 1960.

Clearly he was born before his parents marriage. He also probably died young.\n\nJohn Gibson was born in Ballygarvin on May 14, 1876, and is listed as an unmarried farmer living with his parents in Ballygarvin in the 1901 Census. John married a woman named Elizabeth as the above gravestone inscription attests. They may have been the parents of Nora Gibson, born about 1910. Cecil Brennen remembers that Nora Gibson married John Mateer of Bayview. Nora's daughter Muriel Mateer married a boatbuilder. Nora's granddaughter is said to have compiled a Gibson geneology.\n\nAlexander Gibson was born about 1841 and died on Nov.7, 1931 aged 89.\n\nMargaret A.Gibson was born about 1843 and died on May 6, 1852, aged 8.\n\nAndrew Gibson was born about 1849 and died on Nov.23, 1852, aged 2.\n\nSamuel Gibson was baptized in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church on Jun.14, 1801, the son of James Gibson of Kircubbin.\n\nJane Bailie Gibson was baptized in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church on Apr.19, 1804, the daughter of James Gibson of Kircubbin.\n\nWilliam Gibson was baptized in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church on Oct.23, 1805, the son of James Gibson of Kircubbin.\n\nJane Gibson was baptized in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church on May 9, 1809, the daughter of James Gibson of Ballygarvin.\n\nFAMILY OF ANDREW GIBSON OF INNISHARGY:\n\nAndrew Gibson was baptized in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church on Jul.19, 1795, the son of Alexander Gibson of Nunsquarter, Kircubbin. Andrew married Eliza Harrison, born about 1797, and they had several children listed below. At Kircubbin Presbyterian Church there is a gravestone which commemorates Eliza who died on May 30, 1839, at the age of 41:\n\n``Erected by Andrew Gibson of Inneshargie in memory of his wife Elizabeth alias Harrison who departed this life 30th May 1839 aged 41 years. Also his daughter who died young.''\n\nThe children of Andrew and Eliza Gibson:\n\nAlexander Gibson was baptized in Ballywalter on Oct.26, 1823. On Dec.22, 1849, a Alexander Gibson, an unmarried labourer from Ballyhemlin and the son of Andrew Gibson, a labourer, was married in the Ballyhemlin Meetinghouse to Letitia Beggs from Ballyhalbert, the daughter of labourer Robert Beggs.\n\nA daughter who died young.\n\nFAMILY OF HUGH GIBSON OF GREYABBEY:\n\nHugh Gibson was a shoemaker in Greyabbey.

His first wife Susanna Gilmore, born about 1810, died on Oct.24, 1845, at the young age of 35 as the inscription below attests. The second time, James (of Inishargy) married Margaret Bailie of Ballygarvin on Oct.29, 1836, in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church. James Gibson and Joseph Baillie were witnesses. The following gravestone inscription can be found in the Greyabbey graveyard:\n\n``Here lieth the remains of Susanna Gibson alias Gilmore, wife to James Gibson of Greyabbey, who departed this life the 24th October 1845 aged 35 years.
