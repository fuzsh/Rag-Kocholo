Nope, for the first time in 26 years, I'm going to smile today. Smile because you lived and now you are enjoying your new home up there in paradise. I’ve had a ton of counseling this past year and they have helped me find some peace with your death. Some. Will I ever be the same? Absolutely not. But I am learning to let go of some of my anger and pain. Some. And maybe even learn to forgive those who destroyed my life all those years ago. maybe. It’s a process and I’m trying. God how I’m trying. Anyway enjoy Heaven today and I will try to make you proud. Love you 404\n\nLaura Gibson, Surviving Spouse\n\nof Ofc. Allen W. Gibson, Jr. EOW: 04/25/98\n\nHappy birthday, Babe. I hope Heaven is treating you well because I’m missing you like crazy. I took the day off work and I’m gonna celebrate you on your special day AND Star Wars Day! I wish I could go back in time to that last birthday again. We went to our favorite Mexican restaurant because you said it would double as a Cinco De Mayo celebration since that’s tomorrow. I even remember what you ordered and that big smile on your face. You will forever be 25 even tho I have continued to get older and older. I can’t wait to throw these arms around your neck one day when I get to come see you. I love you as much today as I ever have. Time changes nothing but makes me miss you more and more. I’m so in love with you, my brown-eyed boy. Happy birthday. I hope you’re proud of me and how I choose to celebrate your day. No I won’t be watching Star Wars or even Full Metal Jacket movie.

I HONOR YOU DEAR FRIEND\n\nYou will always be remembered and adored\n\nMargie Salas RN, AKA by you as Feliciano\n\nToday is April 25 2022. A lot of time has passed and things have changed but one thing that has stayed the same is the hurt in my heart. Losing you has broke our family and I can't fix that. I love you and miss you. God bless me with the best brother.You are the definition of a true hero.\n\nDouglas Gibson\n\nBrother\n\nYou are not Forgotten My Friend !\n\nCaptain Dave Shidell\n\nEmporia Police Department.

You were such an amazing daddy and I know if you were here you would be an amazing papaw to your 3 amazing grandchildren. They are growing up so fast! Isabella is 12, Emmalyn is 9, and Camden is 4 ( your name is carried on as his middle name). They all know who you are and love you dearly. You are forever our HERO! I love you daddy and I will 10-25 you again!\n\nCrissana Gibson\n\nDaughter\n\nOfcr. Gibson,\n\nI read sadly today of your struggle to do right for your community and your untimely loss to your family and Blue Family. I too lost two good friends in the line of duty many years ago. I think of and miss them everyday. That is how I know YOU are not forgotten, Sir. So unfortunate your tour was so short. Mine has been long and heavy with the loss of friends and fellow LEO's over the years. While local justice seemed to not have been done in your case it SEEMS the Federal system did the proper thing. I pray they are still right there and will be until they DIE. They should have to look at your official portrait on the walls of their cells everyday.\n\nGod Bless you Sir.\n\nRest well, we have the watch for now, and we will all be reunited when we follow you to Glory.\n\nDpty.Shrff.

Gray,\n\nLouisiana State Police, EOW: May 29, 1995\n\nFor some time I have been wanting to reconnect with you but life happened and before you know it time escapes. I never doubted you would be of service to others, to me you will always be the strong, flawless, kind, compassionate and loving super human I remember. I must be dreaming, has my search for you really lead me to this page? I can't imagine a world your no longer a part of. I will say a special prayer for your entire family especially for your daughter Crissana. I will hold with adoration the pics of your beautiful contagious smile and crazy antics and think fondly of the time in Parris Island S.C. 1994; You were always in sight despite the filled fields of camouflage. Your tenacity, intense take charge zest for life attitude will forever be engraved in my heart. We never said goodbye dear friend and never will. I was blessed to have met you.\n\nYour unforgettable I will remember you always\n\nMargie Salas RN, AKA Feliciano\n\nMargie Salas, RN\n\nLong lost Friend and Travel RN from New York/California\n\nRest in peace sir. Your sacrifice will never be forgotten... And to your wife Laura. You will forevermore be in my thoughts and prayers. Reading your writings is by far one of the hardest, and sweetest things I've ever come across. I'm so sorry for your Loss and continued heartache. Your husbands bravery and the loss will be in my thoughts for the rest of my law enforcement career. God bless you and your family\n\nOfficer Recruit David Muncy\n\nHopewell Police Department\n\nHappy anniversary, my love.

I dreamed about you last night. Like so many other dreams, it leaves me so sad and missing you. I dreamed I found out you were still alive and just in the hospital. I rushed to you. You were smiling. I told you I was taking you home now. I was so glad you were alive. Omg it’s so crazy to miss someone this much after all these years. I love u so much. Keep sending me dreams and signs. I’m watching for them. xoxoxo\n\nLaura Gibson\n\nWife\n\nRest in peace Patrolman Gibson.\n\nRabbi Lewis S. Davis\n\nHappy birthday! I hope you are celebrating in Heaven today.

Watch over us from above. xoxo\n\nLaura\n\nWife\n\nHappy anniversary. It would have been our 22 :’(\n\nxoxoxo\n\nLaura\n\nWife\n\nYesterday was hard. I can honestly say that even after 20 years the pain is still right there. Until we meet again, I will keep you alive in my heart.\n\nLaura\n\nWife\n\n\"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\"\n\nMatthew 5:9\n\nMarshal Chris Di Gerolamo\n\nFederal Air Marshal Service\n\nSome days if feels like an eternity...some days like it was yesterday. I'm in a much better place now than I was almost twenty years ago, there's no doubt about that. And although I don't go around grieving all the time, the grief is still there...and always will be. And although some wouldn't understand this, I am glad it's there. I never want to forget. I may never be \"normal\", but this is my \"normal\". It is who I am and that is okay. -xoxo\n\nI read this online and loved it so much. This “old guy” gets it. He really, really gets it. He puts into words what I have tried my whole life to. God bless this man and his words of wisdom. Here’s what he wrote about grief:\n\n“Alright, here goes. I’m old. What that means is that I’ve survived (so far) and a lot of people I’ve known and loved did not. I’ve lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can’t imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here’s my two cents.\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don’t want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don’t want it to ‘not matter.’ I don’t want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it.\n\nScars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can’t see.\n\nAs for grief, you’ll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you’re drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it’s some physical thing. Maybe it’s a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it’s a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don’t even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you’ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out.\n\nBut in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what’s going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything…and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\nSomewhere down the line, and it’s different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O’Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you’ll come out.\n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don’t really want them to. But you learn that you’ll survive them. And other waves will come. And you’ll survive them too. If you’re lucky, you’ll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.”\n\nLaura\n\nWife\n\nWant even more control of your Reflection?
