        "text": "Of course, adapting such a densely layered, intricately structured novel—with its large cast of characters spanning multiple timelines—to television was always going to be a challenge. \"There was never going to be a straight adaptation of the book. I don't think that can work,\" said Natali. \"But I think [Jonathan, Lisa, and Scott] understood the essence of the book and what makes it great.\"\n\n\"What Gibson does that is almost unique, is create a simultaneously alien world completely populated, fully detailed, but fully plausible and humane so you don't get lost in the ideas,\" said Nolan. \"The ideas are all there, but you have these very human characters at the center of them.\" He describes The Peripheral as \"Gibson's most relatable and grounded novel,\" especially Flynne's near-future rural America. \"It's a rural America I think a lot of us recognize, that's being left behind both technologically and culturally and finds itself at a bit of a crossroads,\" he said. \"Flynne's character is emblematic of that. She's smart, driven, ambitious, and she's in a place where she can't really do much with that other than play the boring bits of video games for wealthy people who live somewhere else. That doesn't feel five minutes in the future, that feels 30 seconds in the future.\"\n\nNolan was particularly confident in Smith's ability to bring the characters to life. \"Within this larger superstructure of a Gibsonian universe, having someone whose eye was relentlessly focused on the human aspect of the story felt like a very good plan,\" he said. \"One of the key beautiful aspects of The Peripheral is that it features a character in Flynne who doesn't know the world she's about to go into either and takes you by the hand and walks you as the audience into it, which is a time-tested way to tell a story.\"\n\nThe team made a conscious effort to break from the usual dystopian cyberpunk tropes that Neuromancer and (in film) Blade Runner helped make a mainstay of science fiction when designing their futuristic London. \"We were hell-bent on not imitating that, breaking that template,\" said Natali. \"What made this an intensely visually exciting and fresh take on what the future might be is the way that Gibson defined the future as something that is subtractive rather than something that is additive. These words are very layered and textured, yet they feel like they are a pastiche of what is both from the past and from the distant future.\"\n\nThus, Flynne's Southern rural United States in 2032 feels like our present or even our past, except for the small components of technology peppered throughout signaling that this is actually our near future—a jerry-rigged old Roomba, for example, or Flynn's nifty wristwatch phone, not to mention all the VR paraphernalia. The producers designed their 22nd century to serve as the antithesis of Flynne's world. \"It's kind of a re-creation of the Belle Epoque, highly cultured, very European,\" said Natali. \"Yet it also is this pastiche of very advanced future technology and a cultural obsession of what has come before.\" Rather than trying to rebuild London, they took parts of the existing city away and added \"little buttons\" of hyper-advanced technology.\n\n\"I think Gibson is perhaps the most talented futurist that we have, so you tend to sing in key with that where you can,\" said Nolan. \"One of the things that people so often get wrong about futurism is that they imagine everything's going to be different. The most pedestrian and banal items and objects that we interact with daily tend to persist, like street lamps and park benches.\" Nolan suggested that if someone from 30 or 40 years ago was suddenly plopped down into New York City in 2022, they might wonder why everyone was walking around staring at small handheld screens, but the streets would otherwise seem quite familiar.\n\nThat's what informed the team's approach to designing the future of The Peripheral. They focused first on those pedestrian aspects and then made small, subtle visual changes. \"You work on the filigree,\" said Nolan. \"But then—and this is what Gibson does so well—you take those small changes and you ripple them through culture, through the fabric of human society.\""
