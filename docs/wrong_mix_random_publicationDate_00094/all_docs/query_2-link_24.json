        "text": "In a time where national conversation has centered around removing monuments, one Greenville group is calling for a statue honoring the late Dr. William Frank Gibson, a local dentist and pioneer for civil rights.\n\nThe W.F. Gibson Sr. Foundation is raising funds to erect a bronze statue of Gibson, who was remembered Saturday as a selfless and fearless public servant who worked tirelessly to advance the causes of people of color both in the Upstate and abroad.\n\nSharon Bryant, chairperson for the W.F. Gibson Sr. Foundation, said a statue for Gibson is \"long overdue\" and efforts to raise the estimated $75,000 to $100,000 needed to build the statue have been in the works for sometime.\n\nThe group is looking at a number of locations across the city including John Wesley United Methodist Church where Gibson attended, and along Main Street.\n\nGibson served as president of the Greenville Branch of the NAACP for 18 years, and was elected chairman of the national board in 1985. He passed away in 2002 at the age of 69. Gibson’s wife, Lottie Gibson, served on city council for 25 years before her passing earlier this year.\n\n“When you mention national civil rights leaders, you have to mention Dr. Gibson just like you mention the other native son, Jesse Jackson,” said former NAACP board member and longtime friend of Gibson, Lenny Springs. “As we see Confederate flags being torn down, it’s time to rise up, build a Dr. Gibson statue. It’s time for Greenville to do the right thing. It’s time for Greenville to honor, celebrate his legacy and celebrate his native son.”\n\nBut Gibson’s NAACP legacy isn’t without criticism.His tenure as chairman ended in 1995, the year he was accused of contributing to the group's $3-million-plus deficit by abusing his expense account.\n\nStill, he was well known in many circles for his efforts to advance equal pay, economic empowerment and to integrate public facilities, including Cleveland Park, where over two dozen people packed a shelter to celebrate his legacy Saturday.\n\nThose in attendance Saturday included state senator, Karl B. Allen, who spoke of Gibson’s generosity, providing free care to children as a dentist and aiding many with employment opportunities.\n\nHe was awarded the Order of the Palmetto in 1998, the highest honor given to a citizen in the state.\n\nGibson, a native of Darlington, earned a doctor of dental science from Meharry Medical College in Nashville. He became a dentist, and after interning at Harlem Hospital in New York, returned to Greenville in 1959.\n\nAllen said the monument is necessary not because of the statue \"but we the story the live on, the story to be known.\"\n\nChecks can be made payable to the W.F. Gibson Sr. Foundation at 119 Marlboro Drive, Greenville, S.C."
