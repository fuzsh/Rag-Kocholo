        "text": "In the last post I wrote about the family of Richard Eykin Windle, a London surgeon and apothecary at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, who acted as executor of the will of my 5 x great grandmother Elizabeth Holdsworth née Gibson in 1809. I reported my discovery that his brother, oil and colour merchant John Hattam Windle, might have been a business partner of William Parker, who married Elizabeth’s daughter Sarah six years earlier.\n\nOne of the reasons for my interest in the Windles is that the reference to Richard in Elizabeth Holdsworth’s will is not the first record of that family’s connection with my ancestors. Twenty years earlier, in 1789, Elizabeth’s unmarried sister Sarah Gibson nominated ‘Thomas Windle Junior Esquire of Mile End in the parish of Stepney’ as co-executor of her own will, together with her brother Bowes John Gibson.\n\nWho was Thomas Windle, and what was his relationship, if any, to Richard Eykin Windle? I’m fairly sure that Thomas Windle senior, the father of the man named in Sarah Gibson’s will, was the person of that name who was buried at St Matthew’s church, Bethnal Green on 23rd April 1793. He would still have been alive when Sarah Gibson made her will four years earlier, thus making it important to describe his son as Thomas Windle Junior. Thomas Windle Senior had actually made his own will some years earlier, in 1784. From that document we learn that by then he was a widower: he asks to be buried ‘in a strong oak coffin filled up with sawdust as my wife was that my corpse may be directly laid over hers’. Rather confusingly, and perhaps as the result of an error, Thomas leaves property to ‘my son William Windle’ and in the same sentence appoints ‘my said son Thomas Windle’ as his sole executor. He signs his will ‘Thomas Windle Sen.’ and it was proved by ‘Thomas Windle Esquire the son of the deceased’.\n\nThere are various land tax records from the 1780s for properties in Bethnal Green belonging to Thomas Windle – presumably ‘Senior’, since all of the records for his son Thomas Windle Junior place him in Mile End Old Town. For example, in 1793, Thomas Windle Esquire of Mile End can be found in a list of subscribing members of the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. In 1797, his name was proposed, for the King’s approval, as one of the deputy lieutenants of the Tower Hamlets militia, and by 1818 he had been appointed to that position, as well as being a magistrate. There are countless land tax records for Thomas Windle Esquire of Mile End or Stepney, from the 1790s through to about 1825. He also seems to have owned property elsewhere in London, including two houses in Rosemary Lane, Whitechapel. In 1807, Thomas Windle both occupied and owned properties on Mile End Road South. This means he was a near neighbour of the Gibson family, including Bowes John Gibson, brother to Elizabeth and Sarah, and the other executor of the latter’s will.\n\nThomas Windle Esquire of Mile End seems to have been married twice and to have had three children, two of whom survived. On 3rd January 1791, Thomas Hattam Windle was christened at the church of St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney. He was the son of Thomas Windle Esq of Mile End Old Town and his wife Elizabeth. The name ‘Hattam’ provides an immediate connection with the family of Richard Windle, three of whose siblings had the same middle name, and at least two of whom passed it on to their own children.\n\nSadly, this particular Thomas Hattam Windle died when he was only three months old. His mother Elizabeth must have died soon afterwards, perhaps in childbirth, since in 1794, Thomas Windle, a gentleman of Mile End Old Town, and his wife Frances, had a daughter named Mary baptised at St Dunstan’s. The same couple’s daughter Sarah was christened there two years later, in 1796.\n\nI can’t find records of any other children born to Thomas Windle after this date, nor have I found either marriage or death records for Thomas, Elizabeth or Frances. The absence of a will for Thomas seems very odd, too, particularly since Thomas Windle Junior seems to have left his two surviving children well provided for.\n\nNeither Mary nor Sarah Windle married, and in fact the two sisters seem to have lived together on their inherited income for the remainder of their lives. They appear to have moved around the south of England, using their shared inheritance to endow and support various High Anglican churches. At the time of the 1841 census they were both in their forties, living on independent means, and sharing a house in Oxford with Stephen Reay, his wife Eleanora, and a young female servant. The census record describes Stephen as a ‘clerk’, but that hardly does him justice: he was a clergyman, professor of Arabic at Oxford, and sub-Librarian at the Bodleian.\n\nIn 1851 the Windle sisters were living in High Road, Leyton, Essex, with two female servants: Mary and Sarah described themselves to the census clerk as a ‘gentleman’s daughters’. The sisters were said to be ‘fundholders’ ten years later, when the 1861 census found them living with a cook and housemaid in Brighton, where they appear to have funded the building of a new Anglo-Catholic church.\n\nBy 1871 Mary and Sarah had moved back to Oxford, to Stanley Villa at 2 St Giles Road, Headington. When the census was taken in that year they had a visitor: John William Burgon, the vicar of the university church of St Mary the Virgin, later the Dean of Chichester.\n\nIt was at Stanley Villa that Mary Windle died on 11th July 1880, at the age of 86, leaving a personal estate valued at ‘under £9,000’. I haven’t found a record for her sister Sarah’s death, but I assume it must also have been in 1880, since before the year was out, Rev Burgon would erect a stained glass window in the parish church of Houghton Conquest, Bedfordshire, as a memorial to three benefactors, Eliza Hargrave and Mary and Sarah Windle.\n\nWhat do we know about the origins of Thomas Windle Esquire and his connection with the Windles of Shropshire? If he was, as seems likely, the son of Thomas Windle (Senior) of Bethnal Green, then perhaps he was the son of Thomas and Sarah Windle of Bethnal Green who was christened at St Mary, Whitechapel, in 30th October 1748. On the other hand, that would mean he was already 43 when his first son Thomas Hattam Windle was born in 1791, which seems unlikely: so perhaps this was his father and there was a third Thomas Windle in the generation before? At any rate, the Thomas and Sarah Windle whose child were christened in 1748 were almost certainly the couple who declared their intention to marry in an allegation of 29th October 1747. Thomas Windle was said to be a 30-year-old ‘chymist and widower’ of St Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street in the City of London, while his bride to be was Sarah Sculthorpe, a 26-year-old widow of the parish of St Mary, Whitechapel (though interestingly the Sculthorpes seem to have been associated with the parish of St Sepulchre, Holborn, the favoured London church of the Windle family). According to a record found at origins.net, in 1762 Thomas son of Thomas Windle of Old Fish Street, London, chemist was apprenticed to to Rees Williams, 17 Dec 1762, of the Fishmongers’ Company.\n\nThe fact that Thomas Windle Esquire Junior of Mile End Old Town gave his short-lived son the middle name ‘Hattam’ identifies him as a member of the same family as Richard Eykin Windle. However, the precise nature of his connection to that family remains to be determined.\n\nMy 5 x great grandmother Elizabeth Holdsworth née Gibson died on 1st March 1809 at the age of 76 and was buried a week later in the churchyard of St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney. In her last will and testament, signed and sealed on 11th February, Elizabeth appointed Sarah Parker as her executrix and Richard E. Windle as executor.\n\nSarah Parker was Elizabeth’s daughter from her second marriage, to Joseph Holdsworth, who had died fourteen years before in 1795. Born in South Weald, Essex, Sarah had first married plumber Edward Porter at St Botolph’s church, Bishopsgate, in 1786, when she was nineteen. Edward died in Mile End Old Town in 1799 at the age of 33, leaving Sarah with a five-year-old child, also named Edward, who died three years later in 1802. In the following year, Sarah married William Parker of Whitechapel at the church of St Matthew, Bethnal Green.\n\nWilliam Parker was one of the witnesses to his mother-in-law Elizabeth Holdsworth’s will, as was Sarah herself, together with her younger brother, my 4 x great grandfather William Holdsworth. The fourth witness was Richard Windle, the same person that Elizabeth had appointed to act as executor of the will.\n\nWho was Richard Windle? The question is made more interesting by the fact that another person with the same surname, Thomas Windle, had been appointed as co-executor of her will by Elizabeth’s unmarried sister, Sarah Gibson, some twenty years earlier, in 1789. So who were the Windles, and what was their relationship to the Holdsworths?\n\nI’m reasonably certain that the Richard E. Windle named in Elizabeth Holdsworth’s will was Richard Eykyn Windle, a surgeon and apothecary who lived in Wellclose Square, Whitechapel. He was born in 1782 in Claverley, Shropshire, the son of another Richard Windle (1721 – 1786) and his wife Anne Eykin (1746 – 1786). The Windles and the Eykins, rather like my Byne and Manser ancestors, seem to have combined rural, landowning roots with a foothold in London and in ‘trade’. Richard Windle senior and Anne Eykin had married at the church of St Sepulchre, Holborn, in 1779: at the time, he was a widower of 57 while she was a spinster of 33.\n\nLike the Windles, the Eykin family had their origins in Shropshire. Ann was the daughter of John Eykin of Ackleton and Martha Pitt of Astley Abbotts. However, at least one of her siblings had also been married at St Sepulchre’s, Holborn: four years earlier her younger brother John had married Elizabeth Browning there. John Eykin junior remained in London, living at Smithfield Bars and working as an oil merchant.\n\nRichard Eykyn Windle was the fourth of five children, his siblings being Thomas Hattam Windle (born 1779), John Hattam Windle (1780), Ann Hattam Windle (1782) and Edward Whitmore Windle (1784). Thomas, the eldest son, appears to have remained in Shropshire and inherited the family farm at Claverley. The 1851 census describes him as a farmer of 126 acres employing 11 labourers. His younger siblings all seem to have moved to London. Ann Hattam Windle married James West, a widower from the parish of St Mary, Rotherhithe, in 1801. Edward Whitmore Windle married Anne Jones at St Leonard’s, Shoreditch, in 1804, and then followed his sister to Rotherhithe, before settling in Stepney.\n\nAs for John Hattam Windle, he followed a similar profession to his cousin John Eykin, working as an oil and colour merchant. In 1811 John married Jane Byron at St Mary’s church, Whitechapel. She was the daughter of John Byron of 50 Whitechapel (High Street), who may also have been an oil and colourman. Certainly his son George was, and he and John Windle went into business together at the same address: they insured their premises together in 1826.\n\nHowever, before setting up shop with his brother-in-law, John Windle had been be involved in another partnership, a few doors away in the same street. On 1st July 1812, this notice appeared in the London Gazette:\n\nThe Copartnership existing between us, and carried on under the firm of Parker and Windle, Oil and Colourmen, at No. 47, Whitechapel, in the County of Middlesex, was this day dissolved by mutual consent.—Witness our Hands,\n\nWilliam Parker. John Hattam Windle\n\nCould this be the William Parker who married Sarah Porter née Holdsworth in 1803? After all, we know from the marriage record that he was from Whitechapel. And if so, does this help to explain the connection between the Windles and the Holdsworths?\n\nIt may not be a coincidence that a month after he dissolved his partnership with John Hattam Windle, William Parker took out a patent for an improvement in the manufacture of green paint. His fortunes were shortlived, however: six years later, in June 1818, William Parker of High Street, Whitechapel, Middlesex, oilman and colour manufacturer, was declared bankrupt.\n\nI’ve found the will of a Whitechapel oil and colourman named William Parker, but he died in 1799. At first, I thought that the William who was in partnership with John Windle might be his son. However, the will fails to mention any children. On the other hand, there is a reference to a nephew named William, as well as a niece named Sarah. William’s mother Mary is also mentioned, which should help in tracing the family.\n\nAccording to the Whitechapel parish register, William Parker of High Street was buried on 11th August 1799. This fits with the dates on the will: it was signed on 26th June and proved on 13th August. Helpfully, the register tells us that William was 50 years old when he died, so he was born in about 1749. The cause of death seems to have been dropsy. Interestingly, on the very same day, Mary Parker, aged 82, from the same address, was buried; she died of old age. I assume this was William’s mother.\n\nWe now need to find a William Parker born in about 1749 to a mother named Mary, who was herself born in about 1717. We then need to discover another son born to the same parents, who had children named William and Sarah. Perhaps doing so will help to solve some of the mysteries surrounding the connections between the Parkers and the Holdsworths. For the link did not begin with the younger William Parker marriage to Sarah Porter in 1803. Nine years earlier, when married to Edward Porter, Sarah had given her son the name Edward Parker Porter, suggesting an already-existing association with the family, perhaps through Edward senior. Then there is the question of whether the Thomas Parker who married another Sarah Holdsworth, daughter of my 4 x great grandfather William, in 1821, was a member of the same family.\n\nI’ll be following the trail of the Parkers and the Windles in future posts. I’m still not sure how, if at all, the Thomas Windle who witnesses the will of Sarah Gibson in 1789 was connected to Richard Windle and his family.\n\nTo return finally to Richard Eykin Windle. He died less than two years after witnessing the will of Elizabeth Holdsworth, at the age of 28, and was buried on 5th January 1811 in a vault, presumably one belonging to his family, at the church of St Sepulchre, Holborn. According to the parish register, his address was Smithfield Bars, though in his will, he states that he lives at Wellclose Square. Perhaps he spent his final days being cared for by his uncle and aunt, John and Elizabeth Eykin, who lived at the former address? Certainly his will was signed and sealed there, and makes prominent mention of his uncle and aunt, as well as his now-widowed sister Anne West and his brother John.\n\nRichard’s younger brother Edward Whitmore Windle died seven months after him, at the age of 27, and was buried in the same vault at St Sepulchre’s. John Hattam Windle died at Montague Street, Whitechapel, in 1833 at the age of 52 and was buried at St Mary’s church, Whitechapel. At the time of the 1861 census, his widow Jane, now 75, could be found living in Osborne Street, Whitechapel, with her two unmarried daughters Jane and Elizabeth, her son Hattam, a clerk in a London bank, her 80-year-old brother (and her late husband’s erstwhile business partner) George, and three servants.\n\nFollowing on from my last post, I’ve been exploring what Walter Charles Renshaw’s 1913 book about the Byne family of Sussex can tell us about my own direct ancestors.\n\nRenshaw informs us that Stephen Byne, as the eldest son of Magnus Byne of Clayton-cum -Keymer, was his father’s heir, and as such he inherited the advowson of the parish in a deed dated 13th June 1671. An adowson is the right in law of a patron to present a nominee for appointment to a vacant benefice or church living. Apparently this document explicitly describes Stephen as a citizen and upholder of London, thus confirming the link between the Clayton and the London Bynes. Stephen would later sell the advowson to Edward Blaker Esquire of Buckingham in Old Shoreham.\n\nRenshaw’s book also includes a transcription of parts of Stephen Byne’s will of 1674. In my own transcription, I mistook the name of the Sussex village where Stephen owned property: it was Wadhurst and the name of the farm was Flotting Deane. I can also see now that the name of the cousin who acted as an overseer of the will was John Manser, who was obviously not (as I had suggested) the husband of Stephen’s sister in law Dorcas Mercer. Apparently the Mansers were another old Sussex family, related to the Bynes by marriage. In a footnote, Renshaw informs us that John Manser of East Smithfield in the parish of St Botolph’s, Aldgate, was an apothecary who made his will in December 1680 (proved on 9th April 1681) appointing his ‘kinsman John Byne of Tower Hill’ as one of the overseers: another sign, if one were needed, of the link between John and Stephen Byne, and between ‘my’ Byne family and the Bynes of Sussex.\n\nStephen Byne married Rebecca Whiting, daughter of Thomas and Frances Whiting. Renshaw adds to our knowledge of the latter family by informing us that Frances was a widow when she married Thomas, that her previous surname was Bygrave, and that she had a daughter Mary from her earlier marriage.\n\nRenshaw found a burial record for Stephen Byne – wrongly entered in the St Botolph’s parish register as Stephen Boynes, an upholsterer of Tower Hill, on 11th March 1675. Curiously, Renshaw claims that Stephen and Rebecca Byne had two children, Rebecca and Stephen, but I remain sceptical, since no children are mentioned in Stephen’s will. Apparently Rebecca was buried at Hurstpierpoint, Sussex in 1687, and Stephen married Jane Lintott at the same place in 1704. The location makes me wonder if, despite the similarity of names, these two children actually belonged to another branch of the Byne family.\n\nUntil I came across Renshaw’s book, I had no information about Edward, brother of John and Stephen Byne, apart from a passing reference to him in Stephen’s will. Apparently he remained in Sussex, marrying firstly Bridget, widow of Reuben Jeffery of W(h)atlington in 1679, and secondly Mary. By his first wife Edward had three children – Magnus in 1680, Stephen in 1683 and Edward in 1684 – and by his second wife he had four more children – Elizabeth in 1692, Henry in 1695, John in 1697 and Anne in 1700.\n\nIt seems Edward was churchwarden at Whatlington and had ‘serious difficulties’ with the rector, John Dodderidge, to the extent of creating a disturbance in a time of divine service including ‘rude speech and actions’, as well taking away two of the church bells, as a result of which he was excommunicated. There was also the issue of non-payment of tithes, and it seems that litigation between Edward Byne and Rev Dodderidge lingered on until 1704.\n\nAs for my 8 x great grandfather John Byne, Renshaw informs us that he was the youngest son and therefore ‘customary heir’ of his mother Ann, first wife of Magnus Byne of Clayton. In this capacity he was admitted to the copyholds of the manor of Clayton on 25th October 1665. According to Wikipedia, ‘copyhold tenure was tenure of land according to the custom of the manor’. On 14th October John surrendered the copyholds to William Crase who was from Pycombe near Clayton. By a deed dated 19th October 1676 between George Scrase of Aldgate, apothecary, and John Byne of the Minories, Aldgate, Scrase sold and conveyed to John two closes of land in Tunbridge containing nine acres. Interestingly, George Crase, who was the son of William Crase’s brother James, was an apothecary in the parish of St Olave’s, Southwark – the same part of London where John’s younger brother Magnus followed the same profession.\n\nCuriously, Renshaw claims that this deed describes John Byne as a merchant taylor, and he comments that on the fact that John does not appear in the freemen’s list of the Merchant Taylor’s Company. However, my 8 x great grandfather’s will describes him very clearly as a ‘citizen and stationer’. Since all the other details tally, I’m quite sure that these documents describe the same John Byne – so perhaps the property deed made a mistake, or he changed his occupation between 1676 and 1689?\n\nRenshaw confirms the names and dates of some of John and Alice Byne’s children, though he didn’t manage to come across my 7 x great grandmother Mary. This means that he misses the import of references to Joseph and Mary Greene, and to John and Mary Gibson, in Alice’s will.\n\nI’d failed to find any trace of John and Alice’s sons John, Magnus and Thomas after their christenings, but Renshaw had managed to track them down. He discovered a bill in Chancery filed on 22nd January 1716 by John Byne of London, mariner, against his mother Alice. John claimed that, in his will of 1698, William Forest of Badsey in Worcestershire, an uncle of Alice Byne’s, had given all his lands in Badsey to Alice for life and to her son John Byne in fee, and also bequeathed his personal estate equally between them. The complaint was that Alice had felled and converted to her own use a large quantity of timber on these lands.\n\nThe document is interesting, not only because it tells us what became of John Byne junior, but because it lends support to my theory that the Anne Forest referred to in John Byne senior’s will (see last post) was not his mother, as he describes her, but his mother-in-law. If William Forest was Alice’s uncle, then Anne Forest was probably her mother.\n\nRenshaw comments that John Byne junior’s remainder in this property must have been sold, since in his will of 1728, John Boddington of Stepney, citizen and apothecary, ‘made a devise of his reversion in freehold lands at Badsey expectant on the death of Alice Byne’. Interestingly, Boddington appointed Joseph Greene, goldsmith, as one of his executors ‘and gave a legacy of £10 for mourning to Mary Greene his wife’. Renshaw comments that ‘probably these are the persons of those names mentioned in Alice Byne’s will’. Being unaware of the existence of Mary Byne, daughter of John and Alice, Renshaw is unable to make the connection that we can: Mary Greene was John and Alice Byne’s daughter and Joseph Greene their son-in-law, and they were my 7 x great grandparents.\n\nApparently John and Alice Byne sent their sons to Merchant Taylors School. John junior appears in the school register on 11th September 1693. Renshaw claims that he would later marry a woman named Jane and have a son, also named John, born in the Minories and christened at St Botolph’s, Aldgate on 6th March 1708. Magnus, son of John and Alice, appears in the register on 11th September 1695. Renshaw claims that he died a bachelor on 30th May 1716 ‘apud vel prope Guineam’ (at or near Guinea), so perhaps he was a mariner too? Letters of administration for his effects were granted to his mother and principal creditor, Alice Byne, widow. As for Thomas Byne, he also appears in the school register in September 1695. His will, dated 12th November 1728, apparently reveals that he was a mariner of St Botolph’s, Aldgate, about to set sail on His Majesty’s ship, the Deal Castle.\n\nThe other member of the Byne family who attended Merchant Taylors was another Magnus – the younger brother of Stephen, Edward and John. His name appears in the school register for 1674, when he would have been ten or eleven years old. Renshaw confirms that this is the same Magnus Byne who would marry Jane Dakin and practice as an apothecary in Southwark.\n\nYesterday I posted a transcription of the last will and testament of Alice Byne, my newly-discovered 8 x great grandmother. When Alice wrote her will in 1733, George II was in the seventh year of his reign and Robert Walpole was Britain’s prime minister. In this post, I want to discuss what light Alice Byne’s will can shine on her own life and on the lives of her relatives.\n\nWe learn that in 1733, when Alice wrote her will, she was still living in the parish of St Botolph, Aldgate – most likely in the family home at Tower Hill where she and her late husband John had been living in the 1670s and 1680s.\n\nIn addition, we learn that Alice owned property in a number of other locations. She held freehold property in Distaff Lane, and also in the parishes of St Margaret Moses, Friday Street, and St Nicholas Cole Abbey. We’ve come across the Distaff Lane property before. When Alice’s granddaughter Mary Gibson – widow of John Gibson and daughter of Joseph Greene and Mary Byne – wrote her will in 1788, she mentioned ‘all that my messuage or tenement and premises with the appurts used as a sugar house and situate in Little Distaff Lane London’, so presumably she was the eventual inheritor of this part of Alice’s estate. (Little) Distaff Lane ran south from Cannon Street (see map below). The same property is also mentioned in the will of Mary Gibson’s unmarried daughter Sarah, written in 1789. The property obviously continued to pass down through the Gibson family, since it is referred to in the 1826 will of Mary Catherine Gibson (widow of Bowes John Gibson, Mary Gibson’s son – and Alice Byne’s great grandson), who writes of ‘having purchased my son William Henry’s and my daughter Elizabeth’s shares in the freehold premises in Distaff Lane’.\n\nAs for Alice’s other London properties, St Margaret Moses was a parish in the City of London (though the actual church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and not rebuilt) and Friday Street runs parallel to Distaff Lane. The church of St Nicholas Cole Abbey was also destroyed in the Great Fire but rebuilt and stands in what is now Queen Victoria Street, just south of Distaff Lane. As can be seen from John Rocque’s map (published only eight years after Alice Byne’s death), all of these properties were in the heart of the City of London, close to St Paul’s (see map above).\n\nAlice also owned what she describes as ‘all that my meadow’ in the village of Badsey in Worcestershire ‘which I purchased of Elizabeth Badsey and Richard Badsey her Son’. Badsey is about two miles east of Evesham. Apparently there have always been people in the village whose surname is the same as the name of the village. There were a number of people with the names Elizabeth and Richard living in the area at this time. At this stage I’m not sure whether this means that Alice had a family connection to Badsey (for now, her origins remain obscure) or whether it simply reflects a business transaction.\n\nWhat can we infer from Alice’s will about her family’s circumstances in 1733? We know that she and her late husband John had five children who were still living at the time of the latter’s death: John, Alice, Mary, Magnus and Thomas. However, only the two daughters are mentioned in the will: Mary (my 7 x great grandmother) who was married to Joseph Green, and Alice, the widow of Thomas Bouts. This suggests that John, Magnus and Thomas were no longer alive, but further research will be necessary to confirm this.\n\nAlice’s will confirms what we already know about the family of her daughter Mary (my 6 x great grandmother). In 1733 she had been married to Joseph Green for twenty-two years, but by this date only their daughter Mary was still living. In 1729 Mary had married John Gibson. The three Gibson daughters mentioned in the will – Mary, Jane and Elizabeth – would have been very young at this date. The youngest of them, Elizabeth, my 5 x great grandmother, was christened on 17th May 1733, only three months before Alice wrote her will.\n\nAs for Alice Byne’s other surviving daughter Alice, she had married Thomas Bouts in 1733. I’ve found a record for the christening at St Botolph’s in 1708 of ‘Tho Boote’, son of Thomas and Alice of Tower Hill, but so far no trace of Anne’s baptism (it’s probably hidden behind one of the variant spellings of Bouts, which are almost as many and diverse as those for Byne). I’ve found land tax records for Thomas Bouts in various parts of London, including Portsoken, which is a district in the eastern part of the city, near Aldgate. In 1710, a Thomas Bouts was included under the heading ‘weavers’ in an electoral register of London liverymen. To date, I’ve found no record of Thomas’ death. However, we know that his widow Alice would die in 1760 and be buried at St Botolph’s on 20th April: the parish register describes her as being ‘of St Olave Southwark’, so this may indicate where she lived in her old age and provide a clue to the whereabouts of her daughter Anne.\n\nAs I’ve learned from examining other seventeenth- and eighteenth-century wills, the word ‘cousin’ can cover a multitude of relations and is no guide to the exact connection with a testator. I assume that ‘my Cousin Elizabeth Byne Spinster’ was a relative of Alice’s late husband John, perhaps his sister, but confirmation will have to wait on further investigation of the Byne family tree. ‘My Cousin Anne Payton Widow’ could be any one of a number of people living in London and elsewhere at this time, and once again further research will be needed to establish her identity and precise relationship to Alice Byne. As for ‘my Cousin Jemima Rix (Wife of Leonard Rix of Bow Lane London Barber)’, I’ve discovered that, on 16th September 1722 John, son of ‘Leonard and Gemima Rix’ was christened at the church of St Mary le Bow. Someone by the name of Leonard Rix is listed as a Stationers’ Company apprentice in London at this period: although the person mentioned in Alice Byne’s will was supposedly a barber (perhaps a barber-surgeon?), the fact that John Byne was a stationer points to a possible link. ‘My Cousin Alice Elliot otherwise Burroughs’ was obviously a significant figure in Alice Byne’s life, since she receives not only a weekly payment of two shillings from the latter’s estate, but also ‘the Sum of Ten pounds ….to cloath her in a decent manner’. However, more information is needed before I can be sure of this person’s identity or her relationship to Alice Byne. Finally ‘my Cousin Richard Boulton the Elder’ is perhaps the person of that name who is listed as paying land tax in the parish of St Botolph Aldgate in 1741 and 1742, but once again there are a number of people with the same name and further investigation would be needed before determining which one was Alice Byne’s relation.\n\nIn the last post I wrote about my 7 x great grandmother Mary Greene née Byne, the wife of London goldsmith Joseph Greene, and my discovery of new information about her family. The document that definitively confirmed that Mary was the son of stationer John Byne and his wife Alice was the latter’s will, written in 1733 and published on her death five years later.\n\nWhen Alice Byne (my 8 x great grandmother) composed her will, she had been a widow for forty-three years, her husband John having predeceased her in 1690. Her daughter Mary had been married to Joseph Green since 1701, and indeed their daughter, another Mary, was now married to John Gibson. Another of Alice’s daughters, also named Alice, was a widow like her mother, her husband Thomas Bouts having died at some point after the birth of their daughter Anne in 1715.\n\nAlice Byne’s will is a rich source of information about her family and circumstances, and I’ll analyse what it tells us in another post. In this post, however, I want to share my transcription of the will itself. As always, I have mostly retained the original spelling and punctuation:\n\nIn the Name of God Amen I Alice Byne of the parish of Saint Buttolph without Aldgate in London Widow being in health of Body and of sound and perfect Mind and Memory (praised be to God therefore) do this fourteenth day of August in the seventh year of the Reigne of Our Sovereigne Lord George the Second by the Grace of God of Great Britain France and Ireland King Defender of the Faith and so forth and in the year of Our Lord One thousand seven hundred and Thirty three make and publish this my last Will and Testament in manner following (that is to say) First I recommend my Soul into the hands of almighty God who gave it me and my Body I commit to the Earth to be decently buryed by my Executrices hereinafter named and after payment of all my just debts and funerall charges I give and dispose of the Remainder of that Estate with which it hath pleased God to bless me in manner following (that is to say) First I give and bequeath unto my Cousin Elizabeth Byne Spinster Ten pounds of lawfull money of Great Britain Also I give and bequeath unto my Cousin Anne Payton Widow ten pounds of like money Also I give and bequeath unto my Cousin Jemima Rix (Wife of Leonard Rix of Bow Lane London Barber) Thirty pounds of like money Also I give and bequeath to my Son in Law Joseph Green and unto Mary his wife ten pounds apiece of like money also I give and bequeath unto my Grandson John Gibson and unto Mary his Wife Ten pounds apiece of like money and unto their three daughter Mary Jane and Elizabeth Gibson I give and bequeath the sum of five pounds apiece of like money Also I do hereby order and direct and my Will and mind is that my said Executrices hereinafter named (out of the residue of my personal Estate hereinafter given and devised to them) do pay unto my Cousin Alice Elliot otherwise Burroughs Weekly and every Week during the terme of her natural life the weekly sume of Two Shillings of lawfull money of Great Britain the first payment thereof to begin and be made within the space of one Week next after my decease Also I give and bequeath unto my said Cousin Alice Elliot otherwise Burroughs the Sum of Ten pounds of like money (over and besides what I have hereinbefore given and bequeathed unto her) to cloath (?) her in a decent manner which I desire my said Executrices to pay unto the said Alice Elliot otherwise Burroughs within one month next after my decease Also I give and devise unto my daughter Alice Bouts Widow and to her heirs forever all that my Meadow situate and being in the parish of Badsey in the County of Worcester near the Will Taile (?) called Crabb Tree Close which I purchased of Elizabeth Badsey and Richard Badsey her Son now or late in the terme or occupation of Charles Simpson his undertenants or assigns also I give and devise unto my said daughter Alice Bouts all that my freehold Estate with the appurts Situate and being in Distaffe Lane London and in the parishes of Saint Margaret Moses Fryday Street and Saint Nicholas Coleabby or one of them and now or late in the Tenure or Occupation of William Ashurst Gentleman his undertenants or assigns for and during the Term of her natural life and from and after her decease.

Alice Byne. Signed Sealed published and declared by the said Alice Byne as and for her last Will and Testament in the presence of us who did each of us subscribe our names as Witnesses hereunto in her presence and at her request. Will: Jones. John Gibson. John Chorley.\n\nThis Will was proved at London before the Worshipfull Robert Chapman doctor of Laws and Surrogate of the Right Worshipfull John Bettesworth doctor of Laws Master Keeper or Commissary of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury lawfully constituted on the ninth day of March in the year of Our Lord One thousand seven hundred and thirty eight by the Oaths of Alice Bouts Widow the Daughter and Anne Bouts Spinster the Grandaughter of the said deceased and Executrixes named in the said Will To whom administration was granted of all and singular the Goods Chattels and Credits of the said deceased they being first sworn well and duly to administer the same.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I reported that a sudden whim had led to an important discovery about my 8 x great grandfather, Stepney mariner Captain William Greene (1626 – 1686). By searching for information in a slightly different way, I found out the name of his first wife – Jane. Now a similar thing has happened with the next generation, with even more fruitful results.\n\nI’ve never really paid much attention to my 7 x great grandmother, Mary Greene – the wife of Captain Greene’s son Joseph, a London citizen and goldsmith. I knew that she outlived her husband, who died in 1737 at the age of 60, and that after his death she purchased the estate of Woodredon near Waltham Abbey, Essex and gave it to her daughter, another Mary, and her husband John Gibson. Recently I found out that she was still alive some forty years later, when she was mentioned in her daughter’s inventory of John Gibson’s effects. This led to the discovery that the older Mary was involved in the brewing trade and that she was declared bankrupt in 1763, probably as a result of carrying her son-in-law’s debts following his arrest for fraud against the Crown. She must have been quite old by this time, and I imagine she probably died shortly afterwards. However, I’ve yet to find a definite record of her death or any evidence of a will.\n\nAs for Mary Greene’s origins, I’ve always assumed that these were obscure. We know that she and Joseph were married before 1703, when their son Joseph was born at Tower Hill and christened at St Botolph’s, Aldgate. They would also have a daughter Mary (my 6 x great grandmother) in 1710 and another daughter named Elizabeth in 1711. According to the inscription on the family tomb in Stepney churchyard, Joseph and Mary had a third daughter named Ann, but I haven’t yet found a record of her baptism. Of these children, only Mary would survive and in 1729 she would marry John Gibson.\n\nIf we consult the parish registers for this period, there are only a couple of marriages that fit the bill for Joseph and Mary. On 12th October 1693/4, Joseph Green married Mary Sias (?) at the church of St James, Clerkenwell. However, given that ‘my’ Joseph was born in 1677 and only began his apprenticeship to goldsmith Joseph Strong in 1692, this seems an unlikely candidate. The only other possibility is the marriage on 19th March 1701 at All Hallows, London Wall, between Joseph Green and Mary Byne. Joseph would have been 24 by this date and presumably ‘made free’ of his apprenticeship. The fact that Joseph’s daughter Mary would get married at the same church 28 years later also seems to be a good sign.\n\nFor some reason, until this week I had been misreading Mary Greene’s maiden name as Byrne when in fact it was Byne. My search for records of Mary Byrne had always drawn a blank, so I had more or less given up hope of discovering more about her family. Since ‘Byrne’ is an Irish name, I half-assumed that Mary’s family had migrated to London and that I would never find a record of her birth. But my realization that her name was actually Mary Byne has led to the discovery of a whole new branch of my maternal family tree.\n\nTo begin with, I struggled to find any further records for Mary. I came across a number of instances of the surname ‘Byne’ in various parts of London in this period, but the search was made difficult by variant spellings of the name. The closest match was a Mary Byne, born to draper William Byne and his wife Martha in the parish of St Clement Danes, Westminster. Then I came across a cluster of Bynes much closer to ‘home’, in the parish of St Botolph, Aldgate. John and Alice Byne lived in this area in the closing decades of the seventeenth century: in fact, they lived at Tower Hill, which was where Joseph Green would make his home.\n\nMy next breakthrough was discovering the last will and testament of John Byne, who died in 1690. He was a citizen and stationer, married to Alice, and his will conveniently lists their surviving children: John, Alice, Mary, Magnus and Thomas. I was able to cross-check this against the St Botolph’s parish register and realised that some of these records – including Mary’s christening – had been hidden behind variant spellings.\n\nOn 3rd September 1676, Alice, daughter of John and Alice Bynes of Tower Hill was christened at St Botolph, Aldgate. On 15th December 1679, John, son of John and Alice Bynes of the same address was christened. On 7th December 1683 Mary, daughter of John and Alice Boynes (transcribed as Baynes at Ancestry) was baptised. On 21st June 1685 Magnus, son of John and Alice Bines of Tower Hill was christened. I haven’t yet found a christening record for Thomas. In addition, the International Genealogical Index claims that John and Alice also had a daughter Ann in 1677 and another daughter with the same name in 1682, as well as another daughter named Alice in 1681.\n\nOn 22nd December 1703 Thomas Bouts, a 22-year-old bachelor from the parish of St Mary Whitechapel, declared his intention to marry Alice Byne, also 22, of St Botolph’s, Aldgate. The wedding took place at St Botolph’s on the following day. Interestingly, the address given at the christening of their son, Thomas junior, five years later, is Tower Hill. Did Thomas and Alice move into property owned by the Byne family after their marriage? And was this also how Joseph Green came to be living in the same area, following his marriage to Alice’s sister Mary in 1701?\n\nIf this is the right family, then Mary Byne would have been eighteen years old when she married Joseph Green. Taken together with the Tower Hill connection, this made it increasingly likely that I was on the right track. But final confirmation only came with my discovery of the will of Alice, widow of John Byne, written in 1733. Among other interesting information, this document includes the following passage (my italics):\n\nI give and bequeath to my Son in Law Joseph Green and to Mary his wife ten pounds apiece…also I give and bequeath unto my Grandson John Gibson and unto Mary his Wife ten pounds apiece…and unto their three daughters Mary Jane and Elizabeth Gibson I give and bequeath the sum of five pounds apiece.\n\nJohn Gibson was, of course, Alice Byne’s grandson-in-law, not her grandson, as becomes clear later in the will. Alice leaves property to ‘my said Grand daughter and God daughter the said Mary the said Wife of the said John Gibson’. John Gibson also acts as one of the three witnesses to the will. John and Mary Gibson were my 6 x great grandparents, and their daughter Elizabeth was my 5 x great grandmother.\n\nTo sum up, I have found conclusive evidence that my 7 x great grandmother Mary Greene, née Byne, was the daughter of John and Alice Byne, which makes the latter my 8 x great grandparents. Their wills have opened up a rich new seam of my family history, with connections stretching back through the seventeenth century in London and Sussex, which I will continue to explore in future posts.\n\nMy last post took another look at William Greene of Wapping Wall, mariner, weighing up the evidence that he might have been the son of my maternal 8 x great grandfather, Captain William Greene of Ratcliffe (1626 – 1686). My starting-point was the fact that the William Greene from Wapping had a son named William and a daughter named Mary – and we know from his will that Captain Greene had two grandchildren with these names. However, for a number of reasons I concluded that the mariner from Wapping was probably not my ancestor’s son.\n\nIn this post, I want to consider another William Greene who had children named William and Mary, which makes them candidates to be the grandchildren of Captain Greene. This William lived at various addresses in the parish of St Mary, Whitechapel, the neighbouring parish to Stepney, which was the home of my ancestor.\n\nOn 22nd September 1668 (eight years after the Restoration of the monarchy and two years after the Great Fire of London), William and ‘Sisly’ Greene had a daughter named Mary christened at St Mary’s. According to the parish register, the couple lived in Well Close, which was on the borders of Whitechapel and East Smithfield, between Cable Street and Ratcliffe Highway. Coincidentally, some two hunded years later a number of my paternal ancestors would be living in the same area.\n\nOn 14th January 1671, William and ‘Sissily’ Green had a son named William baptised at the same church. The register records their address as ‘in ye Salt peter’, which I take to mean Salt Petre Bank, a little to the west of Well Close.\n\nFinally, on 12th April 1674, the same couple had a son, Richard, christened. By now, they were living in ‘Rose Mary Lane’, just to the north of Salt Petre Bank and west of Well Close. This is another area with family associations: a hundred years or so later, Captain Greene’s granddaughter Mary and her husband John Gibson would own premises in Darby Street, off Rosemary Lane, and their daughter Elizabeth, my 6 x great grandmother, would live there during her first marriage to John Collins.\n\nSince these three addresses – Well Close, Salt Petre Bank and Rosemary Lane – are so close together (see map below), it’s possible that they refer to the same place. Either that, or William and Cecily Greene moved house a number of times within a very small area.\n\nIncidentally, the various renderings of Cecily’s name by the transcribers are candidates for my collection of Ancestry howlers. It doesn’t help that the parish clerk in Whitechapel struggled to spell the name, with ‘Sisly’ and ‘Sissily’ being two variations. But I’m not quite sure how the transcriber managed to read Cecily as ‘Giely’ and Sissily as ‘Fissaby’.\n\nIf they survived, then the William and Mary born to William and Cecily Greene would have been 14 and 17 in 1685, when Captain William Greene wrote his will. However, if they were his grandchildren, we would need to assume that their brother Richard had died in the meantime, since he is not mentioned in the will. Presumably, their parents, William and Cecily, would also need to have died, since they do not merit a reference in the will either.\n\nUnfortunately, the register at St Mary, Whitechapel does not record the occupation of the fathers of those christened, so we know little about William Greene, father of William and Mary, beyond his wife’s name and their various addresses. However, we can assume he was probably married some time around the 1660s, which would mean he could have been born in the mid 1640s – which would make it possible for him to be the son of Captain Greene.\n\nAt this stage, though, and until further evidence is forthcoming, that remains merely a possibility.\n\nIn the last post I mentioned my plan to revisit the will of William Greene, a mariner from Ratcliffe, Stepney, who died in 1634 – and who I still hope might be related to my 8 x great grandfather Captain William Greene, another Ratcliffe mariner, who died in 1686.\n\nMy revised transcription of the earlier William’s will corrected an important mistake in my original version. Initially, I thought that one of the witnesses of the will, and one of the two people named by William as its overseers, was called Jonas Jones. Revisiting the will, I could see that in fact his name was Jonas James. William Greene describes him as ‘my good friend’ and as ‘Mr Jonas James of Ratcliffe’. In this post, I want to share what I’ve managed to discover about Jonas James – and discuss what light (if any) this throws on the life of William Greene.\n\nI haven’t found a record of the birth or baptism of Jonas James, but we know from his will that he was born in Woodbridge, Suffolk, and from other sources that he was the son of another Jonas James and his wife Alice. Jonas James senior was a merchant, and he had two other sons, William and John, and a daughter named Alice. The transactions of Trinity House for 1617 mention Jonas James of Woodbridge in a list of shipowners and seamen trading in coal: I assume this is the elder Jonas, since by this date his son was living in Stepney.\n\nI would guess that Jonas James junior must have been born around 1580, since he was married for the first time in 1602, which was the last year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. On 17th January of that year, Jonas James and Elizabeth Bland, both of Ratcliffe, were married at the parish church of St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney. Elizabeth may have been the person of that name christened at the same church on 2nd July 1580: if so, she was the daughter of Robert Bland.\n\nJonas and Elizabeth James had at least nine children together, not all of whom survived to adulthood: they were Jonas (born in 1603), Alice (1605), Elizabeth (1608), Thomas (1612), Jonas (1613, suggesting the first Jonas junior had died), Thomas (1614, suggesting the first Thomas had also died), Frances (1617), John (1621) and Mary (1623). All of these children were born in Ratcliffe and christened at St Dunstan’s church.\n\nAccording to the Middlesex Sessions records, some time in the years 1612-1614, Thomas Reddishe, Thomas Godwoode and John Graves of Ratcliffe, yeomen, were tried for the crime of ‘breaking into the house of Jonas James of the same, sailor, at the same, and stealing seven pieces of linen worth £8 10s. belonging to the said Jonas.’\n\nIn 1622, the twentieth year of the reign of King James I, Jonas James senior, merchant of Woodbridge, Suffolk, died, leaving a considerable amount of property and money to his three sons and his daughter.\n\nOn 20th September 1625, the year in which Charles I came to the throne, Elizabeth, wife of Jonas James of Ratcliffe, mariner, was buried at St Dunstan’s church. She had died the same day, of plague. Elizabeth James was one of 23 plague victims buried in the churchyard on that day, and one of many hundreds of Stepney residents who died in the epidemic that month. (Just one week earlier, the wealthy ship owner and former London alderman John Vassall, another Ratcliffe resident, had succumbed and was also buried at St Dunstan’s.)\n\nTen months later, Jonas James married Martha Swallow, a widow from Poplar, at St Dunstan’s. Martha’s maiden name was Hunt (she was the daughter of John and Clement Hunt) and she was previously married to Limehouse shipwright John Swallow. I haven’t found records for any children born to Jonas and Martha.\n\nIn June 1626, Alice James, Jonas’ eldest daughter from his first marriage, married Ratcliffe mariner John Crowther at St Dunstan’s. In September 1634 (three months after Jonas James had witnessed his friend William Greene’s will), another of his daughters, Frances, married John Limbrey, another Ratcliffe mariner, at the same church. At some point Jonas’ daughter Elizabeth married shipwright Robert Tranckmore.\n\nJonas James junior is mentioned a number of times in the transactions of Trinity House. In December 1627 he was among the ‘owners and masters trading to Newcastle’ petitioning the King: there were similar petitions, also mentioning Jonas, in 1630 and 1632. In 1631, Jonas James’ name could be found on a communication to the Lord Commissioners of the Admiralty, adjudicating in a dispute between a merchant and a mariner. In 1635 his name was on a petition to the King concerning a plan to build lighthouses at Dover. He is also mentioned in a case in 1644 before the ‘Committee for the advance of money’ but unfortunately this is not accessible online without a subscription.\n\nThese documents, and especially his role in resolving the 1631 dispute, suggest that Jonas James was a ship’s master of some prominence, and perhaps one of the Elder Brothers of Trinity House – a position that would also be held by my ancestor, Captain William Greene. Searching these records has also led me to two records in the Trinity House archives that appear to mention the other William Greene – Jonas’ friend, the mariner who died in 1634. In 1617, a William Greene was among a number of ship masters and owners who ‘agreed to an imposition of £1,000 a year for 2 years to suppress Turkish pirates and to ensure more safety in trade and southern navigation.’ Trinity House promised that it would be levied for only two years, but it continued for four years and in 1625 the owners claimed that ‘double the agreed sum has been paid (namely £4,000), but they are still liable.’ They asked Trinity House ‘to petition the duke of Buckingham [as First Lord of the Admiralty] to end the imposition.’ The Duke, who was born George Villiers, had been the favourite and possibly the homosexual lover of James I; he continued to find royal favour and hold high office during Charles’ reign, until he was assassinated in1628. In February 1627, a William Greene was one of the inhabitants of Wapping who certified information about the loss of the John, ‘cast away in foul weather’ on a journey from London to Amsterdam in the previous October.\n\nSome time between 1626 and his death twenty years later, Jonas James junior moved from Ratcliffe across the Thames to Deptford. ‘Jonas James of Deptford in the County of Kent Maryner’ was buried at St Dunstan’s, Stepney, on 7th July 1646, two months after the surrender of King Charles I, which marked the end of the Civil War. The preamble to his will, written on 21st May that year, with its emphasis on the ‘original corruption’ in which he was conceived and born and its concern with his ‘sins and transgressions’ which have deserved divine ‘wrath and condemnation’, but at the same time trusting in the merits of ‘my blessed Saviour and redeemer Jesus Christ’, suggests that Jonas James was something of a Calvinist. The will mentions property in Romney Marsh, Kent, which Jonas holds of the ‘fellowes and Schollers of St Johns Collidge in Cambridge’. He leaves money and property to his wife Martha; to his son Thomas; to his daughter Elizabeth, her husband Robert Tranckmore and their children Jonas, Robert and Alice; to his daughter Alice, her husband John Crowther and their son James; and to his daughter Frances, wife of John Limbrey.\n\nAs well as leaving money to the poor people of Woodbridge and Ratcliffe, Jonas also bequeaths ten pounds to the corporation of Trinity House of Deptford, for the ‘use and comforte of the poore of the said Corporation’, at the discretion of the Master and Wardens, and five shillings each to the seven poor pensioners of the Trinity House almshouses in Deptford.\n\nWhat can this information tell us about his friend William Greene (d. 1634)? To be honest, there are no startling revelations here. The value of this research is in providing some context for William’s life, which might lead indirectly to useful discoveries in the future. However, we can infer from what we’ve found out about Jonas James that, as a ‘good friend’ and a fellow Ratcliffe mariner, William Greene was probably also a ship’s master, perhaps a ship owner, of some wealth and standing. Moreover, that if Jonas James was a senior member of Trinity House, then it seems likely that his friend William Greene was too. The incidental discovery of William’s name in the Trinity House records, mentioned above, is perhaps some confirmation of this. And as I noted in the last post, is the fact that ‘my’ Captain William Greene (d. 1686) was an Elder Brother and then Warden of Trinity House some tenuous evidence of a family link with his namesake earlier in the century?\n\nFinally, I found it interesting that Jonas James senior was involved in shipping coal from Newcastle to London. Perhaps his son, and maybe his friend William Greene, were also connected with this trade? It’s of interest for two reasons: firstly, William Greene’s son John was said (in his stepmother’s will) to be a mariner in Newcastle, and secondly, my 6 x great grandfather John Gibson (whose wife Mary was the granddaughter of ‘my’ William Greene) was a coal factor and lighterman. Was this trade passed down through the generations of the Greene family, perhaps?\n\nLast week I wrote about the petitioning of Parliament by my 6 x great grandfather John Gibson, a coal factor, who was seeking release from the Fleet Prison and relief from debts resulting from a fraud against the Crown. I’m grateful to Marcus Bateman, who is also researching ancestors involved in the eighteenth-century coal trade, for leaving a comment directing me to a number of other legal disputes involving John Gibson.\n\nThe National Archives have records of three Chancery cases in which John’s name appears to be mentioned. In 1725, John Gibson, merchant of London, and William Gibson, merchant of Rotterdam, were plaintiffs in a case in which the defendants were James Greive, his wife Elizabeth Greive, John Crawford, Robert Dennett Esq and Arthur Cox. In 1733, John Gibson, merchant and factor of London, was the plaintiff in a case where the defendant was Peter Barker. Finally, in 1735 John Gibson, merchant of London, was the plaintiff in a case in which the defendant was Ann Furrs, widow and administratix of Nicholas Furrs, deceased.\n\nI’ve requested copies of these documents and hope to view them in due course. Only a close examination of the full documents will reveal whether the John Gibson named in these cases is my ancestor. However, even the short descriptions at the National Archives site are intriguing. For example, who was William Gibson, merchant of Rotterdam? Was he a relative of John’s, perhaps his brother or father, and will exploring this case throw some much-needed light on my ancestor’s origins? I’m almost certain that the John Gibson in the third case is my 6 x great grandfather, since we know that Nicholas Furrs was his business partner. In the very first sentence of the pamphlet, setting out his case for release from prison, John Gibson writes that in 1721 he ‘entered into a Partnership with Nicholas Furs, who was then, and had long been, a Coal-Factor at the Port of London’. Writing about himself in the third person, John goes on to give details of his business relationship with Furrs, concluding:\n\nFrom Christmas 1720, to Christmas 1729, Gibson carried on the Business in Partnership with Furs, and the Partnership being then expired, Gibson agreed with Furs to give him 300l. a Year for 12 Years, on Condition he would quit the Business wholly to Gibson, and never act in it more; which Annuity was paid, and that together with Furs’s Stock, then drawn out of Trade, amounted to several thousands Pounds.\n\nI’ve managed to discover a fair amount about Furrs and his family from parish and other records, which I’ll share in another post. Suffice it to say here that Nicholas Furrs died in 1732, and obviously John Gibson was still pursuing his widow Ann three years later, though we’ll have to wait for full details of the case to discover the basis of his action against her.\n\nIn my search for more information about Furrs, I came across a puzzling entry in the Treasury records. On 21 April 1743, at the Treasury Chambers in Whitehall, with the Earl of Wilmington, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and a number of other government officers present, a petition was read ‘from John Gibson, late of West Ham, merchant, concerning his coal bonds with Nicholas Furrs, a coal merchant.’ What’s puzzling about this brief reference is John Gibson’s address. As far as we know, my ancestor lived at Tower Hill, in the parish of St Botolph’s, Aldgate, and maintained the country estate of Woodredon, at Waltham Abbey in Essex. This was the first time I had come across any mention of him living in West Ham.\n\nHowever, this was not the only document to make the connection. In the previous summer, two issues of The London Gazette had included references to John Gibson’s bankruptcy, and both gave his address as West Ham. Here is an extract from the edition of 22nd – 26th June:\n\nWhereas a Commission of Bankrupt is awarded and issued forth against John Gibson, of West Ham, in the County of Essex, Merchant, Dealer in Coals, and Chapman, and he being declared a Bankrupt, is hereby required to surrender himself to the Commissioners in the said Commission named, or the major Part of them, on the 10th and 17th of July next, and on the 7th of August following, at Three of the Clock in the Afternoon on each of the said Days, at Guildhall, London, and make a full Discovery and Disclosure of his Estate and Effects ; when and where the Creditors are to come prepared to prove their Debts, and at the second Sitting to chuse Assignees, and at the last Sitting the said Bankrupt is required to finish his Examination, and the Creditors are to assent to or dissent from the Allowance of his Certificate. All Persons indebted to the said Bankrupt, or that have any of his Effects, are not to pay or deliver the same but to whom the Commissioners shall appoint, but give Notice to Mr. Hooper, Attorney, in Threadneedle-street, London.\n\nAnd this is from the edition that appeared on 7th – 10th August:\n\nPursuant to an Order made by the Right Honourable the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, for enlarging the time for John Gibson, of West Ham in the County of Essex, Merchant, Dealer in Coals and Chapman, a Bankrupt, to make a full Discovery of his Estate and Effects for Forty nine Days, to be computed from the 7th of August instant; This is to give Notice that the major Part of the Commissioners named in the said Commission will meet on the 25th Day of September next, at Three in the Afternoon, at Guildhall, London, when and where the said Bankrupt is required to surrender himself, and make a full Discovery and Disclosure of his Estate and Effects, and finish his Examination; and such of the Creditors of the said John Gibson, as have not already proved their Debts, may then do the same, and the Creditors are to assent or dissent from the Allowance of his Certificate.\n\nWhat are we to make of this? My first concern was that the John Gibson who was convicted of fraud, made bankrupt and imprisoned in the Fleet might not, after all, be my ancestor – but a completely different John Gibson residing, not in Aldgate or Waltham Abbey, but in West Ham. This sent me back to the document that first alerted me to John’s misfortunes: the ‘declaration instead of a true and perfect inventory’ drawn up after his death by his widow Mary. Written in 1764, Mary Gibson’s declaration clearly places her husband in the parish of St Botolph, Aldgate, and also mentions her mother Mary Greene, as well as referring to property in Rosemary Lane, an address that was definitely linked to ‘my’ Gibson ancestors. So there seems little doubt that the John Gibson mentioned in this document was my ancestor.\n\nHow sure can we be, though, that he is also the John Gibson who worked as a coal factor and was convicted of fraud against the Crown? Mary’s declaration states that ‘in or about the year 1742’ the Crown issued an ‘extent’ against her husband and that some time after this he was declared bankrupt. He was later ‘arrested at the suit of the Crown under the said Extent and lay in Prison several Years til he was released from thence by an order of Parliament on giving security for his appearance whenever called on by the Crown’.\n\nMary Gibson’s account of her husband’s travails closely matches the details in the case of ‘the King against John Gibson’ which came to court on 3rd February 1743. The report of that case refers to an extent issued on 17th June 1742, a second extent on 7th July that year, and then a commission of bankruptcy issued against the defendant. The document informs us that John Gibson was ‘indebted to the King in a large sum of money in several bonds for the duty on coals’.\n\nNow, of course, it’s entirely possible that there was more than one John Gibson who had an extent issued against him by the Crown in 1742, and was then made bankrupt. But it seems rather unlikely. On the basis of the information we have available, I’m inclined to draw the conclusion that my ancestor, John Gibson of St Botolph’s, Aldgate, was in fact the coal factor convicted of fraud, to whom this and other legal documents of the time refer.\n\nBut if that’s the case, then how do we account for the reference to West Ham in the documents cited above? I think there are two possible answers to this question. One is that my ancestor did actually purchase property in that part of Essex, despite already owning Woodredon at Waltham Abbey. In a history of Essex written in 1814, I found the following reference:\n\nThe manor of Woodredon was sold by the trustees before mentioned to John Gibson, to whom it belonged in 1742; it then became possessed by his wife’s mother, Mrs. Mary Greene, from whom it was purchased in 1765 by sir John Henniker, afterwards created lord Henniker, whose grandson, John Minor Henniker, esq. is the present proprietor.\n\nWe already knew that Mary Greene was the original purchaser of Woodredon: she bought it from the Duke of Bedford in 1738 (the year after the death of her husband, goldsmith Joseph Greene, and presumably using money that he left her) and ‘immediately conveyed it to her daughter and son-in-law, Mary and John Gibson.’ In an earlier post, I wondered how we could reconcile John’s bankruptcy and dire financial situation with his possession of an extensive country estate, and I speculated that he might have signed over ownership to his mother-in-law, as we know he did with other property, to prevent it being seized by his creditors. This new source appears to confirm my hunch. The date of 1742 is significant, it being the year in which the extent was issued against John Gibson by the Crown; ‘it then became possessed…’ suggests that the transfer of ownership to Mary Greene happened around this time.\n\nPerhaps John Gibson purchased another country property – this time in West Ham – after surrendering ownership of Woodredon, while at the same time maintaining his London home at Tower Hill? However, the Treasury record from 1743 describes John as ‘late of West Ham’, suggesting that he no longer lived there. Or might this be a reference to John’s ‘violent rescue’ from the first attempt to arrest him, and a subsequent period ‘on the run’?\n\nAt first, the possibility that the Gibsons lived, at some point, in West Ham, looked as though it might help to solve one or two remaining mysteries surrounding the family. Firstly, John’s pamphlet appealing to be released from prison makes reference to his ‘nine small children’, whereas I have only been able to find baptism records in the St Botolph’s register for seven children. As far as I can tell, no Gibson children were christened at Waltham Abbey. However, I have now searched the West Ham records and can find no Gibsons baptised there during the period in question. Secondly, I wondered if the West Ham connection might help to explain how Frances Collins, the daughter of John Gibson’s daughter Elizabeth by her first marriage, came to be living in nearby Romford at the time of her own marriage to John Godfrey Schwarz.\n\nHowever, another, more mundane solution also suggests itself. What if the reference to West Ham in these documents is a mistake? What if the first clerk who wrote that John Gibson was from West Ham got it wrong – and meant to write Waltham instead? ‘John Gibson late of Waltham’ would make perfect sense if, in 1742-1743, he had recently signed over the ownership of Woodredon to his mother-in-law and was no longer living there. Repeated references to West Ham in other documents could be explained by other clerks copying the original mistake, and by the fact that John himself was not available – since at the time he was evading arrest – to correct the error.\n\nI’m hoping the records of the Chancery cases from the National Archives might throw some light on this matter."
