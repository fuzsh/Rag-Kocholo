        "text": "Bruce is Cath's partner. They live together in a room in the Intercontinental on Freeside.\n\nDescription[]\n\nBruce is described \"like a gender switch version of Cath, right down to the freckles\" and the brown eyes. Case thought he has the attention span of a gnat, and didn't care maintaining a discussion with him.\n\nHe has a Honda trike.\n\nBio[]\n\nBruce lives with Cath for a long time in an Intercontinental room, so long that they have decorated it with their own things. It is possible he was a drug dealer. One time they returned to Earth to visit the Sense/Net Pyramid.\n\nSoon later Cath brought to their room a newly met friend who called himself \"Lupus\", wanting to get high with betaphenethylamine. He explained that in Chiba he got a pancreas with peculiar properties that can't metabolize drugs. Bruce asked if he could sue them; Case replied that \"it's just one of those things, you know? Like tissue matching and all that\" but Bruce's eyes had already gone numb with boredom. He offered him to taste some beta, and if his pancreas could pass on it, the first time is free, and passed him a bright blue dermadisk.\n\nLater that day while Bruce and Cath had a shower, \"Lupus\" showed up; Bruce opened the door naked, dripping wet, with enormous pupils; surprised he asked Lupus to wait or if he wants a shower. Lupus pushed his arm aside and stepped inside and asked for help, because they are friends and he is really glad to see him. Bruce blinked and agreed. Lupus asked to go to an address and Bruce offered to take him with his trike."
