Born Justin Cole Moore, the singer/songwriter began life in small town America, working on his family’s farm, singing gospel songs in Church and performing in his junior year of high school, where he won a talent show at just eight years old. After which he joined his uncle’s Southern rock band and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, U.S., back in 2002. He then met a gentleman named Scott Borchetta, a music executive, who was creating the record label Valory Music Group and said he would like to sign Moore if he could be patient.

Sure enough in 2008 Justin Moore signed to the Valory Music Group which represented an epoch in his music career, with his first radio single “Back That Thing Up” reaching number 38 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. For Moore’s first full-length he left it up to fans to decide on which songs should be on the album by allowing them to make a playlist of his songs, with the top ten most picked making it to the album. By this point Moore has brought together an impressive group of musicians which led to a series of opening support slots on tours by Luke Bryan, Trace Adkins, ZZ Top and Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Moore has charted in the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart a total of eight times, four of which he topped with his songs “Small Town USA”, “If Heaven Wasn’t So Far Away”, “Til My Last Day” and “Lettin’ the Night Roll”. On top of this Moore’s two most recent albums “Outlaws Like Me” and “Off the Beaten Path” have both topped the Billboard Country Album charts. Steve Leggett of Allmusic puts this down to Moore having a ‘ready made imagine’ that’s not hard to publicise and his ability to write his own music is another string to his bow.

In 2014 Justin Moore won the award for New Artist of the Year at the Academy of Country Music Awards.
