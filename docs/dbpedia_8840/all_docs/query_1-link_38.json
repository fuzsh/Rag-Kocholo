        "meta_description": "Country chart-topping powerhouse Justin Moore proves that, through all the fame and success, he’s still just the same country boy he’s always been on his stellar new album, Late Nights and Longnecks. Moore’s songs have racked up more than a billion on-demand and programmed streams, and he performed everywhere from Kimmel to The Today Show in addition to headlining arenas and amphitheaters around the country.\nAn Arkansas native who grew up idolizing Dwight Yoakam and Keith Whitley, Moore knows a thing or two about hit records himself. After signing to The Valory Music Co., an imprint of the Big Machine Label Group, he landed his first country #1 with “Small Town USA,” the breakout single off his 2009 self-titled debut. The record went platinum, as did its 2011 follow-up, ‘Outlaws Like Me,’ which yielded yet another #1 single with “If Heaven Wasn’t So Far Away.” Rolling Stone praised the “upbeat mix of contemporary country and honest twang that he perfected,” and in 2014, Moore landed the coveted New Artist of the Year trophy at the ACM Awards.",
