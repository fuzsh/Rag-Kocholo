        "text": "NASHVILLE, TN (August 12, 2016) – Justin Moore claimed the #1 Top Country Albums spot and #2 All-Genre position on the iTunes charts with KINDA DON’T CARE before hitting the stage today for a packed crowd at the Fox & Friends’ All-American Summer Concert Series live from New York City. Moore rocked the national television debut of his current Top 10 single “You Look Like I Need a Drink” from his fourth studio album on The Valory Music Co., available now, proving he is “one of country’s best live acts” (Whiskey Riff). He also offered up past chart-toppers such as “Point at You,” “Lettin’ the Night Roll” and “If Heaven Wasn’t So Far Away.” Watch the interview here: http://video.foxnews.com/v/5080870435001.\n\n“I’m stoked about it!” exclaimed Moore this morning on Fox & Friends when asked about KINDA DON’T CARE. “I think it is the best album we’ve delivered. The most diverse album we’ve delivered and I’m proud of it…I’m excited to get some new music out there for these folks.”\n\nIt has been three years since the Platinum-selling star has released a new album, and it was definitely worth the wait. As “his star continues to rise…” (USA Today), Moore is busier than ever with continued sold-out performances across the country and previewing the fresh tracks with fans. KINDA DON’T CARE, featuring a 16-track deluxe edition, is the follow-up to back-to-back albums OUTLAWS LIKE ME (2011) and OFF THE BEATEN PATH (2013), which debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart."
