        "text": "PHILADELPHIA - Drexel's Justin Moore has been named the Philadelphia Big 5 Co-Player of the Week. The Philadelphia native led the Dragons to three straight CAA wins and became the first Drexel player to win the award.\n\nMoore, a point guard from Archbishop Wood High School, scored 22 points to lead the Dragons to a convincing win at William & Mary. The sophomore was 9-for-15 from the floor and made four of his six 3-point attempts. Earlier in the week, Moore had 11 points, seven rebounds and seven assists as the Dragons defeated UNCW, 78-63. On New Year's Day, Moore scored 10 points in a victory and handed out five assists against Hampton. For the week, Moore averaged 14.3 points, five rebounds and five assists in the three games. He also shot 50 percent from behind the arc (6-for-12) and had five steals. Moore shared the award this week with Jhamir Brickus of La Salle.\n\nThe Dragons are now 3-0 in CAA play for the first time since the 2006-07 season. They are 10-6 overall and have won five of their last six games. The Dragons are back in action on Thursday night, when they visit Elon."
