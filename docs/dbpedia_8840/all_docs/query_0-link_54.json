        "text": "Dr. Moore serves as an Associate Professor within the Center for Health Equity Transformation (CHET) at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine, with roles as Assistant Director of Population Science within the Department of Internal Medicine, and Assistant Director of Community Impact at the Markey Cancer Center. Dr. Moore is an epidemiologist with vast skills in biostatistics, database design, geographic information systems (GIS), mediation analysis, Bayesian methods, and cancer prevention and control. Dr. Moore’s research explores the intersection between social identity (race and/or sexual orientation and gender identity), place, and gene interactions on cancer health outcomes. Dr. Moore’s work delineated that place matters for African American, Hispanic, and rural populations characterized by hot spots of excess mortality from breast cancer, lung cancer, early-onset colorectal cancer, sepsis, and COVID-19.\n\nResearch Interest\n\nDr. Moore’s current research interests lie in understanding the effects of race and place on determinants of breast cancer including breast cancer screening, mammographic density, life-course stress, and DNA methylation. Dr. Moore has published over 80 peer-reviewed, 30+ of these articles feature Dr. Moore as the lead or corresponding author. Dr. Moore publishes in journals such as JAMA, Cancer Epidemiology, Critical Care, The Journal of Clinical and Translational Sciences, and many others. In 2022, Dr. Moore won the American Association for Cancer Research, Minority in Cancer Research Faculty Award in recognition of his work and service.\n\nCurrent Research\n\nRacial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Cancer Outcomes: Dr. Moore has focused on examining health disparities (including racial, socio-economic, rural, and geographic) in cancer outcomes within the United States. Racial minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations often face substantial barriers to adequate healthcare, greatly affecting quality of life and mortality. We have examined the influence of personal and neighborhood level, socioeconomic factors, and availability to healthcare resources in relation to racial differences in survival and treatment of various cancers (including breast and colorectal)."
