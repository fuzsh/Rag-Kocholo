        "text": "TULSA, Oklahoma -- University of Tulsa President Brad R. Carson announced Tuesday that Justin Moore, who most recently served as the executive deputy athletics director and chief operating officer of Texas A&M Athletics, has been named vice president and director of athletics for the Golden Hurricane following a national search.\n\nMoore will begin his duties at TU on July 8. “I am excited to join The University of Tulsa,” Moore said.\n\n“The Golden Hurricane has a rich athletics history with competitive teams and bright student-athletes, and I believe in the direction of the university under President Carson’s leadership.\n\nI am eager to build relationships with so many great people – the coaching and administrative staffs, donors and fans, student-athletes and alumni and the Tulsa community – and get to work advancing this amazing program.”\n\nMoore takes over the AD post left by TU alumnus Rick Dickson, who is retiring after leading athletics departments at Tulsa, Washington State and Tulane.\n\n“Building upon the foundation that Rick Dickson has laid, Justin Moore is the right person to take The University of Tulsa into the next generation of college sports,” Carson said.\n\n“Justin is extremely well respected among his peers. ADs from Ohio State and LSU personally reached out to affirm that he is one of the most talented administrators in college sports today.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, faculty from Texas A&M praised Moore for his work with student-athletes.”\n\nThe University of Tulsa is a member of The American Athletic Conference and sponsors 17 sports, including 10 women’s and seven men’s teams.\n\nTU is the smallest NCAA Division I FBS school. At Texas A&M, Moore directed the overall planning, implementation, administration and day-to-day operations of the athletics department. He also served as the sport administrator for football and men’s basketball.\n\nPrior to his recent tenure with the Aggies, Moore served as director of football operations and assistant athletics director with the University of Houston, which was his first exposure to The University of Tulsa as the two were in the same conference at that time.\n\n“I first came to admire The University of Tulsa when we played during my time with Houston,” reflected Moore. “There is truly something special in Tulsa, and I look forward to amplifying Rick Dickson’s success in the coming years.”\n\nMoore began his tenure with the Aggies in 2012. During that time, he oversaw student-athlete performance and wellness, facilities and event management, fundraising, facility planning and capital projects, academics and life skills, compliance, budgeting, team operations and logistics and scheduling.\n\nHe also organized a leadership development program for coaches, staff and student-athletes. As the Aggies’ associate athletics director for football, Moore was involved with personnel and staffing, budget, recruiting, team logistics, bowl game coordination and football-related facility projects, including the design process for an $8 million player development center, $12 million nutrition center, $21 million Bright Football Complex renovation and $485 million Kyle Field redevelopment project.\n\nFrom 2012-15, Texas A&M football won 36 games, earned a bowl berth every season (with three bowl victories) and produced eight first-team All-Americans, as well as the first freshman Heisman Trophy winner in college football history.\n\nThe team’s multi-year Academic Progress Rate and overall team grade-point average were the highest in program history.\n\nMoore graduated from Texas A&M in 2004 with a bachelor’s degree in finance and earned a master’s degree in sport management in 2007. He worked in the private sector as a consultant for Deloitte & Touche LLP, consulting with top-level executives of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nA two-time captain for the Aggie baseball team, Moore was named a Freshman All-American pitcher in 2001, was twice named to the All-Big 12 Team and was a two-time recipient of the Pat Olsen Most Valuable Pitcher Award.\n\nHe also earned Academic All-Big 12 Team honors for four years.\n\nMoore and his wife, Dory, have three children, Kate (15), Tysen (13), and Tatum (11)."
