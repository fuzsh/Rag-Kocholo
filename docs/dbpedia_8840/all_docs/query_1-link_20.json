        "text": "The reasons why I love Justin Moore just keep piling on. He is a man that keeps it country. I feel confident saying you will never hear a Justin Moore songs on our sister station Kiss 95.1. He lives on part of his Granddad’s farm along with other extended family members and just found out we love the same television show.\n\nJustin used to watch Westerns with his grandfather while growing up. He reportedly says he is a huge fan of Yellowstone\n\n. We share the same character on the show too. We both love Beth.\n\nDon’t you wish ladies you were as smart, beautiful and sassy as John Dutton’s only daughter. At least I do. Lets take a look at some of Beth’s best moments. WARNING: STRONG AND I MEAN STRONG LANGUAGE\n\nCatherine Lane is the morning show co-host and midday host on Country 1037 in Charlotte, North Carolina.
