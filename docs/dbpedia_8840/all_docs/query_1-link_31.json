        "text": "Whiskey Riff apparently spent four days in Ohio for The Country Fest, and they learned a couple of things. For starters, they love country music there. Even more importantly than that, they love their country in general.\n\nAmerican flags were there in full force and red, white and blue outfits were the appropriate choice of clothing attire for the festival attendees. USA chants were a regular occurrence throughout the weekend. Which is not surprising.\n\nJustin Moore was asked to play the festival and in case you have no idea…the man truly loves his country just as much as the fine people who showed up to get their Country Fest on. So, Justin went ahead and took a minute to pay tribute to America along with the rowdy, patriotic fans.\n\nJustin was about to get into his song, “The Ones That Didn’t Make It Back Home”, which is his 2019 tribute to all of our fallen American heroes, the crowd broke out into a USA chant that caught his attention enough that he decided to stop the show for the National Anthem."
