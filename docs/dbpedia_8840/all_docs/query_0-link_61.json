        "text": "Arkansas native JUSTIN MOORE spent three years putting together his fourth studio album, KINDA DON’T CARE. The project is chock-full of new music and earned the singer his third consecutive No. 1 album debut. The platinum-selling entertainer kickstarted the album with his sixth chart-topping single “You Look Like I Need A Drink” and follow-up single “Somebody Else Will.” With 16 tracks on the deluxe version, KINDA DON’T CARE provides a stellar set list for Moore’s live shows which also feature No. 1 hits like “Point At You” and “Lettin’ The Night Roll.” The Valory Music Co. recording artist has earned multiple ACM, ACA and ACC Awards nominations tallied millions of track sales as well as placed seven singles in the Top 10 at Country radio. His previous album, OFF THE BEATEN PATH, also scored a No. 1 album release. A known road warrior, Moore has shared the stage with Hank Williams Jr., Brad Paisley, Miranda Lambert and Brantley Gilbert and will be joined by the Turnpike Troubadours at Inn of the Mountain Gods.\n\nThe Turnpike Troubadours are an Americana/Country group from Oklahoma making their way across the country with their sound, deep-rooted in soul that’s impossible to resist. Known for rockin’ hard, lashed by burnin’ fiddle and guitar, you’ll witness one of the best shows you’ll ever see. Buy tickets."
