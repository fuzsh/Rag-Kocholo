        "text": "Meet Dr. Justin Moore\n\nChiropractic Care Changed My Life\n\nHi, my name is Dr. Justin Moore. I’ve been a chiropractor at Calallen Chiropractic for the last six years and in practice for nearly 10. My profession and patients are very dear to me\n\nYou see, chiropractic changed my life when I was a child. I started getting migraine headaches when I was about 12. For several years I suffered with these headaches throughout my teenage years with no relief or answers from several different doctors throughout that time. I was missing up to 30 days of school a year! Finally, when I was a senior in high school, a co-worker of my mother’s recommended that I go to a chiropractor for my headaches. Well, by that point I had given up hope, that any kind of doctor, drug or remedy could help me (since it seemed like I had tried them all already).\n\nI mean, if my family doctor, neurologists, pain specialists weren’t able to help me over the course of 5 years, how could a chiropractor? Luckily for me, my mother hadn’t given up hope that there was something that could help and dragged me in to see Dr. Evans. During the consultation asked me if I slept on my stomach or if I had any kind of neck injuries among many other questions, which at the time didn’t seem to have anything to do with my headaches.\n\nAs it turns out, they had EVERYTHING to do with my headaches. Dr. Evans explained to me that the alignment of the spine can affect the health of the nerves and the nervous system, which in turn can affect the health of the rest of the body. My headaches were due in part to dysfunction in my neck. After five years, I finally got some relief, and more important, answers! And that is the short version of the story of why I’m a chiropractor, and why I love what I do.\n\nDr. Justin Moore | (361) 767-3300"
