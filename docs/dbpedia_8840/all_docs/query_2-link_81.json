        "text": "Multi-PLATINUM hitmaker Justin Moore has built a loyal following over the past decade with his traditional Country sound and captivating live shows. Currently climbing through the Top 40 at Country radio, his latest single, \"You, Me, and Whiskey,\" the smoldering duet with Priscilla Block follows in the footsteps of his 11th No. 1 hit, \"With A Woman You Love,\" which served as the first offering from his new album, Stray Dog, out now. He reached double-digit chart success with his 10th No. 1, \"We Didn't Have Much,\" which is featured on his eight-track collection of tunes, Straight Outta The Country, after the Arkansas native's extensive fanbase helped boost his fifth studio album, Late Nights and Longnecks, to the top of the charts upon its release. Lead track \"The Ones That Didn't Make It Back Home,\" and follow up \"Why We Drink\" both peaked at No. 1 on both Mediabase and Billboard. Moore's previous project, Kinda Don't Care, earned the singer his third consecutive No. 1 album debut and features his chart-topping singles \"You Look Like I Need A Drink\" and \"Somebody Else Will.\" It served as a follow up to his second No. 1 album release, the GOLD-certified Off The Beaten Path. Over his 10+ year career, Moore's No. 1 hits have also included \"Point at You,\" \"Lettin' The Night Roll\" \"If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away,\" \"Small Town USA\" and \"Till My Last Day\" as well as PLATINUM-certified albums Justin Moore and Outlaws Like Me.\n\nThe Valory Music Co. recording artist has earned multiple ACM, ACA and ACC Awards nominations as well as an ACM Award win. He has shared the stage with Hank Williams Jr., Brad Paisley, Miranda Lambert, routinely traversing coast-to-coast on headline runs and hitting the road this spring to headline his You, Me, and Whiskey Tour. Adding to his already impressive career, Moore has also been busy hosting his Justin Moore Podcast sponsored by Bobcat with tour manager JR and interviewing guests such as Oscar award-winning actor Matthew McConaughey; Country stars Tracy Lawrence, Jon Pardi, Brantley Gilbert; wrestling champion Diamond Dallas Page and ESPN's Marty Smith. He also recently took on a new role as co-host on 103.7 The Buzz's morning drive-time sports talk show, \"Morning Mayhem,\" where he spends his weekday mornings dishing out his never-ending sports knowledge on-air.\n\nTyler Kinch\n\nTyler Kinch has captivated hearts and moved audiences with his soulful country melodies and heartfelt lyrics.
