        "text": "Two of country music’s heavy hitters will usher in 2017 with a co-headlining tour: Lee Brice and Justin Moore kick off their American Made trek on January 12th in Indianapolis. The tour will hit nearly two dozen cities.\n\nBrice, who was the only country artist to perform in all 50 states during 2015, spent the early part of this year on the headlining Life Off My Years Tour with Tyler Farr, while Moore is currently wrapping up dates on Brantley Gilbert’s Take It Outside run. This will mark his third tour as a headliner.\n\nNewcomer William Michael Morgan, who has a Top Five hit with “I Met a Girl,” will join Brice and Moore on the majority of dates, while Brett Young, whose debut single “Sleep Without You” is nearing the Top Ten, will open the last two dates on the current itinerary. Both acts released their debut EPs this year, with Morgan’s LP, Vinyl, due September 30th.\n\n“It’s very exciting to get back out there as a headliner,” says Moore, whose fourth LP, Kinda Don’t Care, released in August, was the singer’s third to bow at Number One. “To be able to do it with my buddy Lee is even more exciting. I’ve been a fan of his for a long time. It’s gonna definitely be a party every night.”\n\n“When we put this tour together we thought about the fans first,” adds the Grammy-nominated Brice. “I love playing live but what’s even more fun is interacting with the amazing people in the audience. That’s what it’s all about.”\n\nBrice says his fans can expect to hear the hits, including “I Drive Your Truck” and “I Don’t Dance,” as well as some of the material he’s currently working on for his next album.\n\nHere are the dates of Brice and Moore’s American Made Tour:\n\nJanuary 12 – Indianapolis, IN @ Bankers Life Fieldhouse\n\nJanuary 13 – La Crosse, WI @ La Crosse Center\n\nJanuary 14 – Rosemont, IL @ Rosemont Theatre\n\nJanuary 19 – Corbin, KY @ The Arena\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nJanuary 26 – Jacksonville, FL @ Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena\n\nJanuary 27 – Fayetteville, NC @ Crown Coliseum\n\nJanuary 28 – Macon, GA @ Macon Centreplex Coliseum\n\nFebruary 2 – Pittsburgh, PA @ Peterson Events Center- U. of Pittsburgh\n\nFebruary 3 – Fairfax, VA @ EagleBank Arena\n\nFebruary 4 – Greensboro, NC @ Greensboro Coliseum Complex\n\nFebruary 9 – Canton, OH @ Canton Memorial Civic Center\n\nFebruary 10 – Highland Heights, KY @ BB&T Arena\n\nFebruary 11 – Bloomington, IL @ US Cellular Coliseum\n\nFebruary 23 – Murray, KY @ CFSB Center\n\nFebruary 25 – Milwaukee, WI @ The Milwaukee Theater\n\nMarch 2 – Independence, MO @ Silverstein Eye Centers Arena\n\nMarch 3 – Saint Louis, MO @ Chaifetz Arena\n\nMarch 16 – Des Moines, IA @ Iowa Events Center\n\nMarch 17 – Salina, KS @ Bicentennial Center\n\nMarch 18 – Loveland, CO @ Budweiser Events Center\n\nMarch 23 – Huntsville, AL @ Von Braun Center (with Brett Young)*\n\nMarch 24 – Jackson, MS @ Mississippi Coliseum (with Brett Young)*\n\nTrending\n\nAll dates featuring William Michael Morgan, except as noted*"
