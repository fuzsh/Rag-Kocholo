I also conduct epidemiological research examining the behavioral determinants of obesity, cardiometabolic health and related comorbidities. I am especially passionate about eliminating health disparities so everyone can live a healthy and fulfilling life regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, or geography. I am actively engaged in global health research, and I regularly serve as a visiting scholar at Wuhan University in Wuhan, Hubei, China. I have been fortunate to receive funding for my research from the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the de Beaumont Foundation, among others.\n\nResearch Lab\n\nMoore Lab - Bridging implementation science and epidemiology research.\n\nEducation Program Involvement\n\nIntegrative Physiology and Pharmacology PhD"
