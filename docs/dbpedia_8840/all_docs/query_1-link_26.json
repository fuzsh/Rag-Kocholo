        "text": "Multi-PLATINUM hitmaker Justin Moore has built a loyal following over the past decade with his traditional country sound and captivating live shows. The Arkansas native just notched his twelfth No. 1 with “You, Me, and Whiskey,” a smoldering duet with Priscilla Block. Over his decade-plus year career, Moore’s No. 1 hits have included “Point at You,” “Lettin’ The Night Roll,” “If Heaven Wasn’t So Far Away,” “Small Town USA,” and “Till My Last Day,” as well as various PLATINUM-certified albums and singles. The Valory Music Co. recording artist has earned multiple ACM, ACA, People’s Choice, and ACC Awards nominations, as well as an ACM Award win.\n\nIn addition to multiple festivals, headline shows and select direct-support dates, Moore has also been busy hosting his Justin Moore Podcast sponsored by Bobcat with tour manager JR, interviewing guests such as OSCAR® award-winning actor Matthew McConaughey; country stars Tracy Lawrence, Jon Pardi, Brantley Gilbert; wrestling champion Diamond Dallas Page; and ESPN’s Marty Smith. He also recently took on a new role as co-host on 103.7 The Buzz's morning drive-time sports talk show, Morning Mayhem, where he spends his weekday mornings dishing out his never-ending sports knowledge on-air.\n\nABOUT TENILLE ARTS:\n\nCanadian-born Tenille Arts’ dream of performing took root at the age of eight. After years of touring across Canada, Arts landed in Nashville where she earned a publishing deal. Her 2016 self-titled debut EP peaked at #1 on the iTunes Canada Top Country Album Chart and cracked the Top 100 on the U.S. iTunes Country Album Chart.\n\nTenille released her full-length album Rebel Child in October 2017, followed by Love, Heartbreak, & Everything in Between, which yielded the #1 hit “Somebody Like That.” The single is certified platinum in the U.S. and made history as the first #1 Country single written, produced and performed by an all-female cast. Tenille wrote the song with Allison Cruz and Alex Kline, and Kline produced the track.\n\nTenille was inducted into the prestigious CMT Next Women of Country Class of 2021 and named one of the five 2021 CRS New Faces of Country Music. She was nominated for the ACM New Female Artist of the Year, iHeart Radio Music Awards Best New Country Artist. Her “Back Then, Right Now” single led to CMT Music Awards nominations for Female Video of the Year and Breakthrough Video of the Year.\n\nShe then released the full-length album Girl To Girl in 2021. She then signed with new label Dreamcatcher Artists in September of 2022, and the company’s first release in January of 2023 was the stunning “Jealous of Myself.” Superstar singer LeAnn Rimes caught wind of the song and joined Tenille on a duet version.\n\nShe has opened for Luke Combs, Lady A, Scotty McCreery, Lee Brice and Jordan Davis."
