        "text": "Justin Moore serves as the Executive Deputy Athletics Director and Chief Operating Officer of Texas A&M Athletics. Moore works alongside the Director of Athletics in directing the overall planning, implementation, administration, and day-to-day operations of the athletics department.\n\nHe will play an integral role in the department’s upcoming capital projects and Centennial Capital Campaign and will continue to serve as the sport administrator for football and men’s basketball.\n\nHis previous administrative roles at Texas A&M include serving as Deputy Athletics Director for Administration from 2019-2021, Senior Associate Athletics Director from 2016-2019 and Associate Athletics Director for Football from 2012-15. During his tenure with the Aggies, Moore has touched nearly every area of the department, including student-athlete performance and wellness, facilities and event management, fundraising, facility planning and capital projects, academics and life skills, compliance, budgeting, team operations and logistics, and scheduling. He also spearheaded an extensive leadership development program for the athletics department that offers specific courses and continuing education opportunities for coaches, staff and student-athletes. In addition, he has served as the sport administrator for many of the Aggies’ key sports including football, men’s basketball, men’s and women’s track and field / cross country, men’s golf, and women’s tennis.\n\nIn Moore’s role as the Aggies’ Associate Athletics Director for Football, he oversaw every aspect of the Aggie football program including personnel and staffing, departmental budget, recruiting, team logistics, bowl game coordination, day-to-day operations and football-related facility projects, including the design process for the Davis Player Development Center, the R.C. Slocum Nutrition Center and Bright Football Complex Renovation, and worked closely with the 12th Man Foundation on the $485 million Kyle Field Redevelopment project.\n\nMoore’s involvement with the football team coincided with one of the most successful periods in the program’s history. From 2012-15, the Aggies won 36 games, earned a bowl berth every season (with three bowl victories) and produced eight first-team All-Americans, as well as the first freshman Heisman Trophy winner in college football history and the school’s first Outland Trophy recipient.\n\nIn addition to the Aggies’ on-field success, the team’s multi-year Academic Progress Rate (APR) and overall team grade point average were both the highest in program history and football student-athletes earned close to 100 SEC Academic Honor Roll citations.\n\nA Texas A&M graduate, Moore returned to Aggieland after spending four years at the University of Houston as the Assistant Athletics Director for Football. The Cougars won the most games in any four-year period in school history and earned a pair of Conference USA West Division titles during his time at UH.\n\nPrior to Houston, Moore spent two years as the special assistant to the athletics director at Texas A&M, when he coordinated and led the NCAA certification process, assisted with football scheduling and coordinated all student financial aid. He also scheduled and supervised all activities associated with player agent interviews, NFL pro-day and educational seminars and activities for student-athletes and their parents.\n\nMoore graduated from Texas A&M in 2004 with a degree in finance and later earned a master’s degree in sport management. After graduation, he worked in the private sector as a consultant for Deloitte & Touche LLP, consulting with top-level executives of Fortune 500 companies on both their business cycles and information technology processes.\n\nA two-time captain for the Aggie baseball team, Moore was named a Freshman All-American pitcher in 2001, twice named to the All-Big 12 Team and was a two-time recipient of the Pat Olsen Most Valuable Pitcher Award (2001-2002). He also earned Academic All-Big 12 Team honors for four straight years.\n\nA three-sport standout in high school, Moore graduated from Katy Taylor in 1999 and was inducted into the Katy Taylor Athletics Hall of Fame (2012). Moore and his wife, Dory (A&M Class of 2003), have three children, Kate (13), Tysen (11), and Tatum (9)."
