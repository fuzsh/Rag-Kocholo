The project is chock-full of new music and earned the singer his third consecutive No. 1 album debut. The platinum-selling entertainer kickstarted the album with his sixth chart-topping single “You Look Like I Need A Drink” and follow-up single “Somebody Else Will.” A known road warrior, Moore has shared the stage stage with Hank Williams Jr., Brad Paisley, Miranda Lambert and Brantley Gilbert and is currently on his headlining AMERICAN MADE TOUR with Lee Brice."
