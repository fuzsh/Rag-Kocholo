        "text": "Justin Moore is no stranger to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and each time he goes and spends time with young patients, he keeps the thoughts of his own three daughters in the back of his mind.\n\n\"I met a 4-year-old little girl that was wearing the same princess dress that my girls always have on, and a cowboy hat and boots, so I was drawn to her because I have daughters, a 4-year-old in particular,\" Moore notes to Taste of Country. \"It’s just unreal to think about. You always draw comparisons to your own personal life whether it’s a positive or negative, or if you’re in a place like this, it doesn’t matter. It becomes a little more personal to you.\"\n\nThe country singer is in awe of everything the hospital does for patients that extends beyond medical care. He makes connections of the emotional and mental ailments that the patients and their family members are enduring that go beyond the medical terminology.\n\nSt. Jude fills in all of the blanks by making the hospital a place for its visitors to find joy and hope down to the smallest details, like through the kid-friendly walls and themed rooms that make the atmosphere not such a scary place.\n\nAll of these aspects impress Moore.\n\n\"You think about the patient and what they’re dealing with physically which is you know, ridiculous to think about. But you forget, and me being a parent if this happened to my child, I know I’d just be a wreck,\" the singer says. \"It’s pretty impressive to me what they do outside of the medical part, helping families cope and all that.\"\n\nMoore encourages all of his fans to support the worthy cause that is St. Jude and hopes that those having to deal with all of this can possibly find some sense of relief from his 2011 single \"If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away.\"\n\n\"This could be me in this situation tomorrow, I can be here not doing this, I could be that family,\" he acknowledges. \"So I would encourage anyone out there who has a little bit that they have designated to help something annually, there’s a lot of great things out there to donate to, and I’ve dealt with a lot of them and this one is second to none and to me children are the most important thing on this earth. Not only my children, but all children.\"\n\n\"The good thing about 'If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away' is after you shed a tear or two I usually hear stories behind how it encouraged people and how it has put a smile on people’s faces before and after losing their family members,\" he furthers.\n\nMoore is gearing up to join Brantley Gilbert this summer on the Take it Outside Tour where he will promote his current single, \"You Look Like I Need a Drink.\"\n\nOn March 3 and 4, Taste of Country will join 15 Townsquare Media stations in support of the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. This two-day web and radiothon aims to raise money and awareness for the world class research and treatment facility in Memphis, Tenn. Now in its third year, this collaborative effort has raised nearly $2.5 million. Country radio has helped raise more than $550 million during 26 years worth of Country Cares radiothons. The mission is simple: raise money, save lives.\n\nStars Talk About the St. Jude Patients They'll Never Forget"
