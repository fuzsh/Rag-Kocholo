        "text": "Platinum-selling recording artist and American Country Music award winner Justin Moore’s single “You Look I Need a Drink” became Moore’s fifth number one country single for the week of October 8th, 2016.\n\nJustin talks to Chilled about his new song and how it relates to his drinks of choice.\n\nTell us about your song.\n\n“You Look Like I Need a Drink” was the first single from my album, Kinda Don’t Care. This song talks about a feeling that a lot of people know too well. It’s a scenario where the girl is coming over and you know she is going to break up with you just by the look on her face. It’s one of those cases where you immediately need a drink to take off the edge of what’s about to happen.\n\nIt’s been a while since we’ve put an album out, and I am really proud of it. I believe this is the best piece of music we’ve delivered because we had so much fun making it. The album title, Kinda Don’t Care, is meant to challenge people to live life a little more care free and be true to themselves.\n\nThe video for “You Look Like I Need A Drink” is probably my favorite one I’ve ever shot. It’s a Western-style video where I show up at a saloon looking for a wanted lady, get into some trouble and have a few drinks while I’m at it. I’m a huge Western fan, so shooting this was like a dream come true for me.\n\nWith your busy schedule, what do you like to do with your downtime?\n\nWell, usually, even my downtime is crazy. I have three daughters who are full on into softball, basketball, etc. Between coaching them and taking them to things, hanging out, etc., we don’t get much downtime. If I do get any time alone, it’s on the golf course, hunting, or fishing. I have a passion for all three.\n\nWhen you go out to eat where do you like to dine?\n\nMy wife and I are both food people. We love finding local places around home. There are a ton of great, locally owned, spots in Little Rock. I would say our favorite is Mexican, anywhere or any time.\n\nWhat types of dishes do you usually order?\n\nIt depends on where we are. I’m the guy who goes to my favorite spot with the intention of trying something new every time, yet I always get the same thing. Most of the time that’s a filet for me.\n\nDo you cook?\n\nI love to cook, and I’m pretty good at it. I enjoy the fact that it’s another creative outlet for me. My daughters are interested in cooking as well so it’s something we can enjoy together.\n\nWhat types of drinks do you order when out?\n\nTypically, my go-to drink is Crown XR, or Kettle One and soda with extra lime. I also love beer. My favorite is Guinness.\n\nDo you prepare drinks at home?\n\nI don’t drink a lot when I’m home. I’m usually changing diapers, or riding a tractor. When I do, my wife and I enjoy good wine. We are Cabernet people. One of my favorite gifts from her was a membership to a Wine of the Month club. We got to try some great stuff that we buy to this day.\n\nDo you own a home bar?\n\nWell, we are in a transition period at home right now. We are a few months away from moving into our “forever” home. We have never had a bar. However, I told my wife with this house, “You can make every decision on the house, as long as I get a bar.” That said, we built about a 2,000 square-foot pool house with a bar inside of it. The bar is 12 feet long, made from an old tree on our property. We have a boys bathroom, girls bathroom, multiple flat screens, taps, guy stuff everywhere, etc.\n\nWhat will it be stocked with?\n\nOur bar will be stocked with everything. I think we have four taps, and every other bottle known to man. It’s set up in such a way that we can hire a bartender for the parties we throw and they will have everything they would need at work.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of J. Meyers\n\nHave you ever been a bartender?\n\nNever been a bartender. I’ve always enjoyed the other side of the bar too much."
