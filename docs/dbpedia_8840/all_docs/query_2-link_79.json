        "text": "After spending four days in Ohio for The Country Fest, I learned a couple things: One, they love their country music. But even more than that, they love their country.\n\nThere were no shortage of American flags and red, white and blue outfits all throughout the crowd and the campgrounds, and USA chants were a regular occurrence throughout the weekend.\n\nAnd Justin Moore loves his country just as much as those folks in the crowd, so why not take a minute to pay tribute to America along with the rowdy, patriotic bunch of fans?\n\nAs Justin was getting ready to play “The Ones That Didn’t Make It Back Home,” his 2019 tribute to all of our fallen American heroes, the crowd broke out into a powerful USA chant that caught his attention – enough that he decided to stop the show:\n\n“We don’t do this often, but sometimes when it’s that strong we decide to do this right here, and I think it’s the only thing that we could do that’s anything close to appropriate.”\n\nHe then took off his cowboy hat and invited the crowd to join him as he performed an a capella version of the Star Spangled Banner…and of course the fans were all too happy to oblige:\n\n@whiskeyriff Justin Moore stopped the show after a USA chant and sang the National Anthem. // whiskeyriff.com @Justin Moore #whiskeyriff #justinmoore ♬ original sound – Whiskey Riff\n\nIt was a moment that gives you chills, even on a hot day like it was in Ohio.\n\nOh, and it also happened to be Flag Day, and the birthday of the United States Army – so what better time to pay tribute to the greatest country in the history of the world?"
