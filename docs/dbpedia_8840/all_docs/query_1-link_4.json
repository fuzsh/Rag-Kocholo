        "text": "Justin Moore is seeking to connect with others in a unique way.\n\nThe Arkansas-born singer-songwriter’s most recent single, “This Is My Dirt,” is a song about embracing “how you grew up, and more specifically, where you grew up. The land I live on today and where I raise my children, is the same land that I grew up on. It has been in our family since the late 1800s.\n\n“My great, great grandfather raised my grandfather here,” he continued when he released the song in late 2023. “My grandpa inherited the land from him, and then I inherited it from my grandpa. So, it's really special to us, for obvious reasons. But no matter where you grew up, I think everybody holds a special place in their heart for that place — whether it's a subdivision or thousands of acres, whatever the case may be. This song is about taking pride in wherever it is that you call 'your dirt.’”\n\nThat’s exactly what Moore wants to know about his fans.\n\nThe country star said “whether it’s a high-rise condo in the heart of NYC or a generational family farm in the middle of nowhere, I want to see what makes your dirt, YOUR DIRT, for my new video.” Participants can submit photos to potentially appear in Moore’s forthcoming music video.\n\nMoore wrote “This Is My Dirt” with Paul DiGiovanni, Randy Montana and Jeremy Stover. It adds to a growing lost of Moore’s career-spanning hits, including “You, Me, And Whiskey,” “Somebody Else Will,” “We Didn’t Have Much,” “Small Town USA,” “Lettin’ The Night Roll” and many others. Listen to “This Is My Dirt” again below."
