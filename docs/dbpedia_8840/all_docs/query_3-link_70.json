        "text": "Six-time NCAA champion and U.S. junior national team coach, Justin Moore has returned Syracuse women's rowing to national prominence since being named head coach in July 2010. One of the most respected coaches in the rowing community, Moore possesses an impressive résumé from both as an athlete and coach on the collegiate and professional levels.\n\nIn his eight seasons leading the program, the Orange boast an impressive résumé, which includes seven top-three conference championship finishes, three trips to the NCAA Championship, 22 all-conference selections, 10 all-region honorees, and five All-Americans. Syracuse has appeared in the top 20 of each of the past five final USRowing/Collegiate Rowing Coaches Association (CRCA) Collegiate Rowing Polls, as well.\n\nMoore earned 2017 Atlantic Coast Conference Coach of the Year honors following the annual league championship in Clemson, S.C. The second varsity eight crew went on to win a conference title and was named the ACC Crew of the Year. Behind 11th-place showings from the second varsity eight and first varsity four boats, the team finished in 13th place at the 2017 NCAA Championship in West Windsor, N.J.\n\nThe Orange earned an at-large invitation to the 2016 NCAA Championship, earning their first trip to the national championship regatta since 2005. Syracuse outperformed its seeding in two of the three events and finished 13th overall in Gold River, Calif. The first varsity eight crew finished in 12th place, the team’s top showing at the event.\n\nIn 2015, the team finished the year ranked No. 18 in the final coaches’ poll, its highest final ranking since the conclusion of the 2005 campaign. The Orange finished third at the ACC Championship for the second straight season and retained the Orange Challenge Cup for the third consecutive year.\n\nSyracuse finished in third place at its first ACC Championship in 2014, behind No. 5 Virginia and No. 9 Notre Dame. The Orange won cup races at the Orange Challenge Cup and Kittell Cup, going 2-of-3 in cup races for the second straight season.\n\nIn 2013, Moore led the team to three silver medals and two bronze medals and a third-place finish at the BIG EAST Championship, en route to a No. 19 national ranking, the program's highest in eight years. 2012 Olympic Silver Medalist Natalie Mastracci was named First-Team All-American and First-Team All-Mid-Atlantic Region.\n\nSyracuse finished second overall at the 2012 BIG EAST Championship, finishing in the top two in every points event. The varsity four became SU's first varsity boat to win a BIG EAST Championship since 2005. Those achievements were recognized in the season's final coaches’ poll, as the Orange were ranked No. 20, its first national ranking in seven years.\n\nIn his first year at Syracuse in 2011, Moore guided the Orange to a fourth-place finish at the BIG EAST Rowing Championship and mentored three all-conference performers, Emma Karpowicz, Chelsea Macpherson, and Allison Todd.\n\nTHE INTERNATIONAL STAGE\n\nMoore has been deeply involved on the international rowing scene throughout his coaching career, with USRowing utilizing his expertise and experience in various roles in recent years to develop some of its top talent.\n\nMoore continued his involvement in USRowing in the summer of 2012, hosting the U23 Women's National Team Training Camp at Syracuse and helping lead the U.S. to a gold medal at the U23 World Championships in Trakai, Lithuania. The camp returned to Syracuse in the summer of 2013 with Moore once again coaching the prospective national team members of the future.\n\nMoore previously ran the US Women's Pre-Elite Camp in 2011, his first year at Syracuse. The program is designed as the development program that feeds the US U23 team. He has been invited back to coach at the Pre-Elite Camp again in 2013, with an emphasis on sculling development with the goal of producing more sculling medals in the 2016 Olympics and beyond.\n\nIn the fall of 2008, Moore was named the Women’s Junior National Team coach by US Rowing. The following year, Moore guided the U.S. Junior Women’s Team 8+ to the gold medal at the World Rowing Junior Championship. The win secured the U.S. a ticket to the 2010 Junior World Games in the Czech Republic where it won a pair of medals.\n\nThroughout his career, Moore has held numerous other coaching positions with the USRowing Development and Pre-Elite camps, the U.S. Junior National teams and U-23 National Team. Sports Illustrated featured Moore in its “Faces in the Crowd” section in October of 2009. This prestigious feat came as a result of his impressive 2008-09 collegiate season and a gold-medal finish by his U.S. squad at the World Junior Eights in France.\n\nMoore spent the 2006-07 academic year on sabbatical working with the Canadian National teams and coaches at their training centers in London, Ontario and Victoria, British Columbia. That year, Moore studied under three FISA World Coaches of the Year, Al Morrow of Canada, Mike Spraklen of Great Britain and Bent Jensen of Denmark.\n\nDIVISION III DOMINANCE\n\nMoore invested 11 highly successful years in the women’s rowing program at Williams College. During his tenure, he guided the team to six NCAA Division III national championships (2002, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010). In 2010, Williams became the first Division III school to win five consecutive NCAA titles and it posted an undefeated record in the fall and spring seasons for the second straight year. The NCAA has only crowned a Division III national champion since 2002, giving Moore six of the possible nine titles during his time there.\n\nIn addition to the Eph’s team success, Moore guided 24 student-athletes to All-America honors, 28 to National Scholar-Athlete honors, and coached one Elite 88 Award winner in 2010. The Collegiate Rowing Coaches Association (CRCA) named Moore the Division III Coach of the Year four times (2006, 2008, 2009, 2010) and he was also the National Division III Coach of the Year in 2000. Additionally, he was named the Jimmy Joy Canadian Coaches Women’s Coach of the Year in 2000 and won the Joy of Sculling Coaches Conference Award for Collegiate Coaches in 2009.\n\nCOACHING ROOTS\n\nPrior to Williams College, Moore was the assistant heavyweight men’s coach at Yale from 1996-99. He led the freshman boat to the 1996 EARC Sprints Championship and, later that summer, a victory in the Temple Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. Moore earned his master’s degree in coaching from Central Michigan. A distinguished figure in the rowing community, Moore has presented on rowing and training at numerous clubs, colleges, the USRowing Convention and the CRCA Coaches Academy.\n\nPERSONAL\n\nIn addition to Moore’s coaching duties at Williams College, he served as a lab instructor for the school’s biology of exercise and nutrition course. Moore is also an accomplished athlete. He is an avid master’s rower, cyclist, and triathlete. He has completed five Ironman distance triathlons, including the 2001 Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii.\n\nMoore and his wife, Lisa, have two children, Quincy and Mackenzie."
