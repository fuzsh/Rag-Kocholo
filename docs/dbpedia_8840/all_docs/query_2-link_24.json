        "text": "There’s a part in second verse of Justin Moore’s 2011 song “Flyin’ Down a Backroad” where the country star delivers the line “Up there in Des Moines, they knew my songs line by line/I just stood there in the fake smoke/Another dream came true that night.”\n\nThe song isn’t a single but Moore said he still puts it into his set. The line refers to, he explained, one of the first times Moore heard his single \"Small Town USA\" sang back to him on stage at a radio event in Des Moines.\n\n“I say Des Moines every night on stage no matter where I am,” he said.\n\nNow, a fully matured country star with multiple No. 1 Billboard charting country albums and singles, Moore returns to Des Moines as part of the “American Made” tour that takes over the Wells Fargo Arena stage Thursday night. The tour, billed as a co-headliner, boasts fellow country star Lee Brice and opening act William Michael Morgan.\n\nMoore released his fourth studio record, “Kinda Don’t Care,” last August; the record features country charting single “You Look Like I Need a Drink” and rising number “Somebody Else Will.” Prior to appearing at Wells Fargo Arena, Moore discussed the tour, record and his unforgettable Des Moines show with the Register.\n\nDes Moines Register: You’re on the back end of the “American Made” tour, but I am curious as to how you and Lee Brice ended up as co-headliners on this run.\n\nJustin Moore: The promoter of the tour had the idea and I think we both fell in love with the idea. It’s something different for the fans. Lee and I have a mutual respect for each other and are genuinely friends. (We) saw it as an opportunity to go out there and do something that was a little different, not only for ourselves and fun for us but fun for the fans.\n\nDMR: So what do the shows look like? What’s the dynamic from your set to his?\n\nJM: I think we both have high energy shows. I think we both pride ourselves on going out and trying to put on the best possible show we can each and every night. The thing that’s fun for me … you get to hear a lot of hit music between the two of us. We’re both fortunate that country music radio’s played us for over a decade now.\n\nRELATED: Rascal Flatts, Jake Owen to perform in Des Moines this summer\n\nDMR: “Kinda Don’t Care” came out about eight months ago. How do you feel about that record now that it’s a bit in your rear-view?\n\nJM: Ya know … it’s hard to believe it was eight months ago. It was our third No. 1 album in a row. I feel very blessed and thankful for the fans. This is our 10th year on the road and (fans) are still interested and passionate about our music. It’s humbling to me. I’m so thankful. I grew up in a town of 300 people and to have the opportunity to make music for a livin’ … the fact that we’ve been doing it over a decade now, successfully, is mind-blowing to me. It’s a reminder to how fortunate I am.\n\nDMR: Do you have any artists you’d want to collaborate with that you haven’t yet?\n\nJM: I’ve really been lucky to do a lot of things with a lot of different folks. I’ve done a couple with Hank (Williams) Jr.; I have one on my album with Charlie Daniels; there’s one with Miranda Lambert … I’ve checked a few off the list, (but) my favorite artist of all time is Dwight Yoakam. If I had the opportunity and the right song, I would love to do something with him. He’s, like, the coolest dude ever, man.\n\nDMR: I know you’ve played the Iowa State Fair and Des Moines in the past. Do you have specific memories from your shows here?\n\nJM: I think I had my second single out, “Small Town USA,” (and) it was becoming a pretty big record for us at the time. We played a little, acoustic radio station event (in Des Moines and) it was one of the first times people had sang my songs back to me in my career. I’ll never forget it. I had a song on my second album called “Flyin’ Down a Backroad” (and) there’s a line in the song about standin’ up on stage in Des Moines and people singing my song back to me. I say Des Moines every night on stage no matter where I am. I’ll never forget that.\n\nThe 'American Made' tour\n\nWho: Justin Moore and Lee Brice with William Michael Morgan\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Thursday\n\nWhere: Wells Fargo Arena, 233 Center St.\n\nPrice: $22.75-$59.75"
