        "text": "TULSA, Oklahoma -- Justin Moore was named vice president and director of athletics for The University of Tulsa last month and today was introduced as the Golden Hurricane’s next AD replacing Rick Dickson.\n\nMoore most recently served as executive deputy athletics director and chief operating officer of Texas A&M Athletics. He directed the overall planning, implementation, administration, and day-to-day operations of the athletics department. He also served as the sport administrator for football and men’s basketball.\n\nMoore was asked on Monday how he will make TU competitive knowing he will not have the resources he is used to at Texas A&M.\n\n“I do think you need a certain level of resources to be competitive against your peer group right? So if your goal is the win American, then I think you need to have a certain level of resources to accomplish that. But what wins is not money. What wins is great coaching, great student athletes who get developed and building a great culture. I think talent and resources set your floor and your culture sets your ceiling,” said Moore.\n\nMoore began his tenure with the Aggies in 2012. During that time, he oversaw student-athlete performance and wellness, facilities and event management, fundraising, facility planning and capital projects, academics and life skills, compliance, budgeting, team operations and logistics and scheduling. He also organized a leadership development program for coaches, staff and student-athletes.\n\nPrior to joining the Aggies, he served as director of football operations and assistant athletics director with the University of Houston, which was his first exposure to The University of Tulsa as the two were in the same conference at that time.\n\nMoore graduated from Texas A&M in 2004 with a bachelor’s degree in finance and earned a master’s degree in sport management in 2007. He worked in the private sector as a consultant for Deloitte & Touche LLP, consulting with top-level executives of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nA two-time captain for the Aggie baseball team, Moore was named a Freshman All-American pitcher in 2001, was twice named to the All-Big 12 Team, and was a two-time recipient of the Pat Olsen Most Valuable Pitcher Award. He also earned Academic All-Big 12 Team honors for four years."
