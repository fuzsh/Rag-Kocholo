He brings nearly 20 years of intercollegiate experience as a student-athlete and administrator to the role.\n\n“I am excited to join The University of Tulsa,” Moore said about his hiring. “The Golden Hurricane has a rich athletics history with competitive teams and bright student-athletes, and I believe in the direction of the university under President Carson’s leadership. I am eager to build relationships with so many great people – the coaching and administrative staffs, donors and fans, student-athletes and alumni and the Tulsa community – and get to work advancing this amazing program.”\n\nA Houston, Texas native, Moore arrived at Tulsa after spending much of his career in the Lonestar state. He most recently served as the Executive Deputy Athletics Director and Chief Operating Officer of Texas A&M Athletics, where he worked alongside the Director of Athletics in directing the overall planning, implementation, administration and day-to-day operations of the athletics department.\n\nPrior to moving into that role in 2022, Moore worked in various other administrative role at his Alma Mater, serving as Deputy Athletics Director for Administration from 2019-2021, Senior Associate Athletics Director from 2016-2019 and Associate Athletics Director for Football from 2012-15. During his tenure in College Station, Moore’s influence was felt in almost every department, including student-athlete performance and wellness, facilities and event management, fundraising, facility planning and capital projects, academics, compliance, budgeting, team operations and more. He also spearheaded an extensive leadership development program for the athletics department that offers specific courses and continuing education opportunities for coaches, staff and student-athletes. In addition, he has served as the sport administrator for many of the Aggies’ key sports including football, men’s basketball, men’s and women’s track and field / cross country, men’s golf, and women’s tennis.\n\nIn his four seasons as the Aggies’ Associate Director for Football, he oversaw every aspect of the football program during one of the most successful periods of its history. From 2012-15, Texas A&M won 36 games, earned a bowl berth every season and produced eight First Team All-Americans, as well as the first freshman Heisman Trophy winner in college football history and the school’s first Outland trophy recipient. In addition, the team’s multi-year Academic Progress Rate (APR) and overall team grade point average were both the highest in program history and football student-athletes earned close to 100 SEC Academic Honor Roll citations.\n\nDuring that time, Moore oversaw personnel and staffing, departmental budget, recruiting, team logistics, bowl game coordination, day-to-day operations and football-related facility projects, which included the design process for the Davis Player Development Center, the R.C. Slocum Nutrition Center and Bright Football Complex Renovation, and worked closely with the 12th Man Foundation on the $485 million Kyle Field Redevelopment project.\n\nMoore returned to Texas A&M in 2012 after spending four years at the University of Houston as the Assistant Athletics Director for Football. In his time with the Cougars, the team won the most games in any four-year period in school history and earned a pair of Conference USA West Division titles.\n\nA double graduate from Texas A&M, Moore received his degree in finance in 2004 before earning a master’s in sports management in 2007. After undergrad, he worked in the private sector as a consultant for Deloitte and Touche LLP.\n\nMoore was a two-time captain for the Texas A&M baseball team. He was a Freshman All-American pitcher in 2001, named to the All-Big 12 Team twice and was a two-time recipient of the Pat Olsen Most Valuable Pitcher Award (2001-2002). He also earned Academic All-Big 12 Team honors for four straight years.\n\nA three-sport standout in high school, Moore graduated from Katy Taylor in 1999 and was inducted in the school’s Athletics Hall of Fame in 2012. Moore and his wife Dory have three children: Kate (15), Tysen (13) and Tatum (11).\n\nWhat They’re Saying:\n\nBrad R. Carson - President\n\nThe University of Tulsa\n\n\"Building upon the foundation that Rick Dickson has laid, Justin Moore is the right person to take The University of Tulsa into the next generation of college sports. Justin is extremely well respected among his peers. ADs from Ohio State and LSU personally reached out to affirm that he is one of the most talented administrators in college sports today. Perhaps more importantly, faculty from Texas A&M praised Moore for his work with student-athletes.\"\n\nRoss Bjork - Senior VP and Wolfe Foundation-Eugene Smith Endowed Athletics Director\n\nThe Ohio State University\n\n“Justin is one of the best and most well-rounded administrators I have ever worked with during my time in college athletics. His experience as a student-athlete created a great foundation for all his success and I know firsthand why President Carson picked Justin to lead Golden Hurricane Athletics. Justin has been more than ready to lead his own department and has poise, presence, and leadership characteristics for what is required in this new era of college athletics. Most importantly, Justin is a great person and family man, and will represent the entire Tulsa family in a first-class manner at all times. Congratulations to Tulsa and the Moore family.”"
