        "text": "Justin Moore is no stranger to hard work, as he grew up working with his grandparents who raised cattle. Justin’s other grandparents taught him the love of the outdoors to include hunting and fishing. Justin began performing music during his junior year of high school. After graduation, he joined his uncle’s Southern rock band and moved to Nashville to pursue his music career; the rest is history. Justin’s roots and faith show in his pure country music in songs like “Small Town USA,” “How I Got To Be This Way” and “One Dirt Road.” His ever-steady support of the military, law enforcement and first-responders shows in his song “The Ones That Didn’t Make It Back Home.” And, of course, as an NRA Country artist and NRA member, you hear his love of the outdoors in his songs “This is NRA Country” and “Guns.” He is not only a singer, songwriter, outdoorsman, husband and father, but a true American patriot in the values he stands for and the lifestyle he lives. NRA Country’s Lisa Supernaugh spent a few moments checking in with Justin on what he has been up to recently. To check out more about Justin’s music, tour dates and more, go to justinmooremusic.com.\n\nLS: Tell us a little bit about your first hunting experience; how old were you?\n\nJM: My first hunting experience was when I went to deer camp at 6 months old. I never stopped. I have a ton of great memories of the outdoors and the time spent with family and friends.\n\nLS: Do you share your love of the outdoors with your wife and kids? If so, how?JM: I grew up being an outdoorsman, looking up to my grandpa, uncles and cousins. The first deer I ever took, my mom was with me. I’m passing those traditions down to my kids. It is a family thing that we all love to share together.\n\nLS: Do you have a favorite firearm?\n\nJM: My favorite firearm is one I don’t use a ton. My grandpa was my hero, still is, even though he isn’t with us. He taught me to shoot and hunt and anything to do with the outdoors. He built my mom and dad’s house and their payment to him was they bought him a .264 Win. Mag. That was his baby until he passed it down to me.\n\nLS: Besides music, what was your other talent in high school most folks don’t know about?\n\nJM: I really wasn’t involved that much in music in high school. I was more involved in sports. I always said if I had grown to be 6' 6\", I would have never picked up a guitar. I would still be carrying around a baseball bat or a basketball and gym clothes. However, God had another plan for my talents and that is where he took me.\n\nLS: If you could go back in history and meet one person, who would it be and why?\n\nJM: I have had the opportunity to meet so many of my idols in country music. However, I missed out on being able to meet Johnny Cash, a fellow Arkansian as well as THE Arkansas guy, musician-wise. I would have loved to have met him.\n\nLS: What does freedom mean to you?\n\nJM: When I think of freedom, I think of the opportunity to be free to live and make your own choices as you want. It makes me think of the sacrifices that all the men and women out there fighting have made on our behalf to remain free. It just humbles me.\n\nLS: You have some new music out; what else can we expect from you in 2023?JM: I have a new album coming out in May 2023 called “Stray Dog.” One single is out from the album already called “With A Woman You Love” that has been a big hit already for us. Excited about the new single off the album, “You, Me, and Whiskey.” It is the first duet to put out as a single off of an album of mine. I am happy to have Priscilla Block be a part of that. We are looking forward to lots of great things in 2023."
