        "text": "The small Grant County town of Poyen has unveiled a new welcome sign featuring hometown hero and country music star, Justin Moore.\n\nMoore has had twelve #1 hits over his career and has raised millions of dollars for local charities in Arkansas. After living for 10 years in Nashville, Tennessee, Moore moved his family back home to raise his children where he grew up.\n\nMany turned out to show their appreciation, including Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\n\"One of the things I love about Justin is that he could live literally anywhere in the country. probably anywhere in the world. and yet he chooses to be in Arkansas. Justin doesn't just live in Arkansas, he invests in our state.\" said Sanders. \"He is one of the biggest fundraisers for causes around Arkansas, he is one of the first people we call when we need help after we had devastating storms that pulled through central Arkansas last year. Justin helped put on a benefit concert and raised more than 6 figures to help Arkansas families.\"\n\nThe 3-D \"Welcome To Poyen\" sign sits on Highway 270 near the high school and it will be lit up at night. It was given to the city through private donations."
