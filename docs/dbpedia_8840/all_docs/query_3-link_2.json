        "text": "Multi-PLATINUM hitmaker Justin Moore has built a loyal following over the past decade with his traditional country sound and captivating live shows. The Arkansas-native just notched his 12th No. 1 with “You, Me, and Whiskey,” a smoldering duet with Priscilla Block. Over his 10+ year career, Moore’s No. 1 hits have included “Point at You,” “Lettin’ The Night Roll” “If Heaven Wasn’t So Far Away,” “Small Town USA” and “Till My Last Day,” as well as PLATINUM-certified albums and singles. The Valory Music Co. recording artist has earned multiple ACM, ACA, People’s Choice, and ACC Awards nominations, as well as an ACM Award win. In addition to multiple festivals, headline shows and select direct-support dates, Moore has also been busy hosting his Justin Moore Podcast sponsored by Bobcat with tour manager JR, interviewing guests such as Oscar award-winning actor Matthew McConaughey; Country stars Tracy Lawrence, Jon Pardi, Brantley Gilbert; wrestling champion Diamond Dallas Page and ESPN’s Marty Smith. He also recently took on a new role as co-host on 103.7 The Buzz’s morning drive-time sports talk show, “Morning Mayhem,” where he spends his weekday mornings dishing out his never-ending sports knowledge on-air."
