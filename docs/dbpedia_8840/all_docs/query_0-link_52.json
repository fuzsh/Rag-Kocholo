The Arkansas-native just notched his 12th #1 with “You, Me, and Whiskey,” a smoldering duet with Priscilla Block, and released his latest single, “This Is My Dirt.” Other #1 hits over his 10+ year career include “Point at You,” “Lettin’ The Night Roll,” “If Heaven Wasn’t So Far Away,” “Small Town USA” and “Till My Last Day,” as well as platinum-certified albums and singles. The Valory Music Co. recording artist has also earned multiple ACM, ACA, People’s Choice, and ACC Awards nominations, as well as an ACM Award win. In addition to multiple festivals, headline shows and select direct-support dates, Moore has also been busy hosting his Justin Moore Podcast, interviewing guests such as Oscar award-winning actor Matthew McConaughey; country stars Tracy Lawrence, Jon Pardi and Brantley Gilbert; wrestling champion Diamond Dallas Page and ESPN’s Marty Smith. He also recently took on a new role as co-host on 103.7 The Buzz’s morning drive-time sports talk show, Morning Mayhem, where he spends his weekday mornings dishing out his never-ending sports knowledge on-air.\n\nConocoPhillips Borealis Theatre and Ticket Info\n\nArrive early to make it through the security scan into the Borealis Theatre, please read our bag policy here.
