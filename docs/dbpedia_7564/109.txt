In the male version, Croatia usually wears a baggy hoodie with the same red and white checkers that can be seen on their flag, with the sleeves being gray. They also sport gray jeans with black tennis shoes. Meanwhile, for the female version Croatia usually wears female traditional Croatian clothes and dresses

Personality[edit | edit source]

Croatia is patriotic, calm and patient. They do not like to rush and prefer to devote their time to everything. They are rarely rude in conversations with others and consider this, by itself, unacceptable because they try to be as friendly and responsive as possible.

Flag meaning[edit | edit source]

Color, meaning HEX RGB # # #

The red-white-blue colors of the flag were inspired by the flag of Imperial Russia, which was an opponent of Austria-Hungary and hence a potential Croatian ally. Although Croatians were unable to establish their independence at that time, the flag remained a symbol of aspirations for the future

Origin of the language[edit | edit source]

Croatian is a South Slavic language and is derived from Old Church Slavonic. In the early 20th century, South Slavic nations merged into a united kingdom - Yugoslavia, and unified their very similar languages. Yugoslavia used Serbo-Croatian to maintain unity across the country.

Etymology[edit | edit source]

The non-native name of Croatia (Croatian: Hrvatska) derives from Medieval Latin Croātia, itself a derivation of the native ethnonym of Croats, earlier Xъrvatъ and modern-day Croatian: Hrvati.

History[edit | edit source]

In 1991, against the backdrop of a sharp intra-republican conflict between Serbs and Croats, Croatia declared independence.

Iceland was the first to recognize the new country on December 19, 1991. The declaration of independence by Croatia and Slovenia marked the beginning of the collapse of the SFRY.

After the declaration of independence, interethnic clashes in the republic turned into a war in Croatia, which lasted until the end of 1995.

Finally, the integrity of Croatia was restored in 1998.
