Croatia is a Central European and Mediterranean state, located in contact with and under the influence of various spheres of civilization, which for centuries have penetrated and conflicted on and around the territory of Croatia. Such a position has resulted in various influences which did not always have a positive effect on the development of Croatia. The gradual narrowing and decrease of the Croatian ethnic territory, as well as the presence of national minorities in it, was also a result of the aforementioned position and outside influences (Žuljić 1993/1994).

The demographic structure of Croatia indicates a series of specificities which were primarily conditioned by the historical development of Croatia and which is particularly expressed in constant emigration since the end of the nineteenth century, the relatively large direct and indirect losses to the population during and immediately after the First and Second World Wars, emigration as a type of population movement in all inter-census periods after 1945, the appearance of a natural decline and the aging of the population on almost one half of the state territory.
