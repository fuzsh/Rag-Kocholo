        "text": "Walking proudly with the Croatian flag - Photo credit IG @matterarts_\n\nCroatians definitely have their fair share of rules, habits, beliefs and superstitions, and I’m here to outline the ones I’ve noticed since first setting foot on Croatian soil back in 2007. Some of these I also now do, while others I remain a total outcast for in Croatia.\n\nDon’t sit on concrete, cover your kidneys, eat with a spoon, use lard and liquor if you’re sick, blame the wind if you’re grumpy, and buy olive oil in recycled Coke bottles, are just a few. Read on to discover more rules, habits and superstitions Croatians take very seriously.\n\n1. You do not sit directly on concrete. There must be a thin layer of something, anything, to separate your bottom from any concrete surface below when you sit down. Croatians get creative: I’ve seen people use newspapers, plastic shopping bags, gloves, scarves, even sitting on their hands if nothing else is available.\n\n2. ​Undershirts - I don’t care who you are, you wear an undershirt. Babies, toddlers, children, teens, adults, retirees. And you must tuck it in. Why? Refer to #3.\n\n3. You must keep your kidneys covered. Most Croatians tuck in their undershirts / shirts to avoid “showing their kidneys” (which means leaving the skin on their back exposed where their kidneys would be), which they believe somehow leads to kidney failure, or something along those lines.\n\nSlippers ready for use\n\n4. ​You always wear slippers. Everyone must wear slippers, without exception. Socks are not enough. And barefoot? Basically a death sentence.\n\n5. You avoid any cross-breeze. ”Propuh” (a lovely cross wind that blows through the house) is almost illegal in Croatia. You may not have any two windows / two doors / a window and a door open at the same time - because it could kill you. ​\n\n6. Swearing​. A lot of Croatians swear, and that includes sweet elderly ladies (say she forgot to buy something at the store - it would be normal for her to say a few curse words out loud, and then move on about her day). ​\n\n7. You eat soup at the beginning of a big meal. Soup is never a meal in and of itself, but rather the first course of a meal to open your appetite and encourage you to eat more of the main course.\n\nA beef stew - Photo credit Facebook page Zvona Catering\n\n8. You must eat something “with a spoon” throughout the week (“na žlicu”). Usually at least one meal throughout the week is a stew, or something of that nature which is “eaten with a spoon,” as they believe this is good for their digestive tracts. ​\n\n9. ​They almost all use toothpicks after a meaty meal. Everyone from teenagers to newly weds on their honeymoon, to the 80+ crowd, they all use them! I’ve never experienced so many people using toothpicks in my life. But you must cover your mouth with your other hand while using the toothpick to be polite.\n\nMy father in law with my youngest daughter\n\n10. ​You must blow dry your hair. Letting your hair dry naturally doesn’t exist in Croatia (except for maybe in the hottest week of the summer). Using a hair dryer is a must, even for men with short hair (I’m talking buzz cuts, too). This is a picture of my father in law, and yes, he blow dries his buzz cut.\n\n11. ​You NEVER go outside immediately after you’ve washed your hair, even if you’ve blow dried it. I don’t know the exact number of hours you should wait, but there’s a rule about freshly washed hair and going outside, which could lead to a cough, cold or organ failure :)\n\n12. They use a lot of tissues (maramice). Everyone carries around little individual packs of tissues in their purses / backpacks / bags / pockets etc.​ People of all ages are always prepared with tissues. It’s not because they’re constantly sick with a cold, but somehow their noses run more often than the average other person in the world. ​\n\n13. I don’t know if this is just my inlaws, but a “vegetarian” meal to them, just means that it doesn’t have actual pieces of meat in it. When they make a “vegetarian” meal once in a while, they always cook it with bacon or another type of meat to give it flavor, and then take the meat out for a snack later on. Everything at my inlaws’ tastes a little bit like bacon.\n\nIf you are vegetarian, then read our post about how a Croatian breakfast also won't work for you!\n\n14. ​They wear pantyhose all winter long, but not in the way pantyhose are intended to be worn. Most women wear pantyhose under their pants for an extra layer of warmth. This is basically the Croatian version of long-johns (although it's Croatia, not Canada - the temperature lately rarely drops below zero).\n\nAll kinds of Rakija, Ramića dvori, Paklenica\n\n15. They believe rakija (liquor) fixes everything. Fever? Soak a cloth in rakija and put it on your hands and feet. Got a cut? Rakija will disinfect. Sore throat? Drink it, it will kill the bacteria. ​\n\n16. ​Another home remedy: svinjska mast (which is just lard). Some Croatians use this for bronchitis - you just put a slab of fat on your chest and let it do the work? I’m not convinced.\n\nFanny pack crew\n\n17. Croatian men love to wear their fanny packs. They would seriously be lost without them. I asked Ivan about this when we first met. He replied to my question with another question, “Where else would I keep my keys / wallet / phone / tissues?” I have personally grown to love the fanny pack, Croatians wear them with confidence.\n\nHead over to my Croatian fanny pack post to learn more about this cute habit.\n\nThe bench with the cushions\n\n18. Chairs must have cushions. Wooden or plastic chairs without cushions are a big no-no. Ivan ran out and got these cushions for our kids 5 seconds after we got our new bench for our kitchen table (I know, I know, I keep telling him he should have been an interior designer with such an eye for style). ​\n\nVegeta seasoning\n\n19. ​Vegeta. They love Vegeta and put it in everything (it’s a veggie based seasoning for soups, chicken, vegetables, potatoes). If you don’t cook with Vegeta, you can’t call yourself a Croatian!\n\n20. ​You don’t put your purse on the ground. Putting your purse on the ground means you won’t have any money. If you’re out at a cafe, keep it on the chair next to you, or in your lap, or on the table, or hang it somewhere, anywhere but the ground!\n\n21. “South wind!” (Južina!) If you get a nice warm-front coming in from the south, watch out for some cranky Croatians! They believe the south wind makes them grumpy and irritable. ​\n\n22. Air conditioning. Even in the middle of the summer when it’s 100 degrees, Croatians are extremely cautious when it comes to air conditioning. If the lovely cool air blows on a Croatian, they immediately start feeling a variety of symptoms including (but not limited to): ear pain, back pain, sore throat, fever, chills and a runny nose . I’m not quite sure why people even install them here, because they rarely turn them on.​\n\n23. Need to send a package to someone else in Croatia? Maybe you’re trying to send a whole lamb or a pig, because why not? Use the bus! Just bring your parcel (a box, bag or animal ready to be roasted) to the bus station, find the bus that’s going to the city you want your package to be delivered, then slip the driver a little cash, and voila!\n\n​The person on the receiving end waits for the bus and accepts the package. We’ve had lamb sent to us for special occasions using this method, plenty of times - it's like magic! I could never imagine doing the same thing back in Canada...​\n\n24. Pretty much any big occasion is celebrated by roasting a lamb or pig on a spit (which is often sent by the farmer directly, and delivered by bus like in #23). From weddings and baptisms, to big birthday celebrations and bachelor parties, if there’s a big group gathering, you can certainly expect a roasted animal. ​\n\nHead over to my Croatian weddings post to see why they're better than the rest!\n\n25. The best olive oil comes in used Coke bottles. Most Croatians have their own source of olive oil (a family member, a friend, or a friend of a friend who produce their own fresh from the grove, somewhere near the coast). It’s usually poured and delivered in used Coke or Fanta bottles, and it’s the best, purest, most delicious oil you’ll ever try! ​"
