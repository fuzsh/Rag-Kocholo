        "text": "Croatian Americans are most heavily concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the US. Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Illinois have the highest number of Croatians per state, with 44,578 (0.34%), 36,315 (0.31%), and 37,695 (0.30%) respectively. Wisconsin, Montana, and Washington are also states with significant Croatian populations, although they have slightly lower percentages at 0.25%, 0.21%, and 0.18% respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, states in the Southeast and Southwest regions have lower numbers of Croatian Americans. For example, Arkansas has the lowest percentage of Croatians with only 0.02%, followed by Alabama at 0.02% as well. Meanwhile, Texas has the highest number of Croatians among these states, but it still has a relatively small percentage of 0.04%. Overall, Croatian Americans make up a small portion of the US population, but they have a noticeable presence in certain regions of the country."
