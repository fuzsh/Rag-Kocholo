        "text": "A. EHRI approach to Croatia: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support\n\nIn order to investigate and identify Holocaust-related sources in Croatian archives, EHRI enlisted a local expert and reviewed the pertinent research. EHRI was able to draw on pre-existing research, such as: Slavko Goldstein’s 1941: The Year That Keeps Returning (2013); Alexander Korb’s Im Schatten des Weltkriegs: Massengewalt der Ustasa gegen Serben, Juden und Roma in Kroatien 1941-1945 (2013); Ivo and Slavko Goldstein’s Holokaust u Zagrebu (2001); Zlata Živaković-Kerže, Stradanja i pamćenja: Holokaust u Osijeku i život koji se nastavlja (2006); and Narcisa Lengel Krizman ed. Zna li se: Antisemitizam – Holokaust – Antifašizam (1996).\n\nAs a result, a number of useful finding aids were identified. Online search tools are provided by both the Croatian State Archives and the National and University Library:\n\nArhinet (http://arhinet.arhiv.hr)\n\nBiblionet (http://biblionet.arhiv.hr/)\n\nThe National and University Library (https://www.nsk.hr)\n\nA more traditional guide with general information about archives in Croatia is Igor Karaman’s Studije i prilozi iz arhivistike (Arhiv Hrvatske, 1993, Zagreb).\n\nFurthermore, in Autumn/Winter 2013, the Croatian State Archives published an online paper presenting Holocaust-relevant collections (http://zagreb.arhiv.hr/hr/teme/holokaust.htm). It should also be noted that most collections in the Croatian State Archive and its regional branches throughout the country have their own finding aids with descriptions of what can be found in which box of an entire collection. Some collections are better explored than others, often depending on the interests of archivists who use the collections for PhD theses or other post-doc works. However, they are available only in the archives themselves, and not online. The Review of Archival Collections (Pregled arhivskih fondova i zbirki), which presents overviews of all collections within the State Archive network, is available in every Croatian State Archive. It does not, however, single out 'Holocaust' as a keyword. Its latest edition (2006) is not available in pdf.\n\nAs for surveys by third parties the USHMM has been intermittently active in Croatia since the late 1990s. During the 1990s, local experts surveyed and copied war-time material at the Zagreb State Archives. It currently leads an endeavor to digitise material from other state archives in the country and pre-war records from Zagreb. The USHMM is also helping the Jewish Community in Zagreb archive to sort its material, which will later be digitised. The microfilmed collections from the Second World War (surveyed in the 1990s), plus scanned material from the interwar period and the Second World War (ongoing survey) from different repositories around the country is gradually being put online. Post-war material still remains to be identified.\n\nB. Characteristics of the Croatian archival system and specific challenges\n\nAll collections are usually accessible to the public, but if a file refers to a person who was born less than 100 years ago, it will not be possible to copy that file. Each archival director is responsible for the approval of requests to scan or copy specific material submitted by individual research projects rather than through a more global agreement between institutions.\n\nAlthough important online search tools are available, they are of limited use for Holocaust scholars. Furthermore, keywords such as ‘Jewish’ or ‘Holocaust’ will not produce many results in these online search databases. Some collection descriptions on Arhinet mention that ‘part of the material was copied for the needs of USHMM’ (but typing ‘USHMM’ into the search box will not lead one to collections copied for the USHMM).\n\nKnowledge of regional history, on how institutions were organized, and of who (or which political body) was in charge at given dates in time is essential to find relevant information within the body of archival material. In some cases, there is a high probability of identifying Holocaust-relevant files, such as in the Ministry of the Interior files relating to the Second World War, but often it is more like ‘finding a needle in a haystack’. Researchers need to rely on assistance from local archivist to identify or at least narrow down the search for relevant information to a number of collections. However, this can still leave one with hundreds of boxes to consult without any firm indication of what they may contain.\n\nResearchers are encouraged to contact the archival staff prior to their visit to explain the topic of their research and ask for advice on which collections could be valuable for their research. Employees in smaller archives who do not speak English will usually forward the email to somebody who does and reply within a few days.\n\nC. EHRI identification and description results on Croatia\n\nC. I. In Croatia\n\nEHRI identified and investigated Holocaust-relevant archival institutions and collections in Croatia in close cooperation with USMM and Yad Vashem. The Croatian State Archive in Zagreb and the State Archive of the City of Zagreb are of particular importance. Two other state archives, in Osijek (in the eastern part of the country, close to the Hungarian and Serbian border) and Rijeka (a port town near Italy) are equally important. These two archives are regional centers; Osijek has a rich Jewish history and was home to the second largest Jewish community in Croatia and during the Second World War the border town of Rijeka received thousands of Jewish refugees who had escaped to the Italian sector where life for Jews was somewhat more secure (at least for a while). Three other towns with state archives and a relatively rich Jewish history are Varaždin, in the north, Slavonski Brod, on the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina, which also has a relatively strong and as yet under-researched Jewish heritage, and Split, on the southern coast. Until the 19th century, Split’s Jewish community mostly consisted of Sephardic Jews, but this community also had roots dating back to the Roman period.\n\nApart from the State Archives, other important collection-holding institutions are the National and University Library in Zagreb (which stores interwar Jewish periodicals, some of which were published until April/May 1941), and the library and archive of the Jewish community center in Zagreb. At the time of writing, the latter is not yet open to the public as it is awaiting archival renovation and the sorting of its archival material into collections. There are smaller Jewish community archives, which do not function as public institutions. One needs to first contact somebody from the local Jewish community to find out where they are and if their holdings can be consulted. However, the majority of archival collections of different Jewish communities in Croatia are held in the Jewish Historical Museum in Belgrade, Serbia.\n\nOther relevant institutions for Holocaust research in Croatia include the Documentation Center for Holocaust Victims and Survivors (CENDO), the Jasenovac Memorial and the History Museum of Croatia in Zagreb. The latter reported that they have some possibly interesting material concerning Croatian Jewish families within the Documentation and Information Department, and in the Photography department. However, the museum is under-staffed, so the archives have not been completely sorted and are not recognized as ‘Holocaust material’ even though many of the families whose lives are documented perished during the war. The museum would like to see these materials labelled as Holocaust-related in the future. A similar situation applies to the Museum of Slavonia (‘Brodsko Posavlje’) in Slavonski Brod.\n\nThe Archdiocesan Archives are now a part of the Croatian State Archive system, but some collections are held in a separate location within the church. Therefore, it has been added as a separate institution.\n\nC.II. In other countries\n\nWith the exception of the USHMM and Yad Vashem, EHRI has yet to determine which archival institutions and collections outside of Croatia are relevant to Holocaust research on Croatia. However, archival institutions in other former Yugoslav successor states, such as the Military Archives and the Archives of Yugoslavia in Belgrade, are likely to hold relevant collections."
