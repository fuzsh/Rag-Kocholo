        "text": "The flag was not the modern-day flag of democratic Croatia, which includes a crown above the distinctive red and white shield. Rather it uses an older flag with a complex history that has often been used by diaspora communities.\n\nThe main speaker at the flag raising said: “This day [April 10] is unforgettable,” according to a professional translation. “Croats will continue to keep this day in memory.”\n\nOne of the men in attendance was dressed in black while flying a Croatian military flag with “za dom, spremni” – the Ustasha salute – printed on it.\n\nThe president of the Knights, Pave Jusup, is pictured in front of an Ustasha flag on two of his social media accounts. An amateur soccer team in Melbourne, St Albans Vukovar, until several years ago had the Ustasha’s U symbol prominently on the front of its playing shirts.\n\nThe Jewish Community Council of Victoria has called on sporting clubs and leagues to implement codes of conduct and uniform rules that prevent the display of fascist symbols at matches. “For those supporters or clubs that do not comply, we would urge the strictest sanctions,” said council president Daniel Aghion, KC.\n\nThere are different approaches across Australia. NSW has the broadest laws allowing courts the discretion to define what constitutes a Nazi symbol. Laws in Victoria – and ones to be introduced to federal parliament this week – are narrower in proscribing a limited number of Nazi hate symbols.\n\nExecutive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Peter Wertheim has said any banning legislation must be flexible enough to accommodate the constant evolution of new hate symbols by neo-Nazi groups “as well as the symbols of political movements, such as the Ustasha movement, that were historically allied to the Nazi regime in Germany”.\n\nArrival in Australia\n\nIt’s hard to miss the imposing stone bust of Ante Pavelic in the lobby of Footscray’s Croatian Club in Melbourne.\n\nAs the head of the Ustasha, Pavelic was installed by Nazi Germany and its Axis allies as dictator of the puppet state known as Nezavisna Država Hrvatska (the NDH) – the Independent State of Croatia.\n\nFor decades the club itself was named after Pavelic. Even now, one of its function rooms is named after a convicted war criminal, former general Mirko Norac (another function room was named after a general convicted of war crimes whose conviction was overturned on appeal). The club was approached for comment.\n\nThe Ustasha regime was, until the 1990s, the only modern example of Croatian independence – a long sought-after goal of many Croats.\n\nIts legacy included laws persecuting Serbs, Jews and Roma, stripping them of their rights and establishing concentration camps, including one for children. That ethnic cleansing, done with the agreement of Nazi Germany, is considered by scholars to constitute genocide.\n\nThe most significant concentration camp was Jasenovac. Figures differ about how many were killed there, but the official memorial site has identified more than 83,000 by name. So brutal were the killings – victims were often butchered with hammers and knives – that even Nazi officials expressed concern about the abuses. People deemed political opponents were also routinely executed.\n\nAfter World War II, migration from the Balkans to Australia peaked. Many immigrants were strong opponents of Josip Tito, the communist dictator of Yugoslavia following the collapse of the Ustasha-led Croatia.\n\nMany were also pro-democracy as well as anti-communist, but among the arrivals were significant numbers of Ustasha. “A number of different Croatian emigre organisations were established in Australia from the late 1940s and early 1950s,” says Western Sydney University academic Dr Drew Cottle.\n\n“Despite their differences and complexity these groups were Ustasha-affiliated, Ustasha-linked or Ustasha splinter groups. All were strongly anti-communist, anti-Yugoslav and deeply influenced by the legacies of the Ustasha,” he says.\n\nTheir legacy continues today, Cottle argues: “These groups were extremely successful in creating and continuing a hegemonic Croatian identity within the migrant Croatian community who believed they were exiled from their stolen country.”\n\nThey were also valuable to the Australian government during the Cold War as fierce opponents of communism.\n\nAustralian National University researcher Alexander Lee said Liberal governments from the 1950s to 1970s were “very permissive” of Ustasha links. “It was very normalised in Australia for a long time, the Australian political climate really tolerated it.”\n\nThat permissiveness continued despite dozens of terrorist attacks being attributed to Croatian extremists in Australia from the 1960s. At first, it was ignored by Liberal governments as simply a contained, ethnic problem – Croats attacking Yugoslavs or Serbs.\n\nBut so prevalent were the bombings by Croatian extremists, it later led to a crackdown by ASIO. (It appears likely some of these were false-flag attacks by Yugoslav security services to provoke or frame Croatians as militants. There is a NSW judicial review underway into the convictions of six men, dubbed the Croatian Six.)\n\nThe issue reached its peak in 1972, when Australia-based militants carried out the second attack on Yugoslavia in a decade.\n\nOperation Phoenix, involving 19 militants, prepared for months before entering Yugoslavia from Austria and hijacking a truck. In the style of Fidel Castro’s revolution in Cuba, a small group of militants tried to stir up locals to the cause.\n\nUnlike Castro’s revolution, it failed, with Tito mobilising thousands of troops into what is now Bosnia. Only after four weeks were all 19 insurgents captured or killed, while 13 Yugoslavs died.\n\nWhen the Whitlam government was elected later that year, it moved aggressively against Croatian nationalist movements. In early 1973 attorney-general Lionel Murphy sensationally raided ASIO amid concern that local Ustasha groups wanted to assassinate the Yugoslav prime minister when he visited Australia. At the time Murphy called Srecko Rover a “world figure” of importance to Croatian emigre groups.\n\nWhile much of this detail is now forgotten, the events from the time are a key part of Australia’s history too, in particular a prolonged period of domestic terrorism at the height of the Cold War and a fierce political battle between Australia’s major parties over what to do about Croatian violence.\n\nLee says the major parties used Croatians as a political football: “They weren’t really interested in understanding them.”\n\nHe says the diaspora in Australia is “atypical”, with some clear fascistic lineages for a minority in the community. “[Some] get fossilised in time still fighting the Serbs and Tito, even though it’s a lifetime ago.”\n\nLee is not sure there is an understanding from some of the younger people about what the Ustasha symbols they embrace represent.\n\n“If you look at the number of people who actually speak Croatian in Australia it’s less than a third of the people of Croatian background,” he said. “I don’t know if they know what these things mean.”\n\nHere and now\n\nIn 2013, Australian-born Croatian defender Josip Simunic celebrated a win over Iceland by leading the “za dom, spremni” chant with the crowd.\n\n“I have done nothing wrong,” the former Melbourne Knights player said after the match. “I support Croatia, my home, and if that bothers anyone, that is his problem.”\n\nWhile he was condemned – Zagreb’s county court fined him for inciting racist hatred and he was banned from participating in 10 international matches – in certain circles, support for Simunic grew.\n\nOnline, Facebook pages quickly gained tens of thousands of followers, questioning the chant’s connection to fascism and tying it instead to pure patriotism. Many contested the official and politically accepted view of Croatia’s fascist past.\n\nIn 2016 Simunic denied he meant any harm from the incident and said it was “unfortunate that it’s been associated with a chant that happened in World War II”.\n\nIt was a dialogue that promoted “trivialisation and downplaying of Croatia’s darkest past”, according to University of Copenhagen academic and Yugoslav history expert Tea Sindbæk Andersen.\n\n“It may reflect a more general problem of coming to terms with this past in Croatian society,” Andersen said in her 2016 research.\n\nThe Holocaust Remembrance Project, in which researchers from Yale and Grinnell Colleges rated EU countries on how they face up to their Holocaust pasts, found in 2019 that Croatia was one of the worst countries for historical revisionism, and continued to display an unclear attitude towards its wartime Ustasha regime.\n\nMark Biondich, a Canadian historian who has studied Croatian fascism and nationalism, says parts of the Croat diaspora have cultivated a memory of the war which downplays the atrocities committed by the Ustasha.\n\nThe Croatian role in the Holocaust is minimised, he says, with focus placed on nationalism and the creation of the independent Croatian state. “The struggle for independence took precedence over all else.”\n\nBut in Australia, such views can be even more pronounced. In 2014, when Croatia’s centre-left prime minister Zoran Milanovic visited Australia he was subject to a boycott from some local groups. He said he had been criticised as “Tito’s puppet”, even though he was never a communist party member. Last week Milanovic, who is now Croatia’s president, compared “za dom, spremni” – along with the Slava Ukraini chant – to the Sieg Heil used by Nazis.\n\nCottle says the legacy of the Ustasha in contemporary Australia is “impossible to know” and their influence remains a “sociological puzzle”.\n\n“There seems to be a lingering afterlife which features in Ustasha symbolism, banners and slogans at specific Croatian social events, such as football matches or meetings. Their afterlife may be perpetuated on social media websites,” he says.\n\n“Third-generation Croatian-Australians may or may not know the fascist record of Ustasha in power in wartime Croatia. Ustasha’s history is mythologised. This is part of their lost glorious past in a present where it has no meaning. Symbols, salutes, banners and slogans may be an escape into that Ustasha past. It is the siren call of fascism.”\n\nAt the sprawling Fawkner cemetery in Melbourne’s north-west is the grave of Srecko Rover, with the distinctive checked Croatian coat of arms.\n\nOn the black marble headstone are inscribed the words “Otac hrvatske politicke emigracije”, which translates to “the father of Croatian political emigration”. His father Josip is buried next to him. Josip, like his son, had a senior role in wartime Croatia, administering the redistribution of Jewish and Serbian property in Sarajevo.\n\nWar crimes researcher Mark Aarons says Srecko Rover was a key figure in the wave of terrorism that emanated from Australia in the 1960s and ’70s.\n\n“A lot of the young people who were prepared to put their lives on the line with the two incursions into Yugoslavia in 1963 and 1972 were in the main ... inducted by Rover into the secret underground terrorist organisation the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood,” he says.\n\n“It’s a classic example of a charismatic leader, to be able to influence young people and indoctrinate them, if you like, with hatred for Serbs at its centre.”\n\nAarons says only a minority of the Croatian community hold pro-Ustasha views but contends the links continue today in some form.\n\n“You couldn’t get a group at the soccer all giving the Nazi-era salute ‘za dom, spremni’ if there wasn’t a coherent organisation that ... taught them that this is what they are and that we go back to Ante Pavelic.”\n\nAarons says such views are abhorrent. “If you still had a major faction of the German community in Australia revering Adolf Hitler and excusing the slaughter of Jews, Gypsies and political opponents under the Nazi regime, there would be absolute outrage at every level of society,” he says.\n\nFacing history\n\nOn March 1 this year, Croatia took over the presidency of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), an organisation comprised of 35 member countries including Australia which encourages education, remembrance and research around the Holocaust and antisemitism. It will host two meetings this year, both in Croatia – one in Dubrovnik in June and another in Zagreb in November.\n\nThe Croatian chairs of the IHRA have said that their country recognises the role of the Ustasha regime in the Holocaust but has a complicated relationship with this history. Coming to terms with the past is an ongoing process which takes persistence, they’ve said.\n\nAustralia became an IHRA member country in 2019, and the government appoints a delegation which includes experts, academics and trade officials to attend meetings each year.\n\nOne of these delegates is Dr Andre Oboler, chief executive of an Australian group called the Online Hate Prevention Institute. Learning about Croatian history during the Holocaust will likely be a prominent feature of this year’s IHRA meetings, he says.\n\n“The legacy of that past continues to echo in Australia today,” he says. “Clubs, including sports clubs, formed by members of the movement who migrated to Australia have sought to keep the movement alive. I’m not sure how much they identify with modern Croatia, it is a continuation of the movement from before the end of the war.\n\n“Certainly the symbols of hate from the past are being glorified and that is very concerning and should stop. However, are we dealing with a community whose ideology is still built on hate transmitted through the generations? Or with a community willing to make the effort to reflect and learn from the past, and take positive action, as Croatia itself is doing?”"
