        "text": "We moved to Croatia in 2022 and after road tripping across Europe and seeing the car license plates with the country codes for each EU country vehicle, we were surprised to see Croatia vehicles have “HR” on their vehicle number plates.\n\nSo why is Croatia HR?\n\nLike me, have you ever wondered why the abbreviation for Croatia is HR instead of something more obvious like CR or CO?\n\nAfter living in the country for over a year, hopefully I have a bit more insight into why Croatia is HR - if you’ve ever found yourself wondering why!\n\nWhy is Croatia HR?\n\nShort answer: The abbreviation HR comes from \"Hrvatska,\" which is the native name for Croatia in the Croatian language.\n\nThe abbreviation \"HR\" for Croatia is derived from its official international country code, which is part of the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard. Each country is assigned a unique two-letter country code for various international purposes, such as internet domain names, vehicle registration codes, and international dialling codes.\n\nIn the case of Croatia, \"HR\" stands for \"Hrvatska\" in the Croatian language, which is the native name of the country. Croatia gained independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991 and adopted this abbreviation to represent itself in international contexts. This code is commonly used in internet domain names (such as .hr), vehicle registration plates, and other international identifiers to distinguish Croatia from other countries.\n\nWhere does the Croatia Hrvatska come from?\n\nThe name \"Hrvatska\" (Croatia) has its origins in the history of the Croatian people and their land. The etymology and historical development of the name are complex as there has been a huge influence on the language from various cultures.\n\nEarly Origins:\n\nThe Croatian people have inhabited the region known as present-day Croatia for over a thousand years.\n\nThe earliest known use of the term \"Hrvati\" to describe the Croatian people dates back to the 9th century during the time of the Great Moravian Empire.\n\nQuick facts about Croatia HR\n\n1. Croatian is one of the oldest native languages in Europe:\n\nCroatian is one of the oldest native languages in Europe that is still spoken today. It has its roots in the Old Church Slavonic language and has been continuously evolving for over a thousand years.\n\n2. The Croatian language has three main dialects:\n\nCroatian can be broadly divided into three main dialects: Kajkavian, Chakavian, and Shtokavian. The Shtokavian dialect is the basis for the standard Croatian language, but the other two have had significant historical and regional influence.\n\n3. The accents in Croatian language are called diacritics\n\nThe Croatian language uses the Latin alphabet, but it includes several diacritic marks (accents) that change the pronunciation of letters. These diacritics include č, ć, ž, š, đ, and dž. They are essential for correctly pronouncing words in Croatian.\n\n4. Croatian is both a phonetic and phonemic language:\n\nCroatian is known for its phonemic nature, where each letter corresponds to a specific sound, making it relatively easy to read and pronounce once you know the rules. The diacritic marks (accents) play a crucial role in pronunciation.\n\n5. There is a strong preservation of vocabulary in Croatia:\n\nThe Croatian language places a strong emphasis on preserving its native vocabulary, even when borrowing words from other languages. There's a conscious effort to create Croatian equivalents for foreign words to maintain linguistic purity.\n\n6. Croatia’s cultural heritage:\n\nThe Croatian language is not only a means of communication but also a significant cultural symbol. It is intertwined with Croatia's history, literature, and identity, and it has played a central role in shaping the nation's cultural heritage. Notable figures in Croatian literature include Marko Marulić and Petar Zoranić. The language has a well-established canon of poetry, novels, and plays.\n\n7. Serbs and Croatians can understand each other\n\nCroatian is a standardised form of the Serbo-Croatian language, which was once the common language of Yugoslavia. While Croatian and Serbian have differences in vocabulary, pronunciation, and some grammar, speakers of one language can generally understand and communicate with speakers of the other."
