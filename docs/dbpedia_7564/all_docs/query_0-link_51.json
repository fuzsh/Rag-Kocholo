        "text": "Croatia’s population has shrunk by nearly 10% in the last decade due to an exodus fuelled by a flagging economy, the latest census showed Friday (14 January).\n\nThe latest European Union member is home to just 3.8 million people against 4.2 million a decade ago, Croatia’s statistics bureau said.\n\n“It’s an unbelievable disaster for Croatia,” demographer Stjepan Sterc told broadcaster N1 television.\n\nCroatia’s rural central and eastern parts — already hard-hit by the 1990s independence war — suffered the largest drops.\n\nThe country has been beset by mass migration for years thanks to a largely static economy and lack of opportunity for young people.\n\nA new wave of migration abroad was also spurred by the country’s accession to the EU in 2013.\n\nMore than 250,000 Croatians have left since it joined the bloc, with many seeking a better life in Germany, Austria or Ireland, official figures showed.\n\nAccording to projections by the United Nations, Croatia will likely have just 2.5 million people by the end of the century.\n\nIn December, the conservative government in the capital Zagreb announced a new scheme promising Croatian expatriates in the European Union up to €26,000 to return home and start a business.\n\nIncidentally the EU Commissioner responsible for demography is Croatia’s Dubravka Šuica.\n\n(Edited by Georgi Gotev)\n\nRead more with Euractiv"
