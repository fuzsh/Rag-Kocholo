        "text": "Weekly Briefing, Vol. 43, No. 3 (HR), September 2021\n\nDemographic Crisis in Croatia: Radical Population Change\n\nSummary\n\nCroatia is in a demographic crisis. The domestic political and economic situation discourages positive economic developments and efforts against the high levels of corruption. As a result, many people are emigrating from Croatia with no intention of ever returning. As if this wave of emigration was not bad enough, a flood of young people leaving the country makes up the majority, placing Croatia in a much worse position. Upon Croatia’s accession into the European Union, this wave of emigration grows to its current size, enabled by the freedom of movement of labour in the common European market. All contemporary negative demographic processes have caught up with Croatia, and the coming 2021 census may well prove that Croatia is now a mostly old and impoverished country with less than 4 million inhabitants.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Croatian 2021 population census is currently underway. Unlike previous censuses, there is the expectation that the census will show what the Croatian people see and feel: does Croatia have less than 4 million inhabitants? It is evident to the naked eye that some parts of Croatia, especially rural and less developed urban areas, are becoming places affected by extreme depopulation. People, especially the young, are leaving the country, and few people are moving into or returning to Croatia at all. Furthermore, due to the modern way of life, where the trend is for families to have fewer or no children at all, Croatia loses an average of about 15,000 people a year from negative natural increase alone. Croatia’s demographic crisis is obvious, and its acute phases go deep into the beginnings of a new, independent, democratic state.\n\nCroatian society is getting smaller and older\n\nIndependent democratic Croatia was created in the circumstances of nationalist wars in the territory of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The armed conflicts lasted from 1991 to 1995. In March 1991, before the breakout of war, a census in Croatia was held which established that a total of 4,784,265 inhabitants lived in Croatia, of which 3,736,356 were Croats (78.10%). In the 1991 census, the second most numerous group were Serbs (581,663; 12.16%)[1]. Soon after the wars in Yugoslavia ensued, the conflict between the Croatian leadership and the rebel Serb population flared up, and nationalist policies on all sides (such as ethnic cleansing) were carried out. Because of this drastic disruption, the number and composition of the population changed radically. The 2001 census shows that the total population fell to 4,437,460 inhabitants, of whom 3,977,171 were Croats (89.63%) and much less were Serbs, at about 201,631 (4.54%)[2]. Almost 350 thousand inhabitants disappeared, died, were expelled, or left Croatia voluntarily, all in just 10 years. The circumstances of war were not the only cause of this, proven by the trend of depopulation continuing in the following years of peace. The total number of inhabitants in the 2011 census was 4,284,889, of which 3,874,241 were Croats (90.42%) and 186,633 Serbs (4.36%)[3]. Thus, in 2011 Croatia had 152 thousand fewer inhabitants than in 2001. An additional problem is the modern European phenomenon of population aging and low birth rates. Namely, the average age of the population in Croatia has been growing rapidly since 1971: in 1971 the average age was 34, and in 2020 the average age was estimated at 43.8 years (almost ten years more!)[4]. The birth rate has been declining over the past three decades and in 2020 reached its lowest level of 8.9[5]; specifically, the number of live births was 35,845, which is almost 16,000 less per year than it was in 1991.\n\nSource: Natural Change in Population in the Republic of Croatia 2011-2020, Croatian Bureau of Statistics, 2020.\n\nThe Croatian population is evidently decreasing and it is getting older. However, the causes of these great demographic changes are not found exclusively in the European population trends, or in the war circumstances of the 90s. The key demographic problems of Croatia lie in poverty and corruption.\n\nThe vicious circle of an impoverished corrupt society\n\nWith the independence of Croatia from the former Yugoslavia, the Croatian political leadership carried out three key economic processes: the transformation of social ownership into state ownership, the privatization of certain large segments of state ownership and the deindustrialization of numerous industrial enterprises. All three processes were designed and implemented for the purpose of the fastest possible transition from a self-management socialist economy to a capitalist economy, and furthering the integration of the Croatian economy into the world market. The result of these processes, however, was the devastation of industrial production, a high unemployment rate and a huge increase in social inequality. Society, in economic terms, was suddenly a far smaller place to live, causing many from smaller and rural areas to migrate to larger cities in search of better economic opportunities, and some people to go abroad irretrievably. Due to widespread deindustrialization, a large number of jobs have disappeared and jobs themselves have become a rare opportunity on the market, which is why personal connections, corruption and clientelism play an ever more increasing role in employment. Corruption and clientelism encourage the phenomenon of negative selection, as it hinders economic development and creates the socio-economic basis for new corrupt and clientelistic actions of certain interest circles. At the micro level, Croatia is in a vicious circle of economic deprivation, clientelism and corruption, and that is why it is not and will not be a community attractive for foreigners to live in the near future. Since Croatia is becoming a community that no longer has a place for its own citizens, it is not surprising that Croatia is not a desirable place for foreigners to live, even if they were refugees from the Middle East fleeing from the war. Croatia has become a temporary place for both locals and foreigners.\n\nAfter the Croatia’s EU accession: the exodus of the Croatian population\n\nWith Croatia’s accession to the European Union on 1 July 2013, the negative demographic trend of migration intensified. In her eight years of EU membership, it is estimated that over 370,000 people, mostly young, have emigrated from Croatia. From 2013 to 2021, the number of students in primary schools decreased by 50,000, and just over 50,000 additional new retirees signed up for the pension system[6].\n\nSource: Migration of Population of Republic of Croatia, 2020. Croatian Bureau of Statistics, 2021.\n\nThe free movement of labour within the European Union market has enabled such an exponential emigration. On the other hand, this freedom of movement of labour to Croatia does not achieve comparable immigration. The exception is 2020, when immigration was almost at the same level of emigration, but much of this immigration was temporary residence of labour for seasonal work, as Croatia allows significant imports of labour to repair the economic damage of the Corona crisis. The Covid-19 pandemic has slowed the emigration trend, especially in the lockdown phases, but we will not be able to determine the long-term demographic consequences of the Corona crisis before the end of the pandemic, nor before the stabilization phase of international economic relations.\n\nSource: Migration of Population of Republic of Croatia, 2020. Croatian Bureau of Statistics, 2021.\n\nConclusion\n\nCroatia is undoubtedly in a demographic crisis. It is not on the verge of extinction as some right-wing analysts insist, but there are real problems. The composition of the population is shifting towards a majority elderly population due to political and economic reasons. Policy changes to increase labour imports speak to the need to fill the gaps created by the mass exodus of the domestic population. Croatia must change radically, because it is already changing radically. Politics must realise this fact and take a hold of this change, leading society in the direction of positive demographic outcomes. These positive demographic outcomes are possible if politics tackles the vicious circle of corruption, clientelism and social inequality. Such radical reforms require political leadership that is ready to modernize the entire political community towards one which nurtures tolerance, social justice, and democratically empowered institutions.\n\n[1] https://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/ljetopis/2009/PDF/05-bind.pdf\n\n[2] Cenzus 2001, Croatian Bureau of Statistics.
