        "text": "Knowing bar terms and bar lingo is good for three things. First, giving you insight into what all those wonderful people behind the stick (read on, we'll explain) are doing. Second, making it easier to get exactly what you want at the bar. And last, and definitely not least, sounding cool.\n\nReady to get what you want and sound cool? Obviously. Here's all the bartender terms, lingo, and slang we could get our hands on, all for you.\n\nBartending Terms\n\n#-deep: 2-deep, 3-deep, etc., refers to how many people are waiting in line to get drinks at the bar.\n\nâ86'd: An item that's no longer available. Learn more about 86 meaning and kitchen slang.\n\nAngelâs share: This bartender term refers to the amount of liquor that is lost during the aging process. Most commonly, itâs used by whiskey distilleries. But it also can be used for cognac, brandy, and other spirits. Roughly 1% of the overall volume is lost every year because of evaporation in casks. Therefore, barrels with whiskey that have aged 30 years might lose close to one-third of the overall volume.\n\nAperitif: In bartender lingo, the term aperitif describes low-alcohol beverages that are consumed before eating. They stimulate appetite and usually have an ABV content between 15 and 20 percent. Itâs a common misconception that aperitifs and digestifs are the same thing. The difference between the two bartender terms is that digestives are consumed after eating to aid the digestive system.\n\nâAutograt: Gratuity put on a party's check automatically, usually because of party size.\n\nâBack: A milder drink taken after a shot or neat glass of liquor, e.g., a shot of whiskey with a pickle back is a shot of whiskey followed by a shot of pickle juice.\n\nâBartender's handshake: A gift from one bartender to another, usually in the form of a shot and free.\n\nâBehind: Called out when making one's location known when not in the line of sight, to avoid running into any other barbacks, bussers, or bartenders behind the bar.\n\nâBehind the stick: Working behind the main bar, as opposed to working out in the cocktail area or service station; thought to refer to the keg tap levers (learn: how long does beer last in a keg untapped).\n\nâBev nap: Short for beverage napkin, the small paper napkins placed beneath drinks instead of coasters.\n\nâBitters: A concentrated herbal alcoholic blend frequently added to cocktails to enhance flavor (side note for those wondering what bitters are:Â Angostura bitters is the most widely-used and was invented in 1824 by a German physician for stomach maladies) You can even learn how to make bitters using a bitters recipe.\n\nâBlend: To mix up ingredients and ice in an electric blender; depending on where you live, these could be called frozen drinks or blended drinks.\n\nâBoomerang: A drink sent, usually via a trustworthy customer, from a bartender at one bar to a bartender at another; worth reading more about.\n\nâBroken: Obviously used to describe a physically broken bottle, but also used in reference to a bottle that was killed or emptied.\n\nâBuild: Â To make a drink starting with ice and then systematically adding the other ingredients to build the cocktail.\n\nâBurn the ice: Pouring hot water into an ice bin to melt the ice; usually because a glass has broken over the ice bin.\n\nâBurnt: Refers to the burnt martini, a martini with a small bit of Scotch added; some recipes call for 1:2 scotch to gin, while others call for just a few drops of Scotch.\n\nâCall drink: A drink ordered with both the specific liquor name and the specific mixer name, e.g., Jack and Coke, Tanqueray and tonic water.\n\nâChaser: Anything consumed immediately after a shot or neat drink\n\nâChill: To add ice to a glass or place a glass in a freezer or cooler briefly, so a cocktail can be poured into a cold glass\n\nâClopening: Closing one night and opening the next morning; arguably more inconvenient than the dreaded double\n\nâCocktail: An alcoholic mixed drink, which is either a mix of spirits or one or more spirit mixed with other ingredients like water, soda, juice, or flavored syrup (here are the cocktails every bartender should know)\n\nâComp: An item removed from a customer's bill\n\nâCooler: An alcoholic-based bottled beverage offered in a variety of different alcoholsâvodka, types of rum, wineâwhich comes in a variety of flavors (e.g. Smirnoff Ice, Wildberry cooler, Mikeâs Hard Lemonade)\n\nâCorner: What bartenders, or anyone on the restaurant floor or in the kitchen, say when they're turning a blind corner to prevent collisions with unseen staff\n\nâDash: A few drops of an ingredient (often cocktail ingredients)\n\nâDirty: The addition of olive juice to a martini\n\nâDouble: A drink with double the amount of alcohol as the standard recipe calls for\n\nâDouble (Shift): A work schedule that requires working both the day and evening shift\n\nâDry: The reduction of vermouth in a martini\n\nFeather: This bartender term refers to the practice of pouring a small amount of liquor onto the top of a cocktail.
