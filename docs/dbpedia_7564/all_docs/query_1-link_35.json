The challenge is all about where to draw the boundary between who is and is not Jewish. Jews themselves differ on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and depending on the reason behind the enquiry, there may be a compelling case for choosing one definition over another.\n\nJPR uses four key definitions to describe the size of the Jewish population in different countries: ‘Core’ Jewish population; Population with Jewish parents; ‘Enlarged’ population; and ‘Law of Return’ Jewish population.
