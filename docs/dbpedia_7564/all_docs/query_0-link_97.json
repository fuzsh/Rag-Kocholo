        "text": "Planning your trip and wondering do they speak English in Croatia? Iâ€™ve got you covered!\n\nIâ€™ve been living in Croatia full time since 2014 and have been traveling to the country my entire life, so I know a thing or two about the local scene here. I even attended high school in Croatia for a few years and am familiar with the education system.\n\nOne of the most common questions I get from readers is, â€œDo they speak English in Croatia?â€œ\n\nAnd I get it; language barriers can be intimidating. But Iâ€™m here to tell you that you can stop worrying right now.\n\nBecause the answer is yes, many Croatians do speak English, especially in popular tourist destinations like Dubrovnik, Split, and Zagreb (where youâ€™ll probably be traveling to).\n\nHowever, donâ€™t expect every Croatian you encounter to be an English speaker. Keep reading to learn just how widely spoken English is in Croatia, if you can get around without knowing any Croatian, and more tips to navigate the countryâ€™s linguistic landscape.\n\nIs English Widely Spoken in Croatia?\n\nWhile the official language in Croatia is Croatian, you may be surprised to learn that most of the younger generation, can communicate in English pretty well. This is due to two main reasons:\n\nThe first is that the majority of the younger generation grew up watching television and movies in English with Croatian subtitles, and listening to songs with English lyrics.\n\nThe second reason is that children are required to learn English as a second language when they start elementary school (around the age of 7). Other foreign languages commonly taught in schools, in addition to English, are Italian and German.\n\nOn top of that, most people that work in the tourism industry also speak English very well, as they communicate with foreign guests on a regular basis.\n\nBut donâ€™t just take my word for it. Letâ€™s take a look at the results from a recent study conducted by Education First, the worldâ€™s largest ranking of countries and regions by English skills.\n\nIn 2022, Croatia came it at number 11 on the list for English proficiency based on test results of 2.1m adults in 111 countries & regions.\n\nThe Netherlands, Singapore, and Austria are at the top of the list of countries where the level of knowledge of the English language is considered to be Very High Proficiency. Croatia earned a spot in the same category, coming in just after Germany.\n\nCroatia English Speaking Percentage\n\nCroatia, with its population of around 4 million people, is a country that values multilingualism. Impressively, 78% of Croats speak at least one language in addition to Croatian.\n\nEnglish is the most commonly spoken second language, with around 60% of the population being comfortable in it.\n\nSo, your chances of finding English speakers while youâ€™re exploring Croatia are pretty good!\n\nAs for other languages, German and Italian also have a strong presence, thanks to heavy influence from the previous empires that once ruled the region. These languages rank as the second most commonly spoken, making Croatia a fairly diverse place linguistically.\n\nOver 500 locations at your fingertips\n\nGet access to my ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡· Croatia Google Map for FREE, including my top recommendations for restaurants, bars, beaches, must-visit attractions and more.

Unsubscribe at any time.\n\nNot All Croatians Speak English\n\nWhile statistics show that a significant number of Croatians speak English, donâ€™t expect everyone and their grandma to be fluent. In smaller towns and villages, you might find that fewer people speak English.\n\nBut donâ€™t let that deter you. Using English to communicate isnâ€™t the only way to make local Croatian friends! A smile and a few basic phrases go a long way.\n\nIf youâ€™re wondering how do Croatians say hello, goodbye, and thank you, hereâ€™s a list of common Croatian words that will help bring you closer to the locals you meet on your trip.\n\nHello â€“ Dobar dan (sounds like doh-bar dahn)\n\nGoodbye â€“ DoviÄ‘enja (sounds like doh-vee-jen-yah)\n\nPlease â€“ Molim (sounds like mow-leem)\n\nThank you â€“ Hvala (sounds like hva-lah or fala for easier pronunciation)\n\nYes â€“ Da (sounds like da)\n\nNo â€“ Ne (sounds like n-eh)\n\nSure â€“ MoÅ¾e (sounds like mow-zh-eh)\n\nFAQs\n\nThe Verdict: Do Croatians Speak English?\n\nYes! And their spoken English is very good.\n\nSo if youâ€™re in the midst of planning a trip to Croatia and wondering about the language situation, you can put your mind at ease. About 60% of Croatians are comfortable speaking English, and this is particularly true among younger people and those working in the tourism sector.\n\nGo ahead an pack your bags knowing that youâ€™re well-covered language-wise for your Croatian adventure!\n\nBefore you go, make sure youâ€™ve got the right things on your Croatia packing list.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nWhat Language Do They Speak in Croatia?\n\nHow to Say Hello in Croatian (With Audio Examples)\n\nHow to Pronounce Croatia (With Audio Example)\n\nBest Airport to Fly Into Croatia\n\nThe Best 10 Day Croatia Itinerary By a Local\n\nExactly How to Call Croatia from the USA\n\nHow to Get Croatian Citizenship\n\nCroatia Digital Nomad Visa | The Ultimate Guide\n\nIs Croatia Expensive to Visit?\n\nIs There Uber in Croatia?\n\nCroatia Travel Planning Guide"
