Such a ratio was recorded in most counties.

The place of usual residence is considered a place where a person spends most of his/her daily period of rest, irrespective of a short-term absence from it (e.g. due to going on a vacation, trip, medical treatment, visit etc.). In line with the definition of the place of usual residence, the total population includes the following persons:\n\n- those who have lived in their place of usual residence for a continuous period of at least 12 months before the Census reference time\n\n- those who arrived in their place of usual residence during the 12 months before the Census reference time with the intention of staying there for at least one year.\n\nA live born child (live birth) is every child who at birth exhibits signs of life, such as breathing, beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movements of voluntary muscles.\n\nA deceased person (death) is every live born person in whom there is a permanent disappearance of all evidence of life.\n\nNatural increase is the difference between the number of live births and the number of deaths.\n\nData by age are expressed by completed years of age on the reference date. The data by age groups include persons who reached the age within the limits of an interval.\n\nAverage age indicates the mean age of the total population and it is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the age of the total population.\n\nAgeing index represents the ratio of the population, that is, the share (%) of inhabitants aged 60 and over in the number of inhabitants aged from 0 to 19 inclusive.\n\nFertile female population includes women between 15 and 49 years of age.\n\nPlace of permanent residence, according to Article 2 of the Permanent Residence Act (NN, Nos 144/12 and 158/13) is \"a place and address in the Republic of Croatia where a person has settled with an intention of staying permanently in order to exercise his or her rights and commitments related to life interests such as family, professional, economic, social, cultural and other interests\".\n\nImmigrated or emigrated population is the population that changed its place of usual residence on the territory of the Republic of Croatia or that changed its country of usual residence for a period that is, or is expected to be, of at least one year.\n\nNet migration of population (migration balance) is the difference between the number of immigrants and the number of emigrants of a particular area or country in a given period of time.\n\nTerritorial constitution\n\nThe data are presented by territorial constitution according to the Act on the Territories of Counties, Towns and Municipalities in the Republic of Croatia (NN, No. 86/06), with the situation as on 31 December 2022.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nNN Narodne novine, official gazette of the Republic of Croatia '000 thousand\n\nPublished by the Croatian Bureau of Statistics, Zagreb, Ilica 3, P.
