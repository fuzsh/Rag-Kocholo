The number of deaths will exceed the number of live births by 10,676, so the natural increase is expected to be negative. If external migration will remain on the previous year level, the population will be declined by 3,816 due to the migration reasons. It means that the number of people who leave Croatia to settle permanently in another country (emigrants) will prevail over the number of people who move into the country (to which they are not native) in order to settle there as permanent residents (immigrants).\n\nPopulation change rates in 2024\n\nAccording to our estimations, daily change rates of Croatia population in 2024 will be the following:\n\n109 live births average per day (4.52 in an hour)\n\n138 deaths average per day (5.74 in an hour)\n\n-10 emigrants average per day (-0.44 in an hour)\n\nThe population of Croatia will be declining by 40 persons daily in 2024.\n\nDemographics of Croatia 2023\n\nAs of 1 January 2024, the population of Croatia was estimated to be 4,059,229 people. This is a decrease of -0.36 % (-14,543 people) compared to population of 4,073,772 the year before. In 2023 the natural increase was negative, as the number of deaths exceeded the number of live births by 10,714. Due to external migration, the population declined by 3,829. The sex ratio of the total population was 0.928 (928 males per 1,000 females) which is lower than global sex ratio. The global sex ratio in the world was approximately 1,016 males to 1,000 females as of 2023.\n\nBelow are the key figures for Croatia population in 2023:\n\n39,760 live births\n\n50,474 deaths\n\nNatural increase: -10,714 people\n\nNet migration: -3,829 people\n\n1,954,278 males as of 31 December 2023\n\n2,104,951 females as of 31 December 2023\n\nGrowth Rate 1952 - 2024\n\nCroatia population density\n\nCroatia population density is 71.7 people per square kilometer (185.8/mi2) as of August 2024. Density of population is calculated as permanently settled population of Croatia divided by total area of the country. Total area is the sum of land and water areas within international boundaries and coastlines of Croatia. The total area of Croatia is 56,594 km2 (21,851 mi2) according to the United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nReligion in Croatia\n\nReligion Number of followers Percentage of\n\ntotal population Christianity3,782,34893.4 %Religiously Unaffiliated206,5315.1 %Islam60,7441.5 %\n\nSource: Pew Research Center. The Global Religious Landscape .\n\nNumber of followers estimated by Countrymeters (Friday, August 30 2024).\n\nCroatia age structure\n\nAs of the beginning of 2024 according to our estimates Croatia had the following population age distribution:\n\n15.1 68.1 16.9\n\n- percentage of population under 15 - percentage of population between 15 and 64 years old - percentage of population 65+\n\nIn absolute figures (estimate):\n\n611,279 young people under 15 years old ( 313,738 males / 297,541 females)\n\n2,763,848 persons between 15 and 64 years old ( 1,373,237 males / 1,390,611 females)\n\n684,061 persons above 64 years old ( 268,234 males / 415,868 females)\n\nWe prepared a simplified model of the population distribution pyramid which is broken down into 3 main age groups. The groups are the same as we used above: population under 15, between 15 and 64 and population which is over 65 year old.\n\n65+\n\n15-64\n\n0-14\n\nmale female\n\nNote: The pyramid provided is not corresponding to data given above because the age groups have different number of years.\n\nAs we can see the Croatia population pyramid has a contracting type. This type of pyramid is more common for highly developed countries with low birth and death rates. Usually countries with such kind of population age distribution model have long life expectancy, high level of education and good health care.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Croatia age structure\" is based on the latest demographic and social statistics by United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nAge dependency ratio\n\nDependency ratio of population is a ratio of people who are generally not in the labor force (the dependents) to workforce of a country (the productive part of population). The dependent part includes the population under 15 years old and people aged 65 and over. The productive part of population accordingly consists of population between 15 and 64 years.\n\nThis ratio shows the pressure on productive population produced by the dependent part of population.\n\nThe total dependency ratio of population in Croatia is 46.9 %.\n\nThe value of 46.9 % is relatively low. It shows that the dependent part of population is less than a half of the working part. In other words the working population (labor force) in Croatia must provide goods for itself and cover expenditure on children and aged persons. And this part of population is less than 50% of working population. The value of less than 50% means that the pressure on productive population in Croatia is relatively low.\n\nChild dependency ratio\n\nChild dependency ratio is a ratio of people below working age (under 15) to workforce of a country.\n\nChild dependency ratio in Croatia is 22.1 %.\n\nAged dependency ratio\n\nAged dependency ratio is a ratio of people above working age (65+) to workforce of a country.\n\nAged dependency ratio in Croatia is 24.8 %.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Croatia age dependency ratio\" is based on the latest demographic and social statistics by United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nLife expectancy\n\nLife expectancy at birth is one of the most important demographic indicator. It shows the number of years a newborn infant would live assuming that birth and death rates will remain at the same level during the whole lifetime.\n\nTotal life expectancy (both sexes) at birth for Croatia is 75.8 years.\n\nThis is above the average life expectancy at birth of the global population which is about 71 years (according to Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations).\n\nMale life expectancy at birth is 72.2 years.\n\nFemale life expectancy at birth is 79.6 years.\n\nLiteracy of population\n\nAccording to our estimates 3,422,902 persons or 99.27% of adult population (aged 15 years and above) in Croatia are able to read and write. Accordingly about 25,048 adults are illiterate.\n\nLiteracy rate for adult male population is 99.66% (1,635,824 persons). 5,647 are illiterate.\n\nLiteracy rate for adult female population is 98.93% (1,787,077 persons). 19,402 are illiterate.\n\nYouth literacy rates are 99.73% and 99.75% for males and females accordingly. The overall youth literacy rate is 99.74%. Youth literacy rate definition covers the population between the ages of 15 to 24 years.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Croatia population literacy\" is based on the latest data published by UNESCO Institute for Statistics (retrieved March 13, 2016) .\n\nCroatia population history\n\nYearPopulationGrowth Rate 19513,868,405N/A %19523,904,5440.93 %19533,941,0450.93 %19543,977,2780.92 %19554,012,9230.90 %19564,047,6900.87 %19574,081,5870.84 %19584,114,4430.80 %19594,146,3580.78 %19604,177,3860.75 %19614,207,6950.73 %19624,237,0810.70 %19634,265,3550.67 %19644,292,0970.63 %19654,317,0580.58 %19664,339,9620.53 %19674,360,9200.48 %19684,380,1390.44 %19694,398,0340.41 %19704,414,9050.38 %19714,431,0100.36 %19724,446,4440.35 %19734,461,5710.34 %19744,476,8420.34 %19754,492,7640.36 %19764,509,5330.37 %19774,527,2220.39 %19784,545,8830.41 %19794,565,8060.44 %19804,587,1370.47 %19814,609,8680.50 %19824,633,5110.51 %19834,657,6120.52 %19844,681,5880.51 %19854,704,8670.50 %19864,727,1280.47 %19874,748,1370.44 %19884,765,9610.38 %19894,777,1850.24 %19904,778,4820.03 %19914,768,119-0.22 %19924,746,360-0.46 %19934,715,056-0.66 %19944,677,505-0.80 %19954,637,113-0.86 %19964,595,711-0.89 %19974,553,472-0.92 %19984,511,989-0.91 %19994,474,030-0.84 %20004,442,183-0.71 %20014,417,992-0.54 %20024,401,887-0.36 %20034,392,327-0.22 %20044,386,379-0.14 %20054,380,948-0.12 %20064,374,394-0.15 %20074,366,570-0.18 %20084,357,506-0.21 %20094,346,903-0.24 %20104,334,658-0.28 %20114,320,569-0.33 %20124,304,436-0.37 %20134,286,152-0.42 %20144,265,969-0.47 %20154,244,103-0.51 %20164,220,676-0.55 %20174,195,623-0.59 %20184,169,518-0.62 %20194,143,246-0.63 %20204,117,715-0.62 %20214,103,015-0.36 %20224,088,367-0.36 %20234,073,772-0.36 %20244,059,229-0.36 %\n\nThe data is given as of 1st of January of an year."
