        "text": "This page contains all the latest data, insights, and trends you need to help you understand how people in Croatia use digital devices and services in 2024.\n\nIf you want to check whether this is our most up-to-date report for Croatia, or if you’re looking for data on digital trends and behaviours in Croatia for previous years, you can find DataReportal’s full collection of reports on Croatia by clicking here.\n\nYou’ll also find the complete Digital 2024 report for Croatia in the “full report” section below, but we’ll start by taking a look at the essential headline numbers for Croatia this year.\n\nJust before that, we’d like to thank We Are Social and Meltwater for making the 2024 Global Digital Reports series possible.\n\nOK, let’s get into the data…\n\nThe state of digital in Croatia in 2024\n\nHere are DataReportal’s essential headlines for digital adoption and use in Croatia in early 2024:\n\nThere were 3.37 million internet users in Croatia at the start of 2024, when internet penetration stood at 84.4 percent.\n\nCroatia was home to 2.79 million social media users in January 2024, equating to 69.8 percent of the total population.\n\nA total of 5.31 million cellular mobile connections were active in Croatia in early 2024, with this figure equivalent to 132.9 percent of the total population.\n\nThese headline stats offer a great overview of the “state of digital” in Croatia, but in order to make sense of how digital trends and behaviours are evolving, we need to dig deeper into the data.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at what the latest numbers tell us, starting with some valuable context relating to the population of Croatia.\n\nPopulation of Croatia in 2024\n\nThe population of Croatia stood at 4.00 million in January 2024.\n\nData shows that Croatia’s population decreased by 22 thousand (-0.5 percent) between early 2023 and the start of 2024.\n\n51.2 percent of Croatia’s population is female, while 48.8 percent of the population is male.\n\nAt the start of 2024, 58.8 percent of Croatia’s population lived in urban centres, while 41.2 percent lived in rural areas.\n\nNote: gender data are currently only available for “female” and “male”.\n\nCroatia’s population by age\n\nThe median age of Croatia’s population is 44.3.\n\nHere’s how Croatia’s total population breaks down by age group:\n\n4.3 percent is between the ages of 0 and 4.\n\n7.5 percent is between the ages of 5 and 12.\n\n5.1 percent is between the ages of 13 and 17.\n\n7.1 percent is between the ages of 18 and 24.\n\n12.0 percent is between the ages of 25 and 34.\n\n13.6 percent is between the ages of 35 and 44.\n\n13.4 percent is between the ages of 45 and 54.\n\n14.1 percent is between the ages of 55 and 64.\n\n22.9 percent is aged 65 and above.\n\nNote: percentages may not sum to 100 percent due to rounding.\n\nInternet use in Croatia in 2024\n\nThere were 3.37 million internet users in Croatia in January 2024.\n\nCroatia’s internet penetration rate stood at 84.4 percent of the total population at the start of 2024.\n\nKepios analysis indicates that internet users in Croatia decreased by 18 thousand (-0.5 percent) between January 2023 and January 2024.\n\nFor perspective, these user figures reveal that 625.6 thousand people in Croatia did not use the internet at the start of 2024, suggesting that 15.7 percent of the population remained offline at the beginning of the year.\n\nHowever, complexities associated with the collection and analysis of internet user data mean that it can often take several months before research is ready for publication. As a result, the latest published figures for internet use invariably under-represent reality, and actual adoption and growth may be higher than the figures shown here suggest. Please see our comprehensive notes on data for further details.\n\nDig deeper: for the latest insights into internet adoption and use around the world, follow our regular Global Statshot reports.\n\nGo global: see how Croatia’s current “state of digital” compares with connectivity in other countries by reading our flagship Digital 2024 Global Overview Report, which includes hundreds of slides of global digital data, and our in-depth analysis of what these numbers might mean for you.\n\nInternet connection speeds in Croatia in 2024\n\nData published by Ookla indicate that internet users in Croatia could have expected the following internet connection speeds at the start of 2024:\n\nMedian mobile internet connection speed via cellular networks: 88.24 Mbps.\n\nMedian fixed internet connection speed: 62.16 Mbps.\n\nOokla’s data reveals that the median mobile internet connection speed in Croatia increased by 17.97 Mbps (+25.6 percent) in the twelve months to the start of 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Ookla’s data shows that fixed internet connection speeds in Croatia increased by 15.66 Mbps (+33.7 percent) during the same period.\n\nSocial media statistics for Croatia in 2024\n\nDataReportal’s figures show that there were 2.79 million active social media user identities in Croatia in January 2024.\n\nNote: over the past year, we’ve made some important changes to how we calculate social media user numbers, and the data sources that we use to inform these calculations have also made significant and wide-ranging revisions to their published figures during that period.\n\nAs a result, our latest figure for social media use might appear to be quite different to the values that we published in previous years.\n\nBecause of this, we advise caution when comparing the social media user values published in this year’s reports with those published in previous years, especially because changes in reported values may be the result of “corrections” in the source data, as well as changes in actual user behaviour.\n\nFor clarity, Kepios analysis shows that social media users in Croatia decreased by 150 thousand (-5.1 percent) between early 2023 and the beginning of 2024.\n\nThe number of social media users in Croatia at the start of 2024 was equivalent to 69.8 percent of the total population, but it’s important to stress that social media users may not represent unique individuals (see our detailed notes on data to learn why).\n\nMeanwhile, data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 2.48 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Croatia at the start of 2024, which was equivalent to 74.7 percent of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.\n\nMore broadly, 82.7 percent of Croatia’s total internet user base (regardless of age) used at least one social media platform in January 2024.\n\nAt that time, 50.0 percent of Croatia’s social media users were female, while 50.0 percent were male.\n\nNote: gender data are currently only available for “female” and “male”.\n\nGet fresh insights: our handy social media overview page helps you stay up to date with global social media trends, offering essential headlines for social media adoption, as well as the latest user figures for the world’s most widely used social media platforms.\n\nFacebook users in Croatia in 2024\n\nData published in Meta’s advertising resources indicates that Facebook had 1.70 million users in Croatia in early 2024.\n\nHowever, Meta has made important changes to the way its advertising resources report audience reach data over recent months – including making significant revisions to its base audience data for Facebook – so the figures shown here may not be directly comparable with figures published in our previous reports.\n\nTo learn more about these changes, please see this article, as well as our comprehensive notes on data.\n\nFacebook user growth in Croatia\n\nFigures published in Meta’s own tools indicate that Facebook’s potential ad reach in Croatia decreased by 50 thousand (-2.9 percent) between January 2023 and January 2024.\n\nFor more recent context, the same data show that the number of users that marketers could reach with ads on Facebook in Croatia decreased by 200 thousand (-10.5 percent) between October 2023 and January 2024.\n\nHowever, it’s important to stress that these advertising reach figures are not the same as the monthly active users figures that Meta reports in its investor earnings announcements, and they should not be interpreted as such.\n\nAs the company states within its ad planning tools,\n\n“Estimated audience size is not a proxy for monthly or daily active users, or for engagement. Estimates aren’t designed to match population, census estimates or other sources, and may differ depending on factors such as how many accounts across Meta technologies a person has, how many temporary visitors are in a particular geographic location at a given time, and Meta user-reported demographics.”\n\nAs a result, changes in ad reach may not necessarily indicate any change in the platform’s overall user base.\n\nBut despite these caveats, Meta’s ad reach data still offers valuable insights into how Facebook use is evolving.\n\nFacebook adoption in Croatia\n\nFacebook’s ad reach in Croatia was equivalent to 42.5 percent of the total population at the start of 2024.\n\nHowever, Meta only allows people aged 13 and above to use Facebook, so it’s worth highlighting that 48.2 percent of the “eligible” audience in Croatia uses Meta in 2024.\n\nFor additional context, Facebook’s ad reach in Croatia was equivalent to 50.4 percent of the local internet user base (regardless of age) in January 2024.\n\nAt the start of 2024, 49.1 percent of Facebook’s ad audience in Croatia was female, while 50.9 percent was male.\n\nNote: Meta’s advertising resources only publish audience gender data for “female” and “male” users.\n\n▶ Looking for more Facebook stats?

Click here to explore our in-depth Snapchat data for every country in the world.\n\nX users in Croatia in 2024\n\nNumbers published in X (Twitter)’s advertising resources indicate that X had 648.7 thousand users in Croatia in early 2024.\n\nThis figure means that X’s ad reach in Croatia was equivalent to 16.2 percent of the total population at the time.\n\nHowever, it’s important to stress that these advertising reach figures are not the same as monthly active user figures, and there may be meaningful differences between the size of X’s ad audience and its total active user base.\n\nMoreover, we’ve seen some particularly bizarre trends in the data reported in X’s advertising tools over the past year, so we’d advise caution when it comes to analysing these X figures.\n\nIt’s worth noting that X only allows people aged 13 and above to use its platform, so the latest figures suggest that 18.4 percent of the “eligible” audience in Croatia uses X in 2024.\n\nFor additional context, X’s ad reach in Croatia was equivalent to 19.2 percent of the local internet user base (regardless of age) at the start of the year.\n\nIn early 2024, the company’s own data indicated that 59.1 percent of X’s ad audience in Croatia was female, while 40.9 percent was male.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that X infers its users’ gender, by analysing signals such as the name that users enter in their profile, and their broader activity on the platform.\n\nThis contrasts with the gender data offered in the advertising tools of platforms like Facebook, which relies on the gender that users themselves enter in their own profile.\n\nMoreover, our analysis suggests that X’s inferences may not be particularly reliable in determining users’ gender, especially in countries where English is not the dominant language.\n\nFor example, consumer research findings published by GWI often offer quite a different picture of X use by gender compared with X’s own audience data.\n\nBut the apparent distortions that frequently appear in X’s inferred gender data may be due in large part to the high number of “non-human” accounts that feature in X’s active user data (e.g. accounts that represent businesses, animals, musicians, etc.), especially because X doesn’t currently separate these accounts out from “real” human individuals in the ways that Facebook and Instagram do.\n\nRegardless of the cause of these anomalies though, we advise caution when analysing or interpreting X’s reported figures for use by gender.\n\nX user growth in Croatia\n\nData published in X (Twitter)’s own ad planning tools show that X’s potential ad reach in Croatia increased by 351 thousand (+118 percent) between the start of 2023 and early 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, the same data show that the number of users that marketers could reach with ads on X in Croatia decreased by 401 thousand (-38.2 percent) between October 2023 and January 2024.\n\nHowever, please note that the figures published in X’s planning tools appear to be liable to significant fluctuation – even over short periods of time – and these anomalies may impact the reliability and representativeness of this change data.\n\n▶ Looking for more Twitter stats?
