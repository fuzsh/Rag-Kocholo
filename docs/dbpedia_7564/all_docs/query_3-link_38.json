        "text": "Recommended for unvaccinated travelers one year old or older going to Croatia.\n\nInfants 6 to 11 months old should also be vaccinated against Hepatitis A. The dose does not count toward the routine 2-dose series.\n\nTravelers allergic to a vaccine component should receive a single dose of immune globulin, which provides effective protection for up to 2 months depending on dosage given.\n\nUnvaccinated travelers who are over 40 years old, are immunocompromised, or have chronic medical conditions planning to depart to a risk area in less than 2 weeks should get the initial dose of vaccine and at the same appointment receive immune globulin.\n\nCases of measles are on the rise worldwide. Travelers are at risk of measles if they have not been fully vaccinated at least two weeks prior to departure, or have not had measles in the past, and travel internationally to areas where measles is spreading.\n\nAll international travelers should be fully vaccinated against measles with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, including an early dose for infants 6–11 months, according to CDC’s measles vaccination recommendations for international travel.\n\nDogs infected with rabies are not commonly found in Croatia.\n\nIf rabies exposures occur while in Croatia, rabies vaccines are typically available throughout most of the country.\n\nRabies pre-exposure vaccination considerations include whether travelers 1) will be performing occupational or recreational activities that increase risk for exposure to potentially rabid animals and 2) might have difficulty getting prompt access to safe post-exposure prophylaxis.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether you should receive pre-exposure vaccination before travel.\n\nFor more information, see country rabies status assessments."
