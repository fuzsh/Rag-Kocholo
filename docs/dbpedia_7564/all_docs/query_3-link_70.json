        "text": "Most of the foreign telephone directories held by the Library of Congress are uncataloged. We have therefore compiled this list of directories from the country of Croatia as a finding aid for our staff and researchers. These directories cover Croatia between the years 1948-2015. See also the finding aid for directories from former Yugoslavia which may contain information for towns from Croatia. In addition to the uncataloged directories listed below, the Library also holds a handful that are cataloged and may be requested using the online catalog. To locate these directories, search the Library of Congress Online Catalog using subject keywords such as \"Yugoslavia\" and \"directories,\" or \"Croatia\" and \"directories,\" or the name of a city plus \"directories.\" In addition to telephone directories, this kind of search also yields business/address directories from Croatia. Additionally, the Library of Congress holds two microfilm sets of telephone directories the contents of which are included in the list.\n\nThe finding aid, which represents Library of Congress holdings as of January 2020, is arranged by country/republic, then by city, and then by the year prominently displayed on the cover of the piece, which may or may not be the actual date of publication (i.e., a directory will often have one year in large print on the cover, and a different, usually earlier, year of publication elsewhere). Directories that cover all of Croatia appear first in the list. The type of directory is indicated by the words \"residential,\" \"organizational,\" or \"both\" for directories that include both business and private numbers.\n\nMany of the directories from Croatia include both organizational and residential listings mixed together. Until the early 1970s, very few directories provided a separate \"yellow pages\" section, although many had a section of additional advertisements at the end.\n\nAll directories are in the Latin alphabet unless otherwise noted. In addition to an alphabetical arrangement by surname, business name, occupation or trade, many directories provide a numerical listing of entries arranged by phone number to determine who held a particular number for a given year. This feature is indicated in the notes field with the words \"numerical index.\" Often the notes field will have a statement beginning with words such as \"Stanje,\" followed by a date. This statement is taken either from the title page or title page verso and can be translated loosely as \"the situation as of a given date.\" It merely offers more precise dating for the contents of the directory."
