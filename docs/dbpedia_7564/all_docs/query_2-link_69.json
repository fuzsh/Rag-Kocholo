        "text": "A simple brute force attack occurs when a hacker attempts to guess a user’s login credentials manually without using any software. This is typically through standard password combinations or personal identification number (PIN) codes.\n\nThese attacks are simple because many people still use weak passwords, such as \"password123\" or \"1234,\" or practice poor password etiquette, such as using the same password for multiple websites. Passwords can also be guessed by hackers that do minimal reconnaissance work to crack an individual's potential password, such as the name of their favorite sports team.\n\nA dictionary attack is a basic form of brute force hacking in which the attacker selects a target, then tests possible passwords against that individual’s username. The attack method itself is not technically considered a brute force attack, but it can play an important role in a bad actor’s password-cracking process.\n\nThe name \"dictionary attack\" comes from hackers running through dictionaries and amending words with special characters and numbers. This type of attack is typically time-consuming and has a low chance of success compared to newer, more effective attack methods.\n\nA hybrid brute force attack is when a hacker combines a dictionary attack method with a simple brute force attack. It begins with the hacker knowing a username, then carrying out a dictionary attack and simple brute force methods to discover an account login combination.\n\nThe attacker starts with a list of potential words, then experiments with character, letter, and number combinations to find the correct password. This approach allows hackers to discover passwords that combine common or popular words with numbers, years, or random characters, such as \"SanDiego123\" or \"Rover2020.\"\n\nA reverse brute force attack sees an attacker begin the process with a known password, which is typically discovered through a network breach. They use that password to search for a matching login credential using lists of millions of usernames. Attackers may also use a commonly used weak password, such as \"Password123,\" to search through a database of usernames for a match.\n\nCredential stuffing preys on users’ weak password etiquettes. Attackers collect username and password combinations they have stolen, which they then test on other websites to see if they can gain access to additional user accounts. This approach is successful if people use the same username and password combination or reuse passwords for various accounts and social media profiles.\n\nThe longer and more complex a password is, the more difficult it is to crack. An eight-character password is widely considered to be crackable in a few hours. A 2019 research found that any eight-character password, no matter how complex, could be cracked in just 2.5 hours."
