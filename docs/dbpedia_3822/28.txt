Urusan, a Nerek woman of the Owl Clan, was the grandmother of six orphaned grandchildren, all under the age of twelve, who had lost both parents to Truce Fever. Urusan subsequently left the north and came south to Letheras, the capital city of the Letherii Empire, to take care of the children as best she could. They resided in a partially collapsed hovel near the refuse pit known as Errant's Heel.[1]

In Midnight Tides[]

Urusan unwisely approached Gerun Eberict and seven of his armed men on Buried Round to beg for coin. The Finadd was already raging about the disappearance of all his men spying on Tehol Beddict. Eberict exploded at Urusan's interruption and ordered his guards to kill her out-of-hand, which two of them quickly did with mortal sword thrusts to her chest.[1]

Urusan managed to stagger the two to three hundred paces back to her family's home with extraordinary effort, to tell them who was responsible for her imminent death and, more importantly, to let them know that she had not simply abandoned them.[1]

After she passed, one of the children went to fetch Bugg, Tehol Beddict's manservant, who was known as a 'dresser of the dead' who provided his services free of charge in certain circumstances. Bugg told the children that he would take appropriate care of their grandmother's body, and even agreed to give Urusan his 'blessing' when they insisted upon it, even though he made it clear to them that he was neither Nerek nor a priest.[1]

Bugg's biggest concern, however, was what was to become of the young children now that their grandmother would no longer be there to look out for them. Fortunately, at that point, an extremely large half-Tarthenal, half-Nerek young man appeared, who proved to be the children's adored cousin, Unn. Unn was not only prepared to take the children under his wing, but he also indicated his intention to avenge the murder of Urusan (who was, possibly, his grandmother as well).[1]
