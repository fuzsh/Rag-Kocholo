Use that information to find a competitive advantage for your business.\n\nLearn more about conducting market research\n\nWrite your business plan\n\nYour business plan is the foundation of your business. It’s a roadmap for how to structure, run, and grow your new business. You’ll use it to convince people that working with you — or investing in your company — is a smart choice.\n\nLearn more about writing your business plan\n\nFund your business\n\nYour business plan will help you figure out how much money you’ll need to start your business. If you don’t have that amount on hand, you’ll need to either raise or borrow the capital. Fortunately, there are more ways than ever to find the capital you need.\n\nLearn more about funding your business\n\nPick your business location\n\nYour business location is one of the most important decisions you’ll make. Whether you’re setting up a brick-and-mortar business or launching an online store, the choices you make could affect your taxes, legal requirements, and revenue.\n\nLearn more about picking your business location\n\nChoose a business structure\n\nThe legal structure you choose for your business will impact your business registration requirements, how much you pay in taxes, and your personal liability.\n\nLearn more about choosing a business structure\n\nChoose your business name\n\nIt’s not easy to pick the perfect name. You’ll want one that reflects your brand and captures your spirit. You’ll also want to make sure your business name isn’t already being used by someone else.\n\nLearn more about choosing a business name\n\nRegister your business\n\nOnce you’ve picked the perfect business name, it’s time to make it legal and protect your brand. If you’re doing business under a name different than your own, you’ll need to register with the federal government, and maybe your state government, too.\n\nLearn more about registering your business\n\nGet federal and state tax IDs\n\nYou’ll use your employer identification number (EIN) for important steps to start and grow your business, like opening a bank account and paying taxes. It’s like a social security number for your business. Some — but not all — states require you to get a tax ID as well.\n\nLearn more about getting tax IDs\n\nApply for licenses and permits\n\nKeep your business running smoothly by staying legally compliant. The licenses and permits you need for your business will vary by industry, state, location, and other factors.\n\nLearn more about licenses and permits\n\nOpen a business bank account\n\nA small business checking account can help you handle legal, tax, and day-to-day issues.
