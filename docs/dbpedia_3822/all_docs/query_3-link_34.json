In this short guide, we explain how you can improve your surveys and showcase some of the tools and resources you can leverage in the process.\n\nBut first, when it comes to market research, how many people do you need to interview to get results representative of the target population with the level of confidence that you are willing to accept?\n\nHowever, if all of this sounds new to you, let's start with what sample size is.\n\nFree eBook: The complete guide to determining sample size\n\nWhat is sample size?\n\nSample size is a term used in market research to define the number of subjects included in a survey, study, or experiment. In surveys with large populations, sample size is incredibly important. The reason for this is because it's unrealistic to get answers or results from everyone - instead, you can take a random sample of individuals that represent the population as a whole.\n\nFor example, we might want to compare the performance of long-distance runners that eat Weetabix for breakfast versus those who don't. Since it's impossible to track the dietary habits of every long-distance runner across the globe, we would have to focus on a segment of the survey population. This might mean selecting 1,000 runners for the study.\n\nHow can sample size influence results?\n\nThat said, no matter how diligent we are with our selection, there will always be some margin of error (also referred to as confidence interval) in the study results, that's because we can't speak to every long-distance runner or be confident of how Weetabix influences (in every possible scenario), the performance of long-distance runners. This is known as a \"sampling error.\"\n\nLarger sample sizes will help to mitigate the margin of error, helping to provide more statistically significant and meaningful results. In other words, a more accurate picture of how eating Weetabix can influence the performance of long-distance runners.\n\nSo what do you need to know when calculating the minimum sample size needed for a research project?\n\nWhat you need to know to calculate survey sample size\n\nConfidence interval (or margin of error)\n\nThe confidence interval is the plus-or-minus figure that represents the accuracy of the reported. Consider the following example:\n\nA Canadian national sample showed \"Who Canadians spend their money on for Mother's Day.\" Eighty-two percent of Canadians expect to buy gifts for their mom, compared to 20 percent for their wife and 15 percent for their mother-in-law. In terms of spending, Canadians expect to spend $93 on their wife this Mother's Day versus $58 on their mother. The national findings are accurate, plus or minus 2.75 percent, 19 times out of 20.\n\nFor example, if you use a confidence interval of 2.75 and 82% percent of your sample indicates they will \"buy a gift for mom\" you can be \"confident (95% or 99%)\" that if you had asked the question to ALL CANADIANS, somewhere between 79.25% (82%-2.75%) and 84.75% (82%+2.75%) would have picked that answer.\n\nConfidence interval is also called the \"margin of error.\" Are you needing to understand how the two calculations correlate?\n\nConfidence level\n\nThe confidence level tells you how confident you are of this result. It is expressed as a percentage of times that different samples (if repeated samples were drawn) would produce this result. The 95% confidence level means that 19 times out of twenty that results would fall in this - + interval confidence interval. The 95% confidence level is the most commonly used.\n\nWhen you put the confidence level and the confidence interval together, you can say that you are 95% (19 out of 20) sure that the true percentage of the population that will \"buy a gift for mom\" is between 79.25% and 84.75%.\n\nWider confidence intervals increase the certainty that the true answer is within the range specified. These wider confidence intervals come from smaller sample sizes. When the costs of an error is extremely high (a multi-million dollar decision is at stake) the confidence interval should be kept small. This can be done by increasing the sample size.\n\nPopulation size\n\nPopulation size is the total amount of people in the group you're trying to study. If you were taking a random sample of people across the U.K., then your population size would be just over 68 million (as of 09 August 2021).\n\nStandard deviation\n\nThis refers to how much individual responses will vary between each other and the mean. If there's a low standard deviation, scores will be clustered near the mean with minimal variation. A higher standard deviation means that when plotted on a graph, responses will be more spread out.\n\nStandard deviation is expressed as a decimal, and 0.5 is considered a \"good\" standard deviation to set to ensure a sample size that represents the population.\n\nHow can you calculate sample size?\n\nAfter you've considered the four above variables, you should have everything required to calculate your sample size.\n\nHowever, if you don't know your population size, you can still calculate your sample size. To do this, you need two pieces of information: a z-score and the sample size formula.\n\nWhat is a z-score?\n\nA z-score is simply the numerical representation of your desired confidence level. It tells you how many standard deviations from the mean your score is.\n\nThe most common percentages are 90%, 95%, and 99%.\n\nz = (x – μ) / σ\n\nAs the formula shows, the z-score is simply the raw score minus the population mean and divided by the population's standard deviation.\n\nUsing a sample size calculation\n\nOnce you have your z-score, you can fill out your sample size formula, which is:\n\nIs there an easier way to calculate sample size?\n\nIf you want an easier option, Qualtrics offers an online sample size calculator that can help you determine your ideal survey sample size in seconds. Just put in the confidence level, population size, margin of error, and the perfect sample size is calculated for you.\n\nBest-practice tips for sample size\n\nThere are lots of variables to consider when it comes to generating a specific sample size. That said, there are a few best-practice tips (or rules) to ensure you get the best possible results:\n\n1) Balance cost and confidence level\n\nTo increase confidence level or reduce the margin of error, you have to increase your sample size. Larger sizes almost invariably lead to higher costs. Take the time to consider what results you want from your surveys and what role it plays in your overall campaigns.\n\n2) You don't always need statistically significant results\n\nDepending on your target audience, you may not be able to get enough responses (or a large enough sample size) to achieve \"statistically significant\" results.\n\nIf it's for your own research and not a wider study, it might not be that much of a problem, but remember that any feedback you get from your surveys is important. It might not be statistically significant, but it can aid your activities going forward.\n\nUltimately, you should treat this on a case-by-case basis. Survey samples can still give you valuable answers without having sample sizes that represent the general population.\n\nBut more on this in the section below.\n\n3) Ask open-ended questions\n\nYes and no questions provide certainty, but open-ended questions provide insights you would have otherwise not received. To get the best results, it's worth having a mix of closed and open-ended questions.\n\nFor a deeper dive into survey question types, check out our handbook.\n\nDifferent types of surveys\n\nFrom market research to customer satisfaction, there are plenty of different surveys that you can carry out to get the information you need, corresponding with your sample size.\n\nThe great thing about what we do at Qualtrics is that we offer a comprehensive collection of pre-made, customer, product, employee, and brand survey templates.
