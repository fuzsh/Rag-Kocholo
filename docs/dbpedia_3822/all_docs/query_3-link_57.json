If you win more than one item please wait to be invoiced or request a total before paying as I cannot discount postage once you have paid. Please note if your item is being sent with a Courier it would be helpful if you could add a note when you make your payment to advise of a safe place or a neighbour that your parcel can be left with. Please only bid if you want the item, I will not cancel winning bids for any reason. I will raise a case for non payment with Ebay and block bids from non paying Ebay users. This includes bids made by third parties who you have allowed to access your account, such as your children. POSTAGE I will combine postage where possible on all items, postage is based on total weight, size & value of parcel, in some instances it may not be possible to combine postage due to weight & size limits. If you win more than one item please wait to be invoiced or request a total before paying as I cannot discount postage once you have paid, and your items may still be sent as one parcel. Delivery service used may change from that specified in the listing if combining postage, depending on best cost option, or customer preference. A signature may be required if the value of your item(s) exceeds existing cover offered by the courier used. Postage cost quoted is for mainland UK & Isle Of Wight only (excluding PO Boxes and BFPO's), if you require delivery to a different destination please contact me before bidding as there will be a surcharge or in some cases I may not be able to deliver to your registered address. If your item is being sent with a Courier it would be helpful if you could add a note when you make your payment to advise of a safe place or a neighbour that your parcel can be left with. If you make payment by Paypal I cannot post this item to a different address to that on Paypal as otherwise I will not be covered by Paypal protection 11.6 (c) \"Send to the address on this page. Post the item to the shipping address on the “Transaction Details” page. If the item is delivered in person or if the Payment Recipient posts the item to a different address (for example, if the buyer asks that you send to another address on the basis that it is a “work address” or a “gift” address) then you will not be eligible for re-imbursement under the terms of the programme.\" If tracking information is provided it is your responsibility to check delivery status and be available to receive your item. If your item can be left with a neighbour or in a safe place please add this as a note when you make your payment. If an item is returned because it could not be delivered you will be required to pay for redelivery. Other postage options available, please contact me for a quote Proof of posting is always obtained If your parcel does not arrive I will give a full refund including postage costs once an investigation has been completed by the delivery company used, please be aware this may take several weeks. PAYMENT If paying by cheque or postal order please let me know within 3 days of the end of the listing. If you are paying for more than one item please either request a combined total invoice or wait for me to invoice you as I cannot discount postage once you have paid. Payment within 3 days of listing ending please, or contact me if you can't prior to bidding. Unfortunately we have noticed an increase in people bidding and winning our items and then not paying for them. Therefore if you do not pay within the 3 days or do not contact us then we will raise a case for non payment. This means we are then able to relist the item. If there is a problem with payment please let us know within the 3 days. RETURNS I do not accept returns, cancel active or winning bids, or refund items bought using the Buy It Now option. When you bid or buy an item you are entering a legally binding contract. I will raise a case for non payment with Ebay and block bids from non paying Ebay users. This includes bids made by third parties who you have allowed to access your account, such as your children. I do not offer any guaranties with used items, if they are received in working order and as described and fail when in use I will not accept a return. If you want guaranties I suggest buying your items new from a retailer. I am an honest and fair seller as my feedback shows, 99.9% of buyers are genuine, but it has come to the point of having to state the above to prevent unscrupulous buyers taking advantage of Ebay's returns policy. If an item is not as described in the listing, is damaged in transit, or as stated in the Postage section does not arrive I will issue a full refund including postage costs after any investigations by couriers used are completed, or ask for the item to be returned at my expense for a full refund. Evidence may be required of damage or as proof as item being not as described, such as photos of the damaged item.\n\nCondition: Used\n\nCondition: Condition of the puppet is very good with some minor marks / wear.
