You may reduce future penalties and interest when you set up a payment plan.\n\nRemove or Reduce a Penalty\n\nWe may be able to remove or reduce the penalty if you acted in good faith and can show reasonable cause.\n\nIf you have reasonable cause, and received Notice 972CG, respond within 45 days (60 days if you're a foreign filer) before we assess the penalty. You may have reasonable cause if you:\n\nActed responsibly before and after the failure occurred and\n\nHave significant reasons or the failure resulted from circumstances beyond your control\n\nFor details on reasonable cause for missing and incorrect names or Taxpayer Identification Numbers, see Publication 1586, Reasonable Cause Regulations & Requirements for Missing and Incorrect Name/TINs on Information Returns PDF.\n\nBy law, we cannot remove or reduce interest unless the penalty is removed or reduced.\n\nFor more information, see penalty relief.\n\nDispute a Penalty\n\nIf you disagree with the amount you owe, you may dispute the penalty.\n\nCall us at the toll-free number at the top right corner of your notice or letter or write us a letter stating why we should reconsider the penalty.
