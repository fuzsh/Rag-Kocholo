Technology is here to make it easier for humans to complete all work quickly and efficiently. Technology is also present in the government system in Indonesia. The growth and development of technology in Indonesia provides a great opportunity for the bureaucracy to be able to carry out reforms to deal with bureaucratic weaknesses so far. To make the implementation of the bureaucracy in Indonesia efficient and optimal with the help of technology, the government implements an electronic-based government system, also known as e-government.

This also applies to the implementation of an electronic-based government system. Personal data is something that must be protected because personal data is an identity that a person has. The government, as the organizer of an electronic-based government system, is the party responsible for ensuring the security of data privacy owned by service users. However, until now the Indonesian government has not had a standard standard for protecting personal data for every user of this electronic-based government service.
