        "text": "The Settlers brand has over time gone through several changes, from pure city building to something resembling a traditional real-time strategy. This year the franchise is back with Rise of an Empire, and we got a first look at the game at Ubisoft's Ubidays event in Paris earlier in the year.\n\nWith not long until the game is complete, we caught up with Benedikt Grindel, producer at Blue Byte, the company behind the latest iteration, to find out what the design philosophy has been and how this game differs from the previous ones.\n\nGameSpot UK: Summarise the key philosophy points behind the game.\n\nBenedikt Grindel Settlers has taken various paths in the past, and we really wanted to grab the essence of what people really like about the different games to make one Settlers game that really summarises what the game is about. So people who played any of the previous games will find something in the game that they like.\n\nGSUK: The game sure looks pretty. How important is the visual polish to the game?\n\nBG: I think it's really important because with such a broad audience, many people will say that it has to be an idealistic, extremely good-looking game; there's really no way around it. Also, our approach is to have a believable world. Even if we write down the most believable world, if we can't display it, nobody's going to buy it. It's not the most important thing. The game mechanics will always win in the end if we had to choose, but it's very important.\n\nGSUK: There have been a lot of society-building games released over time, so what's Rise of an Empire's unique selling point?\n\nBG: There are similarities to other games in that it's a building-strategy game, but the key difference when you're playing this game is that Settlers is just a realistic world in which you can play. The whole premise is different [from other games in the genre].\n\nGSUK: The game is focussed around building cities. Can you build more than one?\n\nBG: Basically on one mission, you can build one city. It really revolves around the marketplace and storage, and that's important for us because that's how cities were built. We're really trying to look at realism as much as we can, and cities in the Middle Ages were built around places where people were able to trade, to get stuff, to be protected. This game is not like a mission where you build one city, then build another, and so on.\n\nYes, there are other cities and villages which you support, but you don't have control over them.\n\nGSUK: Explain the dynamic between your city and the other villages.\n\nBG: Basically the villages have their own goals, their own things that they do. Most of the time, they focus on something specific; so they might produce fish, or herbs, or a couple of other things. They're self-contained, but then they have a kind of diplomacy stage, and whether or not they like me. If I've supported them, and we have the same common enemy, then we share fog of war. I can trade with them without going there, even send them money. But if I've annoyed them, they won't trade with me at all; maybe fight with me, so it's important to have a good relationship with them.\n\nGSUK: How do you persuade them to like you?\n\nBG: It depends. Sometimes it's not possible, but usually if they think we're a better partner or we have a rank or reputation, there's a possibility. They will look for honourable partners.\n\nGSUK: Is there a maximum size to the city?\n\nBG: You can build for a long time, but there is a limit to the number of settlers you can have. And that's important, not just for technical reasons but also gameplay reasons. I think the limit for settlers is 200, but then you have the wives. So it's pretty big.\n\nGSUK: What about the passage of time? Are there technological advancements?\n\nBG: There are upgrades you can get, which are linked to the size of your city and your corresponding rank, but there's no new technology over time as such. If you set the story of the game in the real time, it would take place over maybe a year or two, not necessarily any longer.\n\nGSUK: With lots of games, there's a bit of a land rush tendency. Is that a factor in Rise of an Empire or can you build at your leisure?\n\nBG: There are a few campaign maps where time pressure plays a role because that's a gameplay that can have a role. But there are two styles of play viable: the one that focuses on efficiency and the other that focuses on beauty. And you can play both. Time is not an issue that will necessarily help you play the game better.\n\nGSUK: How long do the maps take to play out?\n\nBG: That's tough to say. We're still balancing, but there are plenty of maps that can be completed in less than an hour and some multiplayer maps that will hit around an hour. But you can play a lot longer on each if you wish.\n\nGSUK: How much more is left on the development cycle?\n\nBG: We're just finalising the maps now--a couple of technical issues, some interface things--but game feature-wise, we're basically done.\n\nGSUK: Will Rise of an Empire ship under the Games For Windows banner?\n\nBG: I'm not at liberty to say yes, but I think so. Microsoft has been very eager to convince us that Settlers should be under Games for Windows because they'd like to have such a type of game.\n\nGSUK: Would Settlers be a good title for achievement points?\n\nBG: I really think that the GfW and Windows Live approach is really good, and it shows that Microsoft is really putting the lessons it has learned from Xbox and Xbox Live into practice for what is traditionally its home base, which is the PC. I think this is really cool, and it will help a lot if we have something like a defined standard for PC games because people are getting used to console games.\n\nGSUK: Do you think future Settlers games might be a good candidate for a cross-platform game?\n\nBG: I'm not so sure. I think definitely it will be interesting in the future to try to bring Settlers to new platforms...because especially with new kinds of interface, with like what the Wii does, what the Eye Toy does, getting for a building strategy game something like a strange-shaped pad or interfaceâ€¦I'm brainstorming now, but maybe there could be something like a portal, a window into the Settlers world where I can see my achievements, that kind of thing.\n\nGSUK: Almost like a PlayStation Home environment?\n\nBG: Exactly. In that way...to really link the games with each other. Although I'm not really sure what that would bring. Do we really play the same games on PC and console? I don't know.\n\nGSUK: There are games that have made the leap from PC to console though, Command & Conquer 3, for example?\n\nBG: I think in my mind what the latest EA Xbox versions demonstrate is that it's possible if you have a strong brand to offer it up on a different platform. I don't think it's demonstrated yet that the genre works on the platform. I don't think it would have sold any significant figure if it wasn't for the brand. I'm not convinced about the controls yet. I think that EndWar might be the first to really get it, but I'm not saying that because it's another Ubisoft title."
