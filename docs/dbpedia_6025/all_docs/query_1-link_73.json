        "text": "The Settlers: Rise of an Empire\n\nBy Allen 'Delsyn' Rausch |\n\nThe quest for simplicity has created an unfortunate Settlers game that practically plays itself.\n\nAverage\n\nPros:\n\nBeautiful graphics and animations; Some fun city building; Surprisingly enjoyable multiplayer; Decent if restrictive campaign.\n\nCons:\n\nShallow strategic model; Restricted city design options; Slow gameplay speed; Soldier AI.\n\nThe Settlers is a series with a rather long history. While never more than a cult hit in North America, it's been popular in Europe, especially Germany, for years. The basic premise for the game is a bit different than most other city builders in that the game is less about constructing buildings than managing remarkably complicated logistics. While fans of the series loved it for that very reason, most would agree that the game could have used a bit of streamlining in order to speed up its notoriously slow gameplay. Unfortunately the developers of the latest entry in The Settlers series confused \"simplified\" with \"dumbed down.\" The result is The Settlers: Rise of an Empire, a visually appealing, marginally enjoyable game that's become too simple for its own good.\n\nThe key element of The Settlers has always been a daisy-chained virtual economy. A fisherman in a fishing hut, for example, would catch a fish that would be carried to a miner who needed energy to mine raw copper that would be brought to a smelter to turn it into copper ingots that someone in another building would turn into swords or useful tools. All that has been essentially thrown out for Rise of an Empire. Instead of managing intersecting webs of virtual goods, everything produced in Rise of an Empire is brought to a central storehouse. Virtual citizens then fulfill their various needs by going to the storehouse and taking what they need. A citizen with a dirty house will get a broom and use it. A baker will go to the storehouse to pick up grain to be turned into bread which is then returned to the storehouse for hungry citizens. It's basically Soviet central planning in a computer game.\n\nThe problem with this economic model is that it takes most of the control out of the hands of the player. The storehouse, along with the two other central community buildings (the cathedral and the castle) is automatically placed on every map. Since every other building needs to be placed for maximum distribution efficiency in relation to those three buildings, the result is that absolutely every city ends up being exactly the same -- a medieval-style circular town surrounded by a wall with farms and resource producers on the outside. There's no resource prioritization needed, no sudden shortages that aren't planned for by the climate model or the orderly progression of seasons. Everything important is handled by the invisible commissars in the People's Storehouse, no player input required.\n\nIt will actually take most players a while to realize this because the game offers a tremendous amount of busywork that's fairly enjoyable so long as one ignores the fact that the game is, in large part, playing itself. Players can upgrade houses, for example. This adds more citizens to them, but since this makes production go faster and has citizens use fewer resources (somewhere Chairman Mao is smiling that the Great Leap Forward is finally a success), the only question becomes why you wouldn't upgrade everything as soon as it's viable? The game's campaign, while mildly enjoyable for what it is, is so loaded with linear quests, conditions that must be met and absolute demands from the player's knights and the local citizenry the player ends up feeling less like a king than the scullery boy.\n\nNext: Page 2 >>\n\nPage: 1 2"
