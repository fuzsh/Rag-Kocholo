These new Settlers will have to face many challenges on their journey, from the raiding of ruthless bandits to the discovery of the new culture of these lands.\n\nHardcore Mode: As players will be able to play new scenarios, a wide range of modifiers and conditions will make the AI an even more challenging opponent. Adaptability is key in this new mode that will put the best players to the test, alone or with friends.\n\nSkirmish: Players will be able to experience Solo vs. AI, co-op vs. AI or PvP featuring up to eight players on the 12 maps available at launch.\n\nDeveloped by Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Players can expect a fresh take on the popular The Settlers series, built from the ground up using Ubisoft’s proprietary Snowdrop Engine.\n\nLast edited: November 30, 2022\n\nJoined\n\nOct 1, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n37,612\n\nLocation\n\nSpudlandia\n\nPladio\n\nGuardian of Nonsense\n\nJoined\n\nNovember 13, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n9,232\n\nLocation\n\nManchester, United Kingdom\n\nNovember 30, 2022\n\n#2\n\nI really liked The Settlers series until they became generic AoE clones. I found the whole mechanic of building up your domain with towers really interesting.\n\nIt's a shame they moved away from that. My favourite is The Settlers 3.\n\nJoined\n\nNov 13, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n9,232\n\nLocation\n\nManchester, United Kingdom\n\nCouchpotato\n\nPart-Time News-bot\n\nJoined\n\nOctober 1, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n37,612\n\nLocation\n\nSpudlandia\n\nNovember 30, 2022\n\n#3\n\nI enjoyed The Settlers: Rise of an Empire and The Settlers: Heritage of King the most, but yeah the latest games feel like something is lacking. The new game looks interesting.\n\nJoined\n\nOct 1, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n37,612\n\nLocation\n\nSpudlandia"
