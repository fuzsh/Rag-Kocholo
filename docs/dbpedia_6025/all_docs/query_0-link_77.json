We saw a brief demo at a recent Ubisoft event, showcasing how the game's unit and town detail have been augmented as well as how the gameplay works. There's a story here, penned by the same guy who wrote the tale of Guild Wars: Nightfall. The goal of the game is simple enough: found a town and build it into a bustling city. Eventually you'll get things like churches, city walls, castles, and markets, but starting out you'll have a meager, vulnerable settlement. Working on defenses while you buffer the economy is key, as the game periodically unleashes attackers at your settlements as a progress check.\n\nYou won't even find walls or roads in town when you begin. To get things moving, stone and wood need to be harvested from the countryside using worker citizens. These little guys work autonomously, though you can order them around if you choose. After enough resources are put together you can build another house and get another worker, and eventually you'll see upgrades like wagons and things to speed production. Buildings can be upgraded with additional facilities, all of which will be visible with little animations. Blue Byte repeatedly stressed how much detail they've put into the game, and from what we saw there seems to be quite a bit. Deer, frogs, butterflies and other wildlife hop around the environments, townsfolk have all sorts of animations, and water ripples in the ponds. You'll also see cool effect like water freezing over during the winter, so much so that it becomes traversable.\n\nIt'd be hard for someone to work without food, so it makes sense that keeping your citizens' stomachs full is high priority. There's a whole chain of events with the food cultivation process that needs to be followed to achieve success. After hunter citizens bag deer, the meat gets picked up and taken to storage facilities, which you need to build. A butcher, assuming one's present, will then wander over to storage, retrieve the food, and toss it into the sausage shop, at which point it can be distributed to the populace. You'll know this has worked when a citizen exits the sausage shop carrying a giant link.\n\nSeasons play a role here as well, something you'll need to be especially wary of when it comes to farming. Crops only crow when it's warm, so come winter you'd better have stocked up supply or it's rabbit feet until spring. Dairy farms and cheese shops can also be constructed for additional variety. As your city grows, construction options will expand to include siege engines for defense and clothing stores and other forms of entertainment to keep the populace wrapped in the warm blanket of complacency.\n\nMultiple areas of the world are open for play, and change the mechanics of how a city grows. In Africa, for instance, water is a major issue, particularly when trying to farm. Animal population levels need to be monitored as well. If too many zebras and gazelle are hunted, you might see lions turning to your citizens for dinner, according to Blue Byte. Over the course of the game's 60 missions, you'll get six heroes to help things progress and defend against attackers. In one town assault we witnessed, a successful defense allowed citizens to run out and grab the enemy's siege machinery; apparently an extremely valuable skill as they're expensive to build.\n\nShould a red sign appear over a house, you'll know something's wrong it means the residents have stopped working. Getting them motivated can be a simple matter of cleaning their house, which is accompanied by a set of whimsical animations. One of the best ways to expand a city, aside from keeping denizens working, is to breed, naturally. Attracting women to the city is accomplished by holding festivals in the town square. Expect a higher work output when locals tie the knot and move in together.\n\nIn addition to the single player content, expect to find 1 versus 1 and 2 versus 2 LAN games, with a total of 15 multiplayer modes and a map editor. Skirmish and free-settle maps will also be available along with the campaign mode. Blue Byte is promising a much more streamlined menu system in this version, allowing for easier navigation in-game as well as less hassle when tinkering with the economy. While we have yet to play the latest Settlers, it sure looks pretty. The game's set to ship in September of this year."
