        "meta_description": "The Settlers series has been around since the dawn of time. As much as it's had its share of problems over the years, it's hard not to genuinely care for it in a strange \"I love watching sea monkeys grow\" kind of way. It's almost always had charm along with some decent gameplay features, but never quite managed to put together enough successes to scale that wall of greatness. Settlers has even gone so far as to slide backwards in recent iterations. Happily the latest attempt by Blue Byte, The Settlers: Rise of an Empire, is one of the best so far and definitely better than The Heritage of Kings. It's one of the easiest in the series to get into and has the best visuals the series has ever seen. It's still got some problems with trading, combat, and pacing, but the overall package is pretty decent.",
