1970 - The Kinks' Ray Davies was forced to make a 6,000-mile round trip from New York to London and back again — interrupting the band's American tour — to change one word in a recording of the song, "Lola." In the original recording, Davies had used the brand name "Coca-Cola" in the lyrics, but BBC Radio refused to play the song because singing "Coca-Cola" could be seen as product placement, a violation of the BBC Charter forbidding advertising or sponsored programs. Davies thus changed the name "Coca-Cola" to the generic "cherry cola" for the song's single release, thereby adhering to BBC guidelines.

1972 - Jethro Tull started a two-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. album chart with Thick As A Brick.

The song was later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.

The appearance was later seen by historians as the definitive moment when Clinton captured the support of young voters, and locked the election on charisma points.

1995 - Bryan Adams started a five-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with "Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman." Featured in the Johnny Depp film Don Juan De Marco, it became Adams' third U.S. solo No. 1.
