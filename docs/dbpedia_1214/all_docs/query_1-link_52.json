Kennedy, Jr., Steps Aside for Donald Trump\n\nAs Kennedy’s 2024 election campaign collapses, he has embraced a new role as the former President’s latest ally.\n\nCan Kamala Harris Keep Up the Excitement Through Election Day?\n\nAt the Democratic National Convention, the sense of relief was as overwhelming as the general euphoria—but the campaign against Donald Trump has only just begun.\n\nOpen Questions\n\nWhat Does It Really Mean to Learn?\n\nA leading computer scientist says it’s “educability,” not intelligence, that matters most.\n\nThe Financial Page\n\nThe New Democratic Economic Paradigm\n\nKamala Harris’s messages about price gouging and family welfare show a shift the Party’s intellectual center of gravity.\n\nInfinite Scroll\n\n“Emily in Paris” in the Late Streaming Era\n\nOver four seasons, the Netflix series has hollowed out along with the streaming industry that spawned it.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nThe N.W.S.L.’s New Labor Deal\n\nThe women’s pro soccer league’s collective-bargaining agreement has eliminated the draft. Free agency “was always the players’ power to begin with,” one executive said.\n\nPop Music\n\nMJ Lenderman Keeps It Raw\n\nThe artist discusses resisting the neutering effects of technology, his breakup with a bandmate, and his new album, “Manning Fireworks.”\n\nCritics at Large\n\nTarot, Tech, and Our Age of Magical Thinking\n\nA fascination with mysticism has swept across the culture, cropping up in astrology apps such as Co-Star and shows like “The Curse” and “True Detective.” What does our obsession with predicting the future say about our present?\n\nCulture Desk\n\nThe Plight of the Political Satirist\n\nHow Ruben Bolling, of “Tom the Dancing Bug,” finds the humor in a volatile news cycle.\n\nOn Television\n\nThe State of the Netflix Standup Special\n\nJoe Rogan’s “Burn the Boats,” Matt Rife’s “Lucid,” and Langston Kerman’s “Bad Poetry” showcase vastly different approaches to connecting with the audience.\n\nListening Booth\n\nSabrina Carpenter’s Funny, Feisty “Short n’ Sweet”\n\nThe artist sings with wry, petulant specificity, whether she’s addressing a boyfriend, an ex-boyfriend, or that ex-boyfriend’s new girlfriend.\n\nOn and Off the Menu\n\nBonnie Slotnick, the Downtown Food-History Savant\n\nIn the forty-eight years that she’s lived in the West Village, the owner of the iconic cookbook shop has never ordered delivery.\n\nUsher, the King of R. & B., Comes to Brooklyn\n\nSheldon Pearce on why it is Usher who occupies the sweaty, much contested throne.

Created by Accident?\n\nSeven years after inventing the transformer—the “T” in ChatGPT—the researchers behind it are still grappling with its surprising power.\n\nOur Very Strange Search for “Sea Level”\n\nAs the oceans ebb and surge, staggering ingenuity has gone into inventing the measure. What can it tell us about living on our changeable planet?\n\nThe Trouble with Friends\n\nThe wonder, and the curse, of friendship is choice. Friends drift apart. Commonalities change.

We investigate what happened in the final house the Marines entered that day.\n\nEpisode 6: The Full Picture\n\nStartling new information emerges from deep within the investigation files. Then the In the Dark team gets a big break.\n\nEpisode 7: Innocent in My Eyes\n\nThe conflicting narratives about what happened in Haditha make their way through the opaque inner workings of the military justice system, until they reach a top commander who decides which story to believe.\n\nWhy Was It So Hard for the Democrats to Replace Biden?\n\nAfter the President’s debate with Trump, Democratic politicians felt paralyzed. At the D.N.C., they felt giddy relief. How did they do it?\n\nInfiltrating the Far Right\n\nThe threat from domestic terrorism is rising, but, with Republicans decrying the “deep state,” the F.B.I. is cautious about investigating far-right groups. Vigilantes are leaping into the fray."
