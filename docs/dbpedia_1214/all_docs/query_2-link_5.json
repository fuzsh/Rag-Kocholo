        "text": "You might know it as the song that people sing – or at least try to sing – every year on New Year's Eve.\n\nOnce the clock strikes midnight and the calendar flips to 2022, people around the world will join in a chorus of \"Auld Lang Syne.\" But if you're struggling to remember or even comprehend the lyrics of the tune, you're probably not alone.\n\nThe song was written centuries ago and contains some words we'd normally never use in the U.S. today.\n\nThe lyrics were recorded in a poem by Scottish poet Robert Burns in 1788, though he noted that the song had already been in circulation for years before he put it in writing.\n\nWhile there are various stories about where the song originated, David Hopes, the director of the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum in Alloway, Scotland, previously told the USA TODAY Network in 2014 that Burns adapted an earlier version written down by Scottish poet Allan Ramsay. The museum displays Burns' \"improved\" version next to Ramsay's version, he said.\n\nThe song's rise to fame in North America is likely thanks to Guy Lombardo, whose orchestra played it on his radio and TV shows each New Year's Eve from 1929 to 1977, Hopes said.\n\nCanceled: How New Year's Eve events, Times Square celebration are affected by COVID\n\nWhat does 'Auld Lang Syne' mean?\n\nThe phrase \"auld lang syne\" directly translates from Scots language to modern English as \"old long since,\" but can be interpreted in practice as “old times, especially times fondly remembered” or an “old or long friendship,” according to Dictionary.com.\n\nIf you feel yourself getting a little teary-eyed and sentimental while singing along, it might not just be the champagne. The phrase is meant to evoke feelings of nostalgia, especially to memories of good times spent with friends.\n\nThe first lines of the song – \"Should old acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind?\" – serves as a reminder to cherish those fond memories that we've already had, which makes the message a fit for New Year's Eve night.\n\nThe full, original lyrics to \"Auld Lang Syne\" extend much further than what is normally sung at New Year's Eve parties in the U.S., where just the first verse and the chorus will normally suffice:\n\nShould old acquaintance be forgot,\n\nand never brought to mind?\n\nShould old acquaintance be forgot,\n\nand auld lang syne?\n\nFor auld lang syne, my dear,\n\nfor auld lang syne,\n\nwe'll take a cup of kindness yet,\n\nfor auld lang syne.\n\nContributing: Lori Grisham, USA TODAY"
