        "text": "Once upon a time, everything was alright\n\nI used to feel safe, not a worry in sight\n\nThen I grew up, quickly realized The world is a fucked up place sometimes\n\nDeath is at your door Reaching in from the other side\n\nIt's time to cut the cord\n\nHangin' on like a parasite (Go!)\n\nDon't hesitate, you're hangin' on for your life\n\nDon't hesitate, you're reachin' out for the light\n\nWalking on a razor's edge\n\nMy blood runs black,\n\nI'm not your friend\n\nPull from the depths of the thirty -six chambers (Ah!)\n\npull the trigger\n\nGive a bullet to a stranger\n\nPull from the depths of the thirty -six chambers\n\npull the trigger\n\nGive a bullet to a stranger\n\nI don't wanna die\n\nBut I'm not gonna live\n\nIn a place so cold in a world like this\n\nCrucify me\n\nIt’s blasphemy\n\nThrow me in the fire\n\nLet me burn for eternity\n\nBurn for eternity\n\nBurn for eternity\n\nI will never be the one\n\nThat’ll ever back down\n\nNever turn around and run Never, never, never back down\n\nDeep into the trench of a place unknown\n\nLies a dead man clutched to the bottom of a throne\n\nAt the bottom of a hole that nobody wants to go\n\nIt's the devil that you know that's gotta hold up on your wicked soul\n\nWhen there summin' your mind\n\nand you're thinkin' the devil is makin' the crime\n\nAnd the people are evil\n\nand never no demon designer\n\nThe opposite of a divine? No!\n\nYes!\n\nThe hell is in front of you, side and behind?\n\nI can feel every sign of a human decline\n\nI'm believin' the time is upon us when all of our people are blind!\n\nYo!\n\nRed rain, saw it fallin' from a tower's dead plane\n\nHead bang, Mandalay Bay Hotel on a lead cane\n\nSex change could get you caught up in death's reign\n\nShe played sane but really imitating Ed Gein\n\nHow did we get this way? Negative shit to say when we get this way\n\nHavin' a fit today\n\nSo they wanna make a bitch decay\n\nMy son's mom went gone I was really wrong\n\nI thought I was gone\n\nI vomit so shame for my son\n\nBut I didn't go John Muhammad\n\nSo the devil's right here\n\nOn this level wide tier\n\nThat’s cuz when rebels ready to pop the heavy metal I fear\n\nAbomination, babin' Fakin'\n\nConsecration Hatin' Wastin' education\n\nGot the killer, wanna kill ‘em gotta chase em’\n\nGo!\n\nGo!"
