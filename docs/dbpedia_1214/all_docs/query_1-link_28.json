        "text": "History highlight:\n\nBeabadoobee (real name Beatrice Kristi Ilejay Laus) was born in Iloilo City, Philippines, on June 3, 2000. She is 24. She has lived in London, England, since she was three years old. Her first known song, “Coffee,” was released in 2017, and became a viral TikTok hit in 2020 after it was sampled on Canadian rapper Powfu’s single “Death Bed (Coffee for Your Head).” Subsequent hits include “Last Day on Earth,” “Talk,” and “Glue Song.” Her third full-length album, This Is How Tomorrow Moves, will arrive on August 16.\n\nAlso, today in:\n\n1953 - Elvis Presley graduated from J.C. Hulmes High School in Memphis; his graduation photo shows him to have a split curl in the middle of his forehead, later to become his trademark. Elvis was the first member of his family to graduate high school.\n\n1967 - Aretha Franklin went to No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with her version of the Otis Redding hit \"Respect.\"\n\n1967 - The Doors' \"Light My Fire\" was released in the U.S., where it went on to top the singles chart two months later.\n\n1967 - \"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty delta day,\" as Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge, according to the Bobbie Gentry song, \"Ode To Billie Joe.\"\n\n1970 - The Kinks' Ray Davies was forced to make a 6,000-mile round trip from New York to London and back again — interrupting the band's American tour — to change one word in a recording of the song, \"Lola.\" In the original recording, Davies had used the brand name \"Coca-Cola\" in the lyrics, but BBC Radio refused to play the song because singing \"Coca-Cola\" could be seen as product placement, a violation of the BBC Charter forbidding advertising or sponsored programs. Davies thus changed the name \"Coca-Cola\" to the generic \"cherry cola\" for the song's single release, thereby adhering to BBC guidelines.\n\n1972 - Jethro Tull started a two-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. album chart with Thick As A Brick.\n\n1972 - The Staple Singers' \"I'll Take You There\" hit No. 1 as the group made a successful transition from gospel to secular music. From the album Be Altitude: Respect Yourself, the song features Mavis Staples on lead vocals and music by the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. The song was later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\n1983 - Already undergoing psychiatric treatment and suffering from voices in his head, Derek and the Dominos drummer Jim Gordon took his mother's life in their home. Gordon, who co-wrote the band's biggest hit, \"Layla,\" was sentenced to life in prison.\n\n1989 - Fine Young Cannibals started a seven-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. album chart with The Raw & The Cooked. The album featured the singles \"She Drives Me Crazy\" and \"Good Thing.\"\n\n1992 - Bill Clinton, campaigning for U.S. president, made a stop on The Arsenio Hall Show, where he played the Elvis Presley hit \"Heartbreak Hotel\" on the saxophone. The appearance was later seen by historians as the definitive moment when Clinton captured the support of young voters, and locked the election on charisma points.\n\n1995 - Bryan Adams started a five-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman.\" Featured in the Johnny Depp film Don Juan De Marco, it became Adams' third U.S. solo No. 1.\n\n2002 - Paul McCartney and Aretha Franklin performed at Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee, which celebrated the 50th year of her reign.\n\n2006 - Red Hot Chili Peppers were at No. 1 on the U.K. and U.S. album charts with Stadium Arcadium, the band's ninth studio album.\n\n2008 - Adele performed at The Current for the first time, playing “Right As Rain,” “Hometown Glory,” “Chasing Pavements,” and a cover of Bob Dylan’s “Make You Feel My Love.” Listen to the entire session here.\n\n2011 - American singer-songwriter Andrew Gold died in his sleep, aged 59, from a heart attack. Gold released the 1977 U.S. No. 7 single \"Lonely Boy,\" 1978 U.K. No. 5 single \"Never Let Her Slip Away,\" and — as a member of Wax — the 1987 U.K. No. 12 single \"Bridge To Your Heart.\" His song \"Thank You for Being a Friend\" was used as the opening theme for The Golden Girls.\n\n2014 - The Walkmen frontman Hamilton Leithauser released his solo debut album, Black Hours.\n\n2014 - Parquet Courts released their third studio album, Sunbathing Animal.\n\n2016 - English folk musician and singer-songwriter Dave Swarbrick died, aged 75. His work for the group Fairport Convention from 1969 has been credited with leading them to produce their seminal album Liege & Lief (1969), which initiated the electric folk movement.\n\n2019 - Forbes declares Jay-Z a billionaire, making him the first rapper to hit that mark. ($310 million of his fortune came from his stake in Armand de Brignac champagne.)\n\nBirthdays:\n\nJosephine Baker was born today in 1906.\n\nJimmy Rogers, a bandmate of Muddy Waters, was born today in 1924.\n\nBeat poet Allen Ginsberg, who appeared in the film for Bob Dylan's \"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" was born on this date in 1926.\n\nSaxophonist Boots Randoph (“Yakity Sax”) was born today in 1927.\n\nIan Hunter Patterson (aka Ian Hunter) was born today in 1939, making him 85 today. He is best known as the lead singer of Mott The Hoople, who released the David Bowie-penned song \"All the Young Dudes\" on their 1972 album of the same name. The band's reach wasn't huge, but they had a dedicated fan base, and Hunter embarked on a solo career after the band initially broke up in 1974 (though they did reunite in 2009 and 2013). His best-known solo works are \"Once Bitten, Twice Shy,\" later covered by Great White, and \"Cleveland Rocks,\" which the Presidents of the United States of America covered and licensed as the theme song for The Drew Carey Show.\n\nCurtis Mayfield was born on this day in 1942.\n\nMichael Clarke, the Byrds drummer from 1964-67, was born today in 1946.\n\nDrummer Mickey Finn (T. Rex) was born on this day in 1947.\n\nSuzi Quatro, female rock icon, is 74.\n\nDeniece Williams (“Let’s Hear It for the Boy”) is 74.\n\nDan Hill (“Sometimes When We Touch”) is 70.\n\nSlayer co-lead guitarist Kerry King is 60.\n\nPhish bassist Mike Gordon is 59.\n\nRepublica vocalist Samantha Sprackling, aka Saffron, is 56.\n\nKelly Jones, lead singer for the Stereophonics, is 50.\n\nLyfe Jennings is 46."
