        "text": "Auld Lang Syne\n\nScottish song\n\nAuld Lang Syne, Scottish song with words attributed to the national poet of Scotland, Robert Burns. The composer is not definitely known. In English-speaking countries, the first verse and chorus are now closely associated with the New Year festival.\n\nThe lyrics of “Auld Lang Syne” are in the Scots language. The title, translated literally into standard English, is Old Long Since. The words can be interpreted as since long ago or for old times’ sake. The lyrics are about old friends having a drink and recalling adventures they had long ago. There is no specific reference to the new year.\n\nBurns first wrote down “Auld Lang Syne” in 1788, but the poem did not appear in print until shortly after his death in 1796. It was first published in volume five of James Johnson’s Scots Musical Museum. Burns, a major contributor to the compilation, claimed that the words of “Auld Lang Syne” were taken “from an old man’s singing.” However, the song has been associated with Burns ever since. As published by Johnson, the lyrics were set to a different tune from the one that later became familiar.\n\nPoems with similar words existed before the time of Burns. Sir Robert Ayton, who died in 1638, wrote Old Long Syne, a poem that was first published in 1711 and is sometimes cited as Burns’s inspiration. The Scottish poet Allan Ramsay published a poem in 1720 that begins with the line “Should auld acquaintance be forgot” but is otherwise dissimilar to the Burns poem.\n\nThe melody also existed before Burns wrote down the words. The English composer William Shield used a similar tune in his comic opera Rosina, first performed in 1782. Another version of the same tune was published in 1792 in volume four of the Johnson compilation, but with words entirely different from “Auld Lang Syne.” Not until 1799 did the words and music that are now familiar appear together, in a Scottish song compilation published by George Thomson. In the 19th century the song was reprinted many times, and eventually it became part of the Scottish Hogmanay (New Year’s celebration). Hogmanay celebrants traditionally sing the song while they stand in a circle holding hands.\n\nThe Canadian-born bandleader Guy Lombardo helped make “Auld Lang Syne” a New Year’s Eve tradition in North America. His band, the Royal Canadians, played the song at the turn of the new year in a series of popular radio (and later television) broadcasts that began on December 31, 1929, and continued for more than 30 years.\n\nMany variations of wording can be found in both versions of “Auld Lang Syne” as they have been set down over the years. In fact, surviving manuscript copies in Burns’s own hand are not identically worded.\n\nScots version\n\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot,\n\nAnd never brought to mind?\n\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot,\n\nAnd auld lang syne?\n\n(Chorus)\n\nFor auld lang syne, my jo,\n\nFor auld lang syne,\n\nWe’ll tak a cup o’ kindness yet,\n\nFor auld lang syne.\n\nAnd surely ye’ll be your pint-stowp!\n\nAnd surely I’ll be mine!\n\nAnd we’ll tak a cup o’ kindness yet,\n\nFor auld lang syne.\n\nWe twa hae run about the braes\n\nAnd pu’d the gowans fine;\n\nBut we’ve wander’d mony a weary foot\n\nSin auld lang syne.\n\nWe twa hae paidl’d i’ the burn,\n\nFrae mornin’ sun till dine;\n\nBut seas between us braid hae roar’d\n\nSin auld lang syne.\n\nAnd there’s a hand, my trusty fiere!\n\nAnd gie’s a hand o’ thine!\n\nAnd we’ll tak a right guid willy waught,\n\nFor auld lang syne.\n\nEnglish version\n\nShould old acquaintance be forgot,\n\nAnd never brought to mind?\n\nShould old acquaintance be forgot,\n\nAnd old lang syne?\n\n(Chorus)\n\nFor auld lang syne, my dear,\n\nFor auld lang syne,\n\nWe’ll take a cup of kindness yet,\n\nFor auld lang syne.\n\nAnd surely you’ll buy your pint cup!\n\nAnd surely I’ll buy mine!\n\nAnd we’ll take a cup o’ kindness yet,\n\nFor auld lang syne.\n\nWe two have run about the slopes,\n\nAnd picked the daisies fine;\n\nBut we’ve wandered many a weary foot,\n\nSince auld lang syne.\n\nWe two have paddled in the stream,\n\nFrom morning sun till dine;\n\nBut seas between us broad have roared\n\nSince auld lang syne.\n\nAnd there’s a hand my trusty friend!\n\nAnd give me a hand o’ thine!\n\nAnd we’ll take a right good-will draught,\n\nFor auld lang syne.\n\nRobert Lewis"
