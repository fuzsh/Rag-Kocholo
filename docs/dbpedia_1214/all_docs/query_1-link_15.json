        "text": "\"Rap God\" by Eminem (USA) packs 1,560 words into a fast and furious 6 min 4 sec â that's a tongue-twisting average of 4.28 words per second! In one 15-second segment alone, \"Slim Shady\" spits 97 words (6.46 words per second) at \"supersonic speed\".\n\nExcluding the 26-second intro (spoken by an unknown vocalist) and an indeterminate number of words rapped by Eminem in the intro's background (likely to be 22, all included in the total of 1,560), \"Slim Shady\" actually raps 1,460 words in 5 min 38 sec (4.31 words per second) in the verses/choruses of the track.\n\n\"Rap God\" finds Eminem spitting rhymes about Monica Lewinsky, Dale Earnhardt and a host of fellow rappers including 2Pac, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, Run-DMC, Dr Dre, Rakim, Pharoahe Monch, Fabolous, Ray J and Heavy D & The Boyz. In all, 43 figures from the world of rap/hip-hop are name-checked/referenced by Eminem.\n\nTaken from The Marshall Mathers LP 2, Eminem's eighth studio album, \"Rap God\" debuted at Number 5 on the UK's Official Singles Chart on 26 October 2013, and at Number 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100 on 2 November 2013, as well as charting in numerous other countries around the world. It was the rapper's seventh Top 10 debut on the Hot 100, eclipsing Lil Wayne (six) for the most Top 10 debuts on the Hot 100 (male).\n\n\"Rap God\" also helped Eminem set the record for the most simultaneous Top 20 hits on the US Hot 100 as a lead solo artist. \"The Monster\" (No.3), \"Berzerk\" (No.15), \"Survival\" (No.16) and \"Rap God\" (No.17) were all in the Top 20 on 16 November 2013. Only The Beatles, with six simultaneous Top 20 hits in April-May 1964, can better Eminem's achievement among lead artists. 50 Cent, T-Pain and Lil Wayne have all had four songs in the Top 20 at the same time, but all were featured artists on at least one track.\n\nEminem performed \"Rap God\" at the inaugural YouTube Music Awards in New York City, USA, on 3 November 2013.\n\nMain image via Reuters"
