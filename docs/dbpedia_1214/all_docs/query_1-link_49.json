        "text": "Songs prompts, oh, song prompts.\n\nIf I’m honest, I have mixed feelings. I don’t really do writing by numbers. I get nervous around anything for songwriters that sounds like spoon-feeding. And I think the most important thing a songwriter – well, anyone – can learn is to think for themself.\n\nThat’s why most of the content on the site is about the big, fundamental ideas every songwriter should know about. (Including this article about how to come up with your own song ideas.)\n\nBut, you know, sometimes songwriters feel stuck in a rut. Sometimes songwriters aren’t sure where to begin. Sometimes songwriters need a burst of inspiration to get them back on track.\n\nAnd if that sounds like you, I have some good news: I made you a big list of songs you can write. Specifically, 107 songs you can write.\n\nDo I hate myself for doing it?\n\nMaybe a little.\n\nBut will it help you out if you’re not sure where to go next? If you’re ready for a new challenge or two? If you’re looking for some new inspiration in your life?\n\nOf course.\n\nSo we’re good.\n\nIf you’re new to the site I recommend you read my article on how songs tell stories, and how a song’s style, idea and hook work together before you do anything else. They’ll help you get the most out of the song prompts I’m about to share with you.\n\nOtherwise, have a browse. See which song prompts inspire you. Go write some songs, live your dream, change the world.\n\nAnd remember: these ideas aren’t gospel. You can use the song prompts as is. You can make changes to the song prompts. You can ignore the song prompts entirely and go where your curiosity takes you. Do what’s right for you, compadre. Life is yours for the taking.\n\n[ THE 107 SONG PROMPTS ]\n\nLove Songs\n\nWrite a love song.
