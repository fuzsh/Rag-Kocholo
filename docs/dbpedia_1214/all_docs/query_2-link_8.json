Others think it might have a hint of country or be a little bit punk. We will just have to see what Swift comes up with on April 19 and if she deviates from a more traditional pop album.\n\nWhat does LOML mean?\n\n\"loml\" is listed as one of the tracks on Taylor Swift's album \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" LOML is typically used as an acronym for \"love of my life.\" However, some fans theorize that it could also mean \"loss of my life\" or \"loss of my love\" and in true Taylor fashion, it's important to expect the unexpected.\n\n'Tortured Poets Department' vinyl\n\nSwift released four vinyl variants of \"The Tortured Poets Department\" each one with a different bonus track. These include: \"The Manuscript,\" \"The Bolter,\" \"The Albatross\" and \"The Black Dog.\"\n\nThe only version still available on her site is the one with \"The Manuscript,\" the others were listed as special editions. They are available as exclusive CDs through Target.\n\nSource: Arizona Republic."
