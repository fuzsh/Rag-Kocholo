It was released by E.G. Records in July 1984 as a 7-inch and 12-inch single. The B-side to the 7\" release was a remix of the song, named \"Dance Day\". The single reached No. 51 in the UK Singles Chart.[1][2] A promotional video was filmed for the song, the first time the band made a video for a non-album single.\n\nThe song was later included on the 2008 reissue of Night Time. \"Dance Day\" was later included on the compilation \"Wilful Days\" (mistakenly titled \"A New Day\").\n\nTrack listings\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 7-inch single featured \"Dance Day\" as the B-side. The 12\" single featured a dub mix of \"A New Day\" as its A-side and the original track as the B-side. A 7\" release in Portugal used a shorter edit of \"A New Day\" instead.[3]\n\n7\" vinyl single\n\n[edit]\n\nSide A\n\n\"A New Day\" – 04:08\n\nSide B\n\n\"Dance Day\" – 03:40\n\n12\" vinyl single\n\n[edit]\n\nSide A\n\n\"A New Day (Dub Mix)\" – 04:20\n\nSide B\n\n\"A New Day\" – 04:08\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Chart Peak\n\nPosition 1984 UK Singles Chart[1] 56\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
