        "text": "Hi @Kettle,\n\nThanks for posting in the Spotify Community, and welcome!\n\nUnfortunately, at the moment there isn’t a way to check the genres that Spotify classifies songs into via the Spotify app itself. However, there’s currently a Live Idea for showing the genres of songs on Spotify.\n\nIf it’s something you’re interested in, I would recommend adding your +VOTE to the idea; the more votes an idea gets, the likelier it is that Spotify will implement it, and you can read more about how feedback on ideas reaches Spotify here.\n\nYou can also feel free to Subscribe to the idea by clicking the three dots next to its title; that way you can be sure to be informed of any relevant updates.\n\nIn the meantime, I'd recommend searching for music releases on websites that include genre information, such as Rate Your Music (my personal favorite resource for genre info), Discogs, and Last.fm, to see which genres they classify the music into. I think that Last.fm (which has user-generated genre info), is also nice because it shows this genre info (“tags”) for individual songs.\n\nIf the artist has a Bandcamp page, you can also check the genre tags at the bottom of the webpage for an individual track on one of their releases, to see which genres the artist considers their song to represent.\n\nThere’s also a third-party app for Spotify (mentioned in this related thread) that you might be interested in trying, http://organizeyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com, which shows you the genres that Spotify classifies individual songs into. You can log in with your Spotify account, and choose to see genre info either for all the songs in your entire Spotify library, or from certain playlists in your library.\n\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nHave a good day!"
