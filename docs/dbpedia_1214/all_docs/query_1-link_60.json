Before this we either had to call the radio or go to the record store to hum the tunes we liked in the with the faint hope someone would recognise it. So many amazing songs I only got to hear for a second time and only knew the names of because of this app. Great for when you hear songs you like on movies or tv shows, at parties or in the club, on the radio etc etc. I have discovered so many new bands that I love but never would of knew existed without Shazam, more than I ever discovered through paying for and reading music magazines. If you donât already know what Shazam is, Iâm 100% sure you will have already wished for the existence of such a service at some point. If you love music as much as I do, you really do need this AND ITâS ALL FREE!"
