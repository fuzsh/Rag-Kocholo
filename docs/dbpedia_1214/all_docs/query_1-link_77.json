        "text": "Is there a difference between onto and on to? Does the space change the meaning? And when should one be used instead of the other?\n\nIn this article, we will explain the difference between onto and on to, explore when and how they are typically used, and provide example sentences that show them in use.\n\nWhen to use onto or on to\n\nThe single word onto is most commonly used as a preposition that can mean “on,” “upon,” or “to a position on.”\n\nThe separate words on and to often appear alongside each other in sentences that use idiomatic phrasal verbs or infinitives. In these cases, you’ll need to use the entire context of the sentence to determine what exactly is being said.\n\nFor example:\n\nAfter we finished learning multiplication tables, we moved on to long division. (Here, move on is an idiomatic phrasal verb meaning “to start doing or discussing something new.”)\n\nThe story doesn’t end here—you must read on to find out how it ends. (Here, read on is an idiomatic phrasal verb meaning “to continue reading.”)\n\nSometimes, onto and on to can be used interchangeably, especially in cases when a phrasal verb is being used but the meaning of onto is appropriate. For example, these sentences have the same meaning and are both considered acceptable:\n\nI logged onto my computer.\n\nI logged on to my computer.\n\nHowever, you need to be careful not to accidentally use onto when you are using a phrasal verb ending with on alongside the word to in cases when onto is not what’s meant (such as when to is used after the phrasal verb to indicate a direction or a receiver of an action).\n\nFor example:\n\nOnce you pass over the stream, continue on to the large boulder and then you’ll see the main trail.\n\nOnce you pass over the stream, continue onto the large boulder and then you’ll see the main trail.\n\nThe first sentence can be interpreted as to continue until you get to the large boulder, whereas the second sentence seems like it means to actually get onto (on top of) the boulder to be able to see the trail.\n\nThere is an easy way to tell if you should use onto or on to. The word onto is a synonym of the words on and upon. If it makes sense to swap on or upon into your sentence, then onto is likely the correct choice. For example, the sentence He placed the book onto the shelf still makes sense if you replace onto with on or upon. However, the change won’t work in the sentence He moved on to the next math problem, which means on to is the correct choice.\n\nOnto is not the only preposition that can cause this kind of confusion. Check our guide to into vs. in to.\n\nExamples of onto and on to used in a sentence\n\nLet’s continue on to some example sentences that show how onto and on to are commonly used."
