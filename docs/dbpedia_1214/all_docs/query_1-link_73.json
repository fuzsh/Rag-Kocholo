Du Bois has been a part of my intellectual life for as long as I can remember. At 16, I moved to Great Barrington, Mass., to attend Bard College at Simon’s Rock. Great Barrington was the birthplace of Du Bois, and as I learned when I was named a Du Bois scholar, the great man was so many things: an elder statesman of African American life, a distinguished historian, a sociologist, a civil-rights leader and an early model of what it might mean to be a public intellectual. He is, many would argue, the founding father of modern Black America. His writing, his ambitions, his failings and his accomplishments are the bass line of Honorée Fanonne Jeffers’s sweeping, masterly debut novel, “The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois.”\n\nJeffers’s book is an ambitious work set with the fine china of the oeuvre of Du Bois, a man whose life and work pulsated with questions about the inheritance of Black American history and what one does with that fraught and complex legacy. In Great Barrington, Du Bois was born into a community of free Black landowners whose heritage included African, Dutch and French ancestry. Ancestry looms large in “Love Songs,” and Jeffers has deftly crafted a tale of a family whose heritage includes free Blacks, enslaved peoples and Scottish and other white colonialists.\n\nThe title “The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois” brings to mind, of course, the T. S. Eliot poem “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.” Jeffers is an award-winning poet, and she is never doing just one thing with her text; by pluralizing “song” in this play on Eliot — not just a love song, but love songs — she tips her hat to the double consciousness of Black Americans that Du Bois so famously wrote about and that Jeffers’s characters also see the world through.\n\nDu Bois’s reflections on Black American life in the South are a through line in his work, and Jeffers uses passages of his writing as interludes, including this from “The Souls of Black Folk”:\n\n“Out of the North the train thundered, and we woke to see the crimson soil of Georgia stretching away bare and monotonous right and left. Here and there lay straggling, unlovely villages, and lean men loafed leisurely at the depots; then again came the stretch of pines and clay. Yet we did not nod, nor weary of the scene; for this is historic ground.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
