        "text": "Sleep like a baby? Ha! As parents know all too well, babies — and little ones in general — aren’t always good at getting (and staying) asleep. But an old-fashioned remedy can help: the lullaby.\n\nThere’s a reason parents have turned to lullabies for centuries — they work. And there’s science to back that up. Incorporating soothing songs into your little one’s bedtime routine may result in better sleep for babies (and an improved “maternal mood,” too), according to one study.\n\nNearly any song — regardless of lyrics and melody — can be re-imagined as a lullaby. Still, some songs seem to particularly lend themselves to sending baby off to dreamland.\n\nHere are some of our favorite lullabies for babies — a mix of popular, modern-day hits and songs sung for centuries by parents eager for their little ones to get some shut-eye.\n\n1. \"Rock-a-Bye Baby\"\n\nThis classic nursery rhyme is believed to date back to 18th-century England (though it may have originated in America). Theories abound as to the meaning of the mysterious (and ominous!) lyrics, which have changed a bit over time. And while the notion of a falling cradle may not seem very restful, this melody has lulled babies to sleep and weathered the test of time. Listen to “Rock-a-Bye Baby.”\n\n“Rock-a-Bye Baby” Lyrics\n\nRock-a-bye baby\n\nOn the tree tops,\n\nWhen the wind blows\n\nThe cradle will rock.\n\nWhen the bough breaks\n\nThe cradle will fall,\n\nAnd down will come baby\n\nCradle and all.\n\n2. \"Good Night\"\n\nThis classic Beatles song (written by John Lennon for his son Julian) is peaceful and soothing. Tender lyrics (like “now the sun turns out his light” and “dream sweet dreams for me”) are perfect for parents to sing to little ones.\n\nThink of \"Good Night\" as an audio take on the classic bedtime story Goodnight Moon. (And if you love the Beatles, there are plenty of other songs — such as “I’m Only Sleeping,” “Golden Slumbers” and “Blackbird” — that double as sleepy-time songs. ) Hear Ringo Starr sing “Good Night.”\n\n“Good Night” Lyrics\n\nNow it's time to say good night,\n\nGood night, sleep tight.\n\nNow the sun turns out his light,\n\nGood night, sleep tight.\n\nDream sweet dreams for me,\n\nDream sweet dreams for you.\n\nClose your eyes and I'll close mine,\n\nGood night, sleep tight.\n\nNow the moon begins to shine,\n\nGood night, sleep tight.\n\nDream sweet dreams for me,\n\nDream sweet dreams for you.\n\nClose your eyes and I'll close mine,\n\nGood night, sleep tight.\n\nNow the sun turns out his light,\n\nGood night, sleep tight.\n\nDream sweet dreams for me,\n\nDream sweet dreams for you.\n\nGood night,\n\nGood night, everybody,\n\nEverybody, everywhere,\n\nGood night.\n\n3. \"Brahms’ Lullaby\" (also known as “The Cradle Song”)\n\nThe name doesn’t lend a clue as to the melody or lyrics, but you likely will be able to hum along when you hear this classic song from German composer Johannes Brahms. Different variations of the lyrics — originally in German — accompany different versions of the song, but all are full of comfort. Listen to Dean Martin croon “The Cradle Song.”\n\n“Cradle Song” Lyrics\n\nLullaby and good night,\n\nWith roses bedight.\n\nCreep into thy bed,\n\nThere pillow thy head.\n\nIf God will thou shalt wake,\n\nWhen the morning doth break.\n\nIf God will thou shalt wake,\n\nWhen the morning doth break.\n\nLullaby and good night,\n\nThose blue eyes close tight.\n\nBright angels are near,\n\nSo sleep without fear.\n\nThey will guard thee from harm,\n\nWith fair dreamland's sweet charm.\n\nThey will guard thee from harm,\n\nWith fair dreamland's sweet charm.\n\n4. \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\"\n\nThe lyrics to this classic — heard in day cares around the country — come from a poem by Jane Taylor that was written in 1806. With its images of stars and the night sky, along with the disappearing sun, this song is the perfect way to evoke sleep. Listen to this version of the lullaby by Jewel.\n\n“Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” Lyrics\n\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star,\n\nHow I wonder what you are!\n\nUp above the world so high,\n\nLike a diamond in the sky.\n\nWhen the blazing sun is gone,\n\nWhen he nothing shines upon,\n\nThen you show your little light,\n\nTwinkle, twinkle, all the night.\n\nThen the traveler in the dark\n\nThanks you for your tiny spark,\n\nHow could he see where to go,\n\nIf you did not twinkle so?\n\nIn the dark blue sky you keep,\n\nOften through my curtains peep.\n\nFor you never shut your eye,\n\nTill the sun is in the sky.\n\nAs your bright and tiny spark\n\nLights the traveler in the dark,\n\nThough I know not what you are,\n\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star.\n\n5. \"Amazing Grace\"\n\nThis classic hymn, especially as sung by the incomparable Etta James, is deeply emotional and stirring. And although as the lyrics mention, there are moments of “dangers, toils and snares,” the overall spirit and arc of the song is uplifting. Plus, parents may appreciate that the song is easy to hum and sing. Listen to Etta James in a live performance of “Amazing Grace.”\n\n“Amazing Grace” Lyrics\n\nAmazing grace, how sweet the sound\n\nThat saved a wretch like me\n\nI once was lost, but now am found\n\nWas blind, but now I see\n\nWas grace that taught my heart to fear\n\nAnd grace, my fears relieved\n\nHow precious did that grace appear\n\nThe hour I first believed\n\nThrough many dangers, toils and snares\n\nWe have already come\n\nT'was grace that brought us safe thus far\n\nAnd grace will lead us home\n\nAnd grace will lead us home\n\nAmazing grace, how sweet the sound\n\nThat saved a wretch like me\n\nI once was lost, but now am found\n\nWas blind, but now I see\n\nWas blind, but now I see\n\n6. \"Goodnight Sweetheart Goodnight\"\n\nYou don’t have to do a full doo-wop performance (à la the classic scene from Three Men and a Baby) to benefit from the restful tones of this song by The Spaniels. Sure, it may be about a late night and bidding farewell to a date, but these lyrics — and the slow, easy-to-sing pacing — lend themselves to sleepy time with babies. Listen to the full song.\n\n“Goodnight Sweetheart Goodnight” Lyrics\n\nGoodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,\n\nGoodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,\n\nI hate to leave you, but I really must say,\n\nGoodnight, sweetheart, goodnight.\n\nGoodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,\n\nGoodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,\n\nI hate to leave you, but I really must say,\n\nGoodnight, sweetheart, goodnight.\n\nWell, it's three o'clock in the morning,\n\nBaby, I just can't treat you right.\n\nWell, I hate to leave you, baby,\n\nDon't mean maybe, because I love you so.\n\nGoodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,\n\nI hate to leave you, but I really must say,\n\nGoodnight, sweetheart, goodnight.\n\nGoodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,\n\nGoodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,\n\nI hate to leave you, but I really must say,\n\nGoodnight, sweetheart, goodnight.\n\nNow, my mother and my father,\n\nMight hear if I stay here too long.\n\nOne kiss and we'll part,\n\nAnd you'll be going,\n\nYou know I hate to see you go.\n\n7. \"Frère Jacques\" (or \"Brother John\")\n\nYou can sing this classic French lullaby — about a friar who oversleeps — in either English or French. Your choice! Either way, the repetition at the end of the song (“ding, dang, dong”) is curiously restful. Listen to the chimes in “Frère Jacques.\"\n\n“Frère Jacque” Lyrics\n\nFrère Jacques, Frère Jacques,\n\nDormez-vous? Dormez-vous?\n\nSonnez les matines! Sonnez les matines!\n\nDing, dang, dong. Ding, dang, dong.\n\n“Brother John” Lyrics\n\nAre you sleeping? Are you sleeping?\n\nBrother John, Brother John,\n\nMorning bells are ringing! Morning bells are ringing!\n\nDing, dang, dong. Ding, dang, dong.\n\n8. “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot”\n\nThe deeply hope-filled chorus of this African American spiritual song is likely quite familiar. People have sung “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” since the late 1800s, and while its exact origins are unknown (and it has at times stirred up some controversy), the song’s power and popularity are certain. Parents can sing the whole song, or simply repeat the chorus, until babies drift off to dreamland. Hear the Plantation Singers' a capella rendition of \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.\"\n\n“Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” Lyrics\n\nSwing low, sweet chariot\n\nComing for to carry me home\n\nSwing low, sweet chariot\n\nComing for to carry me home\n\nI looked over Jordan and what did I see\n\nComing for to carry me home\n\nA band of angels coming after me\n\nComing for to carry me home\n\nSwing low, sweet chariot\n\nComing for to carry me home\n\nSwing low, sweet chariot\n\nComing for to carry me home\n\nIf you get there before I do\n\nComing for to carry me home\n\nTell all my friends I'm coming too\n\nComing for to carry me home\n\nSwing low, sweet chariot\n\nComing for to carry me home\n\nSwing low, sweet chariot\n\nComing for to carry me home\n\n9. \"Star Light, Star Bright\"\n\nSing this classic tune to lull your baby to sleep. You can point out the stars in the night sky as you sing. The simple lyrics make it easy to remember. Listen along to the melody here.\n\n“Star Light, Star Bright” Lyrics\n\nStar light, star bright,\n\nThe first star I see tonight;\n\nI wish I may, I wish I might,\n\nHave the wish I wish tonight.\n\n10. “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”\n\nAs parents croon this hit song from The Wizard of Oz, they may wish that their babies will be able to discover this wonderful land where dreams come true. Listen to Judy Garland sing “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.”\n\n“Somewhere Over the Rainbow” Lyrics\n\nSomewhere over the rainbow\n\nWay up high\n\nThere's a land that I heard of\n\nOnce in a lullaby\n\nSomewhere over the rainbow\n\nSkies are blue\n\nAnd the dreams that you dare to dream\n\nReally do come true\n\nSomeday I'll wish upon a star\n\nAnd wake up where the clouds are far\n\nBehind me\n\nWhere troubles melt like lemon drops\n\nAway above the chimney tops\n\nThat's where you'll find me\n\nSomewhere over the rainbow\n\nBluebirds fly\n\nBirds fly over the rainbow\n\nWhy then, oh why can't I?\n\nIf happy little bluebirds fly\n\nBeyond the rainbow\n\nWhy, oh why can't I?\n\n11. \"Lullaby (Goodnight, My Angel)\"\n\nFull of love and tender lyrics, Billy Joel’s lullaby contribution is a touching song to his daughter. It’s full of calming words (“I will never be far away”) and love (“you’ll always be a part of me”). Although you’ll hear this song at both weddings and funerals, it is a lullaby first and foremost. Listen to Billy Joel sing “Lullaby (Goodnight, My Angel)” from his River of Dreams album.\n\n“Lullaby (Goodnight, My Angel)” Lyrics\n\nGoodnight, my angel, time to close your eyes,\n\nAnd save these questions for another day.\n\nI think I know what you've been asking me,\n\nI think you know what I've been trying to say.\n\nI promised I would never leave you,\n\nThen you should always know,\n\nWherever you may go, no matter where you are,\n\nI never will be far away.\n\nGoodnight, my angel, now it's time to sleep,\n\nAnd still so many things I want to say.\n\nRemember all the songs you sang for me,\n\nWhen we went sailing on an emerald bay.\n\nAnd like a boat out on the ocean,\n\nI'm rocking you to sleep.\n\nThe water's dark and deep, inside this ancient heart,\n\nYou'll always be a part of me.\n\nGoodnight, my angel, now it's time to dream,\n\nAnd dream how wonderful your life will be.\n\nSomeday your child may cry, and if you sing this lullaby,\n\nThen in your heart there will always be a part of me.\n\nSomeday we'll all be gone,\n\nBut lullabies go on and on,\n\nThey never die,\n\nThat's how you and I will be.\n\n12. \"All the Pretty Little Horses\"\n\nThe exact origins of this song — also referred to as “Hush-a-Bye” — are unknown, and you’ll see variation in the lyrics depending on the singer. Universally, though, the notion of better things when you awake remains constant in all variations. Listen to this soothing lullaby.\n\n“All the Pretty Horses” Lyrics\n\nHush-a-bye, don't you cry.\n\nGo to sleepy little baby.\n\nWhen you wake, you shall have\n\nAll the pretty little horses.\n\nBlack and bays, dapples and grays,\n\nCoach and six-a-little horses.\n\nHush-a-bye, don't you cry.\n\nGo to sleepy little baby.\n\nHush-a-bye, don't you cry.\n\nGo to sleepy little baby.\n\nWhen you wake you shall have,\n\nAll the pretty little horses.\n\nBlack and bays, dapples and grays,\n\nCoach and six-a-little horses.\n\nHush-a-bye, don't you cry.\n\nGo to sleepy little baby.\n\n13. \"You Are My Sunshine\"\n\nWritten in the late 1930s by Jimmie Davis and Charles Mitchell, these sweet (perhaps even bittersweet) lyrics have been sung by many artists, including the Beach Boys, Johnny Cash, Bing Crosby and Aretha Franklin. Davis used to sing the song (while seated atop Sunshine, his horse) during his successful campaign for governor of Louisiana. Stick to the chorus for a more upbeat experience. Listen to the lullaby version of “You Are My Sunshine.”\n\n“You Are My Sunshine” Lyrics\n\nYou are my sunshine, my only sunshine,\n\nYou make me happy when skies are grey.\n\nYou’ll never know, dear, how much I love you,\n\nPlease don't take my sunshine away.\n\nThe other night, dear, as I lay sleeping,\n\nI dreamt I held you in my arms.\n\nWhen I awoke, dear, I was mistaken,\n\nSo I hung my head, and I cried.\n\nYou are my sunshine, my only sunshine,\n\nYou make me happy when skies are grey.\n\nYou’ll never know, dear, how much I love you,\n\nPlease don't take my sunshine away.\n\nI'll always love you and make you happy,\n\nIf you will only say the same.\n\nBut if you leave me to love another,\n\nYou'll regret it all one day.\n\nYou are my sunshine, my only sunshine,\n\nYou make me happy when skies are grey.\n\nYou’ll never know, dear, how much I love you,\n\nPlease don't take my sunshine away.\n\nPlease don't take my sunshine away.\n\n14. \"Hush Little Baby\"\n\nThis song channels what moms and dads might be thinking as the witching hour approaches. Not much is known about the origins of this relatable song, which is full of sweet promises and parental love. Tip: Just switch “Papa” to “Mama” in the lyrics as needed. Give this classic, sung for generations, a listen.\n\n“Hush Little Baby” Lyrics\n\nHush, little baby, don't say a word,\n\nPapa's gonna buy you a mockingbird.\n\nAnd if that mockingbird won't sing,\n\nPapa's gonna buy you a diamond ring.\n\nAnd if that diamond ring turns to brass,\n\nPapa's gonna buy you a looking glass.\n\nAnd if that looking glass gets broke,\n\nPapa's gonna buy you a billy goat.\n\nAnd if that billy goat won't pull,\n\nPapa's gonna buy you a cart and bull.\n\nAnd if that cart and bull turn over,\n\nPapa's gonna buy you a dog named Rover.\n\nAnd if that dog named Rover won't bark,\n\nPapa's gonna buy you a horse and cart.\n\nAnd if that horse and cart fall down,\n\nYou'll still be the sweetest little baby in town!\n\n15. “Row, Row, Row Your Boat”\n\nThis is a classic nursery rhyme that parents can croon to their babies before naps and at bedtime. The four-line song can be repeated for four rounds. Often, though, you’ll hear variations on the lyrics.\n\nFor instance, the lines “If you see a crocodile, don’t forget to scream” can be subbed in for the “merrily, merrily” repetition. For more lively moments with your baby, using this version — and maybe giving a small scream, to illustrate the point — is bound to result in smiles and giggles. Listen to “Row, Row, Row Your Boat.”\n\n“Row, Row, Row Your Boat” Lyrics\n\nRow, row, row your boat\n\nGently down the stream\n\nMerrily, merrily, merrily, merrily\n\nLife is but a dream\n\n(repeat four times)\n\n16. \"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes\"\n\nThis classic Disney song from the movie Cinderella plays on the double meaning of the word dream — yes, it’s what happens when you sleep, but dreams are also an expression of hopes for the future.\n\nParents can have both those meanings in mind as they sing these sweet, tender lyrics to whisk their baby off to slumber. Hear the Disney song.\n\n“A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes” Lyrics\n\nA dream is a wish your heart makes\n\nWhen you're fast asleep\n\nIn dreams you will lose your heartaches\n\nWhatever you wish for, you keep\n\nHave faith in your dreams, and someday\n\nYour rainbow will come smiling through\n\nNo matter how your heart is grieving\n\nIf you keep on believing\n\nThe dream that you wish will come true\n\nA dream is a wish your heart makes\n\nWhen you're fast asleep\n\nIn dreams you will lose your heartaches\n\nWhatever you wish for, you keep\n\nHave faith in your dreams, and someday\n\nYour rainbow will come smiling through\n\nNo matter how your heart is grieving\n\nIf you keep on believing\n\nThe dream that you wish will come true\n\n17. “Isn’t She Lovely”\n\nGot a daughter? Share this Stevie Wonder song, which is an ode to his own daughter, Aisha. The collection of adjectives describing Aisha just after her birth — lovely, wonderful, precious — will likely feel familiar to any new mom or dad. Listen to Stevie Wonder sing his lullaby.\n\n“Isn’t She Lovely” Lyrics\n\nIsn't she lovely?\n\nIsn't she wonderful?\n\nIsn't she precious?\n\nLess than one minute old\n\nI never thought through love we'd be\n\nMaking one as lovely as she\n\nBut isn't she lovely made from love?\n\nIsn't she pretty?\n\nTruly the angel's best\n\nBoy, I'm so happy\n\nWe have been heaven-blessed\n\nI can't believe what God has done\n\nThrough us He's given life to one\n\nBut isn't she lovely made from love?\n\nIsn't she lovely?\n\nLife and love are the same\n\nLife is Aisha,\n\nThe meaning of her name\n\nLondie, it could have not been done\n\nWithout you who conceived the one\n\nThat's so very lovely, made from love, hey!\n\n18. “Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)”\n\nWhile parents of daughters can sing Stevie Wonder's touching lyrics, parents of sons can turn to John Lennon for their nightly lullaby. His song for his son Sean is an embrace of fatherhood (but moms can also easily sing this song by substituting “Mommy” for “Daddy” in the first verse). The song is infused with messages of hope and comfort. Listen to John Lennon’s sweet lullaby to his son, which ends with a whispered “good night.”\n\n“Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)” Lyrics\n\nClose your eyes\n\nHave no fear\n\nThe monster's gone\n\nHe's on the run and your daddy's here\n\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful\n\nBeautiful boy\n\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful\n\nBeautiful boy\n\nBefore you go to sleep\n\nSay a little prayer\n\nEvery day in every way, it's getting better and better\n\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful\n\nBeautiful boy\n\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful\n\nBeautiful boy\n\nOut on the ocean sailing away\n\nI can hardly wait\n\nTo see you come of age\n\nBut I guess we'll both just have to be patient\n\n'Cause it's a long way to go\n\nA hard row to hoe\n\nYes, it's a long way to go\n\nBut in the meantime\n\nBefore you cross the street\n\nTake my hand\n\nLife is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans\n\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful\n\nBeautiful boy\n\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful\n\nBeautiful boy\n\nBefore you go to sleep\n\nSay a little prayer\n\nEvery day in every way, it's getting better and better\n\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful\n\nBeautiful boy\n\nDarling, darling, darling\n\nDarling Sean\n\n19. “Didn’t Leave Nobody but the Baby”\n\nWhile it harkens back to an old lullaby, you’re most likely to be familiar with the song \"Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby\" from the soundtrack to the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou?, performed by Emmylou Harris, Gillian Welch and Alison Krauss.\n\nListen closely to the lyrics, and you’ll find them mournful and dark, in the style of old-fashioned fairy tales. But parents crooning this aloud late at night will appreciate the ample repetition of the line “Go to sleep, you little baby.” Listen to the trio sing this updated lullaby live.\n\n“Didn’t Leave Nobody but the Baby” Lyrics\n\nGo to sleep, you little baby\n\n(Go to sleep, you little babe)\n\nGo to sleep, you little baby\n\n(Go to sleep, you little babe)\n\nYour mama's gone away and your daddy's gonna stay\n\nDidn't leave nobody but the baby\n\nGo to sleep, you little baby\n\n(Go to sleep, you little babe)\n\nGo to sleep, you little baby\n\n(Go to sleep, you little babe)\n\nEverybody's gone in the cotton and the corn\n\nDidn't leave nobody but the baby\n\nYou're a sweet little baby\n\n(You're a sweet little babe)\n\nYou're a sweet little baby\n\n(You're a sweet little babe)\n\nHoney in the rock and the sugar don't stop\n\nGonna bring a bottle to the baby\n\nDon't you weep, pretty baby\n\n(Don't you weep, pretty babe)\n\nDon't you weep, pretty baby\n\n(Don't you weep, pretty babe)\n\nShe's long gone with her red shoes on\n\nGonna need another lovin' baby\n\n20. “Stay Awake”\n\nParents, get ready to use some sophisticated reverse psychology with this ditty from Mary Poppins. Every line in the song urges little ones to resist sleep: \"don’t lie down,\" \"don’t rest your head,\" \"don’t close your eyes.\" But if you’ve seen the movie, you know that yawns overtake the children, and by the end of the song, it’s off to slumber. Listen to Julie Andrews croon this sleepy lullaby.\n\n“Stay Awake” Lyrics\n\nStay awake, don't rest your head\n\nDon't lie down upon your bed\n\nWhile the moon drifts in the skies\n\nStay awake, don't close your eyes\n\nThough the world is fast asleep\n\nThough your pillow soft and deep\n\nYou're not sleepy as you seem\n\nStay awake, don't nod and dream\n\nStay awake, don't nod and dream"
