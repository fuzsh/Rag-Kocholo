        "text": "Taylor Swift’s new album, The Tortured Poets Department, is officially here, and news/theories/Easter eggs have been breaking faster than you can scream HER MIND at random members of your family who are beseeching you to calm down. Here is literally everything we know about the album so far, and yes: We will be updating this as more intel breaks (because, again, Tay's MIND).\n\nThe Release Date Is April 19 (aka TODAY!!!), and It Is...Significant\n\nTaylor confirmed the release date while collecting her 13th Grammy Award, saying, “My brand-new album comes out April 19. It’s called The Tortured Poets Department. I’m gonna go and post the cover right now backstage.”\n\nThe April 19 release date has multiple reference points and appears to be connected to Taylor’s ex Joe Alwyn due to it being the day Taylor went to dinner with Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds and they proceeded to unfollow him.\n\nApril 19 is also considered the date the American Revolution began (reminder that Taylor, erm, Miss Americana, and Joe spent time together in England and one of her tracks is “So Long, London”) as well as “Poetry and the Creative Mind Day.”\n\nThe Album Title Might Be a Reference to Joe Alwyn’s Group Chat\n\nIt took Swifties literally five minutes to realize The Tortured Poets Department could be a reference to Joe Alwyn’s WhatsApp group with Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott called “The Tortured Man Club.” Unconfirmed, but lol if true.\n\nOur First Glimpse Into the Album Was *Chef's Kiss*\n\nYep, Tay posted a note on Instagram the day she announced the album that read the following:\n\n“And so I enter into evidence\n\nMy tarnished coat of arms\n\nMy muses, acquired like bruises,\n\nMy talismans and charms\n\nThe tick tick tick of love bombs\n\nMy veins of pitch black ink\n\nAll’s fair in love and poetry,\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Chairman of the Tortured Poets Department”\n\nThe Tracklist Initially Had Everyone Thinking This Is a Breakup Album\n\n...Which it kinda sorta is!!! I mean, look at the initial tracklist, which the musician dropped on Instagram after it leaked on TikTok. Ahem:\n\nSide A\n\nFortnight (feat. Post Malone)\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department\n\nMy Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\n\nDown Bad\n\nSide B\n\nSo Long, London\n\nBut Daddy I Love Him\n\nFresh Out the Slammer\n\nFlorida!!! (Florence + the Machine)\n\nSide C\n\nGuilty as Sin?\n\nWho’s Afraid of Little Old Me?\n\nI Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)\n\nloml\n\nSide D\n\nI Can Do It With a Broken Heart\n\nThe Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\n\nThe Alchemy\n\nClara Bow\n\nBonus Track: The Manuscript\n\nFans obvi almost immediately jumped to the conclusion that the album was about Joe based on some of the song titles:\n\nThat! Said!!!!!!\n\nTTPD Only Mentions Tay's Joe Alywn Breakup In a Few Songs\n\nNamely, “So Long, London” and “loml.”\n\nObvi, fans were shocked given everyone kiiiiinda assumed TTPD would mainly be about the musician's 'ship with Joe and not Matty Healy.\n\nFYI, prior to the album dropping, the Daily Mail spoke to a source who said, “If it is a dis album, that is shady. He helped her with song writing on her past album so it will really come as a shock to him if she talks about their breakup, as it is something he has not spoken of at all. Regardless of what she does, he will still not respond because he has removed himself from her narrative and is very glad he did.” Yikes!\n\nFans Think “But Daddy I Love Him” Might Be About Harry Styles\n\nObviously, “But Daddy I Love Him” is a line from Disney’s original animated film The Little Mermaid, but it also happens to be the phrase from a shirt Harry Styles wore once upon a time...\n\n...Which had fans thinking the song is either about (or features) the fellow musician:\n\nImportant to note that Harry was originally in the running to play Prince Eric in the live action film, and fans snooped around Apple Music for new clues and words per Taylor Nation’s request. The finding? “Hereby,” which is also included in The Little Mermaid when Ariel signs her voice away to Ursula.\n\nThe Album Is About the Five Stages of Grief\n\nFans noticed the shifting variant background hues and began theorizing that The Tortured Poets Department’s colors represent the Five Stages of Grief:\n\nDenial\n\nAnger\n\nBargaining\n\nDepression\n\nAcceptance\n\nAnd luckily, Tay herself confirmed all our suspicions when she dropped five Apple Music playlists based on each stage. Here's everything ya need to know about them:\n\nA Recent Spotify Fan Event Unveiled a Ton More Easter Eggs\n\nI’m simply not mentally over *insane hand gesture* all of this, but we’re going to deep dive anyway. On April 16, Spotify threw a TTPD fan exhibit at The Grove in Los Angeles and fans found a ton of Easter eggs relating to the new album. According to a press release from the music and podcast streamer, the experience was “highly curated to represent the direction of the new record” and updated each day “with additional aspects, creating a one-of-a-kind experience,” until April 18.\n\nAllow me to lay out everything fans found, rapid-fire style:\n\nAn open book containing new lyrics\n\nThe book contained different sets of lyrics, including:\n\n“Even statues crumble if they’re made to wait”\n\n“One less temptress. One less dagger to sharpen”\n\nThe new lyrics came nearly a week after Tay posted some on her social accounts:\n\nA Speak Now nod...and 72 drawers\n\nThere were books placed on shelves throughout the exhibit, and their titles seemed to pull from The Tortured Poets Department tracklist with the exception of one: a notebook with the word “US” written in Sharpie. Swifties thought it tied back to her Speak Now track, “The Story of Us.”\n\nFans also found 72 drawers in cabinet units throughout the exhibit that resembled a library book catalog. There were six open drawers, and eagle-eyed Swifties noted that 72 months is equivalent to 6 years—aka how long she was with Joe Alwyn.\n\nA globe pinned to Florida\n\nThere was a nod to the Sunshine State, also the name of one of Tay’s new album tracks featuring Florence Welch.\n\nQuills and fountain pens\n\nLongtime Swifties know that the singer categorizes her songs in different categories inspired by writing devices. According to Tay, quill songs have “words and phrasings [that] are antiquated,” like “Ivy.” On the flip side, fountain pens have “a modern storyline or references, with a poetic twist” like her magnum opus, “All Too Well.” Because of this detail, fans relate TTPD as a bridge between Red and Evermore, the albums on which those songs live.\n\nA clock set to 2:00\n\nThere were a ton of nods to the number two throughout the exhibit, including peace signs and clocks set to 2:00...which wound up being beyond important since 2 am is when she dropped a whopping 15 ADDITIONAL SONGS. Legit still at a loss for words. 😭😭😭\n\nYou Can Now Order the Album, Cassette, and CD\n\nDepending on how you choose to purchase The Tortured Poets Department, you’re in for some fun treats. Example? The record comes with a collectible 24-page book-bound jacket, unique handwritten lyrics, and never-before-seen photos.\n\nTaylor Is “So Proud” of the Project\n\nWhile accepting her Artist of the Year award at the 2024 iHeart Radio Music Awards, the singer thanked her fans and teased that “we have so many exciting things ahead of us,” namely The Tortured Poets Department. “I’m so proud of it,” Tay added before gushing, “I cannot wait to share it with you.”\n\nWatch the celeb’s speech in full below:"
