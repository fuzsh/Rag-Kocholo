        "text": "Drake has released a huge folder of previously unseen content which includes three new songs and behind the scenes footage.\n\nMaterial from studio sessions, audio clips and the fresh tunes were uploaded to website 100gigs, with the Canadian rapper posting a screenshot of the site on his Instagram Story.\n\nThe three unreleased songs are titled: It's Up, featuring Young Thug and 21 Savage, Housekeeping Knows, featuring Latto, and Blue Green Red.\n\nThe release, which totals just over 100 gigabytes of data, comes after a quiet few months for Drake following his feud with fellow rapper Kendrick Lamar.\n\nIn one of the folders which references 2016 hit Hotline Bling, Drake is seen explaining the song is named after someone he had a romantic encounter with, whose name he saved in his phone as \"Hotline Bling\".\n\nWe also see various clips from the filming of the music video for the song.\n\nThey include Drake dancing in front of a clear background that changes colour, and then watching his dancing back on screen.\n\nAnother folder which references Honestly Nevermind shows footage from inside the studio of the production of the 2022 album, in which Drake and his team are reacting to the music.\n\nAlso featuring is US rapper 21 Savage, as part of a folder called \"HER LOSS\", the same name as their 2022 album.\n\nThe folder of 25 clips includes behind the scenes footage of the two of them preparing before an interview, and footage from behind the camera operator during a music video.\n\nFans have been quick to give their reaction to the footage and new music, with a mixed response.\n\nManisha Asher, from London, tells BBC Newsbeat she likes the way Drake has released his new music.\n\n\"It’s quite exciting isn’t it. I’ve always liked Drake, I’ve always loved his old stuff,\" she says.\n\n\"It’s about time we got some of the old Drake back, a lot of his tunes are classics.\n\n\"He hasn’t released too much, he’s released the right amount just to give people a little bit of a taste of what him coming back is going to sound like.\"\n\nAnd posting on X/Twitter, one fan who was slightly less impressed said: \"Why is no one telling Drake one of his main problems is over saturation?\"\n\nAnother described the release \"so bad\" and that they were \"so done with Drake\"."
