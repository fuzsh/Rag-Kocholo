        "text": "Prayers for the Morning and New Beginnings\n\nPeace Within\n\nMay today there be peace within.\n\nMay you trust God that you are exactly where you are meant to be.\n\nMay you not forget the infinite possibilities that are born of faith.\n\nMay you use those gifts that you have received, and pass on the love that has been given to you\n\nMay you be confident knowing you are a child of God.\n\nLet this presence settle into your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, praise and love.\n\nIt is there for each and every one of us.\n\n- Minnie Louise Haskins\n\n>> Prayer Card\n\nAt the Beginning of the Day\n\nO God,\n\nI find myself at the beginning of another day.\n\nI do not know what it will bring.\n\nPlease help me to be ready for whatever it may be.\n\nIf I am to stand up, help me to stand bravely.\n\nIf I am to sit still, help me to sit quietly.\n\nIf I am to lie low, help me to do it patiently.\n\nIf I am to do nothing, let me do it gallantly.\n\nI pray just for today, for these twenty-four hours,\n\nfor the ability to cooperate with others according to the way Jesus taught us to live.\n\n\"Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\"\n\nMay these words that he taught us become more than words.\n\nPlease free my thinking and feelings and the thinking and feelings of others,\n\nfrom all forms of self-will, self-centeredness, dishonesty, and deception.\n\nAlong with my brothers and sisters,\n\nI need this freedom to make my choices today according to your desires.\n\nSend your Spirit to inspire me in time of doubt and indecision so that, together, we can walk along your path.\n\n- Adapted by J. Veltri, S.J.\n\nBack to Top\n\nMorning Prayer\n\nGracious God,\n\nThank you for the gift of today.\n\nRefresh me. Invite me to discover your presence\n\nIn each person that I meet\n\nAnd every event that I encounter.\n\nTeach me when to speak and when to listen\n\nWhen to ponder and when to share.\n\nIn moments of challenge and decision\n\nAttune my heart to the whisperings of your Wisdom.\n\nAs I undertake ordinary and unnoticed tasks,\n\nGift me with simple joy.\n\nWhen my day goes well, may I rejoice.\n\nWhen it grows difficult, surprise me with\n\nNew possibilities.\n\nWhen life is overwhelming, call me to\n\nSabbath moments\n\nTo restore your Peace and Harmony.\n\nMay my living today reveal your Goodness.\n\n- Pat Bergen, C.S.J.\n\nBack to Top\n\nWe Awaken in Christ's Body\n\nWe awaken in Christ's body\n\nAs Christ awakens our bodies,\n\nAnd my poor hand is Christ, He enters\n\nMy foot, and is infinitely me.\n\nI move my hand, and wonderfully\n\nMy hand becomes Christ, becomes all of Him\n\n(for God is indivisibly\n\nWhole, seamless in His Godhood).\n\nI move my foot, and at once\n\nHe appears like a flash of lightning.\n\nDo my words seem blasphemous? Then\n\nOpen your heart to Him\n\nAnd let yourself receive the one\n\nWho is opening to you so deeply.\n\nFor if we genuinely love Him,\n\nWe wake up inside Christ's body\n\nWhere all our body, all over,\n\nevery most hidden part of it,\n\nis realized in joy as Him,\n\nand He makes us, utterly, real,\n\nand everything that is hurt, everything\n\nthat seemed to us dark, harsh, shameful,\n\nmaimed, ugly, irreparably\n\ndamaged, is in Him transformed\n\nand recognized as whole, as lovely,\n\nand radiant in His light\n\nhe awakens as the Beloved in every last part of our body.\n\n- Symeon the New Theologian\n\nBack to Top\n\nThe Spirit of God is Always with Us at This Time, in This Place\n\nWe awaken in our time to a Universe which is holy,\n\nto creation which is not an event in the past, but a living event of the present.\n\nWe enter a new mode of human presence where we are not merely observers,\n\nbut where each of us is a participant in this moment of evolution.\n\nLike all other creatures, we carry with us Wisdom and Values, the dynamics of the Universe.\n\nBut unlike other creatures, we must choose whether and how we will live in harmony\n\nwithin this sacred web of creation.\n\nMay we be open to the Source of All Being, Our God within and among us!\n\nWe have the capacity to wonder,\n\nand to celebrate this great mystery of existence within such a magnificent Universe!\n\nIn us the Universe enters into a great celebration of itself.\n\nWe are part of the Dance, the Great Work, the Great liturgy which is the Universe unfolding.\n\nGlory to You, O God, Source of All Being!\n\nThis great Liturgy finds expression at this moment in us,\n\ngathered here in a posture of prayerful openness, with listening hearts, loving spirits and a holy wonder.\n\nMay the sacred web that unites us with each other, our God and all creation,\n\nignite communities of light and hope throughout the Earth.\n\nMay we be open to the Source of All Being, Our God within and among us!\n\nTogether We Pray:\n\nO Gracious, gentle Spirit of Love,\n\nYour energy permeates the Universe,\n\nIgniting Earth with\n\nYour Goodness, Truth and Beauty.\n\nOpen our minds and hearts\n\nTo a deeper awareness\n\nOf our interconnectedness with You,\n\nEach other and all creation.\n\nMay we experience\n\nYour unique presence\n\nWithin the sacred web of creation.\n\n- Author Unknown\n\nBack to Top\n\nMorning Prayer of Gratitude\n\nLet our prayer this morning be one of gratitude. Gratitude did not make it into the list of four \"cardinal virtues,\" but it is sometimes rightly recognized as a foundational virtue.\n\nLet us each in turn name something worthy of our gratitude, concluding with \"and so let us say.\"\n\nThe group may respond, \"For this we are grateful.\"\n\n- Joe Wessling"
