Exit Game (also known as Escape Game or Escape The Room) is a type of real-life game, taking place in closed rooms or apartments, where players (usually in teams of 2 - 6 people) must solve a set of riddles and tasks to win.

Place[]

Exit Games are usually set in closed building spaces, like apartments. This way the flow of the game can be controlled more easily and games are immune to weather conditions.

Games can be set in just one room (usually in this scenario the final task is to open the door to the room, but not always).

They can also use the space of the whole apartment. This way the flow can be organized in a way that some actions result in transitioning between rooms, opening doors etc. Big advantage of such games comes from the fact that the riddles might require coming back to the rooms that were previously visited.

Plot[]

A very important part of most of the Exit Games is the plot. Before playing the game a group of players is usually briefed into the storyline (this might happen as a result of reading a letter at the beginning of the game, watching video on a screen etc.). Exit Games usually have websites, where players can read the story of the game before they arrive at the place where the actual game take place. In this way creators of the game can gain the interest even before the game starts.

Players[]

Most Exit Games is suited for teams of 2 - 6 people (rarely more, since the apartments would get overcrowded during the game and players would have problems communicating with each other.
