The Exit is a deleted Flamingo video where he plays a game called “The Exit.” The game supports both Spanish and English in it, usually for actions and objects (for Spanish). People debate why the video was taken down. Some people claim that it was removed because they forgot to censor a word, some people also speculate that it was a filler video, and that editors weren’t happy with it.

An archive of the video can be found here.
