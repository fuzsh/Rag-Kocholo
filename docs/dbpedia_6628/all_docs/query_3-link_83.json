This focuses more on the puzzle problem solving than some of the scarier rooms, so it was perfect for our daughter's first room. Good production; challenging but not impossible. Very friendly hosts. Thanks for a great time!\n\nWe didn't know what to expect but it was such an awesome experience! I went with two other people, one was a 10 year old. We joined another family of 4 , it was so much fun! We escaped the room with 30 seconds left. I highly recommend this place!\n\nIt was an awesome experience. The clues were really good and well thought out. The host was very friendly and made us feel comfortable about what was to come. Definitely will be going back soon."
