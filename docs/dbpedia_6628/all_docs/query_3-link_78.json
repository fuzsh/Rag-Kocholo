        "meta_description": "Who doesn't love a long walk in the woods? A good  relaxing stroll will be just what the doctor ordered you think as you venture out into nature. You cross a bridge, see the sights and all of sudden the bridge is gone! Who knows what is hiding out here in the dark forest...It's time to see if we can escape!\n\n\n\nExit The Game: The Enchanted Forest is published by Kosmos Games. It is designed by Inka and Markus Brand with art by Michael Menzel. It is intended for 1-4 players and plays in 1-2 hours. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGameplay \n\n\n\nExit games are designed as escape room experiences in a box and The Enchanted Forest is no different. The game comes with 88 cards, 1 rulebook, 30 answer cards, 19 riddle cards and 9 strange cards. There is also a decoder disk and 10 strange items. You'll also need some paper, writing utensils and scissors. \n\n\n\nThe cards are all placed in piles of Riddle, Answer and Help cards. There is no actual game board in these games but you will reveal more as you go along that will lay out maps, illustrations and more. You will add in some of the strange items and other effects as well as the game progresses. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Enchanted Forest your goal is to find a way out as fast as you can. There are multiple riddles you must solve and as you do you will find ways to advance along in the adventure. I don't want to give away any of the game but it continues to built as you progress so it is important to pay attention through the whole game. You never know when something you do will come back later so detail is super important. \n\n\n\nDuring Exit you are constantly trying to solve and check answers for the riddles and it has a neat little aspect where you check your rules to the disk and see if the code is correct or wrong. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpressions\n\n\n\nThe Exit series of games is a blast to play and one of my favorite escape room in a box games. My son and I often do these and we did this one together and really enjoyed it. Like all their other titles in the Exit series you have to remember that it is a one and done game, you will be cutting things and tearing/manipulating the game in such a way that it can't go back to how it was. Which is ok because the price point is low enough that you feel like you get a good deal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game is full of all sorts of clues that are easy to follow in the game but as mentioned earlier you really need to pay attention to them and see how they move forward in the story. A mistake early on in not logging something correct can really throw your game for a loop.\n\n\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this one and played it at the two player count which gave us a lot of time to really think through the moves and work together. These games often do better with the smaller player count I've seen. I would recommend this one to anyone who loves escape room experiences and enjoys riddles, you will not be disappointed!",
