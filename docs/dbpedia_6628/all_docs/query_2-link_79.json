        "text": "On May 25, 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) added gaming disorder to their list of diseases – ICD 11.\n\nThe WHO stated that the main reason for including the gaming disorder on their list was the ever-growing body of evidence that shows gaming disorder causes functional impairment to someone’s life:\n\n“…the exclusion of other daily activities, as well as to any changes in their physical or psychological health and social functioning that could be attributed to their pattern of gaming behavior.”\n\nGlobally, gaming disorder is estimated to impact 3% of gamers. We have put together a set of detailed video game addiction statistics for you, including how the issue affects different countries.\n\nFor individuals struggling, there are video game addiction withdrawal symptoms you can be aware of regarding psychological health. Some of the most common ones include:\n\nIrritability\n\nAggression\n\nIntense cravings\n\nAnxiety, depression\n\nBoredom\n\nHeadaches\n\nVideo Game Addiction Withdrawal Symptoms\n\nGaming disorder is treated as a mental health condition. However, it can be a disorder of our brain’s reward system.\n\nAccording to the dopamine theory of addiction, playing video games causes a quick release of dopamine. This causes our reward system to be flooded by a sudden rush of dopamine, which makes us feel pleasure and happiness.\n\nWhen we play games for prolonged periods, this can create a dopamine imbalance. Other activities don’t provide us with the same amount of dopamine, which leads us to play more and more games to feel the same levels of satisfaction we once did. In this scenario a dopamine detox may be effective to reverse these challenges.\n\nIn the long-term, this creates a dependence on video games to feel pleasure. Although video game addiction is not a physical dependence, most video game addiction withdrawal symptoms will be psychological.\n\nBelow we will share more the common symptoms you may experience when you stop gaming.\n\nIrritability and Aggression\n\nIrritability and aggression are two common symptoms gaming addicts experience when they stop playing games.\n\nBecause they can no longer access their favorite source of entertainment, they’ll start to feel edgy and irritable about it. In some cases, the irritability goes to such an extent that the individual gets aggressive with people around them.\n\n“My son has been without games for one week, and he attacked me last night. He body-slammed to the floor. I hit my head and now feel like I might need to visit the hospital. This shit is out of control. It just takes their minds. He’s only 13.”\n\nIf you or your child starts to experience these symptoms, it’s important to have a safety plan. It’s normal to feel irritable and even angry, but aggression or violence should be treated seriously. Contact your local emergency department immediately if violence occurs.\n\nIntense Cravings\n\nWhen you stop doing something that you love doing, you’ll start to crave it. The same goes for video game addicts, only that the cravings can be so intense that the addicted person will be prepared to do almost anything to get another game.\n\nThese cravings are caused by the imbalance of chemicals in our brain – most importantly, dopamine. For example, when we play video games, increased amounts of dopamine are released , caused by the hyperarousal of our brains.\n\nVideo game addiction causes individuals to crave games after they stop playing them. They start to seek entertainment and pleasure from these games, and if they can’t get it, they begin to feel irritated or even aggressive.\n\nWatch: How to Stop Gaming Cravings\n\nAnxiety, Depression\n\nAs we’ve already mentioned, most of the video game addiction withdrawal symptoms will be psychological.\n\nSeveral studies have shown a possible link between gaming addiction and depression. In addition, they’ve established that the more intense the gaming addiction is, the higher the likelihood of severe depression will be.\n\nThen there’s also the aspect of social isolation and gaming addiction. Because most gaming addicts are deprived of real-world social connections, they start to feel depressed because of this as well.\n\nDepression and sadness are not to be confused, though. Sadness is a temporary state of mind, while depression is a clinical diagnosis and it requires treatment. Sadness should start to disappear after 2-3 weeks after quitting gaming, but if it persists and other symptoms such as irritability are present, then you should talk to a therapist.\n\nGeneral anxiety and social anxiety are not uncommon, too. Once the gamer stops playing video games, they’ll often start to feel depression and anxiety, which were set in stone during the addiction already. When they stop playing games, these two withdrawal symptoms begin to get amplified.\n\nBoredom\n\nAccording to members of our community, most of them tend to spend at least four hours a day on video games. Additionally, many spend four additional hours on other types of entertainment, like binge-watching Netflix or YouTube or spending too much time on Reddit.\n\nWhen video games are no longer a distraction, it creates a deep hole in their schedule. All of a sudden, their main daily activity is taken away. As a result, hours of daily time are freed up, and it often happens that the person has no other activities to replace the gaming activity.\n\nGaming is a challenge; we like to be challenged, and suddenly, you lose your main source of challenge. As a result, you start to lose a lack of purpose, and you don’t know what to do next in life.\n\nIt’s normal to become bored because of a lack of video games. The solution for this is simple: find other activities to replace your gaming. You can use our hobby tool to find some great hobbies that you’ll enjoy doing.\n\nHeadaches\n\nHeadaches are not as common as other symptoms, but they often happen. Many members of our community report having severe headaches after stopping gaming.\n\nInsomnia and even nightmares are also commonly present in addition to headaches. Now, headaches after quitting gaming should not persist very long – usually, they should go away after about a week after stopping.\n\nI know when I quit gaming, I had a bunch of nightmares about me playing, and it’s a weird experience, but they will go away eventually.\n\nWatch: Is It Normal To Have Dreams and Nightmares About Gaming?\n\nOther Severe Symptoms\n\nSometimes, the withdrawal symptoms are so severe that you might start feeling like there’s no help.\n\nYou should know that overcoming addiction is a huge process to go through. As you stop playing, big changes start to happen in your brains, which begin to cause these withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn some cases, it might even cause thoughts of suicide. If that’s you, please talk to someone about this, whether your friend, teacher, parent or therapist. It’s best to let your feelings be known and seek help immediately.\n\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline\n\nCall 1-800-273-8255\n\nChat: https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org\n\nAbout Video Game Addiction Withdrawal\n\nRegardless of how long the withdrawal symptoms last or how intense they are, it’s important to focus on embracing them as they happen.\n\nIt would be best if you learned how to navigate them instead. Some symptoms might last for much longer than just a few weeks. For example, some people still feel cravings for playing games years after quitting playing.\n\nSo the best way to cope with the withdrawal symptoms is to embrace them as they happen at the start and then learn how to navigate your life despite them.\n\nHow Long Does Video Game Withdrawal Last?\n\nEveryone’s a bit different, and the types of withdrawal symptoms and why they’re happening will be unique for you, but there’s a few things I can share about this.\n\nThe first is that withdrawal symptoms tend to spike initially after you stop for the first 84 hours, and then they begin to dissipate over time.\n\nNow, how long this will take is hard to say. Still, generally, boredom, for instance, usually takes about three weeks before you start to experience other activities as being engaging and fulfilling in the same way.\n\nOverall, the biggest gains and benefits tend to happen in the first 30 days of not gaming, and then things become just more normalized in your life.\n\nHow To Overcome Video Game Withdrawal Symptoms?\n\nSo how can you navigate the video game withdrawal symptoms?\n\nStep 1: Give yourself some space from gaming. This means that you’ll want to uninstall all of your games and delete your accounts if necessary. You’ll also want to delete your games from your phone, unsubscribe from gaming subreddits, and use blockers to block all gaming content. It might even mean taking a step away from your gamer friends. We have a list of tutorials on deleting your accounts here.\n\nStep 2: Create and improve your coping strategies. It would help if you learned how to cope with the withdrawal symptoms as they happen. You might want to find replacement activities and hobbies. Also, find other ways to relax: meditate, do yoga. You could also go for a walk, listen to podcasts or music you find relaxing, or read books.\n\nTo feel the sense of progress, you make in games, you should start new hobbies or learn new skills. These should keep you motivated and challenged throughout the process.\n\nStep 3: “This too shall pass.” Know that most of these symptoms are temporary and will go away after some time. After that period, you can start enjoying the little things in life again. No matter how intense the symptoms are, they’ll be gone. Just stay focused and strong.
