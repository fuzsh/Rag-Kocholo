The stone thing makes me think of the ricocheting powerup from Castlevania. Other than that, I can't really help you. Sorry.\n\nI do have one I need a hand with.\n\nWhen I was a kid (I'm thinking 1995, maybe, is when we bought it. Maybe a couple years later.), we had an arcade cabinet that had no title on the marquee at the top, just some picture of guys in the army.\n\nIn this game, you drove a jeep. Co-op was possible, adding another jeep to the screen. You had two buttons: One for machine gun, and one for explosives, which started out as a blue grenade. It was a vertical scroller, with you driving upwards (what I call \"Gunsmoke-style\"). On the way, there were several military bases. You could use your explosives to blow up certain buildings in the base, and you would see that the buildings housed guys. If you stopped your jeep next to the building, the guys would file into your car. Shortly after these military bases, there would be a helipad, where you would park and let the guys get off. As you let them off, you would be upgrading your explosives. First to missiles, then to missiles that exploded in a horizontal line, then to missiles that exploded in an \"X\" pattern.\n\nYou could put in as many credits as you wanted (obviously, because we owned the machine). But, in the final military base, you were not allowed to continue if you lost all your lives in co-op. In single player, there was never an option to continue. If you lost, it would show a map that displays how far you got, and then end. If you were playing co-op and your partner was still alive, you could use another credit to get 3 more lives. But, again, you could not do this in the final military base.\n\n</div>\n\n</center>\n\n</center></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<div><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td> Errordotocx </a></td></tr><tr><td><div <center>\n\n<center>\n\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\">\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\">\n\n<a href=\"#\"> <b>X19 </b></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-div\" style=\"visibility:hidden; height:0px; \">\n\n<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion/30/the-cant-remember-the-name-of-this-game-thread/453034/?page=2\">Link</a><div>\n\nIt was on the PC around 1995-97\n\nYou played as a futuristic spaceship in a 3D world on a planets surface somewhere in space.\n\nThe first cutscene was of your ship being raised on a platform from underground to the surface, I remember flashing red siren lights on the sides of the platform.\n\nYou were then in game and had to take off from a runway and take out futuristic mini cities like their radar towers etc.\n\nThats all I can remember.\n\n</div>\n\n</center>\n\n</center></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<div><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td> X19 </a></td></tr><tr><td><div <center>\n\n<center>\n\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\">\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\">\n\n<a href=\"#\"> <b>Kontrapunkt </b></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-div\" style=\"visibility:hidden; height:0px; \">\n\n<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion/30/the-cant-remember-the-name-of-this-game-thread-v20/458626/?page=6 \">Link</a><div>\n\nHi ladies and gents. Another lost game.\n\nHere we go!\n\nPC game. Around the time of Age of Empires and AoE: Rise of Rome and Microsoft Return of Arcade. I played a demo edition. Probably released by Microsoft or Microsoft game studios. The basis of the game was a sort of flight simulator. Flying something that may or may not have resembled a stealth fighter, I remember being in Egypt, shooting aliens ( I think) and trying to fly either through a trap door through the pyramids or the sphinx. I never made it very far.

Felt like it might have been from a foreign developer. I remember playing it around the same time as 1NSANE, so maybe 2004-05. You could race as anything from real fast go-karts to tour buses, and all types of vehicles could be in the same race. Some real locations like Corsica, but just fake road courses, not real tracks.\n\nI know there were no pickups or powerups, but there may have been some mechanism for dropping spikes or oil slicks. Could be confusing that with another game though. Don't think there was much of a campaign.\n\nThe only other thing I remember is that at the end of the opening cinematic, the black sports car loses it's license plate and when the camera zooms in on it, it says '2FAST4U'.

You can open drawer, door, etc.\n\nSometime when opening door in first person you discover a monster that charge toward you, it bring you back to the 2d scrolling portion of the house and you must fight it.\n\nI mostly remember the game for it's catchy tune it has when you walk in the house (well, maybe more traumatizing for a kid I guess...). The music change when you find a monster I think.\n\nThat's mostly to hear that song again, I never finished the game and probably played 5-10 minutes each time.... it was too scary for me I guess :D\n\n</div>\n\n</center>\n\n</center></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<div><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td> <i>Resolved </a></td></tr><tr><td><div <center>\n\n<center>\n\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\">\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\">\n\n<a href=\"#\"> <b>Driadon </b></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-div\" style=\"visibility:hidden%3B height:0px%3B \">\n\n<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion/30/the-cant-remember-the-name-of-this-game-thread-v20/458626/#26\">Link</a><div>\n\nPrepare for a very out there one: There was a freeware game I had years ago that was...kind of a space sim and kind of a simulation of the Milky Way as we know it.\n\nYou were and alien that was tasked with exploring the stars as you saw fit, you could land on any solid planet and walk around freely on it. You were limited only by a fuel that could either be replenished by mining off of white dwarfs or waiting in real time (even if the program was closed).\n\nThe graphics were primitive (I can't remember if it even had proper colour) though the game was rather recent (2004 or 2005 ish? At least that was around the time I had first found it). It was offered both as an offline or an online client.\n\nEdit: Never mind, I got lucky using Wikipedia.

I think it was before 96. If I had to guess, somewhere between 1990-1992. Possibly from Taito. I only remember the gameplay vaguely, but it involved water somehow. You played as a dude with flowing water powers or shoot water blobs or something. The graphics were cartoonish, think Rainbow Island with lots of colors and fruit and shit.\n\nI know it sounds like just about every platformer, which is why I can't find this specific one. But it's an arcade game from the late 80's or early 90's and reminds me of Rainbow Island, Bubble Bobble. Just need help to pin down a few possible games. I'll probably recognize it as soon as I see it though. Since it was an arcade game, it was pretty frantic as well.\n\n</div>\n\n</center>\n\n</center></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<div><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td> hejklyscha </a></td></tr><tr><td><div <center>\n\n<center>\n\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\">\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\">\n\n<a href=\"#\"> <b>Spoike </b></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-div\" style=\"visibility:hidden%3B height:0px%3B \">\n\n<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion/30/the-cant-remember-the-name-of-this-game-thread-v20/458626/?page=5\">Link</a><div>\n\nI'm looking for a sandbox-y Amiga game, which I loved playing around with and help me learning english. It was lost when my dad decided to format the disk and put something else in it. I'm pretty sure the title screen said the game was from \"Sierra On-Line\" but whenever I check their games list I can't find it. So it may have been some kind of a unfinished demo.\n\nThe game, IIRC, was a very simple Sierra adventure game done in their CLI engine at the time. The graphics are similar to the era of the early Kings Quest and Police Quest games. It only had two screens, the title screen and the other was of a cross-section of a house. The house was about 4-5 storeys high, with 1-2 rooms in each. I remember the bottom floor had the kitchen and the living room, and the top floor was an attic. The stair well was next to the center of the screen.\n\nYou controlled a bobbing-headed dude (that ominously stared at the player almost all the time) that walked around by himself and interacted with the objects in the house. You could only control the dude by writing commands like \"go to kitchen\", \"go to attic\" and so on where he would walk over there. If you could figure out what the objects were you could interact with them as well such as \"sit on couch\" (I remember the attic had one of those old style vinyl record player). The game however, would crash if the character exited the mansion or went inside the closet (which leads me to believe it was an unfinished demo).\n\nStill if anyone else has it or knows where to find it, I'd be in nostalgia heaven.\n\n</div>\n\n</center>\n\n</center></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<div><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td> SubwayD </a></td></tr><tr><td><div <center>\n\n<center>\n\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\">\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\">\n\n<a href=\"#\"> <b>DemonWolf </b></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-div\" style=\"visibility:hidden%3B height:0px%3B \">\n\n<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion/30/the-cant-remember-the-name-of-this-game-thread-v20/458626/?page=5 \">Link</a><div>\n\nHey all. I am looking for 2 games. The first I last played about 10 years ago. It was a game that started out in a side view of a bunker and you could pick one of 3 vehicles (possibly 4). A jeep that could go out onto water, a tank and a helicopter. Each had their own abilities and unique bonus. Once a vehicle had been selected, it went to the surface and then the game was a sort of open roaming top down shooting game. The graphics were not horrible, but they were not exactly high standard. There was colour and some decent explosions. The second game I am looking for was a little more recent. I played it in 2003 but I am unsure when it was made. It was sort of like Delta Force (open world objective based) but you were in a hover tank. I have hunted online and found HoverTank 3D and various others, but not the one I was looking for. I remember you could have \"wing men\" and customize your tank. It was a 3rd person game. Much more on the second one, I am unable to remember clearly.

Everything is 2D, drawn sort of like a cartoon. The guys are all little blue/purple balls that the player can customize with a few features like eyes and hair. The journey would consist of a series of puzzle mini-games, each tied to a location that you had to pass through. If you did poorly, you would lose guys from your party until they where all dead and you had to start over. If you got to the end, you would reach a city full of the blue dot dudes, and you could go back and bring more parties of them over. If you hang out at the end, looking at the city you can see all the dudes you finished with running around, and eventually if you spent too much time starting at the screen, the narrator voice (I guess there was a narrator voice) would tell you to go outside and get some fresh air.<br /><br />One of the puzzles involved an antagonistic tree monster, or a monster that looked like a tree to my child brain, and pizzas? I think that's what it was, I just remember that level because I really hated it. One of the last levels had you traversing over a pit. All your dudes where in bubbles in order to float over, but they had to follow a path defined on a grind which you could change arrows on in order guide them through safely. It's probably also worth mentioning that I don't think you ever have direct control over the people in your party, you just act as there guide through abstracted ways.

It was a shooter, set behind your character, who was on some kind of futuristic motorbike. First level was a beach or desert, I think, and the whole game had a weird, bright, pastel-y color scheme. The enemies looked like weird robots, and mostly just tried to drop bombs and things on you from overhead. The powerups were big orbs, kinda like those things from the Sonic %26 Knuckles Bonus Stages.\n\nThe thing that stuck out at me the most were the boss battles. Each level had three stages in it, and the last one was always a boss battle. For those, a big space shuttle/carrier looking thing would float down and attach some stuff to your bike, turning it into an awesome jet, allowing you to fly up and down instead of just moving left and right for the duration of the boss fight.\n\nI used to play that game constantly with my brother, and I need to know the name to jog his memory.

Okay, I remember playing a demo disc I somehow got on my dad's computer at work when I was little, and I can't remember much of what was on it, besides Wacky Wheels. There might have been Jazz Jackrabbit and Hocus Pocus on it, or those could have been different demos, I just don't know. The game that I am trying to remember, though, was a 2d sprite-based fighting game. I think the logo for the developer was a bunch of weapons stuck into the ground, that seems to ring a bell. I believe all the characters had weapons, and there was a fighter that reminds me a lot of E. Honda looking back on it. There is just not a lot that I can think of for this one (I think characters could jump off the sides of the screen?) but it bugs me to this day.\n\n</div>\n\n</center>\n\n</center></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<div><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td> Diamond </a></td></tr><tr><td><div <center>\n\n<center>\n\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\">\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\">\n\n<a href=\"#\"> <b>CptChiken</b></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-div\" style=\"visibility:hidden%3B height:0px%3B \">\n\n<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion/30/the-cant-remember-the-name-of-this-game-thread-v20/458626/?page=10\">Link</a><div>\n\nOk this is going to be a real long shot because i cant remember much about it but hey heres what i can remember.\n\nIts a 1990s PC space shooter, It was first person and i think you were in a space ship. I remember there were enemies of different colour green ones a purple ones, i remember the purple ones being REAL bitches.\n\nMy one vivid memory of it is a demo i had on there where my brother had recorded the run of one of the late levels. It started off with him going through a circular door which slides open like the action of a camera shutter if you know what i mean. Through the door is a huge RED room full of enemies and the door is like really high up at the top of this open space and the rest of the room is below with loads of enemies.\n\nI remember this contrasted with what i could remember because all the levels i'd played were corridor crawlers.\n\nI know its not much but i hope someone will be able to help, i know its not very likely.\n\nOh and if you were wondering, this is what i meant but the door opening mechanism:\n\n(Image on page)\n\n</div>\n\n</center>\n\n</center></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<div><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td> Ignor</a></td></tr><tr><td><div <center>\n\n<center>\n\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\">\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\">\n\n<a href=\"#\"> <b>CptChicken</b></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-div\" style=\"visibility:hidden%3B height:0px%3B \">\n\n<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion/30/the-cant-remember-the-name-of-this-game-thread-v20/458626/?page=11\">Link</a><div>\n\nOk heres another game i forget.\n\nAgain its from the 90s or like 2000, but probably late 90s. Its a racing game set on either other planets or post apocalypse earth. I think its probably other planets because i remember one of the tracks being in a futuristic city, an other was in a desert and another was in some green hills area but thats all i can remember track wise.\n\nI remember the cars were all kind of beaten up and bolted together dusty metal. I also remember them quite often having the wheels on like arms out at the front. The fastest car i think was a bulky red thing.\n\nI think i remember the drivers of each vehicle having an identity and more often than not they were very steam punk esc. But all of them were grimy seedy looking characters.\n\nThats all i can remember for now but i'll try and think of more and update this.\n\noh yeah this is a PC game on windows 98 i think. I remember it came with a Tiny computer i bought back then.\n\nHope you can help\n\n</div>\n\n</center>\n\n</center></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<div><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td> ESREVER </a></td></tr><tr><td><div <center>\n\n<center>\n\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\">\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\">\n\n<a href=\"#\"> <b>maysey</b></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-div\" style=\"visibility:hidden%3B height:0px%3B \">\n\n<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion/30/the-cant-remember-the-name-of-this-game-thread-v20/458626/?page=14\">Link</a><div>\n\nright, heres what I can renember from the game im trying to figure out:\n\n- It is a FPS\n\n- Its plot is something about being set in a world where the Nazis had won world war 2\n\n-It was on a episode of 'Playr' where at the time the game was still in development\n\n-I can renember the snippit of the level they played: they were in a construction site, walking across a half built building (all it was was metal girdles, y'know, the bar things?) there was things blowinbg up around them, and I think a nazi blimp appeared and crashed into a building, or atleast made something blow up when it appeared.\n\n-they made it into an alleyway at some point, they met up with a few guys, I think they said something about a resistance, and handed the player a rifle.\n\n-Im not sure what year this was now, it mightve been early nextgen console era (360, PS3 etc), or it might have been a nicely graphiced second gen (pS2 etc) game, I know its definitely on the mainstream consoles, I just dont know which generation\n\n- I have reason to believe it may be named somewhere along the lines of 'Last stand' or 'last' something, but im not sure.\n\nI hope you can find my game, even if its discontinued or something, I'll be happy to know what it is :)\n\n</div>\n\n</center>\n\n</center></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<div><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td> Nikral</a></td></tr><tr><td><div <center>\n\n<center>\n\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\">\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\">\n\n<a href=\"#\"> <b>49th </b></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-div\" style=\"visibility:hidden%3B height:0px%3B \">\n\n<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion/30/the-cant-remember-the-name-of-this-game-thread-v30/473880/?page=2 \">Link</a><div>\n\nIt was a PS2 game I played on some kind of demo disc (I don't know if it was an official disc or just from a magazine) so I'm not entirely sure it was even made into a full game. Anyway, it was basically a 3D arena-based fighting game very early in the PS2 life cycle, you could play as a bunch of different characters but I can only remember 2 of them - one was a dinosaur and I think the other character was in a wheel chair or spaceship type thing (he was sitting down anyway). The wheel chair character could use a special kamikaze attack where he flew up into the air and then you had to guide him back down to earth and into your opponent. If you missed you would die. There were a bunch of different stages, in the demo I think you only had a desert stage though.

It was released around 1998-2000 (maybe).\n\nIn the intro of the game your character is a sniper on a rooftop and is overlooking a hostage situation. He takes the shot despite being told not to, something goes wrong and he retires and becomes a private detective.\n\nThe game is a third person shooter, similar to fallout 2 point of view. After each mission you would go to this town where your office is, you could put weapons in some lockers there and in town you could go to a shooting range as well as buy weapons. You have a secretary, the first missions was on some dock and the last mission was in a jungle.\n\nI ,,think'' it had like zero hour or hour zero in the title but i searched for it and nothing, so its obviously wrong.\n\nAny help is apreciated i just wanna remember the f-ing title, cuz i liked the game when i played it,i was around 6-7.\n\n</div>\n\n</center>\n\n</center></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<div><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td> BeachThunder</a></td></tr><tr><td><div <center>\n\n<center>\n\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\">\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\">\n\n<a href=\"#\"> <b>artofwar420</b></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-div\" style=\"visibility:hidden%3B height:0px%3B \">\n\n<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion/30/the-cant-remember-the-name-of-this-game-thread-v30/473880/?page=5 \">Link</a><div>\n\nI'm trying to remember a 2d sidescroller game.

I don't remember the name, but it was about a rescue mission near Saturn's moons (Titan comes to mind). It was in first person perspective, but most of the graphics were pre-rendered movies. I remember the first level leading you through a maze of circular shaped tunnels. About 10 meters in front of you it would go completely black, so whenever you moved forward you had no idea what you would encounter. Sometimes crawly things (trilobite-like) would come at you via floor, wall or ceiling, other times there could be this gigantic squid-like alien creature that you had to dissect by shooting it in the right places. I remember finding it very scary as it was very claustrophobic and way too difficult.\n\nOther things I remember was this woman (maybe it was your avatar, maybe the person you needed to rescue), she had a tight blue suit with short dark hair, she also had pretty huge breasts. There also was a guy in a grey suit, but I believe this dude had a visor as well (yellow glass(?)). Now that I'm trying to recall more about it, I actually think you were that guy and you had to save the girl. I vaguely remember a cutscene where you find her, but she has been taken over by an alien or something (I remember her eyes becoming a solid color).\n\nI also believe the intro was about the woman before she disappeared, done in classic logbook style.\n\nThat's really all I can remember about it, thanks in advance if you know the answer!\n\n</div>\n\n</center>\n\n</center></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<div><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td> <i> Resolved </a></td></tr><tr><td><div <center>\n\n<center>\n\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\">\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\">\n\n<a href=\"#\"> <b>Sweep</b></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-div\" style=\"visibility:hidden%3B height:0px%3B \">\n\n<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion/30/the-cant-remember-the-name-of-this-game-thread-v30/473880/?page=7 \">Link</a><div>\n\nI remember playing a game on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis which was a top-down scrolling shooter where you would control an army guy and had to shoot your way through a load of other guys. Every so often you would find a tent which you could go into to recruit another army guy to your team and he would have a different weapon (Eg one had a flamethrower, one had a gun which spread out bullets, one had a machine gun, etc). Then when you die you would swap to one of the other guys. Every so often you would have to fight a boss like a tank or a jet or a helicopter. I remember there being a level in a swamp, and one level where you had to shoot through a load of barbed wire fences. I also remember it being pretty brutal on lives but I guess back in the day that was standard for almost all games. I played the game at least 12 years ago so I guess it was released before that, don't know if that helps?

It's an RTS and a RPG. The RTS is really old, but I'm not sure how old, since at the time I was playing it, I wasn't fairly aged myself.. I remember the word Dracula.. for some strange reason, I'm convinced it has something to do with the game.. Anyway, gameplay was based, at start at a overview, where you could see all the lands of the game, then you could invade different countries/lands that were bordering your already occupied zones.. As I remember, there were actually only 3 types of units, and you had to get the resources of different lands, in order to build them. It was sword soldiers, archers and canons.. (I remember the canons could just move by themself, no persons were attached - looked slightly funky). Again.. Something about dracula rings a bell, not sure why.. The RPG game was an old amiga game.. I was even younger when I played that, especially because it seemed to be made by some in Finland, the language was strange at least %3B).. The name I recall had something about Legion in it? You had an overview map, where you could travel from place to place, and you'd get random encounters, or you could sack towns etc, buy from shops in 'em.. I remember there were these troll like creatures, Kobolds or something like that they were called.. Which were extremely hard hitting, but also died quite easily.. When you attacked a city/village/fortress, you would have to throw rocks/stuff at walls in order to get in and kill the defenders to win..

There is one game I played 25 years ago that I can't remember the name. I'm thinking it may have been something my brain made up. It is driving me crazy. Details: Platform: Arcade Time period: mid 80s. It could have been an early 80s game that I didn't play till the mid 80s. Theme: Pirates. This is where it gets a little hazy. I don't remember if you are a pirate or if one of the enemy types are pirates. Levels: 1. You are on a deck of a ship. The graphics are a bit goofy. It is a single over head view but all the characters are animated from the side. You can go up down left and right. You have to avoid pirates and canon balls. The canon balls fire at regular intervals and are easy to avoid. The pirates wander around in a random pattern, you can either avoid or you can fight. Your only weapon is a sword at swings out one block away on the left and right. 2. You are in a jungle running away from a tiger. The whole screen is scrolling to the right while tigers are coming out to your left. The best and only stratgey is to run below the tiger as it passes you, trying to not run into the trees. 3. I can't really remember the third level but I believe there is one. 4. Levels one through three repeat and eventually you and your girlfriend fly way in a hot air ballon. Then the game starts over at a higher difficulty level. Any ideas?\n\n<br>\n\n</center>\n\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<div><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td> Nikral </a></td></tr><tr><td><div <center>\n\n<center>\n\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\">\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\">\n\n<a href=\"#\"> <b>G24S</b></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-div\" style=\"visibility:hidden%3B height:0px%3B \">\n\n<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion/30/the-cant-remember-the-name-of-this-game-thread-v30/473880/ \">Link</a><div>\n\nThis one's hard.
