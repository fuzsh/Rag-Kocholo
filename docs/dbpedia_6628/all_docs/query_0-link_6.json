        "text": "Author: by Arash Hackimi, Saeed Zafarany, Brandon Sheffield\n\nI’ve been doing a research project about Iran’s video games history focusing on how it began, and how it evolved. Through the course of my research I discovered that there were almost no articles in English on the subject, and of the few that exit, none are historical or research-based.\n\nThat’s what inspired me to create this document, which should help shine some light on the history of video games in Iran. This is just a small subsection of the larger document I am preparing (in Persian). I thought it would be interesting to compare the history of games in Iran with the recent history of the country itself, pairing important events with events in the video game timeline.\n\nMy sources include Persian-language websites about games and technology, physical paper magazines such as Daneshmand, and I also interviewed people I know from the industry, both game journalists and developers. Sometimes I simply trusted my own memory.\n\nThe accompanying image should give you a larger context not only for the state of games in Iran, but what was going on in Iran at the time.\n\nVideo Master by Woodrow International in Daneshmand.\n\nVideo Master, via http://www.pong-story.com\n\nTV Game set by General Electronic Kit.\n\nA TV Game set similar to Video Master assembled by Shahab company. Shahab is still operating, and now makes TV sets.\n\nElam Electronic va Computer Magazine no. 93.\n\nBut the problem was the cartridges! They were expensive and rare to find. Because of this, people used to exchange their game cartridges to each other (this trend repeated itself with the release of the PlayStation 4). Gamers in Iran had to rely on the pack-in games from their Famiclones for the most part.\n\nSeyedof, the engine developer at Honafa told me: “Honafa was the first real Iranian game company in existence, and was active for more than 5 years, and developed several finished and polished games.”\n\nHonafa had both a production and R&D team. The production team was busy developing their current projects, since the R&D team was doing research for game engine and 3D technology.\n\nThe Tank Hunter was their first release. It was an endless 2D game for MS-DOS in which a man with an RPG destroyed the enemy’s tanks. This game was dedicated to Iranian martyrs and the heroes of the Iran – Iraq war.\n\nTank Hunter by Honafa Studio.\n\nAli Baba by Ramin ZafarAzizi.\n\nIn 2019, Ali Seyedof, the game engine developer of Honafa, left Iran for Europe.\n\nDevil's Death by Honafa Studio.\n\nAnother magazine was Bazinama, which published its first issue some time in 2005. Bazinama still publishes today, but it abandoned the paper version in September 2019 and turned to digital.\n\nTwo issues of Bazinama Magazine and Donyaye Bazi Magazine.\n\nQuest of Persia: The End of Innocence by Puya Arts.\n\nEngare by Mahdi Bahrami.\n\nEntegham by Phenomenon Studio (later Blazingfallgames).\n\nGarshasp: The Monster Slayer by Fanafzar Studio.\n\nFarsh (Carpet) and Bo by Mahdi Bahrami.\n\nRooster Wars by Medrik Games and Fruit Craft by TOD.\n\nParvaneh Legacy of the Light's Guardians by Bearded Bird.\n\nMotori by Glim Games.\n\nFor a better understanding the economic depression and the effect of the current sanctions, please take a look at the USD to Rl exchange rate I prepared on the right part of the timeline.\n\nArash Hackimi is an Iranian video game journalist and game designer. Arash has been a lecturer in the Iran Game Development Institute, teaching History of Video Games, Video Games Genre, and Video Games Journalism. He started working as a journalist in 2005 as an editor in Donyaye Bazi monthly magazine."
