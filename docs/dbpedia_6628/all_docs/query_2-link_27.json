        "text": "Yesterday, an ominous bit of retail news began making the rounds on X that was, shall we say, ruffling some gaming feathers. And why not, because apparently, one of the long-time go-to stores for gamers will (allegedly) be drastically altering its ongoing approach to disc-based sales, at least in terms of physical movies and TV shows, specifically. I’d argue that games are Hollywood-adjacent, so let the pearl-clutching commence.\n\nI’ll allow The Digital Bits to explain, as they initially broke the story:\n\n“Best Buy plans to exit the physical media business for good next year, possibly as soon as the end of Q1 2024.\n\nThis includes not just their in-store Blu-ray, DVD, and 4K Ultra HD sales, which the retailer has been gradually phasing out for a couple of years now in their many store locations nationwide, but online sales as well. This means no more Best Buy-exclusive Steelbook titles, and no more titles from Best Buy period.”\n\nUnderstandably, film and TV fans are rather upset, as Best Buy has routinely been a reliable source of new disc releases and SteelBooks since the early days, but what does this mean for games, exactly? Variety reports that while movies at the electronics giant may be going the way of the dodo, Best Buy will continue to sell physical video games into the foreseeable future, although who knows for how long.\n\nThe burgeoning truth is apparent—the gaming industry has been marching slowly and steadily toward an all-digital future for years now, and we’re starting to reach terminal velocity. In fact, if you’ve walked into a Best Buy lately (or a Target, for that matter), you’ll see a pretty barebones gaming department, a sad shadow of former glory, one that shined brightly in the late ‘90s and early 2000s with fully stocked shelves, laughing children and floors made of solid gold.\n\nHonestly, the store was truly a gaming destination during the N64, PS1, Dreamcast, PS2, Xbox and GameCube eras. You’d never know by looking at it now, because things have changed so drastically, but next to specialty places like Electronics Boutique and Babbage’s, Best Buy really held its own.\n\nThat said, digital game purchases accounted for over 70% of all game sales in 2022 according to a NewZoo report, and the data anecdotally plays out in deserted Best Buy gaming sections around the country, which feel more like ghost towns at this juncture than flowing fountains of interactive entertainment. Perhaps movies are seeing similar purchasing trends and retailers are simply responding.\n\nI mean, buying and streaming digital media is overwhelmingly more convenient, so this development isn’t exactly surprising. People love convenience, and those beautiful convenience-loving people continually fuel gradual industry movement. Where are we headed? Somewhere less plastic, I’d presume.\n\nYes, there’s the argument of how you don’t ever technically own digital games, that you’re basically renting the rights for an allotted time, which can be taken away at any given moment. Think when titles get de-listed or storefronts get shut down, or how Microsoft is closing the Xbox 360 ecosystem in July 2024. But remember, ‘You Can Keep Playing Your Favorite Games’. Sure, whatever. A preservationist’s nightmare.\n\nAnd in relation to games specifically, owning the original disc or cartridge can allow you to play those titles natively on native hardware without janky emulation, or having to purchase those titles again through cash-grab re-releases. I’m looking at you, rumored The Last of Us Part II Remaster. Because in ten years, do you really want to re-buy God of War on your PS7 for the third time? I’d rather not.\n\nStill, we’re seeing new releases like the imminent Alan Wake 2 releasing only through digital storefronts and bypassing physical disc distribution entirely, and I’m will to bet other games will soon follow suit. I’m quite conflicted about the whole thing, actually, because I still have a large collection of physical video games, ranging from the NES to the SNES, Game Boy Advance, Dreamcast, PS1 and beyond.\n\nCustomers have way less control over their media when it’s all-digital, but damn, is it tidy and easy to keep my 8TB PS5 SSD loaded with tons of digital games instead of storing copious clamshell cases. The less clutter, the better. That said, I own practically zero modern physical games, so I’m relying on Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to keep my purchase library access open, and that’s a bit unnerving.\n\nDo we know with absolute certainty that Best Buy’s abandonment of physical movies is the canary in the coal mine for physical video games? No, but the signs are certainly there. If I had to guess, I’d say that physical games will stick around in some capacity for a good while, but they’ll be relegated to hobbyist and collector websites like Playasia, Limited Run and the like. I mean, it’s sort of already happening, but I’m sure that market will continue to shrink and isolate.\n\nPast that, the future will likely be completely dominated by digital-only gaming. You can even see this starting to play out with the recently announced PlayStation 5 Slim and Xbox’s leaked cylindrical Brooklin console. Sony and Microsoft aren’t looking to preserve the past. The interest has never been there. They want to blaze into a new era where discs are exclusively antiquated relics of ancient times, and they already are if you ask any Zoomer. CDs are smudged frisbees to these monsters.\n\nThe collector in me pines for a more innocent time. The modern gamer in me cautiously celebrates the evolving technology. The preservationist in me is warning of the rapture.\n\nBrace yourself, folks. The the end is nigh. Buy a bigger hard drive."
