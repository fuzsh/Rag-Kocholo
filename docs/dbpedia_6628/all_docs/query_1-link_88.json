Sadly, the game doesn't have a platinum to earn.\n\nSean Lawson\n\nPublished 08 Aug 2024\n\nFollowtopics\n\nThe Exit 8PLAYISMPlayStation 4Trophy ListSean Lawson\n\nWe have just picked up the The Exit 8 trophies â€” and the game is out now! With The Exit 8 PS4 trophy list revealed, players can look forward to unlocking a total of four trophies in this surprisingly short list. This may just make our list of PlayStation games without platinum trophies that we still recommend you check out!\n\nUpdate: A PS5 trophy list for The Exit 8 has also been revealed, and the game is available for purchase now on PS5 and PS4!\n\nThe Exit 8 PS4 trophy list revealed\n\nThe Exit 8 went viral all over the internet for its simple and engaging concept. You walk around the same corridors over and over again, trying to find anomalies. These anomalies can range from slight differences in the way posters look to full-on monsters chasing you. You need to keep your eyes peeled and your wits about you if you want to make it to Exit 8.\n\nThere are 4 trophies, 2 of which are hidden (to reveal the details of the secret trophies, please use this link). It's strange, as the two hidden trophies are connected to one of the trophies that isn't hidden. That other trophy asks you to see all of the anomalies in the game. The two hidden trophies will unlock when you have seen 10 and 20 anomalies respectively.\n\nThe remaining trophy will simply unlock for beating the game. So, there isn't much else to do in this game other than to keep playing it until you have all four trophies in your possession. It's a shame there isn't a platinum to earn, but in fairness, it's a very short game, so in this case we can give it a pass.\n\nYou can check out the full The Exit 8 trophy list below!\n\nThe Exit 8 trophy list\n\nName Description The Exit 8 Go out from Exit 8. Hidden Trophy Continue playing to unlock this trophy. Hidden Trophy Continue playing to unlock this trophy. Underground Passage Local Find all anomalies.\n\nThe Exit 8 is being developed by KOTAKE CREATE. What do you make of the tiny trophy list? Still excited to check this one out?
