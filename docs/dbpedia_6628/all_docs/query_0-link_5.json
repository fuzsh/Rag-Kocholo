        "text": "Overview of the events of 2001 in video games\n\nList of years in video games\n\n+...\n\n2001 saw many sequels and prequels in video games, such as Madden NFL 2002, NBA Live 2002, NBA 2K2, WWF Smackdown! Just Bring It, Capcom vs. SNK 2, Dead or Alive 3, Final Fantasy X, Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec, Grand Theft Auto III, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Myst III: Exile, Crazy Taxi 2, SSX Tricky, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Sonic Adventure 2, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, and Virtua Fighter 4. New intellectual properties include Ace Attorney, Advance Wars, Animal Crossing, Burnout, Gothic, Black & White, Devil May Cry, Fatal Frame, Ghost Recon, Halo, Jak and Daxter, Max Payne, Oni, Onimusha: Warlords, Operation Flashpoint, Pikmin, Pro Evolution Soccer, Red Faction, Serious Sam, and Tropico.\n\nThree major video game systems were released in 2001: the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance by Nintendo, and the Xbox by Microsoft.[1] Sega, which had been a major competitor in the video game hardware market to this point, ended its involvement in the market after the failure of the Dreamcast.[2] The year 2001 is remembered for its influence on the video game industry with the release of many games recognized as classics.[3][4] Many video games released in 2001 defined or redefined their respective genres, including hack and slash game Devil May Cry,[5][6] first-person shooter game Halo: Combat Evolved,[7][8] and open world action-adventure game Grand Theft Auto III, which is regarded as an industry-defining work.[9][10]\n\nThe year has been retrospectively considered one of the best and most important in video game history due to the release of numerous critically acclaimed, commercially successful and influential titles across all platforms and genres at the time. It was the peak year for the sixth generation of video game consoles, with the launch of the GameCube and Xbox, the latter focusing on online games (following SegaNet the previous year), and the Dreamcast's last year of production with Sega's exit from console manufacturing. Storytelling and mature themes also became a more mainstream trend.[11][12] The year's best-selling video game worldwide was Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal, the fourth year in a row for the Pokémon series (since 1998). The year's most critically acclaimed titles were Gran Turismo 3 and Final Fantasy X in Japan, and Halo and Grand Theft Auto III in the West.\n\nHardware releases\n\n[edit]\n\nMonth Day Console March 21 Game Boy Advance September 14 GameCube November 15 Xbox\n\nTop-rated games\n\n[edit]\n\nMajor awards\n\n[edit]\n\nCritically acclaimed titles\n\n[edit]\n\nFamitsu Platinum Hall of Fame\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Japan, the following video game releases in 2001 entered Famitsu magazine's \"Platinum Hall of Fame\" for receiving Famitsu scores of at least 35 out of 40.[13]\n\nTitle Platform(s) Publisher Genre Score (out of 40) Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec PlayStation 2 Sony Racing simulation 39 Final Fantasy X PlayStation 2 Squaresoft Role-playing 39 Fushigi no Dungeon: Fūrai no Shiren GB2 Game Boy Color Chunsoft Roguelike 38 Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty PlayStation 2 Konami Stealth 38 Culdcept Second Dreamcast Media Factory Turn-based strategy 37 Dai Rantō Smash Brothers DX (Super Smash Bros.
