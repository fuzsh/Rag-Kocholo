It was first released on Apple Arcade on September 17, 2019 followed by a release on PC and Switch on March 17, 2020, and for PS4 and Xbox One on November 13, 2020.\n\nAbout[ | ]\n\nExit the Gungeon is a small, arcade-style, spin-off 'dungeon climber' that immediately follows the adventures of the misfit Gungeoneers attempting to survive a series of increasingly dangerous elevators and countless waves of enemies. In contrast to Enter the Gungeon's top-down perspective, Exit the Gungeon is a sidescrolling platformer.\n\nExit the Gungeon is a bullet hell dungeon climber immediately following the adventures of the misfit ‘Gungeoneers’ and their journey for personal absolution in Enter the Gungeon. The Gungeon has become a paradox and is collapsing! Armed with an ever-changing weapon, an insatiable need to loot, and the trusty dodge roll, each of our heroes must ascend and escape via their own unique route of increasingly perilous elevators. Battle against the last and most bitter of the Gundead at a frantic pace, slowing down just long enough to chat with some familiar faces… and a few new ones. Shifting rooms, enemies, bosses, bizarre weapons and items all combine to ensure that no two attempts to Exit the Gungeon are the same.\n\nAlso, you can wear hats. Everybody loves hats, and spin-offs, which this game is... of Enter the Gungeon.\n\nPlot[ | ]\n\nExit the Gungeon takes place immediately after the events of the Gunslinger's past. Having succeeded in his mission, the Gunslinger killed his future self, the Lich, and rewrote history, causing the Gungeon to never form. Unfortunately, this created a fractured timeline, and now the Gungeon has become a paradox, and begins to crumble. With no time to go back the way they came, the Gungeoneers must fight to ascend the Gungeon and escape with their lives, while fighting off the very last of the Gundead and embittered bosses returning for their revenge, as well as some new ones.\n\nGame support[ | ]\n\nFor game support, see the official reddit or Discord.\n\nTopics[ | ]"
