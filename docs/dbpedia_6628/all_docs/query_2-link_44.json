        "text": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is an asymmetrical multiplayer horror experience based on the groundbreaking and iconic 1974 horror film.[1]\n\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre The Game was released on August 18, 2023\n\nGameplay[]\n\nIn this horror video game, unlike Gun Medias previous Slasher video game project, The Slaughter Family can not be killed, and that combat is not the most logical method for players, but that stealth is the best strategy. [2]\n\nThe game has been confirmed to be a 3 Vs 4 asymmetrical horror survival, with three killers vs four survivors. [3]\n\nGun Media made confirmation there will be no \"Hero Character\" for Texas Chain Saw Massacre the Game.[4]\n\nInformation[]\n\nWelcome to the Family: Gun set out to once again put players in control of some of the most notorious names in horror. This time around, we brought the whole family.\n\nThe Art of Authenticity: Authenticity is a vital part of what we do here at Gun. But that authenticity runs deeper than just Hero Art. For The Texas Chain Saw Massacre we didn’t just recreate locations and characters, we recreated a whole time and place in Texas.\n\nConceptual Sound: Crafting an updated and inspired game score based off the iconic sound design of the 1974 original film would be no simple task. Have a quick read on how Gun approached this and the haunted noise box that became a major part of the score. [5]\n\nThe Slaughter Family[]\n\nLeatherface\n\nThe Cook\n\nThe Hitchhiker\n\nGrandpa\n\nSissy\n\nJohnny\n\nNancy [6]\n\nHands\n\nThe Victims[]\n\nAna Flores: Ana is fiercely motivated and a natural leader. After losing her father, she and her sister Maria help to take care of their mother, while trying to forge their own paths as well.[7] Now with Maria missing, Ana is done sitting idly by while law enforcement stumbles along. Determination and sheer willpower are her strongest suits, and she’ll need every ounce of her resilience to endure.\n\nLeland McKinney: While Leland might have wrestled in high school, college life is a long way from high school and his glory days of wrestling. Still, he is the toughest of the group, but what he has in strength he lacks elsewhere. A native Texan and bit of a tough guy, but still no match one on one against the likes of the Slaughter Family and therefore his capabilities benefit from teamwork with his peers.\n\nSonny Williams: Sonny might have a slightly smaller frame, but he more than makes up for that with his intellect. The best student of the bunch is not only book smart, he’s quick on his feet and quick with his decisions. Perceptive and intuitive, exceptionally situationally aware, Sonny will need to rely on his intelligence if he’s to survive, and his friends would be equally wise to reap the benefits of his abilities.\n\nJulie Crawford: Julie is a Southern California native and fits every bit of what that description might bring to mind. Sand, surf, and sport lifestyle. But whether or not her life to this point has prepared her for the stress and strain of the experience that requires an entirely different type of toughness remains to be seen. Will her physical abilities be enough to carry her through an absolute nightmare unlike any other?\n\nConnie Taylor: Connie comes from a life on the farm, where she never shied away from the work that went along with it. While not quite what you’d imagine a tomboy to be, Connie relishes in being the type of person that will surprise you with her skills. She’s crafty, intelligent, and ingenuitive. A natural tinkerer, her skills are more surgical than strong arm.\n\nDanny Gaines: Danny grew up severely disadvantaged, bouncing between numerous foster homes before finally landing with a proper caretaker. His rough exterior is a reflection of this upbringing, but beneath it lies an intelligent and caring person. After meeting Maria, the two connected deeply, becoming nearly inseparable. Heartbroken and devastated that he didn't accompany Maria on her wildflower trip, Danny headed towards Newt, TX immediately after her disappearance, refusing to wait for the others.\n\nVirginia: Haunted by the disappearance of her son years ago, Virginia left her nursing career behind and moved to Newt, TX, refusing to accept that her son is really gone. She spends every waking hour obsessing, scouring remote areas, talking to anyone who could potentially shed light on why Jesse suddenly vanished. One day after noticing unusual behavior near a remote farmhouse, Virginia took it upon herself to investigate the property. But instead of finding Jesse, what she discovered was Maria, beaten and tortured, barely clinging to life. As the pair attempted to escape, they were immediately surrounded and captured. Now Virginia finds herself trapped in a different kind of nightmare.\n\n“When you take care to build out the personalities of this group of diverse but connected people, all of whom are emotionally invested in the search for Maria and bringing their own unique experiences and strengths to the group, their in-game abilities start to form organically. You’ve put so much into who they are that you start to visualize how they are: How will they react? What would they do in this situation they find themselves in? From there, it really becomes a matter of design and iteration to take those attributes and traits from their backstories and into their ultimate role in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.”\n\n–Ronnie Hobbs, Creative Director, Gun Interactive [8]\n\nWarning: The Characters Profiles that aren't made will be created only ONCE the game is released for Full Name Purposes.\n\nMaps[]\n\nFamily House\n\nGas Station\n\nSlaughterhouse\n\nNancy's House\n\nThe Mill\n\n“When choosing and designing the levels, we knew we wanted players to really experience the iconic locations from the original movie as well as add our own stamp on the franchise. These are key locations for the Family and their Victims and it would not be The Texas Chain Saw Massacre without them. We wanted to allow the players to not just enter, but more importantly, fully explore and feel those places and how macabre they are, discovering not just what the movie showed, but the areas hidden from view. We get to explore a huge range of possible environmental questions. What would be behind this door? What spaces have this Family of killers created? How do the Family live in these spaces? How have they constructed these areas? That’s where the real fun begins and where the designers and artists get to play. Working with our art and design team here at Sumo and the awesome folks at Gun, nothing has been left unturned in the authenticity department. We know that the fans are going to compare and analyze what we have made with the movie, and I think I can say that everyone on the project has brought their A-game to bring as much detail as humanly possible to the game. I’m very proud of what the team has created.”\n\n–Steve Kirby, Lead Designer, Sumo Digital - Nottingham[9]\n\nReviews[]\n\nComing Soon...\n\nRatings[]\n\nTo be answered...\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn this game they won't be named \"The Sawyers\" but will be named after their original last name from the original script \"The Slaughters\".[10]\n\nThe game was thought to have been a Halloween the Video Game by fans, but some had already been stating it to be a TCM based game, which turned out to be true.\n\nUnlike Friday the 13th the Game by Gun Media, this game is not a fan funded project.\n\nMattshota confirms that Grandpa will be in the game on Reddit.\n\nUnlike their previous slasher based video game, this game will not have a Hero type character like with Tommy Jarvis.\n\nDespite the previous statements the game will be on both Previous and Current Gen consoles.\n\nSally Hardesty the final girl of the original movie isn't within the game."
