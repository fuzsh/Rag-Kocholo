        "text": "Jeff Bezos might be stepping down as Amazon’s CEO, but the company will still stay committed to making more video games.\n\nREAD MORE: Video games haven’t just been escapism for me in 2020, it’s been a lifeline\n\nThis is according to an email from incoming CEO Andy Jassy, who has expressed his support for Amazon Game Studios despite its troubled history. For context, last year the developer released the online shooter Crucible, which flopped so badly that the studio unreleased the game and subsequently cancelled it. On the other hand, its fantasy MMORPG New World has been delayed multiple times.\n\n“Some businesses take off in the first year, and others take many years,” Jassy wrote, according to emails seen by Bloomberg. “Though we haven’t consistently succeeded yet in AGS, I believe we will if we hang in there.”\n\n“Being successful right away is obviously less stressful, but when it takes longer, it’s often sweeter. I believe this team will get there if we stay focused on what matters most,” added Jassy, who is currently head of Amazon’s cloud computing division and also the boss of Amazon Game Studios head Mike Frazzini.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJassy’s email also arrived shortly after Google announced that it was shutting down its internal Stadia game developer studios. Last week, the tech giant said that it would “not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from our internal development team […] beyond any near-term planned games”."
