        "text": "The Exit 8 is an incredibly unique and massively memorable experience, and for the price of a coffee it's very easy to recommend.\n\nRead full review\n\nThe Exit 8 is a unique and interesting experience, but not one of substance. The “hidden object” gameplay is very shallow and was designed to be picked up and played by anybody with eyes, thumbs, and index fingers. This is a novel and amusing distraction that works as intended and earns a few good chills when played in the dead of a silent night.\n\nRead full review\n\nThe Exit 8 is a short horror experience that feels more like an introduction to VR psychological horrors than anything else.\n\nRead full review\n\nIt’s a clever little title, handles well on the Switch and comes in at the same price as a Happy Meal. While it won’t blow away critics at the end of the year, The Exit 8 is memorable and serves as a good proof of concept, like how P.T. once captivated players across the world with unspeakable dread.\n\nRead full review"
