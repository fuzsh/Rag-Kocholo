We see our place in the market as proving that there is a place for physical, whether that be the collector's editions, which we see as the vinyl of video games, or the gifter who doesn't want to wrap up a download code for Christmas.\n\n\"But we need to be realistic. We have a business to run and the expectation is this will decline. So we need to fill that gap.\""
