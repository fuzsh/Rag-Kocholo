        "text": "I'm new to linux and everything is so difficult. I did try and am still trying to figure things out.\n\nI checked my nvidia graphics driver and it is updated to the latest.\n\n(Read nvidia might cause problem though in linux.)\n\nI have wine installed. Is the WINE program outdated in Software of zorin ? I think I've read that it's better to download through terminal.\n\nI just checked and wine on zorin software right now is wine 6.0 and I found that wine 8.0 is out in the official website. maybe this is the cause ?\n\nI need to know how to install through terminal.\n\nAlso wasn't sure if I need direct x , windows redistributables the c++ since this is\n\nlinux and not windows anymore but I do have wine so I just installed all of them just like I need them in windows. and since wine makes it work and most games are windows version, I thought I need it. I didn't wanted to if possible but installed. redistributables all of them from 2005 to 2017.\n\nStill none of the games are working after installing and restarting.\n\nNormally in windows this is all I need to run any games.\n\nI wonder what I'm missing to fix any of the problems. Any basic thing\n\nI missed to install ?\n\nThere's a game where I could run the game and see the logo,\n\nand a game logo with game title right before pressing a key to start the menu screen to load.\n\nI can see the new game, load, options, exit.\n\nbut there's a black part besides those buttons. where it probably should be some background image.\n\nThen I would start new game, and I can hear the sound, I also can see the\n\ncharacter face with dialogue. I was thinking everything is perfect until after\n\nthe dialogues end, it's complete black screen with background music and\n\ncharacter's making sounds as they are swinging their weapon when clicking mouse.\n\nWhich means the black screen with the dialogues, there wasn't supposed to be\n\na black screen. Made me think it was pitch black dark place at first.\n\nAnother game I could run is completely black screen. Background music plays.\n\nI would hover my mouse on top right and I can hear the sound as I move around\n\nthe menu buttons.\n\nAnother game I could run just shows a \"Launcher\". (like lutris or steam.)\n\nThen the launcher doesn't have any menu, blank. No play button.\n\nThere are a lot of launcher ? like programs such as play on linux (probably installed when installing wine) , lutris , steam and on.\n\nI mean if you are gonna install games after downloading them through steam then you might use these. but if you are just installing games that has nothing to do with steam ? are these still required ?\n\nIt's not an emulator though. So if I use these to install the game will work unlike if I installed through wine ?\n\nWine can be used to install any windows game and programs so why won't anybody say anything about using wine to just simply install games like they do in windows ? Why do they always mention steam ? Besides from it being like a\n\nall in one online get any game and some support of proton thing ?"
