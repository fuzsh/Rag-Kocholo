Fernández's journey into filmmaking began after leaving Mexico for the United States, where he worked various jobs before entering the film industry. He was inspired by the works of Sergei Eisenstein, which motivated him to pursue a career in filmmaking. Returning to Mexico in 1933, he initially worked odd jobs before making his debut as a director in 1941 with \"La Isla de la Pasión.\" His collaboration with notable figures like cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa and actors Dolores del Río, Pedro Armendáriz, and María Félix produced iconic films such as \"María Candelaria,\" \"La Perla,\" \"Enamorada,\" and \"Río Escondido.\" While Fernández directed numerous films, he also excelled as an actor, appearing in both Mexican and Hollywood productions, collaborating with directors like John Huston and Sam Peckinpah in movies like \"The Night of the Iguana\" (1964) and \"The Wild Bunch\" (1969). Fernández's cinematic legacy earned accolades and recognition, including the Ariel Award and the addition of \"La Perla\" to the US National Film Registry.
