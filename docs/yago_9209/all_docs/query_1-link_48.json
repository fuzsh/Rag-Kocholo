        "text": "Noir City\n\nThe music, the characters, the confrontations, the emotions—all boil over in this Mexican version of noir dubbed rumberas. Sexy Ninón Sevilla dances up a storm in a club all while dodging a vicious pimp, defying her boss, and rescuing an abandoned baby from the trash. New 4K Restoration.\n\nIndividual Tickets: $16 | $11 SIFF Members - Select showtime to purchase\n\nPasses: $150 | $125 SIFF Members\n\nThis film virtually leaps off the screen. The music, the characters, the confrontations, the emotions: they boil over the top in this uniquely Mexican version of noir dubbed rumberas, films depicting the hard luck life of nightclub entertainers. And no one is more troubled and volatile than sexy Cuban rumba dancer Ninón Sevilla. As Violeta, she dances up a storm in a club featuring some of Latin America’s top performers—Pérez Prado, Rita Montaner and Pedro Vargas appear. While dodging the abuse of a vicious pimp, our golden-hearted hussy rescues an abandoned baby from the trash, defies her boss, loses her job, and is forced into prostitution. Noir teaches that life is unfair, especially for Mexican nightclub entertainers. Rumberas attracted Mexico’s top cinema talent, including the nation’s most famous director, Emilio Fernández, as well as legendary cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa. As André Breton is reputed to have said, “In Europe we talk about surrealism, in Mexico they live it every day.” —Film synopsis courtesy of Noir City"
