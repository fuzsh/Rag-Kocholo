Influenced by Eisenstein’s ¡Que Viva México!, and taught by Citizen Kane’s Gregg Toland, Figueroa worked with every luminary at home — including directors Fernández, Roberto Gavaldón, and Luis Buñuel and legendary diva María Félix — and internationally with John Huston, John Ford, Don Siegel, and Clint Eastwood — and was often accounted Mexico’s fourth great muralist along with Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco; and nominated for Mexico’s Oscar, the Ariel Award, every year from 1946 to 1954, 11 nominations overall, winning 7 times (once against himself). No cameraman has ever dominated a national cinema as he did or created so majestic and instantly recognizable an image of it.\nPresented in conjunction with “UNDER THE MEXICAN SKY: GABRIEL FIGUEROA — ART AND FILM,” AN EXHIBITION AT EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO (FIFTH AVENUE AT 104TH STREET), ON VIEW THROUGH JUNE 27.\nSpecial thanks to MAURICIO MAILLÉ, FERNANDO OSORIO (FUNDACIÓN TELEVISA), JORGE DANIEL VENECIANO, STEPHANIE SPAHR, ROSE MARY CORTES, ROSARIO CALATAYUD-SERNA, CAROLINA ALVAREZ-MATHIES, MAYA SHUGART (EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO), CARLOS GUTIÉRREZ, RAÚL GUZMÁN (CINEMA TROPICAL), CATERINA TOSCANO (MEXICAN CULTURAL INSTITUTE OF NEW YORK), JAIME JAIMES (MEXICAN SECRETARIAT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS), JOSÉ MANUEL GARCÍA (FILMOTECA DE LA UNAM), LYNANNE SCHWEIGHOFER (LIBRARY OF CONGRESS),\nPAUL GINSBURG (UNIVERSAL), MONA NAGAI (PACIFIC FILM ARCHIVE), HADEN GUEST (HARVARD FILM ARCHIVE),\nKITTY CLEARY (MoMA), TOM LUDDY, PETER MOORE, AND ANITA MONGA.",
