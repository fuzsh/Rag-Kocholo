Entered into competition at the third-ever Cannes Film Festival, the filmâs major platform helped launch Dominguez into international stardom, leading to opportunities in Europe, chances to work with world-renowned filmmakers such as Luis Buñuel, and a recording contract with RCA. DIRECTED/WRITTEN BY: Emilio Fernández. WITH: Columba Domínguez, Roberto Cañedo, Arturo Soto Rangel, Manuel Dondé. 1949. 111 min. Mexico. B&W. Spanish. DCP. Courtesy of Cineteca Nacional de México. Screening courtesy of Televisa FoundationâUnivision Foundation. Distinto amanecer ( Another Dawn ) Sun, Jul 14 | 2pm | TMT Directed by her brother Julio Bracho, screen sensation Andrea Palma (1903â1987) stars as defeated wife and secret sex worker Julieta in this classic film noir made during the first decade of Mexicoâs Golden Age of film production. Having worked in a Mexico City millinery in her teens, Palma could reflect on her lived urban experience for the role, her craft further honed after a short stint in Hollywood, where she worked alongside cousins Dolores del Río and Ramon Novarro. As lensed by the celebrated Gabriel Figueroa, Palma cements her rightful legacy as a major star of the period. DIRECTED BY: Julio Bracho. WRITTEN BY: Julio Bracho, Xavier Villaurrutia. WITH: Andrea Palma, Pedro Armendáriz, Alberto Galán, Narciso Busquets. 1943. 108 min. Mexico. B&W. Spanish. DCP. Courtesy of Cineteca Nacional de México. Screening courtesy of Televisa Foundationâ Univision Foundation.\n\nThis loose adaptation of Shakespeareâs The Taming of the Shrew boasts the pitch-perfect casting of María âLa Doñaâ Félix in one of her three Ariel- winning roles. Félix portrays Beatriz Peñafiel, the headstrong daughter of the wealthiest man in Cholula and revolutionary General Reyesâs (Pedro Armendáriz) thwarted object of desire. Entered into the Venice Film Festival, Enamorada was Félixâs first collaboration with director Emilio Fernández, and the filmmakerâs fourth project with renowned cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa. The romantic screwball comedy comes together thanks to the prolific Gloria Schoemann, the editor of the picture (and over 200 more) and one of the unsung damas of Mexicoâs Golden Age. DIRECTED BY: Emilio Fernández. WRITTEN BY: Emilio Fernández, Íñigo de Martino. WITH: María Félix, Pedro Armendáriz, Fernando Fernández, José Morcillo. 1946. 99 min. Mexico. B&W. Spanish. 4K DCP. Restored by UCLA Film & Television Archive and The Film Foundationâs World Cinema Project in collaboration with Fundacion Televisa AC and Filmoteca de la UNAM. Restoration funded by the Material World Charitable Foundation. Screening courtesy of Televisa FoundationâUnivision Foundation. Río Escondido ( Hidden River ) Nominated for 11 Ariel Awards and winner of 9, including Best Picture, Best Cinematography for Gabriel Figueroa, and Silver Ariels for actors María Félix, Jaime Jiménez Pons, and Carlos López Moctezuma, the sheer talent that contributed to every aspect of this melodrama about schoolteacher Rosaura (Félix) and her uphill battle to educate the youth in a rural village makes Río Escondido a high-water mark of Golden Age filmmaking. A quintessential weepie in the vein of so many Bette Davis and Joan Crawford melodramas that preceded it, Félix plays the martyr, but not before stealing the screen with her tour-de-force performance. DIRECTED BY: Emilio Fernández. WRITTEN BY: Emilio Fernández, Mauricio Magdaleno. WITH: María Félix, Carlos López Moctezuma, Fernando Fernández, Agustín Isunza. 1948. 110 min. Mexico. B&W. Spanish. DCP. Courtesy of Arte & Cultura del Centro Ricardo B. Salinas Pliego.\n\n18"
