        "text": "October 17, 2014–February 1, 2015\n\nExhibition of striking political art from the Mexican Taller de Gráfica Popular\n\nVida y Drama de México: Prints from the Monroe E. Price and Aimée Brown Price Collection presents a selection of works from the more than 125 Mexican prints and posters given or lent to the Yale University Art Gallery by Monroe E. Price, B.A. 1960, LL.B. 1964, and Aimée Brown Price, M.A. 1963, PH.D. 1972. Most of the objects were made at the Taller de Gráfica Popular (People’s Graphic Workshop), a collective printmaking workshop in Mexico City founded in 1937 by artists Leopoldo Méndez, Luis Arenal, and Pablo O’Higgins. The collective’s aim was to create art to improve the lives of peasants and laborers and to support social justice—goals of the Mexican Revolution (1910–20) that had not been fully realized. Although many artists at the time in both Europe and the United States had embraced abstraction, the Taller artists deliberately chose a representational style to create clear, direct messages that would reach the widest audience possible, and they used simple and inexpensive media. The exhibition takes its title from a 1957 poster by Alberto Beltrán, announcing an exhibition celebrating 20 years of the Taller de Gráfica Popular.\n\nThe 53 prints and posters in the exhibition, made by some 30 artists, represent the Taller’s major concerns. The fight against fascism was paramount during the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War, and a group of five striking posters advertising lectures against fascism—sponsored by an organization of German exiles in Mexico City—is one of the highlights of the exhibition. After those wars, the Taller artists continued to fight corruption and moneyed interests and to champion causes of those with little power, including agrarian reform, increased literacy, and workers’ rights. In “La risa del pueblo”: El retorno del “automóvil gris” (“The Laughter of the People”: The Return of the “Gray Automobile”; 1939), for instance, O’Higgins alluded to a film from 1919, based on a group of robbers active in Mexico City in 1915. In the image, four known public figures are depicted as gangsters making off with Articles 123 and 127 of the constitution of 1917, which limited corruption and protected workers’ rights. Posters celebrate popular presidents; although Benito Juárez, Mexican president from 1861 to 1872, and U.S. president Abraham Lincoln never met, in 1944 O’Higgins symbolized the friendship between their two countries by pairing the beloved leaders in the lithograph Buenos vecinos, buenos amigos (Good Neighbors, Good Friends). Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexican president when the Taller was founded, whose boldest action was the nationalization of oil production in 1938, was also a hero to the Taller artists, and a poster with four different images renders homage to him. There is no dearth of villains depicted in the show, including Porfirio Díaz, who ruled as a virtual dictator from 1876 to 1880 and from 1884 to 1911, favoring Europeans and the wealthy over indigenous Mexicans and the poor. At the end of his rule, stifled discontent erupted into the revolution.\n\nSuzanne Boorsch, the Robert L. Solley Curator of Prints and Drawings at the Gallery and cocurator of the exhibition, states, “The gift from Monroe E. Price and Aimée Brown Price has significantly enriched the Gallery’s holdings of Mexican works of art, and with this exhibition we are able to showcase numerous highly talented artists previously poorly represented—or not at all represented—in the collection.”\n\nMonroe E. Price, Director of the Center for Global Communication Studies at the Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania, credits his initial interest in collecting Taller prints to being married to an art historian, Aimée Brown Price, who most recently published an authoritative monograph on Pierre-Cécile Puvis de Chavannes (Yale University Press, 2010). The couple lived in Los Angeles for 16 years, getting to know some of the city’s Chicano artists, who viewed the Taller artists as artistic and intellectual models for their own work. Eventually, Monroe and Aimée traveled to Mexico City and visited the Taller, where they were struck not only by the powerful design of the works they saw but also by their political messages. In the words of Monroe Price, part of the attraction in collecting these prints was that they exemplified “so sturdy an effort to deploy art in the service of public interest and intense political purpose.”\n\nAs Lucy Gellman, the Florence B. Selden Fellow in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the Gallery and cocurator of the exhibition, explains, “These posters and prints in this exhibition are portals into an often overlooked, historically dynamic past, as well as timely sociopolitical texts. Their sharp visual commentary is still relevant in a period of fraught U.S.-Mexico relations, and hopefully, the exhibition’s overarching themes will be powerful catalysts for broader discussions.”\n\nRelated Programs\n\nOpening Event: Film Screening and Conversation\n\nThursday, October 16, 5:30 pm\n\n“The Taller de Gráfica Popular in Context”\n\nThe screening of An Artful Revolution: The Life and Art of the Taller de Gráfica Popular (2008) is followed by a conversation addressing the complex history and legacy of the Taller workshop.\n\nExhibition Tours\n\nFriday, October 17, 1:30 pm\n\nSuzanne Boorsch, the Robert L.
