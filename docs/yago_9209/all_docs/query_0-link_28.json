The reformist intentions are admirable, I suppose, but it often plays like the most gorgeously shot PSA.

It’s not deep until the final reel that Felix gets to stretch any acting muscle where melodrama inevitably raises its glorious(?)/ugly(?) head. Fernández would revisit this type of material in 1962 with Pueblito (Little Town).\n\n➡️ Emilio Fernández, Ranked"
