        "text": "The president of Mexico has his country and people at heart, and he is looking for solutions. He knew that education is the key to making his country a better place, that's why he targeted the educators and gave them special assignments. This is where maria Felix shows that she has interest in her village Rio Escondido and her nation as well. This shows how teachers have are very influential or is necessary for the development of a nation and even those in authority knew that and invested in that.\n\nNevertheless, even though there are people who want things to change there are people who will oppose these positive changes because they will not gain as much want as they want and probably loose some of their power because people have become aware of the injustice done to them like wise gain the ability to be on equal grounds with these unfair figures. This was the case of the selfish mean president of the municipal of Escondido. He recognized the talent of maria Felix and pretended he cared for the people and even her. This shows that we must be careful of people when the show certain changes quickly because they recognized talent , and don't fall for these changes but observe these person to make sure it was genuine changes , as in the case of the PM of the municipal , who did that because he liked maria Felix.\n\nUltimately, because of his double standards she was able to complete her task of gaining means and methods of helping her country. This also tells us we can also learn from our mistakes and from the people who are doing injustices in our communities and because of these local experiences we are therefore able to help other communities and ultimately nations."
