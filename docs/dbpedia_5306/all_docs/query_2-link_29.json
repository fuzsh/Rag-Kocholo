This week Paul Rivera and Maverick Carter sit down with Dana White, Sam Jay, Brent Faiyaz, Sean O'Malley, Wiz Khalifa, Steve-O and Sloane Stephens. Dana talks about what makes the UFC special and different from other sports, building the brand and not caring what others think. Sam Jay opens up about her growth as a comedian, stand-up stories while coming up in Boston and always being present. Brent discusses starting as a rapper before singing, his writing approach and being a music executive. O'Malley talks about how he first got into fighting, his preparation as a professional and how that approach informs his lifestyle. Wiz breaks down how he brings people together through music, why he first got into sparring and the benefits of martial arts. Steve-O reminisces on the Jackass era, craving attention and how he's evolved over the years. Sloane shares tennis stories, from her longest match to how she breaks down her opponents, and talks about taking her mom to a UFC event. A range of great conversations is throughout this one.

Stay tuned for new content on the way.\n\nHello, darkness, my old friend[^1]. That's what he said as he walked into the office for the first time. I was sitting in the morning sun[^2], feeling a bit out of place in the new environment. He introduced himself with, \"This is a story of a girl\"[^3], though obviously not about him. We laughed, and I thought, \"Once upon a time, not so long ago\"[^4], two strangers started their journey. We quickly found common ground. He said, \"Come gather 'round people, wherever you roam\"[^5]. I nodded and replied, \"I was working part-time in a five-and-dime\"[^6]. From that day, we became fast friends. He had a way of saying, \"Oh, what a night\"[^7], no matter how the day went. Every morning, he greeted me with, \"It's a beautiful day\"[^8]. Together, we faced the corporate grind, believing that with a little help from my friends[^9], we could get through anything. One afternoon, he turned to me and said, \"You can't always get what you want\"[^10]. We laughed, agreeing that, \"Here comes the sun\"[^11], always brightened the darkest times. As time passed, we started hanging out after work. He'd often say, \"Hey Jude, don't make it bad\"[^12], whenever I was down. In return, I'd remind him, \"Lean on me, when you're not strong\"[^13], and he did. We shared countless memories, from late-night talks to weekend adventures. I remember, \"It's been a long day without you, my friend\"[^14], when he was on vacation, but we always reconnected like no time had passed. One evening, as we sat by the fire, he said, \"If you're lost, you can look and you will find me\"[^15]. I smiled and replied, \"This will be our year, took a long time to come\"[^16]. Our friendship was unbreakable. Years turned into decades, and even as life changed, our bond remained strong. He once said, \"We've only just begun to live\"[^17], and I knew he was right. In the end, \"The love you take is equal to the love you make\"[^18]. --- [^1]: The Sound of Silence by Simon & Garfunkel [^2]: Dock of the Bay by Otis Redding [^3]: Absolutely (Story of a Girl) by Nine Days [^4]: Livin' on a Prayer by Bon Jovi [^5]: The Times They Are A-Changin' by Bob Dylan [^6]: Raspberry Beret by Prince [^7]: December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night) by The Four Seasons [^8]: Beautiful Day by U2 [^9]: With a Little Help from My Friends by The Beatles [^10]: You Can't Always Get What You Want by The Rolling Stones [^11]: Here Comes the Sun by The Beatles [^12]: Hey Jude by The Beatles [^13]: Lean on Me by Bill Withers [^14]: See You Again by Wiz Khalifa ft.

Al Freshko was born in the Philippines and move to San Francisco when he was a young boy. His roots in hip-hop, skateboarding, and graffiti go way back to the early 90s. He was around for the early Embarcadero days on the skateboard scene in San Francisco. He's been graffiti bombing notepads, walls, and buses for longer than he can remember. Later, he designed some of the biggest logos in the cannabis world such as the cookies “C,” Vibes, Doja, Diamond Supply, Wiz Khalifa, and the list goes on. We talked about the old days, the good times, and what's to come with his brand Elemonkey and the Number Runners movement! By the way, this guy is an insanely good mountain biker flies over scary jumps like he's a teenager!
