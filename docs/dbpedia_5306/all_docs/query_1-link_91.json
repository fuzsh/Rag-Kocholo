On it, YG sings like a drunk n***a that aspires to be a pimp. Wiz does save this s**t a little bit by blessing us with an aggressive verse that has him singing just a splash, but he doesn’t save it enough to make me want to add it to my music library. Nonetheless, I am thankful that these two n***as were able to finally join forces for a song.\n\nOVERALL RATING (2.5/5)"
