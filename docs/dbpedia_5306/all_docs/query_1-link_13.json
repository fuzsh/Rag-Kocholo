The review and photos.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR PHOTO GALLERY\n\nNo, the smoke hovering over Grand Rapids on Tuesday didn’t come solely from the Canadian wildfires.\n\nAfter all, hip hop’s Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa — with special guests the Ying Yang Twins — did their best to contribute to that, uh, smoke in their own sizzling way on Tuesday during a Grand Rapids tour stop at Van Andel Arena.\n\nThe pair delivered an unforgettable barrage of gangsta rap, hip hop and trap rap.\n\nWiz Khalifa took the stage after crowd-pleasing opening sets by the Ying Yang Twins and DJ Blackbeard. Bringing his son on stage and singing fan favorites such as “Black and Yellow,” Khalifa had everyone on their feet and ready to greet Snoop Dogg.\n\nFrom the opening salvo of “The Next Episode,” Snoop Dogg had the audience singing along, with the iconic 51-year-old California iconic rapper also unleashing some classic ’90s tracks as well as newer songs from “Gin and Juice” and rapping his verse in Katy Perry’s “California Gurls.”\n\nThe performance also incorporated a tribute to the late and legendary Tupac, with Snoop Dogg inducing the crowd to repeat the lines, “We love you, Tupac. We miss you, Tupac.”\n\n“This is my second time seeing Wiz and Snoop at one of their High School Reunion shows,” said fan Kuzari Olushola from Grand Rapids. “It’s an experience. They always bring it.”\n\nAnd bring it they did.\n\nFollowing Snoop Dogg’s solo performance, he retreated back stage only to return with Khalifa for a few final tear-jerking, fist-bumping songs.\n\nThe duo sang “See You Again,” which included an in-memoriam for rappers, musicians and other celebrities who’ve lost their lives. This accolade seamlessly transitioned into their finale, “Young, Wild & Free,” putting an energetic exclamation point on a memorable evening of rap."
