        "text": "Wiz Khalifa is proud for comrade Ty Dolla $ign for reaching new heights with the release of his Vultures 1 album.\n\nThe album in question, which the California native collaborated with Kanye West on, debuted at the top spot of the Billboard 200 chart this week.\n\nUpon learning about the accolade, the “Roll Up” hitmaker was thrilled to cheer on his friend, who joined the Taylor Gang Entertainment crew over a decade ago and is still at the forefront of the company’s website alongside Juicy J.\n\n“I’m super hype for Ty,” Wiz wrote on Twitter on Sunday (February 18). “Him and Ye’s album slaps uncontrollably.”\n\nAccording to Billboard, Vultures 1 earned 148,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, with 129,000 of that figure coming from streaming units (167.78 million on-demand streams in total), 18,000 from pure album sales and 1,000 from TEA (track equivalent album) units.\n\nKanye is now even with Bruce Springsteen and Barbra Streisand with 11 No. 1 albums to his name, with only Drake (13), Taylor Swift (13), JAY-Z (14) and The Beatles (19) ahead of him.\n\nThe album is Ty Dolla $ign’s first No. 1 and second Top 10 following 2020’s Featuring Ty Dolla $ign.\n\nYe reacted to the news by issuing a brief statement to Complex, saying: “It’s a beautiful time.” His teammate also celebrated the achievement on his Instagram Stories, posting a video of him lifting his index finger to the camera while silencing the naysayers.\n\nReleased in early February, Vultures 1 boasts uncredited appearances from Travis Scott, Playboi Carti, Lil Durk, Chris Brown, Freddie Gibbs, YG, Quavo, Rich The Kid and others.\n\nThe project was initially only available on streaming platforms and as a digital download through online retailers and Kanye West’s website. Physical versions of the album on CD and vinyl are set to be released at a later point, with Ye’s store currently accepting pre-orders.\n\nVultures 1 debuted at No. 1 despite encountering a series of issues. The album was temporarily removed from streaming services five days after its release due to a complaint from its initial distributor, FUGA.\n\n“On Friday, February 9, 2024, a long-standing FUGA client delivered the album Vultures 1 through the platform’s automated processes, violating our service agreement,” the company said. “Therefore, FUGA is actively working with its DSP partners and the client to remove Vultures 1 from our systems.”"
