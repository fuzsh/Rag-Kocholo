Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, Wilburn first became involved in music as part of the Dungeon Family collective, where he was nicknamed \"the Future\". After amassing a series of mixtapes between 2010 and 2011, Future signed a major record label deal with Epic Records and Rocko's A1 Recordings, which helped launch Future's own label imprint, Freebandz. He subsequently released his debut album, Pluto, in April 2012 to positive reviews. Future's second album, Honest, was released in April 2014, surpassing his debut on the album charts.\n\nBetween late 2014 and early 2015, he released a trio of mixtapes to critical praise: Monster (2014), Beast Mode (2015), and 56 Nights(2015). His next releases, DS2 (2015), What a Time to Be Alive (2015, in collaboration with Drake), Evol (2016), Future (2017) and Hndrxx (2017) all debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200. The latter two made him the first artist since 2014 to debut two albums in consecutive weeks atop of that chart. Future has also released several singles certified gold or higher by the RIAA, including \"Turn On the Lights\", \"Move That Dope\", \"Fuck Up Some Commas\", \"Where Ya At\", \"Jumpman\", \"Low Life\" and \"Mask Off\".\n\nContents[]\n\n1Life and career\n\n1.11983–2010: Early life and career beginnings\n\n1.22011–2014: Pluto and Honest\n\n1.32015–2016: DS2, What a Time to Be Alive and Evol\n\n1.42017–2018: Future, Hndrxx and Wrld On Drugs\n\n1.52019: The Wizrd\n\n2Musical style\n\n3Personal life\n\n4Discography\n\n4.1Studio albums\n\n4.2Collaborative mixtapes\n\n5Tours\n\n5.1Co-headlining\n\n6Awards and nominations\n\n7References\n\n8External links\n\nLife and career[]\n\n1983–2010: Early life and career beginnings[]\n\nNayvadius DeMun Wilburn[8] was born on November 20, 1983[8][9] in Atlanta, Georgia.[10][11][12] He began using his stage name while performing as one of the members of the musical collective The Dungeon Family, where he was nicknamed \"The Future\". His first cousin, record producer, and Dungeon Family member Rico Wade, encouraged him to sharpen his writing skills and pursue a career as a rapper. He attended Columbia High School. Future voices his praise of Wade's musical influence and instruction, calling him the \"mastermind\" behind his sound.[12] He soon came under the wing of Atlanta's own Rocko who signed him to his label A-1 Recordings. Since then his work ethic has driven him to his success.[13] From 2010 to early 2011, Future released a series of mixtapes including 1000, Dirty Sprite and True Story.[13][14] The latter included the single \"Tony Montana\", in reference to the Scarface film.[14][15] During that time, Future was also partnering with rapper Gucci Mane on their collaborative album Free Bricks, and co-wrote YC's single \"Racks\".[16][17] He gained popularity after his songs were played by DJ Esco at Magic City,[18] a strip club in Atlanta deemed \"largely responsible for launching the careers of artists.\"[19]\n\n2011–2014: Pluto and Honest[]\n\nMain articles: Pluto (Future album), Pluto 3D, Honest (Future album), and Monster (Future album)\n\nFuture signed a major label recording contract with Epic Records fellow American rapper Rocko's A1 Recordings, in September 2011, days before the release of his next mixtape, Streetz Calling.[20] The mixtape was described by XXL magazine as ranging from \"simple and soundly executed boasts\" to \"futuristic drinking and drugging jams\" to \"tales of the grind\".[17] A Pitchfork review remarked that on the mixtape Future comes \"as close as anyone to perfecting this thread of ringtone pop, where singing and rapping are practically the same thing, and conversing 100% through Auto-Tune doesn't mean you still can't talk about how you used to sell drugs. It would almost feel antiquated if Future weren't amassing hits, or if he weren't bringing some subtle new dimensions to the micro-genre.\"[15]\n\nFuture performing in 2014\n\nThough Future had told MTV that Streetz Calling would be his final mixtape prior to the release of his debut studio album, another mixtape, Astronaut Status, was released in January 2012. In December 2011, Future was featured on the cover of Issue #77 of The FADER.[21]Before his album being released in April 2012.[22][23] XXL's Troy Mathews wrote, \"While Astronaut Status is up and down and never really hits the highs like 'Racks', 'Tony Montana', and 'Magic' that fans have come to expect from Future, it’s apparent that he’s poised to continue the buzz of 2011 humming right along into 2012.\"[24] Future was selected to the annual XXL Freshmen list in early 2012.[25] His debut album Pluto, originally planned for January, was eventually released on April 17.[26][27] It included remixes of \"Tony Montana\" featuring Drake and \"Magic\" featuring T.I..[28] According to Future, \"'Magic' was the first record T.I. jumped on when he came outta jail. Like, he was out of jail a day and he jumped straight on the 'Magic' record without me even knowing about it.\"[28] The track became Future's first single to enter the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[29] Other collaborators on the album include Trae Tha Truth, R. Kelly and Snoop Dogg [30] On October 8, 2012, Pusha T released \"Pain\" featuring Future, the first single from his upcoming debut album.\n\nIt was announced that Future will be repackaging his debut album Pluto on November 27, 2012 under the name Pluto 3D featuring 3 new songs and 2 remix songs including the remix for \"Same Damn Time\" featuring Diddy and Ludacris, as well as his newest street single \"Neva End (Remix)\" featuring Kelly Rowland.[31] In 2012, Future wrote, produced and was featured on \"Loveeeeeee Song\" taken from Barbadian singer Rihanna's seventh studio album Unapologetic.\n\nOn January 15, 2013, Future released the compilation mixtape F.B.G.: The Movie which features the artists signed to his Freebandz label: Young Scooter, Slice9, Casino, Mexico Rann and Maceo. It was certified platinum for having over 250,000 downloads on popular mixtape site DatPiff.[32] Future said of his second studio album Future Hendrix it will be a more substantive musical affair than his debut album and features R&B music along with his usual \"street bangers\".

I wasn’t using it the way T-Pain was. I used it to rap because it makes my voice sound grittier. Now everybody wants to rap in Auto-Tune. Future’s not everybody.\"[62] Future's music has been characterized as trap music.[63]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nWilburn currently has five children with five different women: Jessica Smith, Brittni Mealy, India J, singer Ciara, and Joie Chavis.[64] He was engaged to Ciara in October 2013, but Ciara ended the engagement in August 2014 due to his infidelity.[65] Their son, Future Zahir Wilburn, was born on May 19, 2014.[66] His fifth child, Hendrix, was born on Christmas in 2018.[67]\n\nAs of 2016, Wilburn is being sued by both Jessica Smith and Ciara.

His mother, Shirley Williams, a former bank loan officer, was once in a gospel group, singing for Dottie Peoples. He grew up in a musical family as his uncle was an accomplished guitar player and one of his older sisters was a drum major in the Olympics.[2] While growing up, Mike Will was athletic, participating in a number of sports, including basketball, baseball, and football, with dreams of becoming a professional athlete.[3]\n\nHis life also centered around a love of hip hop music. Mike Will first developed his talent for music by re-playing popular instrumentals that he heard on the radio while he and his friends would freestyle to them.[2] In a number of interviews, Will has mentioned, in particular, re-playing the instrumental for \"Still Fly\", a popular song by the southern rap group Big Tymers, on a Casio brand keyboard, and has also mentioned re-playing \"Young'n (Holla Back)\" by New York rapper Fabolous on production equipment at a local music store.[4]\n\nAt age 14, Mike Will began to develop his own beats on a Korg ES1 beat machine, which his father bought for him as a Christmas present from the local music store Mars Music. As Mike Will became more accomplished, he also began to use production equipment, including the Korg Triton, the Akai MPC1000, the Yamaha Motif, and the Roland Fantom.[2] By the time Mike Will was 16, he was spending time at local recording studios in Atlanta, trying to shop his beats to established artists.[5] He was initially ignored, but eventually one of his beat tapes made its way into the hands of Gucci Mane, who then invited Mike Will to Patchwerk studios, an Atlanta recording studio.[5]\n\nUpon graduating high school, Mike Will enrolled at Georgia State University to pursue undergraduate studies mainly due to pressure from his parents, but chose to take a hiatus and eventually dropped out after several semesters, with a 3.1 GPA, to focus on his music career.[6] During this hiatus, he produced his first hit. Upon hearing one of his produced singles \"Tupac Back\" began to enjoy success on the Billboard rap and Hot 100 charts, Mike Will decided to quit school and focus on his music career full-time.[7] He has since advised aspiring music producers not to drop out of college if they are not sure of their own future career outcome or lacking a defined plan before entering the industry.[2]\n\nCareer[edit][]\n\n2011–2012: Production and mixtapes[edit][]\n\nIn an interview with XXL, Mike Will said, \"Gucci Mane was the first [major artist] to ever rap on my beat.\"[8] Mike Will first met Gucci Mane at Atlanta recording studio, PatchWerk Recording Studios, and upon introducing himself and giving Gucci Mane a CD of beats, Gucci Mane proceeded to freestyle over each of the instrumentals.[9] He then offered Mike Will $1,000 for one of his beats.[10] The two artists began releasing songs together, such as \"East Atlanta 6\", and a number of songs from Gucci Mane's mixtape, No Pad, No Pencil.[9] After developing this close relationship with Gucci Mane, he began working with other big-name Atlanta rappers such as Future, Waka Flocka Flame, Rocko, and 2 Chainz.[10]\n\nIn 2011, Mike Will released his first single, \"Tupac Back\", performed by Meek Mill and Rick Ross, from the compilation album Self Made Vol. 1.[11] The single was released on April 5, 2011 and peaked at #31 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Billboard chart.[12] This came after Mike Will submitted some of his beats to an A&R for Rick Ross' Maybach Music Grouplabel.[11]\n\nAlso in 2011, Mike Will worked with Atlanta rapper Future, producing several popular and noteworthy songs together, including \"Ain't No Way Around It\",[13] \"Itchin\", and three songs from Future's 2012 major label debut album Pluto: \"Neva End\", \"Truth Gonna Hurt You\", and \"Turn On the Lights\".[2] \"Turn On the Lights\" was promoted as a single, and to date has peaked at #2 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Billboard chart.[14]\n\nOn December 27, 2011, Mike Will released his first mixtape, Est. in 1989 (Last of a Dying Breed).[15] It was released in conjunction with popular mixtape website LiveMixtapes.com.[15] Est. in 1989 includes a mix of exclusive songs and songs from Mike Will's catalog, and features artists such as Gucci Mane & 1017 Brick Squad, Future, Waka Flocka Flame, Kanye West & GOOD Music, 2 Chainz, Lil Boosie, Ludacris, Lil Wayne.[16]\n\nOn March 23, 2012, Mike Will partnered with popular music site The FADER to announce the second installment of his mixtape series, Est. in 1989 Pt. 2, and to release the mixtape's first single, \"Back 2 the Basics\", which features his manager/rapper Gucci Mane, founder/CEO/president of Brick Squad and Waka Flocka Flame.[17] The project Est. in 1989 Pt. 2 features songs with Diddy, 2 Chainz, Juicy J, Future, Lil Wayne, T.I., Mac Miller, French Montana, Jeremih, and others.[18] The album was released again on July 24, 2012 in partnership with LiveMixtapes.com.[18]\n\nWill has also worked extensively with Atlanta rapper 2 Chainz, producing \"La La\", which features Busta Rhymes, from 2 Chainz, then known as Tity Boi, Codeine Cowboy mixtape and \"Got One\" from 2 Chainz's T.R.U.
