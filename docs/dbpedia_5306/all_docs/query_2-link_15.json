        "text": "Red Rocks is one of the first things out-of-state students learn about when they come to CU. If they’re like me who hadn’t heard of the venue before becoming a buff, they’re truly not aware of the magic of Red Rocks. Its impossible to understand the wonder of Red Rocks until you’re standing at one of the top rows of the steep bleachers looking out at the beautiful Colorado landscape and listening to one of your favorite artists or bands. I experienced the spectacle of Red Rocks for the first time in April of my freshman year at CU and created memories there that I will never forget.\n\nI spent $70 on a ticket for a show that included performances by Smoke DZA, Y.G., Wiz Khalifa, and Snoop Dogg. It wasn’t by accident that the concert happened to be the weekend of 4/20, especially since the official title of the concert was ‘Snoop’s 4/20 Wellness Retreat’. It was an unusual way to spend my first Easter away from home, but I knew it was an event I couldn’t pass up. The opportunity to see some of my favorite artists, most notably Snoop Dogg who is amongst some of the best rappers of all time, and experience my first show at Red Rocks was undeniable. I had seen Wiz Khalifa perform in California about a year prior so I knew what to expect from his performance. I was unsure about what to expect from Snoop Dogg, however, as he had been getting older and I had not been a huge fan of his most recent batch of music. Regardless, I was excited about the opportunity to see an all-time great and experience what the hype was really all about at Red Rocks.\n\nWe arrived at the venue around 5 P.M. after taking party bus from Boulder to Morrison. By the time we made our way into Red Rocks, Smoke DZA had already begun performing and the rain/snow combination was at its peak. The bleachers were mostly empty because of the unfavorable weather. People had flocked to the minimal amount of covered area and lingered around until Y.G. came on stage and got the crowd’s blood flowing. His style of rap is perfect for warming up a crowd with his deep, danceable beats and catchy flows about partying and drinking. At this point in the night, we were about right in the middle between the top and bottom rows of the elevated bleachers. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to experience the scenic backdrop everyone raves about because of the darkness.\n\nSnoop Dogg’s performance stood out to me as the best of the night because of his ability to keep the entire crowd involved and engaged, which is a common trait among great musical performers. His movement and full use of the stage kept the crowd from top to bottom interested along with his perfect blend of old classics and newer hits. The mixture of green and white flashing lights projected onto the enclosing rocks provided a nice complement to the smoker-friendly classics that made Snoop one of the most popular stoners of all time. Overall, my first experience at Red Rocks was highlighted by great performances, terrible weather, and an unbeatable atmosphere that never seems to be absent from such an incredible musical setting.\n\nThe evolution of popular music made its invasion of Red Rocks in the early 2010’s with the emergence of a new musical genre: electronic dance music. The two factors that heavily influenced the rise of this new genre were the development of new synthesizing technology and the constantly increasing following of EDM festivals. Red Rocks has felt the effects of the genre’s takeover of popular music and subsequently catered to the Denver area’s large following consisting of mostly 18-25 year olds and students of colleges around Denver. The venue consistently hosts some of the biggest names in EDM such as Big Gigantic, Flume, Skrillex, and Flosstradamus.\n\nThe increase in electronic shows played at Red Rocks reflects the venue’s conformity to current popular music’s favored genre and evolution alongside the evolution of popular music around the country. The setting and overall atmosphere of Red Rocks is distinctly different during an EDM concert than a traditional rock band or rap group playing at the venue, both in sound and visual appeal. The shows feature deep booming bass, loud synthesizer effects, and bright laser shows complementing the chaotic series’ of beats and songs. The festivals and shows are often associated with “party drugs” like ecstasy and adderall, among other methamphetamines. The ties to drugs and the effects they have had on the young people that attend EDM shows has been widely criticized after several drug-related deaths at other events across the U.S. The drug culture has not been the only criticism and backlash EDM concerts have faced as of late, however.\n\nIn 2015, Red Rocks officials and the town of Morrison made an important decision that would ultimately affect the quality and quantity of future EDM concerts at the venue. The decision to enact bass and volume limits and regulations at Red Rocks came after the residents of Morrison living nearby the venue complained about excessive party noise coming from the frequent EDM shows. Several EDM artists at the top of Red Rocks official ticket sales denounced the new noise restrictions, claiming the venue was sacrificing the overall quality of the sound and shows. In response to the artist, Bassnectar’s social media comments regarding the effect a reduced bass has on the sound quality of an EDM show, the Red Rocks marketing and communications director stated: “… the history of Red Rocks is the history of pop culture in the United States, and EDM is a big part of that. We are absolutely not trying to ban EDM, but we have a responsibility to neighbors, and we put in restrictions in place that we thought were fair.” The restrictions have caused ongoing tensions between the EDM concert-goers and the surrounding Morrison community about the assumed protected rights of such a premiere concert venue and what constitutes an excessive noise disturbance.\n\nDespite the recent setbacks of EDM shows at Red Rocks, the genre continues to make its presence known at the venue as more concerts continue to be scheduled for the 2016 lineup that includes Disclosure, Flume, and Big Gigantic’s annual Rowdy Town event. Though it may sound a little different than prior EDM concerts, the sentiment and atmosphere of being a part of that type of show will certainly remain unchanged.\n\n– Zack Reyes\n\nConstructing an amphitheater from a mountain is no small task. Local and federal governments needed to work together and many bureaucratic and other less predictable hurdles needed to be surmounted. The visionaries who dreamed and initiated the project were courageous innovators indeed. They did not have electricity or heavy machinery. They relied on hundreds of individuals to move or remove tons of dirt and rocks. Some demolition involving dynamite would be a necessary part of this project. Given the imprecise nature of dynamite, it was lucky they were able to destroy only designated areas and not accidentally blow up a mountain. Besides the labor, the funding of construction must have been a juggernaut as well. Imagine convincing multiple layers of bureaucrats of the value of transforming a rocky hillside into a sonic masterpiece. Luckily the natural acoustics have strong convincing power all their own and the music lovers who believed in the project were steadfast, precise and financially successful, socially successful or both.\n\nWhen a person visits the mountains, the Redwoods, Niagara Falls, the oceans, or any massive aspect of nature, they often often realize their own minuscule insignificance. These people in the early 1900’s must have felt like tiny giants as they carved a masterpiece out of a mountain. Still this was not a project involving instant gratification. Denver architects Burnham Hoyt and Stanley Morse took years to develop the plans. After which, there were years of construction before Red Rocks would look anything like the amphitheater we know and love today. Fortunately, the Library of Congress & The Denver Library Photo Archives have some amazing pictures that give a modern person some perspective as to the scale of this enormous undertaking. Nature had invested literally millions of years forming this landscape and in less than a decade, man would transform it again.\n\n“Before the Rocky Mountains rose west of present-day Denver, Colorado, the massive red sedimentary formations that give Red Rocks Park its name formed from the ancestral Rocky Mountains. Three hundred million years ago, the predecessor to today’s range stood thirty or forty miles west of the current Front Range of the Rockies. During the Pennsylvanian Period, water, wind, and ice began to erode these mountains, and eastward-flowing rivers deposited their sediment in large alluvial fans, called the Fountain Formation. Sixty- five million years ago, when today’s mountain range began to rise during the Laramide orogeny, the Fountain Formation bed was uplifted on its edge, creating magnificent “rock gardens” along Colorado’s Front Range.” Red Rocks Park, Mount Morrison Civilian Conservation Corps Camp, 300 Union Avenue, Morrison, Jefferson County, CO. Historic American Landscapes Survey\n\nThe first person to own the Red Rocks area was John Brisbane Walker, likely purchasing many small plots of land from various landowners. He vigorously promoted the concept of using the Red Rocks area as a community park and performance venue. He constructed roads, hiking trails and a tea house before the City of Denver acquired the land in 1928. However, even a city as large as Denver could not take on such a gigantic project alone. Luckily, President Roosevelt’s New Deal had funded the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Project Administration to help America recover from the Great Depression and to preserve beautiful natural areas for future generations. Although technically situated as the jewel of the Denver Mountain Parks, The U.S. National Park Service played a prominent role overseeing the development and construction of Red Rocks Park. Together, these federal programs cooperated with local Denver organizations to design and construct the most beautiful natural amphitheater in the world. And of course, none of this would have been possible without the strength, fortitude and skills of hundreds of manual laborers who were the real creative force behind Red Rocks Amphitheatre.\n\nIn 1929, workers spent a year constructing a road with steam shovels, dynamite and mule drawn wagons that would stretch 5 miles through Red Rocks Park. In 1936, after official approval by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, construction of the Amphitheatre began in earnest. First more roads and bridges were built or resloped, then parking areas needed to be leveled. Next, the stage area was constructed and then demolition of the mountainside and construction of a seating area occurred. Approximately 200 workers earned a dollar a day to help construct this masterpiece, those were considered good wages during a time of few employment opportunities. The men, mostly veterans, lived near the construction site in temporary barracks and after the original efforts of manual labor, were able to continue on as craftsmen learning specific trades such as carpentry and stone masonry. Still, the massive amount of manual labor is not to be easily dismissed. Red Rocks is a testament to the value of individual work and the momentous accomplishments possible when we cooperate with one another.\n\n“The amphitheatre project required them to remove 25,000 cubic yards of rock and dirt and used 90,000 square feet of flagstone, ten carloads of cement, 800 tons of quarried stone, and 30,000 pounds of reinforced steel.” Building The Ampitheatre\n\nBesides the stumbling block of unearthing immovable rock ledges by Creation Rock and needing to revamp the seating plans to be asymmetrical, there were no major tragedies or misfortunes during construction. This was due in part to the painstaking revision process by architect Morse who was reputed to visit the site daily and revise plans throughout the construction phase. He is even noted as remarking that the plans for the theatre were not fully complete until the construction was finished. Due in part to the phenomenal size of this project, it was broken up into many small pieces which were completed and the master plan was reevaluated and progress continued thusly. Without the revision process, construction could easily have been a disaster.\n\nRed Rocks is a fascinating study in the possibility of great accomplishments resulting from many individual efforts. This gorgeous wonder could not have been created by one person or even one state. It took multiple government agencies and countless individuals to create Red Rocks Park and Amphitheatre. The story of Red Rocks is as intriguing as the venue itself. I can only imagine the awe some of the workers must have felt during the years they lived next to the giant rocks while they created a space where millions of people from future generations would be able to commune with nature and each other for decades, if not centuries, after the builders themselves were long gone. How can we ever thank our predecessors and ancestors for the gifts they have created for our viewing and listening pleasure?\n\nRed Rocks has consistently kept up with the lasting evolution of music throughout the years. The shows featured at the venue often reflect the current status of popular music genres and through this, can act as a time stamp throughout the progression of music’s evolution.\n\nThis attribute of Red Rocks has been represented throughout different phases of musical evolution in the 1960s, 80s, 90s, and now. The 1990s saw a change in musical landscape on a national level with the emergence of grunge rock, spreading from the Pacific Northwest with bands such as Nirvana and Soundgarden. Following grunge’s burst into the spotlight, Red Rocks saw an influx of rock bands and grunge fans flood the venue for concerts.\n\nIn the early 90s, Red Rocks featured alternative bands more heavily than any other genre, with bands such as Steve Miller Band, Depeche Mode, and Sonic Mode. The venue also featured prominent rock bands from the 80s including Kiss, Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Allman Brothers, and Poison. As the music, the rock genre in particular, transitioned into the grunge phase Red Rocks followed with shows by Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. These concerts marked the transition from 1980s traditional rock & roll to the darker sound and lyrical content of grunge rock.\n\nGrunge wasn’t the only alternative rock sub-genre to gain widespread popularity during the 1990s and increase in exposure from playing live shows. This new sub-genre actually gained most of its popularity through live concerts because of the stylistic playing of these bands combined with the atmosphere a live show provides with passionate fans and elaborate sound and light designs. Red Rocks provided a perfect setting for the rise of alternative jam bands: picturesque Colorado scenery, beautiful surrounding rock formations, ideal acoustics, and intricate lighting sequences. The 90s wasn’t Red Rocks’ first experience with jam bands, as Grateful Dead had played countless shows at the venue throughout the 1970s and 80s. The growth in popularity of jam bands such as Dave Matthews Band and Phish reignited the lively spirit and atmosphere of live jam band music that flourished in the 70s.\n\nThe often upbeat atmosphere of live jam band shows resulted in a very hostile and violent situation at Red Rocks in 1996. A Phish concert in the summer of 1996 ended in civilian riots and police in SWAT gear. The stories of the origin of the riot range from a crowd assisting a woman hit by a car refusing to disperse to tickets that were too difficult to obtain and were not allowed in. The chaos that ensued left a gloomy shadow on the future of Phish concerts at Red Rocks as they were banned indefinitely from playing any future shows at the venue. The restriction was eventually lifted in 2009, but the stain of that concert’s catastrophe loomed large for thirteen long years for Colorado Phish phans.\n\nRed Rocks as well as the rest of the country underwent several periods of musical transitions in the 1990s in the rock genre alone. The lineup of various rock bands and their associated genres represents the evolution of rock music throughout the decade along with rock in the previous generations. That, in essence, is the magic of the Red Rocks Amphitheater: the ability to transform, merge, and celebrate all forms of music from the past and present.\n\n– Zack Reyes\n\nEven before there was a stage at Red Rocks, humans recognized its acoustical properties were magic. Somehow the monoliths formed in such a way, that the sounds produced between the two rocks frolic expansively up the mountainside and are perfectly amplified and enhanced by nature. Although the massive amount of construction and earth removal likely removed many traces of early human activity, there are still a few places where Ute tools and artifacts have been discovered. Likely these early Americans used the area for seasonal activities and ceremonies. I can imagine them dancing and singing between Ship Rock and Creation Rock, both bigger than Niagara Falls and once considered to be one of the Seven Wonders Of the World. We may never truly know the extent of the Ute’s activities at Red Rocks but we can experience the magic for ourselves by attending one of the many musical events at Red Rocks Amphitheater.\n\nIn the early 1900’s, creative visionary, John Brisben Walker acquired the land called Garden of The Angels, named it Garden of The Titans and began to produce concerts on a temporary stage. Quite a notable person he pursued a number of ventures prior to his involvement with the Red Rocks area. After the acquisition, he devoted most of his time to development, “he built a road to the area, a teahouse, hiking trails, and a funicular or incline railway to the top of Mt. Morrison, the longest cog railway in the world at the time.” Even in our modern times, its hard to imagine one person owning the entirety of Red Rocks. I wonder if his descendants wish he had never sold that land and instead had kept it in the family.\n\nBefore the construction of the amphitheater, during the early years of Red Rocks, families would have picnics and enjoy Sunday concerts from the top of Creation Rock. For the most part, concerts were small scale classical ensembles, ballet performances and shows by Native American Dancers. In 1906, the largest event at Red Rocks, Feast of Lanterns featured four military bands. Fireworks erupted from the local hillsides, which given Colorado’s dry climate, must have been incredibly dangerous. In 1911, famous opera singer, Mary Garden performed at Red Rocks and she raved about the acoustical properties. Although he was the landowner, Brisbane must have lacked the tremendous financial resources necessary to fulfill his dream of turning Red Rocks into an everlasting performance space. Luckily, Red Rocks was not to be left undeveloped thanks to Denver Parks Manager George Cranmer.\n\nIn 1927, the City of Denver purchased Red Rocks with the intention of fulfilling Walker’s vision and creating a world famous music venue and community gathering space. Renown Denver architect Burnham Hoyt completed plans for the amphitheater in 1936. Thanks to the manual labor of hundreds of people from the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration, construction was completed in 1941.\n\nTransforming Red Rocks from a massive rock garden into the venue we know today was a massive undertaking. It involved the cooperation of numerous government agencies and thousands of man hours. There were no mechanical tools at the time, and no source of electricity. Tons of rock had to be removed or redistributed by hand or by shovel and wheelbarrow. I can’t help but feel a pang for those hard workers, especially knowing that they paid just $1 per day and likely had no source of hot water for a night bath to ease their aching muscles. Next week’s blog post will go into more detail about the construction of Red Rocks. You will never look at Red Rocks the same, it is truly as much a Natural Wonder as it is a miraculous achievement of modern man.\n\nby Jesse Holt"
