He is the son of musician Tyrone Griffin, a member of the band Lakeside. He has said that through his father's involvement in Lakeside, he met singers like Earth, Wind & Fire and Prince as a child, which led to his love and interest for soul music. Growing up in South Central Los Angeles, Ty Dolla Sign was involved in gang activity.\n\nCareer\n\nTy Dolla Sign began his music career by learning how to play the bass guitar and later learned how to play drums, guitars, keyboards, and the MPC. Ty Dolla Sign and his partner Kory were signed a record deal with Venus Brown and Buddah Brown Entertainment, subsequently releasing a mixtape, titled Raw & Bangin Mixtape Vol 2.\n\nTy Dolla Sign first gained recognition for his guest appearance on hometown rapper YG's 2010 single \"Toot It and Boot It\", which entered the Billboard Hot 100 as his first minor hit. He signed with Atlantic Records in 2012, and Wiz Khalifa's Taylor Gang Entertainment the following year.\n\nOn February 23, 2014, Ty Dolla Sign revealed that his debut studio album would be titled Free TC, and would be released during the third quarter of 2014.

The second single \"Expensive\" (featuring Nicki Minaj) was released on August 28, 2020. On October 14, Ty Dolla Sign revealed that he changed the album's title to Featuring Ty Dolla Sign, a reference to his work on other artists' projects and songs since his last release.

The album features artists including Kid Cudi, Post Malone, Kanye West, Anderson .Paak, Quavo, Lil Durk, Nicki Minaj, Big Sean, Jhené Aiko, Kehlani, Future, Musiq Soulchild, FKA Twigs, and Skrillex.

It was reported earlier in the month that he and West were shopping for distributors for the album, as West is an independent artist. The project, tentatively titled ¥$ and originally planned for a release in 2016, would serve as West's first official release.\n\nArtistry\n\nTy Dolla Sign's sound is a combination of contemporary R&B and hip hop music elements .\n\nHe cited Nate Dogg and Chris Brown as main influences for his musical style. When asked about his influences, Ty Dolla Sign responded, \"2Pac is my favorite artist of all time. I liked Slum Village a lot back then, like J Dilla, he's one of my favorite producers and artists. I'm like a hip-hop head type of dude. Mos Def, Talib Kweli, that whole Rawkus Records scene.\" He continued, \"I also like cats like Prince. Just like his production, he's kind of like the same thing as me. He sings, he produces, he plays all types of instruments. That's what I'm after. I wouldn't wear that type of clothes or wear my hair like that. [Laughs.] But as far as artistry, that's the same type of dude I am.\" In an interview he revealed that Kim Burrell was his absolute favorite vocalist, and that Brandy was right there with her.\n\nPersonal life\n\nTy Dolla Sign has a daughter named Jailynn Crystal. She was in a relationship with Fifth Harmony member Lauren Jauregui from 2017 to 2019.\n\nIn 2020, Ty Dolla Sign formally endorsed the presidential campaign of fellow rapper and frequent collaborator Kanye West.\n\nDiscography\n\nMain article: Ty Dolla Sign discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nFree TC (2015)\n\nBeach House 3 (2017)\n\nFeaturing Ty Dolla Sign (2020)\n\nFilmography\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2022 Entergalactic Ky (voice) Netflix TV Special\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nYear Awards Nominated work Category Result 2016 Premios Juventud \"Work from Home\" (with Fifth Harmony) Favorite Hit Nominated Teen Choice Awards Choice Summer Song Won MTV Video Music Awards Best Collaboration Won American Music Awards Collaboration of the Year Won 2017 iHeartRadio Music Awards Best Music Video Won Kids' Choice Awards Favorite Song Won MTV Video Music Awards \"Gone\" (with Afrojack) Best Dance Video Nominated BET Hip Hop Awards \"Ain't Nothing\" Best Featured Verse Nominated \"Blessings\" (Lecrae featuring Ty Dolla Sign) Impact Track Nominated 2018 GMA Dove Awards Song of the Year Nominated iHeartRadio Titanium Awards \"Psycho\" (with Post Malone) 1 Billion Total Audience Spins on iHeartRadio Stations Won 2019 MTV Video Music Awards \"...
