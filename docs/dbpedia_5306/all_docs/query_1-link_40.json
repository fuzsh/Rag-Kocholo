        "text": "Wiz Khalifa is celebrating his newborn daughter on his latest single just days after he dropped a surprise mixtape.\n\nOn Friday, August 2, the Pittsburgh native delivered his new song \"Baby Girl On The Way\" via Taylor Gang Ent. On the Lex Luger-produced track, Wiz opens up about his relationship with his girlfriend Aimee Aguilar and embraces his new daughter Kaydence.\n\n\"Baby girl on the way, we been f**king for awhile, I ain't pull it out, now baby girl on the way,\" Wiz spits. \"I hope she got your smile, I give her style/we don't do normal things.\"\n\nWiz and Aimee welcomed their daughter into the world last month. Their first child's birth wasn't announced until Aimee made a TikTok video about her postpartum recovery. Less than a week later, Wiz got back to business by releasing a surprise mixtape called Wiz Owens. The 13-track project contains features with Sosamann, Young Deji and 24hrs. Wiz kicks off the project with \"Jet Leg,\" which appears on iHeartRadio's Rap Rising playlist.\n\nIn addition to Wiz's new music, the playlist features A$AP Rocky's new single \"HIGHJACK,\" which premiered today as iHeartRadio's latest World Premiere. It also holds Big Sean's fresh song \"On Up,\" Saweetie's \"My Best\" and Ice Spice's \"GYAT\" from the deluxe version of her debut LP Y2K! Check out the playlist up top and scroll below for more new releases.\n\nWARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE"
