TMZ reports the California rapper asked the DJ to turn up the volume. YG then started throwing bottles and jumped into the crowd. He even punched a fan in the face.\n\nAccording to the promoter, the club where the concert was hosted may lose its license due to the performer’s actions. The venue is reportedly looking into pursuing legal action against YG.\n\nJeezy Blames Freddie Gibbs for Eminem Fallout; Gibbs Responds\n\nDuring a recent interview with Hot 97, Jeezy accused Freddie Gibbs of costing him working relationships with other artists, including Eminem. He also denied accusations that he didn’t put in enough effort to make Gibbs’s popularity surge.\n\n“I messed up a lot of relationships, even with Eminem, just by me putting Gibbs on the record that was for me, and trying to convince Em to do the record, and the record leaking in the process. That burned a great bridge for me. Eminem is my dude,” said the Atlanta rapper.\n\nGibbs responded during his own interview with the New York radio station. “I didn’t do anything of the sort. I wasn’t involved in that whole process. I got, he brought a song to me. Asked me to get on it and I got on it. I was just doing what my superior at that time was telling me to do… I actually, honestly, was against it…I didn’t want to get on the Eminem song, because that wasn’t the approach that I wanted to [take]… For one, I didn’t like the song,” said Gibbs.\n\nCheck out the STACK Rundown for the latest entertainment news.\n\nArrest Warrant Issued for Wiz Khalifa\n\nLast week, an arrest warrant was issued for Wiz Khalifa after he failed to show up at a hearing in El Paso, Texas.
