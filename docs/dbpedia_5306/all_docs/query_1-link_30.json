        "text": "Las Vegas, NV -\n\nWiz Khalifa has paid tribute to some of Hip Hop’s fallen soldiers, including XXXTENTACION, Pop Smoke and Nipsey Hussle.\n\nThe Taylor Gang leader’s show at Drai’s Beachclub in Las Vegas on Saturday (April 27) featured a touching performance of “See You Again,” during which Wiz flashed photos of various rappers who’ve passed away on the screen above the stage.\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING...\n\nEach photo contained the year of their births and deaths, with many noting that none of the rappers — except for DMX, who was also included in the tribute — made it to their 40th birthday.\n\nIn addition to the homage to the three rappers mentioned above, the “Black & Yellow” rapper also mourned the deaths of rappers like TakeOff, PNB Rock, Young Dolph and King Von.\n\nAside from performing at live shows, Wiz Khalifa has been preparing to release the sequel to his classic 2010 mixtape Kush & Orange Juice.\n\nThe Taylor Gang chief teased Kush & Orange Juice 2 on Instagram last week, where he posted behind-the-scenes footage of him working on a track for the project.\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING...\n\nHe wrote in the caption: “Mixing and co-producing this album has been so much fun. I learned a lot in the process and took myself to levels i didn’t even know i could go. I can’t wait until you guys get to experience how special and amazing this body of work is. #KushandOrangeJuice2.”\n\nWiz’s enthusiasm was not shared by all of his fans, though, with some unimpressed by the song snippet — which sounded more melodic than the music featured on the original mixtape.\n\n“With all due respect Wiz this is not a kush and orange juice 2 worth song. Kush and orange juice 2 should be as dope as 1 respectfully there were no skips,” one fan commented.\n\nAnother said: “Please don’t be on KAOJ2 with all that commercial shit, we need mixtape wiz on that, don’t mess up a classic gang.”\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING...\n\nA third added: “Please don’t name it Kush and OJ 2. The music you put out now doesn’t even REMOTELY COME CLOSE to the music you was puttin out in the 1st Kush and OJ. I’m saying this as a Wiz fan and respectfully, you’re gonna ruin the Kush and OJ name with this type of music.”"
