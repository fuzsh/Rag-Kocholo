        "text": "Wiz Khalifa and Travis Scott are “Trippin” on their smoking DP Beats-produced collaboration.\n\nThe ballers’ anthem, which reunites the “Bake Sale” rappers, serves as the opening track on Dponthebeat Vol. 3, the third installment in the producer’s Dponthebeat series.\n\nWiz blazes up the Khalifa Kush and provides some weed-inspired bars, while La Flame lays down the club-ready hook. “All my ni**as chillin’ in the VIP / Poppin’ bottles, you can’t have a sip / Smokin’ loud, you can’t have a hit,” raps Travis."
