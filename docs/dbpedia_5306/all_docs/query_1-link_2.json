        "text": "Song by Wiz Khalifa\n\n\"Black and Yellow\" is a song by American rapper Wiz Khalifa from his third studio album, Rolling Papers. It was released on September 14, 2010, as the lead single from the album. The song was written by Khalifa, along with Stargate, who produced it. It was released as a CD single in honor of Record Store Day.[2] The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Wiz Khalifa's first number-one single in the US.[3]\n\nThe song is about growing up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and also Khalifa's car, a yellow Dodge Challenger Hemi with black stripes.[4] He has stated that he got the car in those colors as a tribute to his hometown of Pittsburgh, whose official colors are black and gold, and its professional sports teams, all of whose colors are black and some variation of gold or yellow.[4] The song itself does not mention Pittsburgh or sports, although the song's music video made the connection to Pittsburgh explicit, showing various iconic locations in the city, as well as apparel associated with the football team the Pittsburgh Steelers, the hockey team the Pittsburgh Penguins, and the baseball team the Pittsburgh Pirates. In the year after it was released, \"Black and Yellow\" spawned dozens of remixes, parodies and remakes, both in the U.S. and internationally, many of them made in tribute to a local sports team.[5][6][7] At Super Bowl XLV in 2011, which featured the Steelers competing against the Green Bay Packers, the Steelers used \"Black and Yellow\" as their fight song, while the Packers used a remix by Lil Wayne called \"Green and Yellow\", marking the first time both teams at the Super Bowl had used the same song.[8] The song earned Khalifa his first Grammy nominations, for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance at the 2012 ceremony.[9]\n\nChart performance\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the issue dated October 2, 2010, \"Black and Yellow\" debuted at No. 100 on the Billboard Hot 100. It then dropped out the following week and re-entered at No. 64 on the issue dated October 30, 2010. On its eighteenth charting week, the song rose to No. 1 on the issue dated February 19, 2011, selling 198,000 digital copies that week.[10] \"Black and Yellow\" has sold 4,144,922 digital copies since release.[11]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nThe music video was directed by Bill Paladino. It was filmed in Pittsburgh and features sights of the city, including the U.S. Steel Tower, BNY Mellon Center, PPG Place, William Penn Hotel, Citizens Bank Tower, Union Trust Building, One PNC Plaza, K&L Gates Center the Three Sisters and Smithfield Street bridges, Station Square, Shannon Hall of the Art Institute of Pittsburgh and the smoke stacks of the former U.S. Steel Homestead Works at The Waterfront adjacent to the city. The video also prominently features city icons such as the Terrible Towel, a rally towel for the Pittsburgh Steelers, and city sports in general, as well as Pittsburgh Pirates apparel. It was recorded in Chatsworth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a 2012 commercial for the video game Madden NFL 13, Paul Rudd sings the song while playing the game as the Pittsburgh Steelers against Ray Lewis.[12]\n\nOn April 7, 2014, Jimmy Kimmel Live! held a skit called \"American Sign Language Rap Battle.\" Khalifa performed the song as three ASL-certified interpreters competed.\n\nThe song was featured in multiple trailers for The Lego Batman Movie.\n\nThe song was an anthem for 1% Motorcycle club Satudarah due to its black and yellow club colors.\n\nThe song is used by the Tucson Sugar Skulls of the Indoor Football League after every touchdown scored at the Tucson Convention Center by the Sugar Skulls\n\nRemixes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe official remix, \"Black & Yellow (G-Mix)\" features fellow American rappers Snoop Dogg, Juicy J, and T-Pain. Wiz Khalifa has a new verse on the track. The song leaked on December 12, 2010, but was officially released on December 16.[13] A video for the remix was shot and was released on January 8, 2011. A remix by just T-Pain, \"Black & Yellow (T-Mix)\", featured the verse that was later put on the official remix. An anime version fan remix was also made combining the song and Hidamari Sketch's opening music, \"Sketch Switch\".\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nDigital download[14]\n\n\"Black and Yellow\" (Explicit Album Version) – 3:37\n\nDigital download (G-Mix)[15]\n\n\"Black and Yellow\" (G-Mix) (featuring Snoop Dogg, Juicy J & T-Pain) – 4:38\n\nRemakes and freestyles\n\n[edit]\n\nMany remakes have been made, mostly in tribute to other sports teams, referring to their respective pair of colors.
