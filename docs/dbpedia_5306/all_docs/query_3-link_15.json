        "text": "Rapper, producer, and HBK Gang member, P-Lo, is working hard to push the boundaries of the West Coast’s sound. Born in the Bay Area and raised in a Filipino-American household, P-Lo credits his early encounters with different genres of music as the launching pad to his musical career. His unique style and sound reflects these diverse influences.\n\nP-Lo first gained national notoriety for producing hits like Yo Gotti’s “Act Right” ft. Jeezy & YG and Wiz Khalifa’s “Bout Me” ft. Problem & Iamsu!. His collaborations with Kirko Bangz on “Hoe” and Iamsu! on “Only That Real” ft. 2 Chainz & Sage the Gemini have made him an in demand producer among artists looking to make an impact in the club and at radio. In 2015, P-Lo has already produced “I Bet” ft. 50 Cent for Chris Brown and Tyga’s Fan of a Fan: The Album, B.o.B’s “Not For Long” ft. Trey Songz, Wiz Khalifa and Iggy Azalea’s “Go Hard Or Go Home” for the Furious 7 soundtrack, and co-written Flo Rida’s hit single “GDFR” ft. Sage the Gemini and Lookas.\n\nTOP CUTS"
