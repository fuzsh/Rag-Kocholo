        "text": "29 March 2024 Hip-Hop/Pop Rappers Perform at HWS Spring Concert\n\nRapper, Singer and Songwriter Bryce Vine will headline the Spring Concert on April 6 with Sammy Adams as the show’s opener.\n\nBest known for his songs “Drew Barrymore” and “La La Land,” Bryce Vine will headline the HWS Spring Concert on Saturday, April 6 in the Bristol Field House. Taking the stage as the show’s opener is Sammy Adams, a platinum-selling rapper, singer and songwriter. Adams begins at 8 p.m., and Vine at 9 p.m.\n\nBryce Vine is an American rapper, singer and songwriter whose individual works have surpassed 100 million streams on Spotify. He has collaborated with Loud Luxury, YG, Parmalee, Frenship, and Will.i.am, among others.\n\n“It is not easy to describe Bryce’s style,” says writer Eric Fuller in a review that appeared in Forbes in May 2022. “It’s a mash up of bass heavy rap, combined with a pop flavor, hip-hip choruses and a tinge of punk rock. He’s an engaging performer who delivers an energetic show to a crowd which begins dancing quickly and never really stops.”\n\nSammy Adams is an American rapper, singer and songwriter. His campus appearance will be a homecoming for Adams who attended HWS. Known then as Sam Adams Wisner ’10, Adams was a member of the Hobart soccer team, lettering in 2007 and receiving the Block H Rookie Award and was twice named Liberty League Rookie of the Year. He transferred to Trinity College in 2008 to be closer to family.\n\nAdams started recording songs on his laptop in 2008 from his college dorm room, and within a few years opened across the country for Drake, Kid Cudi, Big Sean, Wiz Khalifa, Snoop Dogg, Mike Posner, Curren$y and Tiesto. He has released singles with Posner, Enrique Iglesias and appeared on Conan O'Brien. His release of “All Night Longer” in 2012 has amassed 84 million streams on Spotify. Most recently, he has produced the EP “Good Problems” with Steezefield from 808 Mafia.\n\nThe Spring Concert is coordinated by Hobart Student Government and William Smith Congress, which have been working with Student Engagement since the fall to generate polls of genres, recommendations for artists, and preparations for the event.\n\nPrior to the show, there will be a food truck rally starting at 5:30 p.m. in the Robert A. Bristol '31 Field House parking lot. Doors open at 7 p.m. The event is free and reserved for members of the HWS community. Students must bring their HWS OneCard for admission into the event."
