        "text": "I had the opportunity to present the African music industry for a room of investors at the SuperReturn conference in Cape Town last week, here are my 6 key pointers. Do you think I missed anything? 1. Global trend towards investment in music rights; Google's investment in Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI), Blackstone's investments in major catalogues (fx Timberlake and Bieber), industry analysts report a consistent 5-10% annual return on music right funds. 2. Currently only 1% of the global royalties are from Sub Sahara Africa however 15% of the global population are in Sub Sahara Africa, this is presenting a huge growth opportunity as the continent gets online. 3. Africa is the fastest growing music industry in the world with an impressive 34% growth in 2022. IFPI 4. There has been numerous investment and M&A activities across Africa the last couple of years: Chocolate City Music, AFRICORI, YNBL, Ziiki Media, A.I Records and Mavin Records (public rumours). 5. There’s limited reporting and tracking of industry performance, only South Africa is included in official global reports, with that in mind the African music is expected to have a market size of $300m in 2025, an impressive 4x growth from 2021 to 2025. This is still peanuts compared to Korean led by K-POP ($10bn) and LATAM led by Reggaeton ($1.1bn) that Africa is walking in the footsteps of. 6. The unique market structures (or lack of the same) has made it difficult for global music (and movie) streaming services to convert awareness to real traction across key markets in Africa, this requires either (1) a local approach to business model and monetisation or (2) a focus on monetising outside of Africa. (Side note: this is not only the case in Africa but also in India and South East Asia that I'm aware of where especially access and cost of internet is a barrier) Thanks to Niall Naidoo for facilitating the discussion and Derrick Ashong for his unique insights into the music industry as well as a thanks to all the conference participants for intriguing conversations.

Yes. But also not where it counts. I saw this stat yesterday and wanted to take a closer look at the numbers using ROSTR data. While \"more than half of 2024 GRAMMY nominees\" fits when you look at ALL the GRAMMY nominations - the distribution of those independent nominations is very skewed towards the more niche awards. Across the most prestigious awards the indie share is nowhere near 50%... General Field: - Awards: Album of The Year, Record of The Year, Song of The Year and Best New Artist - Total nominations: 32 - Independent nominations: 1(!) - Indie share: 3% Selected Best Album Awards: - Best Pop Album: 0/5 (0% indie share) - Best Dance/Electronic Album: 0/5 (0%) - Best Rock Album: 1/5 (20%) - Best R&B Album: 1/5 (20%) - Best Progressive R&B Album: 1/5 (20%) - Best Country Album: 2/5 (40%) - Best Alternative Album: 2/5 (40%) - Best Rap Album: 2/5 (40%) - Best Latin Pop Album: 3/6 (50%) Overall share for the above album awards: 26% -------------- Overall it’s dope that more independent artists are being nominated and the trend is a positive one (also much better gender balance these days). Also want to stress that getting nominated for any GRAMMY is a huge achievement regardless of it’s one of the more marquee awards. But I think it’s important to also keep an eye on how that ratio is distributed. 1 indie nomination from 32 in the general field sucks. 2 major best album categories having no independent nominees sucks. In the end these are often the awards that get the most TV attention. It’d be cool if we see more independent representation in these categories in future years - because there’s absolutely independent artists/albums who could be up there. ⚠️ this data is pretty rough but directionally correct #musicindustry #grammys #independentmusic"
