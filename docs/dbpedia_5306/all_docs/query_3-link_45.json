        "text": "After witnessing the historical event of Kendrick Lamar's Inglewood concert, “The Pop Out” back in June, it’s easier to recognize L.A.’s place as a hot spot for the budding talent, musicians, and rising artists in hip-hop today.\n\nAnd while many artists and creatives from all over the world flock to L.A. to invigorate their careers, this city is already home to so much local talent; born and bred here, with an undeniable impact on music.\n\nSo, who are the Angelenos carrying L.A. into hip-hop’s future?\n\n“I feel like [the Pop-Out] elevated the culture out here in many ways,” Khari Malik Johnson, a.k.a. “KillaHrtz” tells L.A. TACO. He is a music producer who grew up in Mid-City and has produced hip-hop and R&B tracks for many local musicians, including SaintFromLA, Noa James, Randy White, and many more L.A.-based artists.\n\nLike many of us, he points to Kendrick’s “Pop-Out” show as a critical moment for local rappers, when Lamar thrust a curated lineup of West Coast artists to the forefront of his stage and, in turn, the world’s. Johnson also mentions a few upcoming rappers, including Kalan FrFr, who was raised in Carson and Compton.\n\nMost recently, XXL Magazine announced its brand new \"Freshman Class\" of emcees to watch. However, reminding us of the early 80s, when L.A. hip-hop didn’t get its due, the list did not include a single artist from the West Coast.\n\nHere, we've made our list of 23 rappers from L.A. who are next to blow up.\n\n310babii\n\n310Babii is a young rapper, singer, and songwriter hailing from Inglewood.
