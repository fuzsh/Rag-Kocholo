Vince Staples\n\nAge: 20\n\nLabel: Blacksmith/A.G./Def Jam\n\nFrom: Long Beach, California\n\nLatest release: Shyne Coldchain Vol. 2\n\nLast year's rank: N/A\n\nVince Staples, the 20-year-old rapper from Long Beach, Calif. has been heard sparingly on features since 2010 with a couple very good mixtapes sprinkled in between. But it wasn't until his breakout verse on Earl Sweatshirt's \"Hive\" that people started to really pay attention. Staples' unwavering monotone delivery and lyrical content makes him seem much older than what he is. He spits like a kid that listened to every word an O.G. blessed him with. Just play \"Progressive 3\" and try not to get chills. It's rare for someone so young to ably rap about social ills the way he does. Vince doesn't come across as preachy which is difficult to do when rapping about struggle. We hope he doesn't get tired of rap because his words are powerful and Lord knows hip-hop needs a voice like his. —Angel Diaz\n\n19. Rich Homie Quan\n\nAge: 24\n\nLabel: Def Jam Recordings\n\nFrom: Atlanta, Georgia\n\nLatest release: I Promise I Will Never Stop Going In\n\nLast year's rank: N/A\n\nRich Homie Quan is one of a handful of warbling, singer/rappers types that have come up in the wake of Future’s genre-bending success. Unlike many of his weaker contemporaries, however, the Atlanta crooner has the skills to back up the hits. He crafted one of last year’s most earwormy hooks with his guest spot on YG’s “My Nigga.” More importantly, he made one of the best songs of last year, “Type of Way,\" which quickly entered rap's lexicon and became the kind of phrase even people who hadn't heard the song would say.\n\nHe delivered on that promise with his slept-on mixtape, I Promise I Will Never Stop Going In. The project found him dropping smooth verses and melodic choruses on songs like “Walk Thru” with Problem and “Get TF Out My Face” with Young Thug. While none of the songs have blown up like “Type of Way,” they demonstrate that Quan has the chops to be more than a one-hit wonder. However, he's got to step up and put out more strong material to keep his buzz going. —Chris Mench\n\n18. Wale\n\nAge: 29\n\nLabel: Maybach Music Group/Atlantic\n\nFrom: Washington, D.C.\n\nLatest Release: The Gifted\n\nLast year's rank: No. 12\n\nIt may have taken Wale a few years, but after all the trials and tribulations he's sitting pretty as one of the premier players on Rick Ross's Maybach Music label. His last album, 2013's The Gifted, found the DMV rapper experimenting with jazz and soul influences to great effect. The Tiara Thomas collaboration \"Bad\" became Wale's highest charting single to date, and even spawned a popular remix featuring Rihanna. After stumbling out of the gate, Wale has finally found success and stability in his career, a rare comeback story in the often-unforgiving rap game.\n\nHe might still carry a permanent chip on his shoulder, but Wale has more or less settled into being of the best wordsmiths in his bracket. He's mostly had a quiet 2014, but with Album About Nothing slated for this fall, we're expecting Wale to gear up for another strong year. —Chris Mench\n\n17. Big Sean\n\nAge: 26\n\nLabel: G.O.O.D. Music/Def Jam\n\nFrom: Detroit, Michigan\n\nLatest release: Hall of Fame\n\nLast year's rank: No. 4\n\nBig Sean's Finally Famous debut was a color-by-numbers effort that spawned hits with big name stars, but failed to leave much of a lasting impression. By the time his second album, Hall of Fame, rolled around, the G.O.O.D. Music rapper had lost much of the momentum he built with his excellent Detroit mixtape and verses on Cruel Summer. Perhaps expecting more of the same, so many stayed home and the album underperformed its predecessor commercially. Worst yet, last summer, Sean let Kendrick Lamar murder him on his own shit and set the rap world on fire on his song \"Control\" which just led to a million jokes at Sean's expense.\n\nThe shame of it all is Hall of Fame wasn't a bad album. Big Sean didn't reinvented himself, but he made notable improvements both in originality and delivery. The cheesiness that was often present on his debut has waned, and Sean's technical abilities are on better display.\n\nDespite his second album setback, there's no denying that Big Sean can make a radio hit. Just look at the catalog of hits he's quietly tallied up these past few years: \"My Last,\" \"Marvin & Chardonnay,\" \"Dance (A$$),\" \"Mercy,\" \"Clique,\" and \"Beware.\" Even if he isn't super hot right now, a guy like Sean is always one hit away from being on everyone's radar again. Sean tends to perform best when accompanied by another heavy hitter, but hopefully his next project finds him standing on his own two feet with a bit more confidence. —Chris Mench\n\n16. Wiz Khalifa\n\nAge: 26\n\nLabel: Taylor Gang/Rostrum/Atlantic\n\nFrom: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nLatest release: 28 Grams\n\nLast year's rank: No. 15\n\nAt this point in his career, Wiz Khalifa is somewhat of an institution. He isn't the best bar for bar rapper, but he's routinely made great rap songs over the years. His Kush & Orange Juice mixtape remains a stoner legend, and subsequent commercial success with his major label debut Rolling Paperscemented his spot in the rap game.\n\nYet, while his work on Atlantic records brought him the wider audience he desired, it alienated many longtime fans who didn't like the pop-oriented direction their pothead hero had taken. His second album O.N.I.F.C. subsequently underperformed its predecessor, as Wiz struggled to integrate his old style with his newfound success.\n\nWiz deftly adjusted his game plan on the fly and hit us all with a left hook with his latest single \"We Dem Boyz\" and the 28 Grams mixtape. A departure from his former style, the new tape and single found him exploring in-the-moment trap influences. The switch appears to have worked, after being released in February, \"We Dem Boyz\" has been making major rounds at clubs and has even climbed to No. 62 on Billboard.\n\nIf the new song is any indication, we may find a whole new Wiz on his next album Blacc Hollywood, which is due later this year. If Wiz can finally find a way to seamlessly keep his commercial appeal without sacrificing too much of himself, he might climb a few spots higher. —Chris Mench\n\n15. Ab-Soul\n\nAge: 27\n\nLabel: TDE/Interscope\n\nFrom: Carson, California\n\nLatest release: These Days...\n\nLast year's rank: No. 17\n\nSure, Kendrick Lamar and ScHoolboy Q have proven to be the bread winners for Top Dawg Entertainment these past few years, but it's the oft-overlooked Soulo that truly captures the label's spirit. His 2012 album Control Systemis a fiery rebuke of the system, combining heady lyricism and dark, pulsating production into one of the year's most unique albums. His spacey, introspective raps read as a sermon on the good and evil in society, with the California spitter serving as the \"Black Lip Pastor\" for a generation raised on Stop-and-Frisk, Trayvon Martin, and post-9/11 paranoia.\n\nAlthough that album was enough to establish Solo as a rapper's rapper, the real test is his new album These Days... After the breakout success of his fellow TDE signees, Ab may have ambitions to reach for a wider audience. Regardless of whether These Days... achieves good kid, m.A.A.d. city or Oxymoron levels of crossover success, we hope that it'll reaffirm TDE's commitment to unique, high quality hip-hop. In that regard, there is certainly no better poster child for the label than Ab-Soul. —Chris Mench\n\n14. Quavo\n\nAge: 23\n\nLabel: 300/Atlantic\n\nFrom: Atlanta, Georgia\n\nLatest release: No Label 2\n\nLast year's rank: N/A\n\nYou probably couldn't pick him out of a lineup, but Quavo has quietly become one of the most influential artists in rap because he's credited as the inventor of the \"Migos flow.\" The oldest member of Atlanta rap trio Migos, Quavo's voice is reminiscent of Gucci Mane, but raps with much more clarity than Gucci. When Migos blew up last year off the strength of their Young Rich Niggas mixtape and its ubiquitous single \"Versace,\" Quavo's halting, double-time flow birthed a style all it's own, with everyone from Drake to Ab-Soul lining up to offer their best imitations.\n\nNow signed to Kevin Liles' 300 label and distributed through Atlantic, Migos are eager to prove they're here to stay and aren't just one hit wonders (though \"Hannah Montana\" has kind of already proved that). They recently shook up expectations by collaborating with Justin Bieber on \"Looking for You.\" In recent weeks, they've been busy linking up with Young Thug for \"1017\" and dropping a video for \"Fight Night\" off their No Label 2 mixtape. We'll see if Migos can find a way to outlive \"Versace\" but if they can't, Quavo might need to rethink his future without his friends. —Chris Mench\n\n13. Tyler, The Creator\n\nAge: 23\n\nLabel: Odd Future\n\nFrom: Los Angeles, California\n\nLatest Release: Wolf\n\nLast year's rank: No. 14\n\nTyler, the Creator is his own man. Whether he's hugging it out with Larry King, calling out Iggy Azalea's butt, or spitting vulgar rhymes with his Odd Future cohorts, nobody can accuse Tyler of not being true to himself. It's this independent spirit that gives the California rapper his off-kilter appeal.\n\nOn his 2013 album Wolf, Tyler worked to push out of the \"violent/weirdo rapper\" box while not totally abandoning the violence and misogyny that dominated Goblin. He managed to tackle more serious topics without abandoning his core aesthetic. The result was an album that felt less like it was reaching for shock value and more like it was trying to actually say something as an artist.\n\nGoing forward without having to wax poetically about stabbing \"Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus\" will only benefit a rapper whose talent and creativity can and should outshine contrived controversy. Whether or not he'll remained solely focused on music or even rapping (he recently told Larry King he wants to start singing) remains to be seen. That said, when he's committed to rapping a verse, he's still one of the most magnetic rappers out today. —Chris Mench\n\n12. ScHoolboy Q\n\nAge: 27\n\nLabel: TDE/Interscope\n\nFrom: Los Angeles, California\n\nLatest Release: Oxymoron\n\nLast year's rank: No. 6\n\nScHoolboy might be T.D.E.'s most balanced artist. He can be as lyrical as Ab-Soul or Kendrick Lamar but he can rap just a gritty as Jay Rock. What sets him apart from his crew members, though, is his energy. Tracks like \"There He Go,\" \"Hands On the Wheel,\" \"Man of the Year,\" \"Collard Greens,\" and \"Break The Bank\" are proof of that proclamation. His raspy, and aggressive delivery demands the listener's attention. His honesty on tracks like \"Blessed,\" \"My Homie,\" and \"Prescription/Oxymoron\" has helped cultivate a fanbase that can relate to him as a human.\n\nThat said, it’s hard to deny that Oxymoron was a bit of a disappointment, so much so he's gone down several spots since last year's list. It probably didn't help that Q was running around saying his album would be as good as Kendrick's heralded good kid, m.A.A.d city. But as of right now, the album is halfway to Gold and one of the better albums to be released this year (so far). With two solid albums already under his belt (2012’s Habits and Contradictions is the superior album), we're looking forward to watching Q grow as an artist. Few rappers in 2014 can hold it down in the streets, the clubs, and the radio, but ScHoolboy comes close. —Angel Diaz\n\n11. Young Thug\n\nAge: 21\n\nLabel: 1017 Bricksquad/Asylum/Atlantic\n\nFrom: Atlanta, Georgia\n\nLatest Release: Young Thugga Mane La Flare\n\nLast year's rank: N/A\n\nKnown for his high-pitched voice and frantic delivery, Young Thug might be 2014's hottest rap commodity. After releasing the well-received 1017 Thug mixtape in 2013, the Complex cover star hit it big this year with \"Stoner\" and \"Danny Glover.\" The songs became viral hits, and Thug rose to prominence on the back of their success. Now his strange, warbling raps are thumping in clubs and rattling out of car speakers and he's making music with everyone from Young Money stars Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj to Atlanta upstarts like Rich Homie Quan and Migos.\n\nDespite all of Thuggers recent successes, he keeps getting derailed by a messy label situation. As soon as his buzz peaked, his tracks seeming started leak every week-much of it being older, less focused work­ that undermined his recent rise after fully embracing his offbeat style. Thugger needs to get his business affairs in order before he move on to the next step and if he doesn't do it quickly he might watch his buzz fade before he can capitalize on it. Still, we're not too worried as Thug keeps churning out bangers like his recent collaborations with T.I. (\"About The Money\") and Tyga (\"Hookah\").\n\nWhere he goes from here remains a mystery. He could be rap's next big star or he could flame out amidst label drama or overexposure. What can be confidently said is that right now, everyone wants a piece of Young Thug. —Chris Mench\n\n10. Mac Miller\n\nAge: 22\n\nLabel: REMember Music\n\nFrom: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nLatest Release: Faces\n\nLast year's rank: No. 7\n\nIn the past year, Mac Miller has done a lot to put some egg on the face of his naysayers. He redefined his sound and subject matter with his sophomore effort Watching Movies With the Sound Off. The album cast aside his much-maligned eager teenager persona in favor of a spaced-out, experimental vibe that won the respect of critics and kept his core fans. Getting behind the production board as his alter-ego Larry Fisherman didn't hurt either.\n\nSince then, he has also released a live mixtape Live From Space, a foray into horrorcore titled after his second alter-ego Delusional Thomas, and a proper Mac Miller tape, Faces. Taken as a whole, the projects reveal Mac as an evolving entity, keen on exploring influences and experimenting with his sound.\n\nUltimately, Mac Miller is still a work in progress. He's grown in leaps and bounds but none of his project marries all these disparate influences into a single, hard-hitting body of work. However, the promise he shows grows with each passing day. Long dismissed as a Twitter-fueled teen phenomenon destined to burn out quickly, Miller has worked hard to prove the critics wrong, and in doing so is releasing the best work of his career. We can't wait to see what comes next. —Chris Mench\n\n9. A$AP Ferg\n\nAge: 25\n\nLabel: A$AP Worldwide/Polo Grounds/RCA\n\nFrom: Harlem, New York\n\nLatest release: Trap Lord\n\nLast year's rank: N/A\n\nA$AP Ferg's Trap Lord had no business being as good as it was. Just as soon as we were all getting used to the idea of A$AP Rocky being one rap's brightest and best new stars, Ferg blessed us with one of the best songs of 2013, \"Shabba,\" as well as one of the best albums. Like Young Thug, Ferg's rap style isn't traditional. His rhymes are delivered with an offbeat singsong chant that makes quoting his line pointless because what he says doesn't matter nearly as much as how he says it.\n\nRocky is often criticized for his lack of depth, but that doesn't extend as much to Ferg. Sure, he's all about fucking Persian models and popping bottles as much as Rocky, but he still slips in flashes of introspection with lines like, \"Riding in a limo with a bunch of fake friends/Who be only around me cause I make ends.\"\n\nLike Rocky, Ferg has spent most of 2014 focused on the upcoming A$AP Mob album L.O.R.D.S.. The previous A$AP Mob project, Lords Never Worry was largely a disappointment so it makes sense for Ferg to wanna make sure their new album go off perfectly. But hopefully, once he's done with that, he can get back to releasing some solo material because he might have popped off with a group but he's just fine all on his own. —Insanul Ahmed\n\n8. Earl Sweatshirt\n\nAge: 20\n\nLabel: Tan Cressida/Columbia\n\nFrom: Los Angeles, California\n\nLatest release: Doris\n\nLast year's rank: N/A\n\nTo call Earl Sweatshirt Tyler, the Creator's more subdued counterpart within rap collective Odd Future is misleading; Earl's eponymous debut mixtape employed similar rape influenced bars and brashly offensive lines as his OF brethren. His reflexive flow is as unyielding as it is witty, and his childish voice only serves to increase the gravitas of his darker lines.\n\nEven though he's still in the early phases of his career, With last year's Doris, he distanced himself from his senselessly offensive material by displaying a more vulnerable side, but he didn't lose the bite that attracted his initial fanbase. \"Grandma's passing/But I'm too busy tryna get this fuckin' album cracking to see her/So I apologize in advance if anything should happen,\" he raps on \"Burgundy.\"\n\nBefore Doris was even out, he hinted at a third project called Gnossos on Twitter. More recently, he's spoken of doing a collaborative album with Tyler, the Creator called EarlWolf. Already established as one of rap's best wordsmiths, we're eager to see where Earl's still budding talent takes him next. —Ashley Reed\n\n7. YG\n\nAge: 24\n\nLabel: Pu$haz Ink/CTE World/Def Jam\n\nFrom: Compton, California\n\nLatest release: My Krazy Life\n\nLast year's rank: N/A\n\nYG was nowhere close to this list last year. Sure, he was rocking out with the Young Jeezy and Rich Homie Quan assisted banger \"My Nigga,\" but his mic skills left plenty to be desired. His debut album, originally titled Bompton but later renamed My Krazy Life, was marred with delays and wasn't very anticipated.\n\nBut YG cemented himself as a legitimate force in hip-hop this March when My Krazy Life dropped. The 24-year-old's debut album is the Best Album of 2014 (So Far) because it featured a level of narrative artistry that took most by surprise, stories of family, struggle and layered relationships brew a brutally honest portrait appropriately rough around the edges.\n\nFrom the Drake-aided banger \"Who Do You Love\" to the piano-laden, nostalgic \"Sorry Mama,\" YG proved himself a versatile creator. It's hard to say what's next for YG but one thing is for sure, with his hard hitting album, he's punching well out of his weight class. —Alex Siber\n\n6. A$AP Rocky\n\nAge: 25\n\nLabel: A$AP Worldwide/Polo Grounds/RCA\n\nFrom: Harlem, New York\n\nLatest release: Long. Live. ASAP\n\nLast year's rank: No. 5\n\nSitting at the head of the ever-expanding A$AP Mob franchise is A$AP Rocky. Last year was a banner year for Rocky, as he topped Billboard with his debut album Long.Live.ASAP and scored a Top-10 hit with \"Fuckin' Problems.\" Although the album made him a star, it lacked a bit of the lyrical punch that many had hoped for.\n\nSo far, 2014 has seen his solo work take a backseat to the upcoming A$AP Mob project, L.O.R.D. He popped up on their recent single \"Hella Hoes,\" but has otherwise been laying low as they work to showcase the Mob's footsoldiers like A$AP Nast and A$AP Twelvyy.\n\nHe hasn't been totally absent from the game though; his Gesaffelstein collaboration \"In Distress\" for the movie Divergent was one of the soundtrack's highlights, and he recently tweeted that his sophomore album was \"coming asap.\" Here's to hoping his next project can capitalize on the great buzz produced by his debut while challenging the rapper lyrically. It feels like it could take just one powerhouse song or verse to shoot Rocky from a rap star to a legit pop star. —Chris Mench\n\n5. Meek Mill\n\nAge: 27\n\nLabel: Maybach Music Group/Atlantic\n\nFrom: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nLatest release: Dream Chasers 3\n\nLast year's rank: No. 11\n\nMaybe Meek Mill yells too much. Maybe Meek Mill will never have a legit pop hit to call his own. Maybe the MMG wave is over. None of that matters because there's one thing about Meek Mill no one can take from him: Bar for bar, he's the best street rapper in his 20s. YG might have had a better debut album and ScHoolboy Q might be a more complete artist (mostly because he's more left field), but Meek has done a better job feeding the streets and building his own fan base off his MMG cosign.\n\nNevermind the fact that his debut album, Dreams and Nightmares, was largely a disappointment that's mostly remembered for its club shaking title track (the song has become something of a legend) or that his last mixtape, Dreamchasers 3, basically came and went. Fans of gangsta rap who are forced to sit and watch as Drake turns out hit after hit are hungry for a hero, and Meek is their savior.\n\nWhat Meek has failed to do the past few years is challenge himself. He's made street anthems and collaborated with big name artists, but for the most part has stuck close to his comfort zone. It would be a welcome change to find this beloved rapper stretch himself on his upcoming Dreams Worth More Than Money, and maybe come up with something great in the process. —Chris Mench\n\n4. Chance The Rapper\n\nAge: 21\n\nLabel: N/A\n\nFrom: Chicago, Illinois\n\nLatest Release: Acid Rap\n\nLast year's rank: No. 8\n\nLast year, Chance the Rapper told Rolling Stone that there was \"no reason\" to sign to a label, calling music a \"dead industry.\" So what's a young rapper to do after dropping one of the most downloaded mixtapes of the year if not use it to secure a record deal? Thrive, apparently.\n\nIn the time since Acid Rap dropped, the Chi-town rapper has graced tracks with Justin Bieber and Lil Wayne and toured alongside Mac Miller, Macklemore, and Eminem. His relentlessly energetic stage presence has made him a festival favorite at SXSW, Lollapalooza, Coachella, Governor's Ball, and Bonnaroo.\n\nMore so than his performance antics, his original musical style is what precedes his success. Where rappers like A$AP Rocky and Joey Bada$$ identify heavily with the well-established soundscapes of southern rap and classic New York hip-hop respectively, Chance has developed an unpredictable style of his own.\n\nEven the songs that he's dropped this year show him experimenting more with singing (\"I Am Very Very Lonely\") and rapping with a fervor and cadence akin to early Beastie Boys (\"Home Studio/Back Up In This Bitch\"). Both are cryptically labeled on his SoundCloud as apart of his \"Social Experiment,\" which was first the name of his tour but is now rumored to be the title of his next project. Plus, Childish Gambino recently announced he has a collaborative project with Chance coming soon. We don't know what's coming first but if Chance proved anything last year, it's that we need to pay attention to what he's doing. —Ashley Reed\n\n3. J. Cole\n\nAge: 29\n\nLabel: Roc Nation/Columbia\n\nFrom: Fayetteville, North Carolina\n\nLatest release: Born Sinner\n\nLast year's rank: No. 3\n\nThe last time we ranked the 20 Best Rappers In Their 20s, it was in the weeks leading up to the release of J. Cole’s sophomore project Born Sinner. The album was a crucial moment for the now 29-year-old MC because even though his debut album sold well, it lacked universal acclaim and featured the kind of songs that infamously \"let Nas down.\" He needed Born Sinner to prove he could live up to the lofty expectations set by fans and himself. His decision to release his album the same day as Kanye's, an unsubtle statement letting everyone know what class he felt he belonged in, heightened the stakes even more.\n\nJust a year later, all of that feels like a distant memory as Cole rests comfortably as one of rap’s most established stars. Born Sinner was a huge commercial success selling nearly 600,000 copies while “Power Trip” and “Crooked Smile” gave Cole an omnipresent radio presence to rival Drake’s. When the five year anniversary of The Warm Up recently passed, it highlighted that Cole is no longer some new kid on the block, but one of rap’s made men—one with a decorated resume and not just pure potential.\n\nSince dropping his last album, Cole made a power move by announcing his own label imprint, Dreamville, earlier this year. Besides that, in typical Cole fashion and atypical of most rappers in 2014, he’s been laying low. But that’s fine with us. Cole won 2014 in a big way and he’s got little to prove. When he does decide to resurface with new music, best believe his rabid fanbase will be ready. —Max Goldberg\n\n2. Kendrick Lamar\n\nAge: 27\n\nLabel: TDE/Aftermath/Interscope\n\nFrom: Compton, California\n\nLatest Release: good kid, m.A.A.d city\n\nLast year's rank: No. 1\n\nAt this point, so much has been written about Kendrick Lamar. Yes, good kid, m.A.A.d. city changed the direction of hip-hop. Yes, his \"Control\" verse set the rap world on fire and put every rapper on this list on their toes. Yes, the dude is a mega-talented and influential presence in a rap scene in desperate need of both.\n\nAll of these things are true, and all of them are important. Yet, what many people seem to miss about the TDE frontman isn't just that he elevated himself to A-list status, but that he's doing it all on his own terms. In an era of fragmented audiences and viral artists with more YouTube hits than skills, Kendrick has created a lane all his own by doing the opposite. So many artists nowadays are chasing an audience. Kendrick Lamar brings the audience to him. He doesn't need the high profile guest features or the most Twitter followers. He doesn't need to be the flashiest rapper. He doesn't talk a big game outside of his raps because he doesn't have to. He simply steps up to the mic and delivers.\n\nKendrick's only real problem this year is that he's been so quiet, that's basically the only reason he's not No. 1. This list is about making the best music and right now, Kendrick isn't releasing much, he's just coasting as he readies his next album. But everyone in rap is waiting for his next album, from teeny boppers to OGs. How many people can you say that for? —Chris Mench\n\n1. Drake\n\nAge: 27\n\nLabel: Young Money/Cash Money/Universal Republic\n\nFrom: Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nLatest release: Nothing Was The Same\n\nLast year's rank: No. 2\n\n“Can I tell truth?” asks Drake on his 2014 anthem “Trophies.” “If I was doing this for you/Then I have nothing left to prove.” That basically sums up Drake’s status in the game right now. At this point, like LeBron, even if he takes a loss, no one can seriously question his talent.\n\nYou can continue to hate on Drake’s singing, his outfits, and his general persona, but with five years as one of rap’s consistently hot stars, Drake has wore down every one of his detractors with hit after hit. It’s why he’s ranked over Kendrick; as Dot readies his next album and stays off the grid, Drake periodically unleashes song after song that sets the Internet on fire. Drake’s such a dominant force in rap that if you tied together all the loosies he’s dropped since Nothing Was The Same, you’d easily have one of the best albums of the year.\n\nAll his success has lead to an interesting predicament for Drake. His greatest gift was his ability to internalize his narrative; when you listen to him striving for success, it serves as the soundtrack to your own ambitions. But Drake has become less relatable because he’s no longer reaching for the top—he’s already there and he knows it. He’s gone from boasting to just saying the facts. He’s made up for it by sharpening his skills and rapping with newfound confidence."
