        "text": "“I like being bossed around by chicks for some reason,” he wrote matter-of-factly.\n\nHis tweet quickly became a subject of discussion as his replies were flooded with a plethora of women saluting Wiz while others used the airtime to troll the Taylor Gang CEO with memes and clips.\n\n“I’m not sure of your childhood but if it was [a] single parent with mom that’s the start,” one fan responded.\n\nDuring his 15-year career, Wiz has been in a number of high-profile relationships with the likes of Amber Rose, model Winnie Harlow, and most recently Aimee Aguilar. It looks as if the couple may have gone their separate ways as they unfollowed each other on Instagram after being spotted together as recently as March.\n\nOn the music side, Khalifa pleased fans with his classic 2013 mixtape Taylor Alderdice finally being brought to streaming service on the smoker’s holiday last month (April 20)."
