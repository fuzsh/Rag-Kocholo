        "text": "There’s almost nothing more entertaining than a 1–2 punch that draws your attention immediately. We’ve seen it over the years in a variety of different instances, we had Kobe & Shaq, Jordan & Pippen, Fey & Pohler, Future & Codeine, Kanye & Jay-Z, Lennon & McCartney. You get it. Good things come in 2's.\n\nSo if this is the case, wouldn’t it make more sense for rappers to collaborate more often than just features on a single song on a project? The two highly esteemed collabs we’re familiar with are Watch The Throne and What A Time To Be Alive. Neither of these two projects really had any significant publicizing prior to their respective drops. They both featured two of the most popular artists at their own times. And they were both decent in length, being in between 11–15 songs (if you include the WTT deluxe version.)\n\nI bumped the living shit out of both of these projects for months on end, there’s just something about two guys being able to go back and forth comfortably with an endless array of bars. It’s like a pick and roll between Chris Paul and Deandre Jordan, you have the slow set up that looks like it isn’t going to be anything too special, and the result is a poster that hangs in a kid’s bed room the following week. In the case of music, Future grumbles at the very beginning of “Digital Dash” and you can just feel that something is about to go fucking down.\n\nBut since there are plenty of rumors of possible projects out there that may or may not be being worked on right now like: Wolves by Kanye and Drake, whatever the project may be called featuring Chance the Rapper and Childish Gambino, the “it’s definitely happening” J. Cole and Kendrick album, and of course, Good Ass Job with Chance & ‘Ye. Let us cook up some other dream like combinations that may or may not be realistic.\n\nDiamonds & Drugs — Future and Young Thug\n\nFuture and Young Thug are both famously known to be associated with Metro Boomin, who could executive produce this hypothetical mixtape. Two of Atlanta’s finest compliment each other very well, with both of their abilities to lay down hooks as easy as they do verses, this could be vicious. Future’s baritone melody that is complimented by the cool, calm, collected scratchiness that makes him special is the perfect partner for Thug’s tendencies, which are all over the place. He may be screeching at the highest pitch to ever come out of Atlanta since Toni Braxton (example: Hercules) or he might come at you with that smooth flow that he showcases on tracks like “Constantly Hating.”\n\nAll of Atlanta would turn up for this shit, Mike WiLL Made It would come on and tune every beat to perfection. T.I. could come in and ad-lib about how fucking raw he was in 2010. Ludacris could bring overweight women to the scene and maybe a couple of Fast and Furious DVD’s to set the mood. Young Jeezy would do his best DMX impression. Gucci Mane would be the interlude general where he just speaks wisdom he learned in prison. Andre 3000 could come on the track “ATLien Gang”, and then nobody would tell Lil’ Jon. It would be perfect!\n\nI Dress Myself- Tyler, the Creator and A$AP Rocky\n\nTyler and A$AP are multi-faceted artists that like to experiment with different things, so this joint album is going to have it’s own clothing line as well designed by the two of them cause all of this is fucking fantasy anyway. So let me be happy in my imagination world where dope shit like this drops every day :’(\n\nTyler has a rich history of producing quality instrumentals that go hand-in-hand with his monotonous voice. When you first listen to Tyler it’s like hearing a bully trying to be as threatening as possible, except he’s talking about drawing donuts and rape. That isn’t to say that he isn’t a clever lyricist, because he definitely is. He’s an artistic genius that is only 25 years old with most likely his best years ahead of him. I just hope that Rocky is involved in them.\n\nRocky hasn’t had a project since ALLA so he’s leaving all of ASAP ROCKY DEFENSE SQUAD without any ammo at the moment. All of his material he has dropped so far as exceeded expectations, to say the least. He absorbs all audiences with his subtle classiness that is similar to a young Jay-Z, he just looks like he would fit in at a ballroom dance. But then you know at some point, shit like this is finna go down.\n\nBoth of these rappers represent different groups, OF & A$AP Mob, so we could expect some pretty dope features. Mutual friend, Vince Staples, isn’t shy about featuring on tracks either so the potential for this album on a feature basis is through the roof. Also, they both show an interest for music that isn’t hip-hop and with the fact that both of these guys like to mix shit up, you could expect some real pop music as well. I mean, Tyler did drop Cherry Bomb.\n\nOthers\n\nWest Boast by YG and The Game\n\nHow fucking hood can an album get. I’m buying this immediately if it ever drops.\n\nTears Running Down My Crewneck by Bryson Tiller and Frank Ocean\n\nFill in crewneck with sweatpants, fitted hat, beard, whatever you desire. You’re listening to it alone on a Tuesday night and you know it too.\n\nIlluminatic Products by Beyonce and Rihanna\n\nYeah, if this dropped, the world would stop. Expectations have officially reached a height that is near impossible to hit. The only thing that would’ve made the first 5 songs of Lemonade more threatening would have been if RiRi was in the background (m)ad-libbing like “Mmmmhmmmm, you done fucked up Hov.”\n\nWeed and More Weed by Wiz Khalifa and Kid Cudi\n\nEvery stoner wouldn’t leave their house for weeks on end, as long as it isn’t Speeding Bullet to Heaven or something as blatantly idiotic as this.\n\nSex in Toronto by Partynextdoor and The Weeknd\n\nFemales are shivering thinking about this potential project. This would set a new standard for late-night texts resulting in hook ups, cause one iPhone accidentally rolling onto this album on shuffle will surely result in a mistake.\n\nBARS YO by Mac Miller and Vince Staples\n\n*fanboys over every single lyric on rapgenius.com for hours on end*"
