There’s so many great rappers, like if we had to battle or some shit, they would just cream me. I don’t really consider myself a rapper, I just happen to have bars, or something like that. I still sing man, I’m a singer, ya feel me?\"\n\nInfluences\n\nWhen asked about his influences, Ty Dolla Sign responded, \"2Pac is my favorite artist of all time. I liked Slum Village a lot back then, like J Dilla, he’s one of my favorite producers and artists. I’m like a hip-hop head type of dude. Mos Def, Talib Kweli, that whole Rawkus Records scene, that’s my type of shit.\" He continued, \"I also like cats like Prince. Just like his production, he's kind of like the same thing as me. He sings, he produces, he plays all types of instruments. That’s what I’m after. I wouldn’t wear that type of clothes or wear my hair like that. [Laughs.] But as far as artistry, that’s the same type of dude I am.\" In an interview he revealed that Kim Burrell was his absolute favorite vocalist, and that Brandy was right there with her.\n\nPersonal life\n\nTy Dolla Sign has a 12 year old daughter named Jailynn.\n\nDiscography\n\nFree TC (2015)"
