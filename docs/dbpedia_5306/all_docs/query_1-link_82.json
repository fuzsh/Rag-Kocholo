        "text": "Wiz Khalifa has the munchies on deck for his fans come this fall.\n\nHe partnered with virtual restaurant brand curator Nextbite to start up a delivery-only restaurant chain called HotBox by Wiz, which will be open for business on Oct. 1.\n\nThe Grammy-nominated rapper personally curated the menu with his favorite dishes, including Blazed Ends, crispy, savory burnt brisket ends smothered in a smoky-sweet BBQ sauce; Taylor Gang Turkey Burger, a juicy turkey patty with fresh lettuce, sliced tomato, onion, creamy mayo and a side of Chip Hits, crispy house-made chips tossed in parmesan and lemon; Mac & Yellow, a gooey bowl of mac and cheese goodness with even more cheese on top; and the Mile High Dark Chocolate Brownie, a delectable dessert.\n\nRestaurants in his hometown Pittsburgh as well as Los Angeles, San Diego, Chicago, Denver, Washington, D.C., Indianapolis, Houston, and New York City will be available for fans to begin ordering from via Uber Eats, DoorDash, Postmates and Grubhub. More locations in major cities will be added monthly based on fan voting, which is available here.\n\nTrending on Billboard"
