        "text": "Wiz Khalifa and Ty Dolla $ign are both big draws in the hip-hop world separately, but when they take the stage together, you have a special moment on your hands. Luckily for those in the audience at last night's Tonight Show taping, they got to see just that, as both rappers turned up to perform their collaboration \"Something New.\"\n\nBathed in soft red backlighting, both men seemed fully integrated with the smooth vibes that their backing band offered up as the instrumental. With his torso draped with plenty of iced-out bling, Wiz Khalifa made an impression with his performance, taping into the effortlessly cool energy that he always brings to the table. Ty Dolla, while dressed in more of a monochromatic outfit, showed off some indelible crooning chops when it came for his time to assist with the bridge and chorus. Check out the full video of their performance below.\n\nWiz Khalifa and Ty Dolla $ign both recently dropped some new material on us as well. The former came through with his Laugh Now, Fly Later mixtape, while the latter presented his strong Beach House 3 LP to the world. Both men had strong outings with those full-length releases but, taking Fallon's intro into consideration, Wiz has some more material on the way in the new year. As for Ty, he always seems to be working on another feature or something in the studio, so additional musical output from him shouldn't necessarily be questioned either.\n\nWhich of those two projects, Laugh Now, Fly Later or Beach House 3, was your favorite? Sound off in the comments.\n\nWiz Khalifa"
