His first cousin, record producer, and Dungeon Family member Rico Wade, encouraged him to sharpen his writing skills and pursue a career as a rapper. He attended Columbia High School. Future voices his praise of Wade's musical influence and instruction, calling him the \"mastermind\" behind his sound.[12] He soon came under the wing of Atlanta's own Rocko who signed him to his label A-1 Recordings. Since then his work ethic has driven him to his success.[13] From 2010 to early 2011, Future released a series of mixtapes including 1000, Dirty Sprite and True Story.[13][14] The latter included the single \"Tony Montana\", in reference to the Scarface film.[14][15] During that time, Future was also partnering with rapper Gucci Mane on their collaborative album Free Bricks, and co-wrote YC's single \"Racks\".[16][17] He gained popularity after his songs were played by DJ Esco at Magic City,[18] a strip club in Atlanta deemed \"largely responsible for launching the careers of artists.\"[19]\n\n2011–2014: Pluto and Honest[]\n\nMain articles: Pluto (Future album), Pluto 3D, Honest (Future album), and Monster (Future album)\n\nFuture signed a major label recording contract with Epic Records fellow American rapper Rocko's A1 Recordings, in September 2011, days before the release of his next mixtape, Streetz Calling.[20] The mixtape was described by XXL magazine as ranging from \"simple and soundly executed boasts\" to \"futuristic drinking and drugging jams\" to \"tales of the grind\".[17] A Pitchfork review remarked that on the mixtape Future comes \"as close as anyone to perfecting this thread of ringtone pop, where singing and rapping are practically the same thing, and conversing 100% through Auto-Tune doesn't mean you still can't talk about how you used to sell drugs. It would almost feel antiquated if Future weren't amassing hits, or if he weren't bringing some subtle new dimensions to the micro-genre.\"[15]\n\nFuture performing in 2014\n\nThough Future had told MTV that Streetz Calling would be his final mixtape prior to the release of his debut studio album, another mixtape, Astronaut Status, was released in January 2012. In December 2011, Future was featured on the cover of Issue #77 of The FADER.[21]Before his album being released in April 2012.[22][23] XXL's Troy Mathews wrote, \"While Astronaut Status is up and down and never really hits the highs like 'Racks', 'Tony Montana', and 'Magic' that fans have come to expect from Future, it’s apparent that he’s poised to continue the buzz of 2011 humming right along into 2012.\"[24] Future was selected to the annual XXL Freshmen list in early 2012.[25] His debut album Pluto, originally planned for January, was eventually released on April 17.[26][27] It included remixes of \"Tony Montana\" featuring Drake and \"Magic\" featuring T.I..[28] According to Future, \"'Magic' was the first record T.I. jumped on when he came outta jail. Like, he was out of jail a day and he jumped straight on the 'Magic' record without me even knowing about it.\"[28] The track became Future's first single to enter the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[29] Other collaborators on the album include Trae Tha Truth, R. Kelly and Snoop Dogg [30] On October 8, 2012, Pusha T released \"Pain\" featuring Future, the first single from his upcoming debut album.\n\nIt was announced that Future will be repackaging his debut album Pluto on November 27, 2012 under the name Pluto 3D featuring 3 new songs and 2 remix songs including the remix for \"Same Damn Time\" featuring Diddy and Ludacris, as well as his newest street single \"Neva End (Remix)\" featuring Kelly Rowland.[31] In 2012, Future wrote, produced and was featured on \"Loveeeeeee Song\" taken from Barbadian singer Rihanna's seventh studio album Unapologetic.\n\nOn January 15, 2013, Future released the compilation mixtape F.B.G.: The Movie which features the artists signed to his Freebandz label: Young Scooter, Slice9, Casino, Mexico Rann and Maceo. It was certified platinum for having over 250,000 downloads on popular mixtape site DatPiff.[32] Future said of his second studio album Future Hendrix it will be a more substantive musical affair than his debut album and features R&B music along with his usual \"street bangers\".

He, along with Ed Sheeran, collaborated with pop musician Taylor Swift on the song \"End Game\" from her album Reputation.[47] The song peaked at number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was Future's eighth top 20 hit.[citation needed]\n\nOn January 11, 2018, Future collaborated alongside Kendrick Lamar, James Blake and Jay Rock for the song, \"King's Dead\", from the soundtrack album of the Marvel Studiossuperhero film Black Panther and Jay Rock's third studio album Redemption. At the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, the song earned two Grammy nominations, for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song, marking Future's first career Grammy nominations.[48]\n\nFuture curated the soundtrack for the movie Superfly (2018 film), which was released in June 2018.[49]\n\nOn October 19, 2018, Future released Wrld On Drugs, a collaborative mixtape with fellow American rapper Juice Wrld.[50] Wrld on Drugs debuted at number two on the US Billboard200 behind A Star Is Born by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, with 98,000 album-equivalent units, which included 8,000 pure album sales.[51] It became Future's tenth top-ten album in the United States, and Juice Wrld's second.[51]\n\n2019: The Wizrd[]\n\nOn January 18, 2019, Future released his seventh studio album, Future Hndrxx Presents: The Wizrd.

Pitchfork Media wrote that Future \"miraculously shows that it's still possible for Auto-Tune to be an interesting artistic tool\", stating that he \"finds a multitude of ways for the software to accentuate and color emotion\".[57] The LA Times wrote that \"Future’s highly processed vocals suggest a man driven to bleary desperation by drugs or love or technology\", stating that his music \"comes closest to conjuring the numbing overstimulation of our time\".[58] GQ stated that he \"has managed to reboot the tired auto-tune sound and mash it into something entirely new\", writing that he \"combines it with a bizarro croon to synthesize how he feels, then [...] stretches and deteriorates his words until they’re less like words, more like raw energy and reactive emotions\".[59] Critic Simon Reynolds wrote that \"he's reinvented blues for the 21st century.\"[60]\n\nRapper T-Pain, who also uses that audio processor, criticized Future's unconventional use of it in 2014.[61] In response, Future stated in an interview that \"when I first used Auto-Tune, I never used it to sing. I wasn’t using it the way T-Pain was. I used it to rap because it makes my voice sound grittier. Now everybody wants to rap in Auto-Tune. Future’s not everybody.\"[62] Future's music has been characterized as trap music.[63]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nWilburn currently has five children with five different women: Jessica Smith, Brittni Mealy, India J, singer Ciara, and Joie Chavis.[64] He was engaged to Ciara in October 2013, but Ciara ended the engagement in August 2014 due to his infidelity.[65] Their son, Future Zahir Wilburn, was born on May 19, 2014.[66] His fifth child, Hendrix, was born on Christmas in 2018.[67]\n\nAs of 2016, Wilburn is being sued by both Jessica Smith and Ciara. Smith is suing him for failing to pay child support, and stated that their son \"suffers from emotional and behavioral issues stemming from Future's neglect as a father\".[68] Ciara is suing him for defamation, slander, and libel.[69] In October 2016, a judge said that Future's string of tweets bashing Ciara did not relate to the $15 million she was asking for.[70]\n\nPrior to his music career in 2004, Wilburn was arrested for theft by receiving stolen property and contempt of court.[71]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nMain article: Future discography\n\nStudio albums[]\n\nPluto (2012)\n\nHonest (2014)\n\nDS2 (2015)\n\nEvol (2016)\n\nFuture (2017)\n\nHndrxx (2017)\n\nThe Wizrd (2019)\n\nCollaborative mixtapes[]\n\nBeast Mode (with Zaytoven) (2015)\n\nWhat a Time to Be Alive (with Drake) (2015)\n\nSuper Slimey (with Young Thug) (2017)\n\nBeast Mode 2 (with Zaytoven) (2018)\n\nWrld on Drugs (with Juice Wrld) (2018)\n\nTours[]\n\nCo-headlining[]\n\nSummer Sixteen Tour (with Drake) (2016)[72]\n\nMeek Mill[]\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to navigationJump to search\n\nRobert Rihmeek Williams (born May 6, 1987),[2] known professionally as Meek Mill, is an American rapper and activist.[3] Raised in Philadelphia, he embarked on his music career as a battle rapper, and later formed a short-lived rap group, The Bloodhoundz. In 2008, Atlanta-based rapper T.I. signed Meek Mill to his first record deal. In February 2011, after leaving Grand Hustle Records, Mill signed with Miami-based rapper Rick Ross's Maybach Music Group (MMG). Mill's debut album, Dreams and Nightmares, was released in 2012 under MMG and Warner Bros. Records. The album, preceded by the lead single \"Amen\", debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200.\n\nIn October 2012, Mill announced the launch of his own label imprint, Dream Chasers Records, named after his mixtape series. Meek Mill often collaborates with fellow MMG label-mates; he is also known for his appearances on MMG's Self Made compilation series, with his first two singles, \"Tupac Back\" and \"Ima Boss\", being included on volume one. In November 2017, he was sentenced to two to four years in prison for violating parole and served five months at the State Correctional Institution – Chester in Chester, Pennsylvania, before being released while his trial continues.\n\nContents[]\n\n1Early life\n\n2Music career\n\n2.12003–10: Career beginnings\n\n2.22011–12: Dreams & Nightmares\n\n2.32013–17: Dreams Worth More Than Money, DC4 and Wins & Losses\n\n2.42018–present: Championships\n\n3Dream Chasers Records\n\n4Legal issues\n\n4.1Criminal proceedings\n\n4.2Civil suit\n\n5Controversies\n\n5.1\"Amen\"\n\n5.2Feuds\n\n5.2.1Cassidy\n\n5.2.2Drake\n\n5.2.3The Game\n\n5.2.4Beanie Sigel\n\n5.2.5Other feuds\n\n6Personal life\n\n7Discography\n\n8Notes\n\n9References\n\nEarly life[]\n\nMeek Mill was born Robert Rihmeek Williams[4] on May 6, 1987[2] in South Philadelphia, the son of Kathy Williams. He has an older sister, Nasheema Williams. Kathy grew up in poverty and her mother died when she was young. Meek's father was killed when Meek was five years old, apparently during an attempted robbery. His uncle, Robert, described Meek Mill's father as a \"black sheep of the family\". After her husband's death, Kathy moved with Meek and his sister to North Philadelphia, where they lived in a three-bedroom apartment on Berks Street. Their financial condition was poor and she started cutting hair, doing other jobs, and shoplifting in order to support her family.[5] At home, Meek Mill was shy and rarely spoke. As a kid, he became acquainted with another one of his father’s brothers, who went by the MC name \"Grandmaster Nell\", who was a pioneering disc jockey(DJ) in the late-1980s Philadelphia hip-hop scene and influenced rap artists Will Smith and DJ Jazzy Jeff. Meek's interest in hip-hop grew as a result of these early influences. He was also influenced by the independent hip-hop artists Chic Raw and Vodka, whom he used to emulate by watching their DVDs.[6][7]\n\nDuring his early teenage years, Meek Mill often took part in rap battles, under the pseudonym Meek Millz. He’d often stay up well past midnight filling notebooks with phrases and verses that he’d later draw on. Later he and three friends formed the rap group, The Bloodhoundz. They bought blank CDs and jewel cases at Kinko's, encouraging friends to burn them with the group's songs and distribute them. When he was 18, while walking to a corner store armed, Meek Mill was arrested for illegally possessing a firearm and was beaten up by the police. Because of the beating, his lips and both eyes became swollen and one of his braids was ripped out. He was charged with assaulting the police after two black cops gave a statement against him in the case, saying he chased them down with a gun and tried to kill them. He was then placed on probation.[6][7][8]\n\nMusic career[]\n\n2003–10: Career beginnings[]\n\nThe Bloodhoundz lasted long enough to release four mixtapes.[9] In 2008, Mill released his fourth solo mixtape, Flamers 2: Hottest in tha City, which spawned the promotional singles \"I'm So Fly,\" \"Prolli,\" and \"Hottest in the City.\" Flamers 2 caught the attention of Charlie Mack, founder and President of 215 Aphillyated Records. Mack was so impressed with Mill that he immediately signed him to his management company. During that same year, Meek Mill also met the founder and owner of Grand Hustle Records, Atlanta-based rapper and record executive T.I.[10] T.I. was also impressed by Mill and offered him an opportunity to travel, to meet with him and Warner Bros. Records; within a week both record companies offered him a deal. Although he was offered other record deals, Mill felt collaborating with T.I. was \"an opportunity of a lifetime\" and thus chose his label. However, a setback occurred: Mill was arrested, charged with gun and drug possession, and ordered to serve seven months in prison. He was released in early 2009.[9]\n\nUnder Grand Hustle, Mill formed a work relationship with the label's resident disc jockey, DJ Drama. Mill and Drama teamed up to release the third edition of Mill's Flamers series. The mixtape, titled Flamers 3: The Wait Is Over, was released on March 12, 2010, and is helmed as a \"Gangsta Grillz mixtape\".[11][12] The mixtape features his promotional single \"Rosé Red\", which was later remixed with additional verses from fellow American rappers T.I., Rick Ross and Vado.[11] Rick Ross contributed his verse after he was visiting Philadelphia and asked his Twitter followers who he should collaborate with; Meek Mill was the overwhelming response.[11] The remix was included on Mill's following mixtape, Mr. Philadelphia.[13] Due to Mill's and Grand Hustle label-boss T.I.'s respective legal troubles, Mill was never able to release an official album under Grand Hustle and they parted ways in 2010.[14]\n\n2011–12: Dreams & Nightmares[]\n\nIn February 2011, Rick Ross announced the signing of Mill along with fellow American rapper Wale to his Maybach Music Group (MMG) label. In March 2011, Mill was included in XXL's \"Freshman Class of 2011\".[15] Later that year, he released his debut single, \"Tupac Back\", featuring Rick Ross, from his label's compilation album Self Made Vol. 1 (2011). That same year he released his second single, \"Ima Boss\", also take from the compilation and featuring Ross. The song was later remixed, featuring T.I., Birdman, Lil Wayne, DJ Khaled, Swizz Beatz and Rick Ross. The remix charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at #51, becoming Mill's most successful single at that time. In August 2011, Mill released Dreamchasers, a well received mixtape featuring his urban hit \"House Party\" and guest appearances from Rick Ross, Yo Gotti and Beanie Siegel among others.\n\nIn February 2012, MTV listed Meek Mill as the \"#7 hottest MC\" in their annual \"Hottest MCs in the Game\" list.[16] On May 7, 2012, Mill released the second installment to his Dreamchasers series.[17] Within six hours of its release on mixtape website DatPiff.com, Dreamchasers 2 was downloaded 1.5 million times.[18] On May 10, it was announced Meek Mill signed with Roc Nation management.[19]\n\nOn June 19, 2012, \"Amen\" - originally included on Dreamchasers 2, was released as the lead single from Mill's debut studio album. Before releasing his debut studio album Dreams & Nightmares, Mill received co-signs from both Mariah Carey and Nas, with him appearing on Carey's 2012 single \"Triumphant (Get 'Em)\" and the latter stating, \"I got my eyes on him. He's the next one to take this shit over.\" The album was released on October 30, 2012.[20] Following an album release party in Philadelphia, Mill was detained by Philadelphia police after a car in which he was riding in was pulled over. No charges were filed, and Mill was released from custody.[21] The album debuted at number 2 on the US Billboard 200chart with first-week sales of 165,000 copies.[22] In its second week the album sold 41,000 more copies dropping 6 spots on the chart to number 8.[22]\n\n2013–17: Dreams Worth More Than Money, DC4 and Wins & Losses[]\n\nMain articles: Dreams Worth More Than Money, DC4 (mixtape), and Wins & Losses\n\nMill released the third installment of the Dreamchasers series, Dreamchasers 3.[23] The mixtape featured guest appearances from Rick Ross, Akon, Future, Waka Flocka Flame, Wale, Trina and Jadakiss among others.[23][24] The mixtape was scheduled to be released on May 6, 2013.[25] However, he had announced that it would be pushed back, eventually to be released on September 29, 2013.[26] In November 2013, Mill announced that he was half-way finished with his second studio album. On March 8, 2014, Mill announced that the album would be titled Dreams Worth More Than Money.[27][28] Mill's album, Dreams Worth More Than Money, which was released on June 28, 2015, topped the Billboard 200as of the issue dated July 18, 2015.\n\nMeek Mill posted 6 videos on his Instagram previewing music for his mixtape, DC4.[29] The mixtape was planned to have featured a remix of his enemy, Drake's song, \"Back to Back\", and a remix to Drake and Future's song, \"I'm the Plug\", but unfortunately, due to DC4 being released commercially, neither of these two remixes made the final cut.[citation needed][30] On January 16, 2016, Meek Mill dropped songs on his extended play, 4/4, with 4 tracks.[31] On January 30, 2016, Meek Mill released another extended play title 4/4, Pt. 2.[32] Meek Mill spent $50,000 to donate 60,000 water bottles to contribute to the Flint Water Crisis.[33] Later in August 2018, Mill donated 6000 backpacks to students of Philadelphia.[34][35]\n\nMeek Mill released DC4 on October 28, 2016.[36]\n\nOn July 21, 2017, Mill released his third studio album titled Wins & Losses.[37]\n\n2018–present: Championships[]\n\nMain article: Championships (album)\n\nOn November 16, 2018, Mill announced his fourth album, Championships, which was released on November 30.[38] The album received positive reviews from critics and debuted atop the US Billboard 200, selling 229,000 album-equivalent units in its first week (42,000 coming from pure sales).[39]\n\nDream Chasers Records[]\n\nOn October 26, 2012, Meek Mill announced the launch of his own record label imprint, Dream Chasers Records with the flagship artists Louie V. Gutta, Lee Mazin and Goldie.[40] In April 2013, he also signed 17-year-old Louisiana rapper Lil Snupe moments after hearing his demo.[41] The label has since released mixtapes by Louie V. Gutta and Lil Snupe.[42]\n\nOn June 20, 2013, Lil Snupe was murdered at an apartment building in Winnfield, Louisiana, by two gunshots to the chest.[43][44] A warrant was issued for 36-year-old Tony Holden in connection with the shooting.[45] Holden was on the run from police for four days before turning himself in to authorities.[46]\n\nIn late 2014, he signed his cousin and rapper Omelly to the imprint.[47]\n\nOn May 29, 2016, Mill signed producer Nikolas Papamitrou (Nick Papz) to the label.[48][49][50][51]\n\nCurrent artists\n\nChino[52]\n\nOmelly[53]\n\nNick Papz\n\nYBS Skola[54]\n\nFormer artists\n\nGoldie\n\nGuordan Banks\n\nLee Mazin\n\nLil Snupe\n\nLouie V Gutta[55]\n\nLegal issues[]\n\nCriminal proceedings[]\n\nMill was arrested for illegally possessing a firearm and assaulting a policeman when he was 18 years old. He was put on probation.[6][8] In 2008, Mill was convicted of drug dealing and gun possession and was sentenced to 11 to 23 months in prison by Judge Genece Brinkley.[56] After Mill's 2008 conviction, Brinkley would continue to handle Mill's further legal cases. Mill was released during the early portion of 2009 under a five-year parole agreement.[6][57][58][59] In December 2012, Mill was found to have violated his probation and the judge revoked Mill's travel permit.[60]\n\nIn May 2013, Mill was again found to have violated his probation and was ordered to take etiquette classes by Brinkley. The violation was a failure to report travel plans as required and social media postings that resulted in death threats to the judge, assistant district attorney (ADA), and probation officer assigned his case.[58] In requiring the classes and stressing the requirement to report travel, Brinkley noted, \"You need to try to get this right next time.\"[59] In June 2013, the court noted that Mill continually failed to report his travel plans. Brinkley established an August deadline for the classes, noting that Mill has \"a lot of issues\" and that the classes would provide him with a \"big-picture perspective\" of his personal and professional actions. Brinkley stated the classes were \"more important than any concerts he might have.\"[61] Of the requirement to provide travel plans to his probation officer, Mill complained, \"You just gonna miss money all day.\" The ADA explained that it was a consequence of being on probation.[62] On July 11, 2014, Mill had his probation revoked and he was sentenced to three to six months in jail.[63] He was released from jail on December 2, 2014.[64][a]\n\nHe was found guilty for a parole violation again on December 17, 2015. The judge hearing his case refused to give him another chance and ordered him not to work or perform before his sentencing on February 5, 2016.[65] He was sentenced to 90 days of house arrest on February 5. The sentence became effective from March 1 during which he was not allowed to work and was required to do daily community service with groups serving adults. Additionally, he was also sentenced to six more years of probation.[66] On June 2, 2016, Meek Mill was sentenced to eight additional days of house arrest.[67] His house arrest came to an end in mid-June 2016.[68]\n\nOn March 11, 2017, Mill was arrested at a local airport in St. Louis, Missouri for assaulting two pedestrians. Shortly after his arrest and court appearance, he was given a court summons.[69][70] On November 6, 2017, he was sentenced to two to four years in state prison for violating his parole.[71][72]\n\nReports alleged that there was an investigation by the FBI into the conduct of the judge presiding over his case, Judge Brinkley.[73] This was later publicly acknowledged by Mill's defense team.[74] Meek's attorney, Joe Tacopina, made several allegations of inappropriate statements and actions from Brinkley, including that \"she requested he re-record a Boyz II Men song and shout her out, and how she wanted him to leave Roc Nation to sign with a friend of hers\" and that \"she showed up at his community service\" when a typical judge would not do that, among several other irregularities.[75]\n\nIn February 2018, the officer of Mill's original 2007 case was brought under scrutiny for the potential mishandling of his arrest. This comes upon a whistle-blower's testimony responsible for the revelation of hundreds of other corrupt officers. An appeal to reverse Mill's conviction was submitted.[76]\n\nOn April 24, 2018, Mill was released pending the outcome of the appeal to the Pennsylvania supreme court.[77] The Philadelphia district attorney had petitioned Judge Brinkley for his release, citing credibility issues with the arresting officer in his initial 2008 conviction.[78][79] Brinkley had declined and instead scheduled the case for a hearing.[78] Hours after his release from prison, Michael G. Rubin, a minority owner of the Philadelphia 76ers and long-time supporter of Mill, flew Mill in by helicopter to a 76ers basketball game to perform a ceremonial bell-ringing on the court before the start of the game.[80] Garnering support from other public figures such as Jay-Z and Kevin Hart, Mill has stated that he would like to use his situation to \"shine a light\" on the criminal justice system.[81][76]\n\nWith Mill's continuous arrests and probation from Judge Brinkley, he is estimated by his booking agency and management to have lost millions of dollars in profit.[82] As of April 25, 2018, Brinkley continues to handle Mill's legal cases.[83]\n\nCivil suit[]\n\nOn November 29, 2017, Meek Mill and Roc Nation were sued by the family of Jaquan Graves, who was shot and killed in the parking lot outside a Connecticut concert in December 2016. Graves had just left the facility when gunfire started and he was killed. The lawsuit also claimed that Meek and Roc Nation allowed \"thugs\" to remain on the premises after exhibiting disorderly, disruptive, argumentative, angry and agitated behaviors toward patrons.[84]\n\nControversies[]\n\n\"Amen\"[]\n\nFollowing the release of the lead single for Dreams & Nightmares, entitled \"Amen\", Philadelphia area pastor Rev. Jomo K. Johnson called for a boycott of Mill due to the lyrical content of \"Amen\". In a statement, he said that, \"As a hip-hop fan, I want to encourage every rap fan in Philadelphia who is a believer in Jesus Christ, to boycott Meek Mill until he acknowledges this blatant disrespect. And being resident of North Philadelphia and pastor, I revoke Meek's 'hood pass' until this happens.\"[85] On July 17, in an interview on the BETshow 106 & Park, Mill stated, \"I don't think no preacher or no church approves of any type of rap music—because rap music, period, is a lot of bad stuff said. But at the end of the day, it's real life. And me, I wasn't trying to disrespect no religion or anything like that.\"[86]\n\nFeuds[]\n\nCassidy[]\n\nA feud started between Meek Mill and fellow Philadelphia-born rapper Cassidy, when Mill offered to battle several underground rappers including Cassidy. Cassidy would later accept the challenge, adding \"if the money was right\". They participated in a short social exchange, after which Cassidy released \"The Diary of a Hustla\", which was originally thought to be a diss track towards Mill. This was later refuted by Cassidy.[87] They both asked $100,000 each for the battle to take place.[88][89] However, after Meek Mill dissed Cassidy's song, \"Condom Style\" (a remake of Psy's \"Gangnam Style\"), Cassidy released a formal diss track towards Mill with \"Me, Myself & iPhone\".[90][91] Afterwards, Meek Mill responded with the diss track \"Repo\", which Mill later said would be the final diss record he would release against Cassidy.[92]\n\nCassidy later said the feud was not personal, saying it was all in the spirit of hip hop.[93] On January 6, 2013, Cassidy released a 10-minute-long diss response titled \"Raid\".[94] Eight months later, on September 5, 2013, Meek Mill released another diss record towards Cassidy, titled \"Kendrick You Next\". This was despite the fact that he said \"Repo\" would be his final diss record.[95] Three days later, Cassidy released a diss record titled \"Catch A Body\", as a response.[96] Since then, their feud seemed to have calmed down.[citation needed]\n\nDrake[]\n\nIn July 2015, Meek Mill publicly criticized Canadian Toronto-based entertainer Drake on Twitter, calling him out for not writing his own lyrics. In a series of tweets, the rapper claimed his counterpart used a ghostwriter for \"R.I.C.O.\", a song off Mill's second album, Dreams Worth More Than Money.[97] He also admitted that he was upset that Drake didn't promote the album on Twitter, upon its release. “Stop comparing Drake [to me too]. He don't write his own raps. That's why he ain't tweet my album because we found out!”, Meek Mill commented.[98][99] Meek Mill had identified the ghostwriter as Quentin Miller, a local rapper from Atlanta. Meek Mill's claims received support from Funkmaster Flex, an American hip hop DJ on New York City's Hot 97 radio station. Flex released multiple audio recordings of reference tracks featuring Quentin Miller performing the soon-to-be Drake songs, \"10 Bands\", \"Used To\", \"Know Yourself\" and his guest verse on \"R.I.C.O.\"[100] Drake was later supported by his long-time friend, collaborator and co-founder of OVO Sound, award-winning multi-platinum selling producer 40, who claimed that not only does Drake write his own songs, he has also written number-one records for other artists. \"No one is as talented as Drake… [there are] countless number ones and songs Drake has written for others never mind himself\", 40 said on Twitter.[101]\n\nOn July 25, 2015, Drake premiered a track, titled \"Charged Up\" on the Beats 1 OVO Radio Show that is widely seen as a response to Meek Mill's allegations. Drake highlighted Meek Mill's relatively low sales volume and further claimed that the rapper was fading into obscurity.[102][103] Drake also dissed Funkmaster Flex by promoting his rival DJ Clue?. On July 29, Drake released an aggressive diss track, named \"Back to Back\", that further attacked Meek Mill. The track, streamed over 500,000 times in 4 hours, heavily suggested that Mill's relationship with Nicki Minaj is lopsided in the latter's favor and also further criticized the former for not responding to \"Charged Up\" and for only relying on Twitter to attack Drake.[104] The track was released for streaming on the OVO SoundCloud account and on Apple Music.[105] The next day, Meek Mill released a track attacking Drake titled \"Wanna Know\" through Funkmaster Flex on Hot 97.[106] On \"Wanna Know\", Meek Mill revealed another reference track, ghostwritten by Quentin Miller for Drake, who he criticized for being soft.[107] Meek Mill also dissed AR-Ab on the track[108] and furthermore claimed that Drake was urinated on inside a movie theatre. Mill then removed the song from SoundCloud and said that he was moving on from his feud with Drake.[109][110]\n\nOn January 30, 2016, Drake released a new diss track aimed at Mill, titled \"Summer Sixteen\", as the buzz single, used to promote his fourth studio album, Views.[111] Less than fifteen minutes later, Mill released a response track with label mate Omelly called \"War Pain\".[112] The track references several lines from \"Summer Sixteen\", including an incident in which Drake played \"Back to Back\" in a public hotel, in which, he had a room directly above Mill. Four months later, Mill released a remix of Fat Joe and Remy Ma's \"All the Way Up\" with fellow rappers Fabolous and Jadakiss. Meek directly references Drake in several lines of the song, such as \"If you didn't write it, don't record it.\" He also implied that he was in a relationship with Drake's current love interest, Rihanna.[113] Meek Mill and Drake were both respectively endorsed by Burger King and Whataburger for their feud.[114]\n\nAfter Mill's release from prison, the beef was officially squashed; Drake features on Mill's post-incarceration album Championships.[115]\n\nThe Game[]\n\nOn September 16, 2016, The Game released a five-minute freestyle, \"92 Bars\", which was rumored to be a diss towards Meek Mill.[116][117] Previously, Mill and Game collaborated on 2015's \"The Soundtrack\".[118] Hours after the release of \"92 Bars\", Game admitted that the freestyle was specifically a diss towards Mill. The next day, the two rappers ended up in a Instagram exchange, with The Game cyber-flirting with Meek Mill's girlfriend, Nicki Minaj, as well as accusing him of calling the police, informing the authorities about a robbery involving Sean Kingston.[119] On September 18, Meek Mill released a diss track towards Game, a remix to Young M.A.'s \"OOOUUU\" with Omelly and Beanie Sigel. Two days later, The Game responded with \"Pest Control\", using the same beat and sending shots at Meek Mill, Omelly, Beanie Sigel, and Sean Kingston.[120][121] In 2018 the two reconciled after Mill's incarceration and subsequent release from prison.[122]\n\nBeanie Sigel[]\n\nA dispute between Meek Mill and fellow Philadelphia-based rapper Beanie Sigel ensued on September 26, 2016, when the latter ridiculed the former's intelligence towards him through a radio interview.[123] Minutes after the interview, Sigel was punched on the back of his head by whoever was believed to have been one of Meek Mill's affiliates.[124] Then, three days later, Mill criticized Sigel through many derogatory messages via Instagram.[125] Later, Mill dissed Sigel, The Game and Drake in a freestyle on Funkmaster Flex's radio show.[126] Sigel responded by releasing a diss track titled “I'm Coming”.[127]\n\nOther feuds[]\n\nIn August 2013, Kendrick Lamar mentioned Meek Mill, J. Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale, Pusha T, ASAP Rocky, Drake, Big Sean, Jay Electronica, Tyler, The Creator and Mac Miller on his guest verse on Big Sean's \"Control\". Lamar touted himself to becoming the king of both coasts and threatened to \"murder\" the rappers that he mentioned before, despite being associated with them before.[128] During a performance at a music festival in New York City, Mill sent derogatory messages towards Lamar.[129] On September 9, 2013, Mill later released \"Ooh, Kill 'Em\", a response to Lamar's verse on \"Control\".[130][131]\n\nIn October 2013, Mill ran into a social fight with fellow Maybach Music Group artist Wale, for not backing him up on his feud with Cassidy, hence the fact that the latter dissed Wale and several others, with whom Mill affiliated with. He also criticized Wale for not helping him support his second studio album.[132] Two years later, their dispute reignited after Wale sided with another of Mill's rivals, Drake.[133][134] However, after a long talk with mentor Rick Ross, the three later paired for \"Make It Work\", which was released on July 8, 2016[135]\n\nMill's dispute with AR-Ab ensued after the former's rival, Drake, referenced the latter on his song \"Back to Back\" where he says \"I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at? I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-Ab.\" AR-Ab later appeared on VladTV in August 2015, saying that he hasn't signed to Drake's OVO Sound and sided with him. He was also disappointed at Mill's response, since he called out AR-Ab on \"Wanna Know\", the response to Drake's diss track. Mill responded on August 6 during a performance at the BB&T Pavilion in Camden, New Jersey, where he said \"fuck AR-Ab\" and questioned his allegiance to an out-of-town rapper. AR-Ab responded by releasing his own version of \"Back to Back\" on August 8, which disses Mill and also contained violent lyrics where he threatened to unleash his \"shooters\" upon Mill.[136][137][138] In response, Meek's cousin and Dream Chasers signee Omelly released his own version of \"Back to Back\", which dissed AR-Ab. AR-Ab did another interview on VladTV, where he said Mill was too scared to respond himself and Omelly was the \"softest one on Dream Chasers\". He also told that he won't respond to Omelly's diss because he's a \"worker\".[139] In January 2016, AR-Ab revealed that he and Mill had talked it out and their feud was now over.[140]\n\nOn January 25, 2016, Mill dissed his record label boss Rick Ross' long-term nemesis, 50 Cent, through his extended play, 4/4 (not counting the remix to Drake and Future's \"I'm the Plug\").[141] After hearing the EP, 50 Cent replied with a set of over 22 memes, including one where he said that he should run to his girlfriend at the time, Nicki Minaj and cry to her.[142] With a fact that both Minaj and 50 are based from the same city (Jamaica, Queens, New York), Mill, careless, disparaged 50 unkindly with a direct message, ridiculing his case involving Rick Ross' ex-girlfriend, followed up by his bankruptcy case.[143] On January 30, 2016, Mill dissed 50 again on \"War Pain\", in the middle of his verse, saying \"My Philly boys will creep up on you when you ain't looking, with your little memes.\"[144] The next day, 50 and many members of his collective G-Unit counter dissed Mill at a concert, parts unknown.[145] The conflict between Meek Mill and 50 Cent also reignited the feud between the latter and Mill's mentor, Rick Ross.[citation needed]\n\nOn June 30, 2016, Joe Budden dissed Meek Mill and Drake on \"Making a Murderer, Pt. 1\", a counter diss to the latter's \"4PM in Calabasas\", as well as his guest verse to French Montana's \"No Shopping\".[146]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nFollowing his release from his three-to-six month prison sentence for probation violation on December 2, 2014, Mill began dating rapper and singer Nicki Minaj in early 2015; he accompanied her as an opening act on her 2015 world tour.[147][148] On January 2, 2017, it was reported that Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj had ended their two-year relationship.[149][150][151] Their breakup is furthermore detailed on Minaj's 2017 single, \"Regret in Your Tears\".[152]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nMain article: Meek Mill discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nDreams and Nightmares (2012)\n\nDreams Worth More Than Money (2015)\n\nWins & Losses (2017)\n\nChampionships (2018)[153]\n\nSean Michael Leonard Anderson[1] (born March 25, 1988), known professionally as Big Sean,[2] is an American rapper.

When he was 3 months old, he moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he was raised by his mother, a school teacher, and his grandmother.[2][4]Anderson's grandmother, Mildred Leonard, served in World War II, and was one of the first ever black female captains in the United States Army.[5] He attended the Detroit Waldorf School and graduated from Cass Technical High School with a 3.7 GPA.[6] In his later years in high school, Sean showed his rhyming skills on a weekly basis as part of a rap battle contest held by Detroit hip-hop station WHTD.[7] In 2005, Kanye West was doing a radio interview at 102.7 FM. Hearing about this, Sean headed over to the station to meet West and perform some freestyle. Initially West was reluctant to hear him, however he gave Sean 16 bars to rap for him. According to Big Sean, West enjoyed his freestyle: \"As we get to the entrance of the radio station ... we stopped in the middle of the doorway. He starts looking at me and bobbing his head.\"[8] After the freestyle, Sean left West his demo tape. Two years later, West signed Big Sean to GOOD Music. Sean has cited West, Eminem, The Notorious B.I.G., and J Dilla as his influences.[9][10]\n\n2007–10: Mixtapes and internet following[]\n\nSean in 2009.\n\nOn September 30, 2007, Big Sean released his first official mixtape Finally Famous: The Mixtape.

With three children, his mother was dependent on welfare for financial support. Kharbouch eventually found himself the primary breadwinner for the family.[1]\n\nCareer[]\n\n2002–10: Cocaine City Records[]\n\nFrench Montana began his career as a battle rapper in his teens under the name Young French. In 2002, French and close friend Cams created a series of street DVDs called Cocaine City, drawing inspiration from the Smack DVD series popular at the time.[5][6] The series featured interviews with major and upcoming rappers, personalities, and a focus on street music and hip hop beefs.[1][5][7] Initially as Young French, he used the DVDs as a means of showcasing his talent as an underground artist, including in it his own original music, freestyles, and collaborations with other artists. The first volume in the series featured Pee Wee Kirkland and Remy Ma among others.[5][4] What started out as a medium for developing an audience, quickly grew into one of the top-selling street DVDs.[6] The series ran for eight years between 2002-2010, totaling 14 volumes, and multiple spinoff films. Based out of the Bronx, French ran the series with the help of childhood friends including Brock, Droop Pop and Cheeze, who went on to become the first rappers that formed the Coke Boys.[8][9]\n\nIn 2003, French suffered a gunshot to the head when he was confronted by two armed gunmen as he was leaving a recording studio in the Bronx.[10][11][5] The incident resulted in one of the gunmen dead, in what is believed to be a case of \"friendly fire\" by one assailant against the other.[10][12] French was then hospitalized for several weeks.[5][12] Upon discharge, he discovered that he was set up by someone close to him and his circle.[10]\n\nIn 2007, French Montana released his debut mixtape French Revolution Vol. 1, which included collaborations with Uncle Murda, Jae Millz, Mazaradi Fox and Tony Yayo. The track \"Quarter to Eight\" was the first of many collaborations with Rick Ross. The J.Cardim-produced \"Straight Cash\" was French's first underground hit. In 2008, he released his second mixtape, Live From Africa.[13] The song \"Waavvy\" was the first collaboration with rapper Max B.\n\nFrench Montana and Max B released their debut collaborative mixtape Coke Wave on February 6, 2009. A few weeks later, on February 23, Max B's mixtape Quarantine was released, while French released his The Laundry Man on February 24, 2009.[14] The two artists resumed concentrating on their solo records, until the release of their second collaborative mixtape Coke Wave 2 in November that year.\n\nFrench was included in XXL's Freshman Class of 2012. At that time he had already been signed to Bad Boy Records following the success of his single \"Shot Caller\", and had just signed a joint-venture between Bad Boy and Maybach Music Group.[7]\n\nHarry Fraud and the Chinatown raid[]\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, close friend and producer Harry Fraud revealed first meeting French Montana during a recording session at a studio in Chinatown.[15]Fraud recalls recording a song for someone which French happened to have a guest feature on. In an unusual turn of events, the building was raided by police after a tip-off that there were counterfeit Gucci and Louis Vuitton purses being manufactured at the same building.[15] Having lost his studio spot, Fraud went on to form his own studio in Brooklyn, where the two \"met and formed a bond\".[15]\n\nHarry Fraud, who hails from a musical family background and had interned at a recording studio,[16] was still unknown professionally at the time. The two released their first collaboration \"New York Minute\", featuring Jadakiss, off of French's fifth mixtape Mac Wit Da Cheese released on April 19, 2009.[17] Following its success, the two artists recorded \"We Playin In The Wind\" off of French's sixth mixtape The Laundry Man 2 released on June 29.[18] With \"New York Minute\" still buzzing in the city, rapper Ma$e would approach French Montana to hop on the remix,[19] included in French's eighth mixtape Coke Wave 2 released in November. Since then, Harry Fraud's production has been a staple among French's music, and Fraud has since ventured out into working with various other artists. Fraud gained mainstream attention when his track with French Montana \"Shot Caller\" became one of the most added tracks on urban contemporary radio in 2011-2012.[2]\n\nGaby Acevedo and signing with Akon[]\n\nStarting in 2009, French Montana had signed a deal with Akon and his Konvict Music label.[20] The two previously met in Miami in 2008,[21] and later appeared on DJ Green Lantern's \"Invasion Radio\" on SiriusXM's Hip-Hop Nation.[22] The pair collaborated on a series of tracks including their first single \"Married to the Streets\" on French's seventh mixtape Cocaine Konvicts released on September 25.[23][24] In later interviews, French revealed that he had a \"shopping deal\" with Akon for a six months to a year period.[5][25] \"A shopping deal is when an artist takes a liking in you, and they try to take you to a label to get you signed. I was gonna go get signed to his label, but they were going through problems with Interscope. [As a result] my deal was over with him, so I went and did my own thing\", claimed French in his 2012 interview with Complex.[5] Akon, whom French refers to as \"big brother\",[26] would continue to maintain a relationship with French, collaborating on songs together despite the unsuccessful deal between the two.\n\nFrench had met Akon through their mutual friend Gaby Acevedo.[20][24] Acevedo was then-president of SRC Records – under founder and chairman Steve Rifkind — the label first responsible for breaking out artists such as Akon, David Banner, and Remy Ma, then a member of Fat Joe's Terror Squad.[24] Acevedo, whom French had befriended during his time working on the Cocaine City DVDs, had put his music on to Akon who then approached French inviting him to meet him in Florida.[20][24] Although the Akon deal was short-lived, Acevedo would eventually go on to become French's manager following his mainstream breakout. In 2012, with Rifkind leaving SRC's parent company Universal Music Group in September, the SRC imprint would close shop as well. With French's management deal with Mizay Entertainment having recently ended, Gaby Acevedo would postpone retirement to become his new manager, where he now spends his time on the road touring with French.[24]\n\n2010–11: Choppa Choppa Down and southern breakout[]\n\nFrench released his tenth mixtape Coke Boys on September 15, 2010, which included collaborations with Three 6 Mafia, Gucci Mane, Akon, Fat Joe, fellow Coke Boys, among others.[27] The record which included the track \"Choppa Choppa Down\", featuring Waka Flocka Flame, became a hit among clubs and radio throughout the south.[28][29] Waka Flocka, who recently broken into the mainstream with his single \"Hard In Da Paint\" released on May 13, had recorded the song earlier that year while Gucci Mane was still in prison. An early remix to the song, featuring French Montana, was included in French's ninth mixtape Mac & Cheese 2 released earlier that year on May 6 and which also included collaborations with rising stars Wiz Khalifa, Nicki Minaj, Big Sean, Curren$y and Nipsey Hussle among others.[30] The two respective breakout tracks would kick off the start of a close relationship between French and Waka Flocka, where the two describe themselves as being \"brothers\".[31]\n\nSigning with Debra Antney[]\n\nOn November 18, 2010, XXL magazine reported on French Montana having signed with Atlanta-based management firm Mizay Entertainment, headed by Debra Antney.[32] Debra, who is Waka Flocka's mother, was also manager to Gucci Mane, OJ Da Juiceman, rising star Lex Luger and the 808 Mafia production team, and formerly Nicki Minaj prior to her mainstream breakout.[33][34] The music video for \"Choppa Choppa Down\",[35] which featured a Black Hawk Down theme, was released in late-January and included cameos from Gucci, Shawty Lo, DJ Holiday and members of Brick Squad Monopoly.[36][37] With the success of the Coke Boys mixtape and his recent management deal with Debra, French adopted a recurring trap influence among his music. in 2013, Debra Antney sued French Montana for dealing behind her back for commission. In 2017, Debra won the lawsuitagainst him for which he was obliged to pay $2 million to Debra.[38]\n\nOn February 15, French released his eleventh mixtape Mister 16: Casino Life, which featured productions from Fraud and Lex Luger among others, including his soon-to-be next hit \"Shot Caller\".[39] The tape's combination of hard trap beats alongside the more soulful beats – such as those of his New York producer Harry Fraud – would become a fixture among French's music. The latter sound being further explored in his twelfth mixtape Coke Boys 2 released on August 19,[40] providing a softer break from his more robust tapes that year. Both records have been acclaimed for their production and hooks. French would continue on his increasing presence in the South, releasing his collaborative mixtape with Waka Flocka called Lock Out on December 14. That same month, he would release his long-awaited collaborative mixtape Cocaine Mafia with Memphis-based rappers Juicy J and Project Pat, released on December 19.[41] This would be French's thirteenth and fourteenth mixtapes, respectively. With four records out in 2011, it would be his busiest year of releases since 2009. In a 2012 interview with Parlé magazine, French revealed his deal with Mizay Entertainment as having been for a year and a half.[25]\n\nCollaborating with Rick Ross[]\n\nWith French's growing buzz in the South, he was approached by Florida-based rapper Rick Ross who invited him to his studio.[19] French, who admits having been a fan of Ross' music, was invited to come \"at like three in the morning\" where he listened to his upcoming MMG collaborative album Self Made Vol. 1.[19] The two recorded a track for the album, while Ross hopped on the remix to \"Choppa Choppa Down\".[19] The new single, which also featured Wiz Khalifa, was released on April 28, 2011, with the music video coming out in June.[42] An earlier remix featuring Gucci Mane and Wiz Khalifa had been released on March 25. The collaboration would mark the start of French's relationship with Rick Ross and his Maybach Music Group, prompting speculation whether French would be signing to the label.[19]\n\n2011–12: Shot Caller and New York takeover[]\n\nWith French juggling between Atlanta and New York, his song \"Shot Caller\" off of the Casino Life record would gain traction on New York radio beginning mid-2011. During an on-air interview with Fat Joe on DJ Green Lantern's \"Invasion Radio\" in October 2011, French would call in to praise close friend and fellow-Bronx rapper Fat Joe, revealing his role in helping to get \"Shot Caller\" on the airwaves.[43] Fat Joe, whom he refers to as \"big brother\", praised French's work ethic and revealed that French had been receiving offers from several major labels.[43]\n\nJim Jones bottle-throwing incident[]\n\nOn the night of August 5, 2011, Bronx-based rapper Fat Joe was slated to host Funkmaster Flex's birthday party at Webster Hall. During his performance, Fat Joe brought out French Montana to perform on stage. Controversy erupted as Jim Jones and his entourage, who were reportedly on the adjacent balcony seats, began hurling bottles and glass at the performers.[44][45] The following day, videos of the incident were uploaded online, depicting French and his entourage facing a barrage of glass and liquor on stage, as they continued performing his rendition of \"Hard In Da Paint\" while facing the mentioned balcony with the crowd chanting along to it.[46][47] Some of the members on stage hurled debris back towards the balcony, as Jones and his entourage eventually exited the premises.[46]\n\nCollaborating with Diddy[]\n\nFat Joe and Waka Flocka accompanied French Montana in his video shoot for \"Shot Caller\" later that month in August. The song, which made reference to Diddy's 1997 hit \"Its All About The Benjamins\", would soon garner the interest of the Bad Boy mogul. On October 9, French announced Diddy and T.I. for the official remix to the song.[48] DJ Drama, who called it his favorite record, referred T.I. to jump on the remix.[48] Although the T.I. feature never came to fruition, the remix was released on November 24, and featured rappers Diddy and Rick Ross.\n\nWith \"Shot Caller\" already one of the most played tracks on New York radio, on stations such as Hot 97 and Power 105,[48] French was slated to appear on the upcoming episode of BET's 106 & Park on December 6,[26][49] where he would be debuting the music video and announcing the label he's signing with.

Notable for its memorable French and Ross \"hook\", the track became one of the biggest hits that year, oft-talked about for its Drake verse believed to be a \"diss\" towards rapper Common at the time. French Montana was featured on XXL's Freshman Class of 2012 alongside Future, Kid Ink, Danny Brown, Macklemore, Don Trip, Hopsin, Iggy Azalea, Roscoe Dash, and Bad Boy labelmate MGK.[54][55] French later revealed to host Sway Calloway on MTV's RapFix Live in August 2012 that he almost turned down the cover opportunity feeling he deserved it a year or two prior.[7]\n\nFrench's first single from the upcoming album, \"Pop That\" was released on June 15, featuring Ross, Drake and Lil Wayne.
