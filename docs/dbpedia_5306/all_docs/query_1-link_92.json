        "text": "Whether it be via interviews or just via him dropping fire music, we’ve been seeing a decent amount of Wiz Khalifa this summer. But nobody is complaining. Wiz kicked off the week by liberating “Isaac Hayes,” (the lead single from the Taylor Gang Vol. 1 mixtape.) He’s now rounding off the week with the breezy new single “Bad Influence” which is taken from his forthcoming solo project.\n\nPittsburgh beatmaker, Sledgren, provides the woozy instrumental which is flecked with crisp hi-hats and spacey chimes, while Wiz takes us on a haze-fuelled journey. Cruising around town, the Taylor Gang chief is searching for a bad chick to do bad things with. Of course, this is Wiz, and as far as rap misogynists go, he’s pretty far down on the scale. He isn’t out to smash and pass, he trying to puff-puff-pass and elevate at the same time. This is a stoner’s tale of a hopelessly romantic future… but only if she’s bad enough!\n\nWe can expect a lot more music from Wiz’s camp in the coming weeks as Taylor Gang Vol. 1 is well underway.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nListen to Wiz Khalifa, Chevy Woods, & Tuki Carter’s New Song “Isaac Hayes”\n\nWiz Khalifa Updates Fans on Upcoming Album\n\nRelated\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from New Music\n\nEditor Picks"
