        "text": "On the Verge: Ty Dolla $ign carries a hip-hop tune\n\nNot a rapper: Ty Dolla $ign is many things — a hip-hop artist, a singer/songwriter, a producer — but don't call him a rapper. \"Rappers to me are, like, Wiz (Khalifa), people who can really rap,\" says the singer (born Tyrone Griffin Jr.). \"I do melody and everything, but people say it's rap because of my lyrics and because I'm really hardcore.\"\n\n'Toot'-ing his own horn: The Los Angeles native initially broke out guesting on YG's Toot It and Boot It (which peaked at No. 67 on Billboard's Hot 100 in 2010). It was then he realized he could make a viable career for himself as a solo artist. \"I was always making beats and songs, but after that, I was like, 'This could really happen,' and I believed in it more,\" says Griffin, who turns 29 today. Since then, the singer has written for Chris Brown (Loyal) and Trey Songz (Ordinary), and scored a hit single of his own with the B.o.B-assisted Paranoid, which has gone to No. 6 on USA TODAY's urban airplay chart and sold 498,000 downloads. Signed to Atlantic Records, Ty Dolla $ign recently performed on The Tonight Show and kicks off his first headlining tour April 29 in Fresno.\n\nWiz the mentor: Griffin met Wiz in 2009, but they didn't become friends until a couple years later, when Wiz hit him up on Twitter saying they should work together. Wiz has since guested on Ty Dolla $ign's Or Nah with DJ Mustard (off his Beach House EP, released in January), and Griffin joined Wiz on tour last summer. \"He put me in front of a lot of people,\" Griffin says. \"It was different going from clubs on the West Coast to doing 20,000 people every night in every state. It was definitely a blessing. I learned a lot from it.\"\n\nMarijuana advocate: Although he may not consider himself a rapper, Griffin shares Wiz's love for marijuana. \"Weed is a good thing. I'm glad they're legalizing it — it should be legal everywhere,\" says Griffin, extolling pot for its ability to\"bring people together ... It's never going to start fights like alcohol does.\"\n\nAll about the ladies: Paranoid was inspired by an experience Griffin had when he went to supperclub​ in L.A. with a girlfriend and another of his girlfriends came up to them. \"She wasn't hating, but I knew she wanted to let (her presence) be known,\" Griffin says. After five minutes, a third girlfriend approached them. \"I really didn't know they knew about each other, but after that I did.\" He wrote the song the next day.\n\nMusic with meaning: Debut album Free TC, expected out later this year, is dedicated to his younger brother, whom Griffin says is wrongfully incarcerated. \"I'm sure there's people like that in every 'hood and I want to raise awareness for people (facing) injustice.\" Aside from the music's greater purpose, expect guest spots from Kendrick Lamar, YG and Jhené Aiko. \"It's going to be big,\" he says."
