        "text": "Wiz Khalifa and Amber Rose were married for one year, from 2013 through 2014. They both have joint custody of their son and amicably co-parent. Rose spoke about the dynamic during an interview with Us Weekly in 2017. “We both love our son, so it just comes easy. We don’t live that far away from each other, so anytime Sebastian wants to come back here or go with his dad [he can],” Rose said at the time. “We FaceTime each other a lot. Whether he’s over there or he’s over here with me, you know, we always have FaceTime to talk to the baby. So we talk to him every day regardless of where he is. It’s just easy. It makes it really easy.”\n\nAs for music, Wiz Khalifa announced that he'll be embarking on a co-headlining tour with Snoop Dogg titled the High School Reunion Tour, earlier this week. The announcement came after the two reunited on their new collaboration “Don’t Text, Don’t Call.\" They'll be bringing Warren G, Too $hort, and Berner with special guest DJ Drama along for the ride. The tour is scheduled to kick off in July. Khalifa will also be traveling on The Good Trip Tour this year with Joey Bada$$, Smoke DZA, Berner, and Chevy Woods. Those shows will begin next month."
