        "text": "DJ Khaled released his ninth studio album earlier this year to much fanfare. In the run up to the album’s release, Khaled became a Snap Chat sensation, something that nonetheless helped promote the project in an era of declining album sales. Indeed, Khaled’s manufactured celebrity through popular social media did pay dividends, scoring his first number one album in the Billboard 200 Chart.\n\nAlong with most Khaled albums, there’s meant to be a unifying theme. Previous examples include the rather hilariously titled ‘Suffering From Success’ of 2013 and his last album ‘I Changed, A Lot’ of 2015. These titles provide a thematic vessel for the contributing artists to craft the songs around. This time round, the particular theme is centred on major keys -a term popularised on Khaled’s Snapchat – which constitute choice pearls of wisdom coined by the man himself to help people succeed.\n\nTrack by track review\n\nThe first tracks I listened to on the project were ‘Fuck Up the Club’ and ‘Pick These Hoes Apart’. According to Pitchfork, these are the weakest tracks on ‘Major Key’, disparaged by their writer ‘Kris ex’ as “pitched directly at the ignorant, misogynist, and unwoke.” To a degree that’s a correct analysis. Kodak Black’s verse is adolescent and jarring… he is only 19 years old, but his lyrics are incredibly vulgar and disgusting. For me as a listener, they served as ‘gateway drugs’ for the admittedly better cuts on the album. That said, the trap heavy beats are booming, especially on ‘Fuck Up the Club’ which serves well as a club anthem. However, there a few ‘major keys’ to be grafted from the messages of these songs. Nowhere can they be found on ‘Fuck Up the Club’, and on ‘Pick These Hoes Apart’ Jeezy advises the listener to ‘love em with your mind and never with your heart.’\n\nNow let’s examine the project in (rough) chronological order. Listeners are pummelled straight away with pre release singles ‘I Got the Keys’ featuring Future and Jay Z and ‘For Free’ a solo effort from Drake. I’m not a big fan of Jigga, but he comes with a solid verse. Add to that a haywire beat from 808 Mafia and an addictive hook from Future, we have an altogether enjoyable opening song. ‘For Free’ is your standard Drake single offering, this time with an intriguing flip on paid-for-sex, bragging about his impressive bedroom performances and how he feels he should deserve payment for the service.\n\nTrack 3 is delvired by Nas, titled ‘Nas Album Done’. On the first verse, he encourages African Americans to support each other and grow their communities in the face of adversity such as institutionalised poverty and unconstructive individualism. In the second verse, he compels his Black sisters to fix up and be smart. These are bridged by an awesome hook ‘My signature fade with the Bevel blade/That’s a major key/I told her she smart and loyal, I like that/That’s a major key/Start a label, run it, sign yourself/That’s a major key/What Tony had on the table/It’s like us, we a major key’. This is a short and sweet delivery from Nas here.\n\nThere are ‘major keys’ a plenty on the early tracks, most thoroughly realised on ‘Holy Key’ featuring Big Sean and Kendrick Lamar. Som might disparage the combo between these two artists after the ‘Control’ verse controversy, where it is widely regarded that Kendrick Lamar upstaged Sean on his own track. Prolific commentator Anthony Fantano has said something to this effect. However, I think this particular pairing is actually inspired. They are two great rappers. Big Sean bounces off a number of themes in his verse, such as hard work, positivity, health, his Christian faith, and the grim instances of police brutality sweeping America all in one outstanding package. Kendrick matches this with moralising on rotten materialism (Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust/Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust), his trials rebuilding the hood and the struggles both him and his people continue to deal with. The verses are weaved together with a passionate chorus from Betty Wright.\n\n‘Jermaine’s Interlude’ continues the hot, intellectual streak of the album. He comes with some deep, soulful introspection. The struggle is real in this song, as J Cole observes:\n\n“I can see the future that we’re heading\n\nI would say it’s better not to tell\n\nIf it’s anything like this in Heaven\n\nMaybe I’d be better off in hell”\n\nHe exhibits his skill as an artist, getting very personal about the issues he is facing, from marjuiana dependence to police brutality. Cole is attended by an old skool beat in a overall welcome divergence from the project as a whole.\n\nNext up is a combo of Future and RnB artist Bryson Tiller. On repeated listens, this has become one of my favourite tracks on the project. Future’s verse is hot, and Bryson Tiller puts in a good show for someone who hasn’t rapped all that much. Finishing with a rather hilarious outro from Khaled, this track is very strong indeed. After that is ‘Do You Mind’… the less said about this track the better. It’s ok for a poppy RnB single, but I always skip it, as the deplorable Chris Brown features. Penultimate song ‘Forgive Me Father’ is also dead cert for a skip from me: the beat is pretty shit and singer Meghaine Trainor seems a little out of place.\n\nIgnoring those, which could have been cut from the album for all I care, huge rap tracks ‘Work For It’ and ‘Don’t Ever Play Yourself’ follow. ‘Work For It’ containing great verses from Big Sean with thuggery from Gucci Mane and comical ridiculousness from 2 Chainz thrown into the mix. ‘Don’t Ever Play Yourself’ has a heavy New Yorker slant, with excellent verses from Jadakis -who lays down a brooding gangsta verse brimming with braggadocio- Fabolous -who exhibits calm confidence on the beat- and finally Ken Jones (of hit single ‘Dont Mind‘ fame)-who snaps on this track. Squeezed in the middle are features from New York king Busta Rhymes and an intolerable, painful verse from Fat Joe (why did he need to be on here, WHY?).\n\nTrack 12 is ‘Tourist’, driven by Travis Scott and recieving a guest verse from Lil Wayne. It’s a decent pairing of these two artists: with Travis delivering his predictably wavey fare, both lyrically and in the production. Wayne matches this with some trippiness of his own, bringing a good deal of faded delivery to proceedings. He sounds a little like Young Thug on this track, which is admittedly perverse considering Thugger (now called ‘Jeffrey’) takes his cues from Wayne, not the other way round. Anyway, it has a unique aesthetic -thanks to Scott’s production- which is welcome here. Ending proceedings is Jamaican artist Mavado on ‘Progress’, finishing the album with some distinctly Caribean vibes.\n\nAnalysis\n\nSuch an in-depth review of Khaled’s album would be incomplete without an analysis of Khaled’s own role in the production process.\n\nIn their own review, the guys over at Hot New Hip Hop (HNHH) argue that the album is made up off leftovers and hand me downs from the works of the featuring artists rather than original material. The cite Drake song ‘For Free’ and ‘Jermaine’s Interlude’ in particular as examples. If HNHH’s reporting is accurate, the tracks obscure it very well. There are some incredible verses on here and some inspired artist combinations which come together to create some of the best verses we’ll hear this year.\n\nIndeed, maybe cobbling together the scraps from other artists’ work and turning it into a success is all part of ‘Khaled’s magic’? In this way, Khaled might be some type of musical magician, using his unique wizadry by taking other artist’s hand me down verses and crafting compelling anthems from them? If so, he’s played this game very well, albiet with the help of a supporting cast of producers; Southside, Cool & Dre, Ben Billions and Metro Boomin’ are but a few of these contributors.\n\nI have my own theory of how Khaled weaved this album together. I believe he leveraged his position as the Opening Act of Beyonce’s Formation Tour to make the album ‘on-the-go’ while he was travelling hither and yon across the States earlier this year. Khaled has a fear of flights, therefore it would seem that much of the album was done on the road. Particularly, it might be that Khaled recieved a lot of his verses from the Formation Tour’s New York show at the Citi Field Stadium on the 7th and 8th of June. This supercut video shows YG, Fabolous, Kent Jones and Jadakis all coming on stage at that concert as part of Khaled’s opening DJ set. I can’t help but draw the conclusion that these artists either laid down their verses to Khaled on those days, or at least expressed a commitment to being on his album. While I don’t fuck with Beyonce, you’ve got to give her credit for taking a load of rappers along with her for her massive stadium tour.\n\nKhaled has a great ability to craft anthems. I believe Khaled’s role is to bring people together using his charisma and magnetic personality to make a ‘Now That’s What I Call Music!’ style album made up of entirely original tracks. Each Khaled project has a ‘This Year in Hip Hop’ aesthetic too it. Such a strategy brings together the best and most distinctive rappers in the game, as well as whoever is popping at the moment. Scott Glaysher at Hip Hop DX writes something to this effect in his own review. To Khaled’s credit as a curator, no artist dominates proceedings: Future and Big Sean are in more than one track, but that’s about it.\n\nThere are two classes of artists here. The first category consists of genuinely great rappers such as Kendrick, Big Sean and Nas. The second is made up of rappers who are there for their distinctive voices and personas, who deliver features of varying qaulity to the project. The pairing of Travis Scott and Lil Wayne on ‘Tourist’ delivers a very sound result. Also at the top end of this second category are Jadakis and Fabulous, who both deliver an incredible verses on ‘Don’t Ever Play Yourself’. Future and and Rick Ross also shine for their slots on this project. Other rappers offer fair to middling performances on ‘Major Key.’ Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and Busta Rhymes. At the bottom of this class are Fat Joe, Kodak Black and Yo Gotti.\n\nSo what are the negatives of this album? There are some lame verses among the greatness. I get the sense that the likes of Fat Joe, Yo Gotti and French Montana appear on the album because they are friends of DJ Khaled rather than for their skill at rapping. As for Kodak Black, he’s a native of Florida, Khaled’s home state. Because he happens to be on the come-up with tracks such as ‘No Flokin’ and ‘Vibin in this Bih’ making waves on the streaming services, it can be understood why he made a feature on here… But still, there’s no escaping the fact that “When she walked in I was standin’ by the bar/Soon I saw you girl my dick was standin’ hard/She so wet I make that pussy fart/Pussy good, I just might buy you a new car” is a bad, cringeworthy set of lyrics.\n\nOther than that, some of the tracks could’ve done with some tweaking. Future’s verse on ‘Imma Be Alright’ has hints of poetic genius, and it would’ve been nice to hear more from him on this song. Also, closing the song ‘Progress’ by Mavado (a frequent collaborator with DJ Khaled, the Jamaican artist also appeared alongside Snoop Lion on ‘Lighters Up’) could have had more loops of this almost addictive hook:\n\n“Wi nuh inna nutten wid you, if you naa show no progress\n\nMan fi go through life without no stress\n\nBe friends wid some people that’s hopeless\n\nCause dem a nuh nuh progress”\n\nIn short, this didn’t feel like the track we were teased for months on Khaled’s Snapchat. The final product of this song just leaves me feeling a bit short changed. It would have been better if those lines were repeated more in my view. Basically, some of the sub par verses and tracks could’ve been cut, like ‘Forgive Me Father’, which just sounds a bit misplaced, and the by the numbers RnB track ‘Do You Mind’… It’s passable I guess, but it doesn’t step to the better tracks on the project.\n\nVerdict:\n\nImpeccably marketed, we might have been right to be sceptical that DJ Khaled could deliver an album which matched the frenzied hype whipped up for the project on his Snapchat account. While there are flaws to this album, namely questionable verses and two or three skippable tracks, Khaled and the big names he has enlisted for the project have pulled it off in gripping style. Despite the lack of unifying theme, and verses that mostly constitute empty boasts rather than anything resonating on a deeper level, it really doesn’t matter. The high points of this album are incredibly so. Ultimately, these are some of the best verses and bangin’ hooks US Hip Hop will produce this year, all in one altogether enjoyable listening experience.\n\nRating 7/10\n\nNoisey has recently done a documentary series on Compton at the behest of Snoop Dogg, who recommends the media outlet go to the area referred to as ‘Bompton’, to do a feature on the variety of rappers coming out of Blood territory. Such a series is long overdue after the resounding success of Noisey Atlanta.\n\nPart 1 sets the narrative tone for the series. It is explained that ‘Bompton’ is experience a musical moment due to the success and prime relevance of Kendrick Lamar, who’s from the area. Mr Lamar is the chief interviewee. He and host Zach Goldbaum chat in what looks like a typical backyard in Compton. Lamar says he wants to talk about the reasons, the problems and solutions behind the severe issues that continue to effect the area, rather than simply rapping about what happens. He refuses to accept the gang lifestyle that a variety of factors push many young men in Compton towards.\n\nZach first goes to Centennial High Schol where Kendrick and Dr Dre went to school. The principal Madie Adams Robertson tells Zach the schools mission: to unlock the potential and the gifts of students. She goes on to say the American Dream is very much alive in Compton. While it is one of the most violent areas in the country, I’m inclined to agree with her: most of the people in Compton have a desire to rise the social ladder, but structural and instituinionalised prejudice holds them back. I hope figures such as Kendrick can bring a message of unity and community solidarity to Compton, causing investors to see the area in a new light, as a place for opportunity. However, the area is still mired in a combative gang identity, despair and drug addiction which makes ascending from such adversity very difficult.\n\nZach also talks to Adrienne Thomas, who teaches English at the school. She highlights the real struggle that their students face: many of their parents in jail or on drugs. In her time, she’s seen three students killed, which demonstrates the extreme volatility of the area. After that, it is revealed that K Dot is giving money to the High School, but adhering to biblical principle Matthew 6:1-6 he is modest about his charity, and is shocked when Zach brings it up.\n\nZach then speaks to Dr Jorja Leap who explains what the problems of Compton are. She said: “What is here is a vibrant, marginalised, troubled, interesting community… Well poverty is the great marginalisor, lets begin with that. These areas have always been lower income, under resourced poor areas. Gangs are still here. Under performing schools are here. School dropout here. Guns are here, drugs are here, violence is here and the wounds of incarceration are here.”\n\nLil L, a friend of Kendrick Lamar, is introduced. He along with Kendrick is one of the main interviewees of the series. He speaks of the deep sadness he feels on the deaths of his -and Kendrick’s- homies S Braze, Chad Keaton and Pupp, all of whom were killed one summer, and all are mentioned on YG Feat Kendrick Lamar ‘Really Be (Smokin’ n Drinkin). Indeed, this track is the theme tune for the whole series, which is a great choice, as it really underpins the mentality that people are forced into. Because the area is so dangerous, people can never be caught slipping, or they’ll get killed by their rivals. Therefore many people have to resort to ‘self medication’ -the excessive consumption of weed, alcohol and other drugs- just to ease the emotional stress they live under.\n\nPart 2 is dedicated to the fledgling career of Lil L, who wants to follow in K Dot’s footsteps and make success through music. Lil L is youthful, but he already has a son and daughter, and wants to make it for them. There is a cut to a music video featuring Young Ocho, Hitta J3 and Lil L called ‘Westside Bompton’ which uses DJ Mustard’s beat for YG’s track ‘Bompton.’\n\nHe then takes Zach to his grandmothers house. She has a picture of Snoop Dogg ans 2 Pac on the wall . The journalist then explains how blacks were segregated in the 20th century by housing covenants that forced them to live south of LA, in effect creating racially segregated neighbourhoods. This division is in some way comparable to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the poor and opressed Palestinians are shut off from the prosperous state of Israel. I digress. The history of African American gangs in LA is expanded on further by Stacey Peralta’s masterful 2008 documentary ‘Crips and Bloods: Made in America’, which I would encourage everyone to watch, as it explains in full the problems areas like Compton continue to face, and how these issues are rooted in history. Zach, Lil L and his grandmother say grace over a tradition southern meal, and talk about the 1965 Watts Riots and the 1992 Rodney King Riots, which both sparked from instances of police brutality (the inspiration for the track ‘The Day The Niggaz Took Over’).\n\nThen Lil L takes Zach to a recording studio, where producer Larry Jayy is laying down an awesome modern G Funk beat (check out his soundcloud here). This type of beat perpetuates the unique sound of Compton and its great that the sound is being carried forward by younger generations. Weed and lean is passed around and another artist, Earl Swavey who spits some solid bars, with a typically gangsta subject matter.\n\nIn part 3, the host of the series goes to a radio station where Bompton rappers Kalifornia King Special and Hitta J3 are giving an interview. Both appear on the front cover of TPAB. The station is hosted by a young rapper and his mother. Despite his age, this guy has a good talent for presenting and is clearly passionate about his work. Snoop Dogg calls to give his wishes to the group of rappers in the studio. After the interview, Kalifornia King Special takes the host to see some of the prostitutes he pimps for. They explain that prostitution offers people a high cash flow in a neighbourhood that is severely deprived of economic opportunity for men and women.\n\nThat said, it doesn’t stop Hitta J3 riding in a Jag. He takes the team to his neighbourhood, where he and his mother tell the harrowing story of how he was shot at aged 14 in a driveby shooting. This highlights how anyone can be a victim of the violence in Compton. Hitta J3’s hit ‘Do Yo Gudda’ is mentioned, but only Kendrick’s feature is credited, Problem and YG also hop on the remix (listen here). While the documentary states Hitta J3 was locked up after the interview, the rapper himself commented on the video saying he’s a free man.\n\nPart 4 highlights how faith plays a role in the lives of people in Compton. In a quick interview, Kendrick Lamar tells us how he was ‘saved’ and became a Christian. It’s a powerful story, one which you can also hear on his ‘Good KID MAAD City’ ending song ‘Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst.’ Zach goes to the Greater Zion Church Family in Compton to assess what they are doing to try and give the city solidarity.\n\nThe church is headed by charismatic Pastor Michael Fisher, who both respects artistic ability but challenges the gangsta rap that perpetuates violence. He said: “In terms of the lyrical content, I think they can be wiser in what they are saying.” This is where Kendrick Lamar comes in, who is at the pinnacle of the rap world and in TPAB has decided to use his platform for good, telling the story of how he wrestled evil and became good, and on the way came to the realisation that black-on-black violence must end. Also, pastor Fisher talks of the heart breaking funerals he has to conduct on a regular basis, which brings to mind the track ‘6 Feet Deep‘ by the Geto Boys.\n\nThe Noisey crew then meets up with G Weed, a Campanella Park Piru, who lives on the border with a rival Crip set. The gang takes lots of drugs: again, not to ‘turn up’, but to bury depressive thoughts that set in in such a ghettoised area. G Weed speaks of the deep divides in the community, his gang tattoos, and the day he and his homies decided they would ‘get strapped’ to protect themselves at age 11.\n\nIn Part 5, the notion of the American Dream in Compton is expanded on. Dr Jorja Leap, who works with the gangs, states that people from Compton hope for the same things as those all over the US: to own their own home, give their kids a good education and ascend the social ladder. Lil L recites these dreams, and expresses his desire to leave the ghetto and escape gang activity.\n\nLil L then takes Zach to Trap Kitchen, a soulfood kitchen that used to be a drug house. Trap Kitchen has catered for rappers such as Fredo Santana, Tyga and Chief Keef. Founded by a Blood and a Crip to keep them focused on something less violent and profitable. Lil ft Boogie and Hop Out ‘Go Brazy’ the credit song on all the vids.\n\nThen Kendrick elaborates on the physical and mental stress of living in the ghetto and being imprisoned. That is why so many desire to leave, to produce a better life for their kids. The episode ends with a presumed stand off between the Campanella Park Piru’s and what seems to be another gang. I just hope it didn’t turn into a drive-by situation that we’ve seen in ‘Menace 2 Society’ and the video for ‘Bicken Back Being Bool‘.\n\nThe last part begins with clips from Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Alright’ which has become an anthem for the ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement. He elaborates on the desire for people in the ghetto to leave the gang lifestyle and make an honest living, much like the guys from the Trap Kitchen who’ve turned away from the gangsta life.\n\nZach revisits Larry Jayy, who runs a barber shop and a recording studio where he makes his beats. He gets visibly emotional when talking about his desire to make it to a safer area. The violent attitude of gang members clearly effects him, and you have to admire his work ethic.\n\nAnother part of the interview with Pastor Michael Fisher is shown, as he explains Kendrick Lamar’s impact. He said: “Kendrick Lamar is about consciencousness, for the most part he tries his best to force this generation to use their mind again and to use their words to raise their level of consciousness.”\n\nNoisey Bompton concludes with some final words from K Dot, and a scene of him bringing Lil L out on stage at a live performance (with a full TDE band in toe).\n\nSummary\n\nThis is a great little series with a few flaws. I found the series thoroughly enjoyable, and felt an emotional connection to the characters in the series. It’s clear Bompton is a hub of culture in which incredible rap music is made.Yet the reasons for the violence are not neccesarily explained, which is something an audience might want to know. The message ‘Compton is a dangerous area’ is one that we hear loud and clear in this documentary, but this is not neccesarily a revelation to anyone who listens to the music coming out of there. Indeed, the structural problems that cause violence are glossed over, and probably require more in depth interviews with those who engage in gang violence. However, maybe Noisey can be forgiven for this, after all, they are doing a series on music, not criminal gangs as such.\n\nThere is a glaring lack of other high profile Bompton rappers. Indeed, it’s a bit of a travesty that YG wasn’t in this series, as he projects both an unapologetic gangsta image and unashamedly put usage of the phrase ‘Bompton’ on the map. He’s also responsible for making Bompton themed red clothing popular. If the producers of the documentary did reach out to him and he said no or didn’t respond, Zach could have at least mentioned that at some point. Furthermore other Compton residents like Tyga, hit producer DJ Mustard and Slim 400 are not covered. They even use stock clips of Slim 400 for overlays! The series also lacks OG perspectives from DJ Quik, the members of NWA, The Game and others.\n\nAlso, while the producers did well to keep to a specific area, I can’t help but feeling they could’ve branched out to cover rappers from across LA. In episode 1, Zach conducts an interview with Dr Jorja Leaf at Watts Towers. That means he could’ve interviewed Jay Rock, who lives in Watts. Jay Rock is a Bounty Hunter Blood on TDE, the same label as K Dot. It would’ve been interesting to get his perspective of things on here, even though Watts is not in Compton. Schoolboy Q is also on the same label and represents Hoover Crips. It would’ve also been interesting to see some of the rappers on the Pushaz Ink record label such as TeeCee4800 who’s from the Schoolyard Crips. In terms of the wider West Coast area, there is a slew of other big rappers including Nipsey Hussle, Vince Staples, Dom Kennedy and Clyde Carson.\n\nThis series focused too much on Kendrick Lamar. He fits the overall narrative of the show, which was to highlight what type of area Bompton is and how Kendrick’s message is trying to make a difference, but I feel like the constant praise of him in sections of the media is getting deafening. Bompton contains a whole range of talent that might be overlooked because Kendrick is in the spotlight so much. We can but hope that is influence will help bring peace to the area.\n\nPersonally, I think its realy unfortunate that Compton or Bompton remains divided. These are people with good hearts in a bad situation of ghettoisation, deliberately imposed on them years ago by the racially divisive property statues. The decline of the area caused gangsterism and illegal activity to grip the area. Further, the invent of crack in the 80s served to further trap people in despair and convince gangstas to sell drugs for profit, despite the damage they cause (this theme is compellingly addressed in Tyler, the Creator’s ’48’).\n\nIn the wake of this long history of ghettoisation and violence, its vital to promote unity and intercommunal solidarity in the area to bring peace, and an outright rejection of gang activity. I notice it can be incredibly hard for people to forgive a fellow person who murders their family members and/or best friends, but its possibly the only way the community can find peace.\n\nIt’s clear the people in Bompton have a strong motivation to succeed. The positive spirit of people like Lil L, Larry Jayy and Pastor Michael Fisher display, even in the face of such daily horrors is truely inspirational. A marriage of peace between all gangs, and the investment that Dr Jorja Leaf proposes, could transform Compton.\n\nWith all that said, its great that Bompton is getting coverage, and I thoroughly enjoyed this short series. It’s just a shame it didn’t go on longer.\n\nRelated posts on Natty Jahms Music:\n\nThink Piece: The Dominance of Atlanta\n\nTrack Review: ‘Do Yo Gudda Remix’\n\nhttps://nattyjahmsmusic.wordpress.com/tag/to-pimp-a-butterfly/\n\nThink Piece: YG ‘My Krazy Life’\n\nKendrick Lamar, one of the most highly regarded artists in the world, followed up his instant classic 2013 album ‘Good Kid Mad City’ this year, with ‘To Pimp a Butterfly’, released on the 15th March 2015, to a fanfair of critical acclaim from the reviewing community.\n\nIn my view, this is an incredibly spiritual album. Kendrick is not giving us Christian rap by any stretch, but the album is conceptualised within the Christian belief system: God exists, as well as the devil, both of which work within the world to either guide or destroy.\n\nOn the side of evil is Satan (of course), called ‘Lucy’ throughout the album -short for Lucifer for the slow ones out there. This modernisation of one of Satan’s many names is a good move; It’s clear Kendrick didn’t want to make things too literal and obvious, thus making Kendrick’s story distinctive and personal.\n\nThe destructive force of the devil takes on several real and conceptual guises, such as the KKK, racist police… but the most overt of these is Uncle Sam, the salesman of poisoned and corrupt goods, built to lead man astray. Uncle Sam is addressed throughout the album, most notably in ‘Wesley’s Theory’ and ‘For Sale’.\n\n‘Wesley’s Theory’ is the first song on the album. In the first verse, K Dot expressed his enthusiasm with getting into a relationship with ‘conventional Hip Hop’, and expresses his intentions to get rich, as so many other rappers do. Things take a turn in the hook, when we learn that the metaphorical relationship hasn’t worked, expressed in this touching way:\n\n‘At first, I did love you/But now I just wanna fuck/Late nights thinkin’ of you/Until I get my nut/Tossed and turned, lesson learned/You was my first girlfriend/Bridges burned, all across the board/Destroyed, but what for?’\n\nHis message here is that being a stereotypical rapper and black entertainer is just not for him. The fruits of success can sour, and in the end all Kendrick wants to do now is ‘fuck.’ This complexity expands in the second verse, where Kendrick takes on the first of multiple narrative roles he adopts in the album. This first character is Uncle Sam who argues with Kendrick, while dangling the usual trinkets of rap in his face again:\n\n‘What you want? You a house or a car?/Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?/Anythin’, see, my name is Uncle Sam, I’m your dog/Motherfucker, you can live at the mall/I know your kind (That’s why I’m kind)/Don’t have receipts (Oh, man, that’s fine)/Pay me later, wear those gators/Cliché, then say, “Fuck your haters”’\n\nThis is Uncle Sam’s attempt to pimp his new ‘slave’ Kendrick, and will then take all his wealth “Wesley snipe your ass before your 25”. Uncle Sam’s game plan is to hijack the success of this young black man, get rich off him and then toss Kendrick away when he’s done.\n\nAlready as an audience we can see that Kendrick’s lyrics are complex and hard to unpack. This aint ‘easy listening’, this is thought provoking in the utmost sense, something very rarely experienced when listening to mass exposure artists. Kendrick’s flow is often difficult to latch onto, almost forcing the listener to check the lyrics on Rap Genius to discover their meaning: however, through this process, a deeper appreciation of the lyrics emerges.\n\nThe beat is produced by Flippa, Flying Lotus, Sounwave and Thundercat, a pool of musicians Kendrick uses throughout the album. It’s a weird sound to open with, and can be disorientating for those who strive for an easy-going beat. But after a few listens, the vibe of this song has grown on me. About 2/3rds of the way through, the track is broken up by a skit: nothing less than the intervention of Dr Dre, the first big moment of the album. The godfather doesn’t chuck his voice around on tracks, and this diversion doubtless serves to show that Kendrick and Dr Dre are still very much friends.\n\n‘For Free’, track 2, is delivered in the form of monologue of a hypothetical side bitch who is dismissive of Kendrick because he isn’t bringing in the dollars and spending money on her. This character is a cold hearted American woman. She sums her opinion of Kendrick up perfectly: “I need a baller ass, boss ass nigga.” Kendrick retorts “this dick aint free” controversialy flipping the script, claiming value for himself and demanding his feelings should be taking into account. He snaps on her, unleashing all the shit on his mind.\n\nBut with the following words, he again reverts to a deeper, metaphorical narrative: “Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton that made you rich now my dick ain’t free”. This line shows that Kendrick is presenting himself as the African American, while the woman here is presented as the corrupted America that he lives in. Therefore, his tirade is actually a power statement: he won’t let this chick (who symbolises America) boss him about anymore. He’s had enough and his dick aint free. This whole compelling conversation is overlayed by bombastic jazz music.\n\nThe single ‘King Kunta’ exhibits K Dot at his more competitive on the album. It might be radio-worthy, as it has a jazzy, groovy vibe and popular vintage bass line. Indeed, ‘King Kunta’ has a great pulse and brilliant live performance potential. This track conforms the most to sterotypical Hip Hop. His lyrics are poignant given the Drake vs Meek Mill beef. K Dot ‘swore he wouldn’t tell’ on the issue of ghost writers, but reveals some of the ‘truth’ without targeting anyone in particular. His use of two men cell is intentional and darkly humourous, considering many African Americans find themselves in jail:\n\n‘I can dig rappin’/But a rapper with a ghost writer?/What the fuck happened?(Oh no!)/I swore I wouldn’t tell/But most of y’all sharing bars/Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell!’\n\n‘I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves/Everybody’s suicidal, they ain’t even need my help’\n\nHere he exhibits his fighting spirit he expressed so well on ‘Control’. Indeed, his verse on that track was one of the biggest moments of his career in the intervening period between ‘Good Kid Maad City’ and the content of To Pimp a Butterfly. On King Kunta, there are barbed lyrics here and there that shed light on Kendricks more competative mindset.\n\n‘Institutionalized’ has blissful backing music + inkeeping with unapologetically avant-garde thrust of the instrumentation. Moreover, this track is pure odd, and does not really connect. The Most distinctive part is the comical but thought-provoking hook, which might be one of the possible redeeming features to this lacklustre offering: ‘Shit don’t change til you get up and wash your ass nigga.’ Even a rather hoarse sounding Snoop Dogg fails to inject energy in this one. There’s not much to get excited about here and the track could’ve been scrapped from the album without much protest.\n\n‘These Walls’ is one of the more immediately accessible tracks on the album, as per its simple beat. The music has a distinctive G Funk which will makes it more relatable to those looking for a traditional sound. Oddly enough, this track is about sex, and does not fail to be explicit. It’s certainly not radio friendly content:\n\n‘These walls are vulnerable, exclamation/Interior pink, color coordinated/I interrogated, every nook and cranny/I mean it’s still amazing before they couldn’t stand me/These walls want to cry tears/These walls happier when I’m here/These walls never could hold up/Every time I come around demolition might crush’\n\n‘U’ is Lamar’s personal expression of self-loathing and depression, in part for failing to protect his homies from violence. He raps in a very bitter sounding voice; this is a hate filled lecture to himself. In his depths, clanking bottles can be heard. It is a gruesome picture Kendrick paints, and this is the lowest mood the album goes too. The image this track conveys is bleak and horrific, and thus doesn’t have great replay value. Yet, props to K Dot for making something so brutally honest.\n\n‘Alright’, along with ‘King Kunta’ is one of the songs that go down well in a live setting, so much so that it has become the unofficial song of the Black Lives Matter protest movement. After the grim sounding ‘U’, Mr Lamar finds encouragement in faith, proclaiming despite the evil and the horrors he is surrounded in. It has served well as a post release single, with a video accompanying the track uploaded on June 30th (see the vid below). Along with a choice few other tracks on the album could transition well into the live setting. Indeed, it was one of the tracks from TPAB that Kendrick performed at Reading Festival 2015.\n\nThe video mostly contains Kendrick gliding throught the streets of LA on a high, preaching a good message. However this is brought to an abrupt end when a white cop finger guns him down. The thrust couldn’t be clearer, nor the message more relevant, considering the amount of innocent young black men being killed unjustly by cops.\n\n‘For Sale?’ is one of the stranger sounding tracks in an already surreal sounding project. Here, Kendrick and ‘Lucy’ speak. Lucy expresses his desire for Kendrick’s soul, and showers promises on him, like Jesus’ confrontation with the devil in the desert. The music here is almost Tyler The Creator-esque, with lots of surreal elements that contrubite to the overall sound, creating an unsettling atmosphere. The poem runs smoothly into the next track, Momma.\n\nAfter his confrontation with Lucy, Kendrick goes home to his Mum in the song ‘Momma’. He’s running away from evil to the good. The odd globules of bass boom into this more relaxed song. For Kendrick his Mum is a fountain of knowledge he can fall back on and learn from. He draws comforted from her nugget of wisdom, that the fruits of the world are better dished out by God, rather than the poisoned goods of Lucy.\n\n‘Hood Politics’ offers one of the big moments lyrically on the album, where Kendrick shares his thoughts about the state of the African American and the hip hop game at present. A variety of big statements are made here: there is an endorsement of ATL rapper and member of Run the Jewels Killer Mike: ‘Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’/Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike’d be platinum’. Also, he engages in self reference and awareness to the impact of his ‘Control’ verse, which shook up the rap industry. Check some of the best bars on the album below:\n\n‘Streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it’s a new gang in town/From Compton to Congress, set trippin’ all around/Ain’t nothin’ new, but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans/Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’?/They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs/Make it they promise to fuck with you/No condom, they fuck with you,Obama say, “What it do?”‘\n\n‘How Much a Dollar Cost’ is the most morally impactful songs on the album, its clear message signified in the track title. Kendrick’s lyrics are tough to decipher here, and if you have any interest in what he’s trying to say it is definitely worth hitting up this track on rap genius; because once reading and understanding the lyrics this becomes the most compelling song on the album.\n\nThe first verse sets the scene with K Dot’s confrontation with a homeless man on the strees of Johannesberg. He castigates the homeless man as a crack addict and a pan handler in verses 1 and 2, employing the selfish attitude the ‘evil forces’ want him to have. But by verse 3, the moral reprecussions of their argument with are laid out in full: the homeless man is revealed as God. The cost of a dollar is a spot in heaven, and the selfishness Kendrick exhibited in verses 1 and 2 will doom him.\n\nThis is without doubt the most powerful track on the whole project. Indeed, it changed my attitude and my approach to homeless people as a result: when I seem them I think of this track. James Flaunteroy -who has already distinguished himself in my eyes on colabs with Nipsey Hussle and others- offers the vocals to the hook. There is a very blues feel to the beat for this track, which really conveys the epochal nature of this song. It holds a similar position to ‘The Art of Peer Pressure’ on his last album: both tracks are deeply personal, and are narrated brilliantly.\n\n‘Complexion’ acts as quick ode to black skin, invoking the mantra ‘black is beautiful.’ While it doesn’t advance the album thematically that much, the music here is the most relaxing, and perhaps conforms to classic hip hop tropes the most. Further, there is some hot rapping from female artist Rapsody, who, from this track alone, has marked herself out as an accomplished lyricist. Indeed, she has strong voice and some great bars:\n\n‘All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave/12 years of age, thinkin’ my shade too dark/I love myself, I no longer need Cupid/Enforcin’ my dark side like a young George Lucas/Light don’t mean you smart, bein’ dark don’t make you stupid’\n\nShe goes harder than K Dot on this track, and is a welcome addition to the project.\n\nBlacker the Berry, which I’ve already reviewed in isolation, deserves another look. The chorus of the track is portrayed in the eyes of the racist white cop, who is also be manifested in the slave owners and KKK member of old. This faceless evil cop in a sense could be interpreted as a demon who channels the destuctive forces of hatred to kill the opressed. The racist cop, the slave owners, the KKK and Lucy are different versions of one evil entity: each aims to tear down the African American and keep him in his servile role, or in Kendricks words: ‘You hate me don’t you?/You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture’\n\nWhile the phrase ‘the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice’ attributes value to the black man, this is maliciously flipped by the white cop/slave owner/devil figure, who wants to pop the berries -shoot the black people- to see the sweet juic (blood) flow out of them. This is incredibly powerful imagery and representative of the despicable violence this all American white devil wants to commit.\n\nKendrick defiantly addresses the evil which he is confronted. In my mind I see a division between the African Americans who are on the picket lines being led in their chant by Kendrick and Assassin, while the evil mainfested in the racist cop menacingly waits, calmly ready to shoot and kill the protestors.\n\nThis epic, climactic, lofty narrative -that so vividly paints a picture of a protest- is then brought to a disturbing, anti climax of self-doubt. K Dot asks why blacks should be so proud when black-on-black gang violence essentially creates a community in civil war: ‘So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?/Hypocrite!’\n\nThese lines will doubtless engage the African American community in some soul searching.\n\n‘Blacker the Berry’ transitions to the altogether more smoother sounding ‘You Aint Gotta Lie.’ This track deals with the philosophy of being true to yourself. Here, Kendrick almost educates the rest of the game, saying rappers don’t have to lie to fit in with the cool, stereotypical version of a rapper, whose got the ‘hoes’ the ‘money bags’ and the ‘burner stashed’. In the lyrics he educates these people, possibly through the device of his mother. This philosophy is also flipped onto the fans who take an interest on the gangsterism so often used to sell hip hop records. All in all, the track has a valuable message in the title, accompanied with a groovy beat that makes it one of the more accessible songs on the album, one of my favourites in early play-throughs.\n\nOn the penultimate song on the album, Kendrick has an epiphany, a defiant proclamation of positivity: that he loves himself. The almost-religious overtone hits again here, with the popular motto ‘you have to love yourself before you can love others.’ While chronologically at the positive climax of the album, the single was released in September 2014 (see the vid below). This was a good piece of marketing, as it kept people excited and anticipated for the album to come.\n\nThe song itself is huge, and has a big popularity compared with the deeply introspective tracks on the rest of the project. For the album version, fans get a ‘live’ version of the track, with crowd sound effects, as if Mr Lamar is performing this in a West Coast funk club. Most of all, this is a very uplifting song to end the album on a high note. In the spoken word outro, he strongly reappropriates the word ‘nigga’, converting it to the original Ethiopian word ‘negu’, to represent power and unity rather than division and degradation.\n\nThe final track, ‘Mortal Man’, is the culmination of the project. Mr Lamar summarises the poetic stories he weaves into the album into a single piece at the begining of the outro. The message of this poem is one of unity between African Americans, putting aside petty gang affiliations and division. The outro itself is a climatic, juxtaposed discussion between Lamar and 2Pac. Kendrick finishes the album with an explanation of the curious title of the album. I think K Dot is trying to say that the evil forces will try to pimp the ascendent butterfly to keep the rest of his people ‘cocooned’ (oppressed) in the ghetto, which is why Kendrick has to use his powers for good. This view certainly coheres with what is said on the rest of tracks.\n\nThe metaphor of the butterfly symbolises Kendrick now he’s left the hood, but evil forces are out to pimp him and use him to their ends. The entirety of this project is essentially his struggle with fame: he is determined to not be led astray, despite the huge power this corrupting force can exert. By the end of the album, we’ve learnt through commitment to positive morality Mr Lamar has succeeded in his battle with evil and is ready to do good in the world. That’s what I hope he has realised, at least.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThis project is initially unsettling and an assault on the senses. The overwhelming force of praise in the critical community on the albums release gave hip hop fans precious little time to digest and thematically unpack the album. Now at the end of the year, space is afforded to assess the project. For me, this project was hard to settle into, due mostly to the truely surreal instrumentation. I’d say I was amazed as the thought and the incredibly personal story of this album, with all the vivid cultural motifs and the existential struggle between good and evil is the main thing to take away from this. The left-field sonics -while of undoubtable high production quality- are not to my taste. Also, lyrically he’s not the easiest rapper to follow, which requires searching through them in written form to pick up the pieces. That said, this is the most philosophically important music project this year bar none. Although the music itself may grate the ears on a few tracks, the message itself might change how people see the world.\n\nYG’s ‘My Krazy Life’ is my favourite Hip Hop album of 2014. I was hooked to YG when watching my housemate play GTA 5, and his track ‘Im A Real 1‘ blasted from the tv. His bars, memorable hook and Mustard’s simplistic beat drew me in. The second YG tune I heard was ‘My Hitta’ when a friend showed it to me. The track’s deep sound is simple, but heavy hitting. The verses include hood realities, and in essence express the companionship people can have in the type of neighbourhood that YG comes from, but also the countless areas that are similar to it. Coupled with an unforgettable chorus by Rich Homie Quan, it might be one of the defining West Coast tracks of 2014. After listening to more songs via spotify, I finally bought the album during summer.\n\nThe album is fantastic to drive too, due in part to DJ Mustard’s beats, which sound penetrating thanks to car speakers (although my car isn’t the best, just a Peugeot 206). It almost encourages to drive with rapacity, such is the energy of the more single-worthy tracks on the album. ‘Bickin Back Bein’ Bool’ is probably the best song on the album, as YG has the opportunity to shine by himself. It’s a gangsta tune, as the title itself suggests, in purest Blood speech. Two big feature tracks stand out. The third track on the album is ‘I Just Wanna Party’ featuring TDE stablemates Schoolboy Q and Jay Rock. The sentiment of the song takes an immediate menacing tone in the hook: ‘I just wanna party, I don’t wanna hurt nobody/I just wanna party/ I don’t wanna hurt nobody/I just wanna party/ I don’t wanna hurt nobody/But I’ll beat the fuck out of a nigga!’ (source: azlyrics.com). It’s the perfect blend of thug and party sounds from DJ Mustard, along with some gangsta lyrics from all of these LA rappers. The 10th track is ‘Who Do You Love?’ Mustard’s beat goes deep and dark, accompanied by the classic gangsta keys. YG starts, with some boisterous lyrics: ‘The Panamera shittin’ on the 9-11/I call my homies, not 9-11/I’m the nigga with the juice/But I’ll never do my nigga like Pac did Q!’ (source: azlyrics.com). These bars connected in particular. However Drakes collaboration on this track stole the show (there were hints the two artists would link up, represented by Drake’s cameo in the Im A Real 1 video).\n\nTo be honest, I have been waiting for an artist like YG for a very long time. As a big fan of Dr Dre and to a lesser extent NWA, it seems like it has taken quite some time for a solid West Coast Gangsta rapper to come to the fore. While waiting for such an artist, I listened to Tyler, the Creator and Kendrick Lamar. Both artists are incredible in their own ways, and are deserving of endless praise for their creativity. however neither of these quite deliver the wholesome, patriotically West Coast Gangsta feeling that resonates through YG’s music. While Tyler and Kendrick’s music transcend the West Coast into their own unique sounds, YG’s tracks are rooted and grounded in the area he is from. K Dot’s ‘Good Kid Maaad City’ does capture the essence of Compton and who he is, but it isn’t gangsta music. That’s what YG has done: revitalised the West Coast Gangsta rap genre, and as such his music is included in GTA 5. I feel YG received the exposure he needed when ‘Im A Real 1’ got onto the track list for Radio Los Santos.\n\nIn a way, it’s not surprising that ‘My Krazy Life’ was not considered for a grammy last year. The crazily overt language in twerk anthem ‘Left, Right’ exemplifies sex and relationships in the hood; this track is supplemented by the equally raunchy ‘Do It to Ya’ and the more mellow ‘Me and My Bitch.’ Also, there are straight gangsta tunes such as ‘Meet the Flockers’: ‘First, you find a house and scope it out/Find a Chinese neighborhood, cause they don’t believe in bank accounts’ ‘Meet the motherfucking flockers (make money money, make money money)/Make some noise if you’ve ever stole something in your life(take money money, take money money/Don’t be ashamed, it’s okay, baby (make money money, make money money)/Make some noise if you’ve ever stole a dollar out your mama’s purse’ (take money money, take money money)’ (source: lyrics freak.com). There are more sinister tunes, such as ‘1AM’, in which a robbery is carried out, and the nihilistic, self reflective ‘Really Be (Smokin ‘n’ Drinkin)’ with a Kendrick Lamar verse. The fact is that the subject matter of YG’s songs are probably too ratchet for the Grammys, who preferred to consider more mainstream (Iggy Azalea, Wiz Khalifa) or established (Eminem) artists. Therefore YG missed out on a nomination.\n\nWiz Khalifa’s nomination is a particularly interesting case, as Wiz has proved himself to be a mainstream pop rap star, with the ability to get into charts and gain radio plays with tunes such as ‘Black and Yellow‘ (which, lets be honest, deserved a G Mix) ‘Young, Wild and Free‘ and ‘Roll Up‘. Therefore, by Wiz’s release of ‘Blacc Hollywood’ he had already established himself as rapper who could make it in the charts. YG had no such mainstream exposure. That, coupled with unashamedly gangsta subject matter of the songs and the overall narrative is probably why YG was snubbed at the Grammys.\n\nBut ‘My Krazy Life’ is the epitome of what an album should be. It tells a compelling story that also manages to have songs that stand on their own feet very well. There are short songs that tell the story of YG’s krazy life. One gets a strong sense that the situations expressed on the album are all too real. YG begins the album proper with ‘BPT’ a description of how he was ‘put-on’; the beating-induction many gang members go through. Here, we see YG being inducted into the Tree Top Pirus. Then, after narrating a failed robbery in ‘1AM’ YG gets arrested. The audience learns of his fate in the short track ‘Thank God (Interlude)’, where we are told by RJ that YG has been incarcerated and needs bail out money from his mom. Big TC begins the track with some soulful singing, and RJ’s summary of the story so far is done in an artistic way. The narration skills are palpable. The same is displayed in ‘Sorry Momma’, where YG apologies to his mother, I’m a song which is very introspective for him, but it adds too the richness of the narrative. ‘My Krazy Life’ is the perfect concept album, one that tells a story. It’s the narrative which is incredible, and that’s what makes it such a great album, worthy of coming 1st in Complex’s Best Albums of 2014 So Far (as of June 2014), 2nd in Complex’s 50 Best Albums of 2014 overall, and 2nd in Rolling Stones Best Rap Albums of 2014. And, finally, my favourite rap album of 2014."
