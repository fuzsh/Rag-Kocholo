        "text": "FO·MO\n\nˈfōmō/\n\nnoun\n\ninformal\n\nanxiety that an exciting or interesting event may currently be happening elsewhere, often aroused by posts seen on a social media website.\n\n“I realized I was a lifelong sufferer of FOMO”\n\nUrban dictionary definition: The fear that if you miss a party or event you will miss out on something great.\n\nMy definition: DON’T MISS THE EVENT.\n\nLuckily, I’m here to provide you with all things you’ve missed, in this popping city of Los Angeles. My name is Shirley Ju, and I live, breathe, sleep Hip Hop. Coming from the Bay, I grew up to the hyphy movement. That being said, turning up is all I know. This will be a weekly recap of the dope events that I myself felt like I couldn’t miss, and you guys wish you were at.\n\nWednesday, January 18\n\nHello, fitness. If you know me, you know I’m all about that life. I need them endorphins. My girl hit me with this flier and it was an automatic yes. A workout class on top of the W in Hollywood? And it’s free? Come on now. This was the exact push I needed to get through the week. Hump Day was too real today.\n\nGet right.\n\nI take the elevator up to the 12th floor and realize this is where Drais nightclub used to be. Literally, in the same exact room. At least we had the most glorious view overlooking Hollywood while we were suffering. Shout out to The Fit Society– they provided us with water, towels, food samples and a DJ. It felt like a rave for a second. First up: a booty class with @TamraDae. One look at her and you’re like shit. We’re about to get our ass worked lmao.\n\nI was sweating. Squats, squats and more squats. With barely a break in between, we set up our yoga mats for FIT Yoga with @AgostinaFitness. I brought my own mat, but this W Hollywood one was too cute not to Snap. I stole the idea from Monica who posted up right next to me. I do go to yoga, so I wasn’t completely lost, but damn. Homegirl was definitely not joking with the “fit” part. This was physically challenging (endless vinyasa flows and poses), but so rewarding.\n\nIt looks like they will be making this a regular thing starting in February, so definitely check it out if you’re in the area!\n\nTonight was the night of the Migos show in L.A., which sold the fuck out after Childish Gambino/Donald Glover put them on during the Golden Globes. I literally pull up to The NOVO with no tickets, in my workout clothes. There was a 50/50 chance I would get in, and I usually have confidence in my ninja skills. Score. I called my girl to roll and she literally SKRT-ed her way over. Down-ass bitch.\n\nI walk into an overly crowded room full of sweat. I know I always say a show is sold out, but this was beyond that. It looked like it was over capacity. I couldn’t even move to my secret spot next to the stage. There were a lot of dudes. . . it was difficult to move anywhere. We were all hyped when the trio graced the stage, though. I couldn’t help but notice the NMD’s and Yeezy’s on their feet. First guest of the night: Ty Dolla $ign performing “Blasé.” Of course.\n\nYG was next. This was just the beginning. Especially being booted from every spot we were posted. The security at NOVO were relentless. I just wanted to get prime footage. And the VIP Voucher was not getting us anywhere. And then out of nowhere, two guys in the front let us take the railing because we were small. Shout out to the good people in the world.\n\nThe crowd went wild for Lil Yachty, who proceeded to stay on stage the rest of Migos’ set. He was literally sitting in front of the DJ, just posted, looking bored af lmao. I thought it was epic. He had the mosh pit lit. Teenage boys love that shit.\n\nThe fact that 2 Chainz showed up was monumental. ATL in the building. “Big Amount” was straight up one of my favorite songs from 2016.\n\nThis was a damn movie. “Bad and Boujee” literally might be a song our kids will still be playing. My girl found out her friend ran into Chance The Rapper on her way out and sure enough, he pops on stage with his cute little “3” dad hat, alongside YG, Lil Yachty, Ty Dolla $ign, Nick Young, 2 Chainz, Sincere, Jordan Clarkson, and so many more. Shout out to Lil Boat for the RT! That shit makes my day.\n\nThursday, January 19\n\nToday was something to look forward to, a live taping of Ridiculousness, hosted by Rob Dyrdek and co-hosted by Sterling “Steelo” Brim and Chanel West Coast. If you guys aren’t familiar, it’s this hilarious, entertaining, comedy clip show (thanks Wiki) showing viral videos from the internet. I love it because they put them in categories, and it’s always named something witty.\n\nShout out to our homeboy who loves Rob and invited me along. He came up on free tickets just from following their pages. Yes guys, free tickets. If you in L.A., this is a must. We lined up outside Hollywood Center Studios where his girl and I attended a live taping of Teen Mom OG Reunion. That shit was dope, but this was way, way better. We could actually see the stage this time, and we sat in most comfortable, plush, red velvet couches.\n\nSnuck a picture of the set.\n\nIt was scheduled for 10:45 a.m., but of course we didn’t get let in until almost 12 p.m. They said no phones, so naturally I snuck mine in. I had to e-mail okay? And sneak this picture of the stage. That shit was lit. It was so fun. Rob is hilarious and who doesn’t love Chanel West Coast? Minus her laugh. That shit got a little annoying lmao. If you watch the show, you feel me.\n\nThe whole thing lasted an hour to an hour and a half. No one was checking. It was so awesome. The crowd was a good sport, too. We were all here for it. Steelo had me crushing. Everything he said was just funny. “Funny” is the way to my heart.\n\nTonight was Migos part two, sort of. I say that because I left before their performance. Smh. This was outdoors, and it started raining on us. Not cool. We literally tried to stay but we dipset. I heard right after we left, Chris Brown showed up and turned the fuck up. Damnit. And Tyga and Kylie Jenner.\n\nTwo lovely doves to greet you on your way in.\n\nI felt like they could have done a little more after making the people wait two hours. I just had the most lit time with them last night, so I wasn’t tripping. I just didn’t want to be standing in the damn rain. Shout out to my girl Brittany with Beats 1 Apple Music. She got me in with no worries (shout out to her friend Nelson at Dash Radio). I pull up to their headquarters on Cahuenga in Hollywood a little after 7 p.m. to find a line of people outside eager to get in.\n\nI couldn’t figure out if this was open to the public, because to me, it was the definition of an industry event. All love, though, I saw many familiar faces that I was able to catch up with. They had free drinks inside for the VIP. We did enjoy a nice set from a Mexican band/orchestra, though. They were random, but great.\n\nMy next move was to push to The Grove to catch Split at 10:15 p.m. This was opening night and I was expecting a crowd, but it was damn near empty. I think the rain scared everyone away. But anyways, the trailer for this looked nuts, and it was. It was fucking amazing. It’s directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan (GOAT).\n\nThe film is about a man (James McAvoy) who has 24 split personalities and ends up kidnapping three young females. I honestly don’t know if they could have picked a better person to play the role. He was phenomenal and played the “crazy” part so perfectly. Also, one of the three girls, Haley Lu Richardson, is from Edge of Seventeen, which I thoroughly enjoyed. She killed it too.\n\nThis movie is so intense and unpredictable. It was honestly amazing. The actual diagnosis is called Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Disorder). It’s just so crazy to me that some people literally don’t see reality. It’s actually along the lines of what I study in school and makes me excited to share with my classmates.\n\nI highly recommend this film. Let me know if you see it so we can discuss.\n\nFriday, January 20\n\nTGIF, kind of. No days off is the motto. Tonight was Problem’s Chachivillemixtape listening party on Fairfax in West Hollywood. It took place at a small (pop-up?) shop called Gold Gods. When you think of Problem, you think of “Like Whaaaaaat.” And if you’re in L.A., you know he’s responsible for the L.A. Rams team anthem (“My Squad”). Either way, he’s lit.\n\nI’ve been a day one fan, so it’s super dope to see him put in work and continue to grow. Huge shout out to Melissa for putting this together, she’s a boss bitch. There’s actually a track on the project called “Moneeey” dedicated to the ladies who get their money. It had us giggin’. The evening started with a Q&A with the producers on the project.\n\nProb came out right after to play us a snippet of each track off the project. “Better Watch Yo Self” started us off solid. Of course, everyone was pushed to the front trying desperately to get footage of Prob. He was just posted up front with a bleezy, enjoying life. I really fuck with his personality. All good vibes here. He also played us “Melrose,” which was way too damn fitting (we were posted on Fairfax and Melrose).\n\nIt was all love here. Shout out to G Perico showing love. Also, I loved how the project dropped at 3:54 p.m. Diamond Lane is the movement (his record label). I thought it was adorable his nephew was deejaying. Prob puts on for his people. He closed with “All Year” before he stepped out to mingle with the crowd. Man, that song is nothing but good vibes. Also, free cannabis ice cream? Yas.\n\nNext up, 24Hrs and Ye Ali at The Roxy on Sunset. I had to use Ty Dolla $ign’s tweet because I saw his publicist Aishah and told her I knew Ty would be here tonight. Wrong. He was on a plane to Australia. This was the first time he’s not making an appearance at a Hip Hop show in L.A. lmao.\n\nIf you guys aren’t familiar, 24Hrs is MadeinTYO’s brother, who definitely made an appearance tonight. He performed “Skateboard P,” which goes so damn hard. Twenty used to go by Royce Rizzy, and then completely changed his persona. All I know is, all of a sudden we were blessed with some baby-making music. With a touch of auto-tune (maybe more than a touch).\n\nI was curious how it would work with his voice, and it took a little getting used to. But it was cool. His microphone seemed to do the trick. He had this tiny venue completely sold out. I didn’t even know people fucked with him like that. “All The Time” is definitely everyone’s favorite. That track goes. His first special guest night of the night was Kyle, who came out during Aminé’s show. He performed his hit single “iSpy” with Lil Yachty. And then E-40 walked right by us. I had to double take lmao.\n\nWiz Khalifa, though. I died. Right after Twenty and him performed “What You Like” with Ty$, he threw it back with one of my favorite Wiz tracks: “Mesmerized.” We were lit. It was perfect.\n\n“Malibu” featuring Post Malone was another one of my favorites tonight. Finally got to see the mysterious 24Hrs on his Open Late Tour. One for the books."
