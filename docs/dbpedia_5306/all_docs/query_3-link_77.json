        "text": "Over the last few years, K-pop idols have become global and the boundaries of a nation no longer define the popularity of a group. These days, many K-pop idols practice their English speaking skills in order to communicate easily with international fans but this is not a problem for bi-racial artists from South Korea who are able to communicate in English and have made a name for themselves in the international rap scene while establishing a global fanbase for themselves.\n\nSuch is the case for singer and rapper Jay Park who is not only an idol or an entrepreneur but also a part of the American rap scene all thanks to his birth and upbringing in the states. After establishing a fanbase for himself in South Korea when he became the leader of 2AM, his departure from the group and then his rise back to fame as the CEO of not one but two labels, AOMG and H1GHR Music, Jay Park is quite the phenomenon globally.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nKorean rapper Jay Park holds Q&A session with fans amid coronavirus quarantine, teases new album and 2021 tour\n\nK-pop idols Jay Park, Tiger JK, 2ne1's CL, GOT7's Mark and more show support for Black Lives Matter movement\n\nJay Park goes international\n\nIn order to expand his network and make a more prominent global name for himself, Jay Park will collaborate with Wiz Khalifa. On November 9, it was announced by 7SIX9 Entertainment that Jay Park will be a part of a new project called ‘DREAM-X Project’ in collaboration with the American rapper.\n\n7SIX9 is one of the newer labels of K-pop that manages some global collaborations featuring K-pop artists. According to their website, the label is in partnership with international corporations from Jerry L Greenberg called Maestro of the music industry and many other diverse global corporations.\n\n7SIX9’s Global Ventures\n\nThe last known release from 7SIX9 was the song ‘Let’s Shut Up and Dance’ that was released as a collaboration between American singer Jason Derulo, Chinese rapper as well as the K-pop group EXO’s member Lay and the K-pop sub-group of NCT, NCT 127. The song was dedicated to pop legend Michael Jackson. With their tagline, “We create unique cultural content that transcends race and nation,” the label is ready to welcome another fruitful collaboration between South Korea and America.\n\nFollowing this grand hit collab featuring one K-pop act, one Chinese artist and one American artist, 7SIX9 is ready to bring South Korea and America together through Jay Park and Wiz Khalifa’s collaboration. This collaboration is said to be one that will capture the hearts of many global listeners as they harmoniously blend their identities into the music through the project."
