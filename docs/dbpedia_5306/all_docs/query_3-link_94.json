Former G-Unit member, Young Buck, was first to recognize Serm using his production for the diss track “Steriodz” aimed at his former collaborator 50-Cent.\n\nSerm continued to appear on rap mixtapes in the early 2010’s, most notably with the internet-breaking “Kush & OJ'' by Wiz Khalifa.\n\nSerm then shifted into pop music and cross-over genres, producing the worldwide #1, 9x RIAA platinum single “Timber“ by Pitbull & Ke$ha. He has since amassed multiple platinum and gold awards worldwide with artists J Balvin, Pitbull, Camila Cabello, Demi Lovato, and Trey Songz. He has placed five Official UK Chart top 10 singles with Sean Paul, Dua Lipa, Zara Larson and Flo Rida. In collaboration with Jason Derulo, Serm produced the official Coca-Cola 2018 Fifa World Cup song.
