        "text": "We're always looking to our playlists to set the mood and even more so when we continue to transition from the Spring to the Summer! We're excited that our 100th issue is covered by Singer/songwriter, rapper, and record producer, Jeremih. This musician also is well versed in playing the saxaphone, several percussion instruments such as congas and timbales, and piano/keyboards.\n\nIn 2009, his debut single Birthday Sex dropped and in addition to being a song that we enjoyed hearing, it came to #4 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. After its release he continued to create hits with his 2010 single, Down on Me (featuring 50 Cent), and this single enjoyed successes that included sextuple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Don't Tell 'Em (featuring YG) was a 2014 single that was his 3rd top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100. He also continued releasing more singles with Oui and Planez (featuring J. Cole) with both receiving quintuple platinum certification by RIAA.\n\nHe also formed the duo MihTy with Ty Dolla Sign in 2018 where they had a collaborative album that was released in 2018. He has worked with a number of artists including 50 Cent, DJ Khaled, Ty Dolla Sign, YG, J. Cole, Flo Rida, Big Sean, Future, Lil Wayne, Fabolous, Chris Brown, French Montana, Wiz Khalifa, and more. He has also written songs for Kanye West, and Nicki Minaj.\n\nHis work has received additional recognition from winning an iHeartRadio Music Awards in 2015 for Hip Hop/R&B Song of the Year, 2X Nominee for Billboard Music Awards for Top R&B Song, Grammy Nominated for Best R&B Performance, and being Nominated for the American Music Awards R&B Breakout Artist to name a few.\n\nWe have enjoyed listening to Late Nights: The Album (Slowed Down) as well as seeing him on 50 Cent's The Final Lap Tour and as he is always working on projects, collaborations, features, we enjoyed seeing him play Elijah Linden in S1 of Power Book IV: Force.\n\nWe wanted to know more about how he was introduced to music, talking about the success of his single Birthday Sex, how he became involved in Birthday Sex Wine, and more.\n\nATHELEISURE MAG: From a young age you cultivated being a musician by learning how to play the drums, saxophone, percussion instruments, and piano/keyboards! What is it that you love about playing those instruments and incorporating them into your music?\n\nJEREMIH: My primary choice of instruments currently is playing the keys and drums. Playing instruments is like speaking a different language of emotion. Each instrument carries its own unique tone and character, allowing me to express myself in diverse ways. Incorporating them into my music adds layers of richness and authenticity, creating a deeper connection with the audience.\n\nAM: Your debut single, Birthday Sex, peaked at #4 on Billboard's Hot 100. What did it feel like to have all the successes that were associated with that song?\n\nJ: It was an incredible moment of validation and gratitude. Birthday Sex continues to resonate with so many people, and seeing it climb the charts was surreal. It was a testament to the hard work and dedication I had put into my craft.\n\nAM: How did Birthday Sex Wine come about and why did you want to get into the wine industry?\n\nJ: For the past few years, white wine has been my drink of choice. Birthday Sex Wine was born out of a desire to create something special that would enhance celebrations and memorable moments. I've always been intrigued by the wine industry and saw an opportunity to blend my passion for music with the art of winemaking. It's a way to share joy and elevate experiences through a unique product that reflects my personality and style.\n\nAM: In creating this wine, how much was your involvement?\n\nJ: I was all in on the process, from choosing the perfect blend of grapes to the look and feel of the label. My respect for winemaking came from hanging with winemaker Russell Bevan, who is known for an impressive collection of over fifteen 100-point wines. We spent time together in Napa developing the taste profile and educating me on the process of winemaking.\n\nWe wanted to know more about Birthday Sex Wine as Russell Bevan who is known as one of Nappa Valley's most acclaimed winemakers. We wanted to find out where his passion for wine came from, his successful wine company, how he came to Birthday Sex Wine and more.\n\nATHLEISURE MAG: When did you realize that you had a passion for wine?\n\nRUSSELL BEVAN: I have had an intimate relationship with wine most of my life. Even as a child, I asked if I could go back for seconds during mass. For my whole life, wine has captivated my pallet and mind.\n\nAM: Prior to launching your own wine companies, can you tell us about your background in this industry?\n\nRB: I wrote a wine column through the Minneapolis Star Tribune and worked for the Gallo Winery doing sales while in college.\n\nAM: How did Birthday Sex Wine come about?\n\nRB: Jeremih and I met at a friend's house (Rob Ellin) and started talking about our mutual love affair with wine and that seed has grown into Birthday Sex.\n\nAM: Can you walk us through the process of what it is like to create a wine? Where do you start?\n\nRB: Everything starts with mother nature -- the soil microclimate we grow the grapes in and the growing season. We are the caretakers of what she gives us with this project. Our goal is to craft something that has delicious, pure flavors and a seductive mouthfeel.\n\nAM: This wine is a Naked Chardonnay, do you foresee that there will be other varieties under this brand?\n\nRB: The door is always open, Jeremih and I just have to find enough time together to taste wines that inspire us.\n\nAM: Outside of Birthday Sex Wine, are there other wines that you're creating that will be launching that we should keep an eye out for?\n\nRB: Adversity Cellars! Massively concentrated Cabernets with lush textures and pure fruit flavors.\n\nIG @jeremih\n\n@birthdaysexwine\n\n@adversitycellars\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY COURTESY | PG 16 - 21, 9PLAYLIST PG 22 + 23, 9DRIP PG 24 - 27 | Jeremih\n\nRead the APR ISSUE #100 of Athleisure Mag and see TELL ‘EM | Jeremih in mag."
