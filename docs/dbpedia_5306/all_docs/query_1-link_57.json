        "text": "Pittsburgh MC Wiz Khalifa‘s new single “Black & Yellow” gave the rapper his first single on the R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart when it debuted at No. 99 last week. While the song is making its mark on radio, the 23-year-old rapper has bigger plans for the track, telling MTV that he hopes the song soundtracks his beloved Pittsburgh Steelers’ future NFL seasons.\n\n“It’s gonna be the Steelers’ anthem,” said Khalifa, who titled the song after the football team’s color scheme. In the official “Black & Yellow” video released Sunday (Oct. 10), the rapper is shown wearing a Steelers “world champions” sweatshirt and waving the team’s “terrible towel.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nWhile “Black & Yellow” would make for a catchy NFL anthem, the song is not the first modern attempt to create a fight song for a football team. Here are four of the most notable fight songs that mainstream artists have recently written for their favorite NFL franchises:\n\nT-Pain, “Miami Dolphins Fight Song”\n\nTo kick off their 2009-10 season, the Miami Dolphins unveiled a track by T-Pain that updated their classic fight song. The singer combines the energetic melody with bumping percussion and his signature Auto-Tuned vocals.\n\nJim Jones, “We Fly High (New York Giants Remix)”\n\nThe Dipset rapper reworked his single “We Fly High” in 2006 to complement the New York Giants, who would play the song during celebrations. “Touchdown! You do it like Jim Jones/Fadeaway dance when you hit the end zone,” Jones raps on the track.\n\nPrince, “Purple and Gold”\n\nTo cheer on his Minnesota football team, Prince released this majestic rally cry last January as Brett Favre and the Vikings were about to take on the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship Game. The orchestral track didn’t spur on the team, however, as the Vikings lost the game in overtime."
