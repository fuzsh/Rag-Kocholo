        "text": "Wiz Khalifa has been criticized after sharing a preview of the sequel to his classic mixtape Kush & Orange Juice.\n\nThe Taylor Gang chief teased Kush & Orange Juice 2 on Instagram on Wednesday (April 24), where he posted behind-the-scenes footage of him working on a track for the mixtape.\n\nHe wrote in the caption: “Mixing and co producing this album has been so much fun. I learned a lot in the process and took myself to levels i didn’t even know i could go. I can’t wait until you guys get to experience how special and amazing this body of work is. #KushandOrangeJuice2.”\n\nWiz’s enthusiasm was not shared by all of his fans, though, with some unimpressed by the song snippet — which sounded more melodic than the music featured on the original 2010 mixtape.\n\n“With all due respect Wiz this is not a kush and orange juice 2 worth song. Kush and orange juice 2 should be as dope as 1 respectfully there were no skips,” one fan commented.\n\nAnother said: “Please don’t be on KAOJ2 with all that commercial shit, we need mixtape wiz on that, don’t mess up a classic gang.”\n\nA third added: “Please don’t name it Kush and OJ 2. The music you put out now doesn’t even REMOTELY COME CLOSE to the music you was puttin out in the 1st Kush and OJ. I’m saying this as a Wiz fan and respectfully, you’re gonna ruin the Kush and OJ name with this type of music.”\n\nWiz Khalifa has been hyping up Kush & Orange Juice 2 in recent months, going so far as to call it a “classic.”\n\nHe also revealed on social media this week that he’s been working on the project with legendary producers like DJ Quik and Juicy J, as well as frequent collaborators Ty Dolla $ign and Problem (a.k.a. Jason Martin).\n\n“I used to finish my albums and turn them in and kind of just wonder what they were gonna sound like. Not anymore,” he wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\n\n“This time i got with my favorite producers (a whole team including Ty$, Juicy J, Problem and Dj Quik to name a few) and created a sound that’s Taylor’d to the way i would do things.”\n\nHe added: “I’ve been in every mixing session Breaking down samples, replacing instruments, changing drums, and sequencing songs to make sure this album is a complete reflection of where I’m at musically. I’m really excited to share it with you guys.”"
