She may only be 17, but with two albums, six films and more than 1 million Instagram followers to her name, it's clear she is already something of a veteran.\n\nA lot has happened to the artist since we spoke to her in 2016; no doubt 2018 will see her adding even more amazing achievements to her CV."
