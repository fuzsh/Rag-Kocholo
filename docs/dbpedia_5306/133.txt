Cameron Jibril Thomaz (born September 8, 1987), better known by his stage name Wiz Khalifa, is an American rapper and actor from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He released his debut album, Show and Prove, in 2006, and signed to Warner Bros. Records in 2007. His Eurodance-influenced single, "Say Yeah", received urban radio airplay and helped to bring Khalifa to a wider audience.

Khalifa left Warner Bros. and released his second album, Deal or No Deal, in November 2009. He released the mixtape Kush and Orange Juice as a free mixtape in 2010, and then signed with Atlantic Records. He is also well known for his debut single on Atlanta, "Black and Yellow", which peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. His debut album for Atlantic, Rolling Papers, was released in March 2011. He followed that album with O.N.I.F.C. the following year, which was backed by the singles "Work Hard, Play Hard" and "Remember You". Khalifa released his fourth studio album Blacc Hollywood in August 2014, backed by the lead single "We Dem Boyz". In March 2015, he released "See You Again" for the soundtrack of the film Furious 7 and the song peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200 for twelve non-consecutive weeks.
