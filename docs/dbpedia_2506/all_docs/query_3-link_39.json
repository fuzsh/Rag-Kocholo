        "text": "What is a tree kangaroo?\n\nHidden high in the treetops of rainforests in northeastern Australia and New Guinea are the tree kangaroos. It may be surprising to think of a kangaroo living in the trees, but there was once a time when all kangaroos resided in trees. As the species evolved, they migrated down to become ground kangaroos. Over millions of years, though, some returned to the trees and adapted to the arboreal lifestyle.\n\nThough tree kangaroos are one of the lesser-known species of Australia, they are by no means less fascinating. Unlike their ground-dwelling kangaroo relatives, tree kangaroos are well adapted to thrive in the dense canopy of tropical rainforests. Although there are 14 species of tree kangaroos, each with unique characteristics, these marsupials typically have long and muscled arms, curved and sharp claws, as well as large and padded back feet, which mold around trees to aid with climbing. A distinct characteristic of tree kangaroos are their long, bushy tails, which they often push against tree trunks for balance and stability.\n\nThe size, weight, and fur color of a tree kangaroo can vary based on the species. Lumholtz’s tree kangaroo usually has reddish-grey fur, weighs about seven kilograms (15 pounds) and stands around 56 centimeters (22 inches) tall. Bennett’s tree kangaroo, on the other hand, has a grey-brown coat with a black underside, weighs up to 14 kilograms (30 pounds), and stands 76 centimeters (30 inches) tall.\n\nTree kangaroos are herbivores. Their diet is primarily made up of leaves, roots, seasonal fruits, and bark. They spend hours foraging in their arboreal habitat for foliage and fruits, though they will sometimes visit the ground in search of more food.\n\nThe tree kangaroo is a solitary creature, and these macropods don’t typically form strong social bonds. Instead, male tree kangaroos interact with several females, and females remain independent from males. They usually only come together during mating periods. While little is known about the specific breeding habits of tree kangaroos, they’re thought to be opportunistic breeders rather than seasonal ones.\n\nFemale tree kangaroos birth one offspring at a time, after a gestation period of approximately 44 days. A newborn tree kangaroo—known as a joey—resembles a fetus and is no bigger than a bean. Tree kangaroos are marsupials, meaning the females don’t develop a placenta and instead carry their young around in a pouch on their abdomen. These pouches contain teats, from which the joeys nurse.\n\nA joey stays inside its mother’s pouch for around nine months, followed by a weaning period of another one to two months during which it hops in and out of the pouch. Despite their preferred solitude, female tree kangaroos are thought to form strong social bonds with their offspring. The joeys stay with their mothers until they reach sexual maturity at around two years old.\n\nTree kangaroos play an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of their arboreal habitats. As they move through the trees, they aid both pollination and seed dispersal, which is critical to the regeneration, functioning, and resilience of forests. This is particularly important given how beneficial rainforests are to the Earth’s ecosystem. Not only do they capture and store carbon, helping mitigate climate change, but they’re also critical to local communities, as these ecosystem services help provide food, water, and shelter.\n\nDespite their significance to the health of our world’s rainforests, tree kangaroos face threats to their survival. Habitat destruction—as a result of deforestation, hunting, and human encroachment—poses challenges for the species.\n\nTo safeguard these fascinating animals and the biodiversity of rainforests, more conservation efforts are needed. Learn more about the tree kangaroos and how we can help them.\n\nWhat is a tree kangaroo’s scientific name?\n\nTree kangaroos belong to the genus Dendrolagus. Part of the Macropodidae family, the genus Dendrolagus is the only arboreal group of kangaroos—meaning they’re the only ones that live in trees.\n\nDendrolagus is split into two main divisions. There are the more ancestral species, which include the two Australian species (Bennett’s tree kangaroos and Lumholtz’s tree kangaroos), which are known for their long feet. There are also shorter-footed species that are more evolved than the former, which include the 12 species from New Guinea and Indonesia.\n\nThere are currently 14 known species of tree kangaroos:\n\nHuon tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus matschiei)\n\nDoria’s tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus dorianus)\n\nLowlands tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus spadix)\n\nGoodfellow’s tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus goodfellowi)\n\nTenkile tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus scottae)\n\nVogelkop tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus ursinus)\n\nWondiwoi tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus mayri)\n\nSeri’s tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus stellarum)\n\nGrizzled tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus inustus)\n\nLumholtz’s tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus lumholtzi)\n\nBennett’s tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus bennettianus)\n\nGolden-mantled tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus pulcherrimus)\n\nDingiso tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus mbaiso)\n\nIfola tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus notatus)\n\nAre tree kangaroos endangered?\n\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, tree kangaroos range from near threatened to critically endangered across the various species. Here are the different tree kangaroos’ IUCN classifications:\n\nNear threatened: Lumholtz’s tree kangaroo, Bennett’s tree kangaroo\n\nVulnerable: Doria’s tree kangaroo, lowlands tree kangaroo, Vogelkop tree kangaroo, Seri’s tree kangaroo, grizzled tree kangaroo\n\nEndangered: Huon tree kangaroo, Goodfellow’s tree kangaroo, dingiso tree kangaroo, ifola tree kangaroo\n\nCritically endangered: Tenkile tree kangaroo, Wondiwoi tree kangaroo, golden-mantled tree kangaroo\n\nWhere do tree kangaroos live?\n\nTree kangaroos are found in the rainforests of Australia, New Guinea, and Indonesia. Their habitats range from lowland tropical forests to mountainous regions, where there is dense vegetation and plenty of tree cover. Here’s a breakdown of where you can find each of the tree kangaroo species:\n\nAustralia: Bennett’s tree kangaroo and Lumholtz’s tree kangaroo\n\nPapua New Guinea: Ifola tree kangaroo, Tenkile tree kangaroo, Doria’s tree kangaroo, lowlands tree kangaroo, and Huon tree kangaroo\n\nIndonesia: Dingiso tree kangaroo, Vogelkop tree kangaroo, and Wondiwoi tree kangaroo\n\nBoth Papua New Guinea and Indonesia: Seri’s tree kangaroo, grizzled tree kangaroo, golden-mantled tree kangaroo, and Goodfellow’s tree kangaroo\n\nThese rainforests provide the perfect home for tree kangaroo’s arboreal lifestyle. Compared to kangaroos found on the ground, tree kangaroos have longer forearms and shorter hind legs. Unlike terrestrial kangaroos, tree kangaroos can move their hind legs separately, which aids them in their climbing movements, as well as hopping. Tree kangaroos also have rough pads on their fore and hind feet, as well as long claws which help them grip trees."
