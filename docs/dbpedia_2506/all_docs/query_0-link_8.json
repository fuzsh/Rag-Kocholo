        "text": "In the year 2016 we bought our first Lagotto Romagnolo. Step by step we were discovering how fantastic this breed is. These are unbelievably clever dogs, they learn quickly and can adapt to every situation. And that´s why we decided to get another dog friend for our Lagotto. We tried to find a suitable puppy in our country, in Bohemia, but at that time there was no puppy available. So we started to look in Italy, in the country of the origin of this breed. By pure chance we came across the website of Valle dei Medici and immediately contacted them. We got an answer from David very soon. He said he was expecting a litter of puppies in the near future. We were all looking forward to it very much and impatiently were expecting the good news. Finally! David sent us a message that the puppies were born. From that time on we were in contact and we were following the progress of the puppies. David chose a puppy exactly as we had wished. We went to collect Ermes immediately after the New Year and we brought him home on 3rd of January 2019. Since then Ermes has been a source of joy for us. In a few days he will be six months old. He had grown into a lovable doggie and is very smart and sweet. Thank you very much, David.\n\nWe are so so happy with our Lagotto puppy. Myself and my family cannot thank David and his family enough for firstly, raising such a beautiful dog in a beautiful home for us but also for all of the advice and support they have given throughout the process and afterwards. We bought our puppy back from Italy to the UK, which requires a lot of administration and paperwork which David was extremely helpful and knowledgeable with. His family have such a love for their dogs which is evident in how they are bred and raised. Our Lagotto now completes our home, with his intelligent, calm and loyal nature and that is all thanks to these wonderful breeders. We look forward to sharing stories as he grows up and wish for them to come and visit whenever they need. I could not recommend Valle dei Medici enough and will be sure to visit again in the future, maybe we will bring back another Lagotto. Thank you!\n\nWe decided to take a lagotto, after my poodle had unfortunately been missing for a few months, and I searched the Internet for a serious farm to turn to.\n\nThe breeding valley of the Medici inspired me immediately: already browsing the site you perceive the love with which these dogs are grown and followed, in addition to seriousness and transparency (everything is documented).\n\nFrom the very first contact with David, I received the utmost assistance. Not being able to go to see the puppy, because very distant from my region, David sent me videos and photos of the litter so that I could follow the puppy (which had identified for me according to my requests) as it grew and this made more ” Slight “the wait.\n\nWhen it finally came the long awaited day and I went to get it, I found a clean environment and full of stimuli, in which dogs can grow well, followed by David, which must be said, is first of all a big fan and you see that puts the heart.\n\nI am very satisfied with my choice.\n\nSnoopy is a fantastic and balanced puppy as well as beautiful and is fully satisfying the features I was looking for (in this David was really good at identifying the puppy for me!).\n\nPassion and professionalism are the characteristics of this excellent breeding, which I recommend to anyone who wants to become a friend of a small lagotto.\n\nWe had booked a puppy for the end of June/July 2018.\n\nThen one day I get a message on my phone from David asking me to call him right away; Alarmed I do it and I discover that sometimes sudden news can be also positive.\n\nIt tells me that there would be immediate availability of a puppy, good, very bellino and Trotts on a leash that looks like the master of the world.\n\nI think a little ‘, say a few minutes and together with my wife and daughter we accept to go to his kennel to take it.\n\nHere, it was love at first sight!\n\nMy family and I had not yet decided on the name but once we saw the puppy and learned the name “provisional” We said: Yes, if until today you have been called Billy… For us Billy is perfect!\n\nThe time to take care of the bureaucratic aspects and then we loaded it in the car and brought it home. As excited as a child is to his first bicycle.\n\nToday, after almost two months, I have to say that Billy changed his life. He’s a loving, playful puppy and he’s partying every time he sees us.\n\nOn the street we continually stop to ask the breed and congratulate us for how beautiful it is.\n\nCertainly every now and then we have some organizational mishap but the love that Billy is something that has no comparison so we always find a solution.\n\nDavid and Martina are very helpful people and the love they eat for dogs is intuit at the first visit.\n\nI mean… Would you like a small room? Go to the Medici Valley and you will not be disappointed.\n\nMy 7-year-old Emma was very afraid of dogs and we then decided to take her a puppy to overcome this little phobia. After a careful study of the breeds, we decided for the Lagotto Romagnolo that for his sweet and affectionate character seemed to do our case. After an equally careful search on the Internet we stumbled upon David. He and our little Carrie’s Lagottina have changed our lives.\n\nOur puppy is beautiful (they stop us constantly to ask for the breed), lively, intelligent and sympathetic; It is very sweet with everyone, even with dogs that show themselves not too friendly.\n\nAnd our little girl loves her. Now they are inseparable and we too could not do without the parties that he does every time he sees us.\n\nPuppies are challenging, but in exchange for a little attention they give you an affection that has no comparisons!\n\nAbout a year ago wanting a puppy to accompany my dog from truffles of twelve years, I sent messages, through the network, to various farms to know the availability of puppies of female lagotto.\n\nAmong these farms there was also “the Valley of the Medici” who contacted me by phone.\n\nThe phone call has inevitably touched on various aspects of my request and I must sincerely say that Yuri (David) gave me the impression of a breeder a little ‘ different from those so far known to me.\n\nIn fact, I was struck by a series of theories and a philosophy in bringing up which, in my humble opinion, expressed very dear concepts to me ever since.\n\nNot having on the moment puppies available I took time to decide, after some of my reflections I contacted Yuri by phone to schedule a visit to his kennel and also to know him in person.\n\nI must say that my visit and direct contact with Yuri did nothing but reinforce my conviction of taking a puppy from him.\n\nIn fact I waited almost a year, risking among other things to remain without dog from truffles given the age of my current.\n\nToday is almost a month that I have at home a beautiful puppy that Yuri has helped me to choose. I must say, without any doubt, that the expectation has been amply rewarded by a very clever, balanced and characterlessly tenacious specimen. Very very loving that since the first day has adapted without any problem to the new conditions. This is from experience, since it is about thirty years that I have truffle dogs, I think it is mainly due to the care with which Yuri chooses the subjects to be mated and the conditions with which it makes the puppies grow.\n\nNothing is left to chance and the results are immediately seen.\n\nNeedless to say I am delighted with my choice and have met a breeder with characteristics not usual in bringing up. Another very important thing is the continuous contact that Yuri holds even after with the owner of the puppy.\n\nProblems, doubts, clarifications are overable with your direct help. I can not say anything else that I was lucky to meet a farm and a breeder like Yuri, even if found accidentally through the network.\n\nDavid and Martina bring us heart, experience and honesty in raising puppies. They are following the insertion of our beautiful Lagottino even now from afar. Baloo has become part of a house with small children. After the first few days it was very well set.\n\nSo much of this is due to the character of the breed but also to the attention with which it has been bred since birth. Attentions which he received in the round also from the medical point of view.\n\nThe puppies in the kennel are followed by a very talented veterinarian. Proof of this is that my veterinary reference was affected by the quality of care that the puppy had received in breeding, as the type of vaccine.\n\nTo the many who ask me what breed is the dog and where I got it I can only suggest to turn to David and Martina.\n\nWe were looking for a lagotto as the first dog to be included in our family. And we arrived downstream of the doctors browsing the Internet.. A maremagnum who sometimes knows how to give unexpected surprises as in this case.\n\nDavid on the phone turned out to be a careful listener of our needs, as friendly and punctual in explaining the “World Lagotti”. The visit to the farm even before our Nina was conceived… It was a fundamental step to understand who we were dealing with.\n\nDavid and family have gone beyond expectation!\n\nIt is certainly a breeding, and the end is to sell the dogs.. But their love for these animals transcends the business itself and this is understood immediately. Dogs are not numbers, but rather small, beloved creatures and literally followed as children.\n\nThis is what we were looking for: a family that loved animals and that accompanied us in this important choice. When Nina came to Padua with us… David was waiting for our phone calls to find out if everything was okay… And if some times we forgot to call him.. They didn’t spend many days calling him! We could not ask for better: true love and passion United to Absolutà professonality.\n\nHe is Pepe, son of Saetta and Thor, born on March 15, 2017, puppy of Lagotto Romagnolo. Our pepper. Beautiful huh? I found it by clicking on the Internet, almost for gaming, one evening in April. Risky, I know, but, to look good you will find serious and available people.\n\nI was lucky: of the announcement I was impressed by the quality and the detailed certification with which the puppy would be delivered, as well as the love and care that there were behind the grow those six small pests.\n\nNothing was left to chance, from vaccines to nutrition, from documents to pedigree.\n\nYuri, the breeder of Valle dei Medici, gave me all the necessary information from the first contact demonstrating an out of the ordinary availability. In addition, he sent us periodically, with great video and photos, continuous updates of the growth and progress of small pepper. Photos and videos, news and invaluable information because the time to fill was so much! From April to June… The long wait, but beautiful.\n\nWe prepared for his arrival with a festive family organization, preparing to the best the welcome of the much desired pelosetto, from the kennel to the medal, from the bowls to the first ball.\n\nWe just had to wait for the time to complete the imprinting and socialization of the little (Yuri’s seriousness would never have allowed it to be taken away from the mother too early and without the necessary medical checks and vaccines) completed and then we could Take.\n\nThe fateful day was June 9th. A week ago. We started from Rome very excited: the wait was over. We couldn’t wait to see him, take him with us.\n\nAnd now it’s here that it slumbers on the marble belly to the air looking for a little ‘ refreshment from the hot these days…\n\nIt is not pointless to say that we are super happy and very very satisfied. He is very well, it is beautiful (even according to the veterinarian who visited here in Rome and that is not a type with easy compliments), smart, quiet and playful, morphogicamnte perfect and above all…. Adorable. Are and are-I, my son and my husband-really glad to have it with us and to have it taken in a serious breeding like the valley of the doctors on which we know to be able to count at all times even after its adoption.\n\nA beautiful ‘ canine ‘, as Yuri says in a wonderfully affectionate and exquisitely Tuscan way.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nFor some time my family and I were looking for a dog and looking on the Internet sites we saw a gentleman who sold puppies of Lagotto Romagnolo. I phoned to get some information and it seemed very helpful, with my wife and daughter we decided to see this puppy right away.\n\nLike to say, love at first sight.\n\nWe chose Rusty and I guarantee that the Lagotto is a terrific dog.\n\nWe had a great time at this farm for two essential reasons: they care about the puppies and they are very helpful and prepared people for any need even after bringing the puppy home.\n\nWe were surprised that they call us to get information about the health and progress of our Rusty.\n\nIt’s awesome, our Rusty!\n\nWe’ve had a Lagotto puppy for 10 days. We couldn’t have chosen better the breed and especially the breeding. David and Martina are exquisite people and you can see by the character of Balù (that’s how we called him) who was raised serene and healthy. Our little lake has settled immediately to us and to our house. He is always lively, very perceptive and has no problem to socialize with other dogs, people and even with small children. After a few days he has already learned to walk on a leash, to come back when he is called during his free runs. At night he sleeps peacefully even though we are in another room with the door closed. He has already had his first experience in the snow and had a lot of fun. What can I say… we are very happy with our choice and every day is a surprise for the progress made. Thank you David and Martina for giving us this chance.\n\nBaloo sulla neve a quattro mesi.\n\nWith pleasure I would like to say a few words about our puppy Doride and the Medici Valley breeding. We had recently lost our previous pond and the emptiness was too great. After many reflections I contacted David by chance because I was impressed by his beautiful dogs and the pictures of the past litters.\n\nSo I hoped to find a puppy available even though I thought it would be difficult because I could see that they were all booked. I cross my fingers and as if by magic, a litter of Amber and Pedro of 4 adorable little brown ponds of which 3 males and one female, my Doride, who with great love David decided to entrust me with. No choice was more appropriate, I never had any problems with her, she didn’t cry even on the first day, she is lively, cheerful and intelligent, a tireless, obedient and beautiful walker.\n\nLike all of you I have received compliments on how she has been raised and for this I thank David and Martina who bring out the best of this breed which, however, being very demanding, would not have these wonderful character and morphological characteristics. With the previous Lagotta I had many difficulties. She was afraid of dogs and a lot of behavioral problems while with Doride everything is simpler, she is not afraid of anything and she gives us a lot of love every day.\n\nThis shows that behind a great dog there is a great breeder.\n\nThank you very much for this ball of hair of happiness and see you soon."
