        "text": "Italian artist\n\nMassimilian Breeder (born in Genova, June 13, 1978) is an Italian artist who works in film, drawings, sound and installation. He spent his childhood with his grandparents between Genova, Italy and Polperro, England. In 1992 he returned to Italy to study at the Paul Klee Institute for the Arts, followed by Neuroscience Studies at the University of Florence, where he began working on neural networks and biofeedbacks research, while developing an interest in films and sculptural installations. He presented the first model of interaction between Cinema and Neuroscience at the prestigious Hôpital de la Salpêtrière in Paris, implementing the use of biofeedback technology to modulate and change the course of the narrative structure of a film. The project was titled Amigdalae and its development characterized Mr. Breeder's fascination with moving pictures. In 2002, he graduated with a degree in Experimental Psychology and began Cinema Studies at the National Civic School of Cinema in Milan, which he would later abandon to move to New York City and work on his film projects * [1]. Massimilian Breeder currently lives and works in USA and Europe.\n\nIn 1998 Mr. Breeder began working on film, sound and installation under the form of ongoing projects like Wurlitzer Repetition (Ignite Arts Center, Los Angeles 2007). His collaborations with Nina Breeder * [2] on New Reproductive Systems, films and installations received attention from The Pompidou Museum (Paris, France), Anthology Film Archive (NYC) and Guggenheim Museum (NYC). In 2008-09 his first feature film Devil Come to Hell and Stay Where You Belong (2008)* [3] obtained international interest and gave birth to a series of film works on the American Landscape. In his work Mr. Breeder explores elements of nature, employing narrative models from other domains, such as biology, geology, politics, characterized by concepts like restraint, fluids under pressure, violence and sexuality . In 2009, while working on a public installation \"Crude Oil\" in the Arabic neighborhood Darom - Tel Aviv, Mr.Breeder developed an interest in the Middle East and its endangered cultures and confines. During his extended stay in territories afflicted and transformed by ongoing conflicts, he wrote the film Reservoir, completed in late 2013.
