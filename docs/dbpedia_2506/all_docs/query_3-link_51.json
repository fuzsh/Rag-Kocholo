        "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nEl Ni√±o is currently underway, and the UN‚Äôs World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is warning that it could threaten lives and devastate agriculture in some parts of the world.\n\nThe global weather phenomenon refers to when waters in the Pacific Ocean become much warmer than usual.\n\nAfter three years of the cooling La Ni√±a weather pattern, El Ni√±o has now returned and will last at least through the first half of 2024, according to the latest United Nations forecasts.\n\nTemperature records have already been broken and El Ni√±o could push the world past a new average temperature record.\n\n\"El Ni√±o is normally associated with record breaking temperatures at the global level. Whether this will happen in 2023 or 2024 is not yet known, but it is, I think, more likely than not,\" says Carlo Buontempo, director of the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nThe climatic event could also have drastic weather effects like increased rainfall and stronger storms.\n\nThe WMO has urged governments to take adequate precautions in order to prevent loss of life.\n\n‚ÄúThe declaration by WMO is the signal to governments around the world to mobilise preparations,\" says Petteri Taalas, the WMO secretary-general.\n\n\"Early warnings and anticipatory action of extreme weather events associated with this major climate phenomenon are vital to save lives and livelihoods.‚Äù\n\nRising sea temperatures are already threatening the animal population of the Galapagos Islands.\n\nHere‚Äôs how climate scientists predict El Ni√±o will affect global temperatures, weather and marine life.\n\nWhat is El Ni√±o?\n\nThe El Ni√±o climate event is responsible for raising global temperatures and aggravating extreme weather events.\n\nIt is caused by ocean temperatures and winds in the Pacific that oscillate between warming El Ni√±o and cooling La Ni√±a.\n\nThis year is already predicted to be hotter than 2022 and the fifth or sixth hottest year on record.\n\nThe effects of El Ni√±o take months to be felt and may mean 2024 breaks temperature records.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe world's hottest year on record so far was 2016, coinciding with a strong El Ni√±o - although climate change has fuelled extreme temperatures even in years without the phenomenon.\n\nThe last eight years were the world's eight hottest on record - reflecting the longer-term warming trend driven by greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHow does El Ni√±o affect the weather?\n\nEl Ni√±o pushes warm water in the Pacific Ocean eastwards, causing the Pacific jet stream to move south of its neutral position.\n\nThis produces dryer and warmer weather in northern US and intense rainfall and flooding in the US Gulf Coast and Southeast.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Europe, it can lead to colder, drier winters in the north and wetter winters in the south.\n\nDuring the phenomenon, the global temperature increases by around 0.2 degrees Celsius, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nThis could mean breaking the crucial 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming limit.\n\n‚ÄúThe probability of having the first year at 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next five-year period is now about 50:50,‚Äù Professor Adam Scaife at the UK Met Office told the Guardian.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs a result, the world will face more intense heatwaves, prolonged hot seasons and more powerful storms.\n\nThe first places to feel the effects will be countries close to the Pacific, like the west coast of the Americas, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIndonesia and Australia will likely experience hotter and drier weather with a greater possibility of wildfires.\n\nMonsoons in India and rains in South Africa might be reduced while east Africa could get more rains and flooding.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEl Ni√±o also increases hurricane activity in the Pacific meaning places like Hawaii will be at risk of tropical cyclones.\n\nHow will El Ni√±o affect agriculture?\n\nAbnormal rainfall due across Latin America is raising fears for the agricultural sector, according to a report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).\n\nForecasts for the first quarter of 2024 show more rain than usual in southern cone countries such as Peru and Ecuador, as well as Mexico, alongside ongoing dry conditions in Brazil, Guyana and Suriname.\n\nThe current dry spell in Central America however is set to last only until the end of this year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe report also stresses that agriculture, which includes crops, livestock, forests and fishing, is particularly vulnerable given the sector can absorb 26 per cent of economic losses during extreme weather conditions and up to 82 per cent during drought.\n\nThe FAO said it has launched a plan to mobilize financial resources for vulnerable communities in several countries affected by the extreme weather.\n\nHow does El Ni√±o affect sea life?\n\nEl Ni√±o also endangers marine life along the Pacific Coast. In normal conditions, a phenomenon known as 'upwelling' brings cool, nutrient-rich water up from the ocean depths.\n\nWhen El Ni√±o occurs, this process is suppressed or halted completely. This means fewer phytoplankton along the coast resulting in less food for certain fish.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn March, scientists found that global sea surface temperatures were at a record high. El Ni√±o is already exacerbating the situation.\n\nThere is a 56 per cent chance that when the weather phenomenon is at peak strength, the Eastern-Pacific sea surface temperatures will be at least 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than normal, according to NOAA.\n\nWarmer water causes bleaching in coral reefs leaving them at greater risk of starvation.\n\nEl Ni√±o theatens reptiles on the Galapagos Islands\n\nWarming waters in the Pacific Ocean are threatening reptiles on the Galapagos Islands.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBlack marine iguanas, which are unique to the Ecuadorian archipelago, have adapted to find their main food source - algae - in the surrounding waters.\n\nBut rising temperatures means less algae and a possible risk of starvation for the creatures.\n\nHeavy rains are also imperilling the islands' turtle population by flooding their nests, which reduces reproduction."
