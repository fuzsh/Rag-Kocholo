But you can find Virginia Fout meticulously selecting floral arrangements one moment, organizing haute cuisine delight for 500 in another and the next, climbing scaffolding with cable cords to perfect an audio-visual moment. She brings a blend of both stylistic chic and no nonsense sensibility to V Productions, ultimately delivering clients around the globe customized and unprecedented event planning and production results. And while her talents are dichotomous, they are each sublime. For her range of expertise across the glamorous to the gritty, Fout credits her equestrian upbringing. When she wasn't mentally redesigning the cotillion entryway, Fout could be found sweeping stables, building fences and riding her beloved breed. But life in Middleburg, Virginia was all neigh, so with her imaginative aptitude, an art diploma and a mensa degree in organization, Fout traveled west to perfect her skills. Years with CNET, the technology information powerhouse, E! Entertainment Television, Columbia TriStar and Vivendi Universal, left Fout with a keen understanding that in this information age, design, imagery, sponsors and machinery must intersect. And after hundreds of transformative corporate and product events, dozens of dazzling media and launch tours, thousands of locations scouted and draped, and calories of hors devours sampled, she formed V Productions with the goal of energizing the events market. Since 2003 Fout has reinvigorated the annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Oscar Party, movie premiere parties for Warner Bros. Pictures, product launch events for Vivendi Universal Games, and even planned her own wedding. To each job she brings her enviable rolodex, filled with her beloved vendors from talent wranglers, designers, lighting experts, florists and caterers to ice sculpture creators, scenic artists, crane and truck operators and secret service detail. With her no job is too small, or too big attitude, Fout approaches each event with pride and care, and integrates each client's distinct need into her planning. Her diligence, passion and combination of artistry and adulation for the joy of celebrating, presenting and just getting it done, have made her one of the most sought after event producers in the public and private sector. .\n\nGeorge Meyer\n\nGeorge Meyer was born in 1940 in Switzerland.\n\nIn 1951, his family, with four young children , emigrated to Montreal Canada.\n\nIn his early twenties he spent three years in Zurich Switzerland, working for Swissair.\n\nNext was a move to California to rejoin his family, go to college, and \"make something of himself\".
