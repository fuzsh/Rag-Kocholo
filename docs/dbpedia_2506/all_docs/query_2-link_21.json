        "text": "WELCOME TO THE ITALIADOLLS CATTERY\n\nMy name is Nina and a few years ago after the death of my mother’s dog, who I had lived with for nineteen years (it had been taken from Italy to Poland) I decided to give her another pet as a present. This time I chose a cat (so she didn’t have to take it out several times a day) I had been a dog lover for years and knew nothing about the world of cats. I began to research online by writing the strange sentence “I am looking for a cat like a dog” and the result of my search was “Ragdoll”. This breed was highly praised I wondered what it was. The unusual name Ragdoll, which is a typical old-fashioned toy had been given to the breed for a reason.\n\nI began to understand that this beautiful breed had been selected for its character, the only cat in the world with these three features:\n\nThe Ragdoll is the only breed of cat in the world which is allowed for pet therapy. Used for people of all ages with mental and physical problems.\n\nThe Ragdoll when held, relaxes completely in a trusting manner just like a ragdoll.\n\nThe Ragdoll becomes attached to its human companions rather than to its territory (just like a dog) following you around the house in your daily routine.\n\nSome years have passed and my mother continues to live in Poland with her beloved Ragdoll, which was imported from a cattery in Italy. After hearing my mother talk about the unique character of her cat I began to study the breed more closely, becoming a friend of the prestigious Polish cattery PL*Ragissa.\n\nMy love for this breed pushed me to open my own small cattery with the Polish name (in honour of my origins) PL*Italiadolls which is based in my home in Reggio Emilia.\n\nMy cats are my absolute priority and part of my family. I decided to keep a small number of breeding cats so in this way I can give them all the necessary attention that a large cattery cannot. As I don’t have children I dedicate all my time to my cats, looking after their wellbeing and trying to develop their wonderful character, so different from other cats each one of them is like a child for me and I frequently prefer to spend money on them rather than myself.\n\nIn my case the word cattery is not really appropriate because my Ragdolls are a passion and a way of life !\n\nFor this reason I’ve joined several associations and breed clubs, both in Italy and in Poland in order to be voluntarily subjected to all the numerous ethical codes of conduct, which impose strict rules on the behavior of breeders and their cats, the new adoptive families and other breeders.\n\nCATTERY ITALIADOLLS BELONG TO:\n\nFIFE – FEDERATION INTERNAZIONALE FELINE (the biggest federation feline in the world which comprises 47 countries) / POLISH FELINE FEDERATION “FELIS POLONIA” / RAGDOLL CAT CLUB VICTORIA, ENFI (ENTE NAZIONALE FELINOTECNICA ITALIANA), RCCI (RAGDOLL CAT CLUB ITALY).\n\nThe intention of my breeding program is ambitious. I breed only the traditional colours, seal and blue in all their variations (mitted, point, bicolour) from prestigious, high level blood lines, concentrating on health, character and beauty. The kittens parents are from Nordic blood lines particularly German but also American. My cattery is a partner of the prestigious Polish cattery PL*Ragissa of Krakow. We believe that “a real Ragdoll” should be a healthy, beautiful animal, suitable for pet therapy and ready to follow its owner everywhere.\n\nWe try to breed kittens which are in top health, large, floppy and clumsy. These characteristics are difficult to find all together in one cat but are what make A REAL RAGDOLL !\n\nOur aim is to have really healthy kittens which are robust, sweet and floppy as we believe a real Ragdoll should be. The parents come from Germany, America, Russia and Finland.\n\nI pay great attention to the health of my cats and kittens. My cattery is completely free from genetic and viral diseases. Test are carried out on my animals in Australia, Italy and USA : HCM (Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), PKD (Polycystic Kidney Disease), MPS (Mucopolysaccharidosis), PRA ( Progressive Retinal Atrophy). Periodically tests are also carried out for : FELV and FIV.\n\nGenefast srl (Italy)\n\nI let my kittens go at 14-16 weeks and not before, I believe that only at this age are kittens able to socialise and have sufficiently developed their immune system to face the stress of moving to a new family.\n\nAll the kittens come with a FIFE pedigree which can be registered in any of the world associations.\n\nI DO NOT SUPPLY KITTENS WITHOUT A PEDIGREE.\n\nAs the Ragdoll is the perfect house cat, it’s important to regularly cut its claws. Claws should never be removed as this is cruel and banned by law. Removing the claws is like cutting off someone’s fingers!\n\nI DO NOT SELL MY KITTENS TO PET SHOPS.\n\nAvoid buying kittens from pet shops. The kitten could be illegally imported into Italy or come from uncertain cross-breeding. You will be told a lot of different things and may even be given a pedigree which will probably result as worthless to breeders and unclear in its information. What about its parents ? its genetic lineage ? where do you go for assistance ? the shop owner ? they are only intermediaries. A serious breeder never sells to a pet shop.\n\n– My cattery is not over crowded, there is a small number of cats who live in my home and are part of the family.\n\n– Litters are not produced all year round but only through very selective breeding. Suitable breeding partners are even chosen abroad.\n\n– The kittens leave their mother at three to four months having enjoyed as much attention and care as possible in order to have healthy animals with an excellent character and strong immune system.\n\n– The kittens leave the cattery with a document of health showing vaccinations and worming have been done.\n\n– In the sales contract there is a health guarantee.\n\n– My cattery can always be contacted for assistance by the new owners at any time.\n\n– Kittens are sold exclusively to serious and caring clients.\n\nHELP US COMBAT THE ILLEGAL BUSINESS OF FAKE BREEDERS.\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF STERILISATION\n\nAs the Ragdoll is the perfect house cat, it should be neutered for its health, its psychological well being and for the love and respect that we have for it. Does that seem strange ? in fact it is absolutely true. It would be “against nature” not to sterilise.\n\nThe non sterilised Ragdoll is difficult to manage and the testosterone charged male becomes agitated and aggressive, marking his territory by spraying. In the home it is impossible to get rid of this smell. The male becomes thin and subject to urinary and kidney problems, moreover its unique character which is recognised worldwide will be compromised.\n\nThe female will come into season regularly becoming noisy and marking her territory with faeces. She may become subject to uterine infections and mammary tumours.\n\nChoosing not to neuter a house cat means making it suffer ! IT IS SIMPLY CRUEL.\n\nNeutering prevents serious illness and is done for the love and wellbeing of the animal.\n\nIt is not natural for a cat which is not neutered not to be able to follow it’s natural instincts. IT GOES AGAINST NATURE !\n\nIt is a mistake to think of animal sexuality in the same way as human, a cat which is not neutered will only be happy if it is allowed to adequately conduct it’s reproductive cycle otherwise it will become depressed, frustrated and unhappy as well as being exposed to various diseases. The neutered cat on the other hand, will be an eternal kitten full of joy and in search of affection and attention.\n\nHealthy Ragdoll = Happy Ragdoll = Happy owner\n\nSterilisation can be done at an early age or by the date stated on the sales contract. The operation can be carried out in microsurgery and the kitten can return to normal the same day without trauma or post operative problems. Research has shown that the growth of neutered kittens is the same as any other cat."
