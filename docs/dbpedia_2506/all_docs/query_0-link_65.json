        "text": "Chianina are large, strong cattle. The genetic legacy of selective breeding since the Bronze age has expressed itself in a breed of cattle that is heavily muscled with long legs and hard hooves, giving them an ease and beauty of movement, along with endurance and a calm disposition.They are the tallest and heaviest of all breeds of domesticated cattle. Mature bulls reach between 1.7 to 2 metres in height and often exceed 1600kg. Whilst cows can reach 1.7 metres and commonly weigh between 800 to 900 kg. Calves weigh between 45 and 50 kg at birth. The breed varies only slightly in colour, normally porcelain white, sometimes to steel grey. Bulls are often darker grey around the head and shoulders. The skin of Chianina is pigmented black, as is the tongue, palate, nose, eye area and switch.They have short forward curving horns, black in younger animals, but becoming lighter as they mature.The most notable characteristic of the breed is the extensive and well-defined muscling from the shoulder and back to the well-formed rear.An interesting fact of the breed is that the calves are born a light fawn colour and gradually turn white over the first few months. The newborn calves are narrow shouldered and have fine small heads, thus making the birth process much easier than other breeds.\n\nChianina growth rate may exceed 2 kg per day.\n\nIdeal slaughter weight is reached between 16 to 18 months of age.\n\nCarcass yield is 65 %, of high quality beef, having the lowest cholesterol (53mg/100kg) and highest protein (20 % or greater) of any European breed of cattle.\n\nChianina beef is renowned for its lean, dark red and marbled cuts.\n\nChianina beef frequently sells at a 40 % premium to other continental breeds.\n\nThe full potential of the Chianina comes into its own with the breeds unique ability to contribute growth rate, muscling, high quality lean beef and environmental tolerance to progeny when crossed with other breeds.\n\nBeing such an old and pure breed the hybrid vigour is second to none.\n\nChianina Advantages;\n\n- hybrid vigour\n\n- heat and cold tolerance\n\n- insect and disease resistant\n\n- ease of calving\n\n- well defined muscling and lean but marbled meat\n\n- an overall tough, hardy and fast growing animal.\n\n- hybrid vigour is particularly well pronounced with both Bos Indicus and British breeds."
