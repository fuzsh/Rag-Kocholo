        "text": "Devon, PA – Tuesday, September 26, 2023 – The 2023 edition of Dressage at Devon presented by Kingsview Partners got off to a great start this morning with the Breed Division, which will be held over the course of three days, continuing through Thursday, September 28th. A USEF Heritage Event and the first FEI World Cup Qualifier of the qualifying year, Dressage at Devon welcomes top riders, horses, and judges from around the nation and across the globe to compete in both the Breed and Performance Divisions. Following the Breed Division, the Performance Division will kick off on Friday, September 29th. Throughout the competition, Dressage at Devon is proud to offer countless Educational and Specialty Events. The energy in the air at the Devon Horse Show Grounds is palpable, and the magical experience at Dressage at Devon is enjoyed by spectators and competitors alike.\n\nDressage at Devon is one of the largest dressage-based open-breed shows in the world. Opening day of the Breed Division welcomed the Individual Breed Classes (IBC), featuring the many breeds seen competing throughout the levels in Dressage today. From Hanoverian’s, to Highland Ponies, to Thoroughbreds, to Oldenburgs, the IBC’s give each breed a chance to take center stage and compete against horses of their same breed. Upon completion of the IBC’s, the winners of each breed were invited to receive their tri-color honors in the Parade of Breeds sponsored by Select Breeders Services.\n\nDressage at Devon Parade of Breeds 2023 – Photo Credit: Olivia Airhart, Mane Source Media, LLC for Phelps Media Group\n\nIBC: ISR-Oldenburg- Sponsored by the ISR-Oldenburg Registry North America\n\nWinner: Gail Zambor & Everglow\n\n2022 Filly By Everdale, Owned by Nicholsen Hansen, Bred by Nicholsen Hansen\n\nPhoto Credit: Olivia Airhart, Mane Source Media, LLC for Phelps Media Group\n\nIBC: Hanoverian- Sponsored by American Hanoverian Society\n\nWinner: Anna Crane & Downtown HU\n\n2019 Gelding By Dacaprio × Pik L, Owned by Anna Crane, Bred by Horses Unlimited\n\nPhoto Credit: Olivia Airhart, Mane Source Media, LLC for Phelps Media Group\n\nIBC: Oldenburg (GOV) – Sponsored by Oldenburg Horse Breeders Society, N.A.
