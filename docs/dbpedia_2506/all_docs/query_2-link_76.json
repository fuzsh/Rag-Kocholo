He carries some really precious and unique lines in his pedigree, among them is 1 World winner and 2 European winners! He himself impressed with his big size (61 cm and super bone).\n\nBoth parents are beautiful, strong, sound and have wonderful, brave and loving temperaments!\n\nMore about the litter: https://windylands.eu/breeding_Z%20litter.htm\n\nPuppies:\n\nSPECIALITY SHOW ITALY WITH VALERIE GEDDES\n\nWe attended a truly wonderful and important event – Italian collie club 100s anniversary speciality show! The judge was the great Valerie Geddess, a collie breeder of 50+ years and in my eyes one of the biggest legends of collies world (kennel Ingleden). When I heard she would be judging I knew I needed to come to ask for her opinion of my collies! And it made me so happy listening to a wonderful description of my heart girl Lani (vet ww Beyond Limits of the Windy Lands) and winning BOS VETERAN in a line-up of truly quality and famous veteran females, BEST VETERAN and finally BIS VETERAN! There were 72 rough collies and 13 smooth collies entered! Winning that under such a renewed judge is just as important as winning world winner title with her! And most of all – we had the most fun in the ring together, Lani just loves showing herself!\n\nThere were two more collies that made me so proud at the speciality show yesterday – our gorgeous Gaia (multi CH Gaia Earth Goddess of the Windy Lands), who won a strong champion class, presented perfectly by her awesome owner Alberto Celestini. Watching their performance in the ring is real joy!\n\nI also couldn’t be prouder of our super duo – Tilen and Nera (CH Belladona Windy Lingonskogen). It was only their third time together in a ring and they presented themselves like pros again! In a huge competition of 14 beautiful collie females, they were shortlisted among 6 best ones, who got excellent grade. Nera also got a truly beautiful description by the judge Valerie Geddess and that means the world to me. She has just turned two and is in her summer dress, so I am sure that is just a start for them:)\n\nWINDY LANDS SPRING FAMILY GATHERING\n\nWonderful sunny day in spent with my beloved collies at the Slovenian Intermittent Lake Cerknica ♥\n\nA big group of 22 collies, from 2 months to 13 years of age\n\nFrom left:\n\nKai (Lingoskogen Windy B litter- 2 years old) with his friends As\n\nSisters Klea and Kari from X litter (1 year old)\n\nOur Nera (Lingoskogen Windy B litter- 2 years old)\n\nVoyo (V litter, 2 years old)\n\nDream (B litter, 9 years old, sister to our veteran world winner Lani )\n\nPrince (G litter, 6 years old)\n\nDenis’s gang – our babies from Y litter – Yosh, Yasmine and Yumy, their granny Mea (E litter, 8 years old) and auntie Perli (P litter, 3 years old)\n\nApollo (son of our Neel, bred by Aljaž Tratnik , 5 years old)\n\nWinn (W litter, 1 years old) and his mum Daisy (daughter of our Kai, bred by Lada Kostioutchenko , 5 years old)\n\nPai (C litter, 9 years old) and her mum Mei (A litter), the oldest member of our gathering, still in great shape at 13 years!\n\nRomeo (R litter, 3 years old)\n\nThe smooth gang at the far right – Stella (T litter, 2 years old) and her friend Libby\n\nLANI – VETERAN WORLD WINNER!!!\n\nMy heart girl Lani – JCH, multi CH, CIB, multi vet CH, vet CIB, Top collie 23′ BEYOND LIMITS OF THE WINDY LANDS has just became VETERAN WORLD WINNER ’24 under the respectable judge Sean Delmar!\n\nWow wow wow\n\nI decided to enter the show as it was in a nearby Zagreb and I saw it as a great opportunity to meet up with some friends from around the world and to see some of the collie legends in flesh. I only expected to go there and have some fun with my lovely Lani in the ring….and what a big surprise was winning a big and strong class of quality and famous veteran females and becoming vet WW!\n\nMy partner Tilen and Nera (CH Belladonna Windy Lingonskogen) did me so proud at the WDS as well!

However, sadly, the litter was born 3 days too early (according to progesterone testing) and they were all incredibly small, from 90 to 180 gr. We lost 3 right away and we had 4 strong fighters. The smallest, Yvette, was fighting for 3 weeks and just when Denis and me thought we were out of the woods, she passed away in his arms. It was incredibly hard on us, and especially on Denis, who had been feeding her day and night, every 2 hours…so we needed a moment to grieve before we could post the story. Being a breeder can really be a hard and sad experience and in such moment, it is hard to gain strength to continue. I admire Denis, he had been through so many losses, but he always comes back, stronger and more dedicated!\n\nSo now we can present you the 3 fighters from our Y litter, who are now big, strong, healthy and incredibly adorable. At 4 weeks they are already very active, sweet and a little bit naughty. They will help us heal our broken hearts! Here are our strong boy Yosh and the two beautiful sisters, Yasmine and Yumi\n\nNEW MILESTONE – WINDY LANDS HAS BECOME A FAMILY KENNEL / WINDY LANDS JE POSTALA DRUŽINSKA PSARNA\n\nWith 2024, my life partner, Tilen Vodlan, has joined us and has become an official co owner of our Windy Lands kennel. So from now on, we have a family breeding ♥\n\n_ _ _\n\nZ letom 2024 je moj življenjski partner, Tilen Vodlan, postal uradni solastnik naše psarne. Od letos bo Windy Lands tako postala družinska vzreja ♥\n\nLANI IS TOP ROUGH COLLIE OF 2023\n\nMy heart girl Lani has had one hell of a show season, winning many BOB, BOG and BIS placings, putting her on top of Slovenian Rough collies as well as n#4 of all Slovenian herding breeds!

How can you describe everything you have lived and experienced together? How can you put 15 years in a few sentences?\n\nSky is the reason my life took a completely different turn, she set me on a truly wonderful journey of breeding and showing, through her I have met so many wonderful new friends and fellow breeders, I have travelled all over Europe and beyond for shows, matings, puppy visits.. I have countless beautiful, wonderful, amazing memories with her that will keep her alive in my heart forever!\n\nOn one of her early shows, she was judged by Eva Eriksson and her words were: ‘You own a Star, she will be a Legend some day’. Sky was never a big show star (she gained a few champion titles and the judges really admired her beauty but she was much more of an agility, Frisbee, sheepdog dog), but she is a start of my incredible line of Windy Lands collies, all our litters go back to her Sky herself had 2 litters, our first two litters, and from them, Windy Lands collies have spread all around the world! She set a very high standard for me – I want her amazing, active, loving character, she was the smartest dog I have ever known! I hope she is passing on her incredible health – even on her deathbed at 15, her blood and organs were all still healthy and in great condition, but sadly, she suffered a stroke. And of course, her beauty – her colour, dignity and her expression were something out of a dream. She still visits me in my dreams and I am hoping she will continue to do so for a long time! I see so much of her in her granddaughter, my Lumi – she has her looks, her mimic, her character – and I am so grateful for that. Together with her mum Lani they are in a great consolation to me in this tragic period. Life will never be the same without our queen and pain will never truly go away, however I do try to focus and be grateful for all the happy years she has given us and the amazing legacy she left behind – my BLUE PEARL\n\n‘You loved me without words\n\nYou hugged me without arms\n\nYou were there without it having to be earned\n\nAs long as by the end of the day I returned\n\nYou waited for me behind the door\n\nAlways happy to see me\n\nAs if I was someone you’d always adore\n\nA bit of attention is all you ever asked for\n\nAnd I’d gladly give you my affection\n\nWe had such a strong connection\n\nAnd having you by my side\n\nAlways gave me a sense of protection\n\nIn you I could always confide\n\nLying next to me is how you replied\n\nMy hands petting your fur\n\nIn our own little bubble we were\n\nYour cuddles were always the best\n\nBut now you reached a state of eternal rest\n\nNot having you around anymore\n\nIs leaving a big scar\n\nAnd I don’t know where you are\n\nBut I will forever love you from afar.’\n\n(anonymous)\n\nWINDY LANDS X LITTER\n\nWindy Lands X litter was born on 5.5.2023 ♥\n\nThere were 3 triko girls, 1 blue merle girl, 2 blue merle boys\n\nRECOGNITION OF MY BREEDING\n\nThis year we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of our club – KLUB 1 and I was so happy and honoured to receive the diploma from our Club issued by Slovenian Cynological Association for my work as a breeder of rough collies. Last 12 years haven’t been easy, there have been many ups and downs, many tears shed and I even wanted to give up a few times, but the passion for the breed is so strong that it drives me forward despite the obstacles. I could never have done what I do without the support of some close friends who are there for me through thick and thin – you know who you are And of course, with the help of my many amazing co-breeders and my puppies’ owners. Thank you to our president Lidija Okleščen for seeing the value in my breeding and for all the advice at the beginning of my breeding career!\n\nAs a part of the celebration, my darling Lumi (CH Windy Lands Quite Exquisite) received the FCI group1 #5 Top dog award for 2022, being best rough collie of last year. This means so much to me as I absolutely love flying in the ring with her! When I started with her granny Sky 15 years ago, it was not an easy start – I was young, inexperienced and not very self-confident and it really wasn’t simple for the two of us. But in the last 12 years of my breeding, we have made over 30 champions and I am very proud that we always handle our dogs ourselves. I have grown so much as a person in these years and I am really happy I can live my dream with my collies and with all the wonderful friends I have met along the way!\n\nSPRING SHOW SUCCESS\n\nAfter a little break, our wonderful Neel came back in a ring with a bang yesterday! He not only won CC, CACIB, BEST MALE and BOB at IDS Varaždin in a strong competition, under Colombian judge Juan Alberto Grillo Londono, but he also finished his INTERNATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP!\n\nI adore this big teddy bear, he is the kindest, gentlest and most loving boy who is also bomb proof – a character you can only wish in a collie. I adore his size (61 cm) and bone, he has the dreamiest blue colour that shines from afar, and he passes it on onto his offsprings. He has sired three wonderful litters (at Aljaž Tratnik, Slovenia, at Sandra Cerjak – Darsanian, Croatia and at Joanne Kirisits, Austria https://windylands.eu/Neel-offsprings.htm ) and I am hoping he can have some more, before he becomes too old.\n\nNeel has been very successful at shows and he can be proud of his many ch titles:\n\nDANISH JCH, DANISH JUNIOR CLUB WINNER, DANISH CH, SLOVENIAN CH, BOSNIAN CH, CROATIAN CH, INTERNATIONAL CH. He is also multi CACIB and BOB winner.\n\nIn June we had a very special weekend in Umag, Croatia. For the first time, I showed my two heart girls together – mum Lani and her daughter Lumi! What a sweet experience! Lumi both days and today also her mummy joined us. Both girls showed trully wonderfully for me, flying in a ring and standing like real pros!\n\nLumi won 2 EX1, 2 CC AND 2 rCACIBS, that’s her 3rd CC in a row and she now only needs one more CC to finish also her Croatian CH.\n\nLani was shown in a veteran class for the first time and the judge was impressed by her beauty, great condition and flawless movement. She won BOS VETERAN, VETERAN CACIB, BOB VETERAN and was shortlisted in BIS veteran out of a really numerous group of Veterans.\n\nThank you to the Italian judges CLAUDIO DE GIULIANI and ALESSANDRO ZEPPI for truly beautiful critiques of my girls!\n\nWINDY LANDS W LITTER – 7 weeks\n\nWINDY LANDS W LITTER\n\nWindy Lands W litter was born on 10.3.2023 ♥\n\nWe have 3 blue merle boys, 1 blue merle girl, 1 trikolor boy, 2 trikolor girls\n\ninfo: windylands @ gmail.com\n\n_ _ _\n\nImamo mladičke, rojene 10.3.2023.

Still a day does not go by without me thinking about her and missing her but I am also grateful for the 10 years together that we had against all odds with Lia being born so small and with so many health issues. My first litter was a big struggle and I wasn’t sure I wanted to continue being a breeder….but then I found strength I am now very happy that I continued this path. It’s not easy and there have been a lot of heartbreaks and tears, but also many wonderful, happy moments and so many fantastic people met over the years!\n\nThe rest of the litter are all still going strong and are all loved by their families. Damon is enjoying his retirement in Finland, after siring 21 litters (one of them is a smooth one) and achieving many ch titles and important show wins.\n\nMei, the mum of our C and E litters, is also loving her retirement at our coast, spending a lot of time by the beach. My co-breeder Denis is continuing her line with his part of Windy Lands team! Also Mei was a very successful representative of this litter at shows, winning a few ch titles.\n\nOur boys, Tai and Messi, have lived in loving pet homes all their lives and are still adored and wonderfully taken care by their families. Messi has become an older brother to his 2 legged sibling, who he adores\n\nMy dear babies, your mum Sky and me wish you many more healthy years, we both love you very much!\n\nOUR QUEEN IS 14 YEARS OLD ♥\n\nSky\n\nI am so grateful she is still with us, beautiful as ever and still healthy and fit!\n\nThis whole adventure started with her 14 years ago…the world of shows and breeding, now also dog training and grooming. She changed my life for the better and helped me find my purpuse!\n\nShe has formed an amazing line through her many many offsprings in Slovenia and around the world. I am so happy to see the photos of her kids, grandkids, greatgrandkids…\n\nSky herself is enjoying her retirenment in our home, loved and adored by us all. She gets many cuddles, daily walks, treats and she still loooves her food We are hoping we have quite a few more healthy years ahead of us! She is the guardian and best friend of her daughter Lani and great daughter Lumi, who reminds me a lot of Sky. I am truly blessed to have this amazing girl in my life!\n\nHappy birthday my wonderful Blue Pearl!\n\nSPECIALITY SHOW 2022\n\nOur Lumi (Windy Lands Quite Exquisite) rocked the show ring again!

Sadly, at 8 weeks, the two girls died, the tiny Vicky due to developmental issues and our wonderful Venus died due to a very tragical accident and this really broke our hearts as she was perfectly healthy and so so beautiful, with a wonderful character! The co breeder Denis and myself will need a little break from breeding after that:’\n\nSIRE: Yaknee Blue Mountains Slash\n\nDAM: Windy Lands Endless Love\n\nRIP our wonderful girls ♥\n\nSUMMER SHOW SUCCESS\n\nLumi, Tristan and Prince were shown at IDS Umag under the judge Nenad Andrić, all three becoming champions!\n\nWL Quite Exquisite – Lumi, jcc, jbob – new cro jch\n\nTuo Princpie Azzuro Dellamonade – Tristan j cc – new cro jch\n\nWL Gallant Night Prince – prince – cc – new cro ch\n\nTristan, Finn and Fame were shown at Bled and Postojna shows, all three becoming champions as well:)\n\nTuo Principe Azzuro Dellamonade – Finn – NDS Postojna (Kornelia Butrimova) – jcc, jbob, best male – new slo j ch\n\nWL Orlando Innmorato – Finn – IDS BLED (Frank Kane) – cc // NDS Postojna (Kornelia Butrimova) – cc // IDS Postojna (Sanja Vretenicic) – cc, best male, cacib – new Slo ch\n\nDarsanian Destination Fame at Windy Lands – Fame – NDS Postojna ( Kornelia Butrimova)- cc – new Slo ch\n\nI took Lumi to a speciality show in Zagreb, Croatia, and she showed her socks off as usually:)\n\nWL Quite Exquisite – Cro speciality show (Heidi Poschacher (A)) – jcc, jbob – Croatian speciality junior club ch\n\nHer sister Chloe (WL Quarantine Bliss) was shown in Sweden two times, winning 2 CCs and two times BEST BITCH and BOS!

Her nephew Rocky (WL Rather Magnificent) won a CC and BOS and little niece Tillie (WL Thrilling News with Icekeller) won puppy BOB and finished slo puppy hope title.\n\nLingonskogen B litter with Windy Lands\n\nI am very happy to present you this wonderful litter, bred by my dear friend Kia Seničar, kennel Lingonskogen, in collaboration with Windy Lands.\n\nWhen Kia was searching for a new show-breeding female, I suggested her Lunar Lakes litter, as they were having puppies from Big Ben, the dog I have been admiring ever since I saw him win eu junior title in Slovenia, over 10 years ago. Tanna has proven herself to be not only beautiful, but a wonderful, loving companion and a successful showgirl. Later, Kia and I searched for a male that would complete Tanna and we went on a trip to Tuscany together to have a date with the handsome Tom – Beldones Tom Wood, a dog who does not charm only with his beautiful looks but also with his loving and charming nature. Thank you dear Roberto for entrusting him to us! And kennel Beldones to send him to Italy, so we were able to use him.\n\nWe are more than thrilled with the result of this mating – we got 4 absolutely gorgeous puppies (3 boys and 1 girl). Born big, strong and lively at almost 400 grams! Later they moved at Windy Lands where they have had a very happy childhood:)\n\nUC CH Beldones Tom Wood x jCH Lunar Lakes Primadonna\n\ndob: 2.5.2022\n\nAll are DM NN and CEA/PRA/KAT clinically free\n\nbreeder: Kia Seničar & Mojca Furlan\n\nUNIQUE – U LITTER\n\nOur princess is here – and she is perfect!\n\nAfter a very difficult delivery that ended with the middle of the night emergency vet visit, our little blue jewel was born safely at the vet office (just minutes before they would start prepping mum for the cesarean). Having singletons comes with many complications (I surely have tons of experience with that) and we are so grateful we could welcome this precious baby safely into the world!\n\nWelcome little Unique – Windy Lands Uniquely Dressed. My Lani’s first granddaughter and the 3rd generation of my wonderful blues! Her mum Lainie is a wonderful, calm and very loving mum. Together with family Krstinc they are taking a great care of the little one.\n\nThank you to Jozsef for giving us the beautiful Neon who shines with his amazing blue colour and for helping make this miracle possible. Little one seems to be a perfect mix of her wonderful parents and we are hoping she continues to grow healthily and brings her mum Lainie and her human family lots of joy!\n\nWINDY GIRLS\n\nI am so blessed to be able to share my life with these three gorgeous collie girls – granny Sky, who has taught me so much about life and with whom this whole journey started She has given me two wonderful litters and with that a very strong, beautiful and precious line. Sky is the smartest collie I know and she is still going strong at 13,5!\n\nHer daughter Lani, my heart dog who absolutely adores me and with whom we’ve had many many wonderful adventures together so far. She has been very succesful at shows and helped me start loving them and to recover from my shows ‘stage fright’ and has given me three very precious litters She is now retired from the whelping box but we shall hit the how ring again soon\n\nAnd our youngest one, the granddaughter Lumi, our new show star, the most loving and gentle collie I know! Everything we do together is pure joy! She is proving to be my second heart dog – I am forming a very strong bond with her as well and falling in love with her deeper every day! I am so happy I decided to keep her last year – just like her mum Lani, she wasn’t planned, but was destined to share her life with me\n\nWe all still miss our little black beauty Lia, we feel she is looking over us from doggy heaven\n\nREVOLUTIONARY T LITTER\n\nEaster bunny has brough us an early Easter present – 6 little ‘bunnies’ from our T litter! This time we decided to do something special and experimental and we mated our Aida with a wonderful smooth collie Tin Tin.\n\nWhat was our goal? To widen the genetic diversity of Windy Lands line and to implement some qualities Tin Tin’s line has – the big size, fantastic character, excellent tail carriage, body, movement and to get the cea free gene from a different line.\n\nWe are thrilled with the result – we got 6 extremely strong, vivid and lively puppies (almost 400 gr each). We have 2 blue girls, 3 tricolour girls and one very beautiful blue prince. Their daddy Tin Tin carries the rough gene so all the pups might be rough collies, all are genetically cea carriers and dm non carriers.\n\nThis litter is made in collaboration with Aida’s owner Aljaž Tratnik and his partner Barbara Potočnik (kennel Icekeller). Thank you guys for believing in this match and taking a great care of the babies! And thanks to to Tin Tin’s owner Nina Zubrinic for all the help and support. Thank you also to our breeding comitee for allowing this to happen – it is first such litter in Slovenia. It will be very exciting watching them grow!\n\nQ LITTER IS 1 YEAR OLD\n\nHappy birthday to my most amazing baby girl Lumi, to her siblings Casper and Kiara in Slovenia and to Chloe and Caleb Quim in Sweden. Our Slovenian team are all already Slovenian junior champions at only 12 months of age and all three have been hip tested with excellent, AA hips!♥ This litter is proving to be one of my best ones and I couldn’t be prouder of them ♥\n\nSPRING SHOW SUCCESS\n\nWe started our Spring show round at IDS Vrtojba and my superstar Lumi (WL Quite Equisite) surprised me with winning BEST OF BREED over a big entry of champion dogs under the honorable judge DENIS KUZELJ. After that she won three more BEST OF BREED, so 4 in a row – two at NDS Bale (Croatia) under Nives Medunjanin and Zlatko Kraljič and one at IDS Maribor, under a very strick judge Nikola Smolič.

I am hoping Lia is watching over us from Heaven and is having a big party there with all the special dogs that left us, including her niece Maya.\n\nA litter puppy album: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151116302455593&type=3\n\nI had a little party of my A litter and the line down from it this summer. We had no clue Lia and Maya would leave us later on, so this picture memory is a very precious and dear to me.\n\nOn a brighter note, I am very proud of all I have achieved in these 10 years…many many champions, 17 litters here and in co own with the help of my wonderful friends, I have made many families happy with my beautiful puppies and most of all I have met a few truly incredible people who have become very dear friends of mine! A special thank you to my closest friend and mentor Katarina Petrič, who was there helping me when my A litter was born and has been by my side ever since!\n\nI am especially happy to have my three blue princesses at home, 3 amazing generations of blue girls who fill my heart with joy and happiness every day. I share a special bond with each and every one of them! Sky is our granny, with who I share so many wonderful memories and this amazing journey started with her. Lani is my heart dog, she lives and breathes for me and we are so incredibly close to each other! And little Lumi is truly everything I have ever dreamt of, a copy of her mummy, but an even cheekier, cuddlier and fluffier version! We all miss Lia but we are so grateful to still have each other and hope it stays that way for many more years!\n\nMERRY CHRISTMAS FROM WINDY LANDS\n\n“May all that is beautiful, meaningful and brings you joy be yours this holiday season and throughout the coming year!”Merry Christmas from me, our youngest sweety Lumi and the rest of Windy Lands family\n\nGOODBYE MY MIRACLE GIRL LIA ♥\n\nIt’s so hard to find words to write this\n\nMy little Lia, our miracle girl, closed her eyes forever last Friday. I needed a little time for myself before I was able to post this. She left us so suddenly and unexpectedly! She was fine on Thursday and fell asleep in my arms on Friday, surrounded also by my sisters Ana and Jasna. Both were there, helping me save her 10 years ago, when she was a tiny fragile baby and they were there for me and her also now, when her life journey came to an end.\n\nOur fierce fighter Lia fought all the obstacles life threw at her bravely and with a smile on her face until the very last day. She really knew how to enjoy live and every single day she was showing me how grateful she was to me for giving her a chance when she was a tiny tiny little babygirl.Lia was from my very first litter, when I was still a very young breeder. She was born miniature and not fully developed, so we had to tube feed her and later do a few operations to enable her to have a normal life. Due to all complications, she stayed quite little and puppy-like. When she was 2, she was run over by a car and her lungs collapsed..it was another little miracle she survived that against all odds! She really had the strongest will to live! She had some issues with environmental allergies (as her immune system was compromised, not receiving any colostrum at birth), but we later found solutions in more natural ways of living and feeding and she lived a happy and quality life! At a start no vet could ever imagine this poor tiny baby would live for long, but she would celebrate her tenth birthday in a month!\n\nFrom the breeding point of view, it wasn’t the smartest thing to do, keeping her, as she was ‘taking a space’ of some healthy girl who I could breed with…but Lia was our beloved family member, my parent’s favourite one and she had a very special and dear place in my heart and we shared such a strong bond. If I wanted to keep her and also continue breeding, I had to find other ways. So now I mostly have collies in co-ownerships. Thanks to Lia, I managed to build a wide network of Windy Lands collies with my wonderful co-breeders! And Lia was an amazing puppy sitter to all the puppies born here, she stayed very puppy like also in her character and always loved to play with her little friends\n\nWe are heartbroken and miss her terribly, but we are also grateful for the ten years we got to have this amazing, sweet and strong baby girl in our life.

She wasn’t planned to stay but I just fell in love with her. She combines the beauty of her granny Sky with bravery and openness of her mum Lani. So here is our new babygirl Lumi – Windy Lands Quite Exquisite. She was first called Kim, but since I was saving my favourite name Lumi for my next puppy, I now gave her that name\n\nWe have big plans for our beautiful happy girl and we really enjoy her company. In this sad period she gives us all a reason to smile!\n\nHere is little Lumi (4m) pictured with her granny Sky (12,5), mum Lani (6,5) and auntie Lia (9,5).\n\nRUN FREE MAYA\n\nMaya – Majestic Amber Flame of the Windy Lands\n\n13.12.2019 – 13.8.2021\n\nFriday 13th brought you to us and Friday 13th took you away from us\n\nMaya’s co-breeder Denis Kogovšek and me are heartbroken because sweet Maya was taken from us way too early. One of the hardest experiences of being a breeder that makes you question your path and test your strength! Maya was the gentlest and sweetest of the litter and visually what I dreamt of getting from this combination of her parents, Mea and Winston. She spent first two months with Denis, so this is especially hard for him. It seemed she was destined for her new mummy Neža and her family, she felt at home with them right from a start and helped them get over the loss of their previous collie. She brought love and sunshine back into their lives. She was there by little Mia’s side, guarding her growing up and she loved their new baby boy Sven right away. She was growing up with her collie cousin Apollo, who, like all of us, is now lost without her.\n\nSome beings are just too precious so we get to have them for only a little time..but we are all grateful we got to meet this amazing sunshine girl and got to spend some wonderful moments with her. She is now an angel, looking over her family and running free with their previous collie Gea Our hearts are aching for Maya’s family! They did everything they possibly could to save her and she was fighting till the last day, but nature has its own, sometimes very cruel ways. Maya died of leptospirosis\n\nMaya will live in our hearts forever\n\nSUCCESS AT ISTRA SHOWS\n\nTwo very successful and fun days at Istra Show weekend in great company of my lovely dogs and my wonderful friends. On Friday I showed my Q litter siblings Chloe (Windy Lands Quarantine Bliss) and Caleb (Windy Lands Quest of Grandeur) for the first time, before them leaving for their new home abroad…both were so wonderful, showing beautifully for me. Happy, relaxed, playful, loving the new experience and cuddles from all of their admirers. Caleb won bos minor puppy and Chloe was a real star, winning the heart of a very nice Slovenian judge Tadej Nagode by swamping him with kisses on the entrance of the ring and winning bos minor puppy and bob minor puppy. Chloe’s new mummy was there cheering for her and I was so happy that she did so well and made us both proud!The big star of the weekend was my handsome boy Dancer (jCH Darsanian Dance to the Top at Windy Lands). I almost didn’t enter him as he is in a complete summer dress, but he won CC, CACIB and best male both days, becoming ISTRA WINNER 2021 and topping his wonderful results by winning also BEST OF BREED over a big entry of collies on Friday. Thank you to Tadej Nagode for giving him BOB and Anna Kochan for awarding him BOS. Big congrats to his breeder, Sandra Cerjak!Thank you for my wonderful friends (co owners and co breeders) for being there, supporting us and cheering for us and making this weekend even more fun Congrats to the organizers for organizing such a lovely show!\n\nL and O litters celebrating\n\nHappy birthday to a very special litter, my L litter..they were born right here at Windy Lands so they are especially precious to me Babies of my heartgirl Lani and of the late Ben who we send kisses to in heaven!Half brothers and sister to my current Q litter and to Neo, the daddy of this year’s R litter.

She won JUNIOR CC and JUNIOR BOB.\n\nMea – Endless Love of the Windy Lands was shown today for the first time after her last litter and got a CC from CH class and has now become a new SLOVENIAN CHAMPION.\n\nFame – Darsanian Destination Fame at Windy Lands and her brother Dancer – Darsanian Dance to the Top at Windy Lands (children of our Lina – CH Dream in Blue of the Windy Lands) were both shown in junior class and both became SLOVENIAN JUNIOR CHAMPIONS.\n\nThe big star of the weekend was our wonderful little prince Tristan – Tuo Principe Azzuro Dellamonade (co owned with Katarina Petrič) who was shown in minor puppy class and rocked his socks off, winning three times BOS puppy, BOB puppy, BOG puppy and twice BIS3 and once risBIS minor puppy of show. With that he has earned the title ‘NEW SLOVENE HOPE’Thank you to all the owners and friends for all the help and for the great time we spent together, despite the rain and storms:) What a wonderful come back for Windy Lands team\n\nQ LITTER IS 3 MONTHS OLD ♥\n\nWELCOME, TRISTAN\n\nOur PRINCE is here! And he is even more charming than we ever dared dreaming he would be!\n\nTristan is so very special and dear to me not only because he is visually amazing with the most wonderful sweet expression, truly perfect blue merle colour, great shape and movement for such a young age and the most loving, gentle and brave character (he came out of a van after a day trip wagging his tail and kissing us)…but also because of his very precious pedigree.\n\nI think you all remember my special puppy Joy..it was a very difficult experience and I was devastated I could never have anything after her. But then I saw this little puppy, whose grandpa is Joy’s daddy One..And when I saw his first picture at 3 weeks, my heart stopped…I knew I would do anything to get that special little jewel! He didn’t only remind me of Joy, but also of Star, another sad story in my breeding…But now that Tristan is here, that wound can finally heal!\n\nAfter seeing the picture on Fabio’s wall, I contacted my friend Katarina, with whom I started my breeding adventure 12 years ago and who has been there for me through all the good and all the difficult and I am really grateful to have such an amazing friend in my life Also Katarina tried having a litter from One many years ago and has always been sorry that it wasn’t meant to be. So when I told her my wish she enthusiastically agreed to buy that puppy together and bring him to Slovenia. We are both eternally grateful to his breeder Fabio Serra and Ileana Sedda for entrusting this little gem to us! We will try to make you proud\n\nThis would never have been possible without the help of two other dear friends – Denis Kogovšek and Jana Ferfolja, so a big thank you to them as well for supporting us in this crazy adventure\n\nTristan – Tuo Principe Azzuro Dellamonade\n\nSire: Bermarks Quite Big (Wicani Touch of Magic x Blomlane’s Blue Beauty)\n\nDam: NewHit Parade Blu Dellamonade (Uno Splendido Blue di Cambiano x Contessa Nera)\n\nDob: 8/3/2021\n\nco owned with Katarina Petrič, kennel Aydeen and Jana Ferfolja\n\nN litter 1st birthday\n\nHappy 1st birthday to our N litter – a very special litter, where both parents are Windy Lands breeding!\n\nCo bred with Jana Močnik, Stane Močnik and Kaja Močnik.\n\nHappy birthday to Windy Noel in Portugal, Nia in Belgium, Nash Monty in Lithuania and to Nal and Noa in Slovenia\n\nNEO’S FIRST LITTER – WINDY LANDS R LITTER\n\nI am so excited to share a truly wonderful news with you!\n\nOur stunning boy Neo (Flash N Thundershine of the Windy Lands), in my eyes the most beautiful blue I have ever bred, has become a daddy for the first time! The mummy is a black beauty Lina, owned by my good friend Aljaž Tratnik.\n\nAfter the ultrasound a month ago we were expecting three puppies…but Lina prepared an enormous surprise for us as she delivered not 3, but !!8!! puppies! And another surprise – all 8 are boys! I never had an all-boys litter before! But they are absolutely gorgeous, 5 are little perfect blue daddy’s boys and 3 are little trikolor momma’s boys.\n\nSo my special girl Lani is now a granny for the first time ♥\n\nQ LITTER IS BORN ♥\n\nEaster Bunny has been especially generous this yeas as he brough us 5 marvelous little babies this Easter\n\nProud mummy is my heartgirl Lani (multi Ch Beyond Limits of the Windy Lands) who proved to be the most amazing mum for the third time now. She is the easiest to mate, whelp and raise puppies, she is my true treasure and I am forever thankful to have her in my life\n\nThe wonderful daddy is Herceg, a truly beautiful and loving Hungarian male – Escoliar D’Oro Dinamit. I don’t like only him, but I truly admire his fantastic pedigree in which you can find the great World Youth 01′ & World winner 03′ & vice EU CH 04′ Rineweld Awantgarde at Sheewena, the handsome Ch. Nyitramenti Zinedine Zidane and the superb Brilyn Chance Again at Lynnswed. Thank you dear Krisztina Laszlo for all the help and for making this mating possible despite the strick Corona lockdowns and thank you my good friend Katarina Petrič for all the help and support.\n\nAll 5 puppies were born very big and healthy and they are gaining beautifully already.\n\nJOY’S SECOND BIRTHDAY AND 1ST ANNIVERSARY IN HER NEW HOME\n\nI can’t believe it’s already been a year since our most special puppy of all, our Joy, went to her new home to live with her amazing mummy Vanja. A year with Joy was the most difficult year in my breeding career, but also the most amazing…I have learn so much from her and I have received so much love from her that it made it all worth it. I will be forever grateful to Vanja for taking a really loving care of her and accepting her just the way she is. Joy has much better conditions with her that she did with me and that is why I entrusted her to Vanja, even though it was the hardest and most heartbreaking decision of my life. Joy is now a puppy sitter to all the puppies Vanja takes in (she works with a shelter AniMa – Animals Matter) I still miss her and I am very happy Vanja tells me about her, sends me pictures and lets me visit her. She also brought her on holidays with me last year Joy was two years old in the beginning on February, so I also want to wish her a very happy birthday and hope she has a lot of happy, healthy years ahead of her in her super home!\n\nEast Anglian Ca Online Christmas show\n\nSince we weren’t able to show our young hopes this year we decided to take part in East Anglian Ca Online Christmas show, mostly as they were raising money for a good cause and also because I admire the judges that were judging – Rainer Juhani Vuorinen (bitches), Tomas Rohlin (males) and John Blake (bob, bis).\n\nThe star of the show was our puppy hope Dancer (Darsanian Dance to the Top at Windy Lands), bred by Sandra Cerjak and owned by Jana Ferfolja and me. He won junior class, male puppy, best rough puppy, res best rough male, res BEST OF BREED and ended in style winning also BEST IN SHOW PUPPY and res BEST IN SHOW! Wow wow wow! That really made my day, especially because he was judged by the judges I trully admire. I can only hope he does so well at real shows! Thank you Thomas Rohlin for very lovely critiques!\n\nDenis Kogovšek and me entered also our young hope Mai (Marked by Moonlight) and he won the mid limit dog class.\n\nKatarina Petrič entered our Eros (Dashing Raven Knight) and he was 3rd in champion class.\n\nWe entered also the two sisters from our M litter (Winston x Mea) they both did very well, Melody – Midnight Melody of the Windy Lands was 3rd Novice Bitch and our rising star Maya – Majestic Amber Flame of the Windy Lands was 1st Junior Bitch! Melody is co-owned and co-bred by Denis Kogovšek and Maya in owned by Neža Rejc.\n\nWELCOME LITTE PERLI ♥\n\nA few months ago I was scrolling through facebook and I came across some photos of a wonderful blue merle collie that I was sure it was my Sky. My first thought was – who came here and took these photos of my girl without me knowing? Later I realised it wasn’t Sky but it was her exact male copy! I immediately wrote to the owner VM Maria and realised the wonderful collie in the pictures was a boy called Blue Marine. I checked the pedigree and was surprised they had no immediate relatives. Very soon I was on the way to Hungary to meet this blue wonder in person and I loved also his calm and loving personality. My dream was to mix Sky’s line with this handsome boy. Denis Kogovšek came with me to see him and I warmed him up to the idea of using Blue Marine for his beauty Mea’s next litter.\n\nToday Denis Kogovšek and me have the most wonderful news that we would like to share with you. On a very special date – 11.11. 2020, the youngest member of the Windy Lands family – little Perli joined us! Denis and I were a bit nervous for the last month, because we knew that there was only one puppy inside Mea and there was a slightly higher possibility of complications, but fortunately everything ended well and little Perli was born fast and safely. Thank you to our super vet Nina Krašna for all the support and advice along the way! Perli is a big, strong and agile girl with an incredibly beautiful blue merle colour. We were both secretly hoping Mea would be hiding a little blue copy of her great granny – my precious foundation girl Sky (A Blue Pearl) and when that actually happened, we were both on cloud nine! We knew we wanted to name the little one in Sky’s honour. So today we are introducing you Windy Lands Precious Pearl Blue – Perli.\n\nWelcome, little Perli, in these difficult times you bring us joy and happiness\n\nHAPPY 3RD BIRTHDAY G LITTER\n\n3 years ago, one of my most successful litters was born – my wonderful G litter. 5 out of 6 puppies are champions (with the sixth one half way through, but sadly stopped because of Corona) and 5 out of six have had really lovely litters already! All 6 puppies are also hips tested and all have healthy hips!Thank you all the owners and co-owners for taking a wonderful care of our sweeties and to Teija Ukkola for letting me use the outstanding Stigu as their sire and Katarina Petrič for hosting Stigu in Slovenia and making this wonderful mating possible!

He was flying in the ring with his handler, Inessa. I later learnt his name was Lunar Lakes Big Ben and he became EU JUNIOR WINNER that day! Ben is a son of one of the most beautiful blue merle Wicani dogs of all times – Wicani Dance Thru the Mist. All these times I tried to either use Ben or get some of his offsprings. And finally, here she is – a long awaited daughter of this amazing male! She has been with us for a few months now and we had first official photoshoot with her today! Tanna is a born shown star, just like her daddy!Tanna lives with my good friend Kia Seničar (owner of our Neel). She is everything I have dream of all these years, and more!

I didn’t want to change the breed because collies are just irreplaceable, but I did want to change the colour, so the new puppy would mean a fresh start and help me overcome my sadness over loosing Gaja. I was lucky that there was the most perfect blue girl in Neda’s very first litter. I named her A Blue Pearl, as she was the most amazing blue colour. I didn’t plan shows and breeding and we did star with training agility, Frisbee, obedience and sheepdogs as Sky is a truly smart collie. But since she was also incredibly pretty, we tried a few shows and I was hooked:) Sky has achieved quite a few champions titles in her life and she has given me two most amazing litter, our A and B litters. She is now a mother, granny, great granny and great great granny to many wonderful collies all around the world. She still loves to catch ball and going on walks with us. She always warmly welcomes all the puppies that grow up at Windy Lands and is still a great mother to her two daughters Lia and Lani, who live with us.I am hoping there are still many healthy years in front of us! Elder dogs are so special, there is a unique sweetness and gentleness in them! I love you to the moon and back, my wonderful girl\n\nWINDY LANDS O LITTER\n\nO litter was our first all sable litter and our most numerous litter! During the heavy corona lockdown, we mated our Robin (H litter) to a handsome Hungarian boy Tony (Nyitramenti Yanichar Sulatan). We have 8 boys and one special girl Oli, who will hopefully be used in my breeding. Oli and boys Oto, Orrie, Ossi, Othello, Otto and Finn stayed in Slovenia, Odi went to Austria and Charm to Norway. This litter is especially special as they were raised with co owners and also with me at Windy Lands. They all have truly fabulous characters.\n\nSIRE: CIB CH NYITRAMENTI YANICHAR SULTAN – TONY (Faust von der Deditzhöhe x CH Castle Queen’s Coco Chanel)\n\nDAM: CLUB CH HONEY N SPICE OF THE WINDY LANDS – ROBIN (CH Blowing in the Wind Bill of Kassiopeia x Be My Spicy Dream of the Windy Lands)\n\nNEW ADDITIONS TO WINDY LANDS\n\nWelcome to Slovenia, Fame and Dancer!\n\nThe wonderful siblings joined our kennel and we have very high hopes for them.

She is an amazing little dog, so grateful for all the help and so ful of love. She loves people and other dogs. She is housebroken.

Mea and Winston gave us 6 gorgeous puppies, 5 girls and one boy. One girl was sadly stuck in a birth canal for too long and didn’t make it. Sleep tight, our little Maggie ♥ But the rest of the gang and mum Mea are doing great. Mea is a wonderful, attentive and loving mum and their co owner Denis is a wonderful first time breeder.\n\nCIB, CH, World Junior Winner 2014 WINSTON Magiczny Szkot x CH, jCH Endless Love of the Windy Lands\n\nAMOR’S FIRST LITTER\n\n14.11. 2019\n\nI would like to introduce you the first daughter of our Amor – CH Galaxy Guardian of the Windy Lands.\n\nDarsanian Cherry Blossom – Nala ❤\n\nSadly, she is the only survivor of this litter, but she is even more precious and such a beautiful puppy – have always loved baizes!\n\nCongrats to her breeder Sandra Cerjak and sorry for the difficult experience!

It was such a wonderful period of my life, raising these puppies. All 4 puppies – Lum, Leo, Lian and Lainie are so special to me, being the children of my heart girl Lani, and she really loved them too, playing with them like she was one of them:) Lainie and Lian had been with me the longest, so I got truly attached to them. I will visit my sweety Lainie as much possible, but Lian went to a faraway Sweden to live with Mia Hansson. It was so hard letting him go, but I know he will be loved, adored and spoiled by his new mummy and his big collie brother Kevin ♥ He is already in his new home and Mia tells me he is a brave, happy and relaxed puppy 🙂 I would like to thank my dear friend Kia Senicar for taking him there, she really made sure he was comfortable the whole way and he came out of the box with a wagging tail ♥\n\nEven if I am exhausted – raising this litter with addition of Enya for a little while and Joy, who takes quite a lot of my time, I miss them terribly and the house feels so empty now. Lani is totally lost as well, searching for them…and Joy is crying for her playmate. We will need a while to adjust to a new rhytm. But beautiful memories will stay with us forever and I will surely visit all of them as much as I can.\n\nBe happy, my little pearls, and thank you for these wonderful months together ♥\n\nEXPECTER M LITTER OF THE WINDY LANDS\n\nI am thrilled to announce that our M litter is on its way! The pregnancy of our young girl Mea – CH Endless Love of the Windy Lands has been confirmed and we are beyond happy as this mating was one crazy ride – literally!\n\nMea’s co-owner Denis Kogovšek and me have been admiring Winston for years and we both felt he would complete our sweet girl wonderfully. Since he lives so far away (1500 km), we planned to import chilled semen. But Mea had other plans – it seems she was determined to meet the handsome boy in person. She was ready to be mated on Sunday and no courier was willing to deliver us semen over the weekend. So Mea left Denis no choice but to sit in a car (I have to mention here that he was sick with high fever that weekend!) and take a looong ride towards Poland (I wasn’t able to go as I had a house ful of puppies at home). But this would never be possible if it weren’t for Winny’s amazing owner Gabriela Grubba who did everything in her power to help us! Gabriela, we will be forever grateful for your help and hope someday we can repay you for everything you did!\n\nDenis, me and Gabriela can’t wait to see what Mea is hiding. We shall meet the little ones in about one month time. This litter will be born at Denis’s under my supervision and mentorship.\n\nWINSTON: INCH.

I honestly feel like they were born just a few months ago! But they are already all grown up and some of them are or are going to be parents themselves soon!\n\nThis really is my most successful litter so far! A little before they were born, their mum Tara’s co-owner checked ‘the cards’ and they told him – Tara won’t have many puppies in her life (she only had that one litter), but those she will have will be of superb quality. And he was right! All 6 puppies are in breeding homes, 3 of them are champions, 2 are junior champions and one is half way through towards his championship. Our golden star Gaia is also vice junior Euro winner and her sister, our princess Gill is multi junior ch, multi ch, cro club winner ’18 and already has quite a few cacibs and bobs under her hat. All 6 also have healthy hips.\n\nHappy birthday, my dear babies, I am so happy I get to see most of you often as you don’t live too far! Hope your owners are spoiling you rotten for your birthday:)\n\nSKY IS 11 YEARS OLD\n\n29.10.2019\n\nIt was a very special day, 11 years ago…On this day, my most wonderful Blue Pearl Sky was born! I had been waiting her for months and I was thrilled when I received the news. On one way, it seems like yesterday, on another, it seems like a lifetime away. We have achieved so much in these last 11 years. Sky has competed in agility, trained Frisbee and sheepdogs, got me into the world of shows and breeding. Even tough preferring sports to shows, she has achieved quite a few CH titles and important wins. She was the most wonderful mother to two special litters, my first two ever litters (A and B). She is a granny to my C, E, F, G, H, J, L litters and great granny to out I litter.\n\nShe is still happy and healthy, loves going on walks and hikes with us and enjoys playing with her ball and Frisbee. She was a late bloomer, but look at her at 11 years – a True Beauty! She is also a super grandma to our puppies, guarding them and protecting them, loving them and teaching them manners.\n\nSky, you have changed my life for better. Hope I can make you happy for many more healthy years!\n\nHappy birthday to her brothers Dreamy, Zorro and Osty and sister Toffee and sending love to her amazing sister Glory in heaven ♥\n\nCH, Veteran CH A Blue Pearl of the Holy Mountain\n\nDERBY WINNER IN CELJE\n\nBack from the Derby Winner Celje (Slovenia) weekend of shows. Really exhausted as I was driving back home everyday to take care of my pups..but I spent a really lovely time with some of my dear friends and our collie owners.\n\nEven if it was such a long and at times stressful weekend, my girls did their best and made me so happy with their achievements! Our Robin – Honey n Spice of the Windy Lands won the Club winner title at the special show under a very nice and friendly judge Tadej Nagode. I really appeciated such nice and gentle (towards the dogs) judging! Our golden beauty Gea – Glorious Autumn Flame of the Windy Lands finished her Slovenian championship title with 4 cc!\n\nI am especially proud of them because these girls live as pets at my friends and they are not shown much, so not really used to the show ring and not as trained and other show dogs. I also do all the grooming and handling myself, so these results are the fruit of honest and hard work.\n\nThank you to all my friends for all the support during the weekend ♥\n\nGAIA passing the CAE1 behaviour test in Italy\n\nOur super star Gaia – jCH Gaia Earth Godess of the Windy Lands passed the CAE1 behaviour test with flying colours, she got 100 out of 100 points:) Bog congrats to her owner Alberto Celestini and thank you for testing.

She won 3CCs, 2 CACIBs, 2 BOBs and made us extremely proud by winning also BEST OF GROUP #2 and BEST OF GROUP #3 in quality competition. Way to go, Gill and Mark, you once again proved what an amazing team you are!\n\nHere she is, in all her glory at 23 months, pictured by her owner Mark Peter Zoran 😍\n\nAlso Gills’ brother, the handsome and sweet boy Amor – CH Galaxy Guardian of the Windy Lands, whose pet name truly describes his sweet character well, was shown at NDS Opatija (Croatia), and despite dropping all his coat, won his last CC to finish his CROATIAN CHAMPIONSHIP!! Thank you to the very nice Slovenian judge Maja Susec. He is the 4th of the 6 siblings to finish a championship and the other 2 are on their way as well. What a litter that is proving to be (Stigu x Tara).\n\nAmor had a date with a very nice girl a few weeks ago as well and we are patiently waiting to see if we were successful:)\n\nWelcome to Slovenia, little ENYA ♥\n\nWe welcome to Slovenia the new member of our Windy Lands family – coming from Italy is little Enya – Olwyn K Exquisite Caprice for Windy Lands ♥\n\nI have been admiring her stunning mum Crystal – cib, ch Runnerway I Am Aqua (Ch. Milas Ashes And Snow x Ch. Sammen’s Queen Of Clubs) ever since I saw her on a show many years ago and that day I said to myself: ‘One day I want her puppy’. When her owner Lada Kostioutchenko contacted me about using our Prince – Gallant Night Prince of the Windy Lands (cib, ch Skabona Oriental Style x jch Black Swan of the Windy Lands) , I was thrilled! Crystal spent 2 weeks with me and I got to know her wonderful nature, she is so calm, loving and has a bomb proof temperament. I was praying that the mating was successful! And when the ultrasound confirmed it, I told Lada I would like a triko daughter and she agreed ♥\n\nSo here she is, this little precious girl Enya, so much like her mum in character and body shape with a touch of her dad in her eyes – a perfect mix of both!\n\nShe lives with a wonderful family nearby, so hopefully I will get to see her often and we will have a litter with her in a few years!\n\nL LITTER OF THE WINDY LANDS\n\n31.7.2019\n\nFour little treasures born at Windy Lands…our long awaited L litter!

But sadly, our Pai was carrying just one puppy! We tried importing chilled semen for the first time in my breeding career and everything worked out great – Pai is very fertile, having a big litter last year, Ziggy sired 10 puppies in his latest litter, the semen arrived in excellent quality and I am very grateful to Ziggy’s owner Cathy Sonntag for all the help with this plan as well as Pai’c co-owners for monitoring progesterone carefully and taking her to our best repro vet. There was just one obstacle – Fedex delivered the semen 1 day too late due to some strike in France! So when we finally got the semen, it was already 5 days after the ovulation for Pai and the result was just one puppy. As it usually happens with just one baby, Pai didn’t start the labour on her own and cesarian was needed. Sadly, we lost our puppy boy during the operation. To say we are heartbroken is an understatement. Breeding is really hard and it has been especially difficult for us in the last few months. We really hope sun will start shining soon for us as it’s been a very dark season for so long now:(\n\nSUCCESS IN CROATIA FOR WINDY LANDS\n\nA very successful weekend for our Windy Lands youngsters!
