        "text": "JACOPO APO BORDIN\n\nHEAD OF STRATEGY 28 Studios\n\nJacopo “Apo” Bordin is the Head of Strategy at 28 Studios, prior to his new role he was Head of Strategy and Growth at Grey Italy. He joined Grey in 2019 after spending most of his career abroad.\n\nBorn in Italy but raised in Switzerland, Jacopo started his professional journey in San Francisco. A long-time admirer of the “Famously Effective” philosophy, he believes that creativity has never been as important as it is today for brands to grow.\n\nThis belief and his international experience acquired in the US and Amsterdam fuel his ambition to build a team that drives business results for clients through strategic rigor and messy creative thinking. As testament to this, he’s also been part of the Effie Awards Italy Jury.\n\nHis roster of clients spans across categories and includes, among others, Netflix, Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics LG, Amazon Game Studios, Adidas, McDonald’s, and Mars Petcare.\n\nAll of these experiences have shaped his cultural and business understanding, but definitely not his accent.\n\nLeroy is the brand strategy director of the car rental and car sharing company Sixt, helping the brand on its quest to become the world’s leading premium mobility provider. Before that, he was a Strategist and Member of the Young Advisory Board at the renowned full-service Agency and creative powerhouse Jung von Matt in Hamburg. He has worked for many large international clients such as Zalando, BMW and Bosch, though his heart actually beats for working with up and coming brands. Leroy believes in building business around brand and the imperative connection of brand strategy with product and service innovation, business modelling and organisational development. He’s an active proponent of diversity in the creative industries, has proudly majored and graduated in rhetoric from the prestigious Eberhard-Karls University of Tübingen, and now holds several lectureships at his alma mater and other academic institutions.\n\nAfter graduating in economics he started his carreer in market research as a qualitative researcher, than experienced an exiting journey at client side as the marketing manager of Toyota Motor Hungary.\n\nBy joining JWT Budapest he found his passion: advertising. As Client Service Director he was responsible for the operation of the agency for more than 10 years.\n\nHa gained international recognition with the locally developed and executed launch campaign for Reckitt Benckiser’s Cillit Bang, that went world wide.\n\nCillit Bang - The dirt is gone! campaign became the most remembered TVC in the UK (AdWatch/TNS International).\n\nFor melting the international knowledge with the local touch he established White Rabbit Budapest with his creative partners and has been running the agency as CEO for more than 15 years.\n\nUnder his leadership White Rabbit Budapest won all the major industry awards like D&AD, Cannes Lions, One Show, ANDY Awards, Clio, LIA, ADC, New York Festivals and almost 10 Effies - including a Grad Prix.\n\nWhite Rabbit Budapest is the 75th most-awarded ad agency in the EMEA region, and it also hit the lists of the 200 most-awarded ad campaigns of 2021, the 200 most-awarded advertisers of 2021, the most creative countries in advertising of 2021 according to The Drum World Creative Rankings.\n\nThe world beyond ads for him contains his family with two little daughters, and his passion towards cooking.\n\nFelipe is a Brazilian Creative with more than 15 years in the industry. He started his career in his native country and 6 years ago he came to Europe. In the first three years he worked at Ogilvy Spain for brands such as Iberia and Level Airlines, Ford, Santander and OpenBank, Mondelez Group, Cruz Campo Beer and El País.\n\nAfter this period he was invited to move to Brussels to join the Global Headquarter Team of Ogilvy Social.Lab, where he worked for brands such as Ikea, Nespresso, Coca-Cola, Sprite, Bombay Sapphire, Martini, St. German, Carrefour, Deutsche Bank, Philips, Sennheiser and Vans.\n\nCurrently at Edelman Spain, Felipe is responsible for the creativity of the offices in Madrid and Barcelona, working for clients such as Iberostar Group, HP, Pay Pal, Astrazeneca, 2K and TikTok, in addition to being part of the EDELMAN Creative Board for the EMEA region.\n\nYann Chervet\n\nHead of Strategy\n\nBETC Paris\n\n“Originally from Switzerland, Yann started his advertising career in France in 2010 as a strategic planner, before joining the Publicis group in 2014 for an international position where he took the strategic lead on several global brands such as JDE Coffee, PMI or L'Oréal.\n\nIn 2018, he joined Saatchi & Saatchi France as Head of Strategies, where he was in charge of connecting strategic planning, data research, social media and creative technology to bring more efficiency and relevance to clients such as HSBC, SFR, Playstation, Burger King, Visa Europe or the International Red Cross.\n\nIn 2022, Yann joined BETC Paris as Head of Strategy, where he leverages his experience in creative strategy for global clients such as Mondelez International, Lacoste or Sephora.”\n\nFrans Cuypers (07.06.1993) – Strategic Director at Happiness Anywhere\n\nWith an education in economics and international politics, I started my career as strategic\n\nconsultant in corporate and public affairs. Having always been fascinated by the creative\n\nindustry, I was soon drawn to it and decided to join Happiness Anywhere as strategic\n\nplanner. At Happiness, I have since been working on many big local and international brands\n\nsuch as Belfius, Toyota, DVV, BRU, Marktplaats-2dehands, CUPRA, HUSK and many others.\n\nAs strategist, I don’t believe in strategy for the sake of strategy or creativity for the sake of\n\ncreativity. I believe in the magic of big strategic thinking meeting big creative, to create big\n\nimpact. That’s what drives me.\n\nBea is a senior strategist at AMV. She’s constantly curious, and always challenges herself to push strategic thinking above and beyond the received wisdom.\n\nOver the last 3 years, she’s worked on campaigns for Bodyform/Libresse and TENA, helping to dismantle the shame, silence and stigma that still permeate the issues of women’s bodies and intimate experiences.\n\nLast year, she was involved in both #wombstories and #painstories for Libresse, campaigns which went on to win numerous awards at Cannes, D&AD, AME, Marketing Society, APG, the One Show, to name a few.

The same year, Leo Burnett Beirut was number 4 most creative agency worldwide (Big Won) and one of the 10 Pioneering Agencies in the world (Contagious).

This is where my passion for creativity and strategic imagination was born.

After two years of debauchery in the post wall era, Béla moved to Hamburg to start a life in advertising. Working for some of the most awarded agencies in Germany, he quickly realised how his knack for culture benefitted him in the creative industry. But soon he also realised that his forward thinking ideologies weren’t always fitting with Hamburg’s venerable merchant culture and so he set sail to conquer Europe’s advertising scene instead.\n\nIn his current gig, Béla has helped Publicis Italy to climb from creative No-man’s land to the world’s most awarded agency, leading strategy for Diesel, Heineken, Barilla, Mercedes, Bottega Veneta, Netflix et al. Next up, Béla will be shaping LePub, a new breed of agency to fight creative mediocrity with innovative work.\n\nLePub has just been named Contagious Pioneer 2022 and Adweek creative agency to watch."
