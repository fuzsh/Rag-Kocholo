        "text": "The price for cats is the total one and includes all vaccinations and neutering/spaying. (Neutering a kitten is our free option with no fee.)\n\nIt is generally considered safe to spay kittens before they are fully grown. In fact, many veterinarians recommend spaying or neutering kittens as early as 8-16 weeks old. This is known as early-age spay/neuter or pediatric spay/neuter.\n\nEarly spaying has several benefits:\n\nReduced risk of certain health issues: Spaying\\Neutering a kitten before it first heat cycle can significantly reduce the risk of mammary cancer and eliminates the risk of uterine infections and other reproductive system diseases.\n\nEasier recovery: Younger kittens tend to recover faster from surgery with fewer complications.\n\nPopulation control: Spaying\\Neutering a kitten before it reaches sexual maturity helps prevent unwanted litters and contributes to reducing the population of homeless cats.\n\nBehavioral benefits: Spaying can help prevent behaviors associated with a cat’s heat cycle, such as excessive vocalization, marking, and escaping from the home.\n\nHowever, it is important to consult with a veterinarian to determine the best time to spay a kitten based on it individual health, breed, and circumstances. We will definitely do this if the age and health conditions of a kitten allow occurring the surgery before being shipped. We will not neuter/spay the kitten in the cases if a buyer will ask to neuter a kitten on its own or will buy the breeding rights for an additional cost with the kitten)\n\nAmerican Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA): The AVMA provides guidelines and recommendations on spaying and neutering cats, including early-age spay/neuter. You can visit their website at https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/avma-policies/pediatric-spayneuter-dogs-and-cats.\n\nAmerican Animal Hospital Association (AAHA): AAHA is another reputable organization that provides guidelines for spaying and neutering pets. Visit their website at https://www.aaha.org/your-pet/pet-owner-education/ask-aaha/spay-or-neuter/.\n\nAmerican Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP): The AAFP is a professional organization dedicated to improving the health and welfare of cats. They provide guidelines and resources related to feline healthcare, including spaying and neutering. Their website is https://catvets.com.\n\nThe Humane Society of the United States (HSUS): The HSUS advocates for early-age spay/neuter to help control pet overpopulation.
