        "text": "Origins[]\n\nThrough her mother's bloodline, Nina became part of a long family curse. This curse had originated with Nina's 18th century ancestor Grigori, who had been tainted by the Darkhold, a grimoire of black magic, and was subsequently bitten by a werewolf who served Dracula. Because of this, all the descendants of Grigori were cursed to become a werewolf upon their 18th birthday.\n\nNina's mother Lissa Russell was a victim of the curse until an altercation with a sorcerer named Glitternight altered her standing and she was freed from being a werewolf. Lissa then married a wealthy business tycoon named Mr. Price and gave birth to Nina. Although her mother was able to alter the curse's path against her, the curse continued its course to Nina. At some point Nina was attacked by a vampire who attempted to change her into one of the undead. This attack altered the curse for Nina somewhat and caused her to become both werewolf and vampire in one. By day Nina Price seemed to be a normal human, but once the sun goes down she became a vampire.\n\nDue to the werewolf's bite, Nina became a white wolf during the full moon, and she used her father's money and status to reserve a zoo or park, in which she would cage herself until the full moon was over and she was no longer an animal (so she would not hurt innocents). However, Nina had no problem using her supernatural abilities to harm criminals, as she found them acceptable targets for her vampiric thirsts, feeding on rapists and thieves once the sun went down.[2]\n\nHowling Commandos[]\n\nFalling into a trap set by S.H.I.E.L.D. during an adventure with her uncle Jack,[3] Nina soon after became a reluctant member of Nick Fury's Howling Commandos. Working at a secret military installation called Area 13, Nina was placed as part of a supernatural team working for the government set to handle situations that dealt with more of the macabre side of life, the team being called the Paranormal Containment Unit. During her time there she was partnered with another werewolf named Warwolf and fellow vampire Lilith, the daughter of Dracula."
