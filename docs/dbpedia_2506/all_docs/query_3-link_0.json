        "text": "Nina Breeder (born in 1982 in Genova, Italy), is an Italian contemporary artist based in New York City. She grew up in Northern Italy and lived there until 1991. Later she was relocated to Polperro, UK, for one year where she first met her adoptive brother Massimilian Breeder, who is present in several of her works and future films/video-art collaborations. She studied at Colombo Lyceum for Classic Literature and consequently at the Academy of Art in Florence, Italy.\n\nBack in 1999 N. Breeder began working on experimental films and performances in Florence. She later moved to Brooklyn, where she began collaborating with the artist Massimilian Breeder on film and performance art, beginning the film production of Devil come to Hell and stay where You belong* [1] and a series of land installations and performances. Her work is based on the confrontation with lost traditions and pagan rituals, often involving the use of hair, wool, feces and organic materials.* [2]\n\n2013\n\n\"Relaxation Tapes\" – Sound Works Series Vol.1\n\n\"Reconstruction of a Body\" – Sound Works Series Vol.1\n\n\"20 Minutes MRI\" – Sound Installation\n\n\"Analog Winds\" – Winds Sound Design for the film Reservoir by Massimilian Breeder [3]\n\n'2012\n\n\"La Cagna\" – Film – Currently in Production\n\n\"I am Indigenous to this Place\" – Photo Series, Public Installation NYC\n\n2011\n\n\"Selected Sound Works\" – Tokyo, JP\n\n\"Working Bodies\" – Photographs\n\n\"Human Frames\"- Kunst im Tunnel, KIT\n\n2010\n\n\"Winter Films\" – ongoing film project shot in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n\"Identity\" – photographic book\n\n\"Happy End\" – Ausstellung Exhibition, Kunsthalle Göppingen\n\n2009\n\nDevil come to Hell and stay where You Belong: Pera Museum, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nDevil come to Hell and stay where you belong: Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and Metz, France* [4]\n\nFreeshout and Pecci Museum, Prato, Italy* [5]\n\nAnthology Film Archives, New York City* [6][permanent dead link]\n\n\"Horse Pistes\" – Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, France\n\n2008\n\nLove is a Burning thing: Darom Art Center, Tel Aviv\n\nArtoteca, Milan, Italy\n\nCopenhagen International Film Festival, Official Selection\n\nGoteburg International Film Festival, Official Selection\n\n2007\n\nThe Lunch, Installation and Performance in collaboration with Nina Breeder at Art Space Blanque Monteaux, Paris\n\nUnnatural Selections at Pierogi Gallery, Brooklyn\n\n\"Nuit Blanche\" – Théâtre des Blancs-Manteaux, Paris, France\n\n2006\n\nPierogi Gallery at ArtBasel, Miami\n\n2005\n\nEx-Macelli Freeshout, Prato Italy\n\n\"PAM\", Chelsea Art Museum, New York City\n\nExperimental Cinema* LoWave\n\nMuseum of Modern and Contemporary Art* Pompidou Museum\n\nCentre Georges Pompidou* Hors Pistes\n\nAnthology Film Archives, New York City* Anthology Film Archive[permanent dead link]\n\nThe MainPOint* The Main Point\n\nEntrisme Contemporary Art Magazine* Entrisme\n\nFreeshout* Freeshout\n\nInternet Movies Database* IMDB\n\nWurlitzer Repetitions * [7]\n\nPierogi Gallery* [8]"
