        "text": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) -It was 8 years ago when the Cincinnati Zoo made the tough decision to send the Cincinnati-born Sumatran rhino, Harapan, to Indonesia so that he could help contribute to his critically endangered species' survival.\n\nHarapan was the third Sumatran rhino born at the Cincinnati Zoo, he was originally serving as the last ambassador of his species in the western hemisphere. But now, years later, Harapan was able to finally do what he was sent to Indonesia to do, sire a calf.\n\n“It was a long, arduous journey for all involved, and not without risks. Although it took several years before Harapan achieved what he was sent to do, this birth of his first calf at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary (SRS) confirms that we made the right decision,” said Dr. Terri Roth, director of the Cincinnati Zoo’s Center for Conservation & Research of Endangered Wildlife (CREW). “Our efforts and sacrifice were worth it, and the ultimate goal has been achieved. We are so grateful for the wonderful partnership we have shared with our Indonesian colleagues for over two decades and so very proud of their success.”\n\nRoth's research helped contribute to the births of Harapan and his two siblings here in Cincinnati.\n\nThis baby's the first calf for mom, Delilah, which makes the birth all the more important as it proves that both parents can reproduce.\n\nThere are only 10 Sumatran rhinos left in the managed breeding program, this includes the new calf recently born and the other who was born earlier in 2023. Outside of this program, there's fewer than 80 in existence. But, the good news is that this natural breeding success will greatly increase the odds for the long-term survival of the species.\n\n“You never know if a first-time mom will know what to do, but Delilah brought that calf into the world and started nursing it with no fuss or fanfare. It’s an incredible event that gives hope to the future of this critically endangered species,” said Nina Fascione, the International Rhino Foundation’s (IRF’s) executive director.\n\nIt's no easy process either, the gestation period for a Sumatran rhino is roughly 16 months, so increasing the population will take time and patience.\n\n“We are moving in the right direction. Two years ago, there were only two proven breeders at SRS. Today, there are six. The progress and momentum behind the managed breeding program is so encouraging, though we now need new genes since all offspring to-date are related to the successful breeding pair from the Cincinnati Zoo,\" said Roth.\n\nHarapan's older brother, Andalas, was born at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2001. He was the first of his kind to be born in a zoo in more than 100 years. Andalas was moved to SRS in 2007 and since then he has sired three calves, two of which are now parents."
