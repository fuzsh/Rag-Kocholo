        "text": "::: In June 2010 I registered a kennel 'Of The Windy Lands' as my collies and me me live in a Slovenian's most Windy Valley. I was so happy when my biggest childhood dream came true with the first Windy Collies! In our first A litter,\n\nThere were 5 babies, 4 of them live in Slovenia and the most handsome boy went to live to Finland with Teija Ukkola and her Windy Forest collies. From that litter I kept a tricolour princess, named Lia. She is the happiest dog, smiling all the time, just as her daddy Dandy. Since she is with us, our adventure has become even more exciting! I also kept her sister Mei in co-ownership, as Lia, due to her difficult at birth, won't be bred from. Mei lives with a wonderful family ZrimÅ¡ek at the Slovenian seaside.\n\n::: In February 2015, Sky became a mum for the second time. In out B litter, there were 5 girls and 3 boys. All of the puppies found wonderful homes in Slovenia, only our special blue merle boy Neel went to live in Denmark with Karen Jondahl and her Shep's collies. Also this time we kept the smallest and most special of the babies, little Lani, who is visually a copy of her mum and character - vise a copy of her dad Jett. I also gave two of the puppies in co-ownership to my good friends. Our black princess Tara lives with Danijel closely and our sweet boy Kai lives with Gordana in Ptuj. All three of our super youngsters are very successful at shows, my sweet Lani is making me especially proud, and the best thing - she (unlike her mum Sky) LOVES the show ring:) She really is everything I have ever dreamt of!\n\n::: In April 2015, our Mei from Sky's first litter had her babies - our C litter. They were born in Koper, where Mei lives in co-ownership with the family ZrimÅ¡ek. There were 5 wonderful girls, but little Pika died after struggling for a month. It was a very sad experience for all of us, but the other 4 girls are growing up wonderfully and all have a happy character of their parents Mei and Legend. Our beauty Rhea went to live in Switzerland with Amalia Muri and her Collies vom Schinznacherweiler, Ria to Italian Tuscany, Lori to join her big uncle Messi from my first litter and the special one, Pai, stayed with her mum Mei and is co-owned with me.\n\n::: In April 2016 our 4th litter was born - Nyxi became mum for the first time. She gave birth to 6 stunning little ones of the D litter. There were 3 blues and 3 tricolors. The most special one from the litter, Star, went to Finland to live with Teija Ukkola and Kirsi Rusanen. The stunning blue girl Lina went to live with Sandra Cerjak in Croatia and I will hopefully get her puppy someday. The tricolor beauty Coco went to live with family GrÄman in Ljubljana. The special tricolor boy Eros went to my dear friends Katarina PetriÄ and Anja Gavez (kennel Aydeen). The other blue boy, the sweet Lin went to live with Tina Doberlet and he will become her hiking companion. The last tri girl Naja went to live with a wonderful family Peternelj in Cerkno.\n\n::: In spring 2017, our E and F litters were born. Sadly, there were only one puppy in each litter (we lost a boy in E litter) but they are both so much more special and precious that way! Our Mea, the daughter of Mei, went into co-ownership to a very nice young boy, Denis. Our gorgeous boy Neo went to my neighbor and a good friend, DaÅ¡a, so I get to see him a lot :)\n\n::: In Autumn 2017 our G litter was born out of our Tara (B litter) and an outstanding Finnish male Stigu - Skabona Oriental Style, who carries some of world best lines (Fantazija, Steadwyn, Wicani, Rejejis). Thank you so much Teija Ukkola (Windy Forest's) for letting me use him and my dear friend Katarina PetriÄ (Aydeen) who helped me with this project! There were 6 fantastic puppies in a litter, 3 boys and 3 girls, 3 sables and 3 tricolors. I named the first born sable girl Gaia after my beloved first collie - Gaja. Also the young Gaia has an amazing, always happy temperament. She now lives in Italy with her daddy Alberto and mummy Beatrice and is super successful in a show ring! Another beauty from this litter, Gill, is rocking the show ring with her new daddy, Mark. She was very special to me as a baby and I am so pleased she found such an amazing home with Mark and Leja! The third girl, Gea, lives in Slovenia family MoÄnik and is a neighbor to her auntie, Dream (Tara's litter sister). Gea will have a Windy Lands litter in a few years. The boys all went abroad, Gal to Slovakia, Prince to Italy and Amor to Croatia. Our two big stars from this litter, Gaia and Gill, took part of the EDS 2018and they were placed 2 and 4 in a strong youth class of 12 bitches! Gill also took part of the EDS 2019 and she was placed 3rd!\n\n:::: In January 2018, our H litter was born. We mated Dream (B litter), to a sweet boy Billy - Blowing in the Windy Bill of Kassiopeia, imported from Germany. There were 7 puppies, 4 sable boys and 3 tricolor girls. Robin stayed with her mummy Dream and will be used in my breeding program. Her sister Winny lives in Bohinj, Slovenia and the other sister Poppy went to live with Kristina and Borna in Zagreb, Croatia. The most beautiful boy, Jack, went to live with Gill and the family Zoran and is already winning at shows. His brother Oskar went to Finland and lives with his cousin Alfred (Damon's son). The other two boys, Pollux and Castor stayed in Slovenia. All puppies from this litter have very good characters.\n\n:::: In Spring 2018 we went to a faraway Czech to visit an outstanding male - Gary (Born for Agara and African Gold). It was a long journey, but worth it as we got 6 amazing puppies in our I litter. Nature tricked us a bit as all 6 were tricolors, but I am extremely pleased with this litter. All have sweet expressions, good shape and movement. The girls Inna and Issa and boys Izzy and Iggy stayed in Slovenia, and the other two girls, Inis and Iris went to Sweden (kennel Sunwinds) nad UK. I hope Inis and Iris will make their owners Malin and Peter proud!\n\nWhat followed was a period of bad luck, disappointments and heartbreak. In Autumn of 2018, we drove to a faraway Germany to mate Lani, but were not successful.\n\n::: In February 2019, our long awaited J litter from Sia (B litter) and an outstanding young male, a litter brother to the famous Piaf - One was born, but 2 blue merle puppies died, and our surviving princess Joy was badly hurt during the long and difficult whelping. She damaged her brain and she has issues with balance. She can't walk on her own. We have been working with various veterinarians and doing different therapies to help her progress as much possible. Joy found a wonderful new mum called Vanja and she really appreciates how amazing Joy is - brave, determined, a real fighter, but also very smart, always happy, very cuddly and loving. They have formed a very special bond and Joy has a new best friend, a handicapped kitten Murat\n\n. > Joy's story <\n\nAnother disappointment followed in April. We chose a fantastic young male from France for our Pai (C litter) and decided to import chilled semen for the first time. But due to the strike of a plane company, the semen arrived a day later, resulting in Pai being in whelp with just one puppy. The whelp didn't start on its own and the tricolor boy died during a c-section. We were devastated. To honor our little angel, we won't have another K litter.\n\n::: In the summer of 2019, luck finally returned to Windy Lands. My beloved Lani became a mum for the second time, this time she gave us 4 little sunshines of our L litter who really brought happiness to us. Sadly, the dad Ben - Androma Prince Caspian is no longer with us. He was a wonderful, most loving and gentle boy with an amazing expression, that truly made you fall in love with him. We named one of the boys in his honor (Legacy of Narnian Prince). Our dark prince Leo went to live to Hungary - kennel Darkonyx. His tricolor brother Lian went to Sweden, their tricolor sister Lainie stayed in Slovenia and will hopefully have a Windy Lands litter in a few years and the only blue merle puppy Lum stayed in Slovenia as well. I spend a magical summer with these babies, it is especially amazing having litter here, at Windy Lands.\n\nThis summer, also our wonderful silver prince Neel (Born to Impress) came back to Slovenia. He now lives with my good friend Kia in Koper and is already rocking the show ring and his first litter turned out to be of super quality. We decided to keep a wonderful blue girl from it - Aida stayed with their breeder AljaÅ¾ Tratnik.\n\n::: In December 2019, our M litter was born to mum Mea and and outstanding male, Junior World Winner Winston. Since the litter was or outstanding quality, we decided to keep two puppies - girl Melody and boy Mai. Both now live with Mea's co owner, Denis KogovÅ¡ek. Mai is the second of our future breeding stock who carries one cea free gene.\n\n::: In july, our O litter was born and it's our first all sable litter and our most numerous litter! During the heavy corona lockdown, we mated our Robin (H litter) to a handsome Hungarian boy Tony (Nyitramenti Yanichar Sulatan). We have 8 boys and one special girl Oli, who will hopefully be used in my breeding. Oli and boys Oto, Orrie, Ossi, Othello, Otto and Finn stayed in Slovenia, Odi went to Austria and Charm to Norway. This litter is especially special as they were raised with co owners and also with me at Windy Lands. They all have truly fabulous characters!\n\n::: On a special day, 11.11.2020, a very special girl was born - our P litter singleton - Perli. Co breeder Denis and I were so relieved all went went - we were so nervous about having a singleton after the terrible loss of our only K litter baby boy during the C section 2 years ago. We names our little princess after her great granny Sky (A Blue Pearl)- she is called Precious Pearl Blue. Denis fell in love with her and decided to keep â¥ Sadly Perli broke ker heel and pelvis in a misfortunate accident and had to undergo a difficult operation. We are hoping she can recover and live a normal life!\n\nGreat granny Sky with daddy Blue Marine- they look so alike! Mea and Perli\n\n::: In summer 2021, my heart girl Lani gave me her 3rd, last litter, our Q litter. We mated her to a truly beautiful, big, strong and friendly male from Hungary, Herceg. Thank you to his owner Krizstina Lazlo with amazing help during the heavy lockdown! We got 5 outstanding puppies, 2 boys and 3 girls. I wasn't planning to keep a puppy just yet, but little Lumi just charmed me with her beauty and outstanding character so she stayed here at Windy Lands with her mum Lani, auntie Lia and granny Sky. Her sister Kiara went into co-ownership with Å pela Likosar and her brother Casper in co ownership with family Cvar. Two puppies, Chloe and Caleb went to Sweden, Chloe to a wonderful young lady Rebecca and Caleb Quim joined his half brother Lian and their mum Mia.\n\n::: One month later, our R litter was born. We mated Lani's son Neo (F litter) to AljaÅ¾ Tratnik's Lina. To our big surprise, we gor 8 puppies, and all were boys! Roxy, Romeo, Runi, Roni, Rorie, Bonnie and Vik live in Slovenia and Davion in Slovakia.\n\n::: 2022 was a very successful year. In Spring we had our S litter, our second double Windy Lands litter and a combination of my 2 foundation bitches - Sky and Nyxi. We got 6 gorgeous puppies, 4 girls and 2 boys.Girls Ruby,Stella and Sarai stayed in Slovenia, Milli and Valo went to Finland to a breeder Sarianne Vaisanen and Sven lives in Lithuania with the breeder I admire very much, Gintare Urbonaviciute. This litter was co-bred with our co-breeder, Denis KogovÅ¡ek.\n\n::: Later, the Easter bunny brought us our revolutionary T litter, that was bred in collaboration with kennel Icekeller - AljaÅ¾ and Barbara. We got a special permit and were the first in these parts of Europe to do a rough / smooth mating. Our goal was to widen the gene pool and to get a cea free gene from a different line that hasn't existed in roughs before. We mated our Aida, Neel's daughter, to a Croatian smooth boy, Tin Tin, who impresses with his size and outstanding character. Thank you dear Nina ZubriniÄ for letting us use him! We got 6 big and strong puppies - 4 smooths and 2 roughs. The 2 rough girls, Freya and Tillie stayed in Slovenia (Tillie with the kennel Icekeller) as well as one smooth girl Stella. The other 3 smooths all went abroad, Jana to Germany and the merle twins Viola and Peikko to Finland to breeders Suvi Lehto and Paivi Livonen.\n\n::: U litter, that followed, was quite a challenge, as there were only one girl born and the delivery was far from easy. At the end, everything turned out great and the little princess Unique was born healthily and truly beautiful to her mum Lainie and a very flashy Russian boy Neymar. The litter's co-breeder MatevÅ¾ fell in love with the little one and decided to keep her, so the merle beauty stayed with her mum Lainie and will hopefully continue Windy Lands story in a few years!\n\n::: At the end of summer, our V litter was born. It was the last litter of our best mover Mea and a very sweet Hungarian male Slash. Once again, it was done in collaboration with our co-breeder Denis. But sadly, it ended up with a heartbreak for Denis and me. 5 wonderful babies were born, 2 girls and 3 boys. But at 8 weeks, the two girls died, a sable girl Vicky due to a development issue and a truly gorgeous trikolor princess Venus due to a very tragic accident. This broke our hearts and we decided to take a break from our collaboration for a while. The three boys grew up nicely and tried to heal our wounds with their loving and gentle characters. Yakari went to Austria, Val and Voyo stayed in Slovenia.\n\nThis summer we also helped our fellow breeder Kia SeniÄar with her Lingonskogen B litter and the 4 puppies were growing up HERE, at Windy Lands. Their mum is our Russian import Lunar Lakes Primadonna and their daddy is Uk import, the great Beldones Tom Wood. We had a lot of fun together as the puppies have truly wonderful, loving and gentle characters! One boy, Brandy, went back to Lunar Lakes to live with his relatives and the two other boys, Kaj and Benny and the girl Eri all stayed in Slovenia and will hopefully be party of Windy Lands breeding program in the future!\n\n::: In 2023, we only had two litters, both in co - ownership. First we mated our two Italian imports, Daisy (Olwyn K Dew Point at Windy Lands) and Tristan (Tuo Principe Azzuro Dellamonade) and we got 7 fantastic puppies from our W litter, 4 blues and 3 trikolors. We kept in co own Lin, who lives with her big cousin Val from our V litter with my friend Petra and Winn, who lives close to his grandpa Kai in Ptuj. We sold Windy (who lives with his big cousin Valo from our S litter) and Lila to Finland and I accompanied our darling Wish to Israel, he now lives with a respected well known collie breeder and judge Tal Yaffe. Triko boy Will went to Austria and triko girl Lily stayed in a pet home in Slovenia.\n\n::: In summer, our X litter was born to Fame (Darsanian Destination Fame at Windy lands) and Casper (WIndy Lands Qnockout Dynamite). We got 6 puppies, 3 blue merles and 3 trikolors. Girls Neli, Karisma, Kassia and Klea and their brother Bron stayed in Slovenia and the brother Kan went to Uk. We will hopefully have puppies with our sweety Klea in the future!"
