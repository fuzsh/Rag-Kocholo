        "text": "The bernedoodle is a cross between a Bernese mountain dog and a poodle.\n\nThis crossbreed mixes the ingenious silliness of the poodle, with the even-tempered fidelity of the Berner. It is also a smaller sized dog for those who think a Bernese Mountain Dog is a bit too large, or have small children in the house and fear that a large dog breed may be too much of a handful. Bernedoodles shed less than Berners, making them safer for people with allergies.\n\nThe Bernedoodle is a great companion dog. Some can have a “messy” look about them. I wouldn’t expect them to win the beauty show award, but that’s not the main reason we adopt our furry friend, is it? But if you are looking for someone who will be happy to be with you on a hike, snowshoeing, out on the yard, or laying by the fireplace; then the Bernedoodle will be what you need.\n\nAlthough our litters are very consistent to avoid any in-breeding, no two Bernedoodles are identical. The genes from the parent change the litter in infinite permutations of coat marking. If you’d like to choose your own puppy marking, perhaps you should coordinate with us to get your puppy after it has been born and maybe even trained. But your options could be limited to what’s available. Since Bernedoodles are so popular, sometimes they are reserved even before they’re born."
