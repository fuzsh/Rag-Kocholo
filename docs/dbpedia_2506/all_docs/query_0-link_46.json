Main research interests: plant-pathogen interactions,&nbsp;plant defense responses and bioprospecting. My research (with co-operation in Norway and abroad) has focused on anatomical and molecular resistance mechanisms in trees. This include how and where defense compounds act, which cell types and tissue regions are involved in their production as well as the molecular and genetic mechanisms behind. I am currently leading a project&nbsp;focusing on identifying chemical defense compounds&nbsp;in white rot spruce, with health application perspective. In addition to cell molecular biology, I have broad experience in microscopy techniques as light- and electron microscopy, laser micro dissection and imaging.",

        "text": "Abstract\n\nCommon scab (CS) is a major bacterial disease causing lesions on potato tubers, degrading their appearance and reducing their market value. To accurately grade scab-infected potato tubers, this study introduces âScabyNetâ, an image processing approach combining color-morphology analysis with deep learning techniques. ScabyNet estimates tuber quality traits and accurately detects and quantifies CS severity levels from color images. It is presented as a standalone application with a graphical user interface comprising two main modules. One module identifies and separates tubers on images and estimates quality-related morphological features. In addition, it enables the extraction of tubers as standard tiles for the deep-learning module. The deep-learning module detects and quantifies the scab infection into five severity classes related to the relative infected area. The analysis was performed on a dataset of 7154 images of individual tiles collected from field and glasshouse experiments. Combining the two modules yields essential parameters for quality and disease inspection. The first module simplifies imaging by replacing the region proposal step of instance segmentation networks. Furthermore, the approach is an operational tool for an affordable phenotyping system that selects scab-resistant genotypes while maintaining their market standards."
