        "text": "Kagoshima is a prefecture in southern Japan, dotted with active and dormant volcanoes and a warm, tropical climate. Due to its favorable landscape and the Kagoshima Black Cattle breed of cows endemic to the region, a considerable amount of Japan’s total Wagyu production comes from Kagoshima. As with all of our A5 Japanese Wagyu, this selection represents the finest quality beef anywhere in the world, with classification standards rigorous and honest enough to truly let each prefecture’s sense of place shine.\n\nWagyu from Kagoshima is known for its tender texture, full-bodied depth of flavor, and its even marbling consistency throughout every fiber of the muscles. One look at this beef immediately dispels any uncertainty about its superiority to others, a credit to the unparalleled efforts that Japanese Wagyu producers uphold to ensure that their animals lead low-stress lives and meet meticulously managed ends.\n\nBeef of this caliber is stunningly satiating. With this Ribeye cut, we recommend either pan-searing on very high heat, or slicing paper-thin and warming with a blowtorch.\n\nKagoshima, Japan\n\nAvailable in portions of 16 - 17 oz, 17 - 18 oz, 18 - 19 oz, or as a 5lb bundle of 5 individual 16 - 17 oz steaks. All Wagyu is delivered frozen.\n\nThis exceptionally bright and aromatic saffron comes from Herat, Afghanistan, home of Heray Spice’s founder, Mohammad Salehi. Mohammed started this project in 2017, after years of working as a US Army interpreter in Afghanistan before relocating to Chicago, in a program specifically for individuals who had risked their lives in support of anti-Taliban efforts. Determined to sustain a valuable and impactful relationship with his homeland and to showcase its potential for phenomenal products, Mohammed organized a collective of several farmers around the production of the world’s finest saffron. In the four years since its inception, Heray has increased its farmer membership almost tenfold, weathered wildly complex and precarious positioning with the return of the Taliban, and nonetheless followed through on its mission — help farmers, support children’s education in Herat, and introduce western chefs and kitchens to an incredible product.\n\nMaking all of this happen is neither simple nor straightforward, but in any interview you’ll find with Mohammad, he states unambiguously that he views Heray foremost as a vehicle for impact, and secondarily as a traditional “business.” 10% of the company’s profits go directly toward educational non-profits in Herat, and the farmers and seasonal workers who actively farm the flowers and harvest the saffron are paid 30 - 50% more than the national standard. In addition to upholding the company’s impact aspirations, these measures are necessary in order to incentivize farmers to stick with saffron, despite it being more tedious and less profitable in the short-term than opium. However, if done well and targeted to a strong market, saffron will outperform opium after its second year, rewarding both the company’s investments and the farmers’ commitments.\n\nOur 100% Heritage-breed Berkshire pork ribs from Iowa are deliciously fatty and intricately marbled. More tender in texture and easier to cook than spare ribs, short ribs are a perfect and forgiving choice for the grill.\n\nBerkshire pigs are originally from Berkshire County, England, but were introduced to Japan and the United States in the nineteenth century, and today are considered pork’s closest approximation to Wagyu beef. Called Kurobuta pork in Japan, they remain the prime choice for elite chefs in Japan and beyond.\n\nThe animals in this selection were raised on family-owned hog farms in Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa. Though the farms and farmers differ in style and background, all are guided by principles of humane husbandry, ample pasture, and a commitment to excellence in the quality of the meat their animals will yield.\n\n2.5lb average"
