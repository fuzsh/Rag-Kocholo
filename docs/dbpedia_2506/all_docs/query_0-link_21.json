        "text": "Strazzanti was created to continue the story and memories of our grandparents who taught us everything about our Sicilian and Neapolitan heritage. Growing up we understood our Italian heritage through them as people, their stories and by sharing, eating and cooking the dishes that they grew up with, and using the ingredients that our relatives would send to us in England from Sicily & Naples in small parcels “il piccolo pacchetto”.\n\nWhen our grandparents left us, it reinforced to us as a family that what they taught and shared is a huge part of our cultural identity, and we could not risk that heritage disappearing. Together as a family, as three sisters, our passion is to give back to the land and work with like-minded young entrepreneurs, landowners and farmers in Sicily to keep this heritage and Sicilian traditions, which we all lovingly grew up with, alive.\n\nWe are dedicated to showcasing the incredible produce, culture and spirit of the Sicilian land through our family recipes, experiences and ingredients. We share our modern imaginings of Sicily through our culinary experiences, striving to inspire and transport you to Sicily in every mouthful; to create new memories or revisit old ones.\n\nEmilia, Sofia & Nina Strazzanti"
