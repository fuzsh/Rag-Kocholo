She proved her worth in the show ring and as a great producer, rearing three beautiful litters and passing on her quality down several generations\n\nShe excelled in the field, still picking up and working the beating line at 12 years old.\n\nGaesten Pinot Roas del Montecani\n\nWe kept Roma from Tarka’s first litter in 1992 by the legendary Wynsett Jumpin’ Jack Flash.\n\nShe had her moments in the show ring but was happier at home as Mum’s constant companion. Montecani Mystique\n\n1CC\n\nBeautiful Ccesca, my constant companion. She loved life. I have great memories of her with hordes of children, sitting on her bench at Crufts, having pictures taken. She loved the attention.\n\nTogether we walked 11 miles across the Malvern hills, she came to London on the train when I had my interview for my promotion, played to the crowds at Discover Dogs and spent days up on the heath when we were flying model rockets, trying to retrieve them.\n\nShe always greeted you with a smile, a real dog in a million.\n\nI will never forget the wonderful times we shared before her life was cut short, aged 6 years old.\n\nIt broke my heart to say goodbye.Montecani Mighty Aphrodite\n\nCcesca (centre) on the Malvern hills\n\nCcesca with Eva's pups\n\nIn the summer of 2006 we had to say goodbye to Armando Nannina (Nina), aged 15 and a half.\n\nShe was my third Spinone, a bit of a madam and very stubborn, but a fantastic hunting dog, working up till the age of 10.\n\nShe spent her retirement years living with my mum.\n\nPoor Cashmere from Bella and Chicco's litter developed an infection at 11 weeks old and despite all efforts, the vets were unable to save him. We wanted to put him on the Memories page for his devoted owners Jon and Shelley. They wrote these few words. Montecani Tremelo\n\n\"Cashmere was only in our lives for a short time, but in that time he touched our hearts in a way that will stay with everyone who loved him forever.

Very sadly we had to say Goodbye to our lovely gentle boy, Babio this morning. He lived a long, happy and healthy life, which I am so very grateful for, but it does not stop the sadness and tears as we said Farewell to him... I drove to Irma's house in Italy to collect him and his sister, Della when they were 10 weeks old. There was still quarantine in place then so the pair of them spent 6 months there, with Mum and I visiting every week. Babio went on to have a fantastic show career and sired some beautiful pups, so he lives on in his children and grandchildren, both here and abroad. After his show career he went to live with Mum returning to us earlier this year when Mum became ill. It's rather poignant that we should lose him 2 days before Mums funeral. I expect they missed each other...\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nUma has 4 CC's & 1 RCC\n\nBorn: 10th October 2004\n\nHip Score 4:3\n\nSh Ch Fernando Laerzio by Inostricani x Montecani It’s a Love Thing\n\nRes Best Puppy ISCGB Ch show 2005.

You and your colourful brothers, Oscar and Nando were very striking!\n\nYou grew into a wonderful Spinone, both in the show ring and as a Mum. You leave behind a whole legacy that will continue on…\n\nBut..Who will keep the youngsters in order?\n\nWho is going to eat the carrot peelings as I peel veg for Sunday roast? You loved food so much and these last few days we shared bags of crisps and lay by the fire together.\n\nI will miss those wise dark eyes, that gentle face, your firm but fair way of chastising the errant youngsters.\n\nYou were always with me in the garden, always watching , with that gaze that your Mum and Grandmother both had.. We became very close in the last few years as you grew older..\n\nI wish I could tell my Mum, Uma… It makes it even harder as we always sat and held paws and talked about memories when we had to say good bye.

Tears flowing here tonight. A time for reflection of a wonderful old girl who was so loved. My olden, my Han..Almost 14 years together, but time just caught up with us.\n\nIt was always you and me against the world, Havana..That was our motto. Now it's just me. But we did so much together. You had great show potential, but you didnt care much for men (except John), or the show ring, so you were retired early.\n\nThe highlight of your life was your 4 puppies, but the shock for me that day I caught you in a compromising position with Nemo was unbelievable. A 6 year old bitch with bad hips having a litter, not ideal, but we weathered it as it was my mistake and how you loved those puppies. It was the best decision I made and those pups were beautiful.\n\nYou were my upstairs dog when I lived alone for a while, that gentle snoring you were famous for, was somehow comforting.\n\nThese last two years your rear legs became weaker, our bond became stronger, we treated falling over as a good thing and you looked for a biscuit if your rear end ever failed you. It made you happy in a strange way! One day you stopped dead on our walk and let me know your legs just couldnt go that far anymore, so we stuck to the garden and you were happy with that. Your routine was out twice a day for a potter, a sniff around then back in and gawd were you determined if you wanted to go in, you would take off like a rocket..with me shouting 'slow down, wait for me'\n\nI was happy to lift you up the steps here in Somerset when your legs wouldnt go and we came down the steps together, you would wait for me at the top, me holding your tail to steady you.. I would have done anything for you and at that time, despite the legs, you were happy with your life.\n\nThese last few days, you grew more tired, your legs more wobbly, the food you loved so much seemed an effort to get down. You didnt get up for mealtimes anymore. Usually you were on your feet like a shot, ate your dinner and then waited for the bowl of tripe blood that you drank voraciously, bouncing if it didnt arrive quickly enough!! I fed you whatever you wanted to eat on your bed these last days but it was a struggle to find something you wanted to eat. I have packets and packets of fish treats, ham, meat, anything tasty!\n\nIt was so hard to let you go and I changed my mind several times. I cuddled you on your bed so much these last few days and stroked that old dog soft fur and you would respond with a paw and a gentle groan, looking up at me with cloudy, tired eyes. I willed you to turn a corner, get up, eat properly, prove me and the vets wrong, but life had become a chore and you were just so tired.\n\nI will miss you already, Havana :'( Your raised bed at my feet that was yours and yours alone is now being kept warm by another old dog.\n\n1 CC\n\nBorn: 11th Dec 2009 - 15th January 2019\n\nHip Score 3:7\n\nMontecani Giannini x Montecani Just Peachy\n\nBest Puppy National Gundog Championship Show\n\nLooking fabulous and part of the 2012 show team.

Had to say goodbye to my beautiful big Girl this afternoon, after a brave, month long battle I knew she could not win. Eva was a beautiful, big, gentle girl. She never put a paw wrong and she had the biggest paws, just like her Grandad, Nando.\n\nEva was a gazer. One lovely memory is her sitting in the dark at the top of the garden, just star gazing. I can picture it now, just the back of her, sitting quietly. I sat alongside her and she turned her head to look into my eyes and we just sat there, a perfect moment in time, forever etched on my mind.\n\nEva, you made John and I laugh with your battering down of the dog gate into the living room and then you would burst in at 100mph and flop down to sleep instantly, warm and happy by the log burner.\n\nThis morning I could tell you were tired. I felt we had reached the end and those big beautiful eyes of yours said the same. We sat and held paws and everytime I moved away, those eyes were on me. You loved Mum, Eva..I hope she was there waiting for you and you can both dance together like no one's watching.....\n\nBorn: 25th May 2007\n\nHip Score 0:0\n\nInternational and Italian Champion Peo x Nausicaa Dei Siccardi\n\nBreeder: Irma Bovolo\n\nWe lost Rio in 2019 after a short illness.\n\nOur White/Orange boy Rio, arrived in the UK on 14th April 2008.\n\nRio had a great character and superb temperament.\n\nBorn: 5th January 2008\n\nBill X Ambra\n\nBreeder: Marchioro Claudio\n\nRas was imported from Italy in 2016, aged 9 years.

April 2006-April 2019.\n\nAfter a lovely sunny Thursday, a good day, it was clear at the end of our walk that something was not right with Fresca and sadly after vets and tests, we had to let her go Friday afternoon. We were with her at the end, that tail was still wagging but her body had failed :'(\n\nLosing 5 dogs in 2 years is pretty much soul destroying and the moral of the story is if you keep a puppy from every litter, one day you will end up with a lot of very old dogs!! Babio was 12.5 years, Uma, 13.5, Havana almost 14 years and Fresca, 13.\n\nDogs just dont live long enough as we all know but we just can't make them live much more than their lifespan :(\n\nFresca was fit right up to the end. Never an illness her whole life. More like a 2 year old in her demeanour. The only visual aging process was her greying eyebrows. Every day she was out with me around the small holding. She loved to try and catch a chicken or two as they came out of the coop and constantly banged the nest box with her nose until somone shouted 'Freddie get away from there!!!!\n\nShe was the messiest drinker ever, flooding the floor with every drink..the towel under the kitchen waterbowl has stayed dry since Friday.. :'( She would bark for water.. I miss that bark!\n\nShe would bark if she was on a raised bed and there was a dog laying in front. She was a polite, non pushy dog with impeccable manners.\n\nShe was a heavy breather though..bit much sometimes as she followed you about the garden!!! :-D\n\nFresca did quite well in the show ring but her favourite pastime was working and we went on numerous Hertfordshire shoots in her lifetime. Her first shoot in Somerset, she was rather rusty though and managed to clear a whole drive after following two errant spaniels!\n\nWe attempted one working test as I had got her near perfect in training, but on the day she decided she she could not remember any of it. First time nerves perhaps! :)\n\nShe was a kind and special dog. She liked to stick her cold nose in your eye socket and offer you one of her enormous paws to hold. We often quoted the line from the film I Am Legend to her 'What the Hell You Doin Out Here Fred!' She loved that, it made her bounce about!\n\nI have cried buckets since we said goodbye, I couldnt face anything for a couple of days, but after a text from Olwen to see if I was alive and talking with Helen and Pat on the phone, I felt a bit better put things in perspective. Fresca has gone, but she had the best life, living well into old age for a dog and was so loved right up until her final breath..\n\nBorn: 19th February 2007\n\nHip Score 4:5\n\nSh Ch Babiot Del Mongioie at Montecani (Imp Italy) x Sh Ch Montecani Uma\n\nSiena is such a sweet girl, but just a little bit mischievous!! She shows a great aptitude for working and has a strong hunting instinct.\n\nProduced a lovely litter to Montecani Giannini in 2009 & another to Italix Octavious in 2011.\n\nNow fully mature and such a typical Spinone.\n\nOn the 12th January 2020 I had to make that hardest decision for my old dog.\n\nI am grateful that she had a long and healthy life, but inevitably old age always catches up. Why oh why do our finest companions only live such a short time..\n\nSiena 'so small' as she was once known(Mum used to laugh at me 'but she's huge?!) lived for food. If there was food available, Siena was there, barging through anything in her way. She had no spatial awareness!! Siena would stop at nothing for food thats how I knew she was ailing over these last few days as I coaxed her to eat. I did what we all do when caring for a poorly dog, buying in every tasty morsel possible in the hope she would eat and all would be well again. There is now cooked chicken, venison mince, trays of Forthglade etc lying sadly redundant in the fridge..\n\nSiena's gentle gaze, always watching me these last few days and her desire to be near me was stronger than ever.\n\nIt was Mum's Birthday yesterday, hence the double sadness I hope she was waiting with a gravy bone for Longface as she called her.\n\nThis morning Siena's slow feed bowl is laying still on the side. She went though so many of them as she would break the plastic picking them up and dropping on the floor to get the food out quicker!\n\nThere's no me yelling steady as Siena ploughed her 42kg (so small not!!) towards the bowl stand for dinner, completly unaware of her 'old dog' legs or anything in her way..in fact I would always say if I fell over enroute to the bowl stand, Siena would very likely eat me too!\n\nThere won't be random bowls, spoons, knives, washing up bowl etc lying around that Siena had carefully lifted from the worktop/sink and left on the floor!\n\nUnware of her Laryngeal paralysis, there wont be anymore dashes to the vets for antibiotics when she stole things as simple as a cooked parsnip which parts of ended up in her lungs causing aspiration pnemonia!! , Oh and the clever way she could pluck something from an open oven,something she learnt in later years !!\n\nBorn of two Show Champions, she wasnt a show dog but had two beautiful litters including our biggest litter of 13 born by C Section..Mum and I sat at the vets as the nurses kept bringing pups for us to revive, looking at each other thinking how many more ?! She did a grand job with both litters, rearing them all on her own and her love for her youngest daughter Cuda carried on all thoughout Siena's life.\n\nSiena likened herself to a lazy matriach, often telling the other dogs off from her sofa as they wandered in and out of the room! That bit we wont miss!!\n\nShe was my old dog and things just seem so quiet when everyone wandered in after our walk.\n\nThe loss of a pack member is always so hard. I had no sleep two nights ago as I sat with her, stroking her head, she nuzzled into me and I made that decision, also hoping that the vet could work some magic and that old dog would rally as she had done many times over the last few weeks. But this time old age was upon us and that wonderful old dog slipped away peacefully with me by her side..\n\nBorn: 6th December 2012\n\nPunto Dei Morenici x Bianca\n\nBreeder: Simone Tinti\n\nResides with Tracy Coxhead\n\nBuch arrived in the UK in April 2013\n\nA very sad day at Montecani HQ yesterday. We said goodbye to Asca after a progressive degenerative disease of which we never found the cause, despite various tests. We noticed a stiffness in her rear legs a few months ago and occasional left rear leg drag. Otherwise perfectly normal in herself and I put it down to age.\n\nThe last week was the downturn and it was clear that Asca was starting to struggle, losing sight in her left eye and her balance.She stayed very close to me and I made sure she always knew where I was.\n\nHer appetite remained and that was the hardest part of letting her go. She was all there, still stalking chickens abeit wobbly and barking at a dog that came in for grooming, tail lashing like a wild animal! The old Asca I knew so well! It was our bone of contention. Asca was a noisy sod and would also answer me back if I told her off! I will miss that feisty character.\n\nThe last morning I fed her breakfast, then we sat quietly in the living room, she knew I was there and with me by her side she went peacefully to sleep. Its a memory I treasure as for a moment, I could imagine she was still well. She looked so perfect and I snapped a last photo which I will treasure forever.\n\nWe then made that journey to the vets and she slipped peacefully away, in the back of the car with me by her side.\n\nThe end of an era, another connection to my Mum. Asca loved Mum. The other person she always loved and remembered was Helen Thomas.\n\nAsca was my stud puppy from my Italian import Siro out of a bitch I had bred (Siena's sister)\n\nI travelled to Shropshire those 10 years ago to pick my puppy and when I arrived, I was drawn to this beautiful pretty face, the first born pup. That was Asca. She slept all the way home to Hertfordshire in the front well.\n\nShe was a successful show dog. Perhaps if I hadnt been winding down my showing career at the time, I may have made her up to a Champion. She was a beautiful Spinone with one of the best heads, from her Mucrone ancestry.\n\nShe loved to chase and fetch a ball.\n\nAsca had two beautiful litters and lives on through her beautiful sons and daughters and also through their progeny.\n\nWe will so miss Asca, she was truly a beautiful Spinone....except perhaps for the barking!\n\nI hope Mum was there waiting on Asca's last journey\n\n12th April\n\nProduced a lovely litter with Nemo during 2010 of which one pup Montecani Lucio, owned by Helen Thomas is doing fantastico in his Gundog work! With her sire being Babio who is from strong Italian working lines and her mum Ava's 'full on' hunting instinct, Rivana is the best dog for hunting that we have here, real drive!\n\nThe field across the lane is calling me again.\n\nOn bright frosty mornings and hazy Summer evenings, I remember the draw of the field beyond, where I wasn't suppose to go. But oh the joy!\n\nMy ears go up and my pace quickens.\n\nAcross the lane I can see a little lady I know well. I haven't seen her for a while..Beside her is a white dog, tail wagging furiously.\n\nI know you don't want to let go, but I'm so tired..I'm not coming back this time.\n\nPlease don't cry. I can see your heart is broken. Let me go with a glad heart and remember all our good times.\n\nWe had the best 14 years a dog could wish for. I wish I could have stayed longer..\n\nI will always be your heart in mouth dog with my love for hunting\n\nNow safely tucked up your heart and memories forever.\n\nRivana 8th February 2008 - 4th February 2022.\n\nBorn: 9th April 2009\n\nMoHip Score 5:3ntecani Twister\n\nCiro Del Mongioie At Montecani (Imp Ita) x Montecani Fran Ccesca\n\nTwista...by far the naughtiest, funniest Spinone I had ever known.
