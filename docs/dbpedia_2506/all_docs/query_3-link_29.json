        "text": "We firmly believe in the importance of exploring new frontiers in design and construction, which drives us to actively participate in various competitions. These competitions offer us a unique platform to experiment and develop innovative approaches that challenge traditional norms and enrich our architectural proposals.\n\nIronically, we take part in architecture competitions to create more opportunities for us to design. The majority of our time spent in practice requires us to deal with the pragmatic aspects of architecture. While that is fulfilling in its own way, competing allows us to be freer in our designs.\n\nWe believe that participating in architectural competitions offers several key benefits. It allows us to gain new experiences and practice teamwork, which are crucial for our professional development. Competitions also provide an opportunity to add innovative projects to our portfolios, showcasing our skills and creativity. Furthermore, we acquire valuable skills that will be useful in our future work and studies, making us more attractive to potential employers.\n\nParticipating in architectural competitions is a form of expression. It gives me the opportunity to explore and develop concepts that excite me while honing skills in design and representation. Especially as I dive deeper into professional practice, competitions can be a breath of fresh air that allows me to keep engaged with my inquisitive side.\n\nWhat motivated us to participate in this competition was the proposal: connecting with light as a material of visibility and knowledge. Light-based design questions the design process, inverting the idea of habitat, intimacy, and protection, and challenging the choice of materials and the scope of the technical aspects of elements.\n\nThere are several reasons why participating in architecture competitions is valuable. First, these competitions provide a great opportunity to showcase creativity and test innovative ideas. They are appealing because they allow for experimenting with new design approaches and advancing innovative architectural techniques. Additionally, competitions serve as platforms to actualize projects and receive evaluations from experts. This feedback is essential for understanding how one's work would function in real-world environments and for making improvements.\n\nParticipating in architectural competitions allows us to challenge ourselves creatively and professionally. Participating in international competitions like this one helps broaden our perspective and consider new cultural experiences beyond our own norms and tastes. We also wanted to design freely again, as we did in our university days, focusing on aesthetics, function, and sustainability rather than being defined by guidelines, requirements, or money. We hoped to create something truly beautiful while pursuing the ideals of architecture.\n\nCompetitions are a very stimulating and complementary method and tool for working on everyday projects in the office. They help you stay engaged with research and encourage \"out of the box\" thinking and creating. Through sensible and sensitive experiments, you can temporarily escape your everyday space/time realities, routines, local legislation and politics, and sometimes narrow investor logic. In the case of this project (Iceland ski snow cabin), we also traveled in our imagination to the dramatic, archetypal, and beautiful landscapes of this remote island, which we have already visited and with whose nature and culture we have developed a very passionate, intimate relationship.\n\nWe have participated in a number of architectural competitions during the last two years. We believe they are an excellent way to challenge our skills and provide a vehicle to highlight our architectural approach to the issues that we have discussed above.\n\nAs students, we have found that competitions give us the opportunity to work on projects that we wouldn't encounter in the professional realm and to explore out-of-the-box solutions to common challenges. Competitions have been an excellent opportunity to share our ideas and see what other students and architects from around the world propose.\n\nArchitecture competitions are an incredible way to broaden one’s mind and elaborate on knowledge. This first competition for all of us also meant working together with people we held in high regard. It was a way of actively choosing who to work with and learning to be productive despite having multiple things going on in our lives and being far away from each other.\n\nWhat excites me the most is the challenge of providing my own solutions for a wide variety of tasks and being able to share them with a community. The platform offers young architects, in particular, the opportunity to present new and inspiring ideas to enhance growth and personal development.\n\nParticipating in architecture competitions allows us to challenge ourselves creatively, explore new ideas, and stay engaged with the latest trends and innovations in the field. It provides opportunities to showcase our skills, collaborate with other professionals, and gain recognition for our work.\n\nWe participate in architecture competitions because we are proud of our work. In school and post-graduation, we’ve designed projects defined by public service and community remediation. We feel this is the ultimate duty of the architect, beyond the niche and aesthetic. Herein, we want to share this work with our peers and inspire those with these creative skills to design generously.\n\nCompetitions often provide the opportunity to design for places and specific needs that may not ordinarily arise in a client brief. Competitions are a great way for architecture studios to challenge their thinking about architecture’s role and or contribution to society. To think big and to see ourselves as an agent for positive change. It is also an important exercise to test a firm’s ability to respond to a brief and compare their proposal to their peers.\n\nUnlike existing contests, BUILDNER addresses aspects of society that are not yet considered. This gives us many opportunities to think and has the power to change society. We also entered this contest to be part of such an initiative.\n\nI believe that participating in architectural competitions can greatly help me broaden my thinking and allow me to design boldly while trying out new design methods. For example, I think that the functionality of a single building is limited, so I aim to solve complex problems through designing systems. The topics provided by Buildner are always innovative and challenging, which is why I want to use this architectural competition to practice my ideas and receive diverse feedback from around the world. This experience will be a great exercise for my professional skills in the future.\n\nTaking part in architecture competitions is a way for us to break the routine of our day-to-day jobs. It allows us to push design boundaries and take concept ideas that stem from our unique approach to briefs and architectural visions to the extreme.\n\nParticipating in architectural competitions offers an even playing field for individuals at different stages and levels of exposure within the profession. When students and professionals compete together, the experience can push the boundaries of knowledge and creativity. This expansion can challenge preexisting concepts and ultimately propel the profession forward by sparking innovation and solving existing challenges in new ways. It is also a wonderful opportunity to network with peers while addressing interesting problems.\n\nThe competition provides us with an opportunity to explore and challenge various topics, pushing us beyond our comfort zones to try different types, thus fostering a continuous learning process. In competitions, we are often faced with numerous requirements and constraints, similar to those encountered in future architectural practice. However, they are also more theoretical, which stimulates our imagination and creativity. This is particularly meaningful for us as students.\n\nThere are many reasons for this, but the main one is that the competition is a way for teams to see their skills and teamwork before they graduate and use the opportunity to improve individually.\n\nArchitecture competitions are an important step in developing personal skills, expanding one's knowledge in a specific field, and having the freedom to experiment without particular constraints or obligations. Furthermore, engaging in these competitions with a team of people who share your interests is a smart way to foster team building and highlight the peculiarities of each member. For our group, this collaboration was very efficient and allowed us to get to know each other personally and professionally.\n\nParticipating in architecture competitions offers a valuable opportunity to engage with professionals from around the world and acquire new knowledge, especially when projects are carried out in teams. This experience involves the ability to collaborate with others and compare different ideas to create a final project. Moreover, competitions typically present design challenges that demand innovative solutions, encouraging the development of new design approaches. Additionally, taking part in these competitions provides significant visibility and prestige, showcasing one's work to a wide audience and increasing future opportunities, both academically and professionally.\n\nWe participate in competitions for fun! Architecture competitions offer us the chance to let our creativity run wild, unfettered by the usual shackles of professional projects. We architects thrive on challenges – the kind that make us grow taller, not just our buildings! These competitions throw us into a whirlwind of diverse concepts, like a wild ride through the theme park of design. We get to play with different design philosophies, shuffle spatial arrangements like a deck of cards, and indulge our curiosities until they're bursting at the seams. It's like being mad scientists in a laboratory of architectural innovation!\n\nAlthough it’s worth noting it’s an opportunity to push boundaries with creativity and technical expertise, like many others have said, who have answered this very question. But, to be real it’s to show the world what we are capable of, either as individuals, architectural designers, or as recent graduates/students, out of the academic/professional settings.\n\nArchitectural competitions provide an kerf to look though real issues around us and encourage designers to think outside the box . This is a great opportunity to help architects understand the world, mutually, it allows the world to meet our vision.\n\nAs a recent graduate in architecture, I feel that I still have to mature in certain aspects when facing a new project. In addition to exploring my capabilities as an architect, participating in this type of competitions helps me improve not only in the project phase but mainly, in how to efficently present and explain a project.\n\nWe believe that architectural competitions offer opportunities to experiment with novel solutions and themes, pushing us out of our comfort zone and challenging our capabilities. It's an excellent method for rapidly acquiring new knowledge and skills. Furthermore, we view competitions as a meritocratic form of recognition and consider idea competitions to be invaluable training for the design challenges we will face in our future careers.\n\nWe view competitions as a perfect exercise for testing creativity and exploring innovative proposals. They present a challenge for us and offer an opportunity to seek solutions to current problems. Additionally, competitions serve as a means to reach out and create a community among colleagues in the profession.\n\nI participate in architecture competitions because they allow me to explore innovative design concepts, push the boundaries of my creativity, and refine my technical skills. They provide an opportunity to tackle design challenges that I might not encounter in my day-to-day work.\n\nAs a collective, this is the first time we have all individually collaborated on a project together. Being relatively new to the field of architecture, we are eager to understand and analyze the current conditions of our built environment. Architectural competitions provide us with the platform to establish our voice and explore our interests through the act of creation. In academia and the professional world, the design and construction of a building can be a lengthy process, whereas competitions allow us to work swiftly based on our instincts and intuition.\n\nArchitectural competitions offer the freedom to realize projects according to one's vision. While rules provide direction for thought, they don't restrict creativity. This enables the expression of one's full creative potential and design perspective. Our primary objective in participating in competitions is to refine our creative voice and diversify our portfolio. We believe that this experience will deepen our engagement with the design process.\n\nCompetitions provide a means to escape the numerous rules one must adhere to when designing a client's project. They offer freedom and prompt questions like, \"Is this allowed?\" or \"Should I explore this path instead?\" This encourages searching for new and different approaches. It's not just about expanding one's portfolio; it's about exercising the brain and having fun.\n\nPrimarily to hone my abilities in visualization and communication as well as using the prompt to test a particular idea or theme of exploration. The architectural work I do always seems to return to similar themes in different contexts. A new prompt or project offers a way to consider these themes in a new way.\n\nI take part in competitions because, for me, architectural competitions are not only about winning, but also a chance to gain experience, showcase skills, better understand the project, and receive recognition. By participating, I work on honing my skills and become even more motivated to create.\n\nCompetitions give the opportunity for you to work closely with teammates you admire, allowing you to learn from them as well as how to collaborate with them. As a bonus, competition work will be useful for enriching academic portfolios and future job applications.\n\nI participate in competitions because I believe that architectural competitions are extremely stimulating occasions—a 'space' free from constraints in which you can express your point of view. They allow me to explore different and original topics and constitute a precious opportunity for creative enrichment and self-reflection.\n\nThis was our first competition entry, with the goal to challenge ourselves, showcase our skills, and share our ideas. As students, we believe competitions are the best opportunity to be part of and develop projects that contribute our young concepts to the real world. We firmly believe that practice makes perfect. To improve our capabilities, we seek to participate in as many design competitions as possible to refine our respective styles and grow as architects.\n\nI highly appreciate designers who strive to push the boundaries of possibilities and go beyond what is already known. In our daily professional work, we may not always have the opportunity for such exploration, which doesn't necessarily positively impact our development. However, design competitions provide an ideal opportunity to explore new concepts and create something truly unconventional.\n\nWe firmly believe that continually challenging ourselves is the catalyst for our professional evolution, compelling us to engage in an ongoing process of self-critique. Staying in sync with trends while actively pursuing innovation is imperative for advancing our brand. It serves as the driving force behind nurturing our adaptive and creative capabilities across diverse markets.\n\nCompetitions benefit me in several ways, the most immediate is exposure of my work to peers and new audiences. But, personally, a competition creates a real deadline for me to organize a project into a thoughtful and complete form that is ready to share. This is especially important for personal projects that have no external deadlines.\n\nI believe architecture competitions are important to push us as designers and also see how our own skills compare with those around us. Less about competition and more about improving ourselves as designers.\n\nParticipating in architecture competitions helps you see things from a different perspective, opens up various opportunities to experiment, and allows you to try something you have not attempted before. By doing so and navigating through the process, it encourages you to find your own approach. This experience helps expand your skills and insights by providing a platform to express yourself. Additionally, it serves as excellent practice for teamwork and leadership.\n\nAs students, participating in architecture competitions gives us a glimpse of how our proposed design can become a reality. It puts us in the mindset of designing something that has a certain potential to be built, which is exciting. It also helps us think uniquely and keeps us constantly improving our skills and designs.\n\nFor us, architecture competitions are a way to work on a project without the constraints or limitations that are often present in a profession setting, which allows us to push and expand the ways we are thinking and making.\n\nArchitecture competitions are a fundamental tool for experimenting, exploring concepts, and exploring possibilities that allow us to discover new worldviews. They are a true playground where it's possible to build step by step one's identity as an architect and develop a personal design approach.\n\nBefore being a competitive space, an architecture competition is a hub where stories and possibilities can be shared. As a student, this competition provided me with an opportunity to expand my understanding of the current situation, in a site that I might never have had a chance to work with. The competition brief was our studio brief, and it was an excellent project to explore the unknown while proposing the most site-specific response possible for this site.\n\nI participate in architecture competitions to showcase my design skills and challenge myself with project types I wouldn’t typically see in my day-to-day work. With unconventional programs and unique competition sites that encourage designers to embrace complete creative control, I can explore innovative design ideas and systems that have the potential to transform a project and its community.\n\nCompetitions serve as a platform for us to explore fresh ideas, challenge ourselves, and experiment with cutting-edge design concepts. They grant us the freedom to think creatively and approach problems in unconventional ways, fostering a culture of innovation within our team. This environment also enables us to continuously refine our skills as we engage with diverse design briefs and problem-solving scenarios, offering a sense of growth and development.\n\nParticipation in architectural competitions allows one to improve their skills and acquire new knowledge, as well as broaden their perspective and gain unique, valuable experience. There is great value in observation and connecting with other human beings, which is done in a very particular way during such competitions. They allow for deeper analysis and understanding of other approaches and work ethics. They also facilitate dialogue with people from various cultures and backgrounds.\n\nWe believe that competitions are the most democratic exercises in architecture. They are the most honest way to highlight the need for good architectural projects to address the demands of a constantly changing world. Moreover, we think they challenge us, take us out of our comfort zone, and make us more creative.\n\nWe believe that participating in architecture competitions can develop our perception of spaces and sensitize us to the issues of the modern world. Moreover, we think that contact with people from all around the world can enrich our design experiences.\n\nCompetitions like this allow us to join the conversation on pressing global issues and explore if and how architecture can contribute. They can remove certain barriers to being innovative and radical when approaching solutions. I also enjoy reflecting on and learning from the variety of perspectives on these different design prompts.\n\nI participate in architecture competitions to give freedom to my imagination and creativity, and also to experiment with new ideas, forms, and technologies. Furthermore, as a young architect, competitions are a way for me to improve my graphic design and communication skills, as well as gain greater visibility on a professional level.\n\nArchitecture competitions provide us with a way to experiment with our ideas that are not limited as in the professional field, and not as directed as in school. Essentially, it is a platform for creative freedom within the set rules given by the brief.\n\nParticipation in ideation contests represents a valuable opportunity for us due to the creative freedom they offer and our ongoing interest in research. We chose this competition for its potential to explore new ways of living and enhancing the quality of life for older adults, a group often ignored in society. Additionally, as young architects starting our professional careers, it can be a great opportunity to showcase our philosophy, potential, and reflections on architecture to the world.\n\nWe take part in architecture competitions because they offer a chance to unleash our creativity, learn from others, and potentially win exciting projects. It's a way for us to grow personally and professionally while sharing our passion for design with the world.\n\nArchitectural competitions offer us a platform to cultivate innovative ideas rooted in contemporary issues. It is inspiring to learn from the architectural community in competitions as every participant uses different approaches to address the same prompt. All participants bring their unique expertise and past experiences into their designs, allowing us to learn from others in the field, challenge our own ideas, and develop our skill sets.\n\nCompetitions occupy the middle ground between the rather wide disjunction between design school and practice. They simultaneously offer autonomy to individual designers who generally work (and think) eclectically as a group, but also more closely simulate the design timeline from 'conceptual to specific' that one experiences in professional practice. On a personal level, although Yifan, Lucas, and I are only one cohort apart, we realized that our experiences in the same school varied differently as a result of pedagogical changes and disruptions, such as the pandemic. This opportunity gave me some insight into a much more dexterous mode of working that they had to adapt to.\n\nWe see architecture competitions as a way to work on important questions that may not be addressed in commissioned projects. Therefore, we view ideas competitions as a small but critical part of a larger project with many inputs and outputs, along with additional sources of support.\n\nArchitecture competitions of this nature allow anyone to challenge and provide a fresh approach to existing design dogmas. It is an incredible chance to step away from the conventional means of execution and present a diﬀerent perspective to a broader audience. It helps to facilitate change in the profession through exposure and discussion, as well as one’s own professional growth. Competitions are a great venue for experimentation, and a laboratory to unpack and test design philosophies.\n\nFor us, participating in architecture competitions offers the opportunity to approach design in a less typical manner. The guidelines and requirements for competition projects often allow us to think outside the box, which greatly aids in creating increasingly innovative work. As students, it's important for us to showcase our projects beyond the university setting. Both the chance to receive feedback on our designs from industry specialists and the opportunity to win various awards are additional reasons for us to participate in competitions.\n\nParticipating in competitions provides opportunities to expand our knowledge on subjects we may not have access to in our practical work. We always approach competitions by questioning our preconceptions of design while still keeping constraints and feasibility in mind. This approach has allowed us to grow our knowledge and reshape the ways we design in our day-to-day work.\n\nParticipating in architecture competitions is a great opportunity to gain experience in a professional field before graduating. It may enrich a student's formation with new ideas, together with learning how to cope with tight deadlines, team work and responsibilities. The most challenging thing about this is not having someone guiding us throughout the process, but it is up to us to be more self-critical and enterprising.\n\nArchitectural competitions are challenges that I can easily reflect my own design approach. The reason I participate in competitions is to challenge myself with talented designers from all over the world. The unique atmosphere of each project pushes me to solve the problem by approaching it by sustainable and effective ways with futuristic thinking.\n\nAs students, participating in architectural competitions allows us to know more architectural projects, broaden our horizons, and see the thoughts of different interpretations of people from different cultural backgrounds. At the same time, it prompts us to improve our professional skills and design methods.\n\nAs strange as it may sound, I enjoy architecture competitions less for their rivalry and more for the exchange of ideas with fellow architecture enthusiasts around the globe. It serves as a great exercise to demonstrate fascinating (and magical) typology and design methods, away from the traditional approach that oftentimes is full of (boring) constraints. I’m always intrigued whenever I see these competition posters because they always come up with peculiar—sometimes hilarious—challenges that spark instant curiosity, just like love at first sight!\n\nParticipating in architecture competitions gives me the opportunity to break free from the confines of conventional thinking that architects often find themselves in. It allows me to escape the limitations of my ideas, encouraging me to explore beyond the ordinary and perceive from diverse viewpoints. It is a refreshing way to stay inspired.\n\nArchitectural competitions offer a chance to explore various scales and usage typologies. They provide an opportunity to unleash your creativity while tackling new and unfamiliar challenges. Competitions serve as a tool for self-expression and growth within architecture, allowing us to apply our learned knowledge to different briefs and scenarios, continuously challenging our own ideas.\n\nTo me, participating in architecture competitions is a conduit for innovation, learning, and professional growth. They provide a platform to explore new design paradigms, confront contemporary challenges, and engage with diverse architectural ideologies. Through competitions, I delve into uncharted territories of architectural and urban design, aligning with my ongoing exploration of blending traditional practices with modern technological advancements.\n\nInternational competitions pose the most pressing questions of the moment, challenging architects to address society's most urgent problems and emphasizing the need for their vision where it is most needed. Therefore, I feel obligated to provide a direct response to the current societal challenges, shaping the future and envisioning what it means to take charge. This year, I participated in several competitions independently and attempted to formulate a Ph.D. proposal topic. However, the work is still in progress and awaits approval.\n\nWe see architecture competitions as opportunities for our team to challenge ourselves and continually develop our design skills. They often involve unique and complex design problems that push us to think creatively and find innovative solutions. Competitions often have fewer constraints than real-world projects, allowing for greater creative freedom. This encourages us to explore unconventional ideas and collectively push the boundaries of design.\n\nParticipating in architecture competitions is a conscious and deliberate decision on our part, driven primarily by our desire to maintain a platform for personal expression and to preserve our intellectual curiosity. These competitions represent a fertile ground where ideas can grow unrestrained, allowing us to push our design ideas beyond conventional boundaries and explore theories that pique our interest.\n\nArchitecture competitions are an opportunity to push forward our ideas and continue being a student. It lets you explore your creativity. It’s also an opportunity to get familiar with other tools and softwares that we want to improve.\n\nFor us, competitions are an opportunity to showcase our ideas and confront challenges that we would never encounter otherwise. It is a break from ordinary life and a way for us to fulfill our creative desires.\n\nArchitectural competitions are very different from the daily projects I've encountered. The nature of these competitions allows me to explore, reflect, learn, create, and experiment with new ideas and skills. Throughout the process, I've also had the chance to refine and develop my own beliefs and narratives about architecture.\n\nCompetitions offer architects a platform to explore innovative and experimental design ideas that may not be possible in typical commissioned projects. They allow us to push the boundaries of our creativity and test new concepts. Additionally, competitions can be a valuable learning experience, enabling us to receive feedback from juries and improve our skills.\n\nParticipating in architecture competitions has not only enabled us to explore various approaches for our own projects but has also allowed us to share our processes and receive valuable feedback from different perspectives. Overall, this experience enriches us and provides an opportunity to explore new concepts, pushing our boundaries.\n\nFor us, competitions provide a testing ground for ideas which may not have an immediate market. It allows for broad speculation on emerging realities which are not yet known. It gives us an opportunity to integrate our academic research into our professional work without the restrictions imposed by a client.\n\nI decided to participate in an architectural competition because as a young architect, it is an opportunity to confront my point of view with real life. It was also an opportunity for me to concretize a process and a methodology. For me, the culture of experience is what makes an architect, and these competitions are good ways to confront the concrete.\n\nArchitectural competitions allow us to challenge ourselves with diverse design approaches. They also provide an opportunity to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and real-world practice. Overall, this creates an exciting environment for us to experiment and explore unconventional ideas, which we truly enjoy.\n\nWe both have a strong passion for sharing ideas, fostering creativity and collaborating. This led us to seize the great opportunity to work together. For us it is important to keep exploring unconventional thinking, different settings, and new frameworks beyond our usual projects.\n\nI think it is a great way to explore new situations, needs, and challenges, and in doing so, grow and become more aware of the broader world we live and create in.\n\nI chose to engage in architecture competitions as a means of broadening my horizons, thinking outside the box, and combating burnout. Competitions, in my view, offer a platform for expressing and showcasing our ideas. They provide an opportunity to break free from conventional constraints and explore innovative design concepts.\n\nWe participate in architecture competitions because they provide us with an arena in which we can play gracefully with ideas. Competitions challenge us to make design decisions always in relation to people and to place, and they encourage us to consider the material, structural, and anthropological implications of architecture.\n\nCompetitions always allow you to see many different perspectives on one task. You can see many different ideas that you have not considered yourself and are always a great source of inspiration and new experience.\n\nThis is the first time we have taken part in such an architectural competition. We are interested in the topic of a conscious ecological approach in tourism and construction, as well as the beauty of the nature of the Latvian coast. This topic combines our love for nature and interest in spiritual practices.\n\nOur team participated in an architecture competition to seize the opportunity to explore various topics beyond what we could learn in school. Additionally, we embarked on this project to compete on the global stage and share diverse ideas with the worldwide community. These experiences have allowed us to take a step forward in our growth before graduation.\n\nThe architectural competition is a training opportunity to push the unrealistic projects in the mind to reality through step-by-step deliberation exercises. And this kind of opportunity is particularly valuable for our students. It breaks away from the school's training logic, so that we can have the opportunity to show this logic combined with our own understanding.\n\nAs architecture students, we are always looking for ways to challenge our creativity and hone our design skills. Design competitions allow us to exercise our abilities in design and software, as well as give us more opportunity to work with a team and collaborate towards a common goal.\n\nArchitecture competitions gives us an opportunity to work outside our comfort zones. To explore a new societal way of life and understand the complexities of designing that lie around them. It is one of the few mediums that allows architects to go wild with their imagination, designing your unique vision of how you see the world.\n\nCompetitions are a unique platform in which you can test ideas and skills which you may not be able to test otherwise and, all with a deadline so you can reward yourself with a wine at the end - just like in the real world!\n\nParticipating in an architecture competition is an opportunity to introduce myself to the world. Additionally, through participation in the contest, I receive an objective evaluation and an indicator that my design is heading in the right direction.\n\nCompetitions are a good challenge, not only for professional growth but also for personal development. They provide an opportunity to step away from routine and do something unusual. Additionally, it's a great way to learn something new about another country's culture and people.\n\nCompetitions provide me with opportunities to practice my skills and can also help me find potential opportunities to enhance my career. Sometimes, competitions offer unique and attractive programs that I have never experienced before, such as the Olive Guest House competition.\n\nArchitecture competitions serve as a powerful tool to enhance the creative process. I also believe that they provide a virtual journey to different places, allowing us to immerse ourselves in their customs, aromas, landscapes, and diverse architectures. This experience serves as a prelude to the project and enriches the design exploration.\n\nFor us, participating in architecturecompetitionsmeanshaving the opportunity to find new alternative and sustainablesolutions for each project weundertake. Multidisciplinarity and innovation are the constant approaches in our research, in order to define new solutions for a less environmental impact of architecture.\n\nWhat we find very exciting about the architectural endeavor is its unique existence between theory and practice, and we are eager to combine our academic knowledge with practical experience. This means that we seek the opportunity to continually test our theoretical assumptions against reality.\n\nWe have developed a strong foundation in teamwork and self-challenge since our university days, as we believe in learning from others. Engaging in architecture competitions, even with ongoing commissions, allows us to expand our knowledge, explore new territories, test and exchange ideas, and tackle design issues that may not arise in our everyday work.\n\nWe occasionally participate in competitions that align with our professional interests and visions. We view them as exercises, opportunities to delve back into research mode, self-educate, and enhance our skills. Competitions enable us to refine our ideas and showcase them without the constraints of a client or budget.\n\nI participate in architectural competitions for several reasons. Firstly, they provide valuable experiences that expand my ideas and allow me to explore new concepts. Secondly, they serve as a platform for young architects like myself to discover our professional identities and develop innovative projects.\n\nI have participated in several architectural competitions with the purpose of not only winning awards but, more importantly, challenging myself and stepping out of my comfort zone. This allows me to continuously engage in critical thinking and remain focused on design.\n\nAt CEB, we participate in architecture competitions for several reasons. Firstly, it provides us with an opportunity to compete with established companies, showcasing our skills and making a distinctive contribution. Secondly, we highly value the experience of competing with renowned names in the architecture community and receiving their feedback.\n\nWe participate in architecture vision competitions when we have spare time during our school work. The value we derive from participating in these competitions is that they enhance our vision, challenge us to consider design issues that we may not encounter within the university, and introduce new ideas into our future careers.\n\nWe don’t normally enter a lot of competitions, but we were looking for a challenge for our team on the side of the commissioned work. A project with a little more freedom that we could use to test some new software and workflows within the office.\n\nAs mentioned before, we have a strong interest in exploring the field of architecture for elderly people, which is the main reason for our participation in this topic. Additionally, competitions provide a valuable platform for young architects to express their opinions, which may be perceived as naive but are worthy of being heard.\n\nArchitecture competitions are like playgrounds where you must allow yourself to drift without a compass or a stopwatch. They provide opportunities to explore unknown paths, igniting our imaginations and thoughts. It's a chance to experiment with new scales, both in terms of design and the various ways in which it can be represented.\n\nI participate in architectural competitions because I believe it is a way to stimulate the creative mind. It presents new challenges with unique programs, uses, and locations. I enjoy witnessing the diverse proposals and ideas from other designers while also sharing my own.\n\nCompetition projects serve as the perfect laboratory for us to imagine and test new ideas, serving various purposes. For the organizer/initiator of the competition, we strive to present a different, unique, yet always fitting and realistic idea to address the challenges of the design brief.\n\nWe appreciate the fact that competitions contribute to the creation of new and high-quality projects. For the client, this means having access to multiple answers for a specific brief, which enhances the quality of the final design by validating it through various solutions.\n\nParticipating in architectural competitions is a form of expression, similar to painting or performing. It provides me with the opportunity to explore and interrogate exciting concepts while developing my design and representation skills. Particularly as I delve deeper into professional practice, competitions serve as a refreshing outlet that keeps me engaged with my curious nature.\n\nCompetitions provide a platform for architects to explore new concepts, technologies, and materials, encouraging creative and innovative thinking. For instance, in the \"Home of Shadow\" project, we discovered that the absence of natural light enhances the connection between humans and nature while deepening our understanding of low-carbon and sustainable development.\n\nAs students, architecture competitions provide us with a valuable opportunity to apply what we learn in a real-world context beyond the school environment. They allow us to take risks, engage in discussions, develop our ideas, and explore our own unique understanding of architecture.\n\nWe enjoy participating in architecture competitions because, to us, it feels like play. Regardless of the outcome, it is a wonderful experience to derive joy from the process of designing, particularly as a group of close friends.\n\nYou have the opportunity to challenge yourself to the maximum, refining and sharpening your skills, from the inception of the idea to the most expressive and honest way of conveying it. I have always believed that the anonymity offered by international architecture competitions is extremely important.\n\nArchitectural competitions challenge us to think beyond the everyday constraints of projects in our office and local conditions. We find this incredibly valuable for expanding our design process, thinking, and methods of working. Researching and considering new typologies and locations is invaluable for the growth of our practice and team.\n\nWe participate in competitions because it allows us to expand upon our own interests into new typologies. It gives us the ability to express our own individuality in a project that could otherwise be suppressed by hierarchical structures in a professional practice.\n\nCompetitions provide an ideal platform to nurture our creativity and explore new solutions. They allow us to discover new programs, develop innovative ideas, and break free from the constraints imposed by clients. Competitions enable us to be more radical, pushing us to develop concepts and ideas that may be more challenging and theoretical in nature.\n\nThrough gaining experience and building our portfolio, we cultivate self-motivation in our shared field of interest, potentially preparing ourselves to venture into our own business. Architecture competitions balance the conceptual image with the realization of construction, helping us maintain the necessary design sensitivity and stimulate our creativity.\n\nWe participate in competitions as they provide a great platform to stimulate and explore the creative potential of architecture. As recent graduates, competitions allow us to further develop and learn in a team-based environment, working within the parameters of the brief and critically questioning architectural processes and interventions.\n\nDuring our time as undergraduate students, participating in architecture competitions enabled us to immerse ourselves in the design world and develop valuable skills in collaboration, time management, and graphic representation. To this day, we continue to enter architecture competitions as a means of exploring experimental and unconventional design.\n\nParticipating in architecture competitions offers us a platform where our creativity knows no bounds and where opportunities abound, beyond the limitations of traditional design work. It allows us to imagine the unimaginable, delve into complex themes, and question the obvious, creating an exhilarating architectural journey.\n\nCompetitions are a good way to improve working on complex tasks in a short period of time. We chose this competition because we saw it as an opportunity to experiment with “bigness” and arrange an enormous density to a human scale.\n\nParticipating in competitions is a way of testing myself. It is one way to learn how to convince people, how to think of questions and restrictions, and to improve digital skills.\n\nParticipating in the various competitions that are now on offer allows me as a student to work on different phases/subjects that I have not yet explored. Moreover, it is a way to challenge myself individually. It is almost a way to reinterpret contemporary architecture to one's own perception, to push the ordinary to the extraordinary due to a certain form of freedom.\n\nIn the architecture contest, you encounter and challenge new things other than learning architecture at school. Team members review what they each learned in the design studio, apply and negotiate in a new way, and complete projects that could not be created alone. The whole process is not smooth and difficult, but there are definitely gains.\n\nArchitecture Competitions give me the opportunity to have a break from my everyday projects and express my architectural intentions more freely. Furthermore it gives me a more clear idea of that kind of architect I want to become and develop my creativity and my tools one step further.\n\nDesigning a spontaneous architecture, strong of meaning, uses and materiality. To explore new geographical territories, to research about construction systems and materials that we do not encounter in our projects. Discover and connect with cultures, different peoples, maintain way of thinking and know-how.\n\nArchitecture competitions are icebreakers, relieving the pressure to create something realistic to uncover magical ideas. One of the easiest things to do in design is to be stuck repeating what works, I believe the best work is often found outside that status quo. Competitions are opportunities to break that repetition.\n\nI participate in architecture competitions since the first year of my university. For me it is a way of challenging myself as an architect. Competitions provide me an opportunity to explore new design ideas and push boundaries beyond the constraints of a typical project. Additionally, participating in competitions is my way to engage and learn from architecture community.\n\nProjects for competitions are a manifesto of pure creativity. They appreciate the courage of thought, the unexpectedness of the ideas. The main point is to offer a bright, clear concept, and adaptation to the features of the real physical world is the following step. Which may not follow at all.\n\nIt is the first competition I have participated in. The topic that I worked on was very personal and I felt like I had something important to say. I am planning to take part in more competitions in the near future. I think that competitions give us the possibility to test new ideas and change the way we think and we design.\n\nWe believe that it is important to participate in competitions as a working professional, because they keep you tethered to the importance of design and narrative so that as you grow, you understand how pragmatic reality and conceptual design come together to help make you a more powerful thinker and competent maker as an architect.\n\nI participate in competitions partly to develop my skills in designing narrative spaces and to hone my craft in representation. Prompts I am drawn to exist outside of the reality of a traditional brief for a built project as they stimulate creative impetus in a way that is difficult to source outside of academia or intentional collectives.\n\nI participated in a competition because I enjoy contemplating interesting topics and expanding my perspectives. Additionally, when I see the works of others in the competition, it sparks my interest in new viewpoints and methods of expression that I may not have been aware of before.\n\nWe love to explore the world of architecture through unique themes. Especially in this competition, for us, the brief of Memorial for Witches is very interesting. This competition encourages us to build a strong idea about injustice uniquely.\n\nYou are given the chance to challenge yourself to the maximum, to refine and sharpen your skills, from the birth of the idea to the most expressive and honest way of transmitting it.\n\nJoining architecture competitions let us jump out of daily practice once a while and the process of brainstorming really provided us more inspiration and insights. Also, it made us pay more attention to the society around us and expanded the scope of architecture itself.\n\nI find it a good reason to flex your mind creatively and see where you stand in relation to the collective order of things within the profession. The fixed deadline and topic forces you to operate in a way as you would with a client but with much greater freedom.\n\nArchitecture competitions are a good way for me to prepare for later working life. They are also fun and a challenge because you always have a new task or topic to deal with over a certain period of time. I think you always acquire new skills and learn from them.\n\nI participate in architecture competitions because it can give a work direction, focus and a set time frame. I find this gives me a space and an arena to bring forward ideas that otherwise might continue to float around without ever reaching their full potential.\n\n\"Sometimes in the capitalist world it’s hard to bring your own voice while working on commercial projects. We, architects are lucky that there are available competitions where we can express our creativity and leave the commercial boundaries behind. For me right now it is a perfect way to explore my limits in an international context.\"\n\nWhile design assignments within schools often have a lot of rules and regulations, competitions allow us to maximize our whims. Participating in architecture competitions has helped us develop our passion for architectural design, so that we would not lose ourselves in rigid academic projects.\n\nCompetitions are opportunities to develop other ways of doing things and to reflect on subjects that differ from the demands of traditional sponsors. For the agency, this has always made it possible to freely explore fields of ideas and to shape new concepts.\n\nWe participate in architecture competitions to be able to test out our ideas and our will to create. Additionally, it provides us with a platform for not only exploration but also growth and put us in a critical condition. In academia, or even in practice, the brief and the learning outcomes are already set out prior. With architecture competitions, we can pick and choose what sort of briefs interests us.\n\nIt would take a good psychologist to know. Something magical and fascinating happens during architectural competitions. Just think of two people who have never met, do not speak the same language, live in different places, at different times, and despite this they communicate with each other.\n\nI think that it allows myself to go a step further and get out of the profile of projects that I have usually been able to face.\n\nThis is a new and exciting experience that differs from our usual workﬂow. Architects usually refer to participation in competitions as leaving their comfort zone. For us, in Ukraine in 2022, this competition was actually an opportunity to return to our comfort zone. A chance to practice our creativity and switch attention from the context of war we live in.\n\nWe both believe that an architecture competition is a great opportunity to challenge ourselves and work on designs that develop our creativity. They force us to respond to problems we might have never come across during our education or professional life as architects. Moreover, it is an opportunity to share ideas internationally and compare your work with other design propositions.\n\nI personally participate in competitions because it allow me to get out of my comfort zone and experiment with new challenges. By pushing myself to explore new ideas and approaches, I find new inspiration and approaches to design that I can bring back to my regular work.\n\nChallenges are an integral part of a designer's experience, and I believe that they are essential for growth and development. I find it particularly meaningful to tackle architectural design competitions, as they provide an opportunity to test my skills and creativity in a competitive environment.\n\nWe participate in competitions in order to work without too strict boundaries, but still within a given task and a set of goals. Competitions allow us to test and stretch rules to achieve a better solution in the context.\n\nIt was an exciting experience and the opportunity to convey ideas through the prism of your worldview. We've got out of our comfort zone in a way, had valuable interactions with the newly formed team, and enjoyed fascinating research and analysis of new information – everything we hoped to get out of the competition and more.\n\nIt would take a good psychologist to know. Something magical and fascinating happens during architectural competitions. Just think of two people who have never met, do not speak the same language, live in different places, at different times, and despite this they communicate with each other.\n\nWorking in competitions challenge me to jump out of my comfort zone. To work on projects that are in a different context than my usual work. It is also a great way to test out my skills in problem-solving and graphic communication.\n\nArchitecture competition is field of opportunity to testify your architectural knowledge and aesthetic perception through out rapid pace of design process. From this process, you can strengthen your design ability by exploring yourself to the ocean of idea that you have never experienced. Also, it is the best resource for us to express our design capability to the public.\n\nParticipating in competitions helps us make these discoveries. We exchanged existing design principles during these processes, discovered new design methodologies, and disputed new techniques and materials. Regarding architecture as a living organism, and giving each part of the building a definition in biology is the new methodology we found, and is effective for connecting each part.\n\nArchitectural competitions allow a sense of freedom to test my own ideas and inventions, free from client constraints and agendas of office life. To me, they provide the perfect training and challenge of my own architectural ability and provide a welcome break for architectural self-reflection.\n\nWe are extremely glad about this result, and we hope that this success will enable us to develop our collective. At the very least, the competition will help us create common basis for our urban and architectural approach, and debate about the shared values that we want to express across our architectural practice.\n\nThe competition presents us with a rare opportunity to broaden our design philosophy through the investigation of innovative architectural ideas and the resolution of new and diverse design challenges. At LMTLS, we view this competition as a platform for experimentation and a means to continually refine and evolve our design philosophy and approach.\n\nWe participate in architectural competitions to test ourselves on the international stage. During our studies, we mainly design in Poland. Competitions, especially international ones, allow us to encounter other cultures with different building and aesthetic needs.\n\nIt is an opportunity to challenge ourselves and think in unconventional ways, working with other themes, settings, and frames than what our common projects provide. It is not every day we are asked to design dwellings for bats for example.\n\nI wasn't entirely satisfied with my academic projects, and so external competitions were both a way of improving my skills in designing, and also served as an act of redemption to prove myself.\n\nParticipating in competitions allows me to focus on conceptual thinking. I always try to pick something new, a subject or a programme I haven’t had the chance to approach before, so I learn a lot in doing research this way. It is an excellent way to better your concept approach, learning about new technologies, adding a great project to your portfolio, etc.\n\nThrough architectural competitions, we can better, and to some extent more freely, show our creativity. Even many buildings that are diﬃcult to realize in real life can be boldly attempted in architectural competitions, which also promotes the development of the architectural industry to a certain extent and provides more possibilities for architectural design.\n\nWe think that entering an architecture competition like this means exploring new and innovative design ideas, without the constraints that other types of projects often have. It is very important to take advantage of the opportunity to discuss and study the most current themes of architectural research.\n\nBy participating in the competitions, it is great opportunity to go out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself. It can help broaden your horizons and creativity. By participating in international competitions, it is possible to learn and understand the wonders of the culture of other countries through their architecture.\n\nWe decided to participate in architecture competitions because it allows us to think creatively without any constraints, especially when we are faced with projects that might be out of our comfort zone. Therefore, we can have fun while also challenging ourselves to enhance our potential.\n\nPersonally, I see architecture competitions as an intellectual delight and a way to acknowledge and measure the current practices on an international basis. Also, it is a way to improve my skills of design and graphic representation and keep them at the sharpest level.\n\nArchitecture competitions of this nature allow anyone to challenge and provide a fresh approach to existing design dogmas. It is an incredible chance to step away from the conventional means of execution and present a diﬀerent perspective to a broader audience. It helps to facilitate change in the profession through exposure and discussion, as well as one’s own professional growth.\n\nIn our view, architecture competitions challenge their participants to reconsider their point of view and to find new ways of thinking and designing. They also give a chance to collaborate with professionals from different fields and gain new insights into the built environment.\n\nArchitecture competitions are a fun way to challenge our thinking and improve our skills. Participating in competitions gives us an opportunity to work with architecture without the constraints of permits, policies and regulations. It is fun to push the boundaries of what architecture can be.\n\nThis has been our first time participating in an architectural competition as a team. Although sometimes loosely based on reality, competitions let us go all-out and experiment with ideas and concepts we wouldn’t be able to carry out realistically.\n\nBy taking part in architectural competitions, we are given the opportunity of a different approach to each project, as there is a freedom in design that is often not affected by regulations, giving us the opportunity to expand our horizons and take our idea a step further.\n\nI believe participating in architecture competitions is a way for me to do more innovative thinking and get out from my comfort zone. It is challenging and fun at the same time.\n\nWe are 4 students from Cairo, Egypt. We are very passionate about architecture. It is a job and a hobby for most of us. We love participating in such competitions that stimulate creativity and discover new things through architectural elements. We enjoyed this competition very much.\n\nI think architecture competitions are very importante to chalenge my day to day work and take me out of my comfort zone. The start of a new project is always very exciting and the competition format, where we only get feedback in the end, makes it even more thriling.\n\nWe can think out of the box and try different kinds of concepts and new experiments. Thinking conceptually, applying new ideas and developing sketches into actual buildings and concepts – in some small measure, it is a feeling of the divine, because you are allowing something that was not there to be created. It appears later in its context, providing meaning and experience.\n\nWe like to challenge ourselves, work on something together and learn new skills and architecture competitions are a great way to do that. We also want to do more projects than we have on our studies and we have the freedom to do whatever project we want. Through team work we learn how to communicate and discover what we need in order to work our best.\n\nArchitecture competitions have two sides that make them attractive to us: on one hand, it is a way to democratize architecture by making everyone compete on the same level, and on the other hand, it is a way to go back to designing as it was done in the academy.\n\nArchitectural competitions are a great way to advance the understanding of architectural design with bold and free steps, and to discover new perspectives. It is a platform where anyone with a good idea, who wants to make a proposal for important issues about the world, contribute to the design literature, has equal rights and can share their ideas so that they can reach a large audience.\n\nWhat fascinates me about architecture competitions is the creative process. From the eager exploration of new cultures, sites and history to the absolute freedom to express oneself fully without constraints. Nonetheless, it's a great exercise for me to build confidence, express my ideas and engage in dialog with other architects around the world.\n\nCompetitions are fun but serious, short but have a lot to learn from, and most importantly are usually on new and most contemporary issues. Therefore, competitions are a great way for architects to gain experience, stay up to date, and greatly improve their skills in just a short period of time.\n\nHonestly, this is also the first time I participated in architecture competition, I hope to continue improving my design skills during my gap year, I think this is a good opportunity to let more professional practitioner see and comment on my design.\n\nTo me, every architecture competition is an uncharted journey and challenge. Competition help us think in a wider variety of perspectives that we never did before. I really like the main subject of microhome competition. The allowed buildable footprint is tiny but I don’t consider it as limitation. Instead, the restriction is the force triggering more creative and unthinkable imagination.\n\nIt is an opportunity to evaluate the creative and problem-solving abilities of our team, which go through the confrontation of our ideas with the rest of the contestants based on the objectives set. It is a pleasure for us to be able to be involved in events of this type, where important personalities from the field of architecture and design evaluate the solutions.\n\nI participate in architecture competitions because I’m a designer and these give me the opportunities to continue to improve on my creative skills. It gives me the opportunity to be as creative as I can be, get experimental, test the limits of what’s acceptable in architecture. It’s also an opportunity to continue to work on improving my skills in drafting, model making, etc.\n\nArchitectural competitions, such as this one, give us the opportunity to step out of our day-to-day routine and explore new concepts and ideas. They are the perfect way to boost our personal portfolios and get the desired recognition while increasing our creativity and imagination.\n\nThis is a chance to challenge yourself and level up your knowledge, skills and experience. Architectural competitions also provide you with networking opportunities due to the media exposure secured for the successful participants. Lastly, you get to see many like-minded individuals’ projects, which has to be inspirational for every designer.\n\nI have always appreciated the place of competitions in the architectural discourse. It is an opportunity to explore ideas and theories in a consequence-free environment and hone one’s concepts and aesthetics. I am seasoned professional looking to promote a new company. Winning recognition is amazing and will certainly help, but I strove to make work that could be used in promotion, regardless of results.\n\nWe participate in architecture vision competitions as our means to improve our creativity and skill sets. PMA is composed of designers that are longing to create a better environment through practical solutions. Despite our busy schedule, we always try to spare time to join competitions to give the opportunity especially for our junior staff to learn and grow.\n\nCompetition is a good way for us to test our thoughts and skills. It allows us to think outside of the box and envision how an idea can take off and be visualized in a short time-frame.\n\nIt’s a necessary exercise, both internally and externally of the profession, for designers to participate in an imaginative disciplinary dialogue. Having the possibility of a platform to share our ideas with others is also a great additional opportunity.\n\nAs we said above, we’re happy to take up new challenges: new context, new problem-solution setting, and new continents:) Win is fun, getting known in the new markets is great for business, but the key is learning and getting stronger after every new case - the skills we later apply for our work with Customers.\n\nIn the competition we can explore our creative thinking with certain themes that are prepared, and also we can see the different approaches from other participants in solving the same problems. Enrich our insight.\n\nI usually don't participate in competitions, but the topic of solving affordable housing (simultaneously with the problem of sprawl) is near and dear to me as someone who values nature's role in cities, and wishes for everyone to be able to live with dignity and comfort.\n\nWe participate in architecture competitions to improve our design knowledge and to challenge our ways of thinking. Through the speculative lens in which we propose solutions to a competition prompt, we often discover new ways of practicing that we tend to oversee. Combining this with exposure to real world project delivery, we’ve always learnt something new that we carry with us into future pursuits.\n\nI participate in architecture competitions because it stretches me past any perceived limitations. Through it I am able to explore the depth and breadth of my creativity and innovation. Using it as an expression of art, I am free to push all boundaries and really find that which lights me up. Through every competition I participate in, I come closer to truly expressing my soul through architecture.\n\nArchitectural competitions are a great opportunity to think outside the box, to let ideas run wild, and sometimes to express innovative ideas. It gives a sense of freedom that I think is essential for a creative career. I think it is excellent that there are more and more such competitions and that students can take part in them.\n\nThis is a chance to create an interesting concept not defined by money. And besides, this is a good opportunity to present our solutions to the many problems with which the world today is measured. Especially as young architects - it’s important to talk if you want to be heard.\n\nThrough competitions you are able to express yourself in a very raw and creative way – straight from your soul. An idea is growing without all the noise of daily (work-)life. Viewed upside down, it’s also a way of finding yourself by researching topics you identify with.\n\nParticipating in competitions is a way to challenge and express myself. There are not too many restrictions, there is more room to play, and the design will be more interesting. Seeing the designs of talented people also inspired me.\n\nArchitecture competitions are a great way to explore risky and unconventional ideas and communicate them to a larger audience. I see a lot of value in having the chance to share my work with people from around the world and hopefully start new conversations about it.\n\nMany international students participate for the BUILDNER’s architecture competition, and the panels and plans for the projects became so much inspiration to us. It has been very helpful for us to do the project and we have been interested in your competition for several years.\n\nBecause competitions not necessarily for architecture confront you with new things, you get out of your comfort zone and increase your abilities to solve current problems, that is, with each competition you raise your level of competitiveness.\n\nCompetitions are a way for me to sharpen my skills, develop new ones, and experiment. They also allow me to test my creative problem-solving skills through unconventional briefs I might otherwise not be exposed to.\n\nAs a lover of competition, participating in architecture contests seems like a great opportunity to train creativity and detach from everyday routine. A very important factor is also the visibility and the possibility of sharing projects with a much wider community, which especially in my case, as I am just out of university, is very important to start a professional career.\n\nIt is a great way to challenge yourself to find innovative and creative solutions to design problems. For this specific competition, the chance to explore and play with a virtual environment was very exciting for us. We felt very \"free\" throughout the process since the scope of the competition allowed us to experiment with different elements and go beyond limits.\n\nWe find competitions compelling and challenging. They are a great opportunity to sharpen our workflow and organizational skills, while tackling new and interesting topics. Our line of work is still developing and is very dependent on current trends, which is why it is easy to lose focus. Competitions require us to think and work fast, while retaining a sense of art direction.\n\nThis is our first architecture competition, and we wanted to participate in order to gain experience with this medium. We believe that architecture competitions are a great entry port to the real world of architecture. Open competitions have an important democratic function in helping young architects to show their work.\n\nWe consider competitions as a challenge to improve our creativity, a chance to get out of our comfort zone, a moment to experiment and learn about different structural, material, and formal subjects. What's more, we view competitions as a way to put ourselves in a more flexible design environment than the one we face in our daily jobs.\n\nCompetitions are opportunities for exploration and research that guide the architect to take a stand on a topic, contribute to rethink the ways in which humanity relates to the environment and how this can be improved/modified through architecture.\n\nExercise our design skills and test what we have learned. Expand our horizons and communicate with professionals. Competitions are a great way to help us explore new ideas for design, and we keep brainstorming,even with countless revisions and self-denials, the process is not painful, we are immersed in it, it is more like a kind of enjoyment.\n\nBy participating in competitions, it is possible to compare the reality of different people and their perception of a problem and its corresponding solution. It's a challenge to develop as an architect or designer and make a name for yourself.\n\nCompetitions are a little like fireworks. Shots in the dark that can result in something spectacular and unexpected. We see them as an opportunity to explore a topic, and quickly bring abstract thoughts and interests to fruition without some of the constraints other kinds of projects often have. They also give us room to create from our own raw sense of design.\n\nI love the themes and new directions which the competitions offer. They reflect the pressing problems of today, blending them with insights into future opportunities. It expands my horizons and pushes me to understand the role of an architect on a very large scale, globally.\n\nCompetitions could be a fascinating glimpse of being passionate, creative, experimental, more serious, and be desperate on something that you really care about. You don’t have to struggle with bureaucracy, budget, or worry being political means.\n\nCompetitions generate provocative thinking from worldwide perspectives, being in this process challenges me to learn and think on a more complex level upon every entry. For me, it helps to develop deeper knowledge and a broader vision in projects that tackle prominent issues, which is not often in professional or academic work.\n\nArchitecture should adapt contemporary trend and the user’s involvement. The competitions are the best chance to call the attentions to adaptive and parametric architecture, and let them see the future from our perspective. More importantly, participation in such competitions aims us to think universally and provides us with valuable experiences.\n\nIn the architecture contest, you encounter and challenge new things other than learning architecture at school. Team members review what they each learned in the design studio, apply and negotiate in a new way, and complete projects that could not be created alone. The whole process is not smooth and difficult, but there are definitely gains.\n\nWe saw architecture competitions as opportunities to challenge ourselves and explore possibilities. We have been practicing and developing our architectural theories during our studies at the university. By participating in the competitions, we can apply these theories in different scenarios and test out the feasibility.\n\nWe believe we are still on time to change things by making conscious decisions. So we take architectural competitions as a chance to make a statement, to show and tell our story and share our philosophy. We want to promote our vision of sustainable housing as a manifest for joy, nature, crafts, aesthetics, community and future resilience.\n\nBy taking part in design competition, we accept a challenge and opportunity to provide out of the box ideas for organisations looking for innovative solutions. Participation in architecture competition encourages us to push our limits, try on new ways of representing our ideas and break the norms of physical territoriality.\n\nWe participate in architecture competitions mainly to share our architecture and urban ideas and to check the level of our work against the background of the works of other participants. We like to work on creative topics that competitions give and try to think outside the box to make our projects more and more original.\n\nHere at Hortian Consultancy, we are constantly looking for opportunities to challenge ourselves, and to test ideas for its novelty and feasibility. By participating in architecture competition, we can also expand our view and perception on how different solutions are considered by different culture and society.\n\nWe participate in competitions to get out of the comfort zone. Competitions are always good opportunities to learn about other places and to extend our knowledge. They are challenging ourselves with contemporary issues and new ideas all over the world.\n\nArchitecture competitions are a great opportunity to train our creativity, make a statement, and present original ideas. However, it is also an opportunity to go beyond the boundaries, a great way to pump up the level of our skills and expertise, to realize the flight of our imagination.\n\nBecause of the possibility to develop ideas quickly. A good exercise to remind yourself that you do not always have to think about every screw. It is only about the effective transport of an idea.\n\nWe participate because it encourages us to explore and share some new perspectives about contemporary architecture, as well as the possibility of materializing these new ideas and to approach to other cultures. It also presents the opportunity to see the diversity and plurality of ideas developed under the same requirements.\n\nArchitecture competitions allow us the freedom to experiment with new ideas and techniques outside a scholastic setting. This removes any pressure from what the result ends up being, as well as allows us to improve our own ability to iterate and refine our designs. It helps us build critical thinking skills and better our time management.\n\nWe chose to participate in our first competition to test our skills, but also for fun. For us, studying architecture turned out to be a passion which we are lucky enough to carry out in our everyday life.\n\nWe love challenging ourselves, especially when facing original, creative, and out-of-the-box proposals. Taking part in architecture competitions is not only a great chance to improve your skills and show the world your ideas, but it is also a smart move career-wise, as it can be the first step when trying to make a name for yourself in the industry.\n\nArchitecture competitions are opportunities for us to test new ways of representation and design. As young architects, they also allow us to forge a work methodology and to sharpen our architectural discourse. Moreover, the competition subjects allow us to push concepts quite far, and to re-use the best of them in our work.\n\nIt is a way to challenge ourselves by competing with people from all over the world, whether they are students or professionals. Apart from learning new working methods that allow us to develop better as students and future architects.\n\nWe decide to participate in architecture competitions because we want to expand our horizons, think outside of the box, and fight creative burnout. We perceive competitions as a way of expressing and presenting our own ideas.\n\nTo push ourselves to our limits, to experiment as well as to develop our imagination in concepts with different needs, which we may not have a chance to encounter in our professional career.\n\nThis is the first competition District. has entered, it was borne out of a desire to test ourselves outside of our typical client constraints and look at how we could approach a brief without a known end user. We see competitions as a great opportunity to test ideas and explore concepts.\n\nDuring the war in Ukraine, we faced new challenges related to construction requirements. We saw that the current system is imperfect. At that time, we found the microhome competition and decided that it was a great opportunity to try to show what the solution to these problems could be.\n\nTo find out the answers I mentioned above, architects need to challenge themselves, to experiment with new strategies. Architecture competitions provide a platform for architects like me to show their understanding of these questions and discuss the durability of these experiments. That’s something practical architecture can never have.\n\nCompetitions are a different way of learning and exploring architecture. What I learn from my own project and from other projects can be my biggest motivation when not only the process, but also the results are released.\n\n\"Participation in architecture competitions is an opportunity to promote and emphasize the value of interdisciplinary practice. Architecture competitions bring everyone together at the table, bring visibility and voice to diverse perspectives, and bring out the creative spark within each of us.\"\n\n\"Competitions are an amazing intellectual exercise which give us the opportunity to explore architecture in its pure form without any practical and mental boundaries. They give us the opportunity to talk with our inner self, to work on our decision-making, and fight our self-doubt. It is a battle against ourselves.\"\n\n\"For me, architecture competitions are the purest essence of our work. They are fields in which to try out our ideas, to stretch and broaden our way of thinking, to try something new, and to say something we are usually not in a position to say. Fields to explore and play. Pure joy! (If it results with a prize or realisation – even better, of course.)\"\n\n\"As a recent graduate working in the industry, I participate in competitions to further develop my creative and design skill set. Competitions have also provided unique briefs and typologies that are intriguing as they aren’t as common in everyday practice. This has given me the freedom to explore new ideas, think outside the box, and not be afraid to be innovative. It is a way of fulfilling my creative passion for architecture as a young designer.\"\n\n\"Competitions are an opportunity to make a statement, to be critical, and to show an alternative to traditional methods and material. It is an opportunity to be educated and use new tools. It is a way to be involved with projects and topics that are not being practised in the daily routine; at the same time, working on a competition enriches other projects that run parallel.\"\n\n\"Competitions/contests are not part of the architecture studies, I therefore wanted to take part in one as soon as possible to gain experience. Discovering (new) subjects, each one more varied than the others, while having the freedom to give an answer true to myself. And then to see how other participants responded is very enriching.\"\n\n\"Competing in architecture grants freedom, which would not be possible in other ways. It urges you to really try to find the strongest ideas that a site and environments stimulate. There are many other competitors, and it is necessary to find something unique, which is worthy to base the design upon. For us the thrill of this procedure is what made us compete in our first nationwide architectural competition.\"\n\n\"Competitions provide an opportunity for practitioners to speculate freely and dream outside of the constraints of client work – often in areas of practice and/or at scales of work that we have yet to explore in daily practice. Competitions also provide a means for emerging practitioners to demonstrate competency and garner recognition.\"\n\n\"Architecture competitions provide a great venue for experimentation and development of our skills as well as the opportunity to test our ideas among other individuals who have a similar motive. It is a means of learning how to communicate our work with the world.\"\n\n\"Participating in architectural competitions for me is a great way to gain experience in formulating and sharpening ideas and architectural concepts, practicing the skills necessary to translate my ideas and it is essentially what I love doing most: Problem-solving and inventing things.\"\n\n\"Participating in architectural competitions takes us out of the daily routine and gives us the opportunity to play in new fields that cannot be experienced much in the world of practical work. Moreover, we see competitions as an opportunity to interact with each other and explore our wildest ideas, with a chance to win. What could be more exciting than this?\"\n\n\"It’s an opportunity for me to set aside my day-to-day routine and try out new thoughts that I didn’t get a chance to explore. And I believe that as architects, besides providing our professional service to the client, we have a social responsibility as designers to create environments that are not just for aesthetics but beyond.\"\n\n\"We participate in architectural competitions to feed our desire to explore idseas without the bounds of a commercial or corporate setting and use the process as a speculative steppingstone towards a one day built destination. But most of all because we enjoy designing.\"\n\n\"We believe that various architecture competitions are an opportunity to explore further a variety of different topics as well as to experience an adventure. It is a great chance to work in different settings with your team and learn new skills from each other.\"\n\n\"I cannot avoid feeling the pull to participate when a particularly challenging brief stimulates my interest and triggers the design process. Architecture competitions give me the chance to express my personal point of view regarding a specific topic, to challenge my creativity and technical skills without hard boundaries, strict budgets, or by having to get down to compromise; all situations that often recurs during work life. It is a liberating process that helps me to get in touch with myself.\"\n\n\"We find great benefit in competition work. Each allows for some level of experimentation that invigorates our ongoing design conversations. The freedom from typical project constraints and the excitement around a new challenge a design school studio like atmosphere. We use it as a vehicle to challenge ourselves, try new processes and techniques, research construction typologies and test software. We think of it as a development platform for design staff and a way to bolster our design culture.\"\n\n\"Architectural competitions proved to be one of the best methods for me to develop as an architect. The knowledge gained by constantly refining and tweaking ideas, and how to present them, proves to be useful in my academic and professional work every day. To this, competitions are a great way to collaborate and reach out to the architecture world. Ultimately, they are the most exciting and fun projects to be a part of!\"\n\n\"We, after working in architectural filed in our country and participating in internal competition, we felt to be in challenges of international competitions and certainly we will be witness of the positive effect of this issue in our professional work.\"\n\n\"Architectural competitions are a good opportunity to improve various skills from an idea to its presentation. It is also interesting to see the approach of other teams and how diverse solutions can be within the same brief.\"\n\n\"We hope to utter our thoughts on the prospective developments of an architectural typology of office space in the post-pandemic era. Our proposal does not aim to give a decisive spatial solution but instead challenges the conventional office design and raises discussions toward the relationship between individual workplace and common space in the modern metropolis.\"\n\n\"As explained earlier, as an architect, we have been interested in otherized and capitalized spaces. In particular, our team thought that the existing way of working and domestic space intensifies the problems of the current capitalist society. We participated in this competition to think about how our society should change beyond how the relationship between two programs should change in the future.\"\n\n\"We participate in architecture competitions to test our ideas, skillsets and challenge our preconceived concepts of what has been done and how we can do it differently - it gives us the perfect platform to test daring / radical ideas.\"\n\n\"We participate in architecture competitions in order to test out ideas, and concretise the goals of our future practice. Architecture competitions allow freedom from real-life constraints such as regulatory and budget demands, while also setting up an ideas-led brief to create the basis for the testing ground.\"\n\n\"Architectural competitions can take you out of your comfort zone and present challenges, locations and opportunities you may never have encountered normally. In response you can develop new skills and ideas previously unconceivable. These are be invaluable for broadening your understanding of architecture and be further developed over time.\"\n\n\"It is not every day, an Architect get a chance to face an exciting design challenge. It is a learning experience. An opportunity to tackle and solve different societal issues by way of architecture. Get excited. Be stimulated. Discover things that could improve status quo. Get recognized. And possibly, share a meaningful contribution to society through your winning solution.\"\n\n\"11 years. 35 competitions. 30 didn’t make it. 1 win. 3 honourable mentions. Now 1 up. Many years of controlled disappointments. Yet fondness is found where “fail” is at its most spectacular. “We could say that competitions are to everyday architecture what competitive sport is to everyday fitness training.” – Farshid Moussavi, writing on competitions in Architectural Review in 2013. A chance to go beyond what architecture is, but what architecture can be. The desk top at night. Clicks, saves; tools and trials. Restart.\"\n\n\"As young architects, architectural competitions give us opportunities to broaden ideas and it is a great exercise for us to use what we have learned in university to apply in real-life scenarios. It escalates our passion, raises our inspirations and makes us eager to attend more. Participating in competitions not only makes us learn more but also seeing other previous projects of other participants widen our perspectives towards architecture.\"\n\n\"Competitions provide an opportunity for practitioners to speculate freely and dream outside of the constraints of client work – often in areas of practice and/or at scales of work that we have yet to explore in daily practice. Competitions also provide a means for emerging practitioners to demonstrate competency and garner recognition.\"\n\n\"Architecture competitions are a way to challenge ourselves with problems that are far from our surroundings. It is a way to gather knowledge about problems all around the world, get educated about different cultures, history and ways of life. We are constantly seeking intriguing briefs from all around the world in order to further augment our academic development.\"\n\n\"Participating in competitions is a way to test ourselves and deal with new and unknown themes. These are opportunities for competition and research, which allow us to get to know places, cultures and new ideas. Participation in competitions is also a way to interact with other designers, to understand how they have faced the same theme. We think this is very stimulating for our cultural and professional growth.\"\n\n\"Architecture competitions provide a unique platform to design and propose exciting innovative project, while testing theoretical ideas in a structured setting. Apart form any constraints imposed by the brief, competitions like this one, allow complete freedom to express new design styles, and typologies. The great thing also about participating in a competition is that if you are lucky enough to win, the client has already bought into your vision, therefore the next stage would be working together with the client to realize the design.\"\n\n\"We participate in architectural competitions as they provide us a platform to experiment with new ideas. We can express ourselves and work with different design issues that we don’t come across everyday. We also enjoy that we can experience working on projects in different parts of the world.\"\n\n\"Competitions usually have fewer design restrictions than other types of architectural work. It gives you the liberty to look at things from a different angle and you have the chance to come up with unconventional solutions. We belief this practice is important to generate innovation and we enjoy being part of it.\"\n\n\"We look for the stimulation that architectural creation brings. We enjoy challenging ourselves on subjects that we do not encounter in our daily practice. It is an excellent way of putting forward values that we share and that we hold dear.\"\n\n\"It is a great avenue for exploring new conceptual territory that our everyday design and architecture projects may not always afford us. It isn't so much about the accolades or monetary gains, as it is the ability to participate in the design process, the purity of creation and the idea of connecting with like minded individuals in this socially distanced world.\"\n\n\"We believe that participating in design competitions is essential to building community. The creative process that takes form in a competition is unique and refreshing. It allows us to stretch various design muscles, engage in new design ideas, and innovate in areas outside of our usual practice.\"\n\n\"It is a place not only for people to find out about your work but also to create a community with other architects, designers and independent creatives. These events and platforms are a valuable source of information of what is happening all around the world and the local solutions given to global problems.\"\n\n\"We don’t do a lot of competitions. This Birdhome competition is actually the only one we have done in the past two years. We have applied for a very specific reason: one of the founder of Cutwork (Antonin Yuji Maeno) is a bird watcher since he is 8 years old, and has always dreamt of designing a bird home; this was the occasion.\"\n\n\"Making a project is just like making a puzzle with infinite solutions in the eyes of everyone, but just a few solutions in your eyes. A competition is also that, a puzzle to be solved, but it’s even more enjoyable because at the end you can see all those infinite answers that you dismissed or didn’t think about. Why do I participate in architecture competitions? To challenge myself and to learn from others.\"\n\n\"The main reason why I participate in architectural competitions is , that allows me to try and reflect on new fundamental conceptual ideas, as well as to understand and refine my creative process by experimenting with different tools and methods. This is good opportunity to get to know yourself and to look at the surrounding whole.\"\n\n\"This was my first time I ever evolved into an international architectural competition. I was looking for something new after several years of working on multiple projects, sometimes at the same time.\"\n\n\"We find it necessary to participate in architecture competitions as they offer a chance to exercise and challenge our design capability within a limited time frame. They can also provide a diverse and interesting array of briefs that are not normally on offer to us professionally.\"\n\n\"I participate in architecture competition for a number of reasons. Firstly, I enjoy the thinking process, the search for solutions to different challenges that the competitions provides. Secondly, they test and at the same time, they expand my view about design, helping me to evolve my practice.\"\n\n\"Within such a competitive field as architecture, engaging in competitions, challenges us at a professional and individual level. It is an opportunity to test new concepts and ideas and to foster our creativity. On one hand, it gives us the ability to learn from our mistakes and on the other hand to gain confidence with the several challenges we overcome.\"\n\n\"We wanted to participate in architecture competitions because we think it is a great opportunity to challenge ourselves with new design problems outside of school. It allows us to truly exercise our creativity by testing the new concepts and ideas that we have. We are able to learn from the process by thinking through and solving the challenges. It’s a learning process for all of us.\"\n\n\"We wanted to gain more experience outside of the academic realm, but most importantly we wanted to test how we work as a team and gain more collaborative experience. We felt that architectural competitions force you to continuously make decisions that are tangible, which can get lost in academic projects. Those restrictions enable at the same time a different form of freedom and challenge for the creative process.\"\n\n\"We participate in architecture competitions to consider how design can resolve social issues the world over. We participate in architecture competitions to exercise a creative freedom through which we can gain a better understanding of contemporary issues that the profession must deal with.\"\n\n\"Since the projects ATO is working on are constricted due to client’s budget and regulations, participating in competitions is a way to keep being innovative. They are the opportunity to keep on working on conceptual approaches and being more sensitive and poetic. The idea is, little by little, to merge the conceptual approach and the real-life constraints.\"\n\n\"For us, this is an opportunity to challenge ourselves. It is a way to express some ideas you are insecure about; it is easier to let go and create without holding back. This is not always possible in your work or study projects.\"\n\n\"Architecture competitions give us a lot of adrenaline. We can face our weaknesses and love sharing our time together, taking up ambitious activities. After the deadline we always have a feeling that we could explore the issue more, which leaves us even more motivated and curious.\"\n\n\"We believe that competitions are a way to measure and create a dialogue with worldwide professionals. We believe that it is important to show our reflections on architecture, our way of approaching it, and the meaning it has for us.\"\n\n\"We participate in competitions because we have fun with it, and we really enjoy the process of creating architecture. The opportunities and freedom to design are unlimited, and having the opportunity of being recognized afterwards makes it more exciting!\"\n\n\"Why participate in architecture competitions? Competitions help us develop our position towards architecture and potentially also give us some public exposure. This really helps in the process of setting up a company. In the best case, obviously, the project also gets built.\"\n\n\"Apart from obvious reasons, I become interested in a particular topic or brief. In the case of the Monte D’oiro Hotel, it was a challenge to continue the previous studies of wine architecture in the low-density suburban environment. Whenever I see an objective that interests me, I start thinking. If I can’t stop thinking, I participate.\"\n\n\"Architectural contests provide the opportunity to design and propose novel ideas; they place no restrictions on creativity and allow for complete freedom of expression in terms of design. They also present the architect with a special kind of client: an absent one. What better challenge for an architect?\"\n\n\"We can think outside the box and try different kinds of concepts and experiments. Thinking conceptually, applying new ideas, and developing sketches into actual buildings and concepts – in some small measure, it is a feeling of the divine, because you are allowing something that was not there to be created. It appears later in its context, providing meaning and experience.\"\n\n\"We participate in architecture competitions for the thrill of it. Even if the odds of winning are slim, it’s a great experience to give something your whole attention and engage the whole process of envisioning a piece of architecture. This is something that can become quite rare or difficult to achieve in professional practice. The arena of the competition lets you tune out the noise of the world.\"\n\n\"With every new competition I decide to participate in, I am really interested in penetrating new horizons. It is a great way of entering new sectors and learning about countries where I may not have worked yet. It is clear that by their merit-based nature, competitions push architects to cross new creative thresholds. I consider it a great exercise in delivering ambitious ideas while also aligning with realistically achievable results.\"\n\n\"Participating in competitions is a great learning opportunity. Different tasks can develop creativity, skills, and knowledge. Often, there are aspects of the architecture tasks that are unfamiliar to us, which gives us the opportunity to learn something new. It’s also a great way to learn some soft skills, such as time management, teamwork, creative thinking, conflict re"
