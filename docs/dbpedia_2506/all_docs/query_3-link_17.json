        "text": "Dr. Nina Mouledous joined the AVMA Trust as a Trust Representative on June 23, 2008. Dr. Mouledous speaks to AVMA members insured through the PLIT-sponsored programs, answering questions related to malpractice allegations and practice situations. She reviews professional liability claims, assists in the defense by identifying experts and appraisers, and advises the insurance broker and underwriters about new developments in veterinary medicine. Additionally, Dr. Mouledous visits several colleges of veterinary medicine in the United States, represents the AVMA Trust at various veterinary conventions and speaking engagements each year, and contributes to AVMA Trust publications.\n\nBefore joining the AVMA Trust, Dr. Mouledous was the owner and sole practitioner for nineteen years of Equine Veterinary Services, Ltd, a mobile equine practice that specialized in Thoroughbred racehorses at Hawthorne Race Course (Chicago, Illinois) and Arlington Park (Arlington Heights, Illinois). In addition to her practice, Dr. Mouledous developed a trap-neuter-release program at the race tracks to help control the feral cat population. She also mentored pre-veterinary students during the summer.\n\nDr. Mouledous is a 1985 graduate of Louisiana State University, School of Veterinary Medicine. Born and raised in New Orleans, Dr. Mouledous secured her first job as an associate veterinarian at a unique small animal, exotic, and equine practice in the French Quarter. Four years later, she relocated to Chicago and started her equine practice in 1989. During her career, Dr. Mouledous has served as a consulting veterinarian for the Illinois Thoroughbred Breeders and Owners Foundation as well as a board member for the Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protection Association.\n\n“I am very excited to begin my new career with the AVMA Trust,” said Dr. Mouledous. “I am proud to help my fellow veterinarians protect their reputations and to enhance the image of the veterinary profession.”\n\nDr. Mouledous and her family reside in Downers Grove, Illinois.
