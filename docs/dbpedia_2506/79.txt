Is more than an hope for the future... and is Teddy's full sister, sharing the same inquisitive, outgoing, and loving temperament. Nina correctly identifies with the breed standard and she is a marvellous example of the breed and our breeding program. She was shown in Finland during the summer 2004 obtaining the Finnish title in a weekend - three shows in a row! Thank you to all my friends that made it possible... She's now also Italian, Italian Club Champion and International Champion (under FCI approval).
