        "text": "The key moment in Terminator 2: Judgement Day – where the audience learns that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a good guy – comes early on in the movie when a teenage John Connor encounters the T-800 in a back hallway of a shopping mall. The Terminator is carrying a long boxes of roses that he drops to the ground to reveal a hidden shotgun. Connor thinks the killer robot is about to murder him, but instead he tells him to duck and begins firing at the liquid metal T-1000. Had the trailer not ruined the twist, it would have been quite a shock to most people since Arnold was the villain in the original.\n\nTrending\n\nThe T-800’s long box of guns and roses was actually the third GN’R reference in that movie up to that point. When we first meet John Connor and his friend Tim (best known to 1990s kids as Bobby Budnick on Salute Your Shorts) they’re playing “You Could Be Mine” while fixing up his moped. Tim is wearing an L.A. Guns shirt, lead by original GN’R guitarist Tracii Guns. They had a minor hit the previous year with “The Ballad of Jayne,” but even at their peak they were only a tiny fraction as popular as Guns N’ Roses. Use Your Illusion was still a couple months away from hitting shelves when Terminator 2: Judgement Day came out, but anticipation was very high. Having the leadoff single on the soundtrack to the biggest movie of the summer was the perfect way to set it up."
