        "text": "I can remember sitting in the Majestic Theater in 1984 in the upper seating gallery with a group of 3rd form students whom as a senior student I was supervising at the time and had taken to watch a movie as an example of creative science fiction - can you believe this - as an \"English\" exercise. It was an act of pure rebellion at its best and to this day I do not regret it.\n\nThe Majestic Theater was a grand old building on Willis Street in Wellington that had faded badly by the time we had taken our seats and was tired, old and its projection equipment nearly about to be completely made redundant by recent advances both in terms of video technology and sound.\n\nThe interior was an exquisite example of urban decay, in today's current necrotic fashion trends it was a triumph of shabby chic in every way. It had a two story high, fading, old thick purple and red velvet curtain that framed a similarly sized screen surrounded by a mix of Deco decoration and Byzantine detailing.\n\nThe place smelled of stale popcorn, mothballs, mould and the musty overtones of hard use over many years.\n\nThe seats were narrow, the faded and frayed green patterned fleur de lis fabric stretched and stained. Each chair squeaked when the seat cushions were folded down and creaked when you shifted your weight.\n\nThe rows were elevated and arrayed to position each chair in the spaces between and above the ones immediately in front, the aisles were narrow to maximise seating, the ornate steel feet beneath each chair stuck out past the edge of the seat, an ever present trip hazard.\n\nFading decorative embellishments and peeling embossed red wall paper combined with bizarre floral plaster wall decorations, proliferating across the walls in both the upstairs and downstairs seating area. The cherubs and decorations on the walls had flaking gold and silver paint and there was a large brooding chandelier in the center of the ceiling, which when the lights came up was only half lit, most of the bulbs on it were dead and dark and covered in cobwebs.\n\nDust motes spun and danced in the space between the projection room and the screen, drifting into and out of the light beam from the projectors, carried on drafts of air from badly sealed doors around the periphery of the theatre.\n\nThe decayed state of the building and its fixtures were a dark tribute to the glory days that had preceded that specific attendance, you had no choice but to love it and I am sure that Miss Havisham would definitely have approved. I certainly did.\n\nIt was a magical place, and as a kid of 16 years old going on 17 it represented a space to me where I could escape from reality, where I could put my feet up on the back of the vacant chair in front of me and immerse myself in something larger, something outside of my own teenage angst, anger and hormones, if only for a couple of hours.\n\nI first saw 2001 A Space Odyssey in that theater and was introduced to the incredible physicality of Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon. I can remember seeing Blade Runner there and thinking at the time, there is no way we could possibly ruin the planet that completely and do that to ourselves in the future. (I could comment sarcastically and at length here but I think its best if I don't).\n\nIt's probably highly prophetic looking back now given the climate change and political insanity that surrounds us that the very last movie I saw in that place before they demolished it was Apocalypse Now.\n\nIt's hard to imagine, but Wellington in 1984 was largely still low rise, full of character and much better for it.\n\nThe Majestic Theater stood adjacent to the Evening Post building on Willis St, a massive labyrinth of multiply connected offices on several levels across three buildings, humming with industry, its heavy printing presses thumping and rolling as they printed tomorrows edition in the basement.\n\nThe building above the printing presses was a hive of activity full of corridors echoing to the sounds of IBM golf ball typewriters producing copy for the evening editions news and old school analogue phones ringing on desks.\n\nThe vibration from the presses running underground next door could be felt through the seats in the auditorium of the Majestic Theater, a harmonic vibration resonating through the wooden floors and vaulted fake domed ceiling, as we sat facing the screen and I had to remind 26 very excited 14 year old boys to quieten down for the fourth time, as the light flickering from the single remaining operational bulb in the chandelier began to unevenly fade and the other yellowing house lights slowly dimmed.\n\nThere was a moment in that theater on that day, a single point in time, between the transition from a lit decaying room to a darkened space, when the huge velvet curtains sluggishly drew back further from the screen in a superfluous and pointless show of drapery, a moment of sudden silence and stillness in an otherwise empty vast space.\n\nAnd in that moment as the screen started to light up and the opening music began to play on the tired distorted, sound system the hair on the back of my neck started to rise.\n\nIt was a vast and metallic synthesized sound, a syncopated strangely digital rhythmic pulse which rose as an ominous crescendo, something only a space like the Majestic Theater could lend character to.\n\nIt was a mechanical heartbeat, a fitting start to a prophetic piece of movie making, a movie featuring concepts that in 1984 predated AI, predated the Internet and mainstream robotics being much more than car assembly systems on production lines.\n\nAnd the movie? If you are a film buff you may have already guessed based on image on this article, Mr James Cameron's opus to a future where AI has decided to kill off the Human Race, The Terminator.\n\nThe film vehicle that propelled Arnold Schwarzenegger's career in film, a B grade movie which was a novelty back then but is even far more relevant now than when it was first released.\n\nI was stunned, this was a vision of a totally alternative future where computers had destroyed everything, completely unlike Blade Runner where humanity embarked on creating limited lifespan clones as slave labor to mine resources and fight on other worlds.\n\nThe Terminator predicted a future where humanity had coded and built a self-aware machine (AI)connected to everything using a massive loosely coupled network, (sound familiar, it should, we call it the Internet), that in a nanosecond decided to wipe out its only real predator, people and used the weapon systems it was plugged into to do so.\n\nWorse, the same AI had cloned human flesh over the top of a robotic chassis and installed another AI which was able to specifically use facial, vocal, pheromone and pattern recognition to identify targets and eliminate them. A robot with bad breath that could sweat and bleed.\n\nThis film was a tour de-force, a ground breaking B grade film that should never have been made but which was and which ever since has defined our views on the risks posed by Artificial Intelligence.\n\nThis is the same film which has now been entered into the Library of Congress for inclusion for preservation in the National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nBut none of that had even begun to happen yet as I sat in a decaying theater in Wellington somewhere between the ages of 16-17 and watched in disbelief with a shocked group of 14 year old boys whilst a machine clothed in human skin and driven by a homicidal AI used all kinds of smart technology to hunt, track and coldly eliminate its prey.\n\nThe Terminator predicted technology which some of us now regard as standard practice in the world we live and work in. Even the laser sight on the 9mm long slide handgun used in the movie did not exist when the movie was made, ( it does now).\n\nSo fast forward, present day, the Majestic Theater is long gone. In the 34 years since I first saw that movie in that strange dilapidated theater and witnessed a vision of a future where an AI had nearly wiped out humanity and then constructed a bio-mechanical self-determining cyborg to specifically target and kill individuals in the past to prevent people from being born, I have seen the very technologies that that this film predicted being developed in the workplace around me.\n\nThe images of how the Terminator \"saw\" its world are eerily similar to the machine vision and AI systems that I have worked with and seen developed over the last two years. LIDAR and thermal imaging are not science fiction, but real world machine vision tools, visual recognition software backed by AI is not a fantasy I have participated in its development and use case establishment.\n\nAnd 34 years later here we are, we stand on the brink of the next evolution in AI self-awareness and Robotics and we are totally unprepared socially, legally and ethically to deal with it. It is an issue, and we need to start seriously working through its implications.\n\nEven the United Nations is so concerned that they have now developed policy to deal with Lethal Autonomous Weapon systems.\n\nWe have to face a future where many professions including military service, become the domain of AI and machines. The question is how do we structure our society to deal with this, how do we program a robotic soldier to exhibit compassion?\n\nCrime is about to be disrupted, with advances in AI the next evolution in criminal behaviour may not be human, will be unbelievably fast and very efficient.\n\nMachines at the moment cannot interpret non quantifiable events or implied danger, and they do not feel anything, \"not fear, or pain, or pity, or remorse\".\n\nYou or I may intuit based on our experience and life events that a situation could be a problem but for AI currently decisions and learning are undertaken based entirely on quantifiable inputs.\n\nThis may change when we wet wire and fuse AI and onboard computers into our own cerebral cortex, you have to wonder what is going to happen when we fuse human brain matter and computers, when we create a biological AI?\n\nThe question I have heard asked is how does a self-driving machine in a situation where it has a choice to hit a small child or an old person decide what to do if there are no other options for it to take but to hit one of them? The simple answer is that this problem is irrelevant. What decision would a normal person make?\n\nThe problem is a pointless academic abstraction, trying to stop hitting anyone or anything is expected.\n\nDifferential decision making like that is not something that can be programmed - yet and maybe it never should be. If a machine can think and learn and emote then I would argue it is no longer a machine. How do we regulate this ?\n\nAt what point do we say that it is as unacceptable to mis-treat an AI as it is to do so to a non - AI ? Our track record as a species so far would suggest to me that we can't cope with this yet. Look at the millions of displaced people in the world today. Consider ongoing acts of genocide, war, violence and forced labour that as a species we perpetrate on each other for commercial and personal gain. Slavery was not abolished, it was simply modernized.\n\nWhat happens when we fuse human brain matter and computers, when like the Terminator we create a cyborg biological learning AI?\n\nCurrently the military around the world are going to great lengths to maintain manual control over certain types of armaments. This is because in a worst case scenario an AI controlling these things could cause a catastrophic event purely because it may decide that the scenario calls for it.\n\nIf autonomous weapon systems are ever deployed with AI that becomes self-aware and in charge of nukes, we could be an endangered species. The Skynet scenario is not unreasonable, Cameron was right it is one possible outcome.\n\nDon't get me wrong here - it's not all bad, there is a lot of very good things that this robotic revolution can do in healthcare, community services, emergency response and in a whole raft of socially positive outcomes.\n\nAutonomous driving could seriously reduce the need for people to own cars and be better for the planet, robotics can help people with disabilities and accidents on roads will become a rarity if we all use autonomous cars.\n\nHowever we need to make sure that the net result is that we do not get to a point either where these machines become crutches that we all need to lean on.\n\nWe need to spend more time on moral evaluations of what we are doing and not be blinded by the technology we create and all the possible outcomes it could lead to even if some of these may be unpalatable.\n\nSometimes we are so busy trying to prove that we can achieve something, when in fact we should be really asking the question should we be doing this at all?\n\nI am reminded of Albert Einstein whom once famously said in an interview with Newsweek: \"had I known that the Germans would not succeed in developing an atomic bomb, I would have done nothing.\"\n\nHis only and single act in the entire nuclear arms race was to send a letter to the President of the United States warning about the German Nuclear program.\n\nThe tragedy of this is that had he not sent that letter no weapons would have been used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, something Einstein regretted deeply most of his life.\n\nThen there was the famous reaction of Robert Oppenheimer, whom headed the team developing these weapons.\n\nThe first atomic bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945, in New Mexico, Oppenheimer later quoted from the Bhagavhad Gita: \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds\".\n\nBoth men were geniuses and both men are responsible indirectly for contributing to weapons which killed over 200,000 unarmed and relatively defenseless people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n(According to some commentators, the war had effectively been won and Japan was on its knees, there was no justifiable reason to use those weapons).\n\nI don't think we really understand what we are unleashing nor do I think we fully comprehend what the results will be.\n\nJames Cameron however did and in 1984 he put it up on the silver screen for us to watch.\n\nAnd so in 1984 when the movie ended and the lights apathetically came back up in a dusty, tired and faded theater in Wellington, our little group of normally loud, obnoxious 14 year old boys filed in total silence out of the Majestic Theater.\n\nAs we stepped out of the theater and back into the light and sound of a bustling Willis St, the movie's impact faded and the future seemed full of possibilities and the promise of a better world that technology could bring us.\n\nI saw the film again yesterday and in 2019 its as fresh as it was in 1984.\n\nI strongly suggest you watch it again."
