        "text": "COLOSSUS OF ROADS\n\nI wrote this song in one sitting after hearing about the Club Q shooting in Colorado. I sat on the couch and cried and wrote this. It is my love song to queerness and outsider culture existing amidst violence. This work is a collage of hobo art references (buZ blurr: The Colossus of Roads, also grease marker writings on oil cans) radical poetry (Eileen Myles: I Must Be Living Twice). My favorite song of mine to date: this one is sacred to me.\n\nHold my head like a live wire,\n\nDuck quick now I hear gunfire.\n\nCaught somewhere in the space between\n\nDo you love me and do you love me?\n\nEverything is advancing,\n\nI love to see you out dancing.\n\nThere's women up in the mountains,\n\nWe could be up there if we could get up there.\n\nSay goodbye to America,\n\nI wanna see it dissolve.\n\nI can be your poster boy for the great American fall.\n\nNow I'm out and I'm prowling,\n\nYou make me wanna start growling.\n\nYou will live forever as this bombshell\n\nIn my mind.\n\nI know that it's dangerous,\n\nBut I wanna see you undress.\n\nWrap you up in the bomb shelter\n\nOf my feather bed.\n\nEileen, I must be living twice.\n\nColossus of roads, buZ blurr in the night.\n\nCowboy hat and a cigarette,\n\nGrease marker in my leather vest.\n\nLet's go paint the oil cans,\n\nWrite our names on a grain of sand.\n\nNo one will remember us,\n\nLike I will remember us.\n\nMeet me down in the Castro,\n\nWe'll pretend it's 1985.\n\nBefore we were a twinkle,\n\nIn our great grandfather's eyes.\n\nChildren forever!\n\nIn the end\n\nOf the night, baby\n\nOf the night.\n\nIn the night, baby\n\nIn the night.\n\nSNAKE PLANT (The Past is Still Alive)\n\nA memory box in a song, the first verse is about my father driving my aunt, brother, and me down to Florida every summer in a minivan. We would stay in Florida for a month or so and visit my grandfather and aunts. I have very potent memories of hot summers and trespassing onto farms that weren’t ours so my grandfather could brag and show me livestock that actually belonged to his boss. My first experience with hurricanes: my father would joke he was going to tie me and him up to the big tree outside and we would ride out the storm together. Many moments alone listening to music, dreaming up what I wanted my life to be, dreaming up my getaway. The rest is what I found out in the world: community, grief, love, passion, death. I always wanted to write my version of Dylan’s “I Was Young When I Left Home,” and this is it.\n\nSnake plant, Florida water\n\nI only wanted ever to be a good daughter\n\nSoft hands, gold rings\n\nTry to remember most everything.\n\nLike feeding grapefruits to the cows,\n\nHold my belly while I'm laughing out loud.\n\nA bathing suit on a two-day drive,\n\nMalaria, you can't sleep at night.\n\nLemon tree and a mango for the baby,\n\nRecord player you can call me sister Sadie.\n\nGonna cut a rope and tie her to the tree\n\nWhen the hurricane comes, the hurricane comes.\n\nI know your face I know your smell.\n\nI know that you were living in hell.\n\nPee in the bushes while I wait for a train,\n\nUnder the bridge when it starts to rain.\n\nI never got to ride the sunset route,\n\nBut I drank enough 100 proof.\n\nCampfire on the superfund site,\n\nGarbage island fucking in the moonlight.\n\nI play my song for the barrel of freaks\n\nAnd we go shop lifting when it's time to eat.\n\nThey don't even really know my name,\n\nI'm so happy that we escaped from where we came.\n\nTattoo with a needle and thread.\n\nMost of our old friends are dead,\n\nTEST YOUR DRUGS\n\nREMEMBER NARCAN\n\nThere's a war on the people,\n\nWhat don't you understand?\n\nThere's fentanyl in everything,\n\nDon't become an angel with a broken wing.\n\nWe need you back down here on earth,\n\nNothing is as painful as birth.\n\nTime flies when you're getting old,\n\nI was born with a baby boy soul.\n\nMaybe someday I'll see you again\n\nIn a field, a war, a kingdom of sand.\n\nMaybe we can smile again,\n\nMaybe we can dance again.\n\nI'd kiss your lips and hold your hands.\n\nMaybe we can dance again.\n\nI was young when I left home,\n\nI never stopped running,\n\nUsed to think I was alone.\n\nBut nothing can stop me now.\n\nNothing can stop me now."
