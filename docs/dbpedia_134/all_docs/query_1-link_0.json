        "text": "1991 single by Guns N' Roses\n\n\"You Could Be Mine\" is a song by American rock band Guns N' Roses from their fourth studio album, Use Your Illusion II. The song was released on June 21, 1991, as the first single from the Use Your Illusion albums. The song was originally released as a song in director James Cameron's 1991 film, Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Backed with \"Civil War\" from Use Your Illusion II, the single reached number 29 on the US Billboard Hot 100, number three on the UK Singles Chart, and number one in Finland and Spain. It became a top-five hit in more than 10 additional countries.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSlash states that the song's writing began at the first preproduction session for Appetite for Destruction.[2]\n\n\"You Could Be Mine\" was selected to be included in the James Cameron film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Arnold Schwarzenegger had the band members over for dinner at his own home to negotiate the deal.[3]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nThe music video for the song was directed by Andy Morahan, Stan Winston and Jeffrey Abelson.[4] A T-800 Terminator is assembled, given the appearance of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and dispatched to assassinate the band at one of their concerts. The video consists of clips from the movie, including its teaser trailer, intercut with footage of the band performing the song as the T-800 makes his way to the front of the crowd. After the song ends, he confronts the band as they leave the venue through a back door and analyzes each member individually; Izzy Stradlin is absent at this point, replaced by keyboardist Dizzy Reed. The T-800 scans Axl Rose last and concludes that killing the band would be a \"Waste of Ammo\". Lowering his shotgun, he gives Rose a brief smirk and walks away.\n\nAs the video features clips from the movie, it could not be put on the DVD Welcome to the Videos due to licensing issues. The video was also not included on any of the DVD releases of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, although it was included with a special double tape edition of the film, released on VHS in 1993.\n\nOn October 6, 2022, a music video of \"You Could Be Mine\", with only a mix of scenes from a concert in New York at the Ritz Theatre recorded on May 16, 1991, was released to promote the Use Your Illusion (Super Deluxe Edition) box set.[5]\n\nTrack listings\n\n[edit]\n\n7-inch single (GEFS7-19039)[6]\n\n\"You Could Be Mine\" (LP version) – 5:48\n\n\"Civil War\" (LP version) – 7:38\n\nEuropean CD single (GED 19039)[7]\n\n\"You Could Be Mine\" (LP version) – 5:48\n\n\"Civil War\" (LP version) – 7:58\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nW.
