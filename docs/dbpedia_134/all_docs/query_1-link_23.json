        "text": "At last night's Guns N' Roses show (Dec. 16) at the Key Arena in Seattle, ex-GN'R bassist Duff McKagan hopped on stage to perform with his former band and its current lineup. Fans were likely expecting such a cameo, since McKagan's band Loaded opened for GN'R and will do so again tonight (Dec. 17) at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, British Columbia. Perhaps Canadian fans will be treated to the same reunion of sorts. With the band's loyal contingent of fans hoping for a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame reunion this April, seeing McKagan perform with Axl Rose again is hopefully a harbinger of things to come in 2012.\n\nMcKagan played on GN'R's much-loved, 1991 song, 'You Could Be Mine,' one of the gnarliest songs in their catalog. The song was used in 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day.'\n\nIf you weren't lucky enough to be in the Pacific Northwest last night to catch the whole thing live and in person, that's okay. You can watch the footage of the spectacle and live vicariously through the eyes of the fans that filmed the footage. It certainly will transport you to another time and place.\n\nWatch Duff McKagan Perform With Guns N' Roses"
