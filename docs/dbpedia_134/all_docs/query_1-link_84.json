        "text": "Slash's famous guitar riff, which opens \"Sweet Child O' Mine,\" started off as nothing more than a funny joke.\n\nWhile talking about how well the band worked together, Slash explained to Guitar Center in 2008, \"Anytime anybody came up with something, it was just like the rest of the band just innately knew what to do. Songs almost wrote themselves.\" In the case of \"Sweet Child O' Mine,\" he recalled:\n\nOne afternoon I was sitting around with Izzy [Stradlin] and Duff [McKagan] and had stumbled on this sort of melody, this sort of unorthodox pattern, and I was trying to perfect playing it because it was sort of a finger-twister. Duff and I think Izzy started playing some chords behind it, and it started taking on a life of its own.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, Axl [Rose] was upstairs and heard it, and had some ideas... A couple days later or the next day at rehearsal, Axl goes, \"Hey, play that song you guys were jamming in the living room yesterday,\" and so we started playing it. It just became this tune.\n\nSlash remembered that the riff \"started off as a... joke\" and that thanks to Rose, it \"turned out to be a huge anthem.\" Years after \"Sweet Child O' Mine\" was released, that \"joke\" of a D-flat riff was voted the No. 2 guitar riff of all time in a 2014 BBC poll.\n\nGNR were already famous in the Los Angeles rock music scene for their live act, and some were touting them as rock's \"next big thing\" when the band went into Rumbo Studios in Los Angeles in August 1986 to start recording Appetite for Destruction, their debut album.\n\nGNR was well known for their heavy partying, drinking, and use of illicit substances. But when Clink (who had already worked on Survivor's \"Eye of the Tiger\") was hired to produce their first album, he laid down the law and insisted the studio be a clean space.\n\n\"He kept us at arm's length,\" Slash admitted. \"We partied really hard, but when we were in the studio, we were pretty much together. There was no doping and all that stuff.\"\n\nBefore they decided to go with Mike Clink as their producer, the band worked with Spencer Proffer to record some demos. When he heard \"Sweet Child O' Mine,\" Proffer thought the song needed a breakdown after Slash's solo.\n\nIn his autobiography, Slash remembered they were sitting in the control room trying to figure out what to use as the breakdown section when Rose started ad-libbing, \"Where do we go.\" He described the scene:\n\nAxl said, more to himself than the rest of us, \"Where do we go now?... Where do we go?\"\n\n\"Hey,\" Spencer said, turning the music down. \"Why don't you just try singing that?\"\n\nThe original version of \"Sweet Child O' Mine\" was nearly six minutes long. In order to improve the chances of the song getting played on the radio and put into rotation on MTV, it was cut to slightly more than four minutes. The edit removed much of Slash's guitar solo, a decision that the band, particularly Rose, objected to.\n\nIn a 1989 interview with Rolling Stone, Rose admitted:\n\nI hate the edit of \"Sweet Child O' Mine.\" Radio stations said, \"Well, your vocals aren't cut...\" My favorite part of the song is Slash's slow solo; it's the heaviest part for me.\n\nThere's no reason for it to be missing except to create more space for commercials, so the radio station owners can get more advertising dollars. When you get the chopped version of \"Paradise City\" or half of \"Sweet Child\" and \"Patience\" cut, you're getting screwed.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, Australian music website Max TV highlighted the similarities between \"Sweet Child O' Mine\" and a song called \"Unpublished Critics\" by the band Australian Crawl. \"['Unpublished Critics' has] the same chugging chord progression, a similarly-sweeping lead break, the verse melody, and the elongated one-syllable vocal in the chorus,\" the article claims. It was quickly removed from the Max TV website.\n\n\"Unpublished Critics\" was on Australian Crawl's album Sirocco, which was released by Geffen Records in 1981, more than six years before \"Sweet Child O' Mine\" came out. Perhaps coincidentally, Geffen Records was also GNR's label.\n\nWhile James Reyne, the lead singer for Australian Crawl, told the Daily Mail that \"it is not inconceivable\" that GNR could've heard \"Unpublished Critics\" prior to \"Sweet Child O' Mine,\" he did not accuse them of plagiarism. Nor did he plan to sue, saying, \"I'm not about to take on the might of the [GNR] lawyers.\"\n\nReyne told the Daily Mail that he hadn't paid much attention to \"Sweet Child O' Mine\" when it was released. \"I didn't think 'oh my god'... I didn't really listen to the song, I was more looking at the video thinking, 'Are they stoned? Or on smack?'\"\n\nIn a 2015 interview, GNR bassist McKagan admitted that the similarities between the two songs were \"pretty stunning.\" But he reiterated, \"We didn't [copy] it from them! I swear, I never heard that song until a couple of days ago.\"\n\nAustralian Crawl guitarist Simon Binks agreed, weighing in on the song's Youtube comments:\n\n[T]he similarities between the two songs is more than likely entirely coincidental. Most common rock/pop songs are based on a few simple chord progressions and the same progressions are repeated again and again with different lyrics, melodies and instrumentation layered over them."
