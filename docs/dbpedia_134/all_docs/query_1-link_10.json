In total it has, as of {UPDATEDATE}, at least been played {YCBMSONGS} times.\n\nLyrics:\n\nI'm a cold heartbreaker\n\nFit ta burn and I'll rip your heart in two\n\nAn I'll leave you lyin' on the bed\n\nI'll be out the door before ya wake\n\nIt's nuthin' new ta you\n\n'Cause I think *we've seen that movie too\n\n'Cause you could be mine\n\nBut you're way out of line\n\nWith your bitch slap rappin'\n\nAnd your cocaine tongue\n\nYou get nuthin' done\n\nI said you could be mine\n\nNow holidays come and then they go\n\nIt's nothin' new today\n\nCollect another memory\n\nWhen I come home late at night\n\nDon't ask me where I've been\n\nJust count your stars I'm home again\n\n'Cause you could be mine\n\nBut you're way out of line\n\nWith your bitch slap rappin'\n\nAnd your cocaine tongue\n\nYou get nuthin' done\n\nI said you could be mine\n\nYou've gone sketchin' too many times\n\nWhy don't ya give it a rest\n\nWhy\n\nMust you find\n\nAnother reason to cry\n\nWhile you're breakin' down my back n'\n\nI been rackin' out my brain\n\nIt don't matter how we make it\n\n'Cause it always ends the same\n\nYou can push it for more mileage\n\nBut your flaps r' wearin' thin\n\nAnd I could sleep on it 'til mornin'\n\nBut this nightmare never ends\n\nDon't forget to call my lawyers\n\nWith ridiculous demands\n\nAn you can take the pity so far\n\nBut it's more than I can stand\n\n'Cause this couchtrip's gettin' older\n\nTell me how long has it been\n\n'Cause 5 years is forever\n\nAn you haven't grown up yet\n\nYou could be mine\n\nBut you're way out of line\n\nWith your bitch slap rappin'\n\nAnd your cocaine tongue\n\nYou get nuthin' done\n\nI said you could be mine\n\nYou should be\n\nYou could be mine\n\nYeah!\n\nQuotes regarding the song and its making:\n\nTalking about writing the song:\n\n[Recounting the first preproduction session to Appetite for Destruction]: We booked ourselves time at S.I.R. studios with Mike [Clink] at the board, the band felt free to be ourselves; at our very first preproduction session, we started writing what would later become 'You Could Be Mine.' (...) We weren't in there to write new material, but we were so comfortable that it just came to us.\n\nBozza, Anthony, & Slash (2007). Slash. Harper Entertainment: New York. p. 166-167\n\n'You Could Be Mine' was another track that wasn't new: it was written during the Appetite sessions and I always felt that it should have been on that album, because it is more reminiscent of that time than anything else on the Use Your Illusion albums.\n\nBozza, Anthony, & Slash (2007). Slash. Harper Entertainment: New York. p. 166-167\n\nAnd this next video starts out with a pretty cool drum beat, but I actually didn’t come up with the idea. Duff did. I just want to tell the public that now.\n\nMTV, May 1993\n\n[Before You Could Be Mine] This is a song Izzy wrote about his girlfriend, Angela.\n\nYou Could Be Mine stands out because it represents my entry into Guns N' Roses. I remember I had this punk rock rolling beat at the top, and by accident I put that fill on. I threw it in because I was a huge fan of Terry Bozzio and he did that fill but about 10 million times faster.\n\nRhythm Magazine, July 2009\n\nThat song, and Perfect Crime, we started writing when we were doing pre-production for Appetite. You Could Be Mine was one of Izzy's riffs, and as always with Izzy, he woulc play something and it would catch me ear, and I'd play along, but in my own sort of style. [...] That song didn't change at all [when they recoded it for UYI] apart from the fact that I used a tremolo bar.\n\nTotal Guitar Magazine, July 2011\n\nTalking about the song:\n\nWe don’t do drugs - but we do drink a lot. A lot of the drug rumors about us started because we have a song called 'Cocaine Talking' on the album. But that song’s not about us or our experiences with the drug. If you listen to the lyrics, it’s about how all these nice young girls in L.A. can’t do anything before they do their coke. The song’s definitely not a pro-cocaine song. It’s about how the shit really fucks up your head.\n\nThe beginning of 'You Could Be Mine' has got feedback on it which sounds like more than one guitar, but it's just one guitar.\n\nGuitar For The Practising Musician, April 1992\n\n[Being asked what 'With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue' means]: It doesn’t mean anything. And if it means something, I don’t remember it.\n\nPopular 1, September 1993; translated from Spanish\n\nMy personal favorite Guns N' Roses song, that would be You Could Be Mine.\n\nTalking playing the song live:\n\nThe first time I had to play 'You Could Be Mine' [live] my mind went \"What have I done, I've gotta sing this now!\"\n\nTMS with Eddie Trunk, November 2011\n\n[Talking about his favourite songs to play live]: The [title] track to Chinese Democracy is one of my favorites, also \"You Could Be Mine\".\n\nLA Weekly Blog, December 2011\n\nI really always get a kick out of playing You Could Be Mine. It is just a bass heavy, great riff song, it's really fun to play.\n\nMy favourite song to play is You Could Be Mine, that’s so fun to play as a drummer. It’s a lot of fun. That one’s like shifting in a car. You’re peeling out then hit a low gear, then you’re cruising. You have to shift the gears. It’s balls out.\n\nMusic Radar, June 2016\n\nYou Could be Mine [is my favorite to play]. I like the more funky and grimy stuff like Brownstone, Rocket Queen and Jungle but You Could be Mine is the most fun to play.\n\nThe most fun song I play every night is You Could Be Mine. I love Matt's parts, I love them. It sounds like you're changing gears in a car, it's amazing, you know.\n\nMy favourite song to play is You Could Be Mine, that’s so fun to play as a drummer. It’s a lot of fun. That one’s like shifting in a car. You’re peeling out then hit a low gear, then you’re cruising. You have to shift the gears. It’s balls out.\n\nLast edited by Soulmonster on Tue May 23, 2023 5:46 pm; edited 12 times in total\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby Uli Thu Mar 23, 2017 11:47 am\n\nFlashback: Guns N' Roses Meet the Terminator\n\nIn video for 1991's \"You Could Be Mine,\" The T-800 targets Guns N' Roses for termination\n\n\"You Could Be Mine\" was actually written around the time that Guns N' Roses recorded Appetite for Destruction, but they didn't start playing it live until early 1991. To promote the single, they shot a video in which the Terminator shows up at a Guns N' Roses concert to target the band for termination.\n\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/guns-n-roses-meet-terminator-arnold-schwarzenegger-in-video-w473072\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby Soulmonster Wed May 09, 2018 6:53 pm\n\nThe first quote from Duff is interesting. Both because he hilariously claim the band doesn't do drugs, but also because he mentions what must be You Could Be Mine (=Cocaine Talking) and that it is on the album - in 1988! Maybe he meant on the forthcoming album, or maybe he was so drunk he couldn't remember they hadn't released the song already.\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby Soulmonster Fri Jun 28, 2019 10:38 am\n\nPaul Elliott, writing for Kerrang!, would in June 1991 say that the band had a demo of You Could Be Mine with them to England in June 1987:\n\n\"THE BAND had a rough demo of 'You Could Be Mine’ when they were holed up in Kensington on their first trip to the UK back in the Summer of ’87. Between those famous Marquee gigs, they played a song on a ghetto blaster and sang Axl’s lines in rough harmony. The band are now a little older and a lot richer, but this song is still the same hard bastard, only with cooler guitar breaks\" [Kerrang! June 20, 1991].\n\nTogether with Duff's quote above, it implies it was worked on around the time when the band wrote and recorded 'Appetite' and considered to include it.\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby Soulmonster Sun Feb 06, 2022 5:08 pm\n\n'You Could Be' mine stands out because it represents my entry into Guns N' Roses. I remember I had this punk rock rolling beat at the top, and by accident I put that fill on. I threw it in because I was a huge fan of Terry Bozzio and he did that fill but about 10 million times faster.\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby Blackstar Tue Aug 02, 2022 6:37 am\n\nThis is a song Izzy wrote about his girlfriend, Angela.\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby Soulmonster Sun Sep 11, 2022 10:33 am\n\nI really always get a kick out of playing You Could Be Mine. It is just a bass heavy, great riff song, it's really fun to play.\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby Soulmonster Tue Sep 20, 2022 7:39 am\n\nNew single released today, from May 16, 1991, at the Ritz. This was the third time the song was played live and from the third and last \"warm-up\" show before the UYI tour started: https://www.a-4-d.com/t4990-12-january-july-1991-touring-mayhem#19453\n\nIt's interesting to hear it, but I am not the biggest fans of Axl's vocals from this period.\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby Soulmonster Tue Sep 20, 2022 7:44 am\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby Soulmonster Fri Oct 07, 2022 7:38 am\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby Soulmonster Fri Oct 07, 2022 7:46 am\n\nNot a big fan of the video. I generally don't like it when they mix in footage from other songs and shows to make the performance \"cooler\". I would have preferred just using multiple cameras from the same performance. Makes it more truthful. I also don't like that Izzy is barely featured.\n\nAs for the performance, really sloppy and poor with mistakes all over and Axl's voice is terrible. I'd gladly take any performance after 2009 over this.\n\nStill, cool to see.\n\ndenitza and ludurigan like this post\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby Blackstar Fri Oct 07, 2022 8:13 am\n\nI would have preferred a video with the actual performance of You Could Be Mine as well. But I guess that will be on the blu-ray, and this video serves as some kind of a trailer for it, so I think it's a good video as such.\n\nSoulmonster wrote:As for the performance, really sloppy and poor with mistakes all over and Axl's voice is terrible.

I definitely prefer that over technically \"flawless\" performances.\n\ndenitza and ludurigan like this post\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby denitza Fri Oct 07, 2022 9:59 am\n\nI like the video because it has a nostalgic perspective for me.

I listened (and listened and listened) to dozens of bootlegs by them, I know some of them by heart, and I have NEVER, EVER heard ANYTHING REMOTELY SIMILAR to the full blown mess that is the intro of the song.\n\nI fully believe they did this on purpose to back up their bullshit, three-decade long narrrative that \"Izzy can't play\", \"Izzy's amps had to be turned off during the Illusion Tour because he was playing all wrong etc\". Well, guess what, four months before this show Izzy was playing (and singing) magnificently in Rio including the new songs! So how you expect me to believe that he forgot how to play 4 months later?\n\nAnyway, I love it the way it is. THAT is (was) Guns n' Roses. For real. Like you said above, thruthful. The truth is what it is and it is always better than the fake stuff. Like the nonsensical, comical, pathetic Axl studio vocals on \"Fake Era 1987-1993\".\n\nI just wish I could hear (and see) Izzy's guitar properly, I just wish I could hear the backing vocals properly all through the song (and not just for the spots that they chose to allow me to hear it) etc.\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby ludurigan Fri Oct 07, 2022 1:36 pm\n\nBlackstar wrote:I would have preferred a video with the actual performance of You Could Be Mine as well.

Just lots of mistakes.\n\nBut all in all, great with warts and all.\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby ludurigan Fri Oct 07, 2022 2:29 pm\n\nSoulmonster wrote:I vastly prefer Axl's voice in the 80s to these grating chainsaw sounds.\n\nAs for Izzy, I agree it is too bad he is so low in the mix but when I said it was sloppy playing I was thinking about Slash's performance.

I guess he just played like that back then, very loose, and he always recovers well somehow. All the greats do.\n\nI love that he still plays loose like that even though his playing style has changed dramatically on the last ten years or so and I don't like much of it.\n\nRe: You Could Be Mine\n\nby Soulmonster Fri Oct 07, 2022 2:41 pm\n\nludurigan wrote:\n\nSoulmonster wrote:I vastly prefer Axl's voice in the 80s to these grating chainsaw sounds.\n\nAs for Izzy, I agree it is too bad he is so low in the mix but when I said it was sloppy playing I was thinking about Slash's performance.

Just a bit sloppy. More sloppy than expected for Slash, even in this period. The main problem with the guitars is really that we don't hear so much of the interplay of guitars since Izzy is so low in the mix, but that could also be that Izzy had a bad night and didn't play well\n\nAs for Axl's voice. It was really weird in 1991. One thing is how much distortion (rasp) he applies so it masks the nuances and makes it harder to hear if he's even on key, but he also seemed to have less sustain in 1991 - he barely held the notes. It is just weird. And when he needed to sing fast and with holding his breath, and aggressive, like in the middle part of this song, it just turns into a garbled mess. It must have taken a terrible toll on his vocals. I just don't get why he decided to sing like this and not like in 1988. He roped himself in a bit for '92."
