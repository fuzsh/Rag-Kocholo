        "text": "It took them four years to get from Appetite to Use Your Illusions, but if they wanted to, they could've easily had released a record in between Appetite and the Illusions. I mean, aside from the three originals from Lies, here's what they had written before April 1989:\n\nPatience\n\nUsed to Love Her\n\nOne in a Million\n\nThe Garden - written in 1986\n\nDon't Cry - written in 1985\n\nNovember Rain - written in 1986\n\nYou Could Be Mine - written right before Appetite\n\nPerfect Crime - written in\n\nBad Obsession - written in 1986\n\nBack Off, Bitch - written in 1982\n\nAin't Going Down - written right before Appetite\n\nYesterdays - written in 1985\n\nKnockin' on Heaven's Door - played live in 1988\n\nWith all of that in mind, in a recent blog post, I sequenced what such an album could look like, and this is what I ended up with:\n\nGUNS N' ROSES - PERFECT CRIME (1989)\n\nYou Could Be Mine (Use Your Illusion II)\n\nThe Garden (Use Your Illusion I)\n\nDon't Cry (Use Your Illusion I)\n\nBad Obsession (Use Your Illusion I)\n\nPerfect Crime (Use Your Illusion I)\n\nKnockin' on Heaven's Door (Use Your Illusion II)\n\n-\n\nUsed to Love Her (GN'R Lies)\n\nPatience (GN'R Lies)\n\nBack Off Bitch (Use Your Illusion I)\n\nYesterdays (Use Your Illusion II)\n\nNovember Rain (Use Your Illusion I)\n\nOne in a Million (GN'R Lies)\n\nWhat do you think: Would it have been a good thing, had they released such an album in 1989? Would it help their momentum or oversaturate them for good?\n\nI love these G'n'R what-ifs. Your 'Perfect Crime' album would've been a killer although I feel that a 'main' album release with One in a Million on it (as opposed to what was the more low-key Lies album) would have led to an even bigger controversy.\n\nEven though November Rain is Axl's pet song, I would much prefer that it had been kept for an Axl Rose solo album where he could've lived out all his singer/songwriter Elton John fantasies. I like it, but the song and especially the video were symptomatic of the absurd bloated mess that Guns n Roses became in the 90s.\n\nThese threads are really interesting. Before I found them, I actually looked at this a few times over the years and then recently I spent a fair bit of time on it!\n\nMy approach was looking back in time at how it should have happened and what is believable to me as an improvement at that time. It’s not me picking my favourite songs, then or 30 years later to make one album or wishing there were different songs, versions or personnel involved, it’s using what was released and re-imagining history! A lot of time was spent on sequencing/pacing/timing etc.\n\nIt’s clear those 30ish recordings were ‘it’ and were going to have to last a very long time. The collection was the collection – a lot of fast songs, a lot of slow songs…short, long, simple, complex… Picking a balance of each and releasing them a year or two apart is probably what artists usually do, but that’s not very exciting.\n\nThe albums released as they were though never made sense to me – two different albums with the same name released on the same day? My then age group of 16-24 bought a lot of records and we didn’t understand it – some people only had one (?), some people didn’t like one (?), I couldn’t afford both so had neither (!) until I loaned off a friend, and then copying to tape was hard work!\n\nThe albums with different names and/or styles, a double album or one ‘brilliant’ album are all better alternatives, but I think there’s a problem with achieving the latter – the songs (and specifically the timings)…what were singles (what weren’t), what were performed live (what weren’t), what were people’s favourites at the time (against now). Picking singles would miss off the best songs, and the best songs might present issues playing live and result in an album length of about 7-8 which wouldn’t have been acceptable at that point. An individual’s favourites of each could rule out 100% of someone else’s etc, etc.\n\nWith all this in mind I offer three better scenarios. I hope it provides some interest.\n\nUse Your Illusion as a good old fashioned double album which, all things considered, I still believe is what should have happened. The songs still suggest that to me….just a few less of them! This would have been followed down the line by a Civil War ep (like there was) pulling together 2 songs featured elsewhere and 2 highlighting Izzy and Duff).\n\nTwo separate albums at different times developing a more gradual and appropriate transition of sound between Appetite and Illusion (inspired by my wife’s opinion of how it should have gone and the titles of each are hers!)\n\nImproved versions of both albums if there really had to be a Use Your Illusion I+II as it happened.\n\n1. Use Your Illusion Double Album\n\nDisc 1/Side 1 - 00:26:24\n\nYou Could Be Mine\n\nRight Next Door To Hell\n\nBad Obsession\n\nDouble Talkin’ Jive\n\nNovember Rain\n\nSide 2 - 00:26:38\n\nThe Garden\n\nGarden Of Eden\n\nDon’t Damn Me\n\nPerfect Crime\n\nComa\n\nDisc 2/Side 3 - 00:26:44\n\nLive And Let Die\n\nDon’t Cry\n\nLocomotive\n\nShotgun Blues\n\nBreakdown\n\nSide 4 - 00:27:05\n\nPretty Tied Up\n\nGet In The Ring\n\nDead Horse\n\nYesterdays\n\nEstranged\n\nCivil War EP\n\nCivil War\n\nSo Fine\n\n14 Years\n\nKnockin’ On Heaven’s Door\n\n2.

Use Your Illusion I\n\nRight Next Door To Hell\n\nBad Obsession\n\nLive And Let Die\n\nDon’t Cry\n\nPerfect Crime\n\nDouble Talking jive\n\nNovember Rain\n\nBack Off Bitch\n\nThe Garden\n\nGarden Of Eden\n\nDon’t Damn Me\n\nBad Apples\n\nDead Horse\n\nComa\n\nUse Your Illusion II\n\nYou Could Be Mine\n\n14 Years\n\nYesterdays\n\nKnockin’ On Heaven’s Door\n\nGet In The Ring\n\nBreakdown\n\nPretty Tied Up\n\nShotgun Blues\n\nLocomotive\n\nSo Fine\n\nEstranged\n\nCivil War\n\nIn more primitive forms, the songs on the original post could maybe have worked for a follow up, but in my opinion, based on the songs in the form that I know them from their respective releases, most of it would've, to me, sounded like a snoozefest on the heels of Appetite. That may have been the way they were going anyway, but a single album, two years after AFD, containing three acoustic tracks, an okay but unnecessary cover song, and four tracks on the more ballad-y side, with various levels of bloat...I don't know.\n\nI'm not really familiar with any of the demo versions of any of these songs, just the versions from the proper albums, so maybe there is something there. But if they had a pile of songs with the energy of Perfect Crime or You Could be Mine and included Patience and I guess one of those ballad-y tracks, though I'm not super into any of them--maybe Yesterdays--that would be good for sure.\n\nI often fantasize about GNR having another more Appetite style album by the end of the 80s."
