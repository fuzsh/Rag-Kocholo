        "text": "This would be the 8/3/91 show at the Forum. I was at this show. This is one of those shows that looks awesome on paper with about 35 songs in the setlist but I remember the vibe not being great with the audience, partly because the extremely late start time (after midnight) and the numerous in-between song breaks and often awkward pacing. Part of the problem was the Illusion albums had not yet been released so despite some songs being previewed on radio at the time, many where still unfamiliar to the majority of the audience. The last hour was almost an endurance test and by the encores, well over half the audience had left the Forum. When I got home from the show, it was nearly sunrise.\n\nStill, this show was miles better then the LA Coliseum show I saw over a year later with Metallica. Axl in full diva mode, no Izzy (or Izzy songs) plus backup biker chick singers not a good combo.\n\nIt will be hard to beat the MFSL masterings of the original albums, and even the original mass produced CDs are fairly decent sounding so for me the real goodies here will be the extra content - especially the shows Slash mentioned!\n\nIt is about time the Illusions got some sort of fanfare, to me GNR are one of the only bands of that level of huge I can think of that have been very sparse with remasters, box sets, etc.\n\nI think that Bob was fired before he had a chance to mix the whole album.\n\nNot sure that the final mix, by Bill Price, is that great. But with all of the layering and overdubbing that a certain GnR member spent months doing, it's a minor miracle that anyone was able to do an acceptable mix of these albums (the same goes for the next original GnR album that followed these, many many years later).\n\nAgree - the sound of the original albums is so dense a 5.1 multi-channel mix (or more) would be interesting to space things out. That would get me to buy even if there aren’t worthwhile alt takes included.\n\nHmm. I like these albums well enough, though they are no Appetite. A streamlined single-disc version of the album might have been 85% as good as its predecessor, maybe. Would only pick up a deluxe reissue if there was a lot of unreleased studio tracks on it. I'm not usually too fussed to check out demos, outtakes, and live tracks, and if I was going to be, it would be for an album I loved better than these.\n\nThe original CDs of both albums are the best sounding CDs I’ve ever heard….please DO NOT remaster!!"
