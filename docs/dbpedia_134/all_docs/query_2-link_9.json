        "text": "\"Born to Die\" (originally titled \"Born 2 Die\") is a song written by Lana Del Rey and Justin Parker, produced by Emile Haynie. The song serves as the second single and title track from Del Rey's first major-label studio album. It was officially released worldwide on December 30, 2011.\n\nBackground[]\n\nThe song's instrumental leaked on September 17, 2012, followed by its a cappella on September 29. The first demo of the song, produced by Justin Parker, was first posted to SoundCloud on July 25, 2011, but went undiscovered until September 29, 2012. The second demo of the song, produced by Emile Haynie, would then leak on December 5. A concept beat of the song produced by Haynie leaked alongside two other unused beats on October 20, 2015. \"Born 2 Die\", an early mix of the song featured on a French promotional CD, surfaced on August 14, 2016. On July 22, 2021, the third demo of the song, produced by Dan Carey, leaked. The original file of this demo, titled \"Born_To_Die-rgh_mix-6sept\", leaked on December 25. A fourth demo, also produced by Carey and referred to as the \"alternate final mix\", leaked on January 27, 2022. A fifth demo is rumored to exist.\n\nWriting and inspiration[]\n\nThe song was written by Del Rey and Justin Parker after the success of \"Video Games\". On July 25, 2011, Del Rey posted lyrics from the song in a post on her now-defunct personal Facebook page.[1]\n\nIn an interview with Dazed, Parker stated that he and Del Rey connected as they shared a similar psychological approach to life. Parker said, \"my philosophy is 'you only live once' and we just came up with the concept \"born to die\" in conversation one day. We were half-joking but it really started to resonate. Once you're born, the only certainty is dead\".[2]\n\nComposition[]\n\nMusically, \"Born to Die\" is an apocalyptic down-tempo ballad with hip-hop influences. It was composed in the key of E minor and at a tempo of 86 beats per minute. It features similar instrumentation to \"Video Games\", but focuses more heavily on the hip-hop-influenced beat also featured in \"Blue Jeans\". A few vocal snippets from a live performance of Leslie West performing his song \"Long Red\" in 1972 are featured on the final versions of the song. West's undistorted vocal snippets are featured more prominently on the \"Born 2 Die\" early mix.\n\nCritical reception[]\n\nFollowing the release of the single, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy commented, \"we thought it would be near-impossible for Lana to top the chilling 'Video Games', but her new cut – the title track from her forthcoming album – may just have out-haunted its predecessor.\"[3] Laura Snapes of NME considered the song to be not \"quite as flooring as 'Video Games'\",[4] while Entertainment Weekly contributor Grady Smith considered it a \"beautifully dour tune\".[5]\n\nPriya Elan, also of NME, said the song \"is a grower and whilst not as pitch perfect as 'Video Games', [is] pretty damn fine\".[6] Aaron-Spencer Charles of Metro noted, \"Lana Del Rey's \"Born to Die\" is a slow yet strong song...The calm tone of Del Rey's voice sets sad-love mood really well.\"[7] Reviewers from MusicOMH panned the song and Del Rey's career, arguing that it is \"essentially 'Video Games' with percussion\", and that \"her (alleged) agents [have clearly] stumbled upon a formula with which they can (allegedly) print money and (allegedly) further consign Lana's secretive, (allegedly) real debut LP to the annals of history.\".[8]\n\nUse in media[]\n\nThe song is featured prominently in the trailer for the 2012 German film, Die Vermessung der Welt, directed by Detlev Buck.[9]\n\nThe song plays over the end credits of the 2014 Canadian film Mommy, directed by Xavier Dolan.[10]\n\nAccolades[]\n\nThe music video for \"Born to Die\" was nominated for Best Art Direction at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. The video was also nominated for Best Pop Video - International at the 2012 UK Music Video Awards, losing to herself, for \"Blue Jeans\".\n\nLive performances[]\n\nDel Rey first performed the song live at The Premises in London, England, on July 20, 2011. Since then, it has become an indelible staple of her live performances, having been included on the set lists for all previous concert and festival tours.\n\nThe song was a part of a session done by Del Rey's live touring band in preparation for her Paradise Tour performances. The full rehearsal session, which featured Del Rey's pre-recorded vocals and were created with the intent of aiding the tour's videographer, leaked on October 15, 2020.\n\nMusic video[]\n\nMusic video Information Released December 14, 2011 Length 4:46 Director Yoann Lemoine Producer Emmanuel Reyé\n\nMourad Belkeddar Filmed October 2011 Location Palace of Fontainebleau, France Vevo views 616 million views\n\nMusic video Information Released N/A Length 4:40 Director Yoann Lemoine Producer Emmanuel Reyé\n\nMourad Belkeddar Filmed October 2011 Location Palace of Fontainebleau, France Vevo views\n\nBackground[]\n\nAfter feeling dissatisfied with the home production of the video for \"Video Games\", and with a budget given by her new label, Interscope, Del Rey shot the video for \"Born to Die\" in the royal Fontainebleau Palace in October 2011. In a 2012 interview with MTV, Del Rey would speak about the music video:[11]\n\n\"...I wrote a treatment for it called \"The Lonely Queen\", so that I would be in a setting that represented Heaven, sort of in like a remote castle in Romania. Walking through the halls flanked by tigers. And then she'd be flashing back to happier times in the arms of her love. And then Yoann Lemoine adapted that treatment and made it more doable. But I love that video. I really do. I can’t believe it turned out so beautifully. I spent a lot of time thinking about where I wanted it to go.\"\n\nAn alternate version of the music video surfaced in December 2019. A higher quality, unclipped version of the video surfaced in June 2024. This \"censored\" version was sent to European MTV/VH1 stations during 2012. It features some rearranged and cut scenes, while also featuring some unused scenes of Del Rey singing.\n\nDescription[]\n\nThe video depicts the \"live fast, die young\" mantra Del Rey used throughout her career. It begins with Del Rey embracing her lover - played by Bradley Soileau - with an American flag behind them. Del Rey is then shown in \"Heaven\", sitting on a throne with two tigers beside her. She is then met at the castle by her lover, and the two begin to kiss on the hood of, and inside, a vintage Ford Mustang. The two then drive through the night before crashing. Soileau is shown holding the bloody corpse of Del Rey while the car is aflame behind them. The music video features interlaced clips of Del Rey alone and with her lover in her castle.\n\nThe alternate music video does not end as tragically, instead ending with Del Rey walking down the palace hall toward a bright light.\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nPromotional photoshoot by Clement Jolin[]\n\nCross-references[]\n\nDel Rey has stated that the song is part of the \"K\" trilogy, alongside \"Blue Jeans\" and \"Video Games\".\n\nGetting high is a common subject in Del Rey's songs, including \"Brooklyn Baby\", \"High by the Beach\", and \"Your Girl\", among several others.\n\nIn \"Art Deco\" and \"Cherry\", Del Rey similarly sings \"why?\".\n\nRain is also mentioned in \"Blue Banisters\", \"God Knows I Tried\", \"Hot Hot Hot\", and \"Salvatore\".\n\n\"Roses\" and \"Summertime Sadness\" also reference kissing hard.\n\nThe phrase \"Friday night\" also appears in \"Body Electric\".\n\nThe phrase \"it's like I told you\" also appears in \"Freak\".\n\nThe theme of Del Rey worrying that her lover won't be in Heaven also appears in \"Young and Beautiful\".\n\nThe \"wild side\" is also mentioned in \"Take Me to Paris\" and presumably, \"Wildside\".\n\nThe lyric \"I can see, but once I was blind\" is similar to the lyric \"I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes\" from \"TV in Black & White\".\n\nOfficial versions[]\n\nAlbum version — 4:46\n\nA cappella version — 4:31\n\nInstrumental version — 4:47\n\nSingle version — 4:08\n\nRadio edit — 4:04\n\nClean version — 4:04\n\nDemo beat — 2:25\n\nDemo version 1 (produced by Justin Parker) — 4:21\n\nDemo version 2 (produced by Emile Haynie) — 4:44\n\nDemo version 3 (produced by Dan Carey) — 4:22\n\nDemo version 4 / Alternate final mix (produced by Dan Carey) — 4:29\n\n\"Born 2 Die\" early mix version — 4:49\n\nParadise Tour rehearsal session — 4:50\n\nOfficial remixes[]\n\nAlunaGeorge Remix — 3:12\n\nChad Valley Remix — 3:44\n\nClams Casino Remix — 3:07\n\nInstrumental version — 3:07\n\nGemini Remix — 4:48\n\nGemini Remix - DJ Mix Edit — 4:42[12]\n\nGucci Vump Remix (also known as Guxxi Vump Remix) — 5:53\n\nHackman Remix — 5:16\n\nI Am A Camera Remix — 6:03[13]\n\nKris Di Angelis 'Love Below' Remix — 5:06[14]\n\nLeo Zero Remix — 11:38\n\nLeo Zero Remix (Disco Dub Edit) — 7:33[15]\n\nLil Silva Remix — 4:52[16]\n\nMarcus Intalex Remix — 5:42[17]\n\nMoodymann Remix — 6:11[18]\n\nParrade Remix — 5:45\n\nPDP / 13 Remix — 6:23\n\nPDP / 13 Get High Dub — 6:22[19]\n\nTwo Armadillos Choose Your Last Words Remix — 3:27\n\nTwo Armadillos Club Dub — 3:18\n\nWoodkid & The Shoes Remix — 4:01\n\nLyrics[]\n\nAlbum version[]\n\nSingle version/radio edit[]\n\n\"Born 2 Die\" early mix[]\n\nDemo version 1[]\n\nDemo version 2[]\n\nDemo versions 3 & 4[]\n\nCommercial releases[]\n\nDigital releases[]\n\nBorn to Die - Single\n\nLabel: Polydor, Interscope\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nReleased: December 30, 2011\n\nBarcode: N/A\n\nPhotography: Clement Jolin\n\nDesign: Unknown\n\nBorn to Die (Guxxi Vump Remix) - Single\n\nLabel: RCRD LBL\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nReleased: 2011\n\nBarcode: N/A\n\nPhotography: Nicole Nodland\n\nDesign: Unknown\n\nBorn to Die (AlunaGeorge Remix) - Single\n\nLabel: RCRD LBL\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nReleased: January 12, 2012\n\nBarcode: N/A\n\nPhotography: Nicole Nodland\n\nDesign: Unknown\n\nBorn to Die - Single\n\nLabel: Polydor, Interscope\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nReleased: January 22, 2012\n\nBarcode: N/A\n\nPhotography: Clement Jolin\n\nDesign: Unknown\n\nBorn to Die (Gemini Remix) - Single\n\nLabel: Inspected Records\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nReleased: April 23, 2012\n\nBarcode: N/A\n\nPhotography: N/A\n\nDesign: Unknown\n\nPhysical releases[]\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nLabel: Polydor\n\nFormat: 7\" picture disc vinyl in plastic sleeve\n\nReleased: January 23, 2012\n\nBarcode: 0602527934914\n\nPhotography: Clement Jolin\n\nDesign: N/A\n\nSide A\n\nSide B\n\nGermany, Austria, & Switzerland\n\nLabel: Vertigo\n\nFormat: CD in slim jewel case\n\nReleased: March 23, 2012\n\nBarcode: 0602527971124\n\nPhotography: Clement Jolin\n\nDesign: Unknown\n\nGermany, Austria, & Switzerland\n\nThe Remix EP\n\nLabel: Vertigo\n\nFormat: CD in slim jewel case\n\nReleased: March 23, 2012\n\nBarcode: 0602527971117\n\nPhotography: Clement Jolin\n\nDesign: Unknown\n\nGermany, Austria, & Switzerland\n\nThe Remix EP\n\nLabel: Vertigo\n\nFormat: 12\" white vinyl in cardsleeve\n\nReleased: March 23, 2012\n\nBarcode: 0602527971131\n\nPhotography: N/A\n\nDesign: Unknown\n\nSide A\n\nSide B\n\nUnited States\n\nBorn to Die (PDP / 13 Remix) / Blue Jeans (Penguin Prison Remix) Record Store Day Exclusive\n\nLabel: Polydor, Interscope\n\nFormat: 7\" vinyl in cardsleeve\n\nReleased: April 21, 2012\n\nBarcode: 0602527983318\n\nPhotography: Clement Jolin\n\nDesign: Unknown\n\nSide A\n\nSide B\n\nPromotional releases[]\n\nBorn to Die CD by Polydor;
