        "text": "The Ultimate Guide to\n\nReleasing Your Music on Vinyl\n\nHelpful tips and resources when thinking about pressing vinyl records!\n\nHolding a record in your hand that you created is one of the greatest feelings on earth!\n\nBut getting to that point can be expensive and stressful.\n\nSo, let me help you through this process by trying to cover as much as possible about how to make vinyl records!\n\nPressing Vinyl Records FAQs\n\nHow much am I looking to spend?\n\nPressing vinyl isn’t cheap, but fans are willing to pay more for real records that they can hold in their hands. Expect to pay anywhere between $1000-$3000 for a pressing of 100-300 copies, depending on if you include artwork (jackets) or spring for colored vinyl!\n\nDo I need to do color vinyl?\n\nColored vinyl is something that fans are going crazy for these days. Black vinyl just doesn’t demand as much excitement and perceived value as color does. While color variants cost more than black, it is a worthwhile investment to please your fans and to create a stunning vinyl package!\n\nHow many copies should I get made?\n\nThe sweet spot for indie artists and labels is 300 units. The cost of pressing 100 units may be cheaper, but it would likely require you to sell all 100 at ~$25 each, just to break even. Whereas, quantities of 200-300 trigger “price breaks” and make the overall cost per unit much less. Meaning you break even or make a profit easier!\n\nEnter your email to instantly download my FREE GUIDE TO PRESSING VINYL for indie record labels!\n\nEmail Address\n\nThank you!\n\nGRAB MY FREE GUIDE TO PRESSING VINYL…\n\nHow to review your test pressings.\n\nWhat should I expect to receive with my test pressing package?\n\nA month or so after you send in your audio and downpayment, your pressing plant should send you 5-10 copies of your record. These “test pressings” will generally be on black vinyl, have a generic sleeve, and will not yet have your proper labels on it.\n\nWhat should I be concerned with?\n\nWhen you hear something that doesn’t sound right, listen on another test pressing copy at that exact same spot on the album. If you hear the same noise at the exact same spot on multiple test pressings, contact your sales rep.\n\nAlso, make sure the song order is correct too!\n\nWhat do I do if I’m not sure about something I hear…\n\nYou should always consult with your sales rep at the pressing plant. Tell them what you hear and why you’re concerned. Don’t be afraid to bring it up, you’re spending a lot of money on these records and you want them to sound great!\n\nHelpful tutorials on making vinyl.\n\n5 Cool Vinyl Pressing Hacks\n\nHere are 5 cool things you can do to help improve the overall packaging of your vinyl records!\n\nAlbum Cover Design Templates\n\nHow to use your vinyl manufacturing plant’s template to design your album cover.\n\nHow to know when you should press Vinyl?\n\nYou might still be asking yourself… should you press vinyl records for yourself or for your record label? How do you know when the time is right?\n\nAre you confused about the purpose of a test pressing?\n\nLet’s dive into the topic of test pressings and let’s figure out what you should be listening for when reviewing your test pressings.\n\nHow to pick a pressing plant.\n\nHere are 3 things to keep in mind when preparing to ship your vinyl records.\n\n1. Their Location\n\nThe first factor to consider is the proximity of the pressing plant to your location. Here's why it matters:\n\nShipping Savings: Choosing a nearby plant can save you hundreds on shipping costs, reducing your overall production expenses.\n\nFaster Delivery: Local plants often offer quicker turnaround times, ensuring your vinyl records reach your audience sooner.\n\nTest Pressing Benefits: Some local plants may offer discounts or special perks for clients in the same region.\n\nCommunity Reputation: It's easier to gauge a plant's reputation by gathering feedback from local artists and record labels who have worked with them.\n\n2. Their Reputation\n\nAssessing a pressing plant's reputation is essential for a successful partnership. Here's how to do it:\n\nGoogle Search: Research the plant's online presence, including reviews and any reported issues. This can provide insight into their overall standing in the industry.\n\nLocal Insights: Reach out to local artists, record labels, or industry professionals who have experience with the plant. They can offer valuable insights based on their first-hand experiences.\n\nCommunication with Representatives: Communicate directly with the plant's representatives. This interaction can help you gauge their professionalism, willingness to accommodate your needs, and commitment to customer satisfaction.\n\n3. Their Work\n\nEvaluating a pressing plant's previous work is crucial. Consider the following:\n\nSocial Media: Examine the plant's social media accounts to get a sense of the quality and variety of records they produce. This can help you determine if their work aligns with your artistic vision.\n\nQuantity Variation: Some plants specialize in smaller runs, while others are equipped for larger quantities. Choose a plant that aligns with your production needs.\n\nWillingness to Experiment: Collaborating with a pressing plant that is open to trying new ideas and innovative processes can lead to unique and creative vinyl releases.\n\n4. Their Price\n\nWhile price is not the most critical factor, it's undoubtedly significant. Here's how to approach it:\n\nAvoid Relying Solely on Price: Choosing the plant with the lowest quote may come with hidden costs, such as lower quality or subpar customer service.\n\nBe Price-Conscious: Seek quotes from 2-3 pressing plants to compare costs. Consider the overall value, including quality and additional services, when making your decision.\n\n5. Trial and Error\n\nConsider experimenting with multiple pressing plants to gain valuable perspective:\n\nGain Insight: Trying different plants provides insights into their strengths and weaknesses, allowing you to make more informed decisions.\n\nUnderstand Common Problems: It's essential to realize that issues can occur at any pressing plant. Experiencing them firsthand can prepare you to address and resolve them efficiently.\n\nHow to ship vinyl records.\n\nHere are 3 things to keep in mind when preparing to ship your vinyl records.\n\nOrder yourself a bunch of cardboard shipping boxes.\n\nThey come in a flat pack and can hold up to 3 records per box. These are mandatory as they take care of the records.\n\nGet a shipping quote before you sell your records.\n\nTake a record in a box to the post office and ask them to provide an approximate quote on how much it would cost to ship this box to various countries (Canada, USA, Japan, UK, Germany, etc). This will help you know how much to charge your fans!\n\nThrow in some freebies with every order.\n\nThings like old stock (unsold records/CDs), stickers, flyers, candies, or a personal note from the artist/label owner.\n\nCreative Vinyl Packaging Ideas\n\nHere are a few cool things you can do on your next vinyl pressing…\n\nHave fun with marketing stickers\n\nPrint some small stickers to put on the shrinkwrap of your records. You can use these stickers to describe the album and the artist, include a barcode or QR code, or carry over the album artwork onto the sticker.\n\nBe creative with the center label\n\nThere are a handful of cool things you can do with the center label of a vinyl, including opting for a smaller circle or something entirely different, like a rectangle.\n\nInclude a print or a booklet\n\nPaper products are fairly inexpensive to make. A nice bonus for fans can be including a lithograph of the album cover, a note from the artist, or a lyric booklet.\n\nMy Vinyl Album Cover Template\n\nFree Vinyl Record Product Mockup\n\nDownload our free Photoshop PSD vinyl record mockup template!\n\nHow long does it take to make vinyl records these days?\n\nHow much does it cost to make 200 records?\n\nWhat is the ideal number of records a small label should press?\n\nI chat with Paul Miller of Precision Pressing, and we talk all about the current state of pressing vinyl at the end of 2023!\n\nRECORD LABEL\n\nACADEMY\n\nThe Complete A to Z of Building and Growing an Independent Record Label.\n\nHelpful Articles for Record Labels\n\n2023 Trends for Record Labels\n\nA2IM\n\nAlbum Artwork\n\nAlbum Post-Release Strategy\n\nBandcamp\n\nBook Recommendations\n\nBuilding a Back Catalog\n\nCassettes\n\nCreating a Business Plan\n\nDigital Distributor\n\nAdvice for DIY Artists\n\nThe Don’t Do List\n\nEmail Marketing\n\nFinding an Investor\n\nHow to Start a Record Label\n\nHow to Surprise Your Fans\n\nLeveraging the Power of Lead Time\n\nMarketing\n\nMultiple Revenue Streams\n\nMusic Publishing\n\nNiches\n\nPicking a Release Date\n\nRecord Contract Template\n\nRecord Label FAQs\n\nRecord Label Mistakes\n\nRecord Labels Take Time\n\nRoyalties\n\nSafe Spaces for Artists\n\nSocial Media Strategies & Solutions\n\nStreaming\n\nSubmitHub\n\nSync Licensing\n\nThe 4 Attributes of a Great Record Label\n\nThe History of Record Labels\n\nVinyl Manufacturing\n\nWeb Design\n\nWhy Artists Need a Record Label\n\nYouTube Channels for Record Labels\n\nOther Record Labels Podcast\n\nFeaturing interviews with…"
