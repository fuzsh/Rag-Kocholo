        "text": "“Sundress” is the first single by A$AP Rocky after the release of his third studio album, TESTING. The song and its accompanying music video were released on November 20, 2018.\n\nThe song heavily samples Tame Impala’s “Why Won’t You Make Up Your Mind?,” released on their 2010 debut album Innerspeaker. Additionally, the song features production from frequent collaborators Danger Mouse and Hector Delgado, whilst also offering Rocky’s first collaboration with Syk Sense.\n\n“Sundress” is a highly-anticipated collaboration between Tame Impala and Rocky. News of a collaboration between the two surfaced in 2014, as a track titled “Unicorn” which sampled Tame’s “Feels Like We Only Go Backwards” leaked online, however it was never officially released by Rocky. Moreover, in September 2017, a snippet surfaced of the since unreleased song “Pretty Guy,” speculated to be produced by Kevin Parker."
