        "text": "I'm not an attorney and you should use your own judgement but, as long as you're not handling publishing & distribution, I don't believe you would be held libel (which should not to be confused with not being sued and having to defend yourself) since the act of recording the cover itself is not illegal; the act of the band selling the song on an album for money without a mechanical license is the issue. If you're really concerned about it, check with an attorney and or have the band sign a waiver (drafted or at least reviewed by your attorney) that indemnifies and holds you harmless in the event of a suit (from the band or 3rd party), that way if you were to get sued, it would all fall back on the band. I've seen, and I'm sure you can find, fairly standard recording contract on line that should have an indemnity clause in it that you can add to your contract or use as the basis of the waiver. This is pretty common stuff for an attorney so it shouldn't cost too much to ease your mind at the very least in the end you would end up with a contract and or waiver that you can always reuse.\n\nNo one is going to sue you for engineering the recording of a cover. That would be like the music store that provided the equipment getting sued also.\n\nIf the artist/band want to use a cover on a CD that they are going to sell/distribute...THEY need to get the licensing rights.\n\nYou don't really need *permission* ahead of time to actually record a cover...it's just common sense for the *band* to do that in advance, if they plan on selling those CDs.\n\nWell, this may or may not be true but I think you may be confusing having a suit filed against you and having judgment rendered against you. To that point: I would say it depends on who's song is being covered and by whom. If an \"A list\" band covers another \"A list\" band's song I would contend that the attorneys (given their nature) for the original song writer, publisher, and or artist (which could all be different people/entities) will sue everyone involved (just for affect) and let the court settle it. Now if some guy/band in a garage releases the same cover in low distribution it is less likely (key word being less) that mass suits would be filed. However, more likely is the band gets sued then turns around and sues the recording studio claiming that they didn't know and the studio should have told them this was a problem which is why in my original response I suggested indemnification form the band and or 3rd party suits.\n\nLots of what ifs I know but not out of the realm of possibilities, I've seen suits filed for a lot less . At the end of the day the only liabilities would be for royalty payments (not likely to amount to much if low distribution) and legal fees which could be more significant. Not sure where you're located but here in NJ I suits get filed for a lot less....I need to move\n\nThe person who records the song has no way of knowing the copyright status of what he records. If a band play something you have never heard of, that doesn't mean they wrote it? Who fills in the metadata tags that list composer and the other people concerned with the recording? You will get the engineer credit. I know there is something in UK law that prevents you absolving yourself - so you can't make the client sign something that says copyright clearance is the client's responsibility.\n\nLegal advice seems sensible here, because this could well be something quite different from location to location. When I'm doing video work, and a client gives me a picture that says Getty Images on it, I refuse to use it without clearance, because I've seen the Getty invoices for illegal use. On the other hand, when I've produced audio for a client - usually short run CDs, I clear the rights on their behalf and charge them for it.\n\nAs far as I can, I try to do it properly. I always makes sure the rights cost is clearly shown on the invoice so they don't think I'm ripping them off."
