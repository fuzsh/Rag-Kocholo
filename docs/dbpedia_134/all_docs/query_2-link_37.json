        "text": "Is someone’s potential only recognized when it fits the traditional mold?\n\nWe all have different starting points based on our backgrounds and identities, which shape the experiences, and sometimes the barriers we face. One aspect of our identity which is often overlooked at work is our socio-economic background. Factors like our upbringing and the education and income of prior generations of our family impact the extent to which we can access resources, networks and opportunities. It can also come with social stigma, and a pressure to hide our backgrounds for fear of judgment, negative perception of capability or pressure to \"fit in\". This can significantly impact career experiences and progression.\n\nSocial mobility is how a person’s socio-economic situation changes over time. It plays an important role in social cohesion and economic growth. Given that it is inconsistently enabled across the globe, we’re surfacing this important topic globally as part of our broader DE&I and social equity efforts, to spark new conversations and promote action.\n\nProgressing at work should not be about where you come from, but where you want to go. At EY, we believe in the power of different perspectives, feeling free to be yourself, and clearing obstacles to enable access to opportunities — for everyone. This belief is at the heart of our \"All in\" strategy, driving purposeful growth and creating new value for EY people and stakeholders.\n\nBy paying closer attention to some of these persistent barriers people from lower socio-economic backgrounds may face, we can be intentional with our actions to create a big impact on the people around us.\n\nTogether, we can shape the future with confidence."
