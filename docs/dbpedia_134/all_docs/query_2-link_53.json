        "text": "Hello! Thanks for coming to the site. I am an attorney ready to answer your questions. I have a nearly 100% satisfaction rating. All that means is that you can count on me to help today. I’m very sorry to hear about your situation. Also, you may get a phone call request. These are pop-ups sent by the system; not by me. You're free to accept or decline as you wish.\n\nI’m sorry to hear about your situation. We can't represent you; however, we can provide some guidance in how to get access back. This song is your personal property as much as it is his. By him keeping it, this to me sounds like a conversion. Conversion occurs when there is a substantial interference with the personal property rights of another. Usually, the measure of damages is the fair market value of the property at the time of conversion or a return of the property itself.\n\nYou may want to consider just writing a formal demand letter, advising that the property should be returned ASAP. There’s a site that I’ve used in the past where you can find templates for various legal issues, including a demand letter (click the link - https://www.etsy.com/listing/674752957/demand-letter?ref=listings_manager_grid) Lawyers use letters like these often to enforce their client’s rights. It only costs $11 and it is about 90% cheaper than hiring an attorney to do it. Lawyers use letters like these often to enforce their client’s rights.\n\nYou could call the police or sheriff to help you get the property back. Having some proof of ownership would be helpful. Keep in mind that these policing agencies deal with criminal matters and conversion is a civil matter so they may decline to help. For something like this, you may need to go to court.\n\nThe only other option would be to file a lawsuit in your local court to get the property back.\n\nBecause I value your input, I would like to know whether you have any other questions for me today that I could help you with?\n\nUnderstood.\n\nThe answer is yes.\n\nUnder the Copyright Act, this is partially your song, too.\n\nThis means you can profit off of it.\n\nThe law doesn't allow him to sue successfully for this, so your'e free to do so, regardless of whether you signed the contract.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nI’m flattered and I wish I could represent you, but the website won't allow me to do so, unfortunately. I can do the next best thing though and provide some useful info.\n\nOne thing I recommend is going through your state’s lawyer referral service (LRS). The LRS typically only lists experienced attorneys who have adequate staffing to assist people. Below is a link to a website that compiles the state lawyer referral services:\n\nhttps://thebestlegalresources.blogspot.com/\n\nSometimes, the local law schools can provide free legal assistance, too.\n\nYou can also return to this site and ask questions to me as you go through this process to keep your costs down.\n\nDid you have any other questions for me today about this?"
