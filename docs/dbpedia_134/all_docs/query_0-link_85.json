        "text": "Inside the old farmhouse is a record player. This musical device allows you to change the background music that plays while you are on the farm. To interact with the player, walk up to it and press the A Button. You'll then see a list of the background music options.\n\nThe background music will play while on your farm and when you're in the vicinity of your farm. For example, you might hear the music while walking down the main road through the valley if you walk close to the bream/wall that separates the road from your farm.\n\nAt the beginning of Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life, you'll have two records: Breezy and Quiet Winter. You can add more records by raising friendship with villagers, and you can buy 1 record from Van.\n\nThe record player will move from the main room to your bedroom in Chapter 4.\n\nYou can completely silence the record player by selecting the active record and then pressing the A Button. The records can also be removed from the player by using the Y Button. A removed record will still have an entry in the record player, but it will be disabled as a music option.\n\nThanks to the UNoT forum farmers for hunting down the EN titles!\n\nRecord List\n\nThere are a total of 14 records for the record player. When you receive a record, bring it back to the farmhouse and then choose the Add Record option in the record player.\n\nThe below lists of records also contains 30-second audio samples for each record.\n\n1. Spring is in The Air\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element :(\n\nThe first stepping stone to farm life.\n\nSpring theme from the original Harvest Moon SNES\n\nBuy this record from Van for 100,000 G after his friendship is at 90 points or more. Van appears only on the 3rd and 8th of each season. He likes eggs, items from the dig site, and Irogonomi (the white winter season flower).\n\n2. Sleeping Spirits\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element :(\n\nMusic is a source of power.\n\nGoddess Shrine theme from Harvest Moon Animal Parade\n\nThis record will be given to you by Sebastian. Raise his friendship to 90 points or more, then talk to him when he is inside his room in the villa. Sebastian likes gifts of wildflowers, ores found from the dig site, Silver Coin, Curry, Mushroom Curry, and Hot Curry.\n\n3. Another Valley, Together\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element :(\n\nPeaceful days with a hundred little pointy-eared friends.\n\nTheme song from Harvest Moon DS\n\nYou can obtain this record from the beginning of the game. Go to the forest and eat a mysterious mushroom on the ground by the Nature Sprite's tree. You'll shrink inside where you can talk to the sprites and learn cooking recipes. In the back of the room is a large brown pot. You have to interact with Mr.Potson 100 times. The dialog message will change the closer you get to 100:\n\n1-10: \"Is something in there?\"\n\n11-20: \"There's some sort of liquid sloshing around inside the pot\"\n\n21-30: \"Something's sort of odd about the liquid in this pot...\"\n\n31-40: \"Mm...?\"\n\n41-50: \"...\"\n\n51-60: \"Fool... Who dares disturb my slumber\"\n\n61-70: \"Begone... Leave me be... or ELSE...\"\n\n71-80: \"... Seriously, knock it off.\"\n\n81-90: \"Come on. Really? Why are you LIKE this?\"\n\n100: Receive the record\n\nIn the original A Wonderful Life Special Edition (Playstation 2), Mr.Pots (as it was named back then) required 100 interactions if you wanted to have a girl child in Chapter 2.\n\nNina will tell you she had a dream about talking to Mr.Potson that hints at what you're to do.\n\n4. 64 Memories\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element :(\n\nThe cherry blossoms were blooming in the town square...\n\nTheme song from Harvest Moon 64\n\nCharlie and Cole have a territory mini-game they'll play with you when visiting their silo house. The goal is to take as much area on the game board as your opponent. It is easy to win when laying the lines out into a large shape, as the brothers will only block your progress once they realize you're about to clear a large chunk of the board. Winning this game a total of 10 times will reward you with this record.\n\nYou don't have to beat both Charlie and Cole. I've received the record just with beating the easier Charlie while still in Chapter 1.\n\n5. Cafe Jazz\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element :(\n\nThe only thing that can satisfy.\n\nFrom Back to Nature for Girl\n\nThis record comes from Gavin. Raise his friendship to 90 points, then talk to the Bluebird Cafe owner when he is in the back bedroom. Gavin likes fish, Mistmoon flower, Trick Blue flower, Coin, Silver Coin, and Gold Coin. I've found him in the backroom of the cafe on the 1st during the afternoon (3pm-ish).\n\n6. My Racing Heart\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element :(\n\nFalling in love in 3, 2, 1 ...\n\nHeart event theme from Story of Seasons: Trio of Towns\n\nYou need to be in Chapter 6 or later to receive this record. Raise your child's friendship to 90 points or more, then talk to them when they're inside their bedroom in your farmhouse.\n\n7. Summer of the Pioneer\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element :(\n\nI found a wild sheep! Time to tame it!\n\nTown theme from Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town\n\nYou'll need to raise your friendship with Carter to 90 points or greater. He likes Cheese (Rank B, A, or S), Watermelon, Melon, the Trickblue versions of both melons, and all sheep's wool. Talk to him when he is on the beach on the 3rd or the 8th to receive this record.\n\n8. Joyful Autumn\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element :(\n\nAutumn season theme from Harvest Moon: Hero of Leaf Valley\n\nDedicated to the Nature Sprites Ace, Jack, and Hart.\n\nRaise your friendship with Mukumuku to 90 points or higher, then talk to the yeti to receive this record. Mukumuku likes fish, eggs, milk, crops, wildflowers, and cheese. The tricky part is that Mukumuku is only around during winter season in the forest area.\n\n9. Autumn in Oak Tree Town\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element :(\n\nTraveling the world, from oak tree to olive branch.\n\nAutumn season theme from Story of Seasons (3DS)\n\nYou need to be in Chapter 2 or later and have Kate at 90 points of friendship or higher. Young Kate likes fish, Melon, Strawberry, wildflowers, and Coin. Older Kate starts to like eggs as well, though young Kate isn't a fan of eggs. Talk to her when she is on the 2nd floor of Garret and San's house to get this record. The tough part is catching Kate when she's upstairs.\n\n10. One Sunny Day\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element :(\n\nHappiness is a future together with you.\n\nWedding song from Harvest Moon: Grand Bazaar\n\nRaise your friendship with Chris to 90 points or higher, and then simply talk to her wherever to receive the record. She likes wildflowers, ores from the dig site, and Apples. Pretty easy!\n\n11. Breezy\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element :(\n\nThe BEST song to do work to!\n\nFrom the original A Wonderful Life\n\nThis one is included with the record player at the start of the game.\n\n12. Quiet Winter\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element :(\n\nRecommended for quiet nights.\n\nFrom the original A Wonderful Life\n\nThis one is included with the record player at the start of the game.\n\n13. Wonderful!!\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element :(\n\nDedicated to the bygone days of my youth.\n\nTheme song from the orignal A Wonderful Life\n\nThis record can be received from Takakura after you are in Chapter 2 or later and you have everyone at 90 friendship points or greater, excluding Vinnie. The talking plant's friendship level doesn't factor into this record. Once you've met the requirement, talk to Takakura.\n\n14. Winter Mineral Town\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element :(\n\nUnder the icy lake, the kappa sleeps...\n\nWinter season song from Friends of Mineral Town\n\nReceive this record from Hugh when his friendship is 90 points or higher and you are in Chapter 4 or later. Hugh's likes change depending on his age. For example, a couple of Hugh's gift preferences are:\n\nChapter 1 Hugh likes milk, Coin, Milky Soup, and sheep's wool\n\nChapter 2 Hugh likes Banana (B Rank or higher), sheep's wool, and Silver Coin\n\nChapter 3 Hugh likes Gold Wool, Coin, Gold Coin, and Herbal Soup\n\nChapter 4 Hugh likes Banana (S Rank), Gold Wool, Coin, and Gold Coin\n\nIt's easiest to maximize Hugh's friendship in Chapter 1 by giving him several bottles of milk and Coins from the dig site every day. Once you have enough friendship and you're in Chapter 4 or later, talk to Hugh when he is upstairs in his room to receive this record.\n\nThe tricky part is catching Hugh while he's upstairs in Sully and Chris' house. I found the best way to catch Hugh in later chapters is to set your alarm clock for 5 am or so, then run over to their house in the morning after the alarm clock wakes you up. When their front door opens at 6 am, walk in and head directly upstairs to catch Hugh before he walks down the stairs.\n\nRelying on the normal 6 am wake-up in the game will result in Hugh being downstairs by the time you reach his house."
