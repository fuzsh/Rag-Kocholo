        "text": "Guns N’ Roses have released a new live video for their Appetite For Destruction classic You Could Be Mine. The video was shot at the band's 1991 show at New York’s Ritz Theatre.\n\nThe footage is taken from the bonus Blu-ray disc included in the upcoming Use Your Illusion I & II deluxe box set, which features the band's complete set from the May 16 show at the Ritz. The film has been newly transferred from 35mm print to 4K UHD, with the sound newly mixed from original multi-track tapes.\n\nThis performance was one of four warmup shows that band scheduled prior to the Use Your Illusion tour (the others were in Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles) and saw the band perform Don't Cry and You Ain't The First and with late Blind Melon singer Shannon Hoon.\n\nThe new Use Your Illusion I & II set will be released through UMG on November 11 on Super Deluxe 7CD/Blu-ray, Super Deluxe 12LP on 180g heavyweight vinyl/Blu-ray, 2CD deluxe editions, and separate single CD and double LP versions.\n\nGuns N' Roses are currently on the South American leg of their We're F'N Back! tour, which will shift north to Mexico before heading across the Pacific for a series of dates in Asia and Australasia in November and December. Full dates below."
