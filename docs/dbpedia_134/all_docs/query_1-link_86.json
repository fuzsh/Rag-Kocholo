        "text": "Every Monday through Friday, we deliver a different song as part of our Song of the Day podcast subscription. This podcast features exclusive KEXP in-studio performances, unreleased songs, and recordings from independent artists that our DJs think you should hear. Today’s song, featured on the Afternoon Show with Kevin Cole, is “Be Mine” by Alice Boman from the 2014 EP II on The Control Group / Happy Death.\n\nAlice Boman - Be Mine (MP3)\n\nThe beauty of music is that in whatever construction, in whatever style, when the notes, the voice and the rhythms hit our ears, and a connection is made. We find ourselves lucky today to be able to hear the music of Alice Bowman, a young Swedish singer with a powerfully delicate voice - a voice that knows it's been broken, but that only shows signs of this history cautiously. She sounds like a mother singing a lullaby, like someone weeping up the street, like the hour of midnight struck in your living room.\n\n\"Hold me close / I don't ask for more\", Boman sings on today's featured song, \"Be Mine\". Listening to the track, there is a comfort that encircles. It reminds of the joy of knowing that there are great songwriters in the world that many haven't yet heard of. Songwriters (in other countries, no less) that imbue love and passion and mystery and sadness and hope. \"All the darkness and all the light - and the break of dawn and in the deepest night - be mine.\" Such a simple, but deep, request. Yet to whom is she asking? And still, without fight or knowing if it's actually us she wants, we agree and we are hers."
