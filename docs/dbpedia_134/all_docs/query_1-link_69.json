        "text": "Guns-N-Roses.jpg\n\nThe men of Guns N' Roses circa 1991.\n\n(Universal Music)\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio - If Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" served as the death blow to 1980s hair-metal, then Guns N' Roses' epic double-release of \"Use Your Illusion I and II\" marked the genre's last gasps of rarefied air.\n\nThe two bands' respective releases came out a week apart, with GNR's \"Illusion\" pair dropping Sept. 17, 1991. But unlike \"Nevermind,\" GNR's third and fourth studio albums were tremendous sellers from the very start.\n\nIt had been four years since the release of \"Appetite for Destruction\" and three years since the head-scratcher that was \"G N' R Lies\" in 1988. Yet, thanks to frontman Axl Rose's ability to grab headlines and a relentless touring schedule, Guns N' Roses was unquestionably the biggest band in the world to start the 1990s.\n\nWith the single \"You Could Be Mine\" (from the \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" soundtrack) leading the way, \"Use Your Illusion I and II\" became one of the biggest pop-culture events of 1991.\n\nNowadays, music fans sit around and wait for new albums to arrive on streaming services (assuming they haven't leaked already). But GNR's new records represented a blockbuster vibe befitting a major movie.\n\nFans lined up the night of Sept. 16 waiting for the midnight release, helping \"Use Your Illusion I and II\" sell a combined 1.4 million copies during the first week. By comparison, Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" sold a modest 46,000 copies during the first week of release (Sept. 24) and wouldn't become a huge seller until the following year.\n\nWhile Guns N' Roses was bigger than it had ever been, musically the band was different. Matt Sorum was now on drums, replacing the train wreck that was Steven Adler. Keyboardist Dizzy Reed had also become a major part of the band's recordings.\n\nMore importantly, Axl Rose and Slash were already butting heads on the band's direction. Slash was a throwback, gritty guitarist with both hard rock and blues tendencies. Rose was in the midst of what Slash would later call his \"Madonna\" phase, wanting to be a rock god and nothing short of the biggest thing on the planet.\n\nThat conflict could be heard through GNR's music. As easy as it is to look at \"Use Your Illusions I and II\" as some sort of quasi double-album, they are very much two separate entities.\n\n\"Use Your Illusion I\" seemed more like a continuation of \"Appetite,\" led by the hard hitting opener \"Right Next Door to Hell.\" Yet, you could sense Axl's determination to become something more than a straight-forward hard rock act in songs like the slower, bluesy \"Dust N' Bones\" and, of course, the over-the-top drama of \"November Rain.\"\n\nStill, technically, the band was in fine form. Axl's voice had become a true musical weapon, perhaps more potent than that any singer since Freddie Mercury. Meanwhile, Slash and Izzy Stradlin's dual guitar playing was a thing of beauty, fueling the fire of songs like \"Perfect Crime\" and \"Bad Obsession.\"\n\n\"Use Your Illusion II\" was a full-on Axl showcase right from the start with \"Civil War,\" an emotional rock fest that clocks in at nearly 8-minutes long. That style continued into other songs like the sappy \"Yesterdays\" and the epic ballad \"Estranged.\"\n\nAt times, Axl's willingness to push the band towards a more temperamental vibe and Slash's uncompromising roots were able to merge brilliantly (See: the cover of \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" or the hit \"Don't Cry\").\n\nBut \"Use Your Illusion I and II\" were also frustrating listens. Every time you found yourself feeling as if the band was moving back towards its \"Appetite\" phase, a song (or two) would pop up to knock you back down. Heck, even the mind-numbing \"My World\" might be one of the worst closers of a major album in rock history.\n\nOf course, none of this did anything to calm GNR's buzz. MTV helped pushed Guns N' Roses through the stratosphere, thanks to relentless playing of the band's videos, most notably the unforgettable mini-movie that was \"November Rain.\"\n\nLooking back, \"Use Your Illusion I and II\" seems like a brave leap calculated by Rose to push Guns N' Roses to new heights. He felt the songs were more mature, grandiose and fulfilling.\n\nOnly, his fans and bandmates were craving the easier route. Guns N' Roses was an act that could have simply copied \"Appetite for Destruction's\" formula and road it to a lengthy, decade-after-decade run.\n\nBut that was never something Axl Rose was willing to do. Guns N' Roses would go on to record just one more album together (the covers set \"The Spaghetti Incident?\") before Axl moved on all by his lonesome.\n\nHad the core members stuck together and recording more material, \"Use Your Illusions I and II\" might seem like a transitional record from one of the greatest bands of all time. Instead, it feels like a misstep or, at best, a what-could-have-been.\n\nOver the next few years, grunge would takeover and the wait for \"Chinese Democracy\" would begin. Still, there's no denying the best moments of \"Use Your Illusion I and II\" represent some of GNR's strongest material.\n\nIt's only 25 years later, with the soap opera drama removed; we're able to truly appreciate that."
