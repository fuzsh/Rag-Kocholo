        "text": "If youâre an experienced or beginner producer whoâs pondering the idea of a career in music production, then I have good news for you my friend - thereâs now more ways than ever before to make money as a music producer in 2024! Nice.\n\nApart from just making beats and selling them online, thereâs a whole list of other things you could be getting involved in as a music producer with thatâll not just put some extra money in your pocket, but also raise your brand and diversify your skill set at the same time. The key is being open-minded, branching out and applying your expertise and knowledge to as many lucrative opportunities as possible.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nHow much do music producers make?\n\nAccording to figures published in 2022, music producers on average make around $32, 379 per year as a base salary.\n\nItâs important to remember that this salary is an average.\n\nEach music producerâs salary will be different and determined by a number of factors, including how far along in their career they are, their experience, education, location and other artists or collaborators theyâve worked with.\n\nSome producers may also work on an hourly basis rather than a salary, or charge the artistâs they work with based on an agreed royalty split. So thereâs really no set rhyme or reason to how much you could make.\n\nBut one thing is for certain - thereâs a whole bunch of music revenue streams out there that music producers can tap into to make more money from their production talents.\n\nâ\n\n12 ways to make money as a music producer\n\nHereâs 12 viable ways to make money as a producer that are open to most (if not all!) beginner and expert producers.\n\n1. Earn from streaming royalties\n\nIf youâre producing music that listeners want to stream, a nice portion of your income will come off the back of streaming royalties.\n\nTo cut a long story short, music royalties are generated by having your music available on music streaming and social media platforms like Spotify, Apple Music & Amazon Music etc.\n\nEvery time a listener plays your track or song, youâll generate money. So if you arenât already distributing music online, sign up with Ditto now to start collecting royalties and earning from digital streams - as well as downloads.\n\nFind out how much money you could be making per stream with our Spotify pay per stream calculator.\n\nYou can also earn extra mechanical royalties for every stream when you sign up with a publishing company like Ditto Music Publishing.\n\nâ\n\n2. Sell your beats & samples online\n\nAny beats, loops or samples that you create are all viable products that you can sell online and make some money from.\n\nAnd the best part is - you can do it over and over again.\n\nCreate, sell, cash-in, repeat.\n\nYou can sell beats and sample packs either via your own music website, or through external websites and libraries, like Splice Sounds and ADSR Sounds.\n\nAnd when it comes to setting a price for your products, have a look at what other producers in a similar career point as you are starting their prices from.\n\nBeats, loops and music samples can range widely in prices - so take into account the following factors when deciding your price:\n\nâ\n\n3. Produce for other artists\n\nMusic production is a very specialised skill set - and one that many new and up-and-coming artists wonât have.\n\nThis makes your production talent and knowledge highly desired by artists who donât have the skills or tools to deal with the trickier technical aspects of recording and production.\n\nNot only will you be able to earn some money in exchange for producing some fascinating sonic spectacles for a new artist, youâll also be raising your own industry clout from the exposure that comes with music collaborations and building relationships with other creatives in your field.\n\n4. Become a ghost producer\n\nNot as ghoulish as it sounds - a ghost producer is essentially someone who creates music for other producers anonymously.\n\nSo while your work wonât necessarily be getting credited to you, youâll instead be compensated in terms of a monetary benefit, which can actually work as a great secondary stream of regular income.\n\nPlus itâs made easier by the host of platforms out there where you can offer your ghost production services - including EDM Ghost Production and House of Tracks.\n\n5. Go freelance\n\nMake use of freelancing platforms like Fiverr and Upwork to find a whole bunch of clients who require musical assistance for projects like websites and start ups.\n\nOne of the best parts about doing freelance work is thereâs no long term commitment - you can opt in or opt out anytime you like.\n\nFrom background scores to short films to editing tasks, you can get involved in some cool projects and learn new skills along the way - all whilst receiving a (sometimes hefty) cheque after completion.\n\n6. Offer mixing & mastering services\n\nIf youâve got some serious mixing and mastering skills, then this is another financial op for you to get in on as a music producer!\n\nThe mix and master is oftentimes the final step in developing a polished album arrangement - and one that usually requires a professional hand.\n\nMany music producers have gone down a professional career path in sound engineering from their specialisms in mixing and mastering, which makes it hardly surprising that these skills are some of the most sought after in the industry.\n\nJust remember - thereâs a difference between mixing and mastering.\n\n7. Lend out your home studio\n\nHaving your own, kitted out home studio is like a music production gold-mine.\n\nNot only can you make the most of all the EQ plugins, MIDI keyboards and other production equipment youâve gathered to create some killer beats and loops, but youâd be surprised how many new producers would pay for the opportunity to rent out your set up and borrow your resources!\n\nIf youâve already got a home studio setup, you can start feeing artists who want to use your studio to record their music.\n\nAnd if you havenât, check out this post for a rundown of how to build a studio on a budget, including all the gear you need to get started.\n\n8. Music sync licensing\n\nSync licensing & deals are an lucrative way of making money for producers and artists alike.\n\nWhy?\n\nMany music producers are behind the sonic cues and instrumentals that play in movies, television shows, video games and more. So if your track gets used as a soundtrack on any of these forms of AV media, youâll be raking in cash from sync licensing.\n\nDitto Music Publishing are experts in music sync, having bagged placements for our artists on big networks like CNN, Netflix & BBC. Sign up today to start getting your music pitched by our publishing team.\n\nVideo game music is a particularly booming space that music producers can tap into. As a medium thatâs rich for its background scores, soundtracks and sound effects within gameplay, producing music for video games can actually prove a fairly easy task for seasoned producers.\n\nA good way of getting yourself noticed by TV producers and game developers is to start building a portfolio of original high quality samples that shows off what you can do.\n\n9. Start a YouTube channel\n\nWith the rise of social media and music influencer marketing, many producers have turned into vloggers in their own right, using Youtube to not only upload their beats for others to use, but also to grow their fanbase by putting out regular music production content and establishing themselves as an authority in the field.\n\nCreate a consistent upload schedule and start putting out engaging content that budding musicians would love to see, such as;\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nDonât forget - monetising your channel is the important bit. But youâll only be able to monetise your channel once youâve reached 1000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours.\n\n10. Earn as a live DJ\n\nHandy on the decks?\n\nIf live performing is your thing, getting DJing gigs can go hand in hand with music production. Extending your role to that of a live DJ, could add a hefty amount of supplementary cash flow to your back pocket!\n\nThe good news is, the live electronic music scene is booming!\n\nThe bad news is, thereâs a lot of competition.\n\nThe best advice is to start small and local when it comes to reaching out and breaking into the DJ scene, by playing sets at nearby clubs and pubs. Then once youâve built some clout, you can start moving up the ladder into bigger clubs and venues, where you can get paid by promoters, venue owners or sell tickets to your sets.\n\nIn both scenarios, youâll also be earning more income off the back of performance royalties - so itâs a win-win situation really!\n\n11. Impart your wisdom\n\nMore and more people are eager to learn new skills - especially those they werenât taught in school.\n\nMusic production is a sellable skill that you can share with newcomers to the field and industry.\n\nThereâs a few different ways you can approach teaching what you know, including:\n\nâ\n\n12. Sell your merch\n\nBesides simply selling your music, beats and samples, you can make a heap of dolla selling personalised music merch that your fans can wear (or use) with pride!\n\nSelling your merch - whether thatâs a mug, t-shirt, hat, keyring, poster, badge or something else - can actually prove pretty easy and affordable to do.\n\nOnce youâve designed and manufactured your merch, you can start distributing it via your website, or using e-commerce platforms like Printful and Shopify.\n\nCheck out our list of 10 cool merch ideas to get you started with a seriously killer merch line!\n\nâ\n\nâ"
