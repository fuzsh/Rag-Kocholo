        "text": "Plant music is a way of monitoring electrical signals of plants as sound. Through patented sonification technology, PlantWave measures biological changes within plants, graphs them as a wave and translates the wave into pitch.\n\nWith PlantWave, every single note you hear is a real-time expression of a shift in a plant. The more active a plant is at any particular moment, the more notes you’ll hear. When a plant is less active, it will often drone or even stop producing notes.\n\nPlantWave is a sensor that connects to our free app for iOS and Android. The app has collections of instruments we’ve designed for plants to play. We call these soundsets.\n\nEach soundset represents data from plants in a different way. Choose the one that feels right for the moment or the type of plant."
