        "text": "Interested to hear from those with highly trained ears where unwanted sounds or musical mistakes have made their way into the final recording. A famous one is John Bonham's squeaky kick drum pedal in \"Since I've Been Loving You\". I've also heard that one of the Stones screws up at the end of \"Tumbling Dice\" but I've never been able to spot it.\n\nEdit: Another one springs to mind. I read somewhere that Sly Stone would often record vocal tracks with random women he'd shagged and re-record when he moved onto his next conquest. The poor tape couldn't take the straon, which is why, for example, the chorus of \"Family Affair\" sounds a bit ropey."
