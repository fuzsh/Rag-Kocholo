        "text": "Just what I needed\n\nSeptember 11, 2019 by jonathan_day from United States\n\nThis podcast was like water in the desert. Once I found it, it turned out to be just what I needed. That was almost 2 years ago. I’ve learned a ton from this podcast. Lij asks the “dumb” questions which makes you feel not so dumb. So honest. So real. Keep it up!\n\ngreat podcast\n\nSeptember 1, 2019 by Chat-Happy from United States\n\nAlways enjoy this one. Good guests with good insight on studio stuff of all kinds\n\nFantastic podcast!\n\nAugust 26, 2019 by ??‍✈️?? from United States\n\nRecording Studio Rockstars in an invaluable resource for those in the the audio engineer, recording, and music creation communities. If you are a student, hobbyist, or a seasoned professional you will gain valuable insight from the experience of Lij Shaw and his guests. Highly recommended! Charles H. Root, III Electric Owl Works, LLC\n\nWarm tone across the spectrum\n\nAugust 19, 2019 by Matt7_7 from Australia\n\nLike any good podcast you can take this one anywhere with you and it's like having an old friend there. This is largely due to the host Lij's wonderful manner - warm and playful, and self-deprecating almost to a fault. Personality aside, it is clear that Lij possesses a wealth of experience and knowledge extending to all areas of sound, recording and production. He also has a wonderful range of guests on the show, so rather than just listen to engineer after engineer talk gear, you might one day hear an acoustician talking spaces, and the next a songwriter talking processes and giving practical tips. And of course there are a couple of engineers in the mix (excuse the pun). And what might at times seem highbrow and beyond the reach of many aspiring students of recording, Lij is able to condense into simple 'take-aways' - a credit to his broad understanding of all things sonic, but also to the needs of (some of) his audience. Thanks a lot Lij and keep up the great work!\n\nTapeOp was in podcast form\n\nJuly 26, 2019 by rockstar 336 from United States\n\nThis podcast is as inspiring as TapeOp. I learn so much each episode. I love the format and the humor! This is a must listen!\n\nGreat Podcast\n\nJuly 12, 2019 by Ruckus Studio from United States\n\nFull of wisdom, great insights, and valuable knowledge. I learn a lot, even from people who work in genres I have no interest in. Love this podcast!\n\nRecording rockstars podcast\n\nJune 21, 2019 by isrealmac from United States\n\nVery interesting listen!!\n\nTrumpet for a 4 track!!!\n\nJune 13, 2019 by Sullyrocs from United States\n\nSounds like an awesome podcast not everyone understands studio sound or live sound enjoyed your interview\n\nThis is a well made podcast! Excellent!\n\nMay 30, 2019 by Bob Barney from United States\n\nI’ve listened to many podcasts, YouTube videos, whatever, on the subjects Lij covers, and these are extremely valuable. If you just listen, these folks plainly say really impactful clues and kinda “big picture” stuff right there on the show. Then there’s Lij’s questions / comments. Really awesome!\n\nGod I love this podcast\n\nMay 25, 2019 by Scott h Stevenson from Australia\n\nSee above ?\n\nSimply amazing!\n\nMarch 27, 2019 by MetalJethro from United Kingdom\n\nYes this podcast has helped a lot with incites into every part of the studio life ! Lij keep them coming!\n\nTwo thumbs way up\n\nMarch 23, 2019 by Cfahitfjeo from United States\n\nLove this podcast. I learn something almost every episode and even when I don’t I’m still entertained.\n\nValuable Resource!\n\nMarch 16, 2019 by lnxguit from United States\n\nLij Shaw’s show is educational and entertaining. I’ve learned a lot from him and his guests. It’s hard to believe these podcasts are free of charge!!\n\nAwesome\n\nMarch 9, 2019 by Jimbo21120 from United States\n\nI love listening to this!\n\n95% fun 95% info...\n\nMarch 4, 2019 by Fruity2x! from United States\n\n...I save the other 5% for sleep (see episode 181 for the joke) Honestly though this is a really great podcast not just for the info but Lij is a really cool dude. The times I’ve made a comment on Twitter or FB he has replied back and even poked me about a typo that still makes me laugh sometimes when I hear him joke around with his guests. The cool thing is he gets his guests to tell stories and you never know what coolness will come from it, hell sometimes I find out I’m doing things real producers and engineers do!!!\n\nGreat stuff\n\nFebruary 18, 2019 by Jimmy Record from United States\n\nReally valuable conversations and insights, loving it.\n\nInto the groove\n\nFebruary 15, 2019 by T. myradar P. from United States\n\nLig, I appreciate that you aren’t afraid to dig deep into the grooves and thoughts of your guests to find out what and why they do what they do and what makes it “work” for them. Very insightful. Even on a budget, it’s great to be able to apply methods used by Wessell, Charles Holloman, and every awesome guests to the tools available to to a DIY passionate music lover like myself. Even though my studio is my home, the results are amazing and can only improve. Appreciate you keeping it real! Keep up the good work!!\n\nGood Stuff!\n\nFebruary 12, 2019 by drum u from United States\n\nThis has been a valuable tool to for me starting out in recording. It’s so helpful to hear real stories and tips from some of the industry’s top mixers.\n\nLij rocks\n\nFebruary 3, 2019 by AAU14 from United States\n\nAnd so does this podcast!!\n\nAlways a good time\n\nJanuary 31, 2019 by L0123NZO from United States\n\nSo glad I stumbled upon RSR and this killer community. Lij is an expert conversationalist with a deep love for music and recording (and some incredible guests) - I love the honesty and accessibility of his work. Are you ready to rock???\n\nCan't get enough!\n\nJanuary 24, 2019 by KatherX from United States\n\nThis is actually the 1st Podcast I'm reviewing (which says a lot) because it's THE BEST ONE FOR RECORDING/MIXING/MASTERING! I've been listening to Lij's Podcast for the past 6 mos or so and I'm hooked! I'm a drummer and have a jam band here in Denver, CO. I started recording my band on a handheld recorded about 6 years ago, moved to multitracking in Garageband and have been a Logic Pro X user for the past 3 or so years. Needless to say, I've caught the recording/mixing bug and my skills have been steadily improving thanks to all those that share their knowledge. Thanks for this Lij!!!\n\nGood resource\n\nJanuary 8, 2019 by gsbe_com from United States\n\nI enjoy this podcast and Lij’s style of interviewing is super laid back. The guests that I’ve listened to have all been interesting and I learned a few things. I’ll continue to listen and would recommend it to other audio nurds\n\n4/5\n\nDecember 17, 2018 by Shortyboyboy from United States\n\nI am really enjoying this podcast, especially when the interviewees talk more about recording approaches / gear / studio tips. The only thing that gets me about this show is when the audience is referred to as “rock stars”. It makes me cringe - every time. Going back to referring to us as “listeners” would be a good move. I’m only being so blunt about this because i feel like it would greatly improve the quality of professionalism that I feel this show has the potential of gaining. Thanks for reading\n\nRockstars rockstars rockstars\n\nNovember 25, 2018 by cyclopian from United States\n\nGreat conversations, great guests, invaluable tips and info about recording and production. But, please, Lij, could you stop calling us listeners *rockstars*? It’s not cool or ironic, it just comes off as dad-speak. Or, on the other hand, we could make a drinking game out of it...\n\nInto the groove\n\nNovember 9, 2018 by T. myradar P. from United States\n\nLig, I appreciate that you aren’t afraid to dig deep into the grooves and thoughts of your guests to find out what and why they do what they do and what makes it “work” for them.

I started to listen so I could make the tracks I record in my bedroom studio sound better. Your interviews open up whole new worlds, for people outside of professional music circles, and it's been great listening to your guests talk about their musical and professional journeys, as they share tips and techniques. I enjoy the format. The consistent range of questions posed to the diverse guests has illuminated the broad variety of ways to work and play in the studio. I've learned a lot, been inspired, and it's a \"good hang.\" Keep it up!\n\nBrilliant interviews\n\nAugust 30, 2018 by ChristopherCf from Australia\n\nThis is the best site I have found for home studio information.

If it weren’t for what I’ve learned listening to this show, who knows how many more years would have been wasted ignorant of how to create sound. It’s so nice to be able to listen rather than read about this stuff; it seems easier to listen, and maybe that’s all I’ve needed all along to finally be motivated to learn to mix. Thank you Lij Shaw!!\n\nThe real deal!!

Guests that I’m interested in and some I had no idea I was. The casual conversation is just a blast to listen to. Just enough geeking out, and the back bios are awesome. Lij’s seemingly repetitive format of canned questions might have appeared too formatted at first glance, but I look forward to hear the different responses to the same questions. (Might be cool to splice a montage of answers together!) Would love to see Lij get Mitch Easter and Dave Fridman on a podcast... can allways dream! Great show! Keep up the great work, casual conversation and commitment to help us get our learn on!

I've listened to several similar podcasts as well, and this is by far my favorite - Lij's questions are on point and he is great at keeping the guest talking but interjecting when it is appropriate.

Thanks Lij, keep up the good work!\n\nA Wealth of Information\n\nSeptember 27, 2017 by The sound palace from United States\n\nI run a small studio and subscribe to a number of audio-based podcasts. Each serves an important role. I cam across Recording Studio Rockstars and was intrigued by the name. After listening to a current one I went back to the first one and listened to each on sequentially. Many had interviews with people I never previoulsy heard of or presented topics I was sure would not be relevant to my situation. Without exception I always took away new useful information and tips for some facet of the audio world. Lij has a natural way about him and tends to ask questions of his guests almost at the moment I was starting to ask myself. Great work, Lij. Keep it up! If you're ever in California, drop by and we'll have our own \"Jam Session.\"\n\nLij is the man!\n\nSeptember 1, 2017 by _Chris_Graham_ from United States\n\nLove his show, love his personality.

Lij Shaw interviews people in the business of recording, mixing, mastering, production, songwriting and all things \"recording studio\". In addition to his own studio chops and experience, he has developed an excellent talent for interviewing the other pros, drawing out the classic tales of missteps, mayhem and meant-to-be happy accidents. Nostalgia, humor and minutiae pervade, but so do legitimate insider tips and tricks. Not all guests are created equal, but on the rare near-snoozers, I find myself listening more to Lij and cheering him on. Thanks to Lij and the different pros that he has exposed his listeners to, I have actually learned how to mix songs. I'm still learning, but suddenly finishing a long lost dream to release my own solo album is within my grasp. If you are interested in recording music, tune in to this podcast. Listen and learn. Lij rocks!\n\nLove the show\n\nJuly 23, 2016 by Mztzza from United States\n\nI have heard every show and loved every one of them.

The fact that he is giving away his 25 years of knowledge as well as interviewing other incredibly knowledgeable engineers and producers is amazing...not to mention extremely generous. I highly recommend adding this show to your weekly podcast diet. Enjoy!!!\n\nImmediately Hooked\n\nOctober 9, 2015 by Lsizzle123 from United States\n\nLij is a real rockstar. Immediately I felt like this man will take me to the rockstar world, help me sound fantastic, and connect with other stars in the world of recording. The introductions of the guests were amazing too! Lij this show is really spot on and its got an immediate hook! I am registered/sub’d and tuning in.\n\nShaw\n\nOctober 8, 2015 by Merissa Marx from United States\n\nGreat podcast!!\n\nSo great!\n\nOctober 8, 2015 by Lil-J90 from United States\n\nThere is some great content in here! Love the energy!\n\nLij is the shij!!!!\n\nOctober 8, 2015 by cueball73 from United States\n\nI will put it like this... I have done many interviews in my life. But Lij is the Howard Stern of producer/engineer interviews! He kills it!!!\n\nLij knows his stuff!\n\nOctober 8, 2015 by nickdrum1234 from United States\n\nLij Shaw is talented, knowledgeable, passionate and knows how to talk about the studio in ways that non-professionals can understand. This isn’t his first Podcast, but this subject is one he knows extremely well. He stays busy in E. Nashville because he is a great human being, with great ears who knows how to listen and communicate, and delivers the highest quality musical product for his clients. He mastered my first ever solo release this May and it sounds incredible. This is a must listen for anyone interested in the recording studio and wants to learn how to improve their craft, whether it’s a songwriter, studio musician, or studio engineer.\n\nNot just for Engineers/Gear-heads\n\nOctober 6, 2015 by TheKid615615 from United States\n\nI’m so pumped to discover this show! Lij’s caliber of guests and witty conversation give a lo-fi home recorder like me such great insight into the world of the true rockstars in the studio: the engineers.

Lij interviews producers, engineers, studio owners and other professionals who share their insights and experiences to help home studio owners create the best recordings possible. He has a comfortable style and lets the guests easily and clearly share their illuminating stories. Bravo, Lij, wish you great success with this fine idea!\n\nJust what I needed\n\nOctober 2, 2015 by Kern of Home Recording Weekly from United States\n\nLij is warm and welcome. His topics are on point. If you play an instrument, record music, mix, master, or like music in some way, you are going to love this podcast. I am just hearing the last episode, so please get some more done! Love the topic, the guests, and the music too.

I'm eager to hear each new show. Shout out from MA!\n\nThese are great!\n\nSeptember 30, 2015 by The Real Yorkie from United States\n\nThese podcasts cover a lot of great info! Hey are especially helpful to people just getting started in the recording industry and those who have been doing it professionally. Lij asks his guests questions all beginners ask at some point. My favorite question is, \"if you were dropped into a random city, what recording equipment would you use, how would you find people to record, and how would you make ends meet while you do it.\" Keep them coming!\n\nGOLDEN!!\n\nSeptember 28, 2015 by ornellagreg from United States\n\nA great podcast for both pros and beginners! Finally a show that explains what really goes on behind the scenes in the studio. As someone who is just getting into the audio world, this is the perfect podcast. Keep on keeping’ on Lij!!\n\nGenuine, entertaining insight into the recording process\n\nSeptember 26, 2015 by RapperBC from United States\n\nI'm loving what I'm hearing here! Finally! A killer podcast that delivers great interviews with experienced studio professionals, relating their stories of hard-won studio success, frustration, failure, hilarity and everything in-between… hence the name \"Recording Studio Rock Stars\". Cool, colorful, informative and fun. Covers the artistic and technical aspects of recording with equal poise and skill. Perhaps its greatest strength is the balance between the artistic methods and vagaries of the studio and the technical details that make studios work day-to-day. If you're interested in how studios work– or are a professional yourself, and just love hearing great studio stories– you should definitely have a listen!\n\nReally enjoyable\n\nSeptember 25, 2015 by Björgvin Benediktsson from United States\n\nI’m a huge audio nerd and love hearing about other methods by engineers and producers so this is a great show to listen to. Vance Powell’s episode was especially entertaining and I enjoyed his enthusiasm and tenacity to becoming the engineer/producer that he is today.\n\nThe REAL thing!!\n\nSeptember 24, 2015 by Marky Mark Moneystacks from United States\n\nWow! I am a professional recording engineer & music producer and if you want to hear about how things REALLY happen in the recording studio to make the music you listen to, this is the podcast! Hard to believe who Lij has on this show. Google his guests and see. Lucky us!! Can't wait for the next episode!\n\nSlapshot!\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 by Slapshot Jay from United States\n\nI love this show. Lij is definitely the man when it comes to becoming a rockstar in the studio... Awesome guests! Fantastic! Great job and congrats on your launch Lij!"
