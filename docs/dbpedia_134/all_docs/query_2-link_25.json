        "text": "What happens to unused tax credits?\n\nCARRYBACK AND CARRYFORWARD RULES\n\nUnused tax credits related to the project may be carried back three years and forward 22 years for projects placed in service in 2023 or later (projects placed in service before 2023 can carry the tax credits back one year and forward 20 years). After 20 or 22 years, one-half of any unused credit can be deducted, with the remaining amount expiring. Tax credits carried backward or forward are not eligible for “transferability” (i.e., cannot be sold).\n\nTAX EQUITY FINANCING\n\nIf a business does not have a large tax liability, tax equity financing may allow the business to take full advantage of federal tax benefits for a solar system. The business can partner with a tax equity investor that has a relatively large tax appetite and can make use of the tax benefits. While solar developers can now transfer tax credits, a tax equity investor may help them take advantage of accelerated depreciation. There are two commonly used models, although the specific arrangements can be quite complicated:\n\nPartnership Flips: The developer and investor form a partnership, and the economic returns “flip” from the investor to the developer after the investor makes use of the tax benefits and achieves target yields.\n\nSale-Leasebacks: The developer sells the solar system to a tax equity investor who leases the system back to the developer.\n\nHow does financing impact ITC calculations?\n\nEligible solar equipment purchased through debt financing qualifies for the ITC. However, individuals (including partnerships or limited liability companies), S corporations, and closely- held C corporations financing a solar project by borrowing on a “nonrecourse basis” face additional rules that may delay claiming of the ITC. Borrowing on a nonrecourse basis means the borrower is not personally liable to repay the loan, and the lender primarily relies on the solar project as collateral. In general, the portion of the solar project paid through nonrecourse financing is not immediately included when calculating the ITC (although several exceptions exist that are commonly satisfied[47]); instead, in future tax years, the taxpayer can claim the ITC on the portion of the loan principal (but not the interest) as it is repaid.\n\nThe amount of both the PTC and ITC may be reduced by up to 15% if tax exempt bonds are used to finance a facility after August 17, 2022. The reduction is the lesser of: i) 15% or ii) the fraction of the proceeds of the tax-exempt bond used to provide financing for the facility over the aggregate amount of additions to the capital account for the qualified facility.[48]\n\nHow do I claim the ITC and PTC?\n\nTo claim the ITC, a taxpayer must complete and attach IRS Form 3468 to their tax return. Instructions for completing the form are available at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i3468.pdf (“Instructions for Form 3468,” IRS).\n\nTo claim the PTC, a taxpayer must complete and attach IRS Form 8962 to their tax return. Instructions for completing the form are available at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8962.pdf (“Instructions for Form 8962,” IRS).\n\nA NOTE ON RECAPTURE RULES\n\nThough the ITC can be claimed in full for the year in which the solar system is placed in service, the business claiming the ITC must retain ownership of the system until the sixth year of the system’s operation, or the business will be required to repay a portion of the tax credit. Because the ITC “vests” at a rate of 20% per year over five years, any “unvested” portion is recaptured (i.e., repaid to the IRS if something happens during the five years that would have made the project ineligible for the ITC in the first place. For example, if the business claims the ITC and then sells the system a year later, after it has only vested 20%, it will have to repay 80% of the amount it claimed from the ITC to the IRS. PTCs are not subject to recapture. If the tax credit has been transferred, the buyer bears the responsibility for recapture.[49]\n\nMore Information\n\nASK QUESTIONS\n\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS), 1111 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20224, (800) 829-1040.\n\nFIND RESOURCES\n\nView SETO's other federal solar tax credit resources.\n\nThe federal statutes regarding the ITC: 26 U.S.C. § 48 and § 48E.

Projects must begin construction before January 1, 2025 to be eligible for the § 48 investment tax credit. Projects beginning construction on January 1, 2025 or later are only eligible for the § 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (which is only available to projects placed in service after December 31, 2024).\n\n[2] 26 U.S.C. § 45 & 45Y. Projects must begin construction before January 1, 2025 to be eligible for the § 45 production tax credit. Projects beginning construction on January 1, 2025 or later are only eligible for the § 45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (which is only available to projects placed in service after December 31, 2024).\n\n[3] The PTC, as written, has a full value of 1.5 ¢/kWh in 1992 dollars, but is adjusted each year using “GDP implicit price deflator” published by the Department of Commerce. The reduced “base rate” offered to solar systems starting construction in 2022 through 2024 that do not meet the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements has a value of 0.3 ¢/kWh in 1992 dollars; the full value is determined by multiplying the base credit amount of 0.3 cent by the inflation adjustment factor, rounding to the nearest multiple of 0.05 cents, and then multiplying by 5. The Internal Revenue Service published a 2022 value of 2.75 ¢/kWh in November, 2022. The calculation of the PTC for projects eligible for the Clean Electricity Production Credit (45Y, for projects placed in service in 2025 or later) does not involve a multiplication factor; those that meet the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are eligible for a PTC of 1.5 ¢/kWh in 1992 dollars and those that do not are eligible for a credit of 0.3 ¢/kWh in 1992 dollars. Because of this subtle difference, the 45Y credit would have a 2022 value of 2.6¢/kWh. See the most recent inflation-adjusted values of the PTC credits.\n\n[4] Projects are also eligible if they began construction prior to January 30, 2023. For more information see 87 FR 73580.\n\n[5] All megawatts and gigawatts numbers use AC.\n\n[6] The IRS has ruled the ITC can be claimed by U.S. corporations, citizens, or partnerships that own solar in U.S. territories; however, companies and individuals are not eligible to receive the tax benefits if they do not pay federal income tax, which means most Puerto Ricans and Puerto Rican companies are ineligible. Therefore, solar assets in U.S. territories would most likely need to be owned by outside U.S. investors to take advantage of the ITC (Farrell, Mac, Lindsay Cherry, Jeffrey Lepley, Astha Ummat, and Giovanni Pagan. 2018. Reimagining Grid Solutions: A Better Way Forward for Puerto Rico.

See: 24 CFR § 5.2003 for the full definition).\n\n[24] A solar project is treated as a part of a “qualified low-income economic benefit project” if at least 50% of the financial benefits of the solar electricity are provided to households with incomes i) less than 200% of the poverty line (as defined in section 26 U.S. Code §36B(d)(3)(A)) applicable to a family of the size involved, or (ii) less than 80% of area median gross income (as determined under section 26 U.S. Code §142(d)(2)(B)). Category 4 projects are required to provide at least a 20% bill credit discount rate for all low-income households, defined as the value of the financial benefits like bill credits minus costs such as subscription fees, divided by the financial benefits.\n\n[25] At least 50% of each category is reserved for projects that are either (1) owned by a Tribal enterprise, Alaskan Native Corporation, renewable energy cooperative (where 51% of the owners are low-income households), qualified renewable energy company (an entity serving low-income communities and provides pathways for clean energy adoption for those households), or a tax-exempt entity (including states, tribes, and rural electric cooperatives) or (2) located in a persistent poverty county (where more than 20% of the population have experience high rates of poverty over the past 30 years) or a census tract designated in the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) (link: https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/#3/33.47/-97.5) as disadvantaged in terms of energy burden, PM2.5 exposure. In the event of over-subscription to given category, priority will be given to applications meeting one or both of the above criteria.\n\n[26] After allocation, a project may not: change location (although there is a grandfather provision should a given location no longer meet location requirements at the time of allocation), increase in size to be greater than 5 MWac or decrease in size by the larger of 2 kW or 25% of project size, fail to meet financial benefits requirements as verified by required documentation, or fail to meet ownership requirements unless the original owner had the right of first refusal to purchase the project after the recapture period.

IRS private letter ruling 201035003. https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/1035003.pdf\n\n[40] Generally, owners of property placed in service after 1986 use the Modified Accelerated Cost-Recovery System (MACRS) in the U.S. tax code to calculate asset depreciation.\n\n[41] Stand-alone storage is not eligible for 5-year MACRS until 2025, but can qualify for bonus depreciation before then.\n\n[42] 26 U.S.C. § 168, https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2017-title26/USCODE-2017-title26-subtitleA-chap1-subchapB-partVI-sec168\n\n[43] A half-year convention is a tax principle that treats equipment as if it were installed in the middle of the tax year (regardless of when it was actually installed), allowing half a year’s depreciation for the first tax year. The half-year convention effectively spreads the five-year MACRS depreciation over six years, with the first year being calculated as half of the 200% declining-balance basis.\n\n[44] Before 2018, any unused depreciation could be carried back 2 years and forward 20 years, but that changed with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Who Needs Sec. 179 Expensing When 100% Bonus Depreciation is Available?” Thomson Reuters Tax and Accounting. October 5, 2018. https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/who-needs-sec-179-expensing-when-100-bonus-depreciation-is-available/)\n\n[45] The bonus depreciation, after 2018, is available for purchased new and used equipment.
