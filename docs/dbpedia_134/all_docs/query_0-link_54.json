It’s a comfort to the future of audio knowing these students will soon be in the field, and no doubt future thought leaders of the industry.”\n\n“In the ever-growing competitiveness of the audio and production industries, CRAS stands out as an example of the kind of institution the SLATE companies prefer to be associated with. As evidenced by the caliber of graduates in the field, the faculty at CRAS do a wonderful job of honoring and enlisting the technology of the past in order to inform students of the techniques and tools of the present.”\n\n“I have had the opportunity to lecture at CRAS a number of times and never cease to be impressed by both the staff and students. It’s a highly technical environment and the facilities are chock full of wonderful, state-of-the-art gear, sure, but the thing that impresses me most is the “family” feel among the staff and students and the level of technical chops and professionalism among the staff. In my book, the über-experienced CRAS staff members are rockstars in the tech-ed world and do a wonderful job of preparing students for their ultimate careers. Be it worship sound, concerts, recording, broadcast, education, film sound, game sound or any other aspect of professional audio and production, the field is wide open to those who possess a solid work ethic, act with integrity, are problem-solvers and put their employers’ needs above their own. Clearly it takes more than technical prowess to rise to the top, but I am confident that if students will keep their eyes & ears open, apply themselves and take advantage of all the opportunities CRAS presents, CRAS can help students craft the solid foundation on which to build successful careers. I wholeheartedly recommend CRAS.”\n\n“We are extremely impressed with the quality of the graduates coming out of CRAS. Their strengths in critical knowledge areas such as signal flow and problem solving really makes a difference in the real world. Even when faced with learning a new console, such as the two AWS948s that the Conservatory installed recently, the students were not intimidated. They went back to their basics, and figured it out. We are extremely happy to have a relationship with the Conservatory of Recording Arts and Sciences, and look forward to being a partner in helping to enable the next generation of engineers.”\n\n“RTS Intercoms is extremely impressed by what the Conservatory of Recording Arts has achieved and is geared up to achieve in the future. The investments done throughout the educational facilities are nothing short of astounding. CRAS’s investments in the latest and greatest technologies are sure to deliver a very real-world experience for their students. We are more than delighted to consider ourselves a partner with CRAS and are looking forward to help educate the future broadcasters of America.”"
