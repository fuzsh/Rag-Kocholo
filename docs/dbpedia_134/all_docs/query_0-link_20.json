        "text": "Katiana Giacona was driving past a redwood-sided but otherwise inconspicuous building in Sausalito with her boyfriend one day when he happened to mention that Dave Matthews recorded his albums “Before These Crowded Streets” and “Busted Stuff” in that very place.\n\nA big Dave Matthews fan, she was surprised, amazed and fascinated.\n\n“I thought that was the coolest thing,” she remembers. “I had no idea what was inside.”\n\nBut she was determined to find out. Now, after nearly a decade of research and writing, the 38-year-old San Rafael resident is the author of a new book on the history of the legendary studio, where many of the biggest stars of rock and pop recorded some of the greatest hits of the past half century.\n\nA casualty of the digital revolution, the fabled facility closed in 2008 — 51 years and 44 hit albums after its famed Halloween party opening in 1972 that included John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who came dressed as redwood trees, as well as fellow Beatle George Harrison, whose yin-yang wooden invitation still hangs on the wall just inside the front doors.\n\nThe book grew out of Giacona’s work as a DJ at Harmonia Marin, a wellness spa and social club that moved into the Record Plant’s “Garden Studio” in 2015. It closed in 2020.\n\nIn a campaign to attract new Harmonia members that was advertised on Airbnb Experiences, Giacona began leading tours of the long-shuttered building, originally a sister studio of Record Plants in New York and Los Angeles. Billed as the first so-called “resort studio,” it gave musicians the luxury of working in a relaxed, uber-hip setting that featured a room with a waterbed floor, a hot tub and Jacuzzi, a kitchen and organic chefs, a boat at the ready on the waterfront and other hedonistic amenities indulged in by such rock sybarites as Sly Stone, who had his own decadent lair nicknamed “the Pit,” and the notorious Rick James.\n\n“Nobody had ever created a recording studio with a resort vibe,” Giacona says. “Back then, studios were lots of fluorescent lights and guys in suits and ties. They were like laboratories.”\n\nOnce the word got out that you could actually go inside this renowned piece of rock real estate, music fans jumped at the chance, turning it into something of a tourist attraction.\n\n“People would come from all over the country and all over the world,” she says. “I even did a tour once in Italian. These were people interested in music history, like music nerds. My kind of people.”\n\nHer hour-long tour would take in the cartoon animal band of musicians on the front door, the intricate hippie-era cedar and redwood sunburst on the wall in Studio A and the padded, paisley-patterned wall decorations in psychedelic colors in Studio B. She showed her guests the building’s oddball architecture — the curved hallway in the shape of a boat hull, the port hole windows and a shower in the shape of the ace of spades with a fun house mirror on the ceiling.\n\nThe most popular part of her presentation would always be the “listening experience” at the end, when she would display the covers and play tracks from some of the classic albums that were recorded there, including “Sports” by Huey Lewis and the News, Metallica’s “Load” and “Reload,” Stevie Wonder’s “Songs in the Key of Life” and, most famously, Fleetwood Mac’s 1977 chart-buster “Rumours.”\n\n“For music geeks, to be in the place where these songs were recorded gives them chills,” she says. “‘You mean we’re in the room where John Fogerty recorded ‘Centerfield?’ It’s mind blowing for them.”\n\nAs she researched and gathered information and vintage photographs for her tours, she put everything in a binder that eventually grew into her book.\n\n“The book is a virtual walk through of the building,” she says. “It’s also a history of the building itself.”\n\nShe interviewed the studio’s last owner, Arne Frager, as well as former engineers, receptionists and employees. She worked particularly closely with “Rumours” producer Ken Caillat, who wrote the foreword, hailing her as the Record Plant’s “official historian.”\n\n“Her passion for the building and its history is remarkable,” he writes.\n\nPlainly titled “Record Plant, Sausalito Studio,” with a sepia-tinted photo of the building’s redwood-clad façade and its 2200 Bridgeway address in large numbers on the cover, the book is part of Arcadia Publishing’s “Images of America” paperback series, which the South Carolina-based company says “celebrates the history of neighborhoods, towns and cities across the country.” If its format looks familiar, it’s because there are hundreds of hometown histories in the series, including one on Marin County and some of the county’s cities and towns.\n\nThe book’s 128 pages are packed with photos, including rare pictures of the opening night party, as well as promo shots and album cover art with the narrative written in captions. Unfortunately for a studio with such a colorful design and history, all the photos are in black and white, a requirement of the publisher.\n\nGiacona, daughter of Sausalito artist Salvatore Giacona, tried to cram in as much information as she could under the restrictions of the company’s formula. She goes pretty deep into the weeds, reprinting the Record Plant’s floor plan as well as architectural drawings of the World War II Marinship shipyard building that had originally been on the site. She even includes specs and lists of the technical equipment and microphones that were available along with the studio rates, circa 1991, $250 an hour, $2,200 a day.\n\nShe painstakingly compiled a partial discography of albums recorded there, a valuable asset for rock history buffs, and delves into the live concert broadcasts from the Record Plant by the progressive rock radio stations KSAN and KFOG.\n\nAlong the way, she unearthed some fun facts: Stevie Nicks writing Fleetwood Mac’s smash hit single “Dreams” while hiding out in “the Pit,” Sly Stone’s sunken studio. And a teenage Prince recording his debut album, “For You,” there in 1977, playing all 27 instruments on the record himself.\n\n“Listening to the album, you can hear the beginning of his style,” Giacona says. “It’s Prince before he was Prince. It’s like his birthplace.”\n\nIn her introduction, she mentions the episode in 1984 when the studios were taken over by the federal government after a former owner was busted on drug manufacturing charges, leading to the place being briefly dubbed “Club Fed.” For the most part, though, she shied away from the more salacious parts of the Record Plant’s rich lore and mythology, preferring to focus on the rock ‘n’ roll and leaving out the sex and drugs.\n\n“I omitted a lot of that,” she says. “I had to stick to the facts. I wanted to focus on the music rather than the drug stories or the party scenes. I focused on how the albums were made and in which studios, details about the architecture and the woodwork and the vibe that was created. Because it was really the vibe and the aesthetic that really drew in the musicians.”\n\nCaillat, her mentor on the project, spearheaded the investment group that bought the building in 2020 for just under $3.6 million from Marin Mortgage Bank, which had foreclosed on it in 2009.\n\nSince then, renovations have been underway to preserve and restore one of the last surviving physical pieces of Marin’s storied rock history. From the beginning, the plan has been to transform the Record Plant into a more viable version of its former glory.\n\nAnd Giacona is looking forward to being part of that.\n\n“I learned so much writing this book and I’m still learning,” she says. “I would love to do tours there again and I still get requests for them. There’s absolutely interest in this place.”\n\nGiacona will sign books and play music recorded at Sausalito’s Record Plant studios at 1 p.m. Aug. 13 at the Sausalito Center for the Arts at 750 Bridgeway. Books are available for $35 at salgiacona.com. They are also on sale at Mill Valley Music at 320 Miller Ave. and Watts Music at 1211 Grant Ave. in Novato.\n\nContact Paul Liberatore at p.liberatore@comcast.net"
