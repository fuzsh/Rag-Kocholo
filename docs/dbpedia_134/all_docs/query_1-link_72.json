        "text": "Few pizza parties are as productive as the one Jessi Alexander, Connie Harrington, Deric Ruttan had in Alexander's basement. That's when the three songsmiths finished up a promising tune they'd been working on called \"Mine Would Be You.\" The song became a hit for Blake Shelton in 2013. Ruttan recalled that writing session in a conversation with Bart Herbison of Nashville Songwriters Association International.\n\nLet’s go back to the genesis of the song, you knew Connie, you had written with her before, but this is day one co-write ever with Jessi.\n\nDR: Yeah, and it was strange. Well, not strange, but cool and interesting. Jessi and her husband, Jon Randall, are great friends of mine and my wife’s. In fact, they sang at our wedding. I’ve known Jessi since she graduated (from) MTSU, but we had never written together. She and Connie had a great relationship, and Connie and I had written a couple of times, so the three of us got together ... Connie and I have similar personalities. We both like to get in and dig and we’re very exacting and can be precise and drive each other crazy, quite honestly, Bart.\n\nBut you’ve got to love the results.\n\nDR: Right. So she throws out a title, and Jessi and I (say), “Man, that’s really cool,” but in true songwriter form, we keep throwing out titles. But we keep circling back to “Mine Would Be You” because we’re like, “That’s the one.\" Something set our songwriter spidey-sense off.\n\nAnd maybe what really got that spidey-sense magnified: Jessi had a little bitty guitar that day.\n\nDR: She had borrowed a little high-string guitar. And as I remember it, she picked it up and after she tuned it, she kind of played just some random chords, and I was like, “Man, that’s cool.” And I pick my guitar up and I play what’s the verse progression in “Mine Would Be You.” And so just organically it kind of started to come together ... When it serves the song, I’m a big advocate of getting to the hook as quick as you can. And so that’s what kind of drove the short verses in that song and sticking the title on the end.\n\nSo you get to the hook, you’ve got this killer musical thing ... and you three realize you’re onto something, but, baby obligations. Jessi’s got to pick up the kids and you don’t get to finish it. And I find this maybe the most interesting part of the story behind the song. What happens next?\n\nDR: At this point we felt like we had something really special here and we were all eager to finish it. Connie had a demo session a week later. So we got together two nights later, I think, at Jessi and Jon Randall’s house (they’re married) and so we conspire ... We planned to get together and we say, “we can finish the song while we conscript our spouses to cook us dinner upstairs.” So my wife, Margaret, and Jon Randall, Jessi’s husband, cook us homemade pizza upstairs while Connie, Jessi, and I are downstairs finishing this song.\n\nThe other interesting thing, I’ll never forget, you know, we’re tweaking on lines and the door opens and Jon Randall comes in with baked pita chips and he’s serving. I said, “thanks, Jon. Thanks, pal.” You know he wrote “Whiskey Lullaby,” but thanks for serving us chips.\n\nThat last verse and that last chorus, where the lyric is different, and you realize, “Oh, wow, these two people are broken up, and this is not just a straight up love song.\" Country songwriters, we aspire to do that on a lot of our songs. I mean they can’t all be that way, with that flip and that twist, but as a lyricist, I’m especially happy when you can come up with something like that ... and then we got to play it for my wife Margaret and Jessi’s husband, Jon. They came down, and we played it for them. And they’re both songwriters, both great songwriters.\n\nI’m thinking the three of you and another pizza meal in that basement might be overdue, pal.\n\nDR: I agree.\n\nAbout the series\n\nIn partnership with Nashville Songwriters Association International, we will release a video interview with a songwriter about his or her work each week."
