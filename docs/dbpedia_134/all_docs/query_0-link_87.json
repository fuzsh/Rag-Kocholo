        "text": "There are two well known live recordings of Fleetwood Mac in 1974. One took place on October 4, 1974, in Hempstead, New York. It's a bootleg that I've posted here. Another one took place on December 15, 1974, in Sausalito, California. I haven't posted that one because it was officially released in 2020 as part of the box set \"1969-1974.\" But there's also this bootleg concert. It seems to have been almost entirely overlooked, judging by how little it's mentioned on the Internet. But, like the other two, it comes from a live radio station broadcast, so the sound quality is excellent. It also contains two songs not on either of the other ones: \"Coming Home\" and \"I Loved Another Woman.\"\n\nIn 1974, Fleetwood Mac was led by the singer-songwriters Bob Welch and Christine McVie. Welch would leave at the end of 1974 and would be replaced by Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, leading the band to much greater fame and fortune. For this concert, the band was promoting the album \"Heroes Are Hard to Find,\" which had been released just a few days earlier. However, only three songs are from that album: \"Coming Home,\" \"Angel,\" and \"Bermuda Triangle.\"\n\nI keep finding concerts where the vocals are too low in the mix. This was another one, although it wasn't a severe case. As usual, I used the UVR5 audio editing program to boost the vocals relative to the instruments. Also as usual, I boosted the volume of the banter between songs quite a lot.\n\nThis was part of a radio series called \"Live at the Record Plant,\" done by the radio station KMET. So that's why I have that in the title. The band's December 1974 concert mentioned above was also recorded at a studio called \"The Record Plant,\" but that was a totally different place, in Sausalito instead of Los Angeles.\n\nThis concert is an hour and eight minutes long.\n\n01 talk (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n02 Coming Home (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n03 talk (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n04 Sentimental Lady (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n05 Future Games (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n06 Bermuda Triangle (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n07 The Green Manalishi [With the Two Prong Crown] (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n08 Why (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n09 Homeward Bound (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n10 talk (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n11 Angel (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n12 talk (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n13 I Loved Another Woman (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n14 talk (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n15 Spare Me a Little of Your Love (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n16 talk (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n17 Oh Well, Part 1 (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n18 talk (Fleetwood Mac)\n\n19 Rattlesnake Shake (Fleetwood Mac)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/15302720/FleetwodMc_1974_LveatRcordPlntLsAngelesCA__9-19-1974_atse.zip.html"
