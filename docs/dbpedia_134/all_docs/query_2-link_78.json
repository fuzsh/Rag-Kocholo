        "text": "I believe that 'Virgin' carries a DDD SPARS code, and I am pretty sure it also said 'A Full Digital Recording' along the bottom of the CD booklet.\n\nNot so sure about True Blue, as the only copy of that title I ever had was the cassette.\n\nDASH decks were the hot thing at the time that both of these albums were recorded, and I am pretty damn sure that most if not all of the major studios had at least one of them, so I would guess that True Blue might at least be digitally recorded. Not sure about mixdown though.\n\n-Aaron\n\nIt's in the liner notes. \"Like A Virgin\" was recorded at The Power Station in NYC, produced by Nile Rodgers, engineered and mixed by Jason Casaro, and the band was basically Chic, of which Rodgers was also a member. It was a multitrack DDD recording, done on a 16-track Sony DASH.\n\n\"True Blue\" was produced, recorded, and mixed by Stephen Bray. I have my CDs packed away, so I can't say whwre it was recorded, but if I recall, it was done in L.A.. My guess is that it was an analog Dolby SR recording.\n\nThe next album, \"Like A Prayer\", was also recorded, produced, and mixed by Stephen Bray, but was DDD recording.\n\nActually, most of both True Blue and Like A Prayer were produced by Pat Leonard, with just a few tracks on each produced by Bray. And they weren't the engineers, just the producers."
