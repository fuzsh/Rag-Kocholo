The Record Plant, the iconic Los Angeles recording studio that boasted that it spawned more hits and Grammy Award-winning music than at any other studio in the world, is closing its doors after 55 years.

Record Plant Recording Studios in Hollywood opened in 1969, following the opening of a New York location, which closed in 1987. Another outlet in Sausalito closed in 2008.

The list of all-time best-sellers recorded at the L.A. location includes Eagles’ Hotel California, Guns N’ Roses Appetite for Destruction, and Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours, among many others.

Los Angeles Magazine reports the studio was a victim of advances in recording technology.

Studio engineer Gary Myerberg told the outlet, “There is no money in the recording music business. That’s basically like a flyer for your show. I don’t think there’s much hope for the recording industry in LA. If you want to go to the studio and spend $2,000 a day, just take that and buy a laptop and a sample library, or tell AI what song you want to make and it’ll make it.”

Guitar technician Jesse McInturff added, “The need for a big room is pretty minor at this point. There are less and less rock bands, and you could record Taylor Swift in a vocal booth the size of a closet.”

Record Plant was more than a studio. It offered suites for clients, a hot tub, waterbeds, bondage gear and even mirrored ceilings.
