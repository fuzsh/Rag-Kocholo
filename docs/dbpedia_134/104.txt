Lyrics:

I'm a cold heartbreaker

Fit ta burn and I'll rip your heart in two

An I'll leave you lyin' on the bed

I'll be out the door before ya wake

It's nuthin' new ta you

'Cause I think *we've seen that movie too

'Cause you could be mine

But you're way out of line

With your bitch slap rappin'

And your cocaine tongue

You get nuthin' done

I said you could be mine

Now holidays come and then they go

It's nothin' new today

Collect another memory

When I come home late at night

Don't ask me where I've been

Just count your stars I'm home again

'Cause you could be mine

But you're way out of line

With your bitch slap rappin'

And your cocaine tongue

You get nuthin' done

I said you could be mine

You've gone sketchin' too many times

Why don't ya give it a rest

Why

Must you find

Another reason to cry

While you're breakin' down my back n'

I been rackin' out my brain

It don't matter how we make it

'Cause it always ends the same

You can push it for more mileage

But your flaps r' wearin' thin

And I could sleep on it 'til mornin'

But this nightmare never ends

Don't forget to call my lawyers

With ridiculous demands

An you can take the pity so far

But it's more than I can stand

'Cause this couchtrip's gettin' older

Tell me how long has it been

'Cause 5 years is forever

An you haven't grown up yet

You could be mine

But you're way out of line

With your bitch slap rappin'

And your cocaine tongue

You get nuthin' done

I said you could be mine

You should be

You could be mine

Yeah!

Quotes regarding the song and its making:

Talking about writing the song:

[Recounting the first preproduction session to Appetite for Destruction]: We booked ourselves time at S.I.R. studios with Mike [Clink] at the board, the band felt free to be ourselves; at our very first preproduction session, we started writing what would later become 'You Could Be Mine.' (...) We weren't in there to write new material, but we were so comfortable that it just came to us.

Bozza, Anthony, & Slash (2007). Slash. Harper Entertainment: New York. p. 166-167

'You Could Be Mine' was another track that wasn't new: it was written during the Appetite sessions and I always felt that it should have been on that album, because it is more reminiscent of that time than anything else on the Use Your Illusion albums.

Bozza, Anthony, & Slash (2007). Slash. Harper Entertainment: New York. p. 166-167

And this next video starts out with a pretty cool drum beat, but I actually didn’t come up with the idea. Duff did. I just want to tell the public that now.

MTV, May 1993

[Before You Could Be Mine] This is a song Izzy wrote about his girlfriend, Angela.

You Could Be Mine stands out because it represents my entry into Guns N' Roses. I remember I had this punk rock rolling beat at the top, and by accident I put that fill on. I threw it in because I was a huge fan of Terry Bozzio and he did that fill but about 10 million times faster.

Rhythm Magazine, July 2009

That song, and Perfect Crime, we started writing when we were doing pre-production for Appetite. You Could Be Mine was one of Izzy's riffs, and as always with Izzy, he woulc play something and it would catch me ear, and I'd play along, but in my own sort of style. [...] That song didn't change at all [when they recoded it for UYI] apart from the fact that I used a tremolo bar.

Total Guitar Magazine, July 2011

Talking about the song:

We don’t do drugs - but we do drink a lot. A lot of the drug rumors about us started because we have a song called 'Cocaine Talking' on the album. But that song’s not about us or our experiences with the drug. If you listen to the lyrics, it’s about how all these nice young girls in L.A. can’t do anything before they do their coke. The song’s definitely not a pro-cocaine song. It’s about how the shit really fucks up your head.

The beginning of 'You Could Be Mine' has got feedback on it which sounds like more than one guitar, but it's just one guitar.

Guitar For The Practising Musician, April 1992

[Being asked what 'With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue' means]: It doesn’t mean anything. And if it means something, I don’t remember it.

Popular 1, September 1993; translated from Spanish

My personal favorite Guns N' Roses song, that would be You Could Be Mine.

Talking playing the song live:

The first time I had to play 'You Could Be Mine' [live] my mind went "What have I done, I've gotta sing this now!"

TMS with Eddie Trunk, November 2011

[Talking about his favourite songs to play live]: The [title] track to Chinese Democracy is one of my favorites, also "You Could Be Mine".

LA Weekly Blog, December 2011

I really always get a kick out of playing You Could Be Mine. It is just a bass heavy, great riff song, it's really fun to play.

My favourite song to play is You Could Be Mine, that’s so fun to play as a drummer. It’s a lot of fun. That one’s like shifting in a car. You’re peeling out then hit a low gear, then you’re cruising. You have to shift the gears. It’s balls out.

Music Radar, June 2016

You Could be Mine [is my favorite to play]. I like the more funky and grimy stuff like Brownstone, Rocket Queen and Jungle but You Could be Mine is the most fun to play.

The most fun song I play every night is You Could Be Mine. I love Matt's parts, I love them. It sounds like you're changing gears in a car, it's amazing, you know.

Flashback: Guns N' Roses Meet the Terminator

In video for 1991's "You Could Be Mine," The T-800 targets Guns N' Roses for termination

"You Could Be Mine" was actually written around the time that Guns N' Roses recorded Appetite for Destruction, but they didn't start playing it live until early 1991. To promote the single, they shot a video in which the Terminator shows up at a Guns N' Roses concert to target the band for termination.

The first quote from Duff is interesting. Both because he hilariously claim the band doesn't do drugs, but also because he mentions what must be You Could Be Mine (=Cocaine Talking) and that it is on the album - in 1988! Maybe he meant on the forthcoming album, or maybe he was so drunk he couldn't remember they hadn't released the song already.

Paul Elliott, writing for Kerrang!, would in June 1991 say that the band had a demo of You Could Be Mine with them to England in June 1987:

"THE BAND had a rough demo of 'You Could Be Mine’ when they were holed up in Kensington on their first trip to the UK back in the Summer of ’87. Between those famous Marquee gigs, they played a song on a ghetto blaster and sang Axl’s lines in rough harmony. The band are now a little older and a lot richer, but this song is still the same hard bastard, only with cooler guitar breaks" [Kerrang! June 20, 1991].

Together with Duff's quote above, it implies it was worked on around the time when the band wrote and recorded 'Appetite' and considered to include it.

New single released today, from May 16, 1991, at the Ritz. This was the third time the song was played live and from the third and last "warm-up" show before the UYI tour started: https://www.a-4-d.com/t4990-12-january-july-1991-touring-mayhem#19453

It's interesting to hear it, but I am not the biggest fans of Axl's vocals from this period.

Not a big fan of the video. I generally don't like it when they mix in footage from other songs and shows to make the performance "cooler". I would have preferred just using multiple cameras from the same performance. Makes it more truthful. I also don't like that Izzy is barely featured.

As for the performance, really sloppy and poor with mistakes all over and Axl's voice is terrible. I'd gladly take any performance after 2009 over this.

Still, cool to see.

I would have preferred a video with the actual performance of You Could Be Mine as well. But I guess that will be on the blu-ray, and this video serves as some kind of a trailer for it, so I think it's a good video as such.

I think the band in 1991 still had some of the raw energy of the Appetite era, and spontaneity - and even the sloppiness - was part of that whole charm. I definitely prefer that over technically "flawless" performances.

I like the video because it has a nostalgic perspective for me. The 90s was a great decade!

My thoughts exactly

Soulmonster wrote: As for the performance, really sloppy and poor with mistakes all over and Axl's voice is terrible.

Yes it is sloppy, yes it has mistakes, yes Axl voice is not great.

Maybe other songs won't have so many mistakes. I listened (and listened and listened) to dozens of bootlegs by them, I know some of them by heart, and I have NEVER, EVER heard ANYTHING REMOTELY SIMILAR to the full blown mess that is the intro of the song.

I fully believe they did this on purpose to back up their bullshit, three-decade long narrrative that "Izzy can't play", "Izzy's amps had to be turned off during the Illusion Tour because he was playing all wrong etc". Well, guess what, four months before this show Izzy was playing (and singing) magnificently in Rio including the new songs! So how you expect me to believe that he forgot how to play 4 months later?

Anyway, I love it the way it is. THAT is (was) Guns n' Roses. For real. Like you said above, thruthful. The truth is what it is and it is always better than the fake stuff. Like the nonsensical, comical, pathetic Axl studio vocals on "Fake Era 1987-1993".

I just wish I could hear (and see) Izzy's guitar properly, I just wish I could hear the backing vocals properly all through the song (and not just for the spots that they chose to allow me to hear it) etc.

I vastly prefer Axl's voice in the 80s to these grating chainsaw sounds.

As for Izzy, I agree it is too bad he is so low in the mix but when I said it was sloppy playing I was thinking about Slash's performance. Just lots of mistakes.

But all in all, great with warts and all.

Yeah, I agree, there are a lot of 80s live recordings were Axl's voice is much better than on this recorrding.

1991 was a rough year for him voice-wise.

There are some good shows. Rio (both nights). Alpine Valley night 1 also. He seems to have a great voice on that night.

I like how he soldiered through most of it and pushed it to the very limit. He would never, ever do that again.

In 1992 he completely changed his approach and started to sing in a controlled, restrained, studied way. And that is basically like saying that Axl started to sing in a "non-Axl" way.

That, along with Izzy leaving, Tracy and Roberta circus, Goldstein enabling, Slash and Duff zombieness, and Axl growing isolation from the real world changed completely the entire dynamics of the band -- or what was left of it.

I didn't really notice Slash's mistakes there, other than small things here and there. Was there any major mistake that you noticed by Slash that annoyed you when you heard it? I am curious about it.

Maybe I am just too used to them thanks to bootleg addiction, hahahaha, I don't know. I guess he just played like that back then, very loose, and he always recovers well somehow. All the greats do.

I love that he still plays loose like that even though his playing style has changed dramatically on the last ten years or so and I don't like much of it.

No, I can't hear any big mistakes with Slash's playing (the intro is Izzy's fault, in my opinion), but there are some missed notes, bad notes and not perfect bends throughout. Just a bit sloppy. More sloppy than expected for Slash, even in this period. The main problem with the guitars is really that we don't hear so much of the interplay of guitars since Izzy is so low in the mix, but that could also be that Izzy had a bad night and didn't play well

As for Axl's voice. It was really weird in 1991. One thing is how much distortion (rasp) he applies so it masks the nuances and makes it harder to hear if he's even on key, but he also seemed to have less sustain in 1991 - he barely held the notes. It is just weird. And when he needed to sing fast and with holding his breath, and aggressive, like in the middle part of this song, it just turns into a garbled mess. It must have taken a terrible toll on his vocals. I just don't get why he decided to sing like this and not like in 1988. He roped himself in a bit for '92.
