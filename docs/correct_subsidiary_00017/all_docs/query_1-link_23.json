Though the MP3 players, expected to hit the shelves this holiday season, have been put on hold, the development of the Zing media software continues.

The project is headed up by Tim Bucher, a former Apple engineering executive, who will have an uphill battle in garnering industry support for this ambitious project as Dell’s prior track record in the MP3 marketplace is rather poor. Remember Dell’s DJ Ditty? Need we say more?
