And all because you didn't have the balls to say \"f*ck you\" to my face.\"\n\n—Zing to Li Yong[src]\n\nZing is the leader of the Fung Hai. He forged an alliance with Mai Ling and the Long Zii to overthrow the previous leader and wage war with the Hop Wei. However, his reckless nature caused Mai Ling's lieutenant, Li Yong, to turn against him, which ultimately resulted in Zing's arrest after he is framed for the murder of several local white men.[1]\n\nBiography[]\n\nForging an alliance with the Long Zii[]\n\nZing accompanies his commander to a meeting with Mai Ling and the Long Zii to discuss a possible alliance. Unbeknownst to Pai, Zing and Mai Ling have conspired against him, having poisoned his food, allowing Zing to assume the position of leader of the Fung Hai and forge an alliance with the Long Zii.[2]\n\nSending Bill a message[]\n\nAfter Bill refuses to pay the debt he ran up at the Fung Hai casino, Zing decides to send him a message by going after Lee, who he takes down with little difficulty, beating him to the point of unconsciousness.[3]\n\nBill arrives at the Fung Hai gambling den and shoots a Fung Hai hatchet man in the leg before demanding to see their boss. Zing arrives and disarms Bill, killing one of his own men with Bill's gun, proving to Bill just how savage the Fung Hai are. Zing reminds Bill that he owes them a debt, but it's not money they want. Instead, he employs Bill as an enforcer.\n\nZing meets with Mai Ling, who is upset over the extra police presence due to Zing attacking Lee. Zing replies that it doesn't concern her. He agreed to their partnership because it was a way for him to gain leadership and get the Fung Hai into the opium business, but he informs Mai Ling that he doesn't work for her and that Fung Hai will continue to do business as he sees fit, even if that means killing ten cops. With that said, Mai Ling tells Zing that he's been paid for his trouble and that they'll work something else out moving forward. Refusing to simply leave the opium business, Zing invites them outside to show them his army waiting just outside their door. And with that in mind, he wants to discuss the details of their partnership.[4]\n\nAfter completing a few collections, Bill believes that he has paid his debt and is done working for Zing and the Fung Hai. However, Zing insists that Bill continue to work for him, for which he is fairly compensated.[5]\n\nKilling the Suey Sing[]\n\nZing accompanies Li Yong to send the Suey Sing tong a message after learning that they were secretly dealing opium. Li Yong simply means to warn Lao Che, and in response, Lao Che replies that he understands. Li Yong is satisfied and is prepared to leave, but Zing picks a fight with Lao Che, attacking him, with his men following his lead and killing many of the Suey Sing. When all is said and done, many are dead, and Li Yong is enraged, but Zing reasons that Mai Ling sent him along for this exact reason.[6]\n\nGoing after Bill's family[]\n\nZing gets an unexpected visit from Mai Ling and Li Yong after he turned up short based on the opium receipts. Zing claims that he charged them a small service fee for killing the Suey Sing, but that isn't what they agreed upon, and Mai Ling expects the money she's owed by the end of the day. She also warns him that the next time Zing goes against another tong without consulting her, she'll consider it a breach of their agreement and kick him out of the opium business.\n\nAgain, Bill tells Zing that he is done. He's more than paid his debt, but Zing isn't willing to let him go. Bill warns Zing that if he or his men even look his way again, he'll bring the full force of the police department down on the Fung Hai. But he doesn't heed Bill's warning and sends his men to kill Bill's family.\n\nZing confronts Chao after he failed to deliver his daggers. Chao reveals that he got wiped out. Not to mention, Chao doesn't trust the Fung Hai. Last time Zing's boss ordered from him, he didn't pay. Zing questions if this why he helped set Pai up to be killed and confronts Chao for having no loyalties. Zing then drops half of the payment for his daggers at Chao's feet and tells him that he'll get the other half when he delivers the order.[7]\n\nFramed as the swordsman[]\n\nChao delivers Zing's daggers as promised. However, unbeknownst to Zing, he's being set up by Chao and Li Yong, who has infiltrated his den as a helper. Zing pays Chao what he's owed plus more as a down payment on future endeavors. However, Chao doesn't take money he hasn't earned and leaves behind Zing's \"down payment.\" This, however, doesn't work for Zing, who explains that the Fung Hai only do business with family and orders his men to hold Chao down as he pours a gallon of milk down his throat to welcome him into the family. However, Zing when learns that Chao has set him up, he orders his men to hurt Chao badly but keep him alive.\n\nZing heads to his room, where he finds Li Yong, who Zing informs that after he kills him, he's going to see Mai Ling, have sex with her, and then kill her. The fight ensues, with Li Yong proving that he is indeed the superior fighter, forcing Zing to resort to grabbing a sword, the very same sword Li Yong had just planted in his room to frame him as the swordsman that's been killing people. Bill arrives and catches Zing with the sword in hand. So, Zing turns his attention to Bill, but Lee intervenes and shoots Zing in the shoulder. Bill then digs his finger into Zing's wound and promises to make him suffer for his crimes.[1]\n\nHeld at San Quentin Prison[]\n\nZing is taken to arraignment, where Bill explains to the judge that they found a sword and a pocket watch that belonged to one of his victims. Based on that evidence, Bill tells the judge that Zing is in fact the swordsman they've been after. Zing is found guilty of first degree murder and is sentenced to death. His sentence is to be carried out at San Quentin Prison, where he will be hanged.[8]\n\nZing is in San Quentin Prison. He is told to stand up and assume the position by the guards. They instruct him to hug the bars as they throw his lunch into the cell. In hugging the bars on his window, he notices that they're loose.[9]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nZing is ambitious, fearless, and soft-spoken, never outwardly losing his temper, but inside he’s sadistic, ruthless and enjoys dominating people. He worked with Mai Ling to kill his former boss and agreed to an alliance with the Long Zii to place his tong in a strong position.\n\nSignificant kills[]\n\nSuey Sing Tong — Zing led his men into Suey Sing territory and slaughtered the tong at Mai Ling's behest.[6]\n\nFung Hai Tong — Zing killed two of his men at Mai Ling's behest in the coup against Zang and one when he talked Bill into working for him.\n\nSkills and abilities[]\n\nZing is a skilled a fighter , though less skilled than Li Yong, who bested him during their battle at the Fung Hai base. However, he had little difficulty in dispatching Richard Lee and the Suey Sing tong. Zing is also bilingual, fluently speaking English with a thick accent.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nThe White Mountain\n\nChinese Boxing\n\nIf You're Going to Bow, Bow Low\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nLearn to Endure, or Hire a Bodyguard\n\nThe Chinese Connection\n\nNot How We Do Business\n\nIf You Don't See Blood, You Didn't Come to Play (credit only)\n\nNot for a Drink, a F*ck, or a G**damn Prayer\n\nTo a Man with a Hammer, Everything Looks Like a Nail (credit only)\n\nIf You Wait by the River Long Enough\n\nAll Enemies, Foreign and Domestic (credit only)\n\nEnter the Dragon (credit only)\n\nMan on the Wall\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nA Window of F*cking Opportunity\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nZing is portrayed by Dustin Nguyen.\n\nHe was initially a recurring character on the series.
