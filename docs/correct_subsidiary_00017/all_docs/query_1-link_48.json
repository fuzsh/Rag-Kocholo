        "text": "I was lucky enough to attend the Miami Grand Prix F1 Race this weekend and witness the incredible combination of driver skill and advanced technology. Being the data nerd that I am, I was super intrigued by HOW it all gets done with #data üòÇ Millions of data points, totaling several terabytes of data are generated by each vehicle during the course of a single race. The ONLY efficient way to store and make use of any of it is is using a data lake. The data can then be used in real time for optimizing race strategy, pit stop timing, and braking analysis. After each race, that data can then be used in analytical and AI models to optimize vehicle design and do race analysis. Increasingly, people are turning to open lakehouse architectures with Trino and Iceberg to do this. First developed by leading hyperscale internet companies like Facebook and Netflix, these technologies create the foundation of a scalable AI strategy. Read more in Timothy Prickett Morgan's excellent article below: https://lnkd.in/ebvTRbiQ PS Thank you to Amazon Web Services (AWS), Jason Guesman, Jon Jones, Carol Potts, Joshua Kempf for inviting me to this amazing event!\n\nThere is a pattern I am seeing in data architecture. It started with the internet companies and is now showing up in data-driven organizations of all shapes and sizes. That pattern is an open data lakehouse that combines the performance and functionality of a data warehouse with the flexibility and cost of a data lake. I am calling this open lakehouse an ‚Äúicehouse.‚Äù Read the Icehouse manifesto here: https://lnkd.in/egCVeYZy #trino #iceberg"
