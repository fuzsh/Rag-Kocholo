        "text": "Information technology (IT) is the foundation of an efficient working environment and plays a central role as a catalyst for digital transformation. It aims to reduce the burden on the workforce and to optimise and accelerate business processes. It makes a decisive contribution to business success through customised IT strategies and services. However, factors such as limited human resources, a lack of IT expertise or a complex landscape of different service providers can affect IT operations and thus become an obstacle.\n\nAs a managed service provider, SBIT AG is the competent IT partner for medium-sized companies in Germany. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of IT services as well as a wide range of modular service options. It is up to you to decide on the scope of our co-operation. We take on areas such as consulting, development and management of IT projects, support your internal IT department with our Managed IT Services or take over your IT processes completely. Our experts develop customised solutions that meet your specific needs and are implemented in a modern, future-proof IT infrastructure."
