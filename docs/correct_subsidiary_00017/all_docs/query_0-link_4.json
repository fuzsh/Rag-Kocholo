Seriously, companies register marks and domains all the time, so this could turn out to be nothing more than a training exercise for some new lawyer -- but Dell has said that the Zing acquisition will be used to expand its \"capability to provide great product experiences,\" so maybe this time next year we'll be trying to choose between Zings, Zunes, and iPods.
