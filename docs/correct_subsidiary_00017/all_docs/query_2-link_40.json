        "text": "As the Greek philosopher Heraclitus famously said, 'change is the only constant in life'. And there is no denying that pharmaceutical sales teams have experienced a lot of change over the last three years. The most significant one being that in-person meetings are out, and digital engagement is in. However, finding a digital solution that enables pharmaceutical sales teams to engage with prescribers and other healthcare professionals (HCPs) effectively can be difficult. To help make the process easier, the team at P360 developed this informative buying guide. The following pages highlight everything pharmaceutical sales teams need to know about the trends and technologies that are shaping the future of HCP engagement.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of changing policies, mounting regulation and skyrocketing costs, pharmaceutical companies are investing heavily in their organization's digital transformation. Everything from how R&D is conducted to how brands connect with HCPs and patients is being reinvented. And for pharmaceutical sales operations, improving prescriber engagement is the top priority. But unfortunately, many of the current solutions ignore one very important thing: what prescribers want when it comes to the pharma-physician relationship.\n\nWith all the data in, the need for a digital-first HCP engagement strategy is clear. However, there are some very important things to consider before making a buying decision. That only scratches the surface of all that needs to be considered. However, the above are some of the most important things to consider. For example, technology can check off all the internal boxes, but it is useless if HCPs fail to adopt it.\n\nUnfortunately, not every solution is going to hit the mark. Even technologies that have been effective in the past are no longer viable. Take email marketing platforms for example. Everyone has an email account, and it's been the workhorse of digital marketing programs for years. However, the reality is that roughly 80% of marketing-related emails go unread. According to a leading pharma brand that we interviewed, this is because nearly half of the emails pharmaceutical sales teams send HCPs end up in Spam. And once your emails are marked as Spam, they can stay that way for good. Unless, of course, the HCPs IT department intervenes.\n\nThanks to the advent of Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store, mobile apps have experienced a meteoric rise in popularity for more than a decade. Their widespread adoption is due in part to their easy, touchscreen accessibility and ability to go wherever a smartphone user goes. Because of this, they've made Web portals mostly obsolete. After all, why hassle with a computer, URLs and logins when you can just pull an app up and go from there?\n\nAccording to Business of Apps, Google's Play Store has 2.39 million apps on it. Apple's App Store has even more, with 3.6 million. And therein lies the problem. The app market has become completely oversaturated and is now working against itself.\n\nMobile is a must for HCP engagement. Even as far back as 2014, 90% of physicians were already using smartphones to access pharma-related information. And today, prescribers and their staff are using their devices to do even more, including communicating with pharma reps. As such, apps are a step in the right direction.\n\nHowever, apps don't check off all the boxes pharmaceutical sales teams need. But there is one solution that does... SMS text messaging. From a healthcare practitioner's point of view, it's a preferred solution. Here are some reasons why:\n\nHere are some reasons why\n\nZING makes it easy for pharma reps to provide HCPs with QR codes, which is a type of barcode that can be read by a smartphone. Like links, QR codes enable instant text, call or video communication. The QR codes can even be personalized for each brand. And they can be programmed to connect directly to the appropriate rep. QR codes improve HCP engagement by:\n\n83% of the pharmaceutical executives we surveyed said compliance is their top priority. The reason being is that compliance-related violations cost companies millions of dollars each year. But with ZING, avoiding compliance issues is a breeze. All the messages, digital assets and replies to sales teams send to HCPs can be preapproved by compliance and preloaded into the system. That way, nothing gets out that isn't already approved.\n\nWith the ZING, pharma teams can exchange compliance-enabled two-way unified messaging with healthcare professionals without barriers. There are no apps for end-users to download and there are no subscriptions for them to deal with. To HCPs, ZING offers a seamless, hassle-free experience that's seen as nothing different than their normal method for receiving texts. To do this, ZING uses native text messaging on an HCPs iOS or Android device with pre-built integrations with major CRMs. ZING also makes it easy for pharma IT teams in terms of data management and integrity for things like territory alignments, roster changes and other specific data integration needs. Compliance can track every communication, end-to-end. And managers can measure activity and results with ZING's powerful dashboards.\n\nWith in-person meetings on the decline and nearly 80% of emails going unread, a leading biopharmaceutical company was looking for a new, more effective way to send compliance-approved messages and other digital assets to HCPs and office staff. Although a vital part of the complex healthcare equation, time-strapped HCPs no longer had the bandwidth for in-office meetings with company reps. They wanted a more convenient way to receive pharma-related information and support. And it had to be a way that enabled them to get what they needed, when they needed it, and without interruption.\n\nThe client turned to P360 and ZING as a potential remedy for its HCP engagement woes. ZING made it easy for the client to send things like MLR-approved templates, coupon codes and other resources to HCPs and office staff. Reps also had the ability to jump into conversations when needed—from their own devices. And enabling features like two-way text messaging, voice and video calling and more from the same platform provided consistency and a unified touchpoint for HCPs.\n\nIn the past, it took multiple systems and devices to perform all of these tasks. But not with ZING!\n\nWith ZING, the client has been able to improve HCP engagement significantly. More than 90% of messages to HCPs are read, with an incredible 55% click-through rate on links and other assets. In addition, the company's sales force now has the ability to send compliance-approved messages and other resources instantly. In addition to better engagement, ZING was able to ease the client's legal and compliance concerns thanks to its administrative controls and customizable workflows. ZING was also able to handle the client's complex data retention requirements by providing a full view of field operations by providing a dashboard that includes reports and other insights into platform usage."
