        "text": "My mother confessed to me, one time in her later years, that she had always expected to be famous. She didn’t know why she thought she’d be famous, but she was sure it would happen. It didn’t. At least, it didn’t happen in the sense she had anticipated, the media blitz, the front-page articles, the recognition. It did happen, however, from the perspective that she was dearly loved by a large circle of family and friends. She was famous amongst these dear ones for her enormous heart, her willingness to hear out the ramblings of another’s heart, her ability to give freely of herself for others.\n\nWe, each one of us, have specialness within. Yes, each of us. You have it. I have it. Your neighbor has it. While we may not become famous in modern day terms, we can make an immense impact on our lives and on others’ lives. But, it can’t happen from a kitchen chair. It takes action, action on our part.\n\nTo begin, we must listen to our heart. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you say. It does sound somewhat mystical, maybe a bit ethereal, but our heart is speaking to us all the time. It can be hard to hear our heart because the rest of our life is so noisy. We’ve got to work to pay the bills, buy our home or educate our children. We need to care for our Mom or our failing friend and most certainly for our children. It’s a noisy life loaded with tweets and beeps and rings.\n\nJust because life is noisy doesn’t mean your heart stops speaking. It means you need to listen more carefully. Some people’s hearts scream their message and they know from the get-go exactly what it is they need to do with their life. That’s how we find so many talented dancers and singers on reality TV. That’s how we get organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving – they were mad and created MADD. Their hearts spoke and they followed. That’s what Steve Jobs (Apple co-founder), Bill Gates (Microsoft co-founder) and Mark Zuckerberg (FaceBook founder) did, they followed their hearts. That’s what your favorite author did; they followed their heart and wrote.\n\nOthers of us don’t have quite such a loud heart. We’re not driven to the dance floor, to creating a national organization, to founding a company or to writing a book. That’s okay; many of us have a quieter heart. But, is that true? Is our heart quieter or have we not listened carefully enough? Or, is it possible our quieter heart feels drummed out by the power of others around us?\n\n1. Pay close attention. That sounds like sophomoric advice but we’ve already agreed, it’s a noisy fast-paced world. Take notes during the day. What were the positive, neutral and negative sensations you experience during the activities of your day? Make this a habit. Over time, our lives change. Remember to note your changes over time.\n\n2. When are you in flow? Flow is the positive, energized time of complete absorption. Think about the times when you are so engaged that you lose your sense of time or even sense of place. Make note of those times. Does it happen when you are helping a person? Is it when you are teaching? Is it when you are cooking? What about gardening? Perhaps it happens when you are creating or reading or writing. Keep a log of the times when you are fully engaged. Also, log the activities you don’t enjoy, the ones you can’t wait to have end. These are two very different sensations. Your log will tell you much about what makes your heart zing.\n\nNow, flow is not when you play computer games and time passes. That’s more mind numbing than mind satisfying. Instead, you are noticing the things that absorb you and make you feel satisfied, the things that bring a bit of a satisfied sigh or a bit of a smile or a simple nod to yourself, these are the things that define you, the things that help you feel most alive.\n\n3. Find ways to increase your flow experience. With a month or so of logging your experience, you should have enough information. As you review your experience, make special note of the activities and subjects that brought you positive experience. These are the areas you’ll want to emphasize in your life. Develop a list of all the activities associated with your positive, energized engagement. Then, decide which of these many activities fold best into your life? If teaching is your thing, there are many ways to experience teaching without even entering the classroom.\n\nYour goal is to find the things that make your heart zing. That doesn’t mean your sister’s heart zing or your friend’s heart zing, just yours. Don’t despair if what you are hearing from your heart isn’t what you expected. Maybe it isn’t as creative as you’d like, perhaps it isn’t as outgoing as you expected. Listen to your heart and then give its message a chance. Happiness guru Gretchen Rubin tells of her longstanding unwillingness to pursue her interest in children’s books til, one day, she gave in and tried it out. She discovered her heart was right, that she has a deep and satisfying interest in children’s books.\n\nOnce you’ve identified the things that speak to you, find ways to make sure they are a part of your heart-zinging life!"
