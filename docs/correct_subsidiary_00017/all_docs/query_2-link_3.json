        "text": "It takes out the guesswork\n\nWhat I love about this app is it takes out the guesswork. I can take a scan weekly to see how Iâm doing. Itâs only been three weeks and I feel stronger. I canât see any change but I know with consistency that will come. I wish they would add is more to the nutrition side. When you do the scan it gives you the basics. I would pay more to have AI nutrition added.\n\n10 out of 10\n\nThis app keeps me on a good pace with a timer, has a visual for me to follow along with, and shows me the muscles I'm working. I can easily adjust my workout to target a different set of muscles, and change the length of my workout if desired. I've tried many apps, videos, gyms, and even had a personal trainer. This app eliminates all shame and insecurities. 10 out of 10!\n\nAlmost perfect gym app. Only one tweak is needed!\n\nI love this app, I love how it incorporates AI and has a vast amount of personalization to help create workouts suited to you as an individual, my biggest interest is the fact you can put in injuries to specific muscle groups. If possible could you add in more muscle groups or even tendons or joints like wrist joint or calf muscles. This small change could make the difference to be an absolute necessity of an app.\n\nIt is a very well-built app\n\nIâve been using zing for about two weeks now and I gotta say it is worth it. Yes, the body scan has a one-time fee but it is worth it: it is also insanely accurate compared to my in person assessments I get at work. The AI auto-updates based on your routine and performance; tracks your muscles that need recovery; and demonstrates the moves with the proper cadences. It is a very well built app.\n\nThe sessions are always available and differ\n\nHave seen massive differences in my body shape and attitude. It is an expensive app but when you put it against the cost of a weekly PT session then the app pays for itself. The onscreen avatar trainer ensures you are performing each exercise correctly and if you are in a busy gym and cannot use a certain piece of equipment; the app lets you swap but makes sure you are still performing the same workout with the alternative.\n\nDefinitely makes you sweat but is also fun\n\nFor the workouts, Iâve just finished my first one, and while I am sweaty and taking a moment to catch my breath, it was manageable for what I have selected, it kind of feels like a game youâre playing making sure you posture is good to hit the green bar and have your reps counted in the timeframe. Highly recommend this for anyone who has lost their motivation, and is struggling to show up consistently this definitely makes you sweat but is also fun.\n\nGreat app that's just my 1 recommendation!\n\nGoing into week 3, i like this app. I like how the workouts are done with you the entire time. My only recommendation is maybe an update to the health restrictions section. I'm sure using AI could really help with choosing workouts that don't aggrevate prior injuries, but there are only 3 to choose from. I have vertigo where getting up so many times in a circuit makes me dizzy. Great app that's just my 1 recommendation!\n\nA guided exercise app\n\nI am about 20 pounds over my ideal weight and I was looking for a guided exercise app. This app gave me just that but it also has taken into account my personal strengths and weakness which helps me mentally. It gives me peace of mind that itâs not going to tell me to do something impossible for my fitness level and is building upon my current strengths to make me stronger.\n\nRenewed my desire to workout\n\nThis app renewed my desire to workout. It takes into consideration how my whole body and mind feels and how much time I have. Then it creates a customized, effective and powerful workout for me. It tracks my fitness goals and daily progress. I highly recommend it.\n\nIt makes consistency easier.\n\nGreat workouts. I love this app it makes it super easy to go into the gym and work out with different exercises and the demonstrations are very helpful. I hate having to think of what exercises to do and remember to change them up. This makes it thoughtless and has grate flow. It makes consistency easier.\n\nUnlike other workout apps and videos on social media, Zing Coach gives you exercises that are deeply personalized and customized. All fitness programs are individually designed based on your body dataâvia our Body Composition Scan, Fitness Test, and historical data from Apple Healthâand constantly adjusted by AI. Zing Coach is able to tailor your workout by location (gym or home), duration, intensity, available equipment, target muscles, and even health restrictions. Zing Coachâs AI automatically progresses the intensity and complexity of your training based on data to build you the perfect workout, every time.\n\nHaving access to equipment and knowing what to do with it are two entirely different things. Exercising without a strategy can cost you months of wasted effortânot to mention money. Zing Coach turns your gym routine into a fitness strategy, tailored to your body data and goals. Now, youâll get the exact recipe to reach your fitness progress with every workout. Itâs like the personal trainer youâve always dreamed of, but at a fraction of the price.\n\nStudies suggest that people begin to notice changes after a 5% shift in their body weight. Based on your Ñurrent body composition, Zing Coach will count down the days until you hit your fitness goal. The Zing Coach app will also give you realistic and medically safe pathways to gain muscle or shed pounds.\n\nIt doesn't always work out when we're working out.
