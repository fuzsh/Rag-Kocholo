        "text": "Warner Bros. Pictures is an American film production and distribution company of the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group division of Warner Bros. Entertainment (both ultimately owned by Warner Bros. Discovery). The studio is the flagship producer of live-action feature films within the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group unit, and is based at the Warner Bros. Studios complex in Burbank, California. Animated films produced by Warner Bros. Pictures Animation are also released under the studio banner.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, DC Studios, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake in Spyglass Media Group. Barbie is the studio's highest-grossing film worldwide with $1.4 billion.\n\nFounded in 1923 by brothers Harry Warner, Albert Warner, Sam Warner, and Jack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, including Warner Bros. Pictures Animation, New Line Cinema, DC Studios, and Castle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.\n\nLogo[]\n\nThe identity of the film concern is stable. It was almost always associated with the image of the shield in which the abbreviated name of the company is located. Otherwise, everything is variable, since from time to time, a tape, then a text, then an edging, then an image of a building appeared on it. The exception was two periods when there were attempts to replace the shield with the W7 and Big W signs.\n\nSeveral types of fonts resemble the various lettering on the Warner Brothers emblem. These include the eponymous font, Goudy, Charter, Dubba Dubba, and Seven Arts.\n\nThe color scheme is stable and most often consists of a combination of black and white. Red, yellow, orange, and blue were also used.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn Space Jam: A New Legacy, the still version of the current logo without the WarnerMedia byline is shown on a boardroom monitor at the end of the Warner 3000 pitch, with a different shield animation at the end, transitioning into the same logo as shown above. The same studio lot shown in the logo was also shown during the scene leading into the Warner Bros. Serververse. The cloud background in the logo (with the WB shield covered up by windows) was used as the desktop background in a Dell monitor on the Warner Bros. executive's computer. Furthermore, the entire studio lot made another appearance in A Hollywood Christmas.\n\nThe logo depicts the sun rising over the Cahuenga Pass to the south. In real life, the sun rises in the east, over the Forest Lawn Cemetery and the Walt Disney Studios.\n\nCGI by Devastudios (who previously animated the logos for Lionsgate Films and Paramount Pictures). Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the backlot was created using drone footage, original blueprints from the Warner Bros. Studio Facilities and available photography and videography from Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood and Google Earth, all in order to reconstruct it in CGI. The sky and clouds were created with Terragen from Planetside Software.\n\nConsidered to be an exceptionally beautiful and much more fulfilling effort from Warner Bros, this time around, with more realistic effects, stunning CGI and a fresh take on the fanfare."
