        "text": "Iâve been working out regularly for about four years now. Iâve hit plateaus and have had fluctuations along the way like anyone else and I usually get bored after about 3 months and want to try something different or switch up my workouts to avoid plateaus. One thing I do know for a fact is that weight training followed by a circuit will definitely shred you down!!! I did a four week program during the pandemic that followed that recipe and it kept me right!! When gyms started opening again I shifted more towards weight training with cardio warm up and 2-3 days of 20 mins of cardio. I noticed by body wasnât as lean as when doing the circuits after weight training and I love how this app incorporates that into the workout which helps with accountability. Iâve been using this app now for about a week and Iâm trying to play around with it because I need my workouts to be shorter yet still effective as I no longer have the luxury of spending 2+ hrs in the gym like I did in grad school. This app allows you to choose how much time you have to workout and then makes a customized routine for you. The only thing I wish is that you could pick a longer time. Iâm going to stick to the workout plans and not add any extra workouts to see how I fare out after about 6-8 weeks. Iâm looking forward to seeing how this app can help make life easier!\n\nHi! Absolutely love this app & it's helped me with the gym so much, however l've run into a few issues and have a few suggestions. The other day, I noticed my health info in settings was all off. My watch had been tracking my activity every minute - so my workout minutes were at 4x over what they actually were, and my workouts were being tracked 2 or 3 times in my data in apple Health from my watch. I also wanted to suggest, during a workout session, I think you should be able to re-order workouts. I've run into this several times in the gym where if a machine or equipment is unavailable, I'll want to move on to another workout in Zing & come back to the other when the machine is available, but there's no option to re-order the workouts. Then I just get frustrated because I can't switch around my workout based on what equipment I can use. For example, if the order of my workout in Zing is dumbbell press, and then chest press machine next... if the bench isn't open for me to do the dumbbell press, I can't reorder or skip ahead to do the chest press machine at that moment while waiting for a bench to open. That would be EXTREMELY helpful. I also really value the rating how hard or easy a set was, and it only pops up and asks me for a few workouts, if there was a button at the bottom of the screen for each workout to optionally tell Zing how hard or difficult it was, this would be helpful.\n\nHi there! We're thrilled to hear that you're loving the app and find it helpful for your gym sessions. Thank you for sharing your feedback and suggestions. We understand the importance of accurate health data, and we're actively working to address any syncing issues with Apple Health. Your suggestion about reordering workouts and providing feedback on difficulty during each session is fantastic. Our team will take these into consideration for future updates to enhance your experience. We appreciate your support and look forward to continually improving Zing to meet your needs. If you have any more thoughts or questions, feel free to reach out to our support team. Happy Zinging! ðï¸ââï¸ðª\n\n- I have always had a tough time with being consistent with my work outs until I discovered this app! I havenât missed more than two days since I started over a month ago! I was able to easily slip this app into my morning routine and have never felt better since! I look forward to it everyday and make sure I get it done. The flexibility to choose how long you want each session to be allows you to get some activity in no matter how your day is looking. The exercises are effective and show real results in just a week! Consistent is absolutely key and this app has subconsciously helped me with that!\n\n- I will say is that the technicalities of the app itself could be better. Sometimes my music disconnects in the middle of a session or the video demonstration will cut out, but besides that, this app is totally worth it!\n\n- one way to improve the app would be to have more options within the workout session screen. For example, if I choose a 15 min workout and then decide I want to add another 15 min, I want to add that time without starting a whole new workout session. Another would be to allow the user to skip the rest periods or control the amount of time each rest period is. Sometimes they are too long for the exercise at hand. Thatâs just my humble option. But I love this app overall!\n\n9.7/10"
