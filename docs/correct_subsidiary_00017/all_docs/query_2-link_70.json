I then emailed them to try to get it sorted out after £38.95 was taken from my account, and yet got nothing back. Now going through my bank, there is no way for me to get the money back, meaning I’ve lost nearly £45 over a week on nothing.\n\nDate of experience : July 16, 2024\n\nReply from Zing Coach\n\nWe're sorry to hear about your experience. Please make sure you contacted support@zing.coach, as this is the only email address for our support team. If you haven't received a response yet, please reach out to us again so we can assist you in resolving this issue promptly.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nReply from Zing Coach\n\nThank you for your wonderful review, Amelia! We're delighted to hear that you're enjoying the app and appreciate our continuous improvements. Our community is indeed vibrant, and we're glad you're a part of it.\n\nA special thank you for acknowledging Jess's excellent service—she truly is a star on our support team. We're here to assist you anytime. Keep enjoying your fitness journey with Zing Coach!\n\nI really enjoy using Zing Coach\n\nI really enjoy using Zing Coach! It's been a great way to challenge my body in new ways. I had been in a rut, using mostly the same exercises. Zing has incorporated different moves and I'm feeling and looking more fit than I have in a long time! I also like the way the app pushes me, like I want to complete the entire workout as outlined, vs. maybe checking out early without it! I like the feature that shows how restored certain body parts are so you can build new workouts based on what muscle groups are most fresh.\n\nAll that said, I really wish I could change the calendar to only have my workouts scheduled for weekdays. The not-complete workouts from Sat. and Sun. do rollover though and I just jump back in during the week.\n\nOverall, it's a keeper and worth the money!\n\nDate of experience : July 18, 2024\n\nReply from Zing Coach\n\nThank you for your fantastic feedback, Keavy! We're thrilled to hear that Zing Coach has helped you break out of your routine and achieve new fitness goals. It's great to know that you appreciate the variety of exercises and the motivation the app provides.\n\nWe appreciate your suggestion regarding the workout calendar. We'll pass it on to our development team for future improvements.\n\nThank you for choosing Zing Coach, and we're glad to be part of your fitness journey!\n\nReply from Zing Coach\n\nThank you for your fantastic review, Helen! We're happy to hear that the app is a great fit for your training and that our support team has been amazing in assisting you. Your feedback means a lot to us. If you ever need further help or have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. Keep up the great work! 💪😊\n\nReally fast to respond\n\nI have paid for a 4 weeks trial this morning and I can’t access the application.\n\nI didn’t receive any mail to confirm the payment nor that my account has been created.\n\nI saw a lot of bad reviews on trustpilot and started to regret my choice\n\nBut the support responded really quickly to my email and solved the issue I have now access to my account and all the workouts thank’s to them\n\nDate of experience : July 14, 2024\n\nReply from Zing Coach\n\nDear Zineb,\n\nThank you for sharing your experience! We apologize for the initial inconvenience you faced with accessing the app after payment. However, we're glad to hear that our support team was able to respond quickly and resolve the issue for you.\n\nWe appreciate your patience and understanding. We're committed to providing excellent service and ensuring you have a seamless experience with our app. Enjoy your workouts, and feel free to reach out if you need any further assistance!\n\nBest fitness/coaching app I've used\n\nBest fitness/coaching app I've used. Lots of customization options (# training sessions per week, training programs based on owned equipement and/or being at the gym or at home, training duration, etc) and you can even change things on-the-go if you need to (like if you're travelling and couldn't anticipate what kind of equipment you would find, you can just customize your training in a second). Haven't tried the AI thingy yet, but will probably give it a chance.\n\nAlmost 40 euros per month is a bit pricy though, as I don't have the impression the app required heavy maintenance now that it's live.\n\nDate of experience : July 11, 2024\n\nReply from Zing Coach\n\nDear Evan,\n\nThank you for your detailed feedback! We're delighted to hear that you find Zing to be the best fitness/coaching app you've used. It's great to know you appreciate the customization options and the flexibility to adjust your training on-the-go.\n\nRegarding the pricing, we understand your concern and appreciate your input. The cost reflects our commitment to continuous improvement and the development of new features, such as the AI coaching, which we hope you'll enjoy trying out soon.\n\nThank you for being a valued member of our community!\n\nNot happy at all\n\nI enrolled in a seven-day trial for £6.95, but after six days, I was billed £38.95. I have reached out to zing support via email, but have not received a response. As of now, I am unable to locate a button to cancel my subscription on the app or in my subscriptions. I am uncertain about the frequency of future charges to my account. I am extremely disappointed. While I initially wanted to use the app for working out, I am no longer interested. I simply want to cancel my subscription as I cannot afford it.\n\nDate of experience : July 01, 2024\n\nReply from Zing Coach\n\nThank you for the fantastic review! We're thrilled to hear that you find Zing Coach to be a comprehensive and user-friendly fitness solution. It's great to know that our diverse range of workouts is meeting your needs, whether you're a beginner or an advanced athlete. If you have any feedback or need further assistance, feel free to reach out. Happy training!\n\nI was skeptical but……\n\nI was skeptical but one week of workouts has converted me. It’s easy to use and adjust as needed. I’m sore everyday (which is how I like it). I can adjust any workout use any equipment . What I like best it the built in exercise timer . I would like to see a couple more trainer options but that’s no biggie and I would like some more positive feedback in the audio. But overall this is a 5 star service\n\nDate of experience : July 07, 2024\n\nReply from Zing Coach\n\nHi Richard,\n\nThank you for sharing your experience! We're thrilled to hear that Zing has exceeded your expectations and that you're enjoying the workouts. We're glad you find the app easy to use and appreciate the built-in exercise timer.\n\nYour suggestions for more trainer options and positive feedback in the audio are valuable to us, and we will consider them for future updates. Thank you for the 5-star rating!\n\nCan only find the monthly subscription…\n\nCan only find the monthly subscription available and that’s way too expensive. Close to 40 usd for one month?? Sure it motivates me to train, but with both a gym membership and Zing it’s a little too much. I live in Norway. Could that be the reason it’s no other subscription plan?\n\nThis is what I got for answers from Zing support:\n\n“ Currently, the $38 USD plan is the standard monthly subscription in most locations, although prices may vary depending on the area.\n\nAt the moment discounts and promos are offered only when you are in the app. Once you see it, I strongly suggest you take it once it's offered.”\n\nHave anybody gotten an promo offer?\n\nDate of experience : June 23, 2024\n\nReply from Zing Coach\n\nWe apologize for any confusion. We offer 1, 3, and 12-month subscription plans. The availability of plans do not vary based on your location. Please check our website or contact support@zing.coach for assistance in selecting a plan that suits your needs. We appreciate your feedback and aim to provide affordable options for all users, including those in Norway.\n\nAma-ZING Ai app for fitness\n\nZing is an app with a perfect and beautiful design, as well as being incredibly intuitive and simple to use. Analyse many aspects of training, providing useful and detailed data.\n\nI contacted the support and they were extremely kind, responding very quickly. I had suggested some new features and optimisations for the app, and they promptly took my ideas into account and responded to me right away. Support and service are really efficient.\n\nThe workouts offered by Zing are very complete and personalised according to your needs and requirements. It looks like an app for everyone's reach, with a fantastic design that makes the user experience really enjoyable. I highly recommend it!\n\nDate of experience : July 03, 2024\n\nReply from Zing Coach\n\nDear Francesco,\n\nThank you so much for your wonderful review! We're thrilled to hear that you find Zing's design intuitive and beautiful. It's fantastic to know that our detailed training analysis and personalized workouts meet your needs.\n\nWe greatly appreciate your feedback and suggestions. Our support team is always here to help and it's rewarding to hear that you had a positive experience. Your recommendation means a lot to us.\n\nHappy training!\n\ncustomer service is lacking\n\nI have been enjoying the app but have been trying to contact support to change from monthly web subscription to annual iOS subscription with no response. Now I am just trying to get a refund on my trial so I can start over but it shouldn’t have to be this way. I guess they’d rather have people pay way more per month than the annual plan which is actually quite affordable. I really enjoy the app and would like to keep using if someone from Support would respond.\n\nDate of experience : June 15, 2024\n\nReply from Zing Coach\n\nHi Michelle! We're sorry to hear about your experience. Please check your email for updates from our support team as we've successfully resolved your subscription change request and refund for the trial. We appreciate your understanding and look forward to your continued enjoyment of the app! If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nPaid for a 1 week trial and haven't…\n\nPaid for a 1 week trial and haven't been able to use it, app says I don't have a subscription.. Sent several emails to 2 different email addresses, including screenshots of my paypal transaction, got the auto responses then nothing! Trial is nearly over, complete waste of time and money.. my concern now is that they take more money given the poor reviews I read.\n\nDate of experience : June 02, 2024\n\nReply from Zing Coach\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you've experienced. We've addressed the issue with your mistyped email address and successfully resolved it. Please check your email, including spam folders, for further communication from our support team. Your trial period has been extended to ensure you have ample time to explore the app. Your satisfaction is our priority, and we're committed to providing a seamless experience.

We appreciate your interest in collaborating with us. However, it's important to note that a one-star rating without direct experience using our app isn't an ideal starting point for partnership discussions. We value genuine user feedback and encourage everyone to experience our app firsthand before forming opinions.\n\nTried this app Underperforms in many ways\n\nTried this app. Underperforms in many ways. You can't log activities you complete. It tells you, you are underperforming when you complete each set of exercises EVERYDAY it sets for you. You can't see the form of each exercise until you start it and it's timed. Not able to prepare in advance. You must complete each exercise in order, can't hold or complete another exercise while equipment is unavaliable. Can't upload your steps or other activities manually. MUST have an active watch and be connected to Google Health to use. And expects you HAVE a smart watch. You can not use WITHOUT a Smart watch. So why bother. SHOULD highlight that as a MANDATORY detail. You don't know until or IF you contact support. Underperforms.\n\nDate of experience : June 06, 2024\n\nReply from Zing Coach\n\nThank you for your feedback. We're sorry to hear about your experience. While the app aims to provide a structured and efficient workout plan, we understand that flexibility and preparation are important. Your suggestions will be considered for future updates. For logging steps and other activities, please ensure your watch is connected to Google Health. If you need further assistance, please contact support@zing.coach.\n\nReply from Zing Coach\n\nWe’re very sorry to hear about your experience. This is not the service we aim to provide.
