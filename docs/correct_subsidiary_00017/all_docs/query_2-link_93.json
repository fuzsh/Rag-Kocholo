        "text": "Zing Portable\n\nZing MPS\n\nThe Zing MPS is the only multi-position stander that pivots two directions, allowing the unit to go from flat-to-load supine to 20 degrees prone in one motion. There is no need to transfer the user in and out, flip pads, foot plates and trays. This ability provides a therapeutic opportunity not possible with other standing frames. It is also one of the few standers that provides the option of up to 30 degrees of independent leg abduction. Because the abduction pivot point is in alignment with the natural hip pivot of the user, the entire leg abducts eliminating the need to adjust foot plates or knee pads. Not only does this provide anatomically correct abduction, but rotating hip guides and only having to loosen a single knob per leg enables simple and intuitive standing in abduction.\n\nSize 1 – infancy to 44″, 70 lb weight capacity\n\nSize 2 – 40-60″, 154 lb weight capacity\n\nHCPCS Code: E0641\n\nZing MPS TT\n\nThe Zing MPS TT and Zing MPS are capable of supine to prone in one motion, up to 30 degrees of independent leg abduction, and have an available swing-away tray. The MPS TT or tilt-table style features a single, longer, wider upper-body support pad. Padded strapping can be ordered for the knees, waist and upper body, rather than individual support and positioning components such as hip guides and lateral supports. That said, with the MPS TT if more support is needed in specific areas, the same support and positioning components that are available on the MPS can be added to the MPS TT, where needed. For example, order padded strapping for the knees and waist but add lateral supports for more robust upper-body support and alignment. This flexible system can simplify the transfer process for kids who do not require maximum support.\n\nSize 1 – infancy to 44″, 70 lb weight capacity\n\nSize 2 – 40-60″, 154 lb weight capacity\n\nHCPCS Code: E0641\n\nZing Supine\n\nThe Zing Supine provides positioning opportunities from flat-to-load supine to vertical. It is also one of the few standers that provides the option of up to 30 degrees of independent leg abduction. Because the abduction pivot point is in alignment with the natural hip pivot of the user, the entire leg abducts eliminating the need to adjust foot plates or knee pads.

Prone positioning from 0-90 degrees. The ergonomic handle provides easy leverage making position changes simple and quick. It is also one of the few standers that provides the option of up to 30 degrees of independent leg abduction.\n\nBecause the abduction pivot point is in alignment with the natural hip pivot of the user, the entire leg abducts eliminating the need to adjust foot plates or knee pads.
