Rates are dependent on credit qualification, length of term, loan-to-value (LTV), age of vehicle, and if the vehicle is new or used. Auto Loan Payment Example: For a $10,000 loan with a 60-month term, payments at 6.69% APR would be $19.63 per $1,000. 0.75% refinance discount is subject to floor rates. May only be combined with the 0.25% member discount. All other discounts are not applicable. Internal refinances are subject to $150 refinance fee unless $1,500 in new money is added to the loan. By adding GAP, the member may avoid the refinance fee or new money requirement. This offer is valid for well-qualified borrowers with a 700 credit score and above. Zing Credit Union reserves the right to discontinue this offer at any time.\n\n**All loans are subject to credit approval and income verification. Must transfer an aggregate of $5,000 or more to qualify. Balance must stay on the card (except monthly payments made) for 90 days.
