(USA) Inventor\n\nPalatnik De Sousa, Iam\n\nPrado, Adriana Bechara\n\nAbstract\n\nSaliency heatmap generation is disclosed. A mask that corresponds to an image is iteratively passed through a model. At each iteration, the output mask is optimized via gradient descent to gradually turn off one or more pixels. The output mask is iteratively passed in order to minimize contributions of pixels and to maximize a class prediction. After generating a final output mask, a saliency heatmap is generated.\n\nIPC Classes ?\n\nG06V 10/46 - Descriptors for shape, contour or point-related descriptors, e.g. scale invariant feature transform [SIFT] or bags of words [BoW]; Salient regional features\n\nG06V 10/764 - Arrangements for image or video recognition or understanding using pattern recognition or machine learning using classification, e.g. of video objects\n\n2.\n\nSystems And Methods For Provisioning A Database Of Trusted Users Stored Within One Or More Information Handling Systems\n\nApplication Number 18098216 Status Pending Filing Date 2023-01-18 First Publication Date 2024-07-18 Owner Dell Products L.P.

In a CoMP scenario, synchronized downlink transmissions from a connected cell and a cooperating cell are generally not received at the same time by a target user equipment because of different propagation distances from the transmitting radio units; such misalignment leads to performance degradation. By offsetting the downlink symbol timing boundaries relative to each other, a targeted user equipment receives symbols at the desired time boundary, resulting in constructive interference that improves and a cell's downlink throughput and/or coverage. Time alignment via offset symbol timing boundaries also eliminates inter-symbol interference. Modified scheduling can be used to ensure that downlink and uplink transmissions from the coordinated radio units do not interfere with one another.\n\nIPC Classes ?\n\nH04W 56/00 - Synchronisation arrangements\n\nH04W 72/1268 - Mapping of traffic onto schedule, e.g. scheduled allocation or multiplexing of flows of uplink data flows\n\n23.\n\nSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MANAGING RESOURCE ELASTICITY FOR A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT WITH LOGICAL DEVICES\n\nApplication Number 18156310 Status Pending Filing Date 2023-01-18 First Publication Date 2024-07-18 Owner Dell Products L.P.

A bitmap can be constructed by the O-RU having a bit length equal to the number of symbols to be communicated, where each bit of the bitmap corresponds to one of the symbols and indicates whether the corresponding symbol is blank. Such can be determined from counters that can count the number of blank PRBs within a given symbol.

The method further comprises acquiring a pre-trained model associated with the user from a set of candidate models, and generating a conversion model by adjusting the pre-trained model using the first portion. The conversion model is used to convert a second portion of the video stream into a reconstructed video stream, the second portion having a resolution lower than the first resolution and the reconstructed video stream having a resolution higher than a resolution. Such an embodiment can provide high-quality video in a privacy-preserving manner, for example, as part of a secure video service.\n\nIPC Classes ?\n\nH04N 7/14 - Systems for two-way working\n\nH03M 7/30 - Compression; Expansion; Suppression of unnecessary data, e.g. redundancy reduction\n\n78.\n\nMETHOD, DEVICE, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT FOR GENERATING TEST CASE\n\nApplication Number 18138886 Status Pending Filing Date 2023-04-25 First Publication Date 2024-07-11 Owner Dell Products L.P.

A test element in a test case of the test case set is coded based on the position of the test element in the element hierarchy of the test case set. The techniques further involve: generating a second set of coding sequences by performing a random variation related to at least one test element with respect to the first set of coding sequences; and generating a second set of test cases based on the second set of coding sequences. Accordingly, product testing and development may be automated, and the case set may change dynamically in a way that is adapted to product development while significantly reducing the overhead of designing and reviewing test cases throughout the product life cycle.\n\nIPC Classes ?\n\nG06F 11/36 - Preventing errors by testing or debugging of software\n\n79.\n\nAPPLICATION PERFORMANCE ON A CONTAINERIZED APPLICATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CLUSTER\n\nApplication Number 18150357 Status Pending Filing Date 2023-01-05 First Publication Date 2024-07-11 Owner Dell Products L.P.

Various application resources can be mapped to one or more applications, in conjunction with various events and filters. Events can be monitored and reviewed to determine which application resource(s) is associated with the event, and further, the event's effect on the application(s). The events can be filtered based upon the effect on the operational health of the application. For example, if an event is identified as insignificant, the event does not have to be reported. In another example, if the event is identified as being potentially critical to the operational health of the application, a notification can be generated informing an operator that an application may have experienced potentially catastrophic damage. Based thereon, the administrator can then undertake an action(s) necessary to mitigate the damage.\n\nIPC Classes ?\n\nG06F 9/445 - Program loading or initiating\n\nG06F 9/38 - Concurrent instruction execution, e.g. pipeline, look ahead\n\n80.\n\nDIRECTIONAL PADS WITH DYNAMIC TACTILE FEATURES AND METHODS OF USING THE SAME\n\nApplication Number 18150429 Status Pending Filing Date 2023-01-05 First Publication Date 2024-07-11 Owner Dell Products L.P.
