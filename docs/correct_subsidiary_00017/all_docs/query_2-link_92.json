Another round of weed control and pre-emergent is applied to keep weeds at bay.\n\nEarly Summer\n\nIn early summer, our crew will reapply a fertilizer treatment to strengthen your lawn so that it can endure the summer heat and stress, take care of any weeds with weed control, and apply billbug control for protection against these common lawn pests.\n\nLate Summer\n\nOur late summer fertilizer and weed control applications will help your grass continue to thrive and retain nutrients as the summer continues."
