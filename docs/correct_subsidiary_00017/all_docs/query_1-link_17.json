        "text": "In what could be a new assault on the market for handheld gadgets, Dell has agreed to acquire Zing Systems, a company that makes software for distributing and managing music on mobile devices.\n\nZingâ€™s technology allows portable media players to play, store, and navigate music from digital streams.\n\nThe planned acquisition, which was announced Monday, comes as Dell seeks ways to boost sales of computers and other computing devices to consumers, a market in which the U.S. manufacturer is struggling to grow. On Monday, Gartner noted in a report that Dell is losing market share to rivals that are gaining traction in the faster-growing home PC market.\n\nIn a move to attract consumers, Dell opened its first retail channels with Wal-Mart Stores and launched a line of PCs running the open source Linux OS.\n\nIn May, Dell began selling two desktop PCs and a laptop with the Ubuntu 7.04 Linux distribution preinstalled in the United States. On Tuesday, the company announced availability of one desktop PC and a laptop preinstalled with the open source OS in Europe.\n\nWhat Dell plans to do with Zing, however, is somewhat of a mystery, considering that the company has abandoned the market for PDAs and MP3 players."
