I have worked with more than 250 undergraduate students in the past decade. This has included undergraduate research and Senior Design projects. The emphasis is on open-ended challenging projects. Some of the senior design projects have led to actual products. Recent success stories include WARP FPGA Board and WARP MAC Framework. More recently, the students have made great progress in biomedical devices, see Scalable Health Initiative and Rice Wearables Lab. If you are a Rice undergrad and interested in research opportunities at CMC, please write to me. We have projects available throughout the year and prefer students who are looking for multi-semester engagement.\n\nVisiting Graduate Students\n\nZhanzhan Zhang, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2016-17 (wireless)\n\nDonglin Liu, UESTC, 2017-18 (wireless)\n\nCheng Li, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2017-18 (wireless)\n\nHangyu Zhang, UESTC, 2017-18 (wireless)\n\nGengshan Wang, UCAS, 2018-19 (wireless)\n\nFormer Post-docs and Research Engineers\n\nSouptik Barua, ECE (Postdoctoral Researcher 2019-2022, Assistant Professor at NYU Grossman School of Medicine)\n\nTemi Prioleau, ECE (Rice Academy Fellow, Fall 2016-2018, Assistant Professor at Dartmouth)\n\nLi Niu (Spring 2017 – 2018), Assistant Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tung University.\n\nJohn Tadrous , Post-doc, Associate Professor at Gonzaga University.\n\nWenzhou Ouyang, Post-doc.\n\nAdam Samaniego (Research Engineer@Rice), Founder of OcuCheck\n\nGaurav Patel (Research Engineer@Rice), Co-founder of Cognita Labs\n\nSiddharth Gupta (Research Engineer@Rice), now at Amazon Labs.\n\nPatrick Murphy (Research Engineer@Rice), Founder of Mango Communications\n\nCharles Camp (Research Engineer@Rice), now at IBM.\n\nPatrick Frantz, Director and CEO of Cambridge Graphene Platform Ltd\n\nFormer MS/PhD Students\n\nWenwan Chen, (MS’21, PHD’24, health)\n\nAkash Maity, (MS’18, PhD’23, health)\n\nAmruta Pai, (MS’19, PhD’23, health)\n\nNate Raymondi (MS’19, PhD’23, wireless)\n\nTianyu Cao (MS’21, wireless)\n\nXu Chen (MS’18, PhD’21, health)\n\nEwa Nowara (MS’18, health, co-advisor)\n\nXing Zhang (MS’16, PhD’20, wireless)\n\nJune Chen (MS’20, health)\n\nJian Cao (MS’16, PhD’19, health)\n\nXu Du (MS’15, PhD’19, wireless)\n\nFatima Ahsan (MS’18, wireless)\n\nNiranjan Gowda (PhD’18, wireless)\n\nRajoshi Biswas (MS’14, PhD’18, health), co-founder of Cognita Labs\n\nMayank Kumar (MS’14, PhD’18, health)\n\nJaehee Park (MS’18, health, co-advisor)\n\nAndrew Kwong (MS’16)\n\nJingwen Bai (PhD’16)\n\nEvan Everett (PhD’15)\n\nQiong Huang (MS’15)\n\nRichard Latimer (MS’14)\n\nAchaleshwar Sahai (PhD’14)\n\nSahiti Myneni (Committee Member, School of Biomedical Informatics, UT Health), now Professor at UT Health.\n\nPedro Santacruz (PhD’13), now a faculty member at UT Austin, after faculty stint at SJSU and postdoc at UT Austin with Sriram Viswanath and Christine Julien\n\nDebashis Dash\n\nDavid Kao (PhD’12), post-doc at Cornell, then at Google.\n\nChris Hunter(PhD’12), now at Mango Communications\n\nMelissa Duarte(PhD’12), now at Huawei Paris, after a Postdoc at EPFL/UCLA, Switzerland with Christina Fragouli and Suhas Diggavi\n\nKanes Sutuntivorakoon (MS’12)\n\nPatrick Murphy, (PhD’10), now full-time at his startup Mango Communications which he started as a PhD student.\n\nVaneet Aggarwal (PhD’10, Student@Princeton, co-advised with Rob Calderbank), now faculty member at Purdue, after AT&T Research Labs\n\nScott Novich (MS’09), Co-founder and CTO of Neurosensory\n\nSid Gupta (MS’09), CMC Research Engineer (2009-11), now at Lab126, Amazon\n\nChris Steger (PhD’09), now at Netflix\n\nAhmad Khoshnevis (PhD’07), now at Intel Labs\n\nGareth Middleton (MS’07), co-advised with Behnaam Aazhang.\n\nFeifei Lou (MS’05), now at China Mobile, Beijing\n\nArnab Chakrabarti (MS’03, PhD’07), co-advised with Behnaam Aazhang\n\nMohammad Jaber Borran (PhD), co-advised with Behnaam Aazhang\n\nKrishna Kiran Mukkavilli (PhD), now at Qualcomm, co-advised with Behnaam Aazhang\n\nDinesh Rajan (PhD), now Prof@Southern Methodist University, co-advised with Behnaam Aazhang\n\nTarik Moharemovic (PhD’4), co-advised with Behnaam Aazhang\n\nMohammad Ali Khojastepour (PhD’04), now at NEC Research NJ, co-advised with Behnaam Aazhang\n\nNasir Ahmed (MS’02, PhD’07)"
