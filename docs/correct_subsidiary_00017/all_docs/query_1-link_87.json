        "text": "Tickets for this event are limited, please RSVP in advance to reserve your spot. Once the event has sold out, you will no longer be able to purchase a ticket on this page and we will not sell any additional tickets at the door. Please do not show up unless you have previously received your ticket confirmation via email and paid.\n\nThis is an indoor event. We ask that all of our guests wear a mask out of respect for this community and our volunteer team. We want to keep everyone healthy so we can keep hosting in-person events. Please do not join us if you are unable to wear a mask.\n\nIf you've been to one of our in-person events before, you've likely noticed our photographer walking around taking amazing photos and you probably even started a conversation with her at some point. This month, for our last 2021 event, we're honored to officially host one of our longtime volunteers, Zheng Chia, founder of Zing Zheng Lifestyle and Food Photography! Zheng truly exemplifies our Startup Grind values: Help others, give first, and make friends. We hope you'll join us for this incredibly special Fireside Chat with an incredibly special friend so you can learn more about this entrepreneur's story.\n\nZheng grew up in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and moved to the States when she was 20 years old. Fun fact: Zheng can speak five different languages! (Three Chinese dialects, Malay and of course, English). She graduated with her Bachelor’s Degree in Broadcast Journalism from the University of Missouri-Columbia and even worked as a morning news reporter at a local TV station in Missouri. She has also worked in Public Relations in Malaysia and London.\n\nShe has been a photographer and a videographer for ten years now. While she's based in Charleston, South Carolina, she does travel for work and is especially fond of New York City. One of her more recent trips involved working with Red Bull Media House where she interviewed and filmed a pro surfer from Maui, HI.\n\nIn Zheng's free time, you will find her drooling over delicious food, scouring new restaurants, telling people about Scott’s Cheap Flights, and plotting her next adventure trip with her husband!\n\nBonus: We're raffling off a Curve for MacBook ($60 dollar value) from Twelve South during the event! You're entered in the raffle when you buy your ticket and you have to be present at the time of the drawing to claim your prize.\n\n***\n\nSpecial thanks to our friends and partners:\n\n- SIB Fixed Cost Reduction for hosting us, we couldn’t do it without them\n\n- Zing Zheng for capturing the moment\n\n- Slice Company for the pies\n\n- Frothy Beard Brewing for the brews\n\n- Tambu Wines for the vino\n\n- Twelve South for our raffle item\n\n#StartupGrindCHS"
