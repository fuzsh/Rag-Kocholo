        "text": "How will I know if I am improving?\n\nEvery 30 days you will be asked to complete cognitive Assessment, this will monitor your performance and show the improvements you have made in cognitive skill areas. Graphs visually show you your progress.\n\nAlong with monitoring your own skill improvements, you can also ask friends and family whether they have noticed any changes in you. Others often notice changes before you!\n\nWhat is the research/science behind the Zing Performance program?\n\nThe scientific research that helped form the Zing Performance program surrounds the study and development of the Cerebellum. The Cerebellum is the part of the brain responsible for the automation of fundamental skills. It helps develop skills from being consciously controlled by the thinking part of the brain (the Prefrontal Cortex), to being automated and controlled by the Cerebral Cortex - which is far more efficient.\n\nTo view the Introduction to Science document please click on the following link; https://portal.zingperformance.com/docs/science/The-Science-Explained.pdf\n\nMy child is under 7, can they use the program?\n\nFor children under 7 the cerebellum still has more developing of its own natural accord to do. In the meantime, our suggestion for children under 7 is to have some fun by way of controlled physical movement such as swimming and jumping on a trampoline. Any coordinative exercise will help with the development of the neural pathways in their brain.\n\nHow much does the Zing Performance Program cost?\n\nThe cost of the Zing Performance Program is $497 for an initial 90 day bootcamp. After that the cost is $37.97 per month, this will be billed automatically each month unless cancelled. You can cancel at any time by contacting support@zingperformance.com"
