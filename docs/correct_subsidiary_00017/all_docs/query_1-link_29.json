        "text": "Dell is unmatched as a high-volume supplier, but its business model doesn't work as well when it can only achieve low sales volumes. It therefore waited until portable MP3 players had become a substantial market before launching its own system in 2003, then dropped out in 2006, when it failed to get more than 3% or so of the US market.\n\nIt could soon be back. A report in The Wall Street Journal says:\n\nDell has been testing a digital music player that could go on sale as early as September, said several Dell officials. Launching the player -- along with an online download service and related software -- would be part of a strategy that Dell Chief Executive Michael Dell hopes will move the company into a broader range of consumer markets than it has served before.\n\nThis time, it looks as though its approach will be based on Zing, a music site it bought last year. And it will go beyond music players, according to Michael Tatelman, Dell's vice president of consumer sales.\n\nZing, he said, will be used as a basis for an entire line of new consumer PCs and other products. That lineup, Mr Tatelman said, will give customers access to whatever source of music or movie content they want, \"rather than being dictated by a device and a single service.\"\n\nThe hope among Dell executives is that by integrating their PCs with entertainment software -- and streamlining the external design of their computers -- they will attract the type of consumer who would typically buy an Apple computer, but might be put off by restrictions that often apply to sharing music purchased from Apple [via] the iTunes store.\n\nWhether Dell can make it work is another matter, but it's not betting the farm on a new strategy. However, it's conclusive proof of the death of the \"Dell religion,\" which could be summarized as \"selling standard boxes directly to consumers at the lowest practicable price\".\n\nDell no longer focuses on the lowest price: it has \"value\" lines such as Vostro, consumer lines such as the Studio range, a high end performance line (XPS), and lots of business lines. It sells direct and via retail stores, and has a big services business that does things like manage fleets of corporate PCs. And while most of its sales are based on openly available market standards -- they are platform sales -- Zing shows it adding an experience-based integrated approach.\n\nAnd, of course, there's nothing odd about this. Dell is a $60+ billion business. Like Ford, it's diversifying.\n\nWhat we have yet to see is whether -- or how quickly -- Dell can change its image from the one that underpins the old Dell religion to reflect the new reality.\n\nIn passing, it would be interesting to know if Dell had looked at basing its new MP3 offering on Microsoft's Zune. The two companies are, after all, major partners. And the Zune is basically a good player: it has a better user interface than the classic iPod, better sound quality, and sociability features. Unfortunately, if you wanted to pick a company to turn big boxy Zunes into something sexy, you wouldn't pick Dell, and for the same reasons, Dell probably wouldn't pick Zune."
