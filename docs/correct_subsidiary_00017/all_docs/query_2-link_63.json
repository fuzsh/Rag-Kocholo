        "text": "Dear Zing,\n\nYour app is really good, but there is still room for improvement. First of all, you should add a feature where you could change the pitch of your voice to make it sound like Stikbot, instead of having to download a separate software on pc. Second, you should make it so that the app could make your hand invisible. I have seen this other app with this feature, and I think Zing has the potential to add this feature too. I really hope you take this advice to make your app better.\n\nI love this game but once it updated I didnât know how to use it but another part of it is I havenât used it Since December 2017. Anyways and itâs so glitchy and my movies are not smooth I donât know if thatâs me or the app either way I donât like it. Itâs pretty funny and cool to make your own movie but once you get the hang of it you realize that its kind of a pane in some ways. Now a hate the game because it needs Major bug fixes because I made a movie and I a accidentally put a noise on the wrong part of the movie and I went to go delete it and it loaded forever how long does it have to load so I can press deleteð¤¬. And then it loaded so long it kicked me out of the app so I clears the app re-entered the app so I could play the video and it loaded pretty fast the annoying loading circle went away I kicked me out of the app again ð¤¬I thought it was my phone so I reseted my phone went in the app repeated the things I did last time and it kicked me out a ð¯ timesð¤¬ and so I turned off my phone and it the same freakin thing again and it kicked me out a canât even save the movie because if I try it kicks me outð¤¯ð¤¬ so itâs the app ð¤¬ð¤¬ð¤¬ð¤¬ð¤¬ð¤¬ð¤¬ð¤¬\n\nOk Zing fix this or so help me ð¤¯ I have the kit I got for Christmas and itâs just sitting there in my basement canât be used because the freaking app wonât work and I also checked if it need an update and it doesnât ð¤¬ð¤¬ð¤¬ð¤¯ð¤¯ð¤¬ð¤¬ð¤¯ð¤¯ð¤¬ð¤¬ð¤¯ð¤¯ð¤¬\n\nI love the Stikbot movies and short films, so I decided to get some toys. I made my first purchase today and went to download the app to make a movie, made a quick 2-second scene as a test. When I went to add audio and trim it, it DID trim the audio, but with less than good results. If I cut out the lip-smacking at the beginning as I am about to say the word, to clean up the audio, it takes stuff off from the end. I tried it vice-versa, thinking maybe the audio went right-to-left. It had almost the same effect. I tried using the negative space and it did, well, the same thing just slightly different. Itâs not backwards, itâs not one part of the audio, itâs either all or nothing. I will buy more toys in the near future as I love messing around with them, but I wonât plan on buying anything bigger than my current purchase until this bug is hopefully fixed. Thank you."
