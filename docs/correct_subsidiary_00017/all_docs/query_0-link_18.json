        "text": "Dell's foray into the mobile computing market has generated more boos than buzz as pundits criticized its new cellphone, Aero, and tablet computer, Streak.\n\nNow it appears the PC maker is revamping its mobile strategy by hiring fresh talent to develop software that will run on its Android-based gadgets. Dell uses Google's Android mobile software in a range of smartphones and mobile Internet devices.\n\nAn online job listing posted June 1 outlined the plan. In it, Dell said it was seeking a \"software engineer strategist\" with at least five years of experience to head a new \"mobile software applications and services team\". The team will \"lead the design and development of value-added software for all Android-based mobile products,\" said the listing. The software engineer strategist would be responsible for developing a \"custom Dell Android launcher experience across multiple mobile platforms,\" according to the posting.\n\nThe new team will be based at Dell's Sunnyvale, Calif. office, where a number of engineers from audio streaming software maker Zing Systems--which Dell acquired in 2007--work. Dell also has mobile engineering teams near Chicago and at its Round Rock, Tex. headquarters.\n\nDell spokesman Matt Parretta told Forbes the company has not made any announcements about new mobile divisions since Dell realigned its business groups in January to form what it calls its Communications Solutions Group. Parretta also noted that Dell already has a dedicated mobile software team. The recruiter who listed the job did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnalysts say Dell would benefit from beefing up its Android ranks. While several manufacturers have found success marrying Android to their hardware, the glut of Android-based phones hitting the market is making it increasingly difficult for handset makers to stand out.\n\n\"Adding a hire to focus on software differentiation is right on for Dell,\" says Avi Greengart, Research Director for Consumer Devices at Current Analysis. Handset makers working with open-source operating systems like Android only have three ways to customize phones, notes Greengart. They can invest in unusual hardware, develop innovative software or sell their products at a very low price. Since hardware can be copied quickly and pricing is largely controlled by mobile operators, software is the most reliable strategy to pursue, Greengart adds.\n\nAndroid's open-source status means manufacturers can mold it in several ways. They can dictate, for example, how social networks like Facebook and Twitter are integrated into their phones and form partnerships to bring content, such as music and video, to their handsets. \"The stock Android experience is improving with each version, but there are still entire areas where Google has left the user experience to individual handset vendors,\" says Greengart.\n\nSo far, Dell has kept much of its Android software work under wraps. When it exhibited its Aero phone at the CTIA trade show in March, it kept the handset powered off. The phone, which will be released on AT&T by the end of the month, will feature social networking apps built into the phonebook and synched to the calendar and quick photo uploads to websites, according to AT&T."
