How will I know if I am improving?

Every 30 days you will be asked to complete cognitive Assessment, this will monitor your performance and show the improvements you have made in cognitive skill areas. Graphs visually show you your progress.

Along with monitoring your own skill improvements, you can also ask friends and family whether they have noticed any changes in you. Others often notice changes before you!

What is the research/science behind the Zing Performance program?

The scientific research that helped form the Zing Performance program surrounds the study and development of the Cerebellum. The Cerebellum is the part of the brain responsible for the automation of fundamental skills. It helps develop skills from being consciously controlled by the thinking part of the brain (the Prefrontal Cortex), to being automated and controlled by the Cerebral Cortex - which is far more efficient.

My child is under 7, can they use the program?

For children under 7 the cerebellum still has more developing of its own natural accord to do. In the meantime, our suggestion for children under 7 is to have some fun by way of controlled physical movement such as swimming and jumping on a trampoline. Any coordinative exercise will help with the development of the neural pathways in their brain.
