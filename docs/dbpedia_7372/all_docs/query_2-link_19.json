        "text": "Preparing to Participate in a Zoom Video Conference\n\nImportant: Any recording of a court proceeding held by video or teleconference, including “screen-shots” or other visual copying of a hearing, is absolutely prohibited. Violation of these prohibitions may result in sanctions, including removal of court-issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the court.\n\nIf you will be a case participant (aka “panelist”) in a Zoom video conference with the court (i.e., an attorney, witness, case party, etc.), please follow the guidance below, as adequate preparation and testing of the system will help ensure a good experience for everyone involved. Case participants/panelists will receive login information directly from the court. Panelist login information is not public and must not be shared with anyone other than the appearing attorneys and other direct participants in the court proceeding.\n\nIf you will be an attendee of a Zoom video conference with the court (i.e., a member of the press or public, or other non-participating observer), please follow this guidance, although much of the guidance below will still be helpful. Login information for attendees will be available on PACER or on the presiding judge’s calendar. Attendees will be able to see and/or hear the court proceeding in the same manner as the participants, and will have a similar experience to sitting in the courtroom gallery. Please note that some proceedings may provide phone-only connectivity via Zoom or other means, and that hearings may be limited to a total of 100 panelists and attendees combined.\n\nFor security and enforcement of court standards, the court may disable some Zoom interactions (such as chat, screen share, whiteboard, Q&A, raise hand, react, etc.).\n\nThe court will not provide technical support for Zoom participants or attendees. Please contact the Zoom Help Center, your local IT support, or other online guidance.\n\nZoom Account and Software\n\nParticipants: If you do not already have a Zoom account, set one up at https://zoom.us. A paid Zoom account is not necessary for any interaction with the court. Attendees do not need a Zoom account, but it does make using the system easier.\n\nLog into https://zoom.us/profile and set your name, phone and email. Including a photo will help identify you when connecting. Attendees do not need a Zoom profile or to provide any identity information, but it does make using the system easier.\n\nInstall the latest Zoom Client for Meetings at https://zoom.us/download. Although Zoom can be used in a browser only, it is very limited. The full Zoom client is required for best functionality and best experience with the system.\n\nAlways keep your software up to date! The Zoom Client automatically update itself upon launching the software, but you can also update it manually.\n\nSettings\n\nZoom has a lot of settings, and as the system updates, certain aspects or features may change. Below are a few settings recommended by the court to improve your video conference.\n\nGeneral: Ask me to confirm when I leave a meeting: ON (Helps prevent unintended departures)\n\nVideo: Enable HD: OFF (Helps prevent poor video performance, and usually looks just as good as HD)\n\nVideo: Always display participant names on their video: ON\n\nVideo: Always show video preview dialog when joining a video meeting: ON (Final check before your video displays to others)\n\nLearning\n\nThe court will likely use only the audio and video functionality of Zoom. Other functions such as text chat, screen sharing, etc., will likely be disabled for your session, and you need only learn the basics of observing or participating in a Zoom Webinar by audio or video. Consult the following sources to learn how to select the correct audio and video source, how to mute/unmute your audio, and and how to Start/Stop your video:\n\nVideo: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/200521865-Video\n\nAudio: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/200319096-Audio\n\nLearn how to easy mute/unmute with Push to talk:\n\nhttps://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360000510003-Push-to-Talk\n\nHot Keys and Keyboard Shortcuts to start/stop video, mute, etc.:\n\nhttps://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205683899-Hot-Keys-and-Keyboard-Shortcuts-for-Zoom\n\nRecommendations\n\nMute your phone, and mute all sounds from all other applications (email notifications, chat messaging, etc.).\n\nAvoid using a mobile device if possible. Although tablets (iPads) and smartphones can be used, they are very limited, and the performance is inferior.\n\nAvoid using battery power only (laptops, etc.). Plug into a good power source while in a Zoom meeting.\n\nUnless you’ve confirmed the quality is sufficient, avoid using an open microphone and speakers, such as those that are built-into laptops or a webcams. Using a good quality headset (headphones with mic) will often help ensure you can be heard, and can hear others with maximum quality.\n\nAvoid noisy and echoing locations. Use of a headset will improve audio quality when this is unavoidable.\n\nAvoid distracting real or virtual backgrounds. Avoid poor camera positioning (if possible). Try to frame yourself so you take up most the screen, at eye level.\n\nAvoid using WiFi if possible. Connection via a hard-wire Ethernet cable will always be faster and more reliable than WiFi. If you must use WiFi, make sure you’re in close range.\n\nAvoid running any unnecessary applications besides Zoom, to conserve your computer’s processing power and networking.\n\nFor home networks, if possible, avoid sharing your internet service with others during the session.\n\nBefore Every Court Session using Zoom\n\nConnect your device to power.\n\nMake sure your internet connection is good:\n\nhttps://www.pcworld.com/article/2048594/how-to-test-your-home-internet-speed.html\n\nTest your video.\n\nTest your audio.\n\nTurn off all audio disruptions (phones, messaging alerts, email alerts, etc.)\n\nRun a quick test to connect with another Zoom user, or use the Zoom test:\n\nhttps://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115002262083-Joining-a-test-meeting\n\nIf you will be performing remote language interpretation for the court:\n\nSee Zoom’s video introduction on Simultaneous Interpretations for Meetings and Webinars.\n\nReview Zoom’s online information about the process.\n\nReview this video demo of the process for interpreters.\n\nPractice with colleagues or friends!\n\nPlease note that for some proceedings, consecutive interpreting will be required due to technical limitations between certain locations. For these, you will be brought into the Zoom as a regular participant, similar to an open party-line call."
