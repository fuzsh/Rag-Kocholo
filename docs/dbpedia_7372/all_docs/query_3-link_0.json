        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nOur Frequently Asked Questions are sorted based on the area of interest. If you do not find the answer you need, please contact your local District Clerk’s Office (contact numbers are available under “Court Info,” “Court Locations”).\n\nAppeals\n\nHow many days do I have to file an appeal?\n\nIn a civil case, the notice of appeal must be filed with the U.S. District Clerk’s Office within 30 days after the judgment is entered. When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal may be filed by any party within 60 days after the judgment is entered. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a).\n\nWhat is the filing fee for a notice of appeal?\n\nSee the Fee Schedule page regarding the notice of appeal filing fee.\n\nWhere do I pay the appeal fee?\n\nUpon filing a notice of appeal, you can either pay the appeal fee in person or mail it to the U.S. District Clerk’s Office. Checks are to be made payable to “Clerk, U.S. District Court.” The U.S. District Clerk’s Office receives the appellate fee for the Court of Appeals.\n\nHow long will it take for a decision on my appeal?\n\nThere is no set length of time for an appeal. As the case is being decided by the Court of Appeals, the U.S. District Clerk’s Office can make no prediction as to the length of time it will take. However, factors that may affect the length of time it takes the appeal may include the Court of Appeals caseload, complexity of the issues, etc.\n\nWhat do you send to the Court of Appeals, what makes up the record?\n\nThe original papers and exhibits on file or in the custody of the Clerk of Court (except for oversized exhibits or sensitive exhibits such as drugs, firearms, currency, etc.), the transcript of proceedings, if any, and a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the deputy clerk of the District Court shall constitute the record on appeal in all cases. See Fed. R. App. P. 10(a).\n\nWhat type of cases need a certificate of appealability?\n\nA certificate of appealability is needed to appeal the denial of a habeas corpus petition by a person in state custody under 28 U.S.C. Â§2254 or a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence by a person in federal custody under 28 U.S.C. Â§2255. See Fed. R. App. P. 22(b).\n\nWhen is the record ready to be sent to the Court of Appeals?\n\nIt is the responsibility of the deputy clerk of the District Court to complete the record on appeal and to transmit it to the Court of Appeals. Generally in civil and criminal cases when all transcripts that have been ordered are filed and the filing fee has been paid or an application for in forma pauperis is granted the record will be transmitted. Section 2254 and 2255 cases should also include the District Court’s order ruling on the motion for certificate of appealability. Once the volumes are bound and labeled, and the transcript volumes, depositions, and exhibit containers are labeled, the record is ready for transmission to the Court of Appeals. The original record must be transmitted to the Court of Appeals within 15 days after it is complete for purposes of appeal.\n\nWhen the record is at the Court of Appeals, should all subsequent filings be filed with the Court of Appeals?\n\nOnce the record is at the Court of Appeals, all further filings relating to the appeal should be sent to the Court of Appeals. However, transcript order forms should be filed in the District Court. If a pleading is filed in the District Court (and any subsequent ruling should one be necessary), it will be forwarded to the Court of Appeals as a supplement to the record.\n\nAppendices\n\nAppendix A, Information Required – Motion For Class Action Certification\n\nAppendix A\n\nInformation Required – Motion For Class Action Certification\n\nDownload .PDF Copy of Appendix A – Information Required – Motion For Class Action Certification\n\nA motion to certify a class must include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\nA brief statement of the case.\n\nA statement defining the class plaintiff seeks to have certified including its geographical and temporal scope.\n\nA description of plaintiff’s particular grievance and why that claim qualifies plaintiff as a member of the class as defined.\n\nWhether the plaintiff contends that the action may be maintained under Rule 23(b)(1), Rule 23(b)(2), or Rule 23(b)(3) and why.\n\nA statement respecting the four prerequisites of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a).

Â§ 372(c). The law authorizes complaints against United States circuit, district, bankruptcy, and magistrate judges who have “engaged in conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts” or who are “unable to discharge all the duties of office by reason of mental or physical disability.” The conduct to which the law is addressed does not include making wrong judicial decisions, for the law provides that a complaint may be dismissed if it is “directly related to the merits of a decision or procedural ruling.” The Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit has adopted Rules Governing Complaints of Judicial Misconduct or Disability. These rules apply to judges of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and to the district, bankruptcy, and magistrate judges of federal courts within the Fifth Circuit. The circuit includes the states of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\n\nThese rules may be obtained from, and written complaints filed at, the following office:\n\nClerk\n\nU. S.

Â§3165(e)(3)\n\nDownload .PDF Copy of Appendix K – Plan For Prompt Disposition Of Criminal Cases Pursuant To The Speedy Trial Act Of 1974–18 U.S.C. Â§3165(e)(3)\n\nSECTION II\n\nSTATEMENT OF TIME LIMITS ADOPTED BY THE COURT AND PROCEDURES FOR IMPLEMENTING THEM\n\nPursuant to the requirements of Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (18 U.S.C. Chapter 208), the Speedy Trial Act Amendments Act of 1979 (Pub. L. No. 96-43, 93 Stat. 327), and the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (18 U.S.C. Â§Â§5036, 5037), the Judges of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas have adopted the following time limits and procedures to minimize undue delay and to further the prompt disposition of criminal cases and certain juvenile proceedings:\n\nApplicability.\n\nOffenses. The time limits set forth herein are applicable to all criminal offenses triable in this Court,1 including cases triable by United States Magistrates, except for petty offenses as defined in 18 U.S.C. Â§1(3). Except as specifically provided, they are not applicable to proceedings under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act. [Â§3172]\n\nPersons. The time limits are applicable to persons accused who have not been indicted or informed against as well as those who have, and the word “defendant” includes such persons unless the context indicates otherwise.\n\nPriorities In Scheduling Criminal Cases.\n\nPreference shall be given to criminal proceedings as far as practicable as required by Rule 50(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial of defendants in custody solely because they are awaiting trial and of high-risk defendants as defined in Section E should be given preference over other criminal cases. [Â§3164(a)]\n\nTime Within Which An Indictment Or Information Must Be Filed.\n\nTime Limits. If an individual is arrested or served with a summons and the complaint charges an offense to be prosecuted in this district, any indictment or information subsequently filed in connection with such charge shall be filed within 30 days of arrest or service. [Â§3161(b)]\n\nGrand Jury Not In Session. If the defendant is charged with a felony to be prosecuted in this district, and no grand jury in the district has been in session during the 30Â­day period prescribed in subsection (1), such period shall be extended an additional 30 days. [Â§3161(b)]\n\nMeasurement Of Time Periods. If a person has not been arrested or served with a summons on a Federal charge, an arrest will be deemed to have been made at such time as the person (i) is held in custody solely for the purpose of responding to a Federal charge; (ii) is delivered to the custody of a Federal official in connection with a Federal charge; or (iii) appears before a judicial officer in connection with a Federal charge.\n\nRelated Procedures.\n\nAt the time of the earliest appearance before a judicial officer of a person who has been arrested for an offense not charged in an indictment or information, the judicial officer shall establish for the record the date on which the arrest took place.\n\nIn the absence of a showing to the contrary, a summons shall be considered to have been served on the date of service shown on the return thereof.\n\nTime Within Which Trial Must Commence.\n\nTime Limits. The trial of a defendant shall commence not later than 70 days after the last to occur of the following dates:\n\nThe date on which an indictment or information is filed in this district;\n\nThe date on which a sealed indictment or information is unsealed; or\n\nThe date of the defendant’s first appearance before a judicial officer of this district. [3161(c)(1)]\n\nRetrial: Trial After Reinstatement of an Indictment or Information. The retrial of a defendant shall commence within 70 days from the date the order occasioning the retrial becomes final, as shall the trial of a defendant upon an indictment or information dismissed by a trial court and reinstated following an appeal. If the retrial or trial follows an appeal or collateral attack, the court may extend the period if unavailability of witnesses or other factors resulting from passage of time make trial within 70 days impractical. The extended period shall not exceed 180 days. [Â§Â§3161(d)(2),(e)]\n\nWithdrawal of Plea. If a defendant enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to any or all charges in an indictment or information and is subsequently permitted to withdraw it, the time limit shall be determined for all counts as if the indictment or information were filed on the day the order permitting withdrawal of the plea became final. [Â§3161(i)]\n\nSuperseding Charges. If, after an indictment or information has been filed, a complaint, indictment, or information is filed which charges the defendant with the same offense or with an offense required to be joined with that offense, the time limit applicable to the subsequent charge will be determined as follows:\n\nIf the original indictment or information was dismissed on motion of the defendant before the filing of the subsequent charge, the time limit shall be determined without regard to the existence of the original charge. [Â§3161(d)(1)]\n\nIf the original indictment or information is pending at the time the subsequent charge is filed, the trial shall commence within the time limit for commencement of trial on the original indictment or information. [Â§3161(h)(6)]\n\nIf the original indictment or information was dismissed on motion of the United States Attorney before the filing of the subsequent charge, the trial shall commence within the time limit for commencement of trial on the original indictment or information, but the period during which the defendant was not under charges shall be excluded from the computations. Such period is the period between the dismissal of the original indictment or information and the date the time would have commenced to run on the subsequent charge had there been no previous charge.2 [Â§3161(h)(6)]\n\nIf the subsequent charge is contained in a complaint, the formal time limit within which an indictment or information must be obtained on the charge shall be determined without regard to the existence of the original indictment or information, but earlier action may in fact be required if the time limit for commencement of trial is to be satisfied.\n\nMeasurement of Time Periods. For the purposes of this section:\n\nIf a defendant signs a written consent to be tried before a magistrate and no indictment or information charging the offense has been filed, the time limit shall run from the date of such consent.\n\nIn the event of a transfer to this district under Rule 20 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the indictment or information shall be deemed filed in this district when the papers in the proceeding or certified copies thereof are received by the clerk.\n\nA trial in a jury case shall be deemed to commence at the beginning of voir dire.\n\nA trial in a nonjury case shall be deemed to commence on the day the case is called, provided that some step in the trial procedure immediately follows.\n\nRelated Procedures.\n\nAt the time of the defendant’s earliest appearance before a judicial officer of this district, the officer will take appropriate steps to assure that the defendant is represented by counsel and shall appoint counsel where appropriate under the Criminal Justice Act and Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nThe court shall have sole responsibility for setting cases for trial after consultation with counsel. At the time of arraignment or as soon thereafter as is practicable, each case will be set for trial on a day certain or listed for trial on a weekly or other short-term calendar. [Â§3161(a)]\n\nIndividual calendars shall be managed so that it will be reasonably anticipated that every criminal case set for trial will be reached during the week of original setting. A conflict in schedules of Assistant United States Attorneys or defense counsel will be ground for a continuance or delayed setting only if approved by the court and called to the court’s attention at the earliest practicable time.\n\nIn the event that a complaint, indictment, or information is filed against a defendant charged in a pending indictment or information or in an indictment or information dismissed on motion of the United States Attorney, the trial on the new charge shall commence within the time limit for commencement of trial on the original indictment or information unless the court finds that the new charge is not for the same offense charged in the original indictment or information or an offense required to be joined therewith.\n\nAt the time of the filing of a complaint, indictment, or information described in paragraph (d), the United States Attorney shall give written notice to the court of that circumstance and of his position with respect to the computation of the time limits.\n\nAll pretrial hearings shall be conducted as soon after the arraignment as possible, consistent with the priorities of other matters on the court’s criminal docket.\n\nDefendants in Custody and High-Risk Defendants.3\n\nTime Limits. Notwithstanding any longer time periods that may be permitted under sections C and D, the following time limits will also be applicable to defendants in custody and high-risk defendants as herein defined:\n\nThe trial of a defendant held in custody solely for the purpose of trial on a Federal charge shall commence within 90 days following the beginning of continuous custody.\n\nThe trial of a high-risk defendant shall commence within 90 days of the designation as high-risk. [Â§3164(b)]\n\nDefinition of “High-Risk Defendant.” A high-risk defendant is one reasonably designated by the United States Attorney as posing a danger to himself or any other person or to the community.\n\nMeasurement of Time Periods. For the purposes of this section:\n\nA defendant is deemed to be in detention awaiting trial when he is arrested on a Federal charge or otherwise held for the purpose of responding to a Federal charge. Detention is deemed to be solely because the defendant is awaiting trial unless the person exercising custodial authority has an independent basis (not including a detainer) for continuing to hold the defendant.\n\nIf a case is transferred pursuant to Rule 20 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the defendant subsequently rejects disposition under Rule 20 or the court declines to accept the plea, a new period of continuous detention awaiting trial will begin at that time.\n\nA trial shall be deemed to commence as provided in section D(5)(c) and D(5)(d).\n\nRelated Procedures.\n\nIf a defendant is being held in custody solely for the purpose of awaiting trial, the United States Attorney shall advise the court at the earliest practicable time of the date of the beginning of such custody.\n\nThe United States Attorney shall advise the court at the earliest practicable time (usually at the hearing with respect to bail) if the defendant is considered by him to be high risk.\n\nIf the court finds that the filing of a “high-risk” designation as a public record may result in prejudice to the defendant, it may order the designation sealed for such period as is necessary to protect the defendant’s right to a fair trial, but not beyond the time that the court’s judgment in the case become final. During the time the designation is under seal, it shall be made known to the defendant and his counsel but shall not be made known to other persons without the permission of the court.\n\nExclusion of Time From Computations.\n\nApplicability. In computing any time limit under section C (Interval I), D (Interval II), or E (Custody/High-Risk), the periods of delay set forth in 18 U.S.C. Â§3161(h) shall be excluded. Such periods of delay shall not be excluded in computing the minimum period for commencement of trial under section G.\n\nRecords of Excludable Time. The clerk of the court shall enter on the docket, in the form prescribed by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, information with respect to excludable periods of time for each criminal defendant.\n\nStipulations.\n\nThe attorney for the government and the attorney for the defendant may at any time enter into stipulations with respect to the accuracy of the docket entries recording excludable time.\n\nTo the extent that the amount of time stipulated by the parties does not exceed the amount recorded on the docket for any excludable period of delay, the stipulation shall be conclusive as between the parties unless it has no basis in fact or law. It shall similarly be conclusive as to a codefendant for the limited purpose of determining, under 18 U.S.C. Â§3161(h)(7), whether time has run against the defendant entering into the stipulation.\n\nTo the extent that the amount of time stipulated exceeds the amount recorded on the docket, the stipulation shall have no effect unless approved by the court.\n\nPre-Indictment Procedures.\n\nIn the event that the United States Attorney anticipates that an indictment or information will not be filed within the time limit set forth in section C (Interval I), he may file a written motion with the court for a determination of excludable time. In the event that the United States Attorney seeks a continuance under 18 U.S.C. Â§3161(h)(8), he shall file a written motion with the court requesting such a continuance.\n\nThe motion of the United States Attorney shall state (i) the period of time proposed for exclusion, and (ii) the basis of the proposed exclusion. If the motion is for a continuance under 18 U.S.C. Â§3161(h)(8), it shall also state whether or not the defendant is being held in custody on the basis of the complaint. In appropriate circumstances, the motion may include a request that some or all of the supporting material be considered ex parte and in camera.\n\nThe court may grant a continuance under 18 U.S.C. Â§3161(h)(8) for either a specific period of time or a period to be determined by reference to an event (such as recovery from illness) not within the control of the government. If the continuance is to a date not certain, the court shall require one or both parties to inform the court promptly when and if the circumstances that justify the continuance no longer exist. In addition, the court shall require one or both parties to file periodic reports bearing on the continued existence of such circumstances. The court shall determine the frequency of such reports in the light of the facts of the particular case.\n\nPost-Indictment Procedures.\n\nAt each appearance of counsel before the court, counsel shall examine the clerk’s records of excludable time for completeness and accuracy and shall bring to the court’s immediate attention any claim that the clerk’s record is in any way incorrect.\n\nIn the event that the court continues a trial beyond the time limit set forth in section D or E, the court shall determine whether the limit may be recomputed by excluding time pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§3161(h).\n\nIf it is determined that a continuance is justified, the court shall set forth its findings in the record, either orally or in writing. If the continuance is granted under 18 U.S.C. Â§3161(h)(8), the court shall also set forth its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by granting the continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial. If the continuance is to a date not certain, the court shall require one or both parties to inform the court promptly when and if the circumstances that justify the continuance no longer exist. In addition, the court shall require one or both parties to file periodic reports bearing on the continued existence of such circumstances. The court shall determine the frequency of such reports in the light of the facts of the particular case.\n\nMinimum Period for Defense Preparation.\n\nUnless the defendant consents in writing to the contrary, the trial shall not commence earlier than 30 days from (i) the date on which the indictment or information is filed or (ii), if later, from the date on which counsel first enters an appearance, or (iii) the date on which the defendant expressly waives counsel and elects to proceed pro se. In circumstances in which the 70-day time limit for commencing trial on a charge in an indictment or information is determined by reference to an earlier indictment or information pursuant to section D(4), the 30-day minimum period shall also be determined by reference to the earlier indictment or information. When prosecution is resumed on an original indictment or information following a mistrial, appeal, or withdrawal of a guilty plea, a new 30-day minimum period will not begin to run. The court will in all cases schedule trials so as to permit defense counsel adequate preparation time in the light of all the circumstances. [Â§3161(c)(2)].\n\nTime Within Which Defendant Should be Sentenced.\n\nTime Limit. A defendant shall ordinarily be sentenced within (45) days of the date of his conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere.\n\nRelated Procedures. If the defendant and his counsel consent thereto, a presentence investigation may be commenced prior to a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or a conviction.\n\nJuvenile Proceedings.\n\nTime Within Which Trial Must Commence. An alleged delinquent who is in detention pending trial shall be brought to trial within 30 days of the date on which such detention was begun, as provided in 18 U.S.C. Â§5036.\n\nTime of Dispositional Hearing. If a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent, a separate dispositional hearing shall be held no later than 20 court days after trial, unless the court has ordered further study of the juvenile in accordance with 18 U.S.C. Â§ 5037(c).\n\nSanctions.\n\nDismissal or Release from Custody. Failure to comply with the requirements of Title I of the Speedy Trial Act may entitle the defendant to dismissal of the charges against him or to release from pretrial custody. Nothing in this plan shall be construed to require that a case be dismissed or a defendant released from custody in circumstances in which such action would not be required by 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 3162 and 3164.4\n\nHigh-Risk Defendant. A high-risk defendant whose trial has not commenced within the time limit set forth in 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3164(b) shall, if the failure to commence trial was through no fault of the attorney for the government, have his release conditions automatically reviewed. A high-risk defendant who is found by the court to have intentionally delayed the trial of his case shall be subject to an order of the court modifying his nonfinancial conditions of release under Chapter 207 of Title 18, U.S.C., to ensure that he shall appear at trial as required. [Â§3164(c)]\n\nDiscipline of Attorneys. In a case in which counsel (a) knowingly allows the case to be set for trial without disclosing the fact that a necessary witness would be unavailable for trial, (b) files a motion solely for the purpose of delay which he knows is frivolous and without merit, (c) makes a statement for the purpose of obtaining a continuance which he knows to be false and which is material to the granting of the continuance, or (d) otherwise willfully fails to proceed to trial without justification consistent with 18 U.S.C. Â§3161, the court may punish such counsel as provided in 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 3162(b) and (c).\n\nAlleged Juvenile Delinquents. An alleged delinquent in custody whose trial has not commenced within the time limit set forth in 18 U.S.C. Â§ 5036 shall be entitled to dismissal of his case pursuant to that section unless the Attorney General shows that the delay was consented to or caused by the juvenile or his counsel, or would be in the interest of justice in the particular case.\n\nPersons Serving Terms of Imprisonment.\n\nIf the United States Attorney knows that a person charged with an offense is serving a term of imprisonment in any penal institution, he shall promptly seek to obtain the presence of the prisoner for trial, or cause a detainer to be filed, in accordance with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. Â§3161(j).\n\nEffective Dates.\n\nThe amendments to the Speedy Trial Act made by Public Law 96-43 became effective August 2, 1979. To the extent that this revision of the district’s plan does more than merely reflect the amendments, the revised plan shall take effect upon approval of the reviewing panel designated in accordance with 18 U.S.C. Â§3165(c). However, the dismissal sanction and the sanctions against attorneys authorized by 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3162 and reflected in sanctions J(1) and (2) of this plan shall apply only to defendants whose cases are commenced by arrest or summons on or after July, 1980, and to indictments and information filed on or after that date.\n\nIf a defendant was arrested or served with a summons before July 1, 1979, the time within which an information or indictment must be filed shall be determined under the plan that was in effect at the time of such arrest or service.\n\nIf a defendant was arraigned before August 2, 1979, the time within which the trial must commence shall be determined under the plan that was in effect at the time of such arraignment.\n\nIf a defendant was in custody on August 2, 1979, solely because he was awaiting trial, the 90-day period under section E shall be computed from that date.\n\nReferences:\n\n1 118 U.S.C. Â§3172 defines offenses as “any Federal criminal offense which is in violation of any Act of Congress…”\n\n2 Under the rule of this paragraph, if an indictment was 2 dismissed on motion of the prosecutor on May 1, with 20 days remaining within which trial must be commenced, and the defendant was arrested on a new complaint on June 1, the time remaining for trial would be 20 days from June 1: the time limit would be based on the original indictment, but the period from the dismissal to the new arrest would not count. Although the 30-day arrest-to-indictment time limit would apply to the new arrest as a formal matter, the short deadline for trial would necessitate earlier grand jury action.\n\n3 If a defendant’s presence has been obtained through the filing of a detainer with state authorities, the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, 18 U.S.C., Appendix, may require that trial commence before the deadline established by the Speedy Trial Act. See U.S. v. Mauro, 436 U.S. 340), 356-57 n.24 (1978)\n\n4 Dismissal may also be required in some cases under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, 18 U.S.C., Appendix.\n\nAppendix L, Local Court Rules of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas\n\nAppendix L, Local Court Rules of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas\n\nDownload .PDF Copy of Appendix L – Local Court Rules of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas\n\nLocal Court Rules of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas\n\n(Available by contacting the U.

In each division of this court there is constituted a committee on admissions, which reviews applications for admission to the bar of this court and makes appropriate recommendations to the court.\n\nComposition. Each committee on admissions has five or more members, including a chair. To the extent possible, the committee should include civil, criminal, and bankruptcy practitioners. Those eligible for service on the committee are attorneys licensed to practice in this district and in good standing, and maintaining a law office in the division served. The members and chair are appointed by the judges resident in, or responsible for, the division.\n\nTerms. Membership terms should be staggered so that approximately one third of the members’ terms expire each year. The term is 3 years, unless a shorter period is required to achieve staggered terms. The terms of members and the chair may be renewed one or more times.\n\nQuorum. A quorum of a committee consists of three members, participating either in person or by electronic means.\n\nAction on Applications.\n\nClerk’s Duties. The clerk will inspect applications for completeness, and may request the applicant to provide supplemental or explanatory information. The clerk will forward completed applications to the committee chair.\n\nExamination by the Committee. The committee will meet with reasonable frequency to examine applications referred to it. The committee may request the applicant to provide supplemental or explanatory information, and may request that the applicant appear before it. If the committee determines that an applicant meets all requirements for admission, it will report that recommendation to the judge or judges of the division. If the committee does not recommend an applicant for admission, the chair of the Divisional Committee will promptly inform the applicant.\n\nReview by the Court. An applicant who is not recommended for admission may request that the court review the application. A request for review must be made in writing within 30 days of receipt of the committee’s notification, addressed to the judge or judges of the division, with a copy to the committee chair. Upon receipt of a request for court review, the chair will send the committee’s file on the applicant to the court.\n\nProcedure for Admission.\n\nIn General. After approval by the committee, and upon motion of a member of the bar of this court made in open court, an attorney may be admitted to practice. To complete admission, the attorney must pay the prescribed admission fee, and must take in open court the following oath or affirmation:\n\n“I do solemnly [swear or affirm] that I will discharge the duties of attorney and counselor of this court faithfully, that I will demean myself uprightly under the law and the highest ethics of our profession, and that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States.”\n\nSpecial Procedure for Non-Resident Attorney. A non-resident attorney who has completed all other requirements for admission may, with the approval of a judge of the division where the application was filed, have the oath or affirmation of admission administered by a judge in another federal judicial district. When the attorney files the oath or affirmation with the clerk and pays the prescribed admission fee, the attorney will be admitted to practice in this district.\n\nAppearance Pro Hac Vice.\n\nIn General. An attorney who is licensed by the highest court of a state or another federal district court, but who is not admitted to practice before this court, may represent a party in this court pro hac vice only by permission of the judge presiding. Unless excused by the judge presiding, an attorney is ordinarily required to apply for admission to the bar of this court.\n\nProcedure. An attorney seeking admission pro hac vice must make application on a form prescribed by the court, and must pay the prescribed fee to the clerk. An attorney admitted pro hac vice must read and comply with the Local Court Rules for the Western District of Texas. By appearing in any case, an attorney becomes subject to the rules of this court.\n\nBankruptcy Court. Admission to practice pro hac vice before the districtâs bankruptcy court rests in the sole discretion of the bankruptcy judge to whom the motion is addressed. Such admission is limited to the particular case or matter for which it is approved; it is not a general admission to practice before the bankruptcy court or the district court.\n\nSpecial Procedures for an Attorney Employed by a Governmental Entity. An application for admission by an attorney employed by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Attorney General of Texas, the Federal Public Defender for the district, or other governmental entity must be made on the form prescribed by the court, and supported with the required certificate of good standing. In lieu of submitting two letters of recommendation, an attorney covered by this subdivision need only submit a letter of recommendation from his or her supervising attorney. In addition, such an attorney is exempt while so employed from payment of any fee for admission, pro hac vice appearance, or membership renewal.\n\nRenewal of Membership. A member of the bar of this court must renew the membership every 3 years after admission by paying the prescribed renewal fee to the clerk. If the renewal fee is not timely paid, the attorney will be removed from the rolls of the court. An attorney so removed who wishes to practice in this court must reapply for admission.\n\nRule AT-2. Local Counsel\n\nRule AT-2. Local Counsel\n\nDownload .PDF Copy of Rule AT-2.

Local counsel must have authority to act as attorney of record for all purposes, and must be prepared to present and argue the party’s position at any hearing or status conference called.\n\nRule AT-3. Withdrawal Of Attorney\n\nRule AT-3. Withdrawal Of Attorney\n\nDownload .PDF Copy of Rule AT-3. Withdrawal Of Attorney\n\nAn attorney seeking to withdraw from a case must file a motion specifying the reasons for withdrawal and providing the name and office address of the successor attorney. If the successor attorney is not known, the motion must set forth the client’s name, address, and telephone number, and must bear either the client’s signature or a detailed explanation why the client’s signature could not be obtained after due diligence.\n\nRule AT-4. Standards For Pretrial Conduct\n\nRule AT-4. Standards For Pretrial Conduct\n\nDownload .PDF Copy of Rule AT-4. Standards For Pretrial Conduct\n\nObligation to Cooperate. Before noticing or scheduling a deposition, hearing, or other pretrial event, a lawyer should consult and work with opposing counsel to accommodate the needs and reasonable requests of all witnesses and participating lawyers. In scheduling a pretrial event, lawyers should strive to agree upon a mutually convenient time and place, seeking to minimize travel expense and to allow adequate time for preparation. If a lawyer needs to reschedule a deposition or other pretrial event, the lawyer should give prompt notice to all other counsel, explaining the conflict or other compelling reason for rescheduling.\n\nRequests for Extensions of Time. The court expects a lawyer to grant other lawyers’ requests for reasonable extensions of time to respond to discovery, pretrial motions, and other pretrial matters. Opposing such requests wastes resources, unless the client’s legitimate interests will be adversely affected.\n\nWritten Submissions. Briefs and memoranda should not refer to or rely on facts that are not properly of record. A lawyer may, however, present historical, economic, or sociological data if the applicable rules of evidence support the data’s admissibility. Neither written submissions nor oral presentations should disparage the integrity, intelligence, morals, ethics, or personal behavior of an adversary unless such matters are directly relevant under the controlling substantive law.\n\nCommunication with Adversaries. A lawyer’s role is to zealously advance the legitimate interests of the client, while maintaining appropriate standards of civility and decorum. In dealing with others, a lawyer should not reflect any ill feelings that the client may have toward the adversary. A lawyer should treat all other lawyers, all parties, and all witnesses courteously, not only in court, but also in other written and oral communication. A lawyer should refrain from acting upon or manifesting bias or prejudice toward any person involved in the litigation.\n\nDiscovery. A lawyer should conduct discovery to elicit relevant facts and evidence, and not for an improper purpose, such as to harass, intimidate, or unduly burden another party or a witness. When a discovery dispute arises, opposing lawyers should attempt to resolve it by working cooperatively together. A lawyer should refrain from filing motions to compel or for sanctions unless all reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute with opposing counsel have been exhausted.\n\nMotion Practice. Before filing a non-dispositive motion, a lawyer should make a reasonable effort to resolve the issue without involving the court. A lawyer who has no valid objection to an opponent’s proposed motion should promptly make this position known to opposing counsel. If, after opposing a motion, a lawyer determines that the opposition was mistaken, then the lawyer should promptly so advise opposing counsel and the court.\n\nSettlement and Alternative Dispute Resolution.\n\nA lawyer should educate the client early in the legal process about various methods of resolving disputes without trial, including mediation and neutral case evaluation. A lawyer should advise the client of the benefits of settlement, including savings to the client, greater control over the process and the result, and a more expeditious resolution of the dispute. At the earliest practicable time, a lawyer should provide the client with a realistic assessment of the potential outcome of the case so that the client may effectively assess various approaches to resolving the dispute. As new information is obtained during the pretrial phase, the lawyer should revise the assessment as necessary. When enough is known about the case to make settlement negotiations meaningful, a lawyer should explore settlement with the client and with opposing counsel.\n\nA lawyer must promptly inform the court of any settlement, whether partial or entire, with any party, or the discontinuance of any issue.\n\nStipulations; Expediting Trial. In civil cases, a lawyer should stipulate in advance with opposing counsel to all non-controverted facts; give opposing counsel, on reasonable request, an opportunity to inspect, in advance, all non-impeaching evidence as the law permits; and, in general, take reasonable steps to avoid delays and to expedite the trial.\n\nRule AT-5. Standards For Conduct Before The Judge And Jury\n\nRule AT-5. Standards For Conduct Before The Judge And Jury\n\nDownload .PDF Copy of Rule AT-5. Standards For Conduct Before The Judge And Jury\n\nThe dignity, decorum and courtesy that traditionally characterize the courts of civilized nations are not empty formalities. They are essential to a courtroom atmosphere in which justice can be achieved. Accordingly, this court requires the following:\n\nA lawyer must be punctual in making all court appearances and fulfilling all professional commitments. In case of tardiness or absence from a court appearance, a lawyer should promptly notify the court and opposing counsel.\n\nAn attorney must be attired in a proper and dignified manner, and should abstain from any apparel or ornament calculated to attract attention. A lawyer should refrain from assuming an undignified posture.\n\nA lawyer must display a courteous, dignified and respectful attitude toward the judge presiding, not for the sake of the judge’s person, but to show respect for and confidence in the judicial office. A lawyer must rise when addressing, or being addressed by, the judge.\n\nA lawyer must never be unfair or abusive or inconsiderate to adverse witnesses or opposing litigants, or ask any question not intended to legitimately impeach but only to insult or degrade the witness.\n\nA 1awyer must avoid disparaging personal remarks or acrimony toward opposing counsel.\n\nA lawyer must advise the client, witnesses, and spectators of the behavior and decorum required in the courtroom, and take all reasonable steps to prevent disorder or disruption of court proceedings.\n\nA lawyer must disclose to the judge and opposing counsel any information of which the lawyer is aware that a juror or a prospective juror has or may have any interest, direct or indirect, in the outcome of the case, or is acquainted or connected in any manner with any lawyer in the case or any partner or associate or employee of the lawyer, or with any litigant, or with any person who has appeared or is expected to appear as a witness, unless the judge and opposing counsel have previously been made aware of that fact by voir dire examination or otherwise.\n\nDuring the trial of a case a lawyer connected with the case must not communicate with or cause another to communicate with any member of the jury, and a lawyer who is not connected with the case must not communicate with or cause another to communicate with a juror concerning the case.\n\nA lawyer should avoid, as much as possible, approaching the bench. A lawyer should anticipate questions that may arise during the trial, and take them up with the court and opposing counsel in a pretrial hearing. If, however, it becomes necessary for an attorney to confer with the court at the bench, leave of court should be requested.\n\nA lawyer must question witnesses and deliver jury arguments from the lectern, which may be moved to face the jury. If it becomes necessary to question or argue from another location, leave of court should be requested.\n\nA lawyer must hand all papers intended for the court to see to the courtroom deputy clerk, who will pass them up to the judge. Hand to the clerk, rather than the court reporter, any exhibits to be marked which have not previously been identified; and give the clerk, as soon as convenient before the trial, a list of witnesses showing the probable order in which they will be called.\n\nPhotographing, broadcasting or televising any judicial proceeding or any person directly or indirectly involved in a proceeding, whether court is in session or not, in or from any part of a United States Courthouse, is prohibited, except with the permission of the judge presiding.\n\nAudio recorders, audio- or video-recording cell phones, or other means of recording the proceedings must not be brought into a courtroom, except with the permission of the judge presiding. This rule does not apply to such recorders or other devices used by, and under the direction and control of, a judicial officer or the official court reporter.\n\nCell phones, pagers, e-mail devices, and music players must be turned off while inside a courtroom.\n\nThe following are prohibited in a courtroom:\n\nusing tobacco in any form;\n\nconsuming or possessing beverages or edibles (except as permitted by the judge presiding);\n\nchewing gum while court is in session;\n\nunnecessary talking or other unnecessary noises while court is in session.\n\nRule AT-6. Publicity And Trial Management\n\nRule AT-6. Publicity And Trial Management\n\nDownload .PDF Copy of Rule AT-6. Publicity And Trial Management\n\nIn General. A lawyer should try a case in court and not in the news media. A lawyer must not make an extrajudicial statement that a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the statement has a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding.\n\nCriminal Investigation. With respect to a grand jury or other pending investigation of a criminal matter, a lawyer participating in the investigation must refrain from making any extrajudicial statement, for dissemination by any means of public communication, that goes beyond the public record or that is not necessary to inform the public that the investigation is underway, to describe the general scope of the investigation, to warn the public of any dangers, to obtain assistance in the apprehension of a suspect, or to otherwise aid in the investigation.\n\nCriminal Prosecution. From time of arrest, issuance of an arrest warrant, or filing of a complaint, information, or indictment in any criminal matter until the commencement of trial or disposition without trial, a lawyer associated with the prosecution or defense must not release or authorize the release of any extrajudicial statement, for dissemination by any means of public communication, related to that matter and concerning:\n\nthe prior criminal record (including arrests and criminal charges), or the character or reputation of the accused, except that the lawyer may make a factual statement of the accused’s name, age, residence, occupation, and family status, and if the accused has not been apprehended, a lawyer associated with the prosecution may release any information necessary to aid in his apprehension or to warn the public of dangers he may present;\n\nthe existence or contents of any confession, admission, or statement given by the accused, or the refusal or failure of the accused to make any statement;\n\nthe performance of any examinations or tests or the accused’s refusal or failure to submit to an examination or test;\n\nthe identity, testimony, or credibility of prospective witnesses, except that the lawyer may announce the identity of the victim if the announcement is not otherwise prohibited by law;\n\nthe possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense; or\n\nany opinion as to the accused’s guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or the evidence in the case.\n\nCriminal Trial. During the trial of any criminal matter, including jury selection, a lawyer associated with the prosecution or defense must not give or authorize any extrajudicial statement or interview, relating to the trial or the parties or issues in the trial, for dissemination by any means of public communication, except that the lawyer may quote from or refer without comment to public records filed in the case.\n\nSentencing Phase. After guilt is found in a criminal case and before sentence is imposed, a lawyer associated with the prosecution or defense must not make or authorize any extrajudicial statement for dissemination by any means of public communication if there is a reasonable likelihood that the statement will affect the sentence.\n\nPermitted Statements in Criminal Matters. This rule does not preclude the lawyer, in the proper discharge of his or her official or professional duty, from:\n\nannouncing the fact and circumstances of arrest (including time and place of arrest, resistance, pursuit, and use of weapons), the identity of the investigating and arresting officer or agency, and the length of the investigation;\n\nmaking an announcement, at the time of seizure of any physical evidence other than a confession, admission or statement, limited to a description of the evidence seized;\n\ndisclosing the nature, substance, or text of the charge, including a brief description of the offense charged;\n\nquoting or referring without comment to public records of the court in the case;\n\nannouncing the scheduling or result of any stage in the judicial process;\n\nrequesting assistance in obtaining evidence; or\n\nannouncing without elaboration that the accused denies the charges made against him.\n\nSpecial Orders. In a widely publicized or sensational case, the court on motion of either party or its own motion, may issue a special order governing extrajudicial statements by participants likely to interfere with the rights of the accused to a fair trial by an impartial jury, the courtroom seating and conduct of spectators and news media representatives, the management and sequestration of jurors and witnesses, and any other matters the court may deem appropriate. The order might address some or all of the following subjects, among others:\n\na proscription of extrajudicial statements by participants in the trial, including lawyers, parties, witnesses, jurors, and court officials, which have a substantial likelihood of divulging prejudicial matter not of public record in the case;\n\nspecific directives regarding the clearing of courthouse entrances and hallways and the management of the jury and witnesses during the course of the trial to avoid their mingling with or being in proximity of reporters, photographers, parties, lawyers, and others, both in entering and leaving the courtroom and courthouse, and during recesses in the trial;\n\na specific directive that the jurors refrain from reading, listening to, or watching news reports concerning the case, and that they similarly refrain from discussing the case with anyone during the trial and from communicating with others in any manner during their deliberations;\n\nsequestration of the jury on motion of either party or on the court’s own, without disclosing any movant’s identity;\n\na directive that the names and addresses of jurors or prospective jurors not be publicly released except as required by statute, and that no photograph be taken or sketch made of any juror within the environs of the court;\n\ninsulation of witnesses from news interviews during the trial period;\n\nspecific directives regarding the seating of spectators and representatives of the news media.\n\nRule AT-7.

X, sec. 9 (Vernon) which are hereby adopted as the standards of professional conduct of this court. This specification is not exhaustive of the standards of professional conduct. For matters not covered by the Texas rules, the American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct should be consulted.\n\nDistrict Disciplinary Committee. There is constituted a District Disciplinary Committee, which assists the district court and the bankruptcy court in investigating complaints about the qualification, conduct, and performance of members of their bar.\n\nComposition. The committee has 15 members. Those eligible for service on the committee are attorneys licensed to practice in this district and in good standing, and residing within the district. The committee should include civil, criminal, and bankruptcy practitioners. Five members must be residents of the Austin and Waco Divisions, five members must be residents of the San Antonio and Del Rio Divisions, and five members must be residents of the El Paso, Midland-Odessa and Pecos Divisions. The members are appointed by the active judges resident in, or responsible for, those divisions. The chair and vice-chair are designated by the chief judge of the district.\n\nTerms. Membership terms should be staggered so that one third of the members’ terms expire each year. The term is 3 years, unless a shorter period is required to achieve staggered terms. The terms of members and the chair may be renewed one or more times.\n\nGrounds for Referral to the District Disciplinary Committee. An attorney may be referred by any Magistrate Judge, Bankruptcy Judge or District Judge to the District Disciplinary Committee for appropriate review, investigation, and recommendation if there is reason to believe that the attorney:\n\nhas been convicted of a felony offense or a crime involving dishonesty or false statement in any state or federal court;\n\nhad his or her license to practice law in any jurisdiction suspended, revoked, or otherwise limited by any appropriate disciplinary authority;\n\nresigned his or her license to practice law in any state or any federal court;\n\nhas engaged in conduct that violates the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct;\n\nfails to comply with any rule or order issued by a judge of this court;\n\npresents an impediment to the orderly administration of justice or the integrity of the court; or\n\nrepresents a client in such a manner as to raise a serious question concerning the quality of the attorney’s professional performance.\n\nDiscipline Imposed by a Judge Presiding. Notwithstanding any other provision of these rules, any judge, including a bankruptcy judge or a magistrate judge, has inherent authority to discipline an attorney who appears before him or her. However, any judge contemplating disbarring an attorney or preventing an attorney from practicing district-wide will refer the attorney to the District Disciplinary Committee. If a judge believes emergency circumstances exist that require the immediate suspension of an attorney, that judge may request that all active district judges immediately consider the matter. Upon a majority vote of the active district judges, an attorney may immediately be suspended from practicing in the district pending a report and recommendation from the District Disciplinary Committee. If a bankruptcy judge believes emergency circumstances exist that requires the immediate suspension of an attorney, that bankruptcy judge may request that all active district and bankruptcy judges immediately consider the matter. Upon a majority vote of the active district and bankruptcy judges, an attorney may immediately be suspended from practicing in the district pending a report and recommendation from the District Disciplinary Committee.\n\nSelf-Reporting by Attorneys. A member of the bar of this court must promptly report in writing to the clerk, with full details and copies of pertinent documents, if any of the following occur:\n\nstatement; the attorney is convicted of a felony or a crime involving dishonesty or false statement;\n\nthe attorney loses or relinquishes, temporarily or permanently, the right to practice in any court of record (other than voluntarily relinquishment, not under any disciplinary order or threat of discipline); or\n\nthe attorney is disciplined, publicly or privately, by any bar, court, court agency, or court committee.\n\nProcedure upon a Referral.\n\nNotice. Promptly upon receipt of a referral, the chair of the District Disciplinary Committee must inform the subject attorney in writing of the nature of the referral and the attorney’s obligations under this rule.\n\nAnswer. Within 14 days after receiving notice of a referral under this rule, the attorney must respond in writing to the committee chair. The respondent attorney must admit or deny each claim asserted, and state concisely any defense to a claim.\n\nScreening. The chair will assign the referral along with the respondent’s response to a screening subcommittee. The subcommittee consists of one or more members of the full committee designated by the chair who reside in the same region as the referred attorney (e.g., Austin/Waco; San Antonio/Del Rio; West Texas). At least one member of the screening subcommittee must be an attorney who practices in the same area as the referred (Rev: 12/17/09) attorney (e.g., civil, criminal or bankruptcy). The subcommittee will conduct such preliminary inquiry it deems appropriate and may request the respondent to meet with it informally to provide an explanation. After this screening, if the subcommittee determines no further investigation is required and no discipline should be imposed, it will so inform the committee chair. The chair will then inform the chief judge and the respondent of the recommendation.\n\nAssignment to a Panel. If the screening subcommittee determines that the matter may warrant disciplinary action, it will inform the committee chair. The chair will then designate a panel and assign the matter to it. The panel must include three or more members of the full committee who reside in the same region as the respondent (e.g., Austin/Waco; San Antonio/Del Rio; West Texas). At least one member of the panel must be an attorney who practices in the same area as the referred attorney (e.g. civil, criminal or bankruptcy). Members of the initial screening subcommittee may serve as members of the panel. The chair will notify the respondent in writing of this assignment and what matters will be investigated.\n\nInvestigation. No earlier than 10 days after notice to the respondent of the assignment, the panel will conduct such investigation it deems appropriate including questioning witnesses and holding a hearing with the respondent present. Full cooperation with any committee investigation is an obligation of any member of the bar of this court.\n\nPanel Report and Recommendation. After investigation the panel will render a report and recommendation as to whether the respondent committed any violation and what disciplinary action, if any, should be imposed. Absent good cause shown by the chair of the District Disciplinary Committee, the court expects that a report and recommendation will be completed within 6 months after the referral. The chair will send the complete report and recommendation to the chief judge and a summary of the report and recommendation to the respondent.\n\nObjections to Report and Recommendation. Within 14 days after receipt of the summary report and recommendation, the respondent may submit objections to it, seek revisions, and suggest alternatives to the recommendation. The panel, after considering the response, may modify, amend, revoke, or adhere to its original recommendation and will so inform the committee chair. The chair will then send a copy of the final report and recommendation to the chief judge and a summary final report and recommendation to the respondent.\n\nDetermination by a District Judge. Within 7 days after receipt of the summary final report and recommendation, the respondent may contest any recommendation by written submission to the chief judge. Whether contested or not, the chief judge will assign the matter to a district judge for determination. The judge may conduct a hearing, and may appoint any member of the court’s bar to assist in the hearing. The judge’s decision as to whether disciplinary action is warranted, and what sanction to impose, is a final ruling of the court.\n\nConfidentiality. All papers pertaining to a matter referred to the committee must be kept confidential, except as otherwise provided above, unless the respondent requests in writing that the papers be opened to the public.\n\nReferral to Other Disciplinary Authority. The chief judge may forward a copy of the committee’s records and any court action regarding an attorney to the appropriate disciplinary authority of any bar or court that authorizes the attorney to practice law.\n\nRule AT-8.

Under the federal bankruptcy code, there are four categories of such cases:\n\nChapter 7 liquidation, suitable for giving individuals and businesses a fresh start;\n\nChapter 11 reorganization, suitable for large corporate debtors;\n\nChapter 13 reorganization, suitable for individual wage earners; and,\n\nChapter 12 reorganization, suitable for family farmers.\n\nCash Bail (English)\n\nWhat exactly is a cash bail and what is its purpose?\n\nA cash bail is a monetary deposit required by the Court to secure the temporary release of someone who is arrested and charged with a criminal offense (i.e., the “defendant”). It is meant to guarantee the appearance of the defendant at all future court proceedings.\n\nWill I get my money back?\n\nAny person who deposits a cash bail can request that the funds be returned to him/her by submitting to the Court a written document entitled, Application For Return of Cash Bail. The Court will then decide if all or part of the funds should be returned to the depositor. A form application is available upon request at the Clerk’s Office or on the “Forms” section of this Court’s website below.\n\nWhy would only a portion or none of my deposit be returned?\n\nIf the terms and conditions of the bond have not been fully met, the Court may determine that the bond should be forfeited and the deposit applied to the forfeiture. Additionally, the U.S. Attorney’s Office may request the Court to have part or all of the money deposited as cash bail applied to any debt that may be imposed upon the defendant (e.g., assessment, fine, restitution).\n\nWhy do I need to keep my receipt?\n\nThe ORIGINAL receipt MUST be submitted with the Application For Return of Cash Bail as it establishes proof of ownership of the funds deposited.\n\nWhen can I fill out an Application for Return of Cash Bail?\n\nAn Application for Return of Cash Bail can be filled out and submitted to the Clerk’s Office at any time. However, the Application should not be submitted to the Court for consideration until after the Court has entered a judgment against the defendant or the case against the defendant has been dismissed. Moreover, the Court will not consider an Application for Return of Cash Bail until the judgment becomes final and the defendant has (1) either begun his/her term of Probation, or (2) has been delivered (or has voluntarily reported) to the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCan the deposit money be returned to the defendant’s attorney?\n\nYes. A depositor may request that the money deposited as cash bail be assigned to the defendant’s attorney or to any other party (e.g., a relative, friend, etc.) by completing an Application for Assignment of Bond Funds. An assignment application form is available upon request at the Clerk’s Office or on the “Forms” section of this Court’s website below. If the assignment is approved by the Court, the assignee can fill out an Application For Return of Cash Bail once the judgment against the defendant is final, or the case against the defendant has been dismissed.\n\nWhen can I submit an Application for Assignment of Bond Funds?\n\nThe Application for Assignment of Bond Funds can be submitted at any time.\n\nCash Bail (VersiÃ³n en EspaÃ±ol)\n\nÂ¿Exactamente quÃ© es una fianza monetaria y quÃ© objeto tiene?\n\nUna fianza monetaria es un deposito monetario requerido por el Tribunal para garantizar la libertad temporal de alguien que ha sido detenido/arrestado y acusado de un delito penal (v.g.: “el acusado”). Su objeto es garantizar la comparecencia del acusado en el Tribunal en todas las etapas posteriores del proceso.\n\nÂ¿RecuperarÃ© mi dinero?\n\nToda persona que deposite una fianza monetaria puede solicitar que los fondos le sean reintegrados presentando al Tribunal un documento intitulado “Application For Return of Cash Bail” (Solicitud de DevoluciÃ³n de Fianza Monetaria).
