        "text": "Four blocks from the federal courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, a receptionist on the 21st floor of a high rise building answers the phone on behalf of multiple clientsâone being the Freedom Coalition of Doctors for Choice.\n\nThe group says it has 91 members. But in Amarillo, what matters is its claim that six of them practice in the Northern District of Texas. That, and its claim of being based in that virtual office, allowed the group to get its lawsuit seeking information about reported side effects of the Covid-19 vaccine before US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk.\n\nHeâs ruled against the Biden administration on LGBTQ rights, immigration, and distribution of the abortion drug mifepristoneâand heâs the only federal judge who handles civil cases in Amarillo.\n\nNot only did Kacsmaryk deny the Justice Departmentâs contention that the suit was improperly filed before him, he ordered that the doctorsâ group be given thousands of text entries made by people reporting effects of the vaccine.\n\nâWhen the production by the government is done, that organization will dissolve,â said Christopher Wiest, an attorney for the coalition.\n\nItâs among 18 lawsuits that show how conservative groups have tactically ensured that their legal challenges to Biden administration policies get in front of Kacsmaryk, or Mark Pittman or Reed OâConnor, Republican appointees who between them hear 90% of civil cases in Fort Worth.\n\nBloomberg Law verified and supplemented research on potential instances of judge shopping done by the left-leaning watchdog Accountable.US.\n\nThose judge-shopping strategies include claiming an address in Fort Worth or Amarillo, recruiting plaintiffs who live or work in those judicial districts, and collaborating with the state of Texas on lawsuits.\n\nFor example, one of the board members for the group in the Covid vaccine case, a physician named Richard Bartlett, said in court papers that he works in Amarillo but lists the West Texas city of Odessa, more than 300 miles away, in state medical license records. Bartlett, who briefly ran for Congress in 2019, was the subject of local media coverage in the early days of the pandemic for backing an unproven treatment for Covid-19. In 2021 he was reportedly issued a criminal trespass warning for going through a hospitalâs trash. He didnât respond to questions sent through his attorney.\n\nEach federal district court sets its own rules for assigning cases, and many randomly distribute them among a pool of judges. But thatâs not always the case in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Small or single-judge divisions are more common in rural areas of the vast state, where there arenât enough cases to justify having more judges all assigned to the same courthouse.\n\nStill, that doesnât explain why the court in Fort Worth â a little over 30 miles from the federal courthouse in downtown Dallas which houses eight active judges â largely splits its civil cases between only two judges. The district has a total of 11 active judges and five senior judges across seven divisions.\n\nThe federal judiciaryâs policy making body has urged courts to act against judge shopping. But the unenforceable guidance hasnât been acted on by the Northern District of Texas, and a federal appeals judge recently defended the district and criticized the proposed guardrails at a conference featuring many of the courtâs members.\n\nâItâs a go-to tactic that conservative groups have been using more and more frequently now and I think weâre seeing the implications of that just become more real ever so much in the past few months and years,â said Tony Carrk, executive director of Accountable.US.\n\nChief Judge David Godbey of the Northern District of Texas declined to comment. OâConnor, Pittman, and Kacsmaryk didnât respond to requests for comment.\n\nâCompletely Overblownâ\n\nGene Hamilton, vice president and general counsel for the America First Legal Foundation, a group staffed with associates of former President Donald Trump, that has filed numerous challenges in Texas courts, called the noise around judge shopping âcompletely overblown.â\n\nâPeople have realized, I guess on the other side so to speak, that there are judges in this country who are fair and who are not biased and who are not afraid to issue a decision based on the law and the facts before them. And they donât like that,â he said.\n\nTo be sure, forum shopping isnât new. Republicans accused Democrats of the tactic as they repeatedly challenged Trump administration policies in liberal-leaning courts in Washington, DC, or within the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where Democratic appointees dominated at the start of Trumpâs term.\n\nThe difference, according to Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has tracked judge shopping issues, is that court rules in Texas allow conservative groups to effectively choose their judges, not merely a court that collectively may lean a certain direction politically.\n\nAnd the tactic isnât withering away under scrutiny: Texas filed two new lawsuits in Amarillo last week alone.\n\nâI think that the behaviorâs even more targeted than it used to be. And the ability to judge shop means you can be even more precise,â Vladeck said.\n\nTraveling to Texas\n\nOne instance of attorneys flocking to Texas is a conservative Wisconsin group trying to build up its national profile. Founded in 2011 as the state became a national conservative incubator during Republican Gov. Scott Walkerâs administration, the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty says it was âfounded to ride to the sound of the guns â to go into battle to protect the freedom of Wisconsinites.â\n\nMost of its federal court fights have played out in the groupâs home state. Dan Lennington, who leads the groupâs Equality Under the Law Project, said the institute began filing lawsuits out of state after President Joe Biden took office in 2021. He estimated that 80% of his projectâs cases are now outside Wisconsin.\n\nIn 2023, the group backed three lawsuits in the Northern District of Texas, all in the Amarillo and Fort Worth divisions.\n\nIn Amarillo, the Wisconsin attorneys challenged a rule from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives on the use of stabilizing braces on handguns. One of the three lead plaintiffs is Darren Britto, a US Marine Corps veteran, firearms instructor, and writer about Second Amendment issues from Amarillo. Adding Britto gave the institute the jurisdiction it needed to get into Kacsmarykâs court.\n\nIn a March 2023 post on the website Guns.com, titled ââBraceâ Yourselves! How to Sue the ATF,â Britto said he served in a military counterdrug joint task force more than 20 years ago with WILLâs director of external affairs.\n\nâLess than two weeks before the ATF registered its new rule on stabilizing braces, we were talking on the phone. My former teammate asked me if I was willing to put my money where my mouth was regarding my stance â and here we are,â Britto wrote.\n\nBritto declined to comment, referring Bloomberg Law to WILL. Lennington said he couldnât talk about how Britto joined the litigation, citing attorney-client privilege.\n\nâIf a lawyer has the option to file a case in two different places and if itâs the lawyerâs belief or judgment that his client will get a fair shake from one judge and believes that another judge will be less fair, I think that attorney has an obligation to make a judgment call about where to use the rules to file a case,â Lennington said.\n\nKacsmaryk granted an injunction against the ATF. A month earlier, OâConnor in Fort Worth had enjoined the same rule in a separate lawsuit also brought by WILL attorneys.\n\nThere, they represented the National Association for Gun Rights, based out of Colorado, and a group called Texas Gun Rights, Inc.\n\nState records show that Texas Gun Rights, Inc. incorporated in a county outside of Fort Worth nearly four months before the lawsuit was filed. A related group, Texas Gun Rights, LLC, still has an Austin address, which is located within the US District Court for the Western District of Texas. The Austin courthouse currently only has one active, full-time district judge, an Obama appointee whoâs issued rulings against Texas policies.\n\nChris McNutt, president of Texas Gun Rights, in email responses sent by Lennington, said that the group recently split from the National Association for Gun Rights, which is why it hadnât been involved in litigation before then. He said that the Austin address was established by NAGR and kept by his group to process contributions. Lennington denied that the case is an instance of judge shopping.\n\nThe ATF challenges are now pending before the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\nMinority Funds\n\nIn July 2022, WILL sued in Floridaâs Middle District over a provision in the Biden administrationâs infrastructure law that set aside 10% of surface transportation projects for small businesses owned by women or minorities.\n\nJudge Kathryn Mizelle, a Trump appointee in the courtâs Tampa division chosen at random to hear the case, dismissed the lawsuit in March 2023, finding that plaintiff Christian Brucknerâs harm was speculative. But 11 days before that ruling came in, Bruckner and WILL pursued another case challenging a different pool of federal funds â this time in Fort Worth.\n\nIn the new lawsuit, presided over by Trump appointee Pittman, three business owners challenged race-based assistance from the Minority Business Development Agency. One was from Wisconsin, the second was Bruckner, and the third was the lead plaintiff: Jeffrey Nuziard, a Tarrant County resident and owner of the Sexual Wellness Centers of Texas. Nuziard declined a request for an interview.\n\nBruckner said that he had reached out to WILL because of his interest in making sure that disabled people like himself can have access to federal funds. âThese lawsuits are not meant to take away anything from anybody,â he said.\n\nOn March 25 this year, Pittman entered a permanent injunction against the agency from âfurther implementationâ of its âunconstitutional statutory presumption.â\n\nIn the opinion, Pittman conceded that the Wisconsin plaintiff lacked standing to bring the case but ruled in Nuziard and Brucknerâs favor, blocking the agency from using applicantsâ race or ethnicity in determining eligibility for assistance. âWhile the Agencyâs work may help alleviate opportunity gaps faced by [minority business enterprises], two wrongs do not make a right,â the judge wrote. âAnd the MBDAâs racial presumption is a wrong.â\n\nIn May, Pittman awarded the Wisconsin institute more than $360,000 in attorneysâ fees and costs.\n\nTrump Groups\n\nThe American First Legal Foundation, led by former Trump White House aide Stephen Miller, has backed roughly a dozen lawsuits in the Northern District of Texas, most challenging Biden policies. All but one were filed in Fort Worth or Amarillo.\n\nThree of the lawsuits, challenging preferences for federal funds on the basis of sex or race, were dropped by the plaintiffs. In one case, the group did that a day after OâConnor granted a temporary restraining order against preferences being used in restaurant relief funds. In another, the plaintiffs agreed to drop a challenge to aid for non-white farmers after the law was repealed.\n\nAFLâs attorneys were also behind two other complaints in which they notched wins from OâConnor. In one, the judge found that Affordable Care Act provisions on preventive care are unconstitutional, a ruling now before the Fifth Circuit.\n\nIn the other, OâConnor partly ruled against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for not making religious accommodations for employers who discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, which was largely affirmed by the New Orleans-based appeals court.\n\nHamilton, the general counsel for AFL and a former Trump administration official, disputed that judge shopping is at play in his groupâs litigation. âYou take your clients as you find them and where they are,â he said. âAnd weâve had a number of clients who live in the Northern District of Texas, and so weâve been happy to provide legal services to them, again, because thatâs where they live.â\n\nHeâs also been listed as a counsel for Texas in at least six lawsuits since 2021, work he said heâs done for free. The Texas attorney generalâs office didnât respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne of those, a multistate lawsuit filed in Amarillo, challenged a program that allows undocumented migrants to petition to bring their minor children into the US. It was transferred to the Dallas division by the courtâs then-chief judge, Barbara Lynn. She pointed to a lack of ties to Amarillo and an existing similar case in her court. No other case brought by Texas in the Northern District has been transferred to another court, according to Bloomberg Lawâs review.\n\nThe other Trump affiliated group, the America First Policy Institute, in 2021 listed on tax forms its headquarters as being in Arlington, Virginia, but by 2022 said it was based out of Fort Worth. That has allowed it to file at least three lawsuits seeking public records in the nearby court, including requests for contacts between Biden administration officials and social media companies about misinformation related to the Covid pandemic and the 2020 election. Texas state records show that the group incorporated there in 2020, but lists a Washington mailing address, and lawyers who have signed complaints filed by the group have also listed that address.\n\nMarc Lotter, a spokesperson for AFPI, said the group has been incorporated in Texas since its creation while also maintaining offices in Washington and Virginia. âIt should also be noted that despite multiple cases being filed and resolved, not once has the government challenged the venue of the case,â Lotter said.\n\nWhatâs Next\n\nThe Judicial Conference, the federal courtsâ policy making arm, in March passed non-binding guidance meant to guard against judge shopping tactics. It urged that cases involving statewide and national policies be randomly assigned among the judges of that court.\n\nBut those guidelines are non binding. A federal judiciary rules committee is considering whether to draft a binding rule but is weighing whether it has that authority.\n\nJudge James Ho, speaking at a conference for judges and lawyers of the Northern District of Texas in April, echoed an earlier speech in which he criticized the Judicial Conference for its guidance.\n\nâThis isnât about forum shopping. Itâs about forum shaming,â he said. âItâs about shaming judges who wonât distort the rulings to do their bidding, while rewarding those judges who do.â\n\nOne point on which attorneys from both political perspectives agree: thereâs nothing wrong with litigants trying to get lawsuits before judges and courts that would give them the best possible outcome, as long as they follow the rules.\n\nâSo really itâs up to the courts,ââ said Jennifer Ahearn, senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law who has argued for a rule against judge shopping tactics. âAnd the question is, when does this cross a line over into something that is patently unfair?â"
