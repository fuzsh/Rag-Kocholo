Additionally, she has served on numerous committees including the standardization committee to HB2259 on court costs.

They are currently raising two daughters who also attend Moore Public Schools.\n\nPrimary Responsibilities\n\nThe Court Clerk has the primary responsibility to record, file, and maintain permanent records of the proceedings of the District Court.

The Court Clerk's office is financed by the Court Fund, through the fees collected from court costs, fines and bond forfeitures.\n\nProcedures\n\nWe use forms and follow procedures prescribed by the Court Administrator's Office, The Oklahoma Supreme Court, and the State Auditor and Inspector.\n\nComputerized Cases\n\nCivil, domestic and criminal cases were computerized in 1989, and in 1997 probate and confidential cases were added. All records are now on computer. All records prior to that date were kept in written form in docket books."
