        "text": "August 17, 2024\n\nInitial Disclosures\n\nUnited States District Court Western District of Texas\n\nTiming\n\n14 Days After the Early Meeting\n\nA party must make the initial disclosures at or within 14 days after the parties’ Rule 26(f) conference unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order, or unless a party objects during the conference that initial disclosures are not appropriate in this action and states the objection in the proposed discovery plan. In ruling on the objection, the court must determine what disclosures, if any, are to be made and must set the time for disclosure. FRCP 26(a)(1)(C) (amended eff 12/1/15)\n\n> > Read More..\n\nLater Added Parties\n\nParties joined or served after the Rule 26(f) conference must make Rule 26(a) disclosures within thirty (30) days of being served or joined, unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order. FRCP 26(a)(1)(D) (amended eff 12/1/15)\n\n> > Read More..\n\nCalculating the Due Date or Deadline\n\nUnder amended FRCP 6 (a)(1), all deadlines stated in days, no matter the length of the period, are computed in the same way. The day of the event that triggers the deadline is not counted. All other days - including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays - are counted, with only one exception: If the period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline falls on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. FRCP 6 (a)(1).\n\nIn determining what is the \"next\" day, one must continue counting in the same direction - that is, forward when computing a forward-looking period and backward when computing a backward-looking period. FRCP 6 (a)(5).\n\n> > Read More..\n\nDisclosure Rules And Requirements\n\nDisclosures Generally\n\nExcept as exempted by Rule 26(a)(1)(B) or as otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a party must, without awaiting a discovery request, provide to the other parties:\n\nThe name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each individual likely to have discoverable information — along with the subjects of that information — that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment;\n\nA copy — or a description by category and location — of all documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things that the disclosing party has in its possession, custody, or control and may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment;\n\n> > Read More..\n\nUnacceptable Excuses\n\nA party must make its initial disclosures based on the information then reasonably available to it. A party is not excused from making its disclosures because it has not fully investigated the case or because it challenges the sufficiency of another party’s disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures. FRCP 26(a)(1)(E) (amended eff 12/1/15)\n\n> > Read More..\n\nDisclosure of Electronically Stored Information\n\nInitial disclosures pursuant to Rule 26 must include electronically stored information. FRCP 26 (a)(1)(A)(ii) (amended eff 12/1/15).\n\nThe Duty to Preserve\n\nThe extent of the duty to preserve electronically stored information is the subject of a fast-developing body of case law authority. To comply with federal discovery rules (and avoid the imposition of sanctions) very early in the action you must understand the type and substance of your client's electronically stored information, the operation of your client's information systems, and the extent of your duty to preserve the specific types of electronically stored information in your client's possession.\n\n> > Read More..\n\nDisclosure of Expert Testimony\n\nIn addition to the disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1), a party must disclose the identity of any witness it may use at trial to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705. FRCP 26 (a)(2)(A) (amended eff 12/1/15)\n\nWritten Report\n\nThe disclosure must be accompanied by a written report — prepared and signed by the witness — if the witness is one retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony or one whose duties as the party’s employee regularly involve giving expert testimony. The report must contain:\n\n> > Read More..\n\nPretrial Disclosures\n\nIn addition to the disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1) and (2), a party must provide to the other parties and promptly file the following information about the evidence that it may present at trial other than solely for impeachment:\n\n(i) the name and, if not previously provided, the address and telephone number of each witness — separately identifying those the party expects to present and those it may call if the need arises;\n\n(ii) the designation of those witnesses whose testimony the party expects to present by deposition and, if not taken stenographically, a transcript of the pertinent parts of the deposition; and\n\n> > Read More..\n\nDuty To Supplement\n\nA party who has made a disclosure under Rule 26(a) — or who has responded to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission — must supplement or correct its disclosure or response:\n\nIn a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect, and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing; or\n\nAs ordered by the court.\n\n> > Read More..\n\nFormat of Papers\n\nSignature Required\n\nEvery disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1) or (a)(3) and every discovery request, response, or objection must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney’s own name — or by the party personally, if unrepresented — and must state the signer’s address, e-mail address, and telephone number. FRCP 26(g)(1) (amended eff 12/1/15)\n\nCertification\n\n> > Read More..\n\nFiling & Service\n\nProvided To All Parties But Not Filed\n\nRule 26(a)(1) or (2) disclosures are provided to \"the other parties\", but are not filed with the court, unless they are to be used in a court proceeding or the court so orders. FRCP 5 (d)(1) (amended eff 12/1/18); FRCP 26 (a)(1)(A) (amended eff 12/1/15).\n\n> > Read More..\n\nCopyright © RPCD Holdings LLC 2003-2024 exclusive of the text of government codes."
