        "text": "A federal appeals panel expressed deep skepticism Tuesday toward Donald Trump’s argument that he can’t be prosecuted for trying to overturn the 2020 election, raising the potentially extreme implications of absolute presidential immunity.\n\nTrump’s lawyers argued that his federal election subversion indictment should be dismissed because he is immune from prosecution. But the three judges on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit panel questioned whether this immunity theory championed by Trump’s lawyers would allow presidents to sell pardons or even assassinate political opponents.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith’s team argued that a president is not above the law, warning that allowing presidential immunity from prosecution would open a “floodgate” and saying that it would be “awfully scary” if there were no criminal mechanism to stop future president’s from usurping the vote and remaining in power.\n\nStill, the judges also wondered if they even have jurisdiction to decide the question of presidential immunity at this point in the case. Trump is scheduled to go on trial in March for his role in trying to overturn the 2020 election. He has pleaded not guilty. Trump chose to attend the hearing – a reminder of the role that his four criminal indictments are playing in his presidential campaign.\n\nThe appeals court ruling is likely to set up a showdown over presidential immunity at the Supreme Court. The judges have not set a deadline but given the circumstances it’s unlikely they will take too much time.\n\nHere are key takeaways from Tuesday’s oral arguments:\n\nJudges worry about scope and impact of Trump’s immunity argument: The Circuit Court judges asked pointed questions of Trump attorney John Sauer over his claims that Trump has immunity because his actions after losing the 2020 election were part of his presidential duties. The judges also challenged him on his claim that Trump could only face criminal prosecution if he was first impeached and convicted by Congress for the same conduct. DC Circuit Court Judge Karen Henderson, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, appeared dubious that Trump was acting within his official duties. “I think it is paradoxical to say that his constitutional duty to take care of the laws be faithfully executed allows him to violate criminal law,” Henderson said. Some of the judges pushed back on Trump’s immunity claims by highlighting the potentially dangerous path that it could lead to, with future presidents being able to brazenly break the law without consequences.\n\nKey debate over whether Trump’s impeachment prevents prosecution: Trump’s attorney Sauer argued that a president can only be criminally charged and tried following a conviction for the alleged actions in the Senate. He had been acquitted by the Senate in February 2021. Judge Florence Pan, a President Joe Biden nominee, questioned Sauer over his contention that impeachment and conviction by Congress was required for any criminal prosecution – while also pressing him to acknowledge that he was conceding that there is a path for presidents to face prosecution. “Once you concede that presidents can be prosecuted under some circumstances, your separation of powers argument falls away, and the issues before us are narrowed to are you correct in your interpretation of the impeachment judgment clause?” Pan said.\n\nTrump lawyer says immunity keeps shut ‘Pandora’s box’ for indicting presidents: Sauer painted a picture of what he called a dangerous “Pandora’s box” of indicting former presidents for actions they took while in office. He argued that special counsel Smith’s decision to bring charges against Trump could lead to similar prosecutions. He warned that this case could theoretically lead to charges against Biden, Barack Obama or George W. Bush. “To authorize the prosecution of a president for his official acts would open up Pandora’s box from which this nation may never recover,” Sauer said.\n\nRead more key takeaways.\n\nThe packed courtroom in Washington, DC, fell silent at around 9:25 a.m. ET when former President Donald Trump entered. He wore his standard navy blue suit and red tie. His entourage included adviser and lawyer Boris Epshteyn and Walt Nauta, his co-defendant in the classified documents case pending in federal court in southern Florida.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith entered the room about 25 minutes before Trump arrived. He was flanked by more than a dozen members of his team. Smith walked a few rows back to talk to the parents of James Pearce, a lawyer arguing for the government.\n\nThe room, ringed with portraits of previous members of this appeals court, rose when the three judges hearing this case entered.\n\nTrump rose along with everyone and appeared mostly subdued for much of the day’s arguments.\n\nThe former president leaned forward at times; seemingly to better hear judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, a George H.W. Bush appointee, who spoke softly, and occasionally spoke to one of his attorneys.\n\nHe was much more active when Pearce began making his presentation. He began taking notes on a yellow pad and occasionally passing his notes to his attorney John Sauer.\n\nThe former president appeared to purse his lips and looked ahead when one of the judges cited Trump claims from the congressional record. He wrote notes and passed them along.\n\nIt’s unclear if Sauer used any of Trump’s notes, but near the end of the hearing, Sauer noted that all allegations against the president related to activity while he was in office. Sauer motioned toward his client and Trump nodded.\n\nAs the proceeding ended, Trump rose, looked around the room briefly and then slowly walked out.\n\nUnlike previous court hearings it didn’t appear Trump and Smith looked at each other.\n\nRemember: There were no cameras inside the federal courtroom but a live audio feed of the hearing was broadcast. CNN’s reporters were inside the room providing updates on the proceedings.\n\nAs the longest serving jurist on this panel, and the sole Republican appointee among these three, what senior Judge Karen Henderson does in this case will be closely watched and a signal to many other judges that could also be asked to consider these issues, including the Supreme Court.\n\nHenderson was skeptical that Donald Trump was acting within his official duties when he tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, saying that Trump attorney John Sauer’s arguments appear “paradoxical.”\n\nHenderson had several cases about the American presidency before her, and she’s written extensively about the presidency and how courts should think about protections around it.\n\nShe’s even been on an appeals court panel for a previous Trump case, when he challenged Congress’ ability to receive his tax returns from the IRS after he left office. Henderson at that case’s oral arguments had, surprisingly, asked if there should have been special consideration if Trump ran for office again — which he is now doing. (His tax returns were ultimately released, following the courts’ approval.)\n\nBut in a concurring opinion that Congress could get Trump’s tax returns, Henderson pointed out she believed “the burdens borne by the Executive Branch are more severe and warrant much closer scrutiny” than what others on the panel said at that time.\n\nHenderson also previously had to consider immunity around the presidency, when she sat on the DC Circuit panel regarding a congressional subpoena of Trump’s then-White House counsel Don McGahn. She wrote at that time that McGahn couldn’t avoid responding to his subpoena entirely by claiming absolute immunity around the presidency, but could invoke some protections around the presidency to limit what he would have to say to Congress.\n\nShe noted in her concurring opinion in that case that criminal investigations could reach further into the bubble around the presidency because of grand jury’s needs, and that lawsuits against sitting presidents for their unofficial acts couldn’t be dodged with a temporary presidential immunity claim.\n\nMost Americans don’t believe that former president Donald Trump should be immune from prosecution for his actions during his presidency, a recent survey shows.\n\nIn a January CBS News/YouGov poll, US adults say, 64% to 36%, that Trump should not have immunity from criminal prosecution for actions he took while president. Both an 86% majority of Democrats and about two-thirds of independents say Trump should not have immunity, while 69% of Republicans say that he should.\n\nIn the same survey, a slimmer 53% majority of Americans say they view the indictments against Trump as “upholding the rule of law,” with an identical 53% dismissing the idea that they constitute “an unfair attempt to stop Trump’s 2024 campaign.”\n\nAbout two-thirds of Americans say they’ve heard or read at least some news relating to the indictment charges brought against Trump relating to January 6th and the 2020 presidential election, with just 31% saying they’ve heard or read a lot about it.\n\nIn a December poll from the Washington Post and the University of Maryland, 57% of Americans said that the Justice Department was “holding Trump under the law like anyone else” by charging him with criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States, with 41% saying the Justice Department was “unfairly targeting Trump for political reasons.” Just 4% of voters who supported Joe Biden in 2020 viewed the charges as unfairly politicized, while a slightly larger 16% of 2020 Trump voters viewed the charges as providing accountability.\n\nIn a CNN survey taken last summer, 47% of Americans said that Trump was facing so many criminal charges largely as a result of his own actions, with a smaller 31% saying those charges were largely a result of political abuse of the justice system, and the remainder demurring.\n\nTwo Supreme Court cases involving former President Richard Nixon are being tossed around quite a bit during Tuesday’s hearing, as both sides point to the pair of immunity disputes decided by the high court decades ago to bolster their arguments in the latest immunity controversy.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s team has pointed to a 1982 Supreme Court case involving Nixon in which a 5-4 court said the then-former president was “entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his official acts.”\n\nThe decision handed a win to Nixon, who was trying to fend off a civil lawsuit brought against him and two White House aides by a former Defense Department whistleblower who claimed his ousting was in retaliation for damning congressional testimony about government cost overruns.\n\nMore than 40 years later, Trump’s team is citing the ruling, authored by Justice Lewis Powell, to reinforce their argument that he should be shielded from criminal prosecution.\n\n“The President’s ‘unique position in the constitutional scheme,’ … guarantees him immunity from trial,” they wrote.\n\nBut the special counsel’s team pushed back strongly on those arguments, writing in their own brief that the court’s decision in the Nixon civil matter “does not render a former President immune from criminal liability when charged with violations of generally applicable federal criminal statutes.”\n\nThe other immunity case expected to get a lot of play during the hearing, US v. Nixon, is likely more familiar to the general public. In that case, the Supreme Court in 1974 unanimously rejected Nixon’s claims of presidential privilege in a subpoena fight over Oval Office tapes sought by prosecutors in one of the Watergate-era criminal cases.\n\n“Judicial review of Presidential compliance with the law continues to the present,” special counsel Jack Smith’s teams told the appeals court, citing the 1974 case. “And significantly here, courts have conclusively rejected Presidential claims of unreviewable power to resist criminal process.”\n\nThe appeals court hearing on former President Donald Trump’s immunity claims started with a slight detour to discuss the question of whether the court should even be hearing the case.\n\nIn a brief filed in the appeals case, the watchdog group American Oversight argued the DC District Court doesn’t have jurisdiction to take up Trump’s immunity appeal before trial. The group says that unless there is an explicit constitutional or statutory guarantee cited that would stop a trial from occurring, the issue should be left for appeal until after the trial.\n\nAmerican Oversight argued that the only two constitutional provisions that would stop a trial from occurring are in the Speech or Debate clause and the Double Jeopardy clause, neither of which are being relied upon by Trump in his appeal of presidential immunity, according to the group.\n\nInstead, Trump cites the Impeachment Judgement clause to argue that because Trump was acquitted by the Senate of causing an insurrection, he shouldn’t be allowed to be again prosecuted by special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nAmerican Oversight, in their brief, argues that this is different from the Double Jeopardy clause in the Constitution, which prohibits individuals from being prosecuted twice for the same crime, the Impeachment Judgement clause never explicitly states a “guarantee that trial will not occur.”\n\nTrump attorney John Sauer told the court that presidential immunity is an issue that should be addressed now, so Trump wouldn’t be deprived of protections he may have as a defendant from sitting for trial.\n\nA federal appeals court is hearing arguments Tuesday over whether Donald Trump is immune from prosecution for actions he took after the 2020 election, one of the key questions that could determine the former president’s legal and political fate in 2024.\n\nTrump is attend the oral arguments in the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit where a three-judge panel will decide whether the federal charges brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith should be dismissed based on Trump’s claims of immunity.\n\nTrump’s presence at the 9:30 a.m. ET hearing Tuesday – less than week before the Iowa caucuses – underscores how intertwined Trump’s legal and political worlds have become, as the former president has made the four criminal indictments against him a key part of his pitch to his supporters in the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe immunity question is ultimately expected to end up before the Supreme Court, one of several consequential questions the high court will take up related to Trump this year. On Friday, the US Supreme Court said it would review next month the Colorado Supreme Court’s unprecedented decision to remove Trump from its state ballot.\n\nTrump faces four counts from Smith’s election subversion charges, including conspiring to defraud the United States and to obstruct an official proceeding. The former president has pleaded not guilty.\n\nHere’s what to know for Tuesday’s arguments:\n\nA key question for Trump’s legal peril: District Judge Tanya Chutkan has declined to dismiss the election subversion charges against Trump, ruling that he does not have absolute immunity for what he said and did after the 2020 election.\n\n“Whatever immunities a sitting President may enjoy, the United States has only one Chief Executive at a time, and that position does not confer a lifelong ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ pass,” Chutkan wrote. “Former Presidents enjoy no special conditions on their federal criminal liability.”\n\nTrump appealed that decision to the appeals court. Trump’s attorneys have argued that his actions trying to overturn the 2020 election fell within his duties as president because Trump was working to “ensure election integrity” as part of his official capacity as president, and therefore he is immune from criminal prosecution.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nThe Washington, DC, Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments soon on whether the federal election subversion case against Donald Trump should be dismissed based on the former president’s claims of immunity.\n\nTrump’s attorneys have argued that his actions following the 2020 election fell within his duties as president and are therefore immune from criminal prosecution\n\nDuring the hearing, Trump’s attorneys will have 20 minutes to make their case to the panel of appeals judges. The special counsel’s office will then have 20 minutes, followed by a five-minute rebuttal argument from Trump’s team. The judges can ask questions during each sides’ arguments.\n\nThese are the three judges on the panel hearing the case:\n\nJ. Michelle Childs: Childs was nominated to the appeals court by President Joe Biden in January 2022 and took the bench that July. She was on Biden’s shortlist to replace outgoing Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, but he ultimately picked Ketanji Brown Jackson. Before joining the appeals court, Childs was a federal judge in North Carolina since 2010.\n\nFlorence Pan: Pan was nominated to the appeals court by Biden in May 2022 to fill the seat vacated by Jackson after she was confirmed to the Supreme Court. Previously, Pan served as a judge for the Superior and District courts in DC for more than 10 years.\n\nKaren LeCraft Henderson: Henderson is the senior judge on the appeals court panel hearing the Trump case. She was appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990. Henderson has previously heard several cases involving Trump, including whether Congress could access his tax records and whether the House could enforce a subpoena on former Trump White House Counsel, Don McGahn. She has repeatedly expressed concerns about safeguarding the special protections around the presidency in her previous opinions.\n\nWhat happens after this hearing: Once Tuesday’s hearing concludes in the federal election subversion case, the panel of appeals judges could issue a written ruling at any time. They will not rule from the bench.\n\nTheir order can, and likely will, be appealed further to the US Supreme Court. Late last year, special counsel Jack Smith took the extraordinary and unusual step to ask the court to skip the appeals courts and fast-track the issue of presidential immunity, but the justices denied that request.\n\nEither side could also ask for the case to be reheard by the DC Court of Appeals after the ruling.\n\nThe issue of presidential immunity will likely need to be decided before Trump goes to trial, which is currently scheduled to begin in March. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the criminal election subversion case, has paused all deadlines in the case until the appeals play out, which could push back the trial date.\n\nThe idea that any White House candidate would show up in court, just days before the Iowa caucuses, to challenge a 250-year understanding of the scope of the presidency is extraordinary.\n\nBut Donald Trump will again try to stretch those powers to save himself on Tuesday in a high-stakes court gambit that, if it succeeds, would place him and anyone else elected president above the law.\n\nGiven the 45th president’s oft-stated belief that he had near omnipotent powers when he was in office – and that he still might be entitled to them – the history-making spectacle about to unfold is not that surprising. The front-runner for the GOP nomination says he will be in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to watch his lawyers argue that he has “absolute immunity” from prosecution in his federal 2020 election interference case.\n\nThe case, and a looming trial, springs from Trump’s efforts to thwart the will of voters after he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. But with its proximity to Monday’s Iowa caucuses, which kick off 2024 voting, the case represents an ominous foreshadowing of how Trump envisages a possible second term. The former commander in chief has already warned that a possible return to the White House would be dedicated to “retribution,” which would likely test constitutional constraints as never before.\n\nTrump on Monday made similar immunity claims in Georgia, where he’s trying to dismiss the state-level criminal charges against him, which stem from his efforts to subvert the election in the swing state.\n\nIf he were able to establish in the courts, albeit in a long-shot case, that an ex-president is free from prosecution for alleged crimes he committed while in power, he could not only loosen the constitutional guardrails around the office if he wins in November. He could change the way presidents act in the future – and the extent to which any autocratic instincts can be held in check.\n\nRead the full analysis.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is arguing that he should have presidential immunity against prosecution related to special counsel Jack Smith’s election subversion case. His lawyers will make the argument to a federal appeals court on Tuesday.\n\nThe indictment in the criminal case alleges Trump and a co-conspirator “attempted to exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol by calling lawmakers to convince them … to delay the certification” of the election, among other things.\n\nThe trial has been scheduled for March 4, but proceedings have been paused while the appeals process over the immunity claim plays out.\n\nHere’s a closer look at how we got here:\n\nFederal judge refuses to dismiss charges against Trump: At the beginning of December, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who presides over the criminal case, said Trump does not enjoy absolute immunity for what he said and did after the 2020 election.\n\n“The court cannot conclude that our Constitution cloaks former Presidents with absolute immunity for any federal crimes they committed while in office,” Chutkan wrote.\n\nTrump’s lawyers had asked Chutkan to throw out the four charges he faced because they said Trump was working to “ensure election integrity” as part of his official capacity as president when he allegedly undermined the 2020 election results and therefore is protected under presidential immunity.\n\nTrump’s lawyers appeal Chutkan’s decision: Trump’s team asked the appeals court to examine the immunity ruling and once again throw out the federal election subversion criminal case.\n\nTrump’s lawyers said Saturday that Chutkan “missed what the Founders recognized: That punishment of the President is irreducibly political and so belongs primarily to the branch most politically accountable — Congress and, ultimately, the Senate.”\n\nThe appeal filing reiterates what the former president’s lawyers have repeatedly asserted — that Trump was working in his official capacity and that his indictment is unconstitutional because presidents cannot be criminally prosecuted for “official acts” unless they are impeached and convicted by the Senate.\n\nSmith asks the US Supreme Court to review: On December 22, the Supreme Court rejected a request by Smith to fast-track arguments on whether Trump has any immunity from federal prosecution. The court did not explain its reasoning and there were no noted dissents.\n\nAn expedited review of the issue was already underway at the DC Circuit, which had scheduled Tuesday’s oral arguments. Smith’s team was trying to bypass the appeals court by having the justices step in beforehand.\n\nBoth sides will still have the option of appealing the eventual ruling by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals up to the high court. Trump’s strategy has been to delay the criminal case, including mounting a protracted fight over the immunity question, which must be settled before his case goes to trial.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith pushed back on former President Donald Trump’s claim that he should be cloaked with absolute immunity from criminal prosecution.\n\nIn a filing at the end of December, he argued that the sweeping assertion “threatens to license Presidents to commit crimes to remain in office.”\n\nTrump’s lawyers will present oral arguments before a US appeals court in Washington, DC, on Tuesday.\n\nTrump faces four counts in Smith’s election subversion case, including conspiring to defraud the United States and to obstruct an official proceeding. The former president has pleaded not guilty.\n\nSmith warned that allowing a former president this kind of broad immunity poses extreme danger.\n\n“The implications of the defendant’s broad immunity theory are sobering. In his view, a court should treat a President’s criminal conduct as immune from prosecution as long as it takes the form of correspondence with a state official about a matter in which there is a federal interest, a meeting with a member of the Executive Branch, or a statement on a matter of public concern,” the filing reads.\n\nPre-trial proceedings were temporarily put on hold in the criminal case pending Trump’s appeal. The trial was initially scheduled to begin on March 4.\n\nThe former president’s lawyers have advocated repeatedly for the trial to take place after the 2024 presidential election in November, with Trump’s fight over the immunity claim underscoring those efforts.\n\nDonald Trump’s lawyers are set to argue in federal court today that the former president is immune from prosecution stemming from his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump is asking the federal appeals court to throw out the federal election subversion criminal case in Washington, DC, arguing that he is protected under presidential immunity.\n\nTrump wants the DC Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn a lower-court ruling rejecting his claims of immunity in special counsel Jack Smith’s case.\n\nThe appeals panel is weighing Trump’s request, which the Supreme Court previously refused to take up on an expedited basis after a request by Smith.\n\nThe filing at the end of December reiterates what the former president’s lawyers have repeatedly asserted — that Trump was working in his official capacity as president to “ensure election integrity” when he allegedly undermined the 2020 election results and therefore has immunity, and that his indictment is unconstitutional because presidents cannot be criminally prosecuted for “official acts” unless they are impeached and convicted by the Senate.\n\n“The Constitution establishes a powerful structural check to prevent political factions from abusing the formidable threat of criminal prosecution to disable the President and attack their political enemies,” Trump’s attorneys wrote.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The former president has been attempting to delay his March 4 trial in the case, with his fight over the immunity claim underscoring those efforts. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing his criminal case, temporarily paused all procedural deadlines while the appeal plays out."
