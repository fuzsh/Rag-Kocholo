        "text": "TYLER, Texas (KLTV) - A significant pay increase for indigent defense attorneys is back on the table in Smith County.\n\nSmith County Judge Neal Franklin and County Auditor Ann Wilson shared the news Wednesday at a meeting of district and county court-at-law judges. The new proposal would raise pay for contract attorneys in Smith County from $95,000 a year to $120,000. Along with the pay increase, three district courts will each get an additional indigent defense attorney. The original plan was to add a total of four, but Judge Robert Wilson offered to put his new position on pause to allow for the contract attorney pay increase.\n\nNews of the $25,000 raise being added to the budget came a day after attorneys and judges traded criminal court for Tuesday’s meeting of the Smith County Commissioners Court. They were there to ask the court to give the contract attorneys a substantial raise; something one attorney said isn’t a need or a want, but instead a moral obligation to people who can’t afford legal representation.\n\n“What we’re talking about here is not a need,” 475th District Court Judge Taylor B. Heaton said. “This is a triage to prevent crisis.”\n\nThe commissioners court heard passionate pleas from judges and attorneys one after another, asking the county to give court-appointed indigent defense attorneys a raise to stay competitive with neighboring counties.\n\n“We’re not funding lawyers,” said 114th District Court Judge Austin Reeve Jackson. “We’re trying to fund an indigent defense system with as much stability, predictability, and cost savings for the county as we can. And if we lose the contract system, we lose all of that.”\n\nSmith County currently pays contract attorneys $95,000 per year, compared to $110,000 in Henderson County and $125,000 in Van Zandt County. At the time of Tuesday’s meeting, county leaders were planning to give the attorneys a $5,000 raise.\n\n“We need to address the issue, and we need to address it now,” said attorney Jim Wheeler, who is a former district attorney. “There’s nobody coming behind us. You are not going to have first and second-degree felonies handled by youngsters straight out of law school.”\n\nWheeler mentioned two attorneys who’ve already left Smith County for better pay in other counties. A problem he and others fear will get worse - slowing the criminal justice system and leading to an increase in the jail population.\n\nRELATED:\n\nJudges trade criminal court for commissioners court to advocate for contract attorney pay increase\n\nSmith County budget calls for increase in pay for court-appointed attorneys\n\nSmith County judges discuss solutions to problems retaining, attracting indigent criminal defense attorneys"
