        "text": "The Federal Reserve is the U.S. central bank, created by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 to establish a monetary system that could respond effectively to stresses in the banking system. The Federal Reserve System includes\n\nThe Board of Governors, a federal agency located in Washington, D.C., and\n\n12 Federal Reserve Banks around the nation.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System performs five key functions that serve all Americans and promote the health and stability of the U.S. economy and financial system. It conducts the nationâs monetary policy, promotes financial system stability, supervises and regulates financial institutions, fosters payment and settlement system safety and efficiency, and promotes consumer protection and community development.\n\nTwelve Operating Arms around Our Nation\n\nThe 12 Reserve Banksâand their 24 Branchesâare the operating arms of the Federal Reserve System. Each Reserve Bank operates within its own particular geographic area, or district, of the United States.\n\nAlthough supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, the Reserve Banks operate independently in many respects. The Reserve Banks carry out a number of core Fed functions, such as\n\nsupervising and examining banks and other financial institutions;\n\nenforcing compliance with federal consumer protection and fair lending laws while promoting local community development; and\n\nlending to depository institutions to ensure liquidity in the financial system.\n\nThey also play a key role in another primary Fed functionâfostering the safety and efficiency of our nation's payment systems, including\n\ndistributing currency and coins to banks, operating electronic payment systems, and clearing our checks; and\n\nacting as the \"government's bank\" by providing services such as maintaining the Treasury Department's transaction account and issuing and redeeming U.S. government securities.\n\nThe Reserve Banks also provide a wealth of information on conditions across the nationâinformation that is vital to formulating a national monetary policy that helps maintain a healthy U.S. economy and stable financial system.\n\nThe FOMC's monetary policy actions influence interest rates and credit conditions, which can significantly impact financial conditions, including economic productivity and even spending and investment decisions by households, communities, and businesses.\n\nThe FOMC makes all decisions regarding the appropriate position or \"stance\" of monetary policy to help move the economy toward the congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nTwelve Operating Arms around Our Nation\n\nThe 12 Reserve Banksâand their 24 Branchesâare the operating arms of the Federal Reserve System.
