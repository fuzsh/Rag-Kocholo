        "text": "Longtime federal prosecutor Ernest Gonzalez has been nominated to fill a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas.\n\nBackground\n\nErnesto Gonzalez, who goes by Ernest, received a B.A. from the University of Texas at San Antonio in 1987 and a J.D. from the Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University in 1993. Gonzalez subsequently became an Assistant District Attorney in Bexar County.\n\nIn 2000, Gonzalez became a federal prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas. In 2003, he shifted to become a federal prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas. He has held that position until 2023, when he became a senior advisor with the U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Division Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Section.\n\nHistory of the Seat\n\nGonzalez has been nominated for a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. This seat opened on December 1, 2022, when Judge Frank Montalvo took senior status.\n\nLegal Experience\n\nGonzalez started his legal career in Bexar County (San Antonio) where he worked as a state level prosecutor. However, since 2000, Gonzalez has served as a federal prosecutor, starting in the Western District of Texas and then moving to the Eastern District of Texas and the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nDuring his time as a federal prosecutor, Gonzalez prosecuted a number of cases involving narcotics distribution. See, e.g., United States v. Loza-Gracia, 670 F.3d 639 (5th Cir. 2012). For example, he handled an appeal before the Fifth Circuit in a case involving the distribution of methamphetamine in Eastern Texas. See United States v. Garcia Mendoza, 587 F.3d 682 (5th Cir. 2009).\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, Gonzalez also responded in opposition to motions for compassionate release for prisoners sentenced for narcotics distribution offenses. See, e.g., United States v. Dodd, 471 F. Supp. 3d 750 (E.D. Tex. 2020); United States v. Boutte, 568 F. Supp. 3d 706 (E.D. Tex. 2021).\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nAs a lifelong prosecutor with extensive experience litigating on both the state and federal levels, Gonzalez brings a fairly conventional set of experiences to the bench, but this still should render him a fairly uncontroversial nominee. While Gonzalez may draw questions based on his lack of civil experience, given that he has the support of his home state senators, he should nonetheless be confirmed comfortably, while the White House can be happy with one of its political appointees moving to the bench.\n\nEl Paso based Magistrate Judge Leon Schydlower should be a safe choice to join the short-staffed Western District of District.\n\nBackground\n\nSchydlower received a B.A. from the University of Texas at Austin in 1993 and a J.D. from the University of Texas School of Law in 1995. He subsequently worked with the Judge Advocate General Corps in the U.S. Navy for two years and then joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Hawaii as a Special Assistant U.S. Attorney.\n\nIn 2000, Schydlower moved to El Paso to work for the Kemp Smith law firm and shifted to being a solo practitioner two years later. At the same time, Schydlower continued to work with the U.S. Navy Reserve and then with the U.S. Air Force Reserve Judge Advocate Corps.\n\nIn 2015, Schydlower was appointed as a U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Texas, where he currently works.\n\nHistory of the Seat\n\nSchydlower has been nominated for a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. This seat opened on February 26, 2021, when Judge Philip Ray Martinez passed away.\n\nLegal Experience\n\nSchydlower started his legal career with the U.S. Navy JAG Corps, and moved on to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Hawaii, where he prosecuted various offenses, including the theft of government property. See United States v. Chon, 210 F.3d 990 (9th Cir. 2000).\n\nIn 2000, Schydlower moved to El Paso and worked in private practice. Schydlower’s civil practice included medical malpractice cases, see, e.g., In re Navar, 143 S.W.3d 869 (Tex. App. 8th Dist. 2004), as well as federal habeas cases. See Berkley v. Quarterman, 507 F. Supp. 2d 692 (W.D. Tex. 2007). Schydlower has also represented plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases. See, e.g., Mitchell v. Zia Park, LLC, 842 F. Supp. 2d 1316 (D.N.M. 2012).\n\nAmong his more notable cases, Schydlower represented Maria Castillo, whose medical malpractice claims were dismissed by the trial court for failure to provide an adequate expert report, which was affirmed by the court of appeals. See Castillo v. August, 248 S.W.3d 874 (Tex. App. 8th Dist. 2008). Schydlower also represented Christopher Houseman, an immigration agent, who sued a Mexican publishing company for publishing his photo alongside an article about an immigration agent who had been arrested for involvement in narcotrafficking. See Houseman v. Publicaciones Paso del Norte, 242 S.W.3d 518 (Tex. App. 8th Dist. 2007). The defamation claim was dismissed, with a finding that a reasonable listener would be unlikely have been mislead by the photo and caption. See id.\n\nOn the criminal side, Schydlower represented defendants in both Texas and New Mexico, taking court appointed cases. See, e.g., United States v. Quaintance, 471 F. Supp. 2d 1153 (D.N.M. 2006). Schydlower also handled a number of criminal appeals before the Fifth and Tenth Circuits. See, e.g., United States v. Montano, 472 F.3d 1202 (10th Cir. 2007).\n\nJurisprudence\n\nSchydlower has served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge since 2015. In this capacity, Schydlower presided over the pretrial aspects and discovery stages of cases, and prepared reports and recommendations for district judges. He also presided over cases by consent. Among the more prominent cases where Schydlower prepared a Report and Recommendation, he recommended that Judge David Guaderrama deny a motion for summary judgment brought by police officers sued for unlawful entry into the home of the plaintiff. See ER v. Jasso, 573 F. Supp. 3d 1117 (W.D. Tex. 2021). While the officers alleged that their actions were protected by qualified immunity, Schydlower rejected those claims, and Guaderrama agreed, denying summary judgment on those claims. See id.\n\nPolitical Activity\n\nSchydlower has a relatively limited political donation history, which includes donations to State Rep. Joseph Moody, and Rep. Silvestre Reyes, both Democrats.\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nAs a judge with a plaintiff-friendly background who nonetheless has won the support of his home state senators, Schydlower should be seen as a consensus nominee and should be comfortably confirmed.\n\nThe lack of diversity of Trump’s judicial nominees has already drawn criticism. Trump has been especially slow about nominating African American judges, naming just six to date. As such, the nomination of Jason Pulliam, who will be the first African American judge on the Western District of Texas, is particularly welcome.\n\nBackground\n\nJason Kenneth Pulliam was born in 1971 in Brooklyn. After getting a B.A. and an M.A. from Brooklyn College, CUNY, Pulliam received a J.D. Texas Southern University Thurgood Marshall School of Law in 2000. After his graduation, Pulliam spent three years as a Judge Advocate in the U.S. Marine Corps.[1]\n\nAfter leaving the Marines, Pulliam spent the next six years as an associate in private practice, moving between The Carlson Law Firm, Ball & Weed P.C. and Ford & Murray PLLC. In 2011, Pulliam became a Judge with the Bexar County Court of Law No. 5.[2] In 2015, he was appointed by outgoing Gov. Rick Perry as a Justice on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, in 2016, Pulliam lost re-election to fellow Bexar County Court judge Irene Alarcon Rios. He then joined the San Antonio office of Prichard Young LLP as a Counsel.\n\nIn 2018, Pulliam once again ran for the Fourth Circuit, but again lost the election to incumbent judge Patricia Alvarez, a Democrat.\n\nHistory of the Seat\n\nPulliam has been nominated for a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. This seat opened on December 31, 2017, when Judge Sam Sparks took senior status. While Pulliam was previously considered for vacancies filled by Judges Walter Counts and Fernando Rodriguez, he was ultimately recommended in mid-2018 for the Sparks vacancy, based out of Austin.[3] However, while Pulliam was selected as a nominee by the White House in August 2018, he was not formally nominated until March 2019.\n\nLegal Experience\n\nPulliam started his legal career as a Judge Advocate in the U.S. Marine Corps, where he served as a criminal defense and legal assistance attorney while serving on active duty. During this period, Pulliam was trial defense counsel for James D. Mohammad, who was convicted for failing to follow an order to get inoculated based on his Muslim faith.[4] Mohammad appealed, arguing that Pulliam was ineffective in his defense, but the Court of Criminal Appeals found that Pulliam had adequately researched the defenses Mohammad sought and had declined to bring them because they were specious.[5]\n\nFrom 2004 to 2010, Pulliam worked in private practice, where he handled a variety of cases, including personal injury, civil litigation, and malpractice. In this period, Pulliam notably defended RV Insurance Solutions LLC, a collection agency, against allegations that it had illegally misappropriated customer funds.[6]\n\nJurisprudence\n\nPulliam served as a county court judge from 2011 to 2014 and as an appellate judge from 2015 to 2016. In the latter position, Pulliam sat as part of 3-judge panels to oversee appeals in the Fourth Circuit, which covered much of Southern Texas. As an appellate judge, Pulliam notably dismissed a class action suit by a team of 1400 plaintiffs who alleged that payday lenders had improperly used criminal prosecution against their debtors.[7] In his opinion, Pulliam found that the suits were foreclosed by arbitration clauses in the payday contracts.[8] However, Judge Rebeca Martinez dissented from Pulliam’s conclusion.[9]\n\nIn another notable case, Pulliam held that Dino Villareal, a transgender man[10], could not bring suit for a paternity action for the adoptive children of his female partner.[11] This holding also drew dissents, including one on the merits from Judge Martinez.[12]\n\nPolitical Activity\n\nAs noted earlier, Pulliam ran as a Republican in Texas judicial elections, losing to Democratic candidates in 2016 and 2018. In addition, Pulliam donated to Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers in 2016.[13]\n\nSpeeches and Writings\n\nWhile a sitting judge and judicial candidate in 2016, Pulliam appeared on an interview with the Black Video Network, where he discussed his role as a judge and key issues.[14] Among the topics he is asked to address, Pulliam discusses police brutality and Black Lives Matter noting:\n\n“[Protestors] have an absolute right to protest under the First Amendment. They have a right to seek redress for grievances, and I think we should encourage that as long as it doesn’t ever become violent. Folks probably need to have a specific agenda and list of items that they seek redress for those grievances. They may want to petition their city council or their state legislature, and then seek to change by being part of the process.”[15]\n\nLater in the interview, Pulliam contrasted himself with Judge Rios, his opponent, by noting that he has criminal and civil experience, while Rios only has civil experience.[16]\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nPulliam was the first African American Republican to be a Bexar County judge when he was appointed in 2011. He then became the first African American on the Fourth Circuit and, would, if confirmed, become the first African American on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas.\n\nSetting aside his contribution to the diversity of the federal bench, Pulliam’s record is conservative but not overly political. While Pulliam may draw criticism for his decisions in the CASH BIZ and Sandoval cases, such concerns are unlikely to derail his nomination.\n\n[1] Sen. Comm. on the Judiciary, 115th Cong., Jason K.

However, Alan Albright became a judge at just 32 years of age and left the bench before he was forty. As such, the seasoned litigator, now 58, is still young enough to serve on the bench for another thirty years.\n\nBackground\n\nAlan D. Albright was born on November 24, 1959 in Hershey, PA. After getting a B.A. from Trinity University in 1981, Albright received a J.D. from the University of Texas Law School in 1984. After his graduation, Albright served as a law clerk to Judge James Nowlin on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas.[1]\n\nAfter his clerkship, Albright joined McGinnis, Lochridge & Kilgore LLP. as an associate. Two years later, he joined the Austin office of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld as an associate. In 1992, Albright, only 32, was tapped to be a U.S. Magistrate Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas.\n\nAlbright left the bench in 1999 to join the Austin office of Thompson & Knight LLP. Two years later, he left Thompson to join Gray Cary (now DLA Piper) as a Partner. In 2005, he moved to the Austin office of Fish & Richardson as a Partner. In 2009, he joined the Austin office of Bracewell & Giuliani (now Bracewell) as a Partner. In 2014, he left Bracewell to become a Partner at Sutherland Asbill & Brennan. In 2015, he returned to Bracewell as a Partner, and works there to this day.\n\nHistory of the Seat\n\nAlbright has been nominated for a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. This seat opened on September 14, 2016, when Judge Walter Scott Smith Jr. retired amidst allegations of sexual misconduct.[2] In February 2017, Albright applied for a federal judgeship with an Evaluation Committee set up by Texas Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz.[3] He interviewed with the Committee in March 2017 and then with Cornyn and Cruz in April. Albright interviewed with the White House and Department of Justice on July 18, 2017.[4] He was nominated on January 24, 2018.\n\nLegal Experience\n\nAlbright’s work in private practice can be divided into two periods sandwiched around his seven years on the bench. The first period was from 1986, when Albright finished his clerkship, to 1992, when he became a federal judge. During his period, Albright primarily worked in insurance litigation, starting at the Austin firm McGinnis, Lochridge & Kilgore LLP and then working for the Biglaw firm Akin Gump.\n\nThe second period was from 1999, when Albright left the bench, to the present. In this period, the primary focus of Albright’s career has been on patent litigation, at the firms Thompson & Knight, Gray Cary, Fish & Richardson, and Bracewell & Giuliani (now Bracewell). Notably, Albright represented Overstock.com in defending against a patent infringement action, representing the website through a jury trial (the jury found for the defendants).[5]\n\nWhile Albright focused primarily on patent litigation , he occasionally handled other cases. Notably, Albright represented the Williamson County government in defending against a suit brought by Robert Lloyd, a conservative Republican who claimed that the County had improperly taken his political affiliation and his opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage into account in rejecting him for a Constable appointment.[6]\n\nJurisprudence\n\nAlbright served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas from 1992 to 1999. In this capacity, Albright presided over the pretrial aspects of approximately 1000 misdemeanor and civil cases and approximately 500 civil cases.[7] He also presided over around 15-20 civil cases by consent.[8] Among the more prominent cases Albright handled, he overturned a $275,000 jury verdict for a San Marcos plaintiff shot by a police officer on qualified immunity and official immunity grounds (his decision was affirmed on appeal).[9] In another notable case, Albright found for the parents of a daughter who suffered permanent injuries during birth due to the negligence of the doctor delivering the baby.[10]\n\nIn his seven years on the bench, Albright was reversed by the Fifth Circuit in four cases. In three of the reversals, the Fifth Circuit reversed plaintiff-friendly rulings by Albright.[11] In the fourth case, the Fifth Circuit reversed the grant of summary judgment to the defendant in a Lanham Act case.[12]\n\nPolitical Activity\n\nAlbright has been a frequent donor to Republican candidates. Cornyn was a particular beneficiary, having received approximately $5000 from Albright.[13] Albright also donated almost $5000 to Rudy Giuliani’s 2008 Presidential campaign.[14]\n\nAdditionally, Albright volunteered on the campaigns of several Texas politicians, including Republican Governor Bill Clements, and Democrats Bob Krueger and Henry Cisneros.[15]\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nCompared to other nominees from Texas who have incited more pushback, Albright is relatively uncontroversial. His long-time tenure as a patent litigator has allowed Albright to steer clear of controversial cases while maintaining the intellectual vigor needed for the bench. Additionally, supporters will argue Albright’s representation of Williamson County in defending against a discrimination suit brought by a conservative employee reflects an apolitical approach to the law.\n\nFurthermore, Albright’s record on the bench is relatively non-ideological. While Albright did overturn a jury verdict for a plaintiff against the cop who shot him, his ruling for the victims of medical negligence in a bench trial suggests that he is not biased against plaintiffs. Furthermore, most of his reversals from the Fifth Circuit have been from plaintiff-friendly rulings.\n\nOverall, these factors, combined with his age and experience, suggest that Albright will be considered a consensus nominee.\n\n[1] Sen.

Where Presidents make cross-party appointments, they are typically in deference to home-state senators of the opposite party, or as part of a package deal to confirm judges of their own party. One of the exceptions to this rule was the appointment of Judge Robert Junell, a Democratic state legislator in Texas, who was appointed to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas by President George W. Bush. Interestingly, President Trump’s nominee to fill the vacancy left by Junell could also qualify: U.S. Magistrate Judge David Counts.\n\nBackground\n\nWalter David Counts III was born in Knox City, TX in 1961, the son of Walter David Counts Jr. Counts attended Texas Tech University in Lubbock, graduating in 1983. In the summer of 1983, Counts worked as a Congressional Intern for former Democratic Rep. Jack Hightower.\n\nAfter college, Counts attended St. Mary’s University School of Law, graduating in 1986. Upon graduating, Counts joined the Austin firm Martin, Cox, Greenberg & Jones as an Associate Attorney. After a year there, Counts joined the Travis County District Attorney’s Office as an Assistant District Attorney. In 1990, Counts left to set up a solo practice in Austin, only to return to the District Attorney’s Office in 1991.\n\nIn 1995, Counts joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas. In 1999, Counts became Deputy Chief of Major Crimes in the Criminal Division. In 2009, Counts was appointed by the Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Texas to be a magistrate judge for the court. He currently serves in that position.\n\nOn March 15, 2016, Counts was nominated by President Obama to serve as a U.S. District Court judge. With the support of Republican Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, Counts received a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on September 7, 2016. However, despite the friendly hearing, Counts was never voted out of Committee and his nomination ended upon the conclusion of the Obama presidency.\n\nHistory of the Seat\n\nCounts has been nominated for a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. This seat opened on February 13, 2015, when Judge Robert Junell moved to senior status.[1] After extensive negotiations between President Obama and Senators Cornyn and Cruz, a package of five nominees to the Texas federal bench were announced on March 15, 2016.[2] The package included Counts’ nomination to the vacancy left by Junell. While the package of judges received a joint hearing on September 7, 2016, they were never voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nIn January 2017, Counts applied for the vacancy again to the Federal Judicial Evaluation Committee set up by Cornyn and Cruz. After interviews with the Committee and the White House Counsel’s Office, Counts was nominated for the vacancy on September 11, 2017.\n\nLegal Experience\n\nThere have been only two short periods of time in which Counts has not been either a prosecutor or a judge. First, after graduating from law school, Counts worked at Martin, Cox, Greenberg and Jones, a civil law firm based in Austin. In this position, which he only held for a year, Counts represented public health companies and nursing homes in regulatory proceedings. Second, from 1990-91, Counts maintained a solo practice, practicing criminal defense. Other than these two short periods, Counts spent his entire legal career before joining the bench in one of two positions: as a state prosecutor in Travis County; and as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas.\n\nTravis County District Attorney\n\nCounts worked in the Travis County District Attorney’s Office from 1987-1990 and 1991-1995. As a state prosecutor there, Counts worked primarily in violent felony cases, including sexual assault and murder. Counts notably prosecuted a convicted serial rapist who had assaulted and murdered young women after being released on parole.[3] Counts was able to successfully prosecute Mr. McDuff and obtain the death penalty, even while having to navigate the evidentiary obstacles of not having the victim’s body.[4]\n\nNotably, Counts also prosecuted Joel Rene Valdez on a rape charge.[5] Valdez presented an unusual defense: that the victim’s insistence that he wear a condom implied her consent.[6] Despite heavy media attention, Counts was able to obtain a conviction and a 40-year sentence against Valdez.[7]\n\nU.S. Attorney\n\nIn 1995, Counts became a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas. In this role, Counts prosecuted a variety of cases, including narcotics, firearms, immigration, white collar crime, and public corruption. Among the more notable matters he handled, Counts successfully prosecuted Frio County Treasurer for setting up schemes to steal funds from county and federal programs.[8] Counts also prosecuted two San Antonio City Council members for taking kickbacks from attorneys in exchange for city contracts.[9]\n\nJurisprudence\n\nCounts has served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge since 2009. In this capacity, Counts handles pretrial, grand jury, and discovery matters in criminal cases in the Midland/Odessa and Pecos Divisions of the Western District of Texas. Counts also handles civil trials with the consent of both parties.\n\nAmong his more notable trials, Counts presided over the jury trial of two oilfield workers who sought unpaid overtime wages under the Fair Labor Standards Att (FLSA).[10] After a jury verdict for the plaintiffs, Counts awarded them liquidated damages and attorney’s fees, denying the employer’s motions for a new trial.[11] On the criminal front, Counts presided over the guilty pleas of four prominent Midland and Odessa citizens who were charged with mortgage fraud, bank fraud, and money laundering.[12]\n\nIn his eight years on the bench, Counts has written hundreds of Reports and Recommendations for federal district judges. Of these, four have been partially rejected by the district judge.[13] Of these, the most notable is Counts’ opinion in Sherwood v. United States.[14] The case involved a habeas petition brought by a prisoner who argued that his right to self-representation during his trial was impeded.[15] While Counts recommended that the plaintiff receive relief for his petition, the district court rejected this recommendation of relief.[16]\n\nPolitical Activity\n\nCounts has no political donation history, although his father, W. David Counts Jr., served as in the Texas state legislature as a Democrat between 1988 and 2002.\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nGenerally speaking, nominees put forward by presidents of the opposite party (or presidents of both parties) fare well in the confirmation process. The same process is likely to hold up for Counts. Republicans are unlikely to object to Counts as he is the product of a recommendation process set up by Cornyn and Cruz, two conservative senators. Democrats are unlikely to object to Counts given his previous nomination by President Obama, his ties to a prominent Democratic officeholder, and his relatively moderate record.\n\nIf confirmed, one can expect Counts to have a similar record to that of the judge he replaces. Like Judge Robert Junell, Counts will likely be a center-right voice on the federal bench in Midland.\n\n[1] John Council, U.S. District Judge Rob Junell Hits Career Peak, Texas Lawyer, Feb. 12, 2015, http://www.texaslawyer.com/id=1202717806165/US-District-Judge-Rob-Junell-Hits-Career-Peak?slreturn=20170918151134.\n\n[2] Press Release, White House, President Obama Nominates Six to Serve on the United States District Courts (March 15, 2016) (on file at https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov).\n\n[3] See State v.
