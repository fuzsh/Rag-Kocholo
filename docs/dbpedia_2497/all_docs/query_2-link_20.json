        "text": "La Muerte is a major character in The Book of Life. She is the kind-hearted ruler/queen of the Land of the Remembered and the estranged wife of Xibalba (the Ruler/King of the Land of the Forgotten) who is an ancient immortal goddess of benevolence, kindness, generosity, purity, forgiveness, mercy, hope, love, passion, light and death.\n\nShe first entered the plot of the film when she and Xibalba made a bet concerning which of the two mortals, Manolo Sanchez or Joaquín Mondragon would marry María Posada.\n\nIn The Book of Life 2, the director said that they will look further in Xibalba and La Muerte's relationship.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nDespite being as old and ancient as time itself, La Muerte retains her vision of youth and radiant beauty where she is made entirely of white sugar candy with knee-length black licorice hair that is tied in a low ponytail with bangs split on either side and multi-colored glowing eyes with aqua eyeshadow that are in shades of gold and red.\n\nShe wears a red dress decorated with cempasuchil (Mexican marigold flowers) all over her dress and marigold flowers with lit white wax candles at the hem of her dress. She also wears an extremely large, wide-brimmed sombrero bedecked with more lit candles and marigolds (her favorite flower), small skulls, pink-plumed, curly, swirly feathers and palm leaves. She also wears a circular gold locket on a choker.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nLa Muerte is shown to be a largely kind and loving goddess, showing a deeply caring and welcoming attitude to almost everyone she meets. Considering that she is the ruler of the Land of the Remembered, she is also free-spirited and festive. It is believed that the kindness and love of mortal-kind stem from her own. La Muerte demonstrates her helpfulness in the movie to Manolo Sánchez to help him reunite with his love, María Posada. However, La Muerte is also shown to have a habit for bets and wagers, displaying her liking of gambling. She was even willing to risk swapping places with Xibalba which involved leaving the Land of the Remembered.\n\nShe is also a very benevolent, wise, sweet and compassionate ancient immortal goddess who believes humankind is completely and entirely true and pure and good. La Muerte is also very truly forgiving and easily forgives those who truly want to repent and truly want to redeem themselves for their sins and evil deeds. La Muerte is also passionate and full of love. La Muerte is also well known for her fondness and weakness for wagers and betting.\n\nDespite her kind and loving nature, La Muerte has also been shown (at least) to have an angry side as seen when she was infuriated after she discovered that Xibalba had cheated in the bet that costed her her kingdom. It is likely Xibalba is the only person La Muerte has ever been angered by (probably more than once), although she is still forgiving of most people in the end as shown when she reconciled with Xibalba towards the end of the movie.\n\nIn The Book of Life[]\n\nLa Muerte and her husband Xibalba have been estranged for over a thousand years. Due to having a previous bet in which Xibalba cheated, she rules the Land of the Remembered while he rules the bleak Land of the Forgotten. Upon arriving at San Ángel together to observe The Day of the Dead festivities, La Muerte remarks that Xibalba's heart has become as dark and cold as the land he now rules. The two have different ways of valuing human beings as showed when La Muerte stops Xibalba from 'taking' an old man's life. When Xibalba begs for her to trade lands with him, La Muerte playfully teases and scolds Xibalba reminding him that he is down there by his own doing. She also says that he \"is not the man [she] fell in love with all those centuries ago.\"\n\nHoping to distract his wife and make a play for the Land of the Living, Xibalba suggests they make another wager and La Muerte is enraged at first, but accepts the idea of a betting game. This leads them to finding Manolo Sánchez, Joaquín Mondragon and María Posada playing together. This leads to La Muerte choosing Manolo as her champion and blessing him to always have a good and pure heart. As part of the bet, La Muerte makes her husband promise not to interfere with the affairs of man should he lose the wager, to which Xibalba agrees and the wager is set.\n\nLa Muerte reappears on the day María returns to town at the bullfighting arena where she slaps Xibalba for staring at María and cheers for Manolo when he appears in the arena. She appears after the fight when Manolo sings and María hears his anguished song \"Creep\", observing that the mortal girl was moved by Manolo's words. La Muerte appears again when Manolo serenades a song called \"I Love You Too Much\" to Maria on her balcony.\n\nShe is not seen again until Manolo, his mother Carmen Sánchez and his grandfather Luis Sánchez reach the Land of the Forgotten to tell her that Xibalba cheated in their wager. Upon learning of this, La Muerte roars in anger and Xibalba appears, thinking his wife wishes to see him and reconcile. Instead, he sees Manolo and his relatives along with his infuriated wife. Learning about Xibalba's whole scheme involving the two-headed snake staff and the Medal of Everlasting Life, La Muerte, along with Carmen and Manolo, demand Xibalba to assist in bringing Manolo back to life. When he refuses, La Muerte tries to persuade him by calling him \"Balby\", but when he still refuses, she becomes angered until Manolo suggests the alternative of his own bet. Offering up the right to give the Land of the Forgotten to her husband, La Muerte convinces Xibalba to give Manolo a fair chance.\n\nLa Muerte watches as Manolo meets his worst fear in the bull arena and he is happy to see him emerge victorious, as is the Candle Maker, and, to some extent, Xibalba. The three of them then give Manolo his life back. Later, the three of them use their powers on The Day of the Dead to bring Manolo's deceased family back to help defend the town from Chakal and his army of bandits. After the town is saved and the Medal is returned, La Muerte and Xibalba reconcile on the top of the church.\n\nBack in the present day, the tour guide Mary Beth finishes her story and then leads the detention children back out to their bus. Waving goodbye and saying one of the names of the youngest girl, the guide reveals herself to have been La Muerte the entire time with the intention of teaching those children something about living and life.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nLa Muerte can travel disappearing and reappearing in nearby places, leaving a trail of flower petals.\n\nLa Muerte can transform in many forms such as Mary Beth and an old woman.\n\nLa Muerte can levitate.\n\nLa Muerte has telekinesis as she is able to pull Xibalba closer without actually touching him and she manages to retrieve the rest of Luis Sánchez's body with only a snap of her fingers at one point in the Land of the Forgotten.\n\nLa Muerte can generate and control fire.\n\nIn tandem with Xibalba (the King of the Land of the Forgotten) and Candle Maker (the Keeper of Balance), La Muerte can restore the dead back to life.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nXibalba[]\n\nXibalba is La Muerte's husband whom she has a complicated relationship with due to their different beliefs and the completely different, opposite antagonistic kingdoms, lands and realms they rule. They also have different perspectives on humankind; La Muerte believes that humankind is completely good, true and pure while Xibalba thinks and believes that humankind is selfish, greedy, sinful and concerned only in its own interest on the other hand. Despite their differences and occasional conflicts, the two complement each other very well and can’t live without each other.\n\nLa Muerte knows Xibalba well enough to know that he is not completely evil, so seeing him act in a petty and selfish way saddens her and disappoints her. But when he is able to put his pride aside and show genuine repentance for hurting her, she is more than willing to forgive him [4].\n\nWhen they are really on good terms, it is seen that they are very affectionate with each other. She's addicted to his charms and she knows that she is the only one who can change him. [5]\n\nCandle Maker[]\n\nIt is known that Candle Maker and La Muerte are good friends, although they have not seen that they interact much on screen. However, La Muerte is happy to see him when he appears in the Land of the Forgotten with Manolo Sánchez and two of his family; Carmen Sánchez and Luis Sánchez.\n\nNear the end, Candle Maker embraces both La Muerte and Xibalba where she is surprised at first, but then she smiles at him amiably.\n\nLa Noche[]\n\nLa Noche is La Muerte's twin sister [6], but that is the only thing known about their relationship so far.\n\nEtymology[]\n\nThe name La Muerte is Spanish for \"The Death\".\n\nThe La part of her name basically means \"the\".\n\nTrivia[]\n\nLa Muerte and Xibalba got back together when Xibalba finally apologized to La Muerte.\n\nLa Muerte's design is based heavily off of La Catrina Calavera, a political satire character created by José Guadalupe Posada.\n\nLa Muerte is called \"La Catrina\" in Latin America. This is because she is named after La Calavera Catrina in Mexican traditions.\n\nLa Muerte's body is made out of sweet sugar candy and her dress is made of Cherry fruit roll up [7].\n\nLa Muerte and Xibalba had many bets in between the time Manolo Sánchez, María Posada and Joaquín Mondragon were children until they were grown up. They mostly tied [8].\n\nLa Muerte and Xibalba met on earth at a party where both were pretending to be human [9].\n\nLa Muerte's necklace was a gift from Xibalba when they first met [10] and the accessory is a locket [11].\n\nThe candles on La Muerte's dress and sombrero are humans' lives that mean something to her [12].\n\nLa Muerte inherited the Land of the Remembered from her mother [13].\n\nLa Muerte has a close resemblance to \"Santa Muerte\", a Mexican Goddess that bring people a swift and just death and prevents violent and unworthy demise.\n\nThe candles atop of La Muerte's sombrero might be an indicator of her emotions as shown in the part where she shouted in fury when she realized Xibalba cheated once more and the flames of the candles enlarged and thus lighting the whole dark place of the Land of the Forgotten.\n\nLa Muerte is said to be a few centuries younger than her husband, Xibalba.\n\nLa Muerte had won a different wager before with Xibalba, although it wasn't fully depicted.\n\nXibalba had another nickname besides \"Mi Amor\" for La Muerte: Muertita [14].\n\nIn a concept art, La Muerte originally had with her a green snake that was part of Xibalba (like Más y Menos) [15].\n\nA quote from The Art of the Book of Life: “Her dress is red because it represents love, passion, and life. The only blue in her design is in her eyes, because she only has eyes for Xibalba\" [16].\n\nLa Muerte plays a non-speaking role in a flashback in Gutierrez's 2021 Netflix series, Maya and the Three. There, she is attending the wedding of Lord Mictlan (the God of War) and Lady Micte (the Goddess of Death). Lady Micte was revealed by Gutierrez in a Twitter post to be one of La Muerte’s sisters.\n\nCoincidentally, Lady Micte and La Muerte share the same voice actress (Kate del Castillo) and certain elements of design.\n\nDue to her relation to Lady Micte, this makes La Muerte Maya’s aunt by extension.\n\nLa Muerte's color motif is red, which represents love, passion and life.\n\nWhen La Muerte and Xibalba kiss at the very end of the movie, her hat and his black wings form The Sacred Heart (El Sagrado Corazón).\n\nGallery[]\n\nConcept art[]\n\nScreencaps[]\n\nMaya and the Three (miniseries)[]\n\nAnimations[]\n\nToys[]"
