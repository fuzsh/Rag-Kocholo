        "text": "In the 13th century, the Cathars, clerics who preached about life without material aspirations, were persecuted by the Catholic Church and expelled out of the Languedoc region in France. One of them, named Jean Raymond, found an old church in which to hide from crusaders, not knowing that beneath its ruins lay buried a greater danger.\n\nDescription\n\nL'Abbaye des Morts is an exploration platformer with the spirit of a ZX Spectrum computer game.\n\nFaith is your only weapon. Recover twelve Cathar crosses lost in an abandoned abbey and discover its dark secret while avoiding its many dangers. Black backgrounds, single color sprites and monophonic sounds are a proper fit for this unsettling story where things are left to the imagination.\n\nFacts\n\nThis little project was created at nights during a trip to the south of France. It was like a jam straight out of what we learned in the Languedoc.\n\nSome people consider it a cult game. Don' ask me why.\n\nIt was inspired by the tragic history of the Cathars and by ZX Spectrum games like Manic Miner, Jet Set Willy, Dynamite Dan…\n\nIts code was rewritten and open sourced by MoonWatcher. Since then it has been ported to many systems, including some I never heard about before.\n\nDaRkHoRaCe and Jerri created a version for actual ZX Spectrum computers that was produced by RetroWorks in cassette format."
