        "text": "The Good\n\nIt's a superbly well-written game -- easily the best written game I know of in the rpg genre, ranking with the best adventure games.\n\nThe central quest to \"know thyself\" is not unusual if you've played a lot of adventure games, but is unusual in the genre.\n\nCertain mini-quests are extremely memorable. The game starts you out in a mortuary and some of the things you do there are fascinating -- I especially like a moment where manipulating an item in your inventory gets you experience.\n\nDialog trees are not tough, exactly, but are often absorbing. It's possible to gain experience by taking the proper route with various characters, very neat.\n\nOne mini-quest, which requires you to die in order to continue, neatly subverts most rpg quest-like actions. There's also a mini-surprise here that really is eye-opening, regarding your relationship to one of the main npcs.\n\nExcellent voice acting and music, with some genuinely haunting moments.\n\nThe Bad\n\nI'm one of the eccentric few who find this game overrated.\n\nMuch has been made of the unique setting of the Planescape world, and that's true. That said, though, it's not that unusual. There's still wizards, thieves, priests, etc. Instead of healing potions there's blood clots, but they do the same sort of thing. You'll still see skeletons and zombies -- not quite as you have before, but they're there. Point is, much of the game can be seen as a one-to-one transfer: clots = solutions, charms = scrolls, etc.\n\nThe game is very well-written, and often plays like an adventure game. Frankly, it probably would have been more successful as an adventure game. The rpg blendings work well at the start, less well as time goes on. You're in trouble when the most interesting parts of an rpg are the conversations and puzzles, and the combat seems a slog.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the combat engine here is awful. You can pause, give orders to your party, then unpause and see how things turned out -- but your characters don't often behave as you'd have liked. Bad guys often swarm the weakest party, and it can be extremely frustrating to pull somebody out of harm's way to safety. Especially when they kind of ran off and did their own thing despite your wishes.\n\nThis wouldn't be a game killer for me, except that combat increases dramatically in the third quarter of the game, and it's exceptionally frustrating to play. This game was not suited to dungeon-crawl antics, and suffers when you have to do them.\n\nI in fact stopped near the end and never finished this (although I read a solution to see how it all turned out -- and the ending seems worthy of praise).\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis is an interesting attempt at an adventure-game/rpg hybrid. It works extremely well in it's first half, less so in the second. It's considered a classic by most gamers, and if you're an rpg fan you owe it to yourself to try it, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about. Like many hybrid games, though, I think the blending of genres points up the flaws of each -- it's a tribute to the makers that they can keep the plates spinning as long as they do, but eventually it does all coming crashing down. Despite it's worthy sections, I can't recommend it.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe Pros:\n\n* A non-linear storyline where every decision you make affects someone's life, whether it is a friend's, a foe's, your own, or even others.\n\n* Moral, but not preachy. Evil, yet understandably so. PS:T showcases every branch of the AD&D alignment scale somewhere, and excellently so. You may freely choose from Lawful Good to Chaotic Evil, and any way you choose, is the right way, demonstrating both the benefits and drawbacks of any viewpoint. Like both Arcanum and Fallout, your decisions truly become your own, and you have to live with the decisions you have made.\n\n* Unique teammates. Where else are you going to get from a wisecracking floating skull to a chaste succubus as your party?\n\n* Beautifully written plot. If you love to read, this game is definitely for you, as it is one of the most verbose games I have ever played (and that includes text adventures and IF games as well). In addition, it is truly a unique plot, with more well placed twists and turns than \"a maze of twisty little passages\".\n\n* Excellent voice acting. Including Jennifer Hale (of KotOR fame), Charlie Adler (Buster Bunny from Tiny Toons, Red Guy from Cow and Chicken, Fallout), John De Lancie (Q from Star Trek: The Next Generation), Sheena Easton (musician), Dan Castelleneta (The Simpsons), and Tony Jay (Fallout, inXile's The Bard's Tale, Shere Khan from Tail Spin), among others, there is a good number of excellent voice actors who deliver their lines superbly.\n\n*Unique environment. It is a step away from both Sci-Fi and Fantasy. It is a location all unto its own, taking place on the Outer Planes in the AD&D universe.\n\n* Ingenious puzzles. Some of them are simply mindboggling, yet entirely logical. Others are very simple, but brought to a whole new light.\n\n* Old-School quality. In this day and age of everything being First-Person perspective, Real-Time, (Massively) Multiplayer, and all-action/no-thought, it is an excellent game that embraces everything good about RPGs from 10-20 years ago.\n\nAll in all, it is an emotional rollercoaster ride, worthy of a top spot in any gamer's collection.\n\nThe Bad\n\nCons:\n\n* A little buggy. Make sure you patch your copy to fully enjoy the game.\n\n* Not enough voice acting. While the game is perfect as-is, it would've been an extra helping of icing on the cake to have more dialogue voiced-over.\n\nThere are very few things that make this game not worth playing.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nYou find yourself awakening on a slab in a morgue. You have no idea who you are, where you've been, why you're so scarred and tattooed, and why you can't seem to die. Your companion, a floating skull named Morte reads you a list of instructions tattooed on your back... and from there your adventure starts.\n\nPlanescape: Torment is a thinking man's RPG, where every problem has a solution- however, whether that solution involves running an errand, figuring out how something works, literally hoping and praying, or hacking and slashing everything in sight, is entirely up to you. Every situation you come across has a good number of ways to solve it, and every decision you make affects your character, as and the world around him.\n\nPS:T is based on the Planescape AD&D setting using 2nd Edition rules, using Real-Time-with-Pause combat, and begins in the town of Sigil. You can have a wide variety of companions, and there is a good number of places to visit.\n\nThere is one all-important question that requires an answer: \"What can change the nature of a man?\" Truly, the answer is Planescape: Torment. It will forever redefine what an RPG is to whomever plays it."
