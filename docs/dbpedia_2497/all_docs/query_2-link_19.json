        "text": "As games, particularly virtual worlds, become increasingly popular and as they begin to approximate large scale social systems in size and nature, they have also become spaces where play and learning have merged in fundamental ways. More important is the idea that the kind of learning that happens in the spaces of these massively multiplayer online games is fundamentally different than what we have come to consider as standard pedagogical practice. The distinction the authors make is that traditional paradigms of instruction have addressed learning as “learning about,” while these new forms of learning deal with knowl¬edge through the dynamic of “learning to be.” It is the authors’ contention that the experi¬ences offered within virtual worlds provide a fundamentally different way of thinking about learning that may provide some keys to the development of future pedagogical practice. Keywords: learning; World of Warcraft; conceptual blending; pedagogy; imagination\n\nThis dissertation addresses the social significance of parlour games as forms of cultural expression in medieval and early modern England and France by exploring how the convergence of textual materialities, players, and narratives manifested in interactive texts, board games, and playing cards. Medieval games, I argue, do not always fit neatly into traditional or modern theoretical game models, and modern blanket definitions of ‘game’—often stemming from the study of digital games—provide an anachronistic understanding of how medieval people imagined their games and game-worlds. Chapter 1 explores what the idea of ‘game’ meant for medieval authors, readers, and players in what I call ‘game-texts’—literary texts that blurred the modern boundaries between what we would consider ‘game’ and ‘literature’ and whose mechanics are often thought to be outside the definition of ‘game.’ Chapter 2 examines how recreational mathematics puzzles and chess problems penned in manuscript collections operate as sites of pleasure, edification, and meditative playspaces in different social contexts from the gentry households to clerical cloisters. The mechanics, layout, narrative, and compilation of chess problems rendered them useful for learning the art and skill of the game in England. Chapter 3 traces the circulation, manuscript contexts, and afterlives of two game-text genres in England—the demandes d’amour and the fortune-telling string games—in order to understand how they functioned as places of engagement and entertainment for poets, scribes, and players. Chapter 4 illustrates how narrative and geography became driving forces for the development and rise of the modern thematic game in Early Modern Europe. This chapter charts how changing ideas of spatiality enabled tabletop games to shift from abstract structures enjoyed by players in the Middle Ages, in which game narratives take place off a board, to ludic objects that incorporated real-life elements in their design of fictional worlds—thereby fashioning spaces that could visually accommodate narrative on the board itself. This dissertation places games into a more nuanced historical and cultural context, showing not only the varied methods by which medieval players enjoyed games but also how these ideas developed and changed over time.\n\nAs far as the use of computer games in the classroom, certain attempts have already been made. All of these attempts set α new context in how video games may be used for educational as well as entertaining purposes, but to some extent they lack of pedagogic and methodological theoretical basis. Our proposal is based upon a process by the end of which learners would have acquired the cognitive skills viewed as the fundamental objectives of the curriculum of studies through processes of playing and fun while engaging into something that meets their specific needs. Description of the project Playing games is an important part of our social and mental development. The advent of personal computers with superior graphics systems has precipitated an explosion in game software. Hence, it has become increasingly important for game developers and educators to study the application of computers for enhancing the education offered to the next generation of students. In the current research, which constitutes the second part of our pilot study, we approach the video games implementation aspect by narrowing the range of courses of the Syllabus for Greek Primary Education used throughout the research and focusing upon the course of Language Arts, taking at the same time advantage of the fact that new instructional material is introduced throughout the Greek continent by September 2006.\n\nThis study aims at discussing how the discursive genre theory (BAKHTIN, 1992; DOLZ; SCHNEUWLY, 2004) contributes to the understanding of how video games can foster English language learning. Persona 4: Golden, the video game chosen for this study, was analyzed through Dolz and Schneuwly 's (2004), namely: action capacities; linguistic capacities; linguistic-discursive capacities. The analysis shows that the first six hours of gameplay of the aforementioned object of study present a wide array of text genres that simulate texts found in the real world, engaging players in authentic practices that stimulate language learning. Moreover, as the understanding of language is a prerequisite to move forward in the game, motivation is a key factor in P4G. Lastly, since the game used in this study is also present in other media, players might engage in gaming culture."
