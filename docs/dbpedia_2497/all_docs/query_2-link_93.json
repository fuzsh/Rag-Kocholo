        "text": "Police capture 'The Professor' in Netflix show Money Heist\n\nMoney Heist, known as La Casa de Papel in Spain (the direct translation is ‘House of Paper’, but that would have probably been too close to another Netflix original show), is the most-watched show not in the English language on the streaming service.\n\nIt tells the story of a group of undesirables who come together to rob the Royal Mint of Spain and print €2.4 billion.\n\nThis heist is the brain-child of a man who goes by the mysterious name of El Professor, played by Alvaro Morte.\n\nMorte opened up about how he felt when he learnt that La Casa de Papel had been renewed by Netflix for a third season.\n\n“(When I thought it was over) there was this feeling of grieving because of my connection with my character,” he told the Press Association.\n\n“I think it’s something that happened to all of us.\n\n“The connection to my character was like if you have a twin brother and you play at interchanging your personalities. It was that kind of connection and suddenly one day, goodbye, you’re not going to see him any more for the rest of your life.\n\n“It was very sad. There was plenty of joy in the way we think we have done it the best that we could.\n\n“We are happy with the result but it was like a sour-sweet feeling that now it’s finished and we are not going to be Tokyo and The Professor.\n\n“I remember the call (to say we were getting a third series), I was on a train from Madrid to Barcelona and there was not good signal. I could not scream out my happiness, I was so excited, we are so happy.”\n\nThe show has been a huge hit around the world, and this came as an unexpected surprise for Morte.\n\n“People say ‘Have you seen this?’ There is a guy in Brazil who has tattooed my face on his body. Crazy things.\n\n“It’s very nice because people love your work, a work that you have made with a lot of love, a love that is going and coming back. It’s a circle, it’s a beautiful thing.”\n\nMorte’s co-star, Ursula Corbero, who plays Tokyo on the show revealed that she cried when she learnt that the show was getting a third season.\n\n“I got a call saying it was happening and I was like ‘No, no, and just started crying’,” she said.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
