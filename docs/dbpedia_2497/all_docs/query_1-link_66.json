        "text": "Planescape: Torment is a 1999 computer role-playing game (CRPG) which takes place in the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Planescape campaign setting. It differs from similar CRPGs by placing an emphasis on conversation and storyline, as opposed to an emphasis on combat.\n\nThe Nameless One\n\n[edit]\n\n(After hearing Morte read the tattoos on his back) No wonder my back hurts; there's a damn novel written on it.\n\nUpdated my journal. (Quest log update)\n\nUm... has anyone seen a floating sarcastic skull around here?\n\nStow it, Morte.\n\nAnother comment like that, and you'll be wearing your ass as a hat.\n\nI wonder what it was I said that made Death reject me.\n\nOne foot in the grave, the other in Hell.\n\nNo good comes of evil roots, I fear.\n\nIt insults the dead when you treat life carelessly.\n\nIf there is anything I have learned in my travels across the Planes, it is that many things may change the nature of a man. Whether regret, or love, or revenge or fear - whatever you believe can change the nature of a man, can. I’ve seen belief move cities, make men stave off death, and turn an evil hag's heart half-circle. This entire Fortress has been constructed from belief. Belief damned a woman, whose heart clung to the hope that another loved her when he did not. Once, it made a man seek immortality and achieve it. And it has made a posturing spirit think it is something more than a part of me.\n\nI HAVE COMMITTED MANY CRIMES ACROSS MANY LIFETIMES. I GO NOW TO A PLACE OF PUNISHMENT. YOU CANNOT COME WITH ME.\n\nFear names. Names have power in identity. Others can use names as weapons. Names are a hook that can be used to track you across the planes. Remain nameless, and you shall be safe. I am the Nameless One.\n\nYou have been divided. You are one of many men. You bear many names, and each has left their scars on your flesh.\n\nWhat little life there is in the world is draining out this hole in my body. The world can burn, the planes can burn, just give me life! I will destroy this life so badly, break it, smash it, and stain it in blood and feces, so you cannot live it either! Let all creation burn for I cannot die!\n\nI suspect that we will continue to die and be reborn until we finally get our life right. I do not know what we have to do to bring that about, though. And therein lies the frustration.\n\nAt what point does the I get separated from the we? At what point am I freed of the shackles of the actions of these other incarnations? At what point am I allowed to be me, without the weight of these past lives?\n\nDak'kon\n\n[edit]\n\nHail, traveler. Your eyes have the weight of someone who has traveled far to be in this place.\n\nYour reasons for your incessant clicking are not known to me.\n\nStrength lies in knowing oneself.\n\nI may be bested in battle, but I shall never be defeated.\n\nEndure. In enduring, grow strong.\n\nThere cannot be two skies!\n\nIt was known to me that you would return; is it your will that our two paths be one?\n\nSteel marks flesh, but flesh cannot mark steel.\n\nA divided mind is an unfocused mind. A divided mind fractures walls and weakens stone. Many divided minds may destroy a city.\n\nAll things, whether structure or flesh — their existence is defined by their knowing of themselves.\n\nWhen a mind does not know itself, it is flawed. When a mind is flawed, the man is flawed. When a man is flawed, that which he touches is flawed. It is said that what a flawed man sees, his hands make broken.\n\nThe city [Sigil] exists in opposition to itself. It has set itself apart from the planes, yet it seeks to be everywhere at once. Its walls are doors, yet it keeps these doors locked. Such an existence tells of a thing that does not know itself. In not knowing itself, it is flawed.\n\nYour path is mine.\n\nKnow that when death comes for you, know that I shall meet its blade with mine. Know that when all dies around you, know I shall live for your sake.\n\nI have been here before. This time I shall never leave.\n\nBalance in All Things.\n\nIn knowing the teachings of Zerthimon, I have become stronger. [Level up]\n\nAs I fell from the walls of Shra'kt'lor, know that my self was broken. My blade was mist, my mind divided. I was adrift upon Limbo’s seas, and I wished to drown. I died for days, my mind awash in division, when death finally came to me. It wore your skin, and it had your voice.\n\nAnnah\n\n[edit]\n\nLooks like the Dusties lost one of their deaders! (upon first seeing the Nameless One)\n\nPike off.\n\nYeh ever get the feeling yeh're bein' watched? Yeh are.\n\nIf yeh keep bobbin' about, skull, I'll mount yeh on the end of a pike!\n\nYeh like me wee tail? I could wag it for yeh.\n\nGet yer eyes off my arse!\n\nAye, now what yeh be wantin' to know about me for? Are yeh jest bored? It's not some grand tale, it isn't, so if yeh're expecting some epic yeh'd best go rattle yer bone-box at someone else, jig?\n\nFeelin' for others'll just get yeh stabbed in places that don't heal.\n\nA trinket won't save yeh from fate's hand. If the stains on yer soul are black enough, no amount o' washing will get 'em out.\n\nFall-From-Grace\n\n[edit]\n\nI'm afraid that if you were to remove that... I would be naked. [When trying to remove her bodice]\n\nI must confess that Nordom is the cutest little rogue modron I've ever encountered!\n\nA ring without a proposal? How improper! [When given a left ring]\n\nOh! Does this mean we are engaged? [When given a right ring]\n\nSimple minds, simple pleasures... [When being clicked repeatedly]\n\nTime is not your enemy. Forever is.\n\nSo, you are the spider that lies in the center of it all.\n\nMy heart is neither black nor do I fear for my life.\n\nI believe there is a truth to the multiverse... even if that truth is that there is no truth at all. I believe that the Planes are meant to be experienced, and the more one experiences, in traveling, in joy, in pain, in merriment or in suffering, the more the multiverse reveals itself to you... And the more you are revealed to yourself.\n\nMorte\n\n[edit]\n\nHey Chief, you okay? You playin' corpse or you puttin' the blinds on the Dusties? I thought you were a deader for sure.\n\nI'm Morte. Like Latin... for Death.\n\nI am both happy and completely miserable, without the happy part!\n\nI know more than you, you staggering, guttural amnesiac! ‘Sides, here’s three more bits of knowledge to rattle around in that empty brain-box of yours: one, there are NO experts on the Planes, two, I'm the closest thing to one you’re going to find, and three, treat me with some respect. Why? See the second reason.\n\nWomen were the reason I became a monk - and, ah, the reason I switched back...\n\nWhat's eatin' you Chief?\n\nWe should get some female zombies to join our party, right Chief?\n\nCome on! Let's shake a leg... I mean - YOU shake a leg...\n\nOh sure. I'll just... swing it with my arms! [When trying to equip him with a weapon other than teeth]\n\nUnless you've suddenly become a dentist, hands off! [When trying to take his teeth]\n\nYou know, if I could click you, you wouldn’t know a moment’s peace!\n\nFlies wouldn't even land on your carcass! [Litany of Curses]\n\nYou have a face only sledgehammer could love... AND HAS! [Litany of Curses]\n\nGraaaace... you wanna put ME in your inventory?\n\nGraaaace... I need your sensory touch!\n\nYou know, it wouldn't kill you to say a few words to me, fiendling... or hug me... or KISS me! [To Annah]\n\nChief, we're being followed! Just look natural - uh... casual.\n\nThis place is locked up tighter than a chastity belt!\n\nI-I feel like I'm in a cuckoo clock...a cuckoo-cuckoo clock! [In the Modron Maze]\n\nThis is the worst place we could be in Sigil at the worst possible time.\n\nI'd just like to interject here and point out that I'm not going to say anything to spoil the mood, chief. I'll just float here and watch. Don't mind me, just sitting here, floating and watching, that's me. [Interjecting a moment between Annah and the Nameless One]\n\nAlas, poor Dak'kon, I knew him well. [When Dak'kon dies]\n\nHow many times must this fool die? [When the Nameless One dies]\n\nTalk about beatin' a dead horse! [When the Nameless One dies]\n\nLooks like that beauty sleep didn't help YOU any! [When the Nameless One dies]\n\nWell, looks like another trip to the Mortuary... [When the Nameless One dies]\n\n(When told by a philosopher that life does not end in death, but that one merely embarks on a new life)\n\nAnd that's supposed to be an incentive? We get to do this all *again*? Gee, I can't wait to be a floating skull all over again. Whee! Pike him. What a tard. Spoken just like someone who hasn't died before, huh?\n\nNordom\n\n[edit]\n\nNot sorries. Null sorries. Gratitudes! Indentification of self comprosized by doubtings + mullings + analysis.\n\nReal-eye-zation reached: Nordom null know name of addressee. Indemify yourself.\n\nAbsence of Name = Absence of Identity = Absence of Purpose = Absence of Place in Multiverse = Null State = Loss. Nordom existed in State, Null, until Subject (Unidentified, Nameless) attached identity to Nordom. Null Identity, Null Purpose, Null Place equates to ‘Loss.’\n\nQuery: May these ones join you on your gurney?\n\nI think, therefore I am... I think.\n\nSense of closure imminent.\n\nI'm a little modron, short and stout.\n\nThe issue no longer equals total logic.\n\nDefine/Query: Mechanus. Plane of Order. Sense. Cause generates Effect. Predictable. Law. Logic. Regimented. Obedience. Gears turn.\n\nNordom and crossbows wish to go in search for trouble!\n\nI sleep in a drawer.\n\nSaid desire will begin immediately.\n\nI estimate that Fall-from-Grace would be 51% more effective as a modron. Give or take 5.2%.\n\nI estimate Fall-from-Grace to be found attractive by the male sex of over 321423 separate species. Give or take 5.\n\nDeionarra\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is what my eyes see, my Love, unfettered by the shackles of time… You shall meet enemies three, but none more dangerous than yourself in your full glory. They are shades of evil, of good, and of neutrality given life and twisted by the laws of the planes. You shall come to a prison built of regrets and sorrow, where the shadows themselves have gone mad. There you will be asked to make a terrible sacrifice, my Love. For the matter to be laid to rest, you must destroy that which keeps you alive and be immortal no longer.\n\nYou must die... While you still can. The circle must come to a close my love.\n\nI shall wait for you in Death's Halls my love...\n\nTouch my hand, and the walls of this Fortress shall be walls no more.\n\nRavel Puzzlewell\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is no room for \"2\" in the world of 1's and 0's, no place for \"mayhap\" in a house of trues and falses, and no \"green with envy\" in a black-and-white world.\n\nLead is not easily a-changed to gold, but it is possible, thought the unwise... un-whys? ...Ravel. If water can be drawn from blood, mortality can be taken from a mortal, peeled back like a sticky film....\n\nThe past is past, and histories care little for a-speaking the truth of it.\n\nAll people love themselves too much to be changed by something as simple as love.\n\nI am but a woman who has sorely... soarly? Soarly missed her beloved creation. Some have named me crone, gray lady, Yaga sister, night hag -- but MYSELF is my name, Ravel, Ravel who puzzles well, providing conundrums to decipher and laying impossibilities low.\n\nI have forgotten more of the Art than you shall... EVER... KNOW.\n\nIt is a cruel, jagged world beyond the edges of this maze, and Ravel has pulled enough of its shards from her skin.\n\nYou have forgotten your PLACE, HALF-man. Humility is in order.\n\nThe *tiefling*. The FIERY one. No choice. At. All. When you *feel* instead of *think*, there is little room for choice.\n\nA thousand deaths, and you recover from each. Not so the mind, the mind is much more fragile. Its scars run deep and do not heal. The brain is encased in a hard bone shell, difficult to breach, but with no defense against that which eats at it from within.\n\n*Rattle-rattle* goes the hollow man, a baby's plaything, with naught but a tiny stone that a-clatters and clacks in your frame.\n\nWhat can change the nature of a man?\n\nThe question is also asked by others in the game, but was originally asked by Ravel.\n\nCoaxmetal\n\n[edit]\n\nSTART WITH A FRAGMENT OF THE ENEMY. A DROP OF BLOOD. A CRYSTALLIZED THOUGHT. ONE OF THEIR HOPES. ALL OF THESE THINGS TELL THE WAY IT CAN DIE.\n\nMETAL IS LIKE FLESH. BOTH CARRY POTENTIAL IN THEIR VEINS. WHEN TEMPERED WITH HEAT AND PRESSURE, THE POTENTIAL SURFACES.\n\nENTROPY HAS UNMADE THEM.\n\nIMMORTALITY IS ONLY A WORD. ALL THAT EXISTS CAN DIE. EVERY LIVING THING HAS A WEAPON AGAINST WHICH IT HAS NO DEFENSE. TIME. DISEASE. IRON. GUILT.\n\nI AM IRON GIVEN PURPOSE. I FORGE THE WEAPONS BY WHICH THE MULTIVERSE WILL BE UNMADE.\n\nTHE MULTIVERSE BREATHES. IT GROWS. IT STAGNATES. IT FORGES ITS CHAINS AROUND THE PLANES LINK BY LINK. IN TIME, EVEN ENTROPY MAY BE CHAINED.\n\nWHEN A THING SEALS ITSELF AGAINST ITS OWN DESTRUCTION, IT MERELY DIES A DIFFERENT DEATH.\n\nIF THE ENEMY DOES NOT WISH TO CONFRONT YOU DIRECTLY, DENY ITS WISH. TAKE THE BATTLE TO THE ENEMY. IF IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO CONFRONT YOU DIRECTLY, FIND THE REASON. THE REASON WILL REVEAL A WEAKNESS.\n\nALL THINGS HAVE A COMMON GROUND IN DECAY. WAR IS NECESSARY. DEATH IS NECESSARY. DECAY IS NECESSARY.\n\nTHERE ARE NO LIMITS. LIMITS ARE ONE OF THE LINKS IN THE CHAIN OF ORDER. LIMITS MUST BE SHATTERED.\n\nALL MUST FALL UPON ENTROPY'S BLADE. THE TIME NEARS WHEN IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO BREACH THE WALLS OF CREATION. ORDER WILL BE PUT TO THE SWORD. ITS CHAINS WILL BE BROKEN. THE MULTIVERSE WILL BE UNMADE.\n\nIgnus\n\n[edit]\n\nYesss, Long have I slept, dreams of flamesss. I am yoursss till death comesss for usss both!\n\nIgnus hears you.\n\nWhat do you wish of Ignus?\n\nIgnus wishes to BURN.\n\nWhen the Planessss burnnnn and all life is but torchesss, then Ignusss ssshall at lassst... be at peace.\n\nRI-KA-SHA!\n\nOne day, Ignus will kill you all.\n\nYou are naught but tallow for my flamessssss...\n\nVhailor\n\n[edit]\n\nI have AWAKENED. I am VHAILOR.\n\nI am Vhailor. I am a Mercykiller. I am justice. It is my past. It is my present. It is my future.\n\nMercy is for the weak. Punishment breaks souls and makes them worthy of service to their superiors. When the number of martyrs is great enough, rebellion crumbles.\n\nThere is only one truth in the multiverse. The multiverse shall be sharpened upon the blade of justice. With justice as its whetstone, the multiverse shall achieve perfection.\n\nAll who are guilty shall be punished. I shall not rest until the sentences of the condemned have been carried out.\n\nKnow the eye of the Mercykillers WATCH you!\n\nJustice is not blind... for I am Her eyes!\n\nMercy is a shield used by the weak!\n\nWhile we await, mercy and evil seep into the hearts of more victims!\n\nYou will not escape my axe again!\n\nYour crimes cry out for justice!\n\nPerfection through punishment.\n\nLet my words carry you: JUSTICE is a TEACHER. In your PUNISHMENT, gain STRENGTH. Through your PUNISHMENT, achieve PERFECTION.\n\nHe no longer LIVES. He only EXISTS. It is not the SAME. (when speaking of Ignus)\n\nJUSTICE shall be served. You shall FALL beneath my blade, immortal, even if I have to stand over your struggling remains for ETERNITY. (when he discovers the true identity of The Nameless One)\n\nTrias the Betrayer\n\n[edit]\n\nA Man's mortality is a compass that points his way in life.\n\nI will not be judged by you mortal; not when you have lived the lives you have. Let me tell you of Betrayal: betrayal is cowardice... selling weapons to your adversaries out of fear that they might stop killing each other and turn upon you. Betrayal is refusing to lead by example. Betrayal is letting the Fiends run rampant through the Planes until evil has corrupted all hearts.\n\nHow is it that you believe that you have earned the right to any truths in this life or the next? Such arrogance.\n\nThere are many definitions of betrayal. One must live long enough to experience them all. Even your life, were it not fraught with forgetfulness, does not have the range of centuries necessary to appreciate them. Such a betrayal is no betrayal at all.\n\nAll the balefire and hate in all the hells can not compare with the wrath of a father's anger.\n\nWhat is it you wish of me, mortal? Speak your mind and leave me to my memories of paradise.\n\nWhy are you so surprised? You have wandered in great circles across the planes in these countless lives you have lived. Such symmetry. Such futility. Go now, back to where it began. Go back, and die.\n\nI curse you to lives without meaning. May you suffer in your perpetual pain-filled shell and never hold on to the memories of the pleasure of light and love. What little of your humanity remains shall be the death of you, mortal.\n\nThe Pillar Of Skulls\n\n[edit]\n\nMeaning and death is what you seek... Two separate things they are for a normal man. But for you... one and the same.\n\nThe Transcendent One\n\n[edit]\n\nTHE WEAK SUFFER. I ENDURE.\n\nI AM THAT WHICH WALKS WITH ALL LIFE. MY VOICE IS A DEATH RATTLE, A LAST BREATH IN THE THROAT, THE WHISPER OF A DYING MAN.\n\nYOU ARE UNWELCOME HERE, BROKEN ONE.\n\nI SHALL BREAK YOU A THOUSAND TIMES, THEN BUILD YOU ANEW... SO THAT YOU MIGHT DIE ANOTHER DEATH.\n\nI WILL SHATTER EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY, RESET THEM INTO PAINFUL ANGLES, THEN LET YOUR FLESH HEAL AGAIN. YOU SHALL BE MY... TOY.\n\nI CAN FORGE PLANES WITH MY POWER! I CAN UNMAKE YOU!\n\nSO YOU HAVE COME. THEN YOU SHALL DIE AGAIN.\n\nARE THEY DEAD? YES. UNLIKE YOU THEY HAVE BUT ONE LIFE... AND THEY WASTED IT FOR YOUR SAKE.\n\nNO. THAT IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE. I HAVE ENDED THE LIVES OF ALL WHO HAVE GUIDED YOU TO THIS PLACE. THE NIGHT HAG THAT CURSED US. THE ANGEL WHO SHIELDS HIMSELF WITH GOLDEN LIES. SOON THE FIEND WHO AIDED YOU WILL DIE ASWELL, YOU'VE LED ME TO ALL OF THEM! YOU HAVE ALLOWED ME TO HIDE MY PRESENCE. FOREVER.\n\nTHERE IS NO ONE LEFT IN ALL OF EXISTENCE WHO CAN TELL YOU HOW TO REACH ME. THIS SHALL BE THE LAST TIME YOU TRESPASS IN THESE HALLS.\n\nASK YOUR QUESTIONS. BUT KNOW YOU SHALL NEVER REMEMBER THE ANSWERS.\n\nA NAME IS A CLOAK OF LETTERS THROWN UPON A MAN. IT MEANS NOTHING.\n\nTHEN THIS IS MY ANSWER AND YOU ARE THE PROOF: NOTHING CAN CHANGE THE NATURE OF A MAN.\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nYou truly know very little, about very little. Have you bashed your head against every rock that has fallen from the Mountain of Ignorance?\n\nLothar, Master of the Bones\n\nI'll bet ye've got all sorts o' barmy questions! (She mimics your heroic stance) Greetin's, I have some questions... can ye tell me about this place? Who's the Lady o' Pain? I'm lookin' fer the magic Girdle of Swank Iron, have ye seen it? Do ye know where a portal ta the 2,817th Plane o' the Abyss might be? Do ye know where the Holy Flamin' Frost-Brand Gronk-Slayin' Vorpal Hammer o' Woundin' an' Returnin' an' Shootin'-Lightnin'-Out-Yer-Bum is?\n\nElderly Hive Dweller\n\nThey do not possess the true fire. They speak of creation and they boast of their potential but they do not create anything beyond the mundane. Their imagination is poor, obsessed with the small details. A true Dreamer, I say, creates a grand scheme and then concentrates on the details. Starting with the details is for the ants of the imagination - the small insects who aspire only to be fed.\n\nNihl Xander, Godsmen Engineer\n\nThen you are blessed, blessed. Remain nameless, and you shall be as a spirit on the planes, untraceable, untrackable, unseen, undiscovered... A name chosen, a name given... it allows others to find you and hurt you.\n\nReekwind\n\nYou are silvered glass that has cracked and the pieces scattered across history.\n\nDodecahedron\n\nYou mortals are like wasps. You build your lives/nests from the slimmest of branches, and when the wind shakes your home/life free, you seek to sting the wind to death. Instead of realizing your foolish mistakes, attempting to repair the damage you have caused yourselves, and learning from your experience, you bring harm to any who have the misfortune to blunder near you in your time of pain and distress. My advice to you - and to all mortals: Stop acting like an insect and start acting sentient.\n\nO, of divine alphabet\n\nI've done my share and I've come to regret it. Now... If I could give you a free piece of advice it would be: Whatever you do in life, make sure you can forgive yourself.\n\nHarlot\n\nUnbroken Circle of Zerthimon\n\n[edit]\n\nKnow that we are the First People. Once all was chaos. The First People were thought drawn from chaos. When the First People came to know themselves, they were chaos no longer, and became flesh.\n\nThe first line of the Unbroken Circle.\n\nKnow that flesh cannot mark steel. Know that steel may mark flesh. In knowing this, Zerthimon became free.\n\nThe first line of the second circle.\n\nA divided mind is one that does not know itself. When it is divided, it cleaves the body in two. When one has a single purpose, the body is strengthened. In knowing the self, grow strong.\n\nThe final line of the Unbroken Circle.\n\nStrength lies in knowing oneself. I learned that once someone does not know themselves, they are lost. They become a tool for others.\n\nThe Nameless One, reflecting on the lesson of the first circle.\n\nI learned that not knowing something can be a tool, just like flesh and steel, if upon encountering it, you attempt to know its nature and how it came to be.\n\nThe Nameless One, reflecting on the lesson of the second circle.\n\nEndure. In enduring, grow strong.\n\nThe Nameless One, reflecting on the lesson of the third circle.\n\nWhen one chooses to see only what is before them, they see only a part of the whole. They are blind. And just as Vilquar was blinded by his promised reward, so were the *illithids* blinded to the true Rising. For when they heard Vilquar's words, they turned their sight outwards again, didn't they? And the Rising was free to strike?\n\nThe Nameless One, reflecting on the lesson of the fourth circle.\n\nThere is great strength in numbers, but there is great power in one, for the strength of the will of one may gather numbers to it. There is strength not only in knowing the self, but knowing how to bring it forth in others.\n\nThe Nameless One, reflecting on the lesson of the fifth circle.\n\nI know that Zerthimon's devotion to the People was such that he was willing to protect them from themselves. He knew the *illithids* had come not to know themselves in their obsession with control and domination. So he chose to stop Gith before she carried the People to their deaths. There must be balance in all things, or else the self will not hold.\n\nThe Nameless One, reflecting on the lesson of the sixth circle.\n\nIt speaks of time as an ally, not as an enemy. It says that patience can sharpen even the smallest of efforts into a weapon that can strike the heart of an empire. Your victories may be small, but over time, a greater victory may be achieved.\n\nThe Nameless One, reflecting on the lesson of the seventh circle.\n\nIt speaks of focus and discipline... about how not knowing oneself can physically divide the man. It also speaks of the weaknesses that division causes. It seems to me that it tells one to not only know themselves and take strength from that, but that your focus can reveal weaknesses in your enemy.\n\nThe Nameless One, reflecting on the lesson of the eighth circle.\n\nNarrator\n\n[edit]\n\n(on the opening of the Bronze Sphere) The sphere wrinkles in your hands, the skin of the sphere peeling away into tears and turning into a rain of bronze that encircles you. Each droplet, each fragment that enters you, you feel a new memory stirring, a lost love, a forgotten pain, an ache of loss - and with it, comes the great pressure of regret, regret of careless actions, the regret of suffering, regret of war, regret of death, and you feel your mind begin buckling from the pressure - so MUCH, all at once, so much damage done to others... so much so an entire FORTRESS may be built from such pain. And suddenly, through the torrent of regrets, you feel the first incarnation again. His hand, invisible and weightless, is upon your shoulder, steadying you. He doesn't speak, but with his touch, you suddenly remember your name. ...and it is such a simple thing, not at all what you thought it might be, and you feel yourself suddenly comforted. In knowing your name, your true name, you know that you have gained back perhaps the most important part of yourself. In knowing your name, you know yourself, and you know, now, there is very little you cannot do.\n\nConversations\n\n[edit]\n\nNordom: Attention, Morte. I have a question: do you have a destiny... a purpose?\n\nMorte: Is Annah still wearing clothes?\n\nNordom: Affirmatory.\n\nMorte: Then, the answer is yes.\n\nNordom: Attention, Fall-From-Grace. I wish to address your body.\n\nFall-From-Grace: I beg your pardon?\n\nNordom: Your body. Your form. Your reason for selecting it. Why?\n\nFall-From-Grace: Why..? I suppose I find it comforting. Besides, I rather like the wings.\n\nNordom: It would be more practical for you to assume the form of a modron. It is 13.27% more efficient; give or take +5.2%.\n\nFall-From-Grace: (gently flirting) Why, Nordom... are you trying to court me?\n\nNordom: It was not my intention to initiate legal action against you.\n\nNordom: (sharing his story with Yves) In the 13.7 Revolution, we were required to fix gear and cog subset 31 in the fifth ring of Mechanus. We removed the obstruction and the gear turned as per its normal speed. Upon completing our task, we were then returned to the Source.\n\nMorte: What in the Hells was that, you stupid polygon?! That's the most boring story I ever heard!\n\nNordom: It was what took place. With embellishments, of course.\n\nMorte: Embellishments?\n\nNordom: I thought the return to Source was a particularly fitting image to close the tale.\n\nFall-from-Grace: Morte, with a vocabulary like yours, you should spend some time at the brothel...\n\nMorte: Hohoho! The gods are merciful!\n\nFall-from-Grace: Morte, I'm curious... what happened to your body?\n\nMorte: It's a long story involving the Head of Vecna. I don't want to talk about it.\n\nFall-from-Grace: (Laughing) That was you?\n\nMorte: Could we *please* change the subject?\n\nThe Nameless One: Can you speak?\n\nEcco: [She shakes her head at you and smiles sadly]\n\nMorte: I love this chit already!\n\nFall-From-Grace: Morte, what are you again? I don't believe you ever said.\n\nMorte: Me? I'm *le petit Morte*.\n\nNordom: Attention, Morte. Did you know I have six sides?\n\nMorte: (sarcastic) I noticed. Why don't you go and share your insight with the Chief, huh?\n\nNordom: Annah, does your tail assist you in maintaining your balance?\n\nAnnah: (sarcastic) No, it's fer scratchin' me back, yeh soddin' box!\n\nNordom: Yes... that is quite logical.\n\nAnnah: (sighs)\n\nHive Dweller: (Referring to Morte) Oh, look! A floating skull!\n\nMorte: Oh, look! A talking turd!\n\nFall-From-Grace: Your mastery of discipline is impressive Dak'kon.\n\nDak'kon: In the eyes of Zerthimon, I am nothing.\n\nFall-From-Grace: Surely, you are being too harsh on yourself?\n\nDak'kon: A long road must I still travel. This... is but the beginning.\n\nRavel Puzzlewell: Life swallowed you and spit you out!\n\nMorte: It swallowed him, but I don't know if he came out of THAT end!\n\nThe Nameless One: Where can I find this angel?\n\nRavel Puzzlewell: In a-leaving this prison, to another cursed prison will you arrive... though it may not appear as such to casual glances. Step a-lightly, and find the golden link in the ever-shortening chain. The light shall give the dark of the matter, and new paths shall open to you.\n\nThe Nameless One: Delightfully cryptic... though not surprising. Thanks.\n\nVhailor: When the injustice is great enough, Justice will lend me the strength needed to correct it. None may stand against it. It will shatter every barrier, sunder any shield, tear through any enchantment and lend its servant the power to pass sentence. Know this: there is nothing on all the Planes that can stay the hand of justice when it is brought against them. It may unmake armies. It may sunder the thrones of gods. Know that for ALL who betray Justice, I am their fate... and fate carries an Executioner's Axe.\n\nThe Nameless One: I see.\n\nVhailor: No, you do NOT see. Pray you NEVER will.\n\nNordom: Plane: Negative Material. Location: Fortress of Regrets.\n\nThe Transcendent One: (entering scene) AH... THE ROGUE CONSTRUCT.\n\nNordom: Sense of closure: imminent.\n\nThe Transcendent One: SUBMIT.\n\nNordom: You intend to harm one who has aided Nordom at cost to himself. Nordom will attempt to stop you. Prospect of success: slight.\n\nThe Transcendent One: (casting) THE BODY IS A SHELL. INTENSE PRESSURE MAY FRACTURE IT. SHALL I CONTINUE?\n\nNordom: You intend to harm him. Nordom will stop you.\n\nThe Transcendent One: (casting) SO BE IT.\n\nFall-From-Grace: It is difficult to separate shadows from the darkness here. This is not a place meant for the living.\n\nThe Transcendent One: AH... THE TANAR'RI.\n\nFall-From-Grace: So, you are the spider that lies in the center of it all. I have many questions that you could answer. Your goals in this matter have not been entirely clear.\n\nThe Transcendent One: MY GOALS ARE NOT FOR YOU TO KNOW, FALLEN TANAR'RI. MY INDULGENCE IS ALL THAT KEEPS YOUR BLACK HEART BEATING IN YOUR CHEST; YOU MAY LEAVE WITH YOUR LIFE NOW... IF YOU WILL.\n\nFall-From-Grace: My heart is neither black nor do I fear for my life. My companions, my friends, are here in your Fortress. I shall not leave until we are rejoined and the man we follow has resolved this matter to a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nThe Transcendent One: THERE IS *NO* SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION TO THIS FOOL'S ERRAND. YOU WILL LEAVE THIS PLACE, AND YOU SHALL LEAVE YOUR UNDYING COMPANION HERE. FEAR NOT FOR HIS LIFE. THE ONLY PRICE HE SHALL PAY IS THE LOSS OF MEMORY.\n\nFall-From-Grace: As gracious as your offer is, I must refuse your offer to abandon my friends. As for the 'small' price he will pay at your hands, it is the equivalent of death to him. I have traveled with this man for some time, and there are many things I do not wish him to forget.\n\nThe Transcendent One: HE WILL FORGET. IT IS HIS FATE TO REMAIN IGNORANT. HE WILL FORGET YOU, TANAR'RI, JUST AS HE HAS FORGOTTEN ALL WHO HAVE WALKED THE PATH OF MISERY WITH HIM. HE EXISTS TO DIE, FORGET, AND DIE AGAIN. HE IS *NOTHING*.\n\nFall-From-Grace: That is *your* judgment. The fact remains that I do not wish him to forget me, nor all that he has struggled for to reach this place. He has suffered much, and I find my sympathies lie with him rather than the arrogant creature that postures before me and fights as a *coward* fights, preferring to kill from a distance where his opponent cannot reach him. You shall torment him no more.\n\nThe Transcendent One: TANAR'RI... PERHAPS YOU DOUBT MY POWERS HERE, IN THIS PLACE. A DEMONSTRATION MAY SILENCE YOUR DOUBT.\n\nFall-From-Grace: You have done enough harm - prepare yourself! (casting)\n\nThe Transcendent One: YOU ARE NOTHING. I CAN FORGE PLANES WITH MY POWER - I CAN UNMAKE YOU.\n\nThe Transcendent One: DOES HE REALLY MATTER TO YOU?\n\nAnnah: He matters MORE to me than life!\n\nThe Transcendent One: THEN... DIE.\n\nThe Nameless One: FALL-FROM-GRACE.\n\nFall-From-Grace: Your voice - so you have found yourself at last?\n\nThe Nameless One: YES. THE PRICE WAS... HIGH. THE COST WAS MANY LIFETIMES, MINE AND OTHERS.\n\nFall-From-Grace: The price of such thing is seldom measured in copper. Are you still...\n\nThe Nameless One: I AM STILL THE ONE YOU KNOW, BUT MY PERSPECTIVE HAS... CHANGED. I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN YOU, IF THAT IS YOUR FEAR.\n\nFall-From-Grace: No, that was not my fear.\n\nThe Nameless One: I CANNOT REMAIN HERE FOR MUCH LONGER. MY PUNISHMENT CALLS, AND FATE AND TIME SHALL SOON BE HERE. I WILL RETURN YOU TO SIGIL IF YOU WISH.\n\nFall-From-Grace: That is not my wish. I *will* find you again, no matter where in Lower Planes you will be - just as you shall be able to find me.\n\nThe Nameless One: IT MAY BE A LONG TIME. WHERE I AM BOUND, TIME IS NOT MEASURED IN YEARS, AND THE CRIMES I COMMITTED ARE STRONGER THAN ANY CAGE.\n\nFall-From-Grace: No cage shall separate us, and no Plane shall divide us. Keep thinking of me, and we shall meet again.\n\nThe Nameless One: I SHALL NOT FORGET ALL YOU SACRIFICED FOR ME.\n\nFall-From-Grace: Just do not forget me.\n\nThe Nameless One: TIME LAYS WASTE TO ALL THINGS. BUT I SHALL FIGHT IT AS LONG AS I CAN.\n\nFall-From-Grace: Time is not your enemy. Forever is.\n\nThe Nameless One: PERHAPS SO. FAREWELL, GRACE.\n\nWikipedia has an article about:"
