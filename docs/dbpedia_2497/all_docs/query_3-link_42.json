        "text": "MORT is a supplemental machine translation tool which can help aid you in your adventure throughout the world of Regnas. With MORT, you can efficiently play Blue Protocol and extract the text available in Japanese to your very own native language. The program has an overlay and layer function which will extract Japanese text and output the information it records through OCR into English. It’s a very useful tool for understanding how to navigate throughout the world of Blue Protocol.\n\nThe translation tool also allows you to pick from two modes in which you can extract the text and translate it. You can either use the automated full screen translation overlay which will make all the text on your screen automatically become English OR use the layer feature which you can highlight text and it will translate the region which you have selected. Please note using that using the automated full screen translation overlay at real time speed requires a very good computer. You can play around with the speed in the settings to match your computer performance or just use the layer method for translations which does not take up as much resources. The regular layer feature is much more reliable and stable compared to the first method.\n\nIn this guide, we will mainly be focusing on using the regular layer function to translate in-game text from Japanese to English.\n\nPlease note that because we are using the layer function and not the automatic full screen overlay function, we want CAPTURE IN THE ACTIVE WINDOW to be turned OFF or UNCHECKED. You can also enable CHECK THE LATEST VERSION and TOP MOST TRNASLATION WINDOW with a CHECKMARK.\n\nIn the additional tab, there is also another area we want to go to which is called the ADVANCED SETTING menu to select one option that might assist you with using the program in the future. Once you have clicked on ADVANCED SETTING we can configure the additional function we want to have added.\n\nNow that we have correctly configured MORT and our Snapshot keybind, we are able to start translating text on the fly. By pressing our keybind once and then letting go (DEFAULT: CTRL+SHIFT+A) you can select a region by holding down your LEFT CLICK. After you let go of your LEFT CLICK and have selected the text you want extracted, the layer function will show you the English translated text in the layer as shown in the image above.\n\nNote: Don’t forget you are able to freely move around the layer anywhere on your screen and resize it! You can also text the change adjust the font and font size of the layer by going to the TEXT tab in the MENU. The image below shows an example of the settings which can be configured."
