        "text": "Stories. Whether cautionary tales or success narratives, stories act as conduits for education and entertainment that can coax emotions out of a person and fuel feelings within them. As social beings, humans love to hear stories. Tell them. And even live them should the spotlight fall on them.\n\nBut here's the thing: aside from especially complex examples, stories can be told and digested in one go.\n\nSo what happens when you live untold tales that you then forget—relegating you to a cycle of experiencing a narrative and subsequently ending up in another with no recollection of the former? What happens when the lessons you can draw from a story are swiftly wiped from your memory, stunting your growth as a human being? What happens when you are repeatedly confronted with the same mistakes—not to mention new ones—that caused you to consider a change of character in the first place?\n\nSuch is the saga that defines one of the most thoughtful games of the 90s, one that set an example for other interactive stories to live up to following the turn of the century.\n\nSuch is 1999's Planescape: Torment.\n\nDeveloped by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay Entertainment, Planescape: Torment is an isometric CRPG that takes place in the namesake Dungeons & Dragons setting. Yet unlike its contemporaries like Baldur's Gate (1998) and Icewind Dale (2000), Planescape: Torment isn't your standard fantasy romp. Rather, it's a character-driven odyssey that seeks to answer several questions. Not just about the protagonist, but also about how far one can go to change for the better—even if it takes them what feels like many lifetimes.\n\nWhile the title received critical praise upon its release, sales failed to match those enjoyed by the likes of Final Fantasy VII and other CRPGs using the Infinity Engine. In recent years, however, Planescape: Torment's narrative qualities have received a reappraisal—with an enhanced edition and a couple of spiritual successors (Torment: Tides of Numenera and Disco Elysium) seeing the light of day in the latter half of the 2010s.\n\nSuffice it to say that time has been kind to Planescape: Torment, if not the Nameless One himself.\n\nIn this analytical article, I shall detail the ten narrative pillars that make Black Isle Studios' dark fantasy oeuvre one of the more noteworthy examples of tightly penned yet remarkably flexible stories in the medium. What has caused this formerly hidden gem to gradually rise from obscurity as time went on? And what lessons can we draw from it?\n\nNOTE: Due to the nature of this post, spoilers shall crop up. If you've any intention to dive into Planescape: Torment, feel free to refrain from reading this here article and come back once you've experienced the Nameless One's journey for yourself.\n\nNot your usual \"save the world\" tale despite the epic setting\n\nAs I mentioned before, Planescape: Torment deviates greatly from its fantasy peers in many ways. While the bleak Planescape setting and pre-established protagonist do stand out in the RPG field, they are surface-level details compared to a more fundamental distinction within the package.\n\nLong story short, this is a game about you—specifically the process of self-discovery the Nameless One endures.\n\nThat's right: no saving the world from a prophesized evil, and no playing as a chosen one tasked with a great mission. Just you, a bout of amnesia, and a case of immortality tossed in for good measure. This brings up several questions that the intro movie isn't shy to ask. From the get-go, you know that you have a lot to answer for and unravel.\n\nAs soon as you awaken in a mortuary of all places, you are greeted by Morte—a witty floating skull who seems to know more about your predicament than he lets on. Compared to mysterious figures who approach the hero and identify them as the chosen one in many a fantasy tale, Planescape: Torment's call to adventure seems less grand than the imposing setting the Nameless One negotiates in his hunt for the truth about himself.\n\nThis is one of Planescape: Torment's most outstanding narrative attributes. Despite the epic surroundings, the game is more concerned with having you save yourself from a cycle of ignorance than with saving the countless souls calling Sigil and the rest of the Planes home.\n\nThe result? A story that favors depth over breadth by focusing on the protagonist's and his chums' tormented fate rather than overly concerning itself with the other souls populating the game world. That's not to say that secondary characters don't serve a purpose that amplifies the Nameless One's personal stakes, but it's clear that the leaner narrative scope minimizes distractions from the character development the protagonist experiences.\n\nSettings and circumstances that seem both alien and familiar\n\nIt's normal for one to be in awe whenever they set foot in a new city. The architecture, the people, the sociocultural cues that distinguish locals from outsiders... There's a lot to take in, and such is the impression that players will feel upon being introduced to the likes of Sigil and the other Planes the Nameless One shall trek about. Stranger in a strange land, eh?\n\nAt first glance, maybe. But here's where Planescape: Torment's other narrative trick comes into play. You see, the Nameless One turns out to have had numerous reincarnations on account of his biting the dust before the start of the player's journey. While the protagonist's memories have gone belly up, the same can't be said of the consequences of the Nameless One's previous actions—with NPCs seemingly foreign to the protagonist recognizing him, either in a positive or negative light.\n\nWhether it's the front desk person welcoming the Nameless One back in the Society of Sensation or a bartender reminiscing about the protagonist's previously frenzied behavior in his establishment, hints of the Nameless One's influence across the world can be felt.\n\nThis is to say nothing of the notes and other clues that past incarnations of the protagonist left behind in his tomb, Sensate bedroom, and other locations they traveled to in search of freedom from immortality.\n\nIn light of this, it's fair to say that the game can double as both an RPG and mystery title—with the catch being that you already know whom you're after. The mystery, then, lies in the way in which past incarnations of the protagonist lived their lives and succumbed to lethal failures. That the consequences of previous misdeeds stack up over time means that the world's alien nature lies in both its odd architecture and the manner in which people interact with you when the Nameless One meets them again.\n\nErgo, the contrast between familiarity and foreignness lends the narrative an uncanny quality. Players are thus intrinsically encouraged to push on because it's their personal fate that's on the line, not that of the world.\n\nA journal system that serves both gameplay and the narrative\n\nPlaying as an amnesiac character is a well-worn formula in games. As with fantasy tropes, however, Planescape: Torment doesn't hesitate to shake up said formula. For starters, there's the aforementioned fact that the Nameless One is stuck in a cycle of waking up with no clue as to how he ended up dead and lived his many lives beforehand. An annoying inconvenience when one's trying to follow the trail that'll take them to the source of their predicament, only to have their progress reset upon buying the farm.\n\nThis is where the journal, another staple of RPG design, steps in. On its own, it's nothing game-changing—with the journal keeper's writing style and voice being one of the ways a game's take on the system can stand out from those seen in other titles. In Planescape: Torment's case, however, the journal's uniqueness comes from the context in which it is presented.\n\nYou see, the Nameless One used a journal in the past to keep track of important facts he may depend on should he die and lose his memory again.\n\nTrouble is, he loses said journal at the start of the game.\n\nThis means he has to start fresh with another one and jot down any detail, big and small, that may help him retrace his steps swiftly and minimize the number of times he deviates from the golden path and gets up to no good.\n\nTo players, a journal's nice to have if not essential—from their perspective, they'll recall the locations they visited and tactics they used to get to where they were before dying. But from an in-game viewpoint, the journal's a lifesaving tool that takes on narrative significance when one considers the Nameless One's cyclical case of amnesia.\n\nIf he gets to where he needs to be without consulting his journal, that's because the player steered him there. But if the player takes the time to review their journal notes and put themselves in the Nameless One's shoes, then they begin to truly role-play as an amnesiac adventurer—heightening the title's storytelling chops and sense of immersion.\n\nA rotten world that enables one to be chaotic and evil (via words)\n\nSide note: it may seem strange today, but there was a time when TSR—the original publisher of Dungeons & Dragons—had reservations about depicting questionable behavior in video game adaptations of the property. Chalk it up to the Satanic panic that gripped the States in the 80s.\n\nAs a result, games like Baldur's Gate had to portray chaotic and evil player characters as folks who reluctantly save the world and restore societal order.\n\nThat the Forgotten Realms looked idyllic meant that players who go off the beaten moral path could feel a bit guilty about their actions in relation to the temperament and values borne by other characters.\n\nThat's not the case with Planescape: Torment. For starters, the world seems so rotten and bleak that even the most chaotic evil of player characters will seem like a saint compared to the likes of the Dustmen and Collectors. Yet there's another aspect that makes morally dubious paths enticing alternatives to straight-laced ones: you can be evil and chaotic via dialog.\n\nWant to skip combat and bluff your way toward the same material reward a more lawful character would get through good deeds? You can do that. Tempted to get more gold out of a quest giver's pockets with a few silvery words and without making any threats? Knock yourself out.\n\nWhereas most titles are content with making chaotic evil personalities aggressive and trigger-happy, Planescape: Torment allows the Nameless One to achieve his primary goals through deceit and malice (provided players keep pumping points in charisma, wisdom, and intelligence to unlock dialog options). That such pacifist but shrewd actions contrast with the protagonist's pallid and intimidating build means that one can forge a brawny and wicked soul possessing a preternatural breadth of knowledge.\n\nA bit like Conan the Barbarian, only with a sharp tongue that can see more use than whichever blade players may be hauling about.\n\nExtensive but personal lore that fuels a sense of mystery\n\nGenerally, there's a distinction between lore and story. The former relates to worldbuilding material that involves past formative events and is passed on from one generation to another. The latter simply refers to the meaning behind the set of events that characters undergo as they near their goals and potentially develop as personalities. Failure to distinguish the two from one another can lead to games that treat lore as the story, putting more focus on the world around the protagonist than on the protagonist's growth and wants.\n\nSo what happens when lore and personal story are closely intertwined? What does one get out of having much of the worldbuilding center around the plight and doings of the protagonist? Well, one gets Planescape: Torment.\n\nThe inscriptions that the Nameless One left behind in his tomb, the sensory stone that reveals how the protagonist manipulated a now-dead comrade by having her do his risky bidding... Whether it's something that's woven into the fabric of the main quest or an item that can be interacted with if the player explores their surroundings in their spare time, a sizable chunk of the lore that the Nameless One comes across in his travels feels relevant to him.\n\nThis matters because in a lot of titles, lore can be liberally dished out and designed to let players learn about the world they're in—never mind the fact that the protagonist may already be familiar with how the world operates.\n\nBut to the amnesiac Nameless One, such lore is news to him. Not to mention a lengthy trail of evidence he can follow to uncover the truth about what occurred between now and the moment he became immortal. Ergo, the lore becomes something players actively want to seek out rather than review later.\n\nThe player is as clueless as the Nameless One, reinforcing the relationship between the two and strengthening the role-playing experience of an amnesiac adventurer trying to get his bearings and thoughts together.\n\nAn XP system that rewards one for engaging with lore and story\n\nThis is more of a gameplay element than a narrative one, but the former's so closely tied to the latter (and the player's understanding of the story) that it deserves a mention—especially given how XP's usually earned in games.\n\nIn most titles, XP's something you get from slaying enemies, completing quests, discovering locations, and the like. While Planescape: Torment does feature this XP model, it expands upon it by making the unraveling of lore and plot information another method of accruing points for leveling up.\n\nBetween inquiring about Morte's peculiar smell and learning the Nameless One's true name at the end of his journey, the game actively rewards player curiosity through their engagement with the narrative and lore. In a way, the title teaches players to tighten their grasp on reality by studying topics of interest. This process of digesting information and then earning XP acts as a reflection of the Nameless One's pursuit of self-discovery.\n\nJust the mere act of learning things is enough to instill a sense of power and control in the protagonist, hence the developers' clever decision to make the acquisition of knowledge a viable way to level up characters.\n\nAs with the personal nature of the lore, the XP incentive for unearthing information about the Nameless One's situation and world plays into the RPG theme of growing more powerful via experience. Planescape: Torment adds a cerebral touch to the formula that amplifies the value—and qualities—of its narrative, with the Nameless One and player learning and growing together on a mental level. It's via this bond that players are able to become genuinely invested in the Nameless One's quest for enlightenment.\n\nRelationships that go both ways and revolve around torment\n\nSpeaking of bonds, the Nameless One can reach out to sundry figures and befriend them on his journey. These include—but aren't limited to—the aforementioned Morte, the brash tiefling Annah, and even a succubus who eschews bodily pleasures in favor of intellectual ones.\n\nBesides the lean and mean quality of the recruitable roster, what makes the Nameless One's allies so convincing and believable is the fact that some of them share a history with the protagonist.\n\nThis is another example of how the title distinguishes itself from other RPGs. Whereas most genre entries feature comrades whom the protagonist meets for the first time—a fitting moment for them to spell out their backstories—Planescape: Torment's companions bear scars and tales that stem from the torment they experienced and shared with the Nameless One in the past. Therefore, conversations can cause the protagonist to reflect on his actions and the consequences they've had on his allies.\n\nThe fighter-mage Daa'kon, for instance, is compelled to pair up with the Nameless One because the former was rescued from a crisis of faith by the latter in the past. Likewise, the pyromaniacal Ignus (re)joins the Nameless One's party since a past incarnation of the protagonist helped Ignus learn the magical art of controlling fire—albeit with torment-causing results.\n\nAs with the setting and its goings-on, companions in Planescape: Torment initially seem foreign to the player. But through frequent conversations with them, the Nameless One will realize that there are known quantities—encouraging players to further dig into their allies' mindset and see if there are any unresolved issues to settle. This, in turn, begets a level of character depth that recontextualizes the Nameless One's relationship with his companions—their shared suffering having drawn them to the wounded but inspirational figure that is the protagonist (a past incarnation of him, at least).\n\nErgo, the player feels like they bear the responsibility to have their allies attain the same peace and resolution that the Nameless One craves.\n\nA singular and clear theme reflected via actions and dialog\n\n\"What can change the nature of a man?\"\n\nEven to those who just heard about the game, chances are they came across the above quote from the night hag Ravel Puzzlewell. It's the question that lies at the heart of why the Nameless One got stuck with immortality in the first place. It's also the question that forms the core theme of the title, a theme that's touched on through the player's dialog choices and actions.\n\nThe most surprising thing about Planescape: Torment is that in spite of its limited character creation settings, the title offers a lot of flexibility in how players can shape the Nameless One's nature (i.e. personality and values) via the main quest and side activities. Yes, the game does closely abide by Dungeons & Dragons rules by featuring an alignment system—but said system hardly restricts the Nameless One's ability to use the time he has on his hands to make a difference not just in the world, but also in his mind.\n\nExamples of what the Nameless One can do to shape his nature include:\n\nConvincing a Dustman that death isn't that great of a release from his harsh life by killing yourself in front of him before being resurrected.\n\nPicking a new name for an undead woman who can't recall her past self.\n\nFinding a tombstone for a woebegone survivor and carving his destroyed city's name on it to memorialize it and free him to build a new life.\n\nThe gist to be derived from such endeavors is that there's more to character customization than just what kind of armor, weapons, and spells one can equip. Through the theme of self-actualization, Planescape: Torment offers a novel way for players to shape their role-playing experience—even if they've little to no say on a character's build and background.\n\nSuch a level of narrative malleability and soul-searching is a quality that has made Planescape: Torment's decision-making conducive to multiple playthroughs. The strength of the Nameless One's character arc, then, comes as much from its diversity as it does from its simplicity and clarity.\n\nAn antagonist representing the worst parts of the protagonist\n\nAs stated before, Planescape: Torment eschews a \"save the world\" narrative in favor of a more personal tale. This brings up crucial questions with regards to the stakes involved: Who tries to keep the protagonist from achieving his goals? What reason do they have for standing in his way?\n\nOne shouldn't look far for the answer. In fact, they only need to look within the Nameless One. Well, if the antagonist didn't skedaddle in the first place.\n\nEnter the Transcendent One, a.k.a. the Nameless One's personified mortality.\n\nIn most fantasy stories, the villain generally ends up in one of many archetypal categories—including that of the megalomaniacal world conqueror. While appropriate for an \"end of the world\" scenario, such an archetype can lack a connection to the protagonist and their values.\n\nIt needn't be personal—like having the protagonist and antagonist share blood relations—but the villain should reflect the protagonist's (worst) self and/or noble intentions (re: Killmonger in the 2018 film Black Panther).\n\nIn Planescape: Torment, that antagonist is very much personal. In fact, the Transcendent One can be thought of as a version of the Nameless One if the latter hadn't had his buddies and worldly travels to show and teach him the benefits of changing one's nature when the situation calls for it. It's a bit like the contrast between the antagonistic Sarevok and the protagonistic Gorion's Ward in Baldur's Gate, the former lacking the friendships and guidance the latter leveraged to become a more humanistic kind of Bhaalspawn.\n\nIf the game's theme is the malleability of man's nature, then the Transcendent One represents the camp that believes that man's nature is set in stone and can never be changed—not a great idea if said nature is malicious at its core.\n\nIn fact, the antagonist's lust for freedom and wish to retain his state of being means that he'll go as far as to send deadly shadows after the Nameless One so that he loses his recollection of the evidence that'd lead him to and confront his personified mortality. That the Transcendent One doesn't hesitate to make short work of the Nameless One's allies reinforces the harm that a sheltered life—physically or mentally—can have on a person's soul.\n\nIn other words, the Transcendent One kills the player's companions because they are a threat to his belief that a soul should be impervious to change. But as a certain rodent from a Pixar movie once said, \"change is nature.\" Hence the Nameless One's attempt to settle the score with a wicked part of himself.\n\nAn ending rejecting \"happily ever after\" in favor of raw honesty\n\nIt's true that we all want things to be well when they end well. In the case of \"save the world\" narratives, that kind of outcome stems from banishing a great evil and living happily ever after. Whether or not the protagonist has learned and embraced lessons along the way doesn't matter as much in the grand scheme of things since the story's stakes lie in the fate of the world. So how does Planescape: Torment wrap things up in an outstanding fashion?\n\nRegarding the Nameless One's plight, there is good and bad news. The good news is that no matter which ending the player gets, the protagonist will have overpowered his personified mortality and freed himself from the cycle of unending ignorance that began prior to the start of the game.\n\nThe bad news, however, is that the sins that the Nameless One committed prior to and after attaining immortality are too numerous for him to redeem himself. He is destined to end up in a hellish afterlife.\n\nMakes one wonder if the adventure was all for naught, eh?\n\nThe answer is \"no,\" for the Nameless One achieved his ultimate goal in the end: finding out who he is and making peace with the revelations he comes across. Time and fate are coming to sort him out, and there's nothing that he can do other than make his peace with reality and what's to come.\n\nOne can say that the ending is bittersweet: while the Nameless One does suffer a fate that matches the weight of crimes he wasn't aware of in later incarnations, the lessons he learned along the way mean that he now comes equipped with the stoic mindset that'll have him keep calm and carry on. Like in Fallout: New Vegas's Dead Money, the protagonist learns how to let go and embrace the unknown—something the Transcendent One feared.\n\nIf an RPG can teach its protagonist the virtues of courage and temperance in the face of hostilities, then Planescape: Torment drives home that message—more so than its contemporaries—through an ending that challenges the Nameless One to wield said virtues in the baleful afterlife. He may not have saved himself from a dire fate, but he at least saved himself from the cowardice his worst self embodied. Ergo, peace doesn't settle upon the land as in other titles, but rather in the Nameless One's mind. It's a more potent and timeless form of tranquility that does justice to the protagonist's personal stakes, and the reason why Planescape: Torment remains heady to this day.\n\n----------------\n\nVideo games have come a long way in the narrative department. With advancements in graphics, sound design, and systems, the medium has widened the range of stories that can be told through gameplay and the written word. One just needs to take a look at the likes of the Nemesis system in Shadow of War (2017) and the extensive banter in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy (2021) for evidence.\n\nWith developers still scratching the surface in terms of themes they can adopt for conveying story and gameplay, one can't help but look forward to gaming's future. This is why the existence of titles like Planescape: Torment comes as a blessing to budding and veteran writers.\n\nAs an early example of storytelling that's stellar by gaming and general standards, Planescape: Torment proves from the get-go that philosophical exploration can pair nicely with the physical kind of venturing to weave an experience that's more than just \"fun.\" An experience that engages the mind by having players look back on their journey and see how the pieces come together to portray, in the words of Sid Meier, a series of interesting decisions. (And awesome plot revelations.)\n\nLike the Nameless One, Planescape: Torment seems initially intimidating—what with the reams of text and amount of traveling one must contend with to see everything the story and lore have to offer.\n\nBut don't let looks fool you: there's a lot underneath the surface that can pleasantly surprise you if you allow the game to reveal its moral flexibility, dark humor, and thematic potency with every conversation you trigger and point of interest you interact with.\n\nThe Planescape universe is a gloomy one, but the Nameless One's journey shows that we can seek enlightenment no matter where we roam.\n\nThat's a lesson any human being can heed.\n\n----------------\n\nLet me know what you think of my post in the comments section, and feel free to ask questions and share the article.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Watfen64\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Michformer"
