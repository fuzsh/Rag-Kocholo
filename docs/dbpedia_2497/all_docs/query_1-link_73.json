        "text": "There were early warnings in the 1997 role-playing game Final Fantasy VII that Cloud Strife harbored delusions of grandeur. An identity borrowed from an old war buddy. Genetics spliced from a parasitic alien. A toxic relationship with a super soldier.\n\nBut it was the moment Cloud unwillingly raised a sword toward Aerith Gainsborough, his affectionate companion, that it appeared he had lost all self-control. Not until his weapon lowered could players relax.\n\nAnd then, a twist.\n\nAfter the screen faded into an animated sequence, Sephiroth, the evil super soldier with silver hair and snake eyes, appeared from the skies without warning to plunge a sharp katana through Aerith’s back.\n\nHer death was permanent, an inconceivable notion when video games were known for giving characters extra lives. As Aerith collapsed, so did a narrative trope that had restricted the medium’s dramatic potential."
