        "text": "Unlike other social-technological contexts (Boccia Artieri, 2012), video games offer a space where death is frequently present as a narrative theme from the linguistic and practical viewpoints (Egenfeldt-Nielsen, et al. 2015), even though it is deprived of its more dreadful dimension-its permanent trait. In fact, \"game over\" indicates only the end of a possibility that can be repeated countless times, as players wish. The Last Day of June proposes a story that focuses on the protagonist's loss. A car accident leaves the main character, Carl, in a wheelchair. When the man realizes that his loved one, June, died, the players' target becomes to help him accept his loss-and triumph over it-by modifying the course of events before June's death. This paper proposes a narrative analysis (Fernandez-Vara, 2015), rooted on Gennette's (1980) model, relating story highlights to flashbacks (which we define \"generative\" in the analysis) to some visual and scenic choices that are associated with the stages of grief and its processing. The aim is to enquire into the pedagogical and cultural values of the case study by means of its association with myths and their main functions. Finally, a qualitative examination of a number of comments from one of the main YouTube channels will support the interpretation of the video game. Lo statuto ontologico del game: tra narrazione e azione Il dibattito intorno al videogioco continua ad essere dominato da posizioni controverse, tra coloro che ne evidenziano i rischi e la scarsa utilità, associandolo a un momento puramente ricreativo, e chi invece ne riconosce un ruolo importante dal punto di vista psicologico e sociale (Bianchi-Berthoze & Isbiter 2016; Yannakakis & Martinez 2016, Ferguson 2018). Eppure spesso si dimentica che questo prodotto dell'industria culturale ha delle origini innate e antichissime. Esso è per statuto ontologico ascrivibile al mondo più classico dei giochi: una pratica che affonda le sue radici nelle attività simulative e ricreative già messe in essere da alcune specie diverse dalla nostra, confermandone la natura istintuale e biologica. Al tempo stesso al gioco viene riconosciuto una matrice antropologica, oltre che evolutiva. Incarna dunque la cultura del suo tempo e ne diventa espressione (Egenfeldt-Nielsen, Smith, Tosca 2016).\n\nFourth Generation Warfare is characterized by an extensive and permeating use of technology, but the application of technology is not limited to weapons and communication tools used by armies. Technology has deeply affected how the media works, and how messages and perceptions concerning war are sent, elaborated, and received. Perceptions of war have been shaped in the past by epic sagas, books, songs, plays, comic books, and movies, among other forms of media. Videogames are just one of the more modern forms of media to emerge in the last century. The birth of videogames can be traced back to the 1960’s, and war has always been a theme explored by the medium, with a title like Spacewar!, largely considered the first ever videogame available for the public, released in 1962 (Carr, 2003). However, the focus of this research is not to give an historical analysis of how the war theme has been explored in videogames throughout the history of the medium, but to analyse the cultural representation of war (and particularly modern conflict) in modern videogames. The author of this paper believes it of primary importance to do so, considering the scale of the videogame industry today, which in 2015 consisted in 23.5 billion $ of total revenue and 155 million people playing videogames regularly in the USA only. The numbers are indeed impressive and meaningful, but, regardless of them, the fact remains that videogames should be rightly considered not just a medium, but a cultural product able to create culture itself and, therefore, worthy of academic interests. Big steps have been made in the last decade in order to establish an academic discipline with the intent of studying videogames, but more needs to be done (Shaw, 2010).\n\nThis paper looks beyond the ‘media mix’ to explore some different ways of thinking about ‘transmedia’ in Japanese videogames. I examine several games and genres as artworks that pass through and across different mediums – of space, art, hardware and authorial roles – to tell their stories. Apart from the grand narrative arcs of the JRPG, I consider the shooter and fighting genre as well as action-adventure to show storytelling in different media forms, since story and characterization occur at different points of the gameplay process in different narrative modes. Japanese games tell stories about universal human concerns, but also address anxieties situated in a particular time and space. I will examine Japanese anxieties over bioethics in the mid-1990s as a case study of transmedia storytelling in Japanese games – one vision refracted through many different artistic forms. My overall argument is that the chaotic and disjointed nature of Japan’s historical consciousness in the twentieth century demands a refracted vision, which videogames are perhaps best suited to provide.\n\nThe importance of the work of retro gamers and fan communities within the field of videogame preservation has been acknowledged and the need for institutional collaboration with these communities has also been recognised. There are, however, minimal examples of how museums might realize this opportunity. This thesis examines the curation of a local history of Australian videogames for the era of the microcomputer and, in the process, provides an example of how museums can effectively engage with online communities to document and display videogames. Local game histories form a crucial component of a response to the call for a critical historiography of videogames. Notable scholars to have proposed the need for such a historiography include Raiford Guins, Henry Lowood, Jakko Suominen and Melanie Swalwell. Responding to this need, I undertake research on an important chapter of Australian videogame history. In addressing the challenges of curating videogames, which are understood as both ‘artefacts and experiences’, I explore what museums can learn from the practices of retro game communities. Online retro gamer communities have created extensive archives of early microcomputer games, developing systems and procedures for their preservation and documentation. Through examination of retro gamer sites and other player made artefacts, I develop a novel argument for the importance of player memory in capturing how people experienced videogames and engaged with broader game culture. The importance of personal memories for videogame history is further explored in the case study of the Popular Memory Archive (PMA). The PMA website is designed as both exhibition and archive with the intent of engaging online communities in sharing their recollections of 1980s games. Through an analysis of the PMA I examine new ways of documenting and displaying born digital work. This thesis contributes to broader questions about the display and collection of digital heritage by museums confronted with the challenges of a future in which screen culture will no longer leave material traces. Born digital artefacts need to be recorded and represented through the documentation of their systems and the experiences they afford their users. Through an analysis of retro gamer sites and the PMA, I present an exemplar for future collaborative practice between museums and online communities for the display and documentation of born digital artefacts.\n\nThis article examines the transmedial theme and narrative genre of bildung (life formation) in relation to videogames. It revisits key tenets of life formation theory insofar as they can be applied to a small but growing corpus of games that emphasize spiritual and philosophical maturation and advancement. We argue that Joseph Campbell's monomyth is an oversimplified and ultimately unsuitable lens through which to analyze character development in games, which restrains rather than stimulates the kind of complexities, diversity and fluidity of character psychology needed in contemporary videogame ecology. The main part of this study is dedicated to a comparative analysis of three indie games that address the life formation theme through allegories of space-in-time. The main focal areas will be character and story patterns; chronotopic mappings onto developmental trajectories; the treatment of mastery, mentorship and choice (Fraiman, 1993); and the spiritual and metacognitive alignment of extra and intradiegetic education.\n\nEmotion regulation (ER) supports multiple individual functions and promotes mental health and wellbeing. Among the tools that may be used to help people in managing their affective states, videogames are reaching attention and are showing positive effects. Yet, little is known about their effectiveness. This study aims to assess the amount and quality of studies investigating the effects and modalities of the use of videogames for ER. A systematic literature search according to PRISMA guidelines was performed. Subsequently, according to expert advice other few studies have been added. Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review; they can be categorized into three groups, namely (1) cross-sectional and qualitative studies, (2) experimental studies investigating the effects of videogame experience on ER and (3) ER intervention with serious games. Discussion of the reviewed studies highlights that frequent gaming with commercial games offers more opp...\n\nThis paper applies psychoanalytic frameworks to the survival horror franchise Silent Hill, a series which is itself informed by psychoanalytic themes. Concerns include the construction of game space as maternal womb, cinematic sequences as primal fantasies , and the representation of memory across the games within a psychoanalytic context. The horror genres' preoccupation with monstrous mother figures is evident in boss battle adversaries, the depiction of gamespaces as bloody «maternal caves», and in narratives concerning characters' searching for their parental origins Distinguishing between videogames' playable sequences and cinematics as conscious and sub-conscious aspects, cut-scenes are analysed as reproducing primal fantasies, serving to explain protagonists' backstory and situating play within narrative contexts. Such moments intrude into the game, marking transformations between the ordinary world and the abject Otherworld, or heralding the emergence of psychoanalytically-resonant monstrous creatures which the protagonist must destroy. Finally, Silent Hill: Shattered Memories is examined as a game which, even more than others, foregrounds the series' explicit reference to psychoanalytic preoccupations, engaging with contemporary understandings concerning the relationship between memory, media and fantasy."
