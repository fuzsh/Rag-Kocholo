bliss with Himselven;\n\nAnd wisse me to warp out some word at this time\n\nThat nother void be ne vain but worship til Himselven\n\nPlesand and profitable to the pople that them heres.\n\nYe that lust has to lithe or loves for to here\n\nOf elders of olde time and of their awke deedes,\n\nHow they were lele in their law and loved God Almighty\n\nHerkenes me hendely and holdes you stille,\n\nAnd I shall tell you a tale that trew is and noble\n\nOf the real renkes of the Round Table\n\nThat chef were of chivalry and cheftains noble\n\nBoth wary in their workes and wise men of armes,\n\nDoughty in their doings and dredde ay shame,\n\nKind men and courtais and couth of court thewes,\n\nHow they won with war worshippes many,\n\nSlogh Lucius the lithere that lord was of Rome,\n\nAnd conquered that kingrik through craftes of armes;\n\nHerkenes now hiderward and heres this story!\n\nWhen that the king Arthur by conquest had wonnen\n\nCasteles and kingdomes and countrees many,\n\nAnd he had covered the crown of that kith riche\n\nOf all that Uter in erthe ought in his time:\n\nArgayle and Orkney and all these oute-iles,\n\nIreland utterly, as Ocean runnes,\n\nScathel Scotland by skill he skiftes as him likes, 1\n\nAnd Wales of war he won at his will,\n\nBothe Flaunders and Fraunce free til himselven\n\nHolland and Hainault they held of him bothen,\n\nBurgoigne and Brabaunt and Bretain the less\n\nGuienne and Gothland and Grace the rich,\n\nBayonne and Bourdeaux he belded full fair,\n\nTouraine and Toulouse with towres full high,\n\nOf Poitiers and Provence he was prince holden;\n\nOf Valence and Vienne, of value so noble,\n\nOf Overgne and Anjou, those erldoms rich,\n\nBy conquest full cruel they knew him for lord\n\nOf Navarre and Norway and Normandy eek\n\nOf Almaine, of Estriche, and other ynow;\n\nDenmark he dressed all by drede of himselven\n\nFro Swynne unto Swetherwike, with his sword keen! 2\n\nWhen he these deedes had done, he dubbed his knightes,\n\nDevised ducheries and delt in diverse rewmes, 3\n\nMade of his cosins kinges annointed\n\nIn kithes there they covet crownes to bere.\n\nWhen he these rewmes had ridden and rewled the pople,\n\nThen rested that real and held the Round Table;\n\nSujourns that seson to solace himselven\n\nIn Bretain the brodder, as him best likes;\n\nSithen went into Wales with his wyes all,\n\nSways into Swaldie with his snell houndes\n\nFor to hunt at the hartes in those high landes,\n\nIn Glamorgan with glee there gladship was ever,\n\nAnd there a citee he set, by assent of his lordes\n\nThat Caerlion was called, with curious walles, 4\n\nOn the rich river that runnes so fair,\n\nThere he might semble his sorte to see when him liked. 5\n\nThen after at Carlisle a Christenmass he holdes,\n\nThis ilk kidd conquerour and held him for lord\n\nWith dukes and douspeeres of diverse rewmes,\n\nErles and erchevesques and other ynow,\n\nBishoppes and bachelers and bannerettes noble 6\n\nThat bowes to his banner, busk when him likes.\n\nBut on the Christenmass-day when they were all sembled,\n\nThat comlich conquerour commaundes himselven\n\nThat ilk a lord sholde lenge and no leve take\n\nTo the tende day fully were taken to the end.\n\nThus on real array he held his Round Table\n\nWith semblaunt and solace and selcouthe metes;\n\nWas never such noblay in no mannes time\n\nMade in mid-winter in tho West Marches!\n\nBut on the New-Yere day, at the noon even,\n\nAs the bold at the borde was of bred served, 7\n\nSo come in sodenly a senatour of Rome,\n\nWith sixteen knightes in a suite, sewand him one;\n\nHe salued the soveraign and the sale after\n\nIlk a king after king, and made his inclines;\n\nGaynor in her degree he grette as him liked\n\nAnd sinn again to the gome he gave up his needes: 8\n\n\"Sir Lucius Iberius, the Emperour of Rome,\n\nSalues thee as subjet, under his sele rich;\n\nIt is credan, Sir King, with cruel wordes;\n\nTrow it for no troufles, his targe is to shew! 9\n\nNow in this New-Yeres Day, with notaries sign,\n\nI make thee summons in sale to sew for thy landes,\n\nThat on Lamass Day there be no let founden 10\n\nThat thou be redy at Rome with all thy Round Table\n\nAppere in his presence with thy pris knightes\n\nAt prime of the day, in pain of your lives,\n\nIn the kidd Capitoil before the king selven\n\nWhen he and his senatours bes set as them likes,\n\nTo answer only why thou occupies the landes\n\nThat owe homage of old til him and his elders,\n\nWhy thou has ridden and raimed and ransound the pople\n\nAnd killed down his cosins, kinges annointed;\n\nThere shall thou give reckoning for all thy Round Table,\n\nWhy thou art rebel to Rome and rentes them with-holdes!\n\nYif thou these summons withsit, he sendes thee these wordes:\n\nHe shall thee seek over the se, with sixteen kinges,\n\nBrin Bretain the brode and britten thy knightes 11\n\nAnd bring thee buxomly as a beste with brethe where him likes,\n\nThat thou ne shall route ne rest under the heven rich\n\nThough thou for reddour of Rome run to the erthe!\n\nFor if thou flee into Fraunce or Frisland other,\n\nThou shall be fetched with force and overset forever!\n\nThy fader made fewtee we find in our rolles,\n\nIn the regestr√© of Rome, who-so right lookes;\n\nWithouten more troufling the tribute we ask\n\nThat Julius Cesar won with his gentle knightes!\"\n\nThe king blushed on the berne with his brode eyen, 12\n\nThat full bremly for brethe brent as the gledes,\n\nCast colours as the king with cruel lates\n\nLooked as a lion and on his lip bites.\n\nThe Romanes for radness rusht to the erthe,\n\nFor ferdness of his face as they fey were;\n\nCouched as kennetes before the king selven;\n\nBecause of his countenaunce confused them seemed!\n\nThen covered up a knight and cried full loud:\n\n\"King, crowned of kind, courtais and noble,\n\nMisdo no messanger for mensk of thyselven,\n\nSenn we are in thy manrede and mercy thee beseekes;\n\nWe lenge with Sir Lucius, that lord is of Rome,\n\nThat is the marveloustest man than on molde lenges;\n\nIt is lelful til us his liking til work; 13\n\nWe come at his commaundment; have us excused.\"\n\nThen carpes the conquerour cruel wordes:\n\n\"Ha! cravand knight, a coward thee seemes!\n\nThere is some segge in this sale, and he were sore greved 14\n\nThou durst not for all Lumbardy look on him ones!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" says the senatour, \"so Crist mot me help,\n\nThe vout of thy visage has wounded us all!\n\nThou art the lordliest lede that ever I on looked.\n\nBy looking, withouten lees, a lion thee seemes!\" 15\n\n\"Thou has me summoned,\" quod the king, \"and said what thee likes.\n\nFor sake of thy soveraign I suffer thee the more;\n\nSenn I crowned was in kith with crisom annointed, 16\n\nWas never creature to me that carped so large!\n\nBut I shall take counsel at kinges annointed\n\nOf dukes and douspeeres and doctours noble,\n\nOf peeres of the parlement, prelates and other\n\nOf the richest renkes of the Round Table;\n\nThus shall I take avisement of valiant bernes,\n\nWork after the wit of my wise knightes.\n\nTo warp wordes in waste no worship it were,\n\nNe wilfully in this wrath to wreken myselven.\n\nForthy shall thou lenge here and lodge with these lordes\n\nThis seven-night in solace to sujourn your horses,\n\nTo see what life that we lede in these low landes.\"\n\nFor by the realtee of Rome, that richest was ever,\n\nHe commaundes Sir Kayous, \"Take keep to those lordes\n\nTo stightel tho stern men as their state askes,\n\nThat they be herbered in haste in those high chambres,\n\nSithen sittandly in sale served thereafter,\n\nThat they find no faute of food to their horses,\n\nNother wine ne wax ne welth in this erthe;\n\nSpare for no spicery, but spend what thee likes 17\n\nThat there be largess on loft and no lack founden;\n\nIf thou my worship wait, wye, by my trewth, 18\n\nThou shall have gersoms full grete that gain shall thee ever!\"\n\nNow are they herbered in high and in host holden, 19\n\nHastily with hende men within these high walles.\n\nIn chambers with chimpnees they changen their weedes, 20\n\nAnd sithen the chaunceller them fetched with chevalry noble;\n\nSoon the senatour was set as him well seemed,\n\nAt the kinges own borde; two knightes him served,\n\nSingulere, soothly, as Arthur himselven,\n\nRichly on the right hand at the Round Table.\n\nBy resoun that the Romans were so rich holden,\n\nAs of the realest blood that regned in erthe.\n\nThere come in at the first course, before the king selven, 21\n\nBorehevedes that were bright, burnisht with silver\n\nAll with taught men and towen in togges full rich, 22\n\nOf sank real in suite, sixty at ones;\n\nFlesh flourisht of fermison, with frumentee noble, 23\n\nThere-to wild to wale, and winlich briddes,\n\nPacockes and plovers in platters of gold\n\nPigges of pork despine that pastured never;\n\nSithen herons in hedoyne heled full fair,\n\nGrete swannes full swithe in silveren chargeours, 24\n\nTartes of Turky, taste whom them likes;\n\nGumbaldes graithly, full gracious to taste;\n\nSenn bowes of wild bores with the brawn leched, 25\n\nBernakes and botoures in batterd dishes,\n\nThereby braunchers in bred, better was never,\n\nWith brestes of barrowes that bright were to shew;\n\nSenn come there sewes sere with solace thereafter,\n\nOwnde of azure all over and ardaunt them seemed; 26\n\nOf ilk a leche the lowe launched full high,\n\nThat all ledes might like that looked them upon;\n\nThen cranes and curlewes craftily rosted,\n\nConnies in cretoyne coloured full fair,\n\nFesauntes enflourished in flamand silver,\n\nWith darielles endorded and dainties ynow; 27\n\nThen Claret and Crete clergially rennen 28\n\nWith condethes full curious all of clene silver,\n\nOsay and Algarde and other ynow\n\nRhenish wine and Rochelle, richer was never,\n\nVernage of Venice, virtuous, and Crete,\n\nIn faucetes of fine gold, fonde who-so likes;\n\nThe kinges cup-bord was closed in silver,\n\nIn grete gobletes overgilt, glorious of hew; 29\n\nThere was a chef butler, a chevaler noble\n\nSir Kayous the courtais, that of the cup served;\n\nSixty cuppes of suite for the king selven,\n\nCrafty and curious, corven full fair,\n\nIn ever-ilk a party pight with precious stones,\n\nThat none enpoison sholde go privily there-under 30\n\nBut the bright gold for brethe sholde brist all to peces,\n\nOr else the venom sholde void through virtue of the stones;\n\nAnd the conquerour himselven, so clenly arrayed,\n\nIn colours of clene gold cledde, with his knightes,\n\nDressed with his diadem on his dese rich,\n\nFor he was deemed the doughtiest that dwelled in erthe.\n\nThen the conquerour kindly carped to those lordes,\n\nReheted the Romans with real speche:\n\n\"Sirs, bes knightly of countenaunce and comfortes yourselven;\n\nWe know nought in this countree of curious metes;\n\nIn these barrain landes breedes none other;\n\nForthy, withouten feining, enforce you the more 31\n\nTo feed you with such feeble as ye before find.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" says the senatour, \"so Crist mot me help,\n\nThere regned never such realtee within Rome walles!\n\nThere ne is prelate ne pope ne prince in this erthe\n\nThat he ne might be well payed of these pris metes!\"\n\nAfter their welth they wesh and went unto chamber,\n\nThis ilk kidd conquerour with knightes ynow;\n\nSir Gawain the worthy Dame Waynor he ledes,\n\nSir Owghtreth on tother side, of Turry was lord.\n\nThen spices unsparely they spended thereafter,\n\nMalvesy and Muskadell, those marvelous drinkes,\n\nRaiked full rathely in rosset cuppes 32\n\nTil all the rich on row, Romans and other.\n\nBut the soveraign soothly, for solace of himselven,\n\nAssigned to the senatour certain lordes\n\nTo lede to his levere, when he his leve askes,\n\nWith mirth and with melody of minstralsy noble.\n\nThen the conquerour to counsel kaires thereafter\n\nWith lordes of his legeaunce that to himself longes\n\nTo the Giauntes Towr jollily he wendes\n\nWith justices and judges and gentle knightes.\n\nSir Cador of Cornwall to the king carpes,\n\nLaugh on him lovely with likand lates; 33\n\n\"I thank God of that thro that thus us thretes!\n\nYou must be trailed, I trow, but yif ye tret better!\n\nThe lettres of Sir Lucius lightes mine herte.\n\nWe have as losels lived many long day\n\nWith delites in this land with lordshippes many\n\nAnd forlitened the los that we are laited.\n\nI
