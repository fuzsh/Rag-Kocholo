        "text": "Invader Zim\n\nPost by Tom O'Neill\n\nHi,\n\nI'm about to leave Sigil to visit Ravel. I don't need much help with\n\ncombat--Dak'kon, magician NTO, Morte, and 100 or so blood charms would\n\nprobably be enough for most anything. And I don't want to dilute\n\nexperience unnecessarily.\n\nthere's no such thing in this game. this is a game about character\n\ndevelopment, not just for TNO, also for the rest of the characters that can\n\njoin your party. the game would be much poorer if you left everyone behind\n\nbecause you wanted the XP. you'll get your XP either way.\n\nPost by Tom O'Neill\n\nSo my question is, would bringing Annah, Nordham, and/or\n\nFall-From-Grace along enrich the story going forward? E.g.,\n\nyes.\n\nPost by Tom O'Neill\n\n1) Do any of the characters provide access to interesting/important\n\nside-quests, dialogs, etc. going forward? E.g., Fall From Grace\n\nimplied it might be useful to fall in love with Annah.\n\nyeah, all of them do. this is also different depending on your alignment. if\n\nyou leave one char spot open when you enter ravel's maze, you'll get the\n\nopportunity to have Vhailor the mercykiller ghost join your party. both his\n\nand ignus's fate depend on your alignment.\n\nPost by Tom O'Neill\n\n2) Do I *need* Annah's thieving abilities? So far Dak'kon's bashing\n\nhas opened everything of interest. Any other special abilities I\n\nwould need?\n\nwhat do you mean by \"need\"? if you mean in combat, then no, this game isn't\n\nabout combat. if you mean in dialog and plot points, then yes. switching\n\nback and forth between being a thief, fighter and mage also brings out\n\nseveral subquests and extra dialogs and possibilities of learning extra\n\nspecial abilities etc, depending on who you talk with each respective class.\n\n-Invader Zim\n\nJames Garvin\n\nPost by Tom O'Neill\n\n1) Do any of the characters provide access to interesting/important\n\nside-quests, dialogs, etc. going forward? E.g., Fall From Grace\n\nimplied it might be useful to fall in love with Annah.\n\nhhmmmmm...most probably here. It depends on a few things, but it is\n\ncool to have them with you at some points.\n\nPost by Tom O'Neill\n\n2) Do I *need* Annah's thieving abilities? So far Dak'kon's bashing\n\nhas opened everything of interest. Any other special abilities I\n\nwould need?\n\nI liked Annah (if only for her REALLY sexy voice) and I really never\n\nlike Fall-From-Grace that much. Dak'kon is good to have and Morte is at\n\nleast going to get a job on Seinfeld. If you talk to any of your NPCs,\n\nthey can provide some insight into what is going on.\n\nPost by Tom O'Neill\n\nI'd prefer character names and general comments only, no spoilers.\n\nThanks!\n\nI tried to be general!"
