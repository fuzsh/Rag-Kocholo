        "text": "It's been 28 years since the iconic TV series Friends first aired.\n\nThe show, which originally aired on NBC, continues to be hugely popular, thanks to it being on Netflix and other streaming sites. The stars of show include the likes of Jennifer Anniston, Matt Le Blanc, Lisa Kudrow, Courtney Cox, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer.\n\nAll of them have gone on to become some of the most famous actors and actresses in the world. Although they have starred in some major Hollywood films and series, the six will probably always be best known for Friends.\n\nRead more: Alan Titchmarsh rewilding warning to Brits as he says it is 'catastrophic' for wildlife\n\nGeorge Clooney, Julia Roberts, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Robin Williams and Brad Pitt are all major names who made guest cameos on the show. By now, superfans pretty much know the script back to front and could tell you everything there is to know about the cast. However, did you know that one of the main cast members is from Yorkshire?\n\nWhile the six friends living in New York were the core of the show, characters like Gunther, Janice, Ursula, Janine, and Richard were a huge part of the show. And there are two other characters that pop up a lot thanks to their connection to Monica and Ross - Jack and Judy Geller.\n\nWho can forget their hilarious story lines from Monica hearing them have sex in a bathroom, to Ross' college marijuana confession, and their connection to Rachel and Chandler in flashback episodes. And, Judy's relationship with daughter Monica was a whirlwind to say the least.\n\nMonica and Ross' dad was played by Elliott Gould. The 84-year-old has continued to have success after Friends - starring in dozens of films and TV shows. Among his roles were Ezra Goldman in Showtime’s Ray Donovan and as a character known as Oscar in the Fox sitcom titled Mulaney.\n\nChristina Pickles' connection to Yorkshire\n\nJudy was played by Christina Pickles. In 1995 she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nIt is not widely known that Christina is from West Yorkshire. The 88-year-old was born in Halifax on February 17, 1935.\n\nThe actress is the daughter of the late Arthur Pickles, who was a Liberal politician and once Mayor of Halifax. Christina left Yorkshire at the age of 15; she moved to London and attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.\n\nShe was in classes with famous actors Albert Finney, Pete O'Toole, and Brian Bedford. After finishing her studies, she moved to New York City during the late 1950s.\n\nHer career began on stage, starring in a number of Shakespeare plays before making a name for herself on Broadway. Pickles' debut TV role was as Linell Conway in Guilding Light.\n\nThe actress, who has two children, went on to star in Another World, Seizure, Rush It, and St. Elsewhere, before she landing her role as Judy in Friends.\n\nShe later was a regular on The People Next Door, and also appeared in Family Ties, Who's the Boss?, In the Heat of the Night, Matlock, The Nanny, Murder, She Wrote, and Touched by an Angel.\n\nWhat did Christina do after her time on Friends?\n\nChristina Pickles has stayed rather busy since her time on Friends came to a close.\n\nThe actress starred in George of the Jungle, Atlas Shrugged: Part I, Live at the Foxes Den and a voice character in the 2008 animated film Immigrants. Pickles’ most notable television job since Friends was in Break a Hip, which ran between 2015 and 2018. She won an Emmy for Outstanding Actress in a Short Form Comedy or Drama Series for her work on Break A Hip.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, the actress' impressive portfolio extended as she appeared in a few episodes of How I Met Your Mother as Lily Aldrin's grandmother. She has also guest starred in The Division, Medium, and Children's Hospital.\n\nIn 2016, she was cast in the ABC drama pilot The Death Of Eva Sofia Valdez, starring Gina Torres in a title role."
