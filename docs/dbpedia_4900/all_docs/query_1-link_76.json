        "text": "“Cady McClain is masterful not only of her portrayal of Valentine but also of her distant husband, friend, and a half dozen other characters that she introduces the audience to in this not to be missed play.”\n\nLynn Martenstein - Cape May Star and Wave - Shirley Valentine\n\n​\n\n\"What a powerful production--Cady, you had me almost in tears many times. Was holding back as much as possible to not be a distraction to your performance! So grateful for your work. Please let me know about any other future productions and how I can support.\"\n\nEmiljana Ulaj - Westchester County Legislator, District 9\n\n​\n\n\"...flashes of wit and inventiveness, particularly surrounding Cady McClain’s Jackie Kennedy look-alike wife, make the… going worthwhile.”\n\n- Variety on Alma Mater\n\n​\n\n“Cady McClain’s performance was dignified and touching as the woman who helps Anderson fulfill his fantasies.”\n\n-The Daily News on The Red Address\n\n​\n\n“…the sublime and subdued Cady McClain plays her character with equal parts strength and vulnerability, giving her turn as a mother/psychologist the genuine pain of a mother intent on protecting her increasingly dangerous children.\n\nIf this woman can’t get more solid work in feature films after HOME MOVIE, then I’m not sure what’s going on. Many fine actresses have come from daytime sudsers including Julianne Moore, Meg Ryan and Marissa Tomei. I can see her becoming a much sought after character actress in film for years to come after this.”\n\n- Ryan Bruce Levy Montreal Fantasia Film Festival on Home Movie\n\nCady McClain has won three Emmys© for her roles on daytime television:\n\nin 1990 for Best Juvenile as \"Dixie Martin\" on All My Children; in 2002 for Best Supporting Actress as \"Rosanna Cabot\" on As the World Turns; and in 2021 for Best Guest Performer as \"Jennifer Horton\" on Days of Our Lives.\n\nMcClain's starring roles in independent films include Soldier’s Heart (Winner Best Narrative Film - GI Film Festival), Home Movie with Adrian Pasdar (released through IFC Midnight), Alma Mater with Alexander Chaplin and Will Lyman (Nominated for a Golden Starfish Award at the Hampton's Film Festival), Simple Justice with Doris Roberts and Cesar Romero (Directed by Deborah Del Prete), and Retreat with Michael E. Knight (Winner Wood's Hole Film Festival).\n\nTelevision credits include Law and Order SVU with Mariska Hargitay and Michael O'Keefe, Cheers with Woody Harrelson, and St. Elsewhere with Christina Pickles. She is a three-time Emmy© winner for her roles on All My Children (1991), As the World Turns (2004), and Days of Our Lives (2021) working with acting legends like Phillip Bosco, Tony Roberts, and Phyllis Somerville.\n\n​\n\nOther acting appearances include the award-winning web series Venice the Series and Switch, where she was proud to work with Olympia Dukakis.\n\nDuring her 25 years living in New York City, Ms. McClain enjoyed performing in historic theatrical productions Off-Broadway such as David Ives’ The Red Address at Second Stage, Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing at Lincoln Center Theater, A Comedy of Errors at the Hudson Guild, Barefoot in the Park at the Westbury and Valley Forge Music Fair and Quiet on the Set at the Westbeth.
