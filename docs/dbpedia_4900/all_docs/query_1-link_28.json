Rachel makes a dessert--with beef. Phoebe develops a crush on Mr. Geller. Joey and Ross can't wait for dinner to end so they can go to Janine's \"Thanksgiving with models\".\n\nThe One with All the Thanksgivings\n\nAlthough the Thanksgiving meal is great, Chandler is still moody over his parent's divorce during the holiday when he was a boy and Ross is depressed about his second divorce. The group reminisces about their worst Thanksgivings in order to cheer them up, and Monica's worst memory is revealed.\n\nThe One With The Princess Leia Fantasy\n\nRoss reveals a fantasy to Rachel involving a certain \"Star Wars\" character. Monica suffers from insomnia after her breakup with Richard. And Chandler, back together with Janice, wants Joey to bond with her."
