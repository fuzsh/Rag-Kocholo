And this time, I sat in the audience not only as an actor, but also as a producer.\"\n\nFriends for Life: \"My sixth nomination, for Friends, was especially gratifying. The role of Mrs. Geller, mother of Monica [Courteney Cox] and Ross [David Schwimmer], resonates with so many people, was expertly crafted and so very well written. I still get stopped for it all the time.\"\n\nMirror, Mirror: \"I keep the Emmy on the mantelpiece in front of the mirror so she can see herself. It inspires me. It reminds me how over the years I've been able to continue to be creative. And to be appreciated by the Television Academy and my peers is a precious acknowledgment.\"\n\nWords of Wisdom: \"I hesitate to give advice. Everyone has her own journey. But I guess I am a giant example of never giving up... no matter what!\"\n\nGiving Thanks: \"I've always wanted to play parts that help illuminate the human condition: a nurse raising children and working full time on St. Elsewhere, and now Biz in Break a Hip, an older woman trying to hold on to her apartment and avoid an old-age home. Finding the humor in her struggle is the ultimate gift.\n\nI'm so lucky! And luck has a lot to do with it â€” as well as sensational writing and directing by Cameron Watson and a dream cast with the likes of Allison Janney, Octavia Spencer, Peri Gilpin and Jim Rash.\"\n\nClick for more Me and My Emmy articles."
