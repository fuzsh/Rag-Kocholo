        "text": "Friends \"On Location\": London\n\nTrascribed by: Caio\n\nVisit the \"Friends Super Page\"\n\nTranscribers note: This is a short documentary that is available on the \"Best of Friends volume 2\", and contains a lot changes of quick interview parts, so that's why you may notice the short lines. Each different actor, is interviewed in a different place, but as it doesn't change in any way the outcome of the documentary, I didn't find it necessary to be described.\n\n[Shows clips of the filming, and of London]\n\nMatthew Perry: When you get the opportunity to, even go on location in Los Angeles, that's exciting. But much less have your whole crew, and everybody come out to, uh, \"jolly old England\". It's, uh, it's really, really exciting.\n\nJennifer Aniston: Just the idea of, bringing our entire \"family\" over here, is like, it's wild.\n\nDavid Schwimmer: Yeah! London baby! It's amazing, I mean, how many people are, are excited about the show.\n\nCourteney Cox: I knew how big the show was over here. It played a lot on television. I mean, I- I think I saw it 3 times in one week.\n\nChristina Pickles (Judy Geller): They're very popular at, at home. But I didn't know they would be as popular here.\n\nHelen Baxendale (Emily Waltham): It's got a massive following here in Britain. And, uh, particulary among my generation.\n\nFan: It's quite sarcastic... so, that's probably why it's popular.\n\nElliot Gould (Jack Geller): We have great, uh, English character actors, working with us. And an opportunity to interact with the English crew.\n\nTom Conti (Steven Waltham): (sitting next to Jennifer Saunders \"Andrea Waltham\") We're the in-laws. We're about to be Ross' in-laws. We're the Brits that you love to hate.\n\nMatt LeBlanc: We had, uh, Sarah Ferguson. We worked with her this morning. It was great, and she was funny.\n\nSarah Ferguson, Dutchess of York (\"fergie\"): I was really excited to be here today, you know, cause it's the first time I've ever done anything like this and I really enjoyed it.\n\nJune Whitfield (the Housekeeper): I am a great fan. I think they are all marvelous.\n\nJennifer Saunders: Most brittish people were trying to hate them for being beautiful and funny.\n\nHugh Laurie (guy on the plane): I just got a phone call: \"Very small part, couple of lines, do you wanna do it? ...Sitting next to Jennifer Aniston.\". And I went : \"Oh, wait a minute, do I wanna sit next to... oh ok then (sarcastic)\"\n\nTom Conti: It's basically a \"let's kick the Brits' upper butt\" episode, really.\n\nDavid Schwimmer: You'll see, uh, uh a lot of comedy... a lot of Romance and a lot of surprises... so it's, it's ... and you get to see England \"woo-hoo!\" (gives thumbs up)\n\nElliot Gould: Call the Queen, mom. Tell her that you enjoy watching \"Friends\", and that you know us. And she'll have you over for tea... like (snaps fingers) that.\n\n[Shows clips of the filming]"
