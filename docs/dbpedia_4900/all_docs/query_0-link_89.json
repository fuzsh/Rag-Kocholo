        "text": "created, written and directed by Cameron Watson\n\n​\n\nProduced by\n\nMaggie Biggar Steve Cubine Mason McCulley Christina Pickles Cameron Watson\n\nThe series is based on a film script I wrote called LONELY ON THE MOON. The actual story is based on my personal experience as a young actor in Hollywood. I was hired by an older, English actress who lived in a one room studio in the heart of Hollywood by herself. Her husband was dead, all of her friends were dead, and she had no one. I drove her to the market and to do errands and would make sure she had everything she needed and she would pay me what she called “mad money.” And I needed that mad money at the time. She was a lovely, complicated woman. And she was alone and frightened. And that often came out as mean. I loved her deeply and she taught me a lot. We developed a very strong dependency on each other and the absurdity of our adventures together are what inspired the script. Cameron Watson\n\nThe HIPster Team\n\n​\n\nMAGGIE BIGGAR Maggie Biggar began her career in the film industry project managing the AFI’s esteemed documentary VISIONS OF LIGHT: THE ART OF CINEMATOGRAPHY.
