        "text": "Friends - Season 1-10 Complete Collection (15th Anniversary) | DVD | (28/09/2009) from £48.37 | Saving you £-8.38 (N/A%) | RRP £39.99\n\nThe complete collection of every episode of classic Big Apple sitcom Friends.\n\nFriends: Complete Series 9 - New Edition | DVD | (25/10/2004) from £9.90 | Saving you £41.09 (415.05%) | RRP £50.99\n\nNine years is a long time for any group of Friends to stick so closely together, but somehow the gang are still as daftly charming as ever. After the birth of Emma, Rachel comes to terms with being a mother surprisingly well. It's how everyone else deals with it that makes things interesting. Joey's accidental proposal creates weird friction between him and Ross, who breaks his finger throwing the show's first ever punch. Monica becomes desperately broody and attempts all manner of convoluted ways of persuading Chandler to father a child (unfortunately he inadvertently bankrupts them in a move to Tulsa!). Phoebe, on the other hand, occupies herself in the dating game, holding on to Mike (Paul Rudd) in the longest guest-star relationship anyone's ever had. Other surprise guests this year include Freddie Prinze Jr as an overly sensitive nanny (in the 200th episode), Christina Applegate as another of Rachel's sisters and Jeff Goldblum playing himself on the set of another movie on which Joey is trying to get a break. As always the sparks occasionally fly between Rachel and Ross, while the others manage to strain their own relationships to the max. The real reason for watching now is the one-off kooky scenarios in which they--or rather Joey--get into. His endless dating finally sees him stuck for remembering if he's already slept with a girl; he botches an attempt at eyebrow waxing; and he manages to make Chandler think Monica's after a breast enhancement. --Paul Tonks\n\nFriends: Complete Series 7 - New Edition | DVD | (25/10/2004) from £7.09 | Saving you £45.16 (774.61%) | RRP £50.99\n\nThe complete seventh series in one box set!

The One With The Wedding (Feature length special episode)\n\nFriends: Complete Series 10 - New Edition | DVD | (25/10/2004) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £50.99\n\nAfter ten years and ten series of comic catastrophes it's time to bid farewell to the six chums with the very final fantastic collection of episodes of 'Friends'! 1. The One After Joey And Rachel Kiss 2. The One Where Ross Is Fine 3. The One With Ross's Tan 4. The One With The Cake 5. The One Where Rachel's Sister Babysits 6. The One With Ross's Grant 7.

The Last One - Part 2\n\nFriends: Complete Series 8 - New Edition | DVD | (25/10/2004) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £50.99\n\nThe eighth season of Friends picks up just moments after Monica and Chandler said, \"I do.\" But the focus of this season is firmly on Rachel's pregnancy, as the story progresses from fatherhood revelations in \"The One with the Red Sweater\" and \"The One Where Rachel Tells...\" toward complicated new feelings for Rachel, Ross, and Joey, culminating in the maternity ward two-parter \"The One Where Rachel Has a Baby.\" But it's not all Rachel's pregnancy story. Standalone highlights include \"The One with the Rumor\" in which the \"We Hate Rachel\" club started in high school by Ross and a certain Mr. Jennifer Aniston (an uncredited Brad Pitt) is revealed; while \"The One with Monica's Boots\" has Monica and Chandler arguing over finances when Phoebe and Ross are arguing over the attentions of Sting's wife, Trudie Styler (cameoing as herself). Relationship complications fall upon Phoebe as \"The One with the Tea Leaves\" hooks her up with a stellar cameo from Alec Baldwin. \"The One with Joey's Interview\" has Matt LeBlanc in top form preparing to be interviewed by Soap Opera Digest. But time starts to tick faster for everyone in \"The One Where Rachel Is Late,\" as Joey's WWI movie finally arrives, but is overshadowed by the wait for Rachel's overdue arrival. Naturally it's all build-up to the cliffhanger finale and a final emotional surprise. --Paul Tonks\n\nLegends of the Fall - Collectors Edition | DVD | (30/10/2000) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £19.99\n\nA box-office hit when released in 1994, this sprawling, frequently overwrought familial melodrama may get sillier as its plot progresses, but it's the kind of lusty, character-based epic that Hollywood should attempt more often. It's also an unabashedly flattering star vehicle for Brad Pitt as Tristan--the rebellious middle son of a fiercely independent Montana rancher and military veteran (Anthony Hopkins)--who is routinely at odds with his more responsible older brother, Alfred (Aidan Quinn), and younger brother, Samuel (Henry Thomas). From the battlefields of World War I to his adventures as an oceangoing sailor, Tristan's life is full of personal torment, especially when he returns to Montana and finds himself competing with Alfred over Samuel's beautiful widow (Julia Ormond), whose passion for Tristan disrupts the already turbulent Ludlow clan. Under the wide-open canopy of Big Sky country, this operatic tale unfolds with all the bloodlust, tragedy, and scenery-chewing performances you'd expect to find in a hokey bestselling novel (in fact, it's based on the acclaimed novella by Jim Harrison), but it's a potent mix that's highly entertaining. Not surprisingly, John Toll won an Academy Award for his breathtaking outdoor cinematography. --Jeff Shannon\n\nFriends: Complete Series 1 - New Edition | DVD | (25/10/2004) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £49.99\n\nThis handsome box set includes all the episodes from Series One--from our favourite coffee-drinking sextet's initial meeting in the pilot right up to the series cliff-hanger \"The One Where Rachel Finds Out\"--that Ross is in love with her, that is. Other highlights include: \"The One With the Butt\", in which Joey gets a big break as Al Pacino's stunt bottom; \"The One With the Monkey\" in which Ross acquires Marcel, his pet monkey; and the two-parter (imaginatively called \"The One with the Two Parts\") in which Joey starts dating Ursula, Phoebe's twin sister and Monica and Rachel double-date cute doctors played by George Clooney and Noah Wyle from ER. --Leslie Felperin\n\nFriends: Complete Series 3 - New Edition | DVD | (25/10/2004) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £49.99\n\nSeemingly low-key but as wittily crafted as the first two series, this season develops minor characters--Gunther, Central Perk's proprietor, who is in love with Rachel; Phoebe's half-brother Frank (played by rising-star Giovanni Ribisi); the chick and duck--who will play key parts later on while the foundations for crucial story lines developed in Series 4 are laid down. The most momentous story arc covers Rachel and Ross splitting up when she suggests they take a \"break\" and he sleeps with the girl from the copy shop. Phoebe gets to know her little brother Frank who falls in love with the much-older Alice, for whom Phoebe will bear triplets in a later series. Monica pines after Richard and then starts dating the millionaire Pete, although towards the end Chandler is trying to persuade her he's good boyfriend material--clearly an omen of things to come. --Leslie Felperin\n\nFriends: Complete Series 2 - New Edition | DVD | (25/10/2004) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £49.99\n\nArguably the best series, this season's episodes really developed the characters as the show's popularity took off. Love is in the air as Rachel and Ross, both finally realising they're attracted to each other, nearly get it together, don't, and then finally do. Joey gets that role as Dr Drake Ramoray in Days of Our Lives and moves out of the flat he shares with Chandler, precipitating a bust-up between the two best buddies. Monica dates Richard, the hunky, older eye-doctor played by Tom Selleck, and Phoebe makes a video of that seminal song for a generation, \"SmellyCat\". --Leslie Felperin\n\nThe Wedding Singer | DVD | (01/10/1999) from £7.80 | Saving you £15.18 (315.59%) | RRP £19.99\n\nDon't just think of The Wedding Singer as an Adam Sandler comedy--though it most certainly is that. But also think of it as the tip of the wave of the 1980s nostalgia craze that followed on the heels of the 1970s nostalgia craze. Set in the post-disco, new wave era, the film tells the story of Robbie Hart (Sandler), the king of small-town wedding-band singers, who once dreamt of being a rock star. But his contentment with life shatters when his fiancée stands him up at the altar. After wallowing in self-pity (by musically attacking the next wedding couple he serenades) and swearing off women, he helps a new friend, Julia (Drew Barrymore), get ready for her impending nuptials--only to find himself falling in love with her. If you're a Sandler fan, you'll enjoy him as an actual adult, though a wise-cracking one. And dig all those kooky 80s reference jokes and that greatest-hits-of-early-MTV soundtrack. --Marshall Fine\n\nFriends: Complete Series 6 - New Edition | DVD | (25/10/2004) from £4.55 | Saving you £46.70 (1,419.45%) | RRP £49.99\n\nAlways there for you, the hit sitcom Friends has matured and blossomed over the years. The beginning of the sixth series finds the sextet back from Las Vegas where Ross and Rachel managed to get married in a state of pronounced intoxication, thus upstaging the intended nuptials of Chandler and Monica. The first half of the season follows Ross' failure to arrange the annulment, while Monica and Chandler move in together and Rachel sets up house with Phoebe. Joey gets a shapely new roommate in the shape of Elle Macpherson. Halfway through the series, we are given a wonderful fantasy peak at a parallel universe where Rachel married Barry after all, Ross' wife Carol never realised she was gay, Monica is still fat, Chandler is a writer, Joey is starring as Dr Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives and Phoebe is a stockbroker. The closing arc of the series features a guest appearance from Bruce Willis in two episodes as the father of Ross' new girlfriend Elizabeth--who ends up romancing Rachel. --Leslie Felperin\n\nLegends of the Fall | DVD | (11/06/2007) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £5.99\n\nColonel William Ludlow (Sir Anthony Hopkins) built a ranch in the remote foothills of the Montana Rockies where he brought up his three sons away from the carnage of the Indian wars. Alfred (Aidan Quinn) the eldest is dutiful and reserved Samuel (Henry Thomas) the beloved youngest is compassionate and idealistic while the middle brother Tristan (Brad Pitt) has a wild untameable spirit. Into this masculine world enters Susannah Finncannon (Julia Ormond) a beautiful intelligent woman who stirs a passion and rivalry in all three brothers that will change the course of their lives and shape their destinies forever. From the rugged prairie lands of 19th Century America to the trenches of World War I and the changing world beyond 'Legends of the Fall' is a sweeping star-studded epic - a passionate journey into the darkest secrets of love betrayal and the unbreakable bonds of blood.\n\nMasters Of The Universe | DVD | (16/06/2003) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £15.99\n\nHe-Man Eternia's most powerful warrior defends the honour of the future paradise from the hideous Skeletor and his wicked ally Evil-Lyn. Skeletor has imprisoned the Sorceress of Greyskull Castle in a power-absorbing energy field. The only way to free her and stop Skeletor ruling the Kingdom lies in using the Cosmic Key. However the key has been lost on Earth through a dimensional time-warp and discovered by two Californian teenagers. He-Man must find it before Skeletor's top inter-galactic mercenaries or else nothing will save Eternia from a dark millennium...\n\nFriends: Complete Series 5 - New Edition | DVD | (25/10/2004) from £6.49 | Saving you £44.76 (855.83%) | RRP £49.99\n\nWith Friends like these, you'll never need to go out again. Picking up from the momentous events of Series 4, this season starts out with Monica and Chandler in some awkward positions as they try to keep their blossoming romance a secret from the others. By the series' end they'll be planning to get married in Las Vegas, where Joey is working as a gladiator at Caesar's Palace casino, his big movie break having fallen through. The embers of Rachel and Ross's relationship continue to send up sparks, especially when Emily causes strife early on by insisting Ross never has contact with Rachel ever again. Phoebe finally meets her father and starts dating a cop named Gary. It all climaxes with everyone in Las Vegas, where Monica and Chandler's impromptu decision to wed is upstaged by a surprising event. --Leslie Felperin\n\nFriends: Complete Series 1 - 10 | DVD | (02/10/2006) from £86.99 | Saving you £113.00 (129.90%) | RRP £199.99\n\nAll the episodes from all ten series complete in one box set.\n\nFriends - Series 10 - Vol. 4 | DVD | (07/06/2004) from £5.99 | Saving you £1.00 (14.30%) | RRP £6.99\n\nThe fourth volume of episodes from the tenth series of the smash hit sitcom. Episode titles: The One Where Joey Speaks French The One With Princess Consuela The One Where Estelle Dies The One With Rachel's Going Away Party.\n\nGeorge Of The Jungle 2 | DVD | (18/08/2003) from £12.89 | Saving you £8.09 (81.72%) | RRP £17.99\n\nAlthough direct-to-video Disney sequels usually try to hide or simply ignore the issue, George of the Jungle 2 gleefully points out the lack of continuity between it and the original movie. Here, the good-natured narrator is happy to explain why Brendan Fraser has been replaced and why the special effects look cheaper: it's all a part of an effort to expand beyond the one-joke idea of a block-headed Tarzan who keeps swinging into trees. It's a pleasant surprise that all these self-referential nods and asides to the camera do indeed make hilarious viewing. Replacement Chris Showerman willingly takes on all manner of humiliation at the hands of CG jungle animals and his new extended family. George junior is the main by-product of the five-year gap, and thankfully has inherited brains from his mother's side (Julie Benz). In a dastardly plot to win back his love, Lyle (Thomas Haden Church, one of the few to reprise his role from the original) has the gang trooping back and forth to Las Vegas. With sight gags aplenty, bumbling George has more than just trees to avoid. --Paul Tonks\n\nFriends: Series 10 (Vol. 5) | DVD | (07/06/2004) from £6.16 | Saving you £0.83 (11.90%) | RRP £6.99\n\nIn the first eight episodes of Season 10 of Friends we have seen Joey and Rachel get it together and then separate Ross come unstuck at the tanning booth Emma's chaotic first birthday party the time-honoured Friends Thanksgiving meal and Phoebe receive a marriage proposal. But how does it all end ...? Contains the final episode ever of Friends: The Last One (Part 2)\n\nFriends - Series 1 - Episodes 1-8 | DVD | (27/10/2003) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £6.99\n\nSeason 1: When the first series of Friends debuted in September 1994, it was immediately obvious there would be no need for the show to find its feet. \"The One Where Monica Gets a Roommate\" was a confident introduction to the six lead characters, opening in the middle of an everyday conversation with the soon-to-be uncharacteristic line: \"There's nothing to tell\". In fact, the soap opera-style plot got complicated pretty quickly, with spoiled brat Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) moving on from her failed wedding to feelings toward nerdy/heartthrob Ross (David Schwimmer). However, no love life was more complicated than Joey's (Matt LeBlanc), with an endless stream of girlfriends that annoyed the hell out of wisecracking roommate Chandler (Matthew Perry), who only seemed to be able to connect with Janice (Maggie Wheeler), the shrillest voice in the city. Bouncing all manner of neuroses around them were Ross' obsessive sister Monica (Courteney Cox) and endearingly ditzy Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow). Premise established, Series 1 matured the characters by providing a monkey and a son for Ross. We met also meet Ross and Monica's parents Jack (Elliott Gould) and Judy (Christina Pickles), Chandler's mother (Morgan Fairchild) and Phoebe's twin sister Ursula (Kudrow, naturally). Fans loved cameos from George Clooney, Jay Leno and show creators Kevin Bright, Marta Kauffman and David Crane. But really the focus was on building to \"T.O.W. Rachel Finds Out\" that Ross is in love with her. --Paul Tonks\n\nThe Wedding Singer | DVD | (29/05/2006) from £10.32 | Saving you £2.67 (20.60%) | RRP £12.99\n\nIt's 1985 and Robbie Hart (Sandler) is a wedding singer who can cover the hits deliver the perfect toast and even get Grandma on the dance floor. But when Robbie is dumped at his own wedding he has a total eclipse of the heart and becomes the ultimate cynic. It's not until he meets a waitress named Julia (Barrymore) that Robbie starts to come around. However Julia's about to get married herself and unless Robbie can pull off the performance of a lifetime the girl of his dreams m"
