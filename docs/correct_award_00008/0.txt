Executive summary: Why the sky is blue

British physicist and mathematician Lord Rayleigh discovered the inert gas argon (Ar) in 1895, which earned him the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physics. His colleague in this research, Sir William Ramsay, won the same year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Born John William Strutt, he became Lord Rayleigh the Third Baron of Terling Place at the death of his father in 1873, and did much of his research in a private laboratory on the family estate. His 1871 Theory of Scattering was the first scientific work to correctly explain why the sky is blue, and his two-volume The Theory of Sound clarified the mechanics of vibration and acoustic wave propagation.

He studied under George Gabriel Stokes, was a distant relative of Robert Boyle, and his students included George Paget Thomson and J. J. Thomson. His brother-in-law, Arthur Balfour, was Prime Minister of England from 1902-05. Lord Rayleigh succeeded James Clerk Maxwell as Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge in 1879 but remained at this post for only five years before returning to his mansion and secluded lab. He also worked to establish absolute standards for the ohm and other scientific measurements, and served as President of the paranormal research group Society for Psychical Research.
