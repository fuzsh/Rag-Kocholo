In addition to many copies of original items, most of the collection has also been microfilmed. Also within this collection are the publications and manuscripts of Robert John Strutt, the 4th Baron Rayleigh, and manuscripts about the collection, most of which were written by or to John Howard, Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory (AFCRL), Chief Scientist, 1966-1976\n\nThis collection contains materials pertaining to the professional career of John William Strutt, Third Baron Rayleigh, and his son, Robert John Strutt, Fourth Baron Rayleigh. There is a complete set of John William Strutt's experimental notebooks that pertain to his scientific papers and other topics he researched. Published scientific papers written by Lord Rayleigh regarding light, waves, currents, and acoustics are also included. Additionally, the collection contains rough notes and calculations pertaining to Strutt's scientific papers; copies of scientific correspondence written to and from Lord Rayleigh; and correspondence between Lord Rayleigh and Lord Ramsay regarding their research and discovery of Argon. There is also a series of unpublished notes, calculations, and lectures written by Lord Rayleigh within the collection. Finally, there are numerous letters and papers, most of which were written by or to John Howard, Chief Scientist at AFCRL, regarding the Rayleigh Collection and dedication of the collection at AFCRL\n\nJohn William Strutt, the Third Baron Rayleigh, an English physicist, was born in Terling, Essex, in 1842. He attended Cambridge University and in 1879 became professor of experimental physics there and director of its Cavendish Laboratory until 1884. He later was on the faculty at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, became chancellor of Cambridge University, and was a founder of the National Physics Laboratory in Teddington, England. Strutt, who with Lord William Ramsey, discovered the first rare atmospheric gas, argon, was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1904. He is also credited with explaining why the sky is blue (Rayleigh scattering) and predicting the existence of surface waves (Rayleigh waves). Lord Rayleigh died in Witham, Essex in 1919\n\nNon-circulating\n\nInventory available in library; folder level control\n\nRelated Resources"
