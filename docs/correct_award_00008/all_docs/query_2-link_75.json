        "text": "inert 1. Adjective\n\nSomeone or something that does not move at all\n\nIn one sense, given its demonstrably rooted constancy, the long-held country house could perhaps be seen to exemplify this definition as offered by Collins English Dictionary. Some such places may, indeed, also qualify thus:\n\ninert 2. Adjective\n\nNot very lively or interesting\n\nOne estate of which this certainly cannot be said, however, is Terling Place, eight miles north-east of Chelmsford, not least because of its singular association with\n\ninert 3. Adjective [technical]\n\nA substance which does not react with other substances .. gases like argon.\n\nBeing one of the few houses in Essex which is still owned by the family of its builder, Terling (pro. Tarling) is remarkable enough but in 1904 its then squire John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh, would be awarded the Nobel Prize for physics. Nine years earlier Rayleigh – to the incredulity of some in the scientific community – had conclusively identified a new periodic element, named argon, after years of experimentation in his homemade laboratory above the stables at Terling Place.\n\n‘The last of the great polymaths of physical science,’ born of a barely educated teenaged mother, the endlessly questing Rayleigh was something of a freak in the Strutt family lineage.1 Less so his son the 4th baron, a distinguished physicist in his own right, ‘the first to prove the existence of ozone in the atmosphere’.2 Life has been more than a gas at private Terling Place, however, a house which (in addition to the preserved laboratory) features an interior reckoned ‘one of the most accomplished if least-known monuments of the Greek Revival in domestic architecture’ and whose estate was pre-eminent in the advancement and ubiquity of a livestock breed emblematic of British farming in the 20th century.3\n\nMarch 20, 2022 will mark the 250th anniversary of the laying of the first white brick in the construction of Grade II* listed Terling Place, a moment which itself symbolized the rise of the Strutt family from entrepreneurial artisan millers to bona fide landed gentry. Over the course of the 17th century successive John Strutts had developed their operations around the river Chelmer: ‘At one time or another most of the water-mills between Chelmsford and [estuary port] Maldon were in Strutt possession.’4\n\nEstablishing a family business tradition, all profits so derived would be invested in purchasing land around and about. In the 1720s, John Strutt relocated to Terling, an ‘especially attractive village with a large number of picturesque [15th and 16th-century] timber-framed houses’, having purchased several farms in the parish.5 Precisely why Strutt ‘chose Terling for his home is not known, but it is probably safe to say that his descendants have never regretted his choice’.6\n\nAfter the death of his childless namesake son the accumulating family fortune would pass to Strutt’s nephew, another John, who was evidently only too keen embrace the family’s upwardly-mobile status. ‘On being asked what profession he proposed to follow, young Strutt is said to have answered that he intended to be a gentleman, and that his father and uncle must find him the means. This they ultimately did.’6\n\nAfter his marriage in 1756 Strutt and his wife lived for a time in a fine Georgian house in Chelmsford. But some four years later the final substantial piece of the Terling jigsaw became available. Though his family had quickly become dominant landholders, the manor of Terling itself and its associated 850-acre farm were the possession of Sir Matthew Fetherstonhaugh. The absentee baronet was then in the process of adding to the splendours of his principal seat, Uppark in Sussex, and proved amenable to John Strutt’s offer of £18,500 for his Essex outpost.\n\nThe couple now moved into the Parsonage House on Terling village green and ‘his correspondence shows that for the next ten years John Strutt (left) was trying to make up his mind where and how to build himself a permanent home’.6 He would be regularly hectored in this agreeable quandry by his county friends, Bamber Gascoyne (of Bifrons, Barking; sometime MP for Maldon) and Thomas Bramston of Skreens, an estate a dozen or so miles west of Terling. But a decade on still no decision had been made.\n\nIn February 1770 Gascoyne informed Strutt of the impending visit of landscape designer Nathaniel Richmond to Skreens, suggesting he might take the opportunity to at last ‘fix the site of your intended new house’. Richmond may or may not have been decisive in the eventual siting of Terling Place south of the church – he would be responsible for the evolution of its park over the next several years – but Strutt certainly seems to have been persuaded by Bramston’s recommendation of an architect recently employed at Skreens.7\n\nLeicester-born John Johnson had made good as a high-end property developer in London and was now following the money into the surrounding shires. He was, Bramston informed his friend, “exceedingly honest, cheap and ingenious – what would you more?”8\n\nJohnson was duly handed his first complete country house commission and after design revisions building at last commenced in March 1772 (↑). ‘Predominantly a rectangular block of three storeys and seven bays, in a restrained neo-classical style, the south-east entrance front [carried] a large pediment above the three central bays,’ while a two-storey service wing extended in rear.9 ‘John Strutt and his wife had a picnic dinner at the house on Christmas Day, [moving] into temporary quarters and some attic bedrooms on 26 November, 1773.’8\n\nSubject to significant remodelling half-a-century later, the drawing room at Terling ‘is the only room by Johnson that survives substantially intact, its plasterwork ceiling (left) decorated with four ovals incorporating female figures suspended from ribbon ties’.5 Terling Place was completed in 1775, ‘the total cost excluding furniture estimated at £6,045 10s 5¼d’.8\n\nIn the previous year, the bumptious urgings of Bamber Gascoyne (‘something of a rough diamond in the polite world of 18th century society’, a likeness of whom resides among the portraits by Zoffany and others at Terling) had prodded John Strutt to further prominence, the new squire now being elected a member of parliament for Maldon. (‘Strutt and his son would represent the borough without a break for the next 52 years.’)\n\nThe Strutts’ intended heir, eldest son John, became ill during his first year up at Oxford. In October 1779 the couple (more in hope than expectation) waved him off from Falmouth in fretful silence, optimistically bound for remedial Portugese climes. His body would be returned from Lisbon just a month later.\n\n*\n\nA decade on, the marriage of second son Joseph to Lady Catherine Fitzgerald, a daughter of the 1st duke of Leinster, represented another social step-change, one which would prompt significant development at Terling Place in the wake of his succession in 1816. (Two years prior, an anonymous letter writer had threatened to hasten the old squire’s demise unless he provided more work locally: “We will burn down Terling Hall just to make a beginning. If there’s not great alterations within 3 weeks we insist of murdering John Strutt.” Strutt died of natural causes in his 98th year).1o\n\nThe widescreen magnificence of the Duke of Leinster’s seat, Carton House in Co. Kildare, appears to have induced something of an architectural inferiority complex in his son-in-law, soon engaging the services of Thomas Hopper (fashionable through an association with Prince Regent) who wrought extensive change at Terling Place, inside and out.\n\nMost conspicuously, ‘low two-storey wings east and west swept back at an oblique angle, ending in little temple fronts in antis with pediments’.5 Although both wings appeared to connect through to the original house, the west wing was in fact joined by a solid wall and entirely self-contained, a detail which would prove critically advantageous a century on.\n\nThese outstretching arms pulled towards a new Tuscan entrance porch on the north side (↓), the house having been effectively ‘turned round’.\n\nArchitectural details added to the new garden facade included, at the owner’s suggestion, attached Ionic columns at first floor level.9\n\n(Curiously, Terling would now more closely resemble original architect John Johnson’s most noted public building, Chelmsford Shire Hall, created during his 30-year tenure as County Surveyor of Essex, an office also subsequently held by Hopper for four decades from 1812.)\n\nTrumping the lateral expansion of Terling Place, Thomas Hopper’s most arresting statement lay within, the former staircase hall now replaced by a double-height, shallow-domed saloon. Beneath its first-floor cast iron gallery and yellow marble-effect columns runs a full-scale plaster cast frieze based upon the most exciting recent addition to the collection at the British Museum, the Elgin marbles.\n\nSoon after the Parthenon treasures had been acquired in 1816, sculptor Richard Westmacott negotiated ‘a private arrangement to create and sell moulds and [perfected] casts from them,’ available to select wealthy patrons.11 Terling’s saloon remains ‘a perfect neo-Greek room of its date’.5 ‘All the door cases on both floors are of beautifully marbleised wood.’12 Elsewhere, ‘a new dining room was formed left of the saloon, nearer to the kitchens in the east wing’, Johnson’s former such space now being enlarged to create a library.9\n\nWork on the house was finally completed in 1824, the year in which estate labourers tasked with laying a new drive across the park struck gold in the form of earthenware pots containing several hundred Roman coins (c.5th century) and assorted items of jewellery. “The rings are as perfect and Nice as if they came this minute out of a trinket box,” Terling’s estate steward Robert Ellis reported to his boss in London. Alas, he was also obliged to report some less than perfect behaviour on the part of the workers, apologising that “the Men did not give all they found up to me. I find now they sold some few [pieces] as low as three for sixpence on Saturday”.13\n\nMidway through Joseph Strutt’s remodelling of his birthright the family’s ascendancy was confirmed with granting of a peerage, though not, unusually, to Strutt himself but to his wife. ‘Conceited and smug, under a cloak of false humility, [Strutt had] vainly pestered successive Tory ministries on the strength of his own and his father’s electoral and militia services in Essex’. Persistence was at last rewarded in 1821 with the Barony of Rayleigh: “I had through life declined personal honour and it was granted as I requested, in the person of your mother,” a decision, he later explained to his daughters, “I have lived long enough to repent of.” For the arrangement would in time give his heir ‘precedence of rank over him’, an indignity which fairly put a top hat on the long-strained relationship between father and son.\n\nHaving been an archetypal Regency buck in his early adulthood, John James Strutt’s lifestyle took a pivotal turn in his late twenties which saw him ‘converted from a rake to an evangelical religious maniac‘, thereafter regularly butting heads with his father at Terling Place. One particularly testy (if obscure) disagreement festered between 1824-5: ‘[Even] though for the great part of the time father and son were living under the same roof all communication on the subject of the dispute was by letter and ran to about 100,000 words, though anyone reading them [today] would find it hard to say what the argument was about.’6\n\n(More constructively, John James would channel his fervent Christianity into incentivising the villagers of Terling towards a more wholesome and productive way of living, not least through his early adoption of the principles which would drive the allotment movement.)\n\nIn their later years Joseph Strutt and his wife spent more and more time away from Terling, ostensibly for health reasons, residing mostly in Bath (where Baroness Rayleigh died in 1836 and her husband likewise in 1845). ‘Strutt had the mortification of seeing his son seated in the Lords’ before a rapprochement of sorts would develop after the 45-year-old 2nd Baron Rayleigh’s belated marriage, albeit to a teenaged girl who lacked both money and education. And this unlikely union would turn more remarkable still, for it would beget genius.\n\n*\n\nOf dispossessed minor gentry transplanted from Ireland to Essex, 17-year-old Clara Vicars, now Lady Rayleigh, chatelaine of Terling Place, produced a son and heir precisely nine months after her wedding in 1842. More sons were to follow, the ebb and flow of Clara’s siblings further enlivening the scene in the revitalised Strutt household. The couple would also effect physical change: a modish (but undistinguished, and recently demolished) conservatory now gave access to the west wing from the main block, wherein Johnson’s original drawing room received redecoration. (Hailed ‘a magnificent apartment’ later that century14, this particular intervention has come to be viewed as ‘regrettable’.12) More successfully, the formal Italianate garden is also of this mid-19th century era.\n\n‘Lord Rayleigh rarely went anywhere, staying at Terling Place and busying himself with estate affairs, the benign despot of his parish.’6 During his father’s stewardship the family domain had expanded by a further ‘2,330 acres at a cost of £103,000, drawn entirely from savings’.\n\nIn 1868 Terling experienced a serious typhoid epidemic in the wake of which Rayleigh ‘set about to engineer a new water supply for the village’, a problem-solving instinct which was to characterise, albeit on an altogether more esoteric plane, the stellar scientific career of his first-born.15\n\nAfter a peripatetic, illness-plagued schooling followed by a brilliant passage through Cambridge, restlessly inquisitive John William’s star was certainly in ascendance by the time of his father’s death in 1873, 27-year-old Strutt being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society that same year. Two years earlier he had married Evelyn Balfour, sister of one future prime minister and related to another, the couple now moving into Terling Place where they quickly set about converting the west wing into what ‘would eventually become one of the largest private laboratories in Britain’.15\n\nCovering predominantly the fields of acoustics, optics, and hydrodynamics, the 3rd Lord Rayleigh ‘was always at his best when faced by a puzzle’. Throughout a prolific career (which saw the publication of over 450 papers), ‘Rayleigh demonstrated an uncanny ability to derive effective results from a judicious combination of theory and experimentation, the latter seemingly simple in design but never failing to get at the heart of the matter’.1\n\nScientific activity dominated life at Terling Place, estate workers being prevailed upon to render requisite bits of laboratory kit while ‘experiments transgressed into living areas of the house and gardens’. Rayleigh (pictured at work by Philip Burne-Jones, left) enjoyed the active support of his wife in ‘negotiating the use of domestic space for science’16 and her adroit engineering of the heady mix of high politics and academia at Terling’s weekend parties (‘the famous visitor’s book is witness to this’17).\n\nWhat’s more, Evelyn was even able to assist with some of the number-crunching computation Rayleigh found irksome, having willingly ‘furthered her learning in physics and mathematics through his tutelage, the lessons [having] constituted a form of courtship’.16 (Rayleigh also enjoyed the valuable assistance of his wife’s sister, mathematician Eleanor Sidgwick, later an activist for the higher education of women and principal of Newnham College, Cambridge.)\n\nIn 1879, as the the agricultural economy nosedived, Lord Rayleigh decided to return to Cambridge University as professor of the famed Cavendish Laboratory (‘setting up a systematic course of instruction in experimental physics which has remained the core of the Laboratory’s teaching programme’), tasking his brother Edward with the management of the Terling estate. ‘The countryside was going derelict and with Lord Rayleigh’s financial backing Edward Strutt set out to save the estate by taking over the [formerly tenanted] land and farming it himself.’4\n\nThis he did with such conspicuous success it attracted an approach from Guy’s Hospital to manage their landholdings in eastern England, Strutt (left) joining forces with fellow Essex farmer Charles Parker to form land agency Strutt & Parker. This timely, privately owned concern soon developed a life of its own, initially as contractor, later as a landowner in its own right, acquiring bargain-basement farms as they became available.\n\nAnother key strand in the Strutt farming operation as the 19th century came to a close was the development of Friesian cattle. In time the Terling herd would become ‘the largest and most famous in the kingdom, and certainly the most important .. generation after generation of first-class cows’ which farmers across the land were always keen to buy into.18\n\nWith scientific input from his brother up at the big house, Terling’s milk operation would raise the bar in production standards, and entrepreneurial Edward was soon diversifying into direct supply from premises in central London under the banner ‘Lord Rayleigh’s Dairy‘. Despite his career-defining identification of argon in 1895 (for which Rayleigh later received the Nobel Prize), the 3rd baron would joke that across the capital he was rather more well-known as a milkman.\n\n*\n\n‘The last of the giants of the Victorian era in physical science’ died in June 1919, aged 77.19 Just three months earlier his son and heir, Robert, had suffered the loss of his first wife, Mary, a daughter of the 4th Earl of Leitrim and mother of their four children. Undaunted by his father’s much-garlanded stature (being memorialised in Westminster Abbey), the 4th Baron Rayleigh would also pursue a scientific career, becoming a leading physicist in his own right. (‘The photometric unit for sky brightness, the rayleigh, is named after him.’2)\n\nA year after he succeeded the new squire met and would soon marry the widowed Kathleen Cuthbert, likewise a single parent of three sons and a daughter and then resident at the Cuthbert seat, Beaufront Castle in Northumberland. Thereafter, ‘the two families were brought up together,’ dividing the year between Beaufront and Terling Place.20\n\n‘Late last Thursday night a destructive fire apparently originated in Lord Rayleigh’s laboratory in the west wing at Terling,’ newspapers reported in March 1930.21 The solid dividing wall had at least prevented the blaze spreading into the main part of the house but ‘his Lordship – who motored back from a dinner in London – was,’ reports suggested, ‘greatly distressed at the loss of his scientific instruments’. “I’m not as upset as people seem to think,” Rayleigh clarified, “life is too short to worry about the burning down of a wing. So long as a family is alright nothing else matters.”20 The episode would not be entirely without casualty, however.\n\nFor Rayleigh’s uncle (and still effectively the overseer of the Terling estate) Edward Strutt, ‘having next morning inspected the results of the fire, had a stroke and passed away on the evening of the same day’. With Lord Rayleigh’s Farms and the lands owned or managed by Strutt & Parker, ‘by his death Strutt was farming 25,000 acres scattered across a wide area’.20 Continuing the established arrangement, Strutt’s sons picked up where he had left off while Lord Rayleigh (↓) set about reconstituting his scientific facilities, the west wing at Terling gaining a domed observatory in the process.\n\nLike his father before him, the 4th Lord Rayleigh ‘was a highly skilled experimentalist’, maintained a prolific output of scientific papers throughout his life, and ascended to the presidency of many august bodies (including the Royal Institution from 1945 until his death three years later).2 In his down time, weather permitting, Rayleigh was partial to swimming in the river Chelmer, ‘nude, except for a Panama hat’, a mild streak of eccentricity…20\n\n… which would be taken to altogether more alarming levels by his heir, son John. Several readers of the 5th baron’s obituary in the Daily Telegraph in 1988 would deprecate its ‘cruelly selective’ focus upon certain bizarre incidents of an evident mid-life crisis (including a fine for flashing on Paddington station in his 50th year) over ‘his great charm, erudition and enormous generosity’.22 Essex landed society and representatives of many local organisations had thronged the 87-year-old’s funeral in February at St. Michael’s church, just beyond Terling’s park wall.\n\nMarried but without children, the title and 9,000-acre estate now passed to his nephew, brother Charles’ son, and the latest John Strutt, 6th and present Baron Rayleigh↓. (In 2012 this inheritance was supplemented by the Co. Donegal estate formerly associated with the (extinct) earldom of Leitrim, including Mulroy House, which had descended to Lord Rayleigh’s bachelor uncle, the Hon. Hedley Strutt.)\n\nIn the mid-1990s Lord Rayleigh commissioned sympathetic alterations and additions to Terling Place from classical architect Quinlan Terry: an ‘elegant Palladian summerhouse‘5 within the walled garden beyond the east wing which was itself ‘almost entirely rebuilt…\n\n… to provide accommodation better suited to the needs of the family and the estate management team in the 21st century’.9 A century which has recently seen a significant divestment, the 13,000 acres owned by Strutt & Parker Farms having been sold in 2019 yielding an estimated £200 million for its private shareholders, whose number ‘had grown to more than 80 over the generations’. At the family-founded property agency, meanwhile, the next generation at Terling Place prepares to become master of all he surveys…\n\n[Estate archives]"
