        "text": "Joseph John Thomson (18 December 1856 – 30 August 1940) was an English physicist who helped revolutionize the knowledge of atomic structure by his discovery of the electron. In 1897, Thomson showed that cathode rays were composed of previously unknown negatively charged particles (now called electrons), which he calculated must have bodies much smaller than atoms and a very large charge-to-mass ratio. Thomson is also credited with finding the first evidence for isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element in 1913, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays (positive ions). His experiments to determine the nature of positively charged particles, with Francis William Aston, were the first use of mass spectrometry and led to the development of the mass spectrograph. Thomson was awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the conduction of electricity in gases.\n\n“As we conquer peak after peak we see in front of us regions full of interest and beauty, but we do not see our goal, we do not see the horizon; in the distance tower still higher peaks, which will yield to those who ascend them still wider prospects, and deepen the feeling, the truth of which is emphasised by every advance in science, that ‘Great are the Works of the Lord.’”\n\nSir J.J. Thomson, Presidential Address to the British Association, as quoted in Arthur L. Foley, ‘Recent Developments in Physical Science, The Popular Science Monthly (1910), 456.\n\n___________________\n\nSources: Wikipedia, Today in Science History\n\nJohn William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh, OM, PC, PRS (12 November 1842 – 30 June 1919), was a British scientist who made extensive contributions to both theoretical and experimental physics. He spent all of his academic career at the University of Cambridge. Among many honours, he received the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his investigations of the densities of the most important gases and for his discovery of argon in connection with these studies.” He served as President of the Royal Society from 1905 to 1908 and as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge from 1908 to 1919.\n\nRayleigh provided the first theoretical treatment of the elastic scattering of light by particles much smaller than the light’s wavelength, a phenomenon now known as “Rayleigh scattering”, which notably explains why the sky is blue – and why the moon is red during a lunar eclipse like the one we have seen on 22 January 2019.\n\nRevd Professor David Wilkinson brought to us the following thoughts on BBC and later published on the Science and Belief blog:\n\n“Most of the sunlight is blocked by the Earth but some of it is refracted by the Earth’s atmosphere and reaches the Moon. The red color is caused by so-called Rayleigh scattering of sunlight through the atmosphere, the same phenomenon that makes the sky blue.\n\nThis scattering is named after one of the great leaders of British experimental and theoretical physics, John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh. He made contributions to understanding waves in solids, the flow and stability of fluids as well as optics and the theory of sound. His work in radiation was key in the birth of quantum theory. Alongside many other honours, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1904 ‘for his investigations of the densities of the most important gases and for his discovery of argon.’\n\nYet for all this, it was said of him that ‘no man ever showed less consciousness of (his own) great genius’. Part of this natural humility came from his Christian faith. When his Scientific Papers were published he prefaced them, against some opposition, with a quotation from the Psalms, ‘The Works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein’. He spoke also of his faith in Jesus Christ as looking ‘to a power beyond what we see’.\n\nRayleigh is one of many scientists contemporary with and after Darwin who challenge the widely accepted myth of the conflict in history of science and religious belief. He is also an example to me of humble leadership which can come from the recognition that the whole creation is gift and that there is a higher power. Perhaps in this way, the blood Moon might be a reminder to other leaders this week of such humility.\n\nAnd by the way I was up at five to see the eclipse, and I can report in Newcastle it was cloudless and beautiful.” [1]\n\n[1] David Wilkinson: Thought for the Day: Humility, Faith and the Super Blood Wolf Moon\n\nPicture: George Reid, Portrait of John William Strutt. 3rd Baron Rayleigh (1842-1919), royalsociety.org\n\nEnrico Fermi (29 Sep 1901 in Rome, Italy – 28 Nov 1954 in Chicago, USA) is considered one of the greatest Italian physicists of his time. He had a remarkable capacity to join theoretical goals with ingenious experimentation. Fermi focused his studies on particle physics and quantum mechanics, receiving, in 1938, the Nobel Prize in Physics for his studies of neutron collision. He moved to the United States due to racial laws in Italy (his wife was Jewish) and turned his attention to the possibility of obtaining chain reactions that could start the production of neutrons for use as fission particles. The study of controlled chain reactions led him finally to the atomic bomb project, which he completed in collaboration with Oppenheimer. He faced his death serenely, suffering from an incurable illness that was diagnosed too late.\n\nLittle documentation exists regarding Fermi’s religious convictions, although the account of a profound moment in his life has been left to us: Continue reading\n\nRichard Smalley (06 June 1943–28 October 2005) shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Robert F. Curl Jr., and Sir Harold W. Kroto “for their discovery of fullerenes.”\n\nThough a skeptic of religion early in life, it is recorded that he had a drastic conversation to Christianity while undergoing chemotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\nThis is an excerpt from a prepared talk by Prof. Smalley for the Hope College Alumni reunion, October 29, 2005:\n\n“Recently I have gone back to church regularly with a new focus to understand as best I can what it is that makes Christianity so vital and powerful in the lives of billions of people today, even though almost 2000 years have passed since the death and resurrection of Christ. Although I suspect I will never fully understand, I now think the answer is very simple: it’s true. God did create the universe about 13.7 billion years ago, and of necessity has involved Himself with His creation ever since. The purpose of this universe is something that only God knows for sure, but it is increasingly clear to modern science that the universe was exquisitely fine-tuned to enable human life. We are somehow critically involved in His purpose. Our job is to sense that purpose as best we can, love one another, and help Him get that job done.”\n\nSource: Smalley, Richard. “Prepared Remarks by Richard Smalley for 2005 Alumni Banquet (posthumous).” Hope College. Holland, Michigan. 29 Oct 2005.\n\nMore info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Smalley\n\nMax Planck (23 April 1858- 04 Oct 1947) was a German theoretical physicist. Planck’s earliest work was on the subject of thermodynamics, an interest he acquired from his studies under Kirchhoff, whom he greatly admired, and very considerably from reading R. Clausius’ publications. He published papers on entropy, on thermoelectricity and on the theory of dilute solutions.\n\nAt the same time also the problems of radiation processes engaged his attention and he showed that these were to be considered as electromagnetic in nature. From these studies he was led to the problem of the distribution of energy in the spectrum of full radiation. Experimental observations on the wavelength distribution of the energy emitted by a black body as a function of temperature were at variance with the predictions of classical physics. Planck was able to deduce the relationship between the energy and the frequency of radiation. In a paper published in 1900, he announced his derivation of the relationship: this was based on the revolutionary idea that the energy emitted by a resonator could only take on discrete values or quanta. The energy for a resonator of frequency v is hv where h is a universal constant, now called Planck’s constant.\n\nThis was not only Planck’s most important work but also marked a turning point in the history of physics. The importance of the discovery, with its far-reaching effect on classical physics, was not appreciated at first. However the evidence for its validity gradually became overwhelming as its application accounted for many discrepancies between observed phenomena and classical theory. Among these applications and developments may be mentioned Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect.\n\nIn 1918, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his development of quantum theory. Planck’s constant is named for him, a foundation of quantum formulation.\n\nHe authored philosophical works and organized conferences, among them one titled Science and Faith (1930).\n\nPlanck was twice married. Upon his appointment, in 1885, to Associate Professor in his native town Kiel he married a friend of his childhood, Marie Merck, who died in 1909. He remarried her cousin Marga von Hösslin. Three of his children died young, leaving him with two sons.\n\nPlanck faced a troubled and tragic period in his life during the period of the Nazi government in Germany, when he felt it his duty to remain in his country but was openly opposed to some of the Government’s policies, particularly as regards the persecution of the Jews. He suffered a personal tragedy when one of his sons, Ernst Planck, who was active in the Nazi resistance, was executed for his part in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Hitler in 1944.\n\nHe was revered by his colleagues not only for the importance of his discoveries but for his great personal qualities.\n\nSources: www.inters.org , Nobel Lectures, Physics 1901-1921, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1967,\n\n“Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are part of nature and therefore part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.”\n\n“Die Wissenschaft kann das letzte Geheimnis der Natur nicht erklären. Und zwar weil wir in letzter Analyse selbst Teil dieses Geheimnisses sind, das wir zu erklären versuchen.“"
