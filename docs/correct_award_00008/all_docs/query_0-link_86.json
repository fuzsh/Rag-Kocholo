        "text": "2016 IEEE UFFC Rayleigh Award to James G. Miller\n\nProf. James G. Miller was named the recipient of the 2016 Rayleigh Award at the International Ultrasonics Symposium held this year in Tours, France. This ultrasonics award is the highest given by the Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control (UFFC) Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). The award is named in honor of British Nobel Prize winning physicist John William Strutt, the 3rd Baron Rayleigh, recognized as one of the fathers of the physics of sound. The citation for Professor Miller’s award reads “For pioneering sustained and high impact research in ultrasonic tissue characterization and quantitative echocardiography”. Professor Miller is the Albert Gordon Hill professor of physics and director of the Laboratory for Ultrasonics at Washington University where he also holds the rank of professor of biomedical engineering and medicine."
