        "text": "AKA John William Strutt\n\nBorn: 12-Nov-1842\n\nBirthplace: Langford Grove, Maldon, Essex, England\n\nDied: 30-Jun-1919\n\nLocation of death: Terling Place, Witham, Essex, England\n\nCause of death: unspecified\n\nRemains: Buried, Churchyard of the family estate at Terling Place, Witham, Essex, England\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Christian\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Physicist, Mathematician\n\nNationality: England\n\nExecutive summary: Why the sky is blue\n\nBritish physicist and mathematician Lord Rayleigh discovered the inert gas argon (Ar) in 1895, which earned him the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physics. His colleague in this research, Sir William Ramsay, won the same year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Born John William Strutt, he became Lord Rayleigh the Third Baron of Terling Place at the death of his father in 1873, and did much of his research in a private laboratory on the family estate. His 1871 Theory of Scattering was the first scientific work to correctly explain why the sky is blue, and his two-volume The Theory of Sound clarified the mechanics of vibration and acoustic wave propagation.\n\nHe studied under George Gabriel Stokes, was a distant relative of Robert Boyle, and his students included George Paget Thomson and J. J. Thomson. His brother-in-law, Arthur Balfour, was Prime Minister of England from 1902-05. Lord Rayleigh succeeded James Clerk Maxwell as Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge in 1879 but remained at this post for only five years before returning to his mansion and secluded lab. He also worked to establish absolute standards for the ohm and other scientific measurements, and served as President of the paranormal research group Society for Psychical Research.\n\nFather: John James Strutt (2nd Baron Rayleigh, b. 30-Jan-1796, d. 14-Jun-1873)\n\nMother: Clara Elizabeth La Touche Vicars (m. 3-Feb-1842, d. 4-Mar-1900)\n\nBrother: Joseph Henry Strutt (b. 1844, d. 1845)\n\nSister: Clara Emily Charlotte Strutt Paley (b. 1845, d. 23-Dec-1912)\n\nBrother: Richard Strutt (b. 29-Feb-1848, d. 14-Oct-1927)\n\nBrother: Charles Hedley Strutt (b. 18-Apr-1849, d. 19-Dec-1926)\n\nBrother: Edward Gerald Strutt (b. 10-Apr-1854)\n\nBrother: Hedley Vicars Strutt (military officer, b. 17-Jul-1864, d. 22-Jan-1891)\n\nWife: Evelyn Balfour (m. 19-Jul-1871, d. 7-Apr-1934, four sons)\n\nSon: Robert John Strutt (4th Baron Rayleigh, physicist, b. 28-Aug-1875, d. 13-Dec-1947)\n\nSon: Arthur Charles Strutt (British Naval Vice Admiral, b. 2-Oct-1878, d. 10-Feb-1973)\n\nSon: Julian Balfour Strutt (b. 16-Aug-1880, d. 4-Sep-1886)\n\nSon: William Maitland Strutt (b. 20-Jul-1886, d. 22-Nov-1912)\n\nHigh School: Eton College, Windsor, Berkshire, England (attended)\n\nHigh School: Harrow School, London, England (1861)\n\nUniversity: BA, Trinity College, Cambridge University (1865)\n\nUniversity: MA, Trinity College, Cambridge University (1868)\n\nProfessor: Cavendish Professor of Physics, Cambridge University (1879-84)\n\nProfessor: Natural Philosophy, Royal Institution of Great Britain (1897-1905)\n\nAdministrator: Chancellor, Cambridge University (1908-19)\n\nRoyal Medal 1882\n\nMatteucci Medal 1894\n\nCopley Medal 1899\n\nFrench Legion of Honor\n\nLMS De Morgan Medal 1900\n\nOrder of Merit 1902\n\nPrussian Order Pour le Mérite 1903\n\nNobel Prize for Physics 1904\n\nRumford Medal 1920\n\nAthenaeum Club (London)\n\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science\n\nLondon Mathematical Society President (1876-78)\n\nRoyal Institution of Great Britain\n\nRoyal Society 1873\n\nRoyal Society Secretary (1885-96)\n\nRoyal Society President (1905-08)\n\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\n\nSociety for Psychical Research President (1919)\n\nNature\n\nLunar Crater Rayleigh (29.0° N 189.2° E, 107 km. diameter)\n\nMartian Crater Rayleigh (75.6° S 240.9° W, 149 km. diameter)\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nThe Theory of Sound (1877-78, physics; two volumes)\n\nThe Becquerel Rays and the Properties of Radium (1904, physics)\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Lord Rayleigh\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
