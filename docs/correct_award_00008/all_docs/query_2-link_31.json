        "text": "Last week, I was lucky enough to join a select and invited group to view the original home and laboratories of John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh OM, PC, PRS.\n\nLord Rayleigh, 12 November 1842 – 30 June 1919, was a British scientist who made extensive contributions to both theoretical and experimental physics. He had three different periods of working at Cambridge University, as well as serving as the President of the Royal Society from 1905 to 1908. He was part of the original committee that recommended the National Physical Laboratory be set up and oversaw our work whilst he was President.\n\nThe current Lord and Lady Rayleigh welcomed us into their home on Saturday 11th May and were kind enough to show us the family portraits, stories and a tour of the grounds, explaining the various modifications to their home, Terling Place, in Essex. The family have been farmers for hundreds of years and, luckily for the 3rd Baron Rayleigh, he handed over the management of the farm to his brother so he could pursue his academic career. Terling Place has had many modifications and improvements, but in amongst all of this they have left the original laboratories of the 3rd Baron untouched, and I am so glad they did.\n\nRayleigh’s scientific legacy must surpass that of anyone before or since. He is known for over 15 different ideas – from Rayleigh waves and Rayleigh scattering, to Rayleigh’s equation, and much more. He has the 'rayl' unit of acoustic impedance named after him, but is best known for his discovery of argon, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Physics 1904. All this is well known about him, but to visit his home and see the Noble Prize certificate on the wall and the medal in the cabinet, along with a huge number of the other awards he received was a true honour.\n\nThe highlight was the tour around his original scientific rooms that remain untouched, including 100+ years of dust! We started in the book room – every drawer and cupboard had lots of curiosities and boxes of equipment and samples. Each is meticulously catalogued and has been kept exactly as it was left.\n\nThe were piles of old pictures, including this one, which has the inscription 'To Lord Rayleigh with appreciation of esteem from Nikola Tesla (month unreadable) 17, 1901'.\n\nThere are also cupboards full of photographic equipment as Lord Rayleigh was a pioneer of early photography. His picture is in the hall of Terling Place and is considered to be the world's first selfie!\n\nWe ventured from the book room to the glass and chemical preparation room. Do not touch any of the bottles the tour guide helpfully offered, as we had no idea what was in them!\n\nNo self-respecting theoretical physicist is without a workshop in which to build bits of kit, and a small darkroom was also in this space.\n\nHis main two laboratories are on the first floor. The picture here does not really portray how awe-inspiring it was to walk into these spaces, untouched – you really imagined that he had just 'popped out' (if you can look beyond the dust).\n\nStrange experiments had been set up and bits of his legacy just lying around, including this rather splendid electronically-powered tuning fork. Our guide got a battery out and, after a few sparks and joking about health and safety, the tuning fork leapt into life. But for me, the moment of the day was the opening of a plain cardboard box containing a single vial nearly labelled 'Argon 1897' – possibly one of the earliest surviving samples of it in the world.\n\nIt was a joy, and I wish the currently family well in their endeavours with experts to continue preserving the collection in its current form and making it available online soon."
