        "text": "English physicist who derived an equation to account for the variation of light-scattering with wavelength. He also developed an equation describing the distribution of wavelengths in blackbody radiation, but it applied only to long wavelengths . Rayleigh noticed that the nitrogen in air was more dense than that obtained from minerals. He wrote the journal Nature asking for suggestions. William Ramsay became interested, and his experiments culminated in 1894 with the discovery of argon. Rayleigh was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1904 in physics.\n\nAdditional biographies: MacTutor (St. Andrews)"
