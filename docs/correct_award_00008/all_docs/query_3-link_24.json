Item #BB2255\n\nOriginally published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, in 1895. Both Rayleigh and Ramsay claimed priority for the discovery of argon; they eventually agreed to submit a jointly authored paper. Both later won the Nobel prize (Rayleigh for Physics, Ramsay for Chemistry), and their discovery was a major factor in both awards. \"Rayleigh and Ramsay had noted that nitrogen obtained from the air had a density greater than that of nitrogen liberated from its compounds by about one-half percent. This led to the isolation of the first of the inert gases, which they called argon,\" after the Greek word aerg√≥n (\"inert, inactive\") (Dibner). Ramsay later investigated other atmospheric gases, isolating helium, neon, krypton, and xenon, which pioneered a new section of the periodic table. N. B.
