        "text": "Lord Rayleigh\n\nJohn William Strutt was the 3rd Baron Rayleigh. The Rayleigh title was originally given to his grandmother, Charlotte, on her husband's suggestion because Joseph Holden Strutt had declined personal honours throughout his life, and perhaps didn't wish to be raised to the peerage as he should have to resign as an MP. The title had been proffered by George III for Joseph's duties in the army and in Parliament. On his wife's death in 1836, the title passed to their only son John James Strutt, 2nd Baron Rayleigh.\n\nJohn James, a deeply religious man, led the life of a country squire in Essex, north-east of London. He married when he was 46, Clara, who was only 17 at the time. John W Strutt was born on 12th November 1842 into a loving and protective family. He showed early promise in mathematics, and studied under Routh at Cambridge becoming Senior Wrangler (top of the year in the math exam). He also had an abiding interest in photography from his youth.\n\nJ W Strutt became a fellow of Trinity College Cambridge in 1866. He travelled widely for that time, including the US and Egypt. On returning from a visit to the United States, where he met President Andrew Johnson, he purchased some laboratory equipment for Terling. The laboratory at Terling was the centre for many of Rayleigh's experiments on sound, and also where he finally tracked down the gas argon, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics. He married Evelyn Balfour, the sister of the future Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, in 1871.\n\nLord Rayleigh (1842-1919, born John William Strutt)\n\nArgon\n\nRoyal Institution Proceedings , 524 (1895) [from Rayleigh's Scientific Papers , vol IV (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Press, 1903)] Nature inviting criticisms from chemists who might be interested in such questions.

ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN.\n\nLord Rayleigh (1842-1919, born John William Strutt)\n\nDensity of Nitrogen\n\nNature , 512 (1892) [from Scientific Papers , vol IV (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Press, 1903)] I am much puzzled by some recent results as to the density of nitrogen, and shall be obliged if any of your chemical readers can offer suggestions as to the cause. According to two methods of preparation I obtain quite distinct values. The relative difference, amounting to about 1/1000 part, is small in itself, but it lies entirely outside the errors of experiment, and can only be attributed to a variation in the character of the gas. In the first method the oxygen of atmospheric air is removed in the ordinary way by metallic copper, itself reduced by hydrogen from the oxide. The air, freed from CO by potash , gives up its oxygen to copper heated in hard glass over a large Bunsen, and then passes over about a foot of red-hot copper in a furnace. This tube was used merely as an indicator, and the copper in it remained bright throughout. The gas then passed through a wash-bottle containing sulphuric acid, thence again through the furnace over copper oxide , and finally over sulphuric acid, potash and phosphoric anhydride.\n\nThe Theory of Sound by John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh\n\nINTRODUCTION 1. THE sensation of sound is a thing sui generis , not comparable with any of our other sensations. No one can express the relation between a sound and a colour or a smell. Directly or indirectly, all questions connected with this subject must come for decision to the ear, as the organ of hearing; and from it there can be no appeal. But we are not therefore to infer that all acoustical investigations are conducted with the unassisted ear. When once we have discovered the physical phenomena which constitute the foundation of sound, our explorations are in great measure transferred to another field lying within the dominion of the principles of Mechanics. Important laws are in this way arrived at, to which the sensations of the ear cannot but conform.\n\n2. Very cursory observation often suffices to shew that sounding bodies are in a state of vibration, and that the phenomena of sound and vibration are closely connected. When a vibrating bell or string is touched by the finger, the sound ceases at the same moment that the vibration is damped. But, in order to affect the sense of hearing, it is not enough to have a vibrating instrument; there must also be an uninterrupted communication between the instrument and the ear. A bell rung in vacuo , with proper precautions to prevent the communication of motion, remains inaudible. In the air of the atmosphere, however, sounds have a universal vehicle, capable of conveying them without break from the most variously constituted sources to the recesses of the ear.John William Strutt , third Baron Rayleigh, was born on November 12, 1842 at Langford Grove, Maldon, Essex, as the son of John James Strutt, second Baron, and his wife Clara Elizabeth La Touche, eldest daughter of Captain Richard Vicars, R. E. He was one of the very few members of higher nobility who won fame as an outstanding scientist.\n\nThroughout his infancy and youth he was of frail physique; his education was repeatedly interrupted by ill-health, and his prospects of attaining maturity appeared precarious. After a short spell at Eton at the age of 10, mainly spent in the school sanatorium, three years in a private school at Wimbledon, and another short stay at Harrow, he finally spent four years with the Rev. George Townsend Warner (1857) who took pupils at Torquay.\n\nIn 1861 he entered Trinity College Cambridge , where he commenced reading mathematics, not at first equal in attainments to the best of his contemporaries, but his exceptional abilities soon enabled him to overtake his competitors. He graduated in the Mathematical Tripos in 1865 as Senior Wrangler and Smith's Prizeman. In 1866 he obtained a fellowship at Trinity which he held until 1871, the year of his marriage.\n\nA severe attack of rheumatic fever in 1872 made him spend the winter in Egypt and Greece. Shortly after his return his father died (1873) and he succeeded to the barony, taking up residence in the family seat, Terling Place, at Witham, Essex. He now found himself compelled to devote part of his time to the management of his estates (7000 acres). The combination of general scientific knowledge and acumen with acquired knowledge of agriculture made his practice in estate management in many respects in advance of his time. Nevertheless, in 1876 he left the entire management of the land to his younger brother.Lord Rayleigh was born John William Strutt into a barony begun in 1821 on the occasion of King George IV's coronation. He was the eldest of seven children, born on the 12th November 1842. His father, John James Strutt, had been Second Baron for only six years, during which time he had married Clara Latouche Vicars, a lady over twenty five years his junior. His inquisitive scientific mind showed itself when he was four (despite the fact that he had seemed rather unintelligent when he was unable to speak at the age of almost three). His aunt Emily complained at his constant questioning, such as: \"What becomes of the water spilt on the tablecloth after it has dried up?\" He attended Eton College at ten years of age, only to catch smallpox, and then whooping cough. His parents decided a home education would be best, and so a private tutor educated him in mathematics, trigonometry and statics. His short stay at Harrow (West Acre, 18571 - 18572) was his last at school, as he caught a chest infection which left him in ill health for the rest of his life. He was taught from the ages of fourteen to eighteen by Rev. G.T. Warner at Torquay. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge in October 1861 having passed his entrance exams with great success. His mathematics course was vital to his future career in understanding physics. He graduated in 1865 with awards which displayed his promise, a promise which he amply fulfilled. He gained a fellowship at the college the following year, which he held for five years before he married. In 1873 his father died, so he became Third Baron Rayleigh and inherited Terling Place, Essex, as well. For the next three years he felt compelled to look after the estate so his scientific research was little. In 1876, he left the job to his younger brother.\n\nJohn William Strutt Lord Rayleigh\n\nBorn: 12 Nov 1842 in Langford Grove (near Maldon), Essex, England\n\nDied: 30 June 1919 in Terling Place, Witham, Essex, England\n\nClick the picture above\n\nto see eight larger pictures Show birthplace location Previous (Chronologically) Next Biographies Index Previous (Alphabetically) Next Main index\n\nJohn William Strutt 's father was the second Baron Rayleigh of Terling Place, Witham in the county of Essex. Certainly it was a family with little previous interests in science for they were mostly landowners with interests in the countryside. One exception was Robert Boyle , who was a distant relation. Let us say at the beginning of this article that we shall refer to Strutt as Rayleigh throughout this article although he did not succeed to the title until he was 30 years old. As a boy Rayleigh suffered from poor health and his schooling at both Eton and Harrow was disrupted. He had to leave both schools after a short period due to health problems. Four years spent at the Reverend Warner's boarding school, prepared Rayleigh for university and at this stage he did begin to show signs of mathematical ability. During these four years he had a private tutor but overall he showed little sign of being anything other than an average child of average ability. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge in October 1861 where he took the mathematical Tripos. His coach at Cambridge was Edward\n\nLord Rayleigh (1842-1919, born John William Strutt)\n\nArgon\n\nRoyal Institution Proceedings , 524 (1895) [from Rayleigh's Scientific Papers , vol IV (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Press, 1903)] Nature inviting criticisms from chemists who might be interested in such questions.
