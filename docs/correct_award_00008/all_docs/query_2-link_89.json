        "text": "We have revisited cellular thermal biology with our label-free mid-infrared photothermal microscope to tackle an unresolved biophysics problem known as the 10^5 gap issue. See our arXiv paper! https://lnkd.in/gTyjZb3P\n\nThe deadline for paper submission to the IEEE Photonics Conference (IPC) 2024 has been extended to 20 May. It will be held in Rome on 10-14 November. I hope you consider submitting your work! We have distinguished invited speakers on our topic, \"Propagation, Spectroscopy, and Imaging.\" Please check out the conference website, and see you in Rome! https://ieee-ipc.org/\n\nI am serving as a topic chair for the IEEE Photonics Conference (IPC) 2024, which will be held in Rome on 10-14 November. Our topic is \"Propagation, Spectroscopy, and Imaging.\" The deadline for the submission is 6 May. See you in Rome! https://lnkd.in/gNPAbrvy\n\nOur new paper has been published! We developed an algorithm to retrieve phase from a phase-contrast image. Commercial phase-contrast microscopes can now become quantitative phase microscopes without any hardware modification! https://lnkd.in/grdEvHP9\n\nCongratulations to Prof. Agostini, Prof. Krausz, and Prof. L'Huillier for the Nobel Prize in Physics 2023! Particularly, I send a big congratulations to Prof. Krausz as one of the alumni of the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics! Also, I am honored to have given an invited talk right after Prof. L'Huillier a month ago at the HRMS colloquium in Dijon! It has become a cherished memory.\n\nOur new paper \"Label-free mid-infrared photothermal live-cell imaging beyond video rate\" is published in Light: Science & Applications! Mid-infrared photothermal quantitative phase imaging (MIP-QPI) has been significantly improved. Now, we have the ability to obtain label-free chemical images of living cells beyond the video rate! https://lnkd.in/gAkemHKA"
