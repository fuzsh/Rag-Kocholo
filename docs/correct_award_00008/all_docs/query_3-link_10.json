        "text": "Biography\n\nRi positions\n\nProfessor of Natural Philosophy, 1887-1905\n\nDirector of the DFRL, 1896-1919\n\nHonorary Professor, 1905-1919\n\nBorn in Maldon, he briefly attended both Eton College and Harrow School, but because of ill health was mostly educated at private schools. He studied the Mathematical Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was senior wrangler (the highest-scoring graduate) in 1865. He was elected a Fellow of Trinity, a position he held until he married in 1871.\n\nAfter spending some time in Greece and Egypt for medical reasons, he returned to scientific research, including psychic phenomena. His first major work was on Maxwell's theory of electro-magnetism which he rendered somewhat more comprehensible. In 1879 he succeeded Maxwell as Cavendish Professor at the University of Cambridge, a position that he held until 1884 when he retired to his country house, Terling Place, where he built a private laboratory."
