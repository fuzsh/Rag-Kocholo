The Salvation Army is a worldwide Christian church. Our mission is based on our faith in Jesus Christ who wants everyone to experience life in all its fullness.

That is why, here in the UK and Ireland, we put our faith into action by offering practical help for people without discrimination, sharing good news, seeking justice and reconciliation, caring for creation and nurturing disciples of Jesus. The services we offer are diverse and responsive to the realities of life in the communities we serve.
