Officially founded March 30, 2018 in Tennessee as

FOFGM actually existed long before this legal start.

Marie went on her first missions trip to Dominican Republic as a 13 year old. For three decades, Marie has continually gone to the international mission field on short term trips. As of 2020, Marie's total count is now at

79 NATIONS.

In 2010, while pastoring in the San Diego area, Lloyd and Marie started taking their three kids across the border to work with orphans in Mexico. By 2019, the Tsuruda family of five had gone to over 40 nations together.

More than four million (4,000,000) kids have come to Christ through their missions work.

Yet, their goal is

one HUNDRED million souls in every nation.

To God be all the glory, great things He has done!
