        "text": "Girl Scouts entered the first decade of the new millennium focused on the healthy development of girls, establishing the Girl Scout Research Institute to conduct studies and report findings. We also continued to emphasize inclusiveness by hosting a National Conference on Latinas in Girl Scouting and, in 2005, electing the first Hispanic or Latino/a/e woman as chair of the National Board, Patricia Diaz Dennis.\n\nGirl Scouts turned 100, celebrating its centennial on March 12, 2012. In 2014, Girl Scouts launched Digital Cookie, through which Girl Scout Cookies were sold online by girls for the first time in the history of the iconic cookie program. Girl Scout programming also expands to include more STEM subjects, including robotics and space science badges.\n\nEven as technology plays a larger and larger role in Americansâ€™ lives, Girl Scouts also stay connected to nature and the great outdoors. So, while Girl Scouts introduced new badges to promote outdoor activities, girls can also earn STEM badges that prepare them for the future."
