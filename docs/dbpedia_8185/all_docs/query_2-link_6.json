        "text": "About the service\n\nFaith Global Links Ventures Limited is a residential care home providing personal care to up to 5 people. The service provides support to people living with mental health support needs. At the time of our inspection there were 4 people using the service.\n\nPeople’s experience of using this service and what we found\n\nRisks to people’s safety were not assessed and managed. Environmental risks were not monitored, and people did not have detailed, personalised risk assessments in place. The service was poorly maintained. The provider’s infection control and cleaning processes were not robust. People’s medicines were not safely managed. Staff had not always received all relevant training for their roles and recruitment checks had not always been completed accurately.\n\nThe provider’s safeguarding processes were not effective. People did not receive person-centred care. People’s care plans were not personalised and the provider was not able to demonstrate how they had adapted the service to meet people’s individual needs and preferences. People were not encouraged to eat a healthy and varied diet or engage in meaningful activities which reflected their individual preferences. People were not supported to have maximum choice and control of their lives and staff did not support them in the least restrictive way possible and in their best interests; the policies and systems in the service did not support this practice.\n\nThe provider’s processes for monitoring the safety and quality of the service were not effective and had failed to identify the significant concerns found during the inspection. The culture of the service did not empower people to achieve good outcomes. The provider was not able to demonstrate continuous learning in order to drive improvements in the service.\n\nFor more details, please see the full report which is on the CQC website at www.cqc.org.uk\n\nRating at last inspection\n\nThe last rating for this service was good (published 06 October 2017).\n\nWhy we inspected\n\nWe received concerns in relation to staff training, medicines management, food preparation, infection control and management oversight at the service. As a result, we undertook a focused inspection to review the key questions of safe, effective, responsive, and well-led.\n\nFor those key questions not inspected, we used the ratings awarded at the last inspection to calculate the overall rating.\n\nWe have found evidence that the provider needs to make improvements. Please see the safe, effective, responsive, and well-led sections of this full report.\n\nThe overall rating for the service has changed from good to inadequate based on the findings of this inspection.\n\nYou can read the report from our last comprehensive inspection, by selecting the ‘all reports’ link for Faith Global Links Ventures Limited on our website at www.cqc.org.uk.\n\nEnforcement and Recommendations\n\nWe have identified breaches in relation to safe care and treatment, person-centred care, safeguarding, nutritional support, recruitment, and governance at this inspection.\n\nWe have made recommendations about the provider's processes for supporting staff and documenting people's decision-making support.\n\nPlease see the action we have told the provider to take at the end of this report.\n\nFull information about CQC’s regulatory response to the more serious concerns found during inspections is added to reports after any representations and appeals have been concluded.\n\nFollow up\n\nWe will request an action plan from the provider to understand what they will do to improve the standards of quality and safety. We will work alongside the provider and local authority to monitor progress. We will continue to monitor information we receive about the service, which will help inform when we next inspect.\n\nThe overall rating for this service is ‘Inadequate’ and the service is therefore in ‘special measures’. This means we will keep the service under review and, if we do not propose to cancel the provider’s registration, we will re-inspect within 6 months to check for significant improvements.\n\nIf the provider has not made enough improvement within this timeframe and there is still a rating of inadequate for any key question or overall rating, we will take action in line with our enforcement procedures. This will mean we will begin the process of preventing the provider from operating this service. This will usually lead to cancellation of their registration or to varying the conditions the registration.\n\nFor adult social care services, the maximum time for being in special measures will usually be no more than 12 months. If the service has demonstrated improvements when we inspect it, and it is no longer rated as inadequate for any of the five key questions it will no longer be in special measures.\n\nFaith Global Links provides accommodation and personal care for up to five people who have mental health needs. At the time of our inspection five people were using the service. The service does not provide nursing care.\n\nWhen we last visited the service it was rated good.\n\nAt this inspection we found the service remained good.\n\nThe manager was a strong leader and promoted a calm atmosphere which benefitted people to feel secure and settled. People were encouraged to be involved in the day-to-day decisions at the service. There were systems in place to check the quality of the service and make improvements, where necessary.\n\nThe manager had not always sent in notifications to the Commission as required. We therefore made a recommendation that they review their processes in relation to the submission of statutory notifications.\n\nPeople were supported to stay safe and to manage risk effectively. There were sufficient, safely recruited staff to meet people’s needs. There were robust processes in place to ensure people took their medicines as prescribed.\n\nStaff had the necessary skills to meet a range of complex needs. They worked well with health and social care professionals to promote people’s wellbeing. People choose what they ate and drank in line with their preferences.\n\nThe Care Quality Commission is required by law to monitor how a provider applies the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) and to report on what we find. DoLS are in place to protect people where they do not have capacity to make decisions and where it is considered necessary to restrict their freedom in some way. The registered manager understood their responsibilities in this area. Staff enabled people to be involved in the decisions they made about their life and support.\n\nStaff spoke to people gently and treated them with respect. People were supported to communicate their wishes and preferences and to remain as independent as possible.\n\nDetailed assessments of need were carried out and personalised care plans were in place which provided comprehensive guidance on peoples’ needs. People were supported to develop person-centred routines in line with their preferences. There were varying opportunities to provide feedback about the service and to raise concerns and complaints.\n\nFurther information is in the detailed findings below.\n\nThe inspection took place on 28 July 2015 and was unannounced.\n\nFaith Global Links provides accommodation and personal care for up to five people who have mental health needs. At the time of our inspection five people were using the service.\n\nThe service had a registered manager in post. A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are ‘registered persons’. Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act and associate Regulations about how the service is run.\n\nThe service was meeting the requirements of the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLs). Appropriate mental capacity assessments and best interest decisions had been undertaken by relevant professionals. This ensured that the decision was taken in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005, DoLs and associated Codes of Practice.\n\nThere were enough staff who had been recruited safely and who had the skills and knowledge to provide care and support in ways that people preferred. People were safe because staff understood their responsibilities in managing risk and identifying abuse. People received safe care that met their assessed needs\n\nPeople’s health needs were managed with input from relevant health care professionals, and there were systems in place to manage medicines so that people were supported to take their prescribed medicines safely.\n\nPeople were treated with kindness and respect by staff who knew them well and were supported to maintain relationships with family and friends. Staff supported people to have sufficient food and drink.\n\nThe provider had systems in place to check the quality of the service and take the views and concerns of people and their relatives into account to make improvements to the service."
