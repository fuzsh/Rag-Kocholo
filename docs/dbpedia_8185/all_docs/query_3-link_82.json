        "text": "Benson Boone's swift rise to stardom has been a beautiful thing to witness. Over the past three years, the Monroe, Washington native has gone from viral TikTok influencer to one of Gen Z's most promising pop talents.\n\nRemarkably, the 21-year-old pop-rock artist didn't even discover his voice until he reached high school, after his best friend asked him to play the piano in their school's battle of the bands competition and the singer dropped out at the last second. Boone found himself filling in, an impromptu decision that would unwittingly alter the course of his entire life.\n\n\"It's just like I unlocked something I didn't know I had,\" he mused recently to MTV. \"And I stopped, like, halfway through the first verse and just looked around, and I was so shocked that I had just sang…It was, like, the best feeling of my life.\"\n\nCut to the present day, and Boone's voice has helped him soar to the top of multiple Billboard charts. His latest single \"Beautiful Things,\" a desperate prayer of a love song that pinballs between warm, folksy verses and a rollicking chorus reminiscent of Freddie Mercury's electrifying vocals, has positively exploded since its January release. Boone's breakout hit has spent six consecutive weeks in the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 3 as of press time and topping both of Billboard's global charts for multi-week runs.\n\n\"My life has changed dramatically since the song came out,\" Boone reflected earlier this month in a sit-down with Variety. \"It's so, so, so insane to me that this is happening. I'm trying so hard to formulate words. I have so much trouble processing it all right now…But when I sit back and look at what's happening, it really, truly blows my mind. Because it's something a lot of people dream of, and [I'm] one of those people.\"\n\nBenson is steadfast in building on the runaway success of \"Beautiful Things,\" too. The singer/songwriter's forthcoming debut album is expected some time later this year, and his just-announced Fireworks and Rollerblades World Tour kicks off April 3 in Chicago, with legs in North America, the U.K., Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAs Boone's rise to superstardom continues, GRAMMY.com rounded up everything you need to know about the buzzy star-in-the-making, from his brief stint on reality TV to the A-list rocker who's taken him under his wing.\n\nHe's A Proud \"American Idol\" Dropout\n\nBefore he became a rising star on the charts, Boone initially attempted to get his start in music on \"American Idol.\" During Season 19, the then-18-year-old auditioned for the reality show with a piano-playing cover of Aidan Martin's 2017 single \"Punchline\" after producers came across his videos online.\n\nBoone's jaw-dropping audition earned a standing ovation from judges Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan before Katy Perry confidently declared, \"They're gonna swoon over Benson Boone.\" All three judges were baffled to learn that the teenager had only discovered his obvious musical talent the year before, and the \"Roar\" singer doubled down on her praise by predicting, \"I'm gonna tell you something that you may not believe. But if you believe it, it might happen…I see you winning 'American Idol' if you want to.\"\n\n\"That is the biggest compliment I've ever gotten, thank you,\" a starstruck Boone replied. However, by the time Hollywood week rolled around, the fresh-faced teenager had apparently decided he didn't want to win the long-running reality competition, and withdrew after advancing to the Top 24.\n\n\"The reason I quit 'American Idol' is because I wanted to do music,\" he explained a couple of years later during an appearance on The Zach Sang Show. \"I don't want people to be like, 'Oh, Benson Boone, 'American Idol' blew him up. Like, that's where he comes from. No. I want to be Benson Boone 'cause I write smash hits and they love my music…I just didn't want that label on me.\"\n\nHe Has A Bonafide Rock Superstar For A Mentor\n\nPart of Boone's success as a solo artist can be attributed to Dan Reynolds of Imagine Dragons, who came across the young talent and personally signed him to Night Street Records, the rock singer's own Warner Records imprint that has also boasted K.Flay on its exclusive roster, in 2021.\n\n\"We sign artists so rarely at Night Street — it was one of those moments where you know you have no choice,\" the frontman told Billboard at the time Boone inked his record deal. \"That's how I felt when I first sat in a recording booth with Benson. I'm excited for the world to get to know him the way I have these last months.\"\n\nSince then, Reynolds has also served as a sort of industry mentor figure for Boone, as the burgeoning rocker explained in a 2023 interview promoting the release of his EP Pulse. \"He makes you feel comfortable in your own skin, he's very gifted in that way,\" Boone told iHeartRadio Canada. \"So working with him has been incredible, and him taking time for an artist very much smaller than him is just…he's a very kind soul.\n\n\"I think that the main thing that he's taught me is that in this industry, everybody wants something different from you,\" he continued. \"Everybody has a different outlook on yourself than you actually do. And regardless of what that is, you are the leader of your own career and your own life. You have to do things that make you happy, write music that you want to be writing, releasing things that you're proud of…He's just taught me to stick to my gut and just follow my own dreams.\"\n\nHis Earlier Singles Pack An Emotional Punch (No, Seriously, Grab Some Tissues)\n\nThe runaway success of \"Beautiful Things\" may have earned Boone's legions of newfound fans in the last two months, but it's actually not his biggest song on streaming platforms (at least just yet). Before his soul-baring folk-rock anthem was burning up charts around the world, the singer released his debut single \"Ghost Town\" and heartbreaking follow-up \"In The Stars,\" both of which are included on his debut 2021 EP Walk Me Home… (As of press time, the former has more than 336 million streams on Spotify, and the latter has a whopping 617 million.)\n\nAnother smoldering torch song, \"Ghost Town\" became Boone's first official entry on the Hot 100 after it was released in October 2021. \"Maybe you'd be happier with someone else/ Maybe loving me's the reason you can't love yourself/ Before I turn your heart into a ghost town/ Show me everything we build so I can tear it all down,\" he laments on the soaring chorus over a running piano line and booming, orchestral percussion.\n\nOn the heels of \"Ghost Town,\" Boone then penned \"In the Stars\" in 2022 about the death of his beloved great-grandma. \"That kind of loss can be more emotional and heartfelt than a relationship,\" he told Genius about the song's tender meaning. \"I wanted to write about something that was real. It's something I've never really talked about or dealt face to face with. Songwriting is very new to me, and so I'm still learning that process of figuring out how to cope with something through a song. And I think this is kind of where that starts for me.\"\n\nOther pre-\"Beautiful Things\" tracks worth checking out in Boone's quickly blossoming discography include the addictive TikTok smash \"Sugar Sweet,\" wistfully upbeat bop \"Coffee Cake\" and the introspective \"What Was.\"\n\nHis Stage Presence Is Downright Acrobatic\n\nBoone may be a relative newcomer in the music industry, but he's already developed a magnetic stage presence at his packed live shows. In fact, one of his signature tricks on stage is landing a backflip mid-song without so much as missing a beat.\n\nTo tease his upcoming world tour, the singer posted a clip of himself in late January belting out \"What Was\" in front of an ecstatic crowd. In the video, he impressively nails a flip before effortlessly transitioning right into the power ballad's bombastic climax, wailing, \"Let me/ Start over/ The moment that I left you in tears/ Is a mem'ry that will haunt me for years/ And years and years and years and years.\"\n\n\"My dad is 49 years old and still backflips, I get it from him,\" the singer confessed to Australian outlet The Project on his first trip Down Under in the fall of 2022. \"I always thought he was, like, the coolest…but yeah, I've been flipping since I was, like, four and it's just always been my thing.\"\n\nHe Has Roots In Mormonism\n\nBoone grew up in small-town Washington as the only boy in a Mormon family with four sisters. He's never really spoken publicly about growing up in the clean-cut, high-demand religion, but he actually briefly attended Brigham Young University—Idaho, the Mormon university in Rexburg, for a semester before pausing his education to focus on music.\n\nMormonism is a trait he coincidentally shares with his mentor Reynolds, who's been outspoken throughout his career about his Mormon background and actually got kicked out of Brigham Young University around the same time he formed Imagine Dragons.\n\nWhile Boone grew up outside the \"Book of Mormon Belt\" — the geographic area that radiates from Mormonism's Salt Lake City headquarters to include parts of Idaho, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Wyoming and even southern Alberta, Canada — his Mormon roots have shown up in his music in subtle ways. He even filmed the official music video for \"Beautiful Things\" against the majestic backdrop of the red rock bluffs outside St. George, Utah (which just so happens to be this writer's hometown!).\n\nHe Serves As His Own Creative Team\n\nBoone's creative side extends beyond the realm of music: he's also a talented artist who often draws the cover art for his own singles. When \"Ghost Town\" was released in 2021, he showed off his skills by sketching the song's artwork for Spotify's Today's Top Hits — even admitting it was his first time attempting to draw a self-portrait with charcoal.\n\n\"I've always loved drawing and painting,\" Boone said of his artistic flair in a 2023 interview, also noting that he designs all his own merchandise. \"I get that from my dad…My dad's, like, a crazy artist, he's so good. And so it's kinda just always been something that I've done.\"\n\nHe's An Avid Rollerblader\n\nAs the name of his upcoming Fireworks and Rollerblades World Tour would suggest, Boone is both a self-proclaimed adrenaline junkie and has a not-so-secret passion for rollerblading. In fact, the singer's TikTok feed is littered with videos of himself landing tricks, stunts and, of course, flips on wheels in between the requisite promo material teasing new music like his upcoming single \"Slow It Down,\" footage from live shows and other viral TikTok content.\n\nWhat other tricks does Benson Boone have up his sleeve for the rest of 2024? Judging by his meteoric chart success thus far, the world is eagerly waiting to find out.\n\n25 Artists To Watch In 2024: Chappell Roan, VCHA, Teezo Touchdown & More\n\nSummer may be slowly edging toward fall, but the red-hot streak of this summer's musical output shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nThis New Music Friday (Aug. 16), Post Malone goes country with his sixth studio album F-1 Trillion, Meghan Trainor adds four songs (and rearranges the track list) to the deluxe edition of her latest LP Timeless, and global girl group KATSEYE unveil their debut mini-album SIS (SOFT IS STRONG). Plus, Muscadine Bloodline share their fourth full-length The Coastal Plain and Nikka Costa drops Dirty Disco, her first album in eight years.\n\nWhen it comes to singles, there's just as many new songs to explore — from superstar collabs like ROSALÍA and LISA's empowered \"NEW WOMAN\" to the latest releases from Hozier and Peggy Gou.\n\nBelow, dive into eight more new releases from pop and K-pop to rap, rock, country, dance, and more.\n\nLady Gaga & Bruno Mars — \"Die With a Smile\"\n\nLady Gaga and Bruno Mars gave the world just 12 hours notice that they were dropping \"Die With a Smile\" this week, sending Little Monsters and Hooligans alike into a tizzy as they braced themselves for the surprise duet.\n\nMars' sensual vocals lead off the moony, apocalyptic love song, which marks Mars' first release since his GRAMMY-winning work with Anderson .Paak as Silk Sonic. Strumming an electric guitar, the 15-time GRAMMY winner vows, \"I, I just woke from a dream/ Where you and I had to say goodbye/ And I don't know what it all means/ But since I survived, I realized/ Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow.\"\n\nAs for Mother Monster's oeuvre, \"Die With a Smile\" lands somewhere between Joanne and \"Shallow\" as her fans wait impatiently for LG7. Not to be outdone, Gaga takes over on the second verse, supported by Mars' swooning harmonies as the duo crescendo the intensity of their devotion to meet the literal end of the world.\n\nLISA & ROSALÍA — \"NEW WOMAN\"\n\nOn New Music Friday eve, BLACKPINK member LISA added to her blossoming collection of solo bangers with \"NEW WOMAN,\" an empowering shapeshifter of a duet that sees her joining forces with ROSALÍA.\n\n\"Hit it when I serve/ B—, you better swerve/ Revving up my aura/ Focus on my mind/ Taking my time/ I'm a new woman, woman,\" the K-pop star proudly announces on the chorus of the song before Rosalía slams on the brakes to sing and rap her way through a sultry verse in her native Spanish that translates, in part, to \"I was born pure, yes/ Not an era will be a flop in my future/ W—, I'm Rosalía, I only know how to serve.\"\n\nThe accompanying Dave Meyers-directed video is filled with high-fashion looks (thigh-high boots on fire, that massive, floor-sweeping pearl necklace…or is it made of ball bearings?), Y2K nostalgia (flip phones!) and a bevy of quirky, genuinely off-beat moments that will be sure to help drive the conversation as LISA continues to establish herself — and her nascent LLOUD partnership under RCA Records — as a global force in control of her musical destiny.\n\nBenson Boone — \"Pretty Slowly\"\n\nFresh off \"Death Wish Love\" — his folksy contribution to the Twisters soundtrack — Benson Boone uses his newest single \"Pretty Slowly\" to celebrate his sudden rise as one of pop music's shiniest new stars.\n\nThe deceptively upbeat track's lyrics reflect on the dissolution of a relationship lost to all the recent, stratospheric changes in his life as he croons, \"Oh, how come all the best things fall apart/ And it started pretty slowly/ When you asked about the old me/ Oh, is he gone? Oh, is he gone/ Oh, I don't know/ I think I left him somewhere I no longer go.\"\n\nHowever, the song's accompanying music video acts as a both a victory lap in the wake of his debut album, Fireworks & Rollerblade, from earlier this summer and and energetic peek into the \"Beautiful Things\" breakout's high-octane live show — complete with thousands of ecstatic fans and his signature, onstage backflips.\n\nYG — 'Just Re'd Up 3'\n\nMore than a decade after his 2013 mixtape Just Re'd Up 2, YG adds to the series with the long-awaited Just Re'd Up 3.\n\nThe Compton native has released six other albums and a litany of other mixtapes and collaborative projects in the interim, and his decade-plus in the spotlight allows him to recruit a wide array of contemporaries for the two-disc LP — from Saweetie (\"SHE PRETTY\") and Ty Dolla $ign (\"IT'S GIVIN,\" \"RESCUE ME\") to Tee Grizzley and G Herbo (\"MALIBU\") and Lil Yachty and Babyface Ray (\"STUPID\").\n\nJean Dawson & Lil Yachty — \"Die For Me\"\n\n\"Die For Me,\" Jean Dawson's new collaboration with Lil Yachty, blends the experimental leanings of the L.A.-based polymath (and musical arranger on Beyoncé's COWBOY CARTER) with the bubblegum trap rapper's one-of-a-kind flow — and the result is magnetic.\n\nSonically, the swirling track feels like a logical follow-up to Bad Cameo, the \"Poland\" rapper's recent collaborative album with James Blake. After Dawson warbles the hook (\"Don't show up at my funeral/ If you won't die for me\"), Lil Yachty grabs the mic for a blunt-force eulogy that demands repeated listening.\n\nMorgan Wade — 'Obsessed'\n\nMorgan Wade preceded her fourth album, Obsessed, with delicate, heart-on-her-sleeve singles like \"2AM in London\" and \"Time to Love, Time to Kill.\" Arriving almost a year to the day since her previous full-length Psychopath, the country upstart — and occasional Real Housewives of Beverly Hills guest star — is just as vulnerable on the rest of the album.\n\nShowing off her aptitude for laying bare emotional storytelling and heart-crushing nostalgia, Wade cleverly exposes her fragilities and regrets across the album's 14 tracks — whether she's gender-flipping Shakespeare and competing with Romeo on the forbidden \"Juliet,\" finding somber inspiration in fairy tales on the wistful \"Hansel and Gretel,\" or duetting with Kesha on the repentant \"Walked on Water.\"\n\nFalling In Reverse — 'Popular Monster'\n\nSeven years since 2017's Coming Home, Falling In Reverse are back with their fifth studio album, Popular Monster. The LP's rollout has been spread across nearly half a decade, with the title track being released as the lead single way back in November 2019. Six additional singles have followed in the lead-up to the long-awaited project, including collaborations with Tech N9ne and Slaughter to Prevail vocalist Alex Terrible (\"Ronald\") and Jelly Roll (\"All My Life\"), as well as a reimagined cover of Papa Roach's \"Last Resort.\"\n\nAnd while Popular Monster's cover art is plastered with frontman Ronnie Radke's 2012 mugshot for alleged domestic assault, the release is hardly a solo project. In fact, it's the first Falling in Reverse album to feature Max Georgiev on guitar, Tyler Burgess on bass and Luke Holland on drums. (Derek Jones, the band's late rhythm guitarist, also contributed to the title track before his untimely death in 2020 from a subdural hematoma.)\n\nDJ Snake & Fridayy — \"Complicated\"\n\nFridayy is practically begging to keep things simple on \"Complicated,\" his yearning, pulsating new collaboration with DJ Snake. \"Tell me what you want/ Girl, I want to know/ Please don't make it complicated/ We ain't gotta complicate it,\" he repeats over the DJ's hypnotic rhythms filled with Spanish guitar and distant jungle sounds.\n\nEventually, the three-time GRAMMY nominee's desperate pleas morph into an atmospheric echo as DJ Snake's handiwork takes center stage, plunging the track into a spellbinding synth breakdown that dances all the way to the finish.\n\nThe Latest Pop Music News & Releases\n\nFor a dozen years now, Imagine Dragons have delivered melodic anthems that have resonated with audiences from Idaho to Italy. Whether you call the band’s sound arena rock, power pop or formulaic does not matter. What does is the effect these soundscapes have on the masses, album after album.\n\nThe Las Vegas trio of Dan Reynolds, Ben McKee and Wayne Sermon may divide critics and peers, but there is no denying they are master craftsmen of earworms. The GRAMMY-winning group has served hit after Billboard-topping hit, racking up sales of 74 million album equivalents, 65 million digital songs and over 160 billion streams.\n\nFrontman and chief lyricist Reynolds despises labels and says conversations about genre are \"trite.\" And, anyway, the songwriter does not make music with fans or critics in mind. Instead, it’s about what he's feeling at any given moment and whether the melody moves him.\n\n\"I love things that are melodic,\" Reynolds tells GRAMMY.com. \"I was a classical pianist for 10 years from six to 16 — playing Chopin, Beethoven and Bach — and their songs feature pleasing melodies and intervals. My brain was formed in that classical piano training and that’s still where I write melodies from.\"\n\nOn their sixth studio album, Loom, Imagine Dragons continue the upward trajectory that started with their GRAMMY-winning debut Night Visions. Loom features nine new songs marked by big choruses, pleasing melodies and lyrics that concurrently make you cringe at the clichés and sing along.\n\nFollowing a period of heavy loss for Reynolds when his grief hung like an invisible cobweb clouding his thoughts — and that Mercury - Acts 1 & 2 chronicled in song— Imagine Dragons went their separate ways. A break was needed and family time called before any thoughts were given to what loomed next.\n\nLearn more: Inside Imagine Dragons' Biggest Hits: Dan Reynolds Details How \"Believer,\" \"Radioactive\" & More Came To Be\n\nLoom is definitely a more joyful record, but buried beneath these sanguine melodies there is still some sadness. In between recording the last album and this one, Reynolds went through a divorce — a life change that is explored in songs like \"Don’t Forget Me\" and \"Fire in These Hills.\"\n\nFor Reynolds, playing live to sold-out arenas and seeing thousands of strangers singing — just like writing songs — is therapeutic. Sporting a plain white t-shirt, with a rack of guitars behind him, the singer-songwriter discussed navigating change, catharsis, the inspirations behind Loom, and why he makes music today is no different than what led him to penning his first-ever song.\n\n\"I’m in therapy every week and I have been since I was young,\" says Reynolds, adding that he started writing music at age 12 to handle emotional distress. \"I didn’t know how to say what I was feeling and it wasn’t working by just writing it in a journal. Something about singing those words and putting it over a sonic soundscape felt cathartic. This record was no different and it felt really good.\"\n\nAhead of Loom’s release on June 28, GRAMMY.com chatted with Reynolds via Zoom about the inspirsations behind what he considers the band’s most colorful record. The 36-year-old melody maker appeared affable, admitted to currently being sober, and that he was excited to hit the road again with his bandmates for a 30-plus date North American tour that begins at the end of July.\n\nA Sense Of Foreboding, Good And Bad\n\nMultiple members of Imagine Dragons threw out names for their new record, Reynolds notes. \"'Loom' just came to me out of nowhere during the filming of our first video. I was like, 'Guys, what do you think?' Within minutes they all loved it.\"\n\nReynolds likes the ideas and connotations that come with such a simple word: that something is coming. \"The word feels ominous, but it can also be positive,\" he explains. \"This record really dives into change as a lot of change was happening in my life when I wrote these songs.\"\n\nBeyond those looming feelings, good and bad, Reynolds says he also loved \"loom\" as a noun. \"It’s a very colorful record and a loom brings to mind the intertwining of different colors.\"\n\nMattman & Robin\n\nAfter working with Rick Rubin and having several \"cooks in the kitchen\" on the last record, Swedish duo Mattman and Robin (Mattias Per Larsson and Robin Lennart Fredriksson) were the sole studio chefs spearheading this production. The difference is reflected in Loom's finished sound.\n\n\"This record is solely Mattman & Robin and because of that it’s our most cohesive, concise and pointed record,\" Reynolds says. \"For our own sanity, this time we wanted to make a record that told a very specific story and that sounded like a specific color. I believe we accomplished that better than ever before because we worked with only one producer.\"\n\nStarting From Square One\n\nThe creation of the Imagine Dragons’ sixth album also differed from all their previous projects when it came to the artistic approach and the song-selection process. \"For every other record, I arrived at the studio with 150 or more demos that I had put down over a two-year period,\" Reynolds recalls, adding that the group brought in about 200 demos, selected 70, and recorded 50 during their sessions with Rick Rubin.\n\nWhile Reynolds had about 150 demos this time around, Mattman and Robin suggested that they \"wipe the slate clean, throw out all these demos, and start from square one.\" Reynolds loved the idea, \"because I love to write and I’m always writing.\"\n\nHe wrote about 30 new songs in the studio over four to six months, and then narrowed those down. \"It was all very collaborative.\"\n\nFeeling Colors\n\nReflecting about the completed record, Reynolds admits that Loom feels like the most up-tempo, concise body of work Imagine Dragons’ has ever done; it’s also the most colorful.\n\n\"That’s the reason we chose the sunset/sunrise artwork for the cover because the image can be perceived either way,\" Reynolds explains. \"The record feels like the beginning of things and also the death of things … It's all about change. There are definitely more bright songs than any other record we’ve done, but there are also moments of reflection and heartache.\"\n\nReynolds is not one to keep a diary or write notes on his phone. Music is his journal.\n\n\"I’ve never been a person to write down an idea and then work on that idea,\" the songwriter explains. \"I always write the same way: I sit down at a piano, with a guitar or at a computer with no theme in mind and create a soundscape that is an honest output of whatever I’m feeling. I then write lyrics and melody to that feeling. It’s been that same way since I was 12 and started writing songs … What I’m feeling in the moment is usually what it’s going to be.\"\n\nThe Beauty & Safety Of Metaphor\n\nEver since Reynolds started processing his emotions through music and penned his first song as a pre-teen, he hid behind metaphors — afraid to speak his truth. During these formative years, this truth-telling usually centered on his religious beliefs. Reynolds was raised, along with his nine siblings, as a follower of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Reynolds admits that he relied too heavily on figures of speech as a writer, especially when it came to describing his relationship with Mormonism.\n\nToday, the artist no longer hides behind his words. \"When I started writing, I was fearful of the people I love understanding what I was saying,\" Reynolds explains. \"I was not thinking back then about the common listener; the only ones who heard my music, from the time I was 12 to 14, were my parents and I sure as hell did not want my mom to hear a song and think, ‘Are you doubting Joseph Smith!’\"\n\nReynolds leaned into metaphor. \"so my mom would not know what I was talking about\" — and that trajectory continued into his writing style on the first few Imagine Dragons records.\n\n\"When I listen to Night Visions, it’s very metaphorical,\" Reynolds reflects. \"'Radioactive' is a song about depression; yet, most people hear it and think it’s a song about the apocalypse!\"\n\nHowever, some of Reynolds’ favorite songwriters — Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Bob Dylan and Cat Stevens — are not overly metaphorical. Working with Rick Rubin on the previous Imagine Dragons double record really helped the songwriter reduce his reliance on imagery and be more authentic. \"Rick was always telling me to peel back a little bit, become more vulnerable and stop being such a scaredy-cat,\" he says.\n\nMetaphors and deeper meanings aside, Reynolds stresses that while he tries to add some lyricism to his words. What matters most, he notes, is that he sings his truth and it’s believable.\n\nCh-Ch-Ch-Changes\n\nChange is a constant in life and that theme weaves throughout Loom. Like French writer Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr wrote in 1894, \"plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose.\" This aphorism, loosely translated, means the more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\n\"There are some things in my life that never change and I’ve accepted that,\" Reynolds says. \"One of them is that mental health has always been a bit of a struggle for me, but music helps a lot. At the same time, other things do change. I’m 36 now and I’m not the same person I was when we put out our first record and I was 22.\"\n\nThe throughline in Imagine Dragons' sound is \"the human experience told from a self-reflective narrative view,\" Reynolds continues, adding that Loom felt cathartic.\n\nFalse Empowerment\n\nLoom’s first single, \"Eyes Closed,\" arrived May 3. The genre-bending song fuses rap, rock and pop, to create another Imagine Dragons anthem.\n\n\"'Eyes Closed' is about something that looks perfect and idyllic and then you tap it and it falls into a million pieces,\" Reynolds explains. \"The idea behind that song is that I could do this with my eyes closed, it’s so easy, but the reality is I was not really loving myself or feeling any of those things I was writing about.\"\n\nIt's a theme Reynolds revisits often. \"I write a lot of songs because I’m in a bad place and I’m trying to bring about a false sense of confidence, security and empowerment,\" he says. \"I meet people and they say, ‘I work out to this song every morning and it gets my day going,’ and I reply, ‘I’m glad because I really wasn’t going that day!’\"\n\nTheir International Fanbase\n\nLoom closes with a reprise of \"Eyes Closed\" featuring Colombian reggaeton maestro J. Balvin. Imagine Dragons are no strangers to collabs. In the past, the band have recorded features with the likes of Kendrick Lamar, Lil Wayne and Wiz Khalifa, but as Reynolds explains, they are always selective in choosing these collaborations. \"We don’t collaborate a lot because personally I hate it when the artists I love collaborate too much. I’m like, I want to listen to you … I was waiting for a record from you.\n\n\"'Eyes Closed' really felt like the second verse could go in a different direction,\" Reynolds notes. \"I had been listening to something from J. Balvin and I said to the band, ‘This could be cool and interesting, why don’t we try it?’ I’m really happy with how it turned out.\"\n\nReynolds adds that Imagine Dragons has become more of an international group that's bigger outside of its home nation. Touring globally has been a boon for the band: \"We’ve enjoyed seeing and experiencing different cultures and witnessing how music bypasses all cultures,\" Reynolds says. \"We go places where English is not the first language and people still seem to understand everything we are saying because they just feel it.\"\n\nReynold's Faith\n\nAs Reynolds’s conversation with GRAMMY.com comes to a close, the songwriter is asked about the inspiration behind the sixth song on Loom: \"God’s Don’t Pray.\"\n\n\"It wouldn’t be an Imagine Dragons record without me alluding to my faith,\" he says. \"I’m not a religious person anymore, but as anyone who grows up in religion knows — especially when the rest of your family still follows that faith — it’s still such a prevalent part of your life that it is impossible to write a record without delving into religiosity and the lack thereof.\"\n\n5 Inspirations Behind Don McLean's New Album 'American Boys': Rock 'N' Roll Heroes, George Floyd & Much More\n\nJune's rising temperatures bring a heat wave of releases, and also important events. Pride Month, Black Music Month, and Juneteenth all happen in the next four weeks, and whether it's to celebrate or to console our hearts, a variety of new albums will soundtrack this journey.\n\nThe first Friday of the month packs a powerful group of women: Charli XCX's will release Brat, Meghan Trainor's returns with Timeless, Carly Pearce brings forward hummingbird, Tems makes her official debut with Born in the Wild, and DJ Peggy Gou will also put out her first LP, I Hear You.\n\nWomen continue to dominate later in the month, and former Fifth Harmony members Normani and Camila Cabello will both drop new material with Dopamine and C,XOXO, respectively. Gracie Abrams will return with The Secret of Us, as well as Kate Nash and her 9 Sad Symphonies, Joni Mitchell and The Asylum Albums (1976-1980), and Kehlani with Crash.\n\nOf course, there will also be plenty of fresh music from male artists, too, like Peso Pluma's Éxodo, Imagine Dragons' Loom, Kygo's self-titled LP, Lucky Daye's Algorithm, as well as a new live album from Paul McCartney & Wings, titled One Hand Clapping. Closing out the month, all ears will be tuning in to Omar Apollo's God Said No, Lupe Fiasco's Samurai, Neil Young & Crazy Horse's Early Daze, a still unnamed Steve Aoki album, and many others.\n\nBelow, get to know more about 15 of the most exciting albums dropping in June 2024.\n\nCharli XCX — Brat\n\nRelease date: June 7\n\nThe reception to Charli XCX's upcoming album cover — a low-res image of the word \"brat\" centered in a lime green background — was controversial, but that was precisely her intention. \"I wanted to go with an offensive, off-trend shade of green to trigger the idea of something being wrong,\" the British singer told Vogue Singapore. \"I'd like for us to question our expectations of pop culture — why are some things considered good and acceptable, and some things deemed bad? ... I'm not doing things to be nice.\"\n\nFollowing 2022's Crash, Brat is Charli's sixth studio album, and boasts 15 club-ready tracks. Over on X (formerly Twitter), the pop provocateur stated that she \"was born to make dance music,\" and that this is the album she's \"always wanted to make.\" A preview of Brat's sleek, smacking sounds can be heard on singles \"Von Dutch\" and \"360,\" plus a few other tracks shared in advance. The album also includes \"So I,\" a tribute to late producer and DJ SOPHIE.\n\nIn support of the album, Charli lined up a slew of performances and DJ nights (dubbed Partygirl) in June, including stops in London, New York, and São Paulo. Later on, she will join Troye Sivan on their 2024 co-headlining Sweat Tour, set to kick off in September and hitting arenas around North America.\n\nTems — Born in the Wild\n\nRelease date: June 7\n\nNigerian singer Tems earned the eyes and the ears of international media with her Afrobeats-infused R&B. First raising attention with her feature in Wizkid's 2020 single \"Essence,\" she later built up a devoted fandom through two EPs: 2020's For Broken Ears and 2021's If Orange Was a Place. In 2022, she was credited as a featured artist in Future's \"Wait For U,\" which led her to win a GRAMMY for Best Melodic Rap Performance.\n\nOn June 7, Tems will release her long-awaited debut album, Born in the Wild. The official announcement came with a teaser video for the title track, disclosed one day after her Coachella set in April. \"It's all over the news, all over the news, I know this/ Under the sun, struggling to find my focus/ When I was young, younger then/ I was always running away,\" she sings, reflecting on her childhood in Lagos. \"I grew up in the wilderness/ Didn't know much about openness.\"\n\nThe record's first single,\"Love Me JeJe,\" came out on April 25, followed by the announcement of a world tour spanning Europe, North America, and Australia from June to November.\n\nCarly Pearce — hummingbird\n\nRelease date: June 7\n\n\"When you hear this album — wherever you are on your journey, I hope it shows you that pain can be a lesson that shows you just how strong you are and what you truly deserve,\" Carly Pearce wrote on Instagram as she announced her fourth studio album, hummingbird, in March.\n\nThe release follows 2021's 29: Written in Stone, which documented the country star's journey through marriage and divorce at the age of 29. \"The last few years have been a season of loss and growth, of healing and happiness,\" Pearce added. \"A belief that if I did the inner work, I would rebuild myself stronger than I was before, and a knowing that I have done some living and will always be unapologetic about it.\"\n\nHummingbird holds 14 tracks that encapsulate the GRAMMY-winning singer's redemption and \"true love for country music.\" Among them is her current single, \"We Don't Fight Anymore\" with Chris Stapleton, and the title track, and previously released tracks \"country music made me do it\", \"heels over head,\" \"my place,\" and \"fault line.\"\n\nPeggy Gou — I Hear You\n\nRelease date: June 7\n\nWith 2023's \"(It Goes Like) Nanana,\" DJ and singer Peggy Gou bounced from underground savant to worldwide summer queen. The single went viral on TikTok, entered charts across the globe, and led Gou to become one of the most in-demand electronic music artists in recent years — culminating with the title of first female DJ to headline Ushuaïa Ibiza.\n\nNow, the South Korean-born, Berlin-based phenom is gearing up to release her debut LP, I Hear You, out June 7 via XL Recordings. According to a press release, the album depicts Gou \"boldly claiming her voice through the kaleidoscopic lens of '90s house music.\" Featuring 10 tracks, it represents the \"culmination of years of work,\" and includes the aforementioned \"(It Goes Like) Nanana,\" 2021's \"I Go,\" \"I Believe in Love Again\" with Lenny Kravitz, and lead single \"1+1=11.\"\n\n\"I Hear You is more than just my debut album,\" Gou stated in the press release. \"It embodies countless hours of dedication in my journey to create something timeless, and is a testament to the power of listening, to ourselves and to each other.\"\n\nBon Jovi — Forever\n\nRelease date: June 7\n\nRock icons Bon Jovi have been active for so long that it feels accurate to name their 16th studio album \"Forever.\" In fact, the New Jersey band is celebrating their 40th anniversary with the release, set to drop on June 7.\n\n\"This record is a return to joy,\" said frontman Jon Bon Jovi in a statement. \"From the writing, through the recording process, this is turn up the volume, feel good Bon Jovi.\" Forever follows 2020's 2020, and marks the band's first release after Bon Jovi's vocal surgery in 2022. Ushering in this new chapter, they also shared a Disney+ four-part documentary named Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story, and lofty single \"Legendary.\"\n\nIn February of this year, Jon Bon Jovi was honored as the 2024 MusiCares Person Of The Year. The award recognized his extensive philanthropic work in a benefit gala during GRAMMY week — and granted the band yet another reason to celebrate.\n\nThe Decemberists — As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again\n\nRelease date: June 14\n\nFollowing a six-year hiatus, The Decemberists are back with their ninth record, As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again. The double-LP holds 13 tracks that are split into four thematic sides, and features guest appearances from The Shins' James Mercer and R.E.M.'s Mike Mills.\n\nAfter sharing the opener and lead single, \"Burial Ground,\" the folk rock band from Portland, Oregon, shared the 19-minute prog closer \"Joan in the Garden,\" which was inspired by the story of Joan of Arc — and ultimately teased As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again will have many musical layers.\n\n\"I wanted to make my own version of Joan,\" vocalist Colin Meloy said in a press release. \"But the song that came was as much about the creative process as it was about the actual woman, about angelic visitation and creative visitation and the hallucinogenic quality of both.\"\n\nLast month, The Decemberists announced a lengthy North American summer tour, starting on April 30 in Kingston, New York, and wrapping it up with a special hometown show on Aug. 3 in Troutdale, Oregon.\n\nNormani — Dopamine\n\nRelease date: June 14\n\nSince her highly addictive 2019 hit, \"Motivation,\" Normani has kept fans on the tip of their toes for a solo debut LP. She even turned their questioning into a website: wheresthedamnalbum.com. At last, the wait is finally over: after five long years, Dopamine will come out on June 14.\n\nThe album is spearheaded by lead single \"1:59,\" which features rapper Gunna and blooms with late '90s R&B inspiration. Normani also shared a sultry album teaser, \"Dopamine (First Dose),\" which features a snippet of her latest release from the album, the airy \"Candy Paint.\"\n\n\"The album feels like liberation, like a season of freedom,\" said the former Fifth Harmony member in an interview for WhoWhatWear earlier this year. \"Not just because the record is finally coming out, but because it's a celebration of everything I have been through to get to this moment … I know I needed time, experiences, and space coming out of [Fifth Harmony] in order to become the version of myself I needed to be.\"\n\nPeso Pluma — Éxodo\n\nRelease date: June 20\n\nAlmost exactly a year after releasing his third studio album, Génesis, Mexican star Peso Pluma follows his GRAMMY-winning LP by doubling down. Éxodo, his fourth studio effort, is a double album comprising 24 tracks — 16 corridos tumbados, 8 urbano songs — and a stellar guest list featuring Cardi B, Rich the Kid and Quavo, Anitta, and more.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Pluma stated that this album will confront more directly the negative press that surrounds him. \"[On Génesis] people already saw the good side, the superhero side. But I think this year, they're going to know a darker side,\" he added.\n\nHe's previewed Éxodo through seven tracks so far, including \"LA DURANGO\" with Junior H and Eslabón Armado, \"Rompe La Dompe\" also with Junior H and Oscar Maydon, and \"LA PEOPLE II\" with Tito Double P and Joel de la P. Pluma is currently on a massive arena tour throughout the U.S., set to conclude on October 11 in Montville, Connecticut.\n\nGracie Abrams — The Secret of Us\n\nRelease date: June 21\n\nSixteen months after releasing her debut album, Good Riddance, GRAMMY-nominated singer Gracie Abrams is already back with her second LP, The Secret of Us. Set to drop on June 21, the project holds 13 tracks and is led by the lively pop and sharp lyrics of \"Risk.\"\n\nThe single was co-written by Abrams and her childhood best friend, Audrey Hobert, and co-produced by Abrams and The National's Aaron Dessner (who helmed the production of Good Riddance). On Instagram, Abrams shared that she and her team \"had real, true fun writing this album,\" but that \"there were also the occasional tears.\" The raspy-voiced star also revealed The Secret's track list, which includes a collaboration with Taylor Swift in the track \"us.\"\n\nAbrams opened several dates of Swift's The Eras Tour in 2023. She'll celebrate her new album later this year by returning to the Eras Tour lineup, joining Swift again for the final North American shows in October, November and December.\n\nLake Street Dive — Good Together\n\nRelease date: June 21\n\n\"The ethos of Good Together can be described as 'joyful rebellion,' just as energetic and danceable as it is defiantly principled,\" reads a press release on Lake Street Dive's upcoming record. Produced by Mike Elizondo, the album's main goal is to \"highlight our shared humanity\" through the quintet's dynamic, genre-bending compositions.\n\n\"There's a lot to be angry about in the world right now, a lot of pain and rage and divisiveness, but it isn't sustainable to constantly live in that anger — you need something else to keep you going,\" drummer Mike Calabrese said in a statement. \"Joy is a great way to sustain yourself, and we wanted to encourage everyone to stay aware of that. In a way this album is our way of saying, 'Take your joy very seriously.'\" A glimpse of those feelings appear in the laid-back album singles \"Better Not Tell You\" and the title track.\n\nLake Dive Street have also announced the biggest world tour of the band's career, kicking off its North American leg on June 14 in Asbury Park, New Jersey, and wrapping on October 12 in Atlanta, Georgia. In January 2025, they head on to Europe and the U.K.\n\nKehlani — Crash\n\nRelease date: June 21\n\nIt's already summer in Kehlani's world — or at least this is what their single \"After Hours\" feels like. Marking the Californian singer's first release since 2022's Blue Water Road, \"After Hours\" samples Cordel \"Scatta\" Burrell's \"Coolie Dance Riddim\" and sets expectations high for their upcoming record, Crash.\n\nWhile little else is known about the album, Kehlani has been teasing bits and pieces of it on social media. She also released a second track, a booming dedication to a loved one called \"Next 2 U,\" which Kehlani declared is \"my favorite one\" from the album.\n\nThough Kehlani has yet to announce a coinciding tour for Crash, she'll play three shows at LIV Nightclub Las Vegas, in the Fontainebleau hotel. The first took place on May 31 — just hours after \"Next 2 U\" arrived — and the other two are on July 21 and Aug. 2.\n\nCamila Cabello — C,XOXO\n\nRelease date: June 28\n\nAnother Fifth Harmony alum will make a comeback this month: Camila Cabello is set to release her fourth album, C,XOXO, on June 28. The LP marks a new sonic and visual era for the Cuban-born, Miami-based artist, and its inaugural mark came in the form of platinum blonde locks.\n\n\"The voice that I found with my new album has this big baddie energy vibe,\" Cabello explained in a recent Billboard cover story. \"Part of that spirit is taking risks, not giving a f— and doing whatever you want. I think the blonde was me staying true to that feeling.\" The first single off the project, \"I LUV IT\" with Playboi Carti, displays how this fearless persona takes shape through hyperpop synths and a sample from Gucci Mane's \"Lemonade.\"\n\nCabello also realized that this LP was a love letter to the city of Miami. \"So much of the inspiration for this album was driving, listening to music, rolling the windows down and hearing what people in the city are listening to,\" she added. Among its collaborators are names like City Girls (\"DADE COUNTY DREAMING\"), Lil Nas X (\"HE KNOWS\"), and Drake, who features on \"HOT UPTOWN\" and \"UUUGLY.\"\n\nImagine Dragons — Loom\n\nRelease date: June 28\n\nUpon announcing Imagine Dragons' upcoming album, Loom, vocalist Dan Reynolds shared on Instagram that \"working on this record was a rollercoaster.\" As he explained, \"some days the songs came from a place of sadness and heartache and others joy and jubilance.\"\n\nA press release further elaborated that the quartet's sixth LP will \"represent the pinnacle of their artistic journey of self-discovery,\" while also balancing their familiar sounds with fresh ones. Through nine tracks, including lead single \"Eyes Closed,\" Loom intends to symbolize \"new beginnings on the horizon, the excitement for a new day, moments yet to come.\" As Reynolds added in his Instagram post, \"may the things that loom in the future and distance be a beautiful tapestry of joy and pain that you can hang on your wall to reflect on as life passes us by.\"\n\nThe festive vibes will extend throughout the year, as the Las Vegas outfit just announced a world tour, which kicks off on July 30 in Camden, New Jersey. So far, they will stop through multiple cities in the U.S. and Canada through Oct. 22, but international dates are expected for 2025.\n\nOmar Apollo — God Said No\n\nRelease date: June 28\n\n\"I gave it my everything,\" Omar Apollo said in a press release. \"And God said 'no.'\" Fortunately, the singer wasn't talking about crafting his sophomore LP, God Said No, but rather what led him to do it.\n\nThe 14-track record is described as \"a survey of the emotional wreckage that followed the end of a torrid love affair,\" and was partially recorded at the legendary Abbey Road Studios in London. To process his grief, Apollo spent three months in the British city, and soon began to shape his most \"soul-bearing and immediate body of work\" so far.\n\nIn addition to vulnerable singles \"Spite\" and \"Dispose of Me,\" Apollo also collaborated with musician Mustafa on \"Plane Trees,\" and confirmed a participation by actor Pedro Pascal in an unspecified track — likely to be his namesake, \"Pedro.\"\n\nLupe Fiasco — Samurai\n\nRelease date: June 28\n\nChicago rapper Lupe Fiasco is gearing up to release his ninth studio album, Samurai. Entirely produced by longtime collaborator Soundtrakk (who also produced Fiasco's previous effort, 2022's Drill Music In Zion), the record is \"smooth, yet cerebral, brimming with ideas,\" according to a press release. It is also one of Fiasco's most personal works to date: \"The album weaves things from my life as an artist, touching on things other artists go through,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSamurai's eight tracks accompany the narrative of a battle rapper's career, from first honing his skills until mastering his craft. \"Before rap even, martial arts was my whole life, and it still plays a huge role in my life,\" Fiasco added. \"The overall themes of the album speak to the constant fight and the battle one goes through being in the entertainment industry. Some of the things we need to defend.\"\n\nAs for the title, Fiasco shared that \"the word 'samurai' means to serve,\" and that his relationship to the word \"meant that you need to be at the service of other people, either in the overall community, or in this instance, the rap community at large that I've been a part of for years.\"\n\nTwenty One Pilots' Road To 'Clancy': How The New Album Wraps Up A Decade-Long Lore\n\nIf there's one way to describe Benson Boone's breakthrough year, look to the title of his debut album, Fireworks and Rollerblades.\n\nWhile the name was borrowed from a lyric on the LP, Boone sees it as a metaphor for his life: \"I feel like things have taken off for me like a firework tied to a rollerblade, all very quickly.\"\n\nHe's not wrong. In the three months since the pop singer/songwriter released the album's lead single, the booming ballad \"Beautiful Things,\" Boone has held a comfortable position in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 (peaking at No. 2 as of press time), held a five-week reign on Billboard's Global 200 chart, topped charts in multiple countries, and amassed nearly half a billion streams on Spotify alone. The song has helped Boone become one of the biggest breakout stars of 2024 so far, but his talent is something many have been seeing for the past few years.\n\nBuilding a career off of penning raw lyrics strung together with memorable hooks and thrashing piano riffs, the Washington native first made waves on social media and during Season 19 of \"American Idol\" in 2021, where judge Lionel Richie pointed out his natural talent: \"You know, there's some folks who need to practice, and there's some folks who are just gifted at it.\" That same quality caught the ear of Imagine Dragons' Dan Reynolds, who promptly signed the rising star to his Warner Records imprint Night Street Records right around the time Boone morphed into a TikTok superstar.\n\nHis powerful voice and penchant for vulnerability is what's had fans enthralled from the start, whether with early hit \"Ghost Town\" (a raw mediation on love with lyrics like,\"Maybe you'd be happier with someone else/ Maybe loving me's the reason you can't love yourself\") or the unflinching tracks on Fireworks and Rollerblades like the \"Beautiful Things\" follow-up \"Slow it Down\" (\"I get nervous, oh, I'm anxious/ Maybe loving you is dangerous\"). But for Boone, he simply doesn't know how to write any other way: \"Nobody is going to relate to your lyrics if they're not real.\"\n\nJust before releasing Fireworks & Rollerblades — and just after kicking off his sold-out tour of the same name — Boone spoke to GRAMMY.com about his success, debut album and the fine art of capturing authentic emotions in his work.\n\nIt's rare in today's zeitgeist to have a relatively new artist achieve the success you've seen recently. But now that you have the following, it becomes about following it up. So after the astronomical success of \"Beautiful Things,\" does that make releasing your debut album stressful or stress free?\n\nI definitely understand feeling the pressure for this album. But \"Beautiful Things\" was its own moment, and we worked very hard to get it to where that went — and I know that doesn't always happen, and I'm not expecting that. But I'm just doing my best to get the album to as many people as I can regardless of whether it doesn't stream at all or it does great.\n\nI'm truly so proud of these songs, and I've made something I love and that I'm passionate about. So I'm just excited to get my first album out.\n\nHow do you usually write a song? Do you have one surefire way?\n\nI think the last couple of months I've kind of tapped into how I'll probably write for most of the rest of my life. It's just me and the piano, usually late at night when I can't sleep. I'll sit there and start playing chords and singing random melodies. That's how it starts, and I'll take it down to the studio to beat it up and hopefully get a song [out of it].\n\nTony Bennett once said, \"if you steal from one person, you're just a thief. But if you steal from everyone, that's research.\" When you were first getting started, who were your musical inspirations?\n\nGrowing up I listened to a lot of Billy Joel, Sam Smith, Adele, Stevie Wonder, and Queen; these are artists who use their voice as the main instrument for their songs. I think I took a lot of aspects from that into my own music and that's kind of how I operate. So when I write, I let my voice lead where the song goes. I think that's what I naturally picked up listening to those artists.\n\nMany of your songs have deep emotion at their core. For example, on Fireworks and Rollerblades, you have a song called \"Cry\" and the lyrics go, \"Cry cry cry/ Go ahead and ruin someone else's life.\" These are heavy sentiments. Does a weight come off your chest when you write these lyrics?\n\nI think every song is very different; some of them are sad and some aren't. But I do like to pull inspiration from whatever I'm feeling at the time. So whatever I'm going through, that's when I want to write a song; when I'm feeling those emotions the strongest.\n\nNo matter what situation I'm in, I always feel better writing something in the middle of whatever emotion I'm feeling. So it does help me. It's therapeutic.\n\nHave you ever written a lyric and then wound up deleting or rewriting it because you thought it was too personal or too revealing?\n\nHonestly, no. I never want something to come out about someone else that they wouldn't want out, so I would never name drop somebody or say something personal about someone else. But for me, I'm not scared to be personal; being vulnerable is the most important thing in songwriting.\n\nWhen you're finally performing a song you've written however long after, what's it like to hear people sing these emotional lyrics back to you? Do they still have that power for you, or have you worked through them in the interim and they lose that grip?\n\nI think depending on the song, they never lose their grip. A song like \"In the Stars,\" I'll always remember why I wrote that and I'll always think of that. But when I'm performing live, I'm not trying to get everyone to think of my experience because I understand that everybody has their own experience they can relate to. It's not always my grandma, it's not always my girlfriend, it's not always my parents or experiences. It's the audience's experiences, friends, significant others. So when I perform, I don't always think of something I've written a song about but rather giving them something that they can take and grip onto instead.\n\nSpeaking of, can you take me back to the late night awhile back when you wrote \"Beautiful Things\"? How was that particular one born?\n\nWell, I had just moved to LA, and all I had in my house were a mattress and a piano. There were two nights I could not sleep hardly at all and I went downstairs that first night and wrote its verse and medley. But I couldn't really figure out a chorus, so I went back to bed.\n\nThe next night I came up with a completely new song and idea, and wrote a chorus but couldn't think of any verses. The next day I happened to have a session with two people I love very much, Jack LaFrantz and Evan Blair, and I showed them the verses idea and we sat there and couldn't figure out where we wanted to take the chorus. So separately I showed them my other chorus idea, and Jack said, \"Why don't we make it the same song and make this the chorus?\" And that's kind of how the structure of \"Beautiful Things\" came, but we worked on it for a long time.\n\nOnce it came together, we were like \"This song is insane and it has so much potential.\" I've never had a song written like that, ever.\"\n\nWhere did the name of the album, Fireworks and Rollerblades, come from? Do you have a typical way of thinking of titles?\n\nEach one is different, but that title came from a lyric from one of the songs called \"Hello Love.\" It goes: \"I can try to blame you but my mind ain't safe/ Like two fireworks tied to a rollerblade.\" It always stuck out to me and in the session I wrote that, I said, \"Dude, if this is part of an album, we should name it Fireworks and Rollerblades, imagine how sick that would be.\" Everybody was super hyped on the idea, and it actually happened. I loved the lyric and that sentiment.\n\nIt's also similar to my life: I feel like things have taken off for me like a firework tied to a rollerblade, all very quickly. And rollerblading is something I love, so it all made sense. I'm so happy with that title.\n\nLet's talk about the single \"Slow It Down,\" an ironic title considering it went viral immediately out of the gate.\n\nI think a lot of people I talked to were like, \"Oh the pressure's on for this song!\" after \"Beautiful Things.\" But I love \"Slow It Down,\" and writing it was so natural. Some people were listening to me write it and it came together so organically.\n\nIt's another very personal song for me. I'm trying my hardest to do my best, and that's all I can do. I can't force people to like or listen to that song. I'm just hoping that it resonates.\n\nHow do you know when you're finished with something? Can you easily step away?\n\nI try not to think of deadlines. I'm very particular about how a song sounds, especially its production and how the vocals are treated. Every sound matters to me. Some songs come together a lot faster. But if it's not a simple production, sometimes they take a while and I have to rethink parts and then go sit with the producer and have them do this and this. Some of them take weeks, some of them take months, some of them take days. Each song is so incredibly different.\n\nFor Fireworks and Rollerblades, some tracks took a lot longer than I thought, especially \"Beautiful Things\" actually. It's always a rollercoaster trying to finish a song and the last 10 percent is the hardest part. But it paid off, and I'm so glad.\n\n25 Artists To Watch In 2024: Chappell Roan, VCHA, Teezo Touchdown & More"
