        "text": "Eric J. Holcomb, 51st Governor of the State of Indiana, is a lifelong Hoosier who was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, graduated from Pike High School in Indianapolis and Hanover College in southeastern Indiana. He went on to serve six years in the U.S. Navy, first at Naval Station Great Lakes and later in Florida and Portugal. Holcomb is currently serving in his second term as governor having been elected in 2016 and 2020 when he received the most votes for governor in Indiana History. Prior to his election as governor, Holcomb served as Indiana’s 51st Lieutenant Governor. A basketball fan and collector of presidential signatures, Holcomb has not only made a basket in each of Indiana's 92 counties but also possesses documents signed by every U.S. president.\n\nEarning a reputation as a pragmatic consensus builder, Holcomb frequently travels throughout the state, visiting with Hoosiers about how to make Indiana the best place in the world to live, work, study, play and stay. Under Holcomb’s leadership, Indiana’s economy is strong, the state’s finances are honestly balanced, and the state is streamlining government services and returning dollars to Hoosier taxpayers, while simultaneously delivering significant investments and advancements in infrastructure, education, workforce, quality of life and public health.\n\nDuring Holcomb’s terms, Indiana employees and employers have enjoyed consecutive record-breaking years of job commitments. In 2022, companies committed a record-breaking $22.2 billion in capital investment. In 2023, Forbes recognized Indiana as the best state in the U.S. to start a business. Actively seeking to build global relationships and attract investments in Indiana’s economic growth, Holcomb has made 18 international trips as governor, visiting more than 20 nations. With Holcomb at the helm Indiana touts a sterling AAA credit rating.\n\nMaintaining Indiana’s “Crossroads of America” infrastructure and strengthening Indiana’s connections between our communities is a top priority for Holcomb. He implemented a long-term, fully-funded 20-year, $60 billion Next Level Roads program. Holcomb has strengthened communities and improved quality of life with the Next Level Trails program, the largest-ever state investment in Indiana's trail systems a $180 million investment, and $35 million for land conservation efforts. In 2019 and again in 2022, CNBC ranked Indiana number one in the nation for infrastructure.\n\nHolcomb has worked to align Indiana’s K-12, higher education, workforce and economic development efforts to empower Hoosiers with the necessary skills to succeed in the economy of the future. He launched the Next Level Jobs program to prepare and connect more Hoosiers to high-demand, high-wage careers. He has signed historic investments in education into law, including a $1.47 billion increase in K-12 tuition support in 2024 and 2025. Under Holcomb's leadership, Indiana has become a trailblazer for school choice and parental empowerment by expanding vouchers, enhancing charter school access, and advancing work-based learning.\n\nIn 2023, Holcomb led the effort to transform public health funding in Indiana yielding a %1,500 increase in state dollars to local health departments. This followed the recommendations from the Governor’s Public Health Commission that Holcomb created in 2021. Politico recognized Holcomb’s leadership on public health saying, “Indiana may offer a conservative model for improving fragile and beleaguered public health systems and countering the growing opposition to them that’s dominating the discourse.”\n\nHolcomb serves on the Executive Committee of the National Governors Association and Republican Governors Association. In 2018, The Hill named him one of ten governors shaping the future of politics. An article in Governing magazine read, “Indiana’s governor doesn’t scream, doesn’t threaten, and doesn’t even complain. He just wins.”\n\nHolcomb and his wife, Janet, live with their cat, Topper, in the Governor’s Residence in Indianapolis."
