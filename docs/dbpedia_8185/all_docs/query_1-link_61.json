        "text": "FAITH’S WORLD\n\nDirected by Faith Guilbault (USA)\n\nDisability\n\nSixteen-year-old Faith Guilbault from Baltimore, Maryland, loves skydiving, horseback riding, and has walked the runway at Fashion Week in New York City. She is also one of 61 million people in the United States living with a disability.\n\nGuilbault is visually impaired and has cerebral palsy, which affects her ability to move and maintain balance and posture. Yet Guilbault does not want anyone to feel sorry for her. She is resilient, hard-working, and determined to realize her dreams.\n\nWith guidance from filmmaker Joyce Chopra, Guilbault shines light on her world, inviting viewers to focus on the similarities rather than differences between abled and disabled people.\n\nDIRECTOR’S STATEMENT\n\n“There are plenty of times when I’m down or frustrated, but I have learned that nothing good comes from that negative perspective. Life is so much better when you look at the good in people and find the positive in every situation, no matter how bad it may seem.”\n\n– Faith Guilbault\n\nMENTOR’S STATEMENT"
