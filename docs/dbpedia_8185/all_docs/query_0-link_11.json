As the Lead Pastor of Journey of Faith, I pray that your life is forever impacted in a way that blesses even those that you encounter on your journey, as a result of your visit here.\n\nJourney of Faith, is a growing multi-cultural church family in the Northeast Houston Metro Area that is impacting the landscape of the world as disciple makers, starting with our local community. We realize that prayer is one of our most undervalued tools for reaching a dying world, and we are committed to using prayer to confront that which does not line up with Godâ€™s will on Earth. Prayer is the cornerstone for how we at Journey of Faith are committed to engaging the world today, and how we will intercede for our brothers and sisters everywhere across our city, nation, and world.\n\nPowerful worship and the preached Word of God are essential components of our weekly gatherings at Journey of Faith. We are a community that is passionate about our worship encounter with God through the Holy Spirit, and realize that our worship experience prepares us to receive Biblical preaching which empowers us to live more faithfully as we live out this journey called, life. For this reason, we are called to be the church that builds faith and provides hope through Christ-centered love."
