        "text": "Thy Kingdom Come (TKC) is a global ecumenical prayer movement that invites Christians around the world to pray from Ascension to Pentecost for more people to come to know Jesus.\n\nSince it began in May 2016, God has grown TKC from a dream of possibility into a movement which unites more than a million Christians in prayer, in nearly 90% of countries worldwide, across 85 different denominations and traditions- so that friends and family, neighbours and colleagues might come to faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nEvery person, household and church are encouraged to pray during the 11 days in their own way.\n\nIt is our hope & prayer, that those who have not yet heard the Good News of Jesus Christ and His love for the world, will hear it for themselves and respond and follow Him.\n\nSpecifically, we again invite each and every Christian across the globe to pray that God’s Spirit might work in the lives of 5 people who have not responded with their ‘Yes’ to God’s call.\n\nWhether you have joined in ‘Thy Kingdom Come’ before or not, we invite you to take part & join in.\n\n“In praying 'Thy Kingdom Come' we all commit to playing our part in the renewal of the nations and the transformation of communities.\" Archbishop Justin Welby"
