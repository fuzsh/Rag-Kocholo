        "text": "Introduction\n\nResearch carried out by Brierley Consultancy in the UK, and published in Church Statistics gives an insight into the membership of churches, the number of places of worship and ministers. Data was published for 2005-2010, together with forecasts up to 2025.\n\nThe British Religion in Numbers website has additional data on Christianity in the UK.\n\nAlso included on this page are statistics from the UK Censuses, which were held in 2011 and 2021, and the British Social Attitudes Surveys (1983-2018).\n\nKey Findings\n\nBelief in God - 2016\n\nA poll by You Gov in December 2016 produced the following results for persons asked if they believe in God or a higher spiritual power:\n\nSome key findings from the Church Statistics1 report are:\n\nUK Church membership has declined from 10.6 million in 1930 to 5.5 Million in 2010, or as a percentage of the population; from about 30% to 11.2%.\n\nBy 2013, this had declined further to 5.4 million (10.3%). If current trends continue, membership will fall to 8.4% of the population by 2025.2\n\nIn England, membership is forecast to decline to 2.53 million (4.3% of the population) by 2025.\n\nOver the period 2005-2010, the major Christian denominations such as Anglican, Catholic and Presbyterian all saw falls in membership. Orthodox, Pentecostal and other new churches (Evangelical and Charismatic) on the other hand, saw an increase in membership.\n\nChurch membership is declining in all four constituent countries of the UK, but in England the decline is relatively small, whereas the biggest decline appears to be in Scotland.\n\n1 The Church Statistics document gives an overview of the various definitions of 'membership' used by different Christian Denominations.\n\n2 Source: Church Statistics 2\n\nChurch Attendance in Britain\n\nBrierley Consultancy have also published statistics for church attendance (as opposed to membership) for the period 1980-2015. Key findings are:\n\nChurch attendance has declined from 6,484,300 to 3,081,500 (equivalent to a decline from 11.8% to 5.0% of the population).\n\nEngland has the lowest percentage of the population attending church in 2015 (4.7%), just below Wales at 4.8%. In Scotland, the equivalent figure is 8.9%\n\nWIN/Gallup Survey (2014)/Pew Forum Surveys (2015-17)\n\nA 2014 survey of approximately 64,000 people in 65 countries revealed the UK to be one of the world's most irreligious countries, with only 30% of those surveyed identifying as 'religious'. In contrast, 13% said they were convinced atheists and 53% of those surveyed said they were not religious.\n\nThe top two and bottom two countries together with the UK are shown below:\n\nThe 2015-17 surveys conducted by Pew Forum gave the following results:\n\nThe United Kingdom is the 29th most religious out of 34 European countries.\n\n11% in the United Kingdom are highly religious, based on an overall index.\n\n10% say religion is very important in their lives.\n\n20% say they attend religious services at least monthly.\n\n6% say they pray daily.\n\n12% say they believe in God with absolute certainty.\n\nGeneral Statistics\n\nReligion in the UK - Census 2011\n\nIn percentage terms, the numbers of Christians fell by 12.4%.\n\nFor the four constituent countries of the UK, the Christian percentage was as follows:\n\nEngland: 59.4%\n\nNorthern Ireland: 82.3%\n\nScotland: 53.8%\n\nWales: 57.6%\n\nIrreligion in the UK - Census 2011\n\nPercentage of persons who indicated they were not affiliated with any religion.\n\nThe 2011 census saw the numbers of irreligious persons rise from 7.7 million in 2001 to 14.1 million, a rise of 10.3% to 25.7%.\n\nIn one city in England (Norwich), the percentage of irreligious persons was as high as 42.5%.\n\nThe percentage of people who said they were Christian(46.2%) represents a drop of 13.1% since the last census in 2011. In contrast, the percentage identifying as having no religion has increased by 12%.\n\nBritish Social Attitudes Surveys (1983 Onwards)\n\nBSAS 2014\n\nBSAS 1983-2018\n\nSource: BSA Data\n\nNote: The BSA data indicates that, over the period 1983 to 2014 :\n\n1. The Church of England population has nearly halved (from 16.5m to 8.6m);\n\n2. The Catholic population has remained relatively steady (from 4.1 to 4m);\n\n3. Non-Christian religious numbers have increased five-fold (from 0.8m to 4m);\n\n4. Persons of no religious affiliation have nearly doubled (from 12.8m to 24.7m).\n\nSSAS 1999-2016\n\nSource: SSA Data"
