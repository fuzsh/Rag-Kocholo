        "text": "Andrew Wommack\n\nAndrew Wommack’s life was forever changed the moment he encountered the supernatural love of God on March 23, 1968. Since then, he has made it his mission to change the way the world sees God. The author of more than forty books and the founder and president of Charis Bible College, Andrew has a heart for discipleship and teaches biblical truths with clarity and simplicity.\n\nHis Gospel Truth television show emphasizes God’s unconditional love and grace and is broadcast around the globe. He started Charis Bible College in 1994 with a vision to prepare men and women for ministry with a unique blend of the teaching of God’s Word and practical “on-the-job” training. Andrew is also the president of the Truth & Liberty Coalition, an organization that seeks to educate, unify, and mobilize believers to impact culture and effect godly change on important social issues. Andrew and his wife, Jamie, have been married for more than 50 years.\n\nDuane Sheriff\n\nDuane Sheriff is an author, internationally known apostolic teacher, conference speaker, and host of the Grace and Truth broadcast. He is the founding pastor of Victory Life Church, headquartered in Durant, Oklahoma. Under his leadership, the church grew from a doublewide trailer to a multi-campus church in three states. In 2020, Duane passed the leadership of Victory Life Church to his son, Jacob, and currently serves as a Senior Elder and one of the lead communicators. He lives by his life mission: To Help People Grow in Christ. His humor and unique revelation of scripture present the Gospel with clarity and simplicity. His passion for sharing the truth of God’s word helps people develop a personal relationship with Jesus as they discover their true identity and become all God created them to be. Since 1983, Duane Sheriff Ministries has given away millions of teaching messages completely free. \"Andrew’s teaching ministry touched and inspired me long before meeting him in person. He is a man of integrity, and he has such a passion for teaching the Uncompromised Word of God. It has been a privilege over the years to hear Andrew share his ‘vision’ and then witness the completion of those momentous projects. It is an honor to partner with Andrew and serve on the Board of Directors.\" Duane and his wife, Sue, have been married for over forty years and have four children and eleven grandchildren. Duane enjoys hunting and spending time with his family, especially the grandkids.\n\nCarrie Pickett\n\nCarrie Pickett has been a believer for over thirty years and has a passion for teaching God’s Word. After graduating from Charis Bible College in 1999, she moved to Russia to plant a Charis campus. While in Russia, Carrie met her husband, Mike. Together they grew the Russian ministry to reach over ten Russian-speaking nations. After sixteen years in Russia, Carrie and Mike relocated to Colorado, where Carrie now serves as the assistant vice president of Charis Bible College and International Operations of Andrew Wommack Ministries. She also serves as director of Charis Bible College Woodland Park and the director of the Global Training School. She has a heart to reach the world with the grace message and to see powerful ministers raised up with a Great Commission vision."
