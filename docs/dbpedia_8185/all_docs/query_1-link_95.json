        "text": "Situated in a residential area of northwest Tacoma, the college and seminary building provides classrooms, offices, library, and a bookstore. The city of Tacoma is located 40 miles south of Seattle and 30 miles south of SeaTac Airport in the southern part of the picturesque Puget Sound area of the Pacific Northwest. The area is renowned for the majestic beauty of Mt. Rainier and is within a two-hour drive of the Pacific Ocean. The institution does not have on-campus housing facilities; however, off-campus accommodations for single and married students are within easy walking distance. The responsibility for housing agreements is solely between the tenant (student) and the householder or apartment manager."
