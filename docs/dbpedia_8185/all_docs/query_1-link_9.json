        "text": "Officially founded March 30, 2018 in Tennessee as\n\nDoing Good Alliance International\n\nwith a doing business as name of Family of Faith Global Missions,\n\nFOFGM actually existed long before this legal start.\n\nMarie went on her first missions trip to Dominican Republic as a 13 year old. For three decades, Marie has continually gone to the international mission field on short term trips. As of 2020, Marie's total count is now at\n\n79 NATIONS.\n\nIn 2010, while pastoring in the San Diego area, Lloyd and Marie started taking their three kids across the border to work with orphans in Mexico. By 2019, the Tsuruda family of five had gone to over 40 nations together.\n\nMore than four million (4,000,000) kids have come to Christ through their missions work.\n\nYet, their goal is\n\none HUNDRED million souls in every nation.\n\nTo God be all the glory, great things He has done!\n\nRevelation 7:9 \"After this I looked, and there was an enormous crowd--no one could count all the people! They were from every race, tribe, nation, and language, and they stood in front of the throne and of the Lamb...\"\n\nMatthew 6:20-21\n\nLay up for yourselvestreasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\n\nJames 5:7\n\nBe patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth...\n\nPsalm 2:8\n\nAsk of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\n\nMatthew 19:14\n\nJesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
