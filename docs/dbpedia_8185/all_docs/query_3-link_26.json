        "text": "Mary and Joseph were betrothed and living in Nazareth, where the angel Gabriel had announced the coming birth of Jesus. But Bethlehem, not Nazareth, provided the environs for Jesus’s birth. A Roman census initiated by Caesar Augustus required everyone who owned property to register it in person for taxation purposes. Because Joseph was from Bethlehem, the census set them on the road to that village.\n\nThe Gospel writers make special effort to be sure we know that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, as it happened there to fulfill a promise the Lord had made through the prophet Micah. “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times” (Micah 5:2).\n\nMany babies were born in the Promised Land, but only a child born in Bethlehem qualified for consideration as the promised Messiah.\n\nWhy did the Lord pick Bethlehem? This was David’s hometown, a village that had enjoyed a long association with David’s ancestors, including his great-grandmother Ruth. To think about Bethlehem was to think about David. To think about David meant to think about the powerful promise the Lord had given him. One of David’s descendants would rise to sit on Israel’s throne and rule an eternal kingdom (2 Samuel 7:12–16). Thus an important link was forged through family history and prophecy. From the town of Bethlehem, which means “house of bread,” would come King Jesus who said, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry” (John 6:35)."
