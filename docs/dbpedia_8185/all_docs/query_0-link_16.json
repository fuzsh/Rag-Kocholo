        "text": "Archbishop Justin Welby\n\nThe Most Revd Justin Welby was ordained in 1992 after an 11-year career in the oil industry. He spent his first 15 years serving in Coventry diocese, often in places of significant deprivation.\n\nIn 2002 he was made a Canon of Coventry Cathedral, where he jointly led its international reconciliation work. During this time he worked extensively in Africa and the Middle East. Archbishop Justin has had a passion for reconciliation and peace-making ever since.\n\nHe was Dean of Liverpool from 2007 to 2011 and Bishop of Durham from 2011 to 2012, before being announced as the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury in late 2012.\n\nOn 21st March 2013, he was installed as Archbishop of Canterbury in a service at Canterbury Cathedral.\n\nIn his sermon he said: \"There is every possible reason for optimism about the future of Christian faith in our world and in this country.\"\n\nThe present environmental and economic challenges, and those of human development and global poverty, \"can only be faced with extraordinary Christ-liberated courage.\"\n\nSetting out a vision for the Church, he said: \"The Church transforms society when it takes the risks of renewal in prayer, of reconciliation and of confident declaration of the good news of Jesus Christ.\"\n\nOn taking office, Archbishop Justin announced three personal priorities for his ministry.\n\nThe first is a renewal of prayer and Religious life throughout the church.\n\nThe second is seeking reconciliation within the church, and supporting the Church in its role as a peacemaker.\n\nThe third is encouraging every Christian to share their faith and see themselves as a witness to Jesus Christ.\n\nThese priorities are central to everything the Archbishop does.\n\nDuring his first 18 months in office, Archbishop Justin visited every province of the Anglican Communion – joined by his wife, Caroline – an extraordinary personal pilgrimage that involved 96 days of travel.\n\nHe continues to make visits around the Anglican Communion, particularly to encourage Anglicans in places of conflict who are pursuing peace and reconciliation.\n\nIn 2017, Archbishop Justin was invited to join UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ High-Level Advisory Board on Mediation – the only faith leader to be on the panel.\n\nSince 2013, Archbishop Justin has made regular visits to dioceses around the southern province of the Church of England. He has taken part in everything from baptisms to baking competitions, visited schools and food banks, and prayed with people in skate parks, shopping centres and hundreds of churches."
