We live on the Cooley Peninsula in county Louth. There are roughly 20,000 people who live on this peninsula and not a single evangelical church. We are working both as church-planters on the peninsula, alongside an established church in a town about 30 minutes away. Michael is also a part of a radio program called \"Heart of the Matter\" on local public radio where he and two members of the church get to share the gospel over the radio every Monday."
