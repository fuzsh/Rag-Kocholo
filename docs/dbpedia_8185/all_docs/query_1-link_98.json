        "text": "We believe in:\n\nThe only true God, the almighty Creator of all things, existing eternally in three persons Father, Son, and Holy Spirit full of love and glory.\n\nThe unique divine inspiration, entire trustworthiness and authority of the Bible.\n\nThe value and dignity of all people: created in God’s image to live in love and holiness, but alienated from God and each other because of our sin and guilt, and justly subject to God’s wrath.\n\nJesus Christ, fully human and fully divine, who lived as a perfect example, who assumed the judgment due sinners by dying in our place, and who was bodily raised from the dead and ascended as Savior and Lord.\n\nJustification by God’s grace to all who repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone for salvation.\n\nThe indwelling presence and transforming power of the Holy Spirit, who gives to all believers a new life and a new calling to obedient service.\n\nThe unity of all believers in Jesus Christ, manifest in worshiping and witnessing churches making disciples throughout the world.\n\nThe victorious reign and future personal return of Jesus Christ, who will judge all people with justice and mercy, giving over the unrepentant to eternal condemnation but receiving the redeemed into eternal life.\n\nTo God be glory forever.\n\nAdapted from InterVarsity Christian Fellowship"
