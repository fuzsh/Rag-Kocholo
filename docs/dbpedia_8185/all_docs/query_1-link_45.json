World Wide Village extends assistance to all people, regardless of their religious beliefs, gender, race, or ethnic background.\n\nWhat We Believe\n\nWe believe all Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.\n\nWe believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n\nWe believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory.\n\nWe believe that for the salvation of lost and sinful man, regeneration of the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential.\n\nWe believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life.\n\nWe believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved unto the resurrection of life and they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation.\n\nWe believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nWorld Wide Village, Inc. is a registered 501c(3) nonprofit organization:\n\n3495 Northdale Blvd. NW, Suite 230\n\nCoon Rapids, MN 55448\n\nPhone: (651) 777-6908\n\n2412 Irwin St., Suite 206\n\nMelbourne, FL 32901\n\ninfo@worldwidevillage.org\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\n*All donations made to World Wide Village will be used at the organization’s discretion for any purpose consistent with its tax-exempt mission."
