        "text": "The educational experience for University of the Ozarks seniors Arely Saucedo Castaeda and Judith Olguin took them more than 5,000 miles away from their hometown of Clarksville this summer.\n\nSaucedo and Olguin spent a part of their summer in Verona, Italy, taking a class on Italian food and culture and touring the country as part of a study abroad program through the University Studies Abroad Consortium (USAC). The class was held on the Verona campus of Salesian University Institute of Venice.\n\nFor Saucedo, a political science major, it was her first time traveling abroad.\n\n“My first experience traveling internationally was exciting but also a bit overwhelming,” she said. “I felt a mix of excitement and curiosity as I stepped into a new country. Getting accustomed to the language, culture, and people was different, and learning how to navigate public transportation was unfamiliar, but it was all part of the adventure. I made sure to immerse myself in the local culture of Verona, trying new foods and exploring the historical sites.”\n\nThe summer session class lasted from July 1 to Aug. 3.\n\n“We learned about the food culture in Verona, Italy, as well as the differences between the cuisine in the U.S. and Italy,” Saucedo said. “We also participated in class field trips to Venice. In my food and culture class, our professor took us to a coffee brewery where they sell specialty coffee. We learned all about what makes specialty coffee and why it is called specialty. The second field trip was to the local food market, where all the fruits, vegetables, fish, and wine are locally sourced from the Veneto Region.”\n\nOlguin, a health science major, said having time to explore the area on her own was one of the highlights of the experience.\n\n“I got to attend the opera, I took a visit to Padua and visited a few Basilicas, and I visited the Giusti Garden,” Olguin said. “This experience abroad impacted me significantly as a person because I gained a global perspective and gained new independence. It also made me want to travel even more.”\n\nOlguin, who was visiting Europe for the first time, said one moment in Verona was especially memorable.\n\n“I’ll never forget going out to eat with my new friends that I made during the program to a rooftop restaurant that overlooked Verona, and finishing the night by exploring Verona and eating gelato,” she said.\n\nSaucedo said her most memorable moment was attending an opera performance of Carmen.\n\n“Experiencing an opera in an ancient arena was incredibly exciting and unique,” she said. “The atmosphere, the powerful music, and the grand setting all combined to create an unforgettable experience. It was a remarkable blend of history and art, and it deeply enhanced my appreciation for opera.”\n\nSaucedo said being immersed in Verona’s culture and learning to navigate a new environment independently boosted her self-confidence.\n\n“The friendships I made with fellow students from across the world enriched my experience and taught me the value of building connections across cultures,” Saucedo said. “Academically, the food and culture class deepened my knowledge of culinary traditions and their cultural significance. The field trips we took provided hands-on learning that made the course material more enriching. This experience has given me a global perspective that I can apply to my future studies and career, enhancing my understanding of how different cultures influence food practices.”\n\nSaucedo added that the trip “changed how I view the world and travel in general.”\n\n“Experiencing Verona’s rich heritage and traditions firsthand expanded my understanding and appreciation of global diversity. I became more open to exploring new places and embracing unfamiliar environments, seeing them as opportunities for growth. It made me value international friendships and the different perspectives they bring. I am now more eager to explore new destinations, immerse myself in different cultures, and learn from the world around me.”\n\nOlguin also said the trip changed how she viewed the world. “It made me realize that travel itself is a privilege and I was fortunate enough to have U of O give me a glimpse of life abroad.”\n\nBoth students received the University’s Student Enrichment Fund to help fund the experience.\n\n“The financial support helped cover essential expenses, which allowed me to participate fully in the study abroad program,” Saucedo said. “This fund made it possible for me to enroll in the food and culture class and take part in the enriching field trips to local businesses. The Student Enrichment Fund significantly enhanced my trip and allowed me to fully immerse myself in the culture and opportunities offered. I am deeply grateful for the support which enabled me to focus on learning and exploration.”"
