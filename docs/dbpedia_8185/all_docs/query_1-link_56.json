        "text": "A Remarkable Journey for Rosie and Anand Thandu\n\nAnand and Rosie Thandu, founders of the Children of Faith, were members of the Walnut Creek Presbyterian Church in 2002 when they felt called to help a few poor children in India get a good education. Educated and working in the US at the time, they found themselves moving back to India to provide a stable home in 2007 for those children.\n\nWith support from many friends in India and the US, the program has grown from just five children at the beginning, to providing shelter, nourishment, healthcare, education, and clothing to 120 children ages 6-21.\n\nA Growing Home\n\nToday the campus includes two three-story buildings, providing housing for the children and staff and a separate building for meals. A new kitchen is planned, as well as a new school to be built in partnership with the Home. Older children are pursuing their education in engineering, nursing, teaching, accounting, hotel management, and more. Some graduates are now operating their own businesses, or have good jobs across India and overseas."
