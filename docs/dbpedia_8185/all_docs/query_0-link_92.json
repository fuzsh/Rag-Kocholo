        "text": "Less is More\n\nIs More Truly More?\n\nOur lives are packed to the brim with so many things we want to pursue. In a society that is madly driven by consumerism and marketing, we are easily lured into believing that the more we have, the happier we are. Because of the tempting advertisements all around us, we wrongly desire to have it all. Sometimes we extend this thinking even to our work for God. We want to serve God, but at the same time, we don’t want to miss out on anything else that crosses our path. And so we desperately try to harmonize our desire to serve God with the endless pursuit of more and more things. This leads to a whirlwind of activities. In a restless hurry, we fool ourselves into believing that we can follow God without letting go of everything else that vies for our attention. When we apply this false thinking to our walk with God, we are deceived.\n\nBeing Willing to Let Go\n\nWe cannot have it all—we cannot embrace both the world and its luring pleasures and the blessings of God. To think so is a fatal mistake. This mentality of consumerism infects our thinking and inflicts disastrous effects on our spiritual lives. We cannot have God on top of everything else, like icing on the cake, without purposefully making room for Him in the crowdedness of our hectic lives. We first must be willing to live with less to experience the blessings of things that matter more. We must let go of the things that distract us from God’s presence and deplete our physical, mental, and spiritual energies. When we try to juggle jam-packed schedules at ever-increasing speeds as our to-do lists grow longer and longer, we quickly find ourselves exhausted physically and deeply depleted spiritually.\n\nLive With Less\n\nIs the clutter in your life holding you back from fully living for God? Crowded lives leave little room for the Creator of the universe. We must understand that less is more. We cannot experience more spiritual blessings, more prayer time, more of anything in our spiritual life if we only try to add it to an already full plate. Such overcrowding only leads to more emptiness. Instead, we must make an intentional decision to live purposefully with less so that we can enjoy more of what matters to God. Less is more!\n\nLet’s pray together.\n\nPrayer Time (30–45 Minutes)\n\nAll prayer groups have different ways of praying together. We encourage you to spend the next 30-45 minutes in united prayer, in whatever way the Holy Spirit leads. We encourage short conversational prayers (1-3 sentences). This allows for more people to pray multiple times. Below are some examples of praying through Scripture based on the theme. You may pray through other passages also and include other subjects in your prayer time. See the Leader’s Guide and World Church Prayer Requests for prayer ideas.\n\nPraying God’s Word — Eph. 5:15, 16\n\n“Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil.”\n\n“Look Carefully Then How You Walk, Not as Unwise but as Wise”\n\nGod, in our brokenness, we seek Your grace and provisions. We have filled our lives with too many activities and distractions. We need a reformation, a cleansing, a re-prioritization of the things that truly matter. Teach us what it means to live with less so we can focus on what matters most. We desire to be wise with wisdom from above. Guide us, we pray. Amen.\n\n“Making the Best Use of the Time”\n\nPrecious Jesus, You always have perfect timing, and You know what needs to be said and done at each time in history. Thank You for Your perfect ministry to this world. Please teach us how we can make the best use of our time for You, especially in the context of the last days. Reveal to us where we waste our time and give us victory over the things we know are taking up too much space in our lives. Amen.\n\n“Because the Days Are Evil”\n\nGod, we understand that the world is coming to an end very soon. The signs are all around us. Yet, at times we get so distracted by our busyness, or deceptions, that we forget that we are on the edge of eternity. Lead us into a total commitment to You and the ministry You have for us individually. Recalibrate our lives to be in tune with Your will. Amen.\n\nMore Prayer Suggestions\n\nThanks and Praise: Give thanks for specific blessings and praise God for His goodness.\n\nConfession: Take a few minutes for private confession and thank God for His forgiveness.\n\nGuidance: Ask God to grant wisdom for current challenges and decisions.\n\nOur Church: Pray for regional and world church needs (see separate sheet with requests).\n\nLocal Requests: Pray for current needs of church members, family, and neighbors.\n\nListen and Respond: Take time to listen for God’s voice and respond in praise or song.\n\nSong Suggestions\n\nSDA Hymnal: Fill My Cup, Lord (#493); We Would See Jesus (#494); Take Time to Be Holy (#500)\n\nOther Songs: Change My Heart, O God; Seek Ye First; Into My Heart\n\nPublished by the General Conference Ministerial Association\n\nDaily Readings by Dr. Frank Hasel\n\nLeader’s Guide: Back to the Altar\n\nHas God’s voice been calling you to revival? The Bible is full of promises for you:\n\n“If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land” (2 Chronicles 7:14).\n\n“And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart” (Jeremiah 29:13).\n\n“And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (Joel 2:32).\n\n“Draw near to God and He will draw near to you” (James 4:8).\n\n“Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me” (Revelation 3:20).\n\nWherever you are in life right now, God is closer than you think. He wants to pour out His blessings on your family, your church, your community, and your world.\n\nGeneral Items for Ten Days of Prayer\n\nDaily Prayer Guides\n\nWe have provided a prayer guide for each of the ten days. Each guide includes a Bible passage, devotional reading, Bible texts to pray through, prayer suggestions, and song suggestions. We recommend that you copy the daily guides so each participant can have one to follow during the prayer time.\n\nChurches around the world will unite in praying about each day’s topic. Join them in praying through the verses and prayer requests, but don’t feel that you must rush through the entire list of prayer suggestions. You may want to divide into small groups and have each group pray for a portion of your prayer requests.\n\nWe also included a document called World Church Prayer Requests. It’s important to pray together for our world church family, but you may want to spend extra time praying for local needs if your group includes visitors from the community. Pray about how you can best welcome guests and make them feel a part of your group.\n\nSuggested Times for Each Prayer Session\n\nKeep your prayer time simple so the group can focus on actually praying. How much time you spend on each section will vary. The following guide is just a suggestion:\n\nWelcome and introduction: 2 – 5 minutes\n\nRead devotional (in daily prayer guide): 5 minutes\n\nPray through the verses in “Praying God’s Word” (in daily prayer guide): 10 – 15 minutes\n\nPray about the items in “More Prayer Suggestions” (in daily prayer guide): 20 – 30 minutes\n\nRespond in song and praise: 5 – 10 minutes\n\nPray for Others\n\nEncourage each person to pray consistently for five to seven people that God has placed in their life. They can be relatives, friends, coworkers, neighbors, or simply acquaintances. Encourage them to ask the Holy Spirit for guidance in choosing these names and in reaching out to these people during the ten days. You may want to provide some cards or pieces of paper on which people can record the names they will be praying for.\n\nSabbath Services During Ten Days of Prayer\n\nHave a special prayer focus and share testimonies of answered prayer during the church services on both Sabbaths. Be creative—there are many ways to share with the church family what is happening during the daily prayer meetings.\n\nFinal Sabbath Celebration\n\nThe final Sabbath should be designed as a time of great rejoicing in all that God has done throughout the ten days. Include ample time for testimonies of answered prayer, biblical teaching/preaching on prayer, and singing. Lead the congregation in a time of prayer so that those who have not attended the daily meetings can experience the joy of praying with others. Please see the Sabbath Celebration handout for more ideas.\n\nFollow-up to Ten Days of Prayer\n\nPray about how God wants your church/group to continue what He has begun during Ten Days of Prayer. Perhaps you will continue with a weekly prayer session. Or perhaps God wants you to begin a new ministry in your church or an outreach to the community. Be open and follow where God leads. You’re sure to be amazed as you walk with Him. The document called Outreach Challenge is filled with ideas for service.\n\nTestimonies\n\nPlease share stories of how God has worked through Ten Days of Prayer! Your stories will be an encouragement to many others. Testimonies may be submitted online at www.tendaysofprayer.org.\n\nUnited Prayer Pointers\n\nAgree Together\n\nWhen someone prays a request to God, be sure some others pray for that same request and agree together—this is powerful! Don’t think that because one person has prayed about the request, no one else needs to. “Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven” (Matthew 18:19). How encouraging it is to be lifted up in prayer!\n\nClaiming God’s Promises\n\nEncourage the group to claim God’s promises as they pray. It is so easy to focus on our problems. But when we claim God’s promises, we increase our faith and remind ourselves that nothing is impossible with God. The promises help us take our eyes off our weaknesses and difficulties and set them on Jesus. For every weakness and every struggle, we can find Bible promises to claim. Encourage people to search for more promises and write them down so they can claim them in the future.\n\nFasting\n\nInvite those joining you in Ten Days of Prayer to consider some type of fasting, such as fasting from TV, secular music, movies, the Internet, sweets, or other types of food that are hard to digest. Use the extra time to pray and study the Bible, asking God to help you and your congregation to abide more fully in Christ. By adopting a simple diet, we allow our minds to become more receptive to the voice of the Holy Spirit.\n\nHoly Spirit\n\nBe sure to ask the Holy Spirit to show you what to pray for in a person’s life or in a particular situation. The Bible tells us that we do not know what to pray for and that the Holy Spirit is the one making intercession for us.\n\n“We must not only pray in Christ’s name, but by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. This explains what is meant when it is said that the Spirit ‘maketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.’ (Romans 8:26). Such prayer God delights to answer. When with earnestness and intensity we breathe a prayer in the name of Christ, there is in that very intensity a pledge from God that He is about to answer our prayer ‘exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think’ (Ephesians 3:20)” (Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 147, emphasis supplied).\n\nJournaling\n\nKeeping a prayer journal during the Ten Days of Prayer can help participants to internalize the daily prayer theme, make concrete commitments to God, and recognize His blessings. Writing out our prayers and keeping a record of God’s answers is a proven path to encouragement.\n\nIf you wish, you might provide time during the prayer meeting for people to journal their responses to God in private prayer journals. Or you could keep a group journal of prayer requests and answers—either in a notebook, on a large poster, or online. It is exciting and faith-building to look back and see how God has answered prayers!\n\nReverence\n\nEncourage and model a reverent attitude. We are approaching the throne room of the King of the universe. Let’s not treat this prayer time carelessly in our posture or mannerisms. However, it is not necessary that everyone kneel continuously. You want people to be comfortable for an hour, so encourage everyone to kneel or sit or stand as God leads and as they are comfortable.\n\nSentence Prayers\n\nPrayers should be short and to the point. This gives others an opportunity to pray as well. Try to limit your prayers to a few sentences. Each person can pray multiple times. Short sentence prayers keep the prayer time interesting and allow the Holy Spirit to impress the group how to pray. You don’t need to open and close each short sentence prayer with phrases such as “Dear God” and “Amen.” It is an ongoing conversation with God.\n\nSilence\n\nAs a leader, don’t dominate the prayer time. The goal is to get others praying. Times of silence are wonderful, as they give God time to speak to our hearts. Allow the Holy Spirit to work and give everyone time to pray.\n\nSinging\n\nSpontaneous group songs, mingled between prayers, add beauty to the prayer meeting. Suggested songs are listed at the end of each theme sheet. Do not feel that you need to use all the songs—these are simply suggestions. Singing is also a good way to transition from one prayer section to another.\n\nTaking Prayer Requests\n\nDon’t ask for prayer requests from the group. Instead, tell people to pray their requests and encourage others to join in agreement and prayer for those requests. Here’s why: time! Talking about the requests will take up most of your prayer time. Satan is thrilled if he can keep us talking about the problem instead of praying about the problem. Group members will often begin counseling and suggesting solutions. The power is from God! The more we pray, the more His power is unleashed.\n\nYour Daily Time\n\nThis is so important! Make sure that you as a leader are spending time daily at the feet of Jesus, talking with Him and reading His Word. If you will make knowing God a first priority in your life, it will open such a beautiful experience to you. “From the secret place of prayer came the power that shook the world in the Great Reformation. There, with holy calmness, the servants of the Lord set their feet upon the rock of His promises” (The Great Controversy, p. 210). When a leader prays, God works on hearts!\n\nBible Promises to Claim in Prayer\n\nAll Scriptures taken from NKJV\n\nPromises for the Holy Spirit\n\n“Ask the Lord for rain in the time of the latter rain. The Lord will make flashing clouds; He will give them showers of rain, grass in the field for everyone.” Zech. 10:1\n\n“If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!” Luke 11:13\n\n“But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you. . . . And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.” John 14:26; 16:8\n\n“Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father. And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.” John 14:12-14\n\n“So he answered and said to me: This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’ says the Lord of hosts.” Zech. 4:6\n\nPromises that God Answers Prayers\n\n“If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.” John 15:7\n\n“Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.” Heb. 4:16\n\n“Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.” Mark 11:24\n\n“Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me.” Ps. 50:15\n\n“Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven.” Matt. 18:19\n\n“And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.” Matt. 21:22\n\n“And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.” John 14:13, 14\n\n“And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you. Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.” John 16:23, 24\n\n“Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we asked of Him.” 1 John 5:14, 15\n\nPromises About God’s Power\n\n“Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.” Gen. 18:14\n\n“The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.” Ex. 14:14\n\n“But Jesus looked at them and said, ‘With men it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible.’” Mark 10:27\n\n“He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it.” 1 Thess. 5:24\n\n“I know that You can do everything, and that no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You.” Job 42:2\n\n“What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?” Rom. 8:31, 32\n\n“God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?” Num. 23:19\n\n“Have you not known? Have you not heard? The everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, neither faints nor is weary. His understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the weak, and to those who have no might He increases strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall, but those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.” Isa. 40:28-31\n\nPromises for God’s Guidance\n\n“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.” Josh. 1:9\n\n“ Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have spoken to you.” Gen. 28:15\n\n“Behold, I send an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.” Ex. 23:20\n\n“But from there you will seek the Lord your God, and you will find Him if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Deut. 4:29\n\n“Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.” Jer. 33:3\n\n“Every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill brought low; the crooked places shall be made straight and the rough places smooth; the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” Isa. 40:4, 5\n\n“I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will guide you with My eye.” Ps. 32:8\n\n“And the Lord, He is the One who goes before you. He will be with you, He will not leave you nor forsake you; do not fear nor be dismayed.” Deut. 31:8\n\n“Who is the man that fears the Lord? Him shall He teach in the way He chooses.” Ps. 25:12\n\n“Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.” Prov. 3:5, 6\n\n“If you extend your soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul, then your light shall dawn in the darkness, and your darkness shall be as the noonday. The Lord will guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in drought, and strengthen your bones; you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.” Isa. 58:10, 11\n\n“It shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear.” Isa. 65:24\n\nPromises for a Changed Heart\n\n“Then I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the Lord; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God, for they shall return to Me with their whole heart.” Jer. 24:7\n\n“And the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, to love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.” Deut. 30:6\n\n“ I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.” Ezek. 36:26\n\n“Being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.” Phil. 1:6\n\n“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.” 2 Cor. 5:17\n\n“I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.” Gal. 2:20\n\n“Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it.” 1 Thess. 5:23, 24\n\nPromises for Forgiveness\n\n“If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.” 2 Chr. 7:14\n\n“For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, and abundant in mercy to all those who call upon You.” Ps. 86:5\n\n“And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.” Mark 11:25\n\n“And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you.” Eph. 4:32\n\n“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” 1 John 1:9\n\n“Come now, and let us reason together, says the Lord, though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.” Isa. 1:18\n\n“I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and I will not remember your sins.” Isa. 43:25\n\n“For I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.” Jer. 31:34\n\n“In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace.” Eph. 1:7\n\nPromises for Victory Over Sin\n\n“ For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith.” 1 John 5:4\n\n“ Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.” Rom. 8:37\n\n“But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” 1 Cor. 15:57\n\n“Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.” Isa. 41:10\n\n“Above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.” Eph. 6:16\n\n“I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.” Gal. 2:20\n\n“For it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.” Phil. 2:13\n\n“I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.” Gal. 5:16\n\n“And the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.” Rom. 16:20\n\n“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.” Rom. 12:2\n\n“Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.” 1 John 2:15\n\nPromises for Healing\n\n“If you diligently heed the voice of the Lord your God and do what is right in His sight, give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have brought on the Egyptians. For I am the Lord who heals you.” Ex. 15:26\n\n“Your sandals shall be iron and bronze; as your days, so shall your strength be.” Deut. 33:25\n\n“Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits: who forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from destruction, who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies, who satisfies your mouth with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.” Ps. 103:2-5\n\n“Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord and depart from evil. It will be health to your flesh and strength to your bones.” Prov. 3:7, 8\n\n“He is despised and rejected by men, a Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. And we hid, as it were, our faces from Him; He was despised, and we did not esteem Him. Surely He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed Him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed.” Isa. 53:3-5\n\n“Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for You are my praise.” Jer. 17:14\n\n“‘For I will restore health to you and heal you of your wounds,’ says the Lord, ‘because they called you an outcast saying: This is Zion; no one seeks her.’” Jer. 30:17\n\n“Behold, I will bring it health and healing; I will heal them and reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth.” Jer. 33:6\n\n“But to you who fear My name the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings; and you shall go out and grow fat like stall-fed calves.” Mal. 4:2\n\n“Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.” James 5:14, 15\n\nPromises for Strength to Do God’s Will\n\n“Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.” 2 Cor. 4:16-18\n\n“And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart.” Gal. 6:9\n\n“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” Phil. 4:13\n\n“For it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.” Phil. 2:13\n\n“And He said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.’ Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.” 2 Cor. 12:9\n\nPromises About Being God’s Witnesses\n\n“Do not fear, nor be afraid; have I not told you from that time, and declared it? You are My witnesses. Is there a God besides Me? Indeed there is no other Rock; I know not one.” Isa. 44:8\n\n“Arise, shine; for your light has come! And the glory of the Lord is risen upon you.” Isa. 60:1\n\n“Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation.” 2 Cor. 5:18\n\n“But the Lord said to me: Do not say, ‘I am a youth,’ for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.” Jer. 1:7\n\n“But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” Acts 1:8\n\n“But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.” 1 Peter 2:9\n\n“But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear.” 1 Peter 3:15"
