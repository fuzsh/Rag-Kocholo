        "text": "Dr. André Roebert has been in ministry since 1991; André married Jenny in March 1992 and together they served first as Youth Pastors, and later on became District Pastors to assist the Senior Pastors at Good News Church in King Williams Town (Eastern Cape, South Africa).\n\nIn 1996 God started to birth a deep desire for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in both André and Jenny and they started Revival South Africa, an itinerant ministry that travelled from town to town throughout South Africa, out of which The River Church and Ministry was birthed in 1998 in East London. Just two years later God led them into the first of many business ventures and a 55 000 square meter (670 000 square foot) building was purchased that would become the headquarters of the River Group today.\n\nDr. André and Jenny are the Founders and Presidents of the River Group, comprising many different companies and ministries. With the group's three satellite channels, terrestrial broadcasts, multiple building investments, a satellite radio channel, multiple associated ministries, a humanitarian aid division in full operation, and The River Hotels Group, they are able to touch millions of people with the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nAs part of the group, and key to spreading the gospel is Faith Broadcasting Network, comprising of multiple channels - satellite, terrestrial and digital - broadcasting the message of hope across the world. Drs. André and Jenny, together with many other people that share a heart for reaching the lost preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ both effectively and efficiently across the nations of the world. The entire continent of Africa, the UK and North America is reached through FaithAfrica and FaithUK via satellite; in addition, digital terrestrial transmissions reach parts of Africa (GoTV) and FaithUSA is broadcast in North America. The digital platform FaithNOW, offers digital streaming of all three channels, some radio stations and podcasts, as well as a wide variety of VOD options; since this platform is available on all the major digital stores for download the reach is global. Through these broadcasts, a partnership following of hundreds of thousands around the world, as well as several web broadcasts are now literally taking the gospel to the ends of the earth 24/7.\n\nIt is truly a story of grace and God's love for His children that drives both Dr's André & Jenny to continue to do all that He has lead them to do, as they remain humble to fulfil His purpose of seen the lost come to Him until that great day of His return.\n\nPastor Jenny Roebert, alongside her husband Dr. André Roebert, is devoted to see the Gospel of Jesus Christ reach every nation and creed, across the globe, through the medium of Christian television. Together, they minister to countless people over the airwaves on Faith Broadcasting Network, that covers the continent of Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.\n\nWhen in East London, South Africa, Jenny ministers with her husband, who heads up the River Group, teaching the Word of God, through the power of the Holy Spirit at their home church The River, of which they are the visionary pastors. Having been significantly touched and changed by the power of the Holy Spirit herself, Jenny is passionate in her call to be used by God to share the truth and reality of the power of God with others. She is passionate about the Word and fully believes that it has the power to change every human life, without exception, that willingly receives its truth into their hearts. She is an anointed writer, preacher, teacher, prayer warrior, and mentor called to encourage the body of Christ. With a sincere heart for people and desire to see the person of Jesus made real to them, Jenny doesn't take the calling and assignment she has been given lightly and considers it a Divine privilege.\n\nRon had the privilege of growing up in a Christian home and by the age of 7 gave his life to Jesus Christ. He was Holy Spirit filled, and water baptized by the age of 8. His parents, Bert and Linda went into full time ministry while he was still a teenager, and it was actually in one of their church services where he knew he would go into full-time ministry one day.\n\nRon matriculated in 1989. He studied Electrical Engineering (light current) at the University of Technology Cape Town. After completing his degree he worked in the medical field installing, training & repairing HIV, pregnancy and decease-testing equipment all over South Africa. During this time he also completed 2 years of Bible School, which eventually propelled him to get his Masters of Christian Education in 2013.\n\nIn March 1998, Ron got married to Natasha whom he met through Bible school. 2 years later they answered the call of God to join the River Group in East London, South Africa, incorporating River Ministries and Faith Broadcasting Network as pastors. They served as pastors with many different responsibilities, including the developing of an evening Bible school and later the three year full-time degreed Bible School.\n\nRon’s passion to equip people has led him to become director of education.\n\nRon and Natasha have three boys, Reuel, Ronan and the youngest Raphael. He is a family man and loves playing squash with his boys. Reuel has represented South Africa in squash and the other two boys their province at some point.\n\nGreg is a born and bred East Londoner and was schooled throughout his school years at Selborne Primary and then Selborne College. In 1981 he commenced his university experience and read for a Bachelor of Commerce Degree at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa. He completed a post graduate Higher Diploma in Accountancy and finally qualified as a Chartered Accountant after passing the Public Accountants and Auditors’ Board examination in 1986.\n\nGreg completed three years articles with Deloitte Touche in Sandton Johannesburg, served in the military for an 18 month period and then commenced a career as a practicing accountant and tax practitioner for 13 years in a family business named after his father called, Graham Clur and Associates.\n\nIn February 2003, Greg answered the call of God to come to Christian ministry and he joined the River Group in East London, South Africa, incorporating River Ministries and Faith Broadcasting Network as the chief financial officer of the group.\n\nGreg has developed a passion for teaching students, especially in areas relating to potential, leadership and the process of bringing young visions to reality and fulfillment. He also teaches extensively on business principles and the effective stewardship of Christian ministry.\n\nGreg is married to Juanita (then Roebert) and has two married children. A daughter Jade, who is married to Chad Spencer and reside in Elmira, New York State, United States of America and Niall, who is married to Tayla and are currently the young adults’ pastors of River Ministries."
