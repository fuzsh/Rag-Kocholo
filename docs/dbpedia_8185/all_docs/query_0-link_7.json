        "text": "Why the home?\n\nHome is both a place and feeling. It is where we eat, where we sleep, where we find ourselves at the start and end of our day. Home is where we can feel the strongest sense of belonging, where we can feel connected to ‘our people’, where we can feel part of ‘our tribe’. It can also be a place of doubt, questions, loneliness and fear. While talking about being the vine, Jesus invites us to be at home in him, as he is at home in us (John 15:1-4 MSG). We are invited to imagine that we are sharing our everyday lives with each other and with God, intertwined by love as a community of growing faith."
