We are passionate about what is important to God.\n\nJesus calls those who follow Him to love God wholeheartedly and love their neighbors as themselves. Our desire is to demonstrate to the world the extravagant love of God in the person of Jesus Christ.\n\nWe have been entrusted with a lifesaving and transforming message that we must share with others. Our witness is bold, compelling, and fearless. Our mission advances when individuals become disciples of Jesus Christ and join God’s mission to make more disciples."
