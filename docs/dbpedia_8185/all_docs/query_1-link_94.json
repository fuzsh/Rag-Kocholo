        "text": "Preamble\n\nWe believe that all matters of faith and conduct must be evaluated on the basis of Holy Scripture, which is our inspired, infallible, and inerrant guide. (2 Timothy 3:16-17) Because Holy Scripture speaks to creation and human life, it is imperative that we correctly understand, articulate, and abide by what Holy Scripture teaches on this matter.\n\nWe believe that God has created mankind in His image (Imago Dei) and that human life begins at fertilization. God, in His infinite sovereignty, uniquely formed human beings and gave them a special dignity, personal freedom, and individual accountability among all the works of creation. Human beings have been made for relationship with God and to be good and faithful stewards of creation. God created each person's inmost being, knitting each person together in his mother's womb. (Psalm 139:13) As God's individualized and personal creation, each person is fearfully and wonderfully made. (Psalm 139:14) God has ordained all the days of each person's life before he came to be. (Psalm 139:16)\n\nReligious Beliefs\n\nBased on Holy Scripture, we believe:\n\nFrom the moment of fertilization until natural death, every human life is sacred because every human life as been created by God, in His image and likeness. From the moment of fertilization, every human life must be recognized, respected, and protected as having the rights of a person and the inviolable right to life. The right to life and physical integrity of every unborn human life is inviolable — it is not a concession made by society or the state, but is instead inherent to the unborn human life by virtue of its creation in the image of God. Because human life begins at the moment of fertilization, it is against our religious and moral conviction to formally or materially cooperate in the termination of unborn human life. We are strongly committed to the preservation and defense of unborn human life, which compels our religious, moral, and ethical duty to defend unborn human life from destruction, whether by surgical abortion or use of drugs, devices, or services that have the intent, design, effect, or risk of terminating unborn human life or preventing its implantation and growth post-fertilization. The Church and all her ministers and ministries should publicly witness to society and to the state regarding the intrinsic, inherent, and inviolable dignity of all human life, from fertilization to natural death.\n\nHoly Scripture\n\nIn standing against abortion, this organization incorporates by reference the following Holy Scriptures, which are cited in the statements, resolutions, commentaries, or doctrines of Christian denominations that are expressly and vocally opposed to abortion: Lutheran Church — Missouri Synod, Presbyterian Church in America, Roman Catholic Church, and Southern Baptist Convention.\n\nGenesis 1:26-27\n\nGenesis 25:21-22\n\nExodus 20:13\n\nPsalm 22:9-10\n\nPsalm 139:13-16\n\nIsaiah 44:1-2\n\nIsaiah 49:5\n\nJob 10:8-12\n\nJeremiah 1:4-5\n\nLuke 1:39-45\n\nEarly Church Fathers' Statements on Sanctity of Human Life\n\n\"Thus, you read the word of God, spoken to Jeremiah: 'Before I formed thee in the womb, I new thee.' If God forms us in the womb, He also breathes on us as He did in the beginning: 'And God formed man and breathed into him the breath of life.' Nor could God have known man in the womb unless he were a whole man. 'And before thou camest forth from the womb, I sanctified thee.' Was it, then, a dead body at that stage? Surely it was not, for \"God is the God of the living and not the dead.\" - Tertullian, De Anima\n\n\"It is not permissible for us to destroy the seed by means of illicit manslaughter once it has been conceived in the womb, so long as blood remains in the person.\" - Tertullian, Apologia\n\n\"Why sow where the ground makes it its care to destroy the fruit? Where there are many efforts at abortion? Where there is murder before the birth … Why then dost thou abuse the gift of God, and fight with His laws, and follow after what is a curse as if a blessing, and make the chamber of procreation a chamber for murder, and arm the woman that was given for childbearing unto slaughter?\" - John Chrysostom, Homily 24\n\n\"This lustful cruelty, or if you please, cruel lust, resorts to such extravagant methods as to use poisonous drugs to secure barrenness; or else, if unsuccessful in this, to destroy the conceived seed by some means previous to birth, preferring that its offspring should rather perish than receive vitality; or if it was advancing to life within the womb, should be slain before it was born.\" - Augustine, De Nube et Concupiscentia\n\n\"Therefore brothers, you see how perverse they are and hastening wickedness, who are immature, they seek abortion of the conception before the birth; they are those who tell us, 'I do not see that which you say must be believed.'\" - Augustine, Sermon 126\n\n\"Thou shalt not slay the child by procuring abortion; nor, again, shalt thou destroy it after it is born.\" - Barnabas, Letter\n\nWe believe that all matters of faith and conduct must be evaluated on the basis of Holy Scripture, which is our infallible guide. (2 Timothy 3:16-17) Since the Holy Bible does speak to the nature of human beings and their sexuality, it is imperative that we correctly understand and articulate what the Bible teaches on these matters.\n\nWe are committed to the home and family as set forth in Holy Scripture. We believe God has ordained and created marriage to exist between one man and one woman, with absolute marital fidelity. The Bible sets forth specific home and family values, which include the distinct roles of husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, and children. It is our firm conviction that we uphold the dignity of each individual as we embrace the unchanging and longstanding principles of scriptural truth.\n\nReligious Beliefs\n\nBased on Holy Scripture, we believe:\n\nMarriage — World Ministry Fellowship defines marriage as the permanent, exclusive, comprehensive, and conjugal \"one flesh\" union of one man and one woman, intrinsically ordered to procreation and biological family, and in furtherance of the moral, spiritual, and public good of binding father, mother, and child. (Genesis 1:27-28, Genesis 2:18-24, Matthew 19:4-9, Mark 10:5-9, Ephesians 5:31-33)\n\nSexual Immorality — World Ministry Fellowship believes that sexual acts outside marriage are prohibited as sinful. Consequently, World Ministry Fellowship members must resist and refrain from any and all sexual acts outside marriage — including, but not limited to adultery, fornication, incest, zoophilia, pornography, prostitution, masturbation, voyeurism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, sodomy, polygamy, polyamory, solo-gamy, or same-sex sexual acts. (Exodus 20:14, Leviticus 18:7-23, Leviticus 20:10-21, Deuteronomy 5:18, 1 Thessalonians 4:3, Hebrews 13:4, Galatians 5:19, Ephesians 4:17-19, Colossians 3:5)\n\nGender Identity — World Ministry Fellowship believes that God created mankind in His image: male (man) and female (woman), sexually different but with equal personal dignity. Consequently, World Ministry Fellowship members must affirm their biological sex and refrain from any and all attempts to physically change, alter, or disagree with their predominant biological sex — including but not limited to elective sex-reassignment, transvestite, transgender, or binary \"genderqueer\" acts or conduct. (Genesis 1:26-28, Romans 1:26-32, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11)\n\nSexual Orientation — World Ministry Fellowship believes that God created and ordered human sexuality to the permanent, exclusive, comprehensive, and conjugal \"one flesh\" union of man and woman, intrinsically ordered to procreation and biological family, and in the furtherance of the moral, spiritual, and public good of binding father, mother, and child. Consequently, World Ministry Fellowship members must affirm the sexual complementarity of man and woman and resist any and all same-sex sexual attractions and refrain from any and all same-sex sexual acts or conduct, which are intrinsically disordered. (Genesis 1;27, Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4-6, Mark 10:5-9, Romans 1:26-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, Ephesians 5:25-27, Revelation 19:7-9, Revelation 21:2)\n\nSexual Redemption — World Ministry Fellowship believes that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and should seek redemption through confession, repentance, baptism, and faith in Jesus Christ. Consequently, World Ministry Fellowship members must welcome and treat with respect, compassion, and sensitivity all who experience same-sex attractions or confess sexually immoral acts but are committed to resisting sexual temptation, refraining from sexual immorality, and conforming their behavior to World Ministry Fellowship's Statement of Faith. (Matthew 11:28-30, Romans 3:23, Ephesians 2:1-10, 1 Corinthians 10:13, Hebrews 2:17-18, Hebrews 4:14-16)\n\nCelibacy — World Ministry Fellowship believes that Holy Scripture grants two life-enhancing options for human sexual behavior: (1) the conjugal \"one flesh\" marital union of one man and one woman, and (2) celibacy. Either is a gift from God, given as He wills for His glory and the good of those who receive and rejoice in His gift to them. Celibacy and faithful singleness is to be celebrated and affirmed within World Ministry Fellowship. (Genesis 1:27-28; 2:18, 21-24; Matthew 19:4-6; Mark 10:5-8; Hebrews 13:4; 1 Corinthians 7:1-8; Matthew 19:12; 1 Corinthians 12:12-13; Romans 12:10; 1 Timothy 5:1-2)\n\nHoly Scripture:\n\nMarriage and Human Sexuality\n\nGenesis 1:26-28\n\nGenesis 2:18-24\n\nGenesis 19:5-10\n\nExodus 20:14\n\nLeviticus 18:7-23\n\nLeviticus 10:10-21\n\nDeuteronomy 5:18\n\nJudges 19;22-24\n\nMatthew 5:27-28\n\nMatthew 15:19\n\nMatthew 19:4-9\n\nMark 10:5-9\n\nRomans 1:26-27\n\n1 Corinthians 6:9-13\n\n1 Corinthians 5:11\n\nGalatians 5:19\n\nEphesians 4:17-19\n\nEphesians 5:25-27\n\nEphesians 5:31\n\nColossians 3:5\n\n1 Thessalonians 4:3\n\nHebrews 13:4\n\n1 Timothy 1:8-10\n\nJude 1:7\n\nRevelation 19:7-9\n\nRevelation 21:2\n\nPastoral Care\n\nMatthew 11:28-30\n\nRomans 3:23\n\nEphesians 2:1-10\n\n1 Corinthians 10:13\n\nHebrews 2:17-18\n\nHebrews 4:14-16\n\nApplication\n\nAll of our members, employees, and volunteers must affirm and adhere to this Doctrinal and Religious Absolute statement on marriage and human sexuality to qualify for involvement with the ministry. This is necessary to accomplish our religious mission, goals and purpose. Behavior or counter-witnessing that does otherwise will impede and burden our integrity and religious mission. We believe that God's grace can wipe the slate of guilt and sin, though the consequences are still incurred.\n\nAuthority\n\nThe Bible is the inspired and infallible Word of God, acting as the source of authority over morality, our beliefs, Christian lifestyle and conduct. World Ministry Fellowship's Executive Board is charged with the ministerial responsibility of Biblical interpretation and promulgating religious policy. The Executive Board will determine life application as well as final matters relating to church theology, philosophy, Christian practice, faith, divine truth, morality, and theological and doctrinal resolutions."
