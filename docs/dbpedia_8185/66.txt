Life-shaping academics

Some days your classroom might be an internship in downtown Boston or the Biotech Corridor, a research project in the Great Marsh in nearby Essex, art-making in an ancient convent in the Italian countryside or working with a human rights organization in Zagreb, Croatia.

At New England's top Christian college, we know confidence and skills are built through challenge, so a lot of learning happens by doing.

Life-changing experiences

Join Fighting Scots Nation as an athlete or superfan. Belly laugh your way through student improv performances. Trek through the Adirondack wilderness on a La Vida expedition.

Charter a club for something you love. Enjoy concerts and theatre performances on campus. Rally on the quad for a snowball fight or Gull Pond for a beach campfire. And through it all, build lasting friendships.

Life-giving faith

Join fellow Christians from diverse backgrounds who all want to deepen their relationship with Jesus, learn from one another and prepare to be a powerful witness for Christ in the world.

Just imagine what you can learn when youâ€™re surrounded by a wide variety of Christian traditions in worship, prayer, discipleship and service.
