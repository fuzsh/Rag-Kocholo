        "text": "Chandler is a double-double threat anytime he steps on the floor and one of the team's primary rim protectors. His impact goes beyond the box score, as he sets the tone for the entire defense and alters plenty of shots he doesnâ€™t actually block.\n\nChandler helped the Dallas Mavericks win an NBA title in 2011 as a defensive anchor down low, and the hope in Phoenix when it signed him this offseason was he would do the same and lead the Suns to the postseason. Thus far, he is averaging 5.9 points, 8.5 rebounds and 0.6 blocks per game."
