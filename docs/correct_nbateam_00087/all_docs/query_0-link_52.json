        "text": "I think of myself as a major league NBA fan—not so much qualitatively as quantitatively, mind you. Specifically, I'm a diehard fan of the Detroit Pistons, and not just during seasons such as this one, when the Pistons are among the league's best teams. I pulled for the Pistons, enthusiastically, even in the days of Kelly Tripucka and Marvin \"Bad News\" Barnes.\n\nStill and all, I have to come clean, fan-wise. I've been extremely late to the party this year, when one team has quietly, craftily become the class of an already pretty classy collection of teams. (Even the normally loathsome Celtics and Lakers have, I must admit, commanded respect this year.) That would be a team many or most casual fans probably haven't ever seen play: the New Orleans Hornets. Formerly the dreary Charlotte Hornets, and briefly the forgettable Oklahoma City Hornets—after Hurricane Katrina damaged the team's arena—the New Orleans Hornets are far and away the most likable, impressive team, and perhaps even best team in this year's playoffs, which is now in its second of four rounds.As I write this, the Hornets are in the third quarter of their third game against the defending NBA champions, the favored San Antonio Spurs. Surprisingly, the Hornets won the first two games, in raucous New Orleans, and are hanging close in this game. They're magnificent. They're scrappy. They look good in yellow. That's because the Hornets' stars are like younger, faster versions of the Spurs'. Whereas the latter are quarterbacked by Tony Parker, the speedy Frenchman married to Eva Longoria, the former are led by the dazzling youngster Chris Paul, who plays like the second coming of Isiah Thomas. Paul is simply the most gifted point-guard the league has seen in years. He has no weaknesses. He shoots. He passes. He defends.\n\nBetter yet, he leads three of the NBA's other most unheralded young prodigies, among them David West, Julian Wright, and Tyson Chandler. Wright, a classic \"slasher,\" stays step-for-step with the Spurs's aging Argentinean spitfire, Manu Ginobli; West, a smooth, softspoken power forward out of Xavier University, quietly made his first All-Star team this season. Like Paul—who finished a close second (to Kobe Bryant) in this year's Most Valuable Player voting—he will make many more All-Star teams. Meantime, the combination of West and Chandler out-Duncans even Tim Duncan, arguably the best center in basketball. West evinces Duncan's shooting and ballhandling skills, while Chandler, the ultimate team-oriented center, rebounds, defends, and blocks shots like Duncan did years ago.\n\nWith some guilt and a little pride, I'd like to add a few words about Chandler, whom I first met nearly ten years ago, when he was a shy, skinny high school star in the exurban desert-scape outside Los Angeles. He starred for Dominguez High School, a perennial basketball power. When I interviewed Chandler for Vanity Fair, he was among the most coveted potential college recruits in the country, so much so that he ultimately skipped college altogether, entering the 2001 NBA Draft, in which the Chicago Bulls selected him second overall. When I knew him, Chandler was scrappy, deferential, team-oriented. Early in his career, though, Chandler occasionally bickered with teammates and struggled with a gimpy back. But by the time he got to New Orleans, in 2006, he was becoming the perfect complement to the Hornet's gifted rookie, Chris Paul. And here's where, in addition to congratulations, I offer Tyson Chandler my hearty apologies. Because the 1998-99 NBA season was delayed by a player lockout, the season was delayed until that February, delaying and ultimately killing my profile of the young phenom. At some point, while still in high school, Chandler understandably called to check on the story's status. I hemmed and hawed. Because I was a coward.\n\nSorry, Tyson. It wasn't you; it was us. It was a friendly profile, too, predicting nothing but success for you.\n\nNow will you sign my sneakers?"
