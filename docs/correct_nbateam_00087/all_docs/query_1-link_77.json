        "text": "Tyson Chandler plugs Phoenix Suns puzzle's holes\n\nTyson Chandler comes into Phoenix with his 7-foot-3 wingspan spread wide, ready to wipe out so many of the stains of the Suns' last season.\n\nBeyond being a much-needed instant and undisputed leader, Chandler is a basketball fit for the jagged holes of the Suns' on-court puzzle last season.\n\nThe Suns had the fifth-worst rebounding percentage team in the NBA. Enter the No. 5 rebounder in the league last season, when he posted the best rebounding percentage of his 14-year career.\n\nThe Suns wanted to improve their rim protection, post defense, pick-and-roll coverage and defensive communication. It is the defensive role Chandler was born to play.\n\nMORE: Suns land shooting forward Mirza Teletovic\n\nThe Suns were a good pick-and-roll team because of their guards but have not had a consistent rolling big man threat since Amar'e Stoudemire left in 2010. This is a slam dunk, which is also Chandler's most common shot to make him one of the most efficient finishers in the NBA â€¦ ever.\n\n\"The more we started thinking about it going into free agency, he really checked pretty much every box we were looking for,\" Suns general manager Ryan McDonough said.\n\nThe Suns met with Chandler to start free agency and Chandler said he left the meeting knowing where he wanted to be and how a quick commitment would help the Suns pursue other free agents. Even with Chandler, the Suns finished second in the LaMarcus Aldridge chase but they still have a new former All-Star big man who can make them better.\n\nBOIVIN: Tyson Chandler will help Suns personality makeover\n\nFor four years and $52 million, Chandler will be the starting center on a Suns team with a 2015-16 outlook that became clearer Thursday when they agreed to a one-year, $5.5 million contract for spread power forward Mirza Teletovic (MEER-za Te-LE-to-vic). Teletovic, 29, continues the theme of added 3-point shooting and has an edge on Jon Leuer to back up Markieff Morris. The 6-foot-9, 242-pound Bosnian was a 39 percent 3-point shooter for Brooklyn in 2013-14 but blood clots in his lungs affected his conditioning and ended his season in January.\n\nChandler's reputation as the 2011-12 NBA Defensive Player of the Year and an elite rebounder are at the forefront, but his threat to dive off screens should do wonders to open perimeter shooters like Teletovic.\n\nChandler finished 84 alley-oops last season and took 87 percent of his shots around the rim. His average shot length last season was 2.9 feet. That affinity for dunks, layups and tip-ins has given him a 59.1 career field-goal percentage, second only to Artis Gilmore (59.9) in NBA history.\n\n\"Hopefully, we have those guys make shots this year and opposing teams are going to have to figure out what to do against him,\" Suns coach Jeff Hornacek said. \"Tyson's a big part of the offense, as well as our guards, Markieff and our shooters from corners and wings.\"\n\nAfter six previous NBA teams, Chandler knows how to adjust to guards and guide them. He now gets a chance to do so in a lineup with two point guards, Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight.\n\nPROFILE: Tyson Chandler\n\n\"We'll both make each other's lives a lot easier,\" Chandler said. \"They have two explosive guards that I know firsthand from trying to control, playing against them. Now, I think of Brandon and Eric turning the corner with good pace and also having a threat at the rim, it's going to make their lives earlier, as well as guys will get a lot of open shots.\"\n\nDefensively, Chandler's ability to read a game defensively has Hornacek encouraging him to suggest coverages in games, just as he said his Utah teams did to Jerry Sloan.\n\n\"Tyson will be the director back there,\" Hornacek said. \"He'll tell our guys what defense we're in, what the rotation is.\"\n\nChandler will start in front of Len but all involved insist they are happy to share the playing time at center. On rare occasion, they could share the floor in games. It is more important to Chandler that they share a bond because he said he wants to help the 22-year-old Len reach his potential.\n\nRELATED: Alex Len eager to work with Tyson Chandler\n\n\"Those two guys are going to have such a great relationship that it (playing time) doesn't matter,\" Hornacek said. \"I know Tyson. He's going to say, 'Look, we're the centers on this time. It doesn't matter what you get, what I get. As a team, what are we doing at the center spot? Let's just dominate.'\"\n\nChandler will be 33 by the time next season starts and 36 by the time his new contract ends. There is a good chance he will need more of Len but not apparently anytime soon. Chandler logged the third most minutes of his career last season.\n\n\"This has always been an organization that is known for its training staff so that was exciting for me to be able to come in and work with these guys,\" Chandler said. \"I felt like I could even take myself to another level.\""
