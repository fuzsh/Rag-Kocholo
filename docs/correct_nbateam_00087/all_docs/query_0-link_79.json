        "text": "Since entering the NBA in 2002, the New Orleans Pelicans have undergone a few location and name changes. First, the franchise was the New Orleans Hornets. However, the tragic events of Hurricane Katrina forced the Hornets to play two years in Oklahoma City, where they were called the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets.\n\nThe franchise finally became the Pelicans in 2013 and hasn't looked back since. Overall as a franchise, the New Orleans group has a regular-season record of 671-771. They've made the playoffs seven times but have never played in the NBA Finals.\n\nChris Paul and Anthony Davis are the two Hall of Famers who have played for this franchise. Unfortunately, both superstars requested trades out of town. Paul was traded by the Hornets to the Los Angeles Clippers in December of 2011 while the Pelicans traded Davis to the Los Angeles Lakers last summer.\n\nBoth Davis and Paul only won one playoff series with the franchise. Paul's 2007-08 New Orleans Hornets team won a franchise-record 56 games. They were a top-10 offense and defense. The Hornets averaged 100.9 points per game and gave up only 95.6.\n\nPaul and David West were the best players on this team. CP3 averaged 21.1 points and 11.6 assists and West put up 20.6 points and 8.9 boards. The Hornets also had Tyson Chandler, Peja Stojakovic and Bonzi Wells. The team was coached by Byron Scott.\n\nThe Hornets were the No. 2 seed in the 2008 playoffs. Only Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers (57-25) had a better record than New Orleans. The Hornets matched up against the Dallas Mavericks in the first round. The Mavs, of course, were led by superstar Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nDirk averaged 26.8 points in the series, but the Hornets won in five games. Paul put up averages of 24.6 points and 12.0 assists while West averaged 22.6 points and 7.4 rebounds. The Mavs simply had no answers for Paul and West in the pick-and-roll/pop game.\n\nNext up for the Hornets was Tim Duncan and the San Antonio Spurs. Paul and Duncan are very good friends off the court, so this was going to be a fun series for the two All-Stars.\n\nPaul and the Hornets destroyed the Spurs in Game 1 at home to begin the series. West had 30 points and Chandler was a monster on the boards, grabbing a game-high 15.\n\nGame 2 was more of the same for New Orleans. Paul had 30 points and the Hornets won 102-84. At the time, it appeared New Orleans was going to sweep San Antonio and cruise to the Western Conference Finals.\n\nHowever, the Spurs punched the Hornets right back in the mouth in Games 3 and 4. The Spurs won both of their home games in convincing fashion as well. The series was now tied at 2-2. All the Hornets had to do was take care of business at home and they would win the series.\n\nJust like in Games 1 and 2, the Hornets waxed the Spurs in the Big Easy in Game 5. New Orleans took a 3-2 lead after winning by a final score of 101-79. West was unbelievable. He had 38 points and was making the game look so easy.\n\nThe Hornets were now one win away from reaching the Western Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history. New Orleans wanted to finish the series in Game 6 on the road in San Antonio but the team could sleep easy at night knowing that they did have Game 7 at home if it got to that.\n\nThe Spurs weren't messing around in Game 6 and won easily. It was now time for a Game 7 back in New Orleans and the Hornets were favored since they had won Games 1, 2 and 5 with ease.\n\nThe Spurs, though, were the more experienced team. They defeated the Hornets in Game 7 to shock New Orleans. Paul's magical season was over and it was the final time he'd get to the second round with the franchise. Losing Game 7 was a tough pill for fans to swallow.\n\nFast forward to today and the Pelicans are one of the best young squads in the league. No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson was a beast for the team before the 2019-20 season was suspended due to COVID-19.\n\nWith Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Jrue Holiday and JJ Redick leading the Pelicans moving forward for the next few years, the post-Davis era should see some New Orleans teams go on playoff runs.\n\nThe 2019-20 Pelicans were fighting for that 8th seed prior to play getting suspended. The Pelicans believe they would be in the top four or five position out West if Zion had played from the start of the season.\n\nPelicans fans are praying that Zion doesn't eventually leave the franchise like Paul and Davis."
