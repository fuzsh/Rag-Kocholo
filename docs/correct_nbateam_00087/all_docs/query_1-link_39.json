        "text": "After receiving a buyout in Phoenix on Saturday, Suns center Tyson Chandler will sign with the Los Angeles Lakers once he clears waivers, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski and the New York Times’ Mark Stein.\n\nChandler is in the final year of his four-year deal with Phoenix, and was set to make nearly $13.6 million.\n\nChandler averaged 6.5 points and 9.1 rebounds last season, averaging 25 minutes of playing time in just 46 games. The 36-year-old is averaging just 3.7 points and 12.7 minutes per game so far this season, and has taken the backseat to rookie center Deandre Ayton — who is averaging more than 16 points and 11 rebounds through eight games this year.\n\nWhile JaVale McGee will still start and get the bulk of the minutes down low, Chandler can provide some much-needed depth for the Lakers at that position. The Lakers had been using rookie Johnathan Williams as McGee’s backup, however Williams is on a two-way contract and can only spend 45 days in the NBA.\n\nChandler, an NBA veteran who is in his 18th season in the league, will also likely help LeBron James lead the way in the young Lakers locker room."
