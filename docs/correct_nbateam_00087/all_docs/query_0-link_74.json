        "text": "If a show of hands was requested from those who had the New Orleans Hornets as the last remaining undefeated team in the NBA, all it would do is reveal who the fibbers are.\n\nNobody had this, not even Tyson Chandler, who has good friends there from when he was a Hornet from 2006 to 2009.\n\nLike everybody else, the Mavericks' center is surprised and impressed that New Orleans comes to American Airlines Center at 8-0 tonight. He also figures it's up to him and his new teammates to introduce the visitors to their first loss of the season.\n\n\"Trust me, it's definitely on my mind and I made it known in the locker room that it would be huge for us,\" Chandler said. \"They're the only undefeated team in the league and everybody's got to lose at some point, and it would be good for them to get that loss here.\"\n\nThe Mavericks will have two cracks to do it since they visit New Orleans on Wednesday. It's one of those rare scheduling quirks that teams don't like because it's hard to beat a team two games in a row. The Mavericks found that out against Denver during a home-and-home pair a couple of weeks ago.\n\nChandler said it seems like yesterday that he was catching lob passes from Chris Paul and putting the Mavericks out of the playoffs in the 2008 postseason, a series that cost then-coach Avery Johnson his job.\n\nSince then, the Mavericks have remained a great regular-season team with no playoff success. And the Hornets have gone from a prime up-and-coming team to slumping into the lottery last season.\n\nThat was not unexpected, by the way.\n\n\"It was going to happen,\" Chandler said. \"It was a financial situation. We had our opportunity to win that one year and if we didn't go all the way, we had it in the back of our head that they would break things up. I kind of knew I was going to be the one to go because teams were inquiring and my contract made sense.\n\n\"Now, they're actually deeper than when I played there. They have some athletic wings and that's what they lacked when I was there.\"\n\nThe Hornets have stayed undefeated mostly because of their defense. Rookie coach Monty Williams has them working hard on that end and they allow fewer than 90 points per game, with a point differential of plus-nine per game.\n\n\"It's no fluke,\" coach Rick Carlisle said. \"This is two games in a row against the top team in the league, not only in terms of their record, but their [point] differential is massive, almost as good as the Lakers.\n\n\"They're playing as well as their record. They're hard to score on and they're hard to stop.\"\n\nBut, Chandler says, the respect factor only goes so far.\n\n\"I keep in contact with those guys. We were a close-knit team. I wish them luck, but not Monday or the next game.\"\n\nButler may make return: Caron Butler has missed the last two games with back spasms, but said Friday he was feeling much improved.\n\nCarlisle said that it's still not certain if the starting small forward will play tonight.\n\n\"I don't know yet,\" Carlisle said. \"He did some things [at practice], but he didn't do everything. We got to see where he's at in the morning.\"\n\nIf Butler cannot go, Shawn Marion would get his third consecutive start.\n\nBest things in life are free: Chandler was a career 61 percent free throw shooter coming into this year, but is rolling along at 86.2 percent so far this season. He said it's the result of him not wanting to be an easy choice for a foul when he gets the ball in close to the basket.\n\n\"I get upset because [it's not like] I'm not getting 15 shots a game,\" he said. \"My opportunities, I got to make the best of them. When I miss three free throws and end up with seven points, I get upset because that was a double-double I left out there. If we lose by two and I miss three or four free throws, that bothers me.\""
