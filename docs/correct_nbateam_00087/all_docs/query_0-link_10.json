        "text": "On July 14th, 2006, the Chicago Bulls traded center Tyson Chandler to the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets for forward-center P.J. Brown and guard J.R. Smith.\n\nThe future of the Chicago Bulls seemed extremely bright when the team acquired rookie big men Eddy Curry and Tyson Chandler in the 2001 NBA Draft. Chandler would be the defensive yang to Curry’s offensive yin and lead the new era in Chicago labeled the Baby Bulls.\n\nUnfortunately with two high-schoolers in Chandler and Curry, this process would take some time. In Chandler’s first season, he showed very raw skills as a quality big man on defense. He averaged 6.1 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 0.8 APG and 1.3 BPG in 71 games (31 starts) with the Bulls. Chicago went 21-61 that season which was Chicago’s third straight 60-loss season. The season was doomed from the start when the Bulls started off 1-12. The team made a major midseason move when they dealt Ron Artest, Brad Miller, Ron Mercer and Kevin Ollie to the Indiana Pacers for Jalen Rose, Travis Best and Norm Richardson.\n\nChandler and the Bulls both took baby steps of improvement during the 2002-03 season. The team drafted guard Jason Williams in the 2002 NBA Draft and acquired forward Donyell Marshall in free agency. Chandler averaged 9.2 PPG, 6.9 RPG, 1.0 APG and 1.4 BPG in 75 games (68 starts). The Bulls went 30-52 under coach Bill Cartwright.\n\nThe 2003-04 season would be a step back for Chicago. The team lost Williams, who’s career ended due to a motorcycle accident and drafted point guard Kirk Hinrich from Kansas. The Bulls got off to another poor start. They were 4-10 when they fired Cartwright and replaced him with Scott Skiles. Despite high expectations the Bulls faltered and decided to make some changes. They traded Rose and Marshall in a six-player deal with Toronto that brought Antonio Davis to Chicago. Overall, the Bulls finished 23-59 that season. This was the sixth straight season that Chicago would miss the playoffs.\n\nChandler missed significant time with a lower back injury and struggled throughout the season. Chandler tantalized his own team in his first four games of the season. He averaged 15.5 PPG, 15.5 RPG and 2.3 BPG in that short span but his injury derailed any progress. He only played in 35 games and averaged 6.1 PPG, 7.7 RPG, 0.7 APG and 1.2 BPG in 22.3 MPG.\n\nThe 2004-05 season would be a season of change for the Bulls. They acquired rookies Ben Gordon and Luol Deng in the 2004 NBA Draft and also signed-and-traded guard Jamal Crawford to the Knicks. Despite an 0-9 start, Chicago would go on to win 47 of the next 73 games to go 47-35. Chandler was the anchor off the bench of the Bulls’s second-ranked defense (100.2 points per 100 possessions). He averaged 8.0 PPG, 9.7 RPG, 0.8 APG and 1.8 BPG in 80 games (10 starts).\n\nIn the playoffs, Chicago would face the Washington Wizards in the first round. The Bulls took the first two games at home, but the Wizards recovered to win the next four games and the series 4-2. The Bulss were missing Deng and Curry and that hurt them in the series.\n\nBuilding off of a successful season, the Bulls agreed to a new contract with Chandler at six years and $63 million. The Bulls also signed-and-traded Curry to the Knicks for Tim Thomas and a few spare parts. The Bulls finished 41-41 during the 2005-06 season. Chandler hadn’t shown the improvement the team expected in his fifth year in the NBA. He averaged 5.3 PPG, 9.0 RPG, 1.0 APG and 1.3 BPG in 79 games for the Bulls. The Bulls faced the Miami Heat in the 2006 NBA playoffs and lost in six games. The Bulls did put up a good fight and gave the Heat problems despite the series loss. Chadler, however, was a non-factor in the series. He played 17.8 MPG and racked up 4.8 FPG in the series and averaged just 1.8 PPG throughout the six games.\n\nAfter that season, the Bulls made a huge splash in free agency, signing All-Star center Ben Wallace to a four-year $60 million deal. That acquisition spelled the end of Chandler’s days in Chicago. Players like Deng, Gordon, Hinrich and Andres Nocioni would be up for new contracts. Chandler’s original deal just would not make sense for the Bulls financially with those future deals waiting in the wings.\n\nChandler appeared in 340 games with Chicago and made 167 starts, and averaged 7.1 PPG, 7.7 RPG, 1.4 BPG and 24.4 MPG. He shot 51% from the field and 61% from the free-throw line during his five seasons with the Bulls.\n\nP.J. Brown came to the Charlotte Hornets in 2000. He was involved in a nine-player deal with the Miami Heat that sent Eddie Jones and Anthony Mason to Miami. The revitalized Hornets entered the 2000-01 season with a brand new roster. They went 46-36 under coach Paul Silas. The Hornets were sixth in defense and seventh in rebounding which could be attributed to their rugged cast of interior players. Brown played in 80 games and started 79 at power forward. He brought toughness, defense, and rebounding to a loaded Hornets frontline that featured Elden Campbell, Otis Thorpe and Derrick Coleman. Brown averaged 8.5 PPG, 9.3 RPG, 1.6 APG, 1.0 SPG and 1.2 BPG in 35.1 MPG with Charlotte.\n\nBrown would get revenge on his old team the Miami Heat in the first round. The Hornets zoomed past Miami 3-0 and won the three games by a total of 67 points. Charlotte would go on to face the Milwaukee Bucks in the Semifinals. The Bucks took the first two games at home, but Charlotte bounced back to win three straight games and take a 3-2 lead. Milwaukee would pull it together though, and win a big Games Six on the road. They would seal up their Eastern Conference Final bid with a 104-97 Game Seven victory against Charlotte.\n\nThe 2001-02 season would be the last season for the Hornets in Charlotte until 2014. The Hornets were 44-38 despite losing leading scorer Jamal Mashburn for 42 games due to a severe abdominal strain. Brown averaged 8.4 PPG, 9.8 RPG, 1.3 APG, 0.7 SPG and 1.0 BPG in 80 games with the Hornets.\n\nThe Hornets once again lost Mashburn, but this time for the entire playoffs. He was dealing with a virus, mild anemia and B-12 vitamin deficiency. Despite Mashburn playing in only 10 total minutes during the playoffs, Charlotte won its first round matchup with the Orlando Magic. Despite losing Game Two of the series at home, the Hornets managed to win Games Three and Four on the road and win the series 3-1.\n\nThe Hornets couldn’t get past the New Jersey Nets in the second round. The Nets were too much for a Hornets team lacking offensive weapons. The Nets won the series easily in five games.\n\nThe 2002-03 season would be a year of new beginnings for the Hornets who moved to New Orleans. The Hornets bounced back to win 47 games that season. Brown averaged 10.7 PPG, 9.0 RPG, 1.9 APG, 0.9 SPG and 1.0 BPG in 78 games. New Orleans faced off against Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the 2003 playoffs. The Sixers took the fight to the Hornets and won the series in six games.\n\nThe Hornets fired head coach Paul Silas after the first round exit and hired Tim Floyd to replace him. Brown re-signed with the Hornets for four years and $34 million in the 2003 offseason.\n\nDuring the 2003-04 season the Hornets got off to an encouraging 17-7 start and were primed to make a run in the East, injuries caught up with them. Jamal Mashburn’s career took a turn for the worst with chronic knee problems. He only played in 19 games. David Wesley missed 21 games and Baron Davis missed 15. The Hornets struggled and wound up with a 41-41 record that placed them as the fifth seed in the East. They would go on to face a young Miami Heat team led by a rookie Dwyane Wade and Lamar Odom. Each team won at home and Miami would close out the series in seven games. Floyd was fired and replaced by coach Byron Scott.\n\nJ.R. Smith was originally drafted by the Hornets out of high school in the first round of the 2004 NBA Draft. Smith showed promise in his rookie year as the Hornets’s core roster crumbled. Smith averaged 10.3 PPG, 2.0 RPG, 1.9 APG and 0.7 SPG in 76 games during his rookie season. Brown averaged 10.8 PPG, 9.0 RPG, 2.2 APG, 0.9 SPG and 0.6 BPG in 82 games with New Orleans. The Hornets started 1-19 in their move to the Western Conference after a Conference re-alignment took place. Point guard Baron Davis and center Jamaal Magloire went down with extended absence injuries. Davis would later be dealt to the Warriors midseason in a trade that signified a rebuilding era in New Orleans. The Hornets ended up with an 18-64 record during the ‘04-'05 season. It was their first year missing the playoffs since 1999.\n\nThe Hornets were able to reap the benefits from their bad record when they selected guard Chris Paul out of Wake Forest with the fourth pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. Paul was expected to form a great young backcourt duo with Smith for years to come. It would not work out as Smith fell out of favor with the New Orleans coaching staff due to his lack of effort on defense, bad shot selection, and poor work ethic. He was benched midseason and only played in 55 games due to coaching decision. He averaged 7.7 PPG, 2.0 RPG and 1.1 APG in 18.0 MPG. Smith’s status on the Hornets indicated that he was likely to be traded and that came true. Brown finished his last season with the Hornets averaging 9.0 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 1.2 APG, 0.6 SPG and 0.7 BPG in 75 games with New Orleans.\n\nThe Hornets finished 38-44 that season which was a strong improvement. They did miss the playoffs, but the future looked very bright with Chris Paul leading the charge for the team.\n\nBrown averaged 9.6 PPG, 8.8 RPG, 1.7 APG, 0.8 SPG and 0.9 BPG through 475 games with the Hornets. Brown shot 47% from the field and 85% from the free-throw line in his time with New Orleans. In his time with the Hornets franchise, Smith averaged 9.2 PPG, 2.0 RPG, 1.5 APG and 21.7 MPG in 131 games with the team. He shot 39% from the floor, 32% from three-point range, and 74% from the free-throw line during his tenure.\n\nSmith was in his rookie contract making $1.3 million in 2006-07 and had a team option for a fourth year at $2.1 million. Brown would be entering the final year of his four-year, $34 million deal and would be on the books for $8.56 million for the '06-'07 season.\n\nAfter the trade, Chandler went on to be a very productive big man in New Orleans. In his first season, Chandler had the best year of his career. He averaged 9.5 PPG, 12.4 RPG (second best in the NBA), 0.9 APG and 1.8 BPG in 73 games for the Hornets. His performance made it easy to initially question if the trade was the right decision for Chicago. His numbers easily bested those of Ben Wallace in his first season with the Bulls.\n\nThe Hornets finished an encouraging 39-43 in Chandler’s first season. Numerous injuries hurt the team. New Hornet Peja Stojakovic missed 69 games due to back surgery, David West missed 30 games due to right elbow surgery and Chris Paul missed 18 games due to a severely sprained right ankle. The fact that the Hornets could finish only four games over .500 had to be encouraging for the future of the team when players became healthy.\n\nJust eight months later Bulls vice president John Paxson found himself having to defend the trade and explaining why he traded Chandler (via Chicago Tribune):\n\n“We needed a contract that ended this year because we have [Andres] Nocioni coming up and the possibility of [extending Ben] Gordon and [Luol] Deng. Tyson’s contract would have put us in a difficult situation financially. Tyson here had trouble living up to things. Being traded for Elton [Brand], the tag that he was going to be the next Kevin Garnett, the contract, all those things. You see it in this league all the time. A lot of guys, it’s the second or third place they go where they blossom. I’m a fan of Tyson. I told him that the day we moved him. I’m happy for him. It’s part of the business. If people want to just look at numbers, so be it.”\n\nThat happened exactly in the 2007-08 season. The Hornets won 56 games which was second best in the West. The Hornets starters were healthy with none of the five starters missing more than six games. Chandler averaged 11.8 PPG, 11.7 RPG (third best in the NBA), 1.0 APG and 1.1 BPG in 79 games. Chandler also shot an astounding 62.3% from the field which was second best in the league that year.\n\nAs the second seed in the 2008 Western Conference first round, the Hornets faced the Dallas Mavericks. The Hornets managed to take four out of five games from the Mavericks in a series that featured only one out of the five games decided by single digits. The Hornets would battle with the defending 2007 NBA champion San Antonio Spurs in the Semifinals. The home team won every game until Game Seven when San Antonio managed to hold on 91-82 in the final Game Seven.\n\nBy the second year after the trade, Chandler was obviously a better player than Wallace. The numbers are startling in a comparison between the two players.\n\nThe deal became a major talking point for the Bulls who faltered to a disappointing 33-49 record during the 2007-08 season. The Bulls faced a serious case of buyer’s remorse during the '07-'08 season. They traded Wallace midway into the year in a three-team deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Seattle Supersonics that netted them Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes, Shannon Brown and Cedric Simmons.\n\nThe Hornets took a modest decline during the 2008-09 season. Chandler missing 37 games due to problems with his left ankle that lingered throughout the entire season into the playoffs. The Hornets were struggling financially as well and almost dealt Chandler to the Oklahoma City Thunder. The trade was completed, but the deal was rescinded when Chandler failed a physical due to a big left toe that was a cause of concern.\n\nChandler played just 45 games and averaged 8.8 PPG, 8.7 RPG and 1.2 BPG for the Hornets. The team won 49 games and did advance to the playoffs. The Hornets were smacked by the Nuggets in the first round. Denver won the series in five games. The Nuggets won their four games all by at least 15 points including a demoralizing 121-63 victory in Game Four of the series at New Orleans. Chandler was practically a non-factor in the series due to his injury. He played in four of the five games and averaged just 3.8 PPG and 5.3 RPG in the loss.\n\nThe Hornets would deal Chandler for a second time to the Charlotte Bobcats for Emeka Okafor. Chandler left the Hornets with averages of 10.2 PPG, 11.3 RPG, 0.9 APG and 1.4 BPG in 197 games with the Hornets. He shot 61% from the field and 57% from the free-throw line in his three seasons with the Hornets.\n\nDavid West would later explain how the Tyson Chandler deal really affected the way that he and Chris Paul would think about the franchise down the road. (via ESPN)\n\n“It’s nothing against Emeka, but from our perspective, being teammates with Tyson and knowing the type of impact he had on both of our careers at that particular time, I just felt like at that moment, things, in terms of the trust, the direction we were going, started to wane a bit. When you have a franchise guy like Chris, build a team around him, I’m under the impression that you’ve got to keep your franchise guy happy.”\n\nP.J. Brown provided a solid veteran presence for Chicago during the 2006-07 season. He averaged 6.1 PPG and 4.8 RPG in 72 regular season games. The Bulls went 49-33 that season behind the top defense in the NBA.\n\nThe Bulls faced the defending champion Miami Heat in the first round and absolutely smacked them 4-0 in a series that wasn’t remotely close. In the Semifinals, the Bulls were in a defensive slugfest with the Detroit Pistons. The Bulls lost the first three games of the series and went on to lose 4-2.\n\nBrown played well, averaging 8.3 PPG and 4.7 RPG during the postseason. The wily veteran was not re-signed and ended up signing a contract with the Boston Celtics late in the 2007-08 season. He would end up playing an integral role and winning a championship with Boston that season.\n\nSmith was on the Bulls roster for a grand total of six days before being re-routed to the Denver Nuggets for guard Howard Eisley and two 2007 second rounders (JamesOn Curry & Aaron Gray).\n\nFun Fact: J.R. Smith & Tyson Chandler became teammates with the New York Knicks and would play three seasons together.\n\nP.J. Brown on how he feels the Bulls brought him to contribute and not for his expiring contract (RealGM via Chicago Sun-Times):\n\n“I don’t think they’re bringing me there to just let my contract expire. I think they want me to definitely help get this team to the next level. With the acquisition of Ben, you see how committed they are toward winning.”\n\nTyson Chandler on the trade (via Chicago Tribune & Chicago Sun-Times):\n\n“As soon as they signed Ben Wallace, I totally expected it – It was just a matter of when and where. At first I was walking around a little sick. Even though I had heard the rumors, it was definitely a shock. I was definitely sad. After a couple of nights of thinking about it, I realized basketball-wise, it’s a good thing for me. It’s a great basketball opportunity to play with a bunch of young, up-and-coming guys. That’s the thing I’m excited about. They’re moving the team in a direction that fits me well. I can help a team make the playoffs. I’ll get a chance to play with a great, young point guard [Chris Paul].”\n\nOn Bulls organization:\n\n“I’m sad to leave a great organization. They gave me a great opportunity. Jerry Krause drafted me and John Paxson has been nothing but honest and loyal.”\n\nOn relationship with coach Scott Skiles in return to Chicago (via The Oklahoman):\n\n“The fans and the city have always been great to me even when I left, even the management. I had a problem with one person. It just happened to be my head coach. To me he’s not a good person, and that’s obvious in the way he treats his players and the comments that he makes. So I don’t even pay attention to him because he’s so little to me.”\n\nOn the lack of communication with Skiles (via Chicago Sun-Times):\n\n\"There never was an understanding there [by Skiles]. Never communication. … It was like there were walls put up there I couldn’t break through. That’s just the way it was.”\n\nOn how his last season in Chicago affected him (Basketball Forum via Chicago Sun-Times):\n\n“I needed a year like that to light a fire under me. I don’t know how to phrase it exactly; I just wished things happened differently.”\n\nOn how he felt he let down Jerry Krause and John Paxson:\n\n“For John Paxson and Jerry Krause. It was definitely tough. I wanted to do well for them.”\n\nOn how his last season depressed him:\n\n“I talked to my wife [Kimberly] and told her, 'I’ve never been depressed in my life.’ But last year, I was depressed because basketball is my world – it means everything to me. And when I’m not playing as great as I can, it really affects [me]. I took everything to heart – I took the criticism to heart; I took my own criticism to heart. Last year was the year I’ll never have again. I never want to go there again. It was unbelievable. I mean, I didn’t want to go outside.”\n\nOn whether he pointed the finger at himself:\n\n“I wish our communication level could have been better. But I always point the finger at myself first. Scott’s a great coach, as good as any when it comes to X’s and O’s. I’m never a person who will take shots at anybody unwarranted. I want to make it clear that in no way, shape or form am I pointing my finger at Scott for the way I played.”\n\nChicago Bulls executive vice president John Paxson on acquiring P.J. Brown (via Inside Hoops):\n\n“We really welcome the veteran leadership that P.J. will bring to our team. He brings a consistent game at both ends of the floor and we will be counting on his production in helping us improve as a team.”\n\nOn Tyson Chandler:\n\n“We also really appreciate all Tyson did for us during his five years here in Chicago. He was an integral part in our growth as an organization and it is always difficult to trade away a player who has been with our organization for a long time. We wish him and his family the best of luck.”\n\nNew Orleans Hornets general manager Jeff Bower on acquiring Tyson Chandler (via The Victoria Advocate):\n\n“We think that’s a big move for us, to bring in a player who’s still very young, entering the prime of his career, that has the exact qualities that we were looking to add to our team. He has length, ability to run the floor, shot-blocking presence and also a player that we think has untapped offensive potential. We think we’ll be able to take advantage of that as well as the offensive end.”\n\nHornets head coach Byron Scott on Chandler (via The Oklahoman):\n\n“People just kind of gave up on him. Even people in California that I know called me after we made the trade, they were like, ‘Yeah, he’s a good rebounder, but he’s just such an underachiever, and I was like, he’s 24 years old, and he’s really never been taught. I said if he has the will to work, then we’re going to work with him, and I really feel that this kid could be a double-double guy in this league.”\n\nOn his sour relationship with J.R. Smith (Hoops Hype via the Times-Picayune):\n\n“I think with J.R., I tried to use three or four different approaches. As far as talking to him about what he needs to work on, showing him statistics and having the coaches there to work with him on those things, now if he doesn’t show up, then we can’t work. But the one thing I never really did with J.R. was degrade him or jump on him to a point where I was trying to break his confidence. I never did that. I think his biggest problem was that he was overconfident; he never thought he could lose his job.”\n\nP.J. Brown’s agent Mark Bartlestein (via ESPN):\n\n“It’s my understanding that the trade is going to happen. P.J. is very excited. He feels like the Bulls have an opportunity to compete for a championship. He really enjoyed his time with the Hornets, but he has so many fond memories of his days in Miami and contending every year that Chicago is a really good situation for him to get back to.”\n\nOn Brown’s list of teams for a trade (Basketball Forum via Chicago Sun-Times):\n\n“We had given the Hornets a list of teams for a trade, and the Bulls were one of them, though we weren’t thinking at that time this was going to happen. P.J. has a great respect for the Bulls franchise. He’s very excited and plans to play another three or four years.”\n\nHornets guard and former teammate of Chandler in Chicago Jannero Pargo on Chandler’s time in Chicago (via The Oklahoman):\n\n“I can tell you just from looking in his face that it got to him a lot. He got taken out of the starting lineup. Some games he’d play 20 minutes, and he’d get yelled at for letting a guy catch the ball. So it was real frustrating for him.”\n\nJ.R. Smith’s father Earl on the trade (via the Times Picayune):\n\n“It would be a fine move that I think is great. It would give J.R. a chance to redeem himself, and I think he would fit in perfect with those guys. They have a chance to contend in the East.”"
