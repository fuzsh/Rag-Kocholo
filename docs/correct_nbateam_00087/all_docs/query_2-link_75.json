        "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY – Tyson Chandler’s first two months with the Suns did not look much like the picture he painted for himself, the team or Suns fans after he became the team’s major offseason acquisition.\n\nChandler's role reduced early with more small-ball lineups. He sat out for eight consecutive games due to a hamstring injury, reducing his ability to impact the team as a defender and leader as much as advertised.\n\nHis comeback was restricted to four-minute bursts until this week, when he has begun to look like a more familiar version of a defending, rebounding, dunking, chattering center.\n\n“I am starting to get livelier and livelier with every game,” Chander said. “I’ve got to do something to help this team turn it.”\n\nWhile center Alex Len has hit a five-game funk that includes three scoreless games and foul issues, Chandler reclaimed his starting center job Friday and has averaged 10.0 points and 9.5 rebounds per game over the past four games in only 23.5 minute per game.\n\nComing off the bench was an odd experience for the 15-year pro, who last had a part-time bench role six seasons ago when he was injured for Charlotte. What is more difficult and unusual for Chandler is to be on a 12-23 team that took a severe confidence hit during a seven-game losing streak.\n\n“It’s been since my early Chicago days that I’ve been around a group like this,” Chandler said. “But I knew what I was coming here for. You take your hits, your lumps. It’s no fun.\n\n“I didn’t expect this at all. You still have to find a way to grow and I’ve still got to do my job, what I was called here for. I’m going to try to teach these guys every day. I’m going to fight. I’m going to compete and try to figure out a way to turn this thing around.”\n\nChandler has seen how all the distractions have worn on his young teammates. Just in the past week, Markieff Morris’ drama continued with a two-game suspension, assistant coaches Jerry Sichting and Mike Longabardi were fired in a rare in-season move and Eric Bledsoe was lost to a season-ending knee injury.\n\n“Just too much,” Chandler said. “It’s too much. There’s a lot of stuff going on. We’ve got to do a better job of limiting distractions on the floor. For me, it doesn’t bother me. I’ve seen it all and been through it all. For a young player, different things can be a distraction, whether it’s injuries, lineup changes or everything else that’s out there. We have to do a better job of clearing it and concentrating on basketball.“\n\nChandler made 64.8 percent of his shots over the previous five season but was shooting 46.7 percent for the season until the past four games, when he has gone 15 of 22 with his pick-and-roll finishes and rebound follows.\n\nSuns injury pileup\n\nThe Suns have not just been beat down by recent events. They have been beat up too.\n\nIt was less than three weeks ago that the Suns’ injury report cleared. Point guard Eric Bledsoe had season-ending surgery Tuesday. Point guard Ronnie Price missed the past two games for a toe sprain. Power forward Jon Leuer missed Thursday’s game for an ankle sprain that he proved to be too weak Wednesday. Center Alex Len has been bothered by two left fingers that were hit Monday, affecting his ability to grip the ball.\n\nFree throws\n\n* Even with Leuer out, Hornacek said the Suns were deciding between starting either Mirza Teletovic or P.J. Tucker before settling on Tucker. Markieff Morris did not play in an eight-man rotation Friday. On Thursday, his twin, Pistons forward Marcus Morris, made more comments to the Detroit Free Press, saying, “He’s still looking to get out of there.”\n\n* Point guard Bryce Cotton signed with the Suns on Nov. 25 but did not play until Wednesday’s and Thursday’s games. His previous game action was a Nov. 21 D-League game for Austin. After getting 21 minutes in San Antonio, Cotton only played six stat-less minutes at Oklahoma City.\n\n“That’s tough on him,” Hornacek said. “He’ll probably feel more comfortable now that he’s played in a game… He plays hard. He pushes the ball up the court for us.”\n\n* In a Wednesday game that was filled with the Spurs being physical, the toughest Suns play might have come from the youngest player in the NBA when Devin Booker delivered a hard foul on LaMarcus Aldridge at the rim: “When San Antonio was roughing us up pretty good, he (Booker) was the only guy who would jump up there and take a hard foul. He’s beyond his years in his knowledge of the game. The game’s not really fast to him.”"
