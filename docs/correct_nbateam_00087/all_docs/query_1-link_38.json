        "text": "“The main thing is Tyson really wanted to be good and has wanted to do whatever it took to be good,” said Cartwright. “At that point in time, it was a lot for both those guys to take in. Just the basic concepts (of staying in front of your man). It wasn’t easy for them. I always felt Tyson would be really good, seven-feet tall, athletic and he really wanted to do whatever it took. But I knew you had to give them time. A lot of guys coming into the league had this notion, ‘I’m going to score 30 pts and get 20 rebounds.’ I did not feel Tyson felt that way. He knew he’d be a really good defender. He had to work on offensive game.\n\n“People don’t realize what those guys are coming into is overwhelming,” said Cartwright. “Cooking, your own apartment, and now playing against guys in the NBA. It takes time to find yourself. Eddy’s situation was a little tougher being from Chicago. But I always had great belief in those guys and still do. I remember when I was in New Jersey and the Bulls were trying to move Tyson. I told Rod (Thorn), ‘This guy is going to lead the league in shot blocks and rebounds.’ The unique thing about Tyson is he does what few players do, bring energy to the team and virtually guards everyone at the basket. He’s happy with who he is and thrives on it. To me, that’s a beautiful thing.\n\nThe Heat has been that good in this first-round series, especially at the defensive end, where they have reduced Carmelo Anthony to an ineffective 21 point-per-game scorer, shooting a dismal 34%. But a sweeping is still a sweeping. “It won’t sit well,’’ said Tyson Chandler, who won a ring 11 months ago in Dallas. “Whenever you get swept, it’s embarrassing.’’\n\nTyson Chandler has been voted the NBA’s Defensive Player of the Year for his impact on the New York Knicks, a person with knowledge of the award said Tuesday. The Knicks went from tied for 27th in the NBA in opponent points per game last season to 11th in their first season with Chandler at center. They trimmed 11 points off the 105.7 they yielded in 2010-11. Chandler’s victory was first reported by Yahoo Sports. The person told The Associated Press of the honor on condition of anonymity because the official announcement was to come from the NBA. The award will be announced Wednesday."
