        "text": "All-Star point guard Chris Paul could knife his way into the lane, lob the ball up in the air and, almost without fail, Tyson Chandler would be there to slam it down with two hands.\n\nIt was the signature move of New Orleans' thrilling young inside-outside tandem, with the two teaming up for more than 100 alley-oops last season during the Hornets' surprising run to the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference and a spot in the conference semifinals.\n\nNow, the Hornets will have to find a new crowd-pleasing calling card.\n\nChandler was dealt to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday in a trade that brings veterans Joe Smith and Chris Wilcox to the Hornets and could give New Orleans some cap room next season heading into the first year of Paul's new four-year, $68 million contract.\n\nNew Orleans also got the rights to DeVon Hardin, a second-round pick out of California in last year's draft who never signed with Oklahoma City.\n\n\"We were able to get great depth, leadership and experience by making this trade,\" Hornets general manager Jeff Bower said in a statement. \"We felt we needed to increase our overall play of the front line and Chris Wilcox is a young, athletic player that can score and fit well in our system. We will be able to take advantage of his athleticism and style of play.\n\n\"Joe provides us with much needed depth and someone who can be an integral part of our rotation.\"\n\nChandler's numbers had dropped off even before he missed the Hornets' last 12 games with a sprained left ankle. He's averaging 8.8 points and 8.3 rebounds this season, after going for 11.8 points and 11.8 rebounds per game last season.\n\nChandler played one season in Oklahoma City during the Hornets' temporary relocation after Hurricane Katrina.\n\nBARKLEY BACK: Charles Barkley will return from his leave of absence and be back on the air Thursday night during TNT's NBA coverage.\n\nBarkley was arrested Dec. 31 in Scottsdale, Ariz., and his leave began Jan. 9. Police said the 45-year-old NBA Hall of Famer had a blood-alcohol level nearly twice the legal limit in Arizona.\n\nBarkley, a TNT studio analyst, was forced to miss the network's coverage of All-Star weekend.\n\n\"From the beginning, Charles recognized that he used poor judgment. He took full responsibility and apologized for his actions,\" Turner Sports president David Levy said in a statement.\n\nCELTICS-KINGS TRADE: The Sacramento Kings have acquired veteran guard Sam Cassell from the Boston Celtics for a conditional second-round draft pick in 2015.\n\nThe 39-year-old Cassell hasn't played this season for the Celtics, who acquired him in early March before their run to the NBA title. He essentially served as another assistant coach this season with Boston, which also sent cash considerations to Sacramento in the trade.\n\nThe Kings didn't immediately announce whether Cassell would join the team or be released."
