The New Orleans Hornets decided to trade Tyson Chandler to clear some cap space and add depth to the frontcourt. They'll have to go back to the dra wing board.

The Hornets announced on Wednesday that the Oklahoma City Thunder did not medically clear the center and therefore rescinded the trade. Chandler would have gone to the Thunder for forwards Chris Wilcox and Joe Smith.

"We welcome Tyson back with open arms," Hornets general manager Jeff Bower said in a statement. "We went into this trade to garner more frontcourt depth to add to our team as we continue our push towards the playoffs. We expect Tyson and the rest of our big guys to step up to the challenge."
