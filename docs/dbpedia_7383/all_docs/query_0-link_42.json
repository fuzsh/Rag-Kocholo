        "text": "So, in my last article I examined the nature of being autistic through the lens of Sartre's Being and Nothingness. I know that using this lens may seem a little odd in our current social model of neurodiversity, but I wanted to look at what it is to be autistic from a philosophical viewpoint. This is not to diminish the research out there, although a lot of the older research papers denigrate at the same time as uplifting neurodivergence. I'm writing these articles rather selfishly, as an exploration of how I see my own neurodivergence, with the hope of helping others along the way.\n\nI thought it only fitting that I follow up on my last article by exploring Jean-Paul Sartre's early philosophical work, \"The Transcendence of the Ego,\" which offers another unique lens through which we can explore the concept of autism, especially in relation to self-awareness and identity. Sartre's ideas about consciousness and the self provide insightful parallels to the lived experiences of autistic individuals, particularly concerning the phenomena of othering and masking as I discussed in my previous post.\n\nThe Difference Between \"The Transcendence of the Ego\" and \"Being and Nothingness\"\n\nWhile both \"The Transcendence of the Ego\" and \"Being and Nothingness\" are seminal works by Jean-Paul Sartre that delve into his existentialist philosophy, they differ significantly in scope and focus. \"The Transcendence of the Ego,\" published in 1936, is a concise essay that challenges the traditional notion of the ego as an intrinsic part of consciousness. Sartre argues that the ego is not a fundamental component of consciousness but rather an external construct formed through reflective acts. This work sets the groundwork for his later, more comprehensive thesis, \"Being and Nothingness,\" published in 1943. In \"Being and Nothingness,\" Sartre expands his exploration to a full-fledged ontology, examining the nature of being, nothingness, and human freedom in exhaustive detail. He introduces key concepts such as bad faith, facticity, and the look, providing a deeper analysis of the human condition and the structures of consciousness. While \"The Transcendence of the Ego\" lays the theoretical foundation, \"Being and Nothingness\" offers a more detailed and systematic exploration of existentialist themes.\n\nThe Nature of Consciousness\n\nIn \"The Transcendence of the Ego,\" Sartre suggests that consciousness is inherently self-aware and does not require an \"ego\" or self to exist. This perspective suggests that the self is not a pre-existing entity within consciousness but is instead constructed through interactions and reflections. In simplistic terms, the way we interact with the world and others shape who we are. However, our environment is manifested through social constructs, like religion, politics, culture, and language. Access to these structures is dependent on our ability socially interact and communicate.\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), used to diagnose autism, outlines the one of the diagnostic criteria as persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction. The direct quote for this is:\n\nA. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text):\n\nDeficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.\n\nDeficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye contact and body language or deficits in understanding and use of gestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication.\n\nDeficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of interest in peers.\n\nAvoiding the glaring use of demeaning language, the impact of these 'deficits' are that autistic people will struggle to develop a sense of self aligned to social norms. We perceive the world as different, so our sense of self will be misaligned to neurotypical people.\n\nSo, for autistic individuals, this aligns with the experience of often feeling different or separate from neurotypical norms. The struggle to fit into societal expectations can lead to a heightened awareness of the self as a distinct and sometimes dissonant entity.\n\nOthering and the Autistic Experience\n\nSartre's notion that the ego is formed through external reflections resonates with the concept of othering in autism. Othering occurs when individuals are perceived as different and are marginalized based on those differences. Autistic people frequently experience othering, as societal norms often do not accommodate neurodiverse ways of being. This external pressure to conform can lead to a fragmented sense of self, as we navigate between our authentic self and the self that society expects.\n\nMasking and the Constructed Self\n\nMasking is a common strategy employed by autistic individuals to navigate social environments. It involves suppressing or camouflaging our autistic self to blend in with neurotypical peers. In Sartre's framework, this can be seen as a form of ego constructionâ€”where the self that is presented to the world is a reflection of societal expectations rather than the individual's true nature. This constructed self is a survival mechanism, a way to mitigate othering and gain social acceptance.\n\nAutonomy and Authenticity\n\nSartre's existentialism emphasizes the importance of authenticity and autonomy. He argues that individuals should strive to live authentically, free from external impositions. For autistic individuals, the journey towards authenticity involves reclaiming our identity from the pressures of masking and othering. It means embracing our neurodiversity and asserting our right to exist as we are, without the need to conform to neurotypical standards.\n\nReframing Autism\n\nViewing autism through the lens of \"The Transcendence of the Ego\" encourages a shift in perspective. It invites us to see autistic individuals not as deficient or lacking in self-awareness but as possessing a unique form of consciousness that is equally valid. This reframing challenges the stigma associated with autism and promotes a more inclusive understanding of neurodiversity.\n\nConclusion\n\nSartre's insights into the nature of consciousness and the construction of the ego offer valuable parallels to the autistic experience. By applying his ideas, we can better understand the challenges of othering and masking, and the importance of authenticity for autistic individuals. Ultimately, Sartre's philosophy encourages us to recognize and celebrate the diversity of human consciousness, fostering a more inclusive and empathetic society."
