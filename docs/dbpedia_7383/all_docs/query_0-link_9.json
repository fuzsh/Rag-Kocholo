        "text": "As opposed to the first distinction of embodiment, in which the body is entirely within the realm of first-person responsibly and action (i.e., the body for Itself), the second distinction (i.e., the body for the Other) shifts to the body as now under the third-person viewpoint of another subject—the body’s “other plane of existence.” Sartre construes human corporeity in these terms: “Either it [the body] is a thing among other things, or else it is that by which things are revealed to me. But it cannot be both at the same time.” This more succinctly frames the difference between the body for Itself and the body for the Other; they are two distinct spheres of being. The body for the Other is the place wherein any kind of knowledge of the embodied self necessarily stems from the Other, as opposed to the body for Itself in which our understanding stems from ourselves alone. For instance, the location and operations of organs are all accounted by means of the Other; the anatomy textbooks and medical studies which provide this information are explicitly not our own. According to Sartre, in the second ontological dimension the way that we understand ourselves is inherently geared towards the Other.\n\nParadoxically, it is the fact that the body for the Other proves that my body, without a point of view, can still assert a point of view. “Because of the mere fact that I am not the Other, his body appears to me originally as a point of view on which I can take a point of view.” In other words, we can invert the relationship and become the Other’s Other—their body ‘becomes ours’. My relationship to the Other as an embodied subject can supplement or disrupt my relationship to my own body and vice versa. Importantly, for Sartre, this becomes a place of conflict between the body for Itself and the body for the Other.\n\nSartre believes that the body for the Other persists in competition with the body for Itself in the sense that both are aimed at transcending things in the world. As seen in the above example of the medical experiment, Sartre’s own transcendence of the objects in the room was further transcended by the doctor himself who was studying Sartre’s body like another object. This kind of encounter with the Other alienated Sartre as an embodied subject and turned him into “being-a-tool-among-tools.” In this way, his subjectivity was relegated to a third-person point of view in which bodily movements and the possibility for engagement with the world entered the domain of another. Sartre refers to this ontological shift as transcendence—transcended, that is, our subjective transcendence over objects has been further transcended by another subject who monopolizes and reduces our first-person stance in the world. Consequently, we no longer maintain the subject-object distinction over the world; our field of action has become distorted in so far as we become the object for another subject.\n\nWe are now better able to approach and understand the final distinction of embodiment in Sartre’s account. The third and final ontological dimension is the body for Itself as known by the Other. This phenomenological distinction becomes most apparent “with the appearance of the Other’s look.” Here, Sartre brings his account of the body to summation and frames it in terms of an intersubjective relationship between Myself in action and the Other who watches.\n\nWe must briefly recall that for Sartre the “the depth of our being” exists perpetually outside of us, that is, our inner, lived experience always occurs and is made apparent in the midst of the world. ‘Being-there’, no matter how personal we might conceive of it, remains a constant dimension of the Other. Our lived body escapes us because it is always ‘out there’ and not just ‘in here’. This is why the Other looms so large in Sartre’s account of lived experience. As Sartre states: “The shock of the encounter with the Other is for me a revelation in emptiness of the existence of my body outside as an in-itself for the Other.” The body does maintain an outward point of orientation in the world but it also is that which has no inward point of view on itself. To have an understanding of ourselves necessitates the presence of others; consciousness is fundamentally an intersubjective experience. Moreover, this becomes even more dramatic once we realize that the natural limitations that we have are further exacerbated by our interactions with others.\n\nAs we go about our business we engage with our surroundings (i.e., seeing, smelling, touching, tasting, etc.), but as soon as the Other enters into our horizons these sense perceptions now disintegrate into a new plane of possibilities which the Other has now introduced into our own field of action. “Thus at the very moment when I live my senses as this inner point of view on which I can take no point of view, their being-for-others haunts me: they are. For the Other, my senses are as this table or as this tree is for me.” In the body for Itself as known by the Other, our consciousness of the world shifts channels and becomes redirected towards that of the Other. Once we come into contact with the Other our facticity becomes even more dramatic because the ‘look’ of the Other catches us in the moment. Again, the example of the doctor and the patient proves useful. The doctor presses the stethoscope against my chest listening intently to my breathing patterns and objectifying me in my anatomical form; I, in turn, sit there patiently as the ground for the doctor’s actions. I become the contingent material (i.e., my body in Itself) for the Other’s transcendence. I am trapped in this perspective of the body as known by the Other. In short, my world becomes overtaken by their world. In order to surpass this situation, according to Sartre, it is imperative to transcend my facticity given by the look of the Other and, so, reassert my body for Itself and regain control of it as my field of action.\n\nThe example of shyness (what Sartre refers to as personal alienation) is perhaps the peak and pinnacle of this intersubjective drama of the ontological dimensions of the body. Sartre argues that we do not feel shyness because of the way in which we know our bodies. In other words, we cannot be alone and shy at the same time. Without the Other, there is no mechanism at work in which we could see our bodies through discomfort. Rather, Sartre suggests that we are shy for another reason: for the way in which the Other knows our body while we carry out particular tasks. This sense of shyness intensifies the more that the Other appears to us. The experience of feeling shy, therefore, occurs when the growing presence of the Other shrouds us in a third-person point of view, creating a deep sense of personal anxiety and vertigo. For instance, we become shy while standing on stage meanwhile hundreds of eyes bear down on us in one fell swoop. Or, we might feel shy due to the lights blinding our vision of the audience, rendering our lived bodies totally exposed to the diminishment of an Other that we cannot see but which nevertheless makes us feel naked. Furthermore, while on stage, we cannot surpass their knowledge of us—their Look—there is an existential chasm between us. We are locked in a facticity of which we cannot escape. The body for Itself as known by the Other inflicts great unease on us as we exist in social interactions.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this essay, I have provided a discussion of Sartre’s interpretation of embodiment. I have shown his three ontological dimensions of embodiment: the body for Itself, the body for the Other, and the body for Itself as known by the Other. In each case we learned that embodied consciousness is a deeply interpersonal experience in which the presence of the Other rises in relation to how we understand ourselves. Importantly, for Sartre, human corporeity cannot escape this reality. We, therefore, must learn to cope with the implications that the body is ours in as much as it is also theirs. If we as individuals want to uncover the essence of who we are, then our orientation towards this existential question necessarily involves others. How they perceive us and act in relation to us implicitly feeds into our own conception of ourselves. This dynamic can be highly conflictual due to a vastly social world wherein individuals are constantly under the watchful eyes of others. Sartre’s phenomenology aptly demonstrates the intricacies and effects associated with such kinds of situations."
