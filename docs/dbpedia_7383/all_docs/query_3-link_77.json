The purpose of this paper is to know what Jean-Paul Sartre knows about the existence of God. As for the purpose of this writing is to see Jean-Paul Sartre concept of God that said if God exist then humanity is nothing, man will be come it self if they nullify God himself. The method of the research ised is a literature research and descriptive method, which scientifically digs the flow and the core of Jean-Paul Sartre thoughts and what other factor that affects his thinking. The result of this research shows that for Sartre the existence of God only limits himself from freedom. With existence of God humans can’t be free to find their true identity. The real freedom according to Sartre is humans are willing to deny God’s existence in every aspect of their life. The implications tha we can get from Jean-Paul Sartre idea is we have to acknowledge that philosophical thinking can not be separated from the context of its era so we must be careful on understanding Sartre thoughts that stated that we become ourself when we deny the existence of God, that’s why as a human we must be willing to learn through education and our experiences with God, so we can develop meaning for ourself and those around us by prioritizing God. Because of that, we must be responsible with what we belief on reaching our own existence.Key Words: Exitensialism; Jean-Paul Sartre; God\n\nGillespie, John H., Marcos Norris, and Nik Farrell-Fox. \"Book Reviews.\" Sartre Studies International 24, no. 1 (June 1, 2018): 91–99. http://dx.doi.org/10.3167/ssi.2018.240107.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nKate Kirkpatrick, Sartre and Theology (London: Bloomsbury, 2017), xi + 226 pp., ISBN 978-0-567-66449-5 (paperback).Kate Kirkpatrick, Sartre on Sin: Between Being and Nothingness (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017), xii + 262 pp., ISBN 978-0-198-81173-2 (hardback).Gary Cox, Existentialism and Excess: The Life and Times of Jean-Paul Sartre (London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2016), vii + 338 pp., ISBN 978-1-474-23533-4 (hardback).\n\nSwaminathan, Pillai Rajammal, and Dr K.

It is centered upon the analysis of existence and of the way humans find themselves existing in the world. The perception is that, humans exist first and then each individual spends a lifetime changing their essence or nature. Existentialism is a philosophy concerned with finding self and the meaning of life through free will, choice, and personal responsibility. Existentialism is a quest for authentic existence. Jean-Paul Sartre says, ‘Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself. Such is the first principle of existentialism.’ Man’s sufferings and humiliations comes under the aspect of existentialism, which is found in the novels of Anand. Anand is a humanist and his humanism manifests itself in a realistic representation of the inhumanity of the situation of the oppressed masses, suffering, various types of disability, discrimination and alienation. Existentialism is an aspect of humanism and Anand has portrayed it through human beings pathetic sufferings and miseries. Anand’s humanism dwells into the survival of human love through existentialism. The humanism of Anand showcases the concerns of existentialism, exposing the reality of life and its tragic condition of suffering and misery. The pathetic condition of suffering and misery is existential since it has the elements of chance, absurdity and nothingness in them. Their alienated conditions are shaped by fear and loneliness. Though Anand denies of being an existentialist, his most of the works reveal existential ideologies of Sartre and Heidegger.\n\nMeagher, Thomas, and Farhang Erfani. \"Book Reviews.\" Sartre Studies International 25, no. 2 (December 1, 2019): 99–106. http://dx.doi.org/10.3167/ssi.2019.250208.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nA.

Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980), the founder of Existentialism, is both a professional philosopher and a talented man of letters whose literary achievements represent a declarative embodiment of his Existentialist philosophy. In his 1943 drama, The Flies (Les Mouches), Sartre puts the Greek myth into a drastically innovative structure, where contemporary issues and values are presented through classical outlines. The current study aims to present a critical analysis of Sartre's depiction of the Electra/Orestes myth in The Flies through demonstrating how Greek mythology becomes an essential substructure of the play's Existentialistic framework, on the one hand, and questioning the credibility of the Sartrean concept of freedom and commitment, as illustrated in the play, on the other hand. The study utilizes the Existentialist philosophy as a theoretical framework in order to elucidate that the Sartrean conception of freedom and commitment is paradoxically antithetical. The research investigates how Orestes has been theoretically free and the extent to which he strives, throughout the drama, to transform this abstract freedom into a concrete experience by committing himself to a specific action: murdering Aegisthus and Clytemnestra. However, as the study proves, this Existentialist freedom becomes an illusion in the sense that Orestes' commitment to the Argives makes him a captive of society; by choosing commitment, he dismisses his freedom. The researcher has chosen \"Freedom\" and \"Commitment\" as the main topic of the present study in order to expose Sartre's existentialistic awareness of modern human beings' dilemma under the influence of all forms of aggression and highlight the discrepancy between theoretical philosophy and real-life experiences. The study adopts an interdisciplinary analytical approach where myth, philosophy, and drama are dovetailed and fused in order to expand the scope of the analysis.\n\nBetschart, Alfred. \"Sartre was not a Marxist.\" Sartre Studies International 25, no. 2 (December 1, 2019): 77–91. http://dx.doi.org/10.3167/ssi.2019.250206.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nRonald Aronson praises Jean-Paul Sartre’s existential Marxism in an essay in the Boston Review. I argue that existential Marxism is a case of a contradictio in adiecto. Sartre was never recognized as a Marxist by his contemporaries. He not only failed to show any interest in the question of economic exploitation, but most of the answers he gave in the Critique even contradicted Marxist theory. His expression of Marxism as the philosophy of our time seems to have rather been more an act of courtesy than the expression of deep conviction. As Sartre himself later said, Marxism and existentialism are quite separate philosophies.\n\nFavero, Roberto Carlos. \"Humanismo: uma releitura existencial de Albert Camus e Jean Paul Sartre.\" Universidade do Vale do Rio do Sinos, 2006. http://www.repositorio.jesuita.org.br/handle/UNISINOS/2014.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nMade available in DSpace on 2015-03-04T21:01:05Z (GMT).

Acreditar no mundo e no verdadeiro humanismo é o que nos falta. Nós perdemos, completamente, o senso de valorizar, respeitar e dar condições necessárias, para que o ser humano se realize na sua plenitude e com referenciais éticos. O racional tornou-se o irracional; o humano, o inumano. Acreditar no homem significa, principalmente, suscitar acontecimentos, atitudes, ainda que corriqueiras, mas que visem a redescobrir a essência do humanismo. É necessário, pois, urgentemente, uma redefinição em nosso próprio conceito de humanismo que nos impulsione a um compromisso humanizador.A proposição básica dos filósofos, Camus e Sartre, é que: como é impossível salvar tudo, salve-se, ao menos, o corpo de cada indivíduo.

The method is resolutely analytical, aiming to identify and assess the details of Sartre's position and arguments for it in the light of classical and current debates. This involves much exegetical work concerned with Sartre's use of terms and principles drawn from previous thinkers. The secondary aim is to show the extent to which the famous themes of Sartrean existentialism - freedom, bad faith, and the look - are grounded in his theory of phenomenal consciousness. The principal text is Being and Nothingness, though extensive use is made of works that preceded it. The thesis comprises four chapters. Chapter 1 is concerned with clarifying Sartre's conception of intentionality in relation to current anglophone conceptions of intentionality. I detail and defend Sartre's view that intentionality is a relation of apprehension that involves both qualitative and classificatory awareness. Chapter 2 situates Sartre in relation to classical and current theories of consciousness and assesses Sartre's arguments for his conception of intentionality. I claim that Sartre has shown that his conception is useful, but not that it is correct. In chapter 3, I argue that Sartre succeeds in maintaining that perception and hallucination involve distinct types of experience, where current anglophone attempts to maintain this fail. In Chapter 4, I argue that Sartre's holistic view of the subject as an environment-inclusive being-in-the-world is preferable to reductionism, and that his theory of qualitative aspects of experience is preferable to the representationalist approaches dominant in anglophone thought. I conclude by drawing out the implications of my discussion for Sartre's theories of freedom, bad faith, and the look.\n\nWilcox, Eliot J. \"The Absurd in the Briar Patch: Ellison's Invisible Man and Existentialism.\" BYU ScholarsArchive, 2010. https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/2305.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis article claims that Ralph Ellison's use and then revision of French existential themes is essential to understanding his overriding message of Invisible Man: Ellison's hope for a more polyglot American democracy that transcends the white democracy of mid twentieth century America. Specifically, I argue that Ellison, after demonstrating his ability to understand and engage in the traditional ideology of European existentialism, deviates from its individualistic conclusions demanding that the larger community, not just the solitary individual, must become ethically responsible if the classic existential tenet of authenticity is to be achieved. In order to establish this claim, I identify key passages in Invisible Man that indicate Ellison's desire to engage the existential movement. Writings from Camus and Sartre provide the foundation for comparison between Ellison's work and the French based philosophy. This background provides the groundwork to explore Ellison's deviations from the existential forms of his day. These departures have significant implications for Ellison's view of a socially productive individual, and therefore of his message in Invisible Man. In order to document the prevalence of existentialism in Ellison's literary consciousness, I then discuss its rise and decline in postwar New York. I also outline what is known about Ellison's relationship to the movement. Lastly, I conclude with a discussion of the philosophical tradition of existential philosophy and the difference between the philosophy of existence, seen in the Western canon through philosophers like Kierkegaard, and existentialism, one of its popular manifestations that peaked in the 1940s. Separating the two existential movements allows me to explore the tangential way most Ellison critics have associated him with existentialism and advocate for a more inclusive critical discussion of Ellison's relationship to existentialism.\n\nMitchell, David. \"The concept of perversity as a means towards a non-humanist existentialism in the philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre and Friedrich Nietzsche.\" Thesis, University of Liverpool, 2013. http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/17453/.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nExistentialism, broadly construed, can be understood in terms of a desire to ‘return to man’. In other words, underpinning existentialist thought is a sense that modern philosophy has lost touch with the essential goal of allowing man to comprehend his own existence. And it is this aim then, of a return to man’s being as it is concretely lived and experienced, that it seeks to realise. However it will be argued in this thesis that, against familiar criticisms of such a project, this ‘return’ does not simply necessitate a return to, or acceptance of, ‘humanism’. For influenced by Heidegger’s Letter on Humanism, Marxist, structuralist and post-structuralist critics have all suggested this movement is synonymous with a naive or romantic ‘humanist’ idea of the subject. That is, they have suggested that existentialism’s ‘return to man’ amounts at best to the radicalisation of a discredited subject-entity concept. As such, against this, we will argue that existentialism and its ‘return to man’ is not simply another humanism. And we will attempt to demonstrate this point, and resolve this apparent contradiction, by exploring the idea of perversity in the work of Sartre and Nietzsche. For if man is understood as a ‘perversion’ of something other than himself then it may be possible to have a philosophy of man without appealing to the notion of an isolated subject-entity. How will we do this though? In the first half of the thesis we will look at the way in which for Nietzsche the human can be understood as a perversion of fundamental natural forces. We will attempt this first of all by looking at the genesis of the free spirit as a perversion of man’s normal, fettered state. Secondly we will look at On The Genealogy of Morality, and explore how man can be understood there as a ‘perverse animal’; as a perversion of the active force of will-to-power. Continuing, in the second half of the thesis, we will then explore the idea of man as a ‘perversion of being’ that we find in Sartre’s Being and Nothingness. We will see there how man exists, first of all, as a perverse non-being in relation to being. Next though we will look at how this ontological fact implies a secondary perverse attempt by man to conceal this reality from himself. Consequently then by exploring such a ‘perverse’ conception of man we hope to show how a non-humanist existentialism, and ‘return to man’, is possible.\n\nGoncalves, Leonardo Gomes Sette. \"A morte de Deus na arquitetura: aproximações entre L\\'Esprit Nouveau e o existencialismo.\" Universidade de São Paulo, 2015. http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/93/93131/tde-27012016-135409/.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nEsta dissertação é parte integrante das atividades para a obtenção do título de Mestre em Artes pelo Programa de Pós-Graduação Interunidades em Estética e História da Arte da Universidade de São Paulo (PGEHA-USP). Nela deseja-se identificar alguns conceitos presentes na Fenomenologia Existencial de Jean-Paul Sartre que podem se situar dentro da estrutura de formação do Projeto Moderno na Arquitetura e no Design. O pensamento moderno na arquitetura e o pensamento existencial na filosofia são, ambos, reflexos singulares de uma transformação muito mais ampla e radical na história do mundo ocidental. Porém este período - o final do século XIX e no início do século XX representa para a filosofia e para o campo artístico um momento de ruptura sem precedentes. Este pensamento transformador que gemina tanto na filosofia existencialista quanto na arquitetura moderna associados a estas transformações se evidenciam através dos manifestos, dos tratados e dos escritos desta época. Esta dissertação busca portanto encontrar, através da análise destes dois conjuntos teóricos, alguns conceitos que podem ser inter-relacionados. Ao final do processo espera-se, contudo, que as análises produzidas possam contribuir para ampliar, de um ponto de vista bastante específico, a percepção da formação movimento moderno na arquitetura e no design.\n\nThis work is part of the activities to obtain the title of Master of Arts from the Graduate Inter Program in Aesthetics and Art History at the University of São Paulo (USP-PGEHA). It is desired to identify some concepts present in the Existential Phenomenology of Jean-Paul Sartre that may be located within the training structure Modern Design in Architecture and Design. The modern thinking in architecture and existential thought in philosophy are both unique reflections of a much broader transformation and radical in the history of the Western world. But this time - the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century - is to philosophy and the artistic field a moment of unprecedented disruption. This transformer thought gemina both existentialist philosophy as in modern architecture - associated with these transformations - are evident through the manifestos, treaties and the writings of this time. This paper therefore seeks to find, through the analysis of these two theoretical sets, some concepts that can be interrelated. At the end of the process it is hoped, however, that produced analysis can contribute to enlarge, to a very specific point of view, the perception of training modern movement in architecture and design.\n\nHayim, Gila J.
