        "text": "The origins of Existentialism\n\nKierkegaard and Sartre\n\nSoren Kierkegaard was the first philosopher to actually consider that he wrote about Existentialism. Since his time existential approaches to philosophy about life have grown very greatly in influence and also appeared in several forms influenced by numerous writers and thinkers. In retrospect several writers who lived before Kierkegaard are seen as having been concerned with the same subject matter. All these earlier and later writers works have influenced the modern world - and perhaps by more than we can know.\n\nAfter the Second World War was there was a most notable upsurgence of enthusuiasm amongst substantial sections of the rising generation and the intelligentsia for philosophic ideas concerned with existential approaches to life. The writer principally looked to during this phase of the popularisation of an atheistic and humanistic approach to Existentialist philosophy was Jean Paul Sartre.\n\nWell, what is Existentialism?\n\nExistentialism is philosophical and literary tendency that typically displays a dismissal of abstract theories that seek to disguise the untidiness of actual human lives and emphasizes the subjective realities of individual existence, individual freedom, and individual choice. It is virtually impossible to define absolutely as it is now so broad in its approaches but some of its major strands can be outlined.\n\nThere is an emphasis on each person finding their own way in life, on making choices, (including, in particular, all serious and momentous life-choices), for oneself as one sees fit without reliance on external standards or practice. This tendency to effectively deny that there is an acceptable basis for moral decision making diverges markedly from an earlier, and often largely unquestioned faith-related, emphasis that there could be, and indeed were, moral standards to which all might beneficially conform.\n\nWhereas an acceptance of moral standards could provide an objective basis for making choices Existentialism's denial of the existence of moral standards means that the primary basis for the making of choices has to be subjective. Persons actively engaged in situations may well make choices that are subjectively valid in terms of themselves, there and then, but which might seem questionable to a dispassionate observer.\n\nThere is a full acceptance that individuals are free to choose their own path and an associated declaration that individuals must accept the risk and responsibility of following their commitment wherever it leads. Choices made tend to establish the subsequent pattern of individuals lives and also profoundly influence the ensuing nature and aspect of the person who makes them. Even choosing not to make a choice is a form of choice bringing with it consequences. People are inevitably faced with choice in very many contexts.\n\nOne of the life choices Kierkegaard thought that people could make, and the one that he chose for himself, was a life fully aligned with faith.\n\nIn contrast to this Nietzsche, who was himself descended from a recent background of Lutheran, clerical, ancestry proclaimed that \"God is dead\" and went on to endorse an, heroic, pagan ideal.\n\nThe respective approaches of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Sartre are considered in more detail on some of our other pages.\n\nThe fashion for Existentialism after the Second World War saw its influence pervading widely and deeply into journalism, poetry, the playhouse, and the cinema. The outlook of the modern world has been formed, perhaps more than we readily appreciate, by Existentialist philosophy as advertised and sponsored from many sides.\n\nExistentialist philosophy has developed two main aspects i.e. \"Christian\" and \"Humanist\".\n\nApart from Kierkegaard's initial impetus the \"Christian\" aspect has had such main contributors as the German Protestant theologians Paul Tillich and Rudolf Bultmann, the French Roman Catholic theologian Gabriel Marcel, the Russian Orthodox philosopher Nikolay Berdyayev, and the German Jewish philosopher Martin Buber.\n\nApart from Nietzsche and Sartre the \"Humanist\" aspect can claim to find representation in the works of European based writers such as Jaspers, Dostoyevsky, Kafka, Malraux, Camus and Beckett and also such American based writers as Mailer and Miller.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson\n\nRALPH WALDO EMERSON (1803-1882) was, in his time, the leading voice of intellectual culture in the United States. He remains widely influential to this day through his essays, lectures, poems, and philosophical writings.\n\nIn the later eighteen-twenties Ralph Waldo Emerson read, and was very significantly influenced by, a work by a French philosopher named Victor Cousin.\n\nA key section of Cousin's work reads as follows:\n\n\"What is the business of history? What is the stuff of which it is made? Who is the personage of history? Man : evidently man and human nature. There are many different elements in history. What are they? Evidently again, the elements of human nature. History is therefore the development of humanity, and of humanity only; for nothing else but humanity develops itself, for nothing else than humanity is free. …\n\n… Moreover, when we have all the elements, I mean all the essential elements, their mutual relations do, as it were, discover themselves. We draw from the nature of these different elements, if not all their possible relations, at least their general and fundamental relations.\"\n\nIntroduction to the History of Philosophy (1829)\n\nEven before he had first read Cousin, (in 1829), Emerson had expressed views in his private Journals which suggest that he accepted that Human Nature, and Human Beings, tend to display three identifiable aspects and orientations:\n\nImagine hope to be removed from the human breast & see how Society will sink, how the strong bands of order & improvement will be relaxed & what a deathlike stillness would take the place of the restless energies that now move the world. The scholar will extinguish his midnight lamp, the merchant will furl his white sails & bid them seek the deep no more. The anxious patriot who stood out for his country to the last & devised in the last beleagured citadel, profound schemes for its deliverance and aggrandizement, will sheathe his sword and blot his fame. Remove hope, & the world becomes a blank and rottenness. (Journal entry made between October and December, 1823)\n\nIn all districts of all lands, in all the classes of communities thousands of minds are intently occupied, the merchant in his compting house, the mechanist over his plans, the statesman at his map, his treaty, & his tariff, the scholar in the skilful history & eloquence of antiquity, each stung to the quick with the desire of exalting himself to a hasty & yet unfound height above the level of his peers. Each is absorbed in the prospect of good accruing to himself but each is no less contributing to the utmost of his ability to fix & adorn human civilization. (Journal entry of December, 1824)\n\nOur neighbours are occupied with employments of infinite diversity. Some are intent on commercial speculations; some engage warmly in political contention; some are found all day long at their books â¦ (This dates from January - February, 1828)\n\nThe quotes from Emerson are reminiscent of a line from another \"leading voice of intellectual culture\" - William Shakespeare.\n\nThere's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare: Henry IV (Pt 1), Act I, Scene II\n\nPlato, Socrates and Shakespeare endorse a 'Tripartite Soul' view of Human Nature. Platos' Republic\n\nRelated Link Pages\n\nWe strongly recommend:\n\nEurope in 1848 : A seed-plot of History?\n\nIn relation to the European Revolutions of 1848 the historian Eric Hobsbawm has written:\n\n\"There have been plenty of greater revolutions in the history of the modern world, and certainly plenty of more successful ones. Yet there has been none which spread more rapidly and widely, running like a bushfire across frontiers, countries and even oceans.\"\n\nIn 1806 the Habsburg Emperor, who held the \"Holy Roman\" Imperial title and exercised direct dynastic authority over many lands stretching from Poland to the Mediterranean, was hard-pressed by the activities of Napoleon Bonaparte, and accepted the termination of the Holy Roman Empire (due to sweeping reforms instituted by Napoleon in western parts of Germanic Europe), and adopted the title of Emperor of Austria.\n\nBy late spring 1848, the Habsburg Empire looked like a hopeless case: the monarchy's northern Italian possessions in revolt, invaded by a Piedmontese army and largely cleared of Austrian troops; three different \"national\" governments in Vienna, Budapest and Zagreb each claiming sovereign authority; Polish, Romanian, Slovenian, Serb, Czech, and Slovak national movements aspiring to a similar sovereign status; a mentally incompetent monarch and his court in flight from the capital to the provinces; a state treasury completely bare.\n\nJonathan Sperber, The European Revolutions, 1848-1851, p. 203\n\nIn February 1948, the British historian Lewis Namier delivered a lecture commemorating the centennial of the European Revolutions of 1848.\n\nIn this lecture Namier presented facts about the historical developments, themes, and events evident in 1848 and reached the conclusion that:\n\n\"1848 remains a seed-plot of history. It crystallized ideas and projected the pattern of things to come; it determined the course of the following century.\"\n\nWe are pleased to make available a series of informative pages about the highly significant and, we would venture to suggest, the prodigiously historically instructive European Revolutions of 1848:\n\n1 The European Revolutions of 1848 begin\n\nA broad outline of the background to the onset of the turmoils and a consideration of some of the early events in Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Budapest and Prague.\n\n2 The French Revolution of 1848\n\nA particular focus on France - as an Austrian foreign minister said \"When France sneezes Europe catches a cold\".\n\n3 The \"Italian\" Revolution of 1848\n\nA \"liberal\" Papacy after 1846 helps allow the embers of an \"Italian\" national aspiration to rekindle across the Italian Peninsula.\n\n4 The Revolution of 1848 in the German Lands and central Europe\n\n\"Germany\" had a movement for a single parliament in 1848 and many central European would-be \"nations\" attempted to promote a distinct existence for their \"nationality\".\n\n5 The European Revolutions - reactionary aftermath 1848-1849\n\nSome instances of social and political extremism allow previously pro-reform liberal elements to join conservative elements in supporting the return of traditional authority. Such nationalities living within the Habsburg Empire as the Czechs, Croats, Slovaks, Serbs and Roumanians, find it more credible to look to the Emperor, rather than to the democratised assemblies recently established in Vienna and in Budapest as a result of populist aspiration, for the future protection of their nationality.\n\nThe Austrian Emperor and many Kings and Dukes regain political powers. Louis Napoleon, (who was a nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte), was elected as President in France offering social stability at home but ultimately followed policies which resulted in dramatic changes to the wider European structure of states and their sovereignty.\n\nThe events of 1848-1849 arose from the strong emergence into the Socio-Politico-Economic History of nineteenth-century Europe of populist forces such as Liberalism, Constitutionalism, Nationalism and Socialism.\n\nThese populist forces were promoted by various interest groups within and between the pre-existing dynastic Empires and Kingdoms of Europe, often challenging the continuance of dynastic authority and governance and proving to be competitive, in that popular aspirations expressed by some interest groups often proved unpalatable to other interest groups within and between the pre-existing dynastic states of Europe.\n\nRadical socialist reformers sought justice for the \"disinherited\" classes, the peasants and the factory workers, while more moderate political reformers were concerned with protecting and increasing the influence of the middle classes, the bourgeoisie and the professional groups. The radicals in general favoured a republican form of government while many moderates were prepared to accept constitutional monarchy as a satisfactory substitute …\n\n… Many of the revolutionaries, especially in the German Confederation and Italy, wanted to transform their homeland into a strong and united country, but their aims contradicted the nationalist aspirations of minority groups.\n\nFrom the opening chapter to \"Revolution and Reaction 1848-1852\" by Geoffrey Brunn\n\nMiddle class liberals, who had favoured constitutional rather than dynastic governance, were amongst the first of the previously pro-reform aspirational groups to return to supporting dynastic authority when it became plain that other populist interest groups favoured wider extensions of democracy than they themselves wished to see adopted.\n\nRural dwellers were often largely satisfied with reforms to systems of land tenure and the reduction of obligations to provide assistance, through labour-services, to their landlords. Once such reforms were put in place in the Austrian Empire, country dwellers, although often relatively materially poor, tended accept the suppression of urban radicalism and the re-establishment of dynastic authorities.\n\nAll in all a \"united front\" failed to become established amongst those seeking reform and gradually proved possible for dynastic authorities to re-assert themselves often with the aid of their pre-revolutionary military forces.\n\nThe historian A. J. P. Taylor later referred to the events of 1848 as being \"a turning-point when history failed to turn\" nevertheless \"The Future\" was put on notice that such populist-aspirational forces were capable of making pressing claims in relation to Socio-Politico-Economic developments."
