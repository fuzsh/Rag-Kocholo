        "text": "Sartre: Aftermath of WWII (06:33)\n\nFREE PREVIEW\n\nJean-Paul Sartre defies conventional logic. He searches for the meaning of freedom. His philosophy is known as Existentialism. Sartre brings hope to an exhausted, post-war France.\n\nSartre's Philosophy and \"Nausea\" (07:01)\n\nSartre argues that there is no predetermined character called the self. The self is defined by what a person does. Life is not scripted. He publishes \"Nausea\" (\"La Nausee\").\n\nSartre the Writer (04:35)\n\nDuring WWII, Sartre's work as a meteorologist provides him time to write and think. He works on \"Being and Nothingness.\" Sartre links individual freedom to society as a whole.\n\nSartre's Growing Influence in France (05:09)\n\nSartre's friend remembers the liberation of France. Sartre's writings speak to a liberated people. To drive social change, he starts a magazine that is called “Les Temps Modernes.”\n\nSartre: Famous and Infamous (06:04)\n\nThe mainstream press attacks Sartre, accusing him of moral corruption. He believes that humans cannot be free if there is an all-powerful god. Human relations always involve conflict.\n\n\"No Exit\" and Relationships With Women (04:32)\n\nSartre's most popular play is \"No Exit.\" He believes personal freedom is impossible in relation to other people. Sartre maintains many relationships with women. Sartre's theory of free will has flaws.\n\nSartre, Marxism, and Individual Freedom (04:49)\n\nSartre struggles with the existentialism of individual freedom and the collective freedom of Marxism. In 1964 Sartre refuses to accept the Nobel Prize. He lends his name to militant, far-left causes.\n\nSartre: Successes and Failures (07:43)\n\nSartre's ideas become more extreme. He advocates social violence. Philosophy and politics cannot be separated. Freedom is a journey. The French mourn the death of their great philosopher."
