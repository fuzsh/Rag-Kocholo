        "text": "POSTCOLONIALITY: The French Dimension\n\nMargaret A. Majumdar\n\nOpen Access\n\n978-1-80073-944-4 $19.95/£15.95 / Pb / May 2023\n\nOutlining in particular the contribution of thinkers such as Césaire, Senghor, Memmi, Sartre and Fanon to the worldwide development of anti-imperialist ideas, Majumdar offers a critical perspective on the ongoing difficulties of France’s relationship with its colonial and postcolonial Others and suggests new lines of thought that are currently emerging in the Francophone world, which may have the capacity to take these debates.\n\nRead the introduction.\n\nEXISTENTIALISM AND CONTEMPORARY CINEMA: A Sartrean Perspective\n\nEdited by Jean-Pierre Boulé and Enda MacCaffrey\n\n978-1-78238-494-6 $34.95/£27.95 / Pb / March 2014\n\n“One of the strengths of the volume overall is the breadth of approaches to and applications of Sartrean thinking, from the personal and political to the atheistic and artistic. There is also a refreshing selection of films under consideration…their edited collection is very welcome evidence in support of the proposition that thinking about Sartre and film together can produce stimulating and insightful film philosophy.” · Journal of Contemporary European Studies\n\nRead the introduction.\n\nSARTRE TODAY: A Centenary Celebration\n\nEdited by Adrian van den Hoven and Andrew Leak\n\n978-1-84545-166-0 $34.95/£27.95 / Pb / December 2005\n\n“Each chapter is well written and thoroughly researched, offering an overall balanced and insightful analysis of the subject at hand. The first two parts… treat the general reader to a crash course on Sartrean existentialism, which undergirds his engagement; the second part… links Sartre to the contemporary understanding of neuroscience and group therapy, and the third relates Sartre’s interest in biography, cinema and theatre to contemporary trends in these fields…This volume confirms Sartre’s stature as universal intellectual.” · Modern and Contemporary France\n\nSee more here."
