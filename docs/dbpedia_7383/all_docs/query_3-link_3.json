        "text": "Biography\n\nBefore delving into the details of Jean-Paul Sartre’s\n\nlife, I think it reasonable to reveal what type of man Sartre was. The\n\nbest description of Sartre appears in Ronald Hayman’s Sartre. This passage reveals more of Sartre’s personality than any other I have read; I am left to quote rather liberally from Hayman’s text.\n\nSartre felt most at home in cafés and restaurants where he could annex\n\nspace by dominating the conversation and exhaling smoke…. But, like Kafka, he never felt more free than when he was writing, creating an imaginary space. Paper as magic carpet; pen as wand…. After a paradisal infancy centered on the belief that he was beautiful, he systematically tried to reject his body. To reassure his mind that it had nothing to fear from sibling rivalry with his mal-treated body he consistently ignored all messages [his body] sent out. He resisted fatigue, treated pain as if it were a challenge. To step up his productivity he made reckless use of… stimulants, taking sedatives when he wanted to relax. He resented the time he had to spend on washing, shaving, cleaning his teeth, taking a bath, excreting, and he would economize by carrying on conversations… through the bathroom door. He had no personal vanity…. When his smoke-stained teeth began to decay, he refused to waste time on seeing a dentist…. He took immeasurable pride in his intellect — “I’ve got a golden brain.”\n\n– Sartre; Hayman, p. 21–22\n\nThe image of Sartre painted by various biographers, even Simone de Beauvoir, is one of a man obsessed with his own intellect, to the neglect of almost all else. Sartre was always certain of his own value to society as a philosopher and writer, never avoiding an opportunity to demonstrate his superior mind. In the end, he managed to convince a great many people of his importance. That alone made him important.\n\nEarly Years\n\nJean-Paul Sartre was born 21 June 1905 in Paris, the\n\nonly child of Jean-Baptiste and Anne-Marie Sartre, two individuals from\n\ndistinguished families. Jean-Baptiste Sartre was the son of Dr. Eymard\n\nSartre, a noted country doctor in the Dordogne region of France. Eymard\n\nhad written several medical texts; he published his first work in his\n\nearly twenties. Sartre’s mother was the first cousin of Albert Schweitzer,\n\nthe famous German missionary.\n\nEymard was a cynical and unhappy man. He had married\n\nthe daughter of a pharmacist, under the impression her family was well-positioned.\n\nMuch like his grandson Jean-Paul, it is clear that Eymard cared a great\n\ndeal about his social status. The marriage was unhappy, with Eymard seldom\n\nspeaking. Jean-Baptiste came to resent his homelife, especially his father’s\n\nsilences. Setting his sights upon escaping from his family, Jean-Baptiste\n\nfocused his energies upon his studies. An excellent student, Jean-Baptiste\n\ngained admission into the Ecole Polytechnique, a presitgious technical\n\nschool. Still, he wanted to be even further from his past. Jean-Baptiste\n\nsought refuge in the French navy, enlisting in 1897.\n\nAnne-Marie Schweitzer was the daughter of Karl “Charles”\n\nSchweitzer. While the uncle of famed thinker Albert Schweitzer, Karl\n\nwas famous in his own right. Karl had published several texts on religion,\n\nphilosophy and languages. In fact, Karl was the co-author of a series\n\nof texts on English, German, and French. With two authors for grandfathers,\n\nJean-Paul Sartre might have been destined to write.\n\nJean-Baptiste Sartre and Anne-Marie Schweitzer married\n\non 5 May 1904, in Paris. The two were truly in love, Anne-Marie completely\n\ndedicated to her husband. Both families seem to have been pleased by\n\nthe marriage; Eymard Sartre finally established a link to a well-placed\n\nfamily, while the Schweitzer’s seemed to appreciate Jean-Baptiste’s intellect.\n\nTo the joy of all, the young couple had a son, Jean-Paul Charles Aymard\n\nSartre, on 21 June 1905. Jean-Baptiste, however, was away on a naval\n\nassignment. Upon his return in November, Jean-Baptiste wrote to his family\n\nof how handsome his son was. Jean-Paul Sartre’s father also noted how\n\nactive the young child was, how full of energy.\n\nSadly, Jean-Baptiste had contracted entercolitis during\n\na voyage to China. He became ill in March, 1906, and was forced to request\n\na leave from the navy. the young family moved to a farm near Eymard Sartre’s\n\nresidence. Jean-Baptiste died on 17 September 1906, at the age of 32.\n\nBarely more than a year after Jean-Paul’s birth, his father had died. “The\n\ndeath of Jean-Baptiste was my greatest piece of good fortune. I didn’t\n\neven have to forget him,” Sartre later claimed.\n\nAfter the death of Jean-Paul’s father, his mother moved\n\ninto her parent’s home. His grandfather was a strict man, dedicated to\n\nlearning, while his mother pampered young Jean-Paul. The year’s living\n\nin the Schweitzer house affected Sartre for his entire life.\n\nAnne-Marie and Jean-Paul shared a room in the Schweitzer\n\nresidence. A young woman, Anne-Marie found herself treated like a child\n\nby her domineering father. To escape his oppressive personality, Anne-Marie\n\nshowered her young son with attention, often treating him like a toy\n\nor a doll. She dressed her son in frilly clothing, let his hair grow\n\nlong, and lavished him with attention. Young Jean-Paul was called “Poulou” by\n\nhis mother, usually in a sweet tone.\n\nKarl Schweitzer presided over others with his size\n\nand personality. His white beard and commanding voice intimidated others;\n\nmembers of the local Catholic parish treated Scweitzwer with respect\n\noften reserved for a priest. The Schweitzer family’s reputation contributed\n\nto Karl’s confidence — and vanity. Though in his sixties, Karl knew\n\nhe was still attractive, and sought to prove his virility at every chance.\n\nAs Jean-Paul grew, he saw this “religious” man conduct numerous\n\naffairs, including one with a former student. Anne-Marie came to despise\n\nher father’s behavior, as did her son. Curiously, Sartre would engage\n\nin numerous affairs and empty relationships throughout his life.\n\nEventually, Karl tired of having a grandson that looked\n\nmore like a girl. One day, he took Jean-Paul to a local barber and had\n\nthe boy’s long hair trimmed. Upon seeing her son, Anne-Marie rushed to\n\nher room and cried. Jean-Paul was ugly. Many biographers have described\n\nSartre as ugly or unattractive. From an early illness, Sartre lost most\n\nof his vision in one eye. This eye, with a strabismus, seemed to look\n\naskance, as if Sartre was not paying attention. Worse, it was clear the\n\nboy was destined to be short and awkward. His grandparents referred to\n\nJean-Paul’s physique as a “Sartre” fault. Without his curly\n\nlong hair and fancy clothes, Sartre’s ugliness was obvious — even to\n\nhis mother.\n\nChildren being predisposed to brutal honesty, did not\n\nhide their disdain for young Jean-Paul’s appearance. His lack of physical\n\nsize and his odd appearance made him a target for abuse. He began to\n\nshow signs of a vindictive and angry personality. Jean-Paul’s only comfort\n\nwas his self-confidence; he knew he was smarter than other children.\n\nKarl also knew his grandson was smart. From seven generations\n\nof teachers, Karl was eager to tutor young Jean-Paul. In fact, Karl was\n\nquite proud of his “little man” as a student. Curiously, Sartre\n\nwould deny in several essays and his autobiographies that he had been\n\ntutored by his grandfather. Sartre’s willingness to avoid the truth was\n\nestablished at a young age, and he continued to lie or omit facts throughout\n\nhis life. Karl, despite Jean-Paul’s statements to the contrary, was an\n\nexcellent tutor and was dedicated to his grandson’s success. After all,\n\nJean-Paul carried Schweitzer blood.\n\nFearing her son was falling under the influence of\n\nher father, Anne-Marie sought to expose Sartre to more common experiences.\n\nWhile the great thinkers were important, as were other subjects, Anne-Marie\n\nalso thought the world should be experienced. She took young Jean-Paul\n\nto movies, bought him comics, and gave him serials to read. Sartre was\n\nespecially fond of American Western heroes, such as Buffalo Bill. Taking\n\nSartre out of the house also allowed Anne-Marie out, as she was not interested\n\nin a social life, remaining loyal to the memory of Jean-Baptiste.\n\nAt the age of eight, Sartre received some puppets from\n\nhis mother. These gifts inspired Sartre to write scripts and stage shows.\n\nHe slowly gained a small group of friends, or at least children willing\n\nto tolerate him in return for entertainment. Sartre enjoyed the attention\n\nassociated with his shows; he had learned that people like a performer.\n\nEymard Sartre died in October, 1913. His death allowed\n\nthe Schweitzer family near-complete control over Jean-Paul.\n\nGermany declared war in August, 1914. Sartre, like\n\nmost French citizens, was caught up in the frenzy of nationalism. War\n\nwas exciting, as long as it wasn’t personal. In October of 1914, Sartre\n\neven wrote a short story about a young French private who captures the\n\nKaiser. To prove he is superior to the German, the young Frenchman challenges\n\nthe Kaiser to a fist fight and wins. Jean-Paul was writing constantly;\n\nhe felt a sense of power and control while writing.\n\nIn the fall of 1915, Jean-Paul enrolled at Lycée Henri\n\nIV, a well-regarded school. At the school, Sartre easily made friends.\n\nThese young men were of the same class, with a great respect for knowledge\n\nand wit. Sartre demonstrated an abundance of wit. In a sign of things\n\nto come, one instructor noted that Sartre possessed an excellent mind,\n\nbut lacked mental discipline; Jean-Paul did not refine his thoughts.\n\nThis criticism mirrors that of scholars who now study Sartre’s works,\n\nso this is clearly a personality trait Sartre never outgrew. His mind\n\nwould race from topic to topic, never focused long enough to refine a\n\nthought. This tendency also resulted in careless errors.\n\nThe Stepchild & Rebel\n\nWhen Sartre was twelve, his mother remarried. For some\n\nreason, he viewed this as a betrayal. Sartre had grown unusually close\n\nto his mother and demanded all her attentions. The tension between Jean-Paul\n\nand the dominant patriarchs in his family lasted for his entire life.\n\nSartre seems to have rebelled against his grandfather and stepfather\n\nat every opportunity. Yet, for all indications, Joseph Mancy tried his\n\nbest to be a good father to Sartre.\n\nWhen Joseph Mancy married Anne-Marie in April of 1917, it was the culmination\n\nof a long-time attraction. Mancy had met Anne-Marie even before she met\n\nJean-Baptiste Sartre. Mancy found Anne-Marie quite attractive and wanted\n\nto know her better, but he was the son of a railway employee and considered “lower\n\nclass” by her family. In the intervening years Mancy had attended\n\nthe Ecole Polytechnique and earned an engineering degree. He was employed\n\nby the French Navy, making him quite acceptable to her family — he was\n\nsmart, well-educated, and capable of providing for Anne-Marie and her\n\nson.\n\nMancy moved the family in 1917 to La Rochelle, where he was working\n\nwith military contractors. Sartre quickly rebelled and found himself\n\nconstantly in trouble. He fought with fellow students often enough that\n\nhe could regularly be found serving after-school detention. His parents\n\nbegan to worry that he would become a thug — a common thief or worse.\n\nSartre stole money from his mother’s room, then lied about doing so.\n\nHis behavior was too much for his stepfather to accept. By 1920, Mancy\n\nrecognized that he could not control young Jean-Paul. The young Sartre\n\nwas sent back to Paris and the Lycée Henri IV, where he was a boarder\n\nat the school. He was thereby reunited with Paul-Yves Nizan, one of the\n\nmost important figures in his life.\n\nPaul-Yves Nizan\n\nOnly Simone de Beauvoir had a greater effect upon Jean-Paul Sartre than Paul-Yves Nizan. Nizan enrolled at the Lycée Henri IV in 1916 and soon after established a friendship with Jean-Paul. Nizan was a great deal like his father. An engineer, the elder Nizan often slipped into deep depressions without cause. The slightest stress could drive him to spells of drinking or, possibly worse, doing nothing at all. Sartre could never understand these bouts with depression and thought they were a sign of mental weakness. Despite this odd link between father and son, Sartre did envy the two Nizans’ close relationship. Paul-Yves knew his father, something Sartre was not able to do.\n\nWhile many students thought of Nizan as shy and quiet, Sartre recognized\n\na form of silent rage in his classmate. Over the years, he would learn\n\nthat Nizan was indeed carrying a great sense of rage, namely at various\n\nsocial injustices. Nizan could not help but ponder the state of mankind\n\nand French society in particular. Nizan seemed like an old man at time,\n\nnot the young student he was.\n\nReunited with Nizan in 1920, the two quickly became best friends. Other\n\nstudents would call them “Nitre & Sarzan,” in recognition\n\nof their unusually close relationship. Only women, as might be expected,\n\nwould come between them from 1920 into the early 1930s. Unlike Sartre,\n\nNizan was popular without trying. He found himself dominant among others\n\nthrough a natural ease. Sartre would develop popularity through a form\n\nof forced outrageousness.\n\nIn the fall of 1922, Nizan and Sartre enrolled at Lycée Louis-le-Grande,\n\nconsidered among the best prepatory schools in France. Being one of the “best” meant\n\nthat the school was also drab, authoritarian, and conservative. Over\n\ntime, Sartre would develop a distaste for the French “establishment” and\n\nits skills-based form of instruction.\n\nThere is some indication that Sartre came to think of Nizan as more\n\nthan a mere friend. Having read several accounts of the relationship,\n\none might conclude that there was a form of “love” between\n\nthe two young men — at least from Sartre’s perspective. When the two\n\nbecame estranged from March through October of 1923, Sartre suffered\n\na near-collapse emotionally; he had come to rely upon Nizan. Sartre vowed\n\nnever to care as much for any person again.\n\nThe two students were a study in opposites. Academically, Sartre was\n\nprone to “excessive elaboration of insufficiently clarified ideas,” according\n\nto one of his instructors. (Cite: Cohen-Solal and Hayman) At best, Sartre seemed disorganized and undisciplined in his writings. Meanwhile, despite his own unpredictable nature, Nizan seemed the perfect student. His works were clear and concise; he would later be known for his journalistic style of writing. If his academic works were disorderly, Sartre himself was also lacking any polish. His sanitary habits were questionable, his clothing a mess, and his nature loud. Nizan presented a neat, stylish, and calm exterior.\n\nSartre might have been “hyperactive” or what today is recognized\n\nas “ADD/ADHD” by psychiatry. To Nizan’s consternation, Sartre\n\nseemed in a constant state of motion and confusion. Sartre could not\n\neven sleep as others might; he required earplugs and a blindfold to sleep\n\nat night. He would bundle in his bed, to block all distractions. Awake,\n\nhe would fidget and move about a room. Sartre seemed agitated by the\n\nslightest things… one minor annoyance would set him off emotionally.\n\nFor one dedicated to the idea of self-control, he was unable to control\n\nhis own mind and body. These personality traits might explain some of\n\nthe tension between the two friends.\n\nEcole Normale Supérieure\n\nDespite their distaste for all things traditional and\n\nauthoritarian, Nizan and Sartre both enrolled in yet another famous French\n\nschool for their next level of education. The Ecole Normale Supérieure\n\nwas widely regarded as among the best of French universities. A companion\n\nschool of the Sorbonne, Ecole Normale Supérieure served as a psychology\n\nand philosophy campus. (Historical note: Robert de Sorbon endowed a college\n\nat the University of Paris for theological studies between 1250 and 1260.\n\nThe independent college of theology and philosophy came to be known as “the\n\nSorbonne.” The Sorbonne currently incorporates three colleges of\n\nthe Universities of Paris.)\n\nIn August of 1924, Sartre placed seventh on the ENS entrance exams,\n\nwhich are to this day highly competitive. Sartre’s classmates included\n\nRené Maheu, Jean Hyppolite, Pierre Guille, and Raymond Aron. Raymond\n\nAron’s role as a political and philosophical adversary of Sartre in later\n\nlife places him alongside Nizan and Albert Camus as someone Sartre would personally insult — ruining a good friendship.\n\nRaymond Claude Ferdinand Aron lived from 1905 until 17 Oct 1983. Much\n\nlike Nizan, Aron presented a calm, humble, yet brilliant persona. Unlike\n\nNizan, Sartre, and many other French intellectuals, Aron came to be known\n\nfor his pro-American and anti-Communist views. Like Sartre, Aron was\n\ninfluenced by Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl, and Max Weber.\n\nAt the start of France’s occupation in 1940, he fled toLondon to join\n\nthe forces of Gen. Charles de Gaulle, while Sartre and others remained\n\nin France. Aron viewed the main issue of the twentieth century as the\n\nthreat of strong governments to individual freedom. Curiously, Aron never\n\nturned upon Sartre — no matter how poorly Sartre treated him and his\n\nbeliefs.\n\nIn this new environment, Nizan became quite political. While Aron avoided\n\nleftist causes and Sartre simply followed much of the time, Nizan, Maheu,\n\nand Guille came to be known as true radicals at the school. Sartre’s\n\noutrageous nature lent itself to the group — he seems to have liked\n\nrebelliousness for its own thrill. These four students were hostile,\n\neven somewhat destructive.\n\nDuring Sartre’s first year at ENS, he was one of only five students\n\nof philosophy. “Normaliens,” as ENS students were known, tended\n\nto study theology, psychology, and the classics. Philosophy, at least\n\nduring the 1920s, had fallen from favor — viewed as a topic without\n\napplication. Sartre did enjoy the study of psychology; he would study\n\nand critique Freud throughout his writings. And, despite his later claims\n\nthat he did not read the “classics” while at ENS, library records\n\nindicate Sartre checked out hundreds of books, many of them classics.\n\nReading hundreds of works gave Sartre a vast amount of information from\n\nwhich to construct his papers as a student. Unfortunately, Sartre was\n\nstill as disorganized intellectually as he had been at Lycée Henri IV.\n\nInstructors’ notes located by biographers indicate Sartre would base\n\npapers upon theories he only partially understood; he was quick draw\n\nconclusions. However, as many students have demonstrated, a gift with\n\nwords sometimes masked Sartre’s ignorance or even intentional errors.\n\nEloquence served Sartre as a substitute for any depth of knowledge.\n\nAs a student at ENS, Nizan’s bouts with depression and anxiety increased.\n\nHe would skip seminars, spend countless days in drunken state, and often\n\nvanish for days at a time. His depression increased with his interest\n\nin politics and philosophy. Nizan described himself as torn between “action” and “la\n\nvie intérieure” — the interior life, possibly best translated as “living\n\nfor the self.”\n\nThough he thought Nizan was self-absorbed, it could be argued that Sartre\n\nwas actually self-centered to an extreme. Sartre even believed that by\n\nwriting about his life he communicated truths for all humanity. While\n\nNizan wanted to help all people through political action, Sartre lived\n\nhis own life without much political involvement — an apathy later changed\n\nby World War II. Nizan joined the Parti Communiste Français, the French\n\nCommunist Party, and was active in Groupe d’Information Internationale,\n\nan international student “news” organization. Sartre saw his\n\nfriend’s actions as a waste of time and energy on behalf of others. Sartre\n\nonce commented that Nizan’s attraction to Marxism was an attempt to justify\n\nhatreds.\n\nThe center of his own universe, Sartre wished to the be the center of\n\nall attention. Long ago made aware of his unattractive features by his\n\ngrandfather, Sartre realized he was the opposite of Nizan. Yet, instead\n\nof hiding, Sartre would announce his presence to all at any opportunity.\n\nDuring the March 1925 ENS “student revue,” a nude Jean-Paul\n\nSartre danced with Nizan. It was played for laughs; Sartre would rather\n\nbe comic than ignored.\n\nBut more important than being the center of attention, Sartre truly\n\nwanted to be the smartest person at ENS.\n\nI want to be the one who knows the most things\n\n– Hayman, p. 61\n\nx x x\n\nIf you are moral… {{quote this}}\n\n– Hayman, p. 61\n\nx\n\nThe First Simone\n\nBefore Jean-Paul Sartre met his life-long companion Simone de Beauvoir, he met and fell in love with Simone-Camille Sans. While attending a funeral for a cousin, Sartre first noticed Simone-Camille. She was 22 and from a respected family. Her father was a chemist in the Toulouse region of southern France. By the end of 1925, Sartre and “Toulouse,” as he called Simone-Camille, declared their love to each other in letters and to friends.\n\nSimone-Camille’s adventurous nature appealed to Sartre. She experimented\n\nwith any and all freedoms, but especially pursued sexual pleasures. She\n\nhad been involved in several wild orgies in Toulouse, hosted by the sons\n\nand daughters of other middle and upper-class families. The 1920s were\n\na time for such experimentation.\n\nSartre’s nature quickly revealed itself to “Toulouse.” She\n\nnoted his constant desire for self-control and order, while he continued\n\nto be volatile and disorganized. Her fiancé wrote and talked of being\n\ncompletely in charge of his own fate, but he seemed to lack any discipline.\n\nAs for independence, Sartre eventually seemed possessive and needy —\n\nhe needed to feel loved. When Sartre asked to see Toulouse during Easter\n\nbreak of 1926, she had to decline due to family commitments. Sartre could\n\nnot understand her telegram: “NOT FREE. POINTLESS TO COME SUNDAY.” He\n\ntook her message as a rejection, not the simple statement it was. In\n\nanger, he set a deadline for her to meet with him. One might assume he\n\nwould have let the deadline slip; he would not have rejected her.\n\nFor two weeks in December of 1926, Toulouse visited Sartre in Paris.\n\nShe attended the ENS winter formal, attracting some attention. She was\n\nan odd-mix of proper and ill-bred. She was interesting. Following her\n\nvisit, Sartre’s letters to Toulouse became less formal; in comparison,\n\nhe would later treat Simone de Beauviour with formality — at all times.\n\nWhile Sartre struggled to reconcile his relationship with Toulouse and\n\nhis strong desire for control, Nizan dated and fell in love with Henriette\n\nAlphen. Nizaon and Alphen were married on 24 December 1927, with Sartre\n\nand Raymond Aron serving as witnesses. Once again, Nizan demonstrated\n\na greater maturity and personal growth.\n\nBy 1928, the Sartre-Toulouse relationship was ending. Simone-Camille\n\nbecame the mistress of Charles Dullin, a well-known French stage actor.\n\nAnny, in La Nausée is based upon Toulouse — Anny is the mistress of an actor, too. When Sartre saw Toulouse in 1929, she seemed rather eccentric. She “talked” to the dead, danced about in a drunken state, and seemed lost in her thoughts.\n\nStudent Revolutionary\n\nFrench students, it would seem, have been in a constant\n\nstate of revolt since the late eighteenth century. Students, lacking\n\nany other target for their anger, often turn on the institutions of learning\n\n— and the people in charge. Jean-Paul Sartre and his classmates at the\n\nEcole Normale Supérieure followed in this tradition. Sartre’s personal\n\ntarget was Gustave Lanson, the head of the school. Jean-Paul was impersonate\n\nLanson and pull childish pranks at the master’s expense.\n\nSartre’s campaign against Lanson culminated on 25 May 1927. Charles\n\nLindbergh was on tour in Europe, following his trans-Atlantic flight.\n\nSartre and other students informed the media that Lindbergh was to visit\n\nthe Ecole Normale Supérieure. The students then arranged a look-alike\n\nto dash into the buildings with a circle of escorts in the morning, while\n\nthe media followed. The stunt drew attention throughout Paris — and\n\nLanson was forced to resign for not having better control of the ENS “normaliens.”\n\nMinor rebellion might make one’s life interesting, but the French student\n\npopulation drifted towards political action. Satre’s classmates, including\n\nhis best friend Paul-Yves Nizan, joined left-leaning political organizations.\n\nNizan joined the French Communist Party, a move Sartre described as “totally\n\ngrotesque.” Sartre himself was not willing to be called a socialist\n\nor communist. He preferred to remain independent — and self-absorbed.\n\nSartre’s self-imposed ignorance of most leftist activities and beliefs\n\nwas aided by the anti-Marx and Hegel rhetoric of his instructors. Curiously,\n\nHegel was not even among the course reading lists.\n\nEventually, politics came home… Sartre faced conscription into the\n\nFrench military. His response was to write anti-military columns in the\n\nstudent newspaper. Sartre was shortly called before the ENS disciplinary\n\ncouncil. In November 1928, Sartre joined 82 other students in signing\n\na petition against military training.\n\nSimone de Beauvoir\n\nIn 1928, Jean-Paul placed last — fiftieth — in his\n\nclass at the Sorbonne on his agrégation, a form of exit exam. The topic\n\nof Sartre’s paper had been Nietzsche’s writings and “contingency.”\n\nFailing was difficult for Sartre, who considered himself quite smart.\n\nHowever, this setback might be the most important event in his life.\n\nForced to wait for another examination, Sartre met Simone\n\nde Beauvoir. Easily his intellectual match, Simone offered Sartre emotional and professional companionship throughout his life. For the next agrégation the two studied together. Sartre placed first on the exam this time, and de Beauvoir placed second. In many ways, this is how they are remembered: together one right after the other.\n\nIt is clear Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre were deeply in love,\n\nthough in the most unconventional of relationships. They were never exclusive,\n\nboth having other lovers at different times in their lives. The pair\n\nnever lived together and marriage was certainly out of the question for\n\nboth — it represented society’s view of relationships. According to\n\nmany sources, they addressed each other formerly, as colleagues more\n\nthan romantic lovers. Maybe they both feared expressing their love would\n\nbe perceived as a weakness… we may never know.\n\nFor 18 months, beginning in 1929, Sartre served in the French military.\n\nAfter his discharge from the military, Sartre took a position at a lycée\n\nin Le Havre, in northwest France. As Simone was teaching at Marseilles,\n\nlocated in the south, the two frequently met between the two cities —\n\nusually in Paris. One night in Paris, Raymond Aron was drinking with\n\nthe couple when he mentioned phenomenology. Aron used a beer mug to illustrate\n\nphenomenology, discussing the mug’s properties and essence. Sartre was\n\nintrigued, so he began to read about this school of philosophy.\n\nJean-Paul went to Berlin in 1933 to study the lectures of Edmund Husserl. After a year, Sartre returned to teaching with new enthusiasm.\n\nSartre experimented with mescaline in February 1935. As a result, he\n\nsuffered hallucinations for the next year.\n\nThe novel Nausea was published in 1938. Sartre included a phenomenological analysis of a glass of beer in the novel, as a tribute to Raymond Aron.\n\nThe War Years\n\nAt the start of World War II, Sartre was conscripted\n\ninto the military once again. Sartre served in the meteorological service,\n\nlaunching weather balloons. Unfortunately, Sartre was captured on 21\n\nJune 1940.\n\nWhile in the stalag, Sartre spend much of his time writing what was\n\nto become Being and Nothingness. According to one biographer, Sartre neglected himself while imprisoned, washing rarely, failing to shave, and developing a reputation for being rather foul. Sartre escaped in March 1941. He managed to return to Paris and somehow returned to his teaching post.\n\nIn June 1943, Sartre’s anti-Nazi play The Flies opened at a Paris theatre. Despite the play’s lack of subtlety, even uniformed German soldiers attended the production. The play closed after 40 performances, but left quite an impression among the artistic community of Paris. By 1945, at the end of World War II, Sartre found himself famous — and “existentialism” was the philosophy to study. Sartre spread his idea through his editorship of the magazine, Les\n\nTemps Modernes. The publication was named for the Charlie Chaplin film Modern Times, considered a masterpiece by many.\n\nPolitics and (or?) Philosophy\n\nCuriously, as existentialism grew in popularity — to\n\nthe point of becoming a pop-culture term — Sartre slowly left\n\nthe philosophy that had brought him fame. Sartre claimed a “conversion” to Marxism. In part, Sartre’s move to the political left resulted from the influence of Maurice Merleau-Ponty. As the Cold War developed, Sartre came to support the Soviet Union. Eventually, his support of Soviet Communism cost Sartre his friendship with Albert\n\nCamus.\n\nSartre published his defense of Marxism, The Critique of Dialectical\n\nReason, in 1960. The work was meant to be two volumes, but the second was abandoned by Sartre before completion. This unfinished work was published after Sartre’s death. In The Critique, Sartre tried to defend “pure” Marxism as respecting individual freedoms. Unfortunately for Sartre, most people saw Marxism as it existed in the Soviet Union — anything but a system respecting freedom.\n\nIn 1964, Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. He refused\n\nto accept the award on “political” grounds.\n\nParis university students rebelled in 1968, calling for various reforms.\n\nSartre’s support of the students caused him problems with both the left\n\nand the right in France. The right-leaning supporters of President de\n\nGaulle thought Sartre contributed to the protests. The French Communist\n\nParty did not support the students, thinking their demands for liberalized\n\neducation unreasonable. Both the left and right in France considered\n\nthe universities fine as they were.\n\nFrom 1968 until his death, Sartre embodied the left, socially and politically.\n\nHe stopped wearing suits and ties, protested the Vietnam War, and found\n\na new following in student “radicals” in both Europe and America.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Jean-Paul Sartre’s body began to rebel. He smoked\n\ntwo packs of cigarettes a day, drank heavily, and used amphetamines while\n\nwriting. For all this talk about logic and individual will, Sartre could\n\nnot stop his bad habits.\n\nThe Exit\n\nOn 15 April 1980, Sartre died. Simone de Beauvoir attempted\n\nto spend the night next to his body, but hospital employees removed her\n\nfrom his bed. She had loved him since they met to study for the agrégation.\n\nSartre’s popularity might have diminished by the end of his life, but\n\nhis death brought forth the kind of emotional displays normally reserved\n\nfor great political leaders. Of course, a political leader is what Sartre\n\nwas in many ways. More than 50,000 people lined the streets of Paris\n\nfor Sartre’s funeral procession on 19 April 1980. Sartre’s ashes were\n\nburied at the Montparnasse Cemetery. Later, Simone de Beauvoir’s ashes\n\nwere buried next to his.\n\nChronology\n\n1905 June 21 Born to Jean-Baptiste Sartre and Anne-Marie (Schweitzer) Sartre. 1905 October 20 The General Strike of Russia, leading to the formation of the first\n\nSoviet in St. Petersburg. 1906 November 17 Jean-Baptiste dies. 1907 Sartre and Anne-Marie move in with her parents: Karl “Charles” Schweitzer,\n\nnoted writer and music historian, and Louise.

Sartre’s philosophical\n\nposition evolved, along with his politics. Any attempt to place Sartre’s\n\nworks in context is likely to fail in the limited space available, due\n\nto his complex nature. Further complicating matters, Sartre, like most\n\nphilosophers, developed his own lexicon. While Sartre might use the same\n\nterms as another writer, he often intended a unique definition. The most\n\nimportant term promoted by Sartre was “existentialism,” a term\n\nborrowed from Karl Jaspers.\n\nWalter Kaufmann recognized Sartre’s occasional lack of clarity, stating\n\nthat “at times he is misled by words and writes what is no longer\n\nmeaningful.” Maybe Sartre tried too hard to express his views in\n\nsome instances, in part due to an enthusiasm for philosophical debate.\n\nBeing misled is one matter. Misleading others is quite different. It\n\nis important to understand that Sartre alternately valued intentions,\n\nactions, and results; at least in his writings and lectures. Evidence\n\nexists, however, demonstrating a personal profound lack of respect for\n\nintentions and, at times, even the truth. Sartre found nothing wrong\n\nin lying or intentionally misrepresenting the theories of others. Among\n\nthe victims of Sartre’s willingness to avoid facts were Martin\n\nHeidegger, Karl Jaspers, and other philosophers. Sartre stated Jaspers was a Catholic, which he wasn’t, and that Heidegger was an existential atheist, which Heidegger denied in a series of angry letters. Sartre wanted so much to solidify his own positions, that truth was sometimes sacrificed.\n\nIf he was not always honest, it was partly because honesty was a luxury\n\nhe could not afford.\n\n– Sartre; Hayman, p. 13\n\nWhy was, and is, Sartre influential? As biographer Ronald Hayman explains,\n\nit was not due to the quality of his literary works, even though Sartre\n\nis usually considered a “writer” by most scholars.\n\nAs a playwright Sartre was highly successful but less innovative and\n\nless significant than Beckett or Ionesco. As a novelist Sartre completed\n\nonly one work, Nausea, his other three novels being parts of an unfinished tetralogy. The bulk of his writing time was devoted to political journalism and biography, but he can hardly be called a journalist, while his biographies of Baudelaire, Genet, and Flaubert are not biographies in the usual sense of the term…. he had to earn his living as a schoolteacher until 1944, when he was almost forty.\n\n– Sartre; Hayman, p. 16\n\nSartre’s fame and influence are the result of self-promotion. He was\n\na celebrity, especially in France.\n\nThe Core of Sartre’s Existentialism\n\nTrying to define the core of Jean-Paul Sartre’s existentialism\n\nis beyond my abilities. Instead, I have chosen to rely upon the efforts\n\nof others. As previously mentioned, I place the confusion concerning\n\nSartre’s works at the philosopher’s own feet — I could easily tangle\n\nhis various definitions of “existentialism” into an incoherent\n\nmass of words. Still, Sartre popularized the term. Sartre’s influence\n\nupon the school of philosophy broadly known as “existentialism” has\n\nbeen summarized by professor Walter Kaufmann as follows:\n\nIt is mainly through the work of Jean-Paul Sartre that existentialism\n\nhas come to the attention of a wide international audience. Even Heidegger‘s great prestige in Germany after the second World War is due, in no small part, to his tremendous impact on French Thought. Nevertheless, Sartre is widely considered a mere littérateur, and in the nineteen hundred and fifties is has become much more fashionable to criticize him, or rather dismiss him, than to take him seriously, let alone praise him. Oddly, it is widely argued against him that he is in some way strikingly unacademic, as it academic existentialism were not a contradiction in terms.\n\n– Existentialism; Kaufmann, p. 40\n\nWhat often troubles academic audiences is that Sartre defined existentialism\n\nin a simplistic manner. One must question if something must be complex\n\nto be accepted by this audience. However, the over-simplification of\n\nSartre’s own philosophical system is often apparent:\n\nExistentialism maintains that in man, and in man alone, existence\n\npreceded essence.\n\nThis simply means that man first is, and only subsequently is this\n\nor that. In a word, man must create his own essence: it is in throwing\n\nhimself into the world, suffering there, struggling there, that he\n\ngradually defines himself. And the definition always remains open ended:\n\nwe cannot say what this man is before he dies, or what mankind is before\n\nit has disappeared.\n\n– From “A propos de l’existentialisme: Mise\n\nau point,” Action Magazine, December 29, 1944\n\nMany people wrongly quote “existence precedes essence” as\n\nif that summarizes existentialism. Sartre was merely stating that man,\n\nas the only sentient being on earth, was forced to define who he was\n\nthrough living, while objects are what they are until destroyed. With\n\nour ability to think, grow, and change, mankind is in the unique position\n\nof defining itself. We are each in charge of defining our own lives.\n\nIn a certain sense, Sartre’s definition of existentialism simply radicalizes\n\na view that is very common among most social scientists: that there\n\nare no instincts that cause specific actions.\n\nThere are always alternatives to anything that counts as human action.\n\nFor Sartre, this is always true, even when we feel that there are no alternatives.\n\n– Sartre for Beginners; Palmer, p. 26\n\nIn today’s world of “New Age” beliefs and enthusiasm for Eastern\n\nphilosophies, it is interesting that in 1956 Kaufmann compared Sartre’s\n\nexistentialism to the teachings of the Buddha. Not that the two personalities\n\nare alike, Kaufmann carefully noted. Sartre was never at peace; he challenged\n\nanything and thought an existentialist must pursue life. The Buddha’s\n\nteachings are more disposed toward accepting life and adapting to it.\n\nNevertheless, the Buddha, too, opposed any reliance on the divine\n\nbecause he wanted men to realize their complete responsibility. His\n\nfinal, and perhaps most characteristic, words, according to tradition\n\nwere: “Work out your own salvation with diligence.” And if\n\nthe diligence is rather uncharacteristic of the existentialists, the\n\nBuddha’s still more radical dictum with which the Dhammapada opens\n\nis nothing less than the quintessence of Sartre’s thought: “All\n\nthat we are is the result of what we have thought.”\n\nFew words in world literature equal the impact of this saying. All\n\nman’s alibis are unacceptable: no gods are responsible for his condition;\n\nno original sin; no heredity and no environment….\n\n– Existentialism; Kaufmann, p. 46\n\nIf you can think, you have free will. Sartre viewed this as the human\n\ncondition. While concerned primarily with human beings — or at least\n\nsentient beings — Sartre’s existentialism does address other creatures\n\nand objects. It is obvious that to understand humans one must first understand\n\nother objects. Sartre’s study of the universe grew from the phenomenology\n\nof Edmund Husserl. Take Sartre’s notion that “in man, and in man alone” there is first the body, then an essence is defined through actions. Now, reverse this for all other objects and Sartre’s view of the universe is clear: essence precedes existence for all objects; they have meaning then form.\n\nPolitical Confusion\n\nJean-Paul Sartre’s political views and activities present, at best,\n\nthe philosopher’s lack of consistency.\n\nx\n\nSartre’s sympathies were always with the left, but after making his\n\nphilosophical debut as an impassioned advocate of individual freedom,\n\ndenouncing Marxism as deterministic and Communist party as undemocratic,\n\nhe aligned himself with Marxism and relegated Existentialism to being\n\na mere “ideology.” Marxism, he declared, was the only valid\n\nphilosophy for our time. But in the seventies he announced that he\n\nwas no longer a Marxist.\n\nInstead of reducing his importance, these inconsistencies enhance\n\nit. Better than any of his contemporaries, he incarnates the dilemma\n\nof the intellectual torn between creativity and commitment, unable\n\nto concentrate on literature or philosophy when to campaign against\n\noppression and injustice might possibly alleviate suffering.\n\n– Sartre; Hayman, p. 10-11\n\nx\n\nProfessor Walter Kaufmann wrote of Sartre’s Marxism in 1956:\n\nSartre, back from the war, fought in the resistance. That is often\n\nforgotten today. But what is not forgotten is his more recent decision\n\nto make common cause with the Communist Party in France. In the United\n\nStates, this is held against him more than anything else. His decision\n\nis utterly quixotic. Unlike Heidegger in 1933, Sartre derives no advantage from it whatsoever. Moreover, he himself insists that he is not a Communist, that he cannot accept the doctrines of the party, and he knows that his head would soon fall if they should come to power. It is his impassioned opposition to the status\n\nquo and his conviction that the Communists, but not the socialists, are serious about overthrowing it that leads him to believe he must for the present make a common front with them. Unconsciously he reminds us of a lesson we learnt from the Greeks, from Plato in particular: that philosophical profundity and political sense do not always go together; on the contrary.\n\n– Existentialism; Kaufmann, p. 48\n\nx\n\nDuring the Cold War his knowledge of social injustice in the United\n\nStates combined with his ignorance of social injustice in the Soviet\n\nUnion (a country he had not yet visited) to make him more anti-American\n\nthan most of his non-Communist contemporaries. He believed that nothing\n\nwas more important than stopping Europe from aligning itself with the\n\nUnited States against the Communist bloc….\n\n– Sartre; Hayman, p. 11\n\nx\n\nSartre’s Lexicon\n\nI have added to the existential\n\nlexicon based upon one appearing in Sartre for Beginners. I have expanded upon some terms, as best I can in limited space.\n\nThe States of Being, In General\n\nSartre’s discussions of the “States of Being” are,\n\nat best, tangles of thought. It is easy for a student to feel lost among\n\nthe words.\n\nThe pity of it is that Sartre clothes his analysis in spurious dialectic:\n\nhe speaks of “the nothing” like Heidegger, takes “in-itself” and “for-itself” from Hegel, and above all plays on the word “being” in a way that veils his meaning from most readers, while the few who recognize his systematic confusion of “am” and “am nothing but” are apt to feel that this invalidates his while analysis — which it does not.\n\n– Existentialism; Kaufmann, p. 43\n\nBeing-in-Itself\n\nSartre applied the French “en-soi,” which loosely\n\nmeans “in-self,” to describe the state of being of objects\n\n— things without self-awareness. Sartre’s “Being-in-Itself” represents the idea that only concrete phenomena have any ontological status; only the concrete is real. Edmund Husserl‘s approach to phenomenology was embraced by Sartre as a basis for existential exploration. To simplify this concept, Sartre might state that a rock is a rock — it cannot change what it is. In this manner, Sartre suggests there is facticity, or truth, in the existence of some objects.\n\nBeing-for-Itself\n\nIn contrast to “Being-in-Itself” is Sartre’s “Being-for-Itself” — a state of self-awareness and control. Walter Kaufmann explains the differences thusly:\n\nThe pour-soi (for-itself) is that being which is aware of itself: man. Its structure is different from that of the en-soi, and the phenomenon of self-deception serves the author as a clue: what must the pour-soi be like in order to make self-deception possible?\n\n– Existentialism; Kaufmann, p. 43\n\nSartre’s “Being-for-Itself” describes human consciousness as possessing the characteristics of incompleteness and potency, with an indeterminate structure. The absence of a Creator leaves man without a predefined nature. Without a nature, individuals are nothingness. In effect, the essence of man is a complete lack of everything. Nothingness, Sartre thought, was freedom and free will. Applying this definition of nothingness to individuals, mankind is freedom. Sartre contended that not only was the individual free, but the essence of mankind was\n\nfreedom. As a result of this freedom, individuals are responsible for all their actions and thoughts.\n\nWhat makes self-deception possible, according to Sartre, is that the pour-soi differs from the en-soi or, to be concrete: a man is not a homosexual, a waiter, or a coward in the same way in which he is six feet tall or blond…. If I am six feet tall, that is that. It is a fact no less than that the table is, say, two feet high. Being a coward or a waiter, however, is different: it depends on ever new decisions.\n\n– Existentialism; Kaufmann, p. 44\n\nWhat Sartre always wanted his audience to understand was that he believed\n\nwe always have the ability to choose a new role, a new state of being.\n\nToday, one might be a philosopher, while tomorrow that same person might\n\nwait tables. In fact, humans can be and are more than one thing at a\n\ngiven moment. According to Sartre it becomes nearly impossible to describe\n\na person. “He is what he is,” might be the best description\n\nof anyone.\n\nMany of the works by Sartre address a dualism between subject and object,\n\nthe subjective consciousness and the objective human being. Sartre considered\n\nfreedom a subjective experience. Being and Nothingness explores this dualism: “Being” is the thing-in-itself, similar to the Hegelian Absolute, and “Nothingness” refers to freedom. Sartre wrote that freedom is the ability to define and assign meaning to things and events. Without thought, we could not be free. As an example, the play No Exit is about the results of how we define ourselves — especially those who fail to seize the freedom to define themselves.\n\nAccording to Sartre, we could not exceed the limits of our experiences;\n\nwe remain within the phenomenological limits of experience. Though he\n\naccepted Husserl’s approach to study, Sartre rejected Husserlian Idealism,\n\nconsidering the concept of a transcendental ego solipsism — only the\n\nself is real. Sartre was a critic of this school of thought, preferring\n\nthe idea being consists of more than consciousness, yet is at the same\n\ntime fixed in a reality.\n\nLogical Atheism\n\nStarting with the theory than man is inherently nothingness\n\nor free will, Sartre developed what he considered was a logical argument\n\nfor atheism. In the absence of a Creator, individuals feel abandoned,\n\nwith a sense of anger at the universe. Anger and despair lead to a tendency\n\nto embrace “Bad Faith.” Bad Faith represents a self-deception in which the person views self as an object, not as a person with free will. As an object, a person is without responsibility. Religion, according to Sartre, was a form of bad faith, teaching that previous humans, namely Adam and Eve, were responsible for human frailty. The unconscious is also a form of bad faith, allowing people to deny their thoughts.\n\nSartre went so far as to deny the existence of an unconscious thought\n\nprocess, claiming that people must be making a conscious decision in\n\norder to repress specific memories. Dreams and mental disorders represent\n\nconscious thoughts and ideas; it is a lie to claim one cannot remember\n\nthem or they are not controllable.\n\nSartre’s Morality\n\nSartre based his existentialism on human free will. As\n\nindividuals are free, from the moment of conception, they define their\n\nessence throughout their existence. A person’s nature is what he or she\n\nhas done in the past and what that person is doing at the moment. No\n\none is complete until death, when self-definition ceases. Then, how others\n\ninterpret the individual is based upon the individual’s accomplishments\n\nand failings.\n\nExistential morality arises from the fact that all choices affect others,\n\nphysically and emotionally. Social responsibility results from the interdependencies\n\nof individuals. Since any living person is engaged in the process of\n\ndefining self and others, ethics develop accordingly. Since the existentialist\n\nvalues free will and wants others to respect his or her freedom, the\n\nethical system developed is based upon free expression.\n\nThe Futile Attempt to Become God\n\nA major problem for Sartre was the lack of purpose to\n\nhuman existence. As a result, he developed the theory of “Being\n\nof God” — the idea that individuals seek to be like or as the mythical God. Sartre wrote:\n\nTo be man means to reach toward being God. Or if you prefer, man fundamentally\n\nis the desire to be God…. Every human reality is a passion in that\n\nit projects losing itself so as to found being and by the same stroke\n\nto constitute the In-Itself which escapes contingency by being its\n\nown foundation, the “Ens causa sui,” which religions call\n\nGod.\n\nThe Transcendence of the Ego (La Trascendance de\n\nl’Ego, 1937)\n\nA short work, Transcendence is a phenomenological study of the human consciousness. This work marked Sartre’s break from the teachings of Edmund Husserl.\n\nx\n\nNausea (La Nausée, 1938)\n\nThe novel Nausea is an experimental work, with no real hero, only a main character, Roquentin, who spends the novel trying to understand existence and essence.\n\nRoquentin, sitting in a trolley car and staring out the window, suddenly\n\nis unable to place items in context — at least the context humans understand.\n\nIt begins as a familiar illusion: the buildings outside seem to be moving\n\ninstead of the trolley. All movement, all objects, become relative to\n\nRoquentin. As he ponders the illusion, he rests his hand on the seat,\n\nbut realizes he cannot feel a “seat” but nothing with which\n\nhe is familiar. The seat is no longer a seat because he cannot clearly\n\nassociate the word “seat” with its function. Is Roquentin hallucinating?\n\nIs he suffering a mental collapse? Or has he experienced a major breakthrough?\n\nIt’s a seat…. But the word stays on my lips: it refuses to go and\n\nput itself on the thing. Things are divorced from their names…. I\n\nam in the midst of things, nameless things. Alone, without words, defenseless,\n\nthey surround me, are beneath me, behind me, above me.\n\nAccording to Walter Kaufmann, the novel is Sartre’s exploration of his\n\nown philosophical journey.\n\nIn 1938 he lays down his experience of the thirties in La Nausée. No reader can fail to notice that it is his own experience, not mere cerebration.\n\n– Existentialism; Kaufmann, p. 40\n\nNausea cemented Sartre’s position as a leading French thinker.\n\nx\n\nBeing and Nothingness (L’Etre el le Néant, 1943)\n\nx\n\nToward the end of L’être et le néant Sartre argues that it is man’s basic wish to fuse his openness and freedom with the impermeability of things, to achieve a state of being in which the en-soi and pour-soi are synthesized. This ideal, says Sartre, one can call God, and “man is the being who wants to be God.” The chapter ends: “But the idea of God is contradictory… man is a useless passion.”\n\n– Existentialism; Kaufmann, p. 47\n\nx\n\nThe Flies (Les Mouches, 1943)\n\nx\n\nNo Exit (Huis Clos, 1944)\n\nx\n\nThe Age of Reason (L’Age de raison, 1945)\n\nx\n\nExistentialism and Human Emotions (L’Existentialisme\n\nest un humanisme, 1946)\n\nAlso known as Existentialism, this work is the text to a lecture delivered by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1946. It contains several factual errors, misrepresentations, and is less than perfect. However, the work is often considered a definitive statement on the nature of existentialism. To be fair, professor Walter Kaufmann and many since have recognized the work as important, but “not the alpha and omega of existentialism.”\n\nIn the English-speaking world, Sartre’s lecture on Existentialism is probably his best known work. This is rather unfortunate because it is after all only an occasional lecture which, though brilliant and vivid in places and unquestionably worthy of attention, bears the stamp of the moment. It contains unnecessary misstatements of fact as well as careless and untenable arguments and a definition of existentialism which has been repudiated by Jaspers and Heidegger, and ought to be repudiated by Sartre, too, because it is no less unfair to his own thought.\n\n– Existentialism; Kaufmann, p. 45\n\nx\n\nAnti-Semite and Jew (Réflections sur la question\n\njuive, 1946)\n\nx\n\nHere Sartre tries to show that a man is not an antisemite the way\n\nhe is blond: he chooses to be an antisemite, says Sartre, because he\n\nis afraid of freedom, openness, and change and longs to be as solid\n\nas a thing. He want an identity, he wants to be something in the manner\n\nin which a table is something, or a rock. At the outset, perhaps, he\n\nplays at being an antisemite; but when it has become second nature,\n\nthe man has achieved nothing less than an escape from freedom: he has\n\nabdicated his humanity.\n\n– Existentialism; Kaufmann, p. 44\n\nx\n\nThe Critique of Dialectical Reason (1960)\n\nx\n\nIn a way, this is the epitaph of existentialism. Jaspers and Heidegger\n\nhad sought to dissociate themselves from existentialism as soon as\n\nSartre made it world famous after World War II. This is not the place\n\nto discuss Sartre’s Marxism, which is at least as eccentric as Kierkegaard’s\n\nChristianity. But he no longer writes under the banner of existentialism;\n\nnor does any other major figure. In a sense, then, “Marxism and\n\nExistentialism” marks the end of existentialism.\n\n– Existentialism; Kaufmann, p. 281\n\nQuotes\n\nTranscendence of the Ego\n\nPerhaps the essential role of the ego is to mask from consciousness its\n\nvery spontaneity. Transcendence of Ego, p. 100 (1957 translation)\n\nNausea\n\nThings are divorced from their names. I am in the midst of things, nameless\n\nthings. Alone, without words, defenseless, they surround me, are beneath\n\nme, behind me, above me. Nausea, p. 125 (1964 translation)\n\nThe roots of the chestnut tree were sunk in the ground just under my bench\n\n— I couldn’t remember it was a root anymore. The words had vanished and\n\nwith them the significance of things, their methods of use, and the feeble\n\npoints of reference which men have traced on their surface…. Never, until\n\nthese last few days, had I understood the meaning of “existence.” Nausea, p. 126 – 127\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, there it was, clear as day: existence had suddenly\n\nunveiled itself. It had lost the harmless look of an abstract category:\n\nit was the very paste of things… the diversity of things, their individuality,\n\nwas only an appearance, a venerr. This veneer had melted, leaving soft,\n\nmonstrous masses all in disorder — naked, in a frightful, obscene nakedness. Nausea, p. 127\n\nThe word “absurdity” is coming to life under my pen; a little\n\nwhile ago in the garden, I couldn’t find it, but neither was I looking\n\nfor it, I didn’t need it: I thought without words, on things, with things….\n\nIn fact, all that I could grasp beyond that returns to this fundamental\n\nabsurdity. Absurdity: another word. I struggle against words; down there\n\nI touched the thing. Nausea, p.129\n\nBeing and Nothingness\n\nAll human actions are equivalent… and… all are on principle doomed\n\nto failure. Being and Nothingness, “Conclusion, sct. 2” (1943)\n\nI am responsible for everything… except for my very responsibility,\n\nfor I am not the foundation of my being. Therefore everything takes place\n\nas if I were compelled to be responsible. I am abandoned in the world…\n\nin the sense that I find myself suddenly alone and without help, engaged\n\nin a world for which I bear the whole responsibility without being able,\n\nwhatever I do, to tear myself away from this responsibility for an instant. Being\n\nand Nothingness, “Being and Doing: Freedom,” sct. 3 (1943)\n\nGenerosity is nothing else than a craze to possess. All which I abandon,\n\nall which I give, I enjoy in a higher manner through the fact that I give\n\nit away…. To give is to enjoy possessively the object which one gives. Being\n\nand Nothingness, “Doing and Having,” sct. 2 (1943)\n\nMan is a useless passion. Being and Nothingness, “Doing and Having,” sct. 3 (1943)\n\nTo eat is to appropriate by destruction. Being and Nothingness, “Doing and Having,” sct. 3 (1943)\n\nExistentialism and Human Emotions\n\nTo choose this or that is to affirm at the same time the value of what\n\nwe choose, because we can never choose evil. We always choose the good,\n\nand nothing can be good for us without being good for all. Existentialism\n\nand Human Emotions, p. 17 (1977 translation)\n\nOur responsibility is much greater than we might have supposed, because\n\nit involves all mankind. Existentialism and Human Emotions, p. 17\n\nOther\n\nAt the root of humanity I see only sadness and boredom.\n\nFascism is not defined by the number of its victims, but by the way it\n\nkills them. “On the Execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg,” in Libération (22 June 1953)\n\nHell is other people. No Exit, Garcin, in scene 5.\n\nOne is still what one is going to cease to be and already what one is\n\ngoing to become. One lives one’s death, one dies one’s life. Saint\n\nGenet: Actor and Martyr, book 2, “The Melodious Child Dead in Me…” (1952)\n\nWhat then did you expect when you unbound the gag that muted those black\n\nmouths? That they would chant your praises? Did you think that when those\n\nheads that our fathers had forcibly bowed down to the ground were raised\n\nagain, you would find adoration in their eyes? (1948)\n\nIf literature isn’t everything, it’s not worth a single hour of someone’s\n\ntrouble. (1960)\n\nEvery age has its own poetry; in every age the circumstances of history\n\nchoose a nation, a race, a class to take up the torch by creating situations\n\nthat can be expressed or transcended only through poetry.
