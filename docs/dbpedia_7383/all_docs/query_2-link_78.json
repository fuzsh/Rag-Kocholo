        "meta_description": "Jean-Paul Sartre is often portrayed as a philosopher whose ethics would inevitably have subjectivist or relativist outcomes. Yet, even in Sartre’s early works there are several stances that blatantly belie this image, relying rather on an objectivist conception of value that he notably draws from Max Scheler. The aim of this paper is thus to investigate the influence of Scheler’s moral reflection on Sartre, arguing how it can represent an original and fruitful starting point to approach Sartrean ethics. To this aim, we will first report on and discuss some passages from Sartre’s early works where this debt is most noticeable. Then, we will provide an overview of the Schelerean legacy, arguing how it represents for Sartre the very opening of the ethical issue addressable in phenomenological terms, avoiding the dead end of Hume’s and Kant’s more classical positions, while at the same time being consistent with other peculiar themes of Sartrean philosophy, namely existence and historicity.",

        "text": "2. “Reading Scheler made me understand that there existed values…”\n\nreading Scheler made me understand that there existed values. Basically, until then, quite absorbed by the metaphysical doctrine of salvation, I’d never really understood the specific problem of morality. The “ought-to-be” seemed to me to be represented by the categorical imperative; and since I rejected the latter, it seemed to me that I rejected the former with it. But when I’d understood that there existed specific natures, equipped with an existence as of right, and called values; when I’d understood that these values, whether proclaimed or not, regulated each of my acts and judgements, and that by their nature they “ought to be”: then the problem became enormously more complex (p. 88).\n\n4These few but extremely meaningful lines clearly indicate in what specific sense the encounter with Scheler represented for Sartre a veritable turning point. In fact, as he himself admits, Sartre was previously inclined to understand the issue of morality as phenomenologically pointless. Adhering rather confidently to Hume’s law and, at the same time, identifying the normative sphere (i.e., what “ought to be”) with the Kantian categorical imperative, he believed that rooting morality in “being-in-itself” (to use the lexicon of BN) was impossible or, worse, specious. Starting from these premises, the only remaining room for ethics would be the rhetorical one, where purely verbal formulations such as “ought”, “must” or “shall” would be imposed on experiences in themselves autonomous from the morale sphere. In short, the idea underlying this argument is that there is no such thing as moral experience and, consequently, it would be neither reasonable nor possible to develop a phenomenology of morality.\n\n5To the dead end represented by these two positions, which for Sartre at first constitute (rather naively) the only alternatives in ethics, it is precisely Scheler’s proposal that allows for an alternative path to be found. And this path, on closer inspection, represents for Sartre the very opening of morality as a problem that can be addressed in phenomenological terms, insofar as, just as “every kind of cognition is rooted in experience”, then “ethics, too, must have its foundation in ‘experience’” (Scheler 1973, p. 166). The issue with which Sartre is thus confronted is none other than the central thesis of Scheler’s material axiology, namely that “there are authentic and true value-qualities [Wertqualitäten] and that they constitute a special domain of objectivities, have their own distinct relations and correlations” (ibid., p. 15). It is then worth considering some passages from Sartre’s work in which, somewhat unexpectedly, this perspective is effectively put to the test.\n\n2.1. Moral qualities in Sartre’s early works\n\n6In The Transcendence of the Ego, published in 1936, Sartre (2004a) already gives evidence of this when he writes:\n\nIt is just as if we lived in a world where objects, apart from their qualities of heat, odour, shape, etc., had those of repulsive, attractive, charming, useful, etc., and as if these qualities were forces that performed certain actions on us (p. 11).\n\n7Not only does Sartre take account here of so-called “secondary qualities”, such as smell or colour, but he even adds further, equally real and irreducible ones. It is extremely important to note from the outset how Sartre, in introducing this theme in passing, does not merely mention the existence of such qualities, but immediately relates them to the practical sphere: quite obviously, appearing repulsive leads one to move away, whereas looking attractive tends to bring one closer. Without dwelling too long on this point, which will be further addressed below, we would like to indicate even now how Sartre recognises in the above-mentioned qualities the capacity to motivate – and precisely in this resides their being moral qualities.\n\n8Only three years later, this same theme would be taken up again in the famous and dense article on Husserlian intentionality, where Sartre (2002) speaks as follows:\n\nSo it is that all at once hatred, love, fear, sympathy – all these famous “subjective” reactions which were floating in the malodorous brine of the mind – are pulled out. They are merely ways of discovering the world. It is things which abruptly unveil themselves to us as hateful, sympathetic, horrible, lovable. Being dreadful is a property of this Japanese mask, an inexhaustible and irreducible property which constitutes its very nature – and not the sum of our subjective reactions to a piece of sculptured wood (p. 383).\n\n9This time the focus seems rather to be placed on the passive character of the experience of moral qualities. The ironic reference to traditional mentalist conceptions of emotions and the term “subjective” put in quotation marks indicate Sartre’s effort to insist that, where moral qualities are given, they are encountered as being in themselves. In contrast to the prevailing interpretation of Sartre as a philosopher of the pure subjectivism of value, passages such as the one just quoted suggest his attention also to the “discovery” of worldly moral qualities independent of oneself.\n\n10This same aspect would then be reiterated in 1940, when in The Imaginary Sartre (2004b) emphasised the intentional component of emotional states, in effect suggesting that, if an emotion is experienced, it must necessarily take place in a worldly correlate, which is not the emotion itself. In the author’s words,\n\nthe feeling of hate is not consciousness of hate. It is consciousness of Paul as hateful; love is not, primarily, consciousness of itself: it is consciousness of the charms of the loved person. To become conscious of Paul as hateful, irritable, sympathetic, disturbing, attractive, repulsive, etc., is to confer on him a new quality, to constitute him along a new dimension (p. 69).\n\n2.2. Moral qualities in Sartre’s Being and Nothingness\n\n15Passages such as those just recalled allow us to underline at least two aspects. The first is that Sartre’s regard for the problem of moral qualities is not episodic or confined to places in BN devoted to values or the psychoanalysis of things. Rather, as we have just observed, this question permeates the author’s thought more transversally, crossing some of the most decisive reflections of the entire Sartrean philosophy. The second point is that through the discussion of moral qualities, Sartre seems to reveal his need to attribute a pre-judicative status to value. As Detmer (1988, pp. 135-6) sharply suggests, there would therefore be an important parallelism between the theme of nothingness and that of value. In fact, for Sartre the possibility of encountering nothingness in the world on the level of experience has the capital function, borrowed from Heidegger, of arguing its irreducibility to logic: it is not banally the adverb “not” that (surreptitiously) introduces nothingness in a linguistic act, but, on the contrary, it is only on the basis of the prelogical givenness of non-being that the particle “not” can in general make sense (Sartre, 1978, p. 6 ff.). Now, something similar seems to be said for the sphere of value. Experiencing specifically motivating moral qualities would thus not mean simply ushering in a new class of phenomena ex abrupto, but rather providing moral discourse with an experiential foundation. If this were not possible, moral judgements could be reduced to mere language-games, fictitiously introduced through modal verbs like “shall”, “must”, “should” or “ought”. The very fact that Sartre dealt with the moral problem throughout his life seems to us a living witness of his refusal to dismiss this issue so roughly.\n\n3. Scheler’s legacy: the experience of value\n\n16Having discussed the various passages quoted so far, we can finally try to summarize and fix more precisely Scheler’s theoretical contributions to Sartre.\n\n19Finally, and this is perhaps the most important legacy, Sartre inherits from Scheler the thesis that “value-facts [exist] as primordial phenomena that do not admit of any further explanation” (Scheler, 1973, p. 252). This means that morality does not need to be grounded in other levels, since it is in itself foundational: the phenomenon of value is something irreducible and with which we are originally acquainted, that is, we are originally “engaged in a world of values” (Sartre, 1978, p. 38).\n\n3.1. Out of the dead end: Sartre’s rejection of the positions of Kant and Hume\n\n20That values admit of no further explanation means, then, that any moral theory that does not start from them can only be derivative and artificial. This is the breaking point that Scheler’s legacy yields in Sartre with the dead ends of Kantian morality, on the one hand, and that of Hume, on the other.\n\n3.2. An ethics between history and existence\n\n24Sartre’s existentialism is characterized by the reference to the unsurpassable particularity of existence, although this trait is at times overstated. Therefore, in antithesis to the abstractness of ahistorical universalism, for Sartre (1992) “Ethics is an individual, subjective, and historical enterprise” (p. 7). Yet, is not Scheler’s material axiology, despite the legacy illustrated so far, openly at odds with this most fundamental instance of Sartre’s?\n\n25While surprising, rather the opposite is true. Several of Scheler’s passages testify, in fact, to his deep sensitivity to the themes of individual existence and history. As to this second aspect, for example, Scheler (1973) writes that the “variety of the types of moral ideals of life that we find in peoples and nations are by no means objections to the objectivity of moral values”; on the contrary,\n\nit is precisely because it belongs to the essence of extant values to be fully realized by only a variety of individuals and collective individuals and a variety of levels of concrete and historical development of these that the existence of these historical differences in morals is not an objection to the objectivity of moral values, but is on the contrary required by it (pp. 492-493).\n\n26Accordingly, the fact that values are encountered and known only at a given, i.e., finite, moment in time does not contradict their objectivity, as “the ‘historicity’ of their comprehension (and the cognition of their order of ranks and laws of preferring) is as essential to them as is the historicity of their realization or their realization in a possible ‘history’” (ibid. pp. 493-494). In this sense, the objectivity of a value does not consist in its necessarily existing, but in the fact that its validity cannot otherwise be recognized intersubjectively and intertemporally when it appears and when it does so to a transcendental subject. Whereby, “It is therefore also possible that certain moral value-qualities will be comprehended for the first time in history, and that they will appear first, for example, in the feeling insight of a single individual” (ibid, p. 272).\n\nEvery moment of life in the development of an individual represents at the same time a possibility for the individual to know unique values and their interconnections, and, in accordance with these, the necessitation of moral tasks and actions that can never be repeated (ibid., p. 493).\n\n28In this perspective, shared by both Sartre and Scheler, values thus turn out to be neither universal to the point of being acontextual, nor particular to the point of being unable to make any claim to intersubjective validity; neither natural and eternally existing, nor segregated in a uniquely particular epoch and unattainable outside of it. Scheler’s theory, then, seems to constitute the promise of a solution to Sartre’s concern for a truly concrete ethics, that is, one capable of accomplishing a “synthesis of the universal and the historical” (Sartre, 1992, p. 7).\n\n4. Conclusion\n\n29Needless to say, the framework we have tried to outline does not even remotely resolve the question of value in Sartre. Actually, it cannot be said to have exhausted even Scheler’s sole contribution to him, nor the overtly problematic aspects that emerge from this legacy.\n\n32In this perspective, indeed, not only is Sartre redeemed from the oversimplified portrait of a subjectivist philosopher with which too often he has been identified, but more importantly, are brought to light the complexity and rigor of his ethics, which takes its cue from a close confrontation with the debate of the time, especially in the phenomenological field. In this sense, we believe that the phenomenology of value derived from Scheler could be a fruitful starting point for re-reading Sartre in this direction, reassessing notions such as those of authenticity and bad faith with which his ethics has too often been considered to begin, but also to end."
