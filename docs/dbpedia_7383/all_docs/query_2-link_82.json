        "text": "1. Introduction to Jean-Paul Sartre and Existentialism\n\nJean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) was a prominent and politically active French philosopher with a prodigious output: at his death, he had written more than 45 volumes of varying lengths. He was also a novelist, an essayist, and a biographer. Victor Farias, in The Berlin Diaries, characterizes Sartre as the \"Great Master of Popular Philosophy,\" while the American critic Haim Gordon calls him \"the Third Force,\" after Freud and Einstein. Perhaps the best evidence of his impact lies in his immense modern popularity, both as a philosopher and a public figure. Sartre's thought, almost as soon as it began to coalesce, was embraced by and has continued to influence the student, socialist, and other political movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Sartrean existentialism has also provided a framework in which both Muslim and Roman Catholic revolutionary groups have thought and acted. One of Sartre's most telling points may be found in his detailed, faithful, but ultimately self-critical autobiography, The Words. There, the novelist exists as a pursuer of something. He is in pursuit of a future text yet to be written, using skills or virtuosity (Husserlian \"intention\"). His declaration of commitment is an arbitrary leap. Sartre sees art in general as offering a characteristic human situation which may be described in philosophical rather than chronological or psychological terms. Contrary to those philosophers who imagine the artist as taking refuge in pure formalism, rejecting society, and attempting pure, unmediated subjective expression, Sartre sees the artist as associating society and self in a work. The artist who does not see this is merely sentimental, retrograde. For one thing, Sartre asserts, one cannot write without a public, at least theoretically if not actually.\n\n2. Key Concepts of Sartrean Existentialism\n\nDespite existentialism's defense of a godless universe, committed action is inevitably tied to the recognition that there is \"no\" morally or intellectually correct or obvious course of human action. The irony of this nihilistic position is mostly demonstrated by the way young activists devoted themselves to battles they recognized on a higher level did not matter on the everyday sphere of real human life. Sartre has described the crucial phenomena of being by the concept of \"nothingness.\" For example, young people are more alive than old people, or lovers are in a pre-established harmony that, by animating the relationship, makes the woman unattractive and the man irresistible, or a person's attitude can define the ambiance of a room, or consensus is impossible because argument increases the antagonism, at least in a situation where the participants are convinced they are in the presence of an essential choice. At the same time, the human subject apprehends not only other objects and other persons but also himself, and it is not indifferent that this apprehension which man has of him is different from that he has of the thing. It is a fascinating truth. I know more about the woman I love at a distance than the person I kiss, whom I touch, and who is before me because I see her, strictly speaking, and sense her. She does not have the inalienable traits that define the other, and since others notice her, she notices herself. We act as a source of the subjective features in things that I touch and in which my glance can detect only objective qualities. Sartre is clear that morality requires the comprehension in which the plurality of each individual's interests and ends can be fulfilled. And it was in this sense that Sartre delighted in practicing truth because having the opportunity to speak and freedom to act was indissolubly linked to their value, or rather to the value they give themselves through their committals. There are definitely truths that one ought to hide, provided that this dissimulation supports a project or increases its efficaciousness, because truth, considering the transparency it proposes, since it constitutively cannot be anything other than a wish and a promise. However, the subject's status is considerate for Sartre as symptomatic of what must make them surpass the impossible neutrality that characterizes an individual's relationship to things: another person is my other, and since in desiring them I desire their full realization of that person, I give myself the law of their earthly existence and I make my finiteness in them an infinitude by making it the very revelation of a power. Each human being defines himself as what they act, as what they will be thought to be, and at the same time as what they will be, since the way that what they are not is the mirror held up to them by other subjects who, in experiencing them, precipitate them into a choice as untreated as the one that makes them themselves. These decisive considerations lead us to the means-end argument of Sartre's existential contribution.\n\n2.1. Existence Precedes Essence\n\nAccording to Sartre, humans simply are. We are more or less nothing. In our nothingness, we construct essence. Initially, there is no purpose we have or walk of life to which we may be directed. From each of these ways of being a human, the essence of humans, an essence called \"existence\" or \"the human condition,\" is drawn. Later, there will be an abundance of philosophical discussion. Then, education will always have a center from which to grow, but it will not be the center which provides the essence. The essence of the center is drawn from the abstraction of human existence. Each educator, a human, will exist before he will have any pedagogical methods and tools to exist within. The ground of which we are sure that it exists is the already existing human. His human reality is undeniable independent of any abstraction, including an abstraction about human essence. We are first projected, thrown, and conceived by philosophy. Our essence is our responsibility. Each emerging framework (human entity) conceived will be transparent between what it is and what it chooses to express. The authentic choices of both humans and emerging entities will be the ground from which essence of the center \"education\" will be drawn.\n\n2.2. Freedom and Responsibility\n\nFreedom occupies a central role in Sartre's thought. Since existence precedes essence, the human being is not determined and is free to make choices. There is no human nature except insofar as there is a common essence shared by all men, although Sartre's concept is not a universal nature but a collection of various characteristics shared by all (they may be physical, intellectual or moral). Thus, the essence of man is the ensemble of human activities, not the individual essence of every one of us. Morality is a matter of the individual; it is not useful to say sin, crime, treachery, or violation of generally recognized moral principles. Those are factual, but the fault is the individual's, not in the determination by any rule or supraindividual nature. The fact that I am free means that every one of my decisions is free. No matter what I do, I am free to undertake any action and it may be the action of a whole life. I can either give myself some clear existential aims, maintain a clear ethical attitude, preserve strict fidelity, let go myself in the first passion, or enter massively into the resistance. It is up to my decision to choose any of these possibilities. Responsible are the people who recognize the real existence and activity of the other involved in the common adventure all of us are into, as well as those who reckon the dignity of everybody else is as great and as inalienable as their own. And guilty are the people who, on the contrary, build their freedom on the contingency in others. Any original sin lies in a man setting himself up as an absolute. He who allows himself to be treated as a means degrades not only the abstract concept of nature but also himself as a specific human reality.\n\n2.3. Bad Faith\n\nThe negative expression \"bad faith\" appears to reflect upon Sartre some kind of moralistic attitude, taking him far away from an analysis of concrete human life. But this is not the case: Sartre opposes bad faith because bad faith is a way to hide to oneself the very nature of consciousness; and here, consciousness appears in its functions of freedom and choice. Bad faith marks a certain approach in regard to knowledge and truth. Sartre distinguished two kinds of \"bad faith\": the most glaring one is when the individual pretends to be not free, when in fact he is. The other kind of \"bad faith\" is connected with truth: the acting man does not want to know the truth about his situation, his projects, etc.; he lies to himself. Bad faith is not only a simple error, a lack of courage to act upon possibilities which were already present, a natural weakness given by insufficient education. It is also a sin because of the moral implications. It is true, Sartre declared bad faith to be a sort of original sin. But the sin of bad faith is connected, once again, with freedom: every human act or manner of behavior can be good or bad precisely because in a concrete situation man can choose his proper manner to be. The moral problem comes precisely from the freedom and responsibility of man. Every ethical judgment of the behavior of man is always connected with the exercise of freedom. And for Sartre, it is the opposite situation from that presented by traditionalist ethics. Morality does not flow from ontology; it does not determine what life's purposes could be. Rather, it is the free action that gives value to existential choices. Every possible action of the agent must be free. The moral values are promoted by an individual with total consciousness. Sartre proposed only the general formula of calculating values. The moral problems will be resolved in every concrete case by the free agent. Sartre thought that he exposed clearly and objectively his existentialist viewpoint on moral values.\n\n3. Sartre's Influence on Contemporary Thought\n\nThe impact of Sartre's philosophy has not only been on other philosophers. Neo-Nietzschean literary critics and psychoanalysts have found Sartre's thought to be an interesting addition to their disciplines. In both America and France, social scientists, theologians, and novelists find something of importance for their concerns in Sartre's work. One novel use of Sartre's thought came about in France in the late 1950s. A group of Sartre's followers used his work as a basis for a peculiar brand of existential Marxism. Later in France, this approach grew into a political movement punningly referred to as \"Sarterican\" in its relation to Sartre's ideas. With the publication of both the Notebooks for an Ethics and the Critique of Dialectical Reason, Sartre's influence extended to philosophers in the English-speaking world. In categorical terms, before these books, Sartre was pretty much dismissed by the more important of the British and American philosophical figures. However, the publication introduced established continental philosophy into the English-speaking philosophical world. It also had the effect of giving Sartre a broad readership within the universities who saw existentialism as part of contemporary thought rather than a finished product from a recent past. Many of this and subsequent generations of university students were therefore probably first introduced to philosophy by being assigned to read Sartre.\n\n4. Existentialism in Literature and Film\n\nFrom the start, the very diversity of the existential novelists has already implied the inapplicability of fixed literary concepts. No one quality makes them all existentialists, not even their questioning of existence, for much of their interest still lies in historical, psychological, political, or other human problems than can be readily analyzed from the preoccupations of a revolt or a technology, a Freud or a Marx. We can perhaps come closer to the existentialists by saying that during a given stage of their writing they share certain basic objectives: to depict someone's reaction to an unusual situation; to place under scrutiny the values and problems of the human order; to depend more on creating their characters confer of nothing instead of having already received their natures, objectives, and problems prior to the plot; to interpret reality according to their perception of it and not to an ideal plot; to protect their plots by abandoning the idea of free will; finally to rouse readers and shake them into learning the hard way. Especially in novels and theatre, existentialism deals with individuals reacting to a new situation. These individuals have no particular role except the one created totally within the act. None of their previous states of mind, centuries of tradition, mass hypnotic forces, or prolific series of staged events determine the roles or meaning. Although actually based on previously imported fundamentals of humanity, these figures perform an act of freewill. They can often be snared or shamed into this act, and then no more. Finally, in accomplishing this act, they are used as a means, even by Sartre, to comment directly or indirectly on the existence of life as experienced before, during, and after that real or symbolic action. It is readily understandable, therefore, that existentialism can very effectively concentrate on characters alienated from their real or their real possibilities.\n\n5. Conclusion and Future Directions\n\nIn conclusion, Jean-Paul Sartre’s philosophy, with its emphasis on the individual responsibility of each person to carve out a life, to maintain his or her freedom and rebel against things that confine or define his or her essence, has had a major impact on the social and political upheavals of the 1960s. The ideas and precepts of Marxist philosophy, any philosophy which tries to place responsibility for action and eventual change upon the masses of unorganized people, can easily lead to the totalitarian concept of the state, in which no decision-making power remains with the masses of unorganized people. For a theory such as existentialism, which places responsibility for change upon the individual, to come to the fore at the moment in history when it did is not only significant but also valid and long-lasting. The crisis upon which existentialism fastens is a global and definitive one; man is in crisis because there is a great deal of uncertainty about human values. Sartre, in the depth of the crisis in depression, announced his willingness to give up the philosophy of Being and to dedicate himself to life. I am sure that the deep philosophical insight of existentialism adds more influence teaching people to be consciously themselves after their own goals have been founded."
