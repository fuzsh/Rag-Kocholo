        "text": "The continent our leaders inherited was characterised by poor infrastructure, constructed to exploit the primary products and natural wealth, inadequate health facilities, few educational institutions and a large mass of unemployed people. Our leaders were confronted with a colonial economy; low-value commodities exported in exchange for imported high-value branded consumer goods. This type of economy could not lead to sustainable development.\n\nA united and stronger Africa would have negotiated a more meaningful sustainable development goals for Africa. A united Africa will be better able to negotiate business terms with both exploitative and authoritative capitalists, that will result in better value for our resources.\n\nWe have all the resources in Africa to produce what we need, and our institutions will be better able to coordinate who produces what. Our institutions will work to determine which of the different blocks in Africa have competitive advantage in certain areas and sectors and encourage and sustain these blocks.\n\nWhen visitors leave messages on the site we collect the data shown in the contact form, and also the visitorâ€™s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.\n\nAn anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it.
