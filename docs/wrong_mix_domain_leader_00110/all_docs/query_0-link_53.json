        "text": "A student’s journey through medical school is unlike any other experience. We understand choosing the right medical school can be a big decision and so do our alumni. Each of them remembers what it was like to be you. They understand your need for answers and want to share what they experienced during their time at Trinity and beyond. You can connect directly with an alum by completing this form or hear what they have to say in our Ask an Alum virtual web series.\n\nTrinity School of Medicine is here to help learners have the best possible experience. While each student has a unique journey, connecting with an alum can help you gain insight into what a medical student can expect from Trinity."
