Ardern is an Associate Dean of Research and Innovation in the Faculty of Health at York University (Toronto, Canada) and Associate Professor in the School of Kinesiology and Health Science. Chris’ primary interest is in the epidemiology of obesity and 24-hour movement behaviors (sleep, sedentary time, and physical activity) in relation to cardiometabolic risk, microvascular dysfunction, and dementia. Most recently, his work has focused on the health risks associated with weight stigma, and the use of risk algorithms and behavioral profiling for the identification of high-risk subgroups of the population. This work incorporates both social and physical determinants, drawing on large scale open data infrastructure, national surveys, and administrative healthcare data to conduct time-to-event and geospatial analyses, to move knowledge into action with collaborating healthcare groups. He holds a Research Scientist position at Southlake Regional Health Centre, is member of the York University Centre for Aging Research and Education (YU-CARE), and is active in obesity organizations at the local to national level.
