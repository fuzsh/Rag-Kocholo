        "text": "3\n\nBRITAIN AND AFRICA 1939–64: BASES AND BRIDGEHEADS\n\nTHE period of the Second World War marks the decisive watershed in the history of Britain’s relations with Africa. While the Great War had the deepest, long-term effect on the United Kingdom, it was involvement in a second continent-wide and world-wide war which led to the transformation of British Africa. Policies adopted towards and by British African territories exerted in time their profound influence on Britain’s metropolitan and colonial neighbours. It was above all the emphasis on self-government as the central objective of British colonial theory, coupled with new awareness of the meaning of democracy, which impelled or accelerated the change.\n\nThis emphasis on self-government was in no way primarily directed towards Africa. Majority opinion in the Western world in 1945 still accepted for that continent the pre-war assumptions of trusteeship and tutelage. But the urgent war-time visions of freedom, equality and democracy, together with those of welfare and development, led to an accentuation everywhere of the ideal of self-government or independence. Asia, notably India, and the lands recently under the Japanese, was conceived as legitimate first beneficiary of adulthood, Arabia being broadly included with Asia in this generalized conception.\n\nAfrica’s leaders, however, together with allies throughout the “Negro–African” world, were not content to allow the continuance of any hierarchical system of thought which assigned Africans to the lowest category. Few non-Africans at the time perceived the new African–Negro mood and fewer still noted its potential significance. African teachers, clergy, lawyers, doctors and editors were deeply disturbed and provoked by the revival of extreme racist theories which were enforced, and given the cloak of academic respectability, by Herrenvolkist régimes. Few outside observers had understood the shock which had been felt by Africans, again together with the whole wider Negro–African population of the Caribbean and the Americas, when Ethiopia was allowed to be conquered. Ancient, independent Ethiopia, home of the Emperor Ras Tafari and of an age-old Christianity, was a symbol of the greatest importance to subject and aspiring people of African descent or origin.\n\nAlthough relatively few in number, those anti-racist Western democrats who understood and encouraged African resistance to racial ideologies were important. Before 1939 they were articulate in analysing and condemning the mounting racism. Alongside African and Negro colleagues it was they who in the early days of the war helped to prepare programmes for post-war Africa. In the United States as well as in Britain there was a sustained pressure on the part of organizations and individuals to present the case for African advancement and independence.\n\nOrganizations included small but influential bodies such as the Committee on Africa, the War, and Peace Aims, based in New York, which in 1942 published the volume The Atlantic Charter and Africa From an American Standpoint. In their deliberations the Committee, rooted in the Phelps–Stokes Fund which had pioneered educational inquiries and reforms throughout British Africa in the 1920’s, drew substantially upon the co-operation of British church and university leaders and others with expert knowledge of Africa. The work of such organizations concerned with Africa was contemporaneous with that of Gunnar Myrdal and his associates who, in 1942, completed the study of American Negro–White relations which was published in 1944 under the title An American Dilemma.\n\nThe granting by Britain of independence to India, Pakistan and Ceylon in 1947–8 was an event which strengthened African demands for self-government and added weight to the movements for full Negro emancipation in the United States. In African territories possessing minorities of Indian origin even the most untutored Africans took note of the profusion of new flags of India and Pakistan which were displayed during the independence celebrations. Africans observed the predominant mood of jubilation which prevailed over the more sober reaction to reports of division and conflict between Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and others. Whatever the relative status of Africa in the image of the outside world, Africans aspired to the recognition accorded to Asians, an aspiration which was supported by individual Indian intellectuals and by certain local Indian political associations such as the Natal Indian Congress.\n\nAmong the most outspoken individuals to identify themselves with African demands for freedom and advancement were certain Europeans or whites in Africa. From times of the earliest European colonization such individuals had been present as independent-minded missionaries, teachers and the like. The majority of settled Europeans, however, responded to the new emphases on self-government and independence by demanding further recognition for themselves. In non-self-governing territories like Northern Rhodesia and Kenya there was a confident expectation that the substantial contributions by local whites to the Allied war effort, efforts which had won praise from Britain and the Dominions, would be rewarded by the early concession to them of greater constitutional powers and responsibilities.\n\nGreat Britain, notably in the years between 1945 and 1960, was faced with the problems of dealing with and attempting to harmonize the conflicting demands which have been outlined. Genuine gratitude for overseas support underlay the United Kingdom Colonial Development and Welfare Acts of 1940 and 1945 which increased metropolitan aid beyond comparison with earlier endeavours. Genuine concern also imbued war-time consideration of schemes for closer economic and administrative co-operation between neighbouring British African territories. But given the assumptions of the day and prior concern with the urgent problems of British Asia—India, Burma, Ceylon, Malaya—African political development received limited attention. Not until the events of 1948 in the Gold Coast and South Africa compelled the fresh examination of established assumptions, principles and practices was there general awareness of a new “political Africa” as distinct from an “administrative Africa”.\n\nDuring the period 1948–60 there was political activity on a new scale in every zone of British Africa. Under different parties and personalities different policies were formulated and tried by Britain. There was no conscious pursuit of coherence. Empiricism largely governed the metropolitan approach to policy for each territory and zone, though Labour’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, Arthur Creech Jones, introduced important new services to ensure the maximum exchange of information. Egypt and the Sudan required a rapid coming to terms with their particular varieties of Arab nationalism, especially at a time when the ending of the war-time truce had unleashed a more determined Zionism in Palestine.\n\nIn West Africa the challenge was seen by Britain to be the direction of African nationalism into co-operative channels. Dr. Malan’s defeat of Smuts in South Africa raised much the same problem in respect of Afrikaner nationalism. In East Africa the Mau Mau revolutionary movement erupted in Kenya in 1952 to imperil the whole foundation of the colony and the prospects of multiracialism. In Central Africa the British Government, in alliance with local European political leaders, tried to achieve a new order, based on a conception of inter-racial partnership, which would prevent extremes of race feeling from damaging relations between Africans and whites to the point of inhibiting rapid economic and social development as well as moderate political advance. A via media was sought therefore between apartheid and Mau Mau. In 1953, after over two years of preliminary investigation and negotiation by first a Labour and then a Conservative administration, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was created.\n\nBy the turn of the year 1959–60 the United Kingdom Government had come to the conclusion that the facts of contemporary Africa demanded everywhere an acknowledgement of the majority position of the indigenous peoples of the continent. Henceforth, while every influence would be brought to bear on African successor Governments to respect British and other external interests, and British immigrants, the need to safeguard the rights of non-African minorities would be in the hands of African politicians and officials. The process of withdrawal and the transfer of power which was greatly accelerated between 1960 and 1963 continues and several important constitutions have still to be fully adopted or to be applied for a period sufficiently long to permit their analysis over time. But by 1960 the die was cast for all territories under United Kingdom control. In that year, scarcely two decades after the beginning of the Second World War, a continent of colonial dependencies had moved decisively towards becoming independent Africa.\n\n1939–45: PARTNERSHIP IN WAR\n\nAfrica was drawn even more fully into the Second World War than she had been into the First. There were no local campaigns against German colonies in each of the zones, as there had been in 1914–18, but the conquest of Western Europe by Hitler and Mussolini led to two consequences of great significance for Africa. First, the overthrow of the metropolitan régimes in France and Belgium gave to French and Belgian African territories a new and historic importance comparable with that of Portuguese and Spanish America during Napoleon’s Peninsular campaign. It was in French Equatorial Africa that de Gaulle was first received with enthusiasm on his own soil and an effective base prepared by Felix Eboue for free and fighting France. The Belgian Congo likewise became the heart of Belgium’s empire with its manpower and material contributions important to metropolitan morale as well as to the Allied war effort. Despite many assertions to the contrary the fact that their African homelands had assumed importance on the world scene did register upon the indigenous peoples, illiterate though most were and little informed of international affairs.\n\nThe second consequence of Hitler’s successful blitzkrieg and domination of the European mainland was to give neighbouring Africa a wholly new role in Allied military strategy. After the catastrophic events of May and June 1940, when Mussolini cast his lot completely with Hitler, and Pétain and Darlan left overseas France demoralized and divided, the reaction of each territory in Africa assumed a new significance. Until the tide turned decisively at El Alamein the availability of the North African littoral as a spring-board for Allied air forces, armies and navies remained uncertain.\n\nThe defection of Vichy added substantially to the burden of the Allies. The Maghreb was closed, or hostile, in support of the German Afrika Korps and the Italian forces, whose first objective was to advance to the Nile and the Canal to choke “the throat of the British Empire”. In the Gulf of Aden the position of Jibuti was not settled until after Mussolini’s over-running of British Somaliland had been reversed and the Fascist armies cleared from Italian Somaliland, Eritrea and Ethiopia. Vichy armed resistance at Dakar denied to the Allies Senegal and the Senegalese who would have been invaluable during earlier naval and military engagements. The seizing of the harbours and mainland of Madagascar demanded resources which were required urgently in the war against the Axis powers, including Japan, whose submarines co-operated with German vessels off the East African coast.\n\nIt might be too harsh to compare the African colonies of Vichy France with those of Germany in 1914–18, and possibly inaccurate also, because no Vichy field commander displayed the spirit of von Lettow or Zimmermann, but certainly Vichy opposition to the Allies was costly and brought military conflict to wide areas of Africa. Portugal’s neutrality kept Portuguese African colonies relatively insulated from the war but they were the only extensive parts of the continent to escape, a fact which has some bearing on their subsequent distinctive development.\n\nThe United Kingdom, isolated as never before by the neutrality of the Irish Republic within the British Isles, as well as by the defeat and occupation of all her nearer neighbours and traditional allies on the mainland of Europe, was in special peril from May 1940 until the United States entered the war and American aid and military support built up her strength to the point where invasion by the Wehrmacht was unlikely to succeed. Save for Eire, the Dominions and Colonies rallied at once to Britain, New Zealand, Australia and Canada in the van. That they were all weaker than the mother country seemed to matter less at the time than the fact that the response was virtually unanimous. There were at least bastions on every continent from which the forces of Germany, Italy and Japan might be beaten back.\n\nIn Africa, for reasons which have been suggested already, the British territories proved of particular value. Without Dakar, Freetown was vital to Atlantic communications; so also the South Atlantic headquarters of the Royal Navy near Cape Town, Durban, and the other South African harbours. The deep-water base at Kilindini, Mombasa, facilitated entry for troops to defend East Africa and provided a key link with Aden and Bombay, well clear of the Madagascar Channel. In the massive circumnavigations of Africa by the vast convoys required to sustain the defence of Egypt and India, when the Mediterranean was all but closed, these established British foci proved of incalculable worth.\n\nAs bases for air operations, air transport and air training all zones of British Africa were of notable value. North African airfields were essential for long-distance raids on Europe, such as the attack on Ploesti, and for air cover in the Mediterranean until 1943. The West African air communication link, via Takoradi, to the Sudan, Egypt and North Africa greatly speeded the supply of equipment and specialist units, while Royal Air Force instructional squadrons trained fresh air crews in South Africa, Rhodesia and Kenya, where good flying conditions reduced cadet casualties and wastage of aircraft. From all British territories coastal command sorties were flown constantly against enemy submarines and surface vessels which were sunk or impounded by action of the Royal and South African Air Forces.\n\nIf scientific and technical advance in the design and production of aircraft gave the British bases in Africa an added dimension of utility during the war, much the same was true of road and railway engineering and the development of motor transport, locomotives and rolling stock. Trunk roads and railways were built or improved in every territory to speed the movement of armoured and other vehicles and to reduce the wear and tear on them. The main arterial system which was developed was the “Great North Road” which ran from South Africa to Kenya and beyond to the Nile and Egypt. When shipping and aircraft were in short supply, and sea and air lanes were imperilled by submarines and enemy air forces, surface communications helped to tip the balance towards probable success in the mounting of land campaigns such as the driving back of the invaders from Kenya and the direct assault on the Italian imperial forces in Ethiopia. The inland transit of Tanganyika was of great advantage, obvious especially to those older Southern African soldiers of all races in the motor transport companies who possessed memories of columns of slow-moving human carriers in the German East Africa campaign.\n\nThe contributions of men and materials from each British African territory were substantially greater than in the Great War though the casualties were proportionately less. It is impossible as well as invidious to evaluate in retrospect particular contributions to military operations in which unique, marginal and major actions by individuals and groups combine and alter over time to produce the eventual result, whether stalemate, defeat or victory. The addition of one barely trained and poorly armed battalion has proved decisive in defence; the successful attack on a small feature by a single unit has turned a battle; tactical gains have borne strategic fruit. Each of these truisms was exemplified repeatedly in the Western desert of Egypt and Libya, Eritrea, Ethiopia, the Somalilands, Madagascar, and in Italy, Burma and Malaya, where varied permutations and combinations of British Africans fought. But, given the fact that Egypt had to be held at all costs, it is probably correct to suggest that the positive response of the Dominion of South Africa to Britain’s declaration of war on September 3, 1939, was again, as in 1914, the most important single reaction in Africa from the viewpoints of both the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.\n\nThe narrowness of Smuts’s majority over Hertzog in the parliamentary division on September 6 has been referred to above. But there was a majority and the Governor-General, Sir Patrick Duncan, one of Milner’s kindergarten, did not hesitate to reject Hertzog’s demand, as Prime Minister, for a general election. Smuts, to whom a field-marshal’s baton was soon awarded by George VI, acted with characteristic determination in mobilizing every resource, despite strong and menacing opposition from those in active sympathy with Germany both in the Union and South-West Africa.\n\nSmuts initiated, with the able support of Hofmeyr and many of South Africa’s most competent men, the most thorough-going and constructive set of inquiries into the national economy and the structure and functioning of South African society. Problems of race and colour and the position of the African, Coloured and Asian communities were not shirked. Faced with urgent manpower questions Smuts was frank in acknowledging the weaknesses of traditional policies of racial segregation. The blue-prints of his experts, van Eck, van Biljon, Malherbe and scores of others from industry and agriculture and statistical, educational, and health services promised a new era of welfare, development and dignity for all the “Non-European” peoples comprising the majority of the land.\n\nThough the promise of a new age was blighted in 1948 by the folly of inadequate electoral preparation, and Smuts’s defeat at the polls, the war years after 1943 were politically much easier than those before. With an Allied victory seemingly assured there was country-wide support for Smuts at the general election of late 1943 in which the overseas soldiers’ vote played a big part. The South African Armoured Division, which voted in Egypt before going to the front in Italy, carried the general good wishes of the country, as now also did the veteran squadrons and ships of the South African Air Force and Navy, and the specialist units of the army which had been engaged alongside Allied formations throughout the war. The more perilous military period had been that of the Axis ascendancy when sabotage, spying and disaffection in South Africa occasioned acute crises of personal and group loyalty and made it a matter of real courage for the individual Afrikaner to enlist in the forces or otherwise to declare his allegiance.\n\nBut Smuts in 1939 and 1940 had shown no hesitation in at once committing troops to the defence of Kenya. The First Infantry Brigade, comprising the Transvaal Scottish from the Witwatersrand, the Royal Natal Carbineers and the Duke of Edinburgh’s Own Rifles from Cape Town, were rushed to reinforce the handful of East African units stretched along an immense front. They were joined by fighter, bomber and reconnaissance squadrons of the South African Air Force equipped with old-fashioned aircraft. Had the Duke of Aosta’s forces attacked with any resolution they must have over-run Kenya and much of British East Africa as easily as they had done the British Somaliland Protectorate.\n\nThe initiative was wrested from them quickly, however, and together South African, West African and East African armoured cars and infantry supported by their own field gunners, and Indian mountain gunners, swept across the Juba River through Italian Somaliland, the Ogaden and on to Addis Ababa. From Eritrea and the Sudan Indian, Sudanese and British regular and irregular units conquered the key fortress of Keren after the most severe fighting of the whole Ethiopian campaign, an action in which Coloured South African motor transport drivers operated with gallantry.\n\nAs soon as Ethiopia was conquered and restored to the Emperor the South African troops of the East Africa Force were transferred to join the British Eighth Army in the Western Desert, where the Second Division played a noteworthy part in the capture of Bardia but thereafter suffered disaster with others at Tobruk. The more experienced First Division was fully engaged in operations until after the battle of El Alamein. For several reasons, not least political, the First Division which had been some three years in the field was withdrawn by Smuts to South Africa after the tide of war turned towards Allied victory. The tragic loss of the Second Division was seized upon for more vehement anti-war propaganda by the Afrikaner nationalists but the safe return to the Union for leave and re-training of thousands of disciplined and seasoned soldiers greatly strengthened Smuts’s position.\n\nThe pilots and other officers who were seconded to the United Kingdom services, the South African squadrons in the Desert Air Force, and other individuals and units of the Union Defence Force who remained with the Eighth Army or other Allied formations deserve as much attention as the numerically larger Army Brigades and Divisions. It is important, however, in this brief survey to emphasize that the technical and supply contributions of South Africa were perhaps as important to the British and total Allied war effort as were any specific military contributions.\n\nThe steady growth of manufacturing industry during the interwar years had brought the Union to the point in 1939 where very substantial war-time industrial production was possible. Food packaging of military and civilian rations, the making of uniforms, clothing and camp equipment, the manufacture of arms and ammunition and armoured vehicles: in these and scores of other ways South Africa produced essential commodities. The well-established dock and loading facilities at ports which were used habitually in peace-time by large vessels of the Union-Castle and other shipping lines were adapted for war purposes; battle-damaged warships like H.M.S. Barham were repaired at Durban, which developed into a particularly important naval and troop transit centre.\n\nIf senior British assessments after the war gave first place to South Africa’s contribution there was no lack of appreciation of the efforts of the other British African territories, each of which in its own way exerted itself to the uttermost in mobilizing its manpower and resources. Southern Rhodesia made a specially heavy sacrifice and was extended to supply men to her affiliated United Kingdom regiments and squadrons, and to West, East and South African formations. The British residents of Southern Rhodesia, like those in Kenya, were scarcely sufficient in number to maintain casualty-stricken units of their own, such as the Southern Rhodesian antitank gunners and the Kenya reconnaissance squadron, but they were called upon regularly to send elsewhere officers, instructors and specialists.\n\nThe Africans of Southern Rhodesia, like those in the High Commission Territories and South Africa were recruited to the forces in substantial numbers. The fearful Afrikaner-nationalist tradition of restricting the possession and use of firearms by Africans seriously impaired the military contribution which Africans from South Africa would otherwise have made. Zulus who responded enthusiastically for initial artillery and infantry training tended to withdraw when offered only pioneer, labouring work in the Native Military Corps. The Sotho, Tswana and other peoples who attested in tens of thousands were nevertheless armed appropriately when on active service away from Southern Africa and they constituted an integral part of British Corps and Army troops in North Africa and Italy.\n\nThe Gold Coast and Nigeria Regiments, the many territorial battalions of the King’s African Rifles, the Northern Rhodesia Regiment, together with other West, East and Central African units made up very effective fighting forces. They were well led by British officers and by experienced African warrant officers and non-commissioned officers,a and co-operated fully and in friendly fashion with South African and Indian soldiers. Although it would be wrong to exaggerate sentiment, a frank mutual respect and sense of comradeship was developed, not least on the part of young white South African soldiers for competent and courageous African platoon sergeants, and veteran sergeant-majors. Many Kenya and Northern Rhodesia whites likewise reported a new depth of understanding and respect for Africans who fought beside them in Africa and South-East Asia. The West African divisions made a notable contribution to General Cunningham’s East Africa Force and played their full part in alternating in the leadership in attack during the advance through Somalia and Ethiopia. Together with African battalions from East and Central Africa they were posted subsequently to the Burma front, to figure prominently in dispatches from the South-East Asia campaigns.\n\nThough their material contribution may have been relatively limited both East and West Africa underwent domestic revolutions, principally in the organization of production to meet war-time demands. Kenya was in the firing-line and civilians were organized on an emergency basis. There was no panic on the coffee estates or African shamvas and food production was intensified. Some alarm was expressed by private employers about the probable long-term effect of Army and Government rates of pay, rations, clothing and accommodation on the many thousands of specially-recruited Africans. There were also those who seriously questioned the wisdom of permitting white South African privates, sappers, signallers and troopers to labour alongside African soldiers and workers in British colonies dependent on the leadership of a small élite settler class. Such “white askaris” could well raise doubts about the established order in the minds of observant Africans. There was, however, no lack of generosity or hospitality for the humblest soldiers on the part of Lady Delamere and the Kenya Women’s Emergency Organization or the local residents who provided aftercare for wounded and sick from the military hospitals. This mobilization of domestic resources in front-line Kenya was repeated in the other lands of British East Africa—Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar.\n\nThrough the conquests of 1940–1 the bonds of responsibility in North-East Africa were extended to embrace the Somali lands and Eritrea, which were brought under the British Military Administration. The Emperor was restored to Ethiopia and assisted in the rehabilitation of his kingdom while the evacuation and safeguarding of the tens of thousands of Axis prisoners of war, mostly Italian, was undertaken by the British authorities. Italian vessels under protection of the International Red Cross removed women and children and other civilians from ports like Berbera. Prisoners of war had to be conveyed to camps and hospitals in Kenya and South Africa.b Ships and troops were directed from military operations for these humanitarian activities, the scale of which demands that reference be made to them. The excellent quality of the administration introduced into Eritrea and the Somali areas should also be remembered. Many of the Somalis who subsequently became effective administrative and police officers gained knowledge and experience under British military mentors.\n\nWest Africa likewise underwent thorough-going domestic mobilization. The harbour at Freetown worked to full capacity and the other ports of British West Africa were actively engaged in transhipping soldiers and goods. When the air resources of the Allies were sufficient the West African “air bridge”, which had bases in Liberia and the French territories as well as those of Britain, became an operation of the greatest magnitude and importance. In West Africa, as in the Middle East, a Resident Ministry was introduced, in 1942, to ensure the effective working of a vital supply route. A Minister of Cabinet rank, Lord Swinton, was at the head of a West African War Council, comprising the four Governors and service commanders. Although a West African Governors’ Conference had been approved shortly before the war in 1939, it was equipped with no secretariat and it was the stimulus of war which in fact initiated effective inter-territorial co-operation.\n\nThe War Council secretariat was set up at Achimota in the Gold Coast. It was also in the Gold Coast, at Takoradi, that Allied aircraft were assembled in large numbers for dispatch to the Middle East. Nigeria’s contribution in manpower and raw materials exceeded that of the Gold Coast but the central position of the smaller territory and its more convenient access to the West gave it importance as a headquarters. One measure both of the appreciation felt by Britain for West African war-time co-operation, and her recognition of the needs of her West African territories was the allocation to them before 1946 of one-third of the total sum granted under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act.\n\nEgypt and the Sudan were inevitably involved in the heavy fighting which raged to and fro between the Gulf of Sirte and Alexandria. It is a mark of the difference between the First and Second World Wars that it was on African soil that major land battles involving Western European nations were fought for very much longer than the period of campaigning in Europe itself. From the day of Mussolini’s declaration of war, June 10, 1940, until his Commander-in-Chief in Africa, Marshal Messe, ordered all remaining Axis troops to lay down their arms in Tunisia on May 13, 1943, Northern Africa was a principal battle-ground, comparable in importance with the Russian and Far Eastern fronts.\n\nAt the crest of the Axis wave in August 1942 there was the prospect of a fusion of victorious German, Japanese and Italian troops in the lands of Arabia. The Germans were in the Caucasus and at the gates of Stalingrad; the Japanese still in a position of strength on the borders of India. Rommel faced a mere sixty-mile gap between El Alamein and Alexandria. Had the Afrika Korps broken through the war would have taken a dramatically different course, no matter what the determined Russian defenders might have been able still to achieve along the Volga. But the British Commonwealth line held and on the night of October 23 the Eighth Army struck the powerful blow which rolled the enemy back from the Nile and the Canal and across the Egyptian frontier. Past Tobruk, Benghazi and El Agheila the Eighth Army drove to unfamiliar Tripoli and Tunisia, where a junction was effected with the British–American First Army. With the Maghreb regained the Fighting French were able to organize the Moroccan and Algerian divisions which fought so well in the Italian campaigns.\n\nGiven the precarious balance of forces and the recurrent prospect of Allied defeat in the Western Desert before October 1943, it is not surprising that there was little sense of positive commitment to the Allied cause on the part of Egyptians eager for independence. Where Hertzog and his associates felt kinship for the Germans, so Farouk and several leading Egyptians were friendly towards Italy and were, like Aly Maher Pasha, and many students, in no way averse to contemplating possible escape from British overlordship through alliance with Mussolini and Hitler. Not until after Alamein did the position ease to the extent that there could be relatively unguarded co-operation with Egyptian army units in desert manœuvres and other military training exercises.\n\nBefore Alamein there was constant awareness of a revolutionary, nationalist element in the Egyptian army and of the Muslim Brotherhood. After September 1939 and before Italy brought neighbouring Libya into the war, however, Egypt’s politicians reacted correctly in according Britain the use of all necessary services and defence facilities, as required by the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. The same was true after June 1940 when first Hassan Sabry Pasha and then Hussein Sirry Pasha were appointed to fill the prime ministership in succession to the suspect Aly Maher. But it was not until after Farouk was subjugated in February 1942 that Nahas Pasha was called upon to form a government, and it was only after his Wafd were sweepingly successful in the March general election that the internal political situation became reasonably satisfactory from the British point of view. There were alarums but no major troubles from dissidents during the tense months at Alamein.\n\nAs reward for such co-operation—whether grudging, passive or active—Egyptians were almost at one, after the Axis were cleared from North Africa, in demanding total evacuation by Britain and the incorporation of the Sudan into an Egyptian–Sudanese Union. As a step towards ensuring recognition of her full independent personality in the peace deliberations Egypt, now under Ahmed Maher Pasha, made her own declaration of war on the Axis powers shortly before the end of the conflict in Europe. Though Ahmed Maher was assassinated by a fanatical extremist for this act, which some alleged would lead to a 1914–18-type labour conscription for the Far Eastern War, Egypt was, nevertheless, made eligible to participate fully in post-war councils. In particular she was given a lever to prise full independence when, after 1945, the vast Allied military encampments and transit centres were largely cleared of Commonwealth soldiers and their equipment.\n\nThe Sudan did not become a full-scale area of politics until after the war. Though within twelve years full independence was to be declared by Ismail el-Azhary, it was only in 1944 that an Advisory Council for the Northern Sudan was appointed, and only in 1946 that the Governor-General summoned a largely Sudanese conference to consider further constitutional advances from this slight beginning. Reference has been made already to the effectiveness and value of the Sudan Defence Force in the campaigns against the Italians in Eritrea and Ethiopia. The civil sphere also was marked by a readiness on the part of the Sudanese to co-operate in increasing production whenever possible and in facilitating the efficient transit of troops and supplies to and from the battlefronts.\n\n1945–60/3: NATIONALISM—AFRICAN, AFRIKANER, ARAB\n\nIt was remarked above that the period 1948–60 was characterized by political activity on a new scale throughout British Africa. Nineteen forty-eight was in fact a fateful year. Events in Palestine, Gold Coast and South Africa directly affected three centres of British power in Africa while the first full year of Indian and Pakistani independence changed some principal assumptions of Imperial organization and strategy in respect of East, North-East and Northern Africa. The post-war years before 1948 were important in themselves but seen in terms of an overall pattern of British–African relationships they were primarily years of readjustment after the war. The implementation of armistice arrangements, preparations for peace settlements, the foundation of the United Nations, demobilization, the adjustment to a new peace-time metropolitan government dedicated to a new ideal of welfare at home and abroad: these were the matters which occupied attention. Overseas, the Indian sub-continent rather than Africa demanded priority within the Commonwealth.\n\nIn Africa too between 1945 and 1948 governments and political leaders were naturally concerned about the major questions of world peace and international organization. This was especially true of Egypt and South Africa. In both these countries, however, and certainly in the area of administration, more time and effort might well have been devoted to grappling in more vigorous and constructive fashion with the domestic problems of peace, notably in providing for the fullest possible utilization of the new skills, knowledge and ambitions of thousands of ex-servicemen and workers from key war-time industries.\n\nIn British East and West Africa there were also many ex-soldiers. One rough indication of the numbers involved is supplied by the Colonial Office estimate that 228,000 were on the strength of the East African military forces in May 1945, compared with 11,000 in September 1939. The respective West African figures are 146,000 and 8,000. Intelligent plans were devised by perceptive officers and officials for the employment of such individuals in postwar development, but fulfilment fell far short of even modest objectives. War-weariness, coupled with the inertia induced by old habits, assumptions and the hoped-for resumption of pre-war patterns of behaviour and practice inhibited action. Critical opportunities were wasted.\n\nThe flare-up over Palestine and the involvement of Ernest Bevin and the Labour Government in negotiations with Arabs, Jews and the United Nations dominated British public thought in 1948, but what happened in the Gold Coast and South Africa was of equal, possibly even of greater, long-term import. Certainly where defeat and humiliation in Palestine brought new depth and determination to Egyptian nationalism, so African nationalism and Afrikaner nationalism were each given new prospects and significant initial power after the riots of ex-servicemen in Accra in February 1948, and the narrow but all-important defeat of Field-Marshal Smuts by Dr. Malan in the election of May 26, 1948.\n\nEvents in each zone had their influence on the other zones. The overthrow of Farouk and the Egyptian revolution led by the Free Officers in 1952, Sudan’s declaration of independence at the beginning of 1956, the attack on Nasser and the abandonment of Anglo-French-Israeli intervention in Suez in 1956 were interrelated events of Northern Africa which were closely observed by leaders in other parts of Africa. Yet events in Commonwealth and colonial countries south of the Sahara and in the Indian subcontinent had perhaps their more intimate interaction and direct effect.\n\nNo event in Africa was more decisive than the publication of the report of the Watson commission of inquiry into the Gold Coast disturbances of 1948. A subsequent, constitutional reform committee composed wholly of senior Africans of the Gold Coast under Sir Henley Coussey, an eminent African judge, attempted to modify the radicalism of the report. The Labour Secretary of State for the Colonies, who possessed a profound knowledge and experience of colonial issues, applied himself towards the same end. There was a general desire on the part of the Labour administration to encourage West African constitutional advance. Various steps towards this end had been taken and were in plan. The 1946 “Burns Constitution” for the Gold Coast was clearly too limited to provide long-term satisfaction. But the Riots Commission, composed of a chairman from the United Kingdom with little previous experience of Africa, together with an Oxford College head, precipitated developments by their wide-ranging analyses of the underlying causes of the relatively minor local disturbances and by their far-reaching recommendations. Major constitutional provisions were called into question along with other political, economic and social arrangements and many challenging obiter dicta were included in the report.\n\nIf a militant radical had not been available among the African nationalist leaders the course of Gold Coast and African history might have been different. Dr. Danquah and his liberal-traditionalist colleagues could well have prevailed in the Gold Coast and brought to eventual victory their distinctive brand of African nationalism. Had this occurred they would have been reinforced by similar groups in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and the Gambia. But Kwame Nkrumah was back home and already in a position of potential power as secretary of Dr. Danquah’s United Gold Coast Convention. With an essentially political as distinct from professional background, and as one whose nationalist fervour had been quickened and given single-minded direction by life abroad in the United States and Britain, Dr. Nkrumah at once saw the opportunities opened by the Watson report. Like the quick-minded Prince Obolensky, whose try at Twickenham is part of history, Kwame Nkrumah had most of the field still to traverse when he seized the ball in 1949 and embarked on his spectacular solo run. In place of the former members of his own team he was able to count on the popular support of younger radicals of all kinds, not least on certain disgruntled ex-servicemen whose military experiences had given them disciplined determination and confidence.\n\nKwame Nkrumah had been a leading participant with the West Indian, George Padmore, at the Pan-African Conference at Manchester in 1945. Jomo Kenyatta, Julius Nyerere and Kamuzu Hastings Banda were also present at this meeting which, for the first time, included significant African as distinct from American Negro and British West Indian representation. Whereas Dr. Du Bois and the others who conferred in Paris in 1919—and who attempted unsuccessfully to secure Versailles approval for a Pan-Negro administration of the former German colonies—were mainly Americans or West Indians of African descent, the 1945 Pan-Africanists spoke from within the context of their own continent. Tempered by their disheartening experiences with Soviet and international Communism in the thirties they were now more hardened nationalists. By the time that the first Pan-African conference was convened by Dr. Nkrumah on African soil in 1958 the new nationalism had an independent base of some strength and had already exerted an influence throughout neighbouring French Africa and other parts of the continent.\n\nGhana, herald of the new independent Africa, was born out of the Gold Coast on March 6, 1957, after Dr. Nkrumah and his Convention Peoples’ Party had won elections in 1951, 1954 and 1956 and had advanced rapidly through successive constitutional stages. At each stage it became clearer that a strong centralist government was the objective and that little consideration would be given to regional, ethnic and cultural traditions. The Ashanti in particular were subjugated. By 1960, when the new authoritarian republican constitution replaced that of 1957, control by the President and his dominant political party was already virtually complete.\n\nThe triumph of the new African nationalism or Nkrumahism after 1951 had a many-sided influence. The constitutional advance of Ghana was seized upon, not always from the best of motives, to justify the acceleration of constitutional advance elsewhere. In Middle East and Mediterranean countries and South-East Asia the point was made openly that Arabs, Greek Cypriots, Maltese and Malayans invited priority over Africans. Among Welsh and Scottish Nationalists bent on home rule or independence there were echoes of this opinion, an opinion which was even more vigorously expressed by many Britons overseas in Africa. More emphatic still was the reaction of the recently victorious Afrikaner nationalists. Among Africans elsewhere in Africa, however, whether in predominantly “African states” or the “plural societies”, including South Africa, there was frank delight at the progress of the Gold Coast into Ghana. Like Negroes in the United States and the Caribbean they were moved to a new hope and a growing impatience with their civic disabilities.\n\nThe opposed force of white or European nationalism or racism in Africa was, like African nationalism, given unexpected opportunity in 1948. The success of Dr. Malan’s Nationalists in May 1948 owed little directly to events in the Gold Coast. Internal issues of race relations, notably reaction to the report of an enlightened commission of inquiry into African affairs under Mr. Justice Fagan, provided more obvious and ready-to-hand reasons. But after 1948 developments in the Gold Coast and West Africa, and the whole strengthening of African determination for rapid change throughout the continent, had its obvious effect on the political thought and organization of the locally resident Europeans.\n\nUntil 1960 Europeans in the plural societies were largely assured of the continuance of United Kingdom support for them as cotrustees, or equal senior partners, but there was nevertheless throughout the fifties, growing apprehension at the nature and implications of the rapid constitutional advance of the African states. The eruption of Mau Mau in Kenya in 1952 reinforced this apprehension and, among the dominant Afrikaners in the south, it hardened determination to retain power in the hands of European rulers in a land where Europeans were more numerous than anywhere else on the continent and were conscious of having been resident for three centuries.\n\nThe 1952 Tercentenary celebrations of the landing of Jan van Riebeeck and his Dutch East Indian Company settlers served as a powerful symbolic occasion which was exploited with skill. Though natural emphasis was laid on the Dutch–Afrikaner heritage, British achievement since 1795 was acknowledged in ceremonies which directed attention also to the range and quality of the overall European contribution to every part of Africa. By such means Afrikaner nationalism drew support from many insecure Europeans settled elsewhere in Africa—Belgian, French, Portuguese, Italian as well as British—and from sympathetic elements in metropolitan Europe, the United States and the “White Dominions” of the Commonwealth.\n\nAfrikaner nationalism’s electoral triumph in 1948 was not, however, received in Africa at the time with any enthusiasm, either by the majorityc of white South African voters, who supported Smuts, or by most white Central and East Africans. Many whites in British Africa, including the Union of South Africa, were in fact more outspoken in their regret and alarm than leaders in the City of London and other United Kingdom centres who possessed close, traditional bonds with Johannesburg, the Cape and Natal. To such United Kingdom interests there seemed to be danger to the profitability of their investments in the proposals of Mr. Justice Fagan’s Native Laws Commission of Inquiry, which sought to transform the whole system of African employment from one based largely on the temporary migration of rural tribesmen to a new policy which placed first emphasis on stabilization, including the recognition of property and other rights for permanent townsmen. Lever Brothers and other companies who tended to welcome African stabilization on economic and social grounds, were in a minority. Locally resident Europeans were far from agreement on the Fagan Commission’s proposals but there was confidence that Smuts would never accelerate African advance to the point of danger. The recent record of the Afrikaner-nationalist opposition during the war still dominated their outlook in a way which many in metropolitan Britain, faced with multiple international problems of seeming greater magnitude and urgency, found difficult to understand.\n\nSouthern Rhodesian reaction to Dr. Malan’s victory over Smuts was characteristically rapid and vigorous. Sir Godfrey Huggins (Lord Malvern), who had been in imminent danger of defeat for reasons similar to those which had contributed to Smuts’s downfall—war-weariness, post-war disgruntlement and apathy, desire for a change—was returned with an overwhelming majority in the general election which was held a few months after Dr. Malan’s triumph. Afrikaner nationalism, notably republicanism and the baasskap elements of apartheid, was then seen as a more acute danger than African nationalism by the almost wholly white electorate of Southern Rhodesia; but they responded soon enough to Huggins’s warnings of a new African militancy from the north, and supported him in his endeavours to found a British Central African state which would stifle racism and deflect and harmonize the conflicting nationalisms.\n\nThe Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland represents an important attempt to achieve co-operative “multi-racialism” or interracial “partnership”. It is specially significant to the Britain–Africa relationship because its creation was so deliberately supported by both Labour and Conservative ministers and by the forceful senior officials of the Colonial Office. Because of the favourable publicity which Central African partnership received by contrast with South African apartheid and Mau Mau racism in Kenya, the importance of the Federation extended beyond Africa to the Commonwealth and the United Nations. From the time when the inter-war idea of formal closer political association between the three territories was resurrected and given open official publicity in March 1951, and official support, until the virtual abandonment of the experiment after the report of the Monckton Commission in October 1960, the Federation in its pursuit of partnership was presented to the world as a supreme venture in imaginative statesmanship.\n\nAlthough it is tempting to condemn Central African Federation as a total failure, especially at a time when its formal dissolution is accomplished, it is still necessary now, as it was in the years before the making of the Rhodesia-Nyasaland Order in Council in 1953, to avoid hasty judgements and decisions. For those who, like myself regretfully decided in 1951 and 1952 that significant flawsd in the draft constitution, and the method of its preparation and proposed implementation, offered little prospect of success, it is specially necessary to recall the positive as well as the negative aspects of an important experiment which was backed by many eminent Britons.\n\nIn so far as interactions within Africa were concerned, however, the Federation during its brief existence both suffered from its neighbours and occasioned misgiving and alarm among them. The Europeans of the two Rhodesias and Nyasaland, on whom the substance of power was conferred by the 1953 Federal Constitution, were made increasingly apprehensive for the safety of their families and security of their property by the reports of Mau Mau atrocities in Kenya. The long duration of Mau Mau and the cost and difficulty of its suppression, even with full United Kingdom financial and military aid, made a deep impression on many Colonial Service officers as well as permanent residents. There was among all of them a visible stiffening of determination to preserve law and order.\n\nThis reaction of the Europeans, understandable in itself, was one which had the equally natural effect of arousing resentment among the educated and law-abiding Africans who composed the majority of the population. There was resentment among the Africans of Southern Rhodesia, but resentment was felt even more strongly by the Africans of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland who suffered the principal shock when Federation was imposed against their wishes and in direct opposition to the political expectations which past Colonial Office pronouncements had encouraged among them. Such African discontent was communicated to their fellows beyond the borders and had the effect in East Africa of making any consideration of closer political association between Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar unacceptable. There was, for example, too little rational consideration of the report of the East Africa Royal Commission 1953–5 which recommended an increase in inter-territorial co-operation in the interests of economic and social advance for all. The mere mention of “Federation” in Nairobi by a visiting Secretary of State provoked vehement hostility among Africans in Uganda and throughout East Africa.\n\nAfter 1957 and Ghana’s admission to full membership of the Commonwealth and United Nations the confrontations between African and European politicians became increasingly clear-cut. Every conception of trusteeship was challenged by African leaders and gradualism was utterly rejected. Mounting pressure was applied by Ghana, supported by Ethiopia, Liberia, Egypt and the Sudan, to hasten the independence of all territories under European rule. From their different standpoints the United States and the Soviet Union threw their weight behind this pan-African initiative.\n\nIn Tunisia and Morocco, though not Algeria, France had accepted independence, and in 1958 the whole of French West and French Equatorial Africa and Madagascar were granted autonomy by de Gaulle in a single dramatic gesture which transformed the political map of the continent and brought thirteen new African states into international councils. With the balance tipped so decisively and precipitately in favour of African independence there was an intensification of efforts by all other metropolitan powers, save Portugal, to capture African goodwill by accelerating the advance to self-government. Belgium became convinced that she could not hope to hold on when her two powerful European and African neighbours, France and Britain, had decided on immediate African independence, so she too hastened to abandon her long-established traditions of halting gradualism in the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi. During 1959 the conviction grew that independence in North-East, East and Central Africa must accompany the advance in West Africa, and Mr. Macmillan’s “wind of change” speech in Cape Town in February 1960, after his visits to Ghana and Nigeria, was a general proclamation of the new United Kingdom attitude.e\n\nThe Congo breakdown had a profound effect on the Europeans of South-Central Africa but it did not lead to a reversal of European metropolitan policy. In the minds of many responsibility was now to be transferred to the United States and the United Nations. By the end of 1960 the new era in British-African relationships was fully initiated. Governmental responsibilities in Africa were to be abandoned as speedily as possible. Commonwealth ideals and objectives were subjected to detached, critical, even hostile, appraisal of a wholly new kind. South Africa’s withdrawal from the Commonwealth left it to Nigeria and the other African members to produce leaders who might give to the “multi-racial Commonwealth” the thought and attention and leadership given to the older Empire-Commonwealth during the inter-war years by Smuts.\n\nMeanwhile Britain’s leaders were content to explore fresh conceptions such as “Europe”—with Frenchmen resigned to the evacuation of Algeria and with Belgians, Hollanders, Italians and other Europeans equally disenchanted by their recent experiences of overseas settlement, colonial rule and “decolonization”. Wider alliances were also examined, notably the idea of a new “Atlantic Community” integrating Europe and North America, possibly with the addition of Australia and New Zealand. Though links between Britain and Africa were not to be severed or wilfully attenuated they would henceforth increasingly become the concern of the Department of Technical Co-operation and the Foreign Office. In an age of fierce affirmations of independence by African leaders, coupled with sharp criticism of their former metropolitan rulers, the British Prime Minister was moved to assert in 1963 that Great Britain, too, was independent. Yet, like Egypt’s independence in the early 1920’s, Britain’s independence in the 1960’s could be no more than strictly “qualified”. Centuries of history have never been discarded overnight and in an increasingly interdependent world established bridgeheads must not be abandoned. In the chapters which follow we attempt to examine in turn Britain’s several bridgeheads in Africa which, since de Gaulle’s rejection of Britain’s application for membership of the European Common Market, have received warmer and more hopeful attention from those who had previously assigned to them, and the Commonwealth, a subordinate importance."
