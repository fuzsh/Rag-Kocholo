Artificial Intelligence can add about $15.7 trillion to the world economy by 2030. To take that into perspective, thatâs about the combined economic output of China and India as of today. With various companies predicting that the use of AI can boost business productivity by up to 40%, the dramatic increase in the number of AI start-ups has magnified 14 times since 2000. The application of AI can range from tracking asteroids and other cosmic bodies in space to predict diseases on earth, explore new and innovative ways to curb terrorism to make industrial designs.\n\nAccording to Our World UN Challenges (2018),\"Everybody seems to agree that artificial intelligence (AI) is, and will be, a determining factor for the future of humanity â from what it means to be human, to the social impacts of laying off Uber drivers once cars drive themselves, to AI propaganda in politics, and the rise of the robots or a superintelligence exterminating humanity. But what does AIâs bewildering profusion of implications mean for the global order? Anticipating the challenges of AI requires breaking them down into more manageable bites because failure in any one of these three distinct bundles of challenges would be catastrophic.\"\n\nThis conference track is intended to present both theoretical and applied perspectives. Topics covered are on a range of areas including, but not limited to topics covered by the United Nations Global Challenges\n\nScientific Advisory Board\n\nChair:\n\nMatteo Zallio (University of Cambridge), UK\n\nBoard Members:\n\nCarlos Aceves-GonzÃ¡lez (University of Guadalajara), Mexico\n\nHanan A.

On the other hand, avatars, bots, and other digital, virtual entities can define new interactions and experiences that human beings never experienced before.\n\nWith the opportunities generated by the rise of digital environments and the Metaverse, there is an urgent need to study and test new technologies to optimize the use, access, and development of those digital environments, but also to investigate the ethical, behavioral, social, philosophical, epistemological, anthropological factors that will impact the creation and proliferation of safe, secure, inclusive and accessible digital environments and virtual worlds.\n\nThis conference track aims to address a wide spectrum of theoretical and practical topics related to digital environments, digital twins, the Metaverse and virtual, immersive spaces. It provides an inspiring forum to enable researchers, entrepreneurs, and innovators to share business experiences and scientific research findings, while examining the new frontiers of technology, the novel research regarding advancements in the state-of-art of digital environments and the Metaverse, as well as to explore the emerging research topics and open issues, such as the Metavethics, the ethics and integrity principles applied to the Metaverse and digital environments.\n\nOur core values are devoted to guaranteeing people-centeredness, inclusiveness, equity, interdisciplinarity, and international participation from industry and academia particularly from underrepresented minorities and communities.

It has moved to a better state of erecting structures that are both smart and sustainable enough to prevent cost overrun and material wastage. With several policies aiming to improve the economic conditions of a particular region, sustainable construction has been identified as propelling and fast-tracking the policies in proposal and implementation towards a more stable economy. In the past, construction practices were saddled with the use of crude materials, which, in turn, made construction expensive. The need for more cost management and that of effective all-round management of construction practice has driven the construction professionals to consider ways of implementing information technologies into construction. However, the implementation has yet to be easily accepted as many professionals believe that the disadvantages involved in its full implementation outweigh the services it is going to render in construction. This gave rise to some construction firmsâ sticking to the tried and tested ways of construction with little interest in adopting information technology-related concepts. The measures used mostly in traditional construction depend on human efforts and understanding that are always prone to errors due to fatigue, overloading, monotonous practices, and other factors concerned with the limited output experienced when human labour is the main source of project execution. Since the advancement in Internet facilities, clients have developed an interest in having projects delivered within the shortest possible time as they have access to information regarding construction projects delivered within days in some advanced countries. This has led to environmentalists adopting machine-related technologies to accelerate project execution while simultaneously saving cost, energy, and time. Moreover, buildings are now designed to meet environmental standards in terms of aesthetics, green option, accessibility, flexibility, land use, duration of whole life cycle, and life costing. In order to meet up with this reality, human service is becoming a liability, and engaging drones, robotics, artificial intelligence, and big data, amongst others, are becoming necessary with every construction demand.\n\nThis AHFE Conference track will provide, through the scholarly work submitted and published, an understanding of various concepts, benefits, and practices that adopting Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies can bring when working towards sustainable construction goals. As digitalization continues to advance rapidly, the pressures on stakeholders in the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry to revamp and restructure their activities and outputs become increasingly prevalent. This AHFE conference series will further provide and venue to discuss the importance of various digital tools and principles to achieve sustainable construction projects. Various standards and concepts will be highlighted on how 4IR technologies could assist and accelerate construction sustainability. The track will link construction management with various digital tools to enhance construction projectsâ sustainability. It will also provide an in-depth insight into the concept of sustainable construction 4.0 across construction professionals, sustainability experts, researchers, educators, and other stakeholders. The track will be dedicated to the publication of research guides, framework, and references on sustainable construction, thus providing a transformed understanding of sustainable projects, digitalization in the construction industry, and the 4IR.\n\nAreas of interest include, but are not limited to those listed here:\n\nâ¢ Augmented/Virtual/Mixed Realities in sustainable construction\n\nâ¢ Big data and the Construction industry\n\nâ¢ Carbon emissions and energy usage in the built environment\n\nâ¢ Changing roles and responsibilities of project stakeholders in sustainable construction projects\n\nâ¢ Circular economy in construction\n\nâ¢ Construction digitalisation\n\nâ¢ Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nâ¢ Digitalisation and construction human resource management\n\nâ¢ Efficient and sustainable use of construction materials\n\nâ¢ Health, safety and well-being of construction workers and end-users\n\nâ¢ Housing affordability and sustainable development problems\n\nâ¢ Indoor environmental quality and management\n\nâ¢ Information modelling and Digital Twin Technology (BIM, BrIM, CIM, GIS)\n\nâ¢ Innovative Building Materials for sustainable construction\n\nâ¢ Innovative Building Technologies for sustainable construction\n\nâ¢ Innovative financing of sustainable infrastructure\n\nâ¢ Land use planning and sustainable development\n\nâ¢ Material management and environmental concerns\n\nâ¢ Material re-use in infrastructure development\n\nâ¢ Pollution in the urban environment\n\nâ¢ Regulatory Framework for and Government Initiatives\n\nâ¢ Sustainable building design and refurbishment\n\nâ¢ Sustainable supply chain management and procurement strategies in construction\n\nâ¢ Sustainable waste management â¢ Sustainable construction practices\n\nâ¢ Value management and sustainable practice\n\nâ¢ Green Buildings Development\n\nâ¢ Sustainable Green Building stakeholders management\n\nâ¢ Alternative building systems\n\nâ¢ Innovation in the built environment\n\nâ¢ Alternative power supply systems\n\nâ¢ Re-use of grey water\n\nâ¢ Cost modelling and cost control\n\nâ¢ Short-term insurance in the building industry\n\nâ¢ Policy guidelines for the built environment\n\nâ¢ Life Cycle Costing\n\nâ¢ Sustainable value Management\n\nâ¢ Sustainable Facilities Management\n\nâ¢ Sustainability in Real Estate\n\nScientific Advisory Board\n\nCo-Chairs:\n\nEvangelos Markopoulos (University of Turku), Finland\n\nRavindra S.

Creativity is the key to driving innovation. The purpose of this track is to bring together experts from different areas to show how creativity drives design and innovation so that a wider spectrum of topics related to engineering design, industrial design and ergonomics in design are integrated. This track will help cover all those within and lying in-between the areas of information technology, computer science, social science, systems engineering, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, psychology and others.\n\nInnovation is applying your creativity to come up with a unique idea or solution. It is technological invention, which lets parts do what they could not previously do. Progress depends on innovation and great innovators can get rich. Entrepreneurship, by contrast, is applying the innovation to bring the ideas to life. It is social invention, which lets people do what they could not previously do. Entrepreneurs grasp the opportunity to cash in on the innovation. They build businesses and propel the innovation forward. Progress depends on entrepreneurship and great entrepreneurs get even richer than great innovators.\n\nThis conference track is intended to present both theoretical and applied perspectives.

The recent increase in machine and systems intelligence leads to a shift from interaction to a much more complex cooperative human-system work environment requiring a multidisciplinary approach.\n\nAs Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Social Computing (SC) becomes more prevalent in the workplace environment and daily lives, researchers and business leaders will need to address the challenges it brings. Roles that have traditionally required a high level of cognitive abilities, decision making and training (human intelligence) are now being automated. While this boosts efficiency, decision-makers and human factors and human computer interaction researchers must be mindful to how this could impact the overall user experience. Social computing technologies weave together AI with human behavior, social experiences and computational tools. The added intelligence, social computing and analytical computing power capability, along with the new relationship between humans and technology, contributed to more reliable systems, convenience and efficiency in learning from data repositories to improving system efficiency and reliability. For those with impairments, modern-day technology has transformed their daily living into a journey toward added capability.\n\nHuman Factors in Artificial Intelligence and Social Computing focuses on the cognitive, visual, social and analytical aspects of human factors and ergonomics in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, vision, unmanned systems and robotics, simulation and wearables by considering these four key human factors dimensions:\n\nResponsibility:Who should lead the way to introduction of AI in the process, and what is the long term strategic nature of decisions about AI.\n\nDepth of integration: AI can be used partially to automate a few tasks, or it can be used to automate a full process. AI integration depends on the goals, priorities, resources and values of where AI can contribute to people in process and innovation.\n\nPeople: There is a growing risk that firms will become over-reliant on technology and ignore the value of experience and humans. There is a need to think about how to invest in staff to maximize their potential with technology in a harmonious and enabling role.\n\nTraining: As AISC becomes more integrated in our daily lives, soft skills - such as sensitivity, creativity, visual detection and verbal reasoning, communication, empathy and spontaneity - may become increasingly desirable. Researchers need to make the most of the interplay between personal and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nThe conference addresses a wide spectrum of theoretical and practical topics related to Artificial Intelligence and Social Computing. It provides an excellent forum of combining real experience and research, while examining how we can adapt to machinery and increase technology acceptance, effectiveness, and efficiency.\n\nAreas of interest include, but are not limited to those listed here:\n\nArtificial Intelligence:\n\nAmbient Intelligence\n\nHuman-machine cooperation (HMC)\n\nAdaptive Human-machine cooperation (AHMC)\n\nPervasive computing and ubiquitous computing\n\nContext awareness, and human-centric computing\n\nTechnology readiness and assessment\n\nInternet of Things and connected devices\n\nHuman-machine task integration\n\nMulti-agent Systems\n\nOptimization\n\nData Mining\n\nDeep Learning\n\nExpert Systems\n\nFuzzy Logic\n\nNatural Language Processing\n\nNeural Networks\n\nRobotics\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nComputing:\n\nSocial network analysis, social data mining\n\nSocial computing technologies\n\nModeling human behavior\n\nContext-aware communication\n\nSocial applications\n\nEthical issues related to social computing technologies\n\nOnline community, mass collaboration\n\nSearch engine optimization\n\nDistributed Leadership concepts\n\nTechnology mediated social participation\n\nComputational social science research methods\n\nCognitive Computing\n\nDistributed and parallel systems\n\nEmbedded Computing\n\nHigh Performance Computing\n\nHuman-centred Computing\n\nMobile computing\n\nQuantum Computing\n\nScalable Computing\n\nFuture and Emerging Technology:\n\nBig Data\n\nBlockchain\n\nCyber-Physical Systems\n\nData Analytics\n\nDigital Transformation\n\nInternet of Things\n\nMachine Learning\n\nMobile Applications\n\nSmart Cities\n\nSocial Computing\n\nLearning in Digital and Pandemic Era:\n\nCollaborative Learning\n\nCurriculum Content Design\n\nEducational Systems Design\n\ne-Learning Tools\n\nGamification\n\nMobile Learning\n\nVirtual Learning Environments\n\nWeb-based Learning\n\nAmbient Intelligence:\n\nAffective computing\n\nAgents and Multi-agent Systems\n\nAmbient Assisted Living\n\nContext-aware pervasive systems\n\nData Science\n\nIntelligent Transportation\n\nSensing and Sensor Networks\n\nSmart Cities\n\nSmart Grids and Energy Networks\n\nSmart Healthcare\n\nAI and Security:\n\nBiometrics\n\nCryptography\n\nInternet Security\n\nIntrusion Detection\n\nMachine Vision:\n\nAugmented Reality\n\nBrain-Machine Interface\n\nComputer Vision\n\nGeographic Information Systems\n\nHuman Computer Interaction\n\nImage Processing\n\nMedical Diagnosis\n\nSegmentation Techniques\n\nScientific Advisory Board Chair:\n\nRonald Boring (Idaho National Laboratory), USA\n\nBoard Members:\n\nHarold Blackman (Boise State University), USA\n\nY.

Yet, as pervasive and important as human error is, the study of human error has been fragmented into many different fields. In fact, in many of these fields, the term âhuman errorâ is considered negative, and terms such as human variability or human failure are preferred. Across differences in terminology and approach, the common link remains an interest in how, why, and when humans make incorrect decisions or commit incorrect actions. Human error often has significant consequences, and a variety of approaches have emerged to identify, prevent, or mitigate it. These different approaches will find a unified home in this conference.\n\nThe purpose of the AHFE International Conference on Human Error, Reliability, Resilience, and Performance (HERRP) is to bring together researchers and practitioners in different fields who broadly share the study of human error. The HERRP conference is intended to serve as an umbrella for human error topics by providing an annual forum for otherwise disjoint research efforts. As such, the conference is intended to complement but not replace existing specialized forums on particular facets of human error. The HERRP conference is distinctly interdisciplinary, encouraging the submission of papers in focused technical domains that would benefit from interaction with a wide human factors audience. Additionally, the HERRP conference provides a yearly, high-quality, archival collection of papers that may be readily accessed by the current and future research and practitioner community.\n\nWe invite papers related to a broad range of topics on human error, including but not limited to:\n\nHuman performance\n\nHuman variability\n\nHuman reliability analysis\n\nHuman performance shaping factors\n\nRoot cause analysis\n\nAccident investigation\n\nHuman resilience and resilience engineering\n\nHigh reliability organizations\n\nSafety management\n\nMedical error\n\nDriver error\n\nPilot error\n\nAutomation error\n\nDefense in depth\n\nErrors of commission and omission\n\nHuman error taxonomies and databases\n\nHuman performance improvement and training\n\nCognitive modeling of human error\n\nQualitative and quantitative risk assessment\n\nContributions may encompass empirical research studies, original reviews, practical case studies, meta analyses, technical guidelines, best practices, or methods. Papers may encompass traditional topics of human error such as found in the safety critical industries like process control, transportation, and medicine. We also encourage innovative explorations of human error such as security, defense, new human-technology interactions, and beneficial uses of human error.\n\nScientific Advisory Board Chair:\n\nAmic G.

Currently, people expect communication to be an exciting and interactive experience. Therefore, to provide such enjoyable and stimulating experiences, researchers in the discipline of communication design have identified that human factors could enrich communication of design and optimize design experience. They have initiated investigations on humanistic approaches, including the roles of human needs, emotions, thoughts, and actions, and have revealed more innovative approaches based on visuals. Furthermore, these types of connections influenced usersâ experiences in design consumption. Such experiences generally exerted a considerable effect on usersâ satisfaction toward the designs. Considering human factors in the communication of design enables designers to be actively connected with human needs. The exploration of human factors and design in the past decades is an appropriate and valuable opportunity to enrich and strengthen the field of communication design from the perspective of human factors.\n\nStudies on human factors have been integral to emotions and user experiences; concerns of human factors can be integrated with communication design to develop a particularly valuable process and solution. Accordingly, human factors are expected to be the major factor driving the discipline to develop design solutions that intentionally fulfil usersâ needs and desire by creating new experiences. On the basis of the preceding discussion, the aim of this conference is to explore the various methods of enriching the communication of design by considering human factors. By integrating human factors, practitioners can develop new insights into enriching the communication of design to an innovative spectrum.\n\nAreas of interest include, but are not limited to, those listed here:\n\nâ¢ Mobile graphics & interface design\n\nâ¢ Designing experience\n\nâ¢ Communication of design\n\nâ¢ Empathetic & Emotion\n\nâ¢ Interactive & interaction design\n\nâ¢ Creative process & practices\n\nâ¢ Designing culture\n\nâ¢ Digital art & computer graphics\n\nâ¢ Research methods in design communication\n\nâ¢ Algorithms, geometry & graphics\n\nâ¢ Multimedia & web design\n\nâ¢ Information design & data visualization\n\nâ¢ Advertising & media\n\nâ¢ Animation & motion\n\nâ¢ Image, video design & processing\n\nâ¢ Experiential graphics\n\nâ¢ Creative education\n\nâ¢ Art & design for society\n\nâ¢ New media & creative art\n\nâ¢ Art & design technology\n\nScientific Advisory Board Co-Chairs:\n\nLucas Paletta (DIGITAL â Institute for Information and Communication Technologies), Austria\n\nBoard Members:\n\nHanan A.

Cognitive computing simulates human thought processes in a computerized model.\n\nCognitive Computing and Internet of Things involves self-learning systems that use pattern recognition, data mining, and natural language processing to mimic the way the human brain works. The goal of the cognitive computing research is to create automated systems that are capable of solving problems without requiring direct human assistance. Cognitive computing is used in numerous artificial intelligence (AI) applications, including expert systems, natural language programming, neural networks, robotics and virtual reality.\n\nThe aim of the conference is to help redefining the nature of the relationship between people and their increasingly pervasive digital environment. Systems based on human reasoning may play the role of assistant or coach for the user, and they may act virtually autonomously in many problem-solving situations. Future aspects of Cognitive Computing and Internet of Things are projected to include: Language-processing, image-recognition, and reasoning services to power these breakthrough applications that scale up human-like analysis. Cognitive Computing and Internet of Things utilizes sentient computing, a common use of the sensors to construct a world model which allows location-aware or context-aware applications to be constructed.\n\nAreas of interest include, but are not limited to, those listed here:\n\nâ¢ Augmented Virtual Reality\n\nâ¢ User Guidance\n\nâ¢ Predictive Analytics\n\nâ¢ IBM Watson Applications\n\nâ¢ Consumer-Behavior Analysis\n\nâ¢ Personalization and Assistance\n\nâ¢ Sentient computing (using sensors to perceive the environment)\n\nâ¢ Internet of things (IoT)\n\nâ¢ Specialized Deep Learning on Big Data sets\n\nâ¢ Generalized Artificial Intelligence systems\n\nScientific Advisory Board Chair:\n\nVesa Salminen (HÃ¤me University of Applied Sciences), Finland\n\nBoard Members:\n\nNeeta Baporikar (NUST), India\n\nTibor Barath (Aquitas), Hungary\n\nKarine Berthelot-Guiet (Sorbonne Universite), France\n\nYoon Chang (Pratt Institute), South Korea\n\nRebecca DeCoster (BRUNEL), UK\n\nStanislaw Glazek (FUW), Poland\n\nAmna Javed (Japan Advanced Insitutte of Science and Technology), Japan\n\nHenrijs Kalkis (University of Latvia), Latvia\n\nJussi Kantola (University of Turku), Finland\n\nMomoko Kitada (World Maritime University), Sweden\n\nYoshiki B.

The conference targets practical approach to facilitate the process of achieving excellence in the management and leadership of organizational resources, allowing faster learning and development of business, economic, environmental- friendly and social renewal based on the shared value thinking.\n\nShared value in business has been defined so that it covers the economic value creation inside a company as well as creating value for society according to its needs, demands, risks and challenges continuously creating sustainable growth. The objective is to achieve economic success through company activities so that all the stakeholders get their own share. In this way, shared value can be seen as a creative means for meeting sustainable social requirements as well as an important concept to develop company democracy. The implementation of practical organizational resource management methodologies and methods aims to reduce complexity of related to management and leadership. This conference aims to present approaches, methods and technologies to tackle this complexity. We encourage authors to explore new practical ways from human, business and societal point of view.\n\nAreas of interest include, but are not limited to those listed here:\n\nContinuous change in business on digital transformation\n\n- Sustainable growth\n\n- Strategy creation and development\n\n- Digital ecosystems\n\n- Knowledge creation and learning\n\n- Corporate team innovation\n\n- Value creation and competitive advantage\n\n- Principles on sharing data in networked business\n\n- Human and data-oriented interoperability\n\n- Data- based business architecture (Industry 4.0)\n\n- Human oriented ecosystem development (Society 5.0)\n\nDevelopment of human capital\n\n- Team management and leadership\n\n- Digitalization and multidisciplinary teamwork\n\n- Social support in interdisciplinary teamwork\n\n- Organizational commitment and leadership\n\n- Entrepreneurship in network environment\n\nManagement and leadership of company and organizational cultures\n\n- Organization culture in business transformation\n\n- Sustainable growth culture\n\n- Innovation and development culture\n\n- Democratic social organization culture\n\n- Networking and ecosystem development culture\n\nScientific Advisory Board Co-Chairs:\n\nAlexandra Medina-Borja (National Science Foundation), USA\n\nKrystyna Gielo-Perczak (University of Connecticut), USA\n\nBoard Members:\n\nPaulo Bonato (PARTNERS), USA\n\nRalph Brewer (US Army Research Laboratory), USA\n\nGloria Calhoun (Air Force Research Laboratory), USA\n\nReece Clothier (RMIT), Australia\n\nNancy Cooke (Arizona State Univ), USA\n\nLinda Elliott (DEVCOM Data Analysis Center), USA\n\nKatia Estabridis (US Navy), USA\n\nDaniel Ferris (UMICH), USA\n\nJanusz Fraczek (PW), Poland\n\nJoseph W.

The efforts aim to change how humans operate the vehicles by reducing the number of personnel hours and dedicated resources necessary to execute the systems.\n\nThe growing use of unmanned systems across all military and commercial sectors is the direction of the future. Optimizing human-robot interaction is critical because the farther removed the operators are from the system, the more important their ability to intervene becomes. Along the same lines, the fewer the number of people involved in a systemâs operation, the more important each individual becomes. Researchers are developing theories as well as prototype displays that could be built into actual systems.\n\nBecause humans tend to be the most flexible part of âunmannedâ systems, the Human Factors and Unmanned Systems focus considers the role of the human early in the development process in order to create the best functional devices.\n\nAreas of interest include, but are not limited to those listed here:\n\n- Automation issues and robotics\n\n- Consequences of degraded reliability of automated unmanned functions for performance of the automated task and of concurrent tasks\n\n- Applications of robots and robotics in surgical and medical procedures\n\n- Perceptual and cognitive issues in unmanned systems and robotics\n\n- Role of augmented reality displays or synthetic vision systems to successfully compensate for the degraded visual imagery provided by onboard sensors\n\n- Multimodal display technology applications to compensate for the dearth of sensory information available to a unmanned vehicle operator\n\n- Extent to which displays and controls can be standardized across unmanned systems?\n\n- Predictable autonomous behavior for unmanned system following a loss of communications\n\nScientific Advisory Board Chair:\n\nJay Kalra (University of Saskatchewan), Canada\n\nBoard Members:\n\nClare Dallat (Outdoor Education Group), Australia\n\nChi-Wen Lung (Asia University), Taiwan\n\nRoman Maciej Kalina (OP), Poland\n\nDamian Morgan (Federation Business School), Australia\n\nTimothy Neville (USC), Australia\n\nEduardo Salas (Rice University), USA\n\nDaniel Simmons (CCD), UK\n\nScott Talpey (Federation University), Australia\n\nGuy Walker (Heriot Watt University), UK\n\nPatrick Waterson (Loughborough University), UK\n\nAbout the Track:\n\nHuman Factors in Sports and Outdoor Recreation aims to address the critical cognitive and physical tasks which are performed within a dynamic, complex, collaborative system comprising multiple humans and artifacts, under pressurized, complex, and rapidly changing conditions that take place during the course of any sporting event.\n\nHighly skilled, well-trained individuals walk a fine line between task success and failure, with only marginally inadequate task execution leading to loss of the sport event or competition. This conference promotes cross-disciplinary interaction between the human factors in sport and outdoor recreation disciplines and provides practical guidance on a range of methods for describing, representing, and evaluating human, team, and system performance in sports domains.\n\nTraditionally, the application of human factors and ergonomics in sports has focused on the biomechanical, physiological, environmental, and equipment-related aspects of sports performance. However, various human factors methods, applied historically in the complex safety critical domains, are suited to describing and understanding sports performance. The conference track welcomes research on cognitive and social human factors in addition to the application of physiological ergonomics approaches sets it apart from other research areas.\n\nAreas of interest include, but are not limited to those listed here:\n\nData Collection,\n\nTask Analysis,\n\nCognitive Task Analysis,\n\nUnderstanding Sports Performance,\n\nAddressing Sport and Competition Challenges,\n\nHuman Error Identification,\n\nSituation Awareness Measurement,\n\nWorkload Measurement,\n\nTeam Performance Assessment, and\n\nInterface Evaluation Methods.\n\nScientific Advisory Board Co-Chairs:\n\nRon Boring (Idaho National Laboratory), USA\n\nRobert McDonald (Institute for Energy Technology), Norway\n\nBoard Members:\n\nSaif Al Rawahi (PDO), Oman\n\nRonald Boring (INL), USA\n\nPaulo Carvalho (Instituto de Engenharia Nuclear), Brazil\n\nSacit Cetiner (ORNL), USA\n\nDavid Desaulniers (NRC), USA\n\nGino Lim (UH), USA\n\nPeng Liu (Tianjin University), China\n\nEsau Perez (CHEVRON), USA\n\nLauren Reinerman-Jones (Southwest Research Institute and Defense Acquisition University), USA\n\nKristiina SÃ¶derholm (FORTUM), Finland\n\nAbout the Track:\n\nHuman Factors in Energy focuses on the Oil, Gas, Nuclear and Electric Power Industries and aims to address the critical application of human factors knowledge to the design, construction and operation of oil and gas assets, to ensure that systems are designed in a way that optimizes human performance and minimizes risks to health, personal or process safety, or environmental performance. The conference focuses on delivering significant value to the design and operation of both onshore and offshore facilities\n\nEnergy companies study the role of human behavior for safety and accident prevention, however, third party providers and different operators have different standards and different expectations. While oil and gas exploration and production activities are carried out in hazardous environments in many parts of the world, offshore engineers are increasingly taking human factors into account when designing oil and gas equipment. Human factors such as machinery design, facility and accommodation layout and the organization of work activities have been systematically considered over the past twenty years on a limited number of offshore facility design projects to minimize the occupational risks to personnel, support operations and maintenance tasks and improve personnel wellbeing.\n\nDespite the existence of these guidance and recommended design practices, and documented proof of their value in enhancing crew safety and efficiency, human factors is still not well understood across the industry and application across projects is inconsistent. Many human factors risks arise from errors or misunderstandings about the ways people think and reason about the situations they are facing and the risks involved; they are cognitive in nature. In order to reduce these risks, safety professionals need to know the important contribution that cognitive issues make in process safety and environmental incidents.\n\nBetter understanding for human factors issues also support the nuclear industry's move from analog to digital control rooms. Human considerations like lighting, temperature, even ergonomics, play important parts in the design. Human factors considerations are part of the Nuclear Regulatory Commissionâs assessment of nuclear plant design and the licensing of its operators.\n\nAreas of interest include, but are not limited to those listed here:\n\nDesign of control rooms and facilities\n\nScreening to define requirements at concept stage of a project life-cycle\n\nFront End Engineering Design (FEED)\n\nAssessment of Valve Criticality Analysis (VCA), Vendor Package Screening, Task Analysis (TA), Human Machine Interface (HMI)\n\nControl room requirement analysis including alarm management and control room systems reviews\n\nOffshore transport\n\nCompliance with project HFE requirements\n\nDevelopment and review of procedures by systematically improving accuracy, readability and usability\n\nUnderstanding the human contribution to accidents by using analytical investigation techniques to ensure human factors are fully considered when identifying the root causes of incidents and accidents; reviewing incident and accident data\n\nIdentify high priority and systemic human and organizational root causes for remediation\n\nSituation awareness\n\nCognitive bias in decision-making\n\nInter-personal behavior\n\nAwareness and understanding of safety-critical human tasks\n\nScientific Advisory Board Chair:\n\nJay Kalra (University of Saskatchewan), Canada\n\nBoard Members:\n\nSergey Belov (IBM), Russia\n\nOthmane Bouhali (Texas A&M University at Qatar), Qater\n\nHenry Broodney (IBM), Israel\n\nPaul Fechtelkotter (IBM), USA\n\nFrida Fischer (University of Sao Paulo), Brazil\n\nShinâichi Fukuzumi (NEC Corporation), Japan\n\nClÃ¡udio Henrique Grecco (Instituto de Engenharia Nuclear â IEN), Brazil\n\nNicole Jochems (RWTH-AACHEN), Germany\n\nPrakash Kanade (LeenaBOT Robotics) USA\n\nGino Lim (UH), USA\n\nDavid Long (VITECHCORP), USA\n\nMasaaki Mochimaru (AIST), Japan\n\nChris O'Connor (IBM), USA\n\nCezary OrÅowski (Technical University of Gdansk), Poland\n\nHamid Parsaei (Texas A&M University, Qatar), Qatar\n\nStefan Pickl (UniversitÃ¤t der Bundeswehr MÃ¼nchen), Germany\n\nSreekanth Ramakrishnan (IBM), USA\n\nJose San Martin Lopez (VA-Center for Applied Systems Engineering), Spain\n\nKrzysztof Santarek (Warsaw University of Technology), Poland\n\nMohd Shahir Liew (PETRONAS), Malaysia\n\nDuncan Speight (IBM), UK\n\nMartin Stenkilde (KANON), Sweden\n\nTeodor Winkler (POLSL), Poland\n\nHazel Woodcock (IBM), UK\n\nAbout the Track:\n\nThe AHFE International conference on Human Factors in Service, Software and Systems Engineering provides a platform for addressing challenges that both pushes the boundaries of current research and responds to new challenges, fostering new research ideas.

The same is true for offices, production lines, many other workplaces and vehicles. All of them have to be designed in order to match characteristics, capabilities and competencies of a variety of future users. Relevant aspects refer to physical (i.e. anthropometry, biomechanics, mobility and reach, posture, and physical performance), and cognitive (information processing, behavior, error) aspects. The overall complexity requires software aids or ergonomic tools and methodologies for consideration in early system design phases.\n\nDigital Human Models (DHMs) are software tools which provide access to complex anthropometric and biomechanics databases, and allows the ergonomists to make appropriate design evaluation or recommendations.. They facilitate the use of body dimensions and shape, human postures and motions, human physical performance and their variability. In addition to physical accommodation and performance, they allow analyses of vision, comfort and workload (both physical and cognitive). Other models also exist to process optimization, and hazards such as thermal and radiation. DHMs have become more powerful recently. Intelligent Human Models or Virtual Humans have become more popular for gaming, education, and training. In these models, Virtual Environments, and the appearances of humans and their behavior are becoming more realistic than before. New developments in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) are also leading us to new approaches for a comprehensive three dimensional realistic models.\n\nThe AHFE DHMAO conference covers the broad areas of both research and applications of these simulation models for aviation, manufacturing and production industries, and addresses issues ranging from anthropometric and biomechanical DHMs to VR/AR based avatars in gaming.

Physical ergonomics involves the design of working environments to fit human physical abilities. By understanding the constraints and capabilities of the human body and mind, we can design products, services and environments that are effective, reliable, safe and comfortable for everyday use.\n\nThis conference track focuses on human body's responses to physical and physiological work demands. Repetitive strain injuries from repetition, vibration, force, and posture are the most common types of issues, and thus have design implications. Physical ergonomics is concerned with the study of the users, which involves understanding their physical characteristics, capabilities, limitations, and motivations. Study of jobs or tasks includes assessing the technical systems, work processes, workstations/equipment, and tools. Areas of focus in physical ergonomics include the consequences of repetitive motion, materials handling, workplace safety, and comfort in the use of portable devices, design, working postures, and the work environment.\n\nA thorough understanding of the physical characteristics of a wide range of people is essential in the development of consumer products and systems. Human performance data serve as valuable information to designers and help ensure that the final products will fit the targeted population of end users. Mastering physical ergonomics and safety engineering concepts is fundamental to the creation of products and systems that people are able to use, avoidance of stresses, and minimization of the risk for accidents. The conference track on physical ergonomics & human factors focuses on the advances in the physical HF/E, which are a critical aspect in the design of any human-centered technological system."
