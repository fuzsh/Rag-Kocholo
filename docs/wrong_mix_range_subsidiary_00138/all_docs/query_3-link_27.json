No matter what type of project we work on, we first communicate with stakeholders to understand the landscape, then combine a community’s vision with good data and best planning practices to ensure that we are approaching each problem in a way that will bring about attainable outcomes and lasting change.\n\nOur planners are passionate about making communities work better. We are driven, curious and committed to finding the best solutions for our client communities. Each of our planners has worked in the public sector and can understand and work as partners to local government staff. Our experience working with stakeholders as well as elected and appointed bodies in myriad localities helps us facilitate smooth planning and land use processes and create plans that all parties can see themselves in. We believe a plan should be accessible to all readers and should be compelling enough to be used regularly by all parties engaged in developing a locality’s future."
