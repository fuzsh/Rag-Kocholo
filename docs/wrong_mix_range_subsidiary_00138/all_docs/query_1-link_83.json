        "text": "Identify business use cases for analytics\n\nReview big data complexities\n\nCapture end-user responsibilities and skills\n\nPrioritize functional requirements\n\nSpecify non-functional technical requirements\n\nEstimate costs beyond pricing\n\nEvaluate platform types and products\n\n1. Identify business use cases for analytics\n\nMany businesses strive to be data-driven organizations and use data, predictive analytics, and machine learning models to aid decision-making. This overarching goal has driven several use cases:\n\nEmpower business people to become citizen data scientists, accelerate smarter decision-making, and perform storytelling through data visualizations, dashboards, reports, and other easy-to-build analytics capabilities.\n\nIncrease the productivity and capabilities of professional data scientists throughout the machine learning lifecycle, including performing discovery on new data sets, evolving machine learning models, deploying models to production, monitoring model performance, and supporting retraining efforts.\n\nEnable devops teams to develop analytical products, which includes embedding dashboards in customer-facing applications, building real-time analytics capabilities, deploying edge analytics, and integrating machine learning models into workflow applications.\n\nReplace siloed reporting systems built into enterprise systems with analytics platforms connected to integrated data lakes and warehouses.\n\nTwo questions that arise are whether organizations need separate platforms for these different use cases and whether supporting multiple solutions is advantageous or costly.\n\n“Organizations are trying to do more with less and often have to compromise on their data analytics platform, resulting in a myriad of data management challenges, including slow processing times, inability to scale, vendor lock-in, and exponential costs,” says Helena Schwenk, VP in the chief data and analytics office at Exasol. “While business needs will likely dictate which data analytics platform is chosen, finding one that ensures productivity, speed, flexibility, and without sacrificing on cost helps combat these challenges.”\n\nData science, engineering, and dataops teams should review the current data integration and management architectures and then project an idealized future state. Analytics platforms should address both current and future states while considering what data processing capabilities may be needed within the analytics platforms. Below are several important factors to consider.\n\nAre you primarily focused on structured data sources, or are you also looking to perform text analytics on unstructured data?\n\nWill you be connected to SQL databases and warehouses, or are you also looking at NoSQL, document, columnar, vector, and other database types?\n\nWhat SaaS platforms do you plan to integrate data from? Do you need the analytics platform to perform these integrations, or do you have other integration and data pipeline tools for these purposes?\n\nIs data cleansed and stored in the desired data structures up front, and to what extent will data scientists need analytics tools to support data cleansing, data prepping, and other data wrangling tasks?\n\nWhat are your data provenance, privacy, and security requirements, especially considering SaaS analytics solutions often store or cache data for processing visualizations and training models?\n\nWhat scale is the data, and what time lags are acceptable from data capture, through processing, to availability to analytics platforms?\n\nBecause data requirements evolve, reviewing a platform’s data and integration capabilities before other functional and non-functional requirements can help you narrow the candidates more quickly. For example, with growing interest in generative AI capabilities, it’s important to establish a consistent operating model for analytics solutions that may be a source for large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-agumented generation (RAG).\n\n“Integrating generative AI within a business hinges on a solid foundation of trusted and governed data, and selecting a data analytics platform that can adeptly govern AI policies, processes, and practices with data assets is indispensable,” says Daniel Yu, SVP of solution management and product marketing at SAP Data and Analytics. “This not only provides the needed transparency and accountability for your organization but also ensures that ever-changing data and AI regulatory, compliance, and privacy policies will not bottleneck your need for rapid innovation.”\n\n3. Capture end-user responsibilities and skills\n\nWhat happens when organizations don’t consider the responsibilities and skills of end users when deploying analytics tools? We have three decades of spreadsheet disasters, duplicate data sources, data leakage, data silos, and other compliance issues that show how important it is to consider organizational responsibilities and data governance.\n\nSo, before getting wowed by an analytics platform’s beautiful data visualizations or its gargantuan library of machine learning models, consider the skills, responsibilities, and governance requirements of your organization. Below are some common end-user personas:\n\nCitizen data scientists will prize ease of use and the ability to analyze data, create dashboards, and perform enhancements easily and quickly.\n\nProfessional data scientists prefer working on models, analytics, and visualizations while relying on dataops to handle integrations and data engineers to perform the required prep work. Analytics platforms may offer collaboration and role-based controls for larger organizations, but smaller organizations may seek platforms that empower multi-disciplined data scientists to do data wrangling work efficiently.\n\nDevelopers will want APIs, simple embedding tools, more extensive JavaScript enhancement options, and extension capabilities for integrating dashboards and models into applications.\n\nIT operations teams will want tools to identify slow performance, processing errors, and other operational issues.\n\nSome governance considerations:\n\nReview current data governance policies, particularly around data entitlements, confidentiality, and provenance, and determine how analytics platforms address them.\n\nEvaluate platform flexibilities in creating row, column, and role-based access controls, especially if you will be using the platform for customer-facing analytics capabilities.\n\nSome analytics platforms have built-in portals and tools for centralizing data sets, while others offer integration with third-party data catalogs.\n\nEnsure analytics platforms meet data security requirements around authorization, encryption, data masking, and auditing.\n\nThe bottom line is that analytics platforms should fit the operating model, especially when access is provided to multiple departments and business units.\n\n4. Prioritize functional requirements\n\nDo you really need a doughnut chart type, or are pie charts sufficient? Analytics platforms compete across data processing, visualization, dashboarding, and machine learning capabilities, and all the vendors want to wow customers with their latest capabilities. Having a prioritized functionality list can help you separate the musts from the nice-to-haves.\n\n“In choosing a data analytics platform, it is important to think through the full spectrum of analytic and AI use cases you’ll need to support both now and in the future,” says Dhruba Borthakur, co-founder and CTO of Rockset. “We’re seeing a convergence of analytics, search, and AI, and it’s common to filter on some text before performing aggregations or incorporating geospatial search to limit analytics to regions of interest.”"
