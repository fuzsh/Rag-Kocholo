        "text": "In 1989, architect Bruce Taylor, AIA, founded Summit Design in Park City, Utah. Since, Summit Design has developed a reputation for creating unique architectural design solutions specific to the client and to the setting. Summit Design’s residential architecture ranges from luxury mountainside ski-in, ski-out designs to subsidized housing and small living communities. These designs seek to incorporate principles from the “Not-So-Big” housing movement, evident in the carefully planned functional and multi-use spaces scaled for the daily pleasures of life. The designs honor the site and conform to the cycles of nature in their passive solar orientation; attention to prevailing winds; window sizing and placement for views, privacy, light and air circulation; placement of outdoor living spaces; and landscaping for the benefit of framing views both of the residence and from the residence.\n\nServices Provided\n\nBasement Remodeling, Bathroom Design, Building Design, Custom Homes, Drafting, Energy-Efficient Homes, Floor Plans, Green Building, Home Additions, Home Remodeling, House Plans, Kitchen Design, Kitchen Remodeling, New Home Construction, Space Planning, Sustainable Design, Universal Design, Construction Drawings\n\nAreas Served\n\nDeer Valley, Park City, Peoa, SLC, Salt Lake City, Snyderville, Summit Park, Wanship"
