        "text": "This coming February, the Oracle Construction Technology Summit (CTS) will be back for its fourth instalment… and you’re invited!\n\nSo pencil in Thursday 13 February 2020 in Melbourne, Victoria – because it’s going to be a ripper!\n\nLooking toward (and planning for) the future is something all businesses do (or at least, they should be!). But more often than not, we get so caught up in the appeal of future solutions, we lose sight of what’s in front of us. This year at CTS, we’re going to do things a little differently. Yes, we’ll absolutely look ahead at all sorts of emerging technologies – we’ll even bring parts of our Innovation Lab for show and tell! But importantly, we’re not going to overlook the growing number of available digital technology solutions, and instead, we’ll shine a light on them so you can see, first hand, how they can help solve your business challenges today!\n\nAnd just to be clear, this isn’t all about Oracle solutions. Yeah we’ve got some great ones, but CTS isn’t just about us (that’d be a bit one-sided and boring)! This event is all about bringing together the best of the best, from startups to members of our burgeoning ecosystem.\n\nStarting to get excited? You should be! As usual, CTS will provide the opportunity to join an exclusive community of like-minded professionals, discovering how technology is being used to improve the design, delivery, and operation of projects worldwide. We’ll also deliver a more interactive and hands on experience, helping you to better focus your day to understand how modern technologies can be applied now in solving some of the big challenges the industry (and potentially your business) is facing around productivity, innovation and quality.\n\nWith local and international keynote addresses, interviews with industry experts, and the opportunity to share ideas through networking, demonstrations, and workshops – it’s the Construction Technology event of the year not to be missed.\n\nOh, and did we mention British India will taking over the stage at wrap up?! Yes, for real.\n\nDon’t miss out! Tickets are free, but limited. So register NOW!\n\nDr. Allison Stewart\n\nDirector, Precinct Policy & Strategy, Suburban Rail Loop Authority\n\nBiography:\n\nDr. Allison is an experienced capital projects leader, strategist, and academic, and has experience working in the infrastructure, energy, defence, and mega-events industries.

After starting as a cloud-native application in Melbourne in 2000 (before cloud was the term it means today) Aconex grew internationally to be the largest of its kind in the world and supported iconic projects, including Marina Bay Sands, the Panama Canal expansion, Dubai Metro, Hong Kong airport and New York City Hall – all supported by staff in 42 cities around the world. After a successful float on the ASX in 2014, Aconex was acquired by Oracle for $1.6bn in 2018, which is the largest technology acquisition in Australian history.\n\nRob started his career as an auditor for Deloitte and then moved to the world of construction, where he worked for Multiplex on high-rise projects – which exposed Rob to the pain of dealing with the information flows between hundreds of companies on large projects and drove the genesis of the idea for Aconex. Rob has a Bachelor of Commerce and a Masters in Building from Melbourne University.\n\nSteven Brant\n\nSenior Director, Oracle Construction and Engineering\n\nBiography:\n\nSteve Brant is an engineer with a 38 year career spanning manufacturing, production engineering, building & infrastructure life safety and construction & engineering technologies.\n\nSteve studied engineering in UK and migrated to Australia in 1981 to work with William Adams promoting growth of the emerging CNC machine tool industry.
