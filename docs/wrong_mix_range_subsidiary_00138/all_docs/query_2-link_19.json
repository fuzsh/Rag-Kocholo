        "text": "Recently, our marketing team was able to get Summit founder Jim Parker to sit still for a while and give us the full scoop on the history of Summit Design and Engineering Services. Jim had a long path leading to his foundation of Summit—one that continues to shape our firm to this day—and we were very fortunate to hear about this journey in his own words. (He is a busy guy, after all!).\n\nIn the newest addition to our “How I Got Here” blog series, take a walk with Jim Parker as he recounts his humble beginnings, his early ventures into engineering, and the series of events that eventually led to his founding of our firm.\n\nBorn in High Point within the Jim was brought up in Durham. As he launched his professional career, Jim found his way to Hillsborough never left. Check out Jim recounting the tale of how he came to settle down in the town that would eventually become Summit’s birthplace.\n\nWhether he was constructing forts in the woods or trying to design his own golf course, Jim always had a knack for building things. Those passions carried him to North Carolina State University as an engineering major. We will let Jim tell you how he navigated college to become an engineer."
