Our theme of “Korea – An Oracle of Global Trends” continued the exploration of how quickly various Korea-related functional issues play out with global implications. This year, we aimed to provide unique Korea-connected insights into global trends ranging from bolstering deterrence to navigating increasing control of critical technologies like chips to curbing cybercriminals’ revenue generation from crypto theft. Day 1 began with Opening Remarks by KIM Gheewhan (President, Korea Foundation), Eric Rosenbach (Co-Director, Belfer Center), and Prof. Nicholas Harkness (Director, Korea Institute) to formally announce the establishment of a new endowment fund for the Korea Project. The Honorable Dr. PARK Jin (Minister of Foreign Affairs, ROK) delivered Congratulatory Remarks.

Rosenbach teaches graduate courses in policy development, strategy execution, and national security. He leads the Center’s Defense Project and national security fellows program. He also teaches two online courses for HarvardX on managing cyber risk and public sector strategy execution. As the Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Defense from 2015-2017, Rosenbach was one of the senior-most leaders in the Department of Defense. The Secretary charged Rosenbach with managing some of the Department’s most sensitive decisions and ensuring the implementation of transformative changes in the Department’s technology, budget, and talent management. He served as the Secretary’s closest strategic advisor on key policy initiatives, such as the war to defeat ISIS, the “rebalance” to Asia, and the effort to check Russian aggression.

Sanger is a White House and national security correspondent and a senior writer at The New York Times, a CNN national security contributor, and an adjunct lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School. In a four-decade long reporting career for The New York Times, he has been on three teams that have won Pulitzer Prizes, most recently in 2017 for international reporting. His newest book, The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage and Fear in the Cyber Age, and an Emmy-nominated HBO documentary by the same title, examine the emergence of cyberconflict and its role in changing the nature of global power. He is also the author of two Times best sellers on foreign policy and national security: The Inheritance: The World Obama Confronts and the Challenges to American Power, published in 2009, and Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power, published in 2012. He wrote many of the first articles about North Korea’s emerging nuclear weapons program. Returning to Washington, Mr. Sanger turned to a wide range of diplomatic and national security issues, from nuclear proliferation to the rise of cyberconflict among nations. In reporting for The Times and in Confront and Conceal, he revealed the story of Olympic Games, the code name for the most sophisticated cyberattack in history, the American-Israeli effort to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program with the Stuxnet worm. His journalistic pursuit of the origins of Stuxnet became the subject of the documentary “Zero Days,” which made the short list of Academy Award documentaries in 2016. Mr. Sanger was a leading member of the team that investigated the causes of the Challenger disaster in 1986, which was awarded a Pulitzer in national reporting the following year. A second Pulitzer, in 1999, was awarded to a team that investigated the struggles within the Clinton administration over controlling technology exports to China. He has also won the Weintal Prize for diplomatic reporting for his coverage of the Iraq and Korea crises, the Aldo Beckman prize for coverage of the presidency, and, in two separate years, the Merriman Smith Memorial Award, for coverage of national security issues. “Nuclear Jihad,” the documentary that Mr. Sanger reported for Discovery/Times Television, won the duPont-Columbia Award for its explanation of the workings of the A. Q. Khan nuclear proliferation network. That coverage was also a finalist for a Pulitzer. A 1982 graduate of Harvard College, Mr. Sanger was the first senior fellow in The Press and National Security at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard’s Kennedy School. With Graham T. Allison Jr., he co-teaches “Central Challenges in American National Security, Strategy and the Press” at the Kennedy School of Government.\n\nProfessor Woodward Yang is the Gordon McKay Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Harvard University in the Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Science and HBS University Fellow. Prof. Yang’s technical background includes semiconductor device physics, material science, microelectronic fabrication technology, circuit design, computer architecture, signal processing systems, and algorithms. Some of his early technical work included the development and successful commercialization of two disruptive technologies, CMOS image sensors and specialized hybrid memory components which are now found in almost every cell phone and other mobile smart devices. In addition, his other research activities involved the design and implementation of advanced DRAM components, Merged Memory Logic systems, and specialized VLSI hardware for image processing and machine learning systems including one of the first real-time face recognition systems in 1992. For his innovative and pioneering research, he received the prestigious National Science Foundation Young Investigator and Army Young Investigator awards and was selected as IEEE Distinguished Lecturer. Prof. Yang was also the founder and CEO of a DRAM design company for many years in Korea and Taiwan which designed and manufactured special purpose memory products. After working extensively with industry, founding a startup company, and running an international business, Prof. Yang was appointed the first HBS University Fellow in 2008 where he extended his research activities to include exploring and understanding the impact of technology and business-government relationships on industries and economies. In collaboration with Clayton Christensen at the Harvard Business School, they concluded that the semiconductor industry would soon stop following Moore’s Law due to economic rather than technological limits. Over the past decade, this fact is now widely accepted in the semiconductor industry. Prof. Yang has also testified as an expert technical witness in numerous U.S. patent cases related to technology including the high profile Apple Inc. vs. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. case involving the design of smart phones and tablet computers. More recently, Dr. Yang was the founding faculty director of the Harvard Master in Design Engineering which is offered collaboratively by SEAS and the Graduate School of Design. The 2-year, post-graduate professional degree program was created to educate students on comprehensive frameworks and strategies for creating, evaluating, and harnessing innovative ideas and for solving real-world problems with highly dynamic and complex global interconnections.\n\nConsul General YOU Kijun serves in the Korean Consulate General in Boston.
