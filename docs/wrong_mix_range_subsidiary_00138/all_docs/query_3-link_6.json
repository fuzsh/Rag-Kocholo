        "text": "About Us\n\nSince 1997, Summit has grown its core services and developed related disciplines to provide a full range of consulting engineering services to both public and private sector clients. Summit is a compact, yet highly agile firm structured to adapt quickly and offer clients the most current technology, innovative design solutions and comprehensive project management. With offices throughout North Carolina and Virginia, Summit continues to expand its availability and resources. Summit has now expanded to six office locations and has field inspectors and technicians all throughout North Carolina and Virginia. By expanding geographically, we can offer our engineering and design expertise to a greater range of clients.\n\nToday, our firm employs over 200 professionals and technicians across its various disciplines. One out of every four Summit employees has a professional registration (PE, PLS, et cetera). One out of four worked for a state department of transportation before joining Summit, so our professionals are well-versed in public sector procedures and expectations.\n\nSummitâ€™s success, tradition of service, and expansion into new fields of practice have been based on our commitment to helping clients complete all types of projects. These ideals have been the driving force behind the growth Summit has already experienced, as well as the growth we strive to achieve."
