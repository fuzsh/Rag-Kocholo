Randolph Street in Chicago’s West Loop.\n\nStephanie Izard and BOKA Restaurant Group is the owner/developer of the project.\n\nLittle Goat is the brainchild of Stephanie Izard, Top Chef season four winner, and BOKA Restaurant Group and the second restaurant to be opened by the team in Chicago.\n\nAccording to Mark Heffron, Summit’s senior project manager, who is overseeing the extensive renovation, addition and interior build-out to the 820 W. Randolph building, Little Goat will be a multifunctional space. Construction plans include stripping the 10,000 sq. ft. building down to the bare structure everywhere, the installation of a new custom elevator and adding square footage at the second floor with an addition. The build-out will include multiple custom kitchens, a 100 seat diner, a barista bar with walk-up access from the sidewalk on Randolph Street, a boutique bakery, and a private dining space on the top floor where cooking and bread baking classes will take place."
