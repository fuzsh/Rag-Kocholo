        "text": "Disclaimer: I'm not dCS customer, fan nor I do have any other relation with this or any other vendor or audio market for that matter.\n\nOverall I find this thread as well as posting in dCS topic very sad due to multiple reasons, the most important one is that overall such bashing will have influence on audio manufacturers, especially smaller ones. I came here to discuss music, and the best way to listen to it using different setups. It seems some people come here for a very different reasons and rather primitive entertainment.\n\nI also find it very unethical when reviewers who clearly are making money and are getting other benefits bash a single manufacturer while forgetting one simple things: over the years you guys did nothing to make the review process ethical, transparent and honest. Did you ever published any code of conduct or similar document that you all would follow? I couldn't find one (I'm talking about some YT reviewers for example, some press journalists did at least partially their homework but not all).\n\nI find disclaimers like this: \"The company X send me their product Y for free in exchange for honest review\" a very bad joke and highly unethical.\n\nComing to Golden case it seems some facts got ignored and while I am not judging any side of a conflict since I do not have enough data I think it is fair to bring those things to attention:\n\nGolden is cooperating with Wandla manufacturer and is making money on his social media activities - this is simply a business operation and one who runs a business must expect a legal conflict at some point. Imagine if all entrepreneurs would run to record a YT interview every time when they get an email from another company lawyer.\n\nWandla manufacturer has a legal conflict with Mytek with some serious accusation. It takes a lot of good will and faith or very good insight information that are usually strongly protected by NDAs to start cooperation in such situation.\n\nI wonder how high dCS sales had headphones.com - while I know this is a trade secret, knowing those numbers would really put a proper perspective to headphones.com actions.\n\nLast but not least, at least (pun intended) do not bash head-fi for carrying dCS ads. At least some of us love this place so treat it with respect please. As for reviewers: maybe it is high time to be more transparent and honest. I'm not a reviewer and after some time with different dealers I could get a home demo of almost anything I would like. No need to get all the freebies etc. No need to spend billion dollars on purchases. All it takes is just to be honest... and it takes more than just a will to make a money to be good reviewer and run such business.\n\nWithout knowing all the facts I would strongly advise to postpone with further discussion, since cleary we do not know everything and every component can hurt the innocent whoever it is.\n\nI understand what you are trying to say out of good will BUT:\n\n1. GS's review was in 2021 for heaven's sake. There is nothing more to say here. Nothing at all. Wandla was out of the subject at that time. I highly doubt GS planned this seeing Bartok a future competitor. If there was a misrepresentation here, dCS acted really really late and so childish. What they needed to do was object the review at that time and not violently and unprofessionally like this and also they needed to be quick about presenting facts without writing paragraphs over paragraphs without any proof. If they have proof, they needed to produce that quickly before writing a long statement that means little. The community will most certainly welcome the proofs that they would present. If not, then words mean nothing. This is where a company like dCS disappointed people hence the drama. And did I mention this is happening years after the review. Whether they are right or not, this looks pathetic and sad.\n\n2. I live in Turkey and here we have almost nothing in terms of audio so I have almost no means of demoing equipment. My friends ask me why I write here even though I have no means of buying a dCS or something of that caliber. This is because I need reviewers and also my friends here head-fi to help me decide what I can buy by only research and communication. If this kind of brutal behavior by dCS spreads to other manufacturers there will be no reviewers left, only positive smiley reviewers. Now I'm not saying GS's reviews are all accurate. BUT dCS needed to cooperate with him and if they see something in the wrong, then reveal the truths without threatening him and lying about it. (Did I mention the review was almost 3 years ago?)\n\n3. We also love and use Head-Fi as a means of discussing music and the equipment but we are a community and people can't just let go this kind of wild behavior by any party. If dCS calmly solved their issues with GS in a friendly manner and GS most probably would make a correction statement and edit his video but there is proof that he is threatened with a lawsuit. Reviewers are not official magisterial figures in this industry and everyone knows to take their views with a grain of salt, people are not dumb enough to listen one review and the decide to buy or not buy a 19.000 Â£ (or so) DAC. They do extensive research. I've learned a lot of things here in Head-Fi and the most important thing was to act with kindness and provide help whenever necessary because that's what I've experienced here and we as a community expect manufacturers to act in a similar fashion.\n\nSo the big guy has spoken....\n\nhttps://dcs.community/t/a-response-to-recent-claims-regarding-dcs/6722\n\nso who to believe , is up to your interpretation.\n\nThese people are delusional.\n\nMost of them think the WANDLA GSE was out or imminently in the works at the time of the posting. Then, they believe regardless of the time gap, there remains motive, malice and prejudice for a subjective review for that future endeavor.\n\nMost entertaining, they are coping with \"poor source material\" and \"intersamples over\" as the cause of the dislike i.e. softness/pillowness/lack of leading edges etc.\n\nTurns out his audio files weren't audiophile enough and he should have invested in some anti-vibration pucks and cable risers for his interconnects\n\nAt least one person with the deep pockets cope called out what I said was going to happen; the Wandla at 3k and the Bartok at 15k \"aren't in the same league\" So why go after him? Because competition and a multi year grudge. They think they can substantively link the poor review to loss of revenue against a competitor with a 'similar product in function' but refuse to name Ferrum in the suit for impropriety.\n\nThere is nothing in the youtube review which could be actionable and the voice memo, while speculative, was not for public release.\n\nI literally found a leaked Chord internal memo ON THIS WEBSITE FOR PDF DOWNLOAD marked \"CONFIDENTIAL NOT FOR THIRD PARTY RELEASE\" where Rob Watts dunks on the ring dac implementation as inferior to their FPGA pulse array and an issue solved/surpassed in the mid-90's. Where's the lawsuit for defamation against Chord?\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not dCS customer, fan nor I do have any other relation with this or any other vendor or audio market for that matter.\n\nOverall I find this thread as well as posting in dCS topic very sad due to multiple reasons, the most important one is that overall such bashing will have influence on audio manufacturers, especially smaller ones.

Your 1st and 2nd points are a stretch and without merit to the issue at hand.\n\nYou paint all reviewers in the same light as disingenuous and conflicted.\n\nI would like to chime in on this situation and add some outside commentary from the consumer tech industry and also working in the Hi-Fi industry. I have worked with some of the largest consumer technology brands in the world and still do and actually was discussing this fiasco with a veteran PR audio representative and as well a well-respected CEO of a luxury audio brand. Some of these opinions are those of my own and not necessarily theirs and I will not disclose who made what comments. During conversation I will speak for myself but add some context to what their general thoughts were as I felt it was a very interesting conversation. This will be a tldr post.\n\nDisclaimer here. I do not know GS and I have never had the pleasure to meet him but I am a fan of his work and I regard his work to be that of the highest quality. We all are human and capable of making mistakes however, but I think he is one of the finest reviewers in the audio industry.\n\ndCS Is not a company I have worked with ever and I had very high thoughts of their equipment based on their build quality and the general reviews of their products but have never had any personal interactions or business interactions with the company.\n\nI was astonished by the video from GS. And claims he made. It certainly was made to sound like DCS had an axe to grind and they were going to grind it. I do believe that GS made a fair review and that dcs's response stepped across the boundaries. It does sound like there was a lot of miscommunication though on both sides. It doesn't sound like there was any constructive dialogue done in person between GS and DCS to clear the air. I think there was a lot of emails that went back and forth and unfortunately a lot gets lost in the translation of emails and the messaging can get very blurred. DCS definitely was playing very strong-handed and continued to do so for way too long. This happened back in 2021 and to still be chasing GS about this review made them look very Petty.\n\nHaving dealt with these situations before, I've never seen a company with an hacks to grind such as DCS displayed here. Especially their continuation of chasing and beating a dead horse. The product was long ago dead and buried and needed to be left alone and walk away. You cannot control the narrative or someone's opinion. Right or wrong they can hear you out, but they don't necessarily have to change anything in their reviews unless they feel like you have valid points and they are being corrected and they feel like they want to make those changes. If those claims are false, well all you can do is ask for a change. To pester and badger a reviewer about a review that is 3 years long. Reminds me of somebody stalking someone. I'm surprised they didn't take a restraining order out against DCS.\n\nDcs just needed to move on.\n\nI did watch GS's Review of the product and I think he pointed out some valid concerns with the product and based on his knowledge I don't feel that it is unfair. He is very educated on the technology and I almost question if he knows the technology better than the engineers. That's another conversation. He makes valid claims that could have easily been addressed in emails and they could just agree to disagree. GS also went on to make several favorable points about the product as well at the same time and it was not a complete bashing of the product. I think it was more about that at that price point and the concerns he had. He couldn't recommend it based on that. Which is totally fair from his perspective. What? I didn't like about gs's review in dcs's defense. Is that maybe GS carried on a bit too much in explaining the problems he had with the product. He did go above and beyond and at links to point out the flaw and repetitively kept going at it. It and explained well beyond. Think what was needed. He could have made the same points and gotten them across. And gave his reasoning without emphasizing it as much as he did. There are flaws in every product and no product is perfect. And as a reviewer it is important that you do give proper criticism and feedback. But at the same time it's unnecessary to go above and beyond and to make it the majority of your video. I think the same effect could have took place without as detailed information and lengthy information that GS went to. Maybe it's just he felt obligated that if he was going to make these claims he felt he really needed to back them up 110% and go above and beyond. Explain his reasoning, his point explanation above and beyond what was necessary. So I do find a little fault with GS in that area based on the review.\n\nWell the drama continued and it was like watching a Trainwreck for DCS with their response today. There was no way for them to look good in this situation and you could tell it was not going to go well for them. They tried to do damage control with their statement that they put out and it started off with a lot of excuses which didn't hold a lot of water and then their true color started to shine once again and you could see where the problem was.\n\nWhoever the pr manager is at DCs needs to be fired. If the owner CEO is the one who's dictating The narrative, the pr manager needs to take the higher road and explain to him that we don't need to go down this road as it does not end well and it's not worth the bad press. If the PR manager is the one suggesting going down this road, the CEO needs to fire him. This is just a comedy of heirs and how not to deal with the Press. This is how to turn a molehill into a mountain and what was not a big deal into a big deal. Everyone knows who you are now for all the wrong reasons. They have a very negative opinion opinion of your company now based on your handling of the situation. Whether you are right or wrong has got lost in the message.\n\nUp to now, I've shared my own personal opinions in regards to this matter and I don't think that I've held back any of my words. I do support GS in this and I think DCS was being a bully and have handled things extremely poorly up until their latest message today. They need to just shut up. I can't put it any nicer than that.\n\nSo to my comments in regards to a PR rep. From the audio industry and a CEO of a luxury audio brand. We had a scheduled meeting and obviously this was the Hot topic for today. You don't always get this type of drama being washed out in the public. The pr manager could not believe dcs And how they could let the spiral out of control and all the bad press that it was going to be bringing them and they're worried about what one reviewer said about their product. And now they have an entire industry going to be bad-mouthing their management and their decision making.\n\nThe CEO who has been in the industry for a very long time cannot remember such a fiasco being displayed publicly and how there was no way that they were going to come out favorable and it was embarrassing for the audio industry to have a company behaving so badly.\n\nI am not disclosing them or using their exact words privacy reasons. Just sharing what their general consensus was.\n\nI have dealt with these situations with my own company and being in the industry and I cannot remember any company in my 15 years of the industry behaving. So ridiculous. I would not want to deal with this company ever again. And being in the audio industry as well now I have a hard time thinking that I even want to go down a road of dealing with any DCS products knowing the type of behavior that their company and management are capable of. At the end of the day they ruined public Image of their company on their own. The damage was self-inflicted. There's no coming back from this. They may have customers who support them and die hard fans that will overlook it but everyone else from the outside looking in is going to have a really hard time siding with them.\n\nAs far as GS is concerned, My advice to him is keep up the good work and stick to your guns and keep doing what you're doing. I only would have suggested potentially that maybe you were more open to a sit-down face-to-face in order to squash things. I know you attempted several times by email but it's like being in a relationship and trying to deal with problems via email or text. I don't recommend it. Sometimes you need an old fashion sit down meeting where people have to book you in the eye and talk to you and try to find calm and ground to make peace. Their tone and rhetoric would have been way toned down if you talked in person and potentially it may have just calmed the water so it didn't blow up. I'm only suggesting that you are no way in fault in my opinion and it was really nice to see the company you work with completely back you up as I would any of my employees in your situation.\n\nI am sorry for the really tldr but as an industry executive of a consumer technology and audio media company I felt it was important. Sometimes people in our industry are afraid to speak up of fear of not getting a review unit or being blacklisted by a company or companies. Companies try that stuff and some get away with it. Once you get blackballed. It is very hard to come back from that. What companies really fail to understand is that as reviewers, we're giving constructive criticism to help improve their product for their next iteration. How to improve on their next version so it is better and they can make a next version that doesn't flop. There is no perfect product ever. The iPhone is never perfect and that's a huge company. The best products in the world are never perfect. There's always something that can be done better. Companies have to realize that this criticism is like free ideas from the media on how to make your product better rather than your engineers. Just trying to guess what needs to be done. Feedback that the media gives to the audio companies is priceless. These media companies are not compensated for these reviews at all and it takes a lot of time, money and resources to put these reviews together. They need to be done independently and fairly and transparent in order to gain the trust of users and readers. Affiliate links and ads on the site from companies don't mean anything to me right? And people think it's excuse the reviews. Well that's a whole other discussion but even if we bash a product somebody still might buy it. So we might as well get a commission for all the money we put into putting a review out of a crappy product that someone's probably going to buy. Anyways. Thanks. At least try and recoup some of our investment into the review. A flawed product. Flawed products do not help. Our brands. GS said he would rather not have to say the things he says because at the end of the day nobody wins when we have to do a negative review. However, it's not his fault that the product is flawed. He's only being transparent about his experience. Gs has done his job well and I and many of the community have a newfound respect for his review abilities and his ethics and I thank him for standing his ground and not being compromised by a company trying to bully him."
