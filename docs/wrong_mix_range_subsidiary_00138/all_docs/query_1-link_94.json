        "text": "Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) today announced fiscal 2024 Q4 and full-year 2024 results. Total quarterly revenues were up 3% year-over-year in USD and up 4% in constant currency to $14.3 billion. Cloud services and license support revenues were up 9% in USD and up 10% in constant currency to $10.2 billion. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues were down 15% in USD and down 14% in constant currency to $1.8 billion.\n\nQ4 GAAP operating income was $4.7 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.7 billion, up 8% in USD and up 9% in constant currency. GAAP operating margin was 33%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 47%. GAAP net income was $3.1 billion, and non-GAAP net income was $4.6 billion. Q4 GAAP earnings per share was $1.11 while non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.63.\n\nShort-term deferred revenues were $9.3 billion. Operating cash flow was $18.7 billion during fiscal year 2024, up 9% in USD.\n\nFiscal year 2024 total revenues were up 6% in USD and constant currency to $53.0 billion. Cloud services and license support revenues were up 12% in USD and up 11% in constant currency to $39.4 billion. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues were down 12% in USD and constant currency to $5.1 billion.\n\nFiscal year 2024 GAAP operating income was $15.4 billion, and GAAP operating margin was 29%. Non-GAAP operating income was $23.1 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin was 44%. GAAP net income was $10.5 billion, while non-GAAP net income was $15.7 billion. GAAP earnings per share was $3.71, while non-GAAP earnings per share was $5.56.\n\n“In Q3 and Q4, Oracle signed the largest sales contracts in our history—driven by enormous demand for training AI large language models in the Oracle Cloud,” said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz. “These record level sales drove RPO up 44% to $98 billion. Throughout fiscal year 2025, I expect continued strong AI demand to push Oracle sales and RPO even higher—and result in double-digit revenue growth this fiscal year. I also expect that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous quarter—as OCI capacity begins to catch up with demand. In Q4 alone, Oracle signed over 30 AI sales contracts totaling more than $12.5 billion—including one with Open AI to train ChatGPT in the Oracle Cloud.”\n\n“Our multicloud cooperation with Microsoft expanded significantly in Q4, as we agreed to work together to support Open AI and ChatGPT—and 11 of the 23 OCI datacenters we are building inside Azure went live,” said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. “As this Azure/OCI cloud capacity becomes available to the large installed base of Microsoft and Oracle customers, it will turbocharge our cloud database growth. Now customers can run any and every version of the Oracle database—Autonomous, 23ai Vector DB, etc.—in both the Azure and the Oracle Clouds. As customers continue to choose and use multiple clouds, Hyperscalers like Microsoft and Google are responding by interconnecting their clouds. Oracle recently signed an agreement with Google to interconnect our clouds—and initially build 12 OCI datacenters inside the Google Cloud. We expect the Oracle database to be available within the Google Cloud in September this year.”\n\nThe board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of outstanding common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 11, 2024, with a payment date of July 25, 2024.\n\nA sample list of customers which purchased Oracle Cloud services during the quarter will be available at www.oracle.com/customers/earnings/.\n\nA list of recent technical innovations and announcements is available at www.oracle.com/news/.\n\nTo learn what industry analysts have been saying about Oracle’s products and services see www.oracle.com/corporate/analyst-reports/.\n\nEarnings Conference Call and Webcast"
