        "text": "Board of Directors Named...\n\nSummit and Viewlogic Schedule Shareholder Meetings to Approve Merger...\n\nMARLBORO, Mass., Feb. 21, 2000 -- Viewlogic Systems, Inc. and Summit Design, Inc. today announced they have selected \"Innoveda, Inc.\" as the name of the new company resulting from their planned merger. In addition, the companies named the Innoveda board of directors and outlined the strategic direction for the new enterprise.\n\nThe companies said their merger registration statement has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Final approval of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including a vote by Summit and Viewlogic shareholders. Shareholder meetings are scheduled for March 20, 2000.\n\nInnoveda (pronounced \"in-no-vay-da\") will market its software tools and services to designers of eProducts (electronic products) used by the computer, communications, aerospace/defense, automotive and consumer electronics markets. Its stock will be publicly traded with the \"INOV\" symbol on the Nasdaq National Market. The company will employ approximately 450 and sell to customers and prospects through direct sales, telesales and distributors in the U.S., Europe, Japan and the Pacific Rim.\n\nInnoveda will have its corporate headquarters in Marlboro, Mass., where Viewlogic is based. William J. (Will) Herman, CEO of Viewlogic, will be president, CEO and chairman. Serving on the five-member board of directors with Herman will be William V. Botts, chairman and interim CEO of Summit; Steven P. Erwin, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Foundation Health Systems, Inc. and a director of Summit; and the other two Viewlogic directors: Keith B. Geeslin, general partner of Sprout Group; and Lorne J. Cooper, president of Sente, Inc.\n\n`Innoveda' Genesis\n\nCommenting on the new corporate identity, Herman said, \"We coined `Innoveda' to differentiate our new company and identify its mission to our industry and customers. It denotes a corporate focus on developing and marketing innovative EDA tools and services that will help engineers visualize, design and build complex electronic systems.\n\n\"Technological advances enabling today's faster, smaller and cheaper electronic systems are creating many problems for global engineering teams. The increasing complexity of these systems forces more up-front system level planning and analysis to prevent major costly problems during downstream design and implementation. The merger of Viewlogic and Summit Design provides an opportunity for Innoveda to become the market leader in design capture, board design, system-level design and electromechanical design,\" he said.\n\nSynergy Benefits Customers\n\n\"Innoveda gets a great head start from the merger of Summit's and Viewlogic's talented worldwide engineering and support organizations, and strong management,\" said Botts. \"This team plans to offer customers a broad set of capabilities for eProduct design through an extensive network of direct and indirect sales channels.\"\n\nAccording to Dan Ganousis, senior vice president of worldwide marketing and consulting services, \"Innoveda's solutions will build on the complementary strengths of Viewlogic's and Summit's premier offerings, and allow Innoveda to address system-level design, which we believe to be one of the areas of fastest growth in the EDA industry.\"\n\nNew Corporate Look\n\nIn rolling out a future corporate identity, Viewlogic and Summit said they have designed a captivating Innoveda logo that uses a gliding curve to bridge innovation and EDA. A corporate advertising campaign introducing Innoveda, its products and services is scheduled to begin in leading EDA trade publications following the closing of the merger.\n\nAbout Viewlogic\n\nViewlogic Systems, Inc., based in Marlboro, Mass., develops, markets and supports a comprehensive family of integrated eProduct design software and services for advanced electronic systems.
