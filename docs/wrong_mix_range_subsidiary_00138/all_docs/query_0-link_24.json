Our Business Continuity Plan is designed to enable us to recover and restore business operations as quickly as possible, safeguard employees and property, protect the our books and records, and assure clients prompt service through alternative offices.\n\nWe duplicate all critical firm, client, regulatory and financial information on appropriate media, and store the backed-up information at remote locations. Such information is regularly sent to off-site storage facilities. From time to time we participates in disaster recovery exercises to confirm that such stored information remains accurate and accessible to us. Among other things, we secure and monitor our datacenter, regulate our data communication lines and maintain and supervise password policies and procedures to limit access to our data.\n\nWe take advantage of the our multistate office system by providing alternate locations from which our employees can temporarily perform essential business functions in the event of a firm or community-wide disruption. The decision to conduct operations from an alternate location will be made as soon as we determine the severity of the business disruption. Provisions have also been made for clients to continue to be able to contact our employees.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\n\nIf you have questions about our business continuity planning, you can contact us at (646) 679-1711."
