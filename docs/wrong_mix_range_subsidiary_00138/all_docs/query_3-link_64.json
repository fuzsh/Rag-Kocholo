Without access to capital, businesses will struggle to expand their operations, upgrade equipment, and hire additional employees. Access to capital is particularly important for small businesses that often lack the financial resources of larger corporations. When a small business can access capital, it can take advantage of opportunities that were previously unavailable, take risks, and pursue ambitious projects that would otherwise be impossible due to financial constraints.\n\nAccess to capital can also help businesses weather economic downturns and recessions. The Financial Services industry constantly evolves to encompass a broad range of business services in today’s environment. This panel will explore key opportunities and challenges and share various innovative solutions and best practices for building your firm’s financial future.\n\nModerated By:\n\nMark Ferguson, Deputy District Director, US Small Business Administration - Illinois District Office\n\nSomerCor | Kimberly Brisky, Managing Director of Communications and Engagement\n\nJP Morgan Chase | Dr. Pamela Randle, V.P.

Many marginalized groups have realized that starting a business may be the most pragmatic route to financial independence and prosperity. Being a successful woman in a male-dominated industry requires audacity, resilience, and unwavering self-belief. But success isn’t about breaking down barriers; it’s about finesse, agility, and navigating the terrain with grace.\n\nJoin us as we celebrate a few of the leading women in our industry responsible for delivering some of the most complex projects that have transformed the landscape and skyline. We will explore how they got here and what it takes to successfully deliver a mega project and hear some of the lessons learned along the way. Learn what tools you need in your toolbox to get involved in these kinds of high-profile projects.\n\nModerated By:\n\nLisa Freelon, Deputy Procurement Officer, Community Engagement | Dept. of Procurement Services & Jana Williams, Assistant Procurement Officer | Dept. of Procurement Services\n\nMCO Construction & Services, INC. / MCO Consulting, Inc.\n\n& National Assoc. of Black Women in Construction (NABWIC) | Ann McNeill, President & Founder\n\nPink Hard Hatz | Sashe Ivy, Owner\n\nChicago Women in Trades | Jayne Vellinga, Executive Director\n\nConstruction Cares, Communities Empowered Through Construction | Rachel Ivy, Executive Director"
