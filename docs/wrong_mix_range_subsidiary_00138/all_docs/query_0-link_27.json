        "text": "This ppt includes speaker notes which you should\n\nreview. Some notes include other references you may\n\nchoose to review\n\nThis presentation was created in November 2002 in\n\nresponse to requests for assistance to Development\n\nfrom various Sales organizations.\n\nThis presentation uses quotes from analyst reports\n\nwhich you CANNOT use in external presentations\n\nwithout express approval from the analyst firm. Please\n\nwork with Analyst Relations to acquire appropriate\n\napprovals. This is very important, please don't damage\n\nour relationship with analysts by using these quotes\n\nwithout approval.\n\nORACLE\n\nPeopleSoft: Weaknesses\n\nPoor coverage in the small/medium markets\n\nRemoval of the 'Customer Service Representative' for all but a handful of large accounts has led to service issues. This used to be a core of PeopleSoft's offering.\n\nPeopleSoft '4 Pillar' (1xCRM, Fins, SCM, HRMS sales rep for every account) sales team leads to fractured, complex approach.\n\nIncreasing size/aggressiveness of PeopleSoft consulting (Professional Services Group) is putting strain on the relationships with some integrators in the larger markets Demos are poor if pushed outside of the 'canned' or pre-scripted demos.\n\nORACLE\n\nbut first...\n\nSelling Applications is a battle. Don't lose before you start!\n\nPeopleSoft has no magical product, they have bugs, product deficiencies, demo disasters, resource and morale issues, account losses horror stories in the press to deal with, just like we do.\n\nYou must believe in yourself and our solution, do the basics right and find a way to position Oracle's relative strengths. If you do this you can win.\n\nORACLE\n\nThe Analysts Say...\n\n\"[Oracle's user interface approach]...allows companies to address the needs of both kinds of user communities. It allows casual and walk-up users to access an application using an HTML only browser, and allows power users to turbo-charge their application environment to address their more demanding work environments.\" Marty Gruhn, Summit Strategies, Inc. Internet Applications: Look Before You Leap, March 2002.\n\n\"[PSFT] Our initial impression was that many casual-user Web pages were very similar to the core user components and therefore were less than intuitive for someone with no prior PeopleSoft experience.\" Giga, PeopleSoft Vendor Assessment, September 2002 - Paul Hammerman\n\nORACLE\n\nThe Analysts Say...\n\n\"Important to the Oracle value proposition is Oracle's architecture for these applications, which is based on a common repository.This removes data reconciliation problems and blurs the lines between back and front office. Accordingly, this takes integration issues off the plate\" idc: Worldwide\n\nHRMS/Payroll, Project Management,and Maintenance Management Applications Suppliers  Competitive Analysis, 2002:What Keeps Them Independent of ERP? -Dennis Byron\n\nAs an ERP II vendor, Oracle offers end-to-end ERP applications sharing the same code base on a unified architecture and single data model. Integration of the core Financials applications among themselves is a benefit, as well as integration and data sharing between Oracle Financials applications and Oracle's Ebusiness suite of SCM, CRM, Manufacturing, Projects and HR applications. For example, a customer account created in Order Capture is the same customer account used in Oracle Receivables, if a customer configures and orders a product through an online ordering function in CRM, a ship date is confirmed, inventory stock is evaluated to ensure adequate supply, price is determined, an invoice is delivered and payment is accepted by Receivables. Gartner: Oracle Financial Management Applications Nov 2003 - Daniel Stang, Gerald Arcuri\n\nORACLE\n\nThe Analysts Say...\n\n\"PeopleSoft's challenge Is to overcome the lack of geographic\n\ndiversity...\" IDC: Worldwide HRMS/Payroll,Project Management,and Maintenance Management Applications Suppliers  Competitive Analysis,2002:What Keeps Them Independent of ERP? -Dennis Byron\n\nPeopleSoft, however, does not have a prevalent global presence matching SAP and Oracle. Gartner: Oracle Financial Management Applications Nov 2003 - Daniel Stang, Gerald Arcuri\n\nOracle financial applications provide multinational support, including local regulatory requirements for 44 different countries, and they provide single-byte, multibyte and bidirectional character sets. In addition to features specific to Japan, Taiwan and Korea, other enhancements support business practices in countries across the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia/Pacific. Gartner: Oracle Financial Management Applications Nov 2002 - Daniel Stang, Gerald Arcuri\n\nORACLE\n\nDemo Points\n\nMany of these points are not best demo'd or will be too complex for the USA audience. However we have some good points to show.\n\nMulti-Lingual (use the shared ADS UTF8 instance to now multiple languages) Demo the 'T' accounts in every Financials demo (the accountants will love this feature!!!)\n\nA Multi-Currency example in the T accounts demos well.\n\nMany examples of Global Demo's available on ADSWeb 'Demo Docs'. Look under the various country areas 'France', 'Germany', etc.\n\nORACLE\n\nThe Analysts Say...\n\n\"Politics aside, the product [Oracle Customers Online] addresses many of the issues that enterprises face in providing high-quality customer access across the organization.\" The Gartner Group, OCO Data Quality and a Single View of the Customer, B.Wood, Oct 2002\n\nIn discussions with Meta Oracle has been told that we are 18-24 months ahead of PeopleSoft on Collections and Credit Management solutions.\n\nORACLE"
