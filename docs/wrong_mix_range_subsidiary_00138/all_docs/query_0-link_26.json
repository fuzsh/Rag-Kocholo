Installed in just five months, the new accounting system includes an online interface that enables the subsidiary to communicate and validate transactions with the bank’s core system using Web services. It also includes end-of-day batch processing through an interface for inventory, fixed assets, purchase orders, and accounts mapping. The new system transfers transaction data at the end of each day from the ERP system to the bank’s core system, which also includes a validation mechanism. Oracle Partner Widestreams, and the bank’s staff—ten of whom attended Oracle training and workshops—completed the implementation in just five months, meeting a mandated deadline to be running for the 2012 fiscal year. BLC Bank was the first Lebanese bank to deploy Oracle E-Business Suite, and its implementation will support the bank’s growth strategy for the next five to ten years."
