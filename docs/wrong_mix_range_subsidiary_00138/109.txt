Overview

Summit Design and Engineering was originally founded in 1997 under the name of Callemyn-Parker, Inc. when CEO Jim Parker and land surveyor Alois Callemyn combined their resources. Operating as Summit since 2004, we have evolved into a compact Design and Engineering firm structured to adapt quickly and efficiently to our client’s needs.

Since the company’s start, we have expanded our catalog to incorporate 14 comprehensive areas of service to our clients. Because of these increased capabilities, we are able to invest talent and skill into each project we take on at every stage of the development process. From the beginning of a project’s design to the end of its construction, Summit has the expertise and experience needed to see each commitment to its conclusion.

Our firm has also expanded geographically to meet our clients where they are located. We have a variety of offices across North Carolina, from our headquarters in Hillsborough, NC, to our branch offices in Raleigh, Charlotte, Fayetteville, Asheville, and Wilmington. Outside of NC, we also have branch offices in Richmond, Franklin, and South Boston, Virginia; Fairmont, West Virginia; Fort Mill, South Carolina; Denver, Colorado; and Tampa, Florida.

Summit Design and Engineering is invested in fostering a workplace that is both caring and collaborative. Our continued growth means that we now employ over 400 people across six states. We hope to encourage commitment to our communities through collaborative efforts that ensure that our employees and clients can succeed together.
