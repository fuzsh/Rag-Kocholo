        "text": "The plastic screws help ensure that your sample holder is held firmly in the stage. They also guarantee that your sample moves the proper amount and is registered properly with the stage when performing sensitive experiments. The screws should not be over-tightened; but loosely threaded into the holes. The nylon material also allows for tilting of the holder when the levelling screws are adjusted.\n\nYes, We offer a service for larger quantities of light sources where we will design light sources for the purposes of our customers. Please see the OEM section of the website for more information on this, or contact tech support.\n\nThe NanoScanZ is a high accuracy focus system designed for high speed fusion (z-stacking) techniques. The NanoScanZ system has up to 1nm resolution and can complete a move in 10 microseconds. Standard focus motors (with and without encoders) are capable of providing Z-stacking up to 0.5um thicknesses with good accuracy, but are somewhat slower than the NanoScanZ.\n\nAn encoded focus is required if the microscope which is being used has a focus mechanism which is not directly connected to the fine focus system, e.g., most Zeiss models. In this case a Z-encoder is recommended to provide a reliable Z-position.\n\nAn encoded focus is required if the microscope which is being used has a focus mechanism which is not directly connected to the fine focus system, e.g., most Zeiss models. In this case a Z-encoder is recommended to provide a reliable Z-position.\n\nAn encoded focus is required for lengthy time lapse experiments where the microscope focus can drift with temperature over time.\n\n1mm ball screws provide a smaller step size which provides a smoother movement, however this slows the overall movement of the stage down by half. If your requirement is for speed use a 2 or 5mm ball screw, if you require smooth and slower movement choose the 1mm ball screw.\n\n400 step motors should be coupled with a 1mm ball screw to provide an extremely accurate and smooth (under high magnification) stage movement. High precision encoders are also a good option to further improve this type of stage.\n\n200 step motors are best coupled with 2mm ball screws to provide a greater movement speed where the accuracy required is sufficient with the ProScanâ„¢III standard stage.\n\nYes, we offer a service for larger quantities of stages where we will design stages for the purposes of our customers. Please see the OEM section of the website for more information on this, or contact tech support.\n\nYes, we have an extensive range of sample holders most of which are not displayed on the Price list or on this website.\n\nIf you have a request please contact tech support and supply details of what you would like to hold and what instrument (and Prior stage) you are using."
