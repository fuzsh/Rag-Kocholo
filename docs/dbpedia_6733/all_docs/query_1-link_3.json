The Institute of Cancer Research is a UK charity and one of the most influential cancer research organizations. This year’s event will focus on AI and how it is enhancing research, providing new opportunities in clinics, as well as ethical considerations. Around 400 ICR staff and students will come together to celebrate their multidisciplinary collaboration and discuss the latest developments in cancer research. In the field of cancer research, Prior is working with numerous partners who are advancing the capabilities of researchers and clinicians via novel imaging techniques, assays, and analysis methods. We are sponsoring the ICR's plenary session ‘Cell and Structural Biology in silico’ and will be available to speak with guests in the poster presentation area. We look forward to seeing you there! #CancerResearch #CancerTreatment #MedicalAdvancements #HealthcareIndustry\n\nVisit our stand at #EUSPEN2024 and speak to us about how we can support you with end-to-end product design and manufacturing. EUSPEN’s mission is to advance and promote the arts, sciences and technology of precision engineering, micro engineering and nanotechnology. This year’s event will be hosted at the University of Dublin in Ireland – come speak to us at Stand 13!\n\nBrixham College’s Oblivion Greenpower Race team made up of pupils from years 8-10, took to the track for their first event of the season at RAF Chivenor this month! We recently sponsored the college's project that aims to engage students in STEM subjects, encourages teamwork, and promotes sustainable transport solutions. The college's STEM Club made great progress in the first race with Oliver Bailey, Jack French, and Freddie Sutton taking it in turns behind the wheel to finish a respectable 11th out of 17 cars. Driver Alex Coombes made an impressive start off the line in the second race before having his racing time reduced by another car rolling on the corner. Second driver Alfie Burton picked up the best lap time for the team before the final driver, Will Godfrey, secured 13th position. The Greenpower Challenge is run by the Greenpower Education Trust, a UK based charity which gets young people enthusiastic about science and engineering by challenging them to design, build, and race an electric car. The next race is on 2nd of June at Castle Coombe - we wish the team the very best of luck!
