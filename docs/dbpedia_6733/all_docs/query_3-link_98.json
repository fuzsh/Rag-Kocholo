        "text": "Students should first look to have a conversation with their roommate where they directly identify the problems they are encountering. It is important to be direct about what behavior is harmful and how it is affecting your student while also working toward compromise. It can be helpful to use “I feel … when you …” type of statements to help your student identify the impact of their roommate’s behavior, while also helping the roommate understand the conflict.\n\nIf a student is struggling with the situation and is unsure of how to address it, students are encouraged to meet with their Resident Assistant (RA) to talk through the situation and possible solutions for the conflict. RAs can also set up a roommate mediation between the two students if struggles persist.\n\nRAs act as the liaison between students and Residence Life within a roommate conflict should further action need to be taken. RAs will advocate on the student’s behalf and help them take the necessary actions depending on the situation and the recommendation of Residence Life.\n\nCommunicate directly with the instructors of each course. Let them know why they are missing class and ask what they may be missing. Blackboard is often a crucial tool for students to use to catch up on missing work as many instructors will upload materials to this site.\n\nIf medical assistance is needed, please take a look at our Health and Safety section above for more information about local clinics or urgent care facilities.\n\nIf a student is seeking medical care or attention and will be missing class for more than a couple of days, please email the Dean of Students Office at deanofstudents@edgewood.edu or call 608.663.2212.\n\nPark in the Visitor Spaces located in the front row of the Regina Parking Lot (next to the Predolin Humanities Building). Then, please register your vehicle with the Campus Assistance Center (CAC) located in the Predolin Humanities Building.\n\nIf there are no visitor spaces available, visitors may park in any available, legal spot. Lots are marked on the campus map, located in front of and beside Predolin Hall as well as the parking ramp next to Sonderegger Hall.\n\nDO NOT PARK in the High School or Campus Grade School lots, Siena, Marshall, or The Stream parking spaces. Parking in these lots may result in being ticketed and towed at the owner’s expense."
