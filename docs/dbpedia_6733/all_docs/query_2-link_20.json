        "text": "Before returning products to Prior Scientific, you must obtain an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization number) using this form. Once we receive the form, we will send you an RMA number and shipping/packing instructions so it can be returned for service.\n\nProviding full and accurate information in the form will help us to process your request quickly and avoid the risk of us not being able to accept your return. DO NOT package and return your equipment before we contact you to confirm the RMA request. Please remove and any glass slides or glass plates from any stages prior to returning.\n\nWe aim to turn around RMAs as quickly as possible but the length of time will vary depending on the product returned and the nature of the fault. It typically takes between 7 to 10 working days to evaluate the equipment, although during busy periods it may take longer.\n\nOnce we have evaluated the equipment, we will send you a quote for the cost of any non-warranty repairs but will not carry out any repairs until you authorize us to do so.\n\nFor all non-warranty RMAs returned to Prior Scientific Ltd, there is a minimum evaluation fee of £300 for systems and £200 for components.\n\nFor all non-warranty RMAs returned Prior Inc. (North & South America), the minimum evaluation fee is $150. Hardware will only be evaluated upon customer request.\n\nPlease note that Microsoft no longer supports Microsoft Internet Explorer, and users are encouraged to upgrade to Microsoft Edge or use other supported web browsers.\n\nTo ensure that Prior and its customers meet all legal requirements for goods sent across borders, all items sent to us must be recorded in both the provided RMA form and the commercial invoice.\n\nAny items sent to us but not recorded correctly may be seized by customs authorities.\n\nPlease contact the technical team (Techsupportuk@prior.com) for further assistance."
