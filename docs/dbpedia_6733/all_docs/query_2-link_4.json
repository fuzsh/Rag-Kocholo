Prior Scientific and Queensgate offer a diversified portfolio of enabling technologies to underpin the high-speed, high-precision positioning requirements of 3D optical metrology systems used in semiconductor manufacturing and applied R&D. Physics World talked to Queensgate product manager Craig […]\n\nQueensgate awarded funding for fourth research project with NPL\n\nPosted on: Jan 29th 2024\n\nQueensgate, a brand of Prior Scientific, has won funding from Innovate UK, the UK’s innovation agency, for a fourth nanopositioning research project as part of Analysis for Innovators (A4I) program (Round 11). This will be the fourth project Queensgate has won funding for through A4I, and once again, they will be working with the dimensional […]\n\nNew ISO certifications demonstrate Prior Scientific’s commitment to improved environmental practices\n\nPosted on: Nov 7th 2023\n\nPrior Scientific is now certified to ISO Environment (14001:2015) and Health & Safety (45001:2018). The company already has Quality Management (9001:2015) which has been successfully renewed. The new certificates apply to Prior’s manufacturing locations in Fulbourn and Paignton in the UK. Adopting effective environment management practices will enable Prior to reduce its environmental impact and […]\n\nWhat is the recipe for success in nanopositioning quality assurance?\n\nPosted on: Jun 15th 2023\n\nAs part of the Analysis for Innovation (A4I) program from Innovate UK, Queensgate has been working with experts in dimensional nanometrology at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) on a number of projects. The first of these investigated parasitic motion/off-axis errors in multi-axis nanopositioning stages and, as a result, developed a unique and practical correction methodology. […]\n\nQueensgate to partner with NPL on third A4I-funded research project\n\nPosted on: May 17th 2023\n\nQueensgate, the nanopositioning expert, has won funding in round 8 of Innovate UK’s Analysis for Innovation (A4I) program. This is their third successful application in the initiative. A4I gives UK businesses access to cutting-edge facilities and world-class scientific expertise to solve problems they are unable to do with standard technologies and techniques. For this project, […]\n\nMeet DESI XS – MS imaging Case Study\n\nPosted on: Apr 24th 2023\n\nPrior Scientific is known for developing and manufacturing cutting-edge microscope automation, working with OEMs and start-ups to help bring their concepts to market. Waters, a market leader in mass spectrometry imaging systems, aimed to offer their customers an enhanced imaging solution that is not only reliable and fast but also durable and user-friendly. This case […]\n\nPrior and NPL collaborate on 3D spatial positioning correction\n\nPosted on: Apr 17th 2023\n\nVideo case study: Prior and NPL collaborate on 3D spatial positioning correction A new video case study from Innovate UK’s Analysis for Innovators (A4I) program explores Prior Scientific’s collaboration with the UK’s National Physical Laboratory (NPL) to devise 3D spatial correction algorithms to increase the accuracy of the long-range Queensgate nanopositioning stages. Prior received funding […]\n\n24-hour gaming challenge set to raise £1000 for rare cancer charity\n\nPosted on: Mar 22nd 2023\n\nPrior Scientific’s Supply Chain Manager, Peter Hall, is undertaking a 24-hour gaming challenge to raise £1000 for two charities: the AMMF and UK Sepsis Trust. Remarkably, this will bring the total that Peter has helped raise for the two charities to almost £10,000. Peter began to raise money for the two charities in memory of […]\n\nThe new NanoCeramic sensor from Queensgate provides nanoscale precision in highly demanding environments\n\nPosted on: Jan 3rd 2023\n\nThe NanoCeramic (NC) series from Queensgate offers high precision positioning in demanding applications. The sensor’s materials and construction make it suitable for use in ultra-high vacuum environments (to 10-9 Torr), in a range of temperatures from cryogenic at 80 K/193 °C up to 423 K/150 °C. The NC series offers measurement ranges from 20 µm to 1250 µm, with frequency […]\n\nNPL and Queensgate collaboration improves spatial correction for multi-axis nanopositioning\n\nPosted on: Nov 29th 2022\n\nNew research paper available As part of the Analysis for Innovators program round 6, Queensgate, in collaboration with the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), were awarded funding for a project to investigate parasitic motion/off-axis errors in multi-axis nanopositioning stages, and develop a unique and practical correction methodology. All moving systems have a certain amount of unwanted […]"
