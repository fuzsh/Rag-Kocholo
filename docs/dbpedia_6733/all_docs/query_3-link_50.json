        "text": "For anyone who has made arrangements to visit LLNL, the first stop is the Westgate Badge Office, located off Vasco Road in Livermore. The Badge Office is open Mon.â€“Thurs. 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Fri. 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nYou will need a badge for admittance to the Laboratory. To receive a badge you must have a valid driver's license or other form of official photo identification, and be prepared to provide your Social Security number. Non-U.S. citizens must present a Permanent Resident Card or valid passport plus visa documentation and all accompanying original documentation. Once issued, you must wear the badge conspicuously at all times while you are at LLNL. The photo side of the badge must be visible, and it should be worn between your neck and your waist. You must turn in your badge at the security checkpoint as you leave the Laboratory.\n\nMembers of the news media should make prior arrangements with the LLNL Office of Strategic Communications before coming to the Laboratory. Using a camera or recording device without prior authorization is prohibited; see LLNL's policies on photography and its rules on restricted and controlled items for more information.\n\nAll types of video recording equipment, including digital cameras, film cameras, camcorders, commercial video recording equipment and any other equipment with video image recording capability, are considered controlled items.\n\nPrivately owned video recording equipment may be brought into (non-classified) Property Protection Areas but must be turned off and secured (e.g., in a locked vehicle or a cell phone garage). They may not be taken into any building, trailer or (classified) Limited Area without a Controlled Items Permit. Any use of such equipment at LLNL requires a Controlled Items Permit.\n\nPhotography/Videotaping by News Media\n\nAll news media requests to bring still cameras or video recording equipment onto the Laboratory site are handled through the Office of Strategic Communications (OSC). OSC will determine what kind of equipment will be used, where it will be used, what will be photographed, the name and citizenship of the photographer, who the escort will be and the dates and times for the photography/videotaping. OSC will then coordinate with the Security Organization and Badge Office to issue a press badge to the approved media personnel. All media will be escorted by OSC staff.\n\nAs a general rule, media are not permitted to bring camera equipment on-site to obtain file footage. Taking shots for file footage (e.g., video or still photos with the Laboratory as background) is permissible from off-site. Existing video file footage of the Laboratory can be requested from OSC.\n\nWhat Can Be Photographed\n\nPhotographing and videotaping within (non-classified) Property Protection Areas of the Laboratory is permitted upon prior arrangement with the LLNL Office of Strategic Communications.\n\nWhat Cannot Be Photographed\n\nPhotographing and videotaping in (classified) Limited Areas is prohibited without prior approval by the LLNL Security Organization and Laboratory management. In situations where such approval has been granted, the area will first be surveyed by Security personnel before any media cameras are allowed in the area.\n\nNeed Assistance?\n\nVisitors may contact their host for assistance."
