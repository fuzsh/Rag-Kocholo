        "text": "Prior Scientific is now certified to ISO Environment (14001:2015) and Health & Safety (45001:2018). The company already has Quality Management (9001:2015) which has been successfully renewed.\n\nThe new certificates apply to Prior’s manufacturing locations in Fulbourn and Paignton in the UK.\n\nAdopting effective environment management practices will enable Prior to reduce its environmental impact and support our Environment and Social Governance (ESG) program.\n\nHealth and Safety management focuses on the identification and control measures of job hazards and potential emergencies. It also includes running an occupational health program as well as training and support for employees.\n\nPrior’s Quality Management certification demonstrates the company’s commitment to quality and includes a strong customer focus, robust process, and continual improvement practices, including Lean Six Sigma.\n\n“ISO standards ensure that the products and services we provide meet certain benchmarks of excellence. They are the building blocks of our reputation, customer satisfaction, and – ultimately – our success,” said Tom Freda, CEO of Prior."
