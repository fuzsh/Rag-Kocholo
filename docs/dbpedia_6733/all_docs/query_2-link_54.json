        "text": "Prior Scientific Instruments, the maker of precision optical and electro-mechanical equipment, has launched a ‘revolutionary’ new Queensgate product.\n\nFulbourn-based Prior acquired Queensgate Instruments in 2018. The Torquay-based company designs and produces performance nanopositioning and measurement systems used in metrology, atomic force microscopy, and lithography, and other sectors.\n\nThe Queensgate brand of nanopositioning solutions for sensors and stages are used in semiconductor, life sciences and additive manufacturing industries, enabling measurement and positioning to sub-nanometre levels of accuracy.\n\nThe new Queensgate product emerged after Prior achieved significant increases in nanopositioning accuracy after working with the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), the UK’s designated institute for measurement standards.\n\nExperts at NPL were able to record the motion of two Queensgate products, collect data based on their errors, and devise 3D spatial correction algorithms to increase the accuracy of the nanopositioning stages. These algorithms reduced errors to 4 per cent and 9 per cent of the original factors.\n\nThe resulting product will assist manufacturers of atomic force microscopes, semiconductors, and 3D printers.\n\nThe project was supported by Analysis for Innovators (A4I), a grant funding programme run by Innovate UK, the UK’s national innovation agency. The programme helps businesses access cutting-edge R&D and expertise of skills and equipment at nine measurement centres across the UK, while also offering grant funding for some or all of the project costs.\n\nPrior approached the A4I programme to improve the accuracy of its nanopositioning solutions. It partnered with NPL, enabling access to specialist 3D metrology equipment and data analysis capabilities.\n\nCraig Goodman, product manager at Prior Scientific, said: “The challenge we were facing is that when you try to move in x, y or z axis, no matter how good the mechanics are, there is movement and errors in the non-moving axis, which is also known as crosstalk. It is very hard to compensate for, especially for longer-range stages.\n\n“So, what we looked at was a way that would efficiently characterise these errors and compensate for them in firmware.”\n\nHe added: “Innovate UK’s A4I programme has enabled us to achieve revolutionary increases in accuracy for our nanopositioning stages.\n\n“The funded access to NPL’s R&D and expertise has achieved a previously unthinkable leap in capability. Its nanometrology and capability to capture data is unmatched and we got to work with their best mathematicians to develop the algorithms to apply to our Queensgate products. This will help us to remain ahead of the curve against our competitors.”\n\nPrior was established in 1919 as a manufacturer of optical microscopes and has evolved to produce precision automation and optical products.\n\nSimon Yarwood, knowledge transfer manager – industrial technologies, A4I at Innovate UK KTN, said: “Prior is a legacy company, but it had limitations and little access to top-quality research and development tools and minds. We helped them bridge this gap and introduced them to NPL, which has world-class skills and unique facilities. NPL’s mathematicians worked on this complex project to yield innovative results.\n\n“The success of the project prompted Prior to submit further ideas for funding.”"
