        "text": "Gatan GIF Quantum LS Imaging Filter with K2 Summit Camera Approaches 2.2 Å Resolution\n\nSingle-particle cryo-electron microscopy is for scientists who want to study DNA, proteins, and other biological molecules at atomic resolution. Researchers have shown that they can achieve resolutions that are good enough to almost visualize the atoms in individual amino acid residues in proteins. Cryo em can now resolve “holes” at the center of certain molecules, a feature typically associated with structures derived by X-ray crystallography at resolutions better than 2 Å resolution.\n\nGatan Inc.\n\nwww.gatan.com/quantumls\n\nRenishaw Adds Raman Analysis to Scanning Electron Microscopy at The University Of Sydney, Australia\n\nDr. Elizabeth Carter is manager of the vibrational spectroscopy core facility at the University of Sydney. This professional services unit houses one of the largest concentrations of state-of-the-art Raman and FT-IR spectrometers in Australia. The research interests of facility users are diverse, and applications include: nanotechnology, materials science, art and archaeology, polymer science, pharmaceutics, environmental, forensics, mineralogy and gemmology, medical diagnostics, disease mechanisms, and other life sciences.\n\nRenishaw plc\n\nwww.renishaw.com/SEMRaman\n\nUCLA Combines Raman Microscopy with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to Study Archaeological Textiles and Fibers\n\nUCLA uses a Renishaw SEM-SCA system to study textiles and fibers non-destructively. A paper published in the Journal of Raman Spectroscopy describes how a SEM may be interfaced with µRS to provide a means of non-destructively identifying organic compounds in complex samples, such as single fibers, by extractionless analysis. This enables the characterization of dyes from reference collections and archaeological textiles.\n\nRenishaw plc\n\nwww.renishaw.com/Raman\n\nXEI Scientific Appoints EM Resolutions as Distributor for the UK and Irish Markets\n\nXEI Scientific Inc, maker of the popular EVACTRON® De-Contaminator™ Plasma Cleaning System, has appointed EM Resolutions Limited as their exclusive distributor for their products in the UK and Ireland. Founded in 2012, EM Resolutions offers a wide range of consumables and accessories for the electron microscopy marketplace. By being able to offer Evactron plasma cleaning, EM Resolutions can help their clients clean and maintain vacuum quality in their instrumentation.\n\nXEI Scientific, Inc. and EM Resolutions\n\nwww.evactron.com\n\nQuick and Accurate Sperm Viability Testing\n\nPrior Scientific reports that its Lumen 100-LED has been integrated by Microptic SL to provide illumination for their Sperm Class Analyser (SCA) system. Microptic’s SCA system is designed to quickly and accurately determine the number of live and dead sperm cells within a sample via fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence illumination for the SCA is provided by the Lumen 100-LED system, with Microptic selecting the single high-performance LED emitting in the ultraviolet range at 365 nm.\n\nPrior Scientific Instruments Ltd\n\nwww.prior-scientific.co.uk//Products/Live-Cell-Imaging.aspx\n\nMarkus Lusser is the New President of Leica Microsystems\n\nMarkus Lusser is the new President and Director of Leica Microsystems, headquartered in Wetzlar, Germany.
