        "text": "Epicor Software, a provider of business software for manufacturing, distribution, retail and services organisations, has announced that Prior Scientific, a UK-based global designer and manufacturer of scientific instrumentation, has selected the Epicor next-generation enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution for greater flexibility in its production planning.\n\nSince 1919, Prior Scientific has offered a wide range of standard, OEM and customised solutions to the scientific instrumentation market. With sites in the UK, US, Germany and Japan, Prior is replacing its ERP solution in order to bring flexibility and visibility to its global production planning and manufacturing, which takes place in the UK. Once live, the company will use Epicor ERP globally for sales, finance, manufacturing and reporting.\n\nCurrently, Prior Scientific says much of its planning and scheduling takes place off-system with meetings held to go through print-outs and spreadsheets used to monitor progress. With the advanced planning and scheduling features in Epicor ERP, the whole process will become real-time and 'in-system', allowing the sales team across the world to propose delivery dates as orders are placed with confidence, before they are executed as part of the production plan at the UK manufacturing site.\n\n'We have been using our current solution for about 13 years, but it lacks the flexibility we now need to prioritise production runs and give customers shorter lead times,' said Stephen Wintersgill, head of IT at Prior Scientific. 'With a constantly growing customer base and range of products, we want to streamline our planning and scheduling to ensure we maintain our competitive position and deliver in the shortest possible timeframe.'"
