        "text": "PureFocus 850 is a revolutionary autofocus add-on for biological and industrial imaging developed by Cambridge firm, Prior Scientific.\n\nLong-term imaging studies suffer from sample drift, which requires the user to manually maintain focus on the sample.\n\nPrior Scientific’s PureFocus 850 is an easy to set up autofocusing system that is suitable for both upright and inverted microscopes. The product is compatible with a range of different sample types, including Petri dishes, chambers, well plates, and reflective samples such as semiconductors. It is also ideal for high-speed slide scanning\n\nThe add-on provides the end user with fast and precise real-time focus using infinity corrected optics so that clear images can be maintained during long term studies. Because it is a stand-alone system, no computer is required to operate the device, although keyboard and PC control options are available.\n\nPureFocus 850 is compatible with Prior’s existing products so that a fully automated system can be created."
