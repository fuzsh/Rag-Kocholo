        "text": "The CHSI is located within Harvard's Science Center, which has three accessible entrances:\n\nThe front entrance on the south side of the building (via the Science Center Plaza)\n\nThe Oxford Street entrance on the east side of the building (via a ramp ascending from Oxford Street)\n\nThe rear entrance on the north side of the building (via a walkway leading from the Littauer Parking Lot west of the building)\n\nThe Putnam Gallery (1st floor) and the Special Exhibitions Gallery (2nd floor), both near the Oxford Street entrance to the building, are wheelchair accessible. Access to the second floor may be gained via a bank of elevators located near the intersection of the first floor corridors.\n\nAccessible restrooms are located on the basement level beneath the building's central atrium, via a bank of elevators located near the intersection of the first floor corridors.\n\nThe museum welcomes service dogs. Please note that emotional support animals and comfort animals are not permitted.\n\nAccessible Parking: See instructions in the \"Parking\" section below.\n\nTaking the Subway (The T)\n\nThis the best way to get to the CHSI. Take a Red Line train OUTBOUND from Boston or Alewife INBOUND to Harvard Square (Alewife Station, located off Route 2 in Cambridge, has a garage with $9.00 all day parking ($3.00 on weekends) ) . The Harvard Square T station has multiple exits; take a Massachusetts Avenue exit. Once above ground, look for the Harvard Yard gates and walk diagonally (north-northeast) through Harvard Yard to the other side, and out the gates. The Science Center will be directly in front of you, with Memorial Hall on the right (the large, ornate, brick building with tower, home of Sanders Theater). Proceed into the Science Center, passing the Cabot Science Library and Clover Cafe on your right, until you approach a metal-clad guard desk at the corner of a corridor running along the east-west axis of the building. Turn right (east) at the desk, and proceed toward the glass doors at the far end of the corridor. After passing the Science Center courtyard, the entrance to The Putnam Gallery will be the first grey double doors on the right. Access to the The Special Exhibitions Gallery on the second floor will be up the double flight of stairs opposite from the Putnam Gallery entrance (There is also a bank of elevators directly opposite the aforementioned guard desk.).\n\nTaking the MBTA Commuter Rail\n\nTake the Fitchburg Line to the Porter Square stop. Exit the rail pad onto Somerville Avenue, the turn West, and turn left onto the Beacon Street bridge. Proceed approximately 100 yards south, then make a gentle right onto Oxford Street. Follow Oxford Street 3/4 of a mile to the Harvard Science Center, 1 Oxford Street (where Oxford Street intersects Kirkland Street at a right angle.). Enter the building on your right through the doors up the steps. The entrance to The Putnam Gallery will be the second grey double doors on the left. Access to the The Special Exhibitions Gallery on the second floor will be up the double flight of stairs opposite from the Putnam Gallery entrance (There is also a bank of elevators located down the corridor just past the Science Center courtyard.).\n\nBy car from the north, take I-93 or Route 1 South toward Boston. Take the exit for Storrow Drive/Cambridge. Follow Storrow Drive west for approximately four miles. Stay in the right lane to avoid the many left exits off Storrow Drive. Take the Harvard Square/Cambridge exit. Cross the bridge over the Charles River into Cambridge, continuing straight through the first light onto JFK Street. At the fourth light, bear slightly to the right to pass through Harvard Square. The Harvard Coop is on the left and the Harvard Square T station is on the right. At the next light, the roadway dips downhill toward a fork. Bear left at the fork, then bear right at the next light to continue north on Massachusetts Avenue. Go approximately two-tenths of a mile past the Cambridge Common (on the left), and Harvard Law School (on the right), and turn right onto Everett Street. At the next set of lights, turn right on Oxford Street. The Science Center is located straight ahead at the corner where Oxford and Kirkland Streets intersect at a right angle. The entrance to The Putnam Gallery is located just inside the Oxford Street entrance to the building on the left. The Special Exhibitions Gallery is reached via the short flight of stairs nearby on the right. NOTE: There are a limited number of parking meters on Oxford Street.\n\nTake I-90 (Massachusetts Turnpike) east to the left exit for Cambridge/Allston and follow signs for Cambridge. At the end of the Turnpike exit, there is the ten-story DoubleTree Suites Hotel on the right. Begin to move to the left lane. There is a traffic light at the corner of the hotel and a bridge to Cambridge straight ahead. Do not take the bridge. At the light, take an immediate left onto an entrance ramp for Storrow Drive along the Boston side of the river. Follow Storrow Drive approximately a half-mile to the Harvard Square/Cambridge exit. Cross the bridge over the Charles River into Cambridge, continuing straight through the first light onto JFK Street. At the fourth light, bear slightly to the right to pass through Harvard Square. The Harvard Coop is on the left and the Harvard Square T station is on the right. At the next light, the roadway dips downhill toward a fork. Bear left at the fork, then bear right at the next light to continue north on Massachusetts Avenue. Go approximately two-tenths of a mile past the Cambridge Common (on the left), and Harvard Law School (on the right), and turn right onto Everett Street. At the next set of lights, turn right on Oxford Street. The Science Center is located straight ahead at the corner where Oxford and Kirkland Streets intersect at a right angle. The entrance to The Putnam Gallery is located just inside the Oxford Street entrance to the building on the left. The Special Exhibitions Gallery is reached via the short flight of stairs nearby on the right. NOTE: There are a limited number of parking meters on Oxford Street.\n\nFrom Route 3 or I-93 (South East Expressway) North, take the Storrow Drive exit to the Harvard Square/Cambridge Exit. Cross the bridge over the Charles River into Cambridge, continuing straight through the first light onto JFK Street. At the fourth light, bear slightly to the right to pass through Harvard Square. The Harvard Coop is on the left and the Harvard Square T station is on the right. At the next light, the roadway dips downhill toward a fork. Bear left at the fork, then bear right at the next light to continue north on Massachusetts Avenue. Go approximately two-tenths of a mile past the Cambridge Common (on the left), and Harvard Law School (on the right), and turn right onto Everett Street. At the next set of lights, turn right on Oxford Street. The Science Center is located straight ahead at the corner where Oxford and Kirkland Streets intersect at a right angle. The entrance to The Putnam Gallery is located just inside the Oxford Street entrance to the building on the left.
