        "text": "Trouble with Specifications\n\nSpecifications for lasers and other photonics products are essential for the process of buying such things. Nevertheless, many do not properly deal with them:\n\nMany product specifications by suppliers lack quality – they are incomplete, not sufficiently clear, etc.\n\nBuyers are often not aware of what they really need. For example, they forget essential requirements.\n\nVarious problems can arise:\n\nDue to a lack of clarity, tedious communications between supplier and buyer are required.\n\nProduct specifications raise expectations which cannot be met.\n\nConflicts can arise over such issues."
