        "text": "All U.S. and Canadian dental schools require their applicants to take the DAT as a component of their admission process. Each school uses its own criteria to determine how to weigh DAT results as part of admission decisions.\n\nProspective dental students should take the DAT after they have taken the subjects covered by the test, especially organic chemistry.\n\nThe DAT is offered year-round at Prometric Test Centers throughout the U.S. and select locations in Canada (no longer offered in the providence of Quebec). Once you have received your eligibility letter confirming that your test application has been accepted, you must contact Prometric to secure an appointment. We recommend doing this at least 60 to 90 days before your desired test date, since schedules fill up. Visit the Prometric website to find a testing center near you and schedule your test.\n\nIf you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment due to an emergency please contact the Department of Testing Services by emailing testingproblems@ada.org or calling 800.232.1694.\n\nThere are a limited number of partial fee waivers available.\n\nPartial fee waivers are granted on a first-come, first-served basis to eligible examinees who have submitted the required documents. The partial fee waiver covers 50% of the DAT fee. It cannot be applied to any charges associated with rescheduling/canceling a test date or score reporting after the time of initial application.\n\nAn examinee is eligible to request a partial fee waiver if each of the following criteria are met:\n\nFirst-time examinee\n\nHas not previously received a partial fee waiver\n\nU.S. citizen or resident alien\n\nHas demonstrated financial hardship\n\nReceived financial aid from their school\n\nRequest a fee waiver by signing in to your DENTPIN.\n\nOnce you have signed in select, ‘Submit Request’ and then ‘Waiver Request.’\n\nYou will be prompted to select the test for which you are requesting a waiver. Select ‘DAT.’\n\nThe DAT Program will review all partial fee waiver requests and make the final approval/denial decision. After the partial fee waiver request is reviewed, you will receive an email notification of the decision and instructions for submitting a DAT application online. Please allow up to 10 business days for review of all partial fee waiver requests."
