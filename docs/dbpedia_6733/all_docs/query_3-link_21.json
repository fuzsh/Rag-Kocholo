        "text": "The LumenLED for fluorescence microscopy is a modular system based around a two- or four-position LED combiner, directly coupled to the fluorescence port of a microscope. Its Constant Light Mode, a photodiode, provides closed-loop feedback for stability of illumination intensity. Constant Current Mode provides maximum illumination intensity.\n\nPrior Scientific\n\nRockland, MA\n\n[email protected]\n\nMore Products\n\n-----\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nIntroducing the LumenLED System from Prior Scientific\n\nRockland, MA. (October 13, 2011) - Prior Scientific has released the LumenLED system for fluorescence microscopy applications. The LumenLED offers a range of advantages over conventional illumination systems. LumenLED offers two modes of operation which allows the LED’s to be optimized for specific applications. In Constant Light Mode, a photodiode is used to provide a closed loop feedback mechanism to ensure short and long term stability of illumination intensity, essential for quantitative experiments. For more general imaging applications, Constant Current Mode is available to assure maximum illumination intensity. The LumenLED is a modular system based around a two position or four position LED combiner. To maximize light efficiency the combiner is directly coupled to the fluorescence port of the microscope. The system can be mounted on to most of the major manufacturers inverted or upright microscopes using the appropriate adapters.\n\nA choice of up to 10 LED modules are currently available which are mounted in either a two position or a four position combiner providing up to four LED wavelengths. In addition, the combiner is coupled directly to the microscope to avoid light loss associated with fiber guides and to ensure maximum light efficiency. LED modules are exchanged in a matter of seconds so it’s very easy to modify the illumination source to match your applications. Of course, fast shuttering comes standard thanks to the nature of LED’s and a 10,000+ hour lifetime eliminates the need for bulb replacement and alignment while minimizing operating costs.\n\nImaging software that already supports Prior’s filter wheels and shutters can be used to operate the LumenLED using a compatibility mode whereby the LED system emulates a filter wheel and shutter. However, an advanced SDK is also provided to facilitate software integration where more advanced features may be required.\n\nFor more information on the LumenLED or other Prior Scientific, Inc. products, contact Prior Scientific Inc., at 800-877-2234 or fax 781-878-8736. Write to Prior Scientific, Inc., 80 Reservoir Park Drive, Rockland, MA. 02370, send an email to [email protected] or visit our website­ at www.prior.com.\n\nPrior Scientific is the leading manufacturer of high precision motorized microscope stages, nanopositioning Piezo Z stages, automated slide loading systems, laser autofocus systems, fluorescence illumination systems, fiber optic inspection equipment, motorized filter wheels, microscopes, custom optical systems and a wide array of microscopy accessories for a variety of applications. Prior Scientific's dedication to customer service has positioned Prior as a trusted supplier for the industrial, scientific, educational and OEM markets.\n\n-----\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\nSubscribe now to Laser Focus World magazine; it's free!"
