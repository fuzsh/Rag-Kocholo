What do you mean miserable?\n\n\"This is Phil Serrell.\"\n\nAre you trying to say something?\n\nKW: Well, I didn't kill us.\n\nAS: No, you didn't.\n\nVO: And more importantly, you didn't scratch the paintwork.\n\nNow, go and grab yourselves an antique expert each.\n\nAre you arguing already?!\n\nKW: Nice to see you.\n\nPS: How are you?\n\nAS: Good to see you.\n\nCS: I'm Catherine.\n\nHello.\n\nWell, I thought it could be us two against you two but you might win and that wouldn't do our street cred any good.\n\nThere's no doubt... let's be absolutely clear - this is Kirsty Wark, this is Scotland, this is Alastair up from England... You've got an advantage.\n\nYou can definitely come with me.\n\nThat leaves us Alastair!\n\nI think that worked perfectly, delusions of grandeur.\n\nVO: The shops are open, the dealers are waiting and that £400 won't spend itself.\n\nSo, let's get cracking!\n\nKW: This is burning a hole in my hand - 400 quid, you keep it.\n\nThis comes easy to me.\n\nWe've got to be mean.\n\nYes.\n\nRight?\n\nI am very mean.\n\nOK, so it's good cop, bad cop?\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nVO: Whatever it takes to win is worth a try.\n\nAS: Right, bit of tactics and strategy first.\n\nWell, let me tell you something about Philip.\n\nCS: Philip is mean.\n\nAS: (LAUGHS) He doesn't spend a lot of money and he's got a great eye for curious, wacky items.\n\nI think Kirsty is very knowledgeable about anything that is Edinburgh.\n\nDo you think she's going to spend a lot of money?\n\nI think she probably will do, so that's good - they'll have a falling out.\n\nThat is very good.\n\nWe shall agree of course on all matters.\n\nWe shall agree on everything.\n\nAS: Yeah.\n\nVO: I like your style.\n\nLet's hope this here, Courtyard Antiques, can provide an arsenal for your big autumn campaign.\n\nAS: Things like this are sometimes interesting.\n\n1916.\n\nIt's pretty brutal First World War stuff, isn't it?\n\nThere's Belgium and there's the Kaiser.\n\n\"How I deal with the small fry,\" it says.\n\nCS: It's menacing, isn't it?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nA clever dealer is going to cruelly destroy that.\n\nTake the plates out and frame them or sell them, no?\n\nCS: Quite possibly.\n\nAS: But we're not priced.\n\nI think we want to go quite low on these, don't we?\n\nYes.\n\n(WHISPERS) 30-60.\n\nI was going to say about £20-£30.\n\nI don't think we want to pay any more.\n\nAS: For the set?\n\nCS: Hmm.\n\nVO: Local proprietor Lewis is on hand to help.\n\nWhat do you, hand on heart, believe to be the best that you can do on these magazines?\n\nEr... 15 each?\n\nAS: 15 each.\n\nCS: So 45.\n\nAS: There's damp and there's a spine damaged here.\n\nCS: Hmm.\n\nIf you said 30 for the three... Oh, I think we need to go lower than that.\n\nDo you?\n\nI don't think we should pay any more than £20.\n\nWhat do you think the best is that you can do?\n\n30.\n\nWould you possibly be able to meet in the middle at 25 or...\n\nI started off at 45 and we're now at 30, so I'm kind of in the middle.\n\nMore in our middle?\n\n25 quid for the three.\n\nCS: I think it's good.\n\nAS: I do too.\n\nI think that there will be a market for these and I think these are absolutely fascinating.\n\nVO: A lightning quick purchase in Alastair's fast-moving antiques shopping story.\n\nStay with us for full coverage of this and other buying tales as they unfold.\n\nNow for Kirsty and Phil's first shop.\n\nSadly, the owner is rather shy... but we have an idea of what he may look like.\n\nKW: Oh, I quite like these.\n\nWhat it's trying to be is sort of somewhere between 1718 and 1820, and it's not that.\n\nThey're not overly PC, the hunting, shooting, fishing thing, you know.\n\nBut the actual execution of these is quite nice.\n\nVO: Oh, unfortunate choice of words, Kirsty.\n\nCockfighting is not fashionable or indeed pleasant.\n\nHowever, these have a strange appeal as rural sporting scenes.\n\nPS: Mr Shop Man?\n\nYour cockfighting... CS: Yes, they're £50.\n\nPS: 50.\n\nKW: For four.\n\nI'd say more 20 for four.\n\n10 for four.\n\nI think you'd be hard pressed to get rid of these in Edinburgh at the moment.\n\nI think he'd do well to get his money back, don't you?\n\nI do.\n\nVO: Sorry, sir.\n\nThere's no hiding from hard-haggling Philip Serrell.\n\nBelieve me, I've tried.\n\nYou can be the voice.\n\nRight?\n\nYou can be the international man of mystery, the antique man of mystery is you.\n\nKW: And he's very handsome.\n\nPS: Isn't he ever!\n\nHe should have put some clothes on.\n\nNo, no, he's got a sporran on, it's fine.\n\nThat's fine.\n\nLook at this little one here.\n\nSo that's 30 squid.\n\nWell, it starts at 30, let's think about this.\n\nI do like your style.\n\nThe thing is, if we just check... Nice to see a pro at work.\n\nThis actually is a rather nice little table.\n\nPS: It's an Edwardian table.\n\nKW: Yep, and...\n\nIt's made out of mahogany.\n\nKW: And it's got a really nice inset here.\n\nPS: This is... KW: Boxwood.\n\nBox... She's good, isn't she?\n\nWell, let me tell you something.\n\nThese things have crashed in value.\n\nOn a bad day, in a bad auction, this is like 20 quid.\n\nGet out.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut I would take that home.\n\nPS: You might have to.\n\n(THEY LAUGH) VO: It's a crying shame, but a solid wood Edwardian table is just not modern taste.\n\nLike a black forest gateau, it's gorgeous and delicious, but deeply unfashionable.\n\nPS: Let's take it upstairs.\n\nKW: The thing is, I suppose we've got to be hard headed.\n\nThe things I like are not necessarily the things that are going to sell.\n\nPS: You've got to be mega hard headed.\n\nKW: He wants 30 for the table and 20 for these.\n\nI think £30 all in, or 35.\n\nKW: Er, hello?\n\nDEALER: Hello.\n\nWe like these prints and we also like the table, but we think you're asking too much.\n\nPS: There's a recession coming on.\n\nKW: There's a recession coming on.\n\nWorld doom and gloom.\n\nSo we'd like to offer you £35 for the table and the prints.\n\nDEALER: Can't do it.\n\nKW: You can't do it.\n\nHe said that with such a lovely smile on his face, didn't he?\n\nShall we split the difference with you?\n\nKW: I think £47.50.\n\nDEALER: What's the difference?\n\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n45 quid woman, just sh!\n\nWe've got 45 for the prints and the table, that's it finished.\n\nJust to get you out the shop, you're more than welcome.\n\nJust to get us out the shop, 45.\n\nPS: OK. KW: Done!\n\nVO: A final triumph with Edinburgh's mystery shopkeeper.\n\nAnd now Team Wark is swapping shops with Team Stewart.\n\nLet's hope Alastair and Catherine can get a good deal from Mr Bashful.\n\nCS: Nut basher.\n\nNutcracker.\n\nIt's very... it's not brand new, is it?\n\nAS: It has seen a few nuts cracked in its time AS: by the look of it.\n\nCS: It certainly has, hasn't it?\n\nBit of kitchenalia.\n\nBeautifully described.\n\nCS: Would you have that at home?\n\nAS: I would, quite seriously.\n\nIn your kitchen?\n\nYep, I would.\n\nSo, what are we looking for here?\n\n£5.\n\nAS: Er... CS: Can we go... AS: I'm gonna buy it.\n\nCS: Hold... (TUTS) No, I'm sorry.\n\nI've got to barter.\n\nWould you take three?\n\nNo.\n\nWould you take five?\n\nYes.\n\nCS: (LAUGHS) This is going to be used to bash you round the head!\n\nA fiver we said?\n\nVery, very nice to meet you.\n\nAS: Thank you.\n\nDEALER: Nice meeting you.\n\nVO: Yes, really nice... to... meet you... whoever you are.\n\nWhat is it with Edinburgh today?\n\nWe won't bite, much.\n\nLet's go round the bend.\n\nLet's go round here.\n\nLook at this fabric, it is absolutely glorious.\n\nI'm sort of not really an expert on ladies' dresses.\n\nWhy not?\n\nMS: I love her to bits because she's got a real hard eye.\n\nThe thing that bothers me is that our shopping trip could just turn into a shopping trip.\n\nDo you know what you could do with this?\n\nYeah.\n\nIf you didn't like it like this, it would make a great skirt.\n\nPS: I can feel one of me headaches coming on.\n\nI might take it if that's OK. VO: Of course, you're not really supposed to shop for yourself on this road trip but - ha!\n\n- if it's your money, I'm powerless to stop you!\n\nKW: Phil?\n\nPS: Yes.\n\nThere are more dresses upstairs.\n\nFantastic, I can barely wait(!)\n\nKW: Look, I like this.\n\nThat... propeller over there, the far one.\n\nKW: The one with the little red edges?\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat's the very, very best on that?\n\nWhat, how much is... Is there any way we could get that under a hundred quid?\n\nAre you buying something else?\n\nKW: Yeah!\n\nPS: We might be, yeah.\n\nWe're going to be buying several things but we're not sure what, but that's a component.\n\nDEALER: This propeller could be 30.\n\nOh, I like that, and I have to say that I've got a certain affinity with it cuz it has seen better days.\n\nKW: And this has probably been in the water for a long time.\n\nPerhaps we could create a story of a First World War pilot who was shot down over the Channel.\n\nNo?\n\nAm I just going on again?\n\nKW: Yeah.\n\nPS: OK. VO: So, I think we're looking at two propellers here.\n\nKirsty likes this highly polished one for £90 and Phil likes this scruffy old thing for £30.\n\nFunny what we all gravitate towards, isn't it?\n\nI think you might like this, Kirsty, these pressed flowers.\n\nI do like this a lot.\n\nI noticed it out the corner of my eye, but I wonder if it would sell, but I do think they're wonderful.\n\nBird's-foot Trefoil.\n\nI mean these are lovely.\n\nA lot of these wild flowers are hard to see out there - red rattle, brooklime.\n\nSomeone's really put a lot of effort into this.\n\nPS: I was just thinking, so they've given us £400 and we're gonna buy 40 year old, 80 year old dead weeds.\n\nBut they are beautiful.\n\n£35 for them all.\n\nOK, I'm thinking about that but...\n\nI think we should put that with our propellers.\n\nOK. PS: Oh, I love that!\n\nKW: Oh yeah, that's an old one.\n\nIt's a butcher's block, you'd have bought them like that and they just came on a stand and then people sand them down, wax them and use them in kitchens.\n\nVO: These hardwearing cutting blocks should be on legs and were originally used for meat processing.\n\nNow, of course, they're terribly fashionable in the home.\n\nHow much is your butcher's block?\n\nAnd have you got any legs for it?\n\nNo.\n\nI did have, I used them for something else, which has now gone.\n\nWhich is good for you, because you can have it cheaper.\n\nHow cheap?\n\nCuz it's like... 60 quid?\n\nWell... 25.\n\nDepending what else we're buying OK, you can have it for 20.\n\nThanks.\n\nOK, fine, excellent.\n\nDEALER: You don't really need me here do you?\n\nWhy don't I give you the keys and then you could just... KW: (LAUGHS) ..let me know how it all went.\n\nVO: Thanks Lewis, but we're doing fine for absent shopkeepers so far today.\n\nHowever, it allows us a moment to catch up with Alastair's exciting story.\n\nHi, how are you doing?\n\nVO: He's rocking.\n\nI know exactly what Phil Serrell would say about this.\n\nWhat would he say about that?\n\n(AS PHIL) \"It's firewood.\"\n\nOh, that's very harsh.\n\nI like the legs, the little duck's legs.\n\nAS: They look like little duck feet, don't they?\n\nThere's an awful lot of woodworm.\n\nBut wouldn't a two-year-old just love to sit and rock in this?\n\nAS: Yes.\n\nCS: It's wonderful.\n\nI'm loving it more and more.\n\nDEALER: You can have it for 10.\n\nCS: Would we want it for 10?\n\nAS: I'm tempted at that price.\n\nThat's a steal.\n\nCS: Do you think we should go for it?\n\nYes.\n\nIt's a deal.\n\nVO: Well, Alastair Stewart is today's top story so far.\n\nBoth lightning fast purchases are starting to stack up.\n\nAnd in other news, Kirsty Wark is trying to coax Philip out of a rather comfy chair.\n\nI've been sat in my thinking chair here.\n\nYeah.\n\nLeave the butcher's block out of the equation for the minute, right.\n\nI'm thinking about 110 quid for the two propellers and the flowers.\n\nThat's what I'm thinking.\n\nI think 115.\n\nAs much as that?\n\nLewis, what's the best you can do?\n\n130.\n\nIncluding the butcher's block?\n\nDid we mention the butcher's block?\n\nNo, but I'm about to.\n\n140 including the butcher's block.\n\nBecause the butcher's block is nothing without the legs.\n\n20 for the butcher's block.\n\nThat would make it 150, we can't afford that, we genuinely can't afford that.\n\nI'd like to buy the two propellers and that.\n\nYeah, but I like the butcher's block.\n\nVO: So, for anyone else who's confused, Kirsty and Phil are still interested in each other's propellers as well as the book of Edwardian pressed flowers.\n\nHowever, the butcher's block is still a definite.\n\nMaybe.\n\nIs that any clearer?\n\nSo, I'm 100% confused here.\n\nSo what we've got is...\n\nHe's giving you the whole thing... PS: That's £150 for the lot?\n\nKW: For the lot.\n\nI think 150 is good.\n\nIt's a deal.\n\nYeah.\n\nOh gosh!\n\nVO: That's a huge purchase to digest, so let's find a little light relief back with Alastair and Catherine.\n\nCan I just ask you about your Edwardian letter stationery box?\n\nWell, I have 125 on it but you can make me an offer.\n\nYou should never say that to me, CS: \"Make me an offer.\"\n\nDEALER: I just said it.\n\nCS: Cuz I'm very, very cruel, very mean.\n\nAS: Is that the original... DEALER: The original.\n\nAS: ..dividers?\n\nDEALER: Yep.\n\nAS: That's quite unusual, because very often these dividers have gone with wear and tear.\n\nThat... Is lovely.\n\nIt's a lovely color.\n\nJust look at that, the rosewood color and that there, because that's not been hammered by the sun.\n\nDEALER: Exactly.\n\nI have a very beautiful box, mahogany box with a lovely little bit of inlay on it...\n\nYes.\n\nAnd I lost the key and it had all of my old passports going back to when I first went abroad for ITN and I was desperate...\n\nI had to pay the locksmith to come out and do it.\n\nVO: Great story Alastair(!)\n\nYou worry me, Alastair, because I've got this feeling that all of a sudden you're going to go \"OK!\"\n\nNo, I... No, no.\n\nLike you've done before!\n\nI could do it at 60.\n\nI'm gonna give you £60 for it and expect her to kick me in the shins.\n\nDEALER: Excellent.\n\nAlastair!\n\nVO: Alastair!\n\nStraight in, no negotiation, no expert consultation - an outrage.\n\nI can't believe you've just done that!\n\nTwo, four, six... Can't we just negotiate the 50?\n\nNo, cuz that wasn't gonna happen.\n\nI can't believe you've just done that.\n\nI can't believe it.\n\nVO: And on that bombshell, this mammoth Edinburgh shopping exercise is finally over.\n\nWe can at last move on to... Oh, hang on a minute.\n\nThat's glass, that's beautiful.\n\nI like that, come on.\n\nMS: Probably 19th century and it would have probably held a lobster pot.\n\nIt's effectively a buoy isn't it?\n\nVO: Norway first used these big glass balls from the 1840s, but they were soon used all over the world to stretch out enormous fishing nets for a big catch.\n\nIt's glass, and it's rather lovely now I see it, so... KW: I'm thinking... MS: Oh, here we go again.\n\nWhy couldn't you make that an attractive proposition with the propeller?\n\n120 on the ticket but what would you do it for?\n\nDEALER: It says 45.\n\nOh, it's lovely.\n\nWhat about... would you do it for 40?\n\nNo, no, no, no.\n\nDEALER: Yes.\n\nKW: Thank you so much.\n\nThis is just going horribly wrong, let me have a look.\n\nDo you like it?\n\nKW: I love it.\n\nGod, look at it.\n\nThis is your fault.\n\nI know, I know, I know.\n\nI think we'd leave all this gunk on there.\n\nYeah, but it's beautiful - look.\n\nIt just looks like a stamp of ownership.\n\nLike two ferns or something.\n\nDo you really like this?\n\nI really like it and I think it's a wonderful thing and I'm so excited about it.\n\nPhilip, pay the man, please.\n\nOK, fine.\n\nVO: And with this lovely maritime novelty, the Edinburgh shopping is finally over?\n\nIs that a little bit of silver?\n\nDEALER: Yeah, it's a Victorian, Birmingham, I think it's about 1880.\n\nThere's a hallmark there, there's a leopard's head, there's a Victoria's head, so we know that it's alright.\n\nThat's really lovely.\n\nKW: It's pretty, isn't it?\n\nI think it's a tenner.\n\nYeah, would £10 be alright?\n\nKW: Would £10 do it?\n\nDEALER: Yep.\n\nPS: Are you sure?\n\nDEALER: Yep, yep.\n\nKW: Thank you very much indeed.\n\nPS: That's really sweet.\n\nThis is our betrothal ring to say that we're bound together now.\n\nThat's now lots one to 400 in this hour are all down to Kirsty and Phil, yeah?\n\nI'm gonna take you home before you buy anything else cuz there's a lamp stand in there you haven't seen yet.\n\nAnd there's a carpet, there's a table.\n\nVO: Sadly, Edinburgh shopping is done and it's time to evacuate our news teams from this hotspot.\n\nKW: So did you have a good day?\n\nAS: Catherine I thought was absolutely wonderful.\n\nShe was very indulgent of some of my occasional quirkiness.\n\nPS: What about Alastair?\n\nI mean, he strikes me as being a real card.\n\nCS: I thought he was gonna really barter and negotiate hard.\n\nAnd did he?\n\nNot in the way I thought he would to be honest.\n\nPhil is really good, you just sort of see a look in his eyes when he says, but doesn't say, \"that's a ridiculous idea\".\n\nLook at that!\n\nFan-bloody-tastic!\n\nIf shopping was an Olympic sport... She'd have won a gold medal.\n\nUnbeliev... galactic class she is!\n\nGood girl.\n\nThat's what I like to hear.\n\nVO: The rolling news road trip rumbles on.\n\nVO: Leaving this royal throne behind, our celebrities lead their expert squires on to the kingdom of Fife, 38 miles north of Edinburgh to the town of Falkland.\n\nHard shopping Team Wark has decided upon a small indulgence, visiting a kind of historical forerunner to the great British holiday camp.\n\nFalkland Palace was a summer haunt of one of Kirsty's favorite historical ladies, and if you can't quite guess, she's Scottish and called Mary.\n\nThe lands around Falkland - some 4,000 acres - have hosted exclusive hunting, falconry and outdoor leisure activities for over half a millennia.\n\nAll we need now is lovely local tour guide Pam.\n\nGood morning.\n\nGood morning.\n\nHello, I'm Kirsty.\n\nPAM: Nice to see you.\n\nPS: Hi, Philip, how are you?\n\nWelcome to Falkland.\n\nBOTH: Thank you.\n\nPAM: This is the gatehouse.\n\nFinished by James V of Scotland.\n\nKW: When they came here to entertain and to hunt, would they come for six weeks at a time?\n\nWe think something like that - six weeks to two months.\n\nHygiene was the thing that dictated when they left, and the whole place was then cleared and cleaned.\n\nPS: Got to go have a look, haven't we?\n\nKW: I think I'd love to go have a look.\n\nPS: Yeah.\n\nVO: First built between 1502 and 1541, Falkland Palace has mostly been a holiday home for the Scottish monarchs.\n\nJames V transformed the interiors in a stunning French renaissance style and died here in 1542 after hearing of the birth of his daughter, Mary Queen of Scots.\n\nAs Pam's tour begins, the first port of call is the most popular game at Falkland - the torture of the Englishman.\n\nFantastic.\n\nYou really wouldn't think a sweet lady like Pam could have quite the sadistic tendencies that she's got, would you?\n\nPS: Oh, fant... KW: Oh!\n\nKirsty, I don't like this very much.\n\nOh!\n\nUrgh!\n\nNothing can happen to you Phil, look at the height of this wall.\n\nOh, fantastic Kirsty, fantastic.\n\nIt's like walking on fresh air.\n\nIt's solid stone.\n\nI don't care, where are we going?\n\nAre we going up there now?\n\nYou really want me to go up there?\n\nWell, I'm afraid you have to come up here, but the parapet I'm afraid isn't quite as good up here.\n\nNow we can see for miles and miles.\n\nPAM: If I stand here... PS: No, don't.\n\nCome away from there.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nAre you going on your own then?\n\nNo, I'm not going on my own, no.\n\nYou're not going anywhere?\n\nDon't you dare tell anyone about this, Pam, it'll embarrass me.\n\nVO: Philip, get a grip.\n\nSadly, much of Falkland Palace was destroyed by Cromwell's forces during the Civil War and fell into disrepair until bought in 1887 by John Crichton Stewart, Third Marquess of Bute.\n\nToday, the grounds and buildings are maintained in conjunction with the National Trust.\n\nHowever, much of the hunting lands are no longer part of the estate.\n\nPAM: This is the palace orchard.\n\nBeyond that, practically to the foot of the hills in the distance... Aha.\n\n..was hunting forests.\n\nCan you stop down there and look up rather than come up here and look down?\n\nVO: Fortunately, there's fun to be had and more Philip's kind of fun - down on ground level.\n\nAnyone for slightly peculiar tennis?\n\nThis original real tennis court is the oldest surviving useable court in the world, built in 1539, 100 years before its more famous cousin in Hampton Court Palace.\n\nHow amazing.\n\nI've never been in a real tennis court.\n\nVO: Today's umpire is Bob, secretary of Falkland's real tennis court.\n\nHello, very nice to meet you.\n\nI can't believe that I am standing on a court that James V played on.\n\nAnd Mary Queen of Scots, we believe.\n\nWell, she was a tall woman, she was probably quite athletic as well.\n\nDo you love it more than lawn tennis?\n\nOh yes!\n\nMuch more interesting, and of course you don't have to be 19 and serve at 150 miles an hour.\n\nVO: Good news for Phil.\n\nReal or royal tennis is the forerunner to lawn tennis with some quirky antiquated game playing.\n\nThe service takes place from this end only...\n\nRight.\n\nAnd the ball must hit the roof, the penthouse roof, on the far side of the net.\n\nYour serving is always onto the roof and over.\n\nYes.\n\nSo your forehand is there.\n\nVO: All four walls are in play here, a bit like squash, but at a slower pace for ladies in cumbersome attire.\n\nIt's not just IF your opponent faults, which wins the points, but where on the court, hence all the lines.\n\nI think we should give this a go.\n\nOK, this is war.\n\nThis is England versus Scotland.\n\nBOB: A good tip... KW: Yes.\n\n..is this bit is always above that bit.\n\nAha, OK. Oh right, right OK.\n\nExcuse me, don't I get any coaching?\n\nVO: Quiet please, especially you, Serrell.\n\nMiss Wark to serve.\n\nOK?\n\nYou just take it steady.\n\nBOB: Excellent.\n\nKW: Right.\n\nOoh!\n\nPS: YES!\n\nKW: That wasn't very good!\n\nGod, he's good!\n\nBOB: He is, isn't he?\n\nVO: That'll please the crowds up on Serrell summit.\n\nYou are good.\n\nI'd just like to say that Phil is a complete ringer, he plays squash every single day.\n\nVO: Didn't Murray say the same about Nadal?\n\nSadly, that's all of today's highlights and we now say goodbye to the wonderful Jacobean theme park that is Falkland Palace.\n\nAs there are no more shopping minutes to the day, this part of Fife's Kingdom must provide shelter for the night.\n\nSweet dreams.\n\nWakey-wakey, bright and early.\n\nThe road trip calls our drivers to their cars once more.\n\nI feel you are a professional shopper, aren't you?\n\nNo, no, I shop with purpose, I'm like an Exocet.\n\nYou are.\n\nVO: So far, Kirsty and Phil have bought seven separate items: the Edwardian table, the cockfighting prints, a pair of propellers, the pressed flowers, the butcher's block.\n\nPhew!\n\nThe Victorian glass float and the bargain silver napkin ring, and Kirsty bought a dress for herself.\n\nHonestly!\n\nKirsty and Phil have only £90 left to spend.\n\nNot now, I can't.\n\nIt's profligate.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nSpent too much.\n\nOh, right OK. VO: Meanwhile, the opposition has moved fast.\n\nAlastair Stewart spends just £100 on three items.\n\nDay begins with World War One cartoons.\n\nProceeds cautiously with child's rocking chair.\n\nThen goes mad with impulse stationery box.\n\nAlastair and Catherine begin a second day's rummaging with a healthy £300.\n\nAnd Alastair, I have to ask you this question - what do you talk about at the end of the news when you're shuffling the papers?\n\nIt's funny because sometimes it'll be \"well, we got away with that!\"\n\nif something particularly hairy has happened.\n\nI'm going to lip read now, I'm going to sit there, you will feel my presence.\n\nThe searching eyes of Catherine.\n\nVO: In true maverick style, Alastair and Catherine are going on ahead, their delicate feet barely touching the ground, whisking the road trip 11 miles northeast from Falkland to the wonderful town of Cupar.\n\nAnd I'm sure I don't need to remind anyone here in Fife that time is of the essence in this final day of shopping.\n\nSo I won't.\n\nNow, time is against us.\n\nIt really is.\n\nI quite like these.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nDEALER: They definitely suit you.\n\nDo they?\n\nNo, but they're spring loaded aren't they?\n\nWhich I'm going to let you do it in case I break it.\n\nAS: And what are you looking for for those?\n\nDEALER: We have £50 on them but Catherine will probably make me a counter offer.\n\nI will if they work.\n\n(LAUGHS) Cuz I'm watching you fiddle.\n\nDEALER: There we are.\n\nCS: There we are.\n\nI think they're elegant and I quite like the 1920s style.\n\nQuite deco, isn't it?\n\nSo what would that make at auction though in Kent?\n\nI think they would probably make about £60 but I wouldn't want to give any more... AS: Because I have to make a profit at the end of the day.\n\nDEALER: That's right.\n\nAS: That's what drives me.\n\nI would want to pay 15.\n\nDEALER: You would?\n\nAs it's you, I'll accept £15 for that and you have to make a profit on them.\n\nYou're not convinced, are you Alastair?\n\nI'm convinced on the potential for margin on that but I'm also conscious about where it sits in the overall set of lots that we're going to have.\n\nVO: Alastair, you are very tricky to please.\n\nNow, you want something that'll look good with spectacles.\n\nHmm.\n\nThey look right through you, don't they?\n\nCR: See, I'd like the glass eyes too.\n\nMm, but there's no market for glass eyes.\n\nThere is a market for glass eyes, they're brilliant.\n\nWhat is the potential for improvement on glass eyes?\n\n£20 each.\n\nEach?\n\nOh, but we can do better than that.\n\nA lot better.\n\nThis conversation may conclude... Mm-hm.\n\n..a financial transaction not at one level of activity...\n\nRight...\n\nBut potentially of four, so therefore, your answer to her next question is crucial.\n\n(TENSE MUSIC) AS: And your question is... ?\n\nJust how much you'd sell them for, really.\n\nVO: Oh, is that it?\n\nI do not know the man or woman who is going to pay a significant amount of money for these three very strange eyes, but you're the expert and... you're a scientific instruments expert so you're the nearest out of the three of us to kind of medical stuff.\n\nCS: You are putting so much pressure on me.\n\nAS: No!\n\nCS: I'm almost trembling.\n\nAS: Why?\n\nBecause it's that look.\n\n25 for the glasses and the eyes.\n\nDEALER: Yes.\n\nAS: Is that what we're saying?\n\nCS: What do you think?\n\nAS: Done.\n\nLook, that's how tense I am.\n\nI know.\n\nSee how laidback I am.\n\nThere's 20, and there's a five somewhere in that... That crumpled stack of money!\n\nVO: The eyes have it, but I wish they'd stop staring.\n\nOh!\n\nThat's spooky!\n\nVO: You're telling me.\n\nBack down the road, your optically challenged opponents are still looking hard at the delights of Falkland.\n\nDo you think he's on the fiddle?\n\nVO: Snappy dresser Bob owns this wonderful emporium of Scottish antiques, but can Kirsty find anything with down south appeal?\n\nKW: This is actually quite pretty.\n\nDo you know, you've got a really good eye cuz I think that's just absolutely beautiful.\n\nKW: The birds.\n\nPS: So, I don't understand Scottish pottery - tell me about it.\n\nAnd where... DEALER: Probably made in Kirkcaldy.\n\nPS: Kirkcaldy.\n\nKW: Yeah.\n\nFrom Methven's Pottery in Kirkcaldy.\n\nPS: Medvin's?\n\nCS: Methven's?\n\nM-E-T-H-V-E-N... look at it.\n\nCan we set this aside as well?\n\nWe're building up a little portfolio of things.\n\nYou don't mind that... That's what's worrying me again.\n\nAgain, it's Scottish.\n\nScottish pieces don't do so well in England and similarly, some English pieces don't do so well up here in Scotland, it's just the way the cookie crumbles.\n\nVO: Well, let's try and remain positive, shall we?\n\nKW: I'm looking at this.\n\nSee there, it's illustrated there.\n\nYeah, we don't like things that are illustrated... No.\n\nCuz it costs more money then.\n\nIt's just to show you, it's a wee bit collectable.\n\nHow old is that?\n\nThat'll date from about 1890.\n\nPS: Kirsty's going to have... we're in her patch now.\n\nIt's nice with \"Tarvas\".\n\nThis is Scottish pottery but not as I would imagine it.\n\nThis is what I would call like a terracotta farmer's pot.\n\nVO: Seaton pottery, manufactured in Aberdeen on and off for the best part of a century.\n\nThis bespoke piece from 1894 is certainly catching Kirsty's eye.\n\nI do think it's a thing of beauty.\n\nPS: That's quite primitive.\n\nKW: Absolutely.\n\nIt would look good on a chrome and glass table.\n\nI'm going to ask you two questions.\n\nHow much is that?\n\n£100.\n\nAnd what's it worth?\n\nProbably 400.\n\nPS: Yeah, but my problem is... KW: I love it.\n\nKW: Would it sell in Kent?\n\nPS: Would you buy a piece of Kentish pottery and bring it to Aberdeen to flog it?\n\nWell, you'd have to hope there was someone from Aberdeen KW: at the sale.\n\nPS: We don't like hope.\n\nVO: So much for remaining positive.\n\nBut at least Kirsty and Phil are still working.\n\nI just like that sort of thing.\n\nI'm not even going to propose it to Catherine cuz she'll tell me to put it away so I'll put it away.\n\nCR: I really like those leather gloves.\n\nAS: But who's going to buy them?\n\nCS: Nobody.\n\nAS: Come on, I'm being brutal now.\n\nDEALER: But they do have the cute factor.\n\nAren't they lovely?\n\nAS: They are very, very sweet.\n\nDEALER: And cut to the chase, you could actually buy these for £8.\n\nIt's the kind of size that a child who might have been... Yeah?\n\nAbout one, two...\n\nSo, we would put the gloves on the rocking chair and have it as an item.\n\nCS: Have it as a lot?\n\nAS: Yeah, so that... CS: Perfect, you're a genius.\n\nAS: That makes an item.\n\nI'm perfectly comfortable with the logic.\n\nHmm, I think that would be quite nice.\n\nGive you a fiver for the gloves?\n\nI think that's a really good... Oh no!\n\nWhat?\n\nHe said eight.\n\nYou're doing it again.\n\nYeah, but I'm in a hurry now.\n\nVO: Catherine Southon, will you please get a handle on your celebrity?\n\nCS: You and your mouth!\n\nAS: I know, I know.\n\nAlastair offered five.\n\nCS: No, but I didn't and...

Each year when this competition took place, the former winners' medals were all there hanging.\n\nIt's not impossible that it could have been hit by a stray arrow.\n\nVO: Of course, it's always good to know who you're aiming at, especially in this here antiques game.\n\nAnd with our upcoming contest in mind, it's time to reveal the rather considerable amount of items they've all been buying.\n\nCall your loved ones - it's gonna be a long night.\n\nOK.\n\nTails, we go first.\n\nOK.\n\nRight.\n\nThese are three magazines, and they are articles and illustrations from the First World War.\n\nIt's quality illustration.\n\nWe paid £25 for the three.\n\nI think anything you can do... CS: ..we can certainly do better!\n\nVO: Well, pressed flowers are the obvious antidote to war.\n\nWe have bought a number of rather lovely and unusual... And slightly damaged.\n\nNot yet!\n\nIt's part of the appeal!\n\nThe thing that worries me is that it lends itself to the idea of somebody buying the lot and then spending quite a bit of money framing them, and then they would sell.\n\nVO: Alastair is learning this game fast.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nHa-ha!\n\nThe walnut... Cracker.\n\nWhat I really like about it is that it's perfectly obvious that it's been used, and the nut's been in there and that's happened, and I like that.\n\nSold.\n\nCS: Oh, is it a set of four?\n\nPS: Well done.\n\nI've got a set at home which is a mounted four of fighting cocks as well.\n\nWould you like four more?\n\nNo, no, because you see the problem with these is they're marked, and the artwork's not great.\n\nI think the artwork's good!\n\nYou're just making this up.\n\nAw!\n\nOh, I like that.\n\nThat's lovely.\n\nVO: Now for Alastair's stationery box, which, maybe, could have been a bit cheaper.\n\nHow old do you think it is?\n\nEdwardian?\n\nI do think it's Edwardian.\n\nI'd put an estimate on that of 60-90 quid, and if it made 120 it wouldn't surprise me.\n\nLovely, well done.\n\nVO: Look out, it's Kirsty's propellers next.\n\nWell, I like that one, and Kirsty liked this one, so we thought we'd buy them both.\n\nI think this is a real gamble.\n\nIt's got to be 100, 150, hasn't it?\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nCS: You think that's too high?\n\nAS: Yeah.\n\nVO: Now, let's take a closer look at the potential for profit here today.\n\nSo are these art deco or something?\n\nA night at the opera.\n\nCan you see with them?\n\nYes, I can, and they're actually proper lenses, and it was when you pointed out the amount of work in them... KW: And the marcasite's pretty for it, and that's very art deco traditional.\n\nCS: I think they're very elegant.\n\nHallmark silver.\n\nAS: Napkin ring.\n\nCS: Napkin ring.\n\nPS: Yeah, but with it... AS: A napkin.\n\nPS: ..you get a table.\n\nLook at the look on Catherine's face!\n\nAS: I'm liking the napkin ring.\n\nBOTH: And I'm liking the table.\n\nAS: Not seeing the connection.\n\nCS: Not liking the connection.\n\nAS: Did we rehearse that?!\n\nCS: No, we didn't!\n\nKW: We liked the table and we thought we got it for a pretty good price.\n\nI mean, if we get 50 for it, we'd be delighted.\n\nAS: There's a profit there.\n\nYep.\n\nCS: There's a profit there.\n\nOK... look!\n\nThose are fantastic.\n\nKW: They're beautiful.\n\nKW: I love that.\n\nCS: Look!\n\nAS: On... CS: The chair.\n\n..that.\n\nI know exactly what you're thinking about.\n\nI do.\n\nPS: No, you don't!\n\nKW: OK, tell her.\n\nPS: No.\n\nCS: Firewood.\n\nNo.\n\nFlippin' disgusting, perhaps... (THEY LAUGH) AS: Again, it's yummy mummy, isn't it?\n\nThey are desperate to buy a duck-shaped rocking chair.\n\nPS: Then, looking at what you... AS: We have met their every need.\n\nVO: Let's hope there are yummy mummies at auction, then.\n\nPS: Isn't that lovely?\n\nAS: Oh, I like that.\n\nKW: This is Scottish pottery.\n\nAS: The yellow and the black of the birds is fantastic.\n\nKW: This is a bit like... AS: That's my favorite bit so far.\n\nThis complements it ideally, we thought.\n\nKW: This is Scottish pottery... PS: It's a fishing float.\n\nKW: It's still got the sand on it.\n\nAS: I might pay £40 or 50.\n\nCS: £30 to 50.\n\nYou little belter!\n\nAS: Three... glass... eyes.\n\nWhy do people want them?\n\nWhat do they do with them?\n\nPS: Why did you buy them?\n\nAS: Because she told me to.\n\nPS: Alright, OK. CS: I didn't tell you to.\n\nAS: Sorry.\n\nAdvised me strongly.\n\nCS: I merely advised.\n\nBecause they're...\n\nThey're a good bit of fun, aren't they?\n\nKW: What did you pay?\n\nCS: 10.\n\nYou pinched them - absolutely pinched them.\n\nPS: Are you ready for...?\n\nAS: Eye, eye!\n\nCS: Eye, eye!\n\nPS: No.\n\nKW: This was made at Seaton Pottery, outside Aberdeen.\n\nThis, obviously, is very weathered.\n\nIt's lovely.\n\nBut it's naive, and that's what I like about it.\n\nIt's primitive, innit?\n\nBut we actually bought it and decided it would go with something that we bought yesterday.\n\nSo would you like to stand up?\n\nIt's... (CHUCKLES) OK, it's a chopping block.\n\nPS: It's a butcher's block.\n\nKW: Butcher's block.\n\nPS: Yeah.\n\nOn legs, those are worth 150/250.\n\nPS: And... CS: And?\n\nPS: Well, we gave a tenner for it.\n\nThat could sit on that or next to it.\n\nExactly.\n\nNo, I...\n\nI'll...\n\nI'll concede that.\n\nVO: Great, but how would our anchors spin each other's shopping stories?\n\nCS: What about the propeller?\n\nI think that will... crash from the skies.\n\nKW: I think the magazines are fascinating but I wouldn't put those to auction - I don't think they're something I would have bought.\n\nNo.\n\nI think, in a way, they're a bit macabre.\n\nWhat did you make of what Philip said about the mahogany box?\n\nI was hoping you wouldn't... bring that up!\n\nI was really hoping you wouldn't bring that up!\n\nI don't mind whether they win or we win, as long as it's us.\n\nVO: With that great generosity of spirit, it's time for us to move on towards the ultimate test of antiques prowess.\n\nYou... with Kent, you think vegetables... KW: You think of oast houses.\n\nAS: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nAnd the... you know, the... the Garden of England, but this is industrial Kent.\n\nKW: Yes.\n\nAS: This is ports and ships and... er... and breaking yards.\n\nI went to school with a chap whose father had a ship-broking business, and I asked if that was like insurance brokerage.\n\nHe said, \"No, we break ships up!\"\n\nVO: Here he goes again.\n\nEastern Scotland has done our celebrities proud, from handsome Edinburgh, through the hidden treasures of Fife.\n\nNow we take a dramatic leap, landing up a whopping - wait for it - 522 miles south, here at lovely Sheerness, on the east Kent coast.\n\nAS: So you've changed, I notice.\n\nKW: I've changed into my dress that I bought for 40 quid.\n\nYou know, things like your fisherman's ball... Aha?\n\n..I mean, that... That should do well here, in what is very much maritime Kent, is it not?\n\nAbsolutely, and just think of how many sailors and pirates only had one eye.\n\n(THEY LAUGH) CS: This is lovely, isn't it?\n\nPS: Very picturesque.\n\nCS: Really beautiful.\n\nPS: I can't understand why more people don't come here.\n\nVO: It's finally auction day, and we want our celebrity teams hungry for the challenge.\n\nLooking very elegant and raring to go.\n\nPartner in crime.\n\nShall we \"propel\" ourselves...?\n\nOh, enough puns already!\n\nVO: More than enough, thank you!\n\nFrederick Walker Ltd opened their doors to auction hopefuls in 2004.\n\nAnd resident auctioneer Michael Walking has taken a very good look at Kirsty and Alastair's combo lots for sale.\n\nThe World War memorabilia I think is going to struggle, if I'm honest.\n\nThe glass eyes, yes!\n\nThey're an attractive lot.\n\nWe should find somebody to buy them.\n\nI've no idea what they would do with them but I suspect they're going to make £20 to £30 for the lot.\n\nVery eclectic mixes of some items, where the napkin ring goes with the table and such like - we may struggle with that a little bit.\n\nVO: So, abandon all hope... perhaps.\n\nKirsty and Alastair started their antiques adventure with £400 each.\n\nKirsty side-stepped austerity to go shopping mad, spending a wonderful £310 on 10 items, combined now in six auction lots.\n\nAlastair was bold and decisive, yet actually spent very little - a mere £127 on seven items, now also in six auction lots.\n\nWell done, you!\n\nVO: So hold the front page and smoke 'em if you got 'em - the auction is about to begin.\n\nThis is all very cozy, isn't it?\n\nPS: Sorry?\n\nCS: Sorry!\n\nNo, you're fine!\n\nVO: First to spoil for a fight are Kirsty and Phil's vibrant sporting prints.\n\n£25 cost but they will make... 50.\n\nGood girl.\n\nAlastair?\n\nCS: Very positive.\n\nAS: Fighting cocks up first.\n\nShall we say for those £30 for the set of four?\n\nNice set of four prints there, £30 where?\n\n20 then, somewhere, for those.\n\n20 I've got.\n\nFive anywhere now?\n\n22.\n\n25.\n\n28.\n\n30.\n\n£30 bid.\n\nSelling at 30 then.\n\n66.\n\nYou just made 50 pence.\n\nWe made £5.\n\nNo, we made 50 pence, dear - we have to pay commission.\n\nOK, we made 50 pence.\n\nI am so disappointed.\n\nVO: There's plenty of time later for disappointment - let's get on with the rest of it first.\n\nAlastair and Catherine's nursery combo is next to seek a buyer.\n\nI feel you're not feeling so sentimental about those.\n\nDo you wish we hadn't bought them?\n\nNo, no.\n\nI think that the rocking chair would do better somewhere else!\n\nBut unfortunately, we're here!\n\nAnd a pair of kid gloves.\n\nHave you got it there?\n\nGloves and chair.\n\nThere we are.\n\n£30, somewhere?\n\nEasily worth £30, I'd've thought.\n\n30 I've got.\n\n32 bid.\n\n35.\n\n35 bid.\n\n38 where?\n\nDone at 35.\n\nWell done!\n\nAh, but it's worth much more than that.\n\nSh!\n\nLook, be thankful for small mercies!\n\nBe thankful for small gloves!\n\nVO: Whilst Alastair complains about doubling his money, the eyes have it next.\n\nI think the glass eyes are gonna be a winner.\n\nNo.\n\nThere's a lot of people in here with just one eye.\n\n..anywhere now?\n\nUnusual lot.\n\nThere we are.\n\n£30 for the three somewhere?\n\nCome on.\n\n20, then, somewhere, clear them up?\n\nEasily worth... 20 I've got.\n\n20!\n\nI... can I bid on these?\n\n25.\n\n28.\n\n30.\n\n£30 there.\n\n32, fresh place.\n\nSelling at 32.\n\nKW: What did you pay...?\n\nAS: Yeah!\n\nWhat did you pay for them?\n\nAS: Tenner!\n\nPS: Kirsty...
