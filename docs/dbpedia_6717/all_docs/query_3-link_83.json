        "text": "Dragon’s Den regular Deborah Meaden has admitted when it comes to business she’s a ‘yes girl’ who finds it hard to turn down opportunities that come her way.\n\nThe Somerset-based entrepreneur also said when not in the boardroom – or the famous Den warehouse – she is happiest riding her horse on the hills near her home.\n\nMs Meaden was put on the spot by BBC West of England business correspondent Dave Harvey at an event in Bristol last night in support of the city’s Above & Beyond’s £6m Golden Gift appeal.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview – and a lively question-and-answer session afterwards – Ms Meaden spoke about the failure of her first business, her views on women in business and why she supports Above & Beyond.\n\nAt the age of 19 she started a business importing upmarket Italian glass and tableware to the UK, working with retailers such as House of Fraser.\n\nHowever, the Italian company started to import them itself and what had been a success turned to failure as she lost all her orders.\n\nFinancially, she was out of pocket to the tune of £3,000 but the set back was short-lived and made her more determined to be a success. It also taught her, she said, to be more serious about business.\n\nIn response to one question of what she described as “the gender issue” she said “I’m not a woman in business. I’m just in business.\n\n“I don’t agree that women ever came second to men. I champion equality but you won’t ever hear me speaking about women in business.”\n\nThe event took place to an invited audience of business figures and Above & Beyond supporters at Bristol’s M Shed. Ms Meaden, who was also a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing, admitted that she had decided to attend the event over an invitation she received to the BAFTA nominees’ party in London.\n\nShe said businesses needed to be more involved with their local communities.\n\nAll proceeds from the evening will help transform two of the South West’s most important hospitals: Bristol’s Cancer Centre and the Bristol Royal Infirmary.\n\nSome £6m is being sought through Above & Beyond’s Golden Gift appeal to transform them by ensuring they have state-of-the-art facilities and equipment that is above and beyond what the NHS can provide.\n\nPictured: Deborah Meaden, with the BBC's Dave Harvey, take questions from the audience.
