        "text": "The brand new series of Dragon's Den returns for its nineteenth series this week with Somerset Dragon Deborah Meaden taking up her usual seat on the BBC programme.\n\nThe entrepreneur is a familiar face having appeared on the series since 2006 and until 2011 she the only female Dragon on the panel.\n\nPeter Jones, , Touker Suleyman, Sara Davies and Steven Bartlett, the youngest Dragon in the show's history, will join her as hopeful entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas.\n\nRead more: Much-loved Somerset restaurant closes for good\n\nHere's everything you need to know Deborah\n\nShe was born in Somerset but didn't go to school here.\n\nBorn in Taunton in 1959, she spent part of her childhood in Essex after her parents divorced and her mother moved away with Deborah and her older sister Gail.\n\nMeaden went to the Godolphin School, Salisbury and Trowbridge High School for Girls, which she left at the age of 16.\n\nShe started her career as a model\n\nAfter studying business at Brighton Technical College, she worked as a sales-room model in a fashion house.\n\nBut at 19 she moved to Italy and set up a glass and ceramics export agency which had high profile clients such as Harvey Nichols.\n\nWhen it went bust she and a business partner returned to the UK and bought a Stefanel textile franchise.\n\nBut her most successful ventures were in leisure and retail, including operating Prize Bingo at Butlins in Minehead and Weststar Holidays.\n\nShe later created The Merchant Fox, an online store selling British luxury goods.\n\nHow much she is worth\n\nIt depends who you ask but according to Spear's magazine and several other websites, her net worth is £40 million.\n\nMost of the money came from her businesses but she is said to have made between £3 million and £6 million from Dragon's Den investments such as Yee Kwan Ice Cream and Dock and Bay, quick-drying beach and travel towels.\n\nWhere does she live?\n\nDeborah lives in a period property near Langport that was once owned by William Pitt the Elder, Prime Minister from 1766 to 1768.\n\nShe bought the 26-acre farmhouse property in 2006 and says that rewilding the grounds has been her most gratifying investment.\n\nWho does she live with?\n\nHer husband Paul, two cats, three dogs, six horses, three pigs, four sheep, numerous birds and geese.\n\nThe couple met in summer 1985, while he worked at Weststar during his university break. They separated when she took a trip to Venezuela but she returned to London and they married in 1993.\n\nThey don't have any children and she once told the MailOnline: \"Children are very dependent, which is probably why we never had them.\n\nShe's an animal lover\n\nDeborah is very outspoken about her love for animals and became a vegan in 2020.\n\nShe is on the Council of Ambassadors of the World Wildlife Fund, is an ambassador for the Marine Conservation Society and does a lot of work with the Dogs Trust charity.\n\nAnd she has backed campaigns such as the one by Peta to stop tourists visiting marine parks.\n\n“The more we learn about these complex and highly intelligent animals, the more abhorrent their captivity for human entertainment looks,” Meaden wrote.\n\nShe is also very green\n\nHer New Year's resolution is to buy less and waste less and she takes the packaging off goods in supermarkets to make point.\n\nShe prefers to put a jumper on to turning up the radiators.\n\nShe doesn't take herself seriously\n\nDeborah is not afraid to put herself on the line and she took part in the 2013 series of Strictly Come Dancing where she made it to week five.\n\nOver Christmas she appeared in Extraordinary Escapes At Christmas With Sandi Toksvig and this week appeared in the TV seriies Mandy with Diane Morgan.\n\nThe Times Reviewer said the clever send up of Who Do You Think You Are? was a l revelation and a true comedy moment.\n\nAnd this week she had viewers in stitches when she swore twice while being interviewed by Alison Hammond on This Morning.\n\nShe doesn't like cooking or shopping.\n\n\"I've never cooked a meal in my life,\" she once boasted saying Paul took care of the domestic arrangements.\n\n.\"Although actually that's changing because I'm now on a plant-based diet, although my husband isn't. \"\n\nOn her website, Deborah says that her pet hate is shopping. She likes to make quick purchases and refuses to queue.\n\nShe's doesn't care about getting old\n\n\"It's not a beauty contest,\" she told one troll who attacked her apperance.\n\n\"Age happens. It's not a disease.\" \"I am not afraid of getting older and I celebrate it every year.\n\n\"I am not known for looking good, I'm known for my business acumen, and it's not on my radar of things I can advise on. I would never tamper with my looks. I love the fact that I have earned every line and wrinkle.\"\n\nHer early career helps her deal with trolls\n\nShe said at Weststar Holiday Parks there would be hundreds of thousands of people staying so whenever there was a customer complaint she took a step back.\n\n\"It probably had an awful lot to do with what was going on in their lives and very little to do with what was going on, so I didn't take it personally,\" she said.\n\n\"It's like that with online trolls. It's not personal. If they don't know me, they can say what they like. It really isn't going to touch me. But if I know a friend of mine says something negative then that hits home. That hurts because they know me.\"\n\nThere's more to her than you think\n\nAs a child, Deborah won a scholarship to Trinity College School of Music as a pianist. At the time, she was the youngest person to get this honour.\n\nEventually, she stopped playing as it felt like a chore to practise. As a girl she wanted to be a champion showjumper but was never good enough to go professional.\n\nShe had four honourary degrees from the University of Exeter business school, Staffordshire University, Keele University and Bath Spa University.\n\nShe could move to Canada\n\nLast year she told The Express that she was worried about changes such as the proposed Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill interfering with what she sees traditional British values.\n\n\"Until now I have never in my life considered leaving what feels like home to me,\" she said,\n\n\"But if this country stops feeling like home, and we start eating into the things that I hold dear, like freedom of speech and movement, then I would consider moving somewhere that did look more like home.\n\n“I love Canada. I'm certainly not there yet and I love this country but it just alarms me that it has even flitted across my mind.\"\n\nShe lords it over the other dragons\n\nWhen Sara Davies, 37, joined the panel of Dragons' Den for its seventeenth series as the youngest investor she said: \"It's horrendously competitive!\n\n\"Deborah is the worst for [bragging]. She'll be like the cat who got the cream. She will lord over us but to be honest, we're all the same!\""
