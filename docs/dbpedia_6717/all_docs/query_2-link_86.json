        "text": "As fans of the long-running BBC show know, the multi-millionaire businesswoman is easily its most fearsome Dragon. When Meaden is displeased, she purses her lips and narrows her turquoise eyes, a sign she’s about to tear into some deluded unfortunate.\n\nAnd while the former Strictly Come Dancing star can radiate smiley warmth, her straight talking has made her synonymous with business success, netting her more than £6million from 60 investments during 18 years on the show. So can it be true that the very same Deborah Meaden is now advocating for a dramatic overhaul of the business world for the good of its workers? Her firm gaze tells me yes.\n\nMeaden is backing a new study which has found three out of four workers are unhappy at work with many saying it is harming their physical or mental health, or personal relationships.\n\nThe research, from tech giants HP’s Work Relationship Index found 50 per cent of workers have also raised their expectations over how they should be treated over the past three years, with greater flexibility and say about when and where they work.\n\n“Sadly this didn’t come as a surprise to me,” says Meaden, 65. “But people are much happier to voice it now. Post-Covid, people are taking the time to think about what they want out of life. And that often means aligning what they want from work and outside of it.”\n\nShe continues: “When I started my work, I liked the independence of my own business, and benefiting from good decisions, and taking the consequences of bad ones. Now it’s clear the next generation want to feel like human beings. They want their leaders to have empathy and passion.”\n\nBut hang on a minute, does she practise what she preaches? While acknowledging the office equivalent of Sir Alex Ferguson’s hairdryer treatment of players – frightening staff into upping their game – is now antiquated, Meaden concedes her \"robust\" approach from days gone past may have lost her people.\n\n“I think trust builds trust and respect builds respect,” she says. “Not everybody is perfect, but as long as staff are trying it means good people will get better at their work. If people feel good about their workplace they’ll do a better job, and be more inclined to stay.”\n\nIn addition to being the longest-serving Dragon – she’s about to start filming the 20th series – Meaden, 65, co-presents The Big Green Money Show on Radio 5, supports numerous charities, and has accepted her publishers’ request for a second book giving children money advice. She also has investment stakes in 21 companies. Despite her punishing work schedule, Meaden calls her work-life balance “great”.\n\n“I love business, so I’m doing the thing that I love, but I’m also surprisingly good at enjoying my downtime and completely switching off,” she says.\n\n“I ride. I surprise a lot of people: I don’t get up at 6am, I get up about 8.30am or 9am. I go riding first thing whenever I’m in Somerset. My assistant Charlotte knows to put nothing in my diary in the morning. I am a naturally late worker. I’m not doing crazy hours.”\n\nShe’s learned that the key to happiness is enjoying what you do and making enough time for outside interests, rather than just working fewer hours.\n\n“There’ll be long periods of time when businesses are ticking over, so all we’re doing is just catching up, and then other times businesses are going through something big like an acquisition or an exit,” she explains. “Then I will be really busy.\n\n“But I’ve always advocated it’s no different to an athlete. You need to know in business when you can have your downtime, because you can’t keep yourself at peak performance all the time.” Do that, she says, and “you’ll get burnout”.\n\nShe has occasionally broken her own golden rule – with husband Paul Farmer, whom she married in 1993, once bearing the brunt.\n\n“The only thing that I get pangs of thinking ‘Maybe I shouldn’t have done it’ is when I was doing the Strictly 2014 tour on my husband’s 50th birthday,” she says. “I said ‘Well, we can have a party later’, but he said ‘No, I’m having a party on my night, and I’m going to have everybody there’.\n\n“So he went ahead without me anyway. You’re better off thinking about the consequences beforehand rather than thinking about them afterwards.\n\n“When deciding ‘Should I or I shouldn’t I?’ I think project forward to think, ‘How will I feel next year, am I going to regret it?’”\n\nMeaden “loved” her Strictly experience in 2013. “But I nearly talked myself out of it,” she says. “I thought ‘Why would I do Strictly?’ And then I thought ‘Because I want to’.”\n\nSadly, her Strictly dance partner Robin Windsor was found dead in a London hotel room, aged 44, last month. Paying tribute to Windsor on Instagram, Meaden wrote: “Robin was a good man. He was kind and incredibly generous, supporting so many charities, helping so many people and giving so much of himself wherever he went.\n\n“He lit up a room with his fun and energy and certainly his sparkle… he was never happier than when he was covered in crystals!”\n\nThere aren’t many other TV shows she would consider, apart from the comedy panel show Taskmaster hosted by Greg Davies.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

If I have any luxury in life, it’s having the space to take on and keep rescued animals. But as for clothes, I am sitting here in a pair of 30-year-old jodhpurs as we speak – and the smell that goes with it.”\n\nShe has six horses, plus dogs, cats, pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks and geese.\n\nAnd the travel fiend, who trekked around Central America in her younger days, didn’t fly long-haul “for six years”.\n\n“I’m not preaching to anybody else, but I don’t feel I can complain about the environment and then regularly jet off all over the place,” she says. “I’ve also drastically reduced my domestic flying and short-haul flights by about 90 per cent. I won’t unless I’m absolutely backed into a corner.”\n\nThen comes an admission…. “But this winter, after not having done anything for six years, we did go to Antarctica and we blew our entire carbon budget.”\n\nMeaden’s environmental protectionism dates back to the 1970s, when she wrote her Brighton Technical College dissertation about climate change. “It just seemed so bleeding obvious to me that we were heading into trouble,” she says. “It resonated with me, but I wasn’t living in trees. I didn’t feel as strongly about it as I do now.”\n\nBusiness is still her primary motivator, but it’s people rather than money that keeps Meaden on Dragons’ Den after all these years.\n\nShe explains: “I’ve had a handful of complete ‘that hasn’t worked’ [investments], but overall I’m definitely up financially by a lot, although it’s not going to make a big difference to my life money-wise.\n\n“But when you get involved with these businesses, you don’t just put your money in, the plan is to help them grow. I’m not doing it because it’s my income.\n\n“It’s very crass to say it’s not about the money in the early days – of course is when you don’t have any.\n\n“But there does come a point where you think, ‘Why do people keep doing this?’ I do it personally because I work with a lot of start-ups, and there’s a lot of energy and creativity around that. I like people, and working with people, when you feel they’ve got a tiger by the tail, there’s so much enthusiasm. And I like challenges, because I like solving things.”\n\nMeaden has now branched into writing children’s personal finance books. Following her first title for six to nine-year-olds, she’s focused on a second one for 12 to 16-year-olds out in May.\n\n“I don’t do it for the money,” she says. “I think our next generation has got a tough time ahead of them and the sooner we can get them forming a healthy relationship with money and helping it to improve their lives, the better.”\n\nSo now 64, and having had a skin cancer scare with squamous cell carcinoma, will Meaden work indefinitely?\n\n“Absolutely, I love it. Why wouldn’t I? I can’t imagine why I would stop doing a thing that I absolutely love and that energises me.\n\n“I am in a fortunate situation now where if I want to stop I’ll stop. But I don’t.\n\n“And I get my skin housekeeping done every year, but I’m completely clear, completely fine.”\n\nWith her unwavering loyalty to Dragons’ Den, how does she feel about a recent reinvigoration of the format, with guest names such as ex-England footballer Gary Neville muscling in on the panel?\n\nShe replies with her typical no-nonsense positivity.\n\n“Gary fitted in brilliantly. When any new Dragon comes in, it usually takes a few days for them to settle in and to understand how it all works, so we were a bit worried when we had guest dragons for one day. But it was like he’d been a Dragon forever. He’s a smart guy, he’s a funny guy, he’s a kind guy. We all got on with him very well.”\n\nWell, after a life built on innovation, it’s perhaps inevitable that Meaden would be excited by the new format idea.\n\nWe’ll have to watch and see if this Dragon can breathe some fresh fire into the business world itself."
