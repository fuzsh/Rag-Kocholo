        "text": "The website, www.themerchantfox.co.uk, which launched at the end of October, sells luxury goods including ties, bags, dressing gowns and leather accessories, as well as home furnishings, all 100% produced in the UK.\n\nAccording to Decca Lang, retail operations manager at the Merchant Fox, half of all orders placed so far have come from abroad including Australia, America and central Europe.\n\n“I think this shows that there is a real market for British provenance abroad,” she said. Lang added that most customers of The Merchant Fox are professionals working in the financial sector.\n\nMeaden invested in Somerset mill, Fox Brothers, in June 2009 before taking full ownership, together with co-owner and managing director Douglas Cordeaux, in November 2009. Textile-based products sold on the Merchant Fox site feature cloth woven at Fox Brothers.\n\nFor more on Fox Brothers, read this week’s Drapers Interview (December 16) with joint managing director Douglas Cordeaux."
