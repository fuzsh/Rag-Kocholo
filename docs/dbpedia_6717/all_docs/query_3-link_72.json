        "text": "Dragons’ Den: Contestants decline Deborah Meaden’s offer\n\nBut the 62-year-old entrepreneur has often found herself the target of online trolls who choose to criticise her appearance or her age, rather than celebrate her business acumen - not that she lets it bother her. \"It's not a beauty contest,\" was how the former Strictly Come Dancing contestant responded on one occasion. \"Age happens. It's not a disease.\" Her withering reply earned the approval of her 445,000 followers. \"I am not afraid of getting older and I celebrate it every year,\" explains Deborah, who made her estimated £40million fortune in import/export and ran a multi-million pound family holiday company.\n\n\"I am not known for looking good, I'm known for my business acumen, and it's not on my radar of things I can advise on. I would never tamper with my looks. I love the fact that I have earned every line and wrinkle.\"\n\nDeborah has called in the past for those who abuse others on social media - targeted in the Daily Express's Unmask The Trolls campaign - to be blocked and reported.\n\n\"I think what upsets me more than anything is when I see other people being upset by it,\" she says, although she adds: \"It doesn't really make me feel anything.\n\n\"One of my first business ventures was building Weststar Holiday Parks. We would have hundreds of thousands of people staying with us and, of course, we could get some things wrong, but whenever we got customer complaints, it was really helpful for me to take a step back. The minority were vociferous about how unhappy they were with certain things.\n\n\"But they don't know you and it's not personal. It probably had an awful lot to do with what was going on in their lives and very little to do with what was going on, so I didn't take it personally.\n\n\"It's like that with online trolls. It's not personal. If they don't know me, they can say what they like. It really isn't going to touch me. But if I know a friend of mine says something negative then that hits home. That hurts because they know me.\"\n\nShe will be back on our screens next week with the 18th series of Dragons' Den, which was filmed between the last two lockdowns.\n\nDeborah, also appearing on The Graham Norton Show tonight, says this series will reveal how the pandemic has prompted many of us to re-evaluate our lives and decide it's now or never for our business dreams.\n\nBut she and her fellow Dragons were looking for pitches that would outlive Covid. \"We all wanted to know about a business that's got a long-term future outside of lockdown,\" she explains.\n\n\"There's no point coming in and just selling hand sanitiser because the first question would be, 'OK, what's the future?'\n\n\"It's an interesting energy because people are thinking, 'What have we got to do to make sure that this is relevant going forward?'\n\n\"In the opening episode of the Den, one lady had started her business whilst on a sabbatical from the bank where she worked. She decided to make it full time when the pandemic forced her to switch focus from studio art classes to mindful painting at home with home art classes and art kits. She was pretty inspirational.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So it's definitely brought a change. And an energetic and exciting change.\"\n\nSpeaking of change, Deborah also reveals that recently she has been re-evaluating her own life and has even considered relocating abroad.\n\nA great champion of personal freedom, she is worried that some of the changes in Britain - such as the enforcement of lockdown rules and the proposed Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - could interfere with what she sees as our traditional values.\n\n\"Until now I have never in my life considered leaving what feels like home to me,\" she says.\n\n\"But if this country stops feeling like home, and we start eating into the things that I hold dear, like freedom of speech and movement, then I would consider moving somewhere that did look more like home.\n\n“I love Canada. I'm certainly not there yet and I love this country but it just alarms me that it has even flitted across my mind.\"\n\nDeborah has never been afraid to get behind a cause and is passionate about wildlife conservation, supporting charities including Tusk Trust, WWF and World Animal Protection.\n\nShe splits her time between houses in London and Somerset, which she shares with her husband Paul, two cats, three dogs, six horses, three pigs, four sheep, numerous birds and geese, and where she spent lockdown.\n\n\"I'm in a lucky place,\" she admits. \"You know, I've got space around me; I've got animals that need feeding and they keep you on your toes. I have no complaint other than a slight feeling of guilt.\n\n\"I'm just imagining the days when I was living in a flat in central London with no outside space and now, I'm thinking, 'My goodness that can't be easy.'\n\n“Of course, I do miss people face to face when dealing with my businesses and I really miss socialising, so it has affected me in that way.\"\n\nFor our Zoom interview, Deborah has her hair loosely pulled back in a ponytail and appears without a scrap of make-up. Yet it's hard to believe that she recently celebrated her 62nd birthday. So how did she mark the occasion?\n\n\"I didn't really do a lot, one day rolls into another now,\" she reflects. \"It's hard to remember what day of the week it is, let alone your birthday. But Paul might have made me a cake!\"\n\nIn fact Paul does most of the cooking in the house.\n\n\"I've never cooked a meal in my life,\" she chuckles. \"Although actually that's changing because I'm now on a plant-based diet, although my husband isn't.\n\n\"But fair dos, he's a wonderful cook and now he's cooking two meals, I kind of use whatever he cooks as a base but it's not really cooking. It's sort of chucking extra ingredients into what he's cooking as long as he has got meat in his.\n\n\"I also made the most awful birthday cake for him as well. Paul said, 'That's inedible Deborah'. But at least I gave it a go!\"\n\nThe entrepreneur says she feels healthier and more energised since giving up meat.\n\n\"I've got a lot more energy and actually I tell you what it's done for me, it's made me pay attention to my diet because obviously you've got to be careful when you're on a plant-based diet,\" she says.\n\n\"It's very hard to get protein and vitamin B12 but I definitely feel better, and I've lost a few pounds as well.\n\n\"What I hadn't realised is how much I move when I'm working. In London I'll walk up the stairs, I never use escalators, and I will walk where I can rather than get in a cab.\n\n\"I'm not that person who sits at a desk, and I've missed that, because I naturally kept fit.\n\n\"Now I have to think, 'Hold on a minute, I'd better get out and do some walking'.\"\n\nBut, while the wide open spaces of Canada may look appealing, Deborah believes that the vaccine rollout will boost Britain's economy.\n\nShe has had the AstraZeneca jab. \"The more we can go out and about safely, the better people are going to feel,\" she says.\n\n\"And the better they feel, the more likely they are to feel safe and they're going to be happier spending a bit more money - and jobs are safe.\"\n\nDragons' Den returns to BBC One and iPlayer from April 1 at 8pm"
