        "text": "Dragon’s Den favourite and businesswoman Deborah Meaden and her husband have a seriously impressive house.\n\nAfter selling her Weststar Holidays business for £33m in 2006, the couple bought the ten-bedroom mansion in Somerset, where Deborah was born.\n\nSince then, vegan Deborah has been renovating the home, using period accurate materials - close to environmentalist Deborah’s heart.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nIt also has a farmyard full of animals.\n\nAccording to The Sun, the two storey building was built in stages between 1565 and 1765, when it was bequeathed to William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham by Sir William Pynsent, 2nd Baronet, who did not want the house to go to Lord North.\n\nThe Grade II listed building also includes four bathrooms, many reception rooms and offices, a huge kitchen and living room.\n\nAs an animal lover, Deborah has certainly made the most of her countryside surroundings, and enjoys walks and rides on her horses - often sharing glimpses on her Instagram page of the beautiful grounds.\n\nSpeaking around the time they bought the property, she said: \"We have done it up in an ethical way, restoring whatever we can using traditional materials.\n\n\"That has cost us at least twice as much as it needed to. I always say, we were lucky to find our home, and it was lucky to find us.\n\n\"I do not know anybody in their right mind who would have spent the money on it we have – far more than we will ever get back.\"\n\nShe married her long-term boyfriend Paul back in 1993, after meeting in 1985.\n\nThe couple had split up for a brief spell whilst Deborah was travelling in Venezuela, but tied the knot on her return to London.\n\nThe couple do not have children, but reportedly own two cats, three dogs, six horses, three pigs, five sheep, ten chickens, six ducks and three geese.\n\nSpeaking to The Daily Mail about her rescue animals, she added: \"There's something in me that thinks, if I can, 'I'll give these guys a good life'.\n\n\"We've got two dogs, too, but they're definitely Paul's. I'm not a dog person. They require too much attention. I don't like anything with too much dependency.\n\n\"Children are very dependent, which is probably why we never had them.\""
