        "text": "Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary were forced to apologise to This Morning viewers on Wednesday after Deborah Meaden swore twice.\n\nThe 62-year-old Dragons' Den star turned the air blue as she spoke to the duo live from her home in Somerset.\n\nReferring to the popular BBC programme, Alison asked Deborah: \"How important is it for these entrepreneurs to be nice and personable?\"\n\n\"Erm, it's not a question of liking,\" Deborah replied matter of factly. \"I have to trust people.\n\n\"I don't want to be working in a business where I'm constantly looking over my shoulder or thinking, 'Do I know the truth? Are they actually presenting it as it is?'\n\n\"So I've got to be able to trust people. I don't know if I can say 'bullsh*t' but I'm going to! But I don't like bullsh*t!\" she blurted out as Alison quickly responded.\n\n\"Apologies about that, for that word,\" Alison said with a serious look on her face as Dermot rolled his eyes.\n\n\"I shouldn't have said that, sorry,\" Deborah quickly replied as Alison said: \"Don't worry, don't worry.\"\n\nAt the end of the interview, Alison joked: \"You can go and wash your mouth out now!\" as a mortified Deborah apologised again.\n\nViewers tuning in at home thought it was hilarious and took to Twitter to comment.\n\n\"I turn my back for five minutes and Deborah Meaden says bullsh*t live on #ThisMorning!\" one person joked.\n\nAnother tweeted: \"Deborah said bullsh*t. Funniest moment of 2022 on #ThisMorning.\"\n\nSomeone else tweeted: \"Deborah Meaden saying 'Bullsh*t' on live television...I salute her. Fabulous woman Xxxxx #ThisMorning.\"\n\nThis Morning airs weekdays at 10am on ITV and ITV Hub."
