        "text": "It wasn’t my closest encounter with wildlife, though. Working with the Tusk Trust charity a few years ago, we were flying close to the Somalian border in a helicopter when there was a call to say a well-known elephant called Mountain Bull had been shot. We arrived with a medical team, he was tranquillised and I held his trunk while he was treated. He survived, though probably not because of my nursing skills.\n\nWhen I stayed at a place called Jack’s Camp in the Makgadikgadi saltpan, in Botswana, I came back to my tent one night to find a shadow so huge, I thought it was a dinosaur. It turned out to be a porcupine the size of a collie, which made a swift exit. We still have some of its quills.\n\nI like to be active when I go away, but sometimes that can get out of hand. I went whitewater rafting on the River Pacuare in Costa Rica, which was running at grade 5 at the time. They had the weight in the boat set up wrong, so I ended up in the water four or five times. It was pretty hairy. At one point, I had to drag the entire group back on board. I’m 5ft 2in and my husband is 6ft 5in. It was not an experience I’ll be repeating.\n\nWhen I met Paul, we didn’t have much money, so we’d go backpacking. In the late 1980s, we toured Argentina, visiting the Iguaçu Falls, which are incredible. The water thunders down and makes the earth shake. On the way back to Buenos Aires airport, we found ourselves caught up in an attempted coup. We were in the departure lounge when several military helicopters landed on the tarmac and the airport was surrounded. We bribed a taxi driver to get us out, and holed up in a quiet B&amp;B, watching it unfold on TV. By the next morning, it had all blown over.\n\nOne rule I have is never to go away in summer, because I love to be at home then. I know that might sound odd, given the British weather, but our garden in Somerset is peaceful and the surrounding countryside is lovely. Why wouldn’t I want to be there?"
