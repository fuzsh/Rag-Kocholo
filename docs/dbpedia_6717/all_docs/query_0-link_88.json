        "text": "Dragons’ Den star Deborah Meaden has admitted she hasn’t quite mastered the toaster.\n\nThe entrepreneur, 64, who is thought to be worth around £40 million, confessed she has no idea how to work the kitchen appliance because she uses an Aga oven at their Somerset home.\n\nHowever, her inexperience with toasters proves to be her downfall on Taskmaster’s New Year Treat, presented by Greg Davies and Alex Horne, when she was challenged to ‘pop’ several items.\n\nStruggling with the common kitchen item, she is advised by Alex, jokingly, to talk to it on the upcoming episode which airs on Channel 4 on January, 2.\n\nRegaling the hilarious incident, she says: ‘Every now and then in life you do something and think, you stupid girl!\n\n‘I don’t have a toaster [at home]. We have an AGA, so I don’t use a toaster. I genuinely thought, what nobs do I press? And Alex [Horne] said to me, “It’s a voice-activated one.” What do you say to a toaster? I don’t know.\n\nLaughing, she continues: ‘When I’m doing it, I’m thinking, I don’t think this is right [laughs]. I collapsed with laughter. It’s the most stupid thing I’ve ever done’.\n\nDeborah launched her first business, which saw her export glass and ceramic products to high-end stores including Harvey Nichols, after moving to Italy aged 19.\n\nShe then joined family holiday park business, Weststar Holidays, in the 1980s before selling her stake in the company for millions of pounds and purchasing textile manufacturer Fox Brothers.\n\nDeborah ventured into TV with Dragons’ Den in 2006, however, she previously revealed she almost turned it down multiple times.\n\nOn Loose Women earlier this year, she revealed: ‘I actually turned it down three times. I said, “no, I don’t want to be in the spotlight”.’\n\nThe star added: ‘But actually, I don’t mind people approaching me in the street because they’re talking about the thing I love and they’re having a go. They’re not sitting on their sofas thinking, “oh, I’ve got a great idea”.’\n\nBut despite her inability to use toasters, Deborah did once reveal she shocks BBC fans when they spot her at second-hand stores.\n\n‘I buy second-hand clothes. People do double-takes when they see me in charity shops.’\n\n‘Now, everybody in the Den talks about sustainability, which pleases me,’ she added to The Mirror.\n\nAlso on the line-up for Taskmaster’s New Year Treat are Zoe Ball, Steve Backshall, Kojey Radical and Lenny Rush.\n\nTaskmaster’s New Year Treat airs on Channel 4 at 9pm on January 2.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Dragons’ Den star Hilary Devey’s ‘£80,000,000 fortune’ missing from her will\n\nMORE : Dragons’ Den’s Touker Suleyman lashes out at EasyJet staff after flight delay"
