I KNEW this one was for you!\"\n\nLew said: \"@DeborahMeaden what a woman!\"\n\nColin Macphee added: \"Great product. Great people. Great Dragon.\"\n\nBBC Dragon's Den said: \"What a dream team - or should we say a green team?\"\n\nEven new Dragon Steven Bartlett couldn't stay away from expressing his delight over the deal.\n\nHe tweeted: \"Great work from @DeborahMeaden. Honestly, a great business. Well done Dragon's Den.\""
