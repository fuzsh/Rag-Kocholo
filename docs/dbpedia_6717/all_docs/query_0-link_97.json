        "text": "DEBORAH Meaden has had quite the career as a business woman and a Dragons' Den star.\n\nDuring her success she has had her husband Paul by her side for support.\n\nWho is Deborah Meaden's husband Paul?\n\nDeborah tied the knot with her long-term boyfriend Paul in 1993.\n\nPaul and Deborah first crossed paths when he was working at her holiday company Weststar during his university break in 1985.\n\nThey separated briefly due to the fact she didn't want a family but after she took a trip to Venezuela, she returned to London and they got married.\n\nIn an interview with the Telegraph in 2011 Deborah revealed that she doesn't do any housework because Paul is in charge of the \"domestic chores.\"\n\nShe said: “I hate cleaning so as a student I used to work in a bar at night in order to pay someone to clean my flat. I’ve never told anyone that.\n\n\"I still don’t do any domestic chores; my husband Paul is in charge. It sounds terrible, doesn’t it?”\n\nShe has previously said that her \"husband is a fantastic cook.\"\n\nIn a previous appearance on the Graham Norton show, Deborah said that her Strictly experience made her love dancing and her husband Paul secretly took dancing lessons so they can enjoy dancing together.\n\nThey now live together in a stunning renovated 10-bedroom farm in Somerset which they bought after the 2006 sale of Deborah's Weststar Holidays business for £33m.\n\nThe two-storey building was built in stages between 1565 and 1765.\n\nThe Grade II-listed building also includes four bathrooms, multiple reception rooms and offices, a huge kitchen and living room.\n\nDeborah is often seen posting photos of her home on her social media pages.\n\nWales Online reported around the time they bought the property, she said: \"We have done it up in an ethical way, restoring whatever we can using traditional materials.\n\n\"That has cost us at least twice as much as it needed to. I always say, we were lucky to find our home, and it was lucky to find us.\"\n\nWhat is his net worth?\n\nPaul's personal net worth is estimated to be around £20 million.\n\nHowever Deborah has a reported net worth of around £40 million.\n\nShe has managed to earn her huge fortune as she founded a luxury British artisan products brand called The Merchant Fox in 2011.\n\nDo they have kids?\n\nNo, the couple have no children.\n\nHowever, they do own multiple animals together.\n\nThey reportedly have two cats, three dogs, six horses, three pigs, five sheep, ten chickens, six ducks and three geese.\n\nPreviously speaking to the Daily Mail, Meaden said liked rescuing animals as she wasn't keen on anything with \"too much dependency.\"\n\nShe said about adopting the rescue pets: \"There's something in me that thinks, if I can, 'I'll give these guys a good life',\n\n\"We've got two dogs, too, but they're definitely Paul's. I'm not a dog person. They require too much attention. I don't like anything with too much dependency.\n\n\"Children are very dependent, which is probably why we never had them.\"\n\nWhen is Dragon's Den next on TV and how can I watch it?\n\nDragon's Den returns to BBC One on Thursday, January 4, 2024 at 8pm.\n\nThe new series will air at the same time each following week.\n\nIf you miss any upcoming episodes, they will be available to watch on BBC iPlayer."
