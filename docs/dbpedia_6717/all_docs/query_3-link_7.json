        "text": "You might not know it, but Somerset’s home to quite a few celebrities! Here’s a few of the most rich and famous people who call Somerset their home…\n\n1. Glastonbury, Nicholas Cage\n\nFamous for starring in mega-grossing Hollywood blockbusters such as ‘The Rock’, ‘National Treasure’ and ‘Kickass’, Nicholas Cage seems to have swapped the glamour of Los Angeles for the peace and quiet of sleepy Glastonbury. He’s regularly sighted in and around Glastonbury in central Somerset, and is rumoured to have a home somewhere in Baltonsborough, in the surrounding countryside.\n\n2. Bath and beyond, Johnny Depp\n\nJohnny Depp is one of the most successful film stars in living history. He’s starred in some of the most successful films of all-time, including the ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ franchise and ‘Edward Scissorhands’ and has received both the Golden Globe award and Screen Guild Actors Guild award for Best Actor. He’s also one of the highest paid film stars to date, listed in the 2012 Guinness Book of Records as having earned approximately $75 million dollars.\n\nJohnny Depp has been spotted around Bath several times, and it’s rumoured that he owns several properties around the Somerset region.\n\n3. Bruton, Kevin McCloud\n\nStar of the iconic British home improvement television program, ‘Grand Designs’, Kevin McCloud is television presenter, as well as a designer, writer and an MBE-holder. He’s most well-known for his architectural programs that have inspired homeowners to transform properties up and down the country. He currently lives in a converted 15th century farmhouse on the outskirts of Frome.\n\n4. Taunton, Peter Andre\n\nSurprisingly, the singer and reality star Peter Andre has strong links to Taunton: his wife Emily comes from the county town. Most famous for his 90’s hit, ‘Mysterious Girl’, and for being previously married to glamour model and businesswoman, Katie Price, Peter Andre is rumoured to live somewhere around the Taunton area.\n\n5. Wellington, Deborah Meaden\n\nBusinesswoman and long-time judge on the ‘Dragon’s Den’ entrepreneur television show, Deborah Meaden has a long association with Somerset , was born in the county and lives on a restored farm just outside of Wellington. With a net worth of £40 million, Deborah Meaden has to be one of the richest celebrities that lives, for the majority of their time, in the county.\n\nHigh quality home improvements across Somerset"
