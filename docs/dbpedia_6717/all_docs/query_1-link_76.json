        "text": "This year's star-studded line up for The Great Celebrity Bake Off for SU2C has been revealed, with several West Country celebs in the mix for the charity edition of the hit show. 20 famous faces will be put through their paces under the watchful eyes of Paul Hollywood, Prue Leith, Noel Fielding, and Matt Lucas as they compete against each other for charity.\n\nFriends star David Schwimmer, who played Ross Gellar in the hit 90s sitcom, will finally be making an appearance on the competitive show. The US actor was originally meant to compete in a previous series before flaking right before filming due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nIn March of last year, judge and celebrity chef Paul Hollywood said that David is the star he'd like to see on Bake Off the most, and that he was meant to star in the show a few years ago before he \"let us down at the last minute\". David was asked to make an appearance after he declared his love for the show during an interview with the Radio Times magazine back in 2020.\n\nRead more: Deborah Meaden 'hurting' after 'very very sad day'\n\n\"It's competitive, but everyone's so lovely with each other,\" he told the publication. \"It's so not American!\"\n\nFlash forward three years, and David will finally be tying his apron amongst a galaxy of stars, including a few famous faces with West Country links. Somerset resident and Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden will be joining Plymothian Olympic diver Tom Daley and Exeter-dwelling comedian Mike Wozniak in the famous tent for a spot of baking in the name of Stand Up to Cancer.\n\nOther celebrities in the mix include presenters, actors, comedians, and musicians. Kitchen novice and The Repair Shop star Jay Blades will be testing his skills against Loose Women's Coleen Nolan, Top Gear's Paddy McGuinness and actors Jessica Hynes, Joe Thomas and David Morrissey. Also in the tent will be presenter AJ Odudu, Little Mix's Jesy Nelson, comedian Ellie Taylor and a number of comedians - Tom Davis, Rose Matafeo, and Lucy Beaumont.\n\nThe upcoming series of Celebrity Bake Off has already been recorded and is due to air next month. Host Matt Lucas will be appearing on the show for the final time alongside Noel Fielding as it was recently announced that the Little Britain star would be stepping away from the tent.\n\nEach week of the series will follow four celebrities as they compete against each other in a bid to win the coveted title of Star Baker. Whilst the famous faces tackle technical, signature, and show stopper challenges, they will also be raising vital funds for charity.\n\nClick here to subscribe to the South West TV Talk newsletter, bringing you the hottest headlines from the world of showbiz every week.\n\nRead more:\n\n£1.35m reopening for pub that appeared in Harry Potter film\n\nHappy Valley viewers react to Catherine Cawood and Tommy Lee Royce's dramatic final showdown\n\nEkin Su's Dancing On Ice exit sparks anger at ITV show's 'vile' audience and claims of double standards\n\nJeremy Clarkson becomes grandad as daughter Emily has baby"
