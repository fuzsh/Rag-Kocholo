        "text": "Deborah Meaden’s Sunday morning hasn’t gone exactly to plan.\n\nThe Dragons’ Den star has told a hilarious, erm, tail, of how she got locked in her horse’s stable for half an hour before making a dramatic escape.\n\nThe 63-year-old explained how the bottom bolt had ‘dropped off’ on the other side of the stable door, leaving the millionaire stuck with her rescue horse Fred.\n\nTo Fred’s ‘surprise’, the businesswoman then backed up to the far wall of the stable and used a bank of bedding to propel herself forward and ‘vault’ over the door to freedom, in what we can only imagine was a fairly horse-like manoeuvre.\n\nBut unlike her agile four-legged friends, the Dragon admitted the move was ‘not elegant’ – and exaggerated this point with three exclamation marks.\n\nDeborah is famously horse-mad and rescued Fred in 2017 after he was abandoned in a horsebox.\n\nAs well as Fred, at last count Deborah had four other horses at her Somerset home, which she also shares with her husband Paul.\n\nTaking to social media in what looked to be a hurried and typo-peppered Tweet, Deborah said: ‘Spent half an hour licked in stable… bottom bolt dropped. No one around… had to do bank up bedding and vault over door much to Fred’s surprise! When si say vault. It was not elegant!!!’ (sic)\n\nLicked was an unfortunate spelling mistake – we are sure the tycoon meant locked.\n\nThis comes just days after the TV personality shared the sad news with fans that her horse and companion of 16 years, Bertie, had died suddenly on January 20.\n\nShe wrote: ‘Very very sad day yesterday saying goodbye to Bertie. 34 years old, 16 years with me of sharp, naughty, funny and I will miss him terribly.’\n\nAs well as being a keen horsewoman, Deborah is an ambassador for Hoof, the British Equestrian Federation’s (BEF) Olympic legacy.\n\nA Dragon since series three of the BBC show, Deborah once told horse charity The Brooke that her ‘childhood dream’ was to be a showjumper.\n\n‘When I was 11 I got my first job which was to help lead pony rides up and down Minehead seafront,’ she said.\n\n‘I saved up enough money from that job to buy my first horse, Apollo, at 13.’\n\nBut things didn’t quite work out that way, when at 19 Deborah launched a glass and ceramics import company which would put her on the path to making her millions.\n\nToday, the star is said to be worth £40 million – you don’t get that from just horsing around.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Millionaire and Dragons’ Den legend Deborah Meaden gets her clothes in charity shops: ‘People do double takes’"
