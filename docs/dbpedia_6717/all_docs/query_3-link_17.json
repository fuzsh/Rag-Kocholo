        "text": "The star of the BBC Dragons’ Den TV programme, who lives in the Langport area, has thrown her weight behind ‘Into Somerset’ a new campaign to attract business investment in the county.\n\nDeborah says Somerset offers several advantages for businesses, including excellent transport links, communications, a skilled workforce, entrepreneurial spirit – and a wonderful lifestyle.\n\nShe said: “I feel very lucky to live and work in Somerset. It is a lovely county. Somerset has just about everything.\n\n“I could choose to live and work anywhere, but I have chosen Somerset because it gives me the kind of rural life that I want, but with direct and easy access to London and overseas.\n\n“Businesses need good people and Somerset is attracting a lot of very good people who want to enjoy its quality of life.”\n\n“I can get on the train in Taunton and I am in Paddington in under an hour and 40 minutes. If I lived on the outskirts of London, I would not be able to get in that quickly.”\n\nShe has filmed a new webcast for Into Somerset – click on the Related Link, right, to watch it.\n\nInto Somerset is targeting businesses in five key sectors which are already strong in the county – advanced engineering and aerospace; business services; creative; food and drink; plus energy and environmental technologies."
