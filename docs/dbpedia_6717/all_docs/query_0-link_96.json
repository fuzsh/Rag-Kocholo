        "text": "With\n\nher blunt approach, straight talking and razor-sharp business sense,\n\nDeborah Meaden has been dubbed the female Alan Sugar. She’s been a\n\nregular fixture on TV’s Dragons’ Den panel, investing 21 times since she\n\njoined in 2006 and becoming one of the most feared, and admired,\n\ndragons of the series.\n\nMeaden had revealed an impressive business\n\nhead from an early age; when she was seven she set up a flower stall on a\n\nneighbour’s drive, as she realised the location was better. By 11 she\n\nwas working at summer jobs to buy a pony and pay for its livery, and at\n\n16 she left school in Essex to study business at Brighton Technical\n\nCollege.\n\nLike Sugar, Meaden skipped university and went into business, launching her own glass import company at the age of 19.\n\nDespite\n\nhaving little capital and almost no experience, she quickly began\n\nsupplying upmarket stores including Harvey Nichols. Then the business\n\nran into problems. Despite having sole agency rights, its goods began\n\nappearing in other high-street shops, and after 18 months Meaden\n\nrealised that it was time to walk away. It was, she says, an important\n\nlesson that laid the groundwork for future business success.\n\n“I\n\nconsider it a failure to slog on with a business that is going to die\n\nsooner rather than later. And that’s a skill I’ve had from my very early\n\ndays. It’s difficult to realise that you’re not going to make any money\n\nout of something. A lot of people are blinded. They think, ‘I’d feel\n\nlike a failure’.”\n\nMeaden’s first business may have been a failure,\n\nbut it stands out as one of the few blips in an otherwise exemplary\n\ncareer. After walking away from the export company, she went on to\n\ninvest in a series of small enterprises, including one of the first\n\nStefanel textile franchises in the UK, before joining family holiday\n\npark operator Weststar Holidays. Seven years later, she led a management\n\nbuyout and acquired the majority shareholding in the business.\n\nThat\n\nwas in 1999. By 2007, the firm had sold to Alchemy Partners for £83m\n\nand it remains one of Meaden’s most successful turnarounds to date. It\n\nalso gave her the capital and the credibility to establish herself on\n\nthe Dragons’ Den panel, a move which allowed her to get stuck into what\n\nshe does best – investing in up-and-coming enterprises.\n\n“I have\n\nagreed 30 investments totalling nearly £2m since being on the show and\n\nthere are plenty more to come,” she says. “Oddly, I get criticised for\n\nnever investing but factually only Theo has agreed more offers than me\n\nwhen you take into account how many series we have all been in.”\n\nMeaden’s\n\ncurrent investments range from the sophisticated (The Merchant Fox, an\n\nonline store she launched at the end of 2011, selling British-made\n\nluxury goods) to the bizarre (Billy and Margot, a start-up that sells\n\n‘iced treats for dogs’).\n\nShe often shows particular interest in\n\nenvironmental or charitable enterprises; her portfolio includes a\n\nsolar-power company based in the West Country and a system called\n\nEcoinomy that incentivises employees to save company resources by giving\n\na percentage of the savings to their chosen charity. When her schedule\n\nallows, she also involves herself in charitable initiatives.\n\nShe\n\nleads a somewhat hectic existence between her Georgian farm in Somerset,\n\nher home in London, where she conducts business meetings, and\n\nManchester, where Dragons’ Den is now filmed. The fact that she can\n\nco-ordinate her hectic life is down to her husband of 20 years, Paul,\n\nwho runs the domestic side of their life. “He organises our social life\n\nand keeps the farm running.” He is also a fabulous cook, a good thing as\n\nMeaden is barely able to make a sandwich for herself and, left to her\n\nown devices, eats pickles directly out of the jar.\n\n“There are times\n\nwhen I get the balance wrong, but mostly I have a nice life,” she says.\n\n“I get to meet the most amazing people and, when I want to, I can just\n\nrelax.”\n\nHer desire to encourage small, worthwhile start-ups and to\n\ninspire up-and-coming entrepreneurs has motivated her to write a book\n\naimed at aspiring business people. Common Sense Rules is part\n\nautobiography and part business bible; a guide for entrepreneurs that\n\ndraws on Meaden’s own experiences for illustration. It was written, she\n\nsays, not just to offer advice, but to explore the mindset that many\n\nentrepreneurs have in common. “Put in a nutshell, the entrepreneurial\n\nmind is founded on that least common of commodities – common sense. And\n\nit tells you when you need to forge ahead and when you should cut your\n\nlosses.\n\n“The fact is that true entrepreneurs never stop learning from their own successes and failures, and from one another.”\n\nMeaden’s\n\nbusiness approach marries self-confidence and a willingness to listen\n\nto the ideas and perspective of others. She puts her success down to her\n\ncool, critical attitude, which ensures that she stays focussed at\n\nimportant moments. She also characterises herself as ‘extremely honest’\n\nand admits that this can sometimes come across as harsh, particularly in\n\nthe context of Dragons’ Den. However, she’s also big enough to admit\n\nthat her innate ‘straightforwardness’ can sometimes be a weakness. “I\n\ndon’t suffer fools gladly and at times I know I can be too blunt. When I\n\nwas MD of Weststar it was my job to get the best out of people. My\n\ndirect style meant that I ended up with robust people because I’m robust\n\nmyself. If I have a weakness, it’s probably that I’ve lost some good\n\npeople who didn’t thrive in that environment.”\n\nHer TV persona is\n\nfamously hard-hitting and feisty, so it might come as a surprise to\n\nlearn that Meaden has a softer side. In her spare time, she enjoys\n\npottering with her horses and has a passion for art and antiques that\n\noften sees her trawling reclamation yards and junk shops.\n\n“I’m a\n\nvery straightforward person and would find it impossible to be something\n\nI’m not. It’s a serious business investing money and I’m not aid of\n\ntelling it as it is, if needs be. Having said that, it’s the true me in\n\none specific situation, so it’s not a full and rounded picture. I’m\n\naware that I can come across as quite tough and serious,” she says\n\nwistfully, “and I don’t really have a problem with that. I just hope\n\nthat people realise that there’s more to me than they see on\n\ntelevision.”\n\nPhoto credit: Rex Features\n\n(Article published courtesy of Stream Publishing.)"
