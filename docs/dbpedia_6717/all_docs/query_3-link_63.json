        "text": "Exclusive collection of luxury British made items\n\nThe story of The Merchant Fox began with the collective vision of Deborah Meaden and Douglas Cordeaux to bring the skills and crafts of the British Isles together in a one luxury brand. The Merchant Fox is a collaboration between Fox Brothers and Co, and a select number of manufacturers producing fine luxury goods with provenance. Passionate about the manufacturing heritage of the British Isles and the future of manufacturing in Britain, The Merchant Fox is a collection of the finest luxury goods being made in Great Britain today.\n\nThe Merchant Fox is the retail arm of Fox Brothers and co. the woollen mill established in 1772 recognised for producing the world's finest flannel and worsted cloths. Launched in November 2011, The Merchant Fox offers a broad range of stylish gentlemen’s accessories, interiors pieces and bespoke services. Included in the collection is the Fox Reefer jacket, an extensive collection of classic English caps and ties and sterling silver cufflinks. These are complimented by luxury leather satchels and Globe-Trotter cases. The leather bags and belts are made from the finest oak bark tanned leather; tanned in the last remaining English tannery based in Devon.\n\nAfter the success of a month long Pop up shop in Mayfair, London in December 2012, The Merchant Fox opened its flagship store in March 2013. Located in the old Counting House of Fox Brothers mill, in Wellington, Somerset, across the road from the repetitive chug of the looms, the luxury products sit alongside Fox Brothers extensive archive and collection of historic artefacts.\n\nThe Merchant Fox provides a service to design your own heritage piece to be handed down to the next generation. This bespoke service delivers the opportunity to select cloth from Fox Brothers including limited edition, exclusive fabrics, to be made into your own bespoke item such as a dressing gown, of which can be hand embroidered with ones initials. A complete bespoke range for the home from individual hand woven wicker baskets to a full interior design service is also available. Every feature of an interior can be looked at from lighting to furniture.\n\nWhether maker or material, The Merchant Fox offers assured British provenance and the finest product."
