        "text": "The well known, Somerset-based businesswoman and Dragons' Den Investor, Deborah Meaden, was so impressed by the Solar PV installation at her home she decided to invest in the people behind the installation and set up the South West based renewable energy firm EWS Solar Power.\n\nTechnical know-how and Installation Expertise\n\nThe expertise behind EWS Solar Power is headed up by Adam Day and David Little, with over 20 years of electrical installation experience between them. David and Adam recognised the potential in solar power and identified a gap in the market for a solar power company that offers a real commitment to excellence in terms of both customer service and the products on offer.\n\nHere's what Deborah Meadon has to say about EWS:\n\nIn a new and rapidly developing marketplace, it is important that people are able to trust their installers to provide fair and unbiased recommendations, quality installations and good service at the right price. That is exactly my experience with the team at EWS. We have a great opportunity to revolutionise the way we produce energy in this country and at last the Government have made Solar PV a very real option for most people through the feed-in tariff.\n\nEWS are based in Somerset and cover the whole of the South West of England. They offer both solar PV panels for electricity generation and solar thermal panels for hot water and heating. David Little explains:"
