        "text": "Somerset-based serial entrepreneur and Dragon’s Den regular Deborah Meaden is today receiving an honorary degree from Bath Spa University – one of five presented this week during its annual graduation ceremonies.\n\nOther recipients are former Bath Spa governors Stella Pirie OBE and Mary Toman, artist Michael Craig-Martin CBE and American saxophonist, composer and arranger Alfred ‘Pee Wee’ Ellis.\n\nMs Meaden, pictured, is receiving an honorary doctorate for outstanding services to the world of business. She launched her first business straight out of college. With several businesses in the leisure and retail sector under her belt she became managing director of Westar Holidays, overseeing its expansion from one to five holiday parks, leading a management buyout and its eventual sale for £83m in 2007.\n\nStella Pirie OBE and Mary Toman were the university’s longest-serving governors and have been awarded Honorary Fellowships in recognition of their outstanding service to the university.\n\nMichael Craig-Martin, a contemporary conceptual artist and painter who famously fostered the talent of the Young British Artists, was be given an honorary doctorate for his services to art on Wednesday while Pee Wee Ellis, a leading figure in African-American music and funk music who know lives near Frome, was presented with an honorary doctorate in recognition of his services to contemporary music yesterday.\n\nVice-chancellor Prof Christina Slade said: “The achievements of our honorary graduates in their respective fields are a huge inspiration to our students today, who are studying courses with a strong emphasis on combining creativity, culture and enterprise. Each of the honorary graduates reflects the aspirations of many of our graduating students and we are delighted to welcome them to our fellowship.”"
