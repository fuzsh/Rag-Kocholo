        "text": "These are the Somerset villages where you might spot a celebrity this Christmas after a number of famous faces decided to move to the county in recent times.\n\nNumerous celebrities now call Somerset their home with several household names leaving the limelight and escaping the mayhem by moving to our peaceful county.\n\nThis Christmas, you could spot a celebrity or two shopping for last minute presents or getting into the festive spirit amongst the rural beauty of Somerset.\n\nREAD MORE: Why I'd be delighted to see Christmas cancelled this year\n\nREAD MORE: The Christmas treats that could be toxic for your dog\n\nThese are just some of the famous faces you might find in your local shop.\n\nNicolas Cage\n\nHollywood action movie star Nicolas Cage is known for his frenetic performances on the big screen, which is why the star of Face/Off and Con Air probably wanted a quiet, relaxing surround for his home.\n\nWhile he might spend a lot of time in the United States, he apparently has a country retreat near Baltonsborough. Cage was also spotted in a pub in Wells three years ago, where he acquainted himself with the locals by getting in a round.\n\nHermione Norris\n\nCold Feet star Hermione Norris is often seen out and about around Yeovil and apparently lives in Odcombe, a village not far from the town.\n\nDeborah Meaden\n\nDragons' Den star Deborah Meaden has celebrated more than 10 years on the show, which has seen her put her money where her mouth is with a number of business investments. In her down time, she can be found at her home on the Somerset Levels, near Langport.\n\nCameron Mackintosh\n\nWe can’t be certain of this one, but there are rumours that theatre legend Cameron Mackintosh lives in or near Bruton. He has been spotted in the area and also donated £25,000 to the the former Conservative MP for Somerton and Frome, David Warburton..\n\nSean Bean\n\nOne of the original Game of Thrones stars, Sean Bean has taken to life in the West Country so much that two years ago, he married Ashley Moore at Axnoller Farm near Beaminster. It is thought he recently bought a home near Wincanton.\n\nJohnny Depp\n\nAgain, we can’t be sure about this one, but Johnny Depp is one of the most successful film stars in living history, it’s expected that he wants a secret escape. He has been spotted around Bath several times, and it’s rumoured that he owns several properties around the Somerset region.\n\nPeter Andre\n\nReality TV star Peter Andre cemented his Somerset links when he married Taunton doctor, Emily MacDonagh. The couple and their family have a house a few miles outside the county town, which is why the pop star is occasionally spotted shopping there.\n\nVal Stones\n\n'The Great British Bake Off' elevated Somerton's Val Stones to national treasure status, as viewers of the baking show took her into their hearts. She's still making cakes and last year, she incredibly walked the Great Wall of China in aid of NSPCC.\n\nLynne Franks\n\nThe inspiration for Jennifer Saunders' characters in Absolutely Fabulous , Lynne Franks is a recent addition to Somerset, after she took over the former Red Lion in Wincanton, for her new business venture.\n\nKevin McCloud\n\nThe presenter of Channel 4's 'Grand Designs' has succumbed to the charms of Bruton, which has become the place in Somerset to find a celebrity resident. The British designer has a few abodes across the UK, with his newest home in the Peak District costing a cool million.\n\nRhys Ifans\n\nAnother to have apparently fallen for all that Bruton has to offer, the Notting Hill film star has got his own little piece of Somerset to return to when he fancies a break from making movies.\n\nMartin Roberts\n\nThe 'Homes Under the Hammer' star has lived in a village just outside Bath for the past 20 years. He had a resurgence in the public eye after making a memorable trip to the Australian jungle for ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!\n\nValerie Singleton\n\nJust over the border, former Blue Peter presenter Valerie Singleton has been a resident of Corton Denham, near Sherborne, for many years. She was awarded an OBE for services to children's television in 1994."
