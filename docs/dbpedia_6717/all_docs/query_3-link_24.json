        "text": "Dragon's Den star Deborah Meaden has criticised plans for a huge new allotment site near Bristol. The entrepreneur released a statement on social media following a visit to the Roots site in Abbots Leigh where they are turning a large field next to the entrance to Leigh Woods into a 700-plot allotment site.\n\nShe wrote: \"Britain is severely Nature depleted and we should all be worried because if nature fails, so do we. We have lost 97 per cent of our meadows over the last 100 years, and the creatures that depend on them are at huge risk.\n\n\"This makes every meadow, however small hugely important and we can't go on destroying them little by little. Whilst the provision of allotments is a great idea it needs to be in appropriate areas, enhancing, not depleting the local nature.\"\n\nRead next\n\nScooters block pavements 'forcing elderly and disabled into road'\n\nDozens of student flats on hold after failure to agree plans\n\nThose against the scheme have been fighting the plans for almost two years. The application for the work to transform the field was approved by North Somerset Council last year. This week, Avon & Somerset Police have ordered work on part of the 25-acre site to cease.\n\nThe police force confirmed action had been taken saying: \"Following reports nesting skylarks were being disturbed, officers from our rural crime and neighbourhood policing teams visited land in Abbots Leigh.\n\n\"They were joined by an independent ecologist who, while conducting a survey, found evidence of nesting skylarks. Destruction or the damaging of these nests would be contrary to Section 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. A notice to stop works was issued on Monday, 13 May, requiring construction to stop in a section of the site until 31 August.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the group Save Abbots Leigh Green Belt said: \"The meadow is a haven for wildlife, including rare bats, butterflies and nesting skylarks. It's enjoyed by countless walkers using the popular Monarch's Way footpath.\n\n\"Locals were quick to alert the company about the endangered bats recorded in the area, badger setts on the hedge line, and skylarks that nest in the meadow every year. Roots chose to ignore the ecological concerns raised by the locals and ploughed on regardless.\n\n\"The only consistent response from Roots, was to mount a social media campaign to paint the village residents as 'NIMBYs' telling their followers that they are being targeted by a \"hate group\", a reference to a community Facebook page which posted regular images and videos of the threatened meadow and skylarks.\"\n\nRoots had previously stated: \"We have already started work which will increase biodiversity in linear habitats by as much as 100%. This includes planting fruit trees and native woodlands, reinstating more than 400 metres of natural hedges and further plans to establish ponds, create insect habitats and increase species diversity in wildflower areas. We want to create more than allotment spaces; we are calling for a growing revolution in the UK and want to provide people with the means to access it.\""
