        "text": "Somerset is set to raise its profile with potential inward investors as a new advertising campaign highlighting the county as a great place to do business is to be launched on catch-up TV channels alongside popular shows such as Downton Abbey and Grand Designs.\n\nThe advert has been commissioned by inward investment organisation Into Somerset and challenges the stereotype of country living, highlighting some of the dynamic businesses and business people that are based in Somerset. Advocates of the county such as Deborah Meaden, Michael Eavis and Roger Saul will appear alongside industry leading companies including AgustaWestland, Ariel Motor Company and Gooch & Housego to draw attention to the extensive and exciting business opportunities on offer within Somerset.\n\nThis is the first time that TV advertising has been used to promote the county’s business credentials, with the month-long campaign scheduled to reach almost half a million viewers.\n\nLaunching on 29th October, the advert will be shown to ITV Player and 4 on Demand audiences in London and the South East during the commercial breaks for key dramas such as Downton Abbey, Grantchester and Doc Martin, as well as popular home focused shows including Grand Designs and Location, Location, Location.\n\nRupert Cox, CEO of inward investment organisation Into Somerset, said, “The evidence suggests that catch-up TV is regularly used for times when people want to ‘escape’. The Into Somerset message to escape the rat race and seize the opportunity to change your life for the better fits very well with this, both from a professional and lifestyle perspective.\n\n“We’re really excited about the new Into Somerset advert and are enormously grateful for the support and enthusiasm of the people and companies in Somerset that have worked alongside us to create it – they are a real testament to the supportive nature and vibrancy of this outstanding county.”"
