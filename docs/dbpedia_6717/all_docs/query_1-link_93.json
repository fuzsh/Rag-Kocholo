        "text": "Deborah Meaden wouldn’t mind us saying she’s best known as the most ‘stony faced’, most ‘dragon like’ member of Dragons’ Den. And we wish we could tell you she is the opposite off camera. But she isn’t.\n\nShe assures us she doesn’t have an ounce of softness in her body, and trust us, we tried to find out what makes her go gooey, but she’s too no-nonsense to mess about with silly questions like that. But please don’t get us wrong, when we meet her, she’s charming, polite, funny and actually very warm.\n\nShe lives a picturesque and relaxing-sounding home life in Somerset with husband Paul and \"Friday the cat, three dogs, five horses, 11 chickens, four ducks and three very angry geese\".\n\nHowever, this clearly chilled-out side of her still doesn’t mean we’d want to work for her. Oh no. Business Deborah would turn softies like us into quivering wrecks if we were to pitch on the new series of Dragons’ Den. And she certainly wouldn’t be dishing out any hugs to comfort us.\n\nShe is bang on time, bursting through the doors of the hotel café, fixing her hair after having run down the street to make it as the clock struck 3pm. She has a surprisingly limp handshake, with no hugs or air kisses, but as soon as she sits down, she’s smiling from ear to ear (she points out her laughter lines straight away), but explains she has to dash for yet another meeting after 30 minutes.\n\nRuthless, yet with an undeniable amount of kindness and passion (and time to squeeze in a mini stint on Strictly in 2013), we admire this straight-talking woman. And it’s got her far. Maybe we should all be a bit more Debs. Oh wait, it’s Deborah. Sorry about that, ma’am.\n\nDeborah talks deals, digs and domestic duties…\n\nAs you enter the Den, do you get yourself in the zone and put on your poker face?\n\nNo. I look like that because it’s genuinely my money I’m working with, and my time. So there’s no messing around. When I do the show, I don’t do anything else. I tell everyone to not phone me or distract me in the months I’m filming.\n\nMy husband says I’m a nightmare. When I go home for the weekend he’s not even allowed to say things like, \"Oh, the weather’s looking grey out there,’ because I’ll say, \"What colour grey? How long has it been grey?\" Because I’m in 1,000-questions mode. Annoying.\n\nHow much has Dragons’ Den changed your life?\n\nIt’s certainly changed people around me. I can see people walking into meetings being so nervous to meet me. But it’s fantastic! Nobody hassles me any more, nobody answers back. Now it’s, \"Whatever Deborah wants, Deborah gets.\"\n\nWhat is your patience like out of the Den?\n\nNon-existent. I’m deeply impatient. If I can’t park directly in front of somewhere, I go home.\n\nReally?\n\nI am terrible. When I buy stuff, I want it straight away. If it says two to three weeks delivery – no way. I will find somewhere that will deliver it that afternoon. Maybe\n\nI could wait until morning at a push. It’s a deeply unattractive trait.\n\nHave you ever gone to some extreme lengths to get something, then?\n\nMy family tell me the reason I find service so amazing is because people will go to the ends of the Earth because they know who I am. But I’m careful people don’t put themselves out too much just because it’s me. When I stop doing Dragons’ Den it will be a rude awakening! I’ll have to wait two days for things. Yikes.\n\nYou’re not really showing us you’re not as scary as your DD persona… Are you not a softie inside?\n\nNo. Don’t be mistaken.\n\nThere’s not one thing that would make you go all gooey?\n\nNo. I mean, I’m OK. I care a lot about animal welfare and children. Although\n\nI don’t have children myself. My friends would say I’m not the person to go to for tea, a cuddle and sympathy, because I can’t deliver. But if you want something sorted out and need a champion who will stand by your side, that is me.\n\nWhat gets your goat the most?\n\nI cannot stand unfairness or unkindness. I am massively against things like foie gras, and when I’m out for dinner with my husband I can see him looking at the menu thinking, \"Oh God!\" Because it’ll be on there and I have to deal with it. My husband spends his life saying, \"Please don’t say anything,\" but I do. I don’t think being forthright or blunt is unkind.\n\nSo if someone was like that back to you, you wouldn’t take offence?\n\nNot at all. The world would be a lot easier if everyone said what they meant. There’s way too much faffing around. Plus, if you dish it out, you have to be able to take it.\n\nYou said people don’t cross you now – do you always win arguments?\n\nI haven’t been wrong in 10 years. Since the day I started the show I haven’t been wrong once, it’s amazing. But I like someone who will confront and deal with things. If I see injustice it’s red mist, and even I don’t know what’s going to happen next. But generally, I think I’m easy to be around because I am upfront. I rarely lose my temper.\n\nWe’re struggling to believe you rarely lose your temper, Deborah!\n\n[Visibly annoyed] Look, I hate bullies. One time in the office, a computer engineer made a receptionist cry. I had my door open and saw the whole thing. I was livid. Now, I probably should have dealt with it differently, in a separate room rather than publicly. But I was so angry I didn’t care if I reduced him to tears, you cannot make a young girl, early on in her job, cry at work. That is bullying. I absolutely lost the plot.\n\nIs the way you are anything to do with being a successful woman in an industry dominated by men?\n\nNo. I think the best thing any woman can do is ignore her gender. I’ve met so many people, men and women, who’ve wanted to kick me down. But I don’t allow them.\n\nYou feed bullies if you pay them attention. Everyone has prejudices and I don’t want to deal with people who have issues. I’m not interested and they better get over it.\n\nDo you remember the moment you realised your life had changed?\n\nIt didn’t change overnight, but I get the occasional moment. I know I’m very lucky in my home. I want horses, so I have horses. But Paul and I wander around a lot and say, \"Did we ever think we would have this life?\" We never get bored of it. I really appreciate it.\n\nHave you got so much money you’ve lost the concept of it?\n\nSometimes it happens to me. I get a weekly massage as horse riding hurts my back. And I forget that’s not normal, and it’s not cheap. So every now and then I have to\n\nbe reminded.\n\nAre you a spender or a saver?\n\nSpender. What’s the point of saving? What are you going to do if you don’t spend it? Visit it in the bank? So I’m a spender, but I will not waste. If I’m overcharged for something I cannot stand it.\n\nWho wears the trousers in the relationship, you or Paul?\n\nBoth of us. We both take the lead as we both have things we’re just better at doing.\n\nAre you a domestic wife?\n\nTruthfully, no. The duties are to look after the home, the garden, the animals. And, well, I don’t [laughs] . Paul loves cooking. We have our own vegetable patch and we rear our own meat. It’s beautifully looked after, but then we eat it. I think if you eat meat, it’s good to know what’s involved.\n\nFinally, what would you miss if it all went away tomorrow?\n\nThe freedom to do whatever I want to do. All material things are replaceable. But\n\nmy time isn’t.\n\nNew Dragons' Den returns tonight, BBC2, 8:15pm."
