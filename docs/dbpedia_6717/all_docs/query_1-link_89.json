        "text": "The South West is an incredibly desirable place to live and is filled with stunning scenery, beautiful beaches, and lots of places to escape the crowds. So it's little surprise that movie stars, footballers, TV presenters and more choose to call it home.\n\nYou will find a number of household names dotted around the region if you look for them. And some of them are very sociable, reports Somerset Live.\n\nLocals have shared on social media how one A-list actor treated the entire pub to a drink when he appeared at their local boozer. There have also been tales of Chris Martin performing at The Stag Inn in Hinton Charterhouse on his way home from Glastonbury Festival.\n\nREAD MORE:Child 'dragged from sea' and flown to hospital from beach\n\nBelow is a list of some of the famous faces you might find in quiet West Country villages and hamlets.\n\nNicolas Cage\n\nHollywood action movie star may have found the pace of his films quite pacy, which is why the star of Face/Off and Con Air probably wanted a quiet, relaxing surround for his home.\n\nWhile he might spend a lot of time in the United States, he apparently has a country retreat near Baltonsborough.\n\nHe was also spotted in a pub in Wells last year, where he acquainted himself with the locals by getting in a round.\n\nHermione Norris\n\nCold Feet star Hermione Norris is often seen out and about around Yeovil and apparently lives in Odcombe, a village not far from the town.\n\nKelsey Grammer\n\nThe star of the stage and screen, known for his iconic performances as Dr Frasier Crane in Cheers and Frasier, as well as the voice of Sideshow Bob in The Simpsons, often pops up in Portishead as his wife Kayte Walsh is from the coastal town.\n\nKelsey and his wife Kayte have been married since 2011 and share three children together. She grew up in Portishead and is the daughter of former Bristol City footballer Alan Walsh.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Grammer said: \"I love the people in Portishead, and I love the time we spend there. It's a good spot. We've actually bought a house there. We've bought a little place we're going to be working on.\"\n\nAsked if he might be around more frequently, Grammer replied: \"Yeah, probably. We won't be taking up residence for a while, but yeah, we're pretty excited about it. The little view of Wales over the channel there, it's really nice.\"\n\nDeborah Meaden\n\nDragons' Den star Deborah Meaden has celebrated more than 10 years on the show, which has seen her put her money where her mouth is with a number of business investments.\n\nIn her down time, she can be found at her home on the Somerset Levels, near Langport.\n\nDavid and Victoria Beckham\n\nDavid and Victoria Beckham bought their grand barn conversion in Great Tew, near Chipping Norton, for £6,150,000 in December 2016. They reportedly spend weekends and holidays at the property with their children Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper and stayed at the nine-bedroom home during the pandemic.\n\nCameron Mackintosh\n\nWe can’t be certain of this one but there are rumours that theatre legend Cameron Mackintosh lives in or near Bruton. He has been spotted in the area and also donated £25,000 to the successful Conservative candidate for Somerton and Frome, David Warburton's campaign.\n\nSean Bean\n\nOne of the original Game of Thrones stars, Sean Bean has taken to life in the West Country so much that earlier this year, he married Ashley Moore at Axnoller Farm near Beaminster. It is thought he recently bought a home near Wincanton.\n\nJohnny Depp\n\nAgain we can’t be sure about this one but Johnny Depp is one of the most successful film stars in living history, it’s expected that he wants a secret escape.\n\nHe has been spotted around Bath several times, and it’s rumoured that he owns several properties around the Somerset region.\n\nPeter Andre\n\nReality TV star Peter Andre cemented his Somerset links when he married Taunton doctor, Emily MacDonagh. The couple and their family have a house a few miles outside the county town, which is why the pop star is occasionally spotted shopping there.\n\nVal Stones\n\nThe Great British Bake Off elevated Somerton's Val Stones to national treasure status, as viewers of the baking show took her to their hearts.\n\nShe's still making cakes but is currently walking the Great Wall of China in aid of NSPCC.\n\nLynne Franks\n\nThe inspiration for Jennifer Saunders' characters in Absolutely Fabulous , Lynne Franks is a new addition to Somerset, after she took over the former Red Lion in Wincanton, for her new business venture.\n\nKevin McCloud\n\nThe presenter of Channel 4's Grand Designs has succumbed to the charms of Bruton, which has become the place in Somerset to find a celebrity resident.\n\nThe British designer has a few abodes across the UK, with his newest home in the Peak District costing a cool million.\n\nRhys Ifan\n\nAnother to have apparently fallen for all that Bruton has to offer, the Notting Hill film star has got his own little piece of Somerset to return to when he fancies a break from making movies.\n\nMartin Roberts\n\nThe Homes Under the Hammer star has lived in a village just outside Bath for the past 19 years. He had a resurgence in the public eye after making a memorable trip to the Australian jungle for ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!\n\nValerie Singleton"
