        "text": "It seems Hollywood heartthrob Brad Pitt, 60, has decided to spearhead an Oscar campaign for his close friend and colleague, Bradley Cooper. The former honored Cooper on Thursday by bestowing upon the Maestro star the Santa Barbara Film Festival’s highest honor, Outstanding Performer of the Year, for his portrayal of Leonard Bernstein in the 2023 biopic flick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrawing inspiration from his own mentor, Robert Redford, Pitt recognized the same level of skill and potential in Cooper and made a conscious effort to make sure he got the credit he deserved (probably at the Oscars as well).\n\nAnd for that, the actor-turned-producer is equating him with the Captain America: The Winter Soldier actor. Redford’s influence had a positive impact on people from an early age, including Pitt, who was among those who benefited from the former’s influence from a young age.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrad Pitt Can’t Stop Singing Praise To Bradley Cooper at Santa Barbara Film Festival\n\nBrad Pitt’s decision to lead an Oscar campaign for Bradley Cooper brings new dimensions to the practice of highlighting the latter’s achievements. The former made an unexpected appearance to honor the 49-year-old actor from A Star is Born, who is currently nominated for an Oscar for producing, co-writing, and acting in Maestro.\n\nIn reaction to Cooper’s recent work, Pitt declared (through THR):\n\n“For me, Maestro is a masterwork.”\n\nIn order to highlight Cooper’s exceptional talent and his potential to become a major player in the industry, Pitt compared him to the beloved and classic Hollywood icon Robert Redford:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Yes, it takes great actors, but it also takes great construction. And I’m telling you, not since [Robert] Redford have I seen anyone do it so well.”\n\nWith Maestro up for seven Academy Awards, Pitt concluded his remarks by expressing his optimism for Cooper’s performance (via PEOPLE):\n\n“He’s been nominated 12 times and I really, really hope that this is his year, because he’s willing, but if it’s not, it’s okay, everyone knows it’s just a matter of time, he is one and only Bradley. And truly Brad is okay, he’s fine. He’s used to it. He’s a Philadelphia Eagles fan.”\n\nMaestro, which starred Carey Mulligan as well, was nominated for four Golden Globes, seven BAFTA Awards, and seven Academy Awards. The film, co-produced by Martin Scorsese and distributed by Netflix, was recognized as one of the top 10 movies of 2023 by the American Film Institute and the National Board of Review.\n\nBrad Pitt: Robert Redford ‘Was one of my heroes’\n\nRobert Redford, both an acting legend and a revered filmmaker, has mentored Brad Pitt throughout his career. The former’s guidance has had an important impact on the Academy Award-winning star’s achievements and status in the industry. In 2020, Pitt told Collider:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Redford was one of my heroes, growing up … He and Newman, and these guys, were really big in my house.”\n\nAccording to Fox News, Pitt started landing uncredited roles as soon as he got to Hollywood in 1987. However, those salaries did not cover the rent, so the actor had to take on odd jobs in order to fund his aspirations. According to Vanity Fair, he was cast as the seductive yet cunning cowboy J.D. in Ridley Scott’s Thelma & Louise in 1990.\n\nHowever, his big break did not come until the following year, when he was cast in the lead role of Redford’s coming-of-age drama, A River Runs Through It. Pitt finally began to receive positive reviews at the age of 27. Even though he is not happy with his work, he partly attributed it to being enamored with Redford. In 2011, he told Entertainment Weekly:\n\n“Maybe it was the pressure of the part, and playing someone who was a real person — and the family was around occasionally — and not wanting to let Redford down.”\n\nHe believed that, as a result, he might have underestimated the character. Pitt informed Collider:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’m sure I was more trying to impress him, each day. I should’ve been focused more on the part, itself.”\n\nOn the other hand, Redford saw something special in him right away, even though Pitt thought his performance lacked impact. The actor-filmmaker, 87, informed Closer Weekly in 2020.\n\n“When he first came in, he had a look about him, I said, ‘Yeah, he’s going to succeed’.”\n\nAnyway, as Pitt launches this grandiose Oscar campaign for Bradley Cooper, his likeness to Redford expands the global audience’s perspective. Bradley Cooper is undoubtedly going to continue to shine and win hearts and accolades along the way, especially with Hollywood’s brightest star leading the way.\n\nMaestro is currently available on Netflix and in theaters."
