        "text": "So you want to learn about awards season, the never-ending footrace that annually dominates, terrorizes, and energizes the film industry. When does the season actually begin, and when does it end? What’s the purpose of all those film festivals in faraway locales? What goes into an Oscar campaign, and why, exactly, must Oscars be campaigned for in the first place? What makes the Oscars so all-encompassingly important for movies, anyway?\n\nThe answers you seek can be found below—starting with a definition of what we mean by “awards season” in the first place.\n\nTHE TIME FRAME\n\nThe truth is that for the movie industry, awards season never really ends. When one Oscar ceremony concludes, insiders immediately begin plotting for the next cycle—and so on and so forth. It’s like an election, except they prepare to run for president every year, instead of every four.\n\nThe more targeted answer is that awards season generally kicks off in September, and ends, of course, with the Oscars—i.e. the Academy Awards, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, more commonly known as the Academy. The Oscars are usually held in late February or early March—though that will change in 2020.\n\nWHY SEPTEMBER?\n\nTo make sure everyone in the Academy remembers your movie during the Oscar-voting window, of course. Feature-length films are eligible for Oscars if they screen theatrically between January 1 and December 31 of a given year. (So the Oscars held in 2019 actually honor the best films of 2018.) Nomination-round voting lasts for one week in January.\n\nGiven that, studios usually release their best movies in the fall, in order to ensure that voters won’t forget about them before voting begins. Many opt for a prime Thanksgiving or December 25 slot—which allows a movie to get holiday spending bucks and be the freshest film on an Academy member’s mind right before they vote. This timing explains why good movie options are so hard to find at the start of the new year, and why movies like Get Out, which was released in February 2017—an entire year before the Oscars for which it was eligible—are anomalies. It’s typically impossible for a film to maintain hype for an entire calendar year.\n\nTo get even more specific: awards season really, truly begins with the Toronto International Film Festival, which takes place in early September. That competition, with its convenient date and easy access for North American media and industry types, has become known as an event that separates awards wheat from the chaff. But more on that below.\n\nTHE FESTIVALS\n\nThese film competitions are where the biggest projects typically make their debut and vie for early attention. Here are some key fests to know:\n\nSundance\n\nFounded in 1978 as the U.S. Film Festival, and taken over by Robert Redford in 1985 and renamed in 1991, the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, was once a wild, snow-covered playground for scrappy indies by future auteurs (Steven Soderbergh, Quentin Tarantino). The fest takes place in January and is the first major competition of the calendar year, giving industry figures and film fans alike a chance to scope out the movies that could shape the narrative and break big, once they secure distribution for later in the year.\n\nSpeaking of: Sundance also gives indies a chance to make eye-popping deals. In 2017, streaming services like Amazon and Netflix went on rampant buying sprees, throwing money around in the hopes of landing projects that could carry them all the way to Oscar glory. (Among other movies, Amazon acquired Manchester by the Sea, which did go on to land a best-picture nomination—and a best-actor win.) Both companies have cooled on Sundance a bit in the last year, however, which has pundits wondering if the festival has lost its awards-bait spark—though that would not necessarily be a bad thing. Still, Sundance has cachet, and it always draws both veterans and rising stars—all of whom gladly trudge through snow to check out the films that will (hopefully) be among the best of the year.\n\nTelluride\n\nWhile other festivals can boast visibility and scope, this Telluride, Colorado, event is much more intimate, set against a gorgeous mountain backdrop. Telluride takes place over the course of four days—this year, it went from August 31 to September 3—and draws a mix of filmmakers, critics, pundits, and more, who come for its secretly selected lineup and variety of seminars and conversations with talked-about stars. Like TIFF, which begins right afterward, Telluride is another festival to keep your eyes on, if you want to know which movies are going to have a busy awards season. Per Variety, it’s hosted seven of the last eight best-picture winners, giving five of them world premieres. Not bad for a fest that only has a few dozen films in its main lineup.\n\nNaturally, there are dozens more festivals to keep your eyes on, from the 56-year-old New York Film Festival, with its reliable, distinguished main slate, to the poppy SXSW Film Festival and the Switzerland-based Locarno Festival. Each one has its quirks and its perks, but only a few set the course for the season.\n\nTHE CAMPAIGNS\n\nIf this world were pure, Oscar wins would always be strictly merit-based. But because there are just too many movies fighting for headspace, and too much money riding on the movies and stars that land top honors—and, of course, because films are not an objective art—winning a statuette means fighting all the way to Oscar night.\n\nIf you are an actor and your performance has awards potential, you spend awards season doing the following: frequently flying between New York and Los Angeles to attend private screenings and do Q&As for Academy members; showing up at every luncheon and awards ceremony and gala of note, sometimes multiple ones a day (which requires a pricey and savvy stylist, lest you be photographed in the same thing twice and miss the opportunity to become a fashion icon en route to Oscar gold, à la Lupita Nyong’o; and sitting for near-daily interviews with reporters for radio, online, video, and magazine pieces, hopefully even nabbing a cover or two.\n\nIf you’re Melissa Leo, you’re also posing for your own “For Your Consideration” ads—i.e. campaign ads directly geared toward industry voters, and more traditionally put out by studios. They will likely appear online, on billboards, and in the glossy pages of trade publications like Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, for a tidy sum: billboards can cost up to approximately $25,000 a month, while a full-page trade placement could be around $70,000. Those ads are augmented by DVD screeners that are sent out to voters and influencers, so that they can watch Oscar-hopeful films from the comfort of their own homes. All told, studios can spend up to $10 million vigorously promoting a potential award winner.\n\nNo awards-push conversation is complete without hat-tipping the publicists who are pulling strings behind the scenes. They are tough, exacting generals with a friendly veneer, who spend awards season mindfully hovering over interviews, scheduling every little thing, prodding their clients down red carpets, and watching out for any hurdles that could damage a campaign (like, say, an old scandal that comes back to rear its ugly head, or an off-the-rails interview destined to go terribly viral). Plenty of publicists have become famous for successfully guiding clients down the awards track; see, for instance, Peggy Siegal, heralded most recently for helping Leonardo DiCaprio finally secure his Oscar. (And boy, did he have to fight for it, serving face time at 53 red carpet events that year alone.)\n\nBeyond publicists, there are also dedicated awards-season strategists who focus solely on helping studios and streaming platforms worm their way into the awards conversation. Disney, for example, has hired Cynthia Swartz to help get Black Panther into the best-picture race), while Netflix has hired Lisa Taback, a former Weinstein Company honcho who has since lent her services to the successful campaigns for both La La Land and Moonlight.\n\nSpeaking of . . . you can’t really talk about the madness of awards campaigns without mentioning the brothers Weinstein, particularly Harvey (who was run out of the business in 2017 after being accused of sexual misconduct by more than 80 women; he has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex). Harvey was so untouchable for so long, in large part because he was known for masterminding aggressive awards campaigns—and getting results. His pugnacious tactics flew in the face of the notion that moneyed studios will edge out indies every time, and forever changed the way that Oscar campaigns are waged—which is why he’s among the most-thanked people in Oscar history.\n\nJust take a look at Weinstein’s very first big campaign, in 1990, for My Left Foot. To get voter attention, he orchestrated meet-and-greets with the film’s team, organized screenings that were strategically close to where members lived and went on vacation (Los Angeles, Hawaii, Aspen), and sent Daniel Day-Lewis to Washington, D.C., to show his support for the Americans with Disabilities Act, as his character in the film has cerebral palsy. The film was nominated for five Oscars, winning two for best actor (Day-Lewis) and best supporting actress (Brenda Fricker). With time, Weinstein’s stunts only grew bigger and more notorious—more strategic parties, more smear campaigns against competitors, and more personal calls to Academy members to ensure as many votes as humanly possible. He turned campaigning into a vicious contact sport, which is how it largely remains today. (Though no one else appears to be as notorious as Weinstein.)\n\nIn recent years, the Academy has attempted to curtail out-of-control campaigning with specific regulations, such as forcing hopefuls to send screeners via an Academy-approved mailing house, and limiting the number of screenings that members can attend for certain films. But forcing hopefuls to jump through a few extra hoops won’t stop the beast that is campaigning.\n\nTHE AWARDS\n\nBefore nabbing an Oscar, hopefuls compete in a variety of lead-up contests, including but not limited to these key ceremonies:\n\nNational Board of Review Gala:\n\nEstablished in 1909, the National Board of Review is a prestigious body whose voting members include a select group of students, “film enthusiasts, filmmakers, professionals, and academics.” They vote on all the usual categories (best film, director, etc.), in addition to categories like best breakthrough performance and the freedom of expression award. The winners are then announced online, typically in late November or early December. The New York-based gala, which is not televised, takes place in January, drawing stars and press alike to a ceremony where nerves are not quite as high, since everyone knows the winners ahead of time.\n\nThe N.B.R. is an idiosyncratic awards body, as the winners often don’t line up with the eventual Oscar winners. Take 2017, for example. The N.B.R. lavished The Post with best picture, best actor (Tom Hanks), and best actress (Meryl Streep). Meanwhile, the film went home empty-handed at this year’s Academy Awards. The N.B.R. tends to do its own thing, which makes it a nice surprise in an awards season that often rewards the same front-runners over and over.\n\nGolden Globes:\n\nBetter known as the televised ceremony where the champagne flows freely, the stars get drunk, and the voting body—the Hollywood Foreign Press Association—picks predictably unpredictable winners. The Golden Globes are typically the first major televised ceremony of the calendar year, taking place in January. It’s an incredibly glitzy affair celebrating the best in both film and TV, drawing a wide swath of the industry who turn up for the booze-fueled party, usually hosted by a big star (in past years: Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey, and Amy Poehler). Like the N.B.R., the Globes don’t correlate very well with the Oscars, likely because the H.F.P.A. is also idiosyncratic: the somewhat mysterious voting body is made up of 90 or so foreign journalists working for global outlets, but based in Southern California.\n\nThe Globes set themselves apart by splitting films into categories like best musical or comedy (an increasingly outdated designation) and best drama. There are also special honors like the Cecil B. DeMille award, which has gone to luminaries like Oprah Winfrey and Streep, both of whom sizzled prime time with rousing speeches. The trademark of the ceremony is its sometimes-erratic nominations and winners (The Martian for best comedy! The Tourist for, well, anything); the key to loving ’em is not taking any of it too seriously. But for the winners, it’s a nice moment of high visibility in a blur of an awards season.\n\nFilm Independent Spirit Awards:\n\nThis ceremony, which usually takes place the day before the Oscars, turns its cheek away from polished studio offerings, instead honoring the best independent releases of the season. The ceremony typically takes place in a decked-out tent by the Santa Monica Pier, an arty reprieve from stuffy ballrooms and gilded auditoriums. While it’s not as prestigious as the Oscars, this ceremony draws big-name artists who come in the name of celebrating independent cinema. It’s also a great opportunity for tiny, beautiful movies to get much-needed recognition that they can’t count on from the Academy. There are also a number of hyper-specific honors, from the John Cassavetes Award to the newly established Bonnie Award, which honors mid-career women directors; the inaugural recipient was Chloé Zhao. Winners are voted on by a body that includes a mix of directors, actors, writers, and critics, among others, as well as the organization’s board of directors.\n\nThe Golden Raspberry Awards:\n\nAmid all the prestige and hype are the Razzies, as they’re commonly called, the ceremony dedicated to honoring the very worst films and performances of the year. Founded in 1981, the ceremony has ebbed and flowed in the public consciousness, gaining steam when stars like Halle Berry and Sandra Bullock pop by to poke fun at themselves and pick up their dishonorable prizes. The voting body for the Razzies is comprised of anyone willing to spend $40 on a membership.\n\nAll of the Guilds\n\nThese are the awards voted on by peers, for peers—in groups including the Directors Guild of America, the Producers Guild of America, and the Writers Guild of America. Each separate association holds its own tony ceremony, though the flashiest of all is the Screen Actors Guild Awards, a televised ceremony that takes place in late January and draws the biggest performers. Here, many winners lovingly dedicate their acceptance speeches to their fellow thespians, in between telling glow-up stories about what it was like to get their precious SAG cards.\n\nCritics’ Pick\n\nThe season also contains its share of awards voted by critics, for critics (er, for the critics’ peace of mind). The main ones to follow are the New York Film Critics Circle, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and, biggest of all, the Critics’ Choice Awards. The latter is a televised ceremony that usually takes place in mid-January and honors both film and television. It’s a splashy way for the critics to make their two cents known on a grand scale; its voting bodies consist of the BFCA (Broadcast Film Critics Association, which boasts around 300 critics) and BTJA (the Broadcast Television Journalists Association). It should come as no surprise that, for the most part, the critics end up selecting spot-on nominees; this past year, every core-category winner—including best picture, director, actor, and actress—lined up exactly with the Oscars.\n\nTHE ACADEMY AWARDS\n\nBehold, the alpha and the omega, the ceremony that glues this entire industry together: the Academy Awards. The event is presided over by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which was spearheaded by MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer in 1927. Originally conceived as a way to benefit the industry, the Academy was soon established as a nonprofit organization with five branches: actors, directors, writers, producers, and technicians. The first Academy Awards took place in 1929; the prize, a solid bronze, 24-karat gold-plated statuette of a knight holding a sword and standing on a reel of film, was originally called the Academy Award of Merit, but later picked up a little nickname: Oscar.\n\nWhy Oscar? Potential origin stories run the gamut, but three particularly strong ones reign. The first is that Academy librarian-turned-executive director Margaret Herrick said that the statue looked like her Uncle Oscar. The second is that Hollywood columnist Sidney Skolsky, inspired by an old vaudeville joke, started calling the prize Oscar after getting bored with writing “the gold statue of the Academy” in his columns. The third comes from Bette Davis, who said the statuette’s rear end resembled that of her husband’s at the time, whose middle name was Oscar.\n\nWhen people refer to the Academy Awards, they’re typically talking about the big, televised ceremony that happens in late February or early March. But the Academy also hands out other awards given at separate ceremonies. First, there are the Governors Awards (so named because they’re selected by the Academy’s board), which present honorary statuettes in three categories: the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award (given to producers), the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award (given to stars whose humanitarianism has benefited the industry), and the Honorary Award (for lifetime achievement). The awards, whose winners are pre-announced in September, are presented in November at a black-tie gala; tiny snippets of the acceptance speeches are featured during the big Oscar telecast.\n\nThere’s also the Sci-Tech Awards, which honor the best in film innovation via categories including the Technical Achievement Award, the Scientific and Engineering Award, and Academy Award of Merit. Unlike the Oscars, winners here aren’t always given a knightly statuette; instead, winners in those first two categories are awarded a certificate and a bronze tablet, respectively. The victors are announced prior to the ceremony, which takes place in the weeks before the Big Oscars.\n\nLast but not least are the Student Academy Awards, an international film competition that rewards college and university students around the world who submit animated, documentary, and narrative works. These awards take an Olympic twist, as contestants are fighting to win a gold, silver, or bronze medal (and lifelong bragging rights). Fifteen winners were selected at the 2017 Student Academy Awards. It’s nice company to be in, as past winners have included Spike Lee and Robert Zemeckis.\n\nWhy do the Oscars matter so much?:\n\nIf you’re one of those superior beings who thinks that film competitions actually don’t matter, because art is too subjective to judge—then, my god, what are you even doing here?\n\nIf you’re not: barring all grandiose, philosophical reasoning, the Oscars matter because they are the industry’s biggest and glitziest way to celebrate the best movies of the year, as selected by elites across various cinematic fields. They’re a way to recognize movies beyond the box office. And the reverse is true as well: if a small film gets Oscars attention, it can get a healthy boost at the box office, thus extending the life and legacy of said film. Which, in turn, is priceless.\n\nWhat’s eligible?:\n\nThe rules vary from category to category, but for feature-length movies, it boils down to a central rule: they must be released in theaters before December 31. Quite a few categories have further, more specific requirements, including best animated feature, short (animated or live action), documentary, doc short, foreign-language film, original song, and score. That last category caused a bit of controversy in 2016, after expected nominees Arrival, Manchester by the Sea, and Silence were all disqualified, because they apparently used too much pre-existing music—to the point where the Academy determined that listeners would not be able to distinguish those selections from each film’s original score cues. The lesson here? Read those eligibility rules carefully, because once decisions are made, they’re final.\n\nWho picks the nominees and winners?:\n\nThe voting body for the Academy Awards is comprised of more than 7,000 members across various practices (or “branches”), including actors, writers, directors, and cinematographers. There are only a few ways to get into the Academy; either you gain membership after being nominated for or winning an Oscar, or you can be sponsored by two current Academy members. From there, the qualifications for a potential candidate vary from branch to branch.\n\nIn theory, the Academy is made up of the best of the best in the industry (another reason the award is so prestigious and competitive), and its members represent a wide swath of professions. In reality, the makeup of its voting body has long been a source of problems for the Academy. In 2012, the Los Angeles Times revealed that an overwhelming percentage of Oscar voters were white men—and a homogeneous pool is a great way to get a homogeneous group of winners, therefore creating a homogenized film canon. This lack of inclusivity came under fire in 2015, when every single Oscar acting nominee was, like so many years before, white—leading to the viral hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, created by April Reign.\n\nThe Academy, under the guidance of former president Cheryl Boone Isaacs, has attempted to rectify its lack of inclusivity by widening its member invitation pool and imposing new rules on how long a member can retain voting status, all with the goal of doubling the number of diverse members by 2020.\n\nHow does voting work?:\n\nAfter the nominations are announced, voters get a week to choose their final favorites. (In 2019, they will have from February 12 to February 19.) Members vote via paper or online ballots. Sounds simple enough—except, that is, when you’re voting for best picture. Instead of just picking their favorite movie, voters have to rank all nominated films in order, from their favorite to their least favorite. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm that’s tallied Oscar votes for decades—and will continue to do so, despite recent challenges—then has its accountants go through and kick out the movie that gets the least votes overall, repeating this process until they end up with the film with the most votes overall. Thus, the win doesn’t always go to the movie with the most first-place votes. The best-picture statuette is given to a selection of the film’s producers, by the way.\n\nWhat happens after you win?:\n\nWhy, you get a little gold man on your mantel forevermore. You get the prefix “Oscar winner” permanently attached to your name. Honor, glory—all that. But there are also tangible financial benefits. Movies that win best picture typically experience an “Oscar bump,” a major increase in box-office ticket sales. Take 2017 winner Moonlight, for example. In one post-Oscars weekend, the film earned an extra $2.5 million in sales, easily doubling its slim $1.5 million budget. Actors can also (often, but not always) land red-hot roles thanks to the their newfound prestige. In addition, winners get an invitation to the Academy—keeping the tradition going forever and ever and ever . . ."
