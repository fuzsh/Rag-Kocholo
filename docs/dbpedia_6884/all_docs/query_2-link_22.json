        "text": "Rochester Institute of Technology welcomes an Academy Award winner as this year's featured guest for the Horton Distinguished Speaker Series.\n\nRobert Redford, internationally acclaimed for his work as a motion picture actor, director and producer, will speak at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 23, in RIT's Gordon Field House and Activities Center. The event is sponsored by RIT Student Government and is among the highlights of the 2004 Brick City Festival.\n\nIn his debut as a feature film director, Redford earned a Goldon Globe Award, a Directors Guild of America Award and an Oscar for the 1980 movie Ordinary People. Since then, he has received numerous other award nominations for various behind-the-scenes projects in Hollywood. As an actor, Redford received an Academy Award nomination for his performance in The Sting (1973).\n\nA strong advocate of independent filmmaking, Redford founded the Sundance Institute in 1980, which sponsors the annual Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The festival is considered the top venue for the presentation of independent films in the United States.\n\n“It's a great honor to welcome such a legendary figure to campus,” says Sheila Sarratore, president of Student Government. “Mr. Redford's work with the Sundance Film Festival is a great source of inspiration for RIT's talented film students, and his work on behalf of various environmental causes offers inspiration for all of us.”\n\nJack Garner, film critic for the Democrat & Chronicle, will serve as moderator for Redford's presentation.\n\nTickets-$3 for students, $8 for student family members, alumni, faculty and staff, and $12 for the public-can be purchased at the candy counter in RIT's Student Alumni Union or by phone at 585-475-5210.\n\nStudent Government created the Horton Distinguished Speaker Series to profile nationally renowned speakers addressing relevant social and political issues. Past speakers include Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, and other prominent names such as Lech Welesa, Spike Lee, Colin Powell, Ben Stein and Earvin “Magic” Johnson.\n\nFrank Horton, retired congressman and a longtime RIT supporter in whose honor the series is named, passed away on Aug. 30.\n\nNOTE: Other highlights of the 2004 Brick City Festival at RIT include:\n\nRochester Philharmonic Orchestra; free concert featuring popular hits and music from classic movies; Thursday, Oct. 21, at 7 p.m.; Gordon Field House\n\nMusical artist Kanye West; College Activities Board concert; Friday, Oct. 22, at 8 p.m.; Gordon Field House\n\nComedian David Spade; cast member of ABC's 8 Simple Rules and former Saturday Night Live star performs live; Saturday, Oct. 23, at 8 p.m.; Gordon Field House"
