        "text": "As one of country music's own certified cowboys, Cody Johnson seems like a natural fit for a cameo — or more — on Yellowstone.\n\nHis song \"Dear Rodeo\" features in the show's fourth season, and other country stars like Lainey Wilson, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill have all appeared onscreen in the Yellowstone universe. In fact, show creator Taylor Sheridan offered Johnson a role in Season 5, but he turned it down due to scheduling conflicts, he said in fall 2023.\n\nIn a new interview with Audacy's Rob + Holly, Johnson says nothing's changed with those scheduling conflicts — but that he and Sheridan are working on some other plans.\n\n\"We've tried a couple times [for Yellowstone] and my schedule is too busy to put aside the time,\" Johnson explains. However, he's still got hopes for making some acting dreams come true — either on the small or big screen.\n\n\"We're looking ahead to the future,\" the singer continues. \"There's a few movie things where I'm like, 'Look, if you guys give me the notice, I can make this happen.'\"\n\nWhile a Johnson guest spot on Yellowstone itself is unlikely — the show is scheduled to wrap late this year — it's certainly possible that there will be a Sheridan-backed Western film featuring Johnson at some point in the future.\n\nWho Else Has Said No to a Yellowstone Role?\n\nThere are plenty of other stars who have passed on the hit Western series.\n\nRobert Redford, Cole Hauser and Sam Elliott all turned down roles for various reasons.\n\nThe show's star, Kevin Costner, famously quit in the middle of Season 5."
