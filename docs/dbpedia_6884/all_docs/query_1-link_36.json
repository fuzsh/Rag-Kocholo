        "text": "Here’s a new idea I have for the blog: showcasing a star at the end of each month by commemorating some of their best work (in my eyes) on screen. Two rules I have for the series: 1) alternating between male and female (after all, it’s only fair!) and 2) the star does not HAVE to be living.\n\nTo start off the new series, I was thinking who I could best commemorate in a blog entry for his/her excellent body of work through the years. After blogging about recent film viewings last night, I thought and thought and thought, finally arriving on the one and only….\n\nROBERT REDFORD!\n\nOne of my absolute favorite actors of all time, Robert Redford has been gracing the silver screen for over five decades. And at 77, he still has it in him, evident from his recent performance in J.C. Chandor’s disaster film, All Is Lost (discussed extensively in my last blog post: https://classicfilmfanatic.wordpress.com/2013/12/31/oscar-season-approaches-recent-film-viewings-of-potential-contenders-for-the-gold/).\n\nIn my mind, Robert Redford is an actor with great versatility yet a very uniquely similar charm seen in each film that he does. He’s not afraid to be different or to showcase his own idea (as actors should) of his characters, but at the same time, he never overdoes it on the screen. He is subtle yet powerful, conveying great emotion, humor, and personality in each and everyone of his characters.\n\nWhile I know people do recognize Redford as one of the greats, I personally think he is a bit underrated. Say what you want to this, but I think sometimes people look past Redford’s power as an actor; particularly in films where he co-stars with another big household name like Paul Newman or Dustin Hoffman. To me, Redford is equally good if not better than Newman and Hoffman and in films like The Sting and All the President’s Men, he commands attention on the screen by making the audience invested in his characters.\n\nOne reason why people may sometimes look past Redford’s amazing acting skills is because he is also a fabulous director. While his body of work as a director is far smaller than that of his acting, Redford’s ONE Academy Award was for directing the wonderful 1980 film Ordinary People (Check out my post on this film/Redford’s work here: https://classicfilmfanatic.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/easter-break-film-2-ordinary-people/).\n\nTherefore, I think some people think of his acting and directing as equal. Don’t get me wrong: Redford is also a fantastic director, but he truly belongs ON SCREEN much more than he does off screen. His work behind the scenes may be among the best as well, but sometimes directors’ work goes a bit unnoticed. Because Redford commands attention from the audience with his characters, I think his work on screen is just so much more intensely wonderful.\n\nNow that I’ve spoken about Redford’s style, versatility, and greatness, let me point to some of his specific performances that I enjoyed. I will forget about All Is Lost (since I blogged about it yesterday) and Ordinary People (because that’s his work as a director and this is about his acting). I also speak fairly extensively of Redford’s performance in the 1974 version of The Great Gatsby here: https://classicfilmfanatic.wordpress.com/2013/06/20/the-great-gatsby-a-comparative-look-at-two-film-versions-of-the-phenomenal-american-novel/, so I will refer you to that if you’re interested!\n\nI am left, therefore, with the three other Redford films that I have seen. Yes: in total, I’ve only seen five of his films, BUT….I still see his greatness enough to feature him!\n\nFirst: 1969’s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, a film that I feel is a bit dated to today’s standards, but nonetheless still very good. With a great cast, soundtrack, and landscape, there is still a heck of a lot of movie magic in it even if it doesn’t please audiences of the 21st century like it did when it first came out. In this film, Robert Redford gives a fantastic performance as The Sundance Kid, performing alongside the great Paul Newman but truly standing out as superior in my book.\n\nAs I mentioned, it is Redford’s effectiveness on screen to grab the audience’s attention in every moment that he is on screen that grabs me the most. Unlike Paul Newman (who I also think is one of the greats), Redford does it with much more subtlety. Maybe this is because Newman is simply more of a dramatic actor, but I think it is also Redford’s time. As 10+ years Newman’s junior, Redford’s style differed greatly in this fact and he was not afraid to be different on camera. This is also evident in his scenes with Katharine Ross and many of the other great supporting cast members.\n\nNext: another Newman/Redford collaboration: 1973’s The Sting. In this one, I think the majority can agree with me that Redford dominates Newman as he had much more of an intense performance to deliver on screen. He certainly followed through with it, too! A film that deals pretty extensively with humorous relationships, Redford conveys many different emotions in this Academy Award winner for Best Picture. Often, he has to change his feelings quickly moment by moment, something that is very difficult to do (trust me…I’m an actor too)!\n\nWhat he does well here with the change of emotions is not get caught up in it. Redford is able to establish and maintain an excellent balance between the many different sides of character Johnny Hooker. Additionally, he interacts both seriously and humorously with many of the characters, again maintaining that great balance. I was impressed with his performance in many ways, but particularly his ability to interact with Charles Durning and especially Paul Newman. Here, Redford works harmoniously with Newman throughout, never failing to keep the audience interested in their developing relationship which Redford arguably dominates. That’s why he’s DEFINITELY better than Newman in this film!\n\nLast, but not least, my personal favorite: 1976’s All The President’s Men. I am going to say right now that, with this particular film, I find Redford’s work practically equal to Dustin Hoffman’s…give or take. Despite this, I still see great power in Redford’s portrayal of Bob Woodward, a character whose immense efforts in the Watergate Scandal through the eyes of the Washington Post drive him to craze at many points.\n\nIt is particularly refreshing to see that, after Butch Cassidy and The Sting, Redford still possessed great ability to command attention for his characters and their relationship with other great characters/actors. In this film, Redford and Hoffman are a true tag team at all times! They beautifully convey what it’s like to work closely with someone on a project that demands so much attention and energy.\n\nJust as he did in All Is Lost, Redford shows emotion to a T in All The President’s Men. His ability to change from moment to moment so beautifully and so intensely is part of what carries this film to the ranks as one of the best of all time. You truly see a great amount of suspense, emotion draining, and high energy in Redford’s portrayal of Woodward throughout. People should take note of how well Redford portrays the ever-changing attitudes of an average human being. It’s admirable because it is something that we all feel and many of the other greats have had to portray on screen as well.\n\nSo…\n\nAs I’m sure you can see, I really like Robert Redford! All the reasons I mentioned at the beginning and throughout this post show you why, but let me conclude with a few last notes.\n\nVersatility, power, and emotion may make Robert Redford a great actor, but to me, the fact that, today, he still has what he originally possessed at his height of fame in the 60’s and 70’s, is a hugely refreshing feeling. To see that he has never gotten caught up in fame (truth), that he still acts for the love of movies (assumedly), and because he has a great talent (evident) are just a few of the reasons why he is my one and only…. STAR OF THE MONTH!\n\nCongrats, Mr. Redford! I know I need to see more of your films as you are one of my faves! I hope you go on making many more wonderful films in years to come!"
