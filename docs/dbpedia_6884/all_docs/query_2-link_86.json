        "text": "President Barack Obama has named Robert Redford (A&S ex’58; HonDocHum’87) among this year’s Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients.\n\nCalled the nation’s highest civilian honor, the award recognizes individuals who have made “especially meritorious contributions” to the security or national interests of the U.S., world peace or other significant endeavors.\n\nOther 2016 medal winners include Ellen DeGeneres, Michael Jordan, Bill and Melinda Gates and Bruce Springsteen. A full list is available on the White House website.\n\nRedford attended CU Boulder for one year on a baseball scholarship. In 1955 the future film legend and two-time Academy Award winner also worked as a janitor at The Sink, where you’ll find his likeness on the wall. His commitment to the environment took hold during his time in Colorado, where he developed a love for geology and the mountains.\n\nIn addition to his work as an actor, producer and director, Redford, 80, is the founder of the Sundance Institute, which produces the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nTwo of Redford’s children, David Redford (Engl’85) and Shauna Redford Schlosser (Art’85) also attended CU.\n\nThe medals were presented at the White House on Nov. 22."
