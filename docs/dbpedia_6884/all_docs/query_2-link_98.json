        "text": "Fresh off announcing its Board of Governors 2024-2025 officers on August 1, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) has announced its newly elected 2024-2025 Academy Foundation Board members and officers.\n\nThough these are two different groups, one of the names present on both boards is Donna Gigliotti from the Academy’s Executives Branch, listed now as Treasurer of the Foundation, but she’s also the Vice President/Treasurer (chair, Finance Committee) of the AMPAS Board of Governors.\n\nOther familiar names on the Academy Foundation Board include Howard Berger from the Makeup Artists and Hairstylists Branch as President of the board, with Brooke Breton of the Visual Effects Branch and Kim Taylor-Coleman of the Casting Directors Branch both serving as Vice Presidents on the Academy Foundation Board.\n\nThe trio prior served as the elected officers for the Academy’s Museum Committee, Education and Outreach Committee, and History and Preservation Committee, respectively, but a recent change was made to move the oversight of those responsibilities to this Academy Foundation Board, which oversees the public charity work in which the Academy engages. This includes the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, the Academy’s Margaret Herrick Library, the Academy Film Archive, the Academy Collection, and the Academy’s talent development programs.\n\nLastly, Marlon West of the Animation Branch will serve as Secretary, completing the list of elected board officers for The Academy Foundation. Jason Reitman (Directors Branch), Stephen Rivkin (Film Editors Branch), Dana Stevens (Writers Branch), and Academy President Janet Yang (Producers Branch) will also serve as members of The Academy Board Foundation.\n\nAcademy Foundation Board members and officers serve one-year terms. As representatives of the Foundation Board, Berger, Gigliotti, and Yang also serve on the Academy Museum Board of Trustees for one-year terms separately.\n\nOverall, the Academy Foundation Board comprises nine trustees who are members of the Academy Board of Governors.\n\nIn response to the announcement, Academy CEO Bill Kramer said via a press statement, “The work of the Academy Foundation is a core part of the Academy’s vision to celebrate artistry and innovation in filmmaking, inspire new generations of artists, preserve and curate our global film history, and connect film fans from around the world.”\n\nHe added, “I am so grateful to our Academy governors who serve on the Academy Foundation Board. They tirelessly work to advance our vital foundation initiatives.”"
