He has also racked up some 50 producer credits over a wide range of film and TV projects.\n\nMorelia’s Artistic Excellence Award was presented for the first time last year to Oscar-winning Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron prior to the screening of his memoir film Roma. This year’s edition will open with the Cannes Palme d’Or winner Young Ahmed.\n\nOther festival highlights include the Latin America premieres of Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, and Waiting for the Barbarians, Colombian helmer Ciro Guerra’s latest work based on the novel by Nobel Prize-winning author J.M Coetzee and featuring Johnny Deep.\n\nWriter-director James Ivory, who won a best adapted screenplay Oscar at the age of 89 for Call Me by Your Name, is set to attend the event as a special guest."
