        "text": "Robert Redford will be the recipient of the Peter J. Owens Award at the 52nd San Francisco International Film Festival, taking place April 23 – May 7. The award, named after a San Francisco benefactor of arts and charitable organizations and Film Society board member, honors an actor whose “work exemplifies brilliance, independence and integrity.” The award will be presented to Redford at Film Society Awards Night on Thursday, April 30 at the Westin St. Francis Hotel.\n\nThe Youth Education Program, a function of the San Francisco Film Society which produces the annual festival, will be the beneficiary of the gala black-tie fundraiser honoring Redford and the soon-to-be announced recipients of the Founder’s Directing Award and the Kanbar Award for excellence in screenwriting.\n\nRedford will also be feted in a public onstage tribute at the Castro Theatre Wednesday, April 29 at 7:00 pm. The program will feature career retrospective film clips, audience Q&A and an onstage interview with Phil Bronstein, editor-at-large of the San Francisco Chronicle, followed by the world premiere screening of the restoration of one of Redford’s most beloved films, “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” (1969), directed by George Roy Hill.\n\n“We feel honored to be paying tribute to Robert Redford, a man who is in a class by himself, both on and off the screen,” commented Graham Leggat, executive director of the San Francisco Film Society in a statement. “His intelligence, skill and dedication as an actor have brought to life scores of unforgettable characters, while the same qualities in the service of politics, the arts and the environment have been an inspiration to millions.”"
