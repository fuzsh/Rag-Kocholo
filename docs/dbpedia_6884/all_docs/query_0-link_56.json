Frankly, I think it was that they had done things the same way for a long time… It isn’t healthy.”\n\nHe told The Telegraph: “I don’t think the people who do award shows realise how harmful this is.”\n\nBafta Best Film Award – all of the winners\n\nShow all 71\n\nThe Independent has contacted Bafta for comment.\n\nThe 2020 Baftas will take place on Sunday 2 February. The awards body has been the subject of much criticism this year after it failed to recognise a single non-white actor in its nominations, while giving Scarlett Johansson and Margot Robbie two nods each.\n\n#BaftasSoWhite trended on Twitter in the wake of the Bafta nominations announcement, with critics and audiences condemning it.\n\nEdelman is an American comic who has been working with Orange is the New Black creator Jenji Kohan on the forthcoming Netflix series Slutty Teenage Bounty Hunters.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
