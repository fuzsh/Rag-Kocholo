December 14, 2006 at Thousand Oaks 8:00 pm\n\nWed. December 13, 2006 at Pasadena 8:00 pm\n\nPlease hold on to your issued Robert Redford tickets; your current ticket will be honored on the rescheduled evenings.\n\nRedford is one of the most influential creative voices of our time -- as an actor, Academy Award-winning director, producer, film advocate, and environmental activist. His enduring contributions to film over four decades have earned him the SAG Lifetime Achievement award and international acclaim.\n\nHis passion is to make films of substance and social/cultural relevance, and to encourage others to express themselves through the arts. To this end, he founded The Sundance Institute, dedicated to the support and development of emerging screenwriters and directors of vision, and to the national and international exhibition of new independent cinema."
