        "text": "For me, Donald Sutherland will always be Lucien Wilbanks. Or maybe, of late, President Snow. But that’s the beauty of Sutherland, such a versatile actor who we regrettably lost last Thursday—he was many things to many people. Flooding comments on the Internet reminisce about his role as Calvin Jarrett in Robert Redford’s “Ordinary People.” This is touching, as the film is based on a book of the same name by Judith Guest that was one of my favorites from my childhood. One of my friends stated his desire to become a therapist from watching the film. If that’s not power, I don’t know what is. It’s a testament to Sutherland’s legacy that will last much longer than the sea of Internet tributes.\n\nSutherland passed away on June 22nd, 2024 after “a long illness,” as stated by Creative Artists Agency, which represented him. And a quick survey of his filmography highlights an astounding 200 film and TV roles, stretching through 2023. Additionally, a memoir, “Made Up, But Still True” is due out in November 2024 according to AP News.\n\nAn Iconic Career\n\nSome of his roles are iconic: the aforementioned Lucien Wilbanks in the John Grisham adaptation “A Time to Kill” or X in Oliver Stone’s “JFK.” Playing Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman’s “M*A*S*H”—which would become a TV phenomenon—was another. But so were more elusive examples, such as playing John Baxter in the ’70s psychological horror film “Don’t Look Now” or as Matthew Bennell in the 1978 cult classic “Invasion of the Body Snatchers.” Of course, his portrayal of the villainous President Snow throughout the “Hunger Games” trilogy added to his iconic catalogue.\n\nHowever, others were more unsung, playing both villainous and benevolent roles. His performance as Warden Drumgoogle in the Sylvester Stallone actioner “Lock Up” left a mark, as did smaller roles in the films “Fallen” and “Disclosure” (the former starring alongside Denzel Washington, the latter another bestselling book-turned-movie from Michael Crichton). To me, none were as doleful and perfect than his appearance in “Aurora Borealis,” however, playing against Joshua Jackson as an aging grandfather with dementia. It was a beautiful film that earned both Jackson and Sutherland acting Jury Awards at the Ft. Lauderdale International Film Festival.\n\nCommemorating a Legend\n\nTo commemorate the life and acting career of Donald Sutherland, we at The Movie Buff present six films that left an impact on us across the decades. If you agree or disagree with our list—or have one of your favorites to add—please do so in the comments. We’d love to hear from you.\n\n‘Don’t Look Now’ (1973) – John Baxter\n\n“Don’t Look Now” set the stage for horrific psychological thrillers to follow. In a decade that focused on possession, sharks and aliens, the film showed what the truest cinematic villain is: grief. Donald Sutherland’s understated yet powerful performance leads the way in this fantastic throwback to a bygone era in film.\n\n‘A Time to Kill’ (1996) – Lucien Wilbanks\n\nThe first time I saw Donald Sutherland was in 1996’s “A Time to Kill.” Having read the book, I was blown away by his performance as Lucien Wilbanks, the mentor of the lead character. Sutherland had no problems sharing the spotlight with other big stars including Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock, and Samuel L. Jackson. He did what many actors are unable to do—perfectly recreate a character from a book. And it was a treat to watch him share the screen with his son, Kiefer.\n\n‘Aurora Borealis’ (2005) – Ronald Shorter\n\n“Aurora Borealis” is indie in every sense of the word, and Donald Sutherland has never been sweeter than in the role of Ronald Shorter. He plays alongside Joshua Jackson, who plays his grandson, Duncan. Duncan is reeling from the premature death of his father ten years prior, and Ronald is suffering from dementia. Yet amidst it, Sutherland creates some of the most loving, believable scenes. He’s one part crochety, one part confused, and yet another part wise and accepting of life’s loving moments. It’s a shame he wasn’t recognized by wider award bodies; but after all, the film was small, with only a $60k gross. A true hidden gem.\n\n‘JFK’ (1991) – X\n\nThe assassination of JFK remains one of the most shocking moments in U.S. history. Leave it to Oliver Stone to figure out how to weave this tale of tragedy and travesty into a marathon film. With an all star cast and some of the best performances of the ’90s, Donald Sutherland stole the show and sent not only our lead character but an entire audience down a wonderfully wild rabbit hole of conspiracy theories. A must watch for any buffs of not only movies but history as well.\n\n‘Invasion of the Body Snathchers’ (1978) – Matthew Bennell\n\nThe 1978 version of “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” may be the only remake that’s better than the original, and Donald Sutherland is the reason. As health inspector Matthew Bennell, Sutherland is a perfect casting choice as an average man who gets sent to the center of extraordinary circumstances. The viewer can easily relate to and root for him throughout the film. Sutherland does ’70s horror well; and to this day has a notorious meme for the final scene.\n\n‘Ordinary People’ (1980) – Calvin Jarrett\n\nSutherland had a knack for taking roles and running with them, and Calvin Jarrett in Robert Redford’s “Ordinary People” is no exception. The character’s a thankless role, a passive husband and father sandwiched between a wife (Mary Tyler Moore) who cannot recover from tragedy, and a son (Timothy Hutton) who wants to. The role—from Judith Guest’s book—required patience and a lot of background acting, and Sutherland nailed the role. The closing scene is every bit as harrowing and bittersweet as in the novel, and Sutherland brings great nuance to it.\n\n*Movie selections and abstracts written and contributed by Mark Ziobro, Joe Hughes, and Matt DeCristo."
