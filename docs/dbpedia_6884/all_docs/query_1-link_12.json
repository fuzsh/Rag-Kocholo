        "text": "Robert Redford is one of those classic movie stars who disarmed you with his incredible looks, and then mesmerized you with his on-screen talent. He’s not an actor’s actor like Robert De Niro, but he’s shown for decades what type of performer he is. Redford’s charm and natural charisma have made him compelling in a wide variety of roles, and they’ve also occasionally been weaponized against his audience.\n\nNot every role in Redford’s decades-long career has been a roaring success. For every All the President’s Men there’s a stinker like Havana. In general, though, Redford has built a remarkable body of work, and if he never acts in front of a camera again, he can be proud of what he’s accomplished. Here at the best Robert Redford movies you need to watch.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe Sting (1973)\n\n83%\n\n8.3/10\n\npg\n\n129m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Crime, Drama\n\nStars\n\nPaul Newman, Robert Redford, Robert Shaw\n\nDirected by\n\nGeorge Roy Hill\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIn an era where many of the most legendary movies are dark or cynical, The Sting was a light, frothy alternative. The movie stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford as an aging thief and an aspiring con man, respectively, who decide to team up to avenge the death of a mutual friend. It’s a heist movie at its core, and The Sting executes its heist flawlessly. Thanks to deeply captivating performances from both Newman and Redford, The Sting holds up as a great piece of entertainment, even if it lacks some of the heavier themes that were typical of movies of its era.\n\nAll the President's Men (1976)\n\n84%\n\n7.9/10\n\npg\n\n138m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, History, Mystery, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nDustin Hoffman, Robert Redford, Martin Balsam\n\nDirected by\n\nAlan J. Pakula\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nAlthough it’s almost 50 years old now, All the President’s Men still stands as maybe the best film about journalism ever made. The film tells the mostly true story of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the reporters who inadvertently discovered the Watergate scandal that took down President Nixon. The film works because it lives in the shadows of a corrupt political universe. Nothing is exactly as it seems in All the President’s Men, and getting to the truth is much harder than it should be for two people investigating the most powerful man in the world.\n\nThe Old Man & the Gun (2018)\n\n80%\n\n6.7/10\n\npg-13\n\n94m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Crime, Drama\n\nStars\n\nRobert Redford, Sissy Spacek, Casey Affleck\n\nDirected by\n\nDavid Lowery\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThe Old Man and the Gun wasn’t technically Robert Redford’s last onscreen performance, but it was supposed to be. In the movie, Redford plays an aging thief who manages to escape from prison and goes on a tear, robbing places across the country. As he almost always is, Redford is charming in the role, and the film is as much about his commitment to thievery as art as it is about him reckoning with the life he’s chosen to lead. This is one of two collaborations with David Lowery on this list, and it’s clear from their work together that Lowery knows how to lean into Redford’s incredible charisma.\n\nAll Is Lost (2013)\n\n87%\n\n6.9/10\n\npg-13\n\n106m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Drama\n\nStars\n\nRobert Redford\n\nDirected by\n\nJ.C. Chandor\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nAll is Lost relies almost entirely on Redford’s ability to captivate an audience. The movie, which didn’t even earn him an Oscar nomination as it should have, follows Redford as an experienced mariner who finds himself sailing into a dangerous storm. Playing out largely in silence, All is Lost works only because Redford can sell every second of what his character is going through without verbalizing any of it. All is Lost is a movie about survival, and Redford’s performance sits at the center, proving that even after being a star for 40 years, he was still one of the best in the game.\n\nThree Days of the Condor (1975)\n\n63%\n\n7.4/10\n\n117m\n\nGenre\n\nThriller, Mystery\n\nStars\n\nRobert Redford, Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson\n\nDirected by\n\nSydney Pollack\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nOther than All the President’s Men, Three Days of the Condor may be Redford’s most iconic work from the 1970s. Redford plays an ordinary CIA code breaker in the film who goes out for lunch one day, only to return and discover that his entire office staff has been murdered. His discovery leads him to uncover a devious conspiracy that involves the CIA, and he’s forced to run for his life to avoid going the same way as the rest of his team. Redford co-stars with Faye Dunaway, and both actors deliver marvelous performances as two scared people fighting for the truth and their lives.\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)\n\n66%\n\n8/10\n\npg\n\n111m\n\nGenre\n\nWestern, Drama, Crime\n\nStars\n\nPaul Newman, Robert Redford, Katharine Ross\n\nDirected by\n\nGeorge Roy Hill\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a story about two rebels who never found their place in the world. As an early part of the wave of New Hollywood films, Butch Cassidy took a pair of real-life outlaws and turned them into romantic figures fighting against authority. Redford and Paul Newman are both thoroughly captivating in their roles, and the film takes plenty of time to sketch out the relationship between them. These two were friends, even if they spent much of their time thieving and evading the long arm of the law.\n\nJeremiah Johnson (1972)\n\n75%\n\n7.5/10\n\npg\n\n108m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Western, History\n\nStars\n\nRobert Redford, Will Geer, Delle Bolton\n\nDirected by\n\nSydney Pollack\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nSet in the 1830s, Jeremiah Johnson tells the story of a Mexican-American War veteran who decides to live a life of quiet isolation in the mountains. As time passes, he finds a mentor who teaches him how to live in the wilderness and he eventually winds up with a family as well. The movie is thrilling, in part because Jeremiah finds himself coming face to face with a hostile Native American tribe. More than that, though, Jeremiah Johnson is about a man who’s trying to escape from his past and finding that escape more difficult than he imagined it to be.\n\nThe Natural (1984)\n\n61%\n\n7.4/10\n\n137m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nStars\n\nRobert Redford, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close\n\nDirected by\n\nBarry Levinson\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThe Natural is a pretty hokey, but not in a bad way. The movie follows an aging baseball player of incredible skill who didn’t get a chance to play in the majors because he was violently attacked at a young age. As he approaches the end of his career, he finally gets his shot at the big show and is forced to confront the money and politics that govern the game at that level. The Natural is one of Redford’s most earnest performances. He’s playing a man in love with a game who’s trying to save that game from the business that it has transformed into.\n\nSneakers (1992)\n\n126m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Crime, Drama\n\nStars\n\nRobert Redford, Sidney Poitier, David Strathairn\n\nDirected by\n\nPhil Alden Robinson\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIn Sneakers, Robert Redford plays Martin Bishop, a reformed computer hacker who leads a team of security specialists. These specialists, with unique skill sets, are hired to test the security systems of various companies. The movie takes a turn when Martin is approached by shady government agents who blackmail him and his team into stealing a mysterious device called a “black box.” This device is a powerful code breaker that can crack any encryption, posing a significant threat if it falls into the wrong hands. As Martin and his team delve deeper into the mission, they discover the government agents are rogue and the true purpose of the black box is far more sinister. The film follows Martin and his team as they try to stop the black box from falling into the wrong hands, all while navigating their pasts and the complexities of their unique team dynamic.\n\nMovie images and data from:\n\nJoe Allen is a freelance culture writer based in upstate New York.
