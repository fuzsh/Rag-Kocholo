        "text": "Brad Pitt Movies\n\nActor and producer Brad Pitt has been nominated for multiple awards, headlined major films for over three decades, and worked with acknowledged masters both as a movie star and the head of his company, Plan B Entertainment. Brad Pitt movies have result in Academy Award nominations three times for his acting—“12 Monkeys,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” and “Moneyball”—and three times for producing—“Moneyball,” “12 Years a Slave,” and “The Big Short”—and he shared in the Best Picture win for Steve McQueen’s “12 Years a Slave.” Brad Pitt has also been nominated for five BAFTA Awards, eight Golden Globes, and three Emmys, along with major nominations and wins from every guild and critics groups in the country.\n\nBecoming a household name in the ‘90s, Brad Pitt also pushed the profit margins of tabloids with his marriages to A-list stars. For a few years, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston were the hottest couple in Hollywood, and then it happened again with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston were married from 2000 to 2005. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were marreid from 2014 to 2019.\n\nHe has worked with David Fincher, Terry Gilliam, Terrence Malick, Quentin Tarantino, James Gray, Robert Zemeckis, Steven Soderbergh, Joel Coen & Ethan Coen, Ridley Scott, Robert Redford, and many more, often collaborating with some of his best directors more than once.\n\nBrad Pitt's Family\n\nBrad Pitt—who actually took his middle name as an actor as his given name was William Bradley Pitt—was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma on December 18, 1963, but the family quickly relocated to Springfield, Missouri, where he spent most of his childhood. Active in theater and sports through his youth, he almost switched gears when he majored in journalism at the University of Missouri, but he fell just short of graduating and moved to Los Angeles when he was in his early 20s. Brad Pitt's height worked to his advantage from a young age, as the actor stands 5' 11\".\n\nBrad Pitt Movies - Seven\n\nBrad Pitt Movies of the early-1990s\n\nA series of uncredited and cameo work for young Brad Pitt followed in everything from “Less Than Zero” to “Growing Pains.” TV guest appearances on shows like “Dallas” and “21 Jump Street” helped lead to his first major TV movie part in an NBC flick called “Too Young to Die?,” co-starring Juliette Lewis, with whom Brad Pitt would reunite in 1993’s “Kalifornia.”\n\nThe true breakthrough for Brad Pitt came in Ridley Scott’s Oscar-winning “Thelma & Louise” in 1991. In a small role—as an object of affection for Geena Davis’ Thelma—he made a big impact. Pitt was on the map and didn’t really look back. His first major lead role came just a year later in Robert Redford’s “A River Runs Through It,” still one of his most beloved performances. He would play against the movie star image he was already developing with gritty turns in “True Romance” and “Kalifornia.”\n\nBrad Pitt Movies of the mid-1990s\n\nThe mid to late ‘90s were a pivotal time in Brad Pitt’s career, launched into blockbuster films like Neil Jordan’s adaptation of Anne Rice’s “Interview with the Vampire” with Tom Cruise, “Legends of the Fall” with Anthony Hopkins, and “Seven” with Morgan Freeman. David Fincher’s 1995 thriller remains a highlight of Pitt’s career, and it’s remarkable that it was released the same year as Terry Gilliam’s “12 Monkeys,” which earned Pitt his first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor (he won the equivalent Golden Globe for the performance). 1995 also happens to be the year that Brad Pitt was named People’s Sexiest Man Alive (which he would win again in 2000).\n\n1996’s “Sleepers” was a reasonable hit, but a string of disappointments would follow, including “The Devil’s Own,” “Seven Years in Tibet,” and “Meet Joe Black,” about which Roger Ebert said, “Pitt is a fine actor, but this performance is a miscalculation.” In his late 30s, Pitt alternated critical and commercial darlings like David Fincher’s “Fight Club” and Steven Soderbergh’s “Ocean’s Eleven” with less beloved films (yet still profitable) like “The Mexican” and “Spy Game.” The image of Brad Pitt in \"Fight Club\" is one of the most iconic of his career.\n\nBrad Pitt Movies - Mr. & Mrs. Smith\n\nBrad Pitt Movies of the 2000s\n\nDuring this time, Brad Pitt had a few high-profile relationships, including an engagement to his “Seven” co-star Gwyneth Paltrow, but it was when Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston wed in 2000 that landed the most headlines. For much of his life, he has been a staple of celebrity news and gossip sites.\n\nIn 2001, Brad Pitt co-founded Plan B Entertainment with Brad Grey and then-wife Jennifer Aniston, changing the definition of what the phrase \"Brad Pitt movies\" means. Their first production was, naturally, a Brad Pitt movies, 2004’s “Troy.” In the years since, Plan B has had a remarkable run of high-profile and award-nominated films, including Best Picture nominees “The Departed,” “The Tree of Life,” “Moneyball,” “12 Years a Slave,” “Selma,” “The Big Short,” “Moonlight,” and “Vice.”\n\nA turning point for Brad Pitt came in 2005 when he co-starred with Angelina Jolie in Doug Liman’s “Mr. & Mrs. Smith”. That same year, he divorced Aniston, and would later end up marrying Jolie, although the three have said that Pitt and Aniston didn’t have a contentious split. Jolie and Pitt have revealed that they did fall in love on the set of the Liman film, but that they didn’t start dating until the divorce was final. Either way, the controversy made it one of the biggest Brad Pitt films.\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie became the hottest Hollywood couple of their era, dubbed “Brangelina” by the press, but Brad Pitt's children earned them a lot of headlines too. While Jolie had their first child together in 2006, they weren’t married until 2014, divorced only two years later in 2016 - Brad Pitt's divorce made headlines around the world. Over the course of their union, they adopted or had six children. Brad Pitt's children are named Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, and twins Knox and Vivienne. Brad Pitt's kids became a major part of the story around him, especially after Brad Pitt's divorce.\n\nCareer highlights of the ‘00s for Brad Pitt included Best Picture nominee “Babel,” two sequels to “Ocean’s,” critical darling “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,” the Coens’ Brad Pblack comedy “Burn After Reading,” Quentin Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds,” and the film that would land him his second Oscar nomination, David Fincher’s “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.”\n\nBrad Pitt Movies - Ad Astra\n\nBrad Pitt Movies of the 2010s\n\nHis remarkable career-long streak of quality work continued into the ‘10s in films like “The Tree of Life,” “Moneyball,” “Fury,” “By the Sea,” “The Big Short,” “Allied,” and, in 2019, James Gray's \"Ad Astra\" and Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” which earned Brad Pitt some of the best reviews of his career. It's arguable that no other actor of Brad Pitt's age ended the decade as critically acclaimed.\n\nActor and producer Brad Pitt also has a deep philanthropic resume, campaigning for a proposal in California that would fund stem-cell research, supporting a campaign to fight AIDS and poverty around the world, donating money to help rebuild Chad and Sudan, financing the rebuilding of homes after Hurricane Katrina, and much more through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, which was founded in 2006. As of 2019, Brad Pitt's net worth is estimated at $300 million.\n\nThe Most Critically-Acclaimed Brad Pitt Movies as an Actor\n\n\"12 Years a Slave\"\n\n\"Moneyball\"\n\n\"True Romance\"\n\n\"Inglourious Basterds\"\n\n\"12 Monkeys\"\n\n\"The Big Short\"\n\n\"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\"\n\n\"Ad Astra\"\n\n\"The Tree of Life\"\n\nThe Most Critically-Acclaimed Brad Pitt Movies as a Producer Only\n\n\"Selma\"\n\n\"Moonlight\"\n\n\"If Beale Street Could Talk\"\n\n\"The Normal Heart\"\n\n\"The Departed\"\n\n\"The Lost City of Z\"\n\nOscar Nominations and Wins for Brad Pitt Movies\n\n1996 - \"12 Monkeys\" (Nominee)\n\n2009 - \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" (Nominee)\n\n2012 - \"Moneyball\" (Nominee for Acting and Producing)\n\n2014 - \"12 Years a Slave\" (Winner for Producing)\n\n2016 - \"The Big Short\" (Nominee for Producing)\n\nClips From Brad Pitt Films\n\nBrad Pitt in Fury\n\nBrad Pitt in Legends of the Fall\n\nBrad Pitt in Deadpool 2\n\nBrad Pitt in Troy\n\nMore Links About Brad Pitt Films\n\nBrad Pitt Filmography\n\nBrad Pitt News\n\nBrad Pitt Interview with Anthony Hopkins\n\nBrad Pitt Interview with The New York Times\n\nBrad Pitt Movies on Netflix\n\nBrad Pitt Filmography\n\nFind on IMDB"
