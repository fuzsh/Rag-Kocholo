        "text": "I can’t think of a time in my life when they weren’t being broadcast. And the occasional repeats I saw as a kid proved that they existed long before I did. Reruns of “You Bet Your Life” and “To Tell the Truth” aired alongside first-run episodes of “Match Game” and Dick Clark’s “Pyramid” series (my two favorite game shows of all time).\n\nMovies tied me to a particular game show as a kid, “The Joker’s Wild.” It was one of the few shows I remember that posed questions about film. Contestants spun a big slot machine and hoped to land on three jokers. My cousins and I would mimic host Jack Barry yelling out “Joker!” whenever one appeared on screen.\n\nBoy, did my aunt hate this show! She would grumble whenever we watched it, and not just because of a house full of kids yelling “JOKER!” at the top of our damn lungs. She reserved her venom for Jack Barry himself, whom she compared (with the colorful language my family is known for) to the devil that showed up in one of those fake slot-machine windows whenever a contestant got too greedy and spun one time too many.\n\nI never asked my auntie why she hated “The Joker’s Wild.” I mean, adults were always complaining about something when you were a kid. But memories of her chiding us for watching became lodged in some obscure corner of my brain, and remained dormant until 1994.\n\nThat was when I saw Robert Redford’s Oscar-nominated drama, “Quiz Show.”\n\nWritten by former Washington Post film critic, Paul Attanasio, and directed by Redford, the film details the notorious “Twenty-One” game-show scandal. The cast includes Ralph Fiennes, John Turturro, Paul Scofield, and Rob Morrow, who play the real-life individuals involved. In a small but memorable part, Redford cast the guy he once beat for the best director Oscar, Martin Scorsese.\n\nNow, I don’t remember why I went to see this movie. At 24, I knew nothing about “Twenty-One.” Plus, I had no hopes for the film because it was from Hollywood Pictures. That subsidiary of Disney, with its crappy-looking sphinx logo, had a reputation for consistently putting out terrible movies. There was an old saying that went “if it’s the sphinx, it stinks.”\n\nThat’s the studio that gave us “Swing Kids,” one of the worst films ever made, in 1993. (Look up the plot, folks, then pick up your jaw.) It issued a rewritten take on “The Scarlett Letter” starring Demi Moore (the A stood for “atrocious”), and released more than one Pauly Shore movie. The 1993 “Super Mario Bros.” movie was also a Hollywood Picture.\n\nEven Sidney Lumet, a legend among directors, couldn’t make a good movie for that sphinx! (See 1992’s “A Stranger Among Us.”) So how was Robert Redford going to shake the curse?\n\nDespite my misgivings, I went to see “Quiz Show” anyway. I was rewarded with one of the best films of 1994 — number four on my top-10 list that year. It’s a movie about the manipulative power of the media, and how dangerous and cynical it can be.\n\nIt also has the quintessential Hell’s Kitchen native, Mr. Scorsese, starting some interborough beef by stating “Queens is not New York!” He plays the president of Geritol, the sponsor of “Twenty-One,” a game show hosted by my auntie’s nemesis, Jack Barry (played here by Christopher McDonald).\n\n(By the way, what the hell is Geritol? And am I now finally old enough to take it?)\n\n“Twenty-One” was a massive ratings hit in the early days of television, and its sponsor, the network (NBC), and its producers were willing to do anything to keep viewers riveted. That included replacing reigning champion Herbie Stempel (Turturro), a nerdy Jewish guy from Queens, with WASP-y nepo-baby pretty boy Charles Van Doren (Fiennes), the son of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Mark Van Doren (Scofield).\n\nVan Doren’s looks (and his ethnicity) guaranteed higher ratings. Replace an awkward brainiac with a sexier version, and the girls screaming for Elvis would scream for him, too.\n\nBut in order to do that, producers Dan Enright (David Paymer) and Al Freedman (a surprisingly oily Hank Azaria) have to get rid of Stempel. They demand that he take a dive when he faces Van Doren.\n\nTaking a dive is bad enough, but their request involves him getting wrong a question everyone and their mother knew the answer to back in 1956: “What was the best picture of 1955?” The answer is “Marty.” They want him to say “On the Waterfront,” the best picture of 1954.\n\nAgainst his wishes, Stempel takes the dive. Van Doren becomes an even bigger winner on the show. It helps that he’s being given the questions and answers beforehand. That’s where the scandal comes in, and with it Rob Morrow’s Dick Goodwin.\n\nGoodwin is the guy whose 1988 book, “Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties,” was the source material for “Quiz Show.” If you were wondering why I didn’t contribute to our recent segment on best and worst Boston accents, I was saving my answer for this article.\n\nMorrow would be my pick for one of the worst Boston accents I’ve ever heard. (His character says he’s from Brookline, to be fair.) He still turns in a very good performance (as does everyone else, especially Turturro), but I can’t help but laugh whenever I hear him. Scorsese and Morrow have a great scene that pairs an authentic Noo Yawk honk with a mediocre JFK impression.\n\nRegardless, “Quiz Show” is an excellent cautionary tale that remains timely 30 years later. It angrily points out that corrupt big media corporations and sponsors rarely receive a scintilla of the blame and punishment they deserve for the schemes they endorse. It also showcases the distrust that comes from misleading the general public — making angry viewers out of people like my aunt.\n\nBut if you think the American people learned any valuable lessons about accepting as truth whatever they saw on a television game show, I’ve got two words to disabuse you of that notion: “The Apprentice.”\n\nOdie Henderson is the Boston Globe's film critic."
