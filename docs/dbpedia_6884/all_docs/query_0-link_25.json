        "text": "Andrew Garfield is a 2-time Academy Award® nominee, Emmy Award® nominee, Golden Globe Award winning and Tony Award® winning actor whose transformative performances across major studio films, independent features, and onstage have captivated global audiences for over a decade—with a body of work that continues to evolve with each new role and powerful new narrative. Garfield recently wrapped production on A24’s and StudioCanal’s WE LIVE IN TIME opposite Florence Pugh. Irish filmmaker John Crowley is directing the feature from a script penned by Nick Payne. The film is slated to be released in 2024. Garfield was last seen in the FX series, UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN, based on the critically acclaimed Jon Krakauer novel of the same name, and adapted by Oscar-winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black. The series follows a Mormon police detective who is shaken when an investigation into the murder of a woman seems to be connected to the Church. Garfield stars opposite Daisy Edgar Jones and landed his first Emmy nomination for his role as Jeb Pyre. In 2021, he starred in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s TICK, TICK,… BOOM!, a movie musical adaption of the autobiographical Off-Broadway show written by Rent composer Jonathan Larson. The film follows Jon, a young theater composer who’s waiting tables at a New York City diner in 1990 while writing what he hopes will be the next great American musical. For his work in the film, Garfield won the Golden Globe Award for ‘Best Actor’ and was nominated for an Academy Award, a Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild Awards, among other countless honors. The film was widely praised and named to AFI’s Top 10 Films of 2021. At the end of 2021, he reprised his role as Peter Parker alongside Tom Holland & Tobey Maguire in SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME, which quickly became one of the highest-grossing films of all-time. Released on December 17, 2021, the film has grossed over 1.7 billion dollars worldwide and counting. Earlier that year, he starred alongside Oscar Winner Jessica Chastain in Searchlight’s THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE, based on the documentary of the same name, which chronicles the rise and fall of real-life televangelists Tammy Faye Bakker and her husband Jim. The film, directed by Michael Showalter, was released on September 17, 2021. In 2018 Garfield starred in the Broadway revival of Tony Kushner’s Pulitzer-Prize winning ANGELS IN AMERICA, directed by Tony Award®-winner Marianne Elliott. The play had its successful first run at the National Theatre in London and transferred to Broadway beginning February 22, 2019. He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of “Prior Walter” alongside castmates Denise Gough, Nathan Lane, and James McArdle. For his performance, he received a Tony Award® for Best Lead Actor in a Play, a 2018 Olivier Award nomination for Best Actor, a Drama League nomination for the Distinguished Performance Award and a Drama Desk nomination for Outstanding Actor in a play. In 2016, Garfield appeared on the big screen in Mel Gibson’s Academy Award®-nominated World War II epic, HACKSAW RIDGE. Based on a true story, Garfield played Army medic Desmond T. Doss, who was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Truman for saving the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under enemy fire during the Battle of Okinawa. The film co-starred Vince Vaughn, Hugo Weaving, Brenda Griffiths and Teresa Palmer and was released by Lionsgate on November 4th, 2016. Garfield’s critically acclaimed performance earned him lead actor nominations at the Academy Awards®, Golden Globe Awards®, Screen Actors Guild Awards and BAFTA Awards. Additional film credits include: Gia Coppola’s MAINSTREAM; David Robert Mitchell’s noir-thriller UNDER THE SILVER LAKE; Andy Serkis’ drama BREATHE; Martin Scorcese’s SILENCE opposite Adam Driver; Ramin Bahrani’s 99 HOMES opposite Michael Shannon and Laura Dern; Marc Webb’s THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN and THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2, which combined grossed over 1.5 billion at the box-office; David Fincher’s THE SOCIAL NETWORK, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe® for Best Supporting Actor; Mark Romanek’s NEVER LET ME GO opposite Keira Knightley and Carey Mulligan; Spike Jonze’s robot love story I’M HERE; Terry Gilliam’s THE IMAGINARIUM OF DR. PARNASSUS; Julian Jarrold’s RED RIDING TRILOGY - 1974; Robert Redford’s LIONS FOR LAMBS; and John Crowley’s BOY A, for which he earned BAFTA’s Best Actor Award in 2008.
