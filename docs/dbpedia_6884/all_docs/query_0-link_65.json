She is the sole artist thus far to have received an\n\nAcademy Award for both acting and screenwriting.\n\nThompson commented: “I am so\n\ndelighted to be receiving The Richard Harris Award at this year’s MBIFAs. It is\n\na very special award, in name of an incredible actor who inspired so many\n\npeople during his career. I am honoured to follow in the footsteps of my peers\n\nwho have received this award before me, and look forward to celebrating a\n\nfantastic year of British independent filmmaking on 7th December.”\n\nIn 1992, Thompson caused a\n\nsensation with her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel in the Merchant Ivory\n\nadaptation of E.M. Forster’s HOWARDS\n\nEND. Sweeping the Best Actress category wherever it was\n\nconsidered, the performance netted her a BAFTA Award, Los Angeles Film Critics\n\nAward, New York Film Critics Award, Golden Globe and Academy Award. She\n\nearned two Oscar nominations the following year for her work in The REMAINS OF THE DAY and IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER.\n\nIn 1995, Thompson’s adaptation of\n\nJane Austen’s SENSE AND SENSIBILITY,\n\ndirected by Ang Lee, won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay as well\n\nas the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay and Best Screenplay awards from the\n\nWriters Guild of America among others. For her performance in the film she\n\nwas honored with a Best Actress award from BAFTA and nominated for a Golden\n\nGlobe and an Academy Award. Her performance\n\nin Richard Curtis’ LOVE ACTUALLY earned Thompson Best Actress in a\n\nSupporting Role at the 2004 Evening Standard Film Awards, London Film Critics\n\nCircle Awards and Empire Film Awards, along with a BAFTA nomination. In 2013, Thompson’s moving portrayal of\n\nauthor ‘P.L. Travers’ in SAVING MR. BANKS earned her both the National Board of\n\nReview and Empire Best Actress Awards, along with Golden Globe, Broadcast Film\n\nCritics, SAG and BAFTA nominations.\n\nThompson\n\ncompleted filming this summer in Scotland on THE LONG MIDNIGHT OF BARNEY\n\nTHOMSON opposite Robert Carlyle and Ray Winstone, and on director Ken Kwapis’ A\n\nWALK IN THE WOODS, opposite Robert Redford and Nick Nolte. She is also part of\n\nJason Reitman’s MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN as well as the upcoming ADAM JONES, starring\n\nBradley Cooper.\n\nIn March of this year, to the\n\ndelight of both critics and audiences, she portrayed ‘Mrs. Lovett’ in the New\n\nYork Philharmonic’s staged production of Stephen Sondheim’s SWEENEY TODD: THE\n\nDEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET, opposite\n\nbass-baritone Bryn Terfel, in the title role. She and Terfel will reprise their\n\nroles, in a limited run at the London Coliseum with the English National Opera,\n\nfor the ENO’s first ever season of musical theater, in March of 2015.\n\nThompson’s feature film debut\n\ncame in 1988, starring opposite Jeff Goldblum in the comedy THE TALL GUY.

Thompson created the character for the screen\n\noriginally in 2004, in her own adaptation of NANNY MCPHEE, DIRECTED by Kirk Jones. In 2004, she brought to\n\nthe screen JK Rowling’s character of Sybil Trelawney in HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, for director Alfonso Cuaron, and in 2007, she reprised\n\nthe role in HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER\n\nOF THE PHOENIX, for director David Yates.\n\nAs previously announced, Benedict Cumberbatch\n\nwill receive The Variety Award at this year’s MBIFAs.\n\nThis year’s nominations were announced on 3rd\n\nNovember at St Martins Lane, London.
