But you know how it is when somebody says to you, if you, about a year before, they say: You know, if anybody'd told you a year ago that you would have been \"dot, dot, dot.\" Well, I just didn't think I was gonna see this. But I'm no less grateful. And I would like to express my debt for the directors that I worked with in the past, for what I've learned from them, consciously or unconsciously. And I would also like to say that, it may not be too fashionable but the fact is that I really do appreciate the support of Paramount Pictures, Charlie Bluhdorn, Barry Diller. They let us make the film the way we wanted to and I'm very grateful for that.\n\nThere are a lot of people that I can thank, and I don't want to go on too long, but I couldn't go too much further without expressing what for me is the greatest gratitude. And that keys around the word trust. I really am grateful for the trust that I received from a terrific cast: Mary, Donald, Tim, Judd, Liz. I love them, and I appreciate their love, too. So thank you all."
