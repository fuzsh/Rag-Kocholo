        "text": "Robert Redford will present Barbra Streisand with the 2015 Sherry Lansing Leadership Award at The Hollywood Reporter‘s 2015 Women in Entertainment breakfast taking place on Dec. 9 at Milk Studios in Los Angeles.\n\nThe star-studded event coincides with the publication of THR‘s annual Women in Entertainment Power 100 list.\n\nIt was previously announced that Melinda Gates will deliver the keynote address at the breakfast.\n\nRedford honoring Streisand will serve as a reunion for the two stars, who appeared together in the 1973 classic The Way We Were, directed by Sydney Pollack.\n\nBarbra Streisand Goes Platinum for Historic 31st Time\n\n“When Robert Redford and Barbra Streisand appeared together on the big screen four decades ago, the world witnessed a moment that was larger than life,” said Janice Min, co-president and chief creative officer of Guggenheim Media’s Entertainment Group. “Now, as we honor a career characterized by boundless talent, brilliant risk-taking, and unstinting generosity, there could be no better person to present Barbra Streisand with the 2015 Sherry Lansing Leadership Award than Robert Redford, an actor who is the embodiment artistic dedication and cinematic achievement.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nRedford is an Oscar winner and the creative force behind the Sundance Film Festival. His credits include Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting, The Great Gatsby, All The President’s Men, Ordinary People, The Natural, Out Of Africa, A River Runs Through It, Indecent Proposal, Quiz Show and All Is Lost. He can currently be seen as Dan Rather in Sony Pictures Classics’ Truth, which explores the former CBS News anchor and producer Mary Mapes’ (Cate Blanchett) controversial 60 Minutes report about George W. Bush. He recently wrapped Disney’s Pete’s Dragon, directed by David Lowery, co-starring Bryce Dallas Howard, which is set to hit theaters next year.\n\nRedford has received the Screen Actors Guild’s lifetime achievement award, an honorary Academy Award, the Kennedy Center Honors and the Legion d’Honneur medal, France’s highest recognition.\n\nThe Sherry Lansing Leadership Award recognizes women who serve as pioneers in the world of entertainment. Streisand — a multi-platinum selling artist, who has won 10 Grammys, two Oscars and AFI’s Lifetime Achievement Award — joins an esteemed list of former recipients including last year’s honoree, Shonda Rhimes, and previous honorees Oprah Winfrey, Meryl Streep, Diane Keaton and Jodie Foster. In addition to her prolific music and film career, Streisand is also a philanthropist and activist who launched The Streisand Foundation in 1986 to spotlight women’s equality and human rights and has made charitable contributions to help fight women’s heart disease.\n\nThe event, this year in its 24th outing, also highlights The Hollywood Reporter‘s Women in Entertainment Mentorship Program, where industry women, from Universal’s Donna Langley to Fox’s Dana Walden, have been paired with girls from Big Brothers Big Sisters of L.A. for a year. At the breakfast, two of the girls will be presented with full-ride scholarships to Loyola Marymount University. THR has helped raise more than $2 million in scholarships for graduates of the program.\n\nLast year, Angelina Jolie, Shonda Rhimes, Sarah Silverman, Melissa Rivers, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Dana Walden, Tony Goldwyn, Donna Langley and Bonnie Hammer were among the entertainment industry luminaries in attendance at the star-studded breakfast.\n\nThe annual event is sponsored by Lifetime, Mercedes, American Airlines, South Coast Plaza and Loyola Marymount University."
