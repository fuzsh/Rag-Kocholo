        "text": "(born 1936). American motion picture actor and director Robert Redford was known onscreen for his boyish good looks and his diversity of roles. For his work behind the movie scenes, he won an Academy Award for best director for the film Ordinary People (1980). As a patron of the arts, Redford founded the Sundance Institute and Film Festival in Utah.\n\nCharles Robert Redford, Jr., was born on August 18, 1936, in Santa Monica, California. After years of drifting and studying art in both Europe and the United States, he enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Soon thereafter he made his Broadway debut in the play Tall Story (1959). In the early 1960s Redford landed roles in several television dramas, including Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Twilight Zone, and Route 66. His biggest triumph of his early career, however, came with the lead role in Neil Simon’s Broadway hit Barefoot in the Park (1963).\n\nRedford appeared in mostly forgettable films throughout the mid-1960s. The cult favorite The Chase (1966) and the screen adaptation of Barefoot in the Park (1967) were notable exceptions. However, the turning point in his career came when he costarred with Paul Newman in the popular comic western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), in which he portrayed the outlaw Sundance Kid. The film became the top-grossing picture of the year, and Redford was soon one of Hollywood’s most popular stars. He next appeared in such successful films as Downhill Racer (1969) and The Candidate (1972). In 1973 he starred with Barbra Streisand in The Way We Were and reteamed with Newman in The Sting. They were the two most successful films of that year. The Sting won an Academy Award for best picture and earned Redford his only Oscar nomination for acting.\n\nOther memorable films Redford starred in during the 1970s included The Great Gatsby (1974), The Great Waldo Pepper (1975), Three Days of the Condor (1975), and All the President’s Men (1976). All the President’s Men was an account of the downfall of the administration of U.S. President Richard Nixon, starring Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein (see Watergate scandal). The film earned Oscar nominations in eight categories and firmly established Redford’s star status.\n\nIn the 1980s Redford starred in The Natural (1984), an adaptation of the Bernard Malamud novel about mythical baseball hero Roy Hobbs. The film earned four Oscar nominations. Out of Africa (1985), in which he appeared opposite Meryl Streep, won 7 of the 11 Oscars for which it was nominated. Redford’s next films included Sneakers (1992), The Horse Whisperer (1998), Spy Game (2001), The Clearing (2004), and Lions for Lambs (2007).\n\nIn 2013 Redford portrayed a sailor whose yacht is struck by a shipping container in All Is Lost. The tense survival drama featured little dialogue, and Redford was the only actor in the movie. He then appeared in the action film Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and the buddy comedy A Walk in the Woods (2015). Redford portrayed CBS reporter Dan Rather in the newsroom drama Truth (2015). The film covered the backlash from a story about U.S. President George W. Bush’s military service. Redford then starred in a remake of the family film Pete’s Dragon (2016). In 2017 he played a widower who is befriended by his longtime neighbor (played by Jane Fonda) in the Netflix movie Our Souls at Night. The next year Redford portrayed a bank robber with charming manners in The Old Man & the Gun.\n\nRedford launched his directing career with the family drama Ordinary People. The film won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Redford won an Oscar for best director. Of Redford’s first seven directorial efforts, The Milagro Beanfield War (1988), The Horse Whisperer, The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000), and Lions for Lambs earned lukewarm reviews. However, Ordinary People, A River Runs Through It (1992), and Quiz Show (1994) are regarded as minor masterpieces. Quiz Show dramatized a 1950s quiz-show scandal. It earned four Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director. Redford subsequently directed The Conspirator (2010), about the trial of Mary Surratt. Redford also directed The Company You Keep (2012), in which he starred as a family man running from his radical activist past.\n\nIn 1980 Redford established the Sundance Institute, which provides a workshop for young filmmakers each summer. It also sponsors the annual Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. By the 1990s the festival had become one of the leading international film festivals, and it is regarded as a vital showcase for new talent. For his work with Sundance and other contributions to film, Redford was presented with an honorary Academy Award in 2002. His numerous other awards include the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize (2008) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2016)."
