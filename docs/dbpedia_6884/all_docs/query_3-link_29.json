        "text": "In 2018, it was reported that Robert Redford would be making his acting swan song with David Lowery’s crime caper The Old Man and the Gun. As the film received its festival debut, those retirement statements were backtracked, but audiences were still given a thoughtful and surprising fable about a real “Redford type” of character and a convincing love story with Sissy Spacek. Reviews were largely positive but muted, and with the film’s early season release and the dismissal of Redford’s earlier claims that this would be his last performance, the film remained an awards season trifle with a few devoted fans but no Oscar love.\n\nThis episode, we talk about Lowery’s varied and interesting directorial career thus far and Redford’s surprisingly spare history of awards traction for his performances. We also look back at the 1980 Academy Awards when Redford and Spacek won their Oscars, the lingering distaste among film lovers for Ordinary People beating out Raging Bull, and a post-Globe win and SAG nomination state of the current race.\n\nTopics also include Spacek’s Oscar dominance in the 1980s, Elisabeth Moss joining our Six Timers Club, and the National Board of Review’s Top Independent Films of 2018.\n\nFollow Us on Twitter!\n\n@Had_Oscar_Buzz\n\nJoe: @joereid\n\nChris: @chrisvfeil\n\nNot only are we Oscar historians here on This Had Oscar Buzz, we are also the Illuminati of Vanderbilts. This week, we look at the directorial debut of Zodiac screenwriter James Vanderbilt Truth. Detailing 60 Minutes’ expose on President George W. Bush’s military service that ended in Dan Rather’s demise, the film starred Cate Blanchett as producer Mary Mapes and Robert Redford as Rather and died a quick death at the box office despite being a great on-paper Oscar prospect.\n\nAlso the film’s best chance at Oscar was overshadowed by herself – Blanchett (though great in Truth) also had a little movie that year called Carol that she ultimately was nominated for and earned even higher praise. But perhaps Truth was also compared against Spotlight, another true journalism story and the eventual Best Picture winner.\n\nThis week, we discuss the 2015 Oscar race at large, Redford’s late-career Oscar close calls, and how Zodiac was underappreciated in its initial release.

Least trumpeted of all was An Unfinished Life, starring Robert Redford, Jennifer Lopez, and Morgan Freeman.\n\nHere we have a film to fill your This Had Oscar Buzz bingo card: Lasse Hallström. An adaptation of a book about a grieving family. Scar makeup of debatable quality. A bear shows up. And of course, the oh-so-trustworthy source of test screening reactions from online message boards building up our hopes of a Camryn Manheim nomination.\n\nWhat makes a life “unfinished”? As we discuss this week, it might just be having a name like Griff, living in the generalized American west, and (our favorite) winning an award we have never heard of before!\n\nFollow Us on Twitter!\n\n@Had_Oscar_Buzz\n\nJoe: @joereid\n\nChris: @chrisvfeil\n\nIn 2007, the movies went hard on the War in Iraq. But what happened when that righteous roar, bolstered by some of the biggest names in Oscar and cinema history, gave the weakest bleat in the barnyard?\n\nThis week we are looking at Lions for Lambs, one of several politically motivated films of its year and the one that thudded the loudest. With Robert Redford directing and starring alongside Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise, our immediately assembled Oscar expectations were dismantled even faster once its empty talking head preachiness hit movie screens. Topic also include: a pre-Social Network Andrew Garfield, the thwarted hopes of resurrecting a flailing United Artists, and the joy of a perfect Kevin Dunn line reading.\n\nFollow Us on Twitter!\n\n@Had_Oscar_Buzz\n\nJoe: @joereid\n\nChris: @chrisvfeil"
